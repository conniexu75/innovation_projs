https://openalex.org/W2048818637,"The new research field of metagenomics is providing exciting insights into various, previously unclassified ecological systems. Next-generation sequencing technologies are producing a rapid increase of environmental data in public databases. There is great need for specialized software solutions and statistical methods for dealing with complex metagenome data sets.To facilitate the development and improvement of metagenomic tools and the planning of metagenomic projects, we introduce a sequencing simulator called MetaSim. Our software can be used to generate collections of synthetic reads that reflect the diverse taxonomical composition of typical metagenome data sets. Based on a database of given genomes, the program allows the user to design a metagenome by specifying the number of genomes present at different levels of the NCBI taxonomy, and then to collect reads from the metagenome using a simulation of a number of different sequencing technologies. A population sampler optionally produces evolved sequences based on source genomes and a given evolutionary tree.MetaSim allows the user to simulate individual read datasets that can be used as standardized test scenarios for planning sequencing projects or for benchmarking metagenomic software."
https://openalex.org/W2092238715,"Quadruplex structures that result from stacking of guanine quartets in nucleic acids possess such thermodynamic stability that their resolution in vivo is likely to require specific recognition by specialized enzymes. We previously identified the major tetramolecular quadruplex DNA resolving activity in HeLa cell lysates as the gene product of DHX36 (Vaughn, J. P., Creacy, S. D., Routh, E. D., Joyner-Butt, C., Jenkins, G. S., Pauli, S., Nagamine, Y., and Akman, S. A. (2005) J. Biol Chem. 280, 38117–38120), naming the enzyme G4 Resolvase 1 (G4R1). G4R1 is also known as RHAU, an RNA helicase associated with the AU-rich sequence of mRNAs. We now show that G4R1/RHAU binds to and resolves tetramolecular RNA quadruplex as well as tetramolecular DNA quadruplex structures. The apparent Kd values of G4R1/RHAU for tetramolecular RNA quadruplex and tetramolecular DNA quadruplex were exceptionally low: 39 ± 6 and 77 ± 6pm, respectively, as measured by gel mobility shift assay. In competition studies tetramolecular RNA quadruplex structures inhibited tetramolecular DNA quadruplex structure resolution by G4R1/RHAU more efficiently than tetramolecular DNA quadruplex structures inhibited tetramolecular RNA quadruplex structure resolution. Down-regulation of G4R1/RHAU in HeLa T-REx cells by doxycycline-inducible short hairpin RNA caused an 8-fold loss of RNA and DNA tetramolecular quadruplex resolution, consistent with G4R1/RHAU representing the major tetramolecular quadruplex helicase activity for both RNA and DNA structures in HeLa cells. This study demonstrates for the first time the RNA quadruplex resolving enzymatic activity associated with G4R1/RHAU and its exceptional binding affinity, suggesting a potential novel role for G4R1/RHAU in targeting in vivo RNA quadruplex structures."

Here, we present a crystal structure of WDR5 bound to an MLL peptide. Surprisingly, we find that WDR5 utilizes the same pocket shown to bind histone H3 for this MLL interaction. Furthermore, the WDR5-MLL interaction is disrupted preferentially by mono- and di-methylated Lys-4 histone H3 over unmodified and tri-methylated Lys-4 histone H3. These data implicate a delicate interplay between the effector, WDR5, the catalytic subunit, MLL, and the substrate, histone H3, of the MLL complex. We suggest that the activity of the MLL complex might be regulated through this interplay.

We suggest that the activity of the MLL complex might be regulated through this interplay. DNA in eukaryotic cells forms into higher order structures made up of chromatin. Chromatin, and its higher order structure, is dynamically modified in concert with gene expression and cell cycle. The fundamental unit of the chromatin, the nucleosome, is composed of a histone octamer (dimers of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) and 146 base pairs of DNA, which wrap around the histone octamer (1.Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6987) Google Scholar). Histones have unstructured N- or C-terminal tails protruding out of the nucleosome core structure. These tails are covalently modified with methyl, acetyl, phospho, ubiquitin, sumo, and ADP-ribose moieties (2.Wang G.G. Allis C.D. Chi P. Trends Mol. Med. 2007; 13: 363-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Addition and removal of these covalent modifications can affect gene expression, as the modifications can serve to recruit effector proteins. Methylation of lysine (or arginine) of histones adds another layer of complexity, as lysine can be mono-, di-, and tri-methylated, and arginine mono-, and di-methylated. Histone H3 Lys-4 and Lys-27 methylations are particularly interesting, because these marks are antagonistic to each other in their functions in that they are highly correlated with gene activation (Lys-4) and repression (Lys-27) (3.Francis N.J. Kingston R.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 409-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Previously, in an effort to find an effector molecule recognizing a methylated Lys-4 of histone H3, the WDR5 protein was identified as a methyl Lys-4 H3-specific-binding protein, and it was shown that WDR5 is required for tri-methylation of histone H3 in vivo (4.Wysocka J. Swigut T. Milne T.A. Dou Y. Zhang X. Burlingame A.L. Roeder R.G. Brivanlou A.H. Allis C.D. Cell. 2005; 121: 859-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). WDR5 belongs to the WD40 repeat protein family. The WD40 repeat is a well characterized protein-protein interaction domain involved in diverse cellular processes. The WDR5 protein was also previously identified as a component of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) 3The abbreviations used are: MLL, mixed lineage leukemia; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; PDB, Protein Data Bank; aa, amino acids; GST, glutathione S-transferase. complex (5.Yokoyama A. Wang Z. Wysocka J. Sanyal M. Aufiero D.J. Kitabayashi I. Herr W. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5639-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). The MLL complex is a histone H3 Lys-4 methyltransferase. ASH2L, RBBP5, and MLL interact with WDR5 to comprise a core MLL complex (5.Yokoyama A. Wang Z. Wysocka J. Sanyal M. Aufiero D.J. Kitabayashi I. Herr W. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5639-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). WDR5, ASH2L, and RBBP5 also form complexes with the Set1 protein and with the four isoforms of MLL: MLL1, MLL2, MLL3, and MLL4. The MLL and Set1 proteins are the catalytic subunits of these complexes, and each contains a SET domain at the C terminus. However, the molecular functions of each component are largely unknown, as are many of the molecular mechanisms that regulate the function of the MLL complex. WDR5 is a component of the MLL complex, is required for histone H3 tri-methylation, and binds histone H3; those observations that have led to the proposal that it is a presenter component of MLL, meaning that WDR5 presents methylated histone H3 substrates to the MLL complex for further methylation. Crystal structures of WDR5 bound to methylated histone H3 Lys-4 peptides have been reported (6.Couture J.F. Collazo E. Trievel R.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 698-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 7.Han Z. Guo L. Wang H. Shen Y. Deng X.W. Chai J. Mol.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4245-4252Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, surprisingly, not as initially expected, the methylated Lys-4 side chain has minimal interaction with WDR5 in these structures. Based on these crystal structures, and on binding experiments with isothermal calorimetry and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) techniques, it has been suggested that WDR5 does not discriminate the methylation status of histone H3 Lys-4, in contrast to initial results (6.Couture J.F. Collazo E. Trievel R.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 698-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 8.Ruthenburg A.J. Wang W. Graybosch D.M. Li H. Allis C.D. Patel D.J. Verdine G.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 704-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). These discrepancies have not been resolved. Here, we identify a WDR5-interacting region in MLL and present the crystal structure of WDR5 bound to this MLL1 peptide. Surprisingly, the crystal structure shows that WDR5 interacts with MLL1 via the same pocket, which was previously shown to be the H3-binding pocket. Moreover, our binding experiments show that the WDR5-MLL1 interaction is preferentially competed by mono- or di-methylated Lys-4 histone H3. These data imply that WDR5 binds preferentially to mono- or di-methylated histone H3 over unmodified histone H3 in the presence of the MLL protein. We suggest a model in which there is an interplay between the histone H3 substrate of the MLL enzyme and MLL itself that is modulated by methylation status of the substrate. The MLL complex, and the subsequent methylation of histone H3, might therefore be regulated by a delicate feedback mechanism. Protein Expression and Purification—WDR5 and MLL fragments were cloned into pGEX_6p vector and expressed in glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion forms in Escherichia coli. GST fusion forms of MLL or WDR5 were expressed in BL21(DE3) E. coli at 17 °C with 17 h of induction with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells expressing the proteins were harvested in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, and 5% (v/v) glycerol, The cells were sonicated, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. GST-WDR5 and GST-MLL were captured by glutathione-agarose resin (GE Healthcare) and further purified by HiTrap Q (GE Healthcare) ion exchange chromatography. The proteins were stored in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl buffer. For WDR5 crystallization, GST was removed by Precission Protease (GE Healthcare) and further purified by Hitrap Q (GH Healthcare) ion exchange and Superdex S75 16/60 (GE Healthcare) size exclusion chromatography column. Crystallization and Data Collection—WDR5-MLL peptide crystals were obtained under conditions similar to the previously reported conditions (6.Couture J.F. Collazo E. Trievel R.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 698-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) for WDR5 crystallization in the presence of 2 mm MLL peptide (ARAEVHLRKSAFD) (BioSyn). Plate-type crystals were grown by the vapor diffusion method in mother liquor containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 15-20% PEG3350, and 60 mm ammonium sulfate. For cryo-protection, the crystals were soaked in a cryo-solution containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 18% PEG 3350, 18% EG, and 60 mm ammonium sulfate, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at 1.0809 Å at beamline X29A at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). The crystals diffracted up to 1.37 Å, and the space was determined as C2221 containing one molecule per asymmetric unit. WDR5-MLL peptide structure was determined by molecular replacement using WDR5 (PDB: 2H13) as a search model. The structure was refined with the program CNS with Rwork 19.03% and Rfree 19.98%. The coordinates were deposited at the Protein Data Bank with a PDB code of 3EMH. Pull-down and Competition Experiments—GST-MLL228 proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) were incubated with WDR5 in a buffer (Buffer A) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol for 2 h. Proteins bound to the bead were collected by brief centrifugation and washed with the Buffer A several times. Bound WDR5 was analyzed in SDS-PAGE gel, and the amount of protein bound to the bead was measured by densitometer (Bio-Rad). The bound fractions were normalized by the amounts of MLL. For competition experiments, GST-MLL228 was incubated with WDR5 (3 μm) with the increasing amounts of unmodified, mono-, di-, and tri-methylated histone H3 peptides (1-11 aa, 5, 20, 60, 150 μm) (BioSyn), and the amount of bound WDR5 was analyzed as described above. Surface Plasmon Resonance—For KD measurements, the surface of a CM5 chip was activated with a mixture of EDC and NHS. GST-MLL228 and GST-MLLpep were immobilized on the Chip with 663 and 607 RU, and GST was immobilized on the reference cells with 610 and 605 RU, respectively. After immobilization, the surface was blocked with 1 m ethanolamine solution and conditioned with a regeneration buffer containing 37.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1.5 m NaCl, and 100 mm imidazole. WDR5 (0, 50, 100, 250, 500, 500, 1000 nm) for both GST-MLL228 and GST-MLLpep were used as analytes for binding. Each cycle was composed of 120-s injection, 300-s dissociation, and 60-s regeneration with 30 μl/min flow rate. KD values were estimated using a steady state affinity model using Biacore T100 BiaEvaluation software (GE Healthcare) due to the surface heterogeneity. For competition experiments, unmodified (ARTKQTARKST-biotin) histone H3 and di-methylated Lys-4 histone H3 (ARTKme2QTARKST-biotin) were immobilized on Fc2 and Fc4 channels of a Sensor Chip SA, respectively, and Fc1 and Fc3 channels were used for references. For immobilization, the surfaces were conditioned with regeneration buffers: Reg-1 (50 mm NaOH, 1.5 m NaCl) and Reg-2 (0.1% SDS), and the peptides were immobilized with the similar (∼100 RU) amounts. The surfaces were then blocked with 1 mm biotin solution. WDR5 at two different concentrations (250 and 500 nm) was injected into four channels simultaneously with increasing amounts of MLL peptides (ARAEVHLRKSAFD, 0, 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 μm). The injection cycles were composed of 120-s injection, 300-s dissociation, two times 30-s regeneration with the Reg-1 buffer, and 30-s regeneration with the Reg-2 buffer. Data were then collected in a manual mode, and binding curves were obtained by subtracting reference curves. MLL Interacts with WDR5 using a Histone H3-like Motif—The MLL1 complex is composed of WDR5, MLL1, RBBP5, ASH2L, and MENIN. It has been shown that the C-terminal region of MLL1 interacts with WDR5, RBBP5, and ASH2L (5.Yokoyama A. Wang Z. Wysocka J. Sanyal M. Aufiero D.J. Kitabayashi I. Herr W. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5639-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). However, the precise region in MLL1 responsible for interaction with other subunits has not been delineated. To begin a molecular characterization of the interaction between MLL and the other components, we mapped the portion of MLL1 that interacts with WDR5. We generated a series of deletion mutants: MLL228 (3742-3969 aa), MLL205 (3765-3969 aa), MLL197 (3773-3969 aa), and MLL158 (3812-3696 aa) (Fig. 1A). All constructs contain the SET domain of MLL1, which is responsible for catalyzing the methylation of Lys-4 of histone H3. We examined the interactions of the MLL deletion mutants with WDR5 by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). MLL228 and MLL205 formed a stable complex with WDR5, but MLL197 and MLL158 did not. We conclude that the boundary for interaction with WDR5 occurs at the C-terminal to amino acid 3765. This region is located between the FYRC and SET domains of MLL1. We next tested whether the region that was required for binding to WDR5 (immediately C-terminal to amino acid 3765) is also sufficient for binding. We generated a GST-MLL peptide fusion containing these sequences (GST-MLL1pep:ARAEVHLRKSAFD) and examined its binding ability to WDR5 by GST pull-down experiments (Fig. 1C). These experiments show that GST-MLL1pep is sufficient to bind to WDR5. To further examine the difference in the binding properties between MLL228 and MLL1pep, we measured equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) of MLL228 and MLL1pep with WDR5 using SPR. We immobilized GST-MLL228 or GST-MLL1pep on CM5 chips. For reference, we similarly immobilized GST alone. We then injected WDR5 as an analyte. WDR5 bound GST-MLL228 with a KD estimated in the sub-hundred nanomolar range and GST-MLL1pep with a similar estimated KD (supplemental Fig. S2). Given these data, we conclude that the short sequence that we identified in MLL is a major binding motif for WDR5, although it might not be a sole interaction region. Surprisingly, examination of this sequence revealed a histone H3-like motif (Fig. 1B). This finding suggests the possibility that WDR5 might interact with MLL using the same pocket previously shown to bind histone H3. WDR5 forms complexes with four distinct MLL isoforms; the histone H3-like motif is modestly conserved among the MLL isoforms (Fig. 1B). We examined the binding ability of the H3-like motifs seen in other MLLs. We generated GST fusions with MLL peptides from each MLL isoform and examined the binding ability of these peptides to bind WDR5 by GST pull-down experiments (Fig. 1D). The GST-MLL1pep and GST-MLL4pep bound WDR5 and GST-MLL2pep and GST-MLL3pep did not. These data indicate that there might be different modes of WDR5 binding among the distinct MLL isoforms. WDR5 Interacts with MLL1 through the Histone H3-binding Pocket—To understand the molecular basis underlying the interaction between WDR5 and MLL, we determined the crystal structure of WDR5 bound to an MLL1 peptide (ARAEVHLRKSAFD) containing the histone H3-like motif. The crystal structure of the WDR5-MLL peptide complex was determined at 1.37-Å resolution by molecular replacement using the structure of free WDR5 as a search model and refined with an Rwork of 19.03% and Rfree of 19.98% (Table 1). The structure of WDR5 is almost identical to the previously determined WDR5 structure. The difference Fourier map with free WDR5 against the data collected from the WDR5-MLL peptide complex showed extra electron density that we assigned to the MLL peptide (Fig. 2B). The clear electron density enabled us to assign the MLL peptide unambiguously. To our surprise, the MLL peptide is bound in a pocket located at the center of the WD40 structure that was previously identified as the histone H3-binding pocket (Fig. 2A). Not only is the location of the MLL peptide identical to that of the H3 peptide, the conformation of the MLL peptide is almost identical to that of histone H3 bound to WDR5 (Fig. 2C). Strikingly similar to the WDR5-H3 interaction, the side chain of the Arg-2 in the MLL peptide is inserted and sandwiched by two aromatic rings from Phe-133 and Phe-263 (Figs. 2D and 3, A and B).TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsWDR5-MLLData CollectionSpace groupC2221Unit cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)78.16, 97.71, 79.82α = β = γ (°)90Resolution (Å)50-1.37 (1.42-1.37)aValues in parenthesis are for the highest-resolution shell.Rsymb∑(Ihkl - <Ihkl>)/∑<Ihkl>, where <Ihkl> is the mean intensity of all reflections equivalent to reflection hkl by symmetry.0.059 (0.25)I/σ(I)36.1 (3.1)Completeness (%)99.0 (99.3)Redundancy7.4 (3.9)RefinementResolution (Å)50-1.37No. unique reflections64701Rwork/Rfreec∑||Fo| - |Fc||/∑Fo| where 5% of randomly selected date was used for Rfree.0.1903/0.1998No. atoms2678Protein2403Water/ion275B-factorsProtein10.754Water/ion23.169R.m.s. deviationsBond length (Å)0.004589Bond angles (°)1.898Ramachandran (%)89.4 (10.6)dValue in parenthesis is for additional allowed regions.a Values in parenthesis are for the highest-resolution shell.b ∑(Ihkl - <Ihkl>)/∑<Ihkl>, where <Ihkl> is the mean intensity of all reflections equivalent to reflection hkl by symmetry.c ∑||Fo| - |Fc||/∑Fo| where 5% of randomly selected date was used for Rfree.d Value in parenthesis is for additional allowed regions.

D, GST pull-down experiments with GST-MLL228 and WDR5 mutants.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The interaction between WDR5 and MLL also displays distinct interactions from those seen between WDR5 and histone H3 (Figs. 2D and 3, A and B). For example, in the WDR5-MLL structure, Val-5 of the MLL peptide makes hydrophobic interactions with the phenyl ring of Tyr-260 and the hydrocarbon backbone in Lys-259 of WDR5, while the fifth residue of the H3 peptide (Gln-5) makes hydrogen interactions with the hydroxyl group of the Tyr-260 side chain and ϵ-amine from Lys-259. Furthermore, His-6 of the MLL peptide interacts with a hydrophobic pocket composed of Phe-149, Tyr-191, and Pro-173, an interaction that was not seen in the WDR5-histone H3 structure. Finally, Glu-322 in WDR5, which interacts with methylated histone H3K4 in the WDR5-H3 complex structure, is swung away from the MLL peptide. To confirm the interactions observed in the crystal structure, we made R2A, H6A, and H6F mutations in the histone H3-like motif in MLL228 and performed GST pull-down experiments. Mutating Arg-2 to Ala significantly decreased the ability of MLL228 to bind to WDR5 (Fig. 3C). In contrast, mutating His-6 to Ala slightly decreased and mutating His-6 to Phe slightly increased binding affinity of MLL to WDR5. Thus Arg-2 plays a more significant role than His-6 in driving binding of MLL to WDR5. We then generated a series of WDR5 mutants and examined their binding properties (Fig. 3D). Mutating either Phe-133 or Phe-263 to alanines impaired the binding of WDR5 to MLL228; this was anticipated as these residues sandwich Arg-2. To examine the interaction between His-6 in the MLL peptide and WDR5, Phe-149 of WDR5 was mutated to Ala. This mutation significantly disrupts interaction with MLL indicating that Phe-149 is critical for binding. We also examined binding by the WDR5 D107A mutant, which was previously shown to interact with Ala-1 in histone H3 (8.Ruthenburg A.J. Wang W. Graybosch D.M. Li H. Allis C.D. Patel D.J. Verdine G.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 704-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Mutating Asp-107 to Ala greatly impaired binding of WDR5 to MLL indicating that Asp-107 is involved in MLL interaction in addition to the interaction with H3. Lastly, we mutated Glu-322 to alanine. This residue interacts with the methylated Lys-4 of histone H3 (6.Couture J.F. Collazo E. Trievel R.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 698-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 7.Han Z.

Arrowsmith C.H. Min J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4245-4252Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The WDR5 E322A mutant shows comparable binding affinity to wild-type WDR5, indicating that Glu-322 is not involved in the interaction with MLL. Thus the crystal structure of WDR5-MLL1pep and the mutagenesis studies support the conclusion that WDR5 uses the same pocket for interacting with both MLL and histone H3, but uses that pocket differently. Methylated Histone Binding Properties of the WDR5-MLL Complex—Based on our finding that WDR5 uses the same binding pocket for the MLL and histone H3 interactions, the previous observations that WDR5 was identified as a module for recognition of H3-Lys-4-methylated histone (4.Wysocka J. Swigut T. Milne T.A. Dou Y. Zhang X. Burlingame A.L. Roeder R.G. Brivanlou A.H. Allis C.D. Cell. 2005; 121: 859-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), and that WDR5 alone appears to have similar affinity for histone H3 in vitro regardless of the Lys-4 methylation status (6.Couture J.F. Collazo E. Trievel R.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 698-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 8.Ruthenburg A.J. Wang W. Graybosch D.M. Li H. Allis C.D. Patel D.J. Verdine G.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 704-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that methylation might play a role in modulating the binding to these distinct proteins. As the histone H3 tail is the substrate for MLL methylation, the ability of this substrate and its enzyme to bind to the same site in WDR5 might provide a feedback mechanism during the catalysis of methylation. For example, the methylated histone, but not the unmodified histone, might preferentially compete for binding to WDR5 and thus compete MLL away from WDR5. To test this hypothesis, we performed competition experiments with methylated and unmodified histone peptide. We incubated GST-MLL228 and WDR5 in the presence of increasing amounts of competitors; we used unmodified, mono-, di-, and tri-methylated histone H3 peptide (1-11 aa). We then examined the amounts of WDR5 bound to GST-MLL228 (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, mono- and dimethylated histone peptides were able to compete MLL from the WDR5-MLL complex preferentially over unmodified and tri-methylated histone peptides. We conclude that mono- and di-methylated histone H3 compete for MLL binding better than unmodified or tri-methylated H3 peptide and, consistent with previous studies, that the methylation status of H3 impacts interaction with WDR5. To further assess the binding properties of WDR5 to unmodified and methylated Lys-4 histone H3, we performed competition experiments using SPR to measure interactions. We immobilized unmodified and di-methylated histone H3 peptide on a Chip and measured binding of WDR5 to H3 in the presence of increasing amounts of MLL peptide (Fig. 5A). As the amount of the competitor-MLL peptide increased, the relative amounts of the binding of WDR5 for unmodified histone H3 drops faster than that of WDR5 for di-methylated histone H3, as compared with the amount of WDR5 bound in the absence of the competitor (Fig. 5, A and B, and supplemental Fig. S3). This result is consistent with our hypothesis that di-methyl histone H3 preferentially competes for MLL binding relative to unmodified H3. We conclude that a specificity for interaction of WDR5 with methylated histone H3 is revealed by studying competition for binding with MLL. The results presented here provide structural insight into the WDR5-MLL interaction and reveal preferential interactions of methylated histone H3 in disrupting the MLL-WDR5 complex. Surprisingly, WDR5 utilizes the same pocket for both MLL and histone H3. When WDR5 is bound to MLL, methylation of histone H3 increases the ability of the H3 peptide to compete for binding. Thus, the MLL-WDR5 interaction is anticipated to be weakened by the presence of methylated histone H3, the product of MLL catalysis. This weakened binding to WDR5 might impact the ability of MLL to move to other nearby H3 substrates, or otherwise alter its further catalysis, leading to a potential for regulation of the methylation reaction. MLL Interacts with WDR5 through Histone H3-like Motif—We show that MLL uses a histone H3-like motif to interact with WDR5. The histone H3-like motif is required and sufficient for MLL to bind WDR5. It was previously suggested that the SET domain in MLL is required for interacting with WDR5 (5.Yokoyama A. Wang Z. Wysocka J. Sanyal M. Aufiero D.J. Kitabayashi I. Herr W. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5639-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). We show by solution and structural studies that the histone H3-like motif is capable of tight interaction. Gel filtration results show that removal of this region diminishes the ability of a fragment containing the SET domain to interact with WDR5. Consistent with this, our binding experiments performed using SPR show that the histone H3-like motif has a similar binding affinity to that of MLL-228 (supplemental Fig. S2). These data do not rule out, however, an ability of the SET domain of MLL to contribute to binding affinity to WDR5. The core components of MLL complex include WDR5, RBBP5, and ASH2L. Complexes in this family can form with four different isoforms of MLL (MLL1, MLL2, MLL3, MLL4). Among those, only MLL1 and MLL4 have a histone H3-like motif that interacts with WDR5 (Fig. 1, B and D). This observation raises the possibility that in other complexes, WDR5 might interact with MLL2 or MLL3 through another region, perhaps the SET domain. Alternatively, the same region as used in MLL1 might be used, and the interaction might be stabilized by other factors, although MLL2 and MLL3 contain a proline residue in this region that is expected to be problematic for binding to the pocket. It is interesting to speculate that different binding modes might lead to a functional distinction between the MLL complexes. WDR5 Uses the Same Pocket to Interact with MLL and Histone H3—The previous crystal structures showed that WDR5 uses the pocket located at the center of the β-barrel structure for binding histone H3 (6.Couture J.F.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4245-4252Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). While WDR5 utilizes the same pocket for MLL and histone H3, the MLL peptide interacts with different surfaces of the binding pocket in WDR5 that were not observed in WDR5-H3 interaction. In the WDR5-MLL structure, Val-5 of the MLL peptide makes hydrophobic interactions with Tyr-260 and Lys-259 side chains and His-6 interacts with a hydrophobic pocket in the WDR5. We also observed similar interactions, for example Arg-2 interacts with two phenylalanines of WDR5 in both structures. Consistent with our recent studies on other WD40 repeat protein, p55 (10.Song J.J. Garlick J.D. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), this finding suggests that WD40 repeat proteins are versatile proteins that can interact with their partners in diverse manners. Methylated Histone Binding Properties of WDR5-MLL—The notion that WDR5 accommodates MLL and histone H3 within the same binding pocket leads to several inferences for the mechanism of the MLL complex. Most interestingly, our results may provide an explanation for a seeming paradox among previous studies. WDR5 was identified as a methyl-Lys-4 H3-binding protein by Wysocka et al. (4.Wysocka J. Swigut T. Milne T.A. Dou Y. Zhang X. Burlingame A.L. Roeder R.G. Brivanlou A.H. Allis C.D. Cell. 2005; 121: 859-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). However, subsequent structural studies on WDR5 were not able to explain how WDR5 specifically binds to methylated histone as compared with unmodified histone. Our data implicate that WDR5 might have a binding preference for mono- or di-methylated histone in the context of the WDR5-MLL complex. At this moment, it is not clear if WDR5 binds to mono- and di-methylated Lys-4 histone H3 with same similar affinities in vivo. For example, it is possible that, in vivo, WDR5 in the context of the MLL complex might have a preference for di-methylated histone over monomethylated histone, and our competition experiment might not detect this binding property. It is not clear what mechanism might be responsible for the preference for methylated H3 in the context of MLL binding. It might be possible that the surface of WDR5 bound to MLL displays a functional patch that helps mono- or di-methylated Lys-4 histone H3 bind and therefore compete with MLL binding. Further work is needed to address this intriguing this question. Implications for the Function of the WDR-MLL Complex—Our studies reveal the WDR5-H3-binding pocket as having the ability to be occupied by MLL in the MLL complex. In this situation, as MLL products, mono- or di-methylated histone H3 accumulate, MLL bound to WDR5 might be displaced or might dissociate from WDR5 because of this competition, causing WDR5 to be bound to methylated histone H3. It is not currently clear how this might impact further activity of the displaced MLL protein. The interactions among the subunits in the MLL complex might be rearranged in a way that allows MLL to further methylate the WDR5-bound substrate into trimethylation status while MLL still interacts with WDR5 through the SET domain. Alternatively, in the presence of methylated histone, the methyl-histone might compete out MLL1 from the complex and allow other MLL isoforms to dock with WDR5 to further methylate the WDR5-bound histone. In this regard, it is notable that only MLL1 and MLL4 contain a histone H3-like motif competent to bind WDR5. Functional studies with various MLL family proteins are needed to address this issue further. This study provides structural insight into WDR5-MLL interaction and molecular basis of interplay among effector molecule-WDR5, catalytic subunit-MLL, and substrate-histone H3. These results reveal a more subtle interplay between these multisubunit chromatin-modifying complexes and their substrate than previously expected. We thank Drs.

Although S-nitrosylation appears similar to Cys oxidation induced by reactive oxygen species, the molecular mechanism and biological consequence remain unclear. We investigated the structural process of S-nitrosylation of protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B). We treated PTP1B with various NO donors, including S-nitrosothiol reagents and compound-releasing NO radicals, to produce site-specific Cys S-nitrosylation identified using advanced mass spectrometry (MS) techniques. Quantitative MS showed that the active site Cys-215 was the primary residue susceptible to S-nitrosylation. The crystal structure of NO donor-reacted PTP1B at 2.6 Å resolution revealed that the S-NO state at Cys-215 had no discernible irreversibly oxidized forms, whereas other Cys residues remained in their free thiol states. We further demonstrated that S-nitrosylation of the Cys-215 residue protected PTP1B from subsequent H2O2-induced irreversible oxidation. Increasing the level of cellular NO by pretreating cells with an NO donor or by activating ectopically expressed NO synthase inhibited reactive oxygen species-induced irreversible oxidation of endogenous PTP1B. These findings suggest that S-nitrosylation might prevent PTPs from permanent inactivation caused by oxidative stress.

Two major groups of free radicals have been identified as second messengers in signal transduction.

Nitric oxide (NO) and its derivatives, which make up the reactive nitrogen species (RNS), are the products of NO synthases (NOSs) (2.Hess D.T. Matsumoto A. Kim S.O. Marshall H.E. Stamler J.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 150-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1706) Google Scholar).Both NADPH oxidases and NOSs can be activated in signaling response to a number of extracellular stimuli (3.Mahadev K.

ROS and RNS play a critical role in regulating important signaling events, such as tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent signal transduction (7.Lee S.R. Kwon K.S. Kim S.R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

Cell. 2002; 9: 387-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar) and RNS (10.Mannick J.B. Hausladen A. Liu L. Hess D.T. Zeng M. Miao Q.X. Kane L.S. Gow A.J. Stamler J.S. Science. 1999; 284: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) may function as typical second messengers to transiently control the activity of signaling modulators when they are generated at physiological concentrations. Under certain pathological conditions, however, the role of ROS and RNS becomes more complicated. For example, when ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) occurs in heart and liver, an increased RNS level in ischemic tissues is critical in the protection of cells against subsequent damage due to a ROS burst upon reperfusion (11.Bell R.M. Maddock H.L. Yellon D.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 57: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12.Jones S.P. Bolli R. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2006; 40: 16-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Therefore, although both ROS and RNS are classified as free radical-based second messengers, they may regulate cell signaling differently. The molecular details of their activities are largely unexplored.ROS and RNS regulate the activity of signaling modulators through post-translational modification, which is how they perform their cellular functions (9.Meng T.C.

One of them is the regulation of protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) activities through Cys oxidation (13.Salmeen A. Andersen J.N. Myers M.P. Meng T.C. Hinks J.A. Tonks N.K. Barford D.

Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9340-9345Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) at the active site, the Cys residue in PTPs may also be susceptible to S-nitrosylation mediated by RNS. Some researchers have suggested that PTP inactivation induced by RNS is one of the regulatory mechanisms of cell signaling independent of cGMP (20.Li S. Whorton A.R. Arch. Biochem.

We also investigated whether an increased level of cellular NO prior to exposure of cells with ROS could inhibit permanent oxidation and inactivation of endogenous PTP1B.MATERIALS AND METHODSPreparation of S-Nitrosylated PTP1B for Solution-based Trypsin Digestion—The C-terminally truncated, 37-kDa human PTP1B was purified as described previously (27.Barford D. Keller J.C. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). PTP1B was treated with H2O2 at 37 °C for 10 min or treated with S-nitroso-N-penicillamine (SNAP) (Calbiochem), S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) (Alexis Biochemicals), DETA-NONOate (Sigma), or N-acetylpencillamine (NAP) (Fluka) at 37 °C for 20 min. For analyzing Cys modifications by mass spectrometry, PTP1B was subsequently digested with trypsin (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions.MS Analysis for Identifying S-Nitrosylated Sites of PTP1B—Direct nano-ESI-MS analysis was performed on a Micromass Q-TOF Ultima™ API mass spectrometer (Micromass; Waters) fitted with a nano-LC sprayer. The tryptic peptides were separated on a C18 capillary column connected online to a QSTAR-XL hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex). All tandem mass spectra were interpreted manually.Quantitative MS for Determining Cys Residue Susceptibility to S-Nitrosylation—PTP1B was treated with 1 mm or 0.01 mm SNAP at 37 °C for 20 min, followed by incubation with 10 mm iodoacetic acid for 1 h. The PTP1B was then treated with ascorbate (5 mm; Sigma) for 1 h. Subsequently, PTP1B that had been treated with 1 mm SNAP or 0.01 mm SNAP was labeled with the light or heavy acid-cleavable isotope-code affinity tag (cICAT) reagent (0.1 unit; Applied Biosystems) for 1 h. Two pools of samples were mixed together at a 1:1 ratio and then digested with trypsin. The peptide samples were subjected to MALDI-MS and MS/MS analyses using an Applied Biosystems 4700 proteomics analyzer mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems), as described previously (17.Lou Y.W.

Keller J.C. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The crystal was incubated with SNAP (1 mm) at room temperature for 20 min and then mixed with the mother liquid containing 29% glycerol as an antifreezing reagent. Samples were then subjected to structural analysis using an x-ray generator. Data were recorded, and all data sets of crystal form P3121 were collected for processing using software packages DENZO and SCALEPACK (28.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38368) Google Scholar). Data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table S1.Cell Culture, Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—COS-7 cells (ATCC) were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For transient transfection, cells were incubated with a mixture of plasmid DNA and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunoprecipitation of endogenous PTP1B, an aliquot of total lysate (750 μg) was incubated with rabbit anti-PTP1B antibody (AF1366; R&D Systems) conjugated to protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C for 3 h. An aliquot of immunocomplex or total lysate (25 μg) was subjected to immunoblotting with an antibody against oxidized PTP active site (anti-oxi-PTP antibody, clone 335636; R&D Systems), PTP1B (FG6, Calbiochem), p-eNOS (phospho-Ser-1177; Cell Signaling), or eNOS (BD Transduction Laboratories).Measurement of Intracellular NO Level—Intracellular NO was measured using 4-amino-5-methylamino-2′,7′-difluoroflurescencein diacetate (Invitrogen) by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader equipped with a fluorescence attachment (Infinite 200; Tecan) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.RESULTSIdentification of S-Nitrosylated Cys Residues in PTP1B—PTP1B was used in this study to investigate the molecular basis for S-nitrosylation of Cys residues in PTPs. A direct nanospray ESI-MS (nESI-MS) mapping of the tryptic digests of purified PTP1B identified peptides that carry five of the six Cys sites (Fig. S1A). Following their sequential order from the N terminus, three tryptic peptides, T4 (and T3-4 with a tryptic miscleavage site), T15, and T28, afforded molecular ions that had become 29 mass units higher after treatment with SNAP, an S-nitrosothiol agent. This shift corresponded to a conversion from Cys-SH to Cys-SNO. One important way of helping identify an S-nitrosylated peptide is the characteristic loss of the NO moiety (30 mass units) to generate a cysteinyl radical under ESI-MS conditions (29.Kaneko R. Wada Y. J. Mass Spectrom. 2003; 38: 526-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A careful examination of the transformed nESI-MS data revealed that the implicated signal paired with a 30-mass unit difference was indeed present among the spectral peaks for the SNAP-treated PTP1B (Fig. S1A). This characteristic loss of NO was used to develop an automated, data-dependent MS/MS acquisition of the S-nitrosylated peptides in a nano-LC-nESI-MS/MS run (25.Chen Y.Y. Huang Y.F. Khoo K.H. Meng T.C. Methods (San Diego). 2007; 42: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Specifically, a difference of 30 mass units registered between any pair of signals during an LC-MS survey scan would trigger a targeted MS/MS analysis of the respective peptide ions (25.Chen Y.Y. Huang Y.F. Khoo K.H. Meng T.C. Methods (San Diego). 2007; 42: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Using this method, we identified six pairs of relevant ion signals in the tryptic peptide pool of SNAP-treated PTP1B (Fig. S1B). The corresponding MS/MS data clearly assigned three of these signal pairs to T28 (amino acids 200-221), T4 (amino acids 25-33), and T15 (amino acids 80-103), which confirmed that Cys-32, Cys-92, and Cys-215 were indeed preferred S-nitrosylation sites (Fig. S1, D-F, and Table 1). No other S-nitrosylated Cys-containing tryptic peptides were identified. The remaining two signal pairs were mapped to peptides in PTP1B (T3 and T39; Fig. S1B) that do not contain a Cys residue and thus were not S-nitrosylated. It is possible that an NO-induced modification occurred elsewhere. For example, tryptophan residues are also susceptible to nitrosation (30.Zhang Y.Y. Xu A.M. Nomen M. Walsh M. Keaney Jr., J.F.

Chem. 1996; 271: 14271-14279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Summary of results from mass difference-based MS analysesNO donors (1 mm, 20 min)Chemical characteristicsPeptides selected by mass difference- based programS-Nitrosylated Cys confirmed by MS/MSRelease of NO radicalsTransnitrosylationSNAPYesYesT4, T3-4, T15, and T28Cys-32, Cys-92, and Cys-215GSNOYesYesT4, T3-4, T15, and T28Cys-32, Cys-92, and Cys-215DETA-NONOateYesNoT4, T3-4, and T28Cys-32 and Cys-215 Open table in a new tab The same S-nitrosylation sites were similarly identified when GSNO, an endogenous reservoir of NO groups (31.Singh S.P.

A. 1996; 93: 14428-14433Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), was used as the NO donor instead of SNAP (Fig. S2A and Table 1). A third reagent, DETA-NONOate, which produces only NO radicals (32.Keefer L.K. Nims R.W. Davies K.M. Wink D.A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 281-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is not capable of transnitrosylation (33.Dahm C.C. Moore K. Murphy M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10056-10065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), also effected similar site-specific Cys modifications (Fig. S2B and Table 1). Thus, we concluded that, mechanistically, protein S-nitrosylation (correctly termed S-nitrosation from the chemical point of view (34.Martinez-Ruiz A. Lamas S. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 62: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) can occur through direct reaction with derivatives of NO radicals, such as the higher nitrogen oxide N2O3, which is likely to promote the incorporation of a NO moiety to a thiol (35.Hogg N. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 585-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), in addition to transnitrosylation mediated by GSNO or SNAP.Active Site Cys-215 Most Susceptible to S-Nitrosylation—We next examined the order of S-nitrosylation among the Cys residues using quantitative MS analysis. The facile loss of the NO functional group under MS conditions necessitated the biotin switch method being used so that we could obtain more stable derivatives and incorporate differentiating stable isotopes (36.Jaffrey S.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Ferris C.D. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). We modified the method by replacing the alkylating labels in the two steps outlined in Scheme 1. After treating PTP1B with various concentrations of SNAP, which led to different degrees of S-nitrosylation among the susceptible Cys residues, all remaining free thiols were carboxymethylated. The S-nitrosothiols were then selectively reduced back to free thiols by ascorbate and tagged with either the light or heavy cICAT reagent, for samples originally treated with a high or low dose of SNAP, respectively. The two differentially S-nitrosylated samples were mixed together, digested with trypsin, and directly monitored by MALDI-MS analysis.As expected, only signals corresponding to tryptic peptides containing the implicated S-nitrosylated Cys sites occurred in pairs, because cICAT labels had been incorporated. As shown in Fig. 1A, the three signal pairs we detected were assigned to the labeled peptides, T4, T28, and T15, which carried light/heavy cICAT-labeled Cys-32, Cys-215, and Cys-92, respectively. The monoisotopic peak area ratios of the signal pairs were 1.49, 0.92, and 2.43 for Cys-32, Cys-215, and Cys-92, respectively (Fig. 1, B-D), which indicated that Cys-92 had less S-nitrosylation at a low dose of SNAP (0.01 mm) than at a high dose (1 mm), whereas Cys-215 had a similar degree of S-nitrosylation at both SNAP concentrations. We concluded that PTP S-nitrosylation occurs most readily at the catalytic Cys residue, but the two other Cys sites can likewise be modified at higher doses of SNAP.FIGURE 1Application of the quantitative MS method and structural analysis for identification of the most susceptible Cys residue of PTP1B to S-nitrosylation. A-D, recombinant PTP1B treated with 1 mm SNAP or 0.01 mm SNAP was subjected to differential isotope labeling for quantitative MALDI-MS analysis as described in Scheme 1. The full scan MALDI-MS profile (A) revealed three pairs of cICAT-labeled tryptic peptides with a 9-Da difference, which could be assigned to T4, T28, and T15, as shown in expanded views (B-D), corresponding to the cICAT-labeled peptide pairs containing Cys-32, Cys-215, or Cys-92, respectively. The ratio of light/heavyc ICAT-labeled peak is shown below the spectrum. E, the crystal of PTP1B was soaked with 1 mm SNAP at room temperature for 20 min and subjected tox-ray crystallography. The 2Fo - 2Fc electron density map showed a mixture of reduced and S-nitrosylated states of Cys-215. Other Cys residues (Cys-32, -92, -121, -226, and -231) remained in the completely reduced form. Inset, the expended view of electron density map illustrates the presence of an S-nitrosothiol form of Cys-215.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To provide a structural basis for the site specificity of S-nitrosylation, the native crystal of PTP1B was soaked with 1 mm SNAP for 20 min and analyzed using x-ray crystallography. The electron density map indicated that the active site Cys-215 displayed a mixed conformation that could be assigned to a free thiolate anion form (Cys-S-) and an S-nitrosothiol form (Cys-SNO) (Fig. 1E). Closer inspection revealed that, upon the S-nitrosothiol formation of Cys-215, water-mediated hydrogen bonds and a subtle conformational change on the side chain of residues around the catalytic site collectively orchestrated a network capable of stabilizing the S-nitrosylated structure (Fig. S3). Interestingly, under this condition, Cys-32 and Cys-92, which are exposed on the surface of PTP1B, remained in the reduced form (Fig. 1E). This finding is consistent with quantitative MS analysis, which showed these two Cys residues to be less reactive than the active site Cys-215 (Fig. 1, A-D). Therefore, the NO-mediated modification appears to target primarily the active site Cys residue in PTP1B. In addition, the MS and structural data suggested that S-nitrosylation may regulate PTP1B through a reversible modification of the active site Cys in an S-nitrosothiol form that is unlike the irreversibly oxidized forms, such as the sulfinic acid (Cys-SO2H) or sulfonic acid (Cys-SO3H).S-Nitrosylation Protects the Active Site against Irreversible Oxidation—Since the observation that NO prevents cells from ROS-induced damage was first reported (37.Wink D.A. Hanbauer I. Krishna M.C. DeGraff W. Gamson J. Mitchell J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9813-9817Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar), the cytoprotective effect of NO and RNS has been regarded as one of their most important biological functions (38.Duranski M.R. Greer J.J. Dejam A. Jaganmohan S. Hogg N. Langston W. Patel R.P. Yet S.F. Wang X. Kevil C.G. Gladwin M.T. Lefer D.J. J. Clin.

A. 2004; 101: 13683-13688Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). We found the NO donor-induced modification of the active site Cys-215 to be fully reversible (Fig. 1). In contrast, it has been recently reported (15.Denu J.M. Tanner K.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5633-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 17.Lou Y.W. Chen Y.Y. Hsu S.F. Chen R.K. Lee C.L.

Methods (San Diego). 2007; 42: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and further confirmed by our current study (Fig. S4A) that when PTP1B is exposed to H2O2, the same Cys-215 site is irreversibly oxidized. Therefore, S-nitrosylation may reversibly trap the Cys residue at the active site and protect it against permanent ROS-induced oxidative damage. We used direct MS analysis to further examine the protective effect of S-nitrosylation. In nano-LC-nESI-MS, the tryptic peptide (T28) carrying the active site Cys-215 in SO2H and SO3H forms can be readily resolved from later-eluting T28 with Cys-215 in the free SH form or SNO form (Fig. 2A). We found that, once formed, S-nitrosothiol could not be further converted to sulfinic or sulfonic acids either by prolonged SNAP treatment (data not shown) or by exposure to subsequent oxidative stress (1 mm H2O2) (Fig. 2A). In a control experiment, the sample was similarly treated with 1"

Bullen J.W. Hart G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2008; 295: E17-E28Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The addition of the monosaccharide moiety is catalyzed by O-GlcNAc-transferase (OGT) using UDP-GlcNAc as the nucleotide sugar donor (2Haltiwanger R.S. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9005-9013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the hydrolysis of the O-GlcNAc residue is catalyzed by O-GlcNAcase (3Dong D.L. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19321-19330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In many respects, protein GlcNAcylation is analogous to Ser/Thr phosphorylation. However, a primary difference is that, unlike phosphorylation, which is catalyzed by almost 400 Ser/Thr kinases encoded by the human genome (4Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S. Science. 2002; 298: 1912-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (6126) Google Scholar), GlcNAcylation is catalyzed by the products of a single human gene (5Nolte D. Muller U. Mamm. Genome. 2002; 13: 62-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 6Shafi R. Iyer S.P. Ellies L.G. O'Donnell N. Marek K.W. Chui D. Hart G.W. Marth J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5735-5739Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Although kinase substrate selectivity is partially genetically encoded, the mechanism of OGT substrate specificity is not clear. More than 600 GlcNAcylated proteins have now been identified (1Copeland R.J. Bullen J.W. Hart G.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2008; 295: E17-E28Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), yet the question of how OGT is able to distinguish its substrates from other proteins is not well understood.Using synthetic peptide substrates, OGT does seem to show sequence specificity in vitro. In addition, OGT is responsive to a wide range of UDP-GlcNAc concentrations, and the affinity of OGT for peptide substrates is altered with different UDP-GlcNAc concentrations (7Kreppel L.K. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32015-32022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). As a result, it has been suggested that the substrate specificity of OGT in vivo may be regulated by UDP-GlcNAc concentrations, which have been shown to be responsive to the nutritional state of the cell (8Wang J. Liu R. Hawkins M. Barzilai N. Rossetti L. Nature. 1998; 393: 684-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 9Marshall S. Nadeau O. Yamasaki K. J. Biol.

Although this hypothesis does partially explain hyperglycemia-mediated changes in protein GlcNAcylation, it cannot account for changes in GlcNAcylation of specific proteins that are independent of alterations in UDP-GlcNAc concentration.The crystal structure of an OGT homolog has been solved recently along with a partial structure of OGT, providing insight into its regulation (11Jinek M.

The tetratricopeptide repeat domain of OGT forms a large superhelical structure very similar to that of importin α (11Jinek M. Rehwinkel J. Lazarus B.D. Izaurralde E. Hanover J.A. Conti E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1001-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 12Martinez-Fleites C. Macauley M.S. He Y. Shen D.L. Vocadlo D.J. Davies G.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 764-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), suggesting that OGT may interact with a diverse group of proteins through its N terminus (13Kreppel L.K. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9308-9315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 14Iyer S.P. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24608-24616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).In support of this hypothesis, it has been shown that Trak1 (previously known as OIP106) interacts with the tetratricopeptide repeat domain of OGT, recruiting OGT to RNA polymerase II (15Iyer S.P. Akimoto Y. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5399-5409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Other studies have since revealed OGT to be regulated by its interacting proteins (16Yang X. Zhang F. Kudlow J.E. Cell. 2002; 110: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 17Marz P. Stetefeld J. Bendfeldt K. Nitsch C. Reinstein J. Shoeman R.L. Dimitriades-Schmutz B. Schwager M.

Recently we have demonstrated that glucose deprivation in Neuro-2a cells increases the OGT-mediated GlcNAcylation of neurofilament H via targeting mediated by activated p38 (19Cheung W.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13009-13020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). However, in this case, instead of interacting with the tetratricopeptide repeat domain of OGT, p38 interacts with the C terminus of OGT. Interestingly this same region of OGT has also been shown to interact with phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, leading to recruitment of OGT to the plasma membrane during insulin signaling (20Yang X. Ongusaha P.P. Miles P.D. Havstad J.C. Zhang F. So W.V. Kudlow J.E. Michell R.H. Olefsky J.M. Field S.J. Evans R.M. Nature. 2008; 451: 964-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar).Thus, it is becoming apparent that recruitment of OGT through its interaction domains may be a key mode of regulating OGT activity and substrate specificity. To further explore this hypothesis, we sought to identify additional OGT-interacting proteins using a conventional yeast two-hybrid screen. Here not only do we identify candidate OGT regulators, but also we demonstrate that MYPT1 and CARM1 can both function to alter OGT substrate specificity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture—Neuro-2a murine neuroblastoma cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (5 mm glucose; Mediatech) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products) and penicillin/streptomycin (Mediatech) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2.Plasmids, siRNAs, and Transfections—pJL59-OGT, the yeast expression plasmid encoding full-length rat OGT fused to GAL4 DNA binding domain, was created by standard PCR methods and transformed into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH109 (MATa) strain using the polyethylene glycol/lithium acetate procedure.pGEX-MYPT1, the prokaryotic expression vector encoding full-length chicken MYPT1, was provided as a kind gift from Dr. Anne A.

The yeast two-hybrid screen was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.The AH109 strain containing pJL59-OGT was mated with the Y189 strain pretransformed with the pACT2 cDNA library. Mating efficiency was determined to be within the acceptable limits according to the manufacturer's protocol. Next diploid yeast were assayed for β-galactosidase reporter gene expression by filter assay. Yeast colonies positive for β-galactosidase expression were selected for growth on SD/–His/–Leu/–Trp minimal medium (for low stringency selection). Yeast colonies were replica plated onto SD/–Ade/–His/–Leu/–Trp/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-d-galactopyranoside (X-α-gal) minimal medium to select for medium (white) and high (blue) stringency clones. Positive clones were retested according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid DNA purified from the clones surviving the high stringency selection that were confirmed by retesting were sequenced.

Reactions were performed at room temperature for 1 h, stopped with Laemmli buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. The gels were then fixed, stained for protein using Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, treated with En3Hance autofluorography solution (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), dried, and exposed to film.For OGT assays toward lysate, rat brain lysate was enriched over Sepharose covalently coupled to MYPT1 or CARM1. Proteins were eluted with 8 m urea, concentrated, and buffer-exchanged into 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. 20 μg of the enriched lysate was assayed in the above conditions with or without 1 μg GST, GST-MYPT1, or GST-CARM1.OGT activity measurements from whole cell lysate were performed as described previously with minor modifications (19Cheung W.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13009-13020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Cell lysate was concentrated and buffer-exchanged into 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, using 30-kDa molecular mass cutoff centrifugal filter devices (Millipore). 140 μg of concentrated lysate was assayed for [3H]GlcNAc incorporation from UDP-[3H]GlcNAc into a substrate peptide derived from casein kinase II (1 mm) for 30 min at room temperature. The reactions were purified over C18 MacroSpin columns (The Nest Group) and counted by scintillation counting. O-GlcNAcase activity was assayed from whole cell lysates as described previously (19Cheung W.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol.

Error bars represent S.E.For densitometric lane profiles, the plot profile function in NIH Image v1.63 was used. The log(-fold change in O-GlcNAc over control) was calculated as follows. First, lane profiles were normalized against actin, and then the normalized lane profile for the experimental sample was divided by its paired control sample, resulting in the -fold change over control. The logarithm of the -fold change over the lane profile was taken. Values greater than 0 indicate increases over control, whereas values less than 0 indicate decreases compared with control. The plot in Fig. 5 represents the average of three independent experiments. The normal experimental deviation across control samples was measured to be ±0.05 log(-fold change) units or ∼12% and indicated on the plot by a gray bar between –0.05 and +0.05.RESULTSPutative OGT-interacting Proteins Were Identified Using a Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—To identify candidate OGT regulatory proteins, we performed a conventional yeast two-hybrid screen of a human fetal brain cDNA library using full-length OGT as bait. Using high stringency reporter selection, we were able to identify 27 putative binding partners for OGT (Table 1). In our screen, two previously known interacting partners for OGT were successfully identified, namely O-GlcNAcase (25Whisenhunt T.R. Yang X. Bowe D.B. Paterson A.J. Van Tine B.A. Kudlow J.E. Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 551-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and Trak1 (previously known as OIP106) (15Iyer S.P. Akimoto Y. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5399-5409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the proteins identified belong to a wide range of functional classes from ion transporting integral membrane proteins to signaling and transcriptional regulators.To confirm the results of the yeast two-hybrid screen, we performed co-immunoprecipitations from several of the yeast clones isolated (Fig. 1A). As expected, all of the clones tested were confirmed to interact with OGT, whereas the TD1 negative control protein did not interact with OGT (Fig. 1B). Using this assay, we were also able to detect SORBS2 as a false positive result of the screen because the size of the protein failed to match the predicted size based on the cDNA sequence of the clone.FIGURE 1Several putative OGT binding partners interact with OGT when co-expressed in yeast. A, predicted size of selected HA-GAL4 activation domain fusion proteins based on cDNA sequence. B, lysates from yeast transformed with expression plasmids encoding OGT and the indicated proteins fused to HA-GAL4 activation domain were immunoprecipitated (IP) for HA and immunoblotted (IB) for OGT and HA. * indicates a false positive result due to incorrect size of fusion protein.

MYPT1 is a known targeting regulatory subunit of PP1β (also known as PP1δ) (for a review, see Ref. 26Matsumura F. Hartshorne D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 369: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), whereas CARM1 is a known transcriptional coactivating arginine methyltransferase (for a review, see Ref. 27Stallcup M.R. Kim J.H. Teyssier C. Lee Y.H. Ma H. Chen D. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 85: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).We transfected Neuro-2a cells with plasmids expressing HA, HA-tagged MYPT1, or HA-tagged CARM1 and assayed their ability to interact with endogenously expressed OGT. Indeed both MYPT1 and CARM1 were found to co-immunoprecipitate with OGT (Fig. 2, A and B).FIGURE 2MYPT1 and CARM1 interact with OGT in Neuro-2a cells. A, lysates from Neuro-2a cells transfected with HA or HA-MYPT1 were immunoprecipitated (IP) for HA and immunoblotted (IB) for OGT, PP1β, and HA. B, lysates from Neuro-2a cells transfected with HA or HA-CARM1 were immunoprecipitated for HA and immunoblotted for OGT and HA. C, lysates from rat brain were immunoprecipitated for OGT, for MYPT1, or using normal rabbit IgG and immunoblotted for OGT and MYPT1. Data shown are representative of n ≥ 3 experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next we confirmed that MYPT1 interacts with OGT in vivo. Using OGT-specific and MYPT1-specific antibodies, we were able to co-immunoprecipitate endogenous MYPT1 with OGT from rat brain lysate (Fig. 2C).MYPT1 and CARM1 Are GlcNAcylated—Because both MYPT1 and CARM1 interact with OGT, we decided to determine whether they were substrates of OGT. Toward this end, we transfected Neuro-2a cells with plasmids expressing HA, HA-MYPT1, or HA-CARM1 and assayed their GlcNAcylation using an O-GlcNAc-specific antibody. Both MYPT1 and CARM1 are GlcNAcylated in vivo (Fig. 3, A and B).FIGURE 3MYPT1 and CARM1 are substrates of OGT in vivo and in vitro. A, lysates from Neuro-2a cells transfected with HA or HA-MYPT1 were immunoprecipitated (IP) for HA and immunoblotted (IB) for O-GlcNAc and HA. B, lysates from Neuro-2a cells transfected with HA or HA-CARM1 were immunoprecipitated for HA and immunoblotted for O-GlcNAc and HA. C, recombinant GST and GST-MYPT1 (1 μg) were assayed as substrates for recombinant ncOGT (3 μg) in the presence of UDP-[3H]GlcNAc. The right panel shows an autofluorograph of the gel stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 seen in the left panel.

Indeed both GST-tagged MYPT1 and GST-tagged CARM1, but not GST, are substrates for OGT in vitro (Fig. 3, C and D). MYPT1 appears to be a better substrate than CARM1 because there was greater [3H]GlcNAc incorporation into MYPT1 than CARM1 when both were compared with OGT.MYPT1 and CARM1 Affect OGT Substrate Specificity in Vitro—Recent experiments have suggested that OGT is targeted to its substrates by interacting or bridging proteins (14Iyer S.P.

Thus, we sought to determine whether MYPT1 or CARM1 would be able to affect the substrate selectivity of OGT. We first assayed OGT activity toward whole rat brain lysate in the presence of either GST or GST-MYPT1; however, differences were difficult to detect and quantify because of the very large number of OGT substrates (data not shown). Therefore, we undertook an approach to enrich the rat brain lysate for MYPT1-binding proteins by passing the lysate over a MYPT1 affinity column. The proteins bound to this column were eluted and subsequently tested as substrates for OGT in the presence of GST or GST-MYPT1.Indeed there are several proteins that seem to be better OGT substrates in the presence of GST-MYPT1 (Fig. 4A, arrowheads), suggesting that MYPT1 can alter OGT substrate specificity in vitro. Interestingly GST-MYPT1 itself was a better substrate for OGT in the presence of MYPT1-binding proteins, implying that there are proteins that also increase the affinity of OGT for MYPT1. We also tested to see whether MYPT1 could increase OGT activity toward purified myosin in vitro. MYPT1 had no effect on the GlcNAcylation of myosin in vitro (data not shown).FIGURE 4MYPT1 and CARM1 alter OGT substrate selectivity in vitro. A, rat brain lysate enriched over a MYPT1 column (20 μg of protein) was assayed as substrate for recombinant ncOGT (3 μg) in the presence of UDP-[3H]GlcNAc and GST or GST-MYPT1 (1 μg). The right panel shows an autofluorograph of the gel stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 seen in the left panel.

Data shown are representative of n ≥ 3 experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Next we tested whether CARM1 would function similarly in an in vitro OGT assay. However, it appears that there are only a few CARM1-binding proteins that are better OGT substrates in the presence of GST-CARM1 (Fig. 4B, arrowheads), confirming that CARM1 can alter OGT substrate specificity in vitro. Interestingly it also appears that CARM1 increases GlcNAcylation of OGT itself.MYPT1 Affects OGT Substrate Specificity in Vivo—To determine whether MYPT1 alters OGT substrate selectivity in vivo, we decided to assay the effects of RNA interference-mediated knockdown of MYPT1 on protein GlcNAcylation. Although depletion of MYPT1 in Neuro-2a cells had little effect on OGT, O-GlcNAcase, PP1β, or phosphorylated threonine levels, protein GlcNAcylation was altered significantly (Fig. 5A).

https://openalex.org/W2017180332,"Recent studies have demonstrated that RNAi is a promising approach for treating autosomal dominant disorders. However, discrimination between wild-type and mutant transcripts is essential, to preserve wild-type expression and function. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is present in more than 70% of patients with Machado-Joseph disease (MJD). We investigated whether this SNP could be used to inactivate mutant ataxin-3 selectively. Lentiviral-mediated silencing of mutant human ataxin-3 was demonstrated in vitro and in a rat model of MJD in vivo. The allele-specific silencing of ataxin-3 significantly decreased the severity of the neuropathological abnormalities associated with MJD. These data demonstrate that RNAi has potential for use in MJD treatment and constitute the first proof-of-principle for allele-specific silencing in the central nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W2093721490,"The O-GlcNAc post-translational modification is considered to act as a sensor of nutrient flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. A cornerstone of this hypothesis is that global elevation of protein O-GlcNAc levels, typically induced with the non-selective O-GlcNAcase inhibitor PUGNAc (O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glycopyranosylidene) amino-N-phenylcarbamate), causes insulin resistance in adipocytes. Here we address the potential link between elevated O-GlcNAc and insulin resistance by using a potent and selective inhibitor of O-GlcNAcase (NButGT (1,2-dideoxy-2′-propyl-α-d-glucopyranoso-[2,1-d]-Δ2′-thiazoline), 1200-fold selectivity). A comparison of the structures of a bacterial homologue of O-GlcNAcase in complex with PUGNAc or NButGT reveals that these inhibitors bind to the same region of the active site, underscoring the competitive nature of their inhibition of O-GlcNAcase and the molecular basis of selectivity. Treating 3T3-L1 adipocytes with NButGT induces rapid increases in global O-GlcNAc levels, but strikingly, NButGT treatment does not replicate the insulin desensitizing effects of the non-selective O-GlcNAcase inhibitor PUGNAc. Consistent with these observations, NButGT also does not recapitulate the impaired insulin-mediated phosphorylation of Akt that is induced by treatment with PUGNAc. Collectively, these results suggest that increases in global levels of O-GlcNAc-modified proteins of cultured adipocytes do not, on their own, cause insulin resistance.

A variety of studies using different methods have demonstrated that increased flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway causes insulin resistance in adipocytes (1.Traxinger R.R. Marshall S. J.

Housley M.P. Slawson C. Nature. 2007; 446: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Analogous to phosphorylation, residues that are modified by these 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glycopyranose (O-GlcNAc) residues can be unmasked by a glycoside hydrolase (family GH84 in the CAZy classification (9.Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 695-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar)) known as O-GlcNAcase (10.Dong D.L. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19321-19330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the addition and removal of O-GlcNAc can occur many times during the lifetime of a target protein. Indeed, proteins that are O-GlcNAc-modified have also been found in some cases to be targets of phosphorylation (8.Hart G.W. Housley M.P. Slawson C. Nature. 2007; 446: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar), implicating this modification in a variety of processes including transcriptional regulation (11.Jackson S.P. Tjian R.

A. 2002; 99: 5313-5318Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). A leading hypothesis is that O-GlcNAc, thus, serves as a key molecular sensing mechanism of increased flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway and that increased global O-GlcNAc levels may induce insulin resistance (2.Buse M.G. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 290: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 8.Hart G.W. Housley M.P. Slawson C.

First, levels of UDP-GlcNAc have been found to vary with nutrient availability (4.Hawkins M. Angelov I. Liu R. Barzilai N. Rossetti L. J. Biol.

Diabetes. 1995; 44: 1438-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), a finding that has significance for O-GlcNAc since OGT does not appear to display traditional Michaelis-Menten kinetics and responds to a wide range of UDP-GlcNAc concentrations (14.Kreppel L.K. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32015-32022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, O-GlcNAc levels vary directly with glucose availability (15.Walgren J.L. Vincent T.S. Schey K.L. Buse M.G. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol.

Very recently, it was shown that insulin stimulates OGT enzymatic activity and promotes its redistribution within 3T3-L1 adipocytes (22.Whelan S.A. Lane M.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21411-21417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In an effort to provide useful chemical tools for investigating the biological role of O-GlcNAc, we have generated selective inhibitors of O-GlcNAcase. These inhibitors include 1,2-dideoxy-2′-propyl-α-d-glucopyranoso-[2,1-d]-Δ2′-thiazoline (NButGT) (Fig. 2A), the first nanomolar inhibitor of eukaryotic O-GlcNAcases that selectively targets this enzyme over the functionally related lysosomal β-hexosaminidases (1200-fold selective at pH 6.5) (23.Macauley M.S. Whitworth G.E. Debowski A.W. Chin D. Vocadlo D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25313-25322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). This selectivity stems from the mechanism-based design of the inhibitors and structural elaboration of the thiazoline ring to increase its bulk. Indeed, glycoside hydrolase family 20 β-hexosaminidases, such as the lysosomal β-hexosaminidases, display a constrained active site structure around the 2-acetamido moiety (24.Mark B.L. Vocadlo D.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 10330-10337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), whereas GH84 O-GlcNAcases have a large pocket at this position (25.Dennis R.J. Taylor E.J. Macauley M.S. Stubbs K.A. Turkenburg J.P. Hart S.J. Black G.N. Vocadlo D.J. Davies G.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 26.Rao F.V. Dorfmueller H.C. Villa F. Allwood M. Eggleston I.M. van Aalten D.M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1569-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), revealing the structural basis for selective inhibition. As part of our ongoing research program into understanding the biological roles of O-GlcNAc, we were stimulated by existing studies, which report the insulin desensitizing effects caused by increasing global O-GlcNAc levels using the O-GlcNAcase inhibitor O-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glycopyranosylidene) amino-N-phenylcarbamate (PUGNAc) (Fig. 2B), to examine the effect of selective O-GlcNAcase inhibitors. A key motivation for us to generate selective O-GlcNAcase inhibitors was to circumvent the limitations associated with using PUGNAc. PUGNAc is a potent competitive inhibitor of O-GlcNAcase, and indeed, treating cells with this compound results in elevated O-GlcNAc levels stemming from the continuing action of OGT, while O-GlcNAcase function is hindered (27.Haltiwanger R.S. Grove K. Philipsberg G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3611-3617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). PUGNAc has, thus, been used in many studies to elevate global O-GlcNAc levels and has thereby been used to implicate O-GlcNAc as a cause of insulin resistance (12.Vosseller K. Wells L. Lane M.D. Hart G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5313-5318Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 17.Arias E.B. Kim J. Cartee G.D.

PUGNAc, however, is not a selective inhibitor. PUGNAc also inhibits the lysosomal β-hexosaminidases (23.Macauley M.S. Whitworth G.E. Debowski A.W. Chin D. Vocadlo D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25313-25322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), enzymes that cleave both GlcNAc and GalNAc from a range of glycoconjugates. PUGNAc may also have other targets. Indeed, more recently PUGNAc was also found to inhibit a homologue of the human α-N-acetylglucosaminidase involved in glycosaminoglycan degradation (29.Ficko-Blean E. Stubbs K.A. Nemirovsky O. Vocadlo D.J. Boraston A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 6560-6565Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Accordingly, because of these off target effects of PUGNAc, we felt that a more selective inhibitor of O-GlcNAcase would be a useful and welcome tool for investigating the role of O-GlcNAc in a more discriminating manner. We felt that a clear structural understanding of the similarities and differences between inhibition of O-GlcNAcase by PUGNAc and NButGT would be beneficial. Therefore, we undertook structural studies of the Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron BtGH84 N-acetylglucosaminidase in complex with PUGNAc. BtGH84 is active on O-GlcNAc-modified protein substrates, and the structure of this enzyme is known, revealing that all residues within its active site are conserved in human O-GlcNAcase (25.Dennis R.J. Taylor E.J. Macauley M.S. Stubbs K.A. Turkenburg J.P. Hart S.J. Black G.N. Vocadlo D.J. Davies G.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). BtGH84, therefore, provides a valuable model structure with which to probe the molecular basis of O-GlcNAcase inhibition. The results obtained here underscore that NButGT and PUGNAc bind to the same active site and offer a rationale for the competitive mode of inhibition by these inhibitors. The structure also reveals a number of differences in binding between these two inhibitors, clarifying the rationale for the high selectivity of NButGT and offering a clear explanation for the poor selectivity of PUGNAc. Our first step toward understanding the role of O-GlcNAc in insulin resistance was to examine the effect of selective O-GlcNAcase inhibition in 3T3-L1 adipocytes to enable investigation of the temporal relationship between O-GlcNAc levels and insulin resistance. Our findings, reported here, are surprising. We show the insulin-desensitizing effects of PUGNAc on cultured adipocytes (12.Vosseller K. Wells L. Lane M.D. Hart G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5313-5318Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), which is a cornerstone of the O-GlcNAc-insulin resistance hypothesis, are not replicated by the selective O-GlcNAcase inhibitor NButGT. This discrepancy between using the non-selective inhibitor PUGNAc and the selective O-GlcNAcase inhibitor NButGT suggests that the promiscuous inhibitory properties of PUGNAc, although not widely appreciated, are a concern. Indeed perturbations in the levels of other glycoconjugates such as N-glycans and glycosphingolipids, which are also biosynthesized from UDP-GlcNAc (Fig. 1), are known to cause insulin resistance (30.Nojiri H. Stroud M. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4531-4537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Sasaki A. Hata K. Suzuki S. Sawada M. Wada T. Yamaguchi K. Obinata M. Tateno H. Suzuki H.

These results raise some uncertainty about the interpretation of data obtained in cells using the inhibitor PUGNAc. Regardless of the interpretation of PUGNAc-derived data, the results described here collectively suggest that global increases in the levels of O-GlcNAc-modified proteins are not an independent mechanism mediating the development of insulin resistance in cultured adipocytes, although alternative interpretations are discussed. General—All solutions containing salts and buffers were made from materials obtained from Bioshop unless otherwise noted. The CTD110.6 anti-O-GlcNAc and anti-β-actin antibodies were obtained from Covance and Sigma, respectively, whereas the Akt and phospho-Akt antibodies were obtained from R&D Systems. Secondary antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. NButGT and PUGNAc were prepared as reported (23.Macauley M.S. Whitworth G.E. Debowski A.W. Chin D. Vocadlo D.J. J. Biol.

Coordinates for PUGNAc in complex with BTGH84 have been deposited with accession code 2vvs. Structure Solution and Refinement—BtGH84 was buffer exchanged into 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, and concentrated using a 10-kDa cut off concentration device to a final concentration of ∼11 mg/ml. Crystals were obtained, as described previously for the apoBtGH84 structure (25.Dennis R.J. Taylor E.J. Macauley M.S. Stubbs K.A. Turkenburg J.P. Hart S.J. Black G.N. Vocadlo D.J. Davies G.J. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Drops were formed from a 1-μl protein solution (11 mg/ml) and 1-μl reservoir solution, with streak seeding from crystals that had formed previously. The complex with PUGNAc (PDB code 2vvs) was obtained by soaking harvested (25% glycerol, 12% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.3 m ammonium acetate, 0.1 m MES, pH 6.0) crystals for ∼10 min under constant observation with minute quantities of powdered ligand surrounding individual crystals. Crystals were mounted in rayon fiber loops and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility with data processed and scaled using MOSFLM and SCALA from the CCP4 suite (34.Collaborative Computational Project Number 4. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar). Crystals of the BtGH84-PUGNAc complex are in space group C2, with cell dimensions a = 185.6 Å, b = 51.3 Å, c = 81.5 Å, and β = 97 °. There is one molecule of BtGH84 in the asymmetric unit. The structure of BtGH84 in complex with PUGNAc was solved using PHASER (35.Mccoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14567) Google Scholar) with the protein atoms only of a single molecule of apo BtGH84 as the search model (PDB code 2CHO). Manual corrections to the model were made with COOT (36.Emsley J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 1019-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) with refinement cycles incorporating translation, libration, screw-rotation corrections (37.Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N.

Water molecules and ligand were added using COOT with stereochemical target values for the ligand based upon ideal coordinates generated with QUANTA (Accelrys, San Diego Ca). The BtGH84 protein model was built from residue Leu-5 to Pro-592 (except the loop Ser-46—Lys-53). The mobile C-terminal domain (His-593—Lys-716) could not be traced due to poor electron density.

All cells were grown in an incubator with 5% CO2 at a temperature of 37 °C. Preadipocytes were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 10% bovine serum (Invitrogen). Two days post-confluence differentiation was initiated by replacing the media with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 120 μg/ml isobutylmethylxanthine (Sigma), 0.4 μg/ml dexamethasone (Sigma), and 1 μg/ml recombinant human insulin (Lilly). Cells were kept in this differentiation medium for 2 days, and then the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and further replaced every 2 days after that. Cells were used 10–12 days after differentiation was initiated at a time when >95% of cells displayed characteristic features of adipocytes. Western Blotting—The procedure was similar to that described previously (23.Macauley M.S. Whitworth G.E. Debowski A.W. Chin D. Vocadlo D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25313-25322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes in 6-well plates were treated with either varying doses of PUGNAc or NButGT for varying times. Cells were harvested by adding 400 μl of 1% SDS containing 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, boiling for 10 min, and using these lysates in subsequent Western blots. Briefly, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% gels), transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad), blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T), and then subsequently probed with the appropriate primary antibody delivered in 1% BSA in PBS-T overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were then extensively washed with PBS-T, blocked again for 30 min with 1% BSA in PBS-T at room temperature, and then probed with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature delivered in 1% BSA in PBS-T. Finally, the membranes were washed extensively and then developed with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). 2-Deoxyglucose (2-DOG) Uptake—All assays took place in 12-well plates (Falcon) with a minimum of six replicates. Cells were treated with PUGNAc or NButGT for 16 h before the start of the protocol at a concentration of 100 μm. Cells were first washed twice with DMEM containing 5 mm glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.5% BSA (Sigma) and then incubated in this media for 2 h. During this 2-h incubation period, PUGNAc or NButGT was maintained at the same concentration as overnight. Cells were then washed twice in KRP buffer (126 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4, 0.9 mm MgCl2, 0.9 mm CaCl2, 0.5% BSA, pH 7.4) and incubated in 420 μl of this buffer for 15 min. Subsequently, 30 μl of insulin (Lilly) was added directly to the cultures to yield the required insulin concentration, as required. Also, at this time cytochalasin B (Sigma) was added to some wells to give a concentration of 10 μm to control for glucose transporter-independent uptake. The cells were incubated for another 15 min, and then uptake assays were initiated by the addition of 50 μl of 2-DOG such that the cultures had a final concentration of 100 μm of 2-DOG and a specific activity of 0.5 μCi/ml. After 6 min the uptake was terminated by extensive washing in ice-cold PBS. PBS containing 2% Triton X-100 (500 μl) was then added to each well, and 300 μl from each well was used for scintillation counting. Additional 2-DOG uptake assays were carried out using cells treated with 100 μm NButGT or with vehicle (PBS) alone as described above except that the concentration of insulin was varied from between 0.1 to 10 nm. As well, studies were carried out to evaluate the effect of varying the length of 2-DOG uptake time from 2.5 to 12 min. Last, the concentration of 2-DOG was varied from 0.03 to 10 mm to evaluate the kinetic behavior of 2-DOG transport in cells treated with 100 μm NButGT overnight as compared with control cells. Analysis of Phospho-Akt Levels—All assays took place in 6-well plates (Falcon) with two replicates. Experiments were also repeated in a second independent trial. Cells were treated with PUGNAc or NButGT for 16 h before the start of the protocol at a concentration of 100 μm. Cells were first washed twice with DMEM containing 5 mm glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.5% BSA and then incubated in this media for 2 h. During this 2-h incubation period, PUGNAc or NButGT was maintained at the same concentration as overnight. Cells were then washed twice in KRP buffer (126 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4, 0.9 mm MgCl2, 0.9 mm CaCl2, 0.5% BSA, pH 7.4) and incubated in this buffer for 15 min. Subsequently, the appropriate amount of insulin (0 or 10 nm final concentration) was added directly. The cells were incubated for another 15 min and harvested by adding 400 μl of 1% SDS containing 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, boiling this for 10 min, and then analyzing these lysates via Western blots. Densitometry was carried out using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). The global elevation of O-GlcNAc levels by PUGNAc forms a cornerstone in the link between global O-GlcNAc levels and insulin resistance and has stimulated considerable efforts in the area (2.Buse M.G. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 290: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 8.Hart G.W. Housley M.P. Slawson C. Nature. 2007; 446: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). Previous studies relying on PUGNAc to elevate O-GlcNAc levels have proposed that elevation of global levels of O-GlcNAc-modified proteins causes insulin resistance in cultured adipocytes (12.Vosseller K.

Diabetes. 2004; 53: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). One interesting study by Robinson et al. (39.Robinson K.A. Ball L.E. Buse M.G. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 292: 884-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) that is not entirely consistent with the studies making use of PUGNAc showed that a reduction in the levels of O-GlcNAc-modified proteins in 3T3-L1 adipocytes using either OGT knockdown or overexpression of O-GlcNAcase does not relieve the insulin resistance caused by culturing these cells in media containing high glucose. On the basis of these collective observations, we were interested in both revisiting the effects of inhibition of O-GlcNAcase on insulin resistance in 3T3-L1 cells and then examining the temporal relationship between O-GlcNAc levels and insulin resistance. One limitation of earlier studies linking global O-GlcNAc levels and insulin resistance is the reliance on the inhibitor PUGNAc as it was unknown at that time that PUGNAc was not selective for O-GlcNAcase. PUGNAc (Fig. 2B) is the most widely used inhibitor of O-GlcNAcase; however, this molecule has been recently shown to potently inhibit human lysosomal β-hexosaminidase (KI = 36 nm) (23.Macauley M.S.

One concern about this promiscuity is that inactivation of lysosomal β-hexosaminidases is known to result in the accumulation of gangliosides, which themselves are implicated in the development of insulin resistance (30.Nojiri H.

https://openalex.org/W2104715883,"The serine and arginine-rich protein family (SR proteins) are highly conserved regulators of pre-mRNA splicing. SF2/ASF, a prototype member of the SR protein family, is a multifunctional RNA binding protein with roles in pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA export and mRNA translation. These observations suggest the intriguing hypothesis that SF2/ASF may couple splicing and translation of specific mRNA targets in vivo. Unfortunately the paucity of endogenous mRNA targets for SF2/ASF has hindered testing of this hypothesis. Here, we identify endogenous mRNAs directly cross-linked to SF2/ASF in different sub-cellular compartments. Cross-Linking Immunoprecipitation (CLIP) captures the in situ specificity of protein-RNA interaction and allows for the simultaneous identification of endogenous RNA targets as well as the locations of binding sites within the RNA transcript. Using the CLIP method we identified 326 binding sites for SF2/ASF in RNA transcripts from 180 protein coding genes. A purine-rich consensus motif was identified in binding sites located within exon sequences but not introns. Furthermore, 72 binding sites were occupied by SF2/ASF in different sub-cellular fractions suggesting that these binding sites may influence the splicing or translational control of endogenous mRNA targets. We demonstrate that ectopic expression of SF2/ASF regulates the splicing and polysome association of transcripts derived from the SFRS1, PABC1, NETO2 and ENSA genes. Taken together the data presented here indicate that SF2/ASF has the capacity to co-regulate the nuclear and cytoplasmic processing of specific mRNAs and provide further evidence that the nuclear history of an mRNA may influence its cytoplasmic fate."
https://openalex.org/W2124390687,"Background Population densities of many species throughout the world are changing due to direct persecution as well as anthropogenic habitat modification. These changes may induce or increase the frequency of hybridization among taxa. If extensive, hybridization can threaten the genetic integrity or survival of endangered species. Three native species of the genus Canis, coyote (C. latrans), Mexican wolf (C. lupus baileyi) and red wolf (C. rufus), were historically sympatric in Texas, United States. Human impacts caused the latter two to go extinct in the wild, although they survived in captive breeding programs. Morphological data demonstrate historic reproductive isolation between all three taxa. While the red wolf population was impacted by introgressive hybridization with coyotes as it went extinct in the wild, the impact of hybridization on the Texas populations of the other species is not clear. Methodology/ Principal Findings We surveyed variation at maternally and paternally inherited genetic markers (mitochondrial control region sequence and Y chromosome microsatellites) in coyotes from Texas, Mexican wolves and red wolves from the captive breeding programs, and a reference population of coyotes from outside the historic red wolf range. Levels of variation and phylogenetic analyses suggest that hybridization has occasionally taken place between all three species, but that the impact on the coyote population is very small. Conclusion/Significance Our results demonstrate that the factors driving introgressive hybridization in sympatric Texan Canis are multiple and complex. Hybridization is not solely determined by body size or sex, and density-dependent effects do not fully explain the observed pattern either. No evidence of hybridization was identified in the Mexican wolf captive breeding program, but introgression appears to have had a greater impact on the captive red wolves."
https://openalex.org/W2036796490,"Modification of histone proteins by lysine methylation is a principal chromatin regulatory mechanism (Shi, Y., and Whetstine, J. R. (2007) Mol. Cell 25, 1–14). Recently, lysine methylation has been shown also to play a role in regulating non-histone proteins, including the tumor suppressor protein p53 (Huang, J., and Berger, S. L. (2008) Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 18, 152–158). Here, we identify a novel p53 species that is dimethylated at lysine 382 (p53K382me2) and show that the tandem Tudor domain of the DNA damage response mediator 53BP1 acts as an “effector” for this mark. We demonstrate that the 53BP1 tandem Tudor domain recognizes p53K382me2 with a selectivity relative to several other protein lysine methylation sites and saturation states. p53K382me2 levels increase with DNA damage, and recognition of this modification by 53BP1 facilitates an interaction between p53 and 53BP1. The generation of p53K382me2 promotes the accumulation of p53 protein that occurs upon DNA damage, and this increase in p53 levels requires 53BP1. Taken together, our study identifies a novel p53 modification, demonstrates a new effector function for the 53BP1 tandem Tudor domain, and provides insight into how DNA damage signals are transduced to stabilize p53.

We demonstrate that the 53BP1 tandem Tudor domain recognizes p53K382me2 with a selectivity relative to several other protein lysine methylation sites and saturation states. p53K382me2 levels increase with DNA damage, and recognition of this modification by 53BP1 facilitates an interaction between p53 and 53BP1. The generation of p53K382me2 promotes the accumulation of p53 protein that occurs upon DNA damage, and this increase in p53 levels requires 53BP1. Taken together, our study identifies a novel p53 modification, demonstrates a new effector function for the 53BP1 tandem Tudor domain, and provides insight into how DNA damage signals are transduced to stabilize p53. Lysine methylation is a principal mechanism involved in chromatin regulation via modification of histone proteins (1.Shi Y. Whetstine J.R. Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 1-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Recently, lysine methylation has been shown to regulate non-histone proteins, including the tumor suppressor p53 (2.Huang J. Berger S.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2008; 18: 152-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). p53 plays a central role in directing cellular responses to DNA damage, including the most dangerous DNA lesion, double strand breaks (DSBs) 3The abbreviations used are: DSB, double strand break; 53BP1(TD), 53BP1 tandem Tudor domain; NCS, neocarzinostatin; siRNA, short interfering RNA; IP, immunoprecipitate; GST, glutathione S-transferase. (3.Gottifredi V. Shieh S.Y. Prives C. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2000; 65: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A complex network of p53 posttranslational modifications aids in the coordination of these activities (4.Appella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2764-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Three different lysine residues present within the C-terminal regulatory region of p53 are validated as sites of lysine methylation (5.Chuikov S. Kurash J.K. Wilson J.R. Xiao B. Justin N. Ivanov G.S.

Each of these methylation events either stimulates or represses p53 transcriptional activity, yet with multiple additional lysines in the C terminus of p53 as potential methylation sites, and possible mono-, di-, and trimethylation states, the role of methylation in regulation of p53 and the molecular mechanisms linking different p53 methylation events to biological outcomes are just beginning to be understood. 53BP1 (p53-binding protein 1) is a key mediator of the cell's response to DSBs (9.Adams M.M. Carpenter P.B. Cell Div. 2006; 1: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Upon the induction of DSB lesions, 53BP1 rapidly relocates to the sites of breaks and is believed to promote the stabilization of additional DNA damage response factors at DSBs (9.Adams M.M. Carpenter P.B. Cell Div. 2006; 1: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The recognition of histone H4 dimethylated at lysine 20 (H4K20me2) by the 53BP1(TD) has been shown to be important for 53BP1 localization to DSBs: linking chromatin structure, lysine methylation, and DSB signaling (10.Botuyan M.V. Lee J. Ward I.M. Kim J.E. Thompson J.R. Chen J. Mer G. Cell. 2006; 127: 1361-1373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). 53BP1 might also have roles in transcription regulation. For example, a recent study reported that 53BP1 recognizes p53 dimethylated at lysine 370 through its Tudor domain and modulates p53 transactivation at several target genes (7.Huang J. Sengupta R. Espejo A.B. Lee M.G. Dorsey J.A. Richter M. Opravil S. Shiekhattar R. Bedford M.T. Jenuwein T. Berger S.L. Nature. 2007; 449: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Here, we identify a number of novel lysine methylated p53 species and provide the first direct evidence of endogenous p53 dimethylated at lysine 382. We show that p53K382me2 is a DNA damage-associated species and that through its recognition by the 53BP1(TD), it is important for regulating a modular and DNA damage-dependent interaction between p53 and 53BP1. This interaction facilitates p53 stabilization in response to DSBs, suggesting that one mechanism by which DSB signals are transduced to activate p53 is via posttranslational modification of p53 by lysine methylation. Constructs and Reagents—Human 53BP1 cDNA and hemagglutinin-53BP1 constructs were gifts from Jiri Lukas and Phillip Carpenter, respectively. The 53BP1 tandem Tudor domain and mutants were cloned and generated in pGEX vectors; SET8(Y334F) was generated in pcDNA and pGEX vectors using PCR mutagenesis (Stratagene). Primer sequences are available upon request. The p53K382me2 antibody was generated in rabbits immunized with the peptide 377TSRHKK(me2)LMFKT387, purified over a SulfoLink Coupling Gel (Pierce) coupled to the p53K382me2 peptide, and depleted with recombinant wild-type GST-p53. Other antibodies used in this study include horseradish peroxidase-p53 (R&D Systems); p53 (DO1; Calbiochem); SET8 (Abcam); 53BP1, mouse monoclonal (Upstate) and rabbit polyclonal (Bethyl Laboratories); FLAG (M2); and tubulin (Sigma). p53 peptides bearing different modifications were synthesized at the W. M. Keck Facility at Yale University. Protein Purification and Mass Spectrometry—Nuclear extracts were prepared from HeLa cells ± doxorubicin treatment (0.5 μg/ml for 4 h) as previously described (8.Shi X. Kachirskaia I. Yamaguchi H. West L.E. Wen H. Wang E.W. Dutta S. Appella E. Gozani O. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 636-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). To immunoprecipitate endogenous p53 proteins, ∼10 mg of nuclear extracts were incubated overnight with 50 μl of DO1-conjugated agarose in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors with gentle rotation at 4 °C. The beads were washed two times with the same buffer, two times with high salt buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA), once with LiCl buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA), and once with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. The p53 protein bound to the beads was subjected to SDS-PAGE, excised from the gels, and incubated with trypsin overnight at 37 °C. Pooled supernatants containing extracted peptides were dried and resuspended in 30% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid prior to mass spectrometry analysis. Samples were analyzed on a reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MALDI TOF instrument, Ultraflex, Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) equipped with a 337-nm nitrogen laser and delayed ion extraction capability (delay times, 30–50 ns). Ion structure information was obtained by post-source decay, using the mass gate feature, to select a specific m/z window for fragmentation. The mass gate resolution was 1% of the precursor mass. Data were recorded in both positive and negative ion modes at 20-kV acceleration, and mass analysis of ions was performed using a dual micro-channel plate detector. Detector output was collected with a 1-GHz digitizer and displayed directly on a Windows NT-based computer. Ten positive ion reflectron time-of-flight mass spectra of 1000 laser shots were accumulated and externally calibrated with commercial peptide mix (Bruker Daltonics). For analysis of in vitro methylated synthetic peptides, the synthetic peptides, untreated and treated with SET8, were equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 50% acetonitrile with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and applied to the MALDI target plate with equal volumes of the matrix α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma). Peptide Pulldown Assays—Peptide pulldown assays were performed as previously described (11.Shi X. Hong T. Walter K.L. Ewalt M. Michishita E. Hung T. Carney D. Pena P. Lan F. Kaadige M.R. Lacoste N. Cayrou C. Davrazou F. Saha A. Cairns B.R. Ayer D.E. Kutateladze T.G. Shi Y. Cote J. Chua K.F. Gozani O. Nature. 2006; 442: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μg of biotinylated peptides was incubated with 1 μg of protein in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors) for 4 h at 4 °C with rotation. After a 1-h incubation with streptavidin beads (Amersham Biosciences) and extensive washing, bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Histone Methyltransferase Assay—Methyltransferase assays were performed as previously described (8.Shi X. Kachirskaia I. Yamaguchi H. West L.E. Wen H. Wang E.W. Dutta S. Appella E. Gozani O. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 636-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μgof GST-p53 or 1 μg of p53 peptides was incubated with 1 μgof recombinant histone methyltransferase and 2 μCi of S-adenosylmethionine (Amersham Biosciences) in reaction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 20 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 30 °C for 30 min to 2 h. The reaction mixtures were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by either radiography or Western analysis. The reactions with peptides were subjected to mass spectrometry analysis. Cell Culture and Transfections—U2OS, H1299, and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected with plasmids or siRNA duplexes by TransIT-LT1 (or TransIT-293) (Mirus) or DharmaFECT (Dharmacon), respectively, according to the manufacturers' protocols. Knockdown of 53BP1—100 nm control or 53BP1 siRNAs was transfected into U2OS cells using DharmaFECT4 transfection reagent (Dharmacon) for 48–96 h before treatments. siRNA target sequences for 53BP1 are 5′-GAGCUGGGAAGUAUAAAUUUU-3′ and 5′-GGACUCCAGUGUUGUCAUUUU-3′. On-target plus siControl siRNA (5′-UGGUUUACAUGUCGACUAA-3′, Dharmacon) and on-target plus SMARTpool siControl siRNA (Dharmacon) were used as controls. Immunoprecipitation and Western Immunoblotting—Endogenous p53 or ectopically expressed FLAG-tagged p53 were immunoprecipitated with agarose-conjugated p53 or FLAG antibodies from whole cell extracts in cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors). After an overnight incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed three times with the same buffer and boiled in 2× Laemmli buffer. The IP was resolved on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and detected by αp53K382me2 and α53BP1 antibodies, or horseradish peroxidase-αp53 to avoid cross-reactivity with IgG heavy chain. Reverse Transcription-PCR and Real-time PCR—Reverse transcription-PCR and real-time PCR were performed as previously described (8.Shi X. Kachirskaia I. Yamaguchi H. West L.E. Wen H. Wang E.W. Dutta S. Appella E. Gozani O. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 636-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). mRNA was prepared using an RNeasy Plus kit (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed using a First Strand Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR was performed on the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression was calculated and normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase levels by the comparative Cycle threshold method. p53 Is Dimethylated at Lysine 382 in Vivo—To search for novel p53 methylation marks, we performed a mass spectrometry analysis of endogenous p53 purified from HeLa nuclear extracts ± DNA damage (Fig. 1a; supplemental Fig. 1; see “Materials and Methods”). In both samples, we identified three peaks representing the digested peptide product containing lysine 382 (K(382)LMFK) that either was unmodified or was shifted by a mass that corresponds to one and two methyl moieties (Fig. 1a). We have previously reported the second peak as the monomethylated species, K(382me1)LMFK (8.Shi X. Kachirskaia I. Yamaguchi H. West L.E. Wen H. Wang E.W. Dutta S. Appella E. Gozani O. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 636-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The identity of the third peak was confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry to represent dimethylated Lys382 species. These data demonstrate that endogenous p53 is dimethylated at lysine 382 (p53K382me2). We also identified p53 peptides in the digests that contain lysine mono- and dimethylation events (supplemental Fig. 1). Specifically, we have evidence for two novel methylated p53 species, K386me1 and K386me2, as well as potentially confirm by mass spectrometry the previously reported K370me2 species (6.Huang J. Perez-Burgos L. Placek B.J. Sengupta R. Richter M. Dorsey J.A. Kubicek S. Opravil S. Jenuwein T. Berger S.L. Nature. 2006; 444: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 7.Huang J. Sengupta R. Espejo A.B. Lee M.G. Dorsey J.A. Richter M. Opravil S. Shiekhattar R. Bedford M.T. Jenuwein T. Berger S.L. Nature. 2007; 449: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). p53K382me2 Is a High-affinity Ligand for 53BP1 Tudor Domain in Vitro—The amino acid sequence surrounding p53K382 is highly homologous to that of histone H4K20 (Fig. 1b). 53BP1(TD) binds to H4K20me2 via the formation of contacts with the sequence HRKme2 (10.Botuyan M.V. Lee J. Ward I.M. Kim J.E. Thompson J.R. Chen J. Mer G. Cell. 2006; 127: 1361-1373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that 53BP1(TD) might likewise recognize p53K382me2 through the similar sequence HKKme2. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1c, in in vitro binding assays, recombinant 53BP1(TD) preferentially bound p53K382me2 peptides versus other p53K382 methylation states. Furthermore, the binding affinity of 53BP1(TD) for p53K382me2 was moderately stronger than that observed for H4K20me2 and p53K370me2 (15.5 μm versus 27.2 and 27.0 μm, respectively), as well as multiple other histone lysine dimethylation sites and potential or reported p53 dimethylation sites (Fig. 1, c–g). Many other methyllysine effector domains, including numerous plant homeodomain fingers and chromodomains, do not bind to p53K382me2 (data not shown). Thus, in vitro, p53K382me2 is a novel and high-affinity binding ligand for the tandem Tudor domain of 53BP1. Generation of p53K382me2 in Vitro and in Vivo—Next, a site-specific polyclonal antibody recognizing p53K382me2 was raised. This antibody is specific for dimethylated p53K382me2 and does not recognize unmethylated, monomethylated, or trimethylated p53K382 (Fig. 2a), several additional p53 dimethylation sites (Fig. 2b), and H4K20me2 (supplemental Fig. 2). We have not yet identified the enzyme that generates p53K382me2, despite testing more than 30 lysine methyltransferase enzymes (data not shown). Therefore, to investigate the biological role of p53K382me2, we established a system to generate this species in vitro and in vivo. SET8/PR-Set7 adds a single methyl moiety to H4K20 (12.Fang J. Feng Q. Ketel C.S. Wang H. Cao R. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Simon J.A. Zhang Y. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1086-1099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 13.Nishioka K. Rice J.C. Sarma K. Erdjument-Bromage H. Werner J. Wang Y. Chuikov S. Valenzuela P.

Reinberg D. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2225-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) as well as p53K382 (8.Shi X. Kachirskaia I. Yamaguchi H. West L.E. Wen H. Wang E.W. Dutta S. Appella E. Gozani O. Mol. Cell. 2007; 27: 636-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Substitution of Tyr334 with Phe within SET8 (SET8(Y334F)) converts its product specificity with respect to H4K20 from a strict monomethyltransferase to a mono- and dimethyltransferase (15.Couture J.F. Collazo E. Brunzelle J.S. Trievel R.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1455-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Accordingly, incubation of a p53 peptide encompassing Lys382 (amino acids 367–389) with recombinant SET8(Y334F) generated mono- and dimethylation at p53K382 (Fig. 2c; data not shown). We confirmed that SET8(Y334F) dimethylated p53K382 in the context of recombinant full-length p53 in vitro (Fig. 2d) and validated its activity in cells on endogenous p53 (Fig. 2e). Thus, the SET8(Y334F) enzyme provides a tool for modulation of p53K382 dimethylation levels in vitro and in cells. Methylation of p53K382 Modulates Interaction between p53 and 53BP1—53BP1 was originally identified in a two-hybrid screen as a p53-interacting protein (16.Iwabuchi K. Bartel P.L. Li B. Marraccino R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6098-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the 53BP1 BRCT tandem repeats were shown to bind the DNA-binding domain of p53, although the physiologic context in which this interaction functions remains elusive (9.Adams M.M. Carpenter P.B. Cell Div. 2006; 1: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To determine whether 53BP1(TD) recognition of p53K382me2 can augment the base-line p53-53BP1 interaction, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. As shown in Fig. 3a, the ability of FLAG-p53 to co-immunoprecipitate hemagglutinin-53BP1 was enhanced when levels of p53 dimethylation at p53K382 were increased via co-expression with SET8(Y334F). Substitution of p53K382 with Arg abolished this SET8(Y334F)-mediated increase, whereas the corresponding substitution at p53K372 did not (Fig. 3b). Thus, the enhanced interaction of p53 with 53BP1 following p53 dimethylation by SET8(Y334F) specifically requires Lys382. We note that the affinity of 53BP1(TD) for p53K382me1 is 10-fold lower than for p53K382me2 (Fig. 1g), and therefore it is unlikely that the generation of this species by SET8(Y334F) has a major impact on the p53–53BP1 interaction. Key Residues within 53BP1 Tudor Domain Are Required for Binding Methylated p53—Due to homology in the amino acid sequence surrounding p53K382 and H4K20, we turned to the crystal structure of the 53BP1(TD)-H4K20me2 peptide complex to obtain insight into the molecular basis of p53K382me2-recognition by the 53BP1(TD) (see Fig. 1b) (10.Botuyan M.V. Lee J. Ward I.M. Kim J.E. Thompson J.R. Chen J. Mer G. Cell. 2006; 127: 1361-1373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Mutation of residues within the first Tudor domain of the 53BP1(TD) that constitute the binding cage accommodating the dimethyllysine of H4K20 (W1495A, Y1502L, D1521A), as well as the residues that contact a histidine residue two amino acids N-terminal of the methylated lysine (L1547A, M1584A), abolished or severely compromised the interaction with p53K382me2 (Fig. 3c) (10.Botuyan M.V. Lee J. Ward I.M. Kim J.E. Thompson J.R. Chen J. Mer G. Cell. 2006; 127: 1361-1373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). An intact 53BP1(TD) is critical for optimal binding to Lys382-methylated p53 in the context of full-length 53BP1, as introduction of a mutation within the methyllysine binding pocket of 53BP1 (W1495A) impaired its ability to be co-immunoprecipitated with p53 (Fig. 3d). Previous structural analysis of the 53BP1(TD) verified that these mutations do not disrupt folding (10.Botuyan M.V. Lee J. Ward I.M. Kim J.E. Thompson J.R. Chen J. Mer G. Cell. 2006; 127: 1361-1373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 17.Huyen Y. Zgheib O. Ditullio Jr., R.A. Gorgoulis V.G. Zacharatos P. Petty T.J. Sheston E.A. Mellert H.S. Stavridi E.S. Halazonetis T.D. Nature. 2004; 432: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that recognition of p53K382me2 by the tandem Tudor domain of 53BP1 can modulate the p53-53BP1 interaction in cells. Interaction between Endogenous p53 and 53BP1 Increases with DNA Damage—Both p53 and 53BP1 are key mediators of cellular responses to DSBs (9.Adams M.M. Carpenter P.B. Cell Div. 2006; 1: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that p53K382me2 generation, as well as the p53K382me2-53BP1(TD) interaction, might be linked to genotoxic stress. Consistent with this notion, in U2OS cells the endogenous levels of p53K382me2 increased in response to the DSB-inducing drug neocarzinostatin (NCS) relative to control treatment (Fig. 3e). To determine whether the endogenous interaction of p53 and 53BP1 paralleled the DNA damage-dependent increase in p53K382me2, p53 immunoprecipitations were performed from U2OS cells with and without NCS treatment. In the absence of DNA damage, little endogenous 53BP1 was present in the p53 IP, but after DNA damage, 53BP1 was readily detected co-immunoprecipitating with p53 (Fig. 3f, compare lanes 1 and 3). Moreover, this DNA damage-dependent interaction was augmented by expression of SET8(Y334F) (Fig. 3f, compare lanes 3 and 4). Thus, endogenous p53K382me2 levels increase with DNA damage and possibly augment the physiologic interaction between p53 and 53BP1. Role for p53K382me2-53BP1 Interaction in Mediating p53 Stability upon DNA Damage—To dissect potential roles for p53K382me2 and p53K382me2-53BP1 interactions in DNA damage responses, we first asked whether 53BP1 acts as a transcriptional co-activator of p53. Treatment of U2OS cells with siRNA targeting 53BP1 (Fig. 4a) did not decrease DNA damage-dependent induction of p21 or a number of additional p53 target genes (Fig. 4b; supplemental Fig. 3; data not shown). These results suggest that the 53BP1-p53K382me2 interaction likely modulates a p53 function distinct from its transactivation activity. Regulation of p53 protein levels is critical for proper p53-mediated responses. The stability of p53 was previously shown to be compromised in 53BP1 knockdown cells (18.Wang B. Matsuoka S. Carpenter P.B. Elledge S.J. Science. 2002; 298: 1435-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), and 53BP1 was identified in an RNA interference-based screen as a gene necessary for the toxicity associated with the MDM2-inhibitor Nutlin-3 (19.Brummelkamp T.R. Fabius A.W. Mullenders J. Madiredjo M. Velds A. Kerkhoven R.M. Bernards R. Beijersbergen R.L. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). We therefore postulated that recognition of p53K382me2 by the Tudor domain of 53BP1 might positively regulate the accumulation of p53 protein that accompanies DSB lesion formation. To investigate this possibility, total p53 protein levels present in U2OS cells were determined at base line and in response to NCS treatment, under conditions in which p53K382me2 levels were normal or elevated, respectively. We observed that expression of SET8(Y334F) increased p53 protein levels relative to control at both base line and under genotoxic stress conditions (Fig. 4c). This increase was not due to enhanced p53 mRNA synthesis; rather, SET8(Y334F) elicited a small decrease in p53 mRNA levels relative to control (Fig. 4d). Next, we tested the role of 53BP1 in SET8(Y334F)-mediated augmentation of p53 protein levels. Consistent with previous studies, depletion of 53BP1 by siRNA led to a decrease in p53 protein levels (Fig. 4e, compare lanes 2 and 6) (19.Brummelkamp T.R. Fabius A.W. Mullenders J. Madiredjo M. Velds A. Kerkhoven R.M. Bernards R. Beijersbergen R.L. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although SET8(Y334F) expression increased p53 protein levels in control siRNA-treated cells, it failed to do so in cells lacking 53BP1 (Fig. 4e, compare lanes 4 and 8). Notably, no decrease in p53 mRNA levels was observed in 53BP1 knockdown cells (supplemental Fig. 4). In addition, under conditions in which the proteasome is inhibited, cells lacking 53BP1 have equivalent p53 protein levels relative to control cells (data not shown). Taken together, our data argue that 53BP1 recognition of p53K382me2 plays a role in regulating p53 protein accumulation in response to DNA damage. In summary, we have identified a novel DNA damage-associated p53 species that is dimethylated at Lys382. This modification is recognized by the tandem Tudor domain of 53BP1, and the interaction may promote stabilization of p53. Homo-oligomerization of 53BP1 is important for its DNA repair activity; we propose that this allows 53BP1 to serve as an adaptor at DSB sites, with one 53BP1 molecule bound to H4K20me2 and a paired second 53BP1 molecule free to dock dimethylated p53 or potentially other methylated nuclear proteins (supplemental Fig. 5) (9.Adams M.M. Carpenter P.B. Cell Div. 2006; 1: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The DNA damage-triggered rapid accumulation of 53BP1 at DSB sites, in conjunction with the assembly of additional p53 regulatory factors such as ATM and Chk2, may cooperate to create a high-affinity site for p53. We hypothesize that this can facilitate accumulation of p53 by sequestering it away from proteins that target it for degradation as well as promoting p53-activating posttranslational modifications. In this context, there is evidence that p53 localizes to sites of double strand breaks (20.Al Rashid S.T. Dellaire G. Cuddihy A. Jalali F. Vaid M. Coackley C. Folkard M. Xu Y. Chen B.P. Chen D.J. Lilge L. Prise K.M. Bazett Jones D.P. Bristow R.G. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10810-10821Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We have also observed increased occupancy of p53 at a defined DSB (data not shown). The identification of the lysine methyltransferase that generates p53K382me2 will greatly facilitate the uncovering of the molecular function(s) associated with this DNA damage-linked mark. In our purification of endogenous p53, we identified potentially three p53 methylated species in addition to p53K382me2: p53K370me2, p53K386me1, and p53K386me2 (supplemental Fig. 1). The function of K386 mono- and dimethylation is unknown, and we have not confirmed their existence by independent methods or identified a lysine methyltransferase enzyme that acts on this residue (data not shown). The existence of p53K370me2 has been demonstrated by the use of state-specific antibodies (7.Huang J. Sengupta R. Espejo A.B. Lee M.G. Dorsey J.A. Richter M. Opravil S. Shiekhattar R. Bedford M.T. Jenuwein T. Berger S.L. Nature. 2007; 449: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). In this study, removal of the p53K370me2 mark by the lysine demethylase LSD1 was shown to repress p53 transactivation by preventing the interaction between p53 and 53BP1, which was shown to be critically dependent on 53BP1(TD) recognition of p53K370me2. Here, we also found that the 53BP1(TD) binds to p53K370me2, albeit with slightly lower affinity than p53K382me2 (see Fig. 1). Indeed, we observe binding of the 53BP1(TD) to several dimethylated p53 peptides, suggesting that many different lysine dimethylation events on p53 can potentially promote a modular protein-protein interaction between p53 and 53BP1. In the case of p53K370me2, recognition of 53BP1 was shown to be required for transcriptional activation by p53 of its target genes (7.Huang J. Sengupta R. Espejo A.B. Lee M.G. Dorsey J.A. Richter M. Opravil S. Shiekhattar R. Bedford M.T. Jenuwein T. Berger S.L. Nature. 2007; 449: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). In contrast, binding to p53K382me2 by 53BP1 does not appear to play a role in p53 transactivation (Fig. 4). How the recognition of different methylation events on p53 by the same effector protein (53BP1) can result in alternative physiologic outcomes remains an open question. On the basis of the many different potential methylation sites on p53 and the observation that at least two different 53BP1 recognition events can lead to different physiologic outcomes, we propose that lysine methylation-mediated funneling of p53 to particular functions likely depends on additional modifications and binding partners that co-occur with one modification (e.g. K382me2) versus another (e.g. K370me2). Taken together, our study sheds light on potential molecular mechanisms by which DSB signals are transduced to activate p53 and begins to dissect how lysine dimethylation contributes to a p53 posttranslational code that modulates distinct p53 functions. Last, our study highlights the notion that lysine methylation on non-histone proteins is likely a general molecular paradigm utilized to regulate diverse nuclear processes. We thank P.

https://openalex.org/W2030877902,"Post-translational modification by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins has been implicated in the regulation of a variety of cellular events. The functions of sumoylation are often mediated by downstream effector proteins harboring SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs) that are composed of a hydrophobic core and a stretch of acidic residues. MBD1-containing chromatin-associated factor 1 (MCAF1), a transcription repressor, interacts with SUMO-2/3 and SUMO-1, with a preference for SUMO-2/3. We used NMR spectroscopy to solve the solution structure of the SIM of MCAF1 bound to SUMO-3. The hydrophobic core of the SIM forms a parallel β-sheet pairing with strand β2 of SUMO-3, whereas its C-terminal acidic stretch seems to mediate electrostatic interactions with a surface area formed by basic residues of SUMO-3. The significance of these electrostatic interactions was shown by mutations of both SUMO-3 and MCAF1. The present structural and biochemical data suggest that the acidic stretch of the SIM of MCAF1 plays an important role in the binding to SUMO-3.

In contrast to ubiquitination, which is largely involved in regulating the degradation of target proteins by proteasomes or lysosomes (6Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar), sumoylation appears to regulate a wide variety of cellular events, such as nuclear transport, subnuclear localization, transcriptional regulation, DNA repair, and chromosome segregation (3Gill G. Genes & Dev. 2004; 18: 2046-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). In particular, sumoylation of transcription factors represses transcription through a variety of different mechanisms, such as recruitment of histone deacetylases and regulation of nuclear body components (7Shin J. Choi E. Kim H. Ho J. Watts F. Park S. Jang Y. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 817-828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that sumoylation generally regulates the functions of target proteins by modulating their protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions. small ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO-interacting motif thymine DNA glycosylase glutathione S-transferase nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy isothermal titration calorimetry root mean square deviation MBD1-containing chromatin-associated factor 1 In mammals, four SUMO paralogues, SUMO-1 through SUMO-4, have been identified, of which SUMO-1 to -3 can serve as protein modifiers (8Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Whereas SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 share 97! amino acid identity, they have only 48 and 46! identity with SUMO-1, respectively. This indicates that SUMO-2 and SUMO-3 constitute a subgroup that is distinct from SUMO-1. Although these SUMO paralogues largely share common cellular functions, they also show paralogue-specific properties in regard to cellular localization and substrate specificity (9Azuma Y. Arnaoutov A. Dasso M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 10Azuma Y. Arnaoutov A. Anan T. Dasso M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2172-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). For example, SUMO-1 is preferentially found within nucleoli, nuclear envelopes, and cytoplasmic foci (8Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar), whereas SUMO-2/3 accrue on chromosomes early in the nuclear reformation process (11Ayaydin F. Dasso M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5208-5218Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). With respect to substrate specificity, RanGAP1 is preferentially modified by SUMO-1, whereas SUMO-2/3 show preference for topoisomerase 2 during mitosis. However, promyelocytic leukemia protein conjugates to all three SUMO paralogues (12Sternsdorf T. Puccetti E. Jensen K. Hoelzer D. Will H. Ottmann O. Ruthardt M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 5170-5178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SUMO-1 is most abundant in the protein-conjugated form, whereas SUMO-2/3 isomers are more abundant in a free pool and are available to conjugate with target proteins upon various cellular stresses (13Kurepa J. Walker J. Smalle J. Gosink M. Davis S. Durham T. Sung D. Vierstra R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6862-6872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). However, at present, the mechanisms by which these different SUMO paralogues distinguish and conjugate to specific target proteins have yet to be elucidated. Additionally, it is unclear whether functional differences arise from modification by the various SUMO paralogues. Previous studies have identified a SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) in downstream effector proteins that bind to SUMO (14Kerscher O. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). For example, the SIM sequence of the DNA helicase Srs2 is thought to mediate the interaction between Srs2 and sumoylated proliferating cell nuclear antigen for suppression of illegitimate recombination events during DNA replication (15Pfander B. Moldovan G. Sacher M. Hoege C. Jentsch S. Nature. 2005; 436: 428-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The functional consequences of SUMO binding to SIM-containing proteins are beginning to emerge. The SUMO target protein thymine DNA glycosylase has an SIM-like sequence that interacts with an attached SUMO protein and is proposed to modulate SUMO-directed structural change (16Baba D. Maita N. Jee J. Uchimura Y. Saitoh H. Sugasawa K. Hanaoka F. Tochio H. Hiroaki H. Shirakawa M. Nature. 2005; 435: 979-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The SIM consensus sequence consists of a hydrophobic core, V/I-V/I-X-V/I, and is often associated with a stretch of acidic residues flanking either its N or C terminus (17Hecker C. Rabiller M. Haglund K. Bayer P. Dikic I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16117-16127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). An acidic amino acid is frequently present at the third position (X) of the hydrophobic core sequence (17Hecker C. Rabiller M. Haglund K. Bayer P. Dikic I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16117-16127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Structures of the complex formed between the SIM of PIASxα and SUMO-1, and of the quaternary complex formed by SUMO-1-conjugated Ran-GAP1, Ubc9, and RanBP2 (Nup358) have shown that the hydrophobic core of SIM interacts with a hydrophobic groove formed between strand β2 and helix α1 of SUMO-1 (18Song J. Zhang Z. Hu W. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40122-40129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 19Reverter D. Lima C. Nature. 2005; 435: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 20Capili A. Lima C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, the interactions between canonical SIMs and SUMO-1 have been well characterized; however, because the residues that form the hydrophobic cleft between strand β2 and helix α1 are not fully conserved between SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3, the molecular recognition of SUMO-3 by the canonical SIM has remained elusive, although the structure of SUMO-3-conjugated thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) has revealed that the SIM-like sequence of TDG interacts with the hydrophobic cleft in a manner similar to that observed for the SUMO-1·SIM complex structures (16Baba D. Maita N. Jee J. Uchimura Y. Saitoh H. Sugasawa K. Hanaoka F. Tochio H. Hiroaki H. Shirakawa M. Nature. 2005; 435: 979-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 21Baba D. Maita N. Jee J.

The SIM-like sequence of TDG, VEQV, is partially similar to the SIM consensus and to the SIMs of PIASxα and RanBP2. Although the importance of the acidic residues in and near SIM consensus sequences has been shown by mutagenesis (17Hecker C. Rabiller M. Haglund K. Bayer P. Dikic I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16117-16127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), from a structural point of view, their roles in SUMO binding are not yet clear. The acidic residues are not well converged (18Song J. Zhang Z. Hu W. Chen Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40122-40129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), or not included in the construct (19Reverter D. Lima C. Nature. 2005; 435: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), in the previously reported structures of SUMO·SIM complexes. It has been suggested that the negative charges on the side chains of these residues might modulate the SUMO·SIM interaction through long range electrostatic interactions with basic residues in the vicinity of the hydrophobic cleft of SUMO (17Hecker C. Rabiller M. Haglund K. Bayer P. Dikic I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16117-16127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The distribution of basic residues surrounding the clefts differs between SUMO-1 and SUMO-2/3, and this may result in different electrostatic interactions between these basic residues and the acidic residues of the SIM. The SIM-containing nuclear factor MCAF1 binds to the methyl-CpG-binding protein MBD1 and the histone methyltransferase SETDB1, which catalyzes tri-methylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3-K9) (22Uchimura Y. Ichimura T. Uwada J. Tachibana T. Sugahara S. Nakao M. Saitoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23180-23190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, the MCAF1·MBD1·SETDB1 complex is believed to be one of chromatin regulatory factors that link the epigenetic markers, DNA methylation, and histone methylation. Modification of MBD1 with either SUMO-2/3 or SUMO-1 enhances the interaction between MBD1 and MCAF1. Saito and co-workers showed that a SIM-containing segment from MCAF1 binds preferentially to SUMO-2/3 compared with SUMO-1, and that MCAF1 has a higher affinity for MBD1 conjugated to SUMO-2/3 than to SUMO-1 (22Uchimura Y. Ichimura T. Uwada J. Tachibana T. Sugahara S. Nakao M. Saitoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23180-23190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis has demonstrated that some of the acidic residues in the SIM of MCAF1 are essential for SUMO binding (22Uchimura Y. Ichimura T. Uwada J. Tachibana T. Sugahara S. Nakao M. Saitoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23180-23190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanism of the molecular recognition of SUMO-2/3 by MCAF1, we used NMR spectroscopy to determine the solution structure of SUMO-3 in complex with the SIM of MCAF1. The structural data in combination with results of mutagenesis experiments provide insights into the molecular basis of binding of MCAF1 to SUMO-3 and also into the role of the acidic residues of SIM in SUMO binding. Protein Expression and Purification—For the preparation of a peptide containing the SIM of MCAF1, a DNA fragment encoding the region of MCAF1, 938KTIDASVSKKAADSTSQCGKATGSDSSGVIDLTMDDEESGASQD981, was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pGEX4T-1 (GE Healthcare). Recombinant SUMO-3 and SIMMCAF1 were each obtained by expressing a GST-tagged protein in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) transformed with SUMO-3/pGEX4T-3 (22Uchimura Y. Ichimura T. Uwada J. Tachibana T. Sugahara S. Nakao M. Saitoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23180-23190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and SIMMCAF1/pGEX4T-1, followed by affinity purification on a glutathione-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare). After GST tag cleavage with thrombin, recombinant SUMO-3 was purified by using Superdex 75 gel-filtration chromatography (GE Healthcare). After GST tag cleavage with thrombin, the recombinant peptide containing the SIM of MCAF1 was purified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The peptide, designated as SIMMCAF1, has an extra sequence, GSPEF, from the vector at its N terminus. Protein/peptide uniformly labeled with 13C/15N was obtained by growing the bacteria in M9 minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl and 13C6-d-glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. SUMO-3-SIMMCAF1 complex, in which either SUMO-3 or SIMMCAF1 was labeled with 13C/15N, was dissolved in a buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.8), and 9! D2O and used for NMR experiments. These differently labeled samples were generated by titrating an excess amount of the unlabeled component into the 13C/15N-labeled component. The molar ratios for preparation of these complexes were estimated by monitoring the chemical shift changes in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra during titration. The final SUMO-3/SIMMCAF1 molar ratios of the samples were 1:1.5 (13C/15N-labeled SUMO-3 in complex with unlabeled SIMMCAF1) and 1:1.6 (unlabeled SUMO-3 in complex with 13C/15N-labeled SIMMCAF1), respectively. The protein concentrations of these complexes were 0.7 mm (13C/15N-labeled SUMO-3 in complex with unlabeled SIMMCAF1) and 0.5 mm (unlabeled SUMO-3 in complex with 13C/15N-labeled SIMMCAF1), respectively. NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR experiments were performed at 298 K on a Bruker DRX-600, DRX-700, or DRX-800 spectrometer. Data processing and analysis were performed using NMRPipe (23Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11570) Google Scholar) and Sparky (35Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. Sparky 3. University of California, San Francisco, CA2002Google Scholar), respectively. The sequential backbone chemical shift assignments of both SUMO-3 and SIMMCAF1 in the complex were obtained from the following triple-resonance experiments: three-dimensional HNCO, three-dimensional HN(CA)CO, three-dimensional HNCA, three-dimensional HN(CO)CA, three-dimensional CBCA-(CO)NH, and three-dimensional HNCACB. The side-chain chemical shifts of both proteins in the complex were assigned using five spectra: three-dimensional HBHA(CO)NH, three-dimensional CC(CO)NH, three-dimensional HCC(CO)NH, three-dimensional HCCH-TOCSY, and two-dimensional 1H-13C HSQC. The intramolecular distance restraints were obtained from three-dimensional 15N-edited NOESY and three-dimensional 13C-edited NOESY spectra with a mixing time of 120 ms. The intermolecular distance restraints were obtained from 15N-edited (F2)/15N,13 C-filtered (F1) NOESY, and 13C-edited (F2)/15N, 13 C-filtered (F1) NOESY spectra of two isotopically labeled SUMO-3-SIMMCAF1 complexes. 15N T1 and T2, and {1H}-15N steady-state NOE values were acquired at 298 K on a Bruker DRX-700 at a 15N frequency of 71.0 MHz, as described (24Ikegami T. Kuraoka I. Saijo M. Kodo N. Kyogoku Y. Morikawa K. Tanaka K. Shirakawa M. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 495-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The T1 relaxation delays were 10, 80, 180, 300, 450, 640, 800, and 1000 ms. The T2 relaxation delays were 16, 32, 48, 64, 80, 96, 128, and 160 ms. Data analysis and exponential curve fitting were performed with Sparky (35Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. Sparky 3. University of California, San Francisco, CA2002Google Scholar). In the experiments for {1H}-15N steady-state NOEs, relaxation delays of 5 s before the 1H saturations of 3 s were applied. Structure Calculations—All of the NOE cross-peaks were picked manually using Sparky (35Goddard T.D. Kneller D.G. Sparky 3. University of California, San Francisco, CA2002Google Scholar). Intramolecular NOE peaks were assigned in an automated manner using the CANDID algorithm of CYANA (25Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 24: 171-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Intermolecular distance restraints derived from the 15N-edited (F2)/15N,13C-filtered (F1) NOESY and 13C-edited (F2)/15N,13C-filtered (F1) NOESY spectra were generated by manual assignment. Using the CNS program with the restraints defined above, the structures of SUMO-3-SIMMCAF1 were calculated in vacuo with no electrostatic interactions. The 20 CNS structures, which gave the lowest energies, were further refined by the simulated annealing method using the MARBLE molecular dynamics simulation program (26Ikeguchi M. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) in an explicit water environment (27Yamane T. Okamura H. Ikeguchi M. Nishimura Y. Kidera A. Proteins. 2008; 71: 1970-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) with full electrostatic interactions. The electrostatic interactions were calculated using the Particle Mesh Ewald method (33Essmann U. Perera L. Berkowitz M.L. Darden T. Lee H. Pedersen L.G. J. Chem. Phys. 1995; 103: 8577-8593Crossref Scopus (15782) Google Scholar) without any cut-off operation. The systems contained about 11,000 water molecules and 8 counter ions. The force field used was CHARMM22/CMAP (34MacKerell A. D.J. Feig M. Brooks III, C.L. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1400-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (2851) Google Scholar) and, in the calculation, two of the histidine residues in SUMO-3 were protonated. The restraint functions adopted in MARBLE were the same as those used in CNS with the default values. The simulated annealing processes applied here were the same as those in Ref. 25Herrmann T. Güntert P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 24: 171-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar except for the final energy minimization processes, which were performed by 1000 steps of the steepest descent method and 1000 steps of the conjugate gradient method with the increased NMR scaling factors and force constants of bond stretching. The total simulation time for generating 20 structures was ∼40 ns, taking ∼54 h in a 128-CPU parallel computer. Mutational Binding Assays—Mutant constructs were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene). The binding affinities between SUMO-1/3 and SIMMCAF1 or its mutant and between SUMO-1/3 or their mutant and SIMMCAF1 were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). ITC measurements were performed at 25 °C using a MicroCal VP-ITC calorimeter. The protein/peptide samples were dissolved in a buffer containing 20 mm phosphate (pH 6.8), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0, 0.15, 0.3, 0.6, or 1.0 m NaCl, and thoroughly degassed before the titration experiments. The peptide concentrations were determined by a BCA protein assay (Pierce). Five microliters of ∼0.7 mm SUMO-3, SUMO-1, or a SUMO mutant were injected at 5-min intervals into the 1.4-ml sample cell containing ∼0.03 mm peptide. The baseline-corrected data were analyzed using software provided by the manufacturer (MicroCal). The first data point was excluded from the analysis. For each interaction, two independent titration experiments were performed. Structure Determination of SUMO-3-SIMMCAF1—MCAF1 contains a SUMO-interacting motif (SIM), 965GVIDLTMDDEE975, which is comprised of a hydrophobic core (underlined) and a C-terminal acidic stretch. We determined the binding affinity of the SIM-containing fragment of MCAF1 (938KTIDASVSKKAADSTSQCGKATGSDSSGVIDLTMDDEESGASQD981) with an extra sequence, GSPEF, at its N terminus (designated as SIMMCAF1) for SUMO-3 and SUMO-1 by ITC. SIMMCAF1 had a higher affinity for SUMO-3 (Kd = 1.3 ± 0.1 μm) than for SUMO-1 (Kd = 13.9 ± 2.1 μm) in a buffer containing 20 mm phosphate (pH 6.8), 1 mm dithiothreitol (see Fig. 5a and Table 2).TABLE 2Dissociation constants between SIMMCAF1 and SUMO determined by ITC measurementsSUMOKdIncreaseμm-foldWild-typeSUMO-31.3 ± 0.111SUMO-113.9 ± 2.110.7Smt35.49 ± 0.84.2MutantSUMO-3 (K35A)5.76 ± 0.084.4SUMO-3 (R36A)5.6 ± 0.244.3SUMO-3 (H37A)2.3 ± 0.031.7SUMO-3 (R36M,H37T)3.8 ± 0.162.9SUMO-3 (R36A,H37A)6.0 ± 0.674.6SUMO-3 (K35A,R36A,H37A)12.8 ± 0.359.8SUMO-1 (M40R,T41H)12.2 ± 0.99.4 Open table in a new tab The molecular mechanism of the binding of SIM with SUMO-3 was investigated by determining the tertiary structure of SIMMCAF1 in complex with SUMO-3 using NMR spectroscopy. Resonance assignments and distance restraints for structure calculations were obtained from the heteronuclear multi-dimensional spectra of complexes in which either SUMO-3 or SIMMCAF1 was labeled uniformly with 15N and 13C. Intermolecular distance restraints were derived from 15N,13C-filtered NOESY experiments using the complex samples (Fig. 1). The structure of the SUMO-3-SIMMCAF1 complex was determined from a total of 1109 NMR-derived distance restraints, including 85 intermolecular restraints (supplemental Table S1), and 112 dihedral angle restraints. After the structure calculations with CNS (28Brünger A. Adams P. Clore G. DeLano W. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R. Jiang J. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N. Read R. Rice L. Simonson T. Warren G. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar), the final structure refinements were performed by MARBLE (27Yamane T. Okamura H. Ikeguchi M. Nishimura Y. Kidera A. Proteins. 2008; 71: 1970-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This refinement procedure significantly improved the geometry of the structures as assessed by the Ramachandran plot obtained by PROCHECK (29Laskowski R. Rullmannn J. MacArthur M. Kaptein R. Thornton J. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4430) Google Scholar) (Table 1). The ensemble of the final 20 structures is well defined, except for the 32 N-terminal residues (five amino acids (GSPEF) from the vector and residues 938-964 of MCAF1) and the six C-terminal residues of SIMMCAF1 and the 15 N-terminal residues of SUMO-3 (Fig. 2a). Few long range NOEs were observed for the terminal regions of SUMO-3 and SIMMCAF1, which showed poor convergence, suggesting that these regions are flexible in solution. Intrinsic flexibility of the N-terminal region of SUMO-3 has also been suggested by previous structural studies (21Baba D. Maita N. Jee J. Uchimura Y. Saitoh H. Sugasawa K. Hanaoka F. Tochio H. Hiroaki H. Shirakawa M. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The root-mean-square deviations (r.m.s.d.s) of backbone and all heavy atoms over residues 16-87 of SUMO-3 and residues 966-969 of SIMMCAF1 were 0.61 Å and 1.14 Å, respectively.TABLE 1NMR refinement statistics for the SUMO-3·SIMMCAF1 complex structuresCNSaThe NMR structures calculated by using the CNS program in vacuo and by using the MARBLE program in the explicit water environment.MARBLEaThe NMR structures calculated by using the CNS program in vacuo and by using the MARBLE program in the explicit water environment.NMR distance and dihedral constraintsDistance constraintsTotal NOE1109Intramolecular1024Sequential (i - j = 1)622Medium-range (i - j 4)166Long-range (i - j 5)236Intermolecular85Hydrogen bonds56Total dihedral angle restraints112Structure statisticsViolationsNumber of dihedral angle violation > 3°NoneNoneNumber of distance constraint violation > 0.3 ÅNoneNoneDeviations from idealized geometryBond lengths (Å)0.00520.0033Bond angles (°)0.59182.8585Average pairwise r.m.s.d.bThe average pairwise r.m.s.d. was calculated using residues 16-87 of SUMO-3 and residues 966-969 of SIMMCAF1.

Open table in a new tab The acidic stretch of SIMMCAF1 (residues 972-975) was less converged than the hydrophobic core of MCAF1 (residues 966-969). The r.m.s.d.s of the backbone and heavy atoms over the acidic stretch in the 20 structures refined by the MARBLE calculations were 1.18 ± 0.34 and 2.90 ± 0.65 Å, respectively, whereas those in the 20 lowest energy structures generated by the CNS calculations were 0.91 ± 0.37 and 2.39 ± 0.56 Å, respectively. In contrast, the hydrophobic core of MCAF1 was well converged: the r.m.s.d.s of the backbone and heavy atoms over residues 966-969 in the MARBLE structures were 0.29 ± 0.14 and 0.97 ± 0.28 Å, respectively. The structure that had the smallest r.m.s.d. with respect to the mean structure was selected as a representative and used for further structural description. Structure Description of the SUMO-3-SIMMCAF1 Complex—A ribbon diagram of the representative structure is shown in Fig. 2b. The overall fold of the structure excluding the N-terminal residues of SUMO-3 in the complex was nearly identical to the crystal structure of unliganded SUMO-3 (30Huang W. Ko T. Li S. Wang A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 4114-4122Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Residues 965-975 of SIMMCAF1 adopted an extended conformation, and were embedded in a hydrophobic cleft located between strand β2 and helix α1 of SUMO-3. Residues 966-969 of SIMMCAF1 formed a parallel β-sheet pairing with strand β2 of SUMO-3. The side chains of these SIMMCAF1 residues contributed to a major interface between SUMO-3 and SIMMCAF1, as evidenced by a large number of intermolecular NOEs observed for these regions (supplemental Table S1). The side-chain aliphatic groups of Ile-967 and Leu-969 (positions +2 and +4 of the SIM consensus, respectively; Fig. 2c) of MCAF1, which are two of the three conserved hydrophobic residues in SIMs, made extensive hydrophobic contacts with the side chains of Val-30, Phe-32, and Lys-42 and Ile-34, Thr-38, and Leu-43 of SUMO-3, respectively (Fig. 3a). The remaining conserved hydrophobic residue in the SIM, Val-966 (positions +1, Fig. 2c), interacted with the aliphatic part of the side chain of Val-30, Gln-31, and Arg-50. In addition, the negatively charged side chain of Asp-968 showed an electrostatic interaction with the side chain of Lys-33 of SUMO-3 (Fig. 3b). Uchimura et al. (22Uchimura Y. Ichimura T. Uwada J. Tachibana T. Sugahara S. Nakao M. Saitoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23180-23190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) used mutational analysis to demonstrate the importance of the residues Val-966, Ile-967, Asp-968, and Leu-969 of MCAF1 for SUMO-3 binding, and showed that alanine substitution of any of these residues markedly reduced binding affinity. The complex structure also suggests that 972DDEE975, the acidic stretch of SIMMCAF1, interacted electrostatically with a positively charged surface patch formed by Lys-33, Lys-35, Arg-36, and His-37 residues from the loop connecting strand β2 and helix α1 of SUMO-3 (Fig. 3b), although the convergence of the acidic stretch was relatively poor in the final structures (Fig. 2a). In some of the final NMR structures, several potential salt bridges were observed between Lys-33, Lys-35, or His-37 of SUMO-3, and Asp968, Asp-972, Asp973, or Glu-975 of SIMMCAF1 (data not shown). Despite its importance for SUMO-3 binding, the acidic stretch of SIMMCAF1 (residues 972-975) has higher conformational flexibility than the hydrophobic core, as suggested by the low convergence of NMR structures (Fig. 2a). The poor convergence of the acidic stretch is consistent with dynamic properties, as suggested by the low {1H}-15N steady-state NOE and larger 15N T2 values in this region (Fig. 4). The NOE values for the backbone amide groups of residues in the acidic stretch (<0.4) are significantly smaller than those for residues Ile-967 to Thr-970 (>0.7). The T2 values for the backbone amide 15N resonances of residues in the acidic stretch (>0.14 s) are also significantly larger than those for"

However, the function(s) of human Wrnip1 has remained elusive so far. Here we report that Wrnip1 is distributed inside heterogeneous structures detectable in nondamaged cells throughout the cell cycle. In an attempt to characterize these structures, we found that Wrnip1 resides in DNA replication factories. Upon treatments that stall replication forks, such as UVC light, the amount of chromatin-bound Wrnip1 and the number of foci significantly increase, further implicating Wrnip1 in DNA replication. Interestingly, the nuclear pattern of Wrnip1 appears to extend to a broader landscape, as it can be detected in promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies. The presence of Wrnip1 into these heterogeneous subnuclear structures requires its ubiquitin-binding zinc finger (UBZ) domain, which is able to interact with different ubiquitin (Ub) signals, including mono-Ub and chains linked via lysine 48 and 63. Moreover, the oligomerization of Wrnip1 mediated by its C terminus is also important for proper subnuclear localization. Our study is the first to reveal the composite and regulated topography of Wrnip1 in the human nucleus, highlighting its potential role in replication and other nuclear transactions.

Progression of DNA replication forks can be halted by DNA lesions or secondary structures, tight DNA-protein complexes, or the lack of deoxyribonucleotides (1.Branzei D. Foiani M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Several solutions have been selected throughout evolution to allow for the bypass of stalled replication forks and resume DNA synthesis. These include translesion synthesis, fork regression, and homologous recombination (1.Branzei D. Foiani M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 2.Moldovan G.L. Pfander B. Jentsch S. Cell. 2007; 129: 665-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). Failure in recovery of stalled replication forks may result in single and double strand DNA breaks, genomic instability, and if persistent, carcinogenesis (1.Branzei D. Foiani M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Mgs1 (maintenance of genomic stability 1) was originally identified in bakers' yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an evolutionarily conserved AAA+ ATPase important for maintaining genomic stability (3.Hishida T. Iwasaki H. Ohno T. Morishita T. Shinagawa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8283-8289Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the mouse Mgs1 orthologue, Wrnip1 (Werner-interacting protein 1) was cloned as a binder of the helicase (Wrn) mutated in the Werner syndrome (4.Hickson I.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 5.Kudlow B.A. Kennedy B.K. Monnat Jr., R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 394-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Telomere aberrations and defective telomere lagging-strand replication have been proposed to be a key patho-mechanism of this very rare premature aging condition, which remarkably recapitulates the main features of physiological aging (6.Crabbe L. Jauch A. Naeger C.M. Holtgreve-Grez H. Karlseder J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 2205-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 7.Crabbe L. Verdun R.E. Haggblom C.I. Karlseder J. Science. 2004; 306: 1951-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, mgs1 was found to be synthetically lethal with the rad6 and rad18 genes involved in DNA damage tolerance, indicating that Mgs1/Wrnip1 might deal with stalled replication forks (8.Hishida T. Ohno T. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2019-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A further study demonstrated that yeast Mgs1 can physically interact with the DNA loading clamp PCNA 4The abbreviations used are: PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; Ub, ubiquitin; UBZ, ubiquitin-binding zinc finger; PML, promyelocytic leukemia; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; MALLS, multiangle laser light scattering; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; RPA, replication protein A; UBA, ubiquitin-associated domain; Hs, Homo sapiens.4The abbreviations used are: PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; Ub, ubiquitin; UBZ, ubiquitin-binding zinc finger; PML, promyelocytic leukemia; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; MALLS, multiangle laser light scattering; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; RPA, replication protein A; UBA, ubiquitin-associated domain; Hs, Homo sapiens. and suggested that Mgs1 may participate in a DNA damage tolerance pathway alternative to the Rad6-Rad18 one (9.Hishida T. Ohya T. Kubota Y. Kamada Y. Shinagawa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5509-5517Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The inferred role of Mgs1/Wrnip1 in replication has been strengthened by the evidence that Mgs1 in vitro stimulates the activity of Fen1, an endonuclease indispensable for the removal of Okazaki fragments during lagging-strand replication (10.Kim J.H. Kang Y.H. Kang H.J. Kim D.H. Ryu G.H. Kang M.J. Seo Y.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 6137-6150Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Additionally, purified human Wrnip1 can interact with DNA polymerase δ and increase the initiation efficiency of DNA replication in vitro (11.Tsurimoto T. Shinozaki A. Yano M. Seki M. Enomoto T. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Besides a possible function in DNA replication, human Wrnip1 has also been shown to selectively bind ubiquitin (Ub) chains but not mono-Ub and has been proposed to regulate the turnover of ubiquitylated proteins (12.Bish R.A. Myers M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23184-23193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, the precise function(s) of Wrnip1 in mammalian cells still remain unclear. It is conceivable that studies aimed at elucidating the function(s) of Wrnip1 in more detail may reveal unexpected insights in the mechanisms of DNA replication and their link to aging. Here we show that in the nucleus of cultured cells human Wrnip1 is concentrated in a variety of structures, most of which have a punctated, focal appearance and are visible throughout the cell cycle. A number of these foci overlap with replication factories, and the presence of Wrnip1 at DNA replication sites is greatly increased upon conditions that stall replication forks, such as UVC. Additionally, a proportion of Wrnip1 foci co-localize with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies, independently of the cell cycle phase. Interestingly, the presence of Wrnip1 inside the aforementioned structures seems to specifically require its Ub-binding zinc finger domain (UBZ) as well as its ability to form oligomers. The presence of Wrnip1 at sites other than replication foci also hints at possible functions of this protein beyond DNA replication, which certainly deserve future attention. Molecular Cloning—The following constructs were generated using the indicated restriction enzymes: pcDNA3.1-FLAG-Wrnip1 Mm and pGEX-Wrnip1 Hs (EcoRI and XhoI); pEGFP-N1-Wrnip1 Hs (EcoRI and BamHI); pGEX-UBZWrnip1 Hs (EcoRI and XhoI); pcDNA3.1-Myc-Rad18 Hs and pcDNA3.1-FLAG-Myc-Rad18 (EcoRI). pGEX-Ub and pGEX-Ub I44A have been described previously (13.Bienko M. Green C.M. Crosetto N. Rudolf F. Zapart G. Coull B. Kannouche P. Wider G. Peter M. Lehmann A.R. Hofmann K. Dikic I. Science. 2005; 310: 1821-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Also pETM-30-UBZRad18 Hs has been described elsewhere (14.Notenboom V. Hibbert R.G. van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. Olsen J.V. Mann M. Sixma T.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 5819-5830Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The cDNA used as a template in the generation of Wrnip1 constructs was obtained from the genomic consortium RZPD. The template for Rad18 constructs was HA-Rad18, which has been described previously (13.Bienko M. Green C.M. Crosetto N. Rudolf F. Zapart G. Coull B. Kannouche P. Wider G. Peter M. Lehmann A.R. Hofmann K. Dikic I. Science. 2005; 310: 1821-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). pBABE.puro-Wrnip1-EGFP was constructed by amplifying Wrnip1-EGFP from pEGFP-N1-Wrnip1 with primers containing the cleavage sequence of EcoRI. Substitution of Asp-37 to Ala in Wrnip1 and of Asp-221 to Ala in Rad18 was performed by PCR site-directed mutagenesis. The pBABE.puro-Wrnip1-EGFP and the pcDNA3.1-FLAG-Myc-Rad18 UBZ chimeras were obtained using the megaprimer mutagenesis method (15.Geiser M. Cebe R. Drewello D. Schmitz R. BioTechniques. 2001; 31 (92): 88-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) and the sequence of Mus musculus polymerase ι, Homo sapiens polymerase η, and H. sapiens Wrnip1. Antibodies and Other Chemicals—Anti-FLAG antibodies were from Sigma (M2 catalog number F3165 and M5 catalog number F4042), anti-PML (catalog number sc-966), anti-hemagglutinin (catalog number sc-7392), and anti-Myc (catalog number sc-40) antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, anti-Wrnip1 from GeneTex (catalog number GTX24731), and anti-EGFP from BD Biosciences (Living Colors® catalog number 632460). Recombinant Proteins—The indicated GST fusions were obtained by inducing transformed Escherichia coli BL21 with 0.3 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, when the culture reached A600 ≈1, and growing them overnight at 15 °C. Bacteria were then harvested in HEPES 20 mm, NaCl 150 mm, ZnCl2 2 μm, and β-mercaptoethanol 0.05%, supplemented with protease inhibitors just prior to use. The bacterial suspension was sonicated, and the lysate was cleared and then flown through a GSTrap™ HP column (GE Healthcare) mounted on anÄktaprime Plus chromatographic system (GE Healthcare). When indicated, GST was cleaved with thrombin (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Synchronization—HEK 293T, Amphotropic Phoenix HEK 293, and HeLa cells were purchased from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown in DMEM high glucose medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) and 10% fetal bovine serum. After infection, HeLa cells were selected in the presence of 3 μg/ml puromycin. HEK 293T were transfected using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HeLa and Phoenix Amphotropic 293 cells were transfected using Effectene (Qiagen). For lysis, cells were incubated with a “Triton” buffer containing HEPES 50 mm, pH 7.5, NaCl 150 mm, EDTA 1 mm, EGTA 1 mm, Triton X-100 1%, glycerin 10%, NaF 25 mm, supplemented with protease inhibitors. The lysate was cleared, the supernatant collected (Triton X-100-soluble fraction), and the Triton-insoluble pellet resuspended in a buffer containing HEPES 50 mm, pH 7.4, NaCl 50 mm, MgCl2 2 mm, Triton X-100 0.1%, SDS 0.05%, and 2.5 units per μl of lysate of Benzonase® nuclease (Novagen). After 1 h of incubation at 4 °C, the suspension was centrifuged and the supernatant (Triton X-100-insoluble fraction) mixed with the Triton X-100-soluble fraction. For synchronization, cells seeded on 10-cm Petri dishes containing one 12-mm coverslip per dish were grown to a confluency of 20-30%. At this point, thymidine was added to a final concentration 2 mm. After 18 h, cells were washed in PBS and put in fresh medium without thymidine. A second 17-h block was repeated 8 h after the first thymidine washout. At the time of the second release, a coverslip was taken for microscopy from one dish, whereas the remaining cells in the same dish were trypsinized and fixed in 70% ethanol. This procedure was repeated 5, 9, and 12 h after thymidine withdrawal. For cell cycle analysis, fixed cells were washed three times in PBS and resuspended in 2 ml of PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 40 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma), and 100 μg/ml DNase-free RNase (Qiagen). After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C in the dark, the cell cycle distribution was analyzed using a Epics XL cytofluorimeter (Beckman Coulter) and the EXPO™32 ADC software (Beckman Coulter). Virus Preparation and Infections—Retroviruses were produced by transfecting Amphotropic Phoenix HEK 293 cells with pBABE.puro constructs. Transfections were performed in 100-mm diameter dishes using Effectene (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Virus-containing supernatants were collected 24 and 48 h after transfection, cleared through a 0.2-μm pore diameter filter and supplemented with 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). 24 h after transfection, 5-10 × 104 target cells per well in a 6-well plate were infected with 500 μl of viral supernatant, and the medium was replaced after 8 h. The same procedure was repeated 48 h after transfection. 72 h after the first infection, selection of the infected cells was performed by adding puromycin to the growth medium. Immune Precipitations and GST Pulldowns—Immune precipitations and pulldowns were done lysing a confluent well of a 6-well format plate with 500 μl of Triton buffer, and using 200 μl of lysate plus 200 μl of Triton buffer per reaction. After adding the indicated antibodies or GST fusions, the mixture was rotated for 4 h at 4 °C. In the case of immune precipitations, 20 μl of agarose-protein A were added per reaction 1 h before the end of rotation. Each sample was then washed four times with 600 μl of Triton buffer. Agarose and Sepharose beads were resuspended in 25 μl of Laemmli buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min, and proteins were finally separated by SDS-PAGE. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)—Experiments were performed at 25 °C on a Biacore T-100 instrument (GE Healthcare). GST-UBZs or isolated UBZs were immobilized using an amine-coupling method to a CM5 chip at an immobilization density of 50-250 response units. Mono-Ub, Lys-48-, and Lys-63-type di-Ub chains were independently injected over the chip at concentrations of 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1 μm, at 25 μl·min-1, with a 60-s association phase followed by a 5-min dissociation phase. A buffer consisting of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 μm ZnCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.05% Tween 20 was used throughout. Standard double referencing data subtraction methods were used before analysis of kinetics. Data analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism. Size-exclusion Chromatography—Three confluent 10-cm dishes of HeLa_Wrnip1-EGFP cells were extracted as for laser scanning microscopy (see below) and lysed in 150 μl of a buffer containing HEPES 20 mm, pH 7.5, NaCl 50 mm, ZnCl2 2.5 μm, MgCl2 2 mm, dithiothreitol 1 mm, glycerin 10%, and Benzonase nuclease 4 μl/ml, supplemented with protease inhibitors. 4 mg of proteins were loaded onto a Superose 6 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with the same buffer used for cell lysis. Gel filtration was performed at 0.3 ml/min, and 100 fractions 0.2 ml each were collected. Multiangle Laser Light Scattering (MALLS)—Static light scatterings experiments with MALLS were performed at 25 °C on a Mini-Dawn light scattering detector (Wyatt Technology) set online with a Superdex S75 10/30 column (GE Healthcare), in the same buffer used for SPR. Refractive index and light scattering detectors were calibrated against toluene and bovine serum albumin. Induction of DNA Damage—For UVC treatment, cells on coverslips were washed once in PBS and UV-irradiated at 254 nm with a dose of 15 J/m2. Afterward, fresh medium was added, and cells were incubated for 24 h before being processed for microscopy. For hydroxyurea (Sigma) treatment, a stock solution of 100 mm in DMEM was added onto cells to a final concentration of 10 mm. Cells were then incubated for 24 h before extraction and processing for microscopy. For topotecan (Hycamptin®, GlaxoSmithKline) treatment, cells grown on coverslips were placed in DMEM containing 1 μm topotecan for 3 h. Afterward, cells were washed with PBS and incubated in fresh medium for an additional 4 h before being processed for microscopy. Laser Scanning Microscopy—Cells were grown on coverslips and transfected when indicated. For extraction with Triton X-100, cells were washed once in PBS and once in CSK buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2) and incubated for 3 min in CSK plus 0.3% Triton X-100. Cells were then washed three times with CSK, followed by one wash in PBS and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde. Subsequently, cells were permeabilized for 10 min at room temperature, with a 0.2% Triton X-100 solution in PBS. All cells were blocked overnight at 4 °C in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in the blocking solution, and washes were performed in PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20. The coverslips were mounted on 10 μl of aqueous mounting medium (Biomeda) placed on a glass holder. Images were acquired by the LSM 510 META laser scanning microscope (Zeiss). Quantifications of Microscopy Images and Statistical Analysis—To quantify the extent of co-localization between Wrnip1-EGFP and RPA, 44 Z-stacks composed on average of 6 slices were processed using the freely downloadable Mac-Biophotonics ImageJ software and the plugins “Colocalization Highlighter” and “Object Counter3D.” To quantify the number of either Wrnip1- or Rad18-positive foci and their overlapping, 100 focal planes were analyzed using the LSM 510 META software on the expert mode. Details of the methods used to define intensity thresholds and foci are available upon request. To measure the amount of protein resistant to extraction by Triton X-100, 200 focal planes were examined for each experimental condition. Each nucleus was selected, and the mean intensity of pixels per nucleus together with the standard deviation (S.D.) were read. Comparisons were done using a Student's t likelihood test, considering the two distributions normal and their variances dissimilar. Yeast Two-hybrid System—The yeast strain Y190 was transformed as described previously (16.Hecker C.M. Rabiller M. Haglund K. Bayer P. Dikic I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16117-16127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) with empty pYTH9 or pYTH9-Wrnip1 as a bait, and pACT2-Wrnip1, pACT2-Wrnip1 D37A, or Wrnip1 fragments in pACT2 prey. Yeasts were grown on a synthetic dropout (SD) medium without leucine and tryptophan (SD/-Trp/-Leu). Colonies appearing after 3 days on the selection medium were grown overnight in 5 ml of liquid selection medium. 0.5 ml of overnight culture were grown in 4.5 ml of SD/-Trp/-Leu medium for 1-2 h, and the concentration of cells was estimated by measuring the A600, and the amount of cells per ml was adjusted by diluting with fresh medium. 5 μl of cell suspension containing the same amount of cells were spotted on SD/-Trp/-Leu agar plates as well as on 3′AT agar plates. The 2nd day after spotting, cells were transferred to a Whatman filter paper and assayed for β-galactosidase activity with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal; Roth). Wrnip1 Can Interact with Both Mono- and Poly-ubiquitin—We have recently described two Ub-binding domains, UBM and UBZ, in the Y-family of translesion DNA polymerases. UBM and UBZ recognize ubiquitylated PCNA and are important for translesion synthesis (13.Bienko M. Green C.M. Crosetto N. Rudolf F. Zapart G. Coull B. Kannouche P. Wider G. Peter M. Lehmann A.R. Hofmann K. Dikic I. Science. 2005; 310: 1821-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Following that discovery, we have pursued a computational prediction of proteins bearing either UBM or UBZ domains and grouped the latter into eight groups (13.Bienko M. Green C.M. Crosetto N. Rudolf F. Zapart G. Coull B. Kannouche P. Wider G. Peter M. Lehmann A.R. Hofmann K. Dikic I. Science. 2005; 310: 1821-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Among all proteins predicted to contain one or more UBZ domains, those having a known or putative function in DNA damage responses carried either a type 3 or type 4 UBZ module (Fig. 1A). Compared with the UBZ of polymerase η, which belongs to the UBZ3 class, a major difference in the UBZ4 group was the fourth zinc ligand residue, which is a Cys instead of His as in UBZ3. Other more subtle differences between these two UBZ classes were also found. For instance, the invariant Asp residue within the second zinc-binding dyad of UBZ3-type domains could also be found in many UBZ4 fingers but was not as well conserved within the UBZ4 family. The same trend held true for several other residues (indicated by asterisks in Fig. 1A), which have been recently proposed to be involved in binding to Ub (17.Bomar M.G. Pai M.T. Tzeng S.R. Li S.S. Zhou P. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In contrast, the region around the first zinc-binding dyad appeared to be better conserved in UBZ4 as compared with UBZ3 (Fig. 1A). We focused our attention on Wrnip1/Mgs1, which was recently shown to selectively bind poly-Ub chains and regulate the turnover of ubiquitylated proteins (12.Bish R.A. Myers M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23184-23193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Wrnip1 has been genetically linked to the ubiquitin ligase Rad18 in yeast and chicken cells and proposed to function in response to stalling of DNA replication forks (8.Hishida T. Ohno T. Iwasaki H. Shinagawa H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2019-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18.Yoshimura A. Seki M. Hayashi T. Kusa Y. Tada S. Ishii Y. Enomoto T. Biol. Pharm.

Syst. 2008; 83: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Because Rad18 is known to accumulate in a UBZ-dependent manner at sites of DNA damage (20.Nakajima S. Lan L. Kanno S. Usami N. Kobayashi K. Mori M. Shiomi T. Yasui A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34687-34695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and because Wrnip1 UBZ is very similar to the one in Rad18 (Fig. 1A), we wondered whether the zinc finger domain of Wrnip1 may regulate its subnuclear distribution. We reasoned that by studying this phenomenon we may cast light on what appears to be a general UBD requirement for proteins containing them to form foci (13.Bienko M. Green C.M. Crosetto N. Rudolf F.

Science. 2007; 316: 1202-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 23.Kim H. Huang J. Chen J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 710-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 24.Liu Z. Wu J. Yu X. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 716-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). First, we wanted to confirm that Wrnip1 can bind to Ub and that its UBZ is necessary and sufficient for such interaction. It has been recently shown that Wrnip1 can bind to poly- but not mono-ubiquitin (12.Bish R.A. Myers M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23184-23193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To validate these findings, we fused the amino acids 9-48 spanning the UBZ domain of human Wrnip1 in-frame with GST, expressed such fusion in E. coli, and used it to pull down a mixture of Ub chains varying in length from 2 to 7 monomers, linked either via lysine 48 or 63. Indeed, the UBZ domain of Wrnip1 could bind to both types of chains (data not shown). However, when overexpressed in HEK 293T cells, Wrnip1 could also interact with mono-ubiquitin either fused in-frame with GST and bound to glutathione-Sepharose or coupled to agarose beads (Fig. 1B). In contrast, Wrnip1 did not bind to the GST-fused Ub mutant I44A (Fig. 1B). This residue lies in the so-called “hydrophobic” patch on the surface of ubiquitin, and it is crucial for the interaction of Ub with the majority of known UBDs (25.Hicke L. Schubert H.L. Hill C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 26.Hurley J.H. Lee S. Prag G. Biochem. J. 2006; 399: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous findings (12.Bish R.A. Myers M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23184-23193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), we also found that mutation to alanine of the highly conserved aspartate residue at position 37 in the human and mouse sequences of Wrnip1 (D37A) abolishes binding to both mono- and poly-Ub. This mutant corresponds to the previously described D652A mutant of polymerase η (13.Bienko M. Green C.M. Crosetto N. Rudolf F. Zapart G. Coull B. Kannouche P. Wider G. Peter M. Lehmann A.R. Hofmann K. Dikic I. Science. 2005; 310: 1821-1824Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), which does not disrupt the overall structure of the zinc finger, being placed in the outer surface of the adjacent α-helix involved in direct interaction with Ub (17.Bomar M.G. Pai M.T. Tzeng S.R. Li S.S. Zhou P. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). When overexpressed in HEK 293T cells, the Wrnip1 D37A mutant could not be pulled down by GST-Ub, unlike wild-type Wrnip1 (Fig. 1B). Similarly, when the corresponding aspartate residue at position 221 in Rad18 was mutated to alanine, its interaction with mono-Ub was abolished (Fig. 1B). To gain further insight in the binding properties of Wrnip1 UBZ, we fused it in-frame with GST and used the purified fusion protein for SPR with a Biacore flow system. As shown in Fig. 1C, clear binding curves could be seen for the wild-type protein, with a dissociation constant for the complex between wild-type GST-UBZWrnip1 bound to the chip and free mono-Ub estimated to be 46 μm from the equilibrium responses. The binding displayed fast-on fast-off kinetics, as expected for a low affinity interaction. In the case of the D37A mutant, no significant binding was seen with Ub concentrations up to 128 μm, confirming a dissociation constant for ubiquitin far in excess of this value. To exclude that the GST moiety affects the interaction between UBZ and Ub, we cleaved it by thrombin and coupled the purified UBZ domain to the chip for SPR (Fig. 1D). Similarly, we obtained a KD of ∼40 μm in the case of wild-type Wrnip1 UBZ bound to mono-Ub (Fig. 1D). As a control, we used the purified UBZ of Rad18 and obtained a KD of 38 μm, consistent with the previously published value of 42 μm for GST-UBZRad18 (14.Notenboom V. Hibbert R.G. van Rossum-Fikkert S.E. Olsen J.V. Mann M. Sixma T.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 5819-5830Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that Wrnip1 and Rad18 UBZs can bind mono-Ub with comparable affinities, not surprising given their high sequence similarity. However, we observed a difference when di-Ub chains linked either via lysine 48 or 63 were flown over the UBZs of Wrnip1 and Rad18. In the case of Wrnip1, KD values for both Lys-48- and Lys-63-type Ub2 chains were slightly reduced, indicating a stronger interaction, whereas in the case of Rad18 this was observed only for Lys-63 chains. In contrast, the KD value of Rad18 for Lys-48-linked di-ubiquitin was around 100 μm (Fig. 1D). These results demonstrate that Wrnip1 and Rad18 UBZs can bind both mono- and distinct poly-Ub chains and highlight a difference in chain-type selectivity between the two domains, despite their sequence similarity. Wrnip1 Is Concentrated in Replication Factories and Other Subnuclear Structures—To gain knowledge on the biological function of human Wrnip1, we decided to examine its nuclear distribution by laser scanning microscopy. Among several tested antibodies, only one managed to detect Wrnip1 in fixed cells. Typically, Wrnip1 was confined in the nucleus, where it was mostly diffuse and excluded from nucleoli (data not shown). To visualize potential Wrnip1-positive subnuclear structures, we pretreated the samples with a mild detergent solution. This procedure has been largely applied to a variety of other nuclear proteins"
https://openalex.org/W2161344641,"Polymorphonuclear leukocytes undergo directed movement to sites of infection, a complex process known as chemotaxis. Extension of the polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) leading edge toward a chemoattractant in association with uropod retraction must involve a coordinated increase/decrease in membrane, redistribution of cell volume, or both. Deficits in PMN phagocytosis and trans-endothelial migration, both highly motile PMN functions, suggested that the anion transporters, ClC-3 and IClswell, are involved in cell motility and shape change (Moreland, J. G., Davis, A. P., Bailey, G., Nauseef, W. M., and Lamb, F. S. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 281, 12277-12288). We hypothesized that ClC-3 and IClswell are required for normal PMN chemotaxis through regulation of cell volume and shape change. Using complementary chemotaxis assays, EZ-TAXIScan™ and dynamic imaging analysis software, we analyzed the directed cell movement and morphology of PMNs lacking normal anion transporter function. Murine Clcn3-/- PMNs and human PMNs treated with anion transporter inhibitors demonstrated impaired chemotaxis in response to formyl peptide. This included decreased cell velocity and failure to undergo normal cycles of elongation and retraction. Impaired chemotaxis was not due to a diminished number of formyl peptide receptors in either murine or human PMNs, as measured by flow cytometry. Murine Clcn3-/- and Clcn3+/+ PMNs demonstrated a similar regulatory volume decrease, indicating that the IClswell response to hypotonic challenge was intact in these cells. We further demonstrated that IClswell is essential for shape change during human PMN chemotaxis. We speculate that ClC-3 and IClswell have unique roles in regulation of PMN chemotaxis; IClswell through direct effects on PMN volume and ClC-3 through regulation of IClswell.

Mobilized by chemoattractant (CA) gradients, PMNs move out of the vasculature, across the endothelium, and into infected tissues. Seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors transduce the CA stimulus into intracellular signals that initiate polymerization of F-actin and extension of the PMN leading edge (2Cicchetti G. Allen P.G. Glogauer M. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 2002; 13: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Specific downstream intracellular signals control subcellular localization of the cytoskeleton, prevent random pseudopod extension, and induce retraction of the myosin-enriched uropod (3Parent C.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 4-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In this way, PMNs achieve directed movement toward a CA source.During the classical chemotaxis movement cycle, PMNs transform from nearly spherical to a flattened and elongated shape (4Kay R.R. Langridge P. Traynor D. Hoeller O. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Repetitive phases of PMN cell polarization, with leading edge extension toward a CA stimulus and uropod retraction, must involve a directed increase/decrease in membrane surface area, a redistribution of cytoplasmic volume, or both. Although much is known about the role of the actin cytoskeleton in cell motility, less is understood about the mechanism by which a cell regulates its membrane/volume balance to promote efficient motility. In the Schwab ion transport model of cell migration, ion channels involved in volume regulation are spatially polarized in motile cells, thus promoting a volume increase at the leading edge for pseudopod protrusion and a volume decrease at the trailing edge for retraction of the uropod (5Schwab A. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 280: F739-F747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell volume increases have been described in PMNs responding to CA gradients (6Rosengren S. Henson P.M. Worthen G.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1623-1632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but a requirement for anion transporters in this process has not previously been described.Although the role of cell volume regulation in PMN chemotaxis is unknown, the process is well characterized in response to hypotonic stress (7Lang F. Busch G.L. Volkl H. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 1998; 8: 1-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). As with all mammalian cells, ion flux and osmotic pressure gradients across the plasma membrane maintain cytoplasmic volume. Hypotonic challenge activates the swelling-induced chloride conductance, IClswell, as well as a K+ conductance (8Simchowitz L. Textor J.A. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C143-C155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These parallel effects mediate Cl- and K+ efflux, which drives water out of the cell, a process termed the regulatory cell volume decrease (RVD). PMNs exhibit a volume-activated chloride conductance similar to the IClswell found in other mammalian cells (9Stoddard J.S. Steinbach J.H. Simchowitz L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C156-C165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the electrophysiological characteristics of the IClswell have been well defined (10Cala A. Chloride channels and carriers in nerve, muscle and glioma cells. Plenium Press, New York1990Google Scholar), the molecular identity of the IClswell channel responsible for the RVD remains to be determined.Of significance, PMNs maintain an intracellular Cl- concentration (∼80 meq/liter) that is 4 times higher than would be expected for passive diffusion of Cl- at the estimated PMN membrane potential (∼-53 mV); this implies that accumulation of intracellular Cl- requires active energy expenditure (11Simchowitz L. De Weer P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1986; 88: 167-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Stimulation of PMNs by several different CAs, including formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLF), C5a, and interleukin-8, is associated with a marked Cl- efflux (12Shimizu Y. Daniels R.H. Elmore M.A. Finnen M.J. Hill M.E. Lackie J.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 1743-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), indicating a role for anion/Cl- flux during cell motility. Multiple Cl- transporters and channels have been functionally characterized in PMNs, including, among others, Ca2+-activated channels (13Krause K.H. Welsh M.J. The Journal of clinical investigation. 1990; 85: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the Na+-K+-2Cl- exchanger (11Simchowitz L. De Weer P. J. Gen. Physiol. 1986; 88: 167-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the Cl--HCO3 exchanger (14Simchowitz L. Textor J.A. Vogt S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C906-C915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and swelling-induced chloride channels (9Stoddard J.S. Steinbach J.H. Simchowitz L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C156-C165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently described the expression of and requirement for the voltage-gated chloride/proton antiporter, ClC-3 (chloride channel-3) (15Matsuda J.J. Filali M.S. Volk K.A. Collins M.M. Moreland J.G. Lamb F.S. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 294: C251-C262Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), in PMN function (1Moreland J.G. Davis A.P. Bailey G. Nauseef W.M. Lamb F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12277-12288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).We became interested in the role of ClC-3 in PMN motility after finding dramatic inhibition of trans-endothelial migration by niflumic acid, a nonselective inhibitor of ClC-3 function (1Moreland J.G.

PMNs treated with tamoxifen, which does not inhibit ClC-3 but does block the IClswell (15Matsuda J.J. Filali M.S. Volk K.A. Collins M.M. Moreland J.G. Lamb F.S. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 294: C251-C262Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), also demonstrate failure of transendothelial migration. In addition, PMNs with absent or impaired ClC-3 function have decreased phagocytosis compared with controls (1Moreland J.G. Davis A.P. Bailey G. Nauseef W.M. Lamb F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12277-12288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We have recently proposed that ClC-3 and IClswell are distinct anion pathways that are functionally linked, because ClC-3 participates in the regulation of IClswell by hydrogen peroxide (15Matsuda J.J. Filali M.S. Volk K.A. Collins M.M. Moreland J.G. Lamb F.S. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 294: C251-C262Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). ClC-3 is required for reactive oxygen species generation via the NADPH oxidase in vascular smooth muscle cells (16Miller Jr., F.J. Filali M. Huss G.J. Stanic B. Chamseddine A. Barna T.J. Lamb F.S. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 663-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and appears to play a regulatory role in priming-induced oxidant signaling in PMNs (17Moreland, J. G., Davis, A. P., Matsuda, J. J., Hook, J. S., Bailey, G., Nauseef, W. M., and Lamb, F. S. (2007) J. Biol. Chem.Google Scholar). Taken together, the observed deficits in PMN phagocytosis and transendothelial migration suggested that ClC-3 and IClswell are involved in cell motility and shape change.We hypothesized that ClC-3 and IClswell are required for normal PMN chemotaxis through regulation of cell volume and shape change. In order to investigate possible motility defects in PMNs with absent or impaired anion transporter function, we employed two complementary methods to analyze directed cell movement, the EZ-TAXIScan™ chemotaxis assay and the dynamic imaging analysis software (DIAS) chemotaxis assay. Murine Clcn3-/- and human PMNs treated with anion transporter inhibitors demonstrated impaired chemotaxis and failed to elongate and retract normally during stimulation with an fMLF spatial gradient. We conclude that anion transporter function plays an important role in PMN cell motility and that ClC-3 and IClswell have unique roles in PMN chemotaxis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) and Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline were obtained from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). HBSS-BG was prepared by adding 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 1% d-glucose to HBSS without divalent cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+) and was used for murine bone marrow isolation. EZ-TAXIScan™ buffer (EZT buffer) was composed of 20 mm HEPES and 0.1% human serum albumin in HBSS with divalent cations, pH 7.40. DIAS buffer was composed of 20 mm HEPES in HBSS with divalent cations, pH 7.40. Unless otherwise specified, reagents were obtained from Sigma. fMLF was diluted to 10 mm stock solution in DMSO and stored at -20 °C. Niflumic acid (NFA) was dissolved in DMSO and used at a final concentration of 1 mm, as described. Tamoxifen was dissolved in DMSO and used at concentrations of 1, 5, and 10 ;m, as described. The estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780 was purchased from Tocris Bioscience Co. (Ellisville, MO).Clcn3-/- Mice Generation—Generation of Clcn3-/- mice has been previously described (18Dickerson L.W. Bonthius D.J. Schutte B.C. Yang B. Barna T.J. Bailey M.C. Nehrke K. Williamson R.A. Lamb F.S. Brain Res. 2002; 958: 227-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). All animals had free access to food and water. Experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Iowa.Murine Bone Marrow Leukocyte Isolation—Murine bone marrow leukocyte isolation was performed using a modification of a previously described protocol, and cells were kept on ice prior to use (19Li S. Yamauchi A. Marchal C.C. Molitoris J.K. Quilliam L.A. Dinauer M.C. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 5043-5051Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were anesthetized using inhaled isoflurane, and cervical dislocation was performed. Skin was cleansed with alcohol and resected. Iliac, femur, and tibia were removed bilaterally, cleaned of debris, and washed in buffer twice, and bone marrow cavities were flushed with HBSS-BG. Marrow collections were pelleted at 450 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. PMNs were then resuspended in 45% Percoll-Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline solution and aspirated twice through a 22-gauge needle and syringe to break up dense bone marrow collections. PMN-Percoll solutions were layered atop a Percoll density gradient (prepared by underlaying 2 ml of 50, 55, and 62% and 3 ml of 81% Percoll-Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline solutions) and centrifuged at 1800 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. PMNs were collected from the 81-62% Percoll solution interface, washed twice with 10 ml of HBSS-BG (450 × g for 5 min at 4 °C), and resuspended in buffer. Cell counts were obtained from bone marrow isolates by hemocytometer, and differential analysis was performed using Diff Quick cytospin staining.Human PMN Purification—Human PMNs were isolated from the heparin anticoagulated venous blood of healthy consenting adults using standard techniques and in accordance with a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects at the University of Iowa. PMN purification included dextran sedimentation and Hypaque-Ficoll density gradient separation, followed by hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes as previously described (1Moreland J.G. Davis A.P. Bailey G. Nauseef W.M. Lamb F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12277-12288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Purified PMNs were resuspended in divalent cation-free HBSS and kept on ice prior to use in experimental assays.Cell Viability—Trypan blue exclusion was performed to determine cell viability after treatment with phloretin, as previously described (1Moreland J.G. Davis A.P. Bailey G. Nauseef W.M. Lamb F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12277-12288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Human PMNs were diluted to 2 × 106 PMN/ml and incubated with the inhibitor for 10, 30, and 60 min. Equal volumes of 0.4% trypan blue and treated cells were incubated together for 3 min before counting on a hemocytometer to assess the percentage of trypan blue-stained cells. A minimum of 400 cells/condition was counted.Chemotaxis Assays—For the EZ-TAXIScan™ and DIAS chemotaxis assays, we chose to use fMLF as the CA, because it has been studied extensively in both human and murine PMN chemotaxis. Although murine PMNs lack receptors for human PMN CAs, such as CXCR1, CXCL8 (interleukin-8 receptor), and neutrophil-activating peptide-2 receptors, both species have receptors responsible for sensing fMLF spatial gradients (20Lavigne M.C. Murphy P.M. Leto T.L. Gao J.L. Cellular immunology. 2002; 218: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 21Mestas J. Hughes C.C. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 2731-2738Crossref PubMed Scopus (2327) Google Scholar).EZ-TAXIScan™ Assays—EZ-TAXIScan™ assays (Effector Cell Institute, Tokyo) were performed at 37 °C using the assembled chemotaxis apparatus, composed of the chip holder and silicone chip perfused in EZT buffer, as described (22Kanegasaki S. Nomura Y. Nitta N. Akiyama S. Tamatani T. Goshoh Y. Yoshida T. Sato T. Kikuchi Y. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 282: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, PMNs were kept at a concentration of 1 × 107 in divalent cation-free HBSS and then diluted to 1 × 106/ml in EZT buffer (control) or treated with DMSO (vehicle control), NFA (1 mm), or tamoxifen (1, 5, or 10 ;m), and PMNs were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. In each of six separate channels, a PMN suspension (∼5 ;l of 1 × 106 PMN/ml) was injected with a 10-;m microsyringe, and cells were aligned along the edge of the chamber using the fluid flow technique. Buffer menisci were leveled and provided the osmotic pressure required to develop the spatial CA gradient. Based on our loading concentration curves, 1 ;l of fMLF was then injected in the stimulus chamber opposite to the PMN chamber, and the chemotactic spatial gradient was allowed to form. Data were recorded channel by channel at 1-s time lapse intervals between channels, using an XY stage robot (Torii Systems, Tokyo, Japan) and a high performance ×9 objective lens connected to a charge-coupled device camera, time lapse video recorder (Nikon, Kawasaki, Japan) with a coaxial episcopic illumination system (Watec America, Las Vegas, NV). The amount of fMLF loaded into the chemotaxis chamber (1 ;l) was rapidly dispersed and created a stable spatial CA gradient based on the osmotic pressure of the chamber. Uniformity and reproducibility of CA spatial gradients in the EZ-TAXIScan™ system have been described using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) diffusion as well as a computer simulation for small molecular weight peptides (22Kanegasaki S. Nomura Y. Nitta N. Akiyama S. Tamatani T. Goshoh Y. Yoshida T. Sato T. Kikuchi Y. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 282: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Chemotaxis assays were filmed for 60 min, with an image collection rate of 3 frames/min for each of the six channels. Movies were analyzed using Image J software. Cells moving at a velocity of less than 3 ;m/min were considered nonmotile and were not included in the calculation of average chemotaxis parameters, except in the case of 10 ;m tamoxifen treatment, after which nearly all the cells moved less than 3 ;m/min. Cells were manually tracked, and the percentage of motile cells from each experimental condition was calculated. The chemotactic index (CI) was calculated as the ratio of net path length toward the CA to total path length. Average instantaneous velocity for individual cells was also assessed using Image J software, with xy coordinates scaled for 1 ;m in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications. Chemotaxis parameters were computed using data obtained from individual cell tracks from at least five separate experiments, with at least 50 cells analyzed per condition.Two-dimensional DIAS Chemotaxis Assay—PMN behavior in an fMLF spatial gradient was evaluated as previously described (23Geiger J. Wessels D. Soll D.R. Cell Motil Cytoskeleton. 2003; 56: 27-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, 60 ;l of the above 1 × 106/ml PMN treatment solutions was applied to a 24 × 50-mm rectangular glass coverslip, and PMNs were allowed to adhere for 5 min at room temperature. Using a Zigmond chemotaxis chamber composed of a glass bridge with two bordering troughs, the coverslip was inverted onto the chamber with PMNs aligned over the chamber's bridge (24Varnum B. Soll D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1151-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 25Zigmond S.H. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 75: 606-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). One trough was filled with buffer alone, the other trough was filled with buffer containing fMLF, and the gradient was formed by completing the chamber with a second coverslip. Cells were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C to allow formation of the steep spatial gradient. PMNs were video-recorded for 10 min using bright field optics at ×25 magnification. Cell images were recorded directly onto the hard drive of a Macintosh G4 computer (Apple Computers, Cupertino, CA), using Quick Time or iStop Motion software with an analog to digital converter (ADVC55 converter from Canopus, Co., San Jose, CA) and two-dimensional DIAS software (26Soll D.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 163: 43-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 27Wessels D. Voss E. Von Bergen N. Burns R. Stites J. Soll D.R. Cell Motil Cytoskeleton. 1998; 41: 225-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 28Soll D.R. Voss E. Varnum-Finney B. Wessels D. J. Cell Biochem. 1988; 37: 177-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) at a rate of 15 frames/min (4-s intervals). As with the EZ-TAXIScan™ assay, cells moving at a velocity less than 3 ;m/min were considered nonmotile and were not included in the calculation of average cell morphology parameters, except in the case of 10 ;m tamoxifen treatment, which caused nearly all of the cells to move less than 3 ;m/min. Cell image perimeters were automatically traced, manually verified, and converted to ;-spline replacement images. Replacement images were used to compute the cell centroid, and measurements of cell motility and dynamic morphology were calculated based on the position of the centroid and the cell contour (26Soll D.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 163: 43-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 28Soll D.R. Voss E. Varnum-Finney B. Wessels D. J. Cell Biochem. 1988; 37: 177-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). “Percentage roundness” was computed by the formula 100 × 4< × (area/perimeter2). The computation “mean width” was the average of all chords perpendicular to the maximum length chord. “Maximum length” was computed as the longest chord between any two points on the cell perimeter. Radial deviation was computed as the ratio of the S.D. of the mean radial length to the mean radial length itself, expressed as a percentage. Mean radial length was computed as the average distance from individual boundary pixels on the cell image perimeter to the centroid of the cell image. Convexity and concavity were computed by drawing line segments connecting the vertices of the final shape. Angles of turning from one segment to the next were measured. Convexity was defined as the total sum of the positive turning angles, whereas concavity was defined as the absolute value of the sum of the negative turning angles. Difference pictures were generated by superimposing the outline at frame n - 3 over frame n. The area into which the cell expanded during that interval was color-coded green, the area from which it retracted was color-coded red, and the common area remained gray. Morphology parameters were computed using measurements obtained from individual cell tracings from at least three separate experiments, with at least 50 cells analyzed per condition.Analysis of Cell Swelling by Coulter Counter—Murine and human PMNs were analyzed for mean cell volume at room temperature using the Beckman Coulter Z2 Particle Count and Size Analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA) with a 100-;m orifice, calibrated to count all particles with a cell volume greater than 80 fl. Murine and human PMNs were maintained at a concentration of 5 × 103/ml to obtain cell size measurements. Initial measurements were obtained to show that human PMN anion transporter inhibitors did not cause an increase in cell size prior to the addition of water. Murine Clcn3+/+ and Clcn3-/- PMNs and human PMNs treated with DMSO (control), 1 mm NFA, and 100 ;m phloretin were then subjected to hypotonic challenge with the addition of sterile water at 25 or 50% of the final volume, and cell size was followed for 35 min. The mean cell volume was calculated for each cell population using the Coulter Channelyzer C1000 with Accucomp software and normalized to base-line volumes.Analysis of Cell Swelling by Flow Cytometry—Murine and human PMNs were analyzed for forward scatter contours (FSC) by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences), as described (1Moreland J.G. Davis A.P. Bailey G. Nauseef W.M. Lamb F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12277-12288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Human PMNs were maintained at 1 × 106/ml to obtain base-line FSC histograms. Following determination of base-line forward and side scatter profiles for 2 min, DMSO-treated control and NFA-treated PMNs in isotonic buffer were subjected to hypotonic challenge with the addition of sterile water at 25% of the final volume. Forward and side scatter histograms were then obtained at 30 s posthypotonic challenge, followed by 1-min intervals for 10 min and then 10-min intervals up to 30 min. Murine PMNs were maintained at a concentration of 6 × 105/ml in HBSS with divalent cations for 2 min to obtain base-line FSC contours. Murine PMNs were then subjected to 25% hypotonic challenge with the addition of sterile water. Murine cell swelling was analyzed with a kinetic program that permitted continuous measurement of FSC at 1-s intervals for 18 min. At each time point analyzed, individual FSC profiles were normalized as a percentage of base-line FSC measurements and averaged across experiments.Analysis of fMLF Receptor Expression by Flow Cytometry—PMN fMLF receptor surface expression was determined by FACS analysis using a described protocol (29Liu L. Harbecke O. Elwing H. Follin P. Karlsson A. Dahlgren C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2463-2468PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, murine and human PMNs were stimulated with fMLF (100 nm) or were maintained at rest. Human PMNs were also stimulated with the calcium ionophore ionomycin (500 nm) to mobilize surface expression of the fMLF receptor as a positive control. PMNs were then fixed for 30 min in ice-cold paraformaldehyde (4% (w/v) in phosphate-buffered saline) and washed. To determine surface expression of the fMLF receptor (fMLF-R), an FITC-conjugated, formylated peptide (FITC-FNLPNTL; 10 nm final concentration) was added to a PMN suspension (1 × 106 of paraformaldehyde-fixed cells in 400 ;l) with or without an excess amount (5 ;m) of unlabeled fMLF, which inhibited FITC-FNLPNTL binding. Unlabeled fMLF-treated samples were incubated at 22 °C for 15 min to equilibrate. FITC-FNLPNTL was then added and allowed to incubate at 22 °C for 30 min, with no washing performed after labeling. The amount of FITC-FNLPNTL specifically bound to the PMNs (corresponding to the amount of surface fMLF-R expression) was determined by flow cytometry. fMLF-R surface density was calculated using the geometric mean intensity of FITC signal of fMLF-R ligand-treated PMNs compared with untreated PMNs.Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were performed by Student's t test, Mann-Whitney test, or two-way analysis of variance with the Bonferroni test to analyze data with unequal variance between groups as appropriate. A probability level of 0.05 was considered significant. Percentage motility of PMN populations was assessed using <2 analysis.RESULTSAbsence of ClC-3 Impaired Chemotaxis in Murine PMN—Based on our findings that Clcn3-/- PMNs have defective phagocytosis and that inhibition of anion transporter function in human PMNs impairs phagocytosis and trans-endothelial migration (1Moreland J.G. Davis A.P. Bailey G. Nauseef W.M. Lamb F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12277-12288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), we reasoned that ClC-3 may be required for normal PMN chemotaxis. We used the EZ-TAXIScan™ system to assess chemotaxis in murine Clcn3+/+ and Clcn3-/- PMNs. Cell isolates prepared from bone marrow of Clcn3+/+ and Clcn3-/- mice were 85 ± 4% and 88 ± 3% PMNs, respectively, and the remaining cells were evenly distributed between lymphocyte and monocyte lineages, (n = 6 experiments with paired mice, 100 cells/sample). We studied PMN chemotaxis in response to fMLF, a prototypical CA and bacterial peptide analog, since it has been widely characterized in both human and murine PMN chemotaxis. Because no prior chemotaxis studies had been published using murine PMNs in the EZ-TAXIScan™ system, we performed a dose-response analysis across a wide range of loading concentrations of fM"

Recent work has revealed essential roles for Ser/Thr phosphatases, such as protein phosphatase-1 (PP1), in splicing, but how these phosphatases are regulated is largely unknown. We show that nuclear inhibitor of PP1 (NIPP1), a major PP1 interactor in the vertebrate nucleus, recruits PP1 to Sap155 (spliceosome-associated protein 155), an essential component of U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles, and promotes Sap155 dephosphorylation. C-terminally truncated NIPP1 (NIPP1-ΔC) formed a hyper-active holoenzyme with PP1, rendering PP1 minimally phosphorylated on an inhibitory site. Forced expression of NIPP1-WT and -ΔC resulted in slight and severe decreases in Sap155 hyperphosphorylation, respectively, and the latter was accompanied with inhibition of splicing. PP1 overexpression produced similar effects, whereas small interfering RNA-mediated NIPP1 knockdown enhanced Sap155 hyperphosphorylation upon okadaic acid treatment. NIPP1 did not inhibit but rather stimulated Sap155 dephosphorylation by PP1 in vitro through facilitating Sap155/PP1 interaction. Further analysis revealed that NIPP1 specifically recognizes hyperphosphorylated Sap155 thorough its Forkhead-associated domain and dissociates from Sap155 after dephosphorylation by associated PP1. Thus NIPP1 works as a molecular sensor for PP1 to recognize phosphorylated Sap155. Pre-mRNA splicing entails reversible phosphorylation of spliceosomal proteins.

Thus NIPP1 works as a molecular sensor for PP1 to recognize phosphorylated Sap155. Pre-mRNA splicing is an essential step for expression of most genes in metazoans. Intron excision from a nascent transcript is achieved by pre-mRNA splicing catalyzed by the spliceosome, a macromolecular complex consisting of five small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) 4The abbreviations used are:snRNPsmall nuclear ribonucleoprotein particleRNPribonucleoproteinPP1protein phosphatase-1NIPP1nuclear inhibitor of PP1siRNAsmall interfering RNAPBSphosphate-buffered salineDoxdoxycyclineRNAiRNA interferenceOAokadaic acidPPasephosphataseHTOHeLa-Tet-OffRPARNase protection assayFHAForkhead-associatedRTreverse transcriptionFHAForkhead-associated and a large number of non-snRNP proteins. Spliceosome assembly is an ordered process that includes stepwise recruitment of U1, U2, U5, and U4/6 snRNPs on a pre-mRNA and sequential formation of complex E → A/B → B* → C. The activated B* spliceosome catalyzes step I of splicing, whereas the C complex catalyzes step II. During and after splicing, spliceosome components dissociate and are recycled for further rounds of splicing. Spliceosome assembly/disassembly and splicing catalysis are thought to be regulated in part by reversible phosphorylation of spliceosomal proteins (1Misteli T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R198-R200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 2Hastings M.L. Krainer A.R. Curr. Opin.

Sap155, also known as Sf3b1 or Sf3b155, is a component of the Sf3b and becomes hyperphosphorylated concomitant with or just after the first catalytic step of splicing in vitro (4Wang C. Chua K. Seghezzi W. Lees E. Gozani O. Reed R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1409-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). A recent study reveals that Sf3a/b proteins are destabilized and dissociate from the RNP core of the activated spliceosome during the transition from the B to C complex (5Bessonov S. Anokhina M. Will C.L. Urlaub H. Lührmann R. Nature. 2008; 452: 746-750Crossref Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Although Sf3a and Sf3b are essential early in the splicing reaction, they are apparently not required for the second catalytic step. Currently, it is not known what triggers exchange of proteins during spliceosome transitions. Shi et al. (6Shi Y. Reddy B. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 819-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) reported that the protein Ser/Thr phosphatase (PPase) type 1 (PP1) and/or type 2A (PP2A) are essential for splicing in vitro, in particular, at the second catalytic step. They also observed that Sap155 and U5-116k are potential substrates of these two PPases, suggesting the importance of dephosphorylation of spliceosomal proteins in spliceosome structural rearrangement. However, how PP1 and PP2A regulate phosphorylation of spliceosomal proteins is not well understood. Both PP1 and PP2A are often targeted to specific substrates by binding partners. For example, PP1 is regulated in vivo primarily by interaction with various regulatory subunits that dictate subcellular localization, substrate specificity, or enzymatic activity (7Ceulemans H. Bollen M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). In some cases, regulatory subunits are phosphorylated/dephosphorylated, resulting in activity changes that modulate PP1 activity in response to environmental cues such as hormones and second messengers (8Eto M. Senba S. Morita F. Yazawa M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 9Greengard P.

Phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinases lower PP1 activity in vitro and vivo in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and in human cells (11Dohadwala M. da Cruz e Silva E.F. Hall F.L. Williams R.T.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5310-5318Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The PP1 phosphorylation site is highly conserved among species and has been mapped to the C terminus. Studies in yeast and human cells suggest that PP1 phosphorylation is essential for proper cell cycle progression (13Berndt N. Dohadwala M. Liu C.W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Liu C.W. Wang R.H. Dohadwala M. Schönthal A.H. Villa-Moruzzi E. Berndt N. J. Biol.

A major nuclear interaction partner of PP1 in vertebrate cells is the nuclear inhibitor of PP1 (NIPP1) (7Ceulemans H. Bollen M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of the Nipp1 gene in mice results in embryonic lethality, indicating an essential role in vivo (15Van Eynde A. Nuytten M. Dewerchin M. Schoonjans L. Keppens S. Beullens M. Moons L. Carmeliet P. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5863-5874Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). NIPP1 has two PP1 binding regions as follows: a central domain containing a so-called RVXF-motif, which represents a high affinity binding motif and a low affinity binding region mapped to the NIPP1 C terminus (16Egloff M.

Bollen M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The precise function of the latter interaction is not yet understood. Previous studies suggest the importance of NIPP1 in regulating pre-mRNA splicing. NIPP1 localizes in nuclear speckles, domains rich in splicing machinery components. Several splicing-related proteins such as Cdc5L, SAP155, and MELK have been identified as potential ligands of the Forkhead-associated (FHA) domain of NIPP1 (18Boudrez A. Beullens M. Groenen P.

Chem. 2002; 277: 19855-19860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) reported that NIPP1 physically associates with spliceosomes through the FHA domain and that a dominant negative form of NIPP1 blocks the B to C transition of spliceosome assembly in the HeLa cell nuclear extracts by an unknown mechanism. Although there is a report that NIPP1 protein lacking the RVXF motif partially compromises splicing in vitro, data from splicing assays using HeLa nuclear extracts are contradictory (23Beullens M. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19855-19860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 24Trinkle-Mulcahy L. Ajuh P. Prescott A. Claverie-Martin F. Cohen S. Lamond A.I. Cohen P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 157-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus both the mode of NIPP1 action and the potential role of PP1/NIPP1 interaction in pre-mRNA splicing remain obscure. To analyze function of NIPP1 in pre-mRNA splicing, we re-evaluated the physical and functional association among pre-mRNA/RNA, NIPP1, and PP1 in vivo using cell-based assays. We show that NIPP1 works as a targeting subunit that directs PP1 to dephosphorylate Sap155, not as an inhibitor of PP1. Our results suggest a regulatory mechanism ensuring proper Sap155 phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycles during pre-mRNA splicing. Antibodies—Anti-U5-116k antibody was kindly provided by Dr. H.

The BseRI-BstXI region of pTRE-β-globin, encompassing the β-globin gene from the 3′-half of exon 1 to the 5′-half of exon 3, was replaced with a corresponding BseRI-BstXI fragment of β-globin cDNA derived from pTRE-β-globin; the sequence verified, and the resulting plasmid was designated pTRE-intronless-β-globin. Its nucleotide sequence is identical to that of pTRE-β-globin except intron 1 and 2 sequences are excluded. NIPP1 expression plasmids were constructed by subcloning cDNAs encoding wild-type or mutant forms of rat NIPP1 (29Kim S.E. Ishita A. Shima H. Nakamura K. Yamada Y. Ogawa K. Kikuchi K. Int. J. Oncol. 2000; 16: 751-755PubMed Google Scholar) into pCMV-FLAG2 (Sigma). Myc-PP1 constructs are described elsewhere (30Mitsuhashi S. Shima H. Tanuma N. Matsuura N. Takekawa M. Urano T. Kataoka T. Ubukata M. Kikuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 82-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa-Tet-Off (HTO) cells (Clontech) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10! fetal calf serum and 250 μg/ml geneticin. Transfections were done using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. For stable transfection, cDNAs encoding FLAG-tagged wild-type or mutant NIPP1 were subcloned into the pTRE vector (Clontech). HTO cells in 10-cm dishes were transfected with 10 μg of pTRE-NIPP1-WT or -ΔC with 0.5 μg of pTK-Hyg (Clontech). Drug-resistant clones were selected in 200 μg/ml hygromycin, 250 μg/ml geneticin, and 1 μg/ml Dox. Two weeks later, ∼150 independent clones for each construct were screened for expression of exogenous NIPP1 by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody. Several clones for each construct (four for WT NIPP1 and three for NIPP1-ΔC) exhibited low and high levels of FLAG-NIPP1 proteins in the presence and absence of Dox, respectively, and were selected for further experiments. After establishment, stable clones were maintained in medium containing 5–10 ng/ml Dox. In Vitro and in Vivo Splicing Assays—In vitro splicing was performed as described (23Beullens M. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19855-19860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). RNP immunoprecipitation assays were performed essentially as described (31Niranjanakumari S. Lasda E. Brazas R. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Methods (San Diego). 2002; 26: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) with slight modification. Cells were fixed in 0.75! formaldehyde/PBS at room temperature for 10 min, washed twice in PBS, and harvested. Cells were lysed in 1 ml of RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10! glycerol, 0.1! SDS, 1! Triton X-100, and 0.1! deoxycholate) by sonication (Sonifier 450, Branson, Danbury, CT). 50 μl each of lysate was stored on ice as “Input,” and the rest was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG-agarose beads at room temperature for 2 h. Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed four times with gentle rotation for 5 min, followed by elution of RNPs with FLAG peptide (Sigma). “Inputs” and eluates were heated to 75 °C for 90 min to reverse cross-links and phenol-extracted twice. RNAs were ethanol-precipitated using yeast tRNA and Glyco-blue co-precipitants (Ambion) as carrier and treated with RNase-free DNase (DNA-free turbo, Ambion). RNA was reverse-transcribed using SuperScript III RTase (Invitrogen) using the RT primer 5′-GTGCAGCTTGTCACAGTGCAG-3′. PCR was undertaken using standard protocols with Ex Taq-HS polymerase (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan) and the following primers for β-globin: sense, 5′-ATGGTGCATCTGACTCCTGAG-3′; antisense, 5′-ACTAAAGGCACCGAGCACTTTCTTG-3′. To analyze effects of NIPP1 on splicing rates, HTO cells in 10-cm dishes were transfected with 7.5 μg of NIPP1 expression plasmids with 2.5 μg of pTRE-β-globin. Four hours later, cells were split and further cultured without Dox for 20 h. At indicated time points after Dox addition, cells were harvested, and total RNA was isolated for Northern blot analysis with a 32P-labeled β-globin probe. For RPAs, antisense riboprobes complementary to exon 1/intron 1 or exon 2/intron 2 boundaries of β-globin gene were synthesized by in vitro transcription using MAXI script (Ambion, Austin, TX) and T7 polymerase. Hybridization and RNase digestions were performed using the RPA III (Ambion) kit according to the manufacturer's instruction. Protected RNAs were subjected to denaturing PAGE and visualized using the FLA system (Fuji Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in RIPA or SDS buffer (125 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 1! SDS) by sonication using a “Bio-ruptor” sonicator (CosmoBio, Tokyo, Japan). For co-immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 0.2! Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, and aprotinin) by sonication. Lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG-agarose or anti-Myc-agarose (Sigma) for 3–4 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with lysis buffer without protease inhibitors, and immunoblotted. Immunohistochemistry—Cells grown on collagen-coated coverslips were fixed in PBS containing 3.7! formaldehyde for 10 min. After permeabilization with 0.2! Triton X-100, cells were incubated in PBS containing 5! (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.5 μg/ml anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody overnight at 4 °C. Immunoreactants were further visualized using Alexa Fluor488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Invitrogen), and images were acquired using a Pascal confocal laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss). 32P-Orthophosphate Labeling—Stable clones were cultured in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml Dox for 24 h and then in phosphate-free medium (Invitrogen) containing 10! fetal calf serum (dialyzed three times against 100 volumes of Hepes buffer) and 32P-orthophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 1 mCi/ml for an additional 4 h. Cells were harvested, lysed by sonication using the Bio-ruptor sonicating machine, and subjected to immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblot analysis and autoradiography using the FLA system. In Vitro De-phosphorylation Experiments—HTO cells were lysed in buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10! EDTA, 0.1! Triton X-100) by sonication. Lysates were incubated with or without either PP1 (a recombinant PP1α isoform; Calbiochem) or NIPP1-PP1 holoenzyme at 30 °C for 10–60 min. The NIPP1-PP1 holoenzyme was constituted by preincubation of recombinant PP1α with His-NIPP1 at several ratios on ice for 20 min in Tris-buffered saline. His-NIPP1 was expressed in Escherichia coli using the pET system (Novagen, San Diego, CA) and purified using TALON beads (Clontech) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Sap155 was immunopurified from lysates of HeLa cells treated with 100 nm okadaic acid for 6–8 h using anti-Sap155 monoclonal antibody-conjugated agarose. Phosphatase Assay—Immunoprecipitates with anti-FLAG-agarose were eluted twice by incubating beads with 200 μg/ml FLAG peptide. Eluates were subjected to a phosphatase assay and Western blotting. PP1 activity measurement was as described (26Isono K. Mizutani-Koseki Y. Komori T. Schmidt-Zachmann M.S. Koseki H. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 536-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). RNAi Experiments—siRNA duplexes against human NIPP1 (Stealth RNAi) were purchased from Invitrogen (HSS143426 and HSS143427). Stealth RNAi Negative control Medium GC duplex (Invitrogen) served as control. siRNA transfection was undertaken using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions at final siRNA concentrations of 5 nm in culture. Overlay Assay—Sap155 was immunoprecipitated from HeLa cell lysates treated with 100 nm okadaic acid (OA) for 6–8 h, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5! bovine serum albumin in PBS and reacted with solutions supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C for 1 h. Membranes were washed with PBS, 0.1! Tween plus phosphatase inhibitors at 4 °C for 5 min twice and then UV-irradiated to fix complexes. Statistical Analysis—One-way analysis of variance combined with Tukey's test was used to analyze data with unequal variance between each group. A probability level of 0.05 was considered significant. Physical and Functional Interaction between NIPP1 and Pre-mRNA Splicing in Intact Cells—To elucidate interaction between NIPP1 and the spliceosome in vivo, we performed an RNP immunoprecipitation assay (31Niranjanakumari S. Lasda E. Brazas R. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Methods (San Diego). 2002; 26: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Cells transfected with FLAG-NIPP1 (Fig. 1A) together with the β-globin reporter plasmid pTRE-β-globin were treated with formaldehyde, recovered, and lysed. RNPs containing FLAG-NIPP1 were immunoprecipitated using an anti-FLAG antibody. The cross-links were reversed, and the immunoprecipitated RNAs were detected by RT-PCR (“Minus RT” controls are presented as supplemental Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 1B, both unspliced and spliced β-globin RNAs co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-NIPP1-WT. We next examined interaction between NIPP1 mutants (Fig. 1A) and β-globin pre-mRNA/mRNAs. Similar results were obtained with NIPP1-R53A, which has a nonfunctional FHA domain (Fig. 1C). NIPP1-V201A/F203A (NIPP1-RATA), which is deficient in PP1 binding (Fig. 1D), reproducibly co-immunoprecipitated pre-mRNA more efficiently than did NIPP1-WT. NIPP1-ΔC, which lacks the C-terminal 22 amino acids constituting a second PP1-binding region, interacted almost exclusively with unspliced pre-mRNA. This observation correlated with accumulation of unspliced reporter pre-mRNA in cell lysates, as detected by RT-PCR (“total RNA” in Fig. 1B), suggesting inhibition of splicing by that mutant form of NIPP1. Because transcription and “post-transcriptional” RNA processing are functionally coupled (32Maniatis T. Reed R. Nature. 2002; 416: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar), the effects of NIPP1-ΔC on splicing might represent an indirect transcriptional effect. To distinguish between these possibilities, we repeated the assays using a corresponding intron-less reporter gene. As shown in Fig. 1E, NIPP1-ΔC and other NIPP1 constructs did not significantly affect mRNA levels of the intron-less reporter, suggesting that the effect of NIPP1-ΔC on splicing is specific for a splicing-related event(s) or for splicing itself. Intriguingly, all NIPP1 variants co-precipitated mRNA derived from the intron-less reporter, consistent with a recent report that the U2 snRNP is recruited to both intron-containing transcripts and transcripts of intron-less genes, such as histone genes, to facilitate 3′-processing (33Friend K. Lovejoy A.F. Steitz J.A. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 240-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To further delineate effects of mutant NIPP1, we took advantage of the pTRE-β-globin reporter, in which the transcription is regulated by a TRE sequence upstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter (Fig. 1B). When introduced into cells expressing the Tet-repressor (Tet-Off cell lines), de novo transcription from the reporter is specifically and rapidly suppressed by the stable tetracycline analogue Dox (28Yamashita A. Ohnishi T. Kashima I. Taya Y. Ohno S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2215-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis showed that expression of NIPP1-ΔC decreased steady-state levels of β-globin mRNA, whereas expression of NIPP1-WT had produced little if no effect (Fig. 2A). A band likely representing β-globin pre-mRNA (indicated by asterisk in Fig. 2A) migrated more slowly than β-globin mRNA and was more abundant in cells transfected with NIPP1-ΔC compared with mock- or NIPP1-WT-transfected cells. To confirm this observation, we performed an RPA (Fig. 2C; see supplemental Fig. 2 for assay design) and found that in mock-transfected cells levels of unspliced β-globin pre-mRNA were rapidly decreased after Dox-mediated block of de novo transcription of the reporter gene, as seen in Fig. 2C. This decrease is likely due to splicing of the reporter pre-mRNA. Strikingly, unspliced pre-mRNA was more abundant in cells transfected with NIPP1-ΔC, whereas mature spliced mRNA levels were decreased (Fig. 2C). Additionally, the half-life of unspliced pre-mRNA in NIPP1-ΔC-transfected cells appeared much longer than that seen in mock- and NIPP1-WT-transfected cells (Fig. 2D). As described, NIPP1-RATA associated with unspliced pre-mRNA more efficiently than did NIPP1-WT, whereas NIPP1-RATA did not accumulate unspliced pre-mRNA, in contrast to NIPP1-ΔC (Fig. 1B). It is noteworthy that decay of unspliced pre-mRNA of NIPP1-RATA-transfected cells was slightly slower than that seen in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 2, C and D). Taken together, these results demonstrate physical and functional association between NIPP1 and pre-mRNA splicing and suggest the importance of the NIPP1 C terminus and interaction between NIPP1 and PP1 in NIPP1-mediated regulation of splicing in vivo. When we performed an in vitro splicing assay in HeLa nuclear extracts, NIPP1-ΔC showed no effect as reported (Ref. 23Beullens M. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19855-19860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar and data not shown). Based on these findings, we chose to evaluate NIPP1 function in cell-based rather than in vitro experiments. Characterization of Splicing Inhibition by NIPP1-ΔC—To understand functional differences between NIPP1-ΔC and wild-type protein, we first investigated NIPP1-ΔC subcellular localization and found it indistinguishable from that of NIPP1-WT (Fig. 3A). We next prepared NIPP1 constructs containing point mutations in addition to the ΔC deletion to investigate domain requirements for splicing inhibition (Fig. 3B). The effects of these mutations on splicing of the β-globin construct were determined by analyzing accumulation of unspliced pre-mRNA. An RPA analysis revealed that NIPP1-ΔC, but not NIPP1-R53A/ΔC or NIPP1-RATA/ΔC, inhibited pre-mRNA splicing of the reporter gene (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that inhibition of splicing by NIPP1-ΔC requires both a functional FHA domain and interaction with PP1. Neither the R53A nor RATA mutation alone promoted accumulation of unspliced pre-mRNA (Fig. 1B and data not shown). Because splicing inhibition by NIPP1-ΔC requires interaction with PP1, we compared NIPP1-WT and -ΔC mutant in terms of association with PP1. NIPP1-WT and NIPP1-ΔC were immunoprecipitated, and PP1 activities were evaluated using phosphorylase a as a substrate. PP1 activity complexed with NIPP1-ΔC was reproducibly higher than that seen with NIPP1-WT (Fig. 4A). Similar amounts of PP1 in immunoprecipitates of NIPP1-WT or -ΔC were confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-PP1 antibody (Fig. 4B). We reasoned that differences seen in Fig. 4A could be due to potential modification of the catalytic subunit PP1. It is well established that PP1 is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase(s) on a critical Thr residue in the C terminus (Thr-320 of PP1α) and inactivated (11Dohadwala M. da Cruz e Silva E.F. Hall F.L. Williams R.T. Carbonaro-Hall D.A. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. Berndt N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6408-6412Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 12Yamano H. Ishii K. Yanagida M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5310-5318Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). NIPP1-WT or NIPP1-ΔC was immunoprecipitated from transfected cells, and the inhibitory phosphorylation of endogenous PP1 associated with NIPP1 was examined and compared. Strikingly, PP1 co-immunoprecipitated with NIPP1-WT was highly phosphorylated on the inhibitory site, whereas PP1 in association with NIPP-ΔC was minimally phosphorylated (Fig. 4B). Thus, the higher specific activity of PP1 associated with NIPP1-ΔC could be due to lower levels of inhibitory phosphorylation of PP1, rendering it constitutively active. At present, we cannot differentiate the levels of inhibitory phosphorylation in each PP1 isoforms because the phospho-Thr-320-PP1α antibody may also cross-react with other isoforms phosphorylated on the corresponding residue. Nevertheless, given that NIPP1 preferentially associates with PP1α (see below), it is likely that phospho-PP1 co-immunoprecipitating with NIPP1 is primarily PP1α.

We report that this pathway is activated and essential for viability under growth conditions that alter both the abundance and pattern of synthesis and turnover of membrane phospholipids, particularly phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylcholine.

Given the relationship of PKC signaling with ER stress, the question arises as to whether the CWI-MAPK pathway is sensitive to membrane lipid composition. In mammalian cells, PKC itself is directly activated by binding of 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) to a highly homologous cysteine-rich C domain (C1 domain) found in many PKC isoforms (10Levin D.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 262-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). DAG produced by phospholipase C-dependent hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (33Becker K.P. Hannun Y.A. Cell. Mol.

Although S. cerevisiae Pkc1p contains the conserved C1 domain (41Schmitz H.P. Jockel J. Block C. Heinisch J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), attempts to explore DAG activation of PKC signaling in S. cerevisiae have produced only negative or inconclusive results. Several in vitro studies found that purified yeast Pkc1p is not activated by DAG, phorbol esters, or phospholipids (42Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Friedli L. Payton M.A. Paravicini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16821-16828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Watanabe M. Chen C.Y. Levin D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16829-16836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, other lipids may play indirect roles in PKC activation in yeast via the Rho1 GTPase, the master regulator of this pathway. Production of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate at the plasma membrane recruits Rom2p, the GTPase exchange factor for Rho1p, which leads to PKC activation (44Audhya A. Emr S.D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 593-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In addition, the mitochondrial anionic phospholipids, phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin, appear to regulate PKC signaling, possibly by affecting Rho1p membrane association (45Zhong Q. Li G. Gvozdenovic-Jeremic J. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15946-15953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). At present, however, a direct connection between PKC activation and lipid homeostasis has not been firmly established in yeast. To explore the linkage between lipid metabolism and PKC signaling, we investigated the sensitivity of the CWI-MAPK pathway to the phospholipid precursors inositol and choline. The presence of these precursors in the medium of actively growing yeast profoundly alters both the abundance as well as the pattern of synthesis and turnover of membrane phospholipids, neutral lipids, and sphingolipids (46Kelley M.J. Bailis A.M. Henry S.A. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18078-18084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Gaspar M.L. Aregullin M.A. Jesch S.A. Henry S.A. J. Biol.

Nature. 2005; 433: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These changes in lipid metabolism are accompanied by alterations in the expression levels of hundreds of genes (31Jesch S.A. Zhao X. Wells M.T. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9106-9118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 32Jesch S.A. Liu P. Zhao X. Wells M.T. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24070-24083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), suggesting regulation by multiple signaling pathways. In this study, we report that mutants in the CWI-MAPK pathway, including pkc1Δ, bck1Δ, and mpk1Δ, exhibit an inositol auxotrophy phenotype associated with alterations in phospholipid metabolism, particularly when choline is present in the growth medium. Growth in the absence of inositol results in Mpk1p phosphorylation and induction of CWI-MAPK target gene expression, which is absent in mpk1Δ and rlm1Δ cells. Surprisingly, mpk1Δ cells exhibit normal derepression of INO1 and other inositol-regulated genes that are repressed by Opi1p. However, the mpk1Δ mutant exhibits aberrant phospholipid metabolism, including defective phosphatidylcholine (PC) turnover and accumulation. Our results indicate that PKC signaling is activated by growth in the absence of inositol and is essential for lipid homeostasis and cell viability. Media and Growth Conditions—Yeast strains were maintained on liquid YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 2% glucose) or chemically defined synthetic complete media described elsewhere (31Jesch S.A. Zhao X. Wells M.T. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9106-9118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Where indicated, synthetic complete media were supplemented with 75 ;m inositol (I+) and/or 1 mm choline (C+). Solid media maintained the same composition plus 2% agar. Where indicated, 1 m sorbitol or 0.5 m KCl was added as osmotic support. Yeast strains were grown at 30 °C unless otherwise indicated. Yeast Strains—S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are described in Table 1. The mpk1Δ opi1Δ double mutant strain LN106 was constructed using standard tetrad analysis by crossing MRY2062 with DL455. The other opi1Δ double mutant strains MRY2061, MRY2062, and MRY2065 were constructed by PCR-mediated gene replacement of the entire OPI1 open reading frame in DL253, DL100, and DL376 using the template plasmid pFA6-kanMX4 (49Wach A.

https://openalex.org/W2119855092,"The endoplasmic reticulum chaperone GRP78/BIP plays a central role in the prosurvival machinery, and its enhanced expression has been implicated in drug resistance, carcinogenesis, and metastasis. E2F1, as part of an antitumor safeguard mechanism, promotes apoptosis regardless of functional p53. Using cells that are defective in p53, we show that E2F1 represses GRP78/BIP at the transcriptional level, and this requires its DNA binding domain. Analysis of human GRP78/BIP promoter reporter constructs revealed that the region between -371 and -109 of the proximal promoter contains major E2F1-responsive elements. Toward understanding the underlying mechanism of this regulation, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation and gel shift assays, demonstrating that E2F1 directly binds to GC-rich regions in the distal GC-box and endoplasmic reticulum stress response element -126 by interfering with the binding of positive regulatory proteins Sp1 and TFII-I of the ER stress response element-binding factor complex. We further show that TFII-I, which is required for optimal stress induction of GRP78/BIP, is suppressed by E2F1 on the protein level. Finally, our studies suggest a molecular link between the inhibition of GRP78/BIP and E2F1-mediated chemosensitization of tumor cells, underscoring its relevance for cancer treatment. Together, the data provide a new mechanism for the incompletely understood tumor suppressor function of E2F1. The endoplasmic reticulum chaperone GRP78/BIP plays a central role in the prosurvival machinery, and its enhanced expression has been implicated in drug resistance, carcinogenesis, and metastasis. E2F1, as part of an antitumor safeguard mechanism, promotes apoptosis regardless of functional p53. Using cells that are defective in p53, we show that E2F1 represses GRP78/BIP at the transcriptional level, and this requires its DNA binding domain.

Together, the data provide a new mechanism for the incompletely understood tumor suppressor function of E2F1. Resistance to chemotherapy remains a major obstacle for the treatment of malignant tumors. The complexity of drug resistance in human cancer strongly suggests the involvement of multiple pathways. One mechanism, both intrinsic and acquired, is the result of genetic alterations within cancer cells. Another mechanism may result from environmental conditions that occur naturally in solid tumors (1Brown J.M. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1408-1416PubMed Google Scholar). Hypoxia and glucose starvation caused by poor vascularization of tumors represent physiological endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 4The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ERSE, ER stress response element; 4-OHT, 4-hydroxytamoxifen; TA, transactivation; Rb, retinoblastoma protein. stress activating the unfolded protein response (2Feldman D.E. Chauhan V. Koong A.C. Mol. Cancer Res. 2005; 3: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 3Ni M. Lee A.S. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3641-3651Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). A major unfolded protein response target is GRP78 (glucose-regulated protein 78), also known as BIP, whose induction is critical for control of protein folding and assembly, targeting of misfolded proteins for proteasome degradation, ER Ca2+ binding, and regulation of the activity of ER stress transducers, such as IRE1, PERK, and ATF6, through a binding-release mechanism (4Haze K.

J. 2002; 366: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). GRP78/BIP also acts as an apoptotic regulator by protecting cells against ER stress-induced cell death. Overexpression of GRP78/BIP blocks cleavage of procaspase-7 and -12 in its active form, inhibits stimulation of proapoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family, such as BIK and BAX, and prevents cytochrome c release from the mitochondria (7Fu Y. Li J. Lee A.S. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 3734-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). GRP78/BIP is highly up-regulated in various cancer cells and human tumors, including breast, lung, liver, prostate, colon, and gastric cancers, correlating with malignancy, metastasis, and drug resistance (8Daneshmand S. Quek M.L. Lin E. Lee C. Cote R.J. Hawes D. Cai J. Groshen S. Lieskovsky G. Skinner D.G. Lee A.S. Pinski J. Hum. Pathol. 2007; 38: 1547-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 9Lee E. Nichols P. Spicer D. Groshen S. Yu M.C. Lee A.S. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 7849-7853Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Suppression of GRP78/BIP through small interfering RNA sensitizes human cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drug-mediated cell death and inhibits tumor progression in vivo (10Dong D. Ko B. Baumeister P. Swenson S. Costa F. Markland F. Stiles C. Patterson J.B. Bates S.E. Lee A.S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 5785-5791Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 11Sugawara S. Takeda K. Lee A. Dennert G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 6001-6005PubMed Google Scholar). The intensity of GRP78/BIP expression is generally associated with survival and clinical recurrence in prostate cancer patients (8Daneshmand S. Quek M.L. Lin E. Lee C. Cote R.J. Hawes D. Cai J. Groshen S. Lieskovsky G. Skinner D.G. Lee A.S. Pinski J. Hum. Pathol. 2007; 38: 1547-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Thus, inhibition of GRP78/BIP expression represents a novel goal for successful cancer treatment. The ER stress-induced activation of GRP78/BIP is primarily mediated by multiple copies of the ER stress response element (ERSE) with a consensus sequence of CCAAT(N9)CCACG located upstream of the TATA element, although part of the response may also be attributed to ERSE-independent pathways (12Roy B. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Interaction of NF-Y/CBF and YY1 with the two end-flanking motifs of the ERSE has been well characterized (13Li W.W. Hsiung Y. Zhou Y. Roy B. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 14Mori K. Cell. 2000; 101: 451-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). The inner nine-nucleotide sequence in most ERSEs, which is required for maximal stress-dependent transactivation, is GC-rich (12Roy B. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 15Parker R. Phan T. Baumeister P. Roy B. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3220-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Sp family proteins bind the N9 region and interact with GC motifs in untreated and stress-induced cells (16Abdelrahim M. Liu S. Safe S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16508-16513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Induction of ER stress is accompanied by cleavage of p90 ATF6 to p60 ATF6, a nuclear transcription factor that interacts with NF-Y proteins (4Haze K. Okada T. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 17Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol.

Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). TFII-I is also induced by ER stress and interacts with ATF6 to form a part of the ERSE-protein complex (19Hong M. Lin M.Y. Huang J.M. Baumeister P. Hakre S. Roy A.L. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16821-16828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that maximal stimulation of ERSE by ATF6 requires its interaction with TFII-I and binding to the conserved GGC sequence motif within the 9-bp region (15Parker R. Phan T. Baumeister P. Roy B. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3220-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Based on the data by Abdelrahim et al. (16Abdelrahim M. Liu S. Safe S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16508-16513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), it is possible that Sp proteins may function to enhance the interaction of the ATF6 and TFII-I complex with basal transcription factors or other nuclear factors under ER stress conditions. The cellular transcription factor E2F1 plays a critical role in the control of cell cycle progression by regulating the timely expression of many genes required for the transition from G1 to S phase. A key component that controls cell cycle transition through the restriction point is the retinoblastoma protein (Rb), which, when hypophosphorylated, binds to E2F1 and thereby prevents its normal function. Deregulated E2F1 activity leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation, which is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Interestingly, E2F1 can also efficiently induce apoptosis via p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways, and this is an effective mechanism for suppressing tumorigenesis. Moreover, DNA damage leads to up-regulation of E2F1 and its stabilization via direct phosphorylation by ATM, ATR, and CHK2 (checkpoint 2) kinases and by p300-mediated acetylation (20Dornan D. Shimizu H. Perkins N.D. Hupp T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13431-13441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 21Ianari A. Gallo R. Palma M. Alesse E. Gulino A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30830-30835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Besides direct activation of various apoptosis related genes, E2F1 sensitizes cells to apoptosis via inhibition of antiapoptotic survival signals mediated by NF-;B or Bcl-2 and its family member Mcl-1 (22Croxton R. Ma Y. Song L. Haura E.B. Cress W.D. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1359-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 23Eischen C.M. Packham G. Nip J. Fee B.E. Hiebert S.W. Zambetti G.P. Cleveland J.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6983-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 24Chen M. Capps C. Willerson J.T. Zoldhelyi P. Circulation. 2002; 106: 2707-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The E2F1-induced decrease in Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 levels occurs independently of the ARF/p53 pathway. Taken together, the frequent deregulation of E2F1 in human tumors, its apoptotic potential, and stabilization after damage suggest that E2F1 may play an important role in enhanced sensitivity of malignant cells to chemotherapy-induced cell death. Previously, we performed a differential proteomic analysis to identify proteins associated with E2F1 activity in inducible p53-deficient cells (25Li Z. Kreutzer M. Mikkat S. Mise N. Glocker M.O. Putzer B.M. Proteomics. 2006; 6: 5735-5745Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This approach revealed that E2F1 decreases the protein level of GRP78/BIP. To understand the molecular mechanism underlying the selective suppression of GRP78/BIP by E2F1 in malignant cells lacking functional p53, we investigated the core promoter region for putative transcription factor binding sites and found that repression of GRP78/BIP by E2F1 occurs at the transcriptional level via direct binding to noncanonical E2F1-like (GC-rich) sites between -324 and -311 and between -126 and -108 of the distal ERSE element, thereby interfering with DNA binding of Sp1 and TFII-I. We also demonstrate that protein expression of the nuclear transcription factor TFII-I, which is required for stress-induced transactivation of the GRP78/BIP promoter, is significantly reduced in response to E2F1 activation. Last, our data provide evidence that repression of GRP78/BIP by E2F1 is one of the underlying mechanisms of E2F1-mediated sensitization of cancer cells to chemotherapy. Cell Lines, Genotoxic Treatment, and Transfections—H1299, Hep3B, and Saos-2ERE2F1 cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin G/streptomycin sulfate (Invitrogen). 4-Hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT; Sigma) was used at a final concentration of 1 ;m. For genotoxic treatment, cells were exposed to 30 ;m cisplatin (Sigma). Transfections were performed with Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Adenoviral Infection—Replication-deficient recombinant adenoviral vectors AdGFP and AdERE2F have been described previously (26Stiewe T. Putzer B.M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 464-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Ad-vectors were propagated in 293 cells, purified by CsCl buoyant density centrifugation, and titrated by standard plaque assay. Adenoviral infections were carried out at multiplicities of infection that allow 100% transduction of each cell line (multiplicity of infection = 10 for H1299, 20 for Hep3B). Plasmid Construction—Expression plasmids for wild-type E2F1, the DNA binding-defective E2F1 mutant E132, and the E(-TA) mutant lacking the transactivation domain have been described previously (26Stiewe T. Putzer B.M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 464-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). GRP78/BIP promoter fragments were amplified from chromosomal DNA isolated from HeLa cells and cloned into the TA-cloning vector (Invitrogen). Promoter fragments were subcloned into pGL3-Basic (Promega) to allow transcription of the firefly luciferase gene under their control. Primers used for amplification of the promoter fragments are shown in supplemental Table 1. Luciferase Assay—Luciferase activity was measured 24 or 36 h post-transfection using a commercially available luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) and normalized to total protein concentration in cell extracts. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR was performed on total RNA prepared by an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen). Following DNase I treatment, 1 ;g of RNA was reverse transcribed using Omniscript RT (Qiagen) and oligo(dT). PCR amplification was performed as described (11Sugawara S. Takeda K. Lee A. Dennert G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 6001-6005PubMed Google Scholar). A minimum number of cycles was performed to obtain a clear signal within the linear amplification phase. Primer sequences are shown in supplemental Table 1. Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), and whole cell extracts were separated on 8-12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were incubated with the following primary antibodies: anti-GRP78 (sc-13968; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-E2F1 (catalog number 554213; BD Pharmingen), anti-Sp1 (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-TFII-I (sc-9943; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-ATF6 (sc-14253; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-YY1 (sc-7341; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-NF-YA (Upstate Biotechnology), and anti-actin (sc-1615; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The corresponding peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody was detected using ECL Western blotting reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—The chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed on Saos-2ERE2F1 cells grown in the presence or absence of 4-OHT. Proteins bound to DNA were cross-linked using formaldehyde at a final concentration of 1.42% for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 125 ;m. Following sonication protein-DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated using primary antibody for E2F1 (sc-193; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Sp1 (Upstate Biotechnology), TFII-I (sc-9943; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or appropriate control IgG antibodies overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Immunoprecipitated chromatin was eluted from the beads in 10% Chelex100 and boiled for 10 min. The precipitated DNA was analyzed by PCR. Primers utilized are shown in supplemental Table 1. The PCR products were run on 2% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Expression levels were quantitated in relative software units using a Bio-Imaging Analyzer (Fuji, Dússeldorf, Germany) with the TINA program. Data were normalized to the input after subtraction of background signals. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out with nuclear extracts from Saos-2ERE2F cells using biotin end-labeled (BrightStar BioDetect kit; Ambion) double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the GC-box containing element (-327 to -304) and ERSE 1 element (-126 to -108) in the GRP78/BIP promoter. Binding reactions were performed with 2 ;g of nuclear extracts and labeled probe incubated in appropriate buffer for 30 min at room temperature. For competition assays, the competitor DNA was added 10 min prior to the addition of the labeled probe. The specific E2F1 binding site of the Apaf-1 promoter (-532 to -526) (27Furukawa Y. Nishimura N. Satoh M. Endo H. Iwase S. Yamada H. Matsuda M. Kano Y. Nakamura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39760-39768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) was used as a positive control. Samples were evaluated by electrophoresis on an 8% nondenaturing acrylamide gel. The gels were blotted on nylon transfer membrane and exposed to x-ray film. Oligonucleotide sequences are shown in supplemental Table 1. Determination of Cell Death—Treated cells were harvested with trypsin-EDTA, washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated overnight at -20 °C with 1 ml of 70% ice-cold ethanol. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 400 ml of propidium iodide/RNase A solution (phosphate-buffered saline, 100 mg/ml RNase A, and 100 mg/ml propidium iodide) for 30 min, and subjected to flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed by CellQuest software. The subdiploid population was calculated as an estimate of the apoptotic cell population. Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was calculated by Student's t test. E2F1 Expression Leads to Repression of GRP78/BIP Promoter Activity—Human cancer cells often acquire mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene or defects in p53 apoptosis pathways. The effect of E2F1 on tumor growth, which compensates or bypasses cell death defects regardless of the p53 status, has been evaluated in several types of human cancer. To investigate the impact of E2F1 on GRP78/BIP expression in p53-defective cancer cells, H1299 and Hep3B cells were infected with AdERE2F1 at a multiplicity of infection, which allows 100% transduction. The AdERE2F1 vector, in which transgene-mediated toxicity is regulated by fusion to the tamoxifen-inducible estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain, has been shown to efficiently induce cell death of human tumor cells with defects in apoptotic pathways. Ad-vector expressing GFP was used as negative control. In both cell lines, decreased transcript levels of GRP78/BIP were observed at 4 h after E2F1 induction (Fig. 1A), compared with unchanged mRNA levels in cells lacking activated E2F1, suggesting that E2F1-mediated reduction of GRP78/BIP occurs independently of the p53 and Rb status. Repression of GRP78/BIP expression correlated with the ability of E2F1 to transactivate proapoptotic genes, such as TP73. During this early time period, we did not observe E2F1-mediated growth arrest or apoptosis (data not shown). The direct effect of E2F1 on GRP78/BIP was further investigated in Hep3B cells transfected with the plasmid hBIP-luc, which contains the proximal fragment (-371 to +2) of the human GRP78/BIP promoter. Overexpression of E2F1 resulted in a substantial inhibition of the basal promoter activity, indicating that regulation of GRP78/BIP expression by E2F1 occurs at the transcriptional level. A strong E2F1-mediated promoter repression was also detected under ER stress conditions following tunicamycin treatment. In contrast, the p73 promoter (p73P-luc (26Stiewe T. Putzer B.M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 464-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar)) was significantly activated in response to enhanced E2F1 expression (Fig. 1B). The DNA Binding Domain of E2F1 Is Involved in Full Repression of the GRP78/BIP Promoter—Previous studies using various E2F1 mutants have demonstrated that suppression of antiapoptotic mediators, such as Bcl-2 and its family member Mcl-1, by E2F1 is dependent on its DNA binding activity (22Croxton R. Ma Y. Song L. Haura E.B. Cress W.D. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1359-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 28Stanelle J. Stiewe T. Rodicker F. Kohler K. Theseling C. Putzer B.M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 59: 512-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 29Hsieh J.K. Fredersdorf S. Kouzarides T. Martin K. Lu X. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1840-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). To determine whether the previously mapped transactivation (TA)/Rb binding domain or the DNA binding domain of E2F1 is required for the suppressive activity on GRP78/BIP expression, the E2F1 transactivation defective mutant E(-TA) and E132 with a mutation in the DNA binding domain were tested for their ability to mediate GRP78/BIP repression (Fig. 2). Compared with the wild-type E2F1 expression plasmid, E2F1-induced repression of GRP78/BIP-luciferase activity was completely abolished by cotransfection of the plasmid encoding E2F1 without the DNA binding domain. Instead, deletion of the TA domain (residues 1-374) maintained at least 50% repression of the promoter. Western blot analysis of cell extracts confirmed that Hep3B cells overexpressing the E132 mutant showed no reduction of the GRP78/BIP protein level compared with mock-transfected cells, whereas ectopic expression of E2F1 and E(-TA) was associated with decreased expression of GRP78/BIP. These data indicate that the DNA binding domain of E2F1 is required for the full repressive effect on the GRP78/BIP promoter. Identification of GRP78/BIP Promoter Elements Responsible for E2F1-mediated Transcriptional Repression—A unique feature shared among GRP promoters is the presence of a large number of CCAAT elements flanked by GC-rich motifs (12Roy B. Lee A.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1437-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The human GRP78/BIP promoter contains three ER stress response elements. However, previous studies analyzing the promoter for its response to ER stress inducers revealed that part of its activity is induced by ERSE-independent pathways. To identify the promoter region mediating responsiveness to E2F1, a panel of luciferase reporter plasmids containing the proximal -371 to +2 promoter fragment with increasing 5′-deletions was constructed by removing GC-rich and ERSE elements and tested after transient cotransfection of E2F1 in H1299 cells. As shown in Fig. 3, the main (∼2-fold) loss of basal promoter activity was observed with the constructs D1 (-371 to -304) and D4 (-159 to -109). Further deletions of the 5′-end (D1-D3) gradually affected the responsiveness to E2F1, which was nearly abrogated in the D4/D5 constructs. These findings suggest that the 296-bp region between -371 and -109 of the proximal GRP78/BIP promoter contains the major E2F1-responsive elements. Similar protein expression levels of E2F1 were confirmed by Western blotting. E2F1 Binds the GRP78/BIP Promoter in Vivo and Abolishes Interaction with Sp1 and TFII-I Proteins—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed to determine the in vivo binding of E2F1 to the GRP78/BIP promoter. Analysis of the entire 371-bp promoter region responsive to E2F1 revealed three GC-boxes in the -371 to -159 bp region and a GC-rich element within the three ERSE elements, which represent putative Sp1 binding sites. In addition, we have identified two DNA sequences resembling E2F binding sites, one located in close proximity (partially overlapping) to the distal GC-box (-324 to -311) and a second in the ERSE 1 element (-126 to -108) as part of the GC-rich motif. Saos-2 cells that stably express the ER-E2F1 fusion protein were used to conditionally regulate E2F1 activation through 4-OHT administration (25Li Z. Kreutzer M. Mikkat S. Mise N. Glocker M.O. Putzer B.M. Proteomics. 2006; 6: 5735-5745Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 30Stanelle J. Stiewe T. Theseling C.C. Peter M. Putzer B.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1859-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). After synchronization of cells by serum starvation, nuclear translocation of E2F1 was induced by the addition of 1 ;m 4-OHT for 24 h. DNA-protein complexes were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against E2F1 and IgG. Purified DNA was analyzed by PCR using primer pairs that amplified a 371-bp region of the GRP78/BIP promoter (full) containing the three GC-boxes and ERSEs, regions D1-D3, which revealed constitutive Luc repression in response to E2F1, D4 (-109 to +2) lacking the distal consensus ERSE sequence, or, as a positive control, the E2F1 binding region of the Apaf-1 promoter (27Furukawa Y. Nishimura N. Satoh M. Endo H. Iwase S. Yamada H. Matsuda M. Kano Y. Nakamura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39760-39768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). The chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed a strong increase in E2F1 binding to full GRP78/BIP comparable with its binding to the Apaf-1 consensus sequence. Consistent with the luciferase reporter data, the presence of E2F1 on the promoter persisted through regions spanning D1-D3. Although the strongest binding of E2F1 was detectable to the 159-bp region with the ERSE elements, it was barely detectable on the D4 promoter. In contrast, there was no binding of E2F1 in untreated cells. ERSEs from various ER stress-responsive genes exhibit a tripartite structure, which includes two motifs that bind NF-Y/CBF and YY1 and flank a central nonanucleotide (N9) sequence that shows some variability in different ERSEs. Previous studies have demonstrated that the GC-rich N9 motif, which binds TFII-I (15Parker R. Phan T. Baumeister P. Roy B. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3220-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) also interacts with Sp proteins both in stressed and unstressed cells, resulting in GRP78/BIP activation (16Abdelrahim M. Liu S. Safe S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16508-16513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). E2F1 is capable of regulating promoter activity through Sp1 binding sites (31Lin S.Y. Black A.R. Kostic D. Pajovic S. Hoover C.N. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 1668-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 32Karlseder J. Rotheneder H. Wintersberger E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 1659-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In order to examine the possible role of the ERSE(N9) sequence in E2F1-mediated repression of the GRP78/BIP promoter, we analyzed whether binding of E2F1 interferes with DNA-protein interaction of the transcriptional activator Sp1 (Fig. 4B). Immunoprecipitation of chromatin-protein complexes with antibody against Sp1 and subsequent PCR amplification of the 159-bp region revealed a pronounced decrease in the intensity of the DNA-Sp1 complex upon activation of endogenous E2F1. We also observed a clearly reduced binding of TFII-I in Saos-2ERE2F1 cells treated with 4-OHT, which binds directly to the conserved GGC motif within the 9-bp region of the ERSE and is required for maximal stimulation of ERSE by ATF6 (15Parker R. Phan T. Baumeister P. Roy B. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 3220-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results suggest that E2F1 exhibits its repressive effect on GRP78/BIP expression by direct interaction with the GC-rich region of the distal ERSE through interfering with the binding of positive regulatory proteins, such as Sp1 and TFII-I. Because the distal GC-box in addition to the Sp1 binding region of the first ERSE element governed a component of E2F1-regulated GRP78/BIP repression, binding of the E2F1 protein to both regions was investigated in gel mobility shift assays using labeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the putative E2F1 sites between -327 and -304 and between -126 and -108. A comparison was made between the E2F1-like sequences from the GRP78/BIP promoter and a wild-type E2F site from the Apaf-1 promoter shown to specifically bind E2F1 (27Furukawa Y. Nishimura N.

Consistent with the Apaf-1 E2F1 probe (Fig. 5, lane 2), both GRP78/BIP oligonucleotides formed one predominant nuclear complex, A′ (lanes 5 and 8). Band A′ of the GRP78/BIP GC-box and ERSE E2F site binding complexes was competed most efficiently by an excess (50-fold) of its cognate E2F1 site from the Apaf-1 oligonucleotide"
https://openalex.org/W2132458297,"BTG2/TIS21/PC3 (B cell translocation gene 2) has been known as a p53 target gene and functions as a tumor suppressor in carcinogenesis of thymus, prostate, kidney, and liver. Although it has been known that the expression of BTG2/TIS21/PC3 is induced during chemotherapy-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells, a role of BTG2/TIS21/PC3 in cell death remains to be elucidated. In this study, the mechanism and role of BTG2 involved in the enhancement of doxorubicin (DOXO)-induced cell death were examined. Treatment of HeLa cells with DOXO revealed apoptotic phenomena, such as chromatin condensation and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and lamin A/C with concomitant increase of BTG2/TIS21/PC3 expression. Employing infections of Ad-TIS21 virus and lentivirus with short hairpin RNA to BTG2, the effect of BTG2/TIS21/PC3 on the DOXO-induced apoptosis of HeLa cells and liver cancer cells was evaluated. Not only short hairpin RNA-BTG2 but also N-acetyl-l-cysteine significantly reduced the DOXO-induced HeLa cell death and generation of H2O2. Moreover, forced expression of BTG2/TIS21/PC3 using adenoviral vector augmented DOXO-induced cancer cell death concomitantly with increase of manganese-superoxide dismutase but not catalase, CuZnSOD, and glutathione peroxidase 1. The increased apoptosis by forced expression of BTG2/TIS21/PC3 could be inhibited by N-acetyl-l-cysteine and polyethylene glycol-catalase. These results therefore suggest that BTG2/TIS21/PC3 works as an enhancer of DOXO-induced cell death via accumulation of H2O2 by up-regulating manganese-superoxide dismutase without any other antioxidant enzymes. In summary, BTG2/TIS21/PC3 enhances cancer cell death by accumulating H2O2 via imbalance of the antioxidant enzymes in response to chemotherapy.

TIS21 (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-inducible sequence 21) was first identified as one of immediate early genes (1Lim R.W. Varnum B.C. Herschman H.R. Oncogene. 1987; 1: 263-270PubMed Google Scholar) in mice 3T3 fibroblasts when treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (2Fletcher B.S. Lim R.W. Varnum B.C. Kujubu D.A. Koski R.A. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14511-14518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since then, PC3 (pheochromocytoma cell 3) was isolated as an immediate early response gene when activated by nerve growth factor at the onset of neuronal differentiation in rat PC12 cells (3Bradbury A. Possenti R. Shooter E.M. Tirone F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3353-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The human homolog of TIS21, named BTG2 (B cell translocation gene 2), was cloned from a cDNA library of human lymphoblastoid cells as a gene associated with DNA damage response and contains p53 response elements in its 5′-flanking (–74 to –112) region (4Rouault J.P. Falette N. Guehenneux F. Guillot C. Rimokh R. Wang Q. Berthet C. Moyret-Lalle C. Savatier P. Pain B. Shaw P. Berger R. Samarut J. Magaud J.P. Ozturk M. Samarut C. Puisieux A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). We previously reported that TIS21 expression was low in thymic carcinoma developed in the SV40 large T antigen transgenic mice but high in normal thymus, suggesting anticarcinogenic activity of TIS21 in thymus (5Lim I.K. Lee M.S. Lee S.H. Kim N.K. Jou I. Seo J.S. Park S.C. J Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1995; 121: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Expressions of TIS21 in renal proximal tubule and prostate acini are lost also in the renal carcinoma and the early stage of carcinogenesis in prostate (6Struckmann K. Schraml P. Simon R. Elmenhorst K. Mirlacher M. Kononen J. Moch H. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1632-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 7Ficazzola M.A. Fraiman M. Gitlin J. Woo K. Melamed J. Rubin M.A. Walden P.D. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 1271-1279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Consistent with these findings, Boiko et al. (8Boiko A.D. Porteous S. Razorenova O.V. Krivokrysenko V.I. Williams B.R. Gudkov A.V. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 236-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) recently ascertained BTG2 as a tumor suppressor by showing that BTG2 is a major downstream effector of p53-dependent proliferation arrest of mouse and human fibroblasts transduced with oncogenic Ras and that repression of BTG2 regulates the activities of cyclin D1 and cyclin E and phosphorylation of pRB, thus inducing neoplastic transformation of primary human fibroblasts. TIS21 has been known to work also independently of pRB and p53 in cancer cells regulating G1/S arrest and G2/M arrest by inhibiting synthesis of cyclin E and cdk4 (9Lim I.K. Lee M.S. Ryu M.S. Park T.J. Fujiki H. Eguchi H. Paik W.K. Mol. Carcinog. 1998; 23: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), as well as interaction with cyclin B1 and the cdk1 complex (10Ryu M.S. Lee M.S. Hong J.W. Hahn T.R. Moon E. Lim I.K. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 299: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), respectively. Moreover, persistent expression of TIS21 induces the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential differences in U937 cells (11Hong J.W. Ryu M.S. Lim I.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21256-21263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and transfection of TIS21 gene to Huh7 hepatoma cells significantly reduces in vivo and in vitro tumorigenesis by inhibiting feedback regulation between cyclin B1 and FoxM1 transcription factor (11Hong J.W. Ryu M.S. Lim I.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21256-21263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and the expression of BTG2 in human liver cancer is much lower than that of the surrounding tissues. Collectively, these findings indicate that TIS21 controls cellular process as an inhibitor of cell division cycle and a tumor suppressor, thus evading cancer development independent of p53. The level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 2The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; DOXO, doxorubicin; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; NAC, N-acetyl-l-cysteine; MnSOD, manganese-superoxide dismutase; GPx, glutathione peroxidase 1; H2-DCFDA, 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate; PYRO, pyrogallol; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide; PEG, polyethylene glycol; RT, reverse transcription; HA, hemagglutinin; NBT, nitro blue tetrazolium salt; Ad-β-Gal, adenovirus with bacterial β-galactosidase; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast(s). is controlled by multiple interacting components. Among them, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx), and catalase are the primary antioxidant enzymes in mammalian tissues (12Fridovich I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 97-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (2771) Google Scholar, 13Zelko I.N. Mariani T.J. Folz R.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1653) Google Scholar). SOD catalyzes dismutation of superoxide anion to hydrogen peroxide, which is further detoxified by catalase and GPx. In mammals, there are at least three forms of SOD: cytosolic CuZnSOD, extracellular ECSOD, and mitochondrial MnSOD. MnSOD knock-out mice die within 18 days after birth, suggesting that MnSOD is an essential enzyme (14Li Y. Huang T.T. Carlson E.J. Melov S. Ursell P.C. Olson J.L. Noble L.J. Yoshimura M.P. Berger C. Chan P.H. Wallace D.C. Epstein C.J. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is reported that MnSOD has the opposite effect, for instance, overexpression of SOD in Escherichia coli results in an increased sensitivity to paraquat and hyperoxia (15Scott M.D. Meshnick S.R. Eaton J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3640-3645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as ionizing radiation caused by apparently increased generation of H2O2 (16Scott M.D. Meshnick S.R. Eaton J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2498-2501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, overexpression of MnSOD revealed higher sensitivity to ROS in human prostate carcinoma cells (17Li N. Oberley T.D. Oberley L.W. Zhong W. Prostate. 1998; 35: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Although it has been known that the expression of BTG2/TIS21/PC3 is induced during chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in various cancer cells (18Chen J.G. Yang C.P. Cammer M. Horwitz S.B. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 7891-7899PubMed Google Scholar, 19Islaih M. Halstead B.W. Kadura I.A. Li B. Reid-Hubbard J.L. Flick L. Altizer J.L. Thom Deahl J. Monteith D.K. Newton R.K. Watson D.E. Mutat.

Cell Physiol. 2001; 187: 155-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), the role of BTG2/TIS21/PC3 in cell death remains to be elucidated. Despite the fact that a large body of studies has consistently suggested that BTG2 functions as a tumor suppressor, BTG2–/– ES cells are more sensitive to DOXO when compared with BTG2+/+ ES cells (4Rouault J.P. Falette N. Guehenneux F. Guillot C. Rimokh R. Wang Q. Berthet C. Moyret-Lalle C. Savatier P. Pain B. Shaw P. Berger R. Samarut J. Magaud J.P. Ozturk M. Samarut C. Puisieux A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). To our best knowledge, there is yet no report regarding how TIS21/BTG2 induces the apoptosis of cancer cells in response to chemotherapy. Therefore, we investigated, in the present study, the role of BTG2 in the process of DOXO-induced apoptosis of cancer cells and found that BTG2 enhanced DOXO-induced oxidative damage via imbalance of antioxidant enzymes and worked as a pro-apoptotic gene in the cell death process. Cell Cultures—HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The medium was changed every other day. All of the doxorubicin treatments were performed in the culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Immediately before treatment, the medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium. Reagents—N-Acetyl-l-cysteine, PEG-catalase, and pyrogallol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Doxorubicin was from Tocris Bioscience. Nuclear Staining with Hoechst Dye—Staining was performed as described (21Lee Y. Shacter E. Blood. 1997; 89: 4480-4492Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, control and treated cells (1 μg/ml doxorubicin for 24 h) were fixed with 3.7% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature and permeated with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were stained with Hoechst 33258 for 5 min, washed, and then examined by fluorescence microscopy (340-nm excitation and 510-nm barrier filter). Apoptotic cells were identified by the presence of highly condensed or fragmented nuclei. Preparation of Cell Lysates and Western Blot Analysis—To prepare a total cell lysate, the cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, and 1% Nonidet P-40. The supernatants were collected after centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. 50-μg aliquots of protein samples were size-fractionated by electrophoresis and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were immunoblotted with primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. The immunoblotted proteins were visualized by a chemiluminescence ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). The primary antibodies were purchased from the following sources: anti-lamin A/C and anti-HA from Cell Signaling; anti-PARP from Zymed Laboratories Inc.; anti-MnSOD, anti-GPx, and anti-catalase from Lab Frontier; anti-α-tubulin from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Lentiviral shRNA Production and in Vitro Transduction—PLKO.1 lentiviral vectors expressing shRNAs against BTG2 were purchased from Open Biosystems. For BTG2, five preformed constructs were obtained and tested to identify the constructs, which were able to achieve efficient knockdown using RT-PCR. Lentiviral vector stock was produced in 293T cells by transient cotransfection of shRNA construct together with pHR8.2R and pCMV-VSV-G helper constructs using Lipofectamine. The supernatants were harvested after 30 h and filtered through a 0.22-micron filter (Millipore) to remove any nonadherent 293T cells. Next, HeLa cells (5 × 104 in 35-mm-diameter culture dishes) were transduced with 1 ml of virus containing supernatant supplemented with 8 μg of Polybrene. The medium was changed 1 day postinfection, and fresh medium was applied for 2 days. RT-PCR—Total cellular RNA was prepared by standard TRIzol-based methods. 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with oligo(dT) using the Superscript II reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. RT product (1/50 volume) was applied to PCR. cDNA fragments of BTG2 (175 bp) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (195 bp) were amplified using the following primers: sense, 5′-CGAGCAGAGGCTTAAGGTCTTC-3′, and antisense, 5′-CTGGCTGAGTCCGATCTGG-3′ for BTG2; and sense, 5′-CCATGGAGAAGGCTGGGG-3′, and antisense, 5′-CAAAGTTGTCATGGATGACC-3′ for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Measurement of Intracellular Hydrogen Peroxide and Superoxide Anion Concentration—The intracellular H2O2 concentration was measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis using 50 μm 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2-DCFDA) (D-399; Molecular Probes) in a cell culture system as described (22Kim H.S. Song M.C. Kwak I.H. Park T.J. Lim I.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37497-37510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were pretreated with H2-DCFDA for 10 min prior to cell harvest. H2O2 generation was determined with FACScan (BD Biosciences) by measuring the fluorescence of dichlorodihydrofluorescein arising from the oxidation of H2-DCFDA. Nitro blue tetrazolium salt (NBT) forms a water-insoluble blue formazan when it reacts with intracellular superoxide, showing the degree of superoxide formation within the cell. Chromogenic detection of superoxide was performed using NBT as described (23Serrander L. Cartier L. Bedard K. Banfi B. Lardy B. Plastre O. Sienkiewicz A. Fórró L. Schlegel W. Krause K. Biochem. J. 2007; 406: 105Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). In brief, control cells and cells treated with 50 μm pyrogallol for 3 h were incubated with NBT (1.6 mg/ml) in Hanks' balanced salt solution. After a wash in methanol, formazan crystals were extracted with 560 μl of 2 m KOH and 480 μl of DMSO. Absorbance was measured at 575 nm. The results were expressed as A575 obtained from 106 cells. Construction and Use of Adenoviral Vectors—Adenoviral vector expressing TIS21 (Ad-TIS21) was prepared as described (24Park T.J. Kim J.Y. Oh S.P. Kang S.Y. Kim B.W. Wang H.J. Song K.Y. Kim H.C. Lim I.K. Hepatology. 2008; 47: 1533-1543Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In brief, cDNA of TIS21 inserted into replication-defective E1- and E3-adenoviral vectors were transfected and then amplified in 293 human kidney epithelial cells. Adenovirus with bacterial β-galactosidase (Ad-β-Gal) was also prepared for control experiment. MnSOD Activity Assay—To measure MnSOD activity, cells were collected with a rubber policeman and sonicated in cold 20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.2 (EGTA 1 mm, 210 mm mannitol, and 70 mm sucrose), followed by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was subsequently centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was homogenized with HEPES buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and subjected to MnSOD activity assay using a superoxide dismutase assay kit (SOD-560; Applied Bioanalytical Labs) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The activity of MnSOD was measured in the presence of 2 mm potassium cyanide, an inhibitor of CuZnSOD. Statistics—The results were expressed as the means ± S.D. from three to four experiments performed independently. Paired Student's t test was performed where indicated, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Doxorubicin-induced Cell Death Accompanied with BTG2/TIS21 Expression—Doxorubicin is one of the well known chemotherapeutic agents and inducers of apoptosis in various tumor cells including HeLa cells (25Zaleskis G. Berleth E. Verstovsek S. Ehrke M.J. Mihich E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 901-908PubMed Google Scholar). As reported, when HeLa cells were treated with DOXO, chromatin condensation, evidenced by Hoechst dye staining (Fig. 1A), and cleavages of PARP (substrate of caspase-3 and -7) and lamin A/C (substrate of caspase 6) were observed in dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). To investigate the possible involvement of BTG2 in DOXO-induced cell death, HeLa cells were exposed to DOXO for 24 h, and the time-dependent cleavage of lamin A/C (Fig. 1D) with a concomitant increase of BTG2 expression were observed in 12 h (Fig. 1C), suggesting that BTG2 may have a role in the process of DOXO-induced cell death. BTG2/TIS21 Enhanced DOXO-induced Cell Death in Human Cancer Cell Lines—To examine the role of BTG2 in DOXO-induced cell death, HeLa cells were infected with HA-tagged Ad-TIS21 virus or Ad-β-Gal as the control. Infection of the cells with Ad-TIS21 virus (10–100 m.o.i.) significantly increased the number of cells with chromatin condensation in response to DOXO treatment, as compared with that of the control (Fig. 2A). Based on the data in Fig. 2A, HeLa cells were infected with viruses (50 m.o.i.) and then treated with DOXO, and the expression of TIS21 was examined by Western blot analysis using anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 2B, Ad-TIS21 enhanced DOXO-induced cleavages of PARP and lamin A/C compared with those of the control. However, TIS21 itself did not induce the cleavages when the cells were treated with DOXO. To confirm the pro-apoptotic activity of TIS21 in DOXO-induced cell death, endogenous BTG2/TIS21 was down-regulated by using sh-BTG2/TIS21 RNA. Thus, HeLa cells were infected with either lentivirus of BTG2 shRNA (H4 or H5) or empty vector as a control, and the efficiency of knockdown was measured by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 2C, RT-PCR revealed down-regulation of BTG2 mRNA in the H4 or H5 infected cells, whereas the expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was unaffected. Infection of the cells with sh-BTG2 or control lentiviral vector did not indicate any signs of cell death; however, infection with H4 or H5 significantly reduced the effect of DOXO on the cleavage of lamin A/C (Fig. 2C, right panel). Fig. 2 (A--C) clearly showed pro-apoptotic activity of BTG2 during DOXO-induced cell death in HeLa cells. The findings were unexpected, because BTG2–/– ES cells exhibited increased sensitivity to DOXO-induced cell death (4Rouault J.P. Falette N. Guehenneux F. Guillot C. Rimokh R. Wang Q. Berthet C. Moyret-Lalle C. Savatier P. Pain B. Shaw P. Berger R. Samarut J. Magaud J.P. Ozturk M. Samarut C. Puisieux A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the effect of BTG2 on DOXO-induced cell death is not a confined phenomenon in HeLa cells, human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines Huh7, HepG2, and Hep3B were infected with Ad-TIS21 virus and then treated with IC50 concentrations of DOXO (26Lee T.K. Lau T.C. Ng I.O. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2002; 49: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) to induce apoptosis. Fig. 2D showed that TIS21 augmented DOXO-induced cleavages of PARP and lamin A/C, compared with those of the Ad-β-Gal. These findings clearly proved the pro-apoptotic role of TIS21 not only in HeLa cells but also in the hepatoma cell lines. BTG2/TIS21 Up-regulated Generation of H2O2 Induced by DOXO—Based on the report that DOXO produces ROS in cells (27Minotti G. Menna P. Salvatorelli E. Cairo G. Gianni L. Pharmacol. Rev. 2004; 56: 185-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (2965) Google Scholar), we first examined whether DOXO was indeed engaged in the apoptotic process of HeLa cells by producing ROS. As expected, ROS in the DOXO-treated HeLa cells was increased as compared with that of the control (Fig. 3A). To further confirm the involvement of ROS in the process, HeLa cells were pretreated with NAC (0–10 mm), a well known H2O2 scavenger, and apoptosis was then induced by DOXO. Fig. 3B shows that pretreatment of the cells with NAC-inhibited DOXO-induced cleavage of lamin A/C dose-dependently, indicating that ROS are indeed involved in cell death. Pretreatment with NAC also led to a dose-dependent decrease in the number of cells with condensed chromatin (data not shown). To investigate the possible involvement of ROS in pro-apoptotic function of BTG2 during DOXO-induced cell death, we first investigated the effect of TIS21/BTG2 overexpression on superoxide anion generator-induced cell death (28Kim S.W. Han Y.W. Lee S.T. Jeong H.J. Kim S.H. Kim I.H. Lee S.O. Kim D.G. Kim S.Z. Park W.H. Mol. Carcinog. 2008; 47: 114-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were incubated with pyrogallol (PYRO; superoxide anion generator), and then NBT reduction by superoxide anion generated was examined. As shown in Fig. 3C, NBT reduction was dependent on the concentration of PYRO (upper panel), and superoxide anion generator-mediated cleavage of PARP was significantly reduced by pretreatment of NAC (lower panel), suggesting in vivo conversion of PYRO-induced superoxide anion to H2O2. When HeLa cells were first infected with 50 m.o.i. of Ad-TIS21 or Ad-β-Gal and then cell death was induced by treatment of the cells with PYRO (50 μm) for 48 h with or without NAC (5 mm) pretreatment, PYRO-induced cell death was enhanced by TIS21, as opposed to inhibition of the enhancement by NAC pretreatment. The finding strongly supports that TIS21 used H2O2 to regulate PYRO-induced cell death (Fig. 3D). Thus, employing BTG2 shRNA (H4 and H5) and empty vector as a control (Con) we then examined whether the pro-apoptotic effect of BTG2 on DOXO-induced cell death was associated with H2O2 generation. As shown in Fig. 3E, DOXO-induced H2O2 production was reduced by H4 and H5 infection, as compared with that of the control, indicating up-regulation of H2O2 generation by BTG2. To confirm the effect of BTG2/TIS21 on the generation of intracellular H2O2, the cells were infected Ad-TIS21 or Ad-β-Gal viruses, and apoptosis was then induced with DOXO treatment. Treatment of the cells with DOXO significantly increased the level of H2O2, and the overexpression of TIS21 further enhanced the H2O2 level compared with that of the Ad-β-Gal expression (Fig. 3F). TIS21 itself did not affect the generation of H2O2 but significantly enhanced DOXO-induced H2O2 generation. Pretreatment of the Ad-TIS21 or Ad-β-Gal-infected cells with NAC inhibited DOXO-induced H2O2 generation, indicating that TIS21 up-regulated DOXO-induced H2O2 production. NAC Abolished Effect of BTG2/TIS21 on DOXO-induced Cell Death—Next, we examined whether the enhanced cell death by BTG2 was regulated by intracellular H2O2. Thus, HeLa cells infected with Ad-β-Gal or Ad-TIS21 were exposed to DOXO in the presence of NAC, and cell death was monitored by chromatin condensation. NAC pretreatment abolished the increase of chromatin condensation both in the cells infected with Ad-β-Gal or Ad-TIS21, although Ad-TIS21 infection increased the chromatin condensation more than that of Ad-β-Gal infection (Fig. 4A). Concomitantly, the cleavage of lamin A/C was enhanced after Ad-TIS21 infection, as compared with that of Ad-β-Gal, and NAC pretreatment significantly abolished the effect of Ad-TIS21 (Fig. 4B). The data strongly suggest that H2O2 generation may be the major downstream mediator of BTG2/TIS21 when it works as a pro-apoptotic molecule in DOXO-induced cell death. BTG2/TIS21 Up-regulated Expression of MnSOD, but Not Other Antioxidant Enzymes—To investigate a mechanism involved in the significant increase of H2O2 in the DOXO-treated HeLa cells, we first examined the effects of DOXO on the expression of antioxidant enzymes. Treatment of HeLa cells with DOXO (0–1.0 μg/ml) for 12 h up-regulated the expression of MnSOD and CuZnSOD in dose-dependent manner, whereas the levels of GPx, catalase, and α-tubulin protein were not changed at all (Fig. 5A), strongly suggesting that the increase of H2O2 by DOXO treatment might be due to an imbalance of the coordinated expression of antioxidant enzymes. To investigate whether the up-regulation of MnSOD and CuZnSOD after DOXO treatment was due to the increase of BTG2/TIS21 in the cells, HeLa cells were infected with Ad-TIS21, and the expression of antioxidant enzymes was measured by Western blot analyses. As shown in Fig. 5B, infection of Ad-TIS21 itself increased MnSOD expression, and TIS21 enhanced the effect of DOXO on the increased expression of MnSOD without any changes of the other enzymes. Although expression of CuZnSOD was also up-regulated by DOXO treatment, the expression was not regulated by TIS21. At the same time, the activity of MnSOD was correlated with its protein level (Fig. 5C). All of the data strongly suggested that the up-regulation of H2O2 in the DOXO-treated HeLa cells might result from BTG2/TIS21-mediated imbalance of antioxidant enzyme expression. In addition, H4 and H5 sh-BTG2 prevented the effect of TIS21 on the DOXO-induced MnSOD expression (Fig. 5D), indicating that DOXO-induced MnSOD expression might be up-regulated by BTG2/TIS21. To verify the hypothesis that the increase of H2O2 in the DOXO-treated cells might have been due to an imbalance of the coordinated expressions of antioxidant enzymes, we investigated whether PEG-catalase, the membrane-permeable form (29Beckman J.S. Minor Jr., R.L. White C.W. Repine J.E. Rosen G.M. Freeman B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6884-6892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), could protect cells from DOXO-induced apoptosis. Thus, HeLa cells were pretreated with PEG-catalase (0–1000 units/ml) for 12 h before DOXO treatment to balance the expression of MnSOD, and DOXO-induced cell death was then examined by immunoblot analysis. PEG-catalase inhibited the cleavage of lamin A/C induced by DOXO treatment (Fig. 5E). These data indicate that BTG2/TIS21 can augment DOXO-induced cell death via up-regulation of MnSOD, thereby resulting in an imbalance of the coordinated expression of antioxidant enzymes with an increase of H2O2. Therefore, an increased ratio of MnSOD/catalase appears to enhance DOXO-induced cell death. No Protective Effect of NAC on DOXO-induced MEF Cell Death—Although the present findings indicate that BTG2 augments DOXO-induced cell death in HeLa cells, BTG2/PC3/TIS21 knock-out ES cells were known to be more sensitive to DOXO-induced cell death compared with wild type (4Rouault J.P. Falette N. Guehenneux F. Guillot C. Rimokh R. Wang Q. Berthet C. Moyret-Lalle C. Savatier P. Pain B. Shaw P. Berger R. Samarut J. Magaud J.P. Ozturk M. Samarut C. Puisieux A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). To confirm the role of BTG2 in DOXO-induced cell death in ES cells, we employed our TIS21–/– MEF (24Park T.J. Kim J.Y. Oh S.P.

Stem Cells. 2008; 26: 2339-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As opposed to TIS21+/+ MEF, exposure of TIS21–/– MEF to DOXO demonstrated a lower number of viable cells, suggesting the anti-apoptotic role of TIS21 gene in MEF (Fig. 6A). To investigate whether the anti-apoptotic effect of BTG2 was related to antioxidant enzymes, expressions of MnSOD and catalase were examined in the TIS21–/– MEF (Fig. 6B). MnSOD, but not catalase, expression was lower in the TIS21–/– MEF than that of wild type MEF. Moreover, reconstitution of TIS21 gene by infection of TIS21–/– MEF with Ad-TIS21 virus, MnSOD, but not catalase, expression was regulated according to the level of Ad-TIS21 (0–10 m.o.i.). The phenomenon was in close accordance with our previous data (Fig. 5, B–D) that TIS21 itself up-regulated MnSOD expression and its activity. When the effect of TIS21 on ROS was evaluated, treatment of wild type MEF with DOXO generated more H2O2 than that of TIS21–/– MEF (Fig. 6C). However, it was significantly reduced by NAC pretreatment. When we compared the generation of H2O2 after DOXO treatment, the amount of H2O2 generated in wild type MEF was not lower than that of HeLa cells (Fig. 6D). These findings indicate that although TIS21 exhibited pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic activities in HeLa and MEF, respectively, TIS21 enhanced H2O2 generation in response to DOXO treatment both in HeLa and MEF cells via regulation of MnSOD. To further characterize role of H2O2 in normal cells, we next examined the effect of oxidative stress in the DOXO-induced MEF cell death. In contrast to the protective role of NAC in DOXO-induced HeLa cell death (Fig. 3B), pretreatment of MEF with NAC failed to block DOXO-induced MEF cell death (Fig. 6E). Moreover, treatment of MEF with either NAC, H2O2 scavenger, or 100 μm pyrogallol (PYRO), a specific generator of superoxide anion and H2O2, revealed no phenotypical differences, particularly in cell death, as compared with DMSO treatment. These findings strongly suggest that ROS may not play a pro-apoptotic role in MEF, although TIS21/BTG2 enhanced DOXO-induced H2O2 generation both in HeLa and MEF cells. In summary, BTG2/TIS21 worked as an enhancer of DOXO-induced cell death in HeLa, but anti-apoptotic in MEF. We demonstrated here that induction of BTG2/TIS21/PC3 expression sensitized HeLa cells to DOXO-mediated cell death via imbalance of antioxidant enzyme, e.g. induction of MnSOD, but not catalase and GPx, thereby resulting in H2O2 generation (Fig. 7). The phenomenon was confirmed by infections of Ad-TIS21 virus and lentivirus carrying sh-BTG2 RNA, in addition to treatments of NAC and membrane-permeable catalase. The mechanism of significant induction of BTG2/TIS21/PC3 expression after DOXO treatment (Fig. 1C) could be well supported by the presence of four tandem PuPuPuC(A/T) pentamer, a potential p53 recognition element (32el-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar), on the 5′-untranslated region of BTG2 gene (4Rouault J.P. Falette N. Guehenneux F. Guillot C. Rimokh R. Wang Q. Berthet C. Moyret-Lalle C. Savatier P. Pain B. Shaw P. Berger R. Samarut J. Magaud J.P. Ozturk M. Samarut C. Puisieux A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). DOXO-induced BTG2 expression has been known to be p53-dependent in MCF-7 cells (33Cortes U. Moyret-Lalle C. Falette N. Duriez C. Ghissassi F.E. Barnas C. Morel A.P. Hainaut P. Magaud J.P. Puisieux A. Mol. Carcinog. 2000; 27: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), whereas 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate induces BTG2 expression in U937 cells p53-independently (10Ryu M.S. Lee M.S. Hong J.W. Hahn T.R. Moon E. Lim I.K. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 299: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, infection of HeLa cells with Ad-TIS21 virus significantly enhanced DOXO-induced HeLa cell death (Fig. 2, A and B), whereas sh-BTG2 RNA in lentivirus reduced apoptosis (Fig. 2C), strongly supporting a pro-apoptotic role for BTG2/TIS21/PC3 in cancer cells, not only HeLa cells but also Huh7, HepG2, and Hep3B cells (Fig. 2D). It has been known that DOXO induces ROS generation by utilizing cellular oxidoreductases (34Vasquez-Vivar J. Martasek P. Hogg N. Masters B.S. Pritchard Jr., K.A. Kalyanaraman B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11293-11297Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 35Minotti G. Cairo G. Monti E. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 199-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), such as NADH dehydrogenase complex, NADPH cytochrome p450 reductase (36Bachur N.R. Gordon S.L. Gee M.V. Kon H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 954-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), and xanthine oxidase, as well as by nonenzymatic pathways via complex formation between DOXO-ferric iron (37Eliot H. Gianni L. Myers C. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 928-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar); electron donor activates benzanthraquinones of DOXO to semiquinones, and a single electron is transferred to molecular oxygen, thereby generating free radicals, such as superoxide anion, H2O2, hydroxyl radical, and other reactive nitrogen-species (38Tokarska-Schlattner M. Zaugg M. Zuppinger C. Wallimann T. Schlattner U. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2006; 41: 389-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Indeed, treatment of HeLa cells with DOXO generated ROS (Fig. 3A), and DOXO-induced H2O2 generation was significantly regulated by TIS21 expression, e.g. increased by Ad-TIS21 infection (Fig. 3E) but decreased by sh-BTG2/TIS21 RNA and NAC treatment (Fig. 3F). Oxidative damage, therefore, has long been considered to be an important mechanism of anthracycline activity in tumor cells (27Minotti G. Menna P. Salvatorelli E. Cairo G. Gianni L. Pharmacol. Rev. 2004; 56: 185-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (2965) Google Scholar). In the present study, DOXO-induced chromatin condensation and cleavage of lamin A/C were aggravated by introduction of TIS21 to HeLa cells, however, pretreatment of the cells with NAC significantly reduced the damage by DOXO (Fig. 4), supporting the idea that TIS21 works as a pro-apoptotic molecule by enhancing ROS generation upon the treatment of cancer cells with DOXO. When we employed PYRO, TIS21 also enhanced PYRO-induced HeLa cell death; however, it was completely blocked by NAC pretreatment (Fig. 3D). The data strongly suggest that TIS21 enhanced PYRO-induced superoxide and its conversion to H2O2. In addition to ROS generation, MnSOD has recently been identified as a potential target of p53, and ROS have been identified as downstream mediators of tumor suppressor p53 (39Pani G. Bedogni B. Anzevino R. Colavitti R. Palazzotti B. Borrello S. Galeotti T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4654-4660PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is rather tempting to postulate that DOXO induces p53 activation and BTG2/TIS21/PC3 expression, which in turn up-regulates ROS generation and enhances cell death. Indeed, infection of HeLa cells with Ad-TIS21 itself up-regulated MnSOD expression before DOXO treatment, and the expression of MnSOD, but not catalase, GPx, and CuZnSOD, was additively increased after DOXO treatment caused by endogenous BTG2 and exogenous TIS21 activities (Fig. 5, B and C). Thus, a question arises of why high induction of MnSOD enhanced DOXO-induced cell death. Even though the role of SOD as an antioxidant defense has been extensively documented, high activities of SOD have sometimes been reported to be toxic in vivo (40Gardner R. Salvador A. Moradas-Ferreira P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1351-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); therefore the higher the level of SOD, the greater the rate of accumulation of H2O2 (41Buettner G.R. Ng C.F. Wang M. Rodgers V.G. Schafer F.Q. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 41: 1338-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Furthermore, up-regulation of MnSOD has been shown to induce and inhibit apoptotic effects of c-Rel in the same cells (42Bernard D. Quatannens B. Begue A. Vandenbunder B. Abbadie C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2656-2664PubMed Google Scholar, 43Bernard D. Monte D. Vandenbunder B. Abbadie C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4392-4402Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this study, we presented pro-apoptotic role of BTG2 in the DOXO-induced cancer cell death. However, that is in conflict with a previous report regarding the anti-apoptotic effect of BTG2/PC3/TIS21 in ES cells (4Rouault J.P. Falette N. Guehenneux F. Guillot C. Rimokh R. Wang Q. Berthet C. Moyret-Lalle C. Savatier P. Pain B. Shaw P. Berger R. Samarut J. Magaud J.P. Ozturk M. Samarut C. Puisieux A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). We therefore employed TIS21–/– MEF and confirmed that TIS21 enhanced DOXO-induced H2O2 generation not only in cancer cells but also in MEF; however, the cellular response to H2O2 was quite different between cancer and normal cells (Fig. 6). This conflict can be well supported by the report that the effect of ROS in cells is quite different based on the cellular context; mitogenic response, growth arrest, senescence, and cell death (44Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. J. Cell Physiol. 2002; 192: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1955) Google Scholar). We cannot presently explain why H2O2 produced by TIS21 shows such a different effect on cell death between cancer cells and embryonic cells. However, as far as we know, this is the first report to show that BTG2 enhances DOXO-induced cancer cell death via up-regulation of MnSOD. Therefore, we suggest that BTG2TIS21/PC3 augments DOXO-induced cancer cell death via deregulation of antioxidant enzymes, resulting in increased susceptibility to DOXO-induced oxidative damage."

The mini-globin from Cerebratulus lacteus (CerHb) appears to have an alternative pathway between the E and H helices that is made accessible by loss of the N-terminal A helix. To test this pathway, we examined the effects of changing the size of the E7 gate and closing the end of the apolar channel in CerHb by site-directed mutagenesis. Increasing the size of Gln-44(E7) from Ala to Trp causes variation of association (k′O2) and dissociation (kO2) rate coefficients, but the changes are not systematic. More significantly, the fractions (Fgem ≈ 0.05–0.19) and rates (kgem ≈ 50–100 μs-1) of geminate CO recombination in the Gln-44(E7) mutants are all similar. In contrast, blocking the entrance to the apolar channel by increasing the size of Ala-55(E18) to Phe and Trp causes the following: 1) both k′O2 and kO2 to decrease roughly 4-fold; 2) Fgem for CO to increase from ∼0.05 to 0.45; and 3) kgem to decrease from ∼80 to ∼9 μs-1, as ligands become trapped in the channel. Crystal structures and low temperature Fourier-transform infrared spectra of Phe-55 and Trp-55 CerHb confirm that the aromatic side chains block the channel entrance, with little effect on the distal pocket. These results provide unambiguous experimental proof that diatomic ligands can enter and exit a globin through an interior channel in preference to the more direct E7 pathway.

Weakly bound water is displaced to create a vacant distal pocket above the heme iron atom. Ligands migrate into the protein through a short channel that is created when the distal histidine (His-64 at the E7 helical position) 4Amino acids have been identified with their topological site numbers as defined in the conventional globin fold. transiently rotates upward and then are captured in the interior of the distal pocket. This noncovalent intermediate is often called the B state because it can also be generated by photolysis of the equilibrium bound or A state. Covalent bond formation between the internal ligand and the iron atom of the heme group then competes with ligand escape back out through the His(E7) gate. The bound ligand can be further stabilized by electrostatic interactions with surrounding polar amino acid side chains. This E7 gate pathway appears to occur in most if not all animal hemoglobins, with the classic 3-on-3 α-helical globin fold and a distal histidine, although experimental verification has only been done rigorously for vertebrate Mbs using time-resolved crystallography (4Srajer V.

The crystal structures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis trHb (trHbN) and other trHbs display the presence of a channel through the protein matrix between the E and H helices, which is large enough for ligand diffusion to the heme distal pocket from external regions near the EF corner and N terminus of the protein (20Milani M.

Like many microbial and invertebrate globins, CerHb has a ligand-binding site containing Tyr(B10) and Gln(E7), which typically evokes an extremely high oxygen affinity because of formation of multiple hydrogen bonds with the bound ligand (28Pesce A. Nardini M. Dewilde S. Ascenzi P. Riggs A.F. Yamauchi K. Geuens E. Moens L. Bolognesi M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

However, CerHb contains a Thr at the E11 position, and the Thr-48(E11) β-hydroxyl O-γ1 atom pulls the Tyr-11(B10) phenol hydrogen atom away from the bound ligand. As a result, the nonbonding electrons on the Tyr(B10) O-ζ atom are pointing toward the bound ligand, and this negative partial charge causes the oxygen affinity of WT CerHb to be similar to that of vertebrate Mbs (KO2 ≈ 1 μm-1) (31Draghi F.

CerHb also displays very rapid rates of O2 association (k′O2 = 240 μm-1 s-1) and dissociation (kO2 = 180 s-1), which appear to be necessary for rapid gas uptake from oxygenated seawater during surface activity and release to neuronal tissue during periods of hypoxia. These large rate coefficients seem surprising considering the crowded distal pocket and multiple hydrogen bonding interactions that appear to “tie” down the amide side chain of Gln-44, which forms the E7 gate in CerHb. Bolognesi and co-workers (29Pesce A. Nardini M. Dewilde S. Geuens E. Yamauchi K. Ascenzi P. Riggs A.F. Moens L. Bolognesi M.

Thus, the loss of the A helix, which blocks access to the channel, may have been an adaptive strategy to allow for rapid rates of O2 exchange while retaining the Tyr(B10)/Gln(E7) motif. To test this idea, we have adopted the general mapping strategy described by Scott et al. (3Scott E.E. Gibson Q.H. Olson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5177-5188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) for Mb to examine the extent of ligand movement through the apolar channel in CerHb. The two alternative pathways for ligand movement into and out of CerHbO2 are shown in Fig. 1. The shortest route to solvent would be through an E7 gate, which in this case would involve outward and upward movement of the Gln-44 side chain. The alternative pathway involves movement in the opposite direction through an apolar channel bounded by Val-7(B6), Ala-55(E18), Ala-82(G8), Leu-86(G12), and Leu-98(H9). We have begun this mapping study by systematically changing the sizes of the amino acids at the entry point of the E7 gate and at the entrance to the apolar channel. Gln-44(E7) has been mutated to Ala, Val, Leu, His, Phe, and Trp, and Ala-55(E18) has been mutated to Val, Leu, Phe, and Trp. The effects of these mutations on overall and geminate rates of O2 and CO binding have been measured and used to determine the route of ligand entry into CerHb. Low temperature FTIR spectra of the Phe-55 and Trp-55 Cer-HbCO complexes were measured to determine whether these exterior mutations significantly alter internal rebinding within the distal pocket. Finally, structures of the Phe-55 and Trp-55 CerHbO2 mutants were determined by x-ray crystallography to ensure that these replacements caused physical blockage of the apolar channel. Sample Preparation—Wild-type (wt) and mutant recombinant CerHbs were expressed and purified as described previously using a synthetic gene with codon usage optimized for expression in Escherichia coli (29Pesce A.

Most recombinant CerHb samples were isolated in the reduced state and used directly. All experiments to determine rate coefficients were carried out in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 1.0 mm EDTA, 20 °C. CerHbCO and CerHbO2 protein samples were prepared by equilibration with 1 atm CO and 1 atm O2, respectively. When necessary, the unstable Gln-44(E7) mutants were pre-reduced with dithionite, quickly passed through a G-25 column, and eluted with buffer equilibrated with 1 atm of CO. As noted below, O2 binding kinetics were often measured in samples containing mixtures of CO and O2. For those experiments, the starting CerHb sample was in the reduced CO form, which is extremely stable. Measurement of Overall Rates of Ligand Association and Dissociation—CO association time courses were measured after complete laser photolysis of 50 μm CerHbCO samples containing various [CO] under pseudo first-order conditions. An ∼500-ns excitation pulse from a Phase-R model 2100B dye laser was used for photoexcitation (33Rohlfs R.J. Mathews A.J. Carver T.E. Olson J.S. Springer B.A. Egeberg K.D. Sligar S.G. J. Biol.

The time courses were fitted to a simple exponential expression, and k′CO was calculated from the slope of plots of kobs versus [CO]. The association rate coefficient for NO binding to deoxy-CerHb was measured using a flow-flash apparatus and the 500-ns dye laser. The flow part of the instrument is composed of a BioLogic SFM400 Multi-Mixer controlled by the MPS-60 Microprocessor. The Multi-Mixer output is connected to the final mixer by a 2-foot water-jacketed umbilical cord containing two flow tubes. This final mixer is part of the base holding a 2-mm fluorescence flow-through cuvette. The excitation and observing beams are focused to intersect at a point in the middle of the quartz cuvette. An anaerobic sample of CerHbCO containing little or no free ligand was mixed with 3/4, 1/2, 1/4, and 1/10 atm NO (1500, 1000, 500, and 200 μm, respectively). Photolysis of the CerHbCO complex was initiated 100 ms after flow stopped and before any significant displacement of CO. Then the complete absorbance change for NO binding to the newly generated deoxy-CerHb was followed at 436 nm. At least four time courses representing new mixtures of CerHbCO and NO were averaged to reduce the signal to noise ratio. This approach avoids the difficulty of photolyzing CerHbNO, which has an extremely small quantum yield. The value of k′NO was determined from the slope of kobs versus [NO]. O2 association and dissociation time courses were determined after complete laser photolysis of CerHbCO samples using the 500-ns dye laser (34Olson J.S. Foley E.W. Maillett D.H. Paster E.V.

In these reactions, CerHbCO is prepared in buffer containing ∼50 μm CO and 1250 μm O2, 750 μm CO and 250 μm O2, 500 μm CO and 500 μm O2, and 250 μm CO and 750 μm O2. The laser pulse photolyzes the CerHbCO complex, generating deoxy-CerHb, which can then react rapidly with either ligand. The rate of this initial rapid bimolecular rebinding phase, kfast, is monitored by a large decrease in absorbance of unliganded CerHb at 436 nm and is dominated by O2 rebinding because of its larger association rate coefficient. The value of kfast is given by Equation 1, kfast=k'O2[O2]+kO2+k'CO[CO](Eq. 1) CO dissociation can be neglected because the absolute value of kCO is ∼0.01 s-1, whereas under the conditions of the laser experiments, kfast = 10,000–300,000 s-1. The O2 dissociation rates, kO2, for the WT and mutant CerHbO2 samples (10–300 s-1, Tables 1 and 2) also make a negligible contribution to the observed rate coefficients for the fast phase.TABLE 1Rate and equilibrium constants for O2 and CO binding to position 44(E7) mutants of CerHb at pH 7.0, 20 °C Two phases of roughly equal amplitudes were observed for O2 association with and dissociation from Trp-44 CerHb, and rate parameters for each phase are reported.Mutantsk′O2kO2KO2k′COkCOKCOM (KCO/KO2)μm–1 s–1s–1μm–1μm–1 s–1s–1μm–1Ala-44160 (180)aThe rate constants given in parentheses were measured previously with different preparations of position 44 mutants and were described in Refs. 21,32.

https://openalex.org/W2044470688,"Correlational studies strongly suggest that both genetic similarity and heterozygosity can influence female mate choice. However, the influence of each variable has usually been tested independently, although similarity and heterozygosity might be correlated. We experimentally determined the relative influence of genetic similarity and heterozygosity in divorce and re-mating in the monogamous endoparasite Schistosoma mansoni.We performed sequential infections of vertebrate hosts with controlled larval populations of parasites, where sex and individual genetic diversity and similarity were predetermined before infection. Divorce rate increased significantly when females were given the opportunity to increase genetic dissimilarity through re-mating with a new partner, independently of the intensity of male-male competition. We found however no evidence for females attempting to maximize the level of heterozygosity of their reproductive partner through divorce.Female preference for genetically dissimilar males should result in more heterozygous offspring. Because genetic heterozygosity might partly determine the ability of parasites to counter host resistance, adaptive divorce could be an important factor in the evolutionary arms race between schistosomes and their hosts."

In contrast, in the bacterial system, several cytosolic chaperones were described to be involved in Tat transport processes. Therefore, we have examined whether stromal or peripherally associated membrane proteins also play a role in Tat transport across the thylakoid membrane. Analyzing both authentic precursors as well as the chimeric 16/23 protein, which allows us to study each step of the translocation process individually, we demonstrate that a soluble form of TatA is present in the chloroplast stroma, which significantly improves the efficiency of Tat-dependent protein transport.

Finally, the Tat substrate is presumably released into the membrane for proteolytic removal of the signal peptide (23Frielingsdorf S. Klósgen R.B. J. Biol.

The thylakoidal Tat pathway is generally assumed to act independently from soluble factors or nucleoside triphosphates (24Mould R.M. Shackleton J.B. Robinson C. J. Biol.

In contrast, in bacterial Tat systems, several chaperones were found to bind the precursor proteins prior to translocation (26Graubner W. Schierhorn A. Brúser T. J. Biol.

Therefore, it was the goal of this study to examine in detail the potential involvement of stromal and peripherally associated thylakoid membrane proteins on the individual steps of Tat-dependent protein transport. Protein Transport Experiments—Isolation of chloroplasts and thylakoids was carried out according to Ref. 17Hou B. Frielingsdorf S. Klósgen R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar. Protein transport experiments with radiolabeled precursor proteins followed published protocols (5Marques J.P. Dudeck I. Klósgen R.B. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2003; 269: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Protein extraction of thylakoids with solutions of chaotropic salts prior to transport experiments was performed as described (34Karnauchov I. Herrmann R.G. Klósgen R.B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Preparation of Stromal Extract—For the preparation of stromal extract, chloroplasts were lysed by osmotic shock for 10 min on ice at 0.75 mg of chlorophyll/ml in HM buffer (10 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 8.0; 5 mm MgCl2). Thylakoids were sedimented by centrifugation for 5 min at 20,000 × g at 4 °C. To completely remove chloroplast envelope membranes and residual thylakoid membranes from the soluble fraction, the supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. Stromal extract was concentrated using Vivaspin 5.000 MWCO PES ultrafiltration columns (Sartorius AG, Göttingen, Germany), frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until use. TatA Depletion of Stromal Extract—50 μl of 10-fold concentrated stromal extract were supplemented with NaCl (180 mm final concentration) and 4 μg of affinity-purified TatA antibodies and incubated for 1 h at 4°C on a slowly rotating wheel. 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (10% (w/v) (GE Healthcare, München, Germany) in HM-NaCl buffer (10 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 8.0; 5 mm MgCl2; 180 mm NaCl) were added and incubated for 1 h at 4°C on the rotating wheel. Protein A-Sepharose was sedimented by centrifugation for 10 min at 3000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed twice with HM-NaCl buffer. All supernatants were pooled and concentrated to a volume of 50 μl using Vivaspin 5.000 MWCO PES ultrafiltration columns (Sartorius AG, Göttingen, Germany) to yield TatA-depleted 10-fold concentrated stromal extract. The protein A-Sepharose pellet was finally resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for further analysis. In Vitro Synthesis of TatA—TatA synthesis was carried out with the Rapid Translation System (RTS) wheat germ linear template generation set and the RTS 100 wheat germ CECF kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) using the following primers: 5′-ctttaagaaggagatataccatggccttcttcggtctaggc-3′ and 5′-tgatgatgagaaccccccccttatcatacattatcctttgtg-3′. The translation start codon was set to the predicted stromal processing peptidase cleavage site at amino acid position 56 of the precursor protein according to Ref. 35Fincher V. Dabney-Smith C. Cline K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4930-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar. It should be noted that the TatA cDNA used here deviates at one nucleotide position from the published sequence (accession number AAD33943), leading to a conservative amino acid exchange from glutamate to aspartate at position 127 of the precursor protein. Miscellaneous—Gel electrophoresis of proteins under denaturing conditions was carried out according to Ref. 36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar. Blue Native gel electrophoresis (37Schágger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar) was carried out according to Ref. 21Berghófer J. Klósgen R.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar. The gels were exposed to phosphorimaging screens and analyzed with the Fujifilm FLA-3000 (Fujifilm, Düsseldorf, Germany) using the software packages BASReader (version 3.14) and AIDA (version 3.25) (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). Western analysis of Tat proteins was carried out as described (38Vachereau A. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All other methods followed published protocols (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Second Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). NaBr Treatment of Thylakoid Vesicles Abolishes Tat-dependent Protein Translocation—It is generally assumed that Tat-dependent protein transport across the thylakoid membrane operates independently from soluble factors because it is observed also in isolated thylakoid vesicles resuspended in buffer (24Mould R.M. Shackleton J.B. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17286-17289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, such assays are not completely devoid of stromal factors because several stromal proteins tend to associate peripherally with thylakoid membranes from the stromal side and are thus co-isolated to a certain extent with the thylakoids upon organelle fractionation (40Reisinger V. Eichacker L.A. Proteomics. 2007; 7: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To examine whether such membrane-attached stroma proteins play a role in the transport process, thylakoids were additionally treated with NaBr solutions to remove all peripherally associated proteins and subsequently subjected to protein transport experiments analyzing the authentic precursor proteins of the 16- and 23-kDa subunits of the oxygen-evolving system associated with photosystem II. In neither case were significant amounts of the respective mature proteins, which are indicative of membrane transport and terminal processing, found with such thylakoids (Fig. 1A). This is in accord with previously described results (17Hou B. Frielingsdorf S. Klósgen R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and confirms that treatment with solutions of chaotropic salts interferes with Tat-dependent protein translocation, presumably due to the extraction of an essential component of the transport machinery. Thylakoid Transport Can Be Recovered by Stromal Extracts—Inhibition of transport is, however, reversible because when fractions of the NaBr-treated thylakoids are resuspended in stromal extract prior to the addition of the precursor proteins, mature 16- and 23-kDa proteins accumulate to considerable levels (Fig. 1A). This finding suggests that translocation activity had been restored. Although translocation efficiency is not fully recovered, most likely due to destruction of some thylakoids upon extraction, it is certainly high enough to demonstrate the activity of a stromal component capable of reconstituting Tat-dependent protein transport previously impaired or inhibited by extraction with chaotropic salts. The stromal extract is enzymatically active, as indicated by cleavage of the precursor of the 23-kDa protein to the stromal intermediate by the stromal processing peptidase (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, the extract is devoid of residual envelope and thylakoid membranes because it was subjected to ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g prior to addition to the assays. This indicates that the component capable of reconstituting Tat-dependent protein transport is soluble in aqueous solution. To determine which step of the translocation process is impaired by NaBr treatment, the chimeric 16/23 protein, which consists of the transit peptide of the 16-kDa subunit and the mature part of the 23-kDa subunit, both from the oxygen-evolving system, was analyzed by an analogous approach. Tat-dependent thylakoid transport of this chimeric protein is known to be significantly retarded (17Hou B. Frielingsdorf S. Klósgen R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) so that distinct translocation intermediates indicative of individual steps in the translocation process can be identified (Fig. 1B, right panel). The early translocation intermediate (Ti-1) adopts a loop conformation within the membrane prior to the actual translocation step, whereas translocation intermediate-2 (Ti-2) is characterized by a bitopic transmembrane conformation representing the membrane-bound stage after translocation of the passenger protein across the membrane. Upon protease treatment, two characteristic degradation products of 14 and 26 kDa permit detection of these two intermediates (Fig. 1B, left panel) (17Hou B. Frielingsdorf S. Klósgen R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thylakoid transport experiments analyzing the 16/23 chimera with NaBr-treated thylakoids showed that Ti-1 still accumulated, which demonstrates that binding of the precursor protein to the membrane is not affected. Formation of Ti-1 under these conditions was actually expected because the first step in the translocation process can take place independently of proteinaceous components by direct interaction of the precursor protein with the lipid phase (17Hou B. Frielingsdorf S. Klósgen R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 355: 957-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In contrast, Ti-2 formation and subsequent maturation of the protein are prevented with NaBr-treated thylakoids, demonstrating that in such vesicles, the actual translocation step is blocked (Fig. 1B). As observed for the authentic precursors described above, translocation was recovered to a considerable degree if the NaBr-treated thylakoids were resuspended in stroma rather than in buffer. In this instance, both Ti-2 and the terminal-processing product can again be detected, proving that a component of the stromal extract is capable of compensating for the translocation arrest between Ti-1 and Ti-2 that is observed with NaBr-treated thylakoids. Stromal Extract Improves the Efficiency of Tat-dependent Protein Translocation—To test whether stroma also has an effect on the transport activity of untreated thylakoid vesicles, thylakoids were resuspended in either buffer or stromal extract after lysis of the chloroplasts and assayed in protein transport experiments by analyzing the 16/23 chimera. Quantification of the signals obtained from the two experimental approaches showed that both Ti-2 and the mature 23-kDa protein accumulate in ∼2-fold higher amounts in those thylakoids that had been resuspended in stroma rather than in HM buffer (Fig. 1C). In line with this observation, the amount of Ti-1 is accordingly reduced to ∼50% in such assays. This apparent reduction is presumably not a result of reduced membrane binding of the protein but instead caused by an enhanced membrane translocation activity of the respective thylakoid vesicles. Thus, stromal components apparently promote the process of Tat-dependent protein transport even of untreated thylakoids by improving the efficiency of the actual membrane translocation step from Ti-1 to Ti-2. To determine the optimal NaBr concentration for membrane extraction, thylakoids were treated with NaBr solutions ranging from 0.2 to 2 m, resuspended in either buffer or stromal extract, and subjected to protein transport assays analyzing the 16/23 chimera. It turned out that even pretreatment of thylakoids with NaBr solutions of low concentration (0.2–0.4 m) had a remarkable inhibitory effect on the transport process. The accumulation of Ti-2 and the mature 23-kDa protein was significantly reduced in these assays, and protein translocation was to a large extent, although not entirely, arrested at the stage of Ti-1 (Fig. 2). In line with the results described above, this transport block was almost completely overridden in the presence of stromal extract. However, pretreatment of the thylakoids with solutions of 1.7 m NaBr or even higher concentration led to a virtually irreversible loss of transport activity, even in the presence of stromal extract (Fig. 2). For our experiments aiming to characterize the promoting effect of stroma on Tat-dependent protein transport, thylakoids treated with solutions of ∼0.8–1.0 m NaBr turned out to be most suitable because they showed only minimal residual transport activity when resuspended in buffer but still allowed significant recovery of translocation activity in the presence of stromal extracts. Transport Recovery Depends on Stromal Concentration and Is Also Observed with Prebound Precursor Protein—Next, we wanted to determine whether the extent to which Tat-dependent transport of NaBr-treated thylakoids can be recovered depends on the concentration of the stromal extract present in the assay. This made sense because upon preparation of the stromal extract by chloroplast lysis, the stromal components are inevitably diluted at least 10-fold. To compensate for this effect, the stromal extracts were concentrated by ultrafiltration either 5-fold or 10-fold prior to their analysis in thylakoid transport experiments. It turned out that the stimulating effect of stromal extract is indeed significantly stronger if the thylakoids were resuspended in stromal extracts of higher concentration (Fig. 3A), suggesting that recovery of transport activity is a concentration-dependent process. Although the degree of transport recovery varies to some extent between individual experiments and is presumably dependent on the residual transport activity of the thylakoids after NaBr treatment (between 3 and 10% of untreated thylakoids; data not shown), with a stromal extract concentrated 10-fold, a level of ∼50% of the control reaction analyzing untreated thylakoids was achieved (Fig. 3, A and B). Remarkably, the transport-promoting stromal component need not be present in the soluble fraction during transport but can be attached to the thylakoids prior to the actual transport experiment. If NaBr-treated thylakoids are incubated for 10 min with 10-fold concentrated stromal extract, washed extensively with HM buffer to remove loosely attached stromal components, and subsequently analyzed in thylakoid transport experiments with the 16/23 chimera, these “preloaded” thylakoids showed ∼20% of the transport activity found with untreated control thylakoids (Fig. 3B), a rate that is similar to the transport recovery obtained in the presence of 5-fold concentrated stromal extract (Fig. 3A). This “preloading” effect is apparently not temperature-dependent because it is observed irrespective of whether the incubation of the thylakoids with stromal extract is performed on ice or at room temperature (Fig. 3B). In a reciprocal approach, we examined whether a precursor protein arrested in the Ti-1 conformation could still be recognized as substrate if the transport competence of the thylakoids was reconstituted by the addition of stromal extract. For this purpose, NaBr-treated thylakoids were incubated with the 16/23 precursor protein on ice for 2 min to allow binding and Ti-1 formation. The thylakoids were extensively washed with HM buffer to remove loosely attached precursor proteins and subsequently resuspended in either stromal extract concentrated 10-fold or HM buffer. As expected, the 16/23 chimera remained arrested in its Ti-1 conformation in the absence of stromal components. However, if the assays were supplemented with stromal extract, significant amounts of Ti-2 accumulated, which is indicative of membrane transport of the passenger protein (Fig. 3B). Even processing to the mature 23-kDa protein can be observed, although to a minor extent only. The Transport-promoting Stromal Component Operates Independently of Nucleoside Triphosphates—The data obtained so far strongly suggest that the stromal component responsible for the transport recovery of NaBr-treated thylakoids is a soluble factor that has the capacity to interact with the thylakoid membrane. The most obvious candidates for such factors are chaperones, in particular because several chaperones were found in bacterial systems to be involved in binding of Tat substrates (41Sargent F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2007; 35: 835-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The activity of the majority of chaperones depends on nucleoside triphosphates (42Netzer W.J. Hartl F.U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 68-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and therefore, we examined whether the transport-stimulating effect of stromal extracts was modified by apyrase-mediated degradation of nucleoside triphosphates or by supplementing the stromal extracts with additional ATP, ADP, or the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs ATPγS and AMP-PNP. Despite some variability in the individual assays, it is apparent that none of these substances had a significant effect on the transport recovery of NaBr-treated thylakoids by stromal extract because in all fractions, similar amounts of Ti-2 and mature protein could be detected (Fig. 3C). This demonstrates that the “stromal effect” is not directly dependent on the presence of hydrolyzable nucleoside triphosphates, which makes it unlikely that chaperones are responsible. The TatBC-Receptor Complex Is Resistant to NaBr Extraction—To examine to what extent the subunits of the Tat translocase are sensitive to extraction by solutions of chaotropic salts, thylakoids were treated with NaBr solution, recovered by centrifugation, and subjected to Western analyses using polyclonal antisera raised against TatA, TatB, and TatC. The supernatant of the centrifugation step containing all extracted membrane components was analyzed in parallel, together with untreated thylakoids and stromal extracts (Fig. 4A). To allow for direct comparison of the distribution of the corresponding proteins in the different fractions, stoichiometric amounts of each fraction (equivalent to 15 μg of chlorophyll) were examined. It turned out that neither TatB nor TatC was extracted to a significant extent from the thylakoids by NaBr treatment. In accord with this finding, neither of the two proteins could be detected in the stromal fraction, demonstrating that they cannot be responsible for the transport-promoting activity of stromal extracts. Nevertheless, NaBr treatment might disturb the functional properties of the thylakoidal TatBC-receptor complex, e.g. its affinity to Tat substrates like the 16/23 precursor protein (21Berghófer J. Klósgen R.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23Frielingsdorf S. Klósgen R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24455-24462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To examine such substrate binding properties, both NaBr-treated thylakoids and untreated thylakoids were incubated with radiolabeled 16/23 protein and subjected to Blue Native-PAGE and phosphorimaging. Remarkably, it turned out that NaBr pretreatment led to increased amounts of receptor-associated 16/23 protein (Fig. 4B). Thus, prevention of the actual membrane translocation step apparently causes a kind of “traffic jam” within the Tat translocase, which results in increased precursor accumulation at the TatBC-receptor complex. This demonstrates that NaBr extraction does not affect the receptor function of TatB and TatC. Stromal TatA Restores Transport Activity to NaBr-extracted Thylakoids—In contrast to what was found above for TatBC, the majority of TatA was removed from thylakoid membranes upon NaBr treatment (Fig. 4A), which could explain the block in protein translocation observed. Unexpectedly, significant amounts of TatA were even detected in the stromal fraction (Fig. 4A), which is the first hint that TatA might be the stromal component that is capable of restoring the transport properties to NaBr-treated thylakoids. To examine this possibility in more detail, mature TatA was generated by in vitro translation in the wheat germ RTS. The resulting TatA protein showed a slightly greater mobility upon SDS-PAGE when compared with TatA isolated from pea chloroplasts (Fig. 5C). This might either be a consequence of the initiating methionine residue added to the N terminus of the protein or indicate a mistake in the prediction of the cleavage site for the stromal processing peptidase. However, because an identical TatA protein has previously been shown to be active in translocation (35Fincher V. Dabney-Smith C. Cline K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4930-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), in neither case was the function of the protein apparently affected. Indeed, supplementation of NaBr-treated thylakoids with TatA generated in vitro led to a clear increase in protein transport activity (Fig. 5A). This increase was all the more remarkable considering the fact that wheat germ RTS not expressing TatA caused inhibition of Tat-dependent protein transport to some extent (36% of the control reaction, Fig. 5A). This inhibition is probably due to reduced binding of the precursor protein to the thylakoids in the presence of RTS because formation of Ti-1 is likewise reduced to ∼40% (Fig. 5A). To examine the presumed function of TatA as the stromal transport recovery factor of NaBr-treated thylakoids using an independent approach, TatA was depleted from stromal extracts by immunoprecipitation with affinity-purified TatA antibodies. Analysis of NaBr-treated thylakoids that were resuspended in TatA-depleted stromal extracts showed that they were incapable of translocating the 16/23 chimera, i.e. transport of this protein remained arrested at the stage of Ti-1 (Fig. 5B). Thus, stromal TatA is indeed the factor that is responsible for the recovery of the protein transport activity of NaBr-treated thylakoids by stromal extracts. A series of control experiments was conducted to verify these findings. First, NaCl, which had to be added to the stromal extracts upon TatA depletion to prevent unspecific binding of proteins to the affinity matrix, did not show any inhibitory effect if added to thylakoid transport assays in which the 16/23 chimera was analyzed (Fig. 5B). Second, it was important to examine the efficiency of both the depletion reaction and the subsequent removal of the TatA antibodies. Because neither residual TatA nor antibody heavy chains could be detected in the supernatant of the stroma depletion assays (Fig. 5C), both reactions were apparently quantitative. Furthermore, the fact that a stromal protein with a molecular mass of ∼80 kDa, which cross-reacts with TatA antibodies under denaturing conditions, is detected in comparable amounts in untreated and TatA-depleted stromal extracts (Fig. 5C, marked as x) demonstrates that the depletion reaction was specific for TatA and confirms that these stromal extracts contain equal amounts of proteins, except for TatA. In the present study, we examined the involvement of stromal components on Tat-dependent protein transport across the thylakoid membrane. We could show that a stromal extract improves thylakoidal transport efficiency (Fig. 1C) and can even reconstitute Tat-dependent protein transport of thylakoids previously rendered transport-inactive by extraction with NaBr solutions (Figs. 1, 2, 3). Interestingly, this effect is apparently not caused by stromal chaperones because it is independent of the presence of hydrolyzable nucleoside triphosphates (Fig. 3C), which distinguishes it from the observed influence of cytosolic chaperones on Tat-dependent protein transport in bacteria (41Sargent F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2007; 35: 835-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Instead, our data demonstrate that the component responsible for this effect is soluble TatA, which is capable of triggering the actual membrane translocation step during Tat-dependent protein transport (Fig. 5). Although TatA is described as an integral thylakoid membrane component (13Mori H. Summer E.J. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), it is easily extracted from thylakoid membranes by weak chaotropic salts such as NaBr (Fig. 4). Furthermore, it is also present in the chloroplast stroma, in line with previous reports describing soluble cytoplasmic forms of TatA in B. subtilis, S. lividans, and E. coli (30Berthelmann F.

FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The fact that the topology of TatA within the membrane is also a matter of debate (43Chan C.S. Zlomislic M.R. Tieleman D.P. Turner R.J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 7396-7404Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 44Gouffi K. Gérard F. Santini C.L. Wu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11608-11615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) suggests that the localization and/or topology of TatA might change during the transport process, possibly depending on its activity status. Loosely anchored TatA might thus represent an intermediate stage between stromal and tightly anchored membrane forms of the protein. Taken together, the presumed role of TatA as an obligatory membrane component of the thylakoidal Tat machinery needs to be scrutinized, and the role of stromal factors during Tat-dependent transport has to be reconsidered. Stromal TatA Is Not Required for Precursor Targeting to the Thylakoid Membrane—In bacterial systems, soluble forms of TatA were proposed to function in targeting of precursor proteins to the membrane-bound Tat transport machinery (31Pop O.I. Westermann M. Volkmer-Engert R. Schulz D. Lemke C. Schreiber S. Gerlach R. Wetzker R. Múller J.P. J. Biol.

The early steps of thylakoidal Tat transport, i.e. targeting and binding of the precursor protein to the TatBC-receptor complex, can efficiently take place in the absence of stromal extract even with NaBr-treated thylakoids significantly depleted of membrane-bound TatA (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, an interaction of Tat substrate and TatA in stromal extracts could not be detected upon co-immunoprecipitation experiments (data not shown). Thus, it seems that membrane targeting of precursor proteins by soluble TatA is restricted to bacterial Tat systems, possibly even to those from Gram-positive bacteria. The Potential Role of Stromal TatA in the Translocation Process—It appears that stromal TatA is involved in the actual membrane transport step, probably the transition of Tat substrates from Ti-1 to Ti-2. If soluble TatA is added to thylakoids having precursor protein in the Ti-1 conformation bound to the TatBC-receptor complex, membrane translocation of the mature part is initiated, and both Ti-2 and mature protein can be detected (Fig. 3B). It is widely assumed that a hydrophilic pore (or channel) composed predominantly or exclusively of TatA is required for this transport step (41Sargent F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2007; 35: 835-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and it was even suggested that pore complexes of different sizes exist as preformed units within the membrane (45Gohlke U. Pullan L. McDevitt C.A. Porcelli I. de Leeuw E. Palmer T. Saibil H.R. Berks B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10482-10486Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Because TatA is found in several high molecular weight complexes in the stroma (data not shown), similar to TatA from B. subtilis (32Westermann M. Pop O.I. Gerlach R. Appel T.R. Schlórmann W. Schreiber S. Múller J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1758: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), one could speculate that those might represent such pore complexes, in analogy to the detergent-solubilized TatA complexes described for bacteria (45Gohlke U. Pullan L. McDevitt C.A. Porcelli I. de Leeuw E. Palmer T. Saibil H.R. Berks B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10482-10486Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). However, the following considerations argue against such a scenario. In contrast to detergent-solubilized TatA complexes, which can expose their membrane anchors to the hydrophobic parts of the detergent molecules, the N-terminal hydrophobic regions of stromal TatA must somehow be shielded against the hydrophilic stroma to prevent precipitation of the protein. It appears likely that such shielding is facilitated by orienting the hydrophobic regions of several TatA molecules to each other, resulting in TatA complexes of high molecular weight that expose only their hydrophilic domains to the aqueous solution. This would be in line with the soluble micelle-like TatA complexes that were described for TatA in B. subtilis (32Westermann M. Pop O.I. Gerlach R. Appel T.R. Schlórmann W. Schreiber S. Múller J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1758: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the stromal TatA complexes might also be related to the polymeric tubular TatA structures that were recently found in the cytoplasm of E. coli after overproduction of TatA (30Berthelmann F. Mehner D. Richter S. Lindenstrauss U. Lúnsdorf H. Hause G. Brúser T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 25281-25289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In both scenarios, stromal TatA would have to be significantly restructured upon integration into the thylakoid membrane to provide the hydrophilic environment of a gated pore for the protein to be translocated, which strongly argues against their function as preformed pore complexes. Instead, a kind of reservoir or storage function of yet unused TatA molecules appears more likely. Nevertheless, it remains to be shown whether the stromal form of TatA is directly involved in protein translocation or whether it first has to be inserted into the thylakoid membrane to exert its function. However, there is an even more plausible explanation for the function of stromal TatA. Assuming that TatA indeed accumulates in the stroma in analogy to detergent molecules in micelle-like structures, these TatA micelles presumably also share the membrane-interacting properties of detergents, i.e. they should be able to reversibly insert into lipid bilayers. Such spontaneous insertion of thylakoidal TatA into lipid bilayers has previously been described (35Fincher V. Dabney-Smith C. Cline K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4930-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Together with the remarkable stoichiometric variability of the Tat subunits in different systems, which can vary from excess to substoichiometric amounts of TatA versus TatB and TatC (46Jakob, M., Kaiser, S., Gutensohn, M., Hanner, P., and Klósgen, R. B. (September 30, 2008) Biochim. Biophys. Acta–Mol. Cell Res. 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2008.09.006Google Scholar), these findings rather favor a model in which TatA mediates Tat-dependent protein translocation by a yet undefined “membrane weakening” mechanism (47Natale P. Brúser T. Driessen A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 1735-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). We thank Gary Sawers for review of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2051592296,"In a previous study, we examined thermodynamic parameters for 20 alanine mutants inβ-lactamase inhibitory protein (BLIP) for binding to TEM-1 β-lactamase. Here we have determined the structures of two thermodynamically distinctive complexes of BLIP mutants with TEM-1 β-lactamase. The complex BLIP Y51A-TEM-1 is a tight binding complex with the most negative binding heat capacity change (ΔG = ∼-13 kcal mol-1 and ΔCp = ∼-0.8 kcal mol-1 K-1) among all of the mutants, whereas BLIP W150A-TEM-1 is a weak complex with one of the least negative binding heat capacity changes (ΔG = ∼-8.5 kcal mol-1 and ΔCp = ∼-0.27 kcal mol-1 K-1). We previously determined that BLIP Tyr51 is a canonical and Trp150 an anti-canonical TEM-1-contact residue, where canonical refers to the alanine substitution resulting in a matched change in the hydrophobicity of binding free energy. Structure determination indicates a rearrangement of the interactions between Asp49 of the W150A BLIP mutant and the catalytic pocket of TEM-1. The Asp49 of W150A moves more than 4 Å to form two new hydrogen bonds while losing four original hydrogen bonds. This explains the anti-canonical nature of the Trp150 to alanine substitution, and also reveals a strong long distance coupling between Trp150 and Asp49 of BLIP, because these two residues are more than 25 Å apart. Kinetic measurements indicate that the mutations influence the dissociation rate but not the association rate. Further analysis of the structures indicates that an increased number of interface-trapped water molecules correlate with poor interface packing in a mutant. It appears that the increase of interface-trapped water molecules is inversely correlated with negative binding heat capacity changes.

Protein-protein interactions play essential roles in most biological processes, from the control of enzymatic catalysis to signal transduction. Recent advances in structural biology have revealed the complexity of structure-function relationships in protein-protein interactions (1Janin J. Rodier F. Chakrabarti P. Bahadur R.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2007; 63: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 2Janin J. Science. 2008; 319: 165-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Many factors that influence the strength of a binding interaction have been recognized (3Nooren I.M. Thornton J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3486-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). The design of new protein-specific binding partners is beginning to show some results but is not yet generally applicable (4Fletcher S. Hamilton A.D. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2007; 7: 922-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 5Grueninger D. Treiber N. Ziegler M.O. Koetter J.W. Schulze M.S. Schulz G.E.

A protein-protein binding interaction typically involves many contact residues and a relatively large interface that is rather planar. There are several aspects of the contact interface that could play critical roles in the binding interaction, such as the flexibility of the contact residues, chemical and physical complementarity, as well as trapped solvent molecules in the interface (1Janin J. Rodier F. Chakrabarti P. Bahadur R.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2007; 63: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 8Chothia C. Janin J.

Alanine-scanning mutagenesis results indicate that only a small fraction of the contact residues contribute significantly to the binding free energy. Substitution of these hotspot contact residues with alanine results in a large loss in binding free energy (more than 2 kcal) (10Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1782) Google Scholar, 11Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 390-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Understanding this phenomenon is an active area of research in the structural biology of protein interactions. An in-depth and thorough assessment of binding characteristics of these alanine-substituted mutants will provide an increased understanding of the interactions. β-Lactamases are enzymes produced by bacteria that provide resistance to β-lactam antibiotics, which are the most widely used antimicrobial therapeutics. β-Lactamases provide for resistance to these antibiotics by selectively cleaving the active peptide bond in the β-lactam ring. There are four major classes of β-lactamases (A-D) (12Bush K. Jacoby G.A. Medeiros A.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2119) Google Scholar) with the class A β-lactamases being the most widespread in the clinical setting (12Bush K. Jacoby G.A. Medeiros A.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2119) Google Scholar). Among the class A β-lactamases, TEM-1 is the most prevalent among Gram-negative bacteria and has been a subject of concern because it has a broad specificity to hydrolyze a wide array of β-lactam-based antibiotics (13Majiduddin F.K. Materon I.C. Palzkill T.G. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2002; 292: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). BLIP 2The abbreviations used are: BLIP, β-lactamase inhibitory protein; PEG, polyethylene glycol; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.2The abbreviations used are: BLIP, β-lactamase inhibitory protein; PEG, polyethylene glycol; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. is a 165-amino acid protein produced by the soil bacterium Streptomyces clavuligerus that potently inhibits the TEM-1 β-lactamase (14Strynadka N.C.

Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). BLIP has a tandem repeat structure of a 76-amino acid αβ domain. These two tandem domains form a β-saddle with a relatively hydrophobic concave surface. The concave saddle surface of BLIP binds on the loop-helix region of TEM-1 and extends two loops into the substrate binding pocket of TEM-1. The Asp49 residue of BLIP on one of the loops (loop1) occupies the catalytic site of TEM-1 (15Strynadka N.C. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A BLIP-TEM-1 complex structure is shown in Fig. 1A. The BLIP-β-lactamase complex has become a protein-protein interaction model system with increasingly more detailed information on structure-function relationships becoming available (15Strynadka N.C.

Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of residues on the BLIP binding surface revealed the following: 1) there are two hotspots of binding energy, and 2) one mutation (Y50A) actually increases binding affinity for TEM-1 by 50-fold (17Zhang Z. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45706-45712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Our lab previously determined the complete binding thermodynamics of the available alanine-substituted mutants of BLIP that are involved in complex formation with TEM-1 β-lactamase. In that study, the isoenthalpic temperature (temperature at which the binding enthalpy is zero) was used to gauge the role of hydrophobicity in binding. An increase in the isoenthalpic temperature suggests an increase in the hydrophobic nature of the binding. A contact residue whose alanine substitution results in a matched change in isoenthalpic temperature with the contribution of hydrophobicity to binding is called canonical. For example, a charged contact residue is deemed canonical if its alanine substitution, which increases hydrophobicity, also exhibits an increase in the binding isoenthalpic temperature. In contrast, a residue whose alanine substitution results in a nonmatching change in isoenthalpic temperature and hydrophobic contribution to binding is termed anti-canonical. Canonical hotspot contact residues likely contribute directly to the driving force for binding. Anti-canonical hotspot contact residues, however, likely provide binding driving forces indirectly through energetically coupled changes linked to other contact residues (16Wang J. Zhang Z. Palzkill T. Chow D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17676-17684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The previous thermodynamics experiments also revealed a large variation in binding heat capacity changes in complex formation between the various BLIP mutants and β-lactamase. This leads to the question of what is the information content of the heat capacity changes. Here a detailed analysis of two complexes was performed to extend the previous studies and address the following two issues. 1) What changes in the contact interface and binding interactions are associated with alanine substitutions? 2) What are the effects of the alanine substitutions on the binding kinetics of complex formation? This information, in conjunction with the previously determined thermodynamic information, provides another level of detail toward understanding the driving forces in protein-protein interactions. The results provide some insight into the long observed variation among binding heat capacity changes and buried surface area. It is unclear why the relationship between buried surface area and binding heat capacity changes is so unpredictable. The results obtained in this study argue that binding heat capacity changes are related to a combination of changes in the buried surface area and the number of trapped solvent molecules. The results suggest that the origin of the increased number of trapped water molecules is subtle structural mismatches in the interface introduced by an alanine substitution. These mismatches disrupt short range binding interactions that directly impact the dissociation process, which in turn modulates the binding free energy. Materials—Talon resin was purchased from Clontech. Ion-exchange media and columns (Mono Q 5/50 GL, HighTrap Q, Q-Sepharose Fast Flow, and DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow) and sizing columns (Superdex 75 10/300, Superdex 75 prep grade, and Superdex 200 10/300 GL) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Cephalosporin C was purchased from Sigma (product name cephalosporin C zinc salt, 22237 BioChemika). All other reagents were reagent grade from Sigma. Crystallization screening kits were purchased from Hampton Research, Emerald Biostructure Inc., and Nextal Biotechnologies (Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Reagents used in crystallization were of the highest purity available from Sigma. Filter concentrators were from Millipore Inc. (Amicon concentrators) and from Sartorius Group (Vivaspin concentrators). Protein Expression and Purification—All expression DNA clones were constructed previously, and the proteins were expressed and purified using a previously described procedure (16Wang J. Zhang Z. Palzkill T. Chow D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17676-17684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 17Zhang Z. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45706-45712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, Escherichia coli bacteria (strain RB791) containing the BLIP mutant expression plasmid were grown in LB media containing 17.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C from a single clone and induced with 2 mm lactose and 1% glycerol instead of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the absorbance at 600 nm was ∼1.2. The culture was further grown for 6 h and harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 6 °C. The bacterial pellets were resuspended in B-PER bacterial protein extraction solution (Pierce) or a prepared equivalent (1% Triton X-100 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) at a ratio of 15 ml for 1 g of bacterial pellet. The resuspensions were vigorously shaken for 20 min at room temperature and then centrifuged at high speed (15,000 rpm in a Beckman type 35 rotor) for 30 min. The supernatants were mixed by stirring with Talon cobalt resin overnight. The Talon cobalt resin was allowed to settle by gravity and then collected and washed three times. The bound BLIP mutant proteins were eluted from the Talon cobalt resins using 150 mm imidazole in TBS, and then further purified on a Superdex-75 sizing column. The bacteria containing the TEM-1 β-lactamase expression plasmid DNA were grown at 37 °C and induced at A600 nm ∼0.6 with 0.3 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. The expressed periplasmic protein TEM-1 was extracted by osmotic shock in which bacteria were soaked with 20% sucrose solution at room temperature and centrifuged, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 5 mm ice-cold magnesium sulfate. The osmotic shock fluid was fractionated on a DEAE column in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7 with 100 mm NaCl. Flow-through material was diluted 10-fold with distilled water and fractionated on the DEAE column again. TEM-1 β-lactamase was eluted with a 0-2 m NaCl gradient in Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.0. The protein was further purified using a Superdex-75 sizing column in 50 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 with 150 mm NaCl. The purity of the proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis. Protein concentrations were determined using absorbance measurements at 280 nm with 8 m guanidine HCl denatured protein, based on the theoretically calculated extinction coefficients according to the amino acid sequence. Stopped-flow Fluorescence Spectrometric Measurements of Association—The kinetic association measurements were carried out using an SLM 48000S fluorescence spectrometer equipped with a MilliFlow stopped-flow reactor accessory. Equal concentrations of TEM-1 and BLIP mutants were loaded into the two injection syringes. The excitation wavelength was 286 nm with an 8 nm bandwidth, and the emission wavelength was 330 nm with a 4 nm bandwidth. The instrument has a 10-ms mixing deadtime and can collect data at a 10-ms interval. In this study, we determined the constants only at room temperature (∼25 °C). Typically, 10-20 time course traces were averaged. The association constants were determined by fitting the data with a second order kinetic time course. Enzymatic Activity-based Kinetic Measurements—For slow complex dissociation, the recovery of activity was followed by competitive displacement. The active wild type TEM-1 β-lactamase was first complexed with a BLIP mutant, and then the active TEM-1 was recovered by adding an excess amount of an inactive TEM-1 mutant (S70A). The BLIP mutant binds to the inactive TEM-1 S70A mutant β-lactamase as it is dissociated from the pre-formed complex thus leaving the dissociated wild type TEM-1 as active monomer. The time course of the recovery of the active TEM-1 enzyme activity is an effective first order dissociation. By measuring the TEM-1 activity at various time points after the addition of the inactive TEM-1 S70A mutant, the time course of the recovered activity allowed determination of the dissociation time. The activity was determined using cephalosporin C (100 μm) as substrate in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature. The hydrolysis of cephalosporin C was monitored optically at 280 nm absorbance with an extinction coefficient of 7500 m-1 cm-1. The amount of active enzyme was calculated using [TEM-1] = (V(S + Km)/(S × kcat)), where V and S are hydrolysis rate and cephalosporin concentration, respectively. Km was determined to be 700 μm, and kcat was 11 s-1 (17Zhang Z. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45706-45712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 25Cantu III, C. Huang W. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29144-29150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The time course of the amount of active TEM-1 was fitted with first order kinetics to extrapolate the kinetic parameters. For the fast dissociation of the complex of BLIP W150A-TEM-1, 1 volume of a concentration of 10 μm of preformed W150A-TEM-1 complex was mixed with 7.3 volumes of the assay solution containing cephalosporin C as substrate. This was done by driving the protein solution in a 3-ml syringe and the substrate solution in a 30-ml syringe in a syringe pump. These two streams of solutions were mixed immediately before entering an optical monitoring cell. The estimated time from mixing to optical cell is less than 1 s. The hydrolysis of cephalosporin C was continuously monitored. The recording of the time courses was started when the syringe pump was stopped. The time courses were fitted with on- and off-rates simultaneously. Given the affinity of this complex of 180 nm and the above scheme in the diluted solution, the free TEM-1 will increase from ∼200 to ∼700 nm. This range of the changes in TEM-1 allows kinetic determination with reasonable accuracy. Fluorescence Spectrometric Measurements of Dissociation—An apparatus similar to the dilution enzymatic activity assay was constructed, in which a fluorescence cell optical monitoring cell was used in place of the optical monitoring cell to fit into the fluorescence spectrometer. The mixing syringes were replaced with 1-ml and 50-ml size syringes. A solution of 3 μm premixed BLIP W150A-TEM-1 complex was loaded into the 1-ml syringe and phosphate-buffered saline solution into the 50 ml syringe. Both syringes were mounted on a syringe pump to drive the solution at the same constant piston speed. The sample was mixed with the buffer immediately before entering the fluorescence cell at a ratio of 1:37. The fluorescence signals were recorded at 100-ms intervals. The kinetic recording starts when the flow is stopped, after about 3 ml of the mixture flows through. Our experimental setup requires about 1-2 ml of mixture to flow through for the signal to become stable. Typically the noise level was about 10% of the total fluorescence signal under the conditions of the recording for individual traces. Our estimates (based on fluorescence differences of the bound complex and the unbound proteins and the amount of the dilution and the affinity of the complex) show the signal was about 5% of the fluorescence signal. Multiple traces (more than 50) were averaged to increase the signal to noise. Crystallization Screening and Crystal Quality Improvements—Based on our previous determination of the binding thermodynamics of the interactions between TEM-1 β-lactamase and the BLIP mutants, we selected several thermodynamically distinctive complexes for initial crystallization screens. The selected complexes were Y50A-TEM-1, Y51A-TEM-1, W112A-TEM-1, and W150A-TEM-1. Initial batches of complexes used in the crystallization screens were from resulting complexes of isothermal titration calorimetric measurements reported previously (16Wang J. Zhang Z. Palzkill T. Chow D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17676-17684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The complexes were repurified on an ion-exchange column followed by a sizing column. The repurified complexes were concentrated to more than 10 mg/ml using filter concentrators with a cutoff size of 10 kDa. Crystallization screening was set up in a 96-well plate format using commercial screening kits (crystal screening kits from Hampton Research Inc., Wizard kits from Emerald Biotechnology, and PEGs and MPD and AmSO4 suite screening kits from Qiagen were used in these studies). The high resolution x-ray diffraction quality crystals were crystallized in conditions of 0.1 m phosphate/citric acid, pH 4.4, 14% PEG 8000, 0.1 m NaCl (for the Y51A-TEM-1 complex), and 0.1 m phosphate/citric acid, pH 4.8, 15% PEG 8000, 0.1 m NaCl (for the W150A-TEM-1 complex), and 0.1 m MES, pH 6.9, 2 m NaCl, 0.1 m KH2PO4, 0.1 m NaH2PO4 (for the W112A crystal). Microseeding was used to yield high quality crystals. X-ray Diffraction and Data Collection—The high quality crystals were mounted in cryo-loops and soaked in a cryo-protectant of 20% glycerol in mother liquor and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The x-ray diffraction data were collected at the Gulf Coast Protein Crystallography Consortium synchrotron beamline at the Center for Advanced Microstructures and Devices at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, LA. Data Processing and Refinement—All x-ray diffraction datasets had a resolution that was better than 2.7 Å, with the highest resolution of 2.07 Å. Diffraction data were indexed in P21 symmetry, integrated using DENZO, and scaled using SCALEPACK from the HKL software package (HKL Research Inc. (26Otwinowski Z. Minor. W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38555) Google Scholar)). We converted the merged intensity data into structural factors using the TRUNCATE method in the Scalepack2MTZ program in the CCP4 package, and 5% of data were tagged with free R-flag. Structural Determination and Refinement—The crystal structures were determined by molecular replacement using both Molrep and AmoRe programs in the CCP4 package with one complex from the 1JTG.pdb file (Protein Data Bank (15Strynadka N.C. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar)) as the search model. The resulting structures were refined using program Refmac5 in the CCP4 package at the initial stages. These preliminary structures along with the electron density maps were subjected to manual structure modification, such as changing the mutant sites and adding the TEM-1 residue 214 that was missing in the 1JTG coordinates. These modified structures were further subjected to several cycles of restrained refinement in the Refmac5 program. Afterward, simulated annealing refinement was performed using CNS (27Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16963) Google Scholar). The resulting structures were further refined using TLS and restraint refinement. We added water molecules using the CNS program and additional waters in COOT (28Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23311) Google Scholar). Structural Analysis—The structures were analyzed mostly using the programs from the CCP4 package as follows (29Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19758) Google Scholar). The alignment was carried out for the whole sequences or several segments using the SUPERPOSE program in the CCP4 package. The buried surface area was calculated using AreaiMol program in the CCP4 package with the standard 1.4 Å solvent probe. Hydrogen bonds were calculated using the contact program in the CCP4 package. The shape complementarity statistics (SC value) were calculated using the sc.exe program in the CCP4 package (30Lawrence M.C. Colman P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 946-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). Structure graphic programs used were VMD, CCP4 mg, and Swiss PDB Viewer (31Guex N. Peitsch M.C.

Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1131-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). The selection of the BLIP-β-lactamase complexes for this study was based on an analysis of the binding thermodynamics of BLIP alanine mutants with TEM-1 β-lactamase determined previously (16Wang J. Zhang Z. Palzkill T. Chow D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17676-17684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). One of the selection criteria was to choose complexes with the most discrepant binding heat capacity changes. Among the mutant complexes being studied, the BLIP W150A-TEM-1 complex has one of the least negative binding heat capacity changes (-275 cal/mol/K), whereas the BLIP Y51A-TEM-1 has the most negative binding heat capacity change of -809 cal/mol/K. In addition, the BLIP W150A-TEM-1 complex is the weakest complex (K of ∼2 × 106 m-1), and BLIP Y51A-TEM-1 is one of the tightest complexes (K of ∼1.5 × 109 m-1) (see Fig. 1A for the locations of the residues). We hypothesized that such a large difference could be manifest in some distinctive structural and kinetic features that will provide some insight into the driving forces for binding. It has long been accepted that hydrophobic interactions are the major driving force for protein-protein binding interactions. It is also recognized that binding heat capacity changes are related to buried surface area changes that are in turn related to hydrophobic interactions. However, detailed quantitative assessments have been frustrating due to the inconsistencies of the assessments because of a high system and methodology dependence of the measurements. Because of the difficulties associated with quantitation of the driving forces, a rather general and coarse approach was used here in combination with the experimental data to assess the hydrophobic and nonhydrophobic driving forces. This approach allowed an estimation of the contribution from hydrophobic and nonhydrophobic interactions at an imprecise, yet informative level. Because the approach is imprecise, we elect to use the terms “hydrophobic driving force” and “nonhydrophobic driving force” within the context of this study. The temperature dependence of the binding free energy for each mutant can be described by Equation 1,ΔG0(T)=ΔCp·(T-TH)-T·ΔCp·ln(TTH)-TΔS(TH)Eq. 1 where ΔCp is the experimentally determined binding heat capacity change, TH is the isoenthalpic temperature (at which the binding enthalpy is zero), and ΔS(TH) is the binding entropy at the isoenthalpic temperature. This binding free energy can be separated into two terms as shown in Equations 2 and 3,ΔGhyd0(T)=ΔCp·(T-295)-T·ΔCp·ln(T386)Eq. 2 ΔGnonhyd0(T)=ΔCp·(295-TH)-T·ΔCp·ln(386TH)-TΔS(TH)Eq. 3 where 295 and 386 K are chosen based on the hydrophobic model treatment proposed by Baldwin (34Baldwin R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8069-8072Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). Using this formula implies that the ΔCp is completely because of hydrophobic interactions, a highly debat"
https://openalex.org/W1986885740,"Drosophila is a well-established model to study the molecular basis of neurodegenerative diseases. We carried out a misexpression screen to identify genes involved in neurodegeneration examining locomotor behavior in young and aged flies. We hypothesized that a progressive loss of rhythmic activity could reveal novel genes involved in neurodegenerative mechanisms. One of the interesting candidates showing progressive arrhythmicity has reduced enabled (ena) levels. ena down-regulation gave rise to progressive vacuolization in specific regions of the adult brain. Abnormal staining of pre-synaptic markers such as cystein string protein (CSP) suggest that axonal transport could underlie the neurodegeneration observed in the mutant. Reduced ena levels correlated with increased apoptosis, which could be rescued in the presence of p35, a general Caspase inhibitor. Thus, this mutant recapitulates two important features of human neurodegenerative diseases, i.e., vulnerability of certain neuronal populations and progressive degeneration, offering a unique scenario in which to unravel the specific mechanisms in an easily tractable organism."
https://openalex.org/W1995153035,"Phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) is a liver-specific enzyme that converts phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine (PC). Mice that lack PEMT have reduced plasma levels of PC and cholesterol in high density lipoproteins (HDL). We have investigated the mechanism responsible for this reduction with experiments designed to distinguish between a decreased formation of HDL particles by hepatocytes or an increased hepatic uptake of HDL lipids. Therefore, we analyzed lipid efflux to apoA-I and HDL lipid uptake using primary cultured hepatocytes isolated from Pemt+/+ and Pemt–/– mice. Hepatic levels of the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 are not significantly different between Pemt genotypes. Moreover, hepatocytes isolated from Pemt–/– mice released cholesterol and PC into the medium as efficiently as did hepatocytes from Pemt+/+ mice. Immunoblotting of liver homogenates showed a 1.5-fold increase in the amount of the scavenger receptor, class B, type 1 (SR-BI) in Pemt–/– compared with Pemt+/+ livers. In addition, there was a 1.5-fold increase in the SR-BI-interacting protein PDZK1. Lipid uptake experiments using radiolabeled HDL particles revealed a greater uptake of [3H]cholesteryl ethers and [3H]PC by hepatocytes derived from Pemt–/– compared with Pemt+/+ mice. Furthermore, we observed an increased association of [3H]cholesteryl ethers in livers of Pemt–/– compared with Pemt+/+ mice after tail vein injection of [3H]HDL.

PC is also the predominant phospholipid found in plasma lipoproteins, bile and lung surfactant (1Vance J.E. Adeli K. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins and Membranes. 5th Ed. Elsevier, Amsterdam2008: 507-539Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). All mammalian cells can synthesize PC from choline via the Kennedy (CDP-choline) pathway (2Kennedy E.P. Weiss S.B. J. Biol.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1979; 4: 145-148Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In the liver, an alternative pathway contributes to the biosynthesis of PC. This pathway involves three successive methylations of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) catalyzed by PE N-methyltransferase (PEMT) and represents one-third of hepatic PC production (4Bremer J.

Hepatology. 1999; 30: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In 1997, a mouse lacking PEMT was generated to gain further insight into the function of this enzyme. When fed a chow diet, Pemt–/– mice appear normal, and the production of PC from the Kennedy pathway is increased by ∼50! to compensate for the absence of the PEMT activity (11Walkey C.J. Donohue L.R. Bronson R. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12880-12885Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Indeed, hepatic levels of PC do not change significantly between the Pemt+/+ and Pemt–/– mice. However, when Pemt–/– mice are fed a choline-deficient diet to attenuate the CDP-choline pathway, severe liver damage occurred within 3 days (12Walkey C.J. Yu L. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27043-27046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The liver failure can be reversed if choline is fed to the mice prior to the third day of the choline-deficient diet (13Waite K.A. Cabilio N.R. Vance D.E. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 68-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Interestingly, neither dietary dimethylethanolamine (14Waite K.A. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1636: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) nor propanolamine (15Li Z. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1771: 486-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) can substitute for dietary choline when fed to Pemt–/– mice, indicating a striking specificity for PC in liver function. It is believed that the PEMT pathway survived throughout evolution to provide PC in situations where choline intake is insufficient, such as pregnancy/lactation or starvation (12Walkey C.J. Yu L.

PEMT deficiency in male mice challenged with a high fat/high cholesterol diet resulted in a 50! decrease in apoB100, PC and triacylglycerol (TG) secretion from the liver (9Noga A.A. Vance D.E. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1998-2005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These observations are in agreement with earlier work in which levels of secreted apoB100 and lipids (PC and TG) by hepatocytes from Pemt–/– mice were 50–70! lower than from Pemt+/+ mice (16Noga A.A. Zhao Y. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42358-42365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This defect in very low density lipoprotein secretion in the absence of PEMT activity was only evident in males fed an HF/HC diet, showing a gender- and diet-specific alteration of lipoprotein metabolism in Pemt–/– mice (16Noga A.A. Zhao Y. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42358-42365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Several adaptive mechanisms might be involved in regulating PC homeostasis in Pemt–/– mice, such as redistribution of cellular PC pools (17Li Z. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10283-10289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), reduction in PC degradation, and/or regulation of lipid flux in and out of hepatocytes to maintain PC levels constant and ensure optimal liver functions. In this respect, a significant reduction of cholesterol and PC in plasma HDL is observed in both genders of Pemt–/– mice fed an HF/HC diet. Surprisingly, these lower HDL levels were also detected in female Pemt–/– mice fed a chow diet (18Noga A.A. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21851-21859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This decrease in plasma HDL lipids is intriguing, particularly since a role for PEMT in HDL metabolism has not been previously addressed. In the last decade, many studies have focused on HDL formation, maturation, and delivery of its associated lipids to the liver. This reverse cholesterol transport (19Glomset J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 155-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Fielding P.E. Fielding C.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14288-14292Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 21Fielding C.J. Havel R.J. Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 1977; 101: 225-229PubMed Google Scholar) is believed to be atheroprotective, since HDL mediates the transport of excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues back to the liver for conversion into bile acids and/or for excretion into bile (22Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M.H. Rigotti A. Iqbal S.N. Edelman E.R. Krieger M. Nature. 1997; 387: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 23Glass C. Pittman R.C. Weinstein D.B. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The generation of HDL particles from poorly lipidated apoA-I involves the efflux of cellular lipids and relies on the activity of ABCA1 (ATP-binding cassette transporter A1). In addition, partially lipidated “nascent” HDL can acquire unesterified cholesterol in an ABCA1-independent manner via other ABC transporters, such as ABCG1 or ABCG4, or via a passive diffusion process (25Oram J.F. Heinecke J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 1343-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 26Yokoyama S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Elsevier, Amsterdam2008: 533-553Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Because hepatocytes secrete apoA-I, express ABCA1 on their cell surface, and can generate HDL by both ABCA1-dependent and -independent pathways (28Kiss R.S. McManus D.C. Franklin V. Tan W.L. McKenzie A. Chimini G. Marcel Y.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10119-10127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 29Sahoo D. Trischuk T.C. Chan T. Drover V.A. Ho S.

Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1122-1131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that ABCA1-mediated efflux of PC and cholesterol from PEMT-deficient hepatocytes might be decreased as a mechanism for maintaining PC homeostasis in the liver. It is also now well established that lipids associated with HDL can be delivered to steroidogenic tissues (adrenals, ovary, or testes) and to the liver via the scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI) (30Schneider W.J. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids, Lipoproteins, and Membranes. 5th Ed. Elsevier, Amsterdam2008: 555-578Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). This HDL receptor is mainly expressed on the cell surface of hepatocytes and steroidogenic cells and is involved in the selective uptake of lipids from plasma lipoproteins, without concomitant degradation of the whole lipoprotein particle (31Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar). Thus, cholesteryl esters and other lipids are segregated from apoA-I, which is recycled back to the plasma compartment, whereas lipids are thought to be targeted to the canalicular membrane for biliary secretion. Although SR-BI has also been described as a promoter of cholesterol efflux (32Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. Moya M.L. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20982-20985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), the absence of a cholesterol efflux defect from SR-BI-deficient mouse macrophages to HDL suggests SR-BI has antiatherosclerotic effects for reasons other than cholesterol efflux (33Zhang W. Yancey P.G. Su Y.R. Babaev V.R. Zhang Y. Fazio S. Linton M.F. Circulation. 2003; 108: 2258-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Currently, SR-BI is believed to play a crucial role in the final step of reverse cholesterol transport (i.e. the selective uptake and sorting of plasma HDL lipids) (32Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y.

J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29993-30001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Thus, another explanation for the reduced levels of plasma HDL in Pemt–/– mice might be a compensatory up-regulation of selective lipid uptake from HDL by hepatocytes in an attempt to maintain PC levels. Thus, using Pemt–/– mice as a model, we have studied the hepatic contribution of PC and cholesterol to HDL formation and subsequent lipid uptake by the liver under conditions for which PC biosynthesis was challenged. The results show that in livers and hepatocytes from Pemt–/– mice, compared with Pemt+/+ mice, the expression of SR-BI is increased by 50!, and the uptake of cholesterol is enhanced. Materials—HDL (d = 1.07–1.21 g/ml) were obtained by ultracentrifugation of pooled plasma of healthy male and female volunteers (36Chung B.H. Wilkinson T. Geer J.C. Segrest J.P. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 284-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein fraction of HDL was obtained by delipidation of HDL, and purified apoA-I was obtained by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose (37Yokoyama S. Tajima S. Yamamoto A. J. Biochem.

All other chemicals and reagents were from standard commercial sources. Reagents for quantitative PCR analysis of mRNA levels were purchased from Invitrogen. The molecular weight markers for the blue native PAGE were from Amersham Biosciences. Care and Feeding of Mice—Pemt+/+ and Pemt–/– mice had a mixed genetic background of 129/J and C57BL/6 (11Walkey C.J. Donohue L.R. Bronson R. Agellon L.B. Vance D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12880-12885Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and were maintained via homozygous breeding in a reversed 12-h light/dark cycle. All mice were females 10–14 weeks old. Similar experiments were performed using male mice with comparable outcomes. Since the difference in HDL between the genotypes was greater with females than males (18Noga A.A. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21851-21859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), the studies concentrated on female mice. Hepatocyte Isolation and Culture—Primary hepatocytes were isolated from Pemt+/+ and Pemt–/– mice after liver perfusion with collagenase (16Noga A.A. Zhao Y. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42358-42365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Cells (2 × 106 cells/collagen-coated 60-mm dish) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 15! fetal bovine serum. Lipid Mobilization Assays—Hepatocytes from Pemt+/+ and Pemt–/– mice were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C in the presence of 5 μCi of [3H]glycerol, 1 mm glycerol with or without 20 μg/ml apoA-I. The media were collected, cells were scraped into phosphate-buffered saline, and lipids were extracted with CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1) and then washed with (CH3OH/H2O/CHCl3/CH3COOH (480:470:30:9.6, v/v/v/v) (38Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 226: 495-509Google Scholar). The solvents were evaporated under nitrogen, and lipids were dissolved in CHCl3. Phospholipids were separated by thin layer chromatography using a developing solvent of CHCl3/CH3OH/CH3COOH/H2O (25:15:4:2, v/v/v/v) until the solvent reached halfway up the plate. The solvent was evaporated from the plates, and the neutral lipids were separated using heptane/diisopropyl ether/acetic acid (60:40:4, v/v/v), which developed to the top of the plate. Phospholipids were visualized with iodine vapor, and the band corresponding to [3H]PC was scraped into scintillation vials for measurement of radioactivity. The efflux of PC to apoA-I was expressed as the percentage of total [3H]PC (in cells and media) recovered in the culture media. Neutral lipids were visualized after reaction with sulfuric acid. Cholesterol mass was measured by gas-liquid chromatography using 5α-cholestane as a standard. Radiolabeling of Phosphatidylcholine—Two dishes of McArdle 7777 rat hepatoma cells (2.5 × 106 cells/60-mm dish) were incubated for 12 h at 37 °C with 50 μCi of [3H]choline. Cells were scraped into phosphate-buffered saline, and lipids were extracted in CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1). Phospholipids were separated by thin layer chromatography in the solvent system CHCl3/CH3OH/CH3COOH/H2O (25:15:4:2, v/v/v/v) and stained with iodine vapor. [3H]PC was scraped from the plate, and CHCl3/CH3OH was added. After centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min, the supernatant containing [3H]PC was collected. Analysis of Plasma Lipoprotein Lipid Profiles—Lipoproteins in 12 μl of plasma were separated isocratically on a 30 × 1-cm Superose 6 gel filtration fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences). Eluted fractions were mixed with Infinity cholesterol reagent (ThermoDMA), and cholesterol content was measured at 37 °C by spectrophotometric detection at 500 nm. Choline-containing phospholipids were measured postcolumn using the Phospholipids B kit from Wako Diagnostics. Isolation and Radiolabeling of HDL—Radiolabeled cholesteryl oleoyl ether (50 μCi) and PC (50 μCi) were sonicated in a 37 °C water bath in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. The donor liposomes were incubated with 25 mg of HDL and cholesteryl ester transfer protein; fresh lipoprotein-deficient human plasma (d > 1.21 g/ml) was heated at 60 °C to inactivate lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase and was used as a source of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (39Rodrigueza W.V. Thuahnai S.T. Temel R.E. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20344-20350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The lipoprotein preparation was mixed at 37 °C for 48 h on an orbital shaker at 200 rpm, and HDLs were reisolated by sequential centrifugations (36Chung B.H. Wilkinson T. Geer J.C. Segrest J.P. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 284-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The [3H]HDL was allowed to percolate through a heparin-Sepharose column to remove apoE/apoB-containing lipoproteins. After extensive dialysis, the protein concentration was determined (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar). [3H]HDL was kept at 4 °C under nitrogen. Lipid Uptake by Hepatocytes—Hepatocytes from Pemt+/+ and Pemt–/– mice were incubated 1 h at 37°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 75 μg of protein/ml of [3H]HDL. The radioactive media were removed, and then cells were washed and incubated with 50 μg of protein/ml of unlabeled HDL to eliminate nonspecific binding of HDL to cellular membranes. Cells were scraped, and the lipids were extracted and separated by thin layer chromatography as described above. Radioactivity associated with cell extracts (as [3H]PC and [3H]cholesteryl ether) was measured with a liquid scintillation counter. In Vivo Lipid Uptake Assays—Pemt+/+ and Pemt–/– mice were fasted overnight, after which they were injected via the tail vein with 200 μl of [3H]HDL (∼500 μg of [3H]HDL protein containing 2000 dpm/μg of [3H]cholesteryl ether and 750 dpm/μg of [3H]PC). 1 h after the injection, the mice were sacrificed, the livers were removed and homogenized, lipids were extracted, and the associated radioactivity was measured. Immunoblot Analyses—Equal amounts of proteins (from cellular extracts and from liver homogenates) were separated by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels (containing 0.1! SDS) (6! gel for ABCA1 analysis, 12.5! gel for SR-BI, and 10! for PDZK1), and the resolved proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. ABCA1 (1:250 dilution), SR-BI (1:5,000 dilution), and PDZK1 (1:3,000 dilution) were detected using specific primary antibodies. For each immunoblot, protein-disfulfide isomerase (1:2,000 dilution) was used as a loading control. The apoA-I immunoblot (1:10,000 dilution) was performed with fresh plasma, and the membrane was stained with Coomassie Blue to confirm equal loading into each lane of the gel. Densitometric analysis of the blots was performed using Quantity One software. 35S Metabolic Labeling of SR-BI in Primary Hepatocytes—Freshly isolated hepatocytes were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) and then in methionine-free medium. 100 μCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine cell labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to each dish. The pulse period allowed radiolabeling of newly synthesized proteins for 2 h before the 35S-containing medium was removed. Chase periods ranged from 0 to 12 h. Following the pulse-chase experiment, cells were washed with PBS and lysed in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (0.63 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.75 m NaCl, 25 mm EDTA, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5! Triton) containing protease inhibitors. Protein concentration was determined, and equal aliquots of 100 μg of cellular protein were prepared for immunoprecipitation of SR-BI. Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the anti-SR-BI antibody (NB400-101) to immunoprecipitate SR-BI (1:100). Protein-Sepharose A was added to the samples, and SR-BI was pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 3 min and washing thoroughly in between (with buffer containing 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1! Triton, and 0.1! SDS). Reducing sample buffer (6 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10! glycerol, 2! SDS, and 8 m urea) was added directly to the samples. After boiling for 20 min, samples were loaded onto a 12! polyacrylamide gel. Immunoprecipitated proteins were visualized by immunoblotting with the goat polyclonal anti-SR-BI antibody (NB 400-131). The electrochemiluminescent signal (from the immunoblot analysis) was allowed to dissipate for 2 days before the membranes were exposed at –80 °C during 6–8 weeks for the 35S signal (autoradiograph). Preparation of mRNA Extracts for Quantitative PCR—Livers from Pemt+/+ and Pemt–/– female mice (∼100 μg) were homogenized in TRIzol solution, and RNA was precipitated with isopropyl alcohol according to the manufacturer. The isopropyl alcohol was removed, and 75! ethanol (in water containing diethylpyrocarbonate) was added. RNA concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance, and samples were then kept at –80 °C in diethylpyrocarbonate-water. cDNA preparations were synthesized with Superscript III polymerase (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR Analysis of Hepatic SR-BI mRNA Levels—SR-BI cDNA was amplified using murine SR-BI-specific primers (forward, 5′-TGG CAT TCA GAG CAG TGT AAC-3′; reverse, 5′-CCG TTG GCA AAC AGA GTA TC-3′), the Platinium quantitative PCR Supermix-UDG (Invitrogen), and SyBR Green (Invitrogen). Cyclophilin cDNA was also amplified as the housekeeper gene using specific primers (forward, 5′-TCC AAA GAC AGC AGA AAA CTT TCG-3′; reverse, 5′-TCT TCT TGC TGG TCT TGC CAT TCC-3′). The data were analyzed with the Pfaffl mathematical method. Blue Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis of Hepatic SR-BI—Livers from fasted Pemt+/+ and Pemt–/– mice (n > 6 mice of each genotype) were collected, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were homogenized in a lysis buffer containing freshly added protease inhibitors (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1! dodecyl maltoside) and then briefly sonicated. Liver homogenates were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with 1:1 solubilization buffer (40 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7, 2 mm magnesium acetate, and 2! digitonin). After a 20-min centrifugation (20,000 × g at 4 °C), detergent-insoluble material was removed, and 50 μg of samples were combined to blue native PAGE sample buffer 5× (50 mm bis-Tris-HCl, pH 7, 50! glycerol, 25 mg/ml Coomassie Blue G250, and 375 mm 6-amino-n-hexanoic acid). The electrophoresis was performed in nonreducing conditions (SDS-free buffers and equipment) on a 4–20! gradient polyacrylamide gel, and the immunoblot analysis of SR-BI oligomeric forms was performed as described above. For all statistical analyses, Pemt+/+ mice were compared with Pemt–/– animals from the same gender using Student's t test. Plasma HDL Lipids Are Decreased by PEMT Deficiency—A significant reduction of plasma lipid levels was previously observed in chow-fed Pemt–/– mice compared with Pemt+/+ mice (18Noga A.A. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21851-21859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism responsible for this decrease, we first analyzed the lipoprotein profiles of plasma from mice of the two genotypes by fast protein liquid chromatography. The mice had been fasted overnight prior to the analysis. Both cholesterol (Fig. 1A) and choline-containing phospholipids (Fig. 1B) were lower in plasma of mice lacking PEMT compared with mice with PEMT. ABCA1-mediated Lipid Efflux Is Not Decreased by the Absence of PEMT—We next evaluated the role of PEMT-derived PC in HDL formation. Primary cultured hepatocytes, obtained from Pemt+/+ and Pemt–/– mice, were incubated in the presence or absence of poorly lipidated apoA-I (20 μg protein/ml), an extracellular acceptor. The efflux of cholesterol and PC from Pemt+/+ and Pemt–/– hepatocytes was linear with time for up to 24 h and with the amount of apoA-I (up to 200 μg/ml) (data not shown). The release of cholesterol from Pemt+/+ and Pemt–/– hepatocytes into the medium was determined after a 16-h incubation with or without apoA-I. The amount of cholesterol in the culture medium was analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography (Fig. 2A). The difference in the amount of cholesterol recovered in the medium of Pemt+/+ and of Pemt–/– hepatocytes did not reach statistical significance. The efflux of PC from Pemt+/+ and Pemt–/– hepatocytes was assessed after radiolabeling of cellular phospholipids with [3H]glycerol (Fig. 2B). The release of [3H]PC from Pemt–/– hepatocytes was independent of Pemt genotype and was surprisingly not stimulated by apoA-I. The Amount of Hepatic ABCA1 Is No"
https://openalex.org/W2148082854,"The Down syndrome candidate region 1 gene (DSCR1) can be expressed as four isoforms, one of which is the well-studied isoform 4 (DSCR1-4) that is induced by VEGF-A165 to provide a negative feedback loop in the VEGF-A165-induced angiogenesis. We reported previously that another DSCR1 isoform, DSCR1-1L, was also up-regulated by VEGF-A165 in cultured endothelial cells and in several in vivo models of pathological angiogenesis and that different from DSCR1-4, DSCR1-1L overexpression alone induced cultured endothelial cell proliferation and promoted angiogenesis in Matrigel assays. It was reported recently that tumor growth was greatly repressed in DSCR1 knock-out mice. Although DSCR1-4 transcription was primarily regulated by NFAT, the mechanism regulating DSCR1-1L expression was still unknown. We developed human DSCR1-1L promoter-driven luciferase system and found that deletion of a putative conserved M-CAT site located 1426-bp upstream of the translation start site blunted promoter activity. We further showed that knockdown of TEF3, not other members of TEF family inhibited VEGF-A165-induced DSCR1-1L expression. We also demonstrated that TEF3 directly interacted with the putative M-CAT site in the DSCR1-1L promoter in vitro and in vivo. Finally, overexpression of TEF3 isoform 1, not isoform 3, in HUVEC was sufficient to induce DSCR1-1L expression even in the absence of VEGF-A165 stimulation. Taken together, we elucidated a novel function of transcriptional factor TEF3. TEF3 was required for DSCR1-1L expression through binding to the M-CAT site in its promoter and could be an attractive target for anti-angiogenesis therapy.

Heitman J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3618-3629Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Down syndrome is a major cause of mental retardation and is also associated with various cardiac and gastrointestinal anomalies, immune system defects, and Alzeimer disease. Down syndrome patients have increased risks of certain malignancies (leukemia, germ cell tumors) but an extremely low incidence of many solid tumors, particularly breast cancer (9Hasle H. Lancet Oncol. 2001; 2: 429-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 10Smucker J.D. Roth L.M. Sutton G.P. Hurteau J.A. Gynecol. Oncol. 1999; 74: 512-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). On the other hand, clinically aggressive ovarian carcinomas often have trisomy of chromosome 21, whereas certain other solid tumors have deletions of this chromosome. Together these and other data suggest that genes such as DSCR1 that are triplicated in Down syndrome may play important roles in tumorigenesis (11Faruqi S.A. Noumoff M.J. Deger R.B. Jalal S.M. Antoniades K. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 2002; 138: 165-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 12Verhest, A., Nedoszytko, B., Noel, J., Simon, P., and Limon, J. (1991) Fourth International Workshop on Chromosomes in solid Tumors, Abstract B24Google Scholar). Interest in DSCR1 has recently been sparked by several reports indicating that it is up-regulated in cultured vascular endothelial cells by VEGF-A165 and further that it provides a negative feedback loop that inhibits VEGF-A165-induced angiogenesis (13Liu D.

Blood. 2004; 104: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, the conclusion was based on the studies of only one DSCR1 isoform, isoform 4 (DSCR1-4). The DSCR1 gene is comprised of seven exons, the first four of which can serve as start sites that then combine with exons 5–7 to produce four different mRNA transcripts (2Fuentes J.J. Pritchard M.A. Estivill X. Genomics. 1997; 44: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 17Ermak G. Harris C.D. Davies K.J. Faseb. J. 2002; 16: 814-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Exon 1 was originally thought to encode a 29-amino acid peptide (DSCR1-1) (2Fuentes J.J. Pritchard M.A. Estivill X. Genomics. 1997; 44: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 17Ermak G. Harris C.D. Davies K.J. Faseb. J. 2002; 16: 814-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), but later studies by Genesca et al. (18Genesca L. Aubareda A. Fuentes J.J. Estivill X. De La Luna S. Perez-Riba M. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) revealed a start site further upstream that encoded an 84-amino acid peptide (DSCR1-1L). Exon 2 is probably not translated into protein, because it lacks a methionine start site. Exon 3 encodes only 3 amino acids (2Fuentes J.J. Pritchard M.A. Estivill X. Genomics. 1997; 44: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 17Ermak G. Harris C.D. Davies K.J. Faseb. J. 2002; 16: 814-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Exon 4, under the control of a different promoter from that regulating isoforms 1–3 (2Fuentes J.J. Pritchard M.A. Estivill X. Genomics. 1997; 44: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 17Ermak G. Harris C.D. Davies K.J. Faseb. J. 2002; 16: 814-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), encodes a 29-amino acid peptide that initiates a fourth DSCR1 isoform. The several DSCR1 isoforms have different expression patterns and likely different functions and regulatory mechanisms (2Fuentes J.J. Pritchard M.A. Estivill X. Genomics. 1997; 44: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 17Ermak G. Harris C.D. Davies K.J. Faseb. J. 2002; 16: 814-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). All four isoforms are expressed in heart and skeletal muscle (2Fuentes J.J. Pritchard M.A. Estivill X. Genomics. 1997; 44: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 17Ermak G. Harris C.D. Davies K.J. Faseb. J. 2002; 16: 814-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Isoform 1 has also been detected in brain and isoform 4 in placenta and kidney (2Fuentes J.J.

Nature. 1999; 400: 576-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that DSCR1-1L, like DSCR1-4, was up-regulated by VEGF-A165 in cultured endothelial cells and also in several types of pathological angiogenesis in vivo (22Qin L. Zhao D. Liu X. Nagy J.A. Hoang M.V. Brown L.F. Dvorak H.F. Zeng H. Mol. Cancer Res. 2006; 4: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). DSCR1-1L was also expressed in the microvasculature of human ovarian cancers, but not in the tumor cells themselves nor in the microvessels of normal ovary (22Qin L. Zhao D. Liu X. Nagy J.A. Hoang M.V. Brown L.F. Dvorak H.F. Zeng H. Mol. Cancer Res. 2006; 4: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Of particular interest, the effects of DSCR1-1L in angiogenesis were antithetical to those of DSCR1-4 (22Qin L. Zhao D. Liu X. Nagy J.A. Hoang M.V. Brown L.F. Dvorak H.F. Zeng H. Mol. Cancer Res. 2006; 4: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Using a novel modification of the standard Matrigel assay, we found that overexpression of DSCR1-1L promoted endothelial cell proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo, whereas a DSCR1-1L-specific siRNA had opposite effects. Our data indicated that DSCR1-1 and -4 have opposing stimulatory and inhibitory effects on VEGF-A165-induced angiogenesis (22Qin L. Zhao D. Liu X. Nagy J.A. Hoang M.V. Brown L.F. Dvorak H.F. Zeng H. Mol. Cancer Res. 2006; 4: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Most recently, it was reported that tumor growth was greatly repressed in DSCR1 knock-out mice lacking all DSCR1 isoforms (23Ryeom S. Baek K.H. Rioth M.J. Lynch R.C. Zaslavsky A. Birsner A. Yoon S.S. McKeon F. Cancer Cell. 2008; 13: 420-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Therefore, DSCR1-1L and the signaling pathway that regulates DSCR1-1L expression are excellent targets for cancer anti-angiogenic therapy. It was shown that VEGF-A165-induced DSCR1-4 expression was mediated by the NFAT response element in the DSCR1-4 promoter that was located in its intron 3 (24Fuentes J.J. Genesca L. Kingsbury T.J. Cunningham K.W. Perez-Riba M. Estivill X. de la Luna S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the regulatory element(s) that regulates DSCR1-1L has not been studied yet. To study the molecular mechanism that regulates DSCR1-1L expression in angiogenesis, we constructed a 1.4-kb human DSCR1-1L promoter-driven luciferase plasmid to study the molecular mechanism of DSCR1-1L expression. Materials—Antibodies against TEF1 and TEF4 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit antibody against human DSCR1-1L (hDSCR1) was purchased from Abcam, Inc.

Walkersville, MD) were cultured and transduced with retroviruses carrying various constructs as previously described (26Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). EOMA cells and 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Immunohistochemistry—These experiments were carried out according to a protocol approved by the hospital's Committee on Clinical Investigation. Tumors were obtained at the time of surgery and were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in OCT compound, and prepared for immunohistochemistry. Frozen sections were then blocked with 5% goat serum, stained with mouse anti-hDSCR1-1L (Center for Biomedical Inventions, University of Texas Southwestern Medical School), washed three times with PBS, incubated for 1 h with biotinylated polyclonal anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:200 dilution, Vector Laboratories, Inc. Burlingame, CA), washed three times with PBS, reacted with the ABC peroxidase kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc. Burlingame, CA) at room temperature for 45 min, and washed with PBS prior to mounting for light microscopy and photography. Construction of DSCR1-1L Promoter Reporter Plasmid and Its Mutants—To construct the DSCR1-1L promoter-luc plasmid, the human 1.4-kilobase promoter was cloned from a HUVEC genomic DNA by PCR with a primer set: forward primer with KpnI (5′-aaaaaaggtaccagaggggtgactttgaatggaatg) and reverse primer with HindIII (5′-aaaaaaaagcttcgttaaccccctcggaatc). The PCR products were digested with KpnI and HindIII and subcloned into the pGL3-basic vector (Promega, San Luis Obispo, CA) The identity of the promoter was confirmed by DNA sequencing, and this plasmid was named pD1L(-1450) (all numbering relative to the translation start site because there is no TATA box in the DSCR1-1L promoter). The primers used to create deletion mutants were listed below, all of which with KpnI and HindIII restriction sites in the 5′- and 3′-end, respectively. pD1L(-1344): 5′-aaaaaaggtaccacggttccaatttcttcacatcc (forward) and 5′-aaaaaaaagcttgccagccccgcccgtcac (reverse). pD1L(-1287): 5′-aaaaaaggtaccgatgggtattattattcctcttg (forward) and 5′-aaaaaaaagcttgccagccccgcccgtcac (reverse). pD1L(-1199): 5′-aaaaaaggtacccatggcaagttctgaataaatctc (forward) and 5′-aaaaaaaagcttgccacgccgtcctccatcc (reverse). pD1L(-1089): 5′-aaaaaaggtacctcacaacctccaaagaacc (forward) and 5′-aaaaaaaagcttgccacgccgtcctccatcc (reverse). The forward primers for the following deletion mutants were pD1L(-1426): 5′-aaaaaggtaccggaggctggttggctctaag; pD1L(-1421): 5′-aaaaaaggtaccctggttggctctaagcaa; pD1L(-1396): 5′-aaaaaaggtaccttagttttccttagtgattt; pD1L(-1374): 5′-aaaaaaggtacctgggggcccaagatttcc; pD1L(-1364): 5′-aaaaaaggtaccagatttccctttcacagt; pD1L(-1353): 5′-aaaaaaggtaccacagtatgacggttccaa; pD1L-ΔMCAT: 5′-aaaaaaggtaccagaggggtgacttggaggctggttggctctaagcaa. The reverse primer was 5′-aaaaaaaagcttcgttaaccccctcggaatc. The 3× M-CAT sequence was 3TEC1 (Kpn1/BglII)F, 5′-aaaaaaggtaccttgaatggaatggttgaatggaatggttgaatggaatggagatctggaaag (underline indicated the triple of M-CAT sequence), and 3TEC-1(Kpn1/BglII)R, 5′-ctttcgagatctccattccattcaaccattccattcaaccattccattcaaggtacctttttt. The mutated sequence was 3*2Mu-tec-1 (SacI/SmaI)F, 5′-ACACACGAGCTCTTGTACCGTACCTTGTACCGTACCTTGTACCGTACCCCCGGGATAAAC-3′ and 3*2Mu-tec-1 (SacI/SmaI)R, 5′-GTTTATCCCGGGGGTACGGTACAAGGTACGGTACAAGGTACGGTACAAGAGCTCGTGTGT. Promoter Activity Assay—EOMA cells were seeded in 24-well plates at the density of 1–2 × 105 cells/well. Twenty hours later, cells were transfected with D1L promoter-luciferase plasmids and control luciferase plasmid (pRL-tk, Promega, Madison, WI) with Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Two microliters of Lipofectamine 2000 were added directly to 50 ;l of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) without serum and antibiotics and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. D1L promoter plasmid (0.4 ;g) and pRL-tk (0.08 ;g) were added to another 50 ;l DMEM without serum and antibiotic. Lipofectamine 2000 dilution and plasmid were mixed and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Then the mixture was added to EOMA cells and incubated in the absence of serum for 2 days. Cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with 100 ;l of 1× passive lysis buffer of Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) at room temperature until cells were dissolved. HUVEC (1 × 105 per well) were plated in 12-well plates. Twenty-four hours later, cells were transfected with pGL3-D1L plasmids and control luciferase plasmid (pRL-tk) using FuGENE-6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics). Cells were washed twice with PBS. Two microliters of FuGENE was added directly to 50 ;l of OPTI-MEM1 medium and incubated for 5 min. pD1L (0.5 ;g) and pRL-tk (0.2 ;g) were added to the mixture and incubated for 15 min, and then added to cells with 300 ;l of medium. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were stimulated with VEGF-A165 for 6 h, then washed with PBS, and lysed with 100 ;l of 1× passive lysis buffer until cells were dissolved. Luciferase activity was assayed and normalized to equal internal control luciferase activity according to the manufacturer's protocol. Preparation of Cell Extracts—Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared with the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (Pierce). Cell membranes were lysed in 200 ;l of ice-cold Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagent I (CERI, 1× protease inhibitor mixture; Roche) for 10 min on ice. Then, ice-cold Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagent II (CERII) (5.5 ;l) was added. Cells were incubated for 1 min and centrifuged (16000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min). The supernatants were collected as cytoplasmic fractions. The insoluble pellet that contains nuclei was washed two times with PBS to remove the remaining cytoplasmic proteins. The washed pellet was resuspended in 100 ;l of ice-cold Nuclear Extraction Reagent (NER, 1× protease inhibitor mixture; Roche), incubated for 40 min on ice, and centrifuged (16000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min). The supernatant was used as nuclear extract. Extracts obtained by this procedure generally had less than 10% contamination between nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. The protein concentration was determined with a commercial protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—The probe with three copies of M-CAT sites and mutant probe were labeled with biotin 3′-end DNA labeling kit as described in the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce). EMSA was performed using a LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer's protocols with some modifications. Briefly, nuclear extracts (5 ;g) and 20 fmol of biotin-labeled putative 3×M-CAT were incubated in a reaction mixture (10 mm Tris, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol; pH 7.5, 50 ng/;l poly(dI·dC), 2.5% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.05 mm dithiothreitol) at room temperature for 20 min. The mixtures were then separated by electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C in 0.5× TBE at 100 V for 1–1.5 h. The samples were subsequently transferred to positively charged nylon membranes (Pierce) in 0.5× TBE at 380 mA for 1 h at 4 °C and exposed to UV light (120 mJ·cm-2, 1 min) to cross-link the DNA to the membrane. Detection of biotin-labeled DNA probe was performed in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. For experiments with wild-type and mutant competitors, 0.2 pmol (10× excess) or 1 pmol (50× excess) unlabeled wild-type or mutant probe oligonucleotides were included in the nuclear protein-DNA reaction mixtures. In the experiment with antibody supershifting, antibodies against TEF1, TEF3, TEF4, and TEF5 (1 ;g) were included in the reaction mixture. RT-PCR Analysis—RNA was isolated from HUVEC. RT-PCR with specific primers for TEF1, TEF3, TEF4, and TEF5 was carried out as described (17Ermak G. Harris C.D. Davies K.J. Faseb. J. 2002; 16: 814-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). GAPDH served as a control for equal RNA loading. RT-PCR products were analyzed on 4% agarose gels. The primers used are listed below. TEF1-rt-F1120, 5′-TTGGTGGTAACAAACAGGGAT and TEF1-rt-R1209, 5′-ATGTTGTGCTCCGTGTTCA; TEF3-rt-F976, 5′-ATGATCATCACCTGCTCCAC and TEF3-rt-R1066, 5′-GTCCATTCTCATAGCGAGCA; TEF4-rt-F1135, 5′-ATGTGCGAGTACCTGGTGAA and TEF4-rt-R1231, 5′-CCTGGAGGATGGTGAAGTTT; TEF5-rt-F973, 5′-GATAGCATGACCATCAGCGT and TEF5-rt-R1065, 5′-GTTCTCCAGCCTGGCATACT. GAPDH F, 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA and GAPDH R, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC. Cloning and Expression of TEF3 Isoforms and siRNAs—TEF3 isoforms were cloned by RT-PCR using RNA isolated from HUVEC with primers in 5′-UTR (5′-GCGGACTCCTTGGAACTGGCTTAG) and 3′-UTR (5′-CATCTTGGGTTTATTTGGGGTTGG) of TEF3, respectively. The RT-PCR products were cloned to pTOPO vector (Invitrogen) and then subjected to DNA sequence analysis. TEF3-1 and TEF3-3 were subcloned to pMMP-FLAG vector with primers XholI-TEF3-1-F (5′-AACTCGAGTTGG AGGGCACGGCCGGCAC), XholI-TEF3-3-F (5′-AACTCGAGATGGCTGCCATGTCGTCTGC) and BamHI-TEF3-R (5′-AAGGATCCTCATTCTTTCACCAGCCTG, respectively, and overexpressed in HUVEC as described previously (26Zeng H. Dvorak H.F. Mukhopadhyay D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26969-26979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). siRNAs were designed with the software from OligoEngine Co (Seattle, WA), cloned into pSUPER-retro vector (Oligo-Engine), and expressed in HUVEC. The siRNA sequences were siTEF1A, TACCGAATAAACCGCTCCC, siTEF1B, ATACCGAATAAACCGCTCC, siTEF1C, GATTCCACGCCCGACCTTC, siTEF3A, ACTACTCTTACCGCATCCA, siTEF3B, ACTCTTACCGCATCCACCG, siTEF4A, CCGTTCACCTTGTCACTGA, siTEF4B, GTTCACCTTGTCACTGACT, siTEF4C, CACCTTGTCACTGACTCCC siTEF5A, CCGTCTTCTCCACTTCCTC, siTEF5B, CGTCTTCTCCACTTCCTCG and siTEF5C, TCTTCTCCACTTCCTCGCG. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays (CHIP)—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed according to the protocol (CHIP assay, Upstate, Charlottesville, VA). Briefly, HUVEC pellet were sonicated and cross-linked with formaldehyde and then subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with an antibody against TEF1, TEF3, TEF4, TEF5, or IgG as a control overnight at 4 °C. The chromosomal DNA in the immunoprecipitated complexes was extracts with phenol-chloroform. After final ethanol precipitation, IP products were resuspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA) and subjected to PCR assay with the primer set (forward: 5′-AGTACATTGGTTTGGTCTG and reverse: 5′-ACGGTTCTATGATTACTATTAT). The primers were designed according to the sequences of the putative M-CAT binding site on the proximal portion of the DSCR1-1 promoter. The supernatants before immunoprecipitation were served as total input chromatin control. Statistics—The results are expressed based on triplet experiments as the means ± S.E. variance. The Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test was used to determine statistical significance. A p value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Expression of DSCR1-1L in Endothelial Cells—Previously, we reported that DSCR1-1L was expressed in the vascular structure of ovarian cancer tissues, not in tumor cells by immunohistochemical analysis (22Qin L. Zhao D. Liu X. Nagy J.A. Hoang M.V. Brown L.F. Dvorak H.F. Zeng H. Mol. Cancer Res. 2006; 4: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To find out whether the tumor vessel-specific expression of DCSR1-1L also occurs in other tumors, we analyzed the DSCR1-IL expression in human kidney cancer tissues by immunohistochemical staining. As expected, DSCR1-1L was selectively expressed in the tumor vascular endothelium but not in the tumor cells, nor in normal kidney tissues (Fig. 1A). We further confirmed these results by immunoblotting analysis with cellular extracts isolated from human kidney cancer cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, DSCR1-1L was also expressed in proliferating human microdermal vascular endothelial cells (HMDVEC), in addition to HUVEC (22Qin L. Zhao D. Liu X. Nagy J.A. Hoang M.V. Brown L.F. Dvorak H.F. Zeng H. Mol. Cancer Res. 2006; 4: 811-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but not in proliferating human kidney carcinoma 293T cells (Fig. 1B). Because hemangioma EOMA cells, transformed mouse endothelial tumor cells, were shown to secrete high levels of VEGF that cause autocrine and VEGF-dependent growth (27Ilan N. Tucker A. Madri J.A. Lab. Investig. 2003; 83: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we also examined whether DSCR1-1L was expressed in the EOMA cells. Fig. 1B clearly indicated that DSCR1-1L was highly expressed in the hemangioma EOMA cells (Fig. 1B). Our data demonstrated that DSCR1 was highly expressed in endothelial cells, not in kidney cancer cells. Identification of a Putative M-CAT Element in the DSCR1-1L Promoter in Hemangioma Cells—It was reported that DSCR1-1L and DSCR1-4 consisted of exons 1, 5, 6, 7 and exons 4, 5, 6, 7, respectively (Fig. 2A) and expression of DSCR1-4 was regulated by the calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathway (15Yao Y.G.

The promoter regulating DSCR1-4 was found in the intron preceding exon 4 and contains several NFAT binding sites (Fig. 2A) (24Fuentes J.J. Genesca L. Kingsbury T.J. Cunningham K.W. Perez-Riba M. Estivill X. de la Luna S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, unlike DSCR1-4, DSCR1-1L is not likely to be induced through the Cn-NFAT pathway (13Liu D. Jia H. Holmes D.I. Stannard A. Zachary I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 2002-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus"

https://openalex.org/W1968235547,"The volatile anesthetic isoflurane poses a number of experimental challenges in the laboratory. Due to its rapid evaporation, the open conditions of most in vitro electrophysiological recording systems make the determination of actual isoflurane concentrations a challenge. Since the absolute anesthetic concentration in solution is directly related to efficacy, concentration measurements are important to allow comparisons between laboratory and clinical studies. In this study we quantify the sources of isoflurane loss during experimentation and describe a method for the measurement of isoflurane concentrations using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry simultaneous to in vitro electrophysiological measurements. Serial samples of perfused bath solution allowed correlation of isoflurane concentrations with ongoing biological effects. Saturated physiological solutions contained 13.4±0.2 mM isoflurane and were diluted to desired “nominal” concentrations for experiments. The perfusion system established stable isoflurane concentrations within the bath by 2 minutes. However, bath isoflurane concentrations varied substantially and unpredictably between experiments. The magnitudes of such discrepancies in isoflurane concentrations spanned clinically important levels. Our studies suggest that, despite countermeasures, solution handling significantly impacted the isoflurane content in the tissue bath. The magnitude of these discrepancies appears to necessitate systematic direct measurement of bath isoflurane concentrations during most in vitro conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2092669176,"Plants produce semio-chemicals that directly influence insect attraction and/or repulsion. Generally, this attraction is closely associated with herbivory and has been studied mainly under atmospheric conditions. On the other hand, the relationship between aquatic plants and insects has been little studied. To determine whether the roots of aquatic macrophytes release attractive chemical mixtures into the water, we studied the behaviour of mosquito larvae using olfactory experiments with root exudates. After testing the attraction on Culex and Aedes mosquito larvae, we chose to work with Coquillettidia species, which have a complex behaviour in nature and need to be attached to plant roots in order to obtain oxygen. This relationship is non-destructive and can be described as commensal behaviour. Commonly found compounds seemed to be involved in insect attraction since root exudates from different plants were all attractive. Moreover, chemical analysis allowed us to identify a certain number of commonly found, highly water-soluble, low-molecular-weight compounds, several of which (glycerol, uracil, thymine, uridine, thymidine) were able to induce attraction when tested individually but at concentrations substantially higher than those found in nature. However, our principal findings demonstrated that these compounds appeared to act synergistically, since a mixture of these five compounds attracted larvae at natural concentrations (0.7 nM glycerol, <0.5 nM uracil, 0.6 nM thymine, 2.8 nM uridine, 86 nM thymidine), much lower than those found for each compound tested individually. These results provide strong evidence that a mixture of polyols (glycerol), pyrimidines (uracil, thymine), and nucleosides (uridine, thymidine) functions as an efficient attractive signal in nature for Coquillettidia larvae. We therefore show for the first time, that such commonly found compounds may play an important role in plant-insect relationships in aquatic eco-systems."
