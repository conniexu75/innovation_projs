https://openalex.org/W3087176574,"Ferroptosis—an iron-dependent, non-apoptotic cell death process—is involved in various degenerative diseases and represents a targetable susceptibility in certain cancers1. The ferroptosis-susceptible cell state can either pre-exist in cells that arise from certain lineages or be acquired during cell-state transitions2–5. However, precisely how susceptibility to ferroptosis is dynamically regulated remains poorly understood. Here we use genome-wide CRISPR–Cas9 suppressor screens to identify the oxidative organelles peroxisomes as critical contributors to ferroptosis sensitivity in human renal and ovarian carcinoma cells. Using lipidomic profiling we show that peroxisomes contribute to ferroptosis by synthesizing polyunsaturated ether phospholipids (PUFA-ePLs), which act as substrates for lipid peroxidation that, in turn, results in the induction of ferroptosis. Carcinoma cells that are initially sensitive to ferroptosis can switch to a ferroptosis-resistant state in vivo in mice, which is associated with extensive downregulation of PUFA-ePLs. We further find that the pro-ferroptotic role of PUFA-ePLs can be extended beyond neoplastic cells to other cell types, including neurons and cardiomyocytes. Together, our work reveals roles for the peroxisome–ether-phospholipid axis in driving susceptibility to and evasion from ferroptosis, highlights PUFA-ePL as a distinct functional lipid class that is dynamically regulated during cell-state transitions, and suggests multiple regulatory nodes for therapeutic interventions in diseases that involve ferroptosis. The cellular organelles peroxisomes contribute to the sensitivity of cells to ferroptosis by synthesizing polyunsaturated ether phospholipids, and changes in the abundances of these lipids are associated with altered sensitivity to ferroptosis during cell-state transitions."

https://openalex.org/W3086660393,"Cardiomyocytes are subjected to the intense mechanical stress and metabolic demands of the beating heart. It is unclear whether these cells, which are long-lived and rarely renew, manage to preserve homeostasis on their own. While analyzing macrophages lodged within the healthy myocardium, we discovered that they actively took up material, including mitochondria, derived from cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocytes ejected dysfunctional mitochondria and other cargo in dedicated membranous particles reminiscent of neural exophers, through a process driven by the cardiomyocyte's autophagy machinery that was enhanced during cardiac stress. Depletion of cardiac macrophages or deficiency in the phagocytic receptor Mertk resulted in defective elimination of mitochondria from the myocardial tissue, activation of the inflammasome, impaired autophagy, accumulation of anomalous mitochondria in cardiomyocytes, metabolic alterations, and ventricular dysfunction. Thus, we identify an immune-parenchymal pair in the murine heart that enables transfer of unfit material to preserve metabolic stability and organ function. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W3087038497,"Viperin is an interferon-induced cellular protein that is conserved in animals1. It has previously been shown to inhibit the replication of multiple viruses by producing the ribonucleotide 3′-deoxy-3′,4′-didehydro (ddh)-cytidine triphosphate (ddhCTP), which acts as a chain terminator for viral RNA polymerase2. Here we show that eukaryotic viperin originated from a clade of bacterial and archaeal proteins that protect against phage infection. Prokaryotic viperins produce a set of modified ribonucleotides that include ddhCTP, ddh-guanosine triphosphate (ddhGTP) and ddh-uridine triphosphate (ddhUTP). We further show that prokaryotic viperins protect against T7 phage infection by inhibiting viral polymerase-dependent transcription, suggesting that it has an antiviral mechanism of action similar to that of animal viperin. Our results reveal a class of potential natural antiviral compounds produced by bacterial immune systems."
https://openalex.org/W3087469893,"Advanced imaging methods now allow cell-type-specific recording of neural activity across the mammalian brain, potentially enabling the exploration of how brain-wide dynamical patterns give rise to complex behavioural states1–12. Dissociation is an altered behavioural state in which the integrity of experience is disrupted, resulting in reproducible cognitive phenomena including the dissociation of stimulus detection from stimulus-related affective responses. Dissociation can occur as a result of trauma, epilepsy or dissociative drug use13,14, but despite its substantial basic and clinical importance, the underlying neurophysiology of this state is unknown. Here we establish such a dissociation-like state in mice, induced by precisely-dosed administration of ketamine or phencyclidine. Large-scale imaging of neural activity revealed that these dissociative agents elicited a 1–3-Hz rhythm in layer 5 neurons of the retrosplenial cortex. Electrophysiological recording with four simultaneously deployed high-density probes revealed rhythmic coupling of the retrosplenial cortex with anatomically connected components of thalamus circuitry, but uncoupling from most other brain regions was observed—including a notable inverse correlation with frontally projecting thalamic nuclei. In testing for causal significance, we found that rhythmic optogenetic activation of retrosplenial cortex layer 5 neurons recapitulated dissociation-like behavioural effects. Local retrosplenial hyperpolarization-activated cyclic-nucleotide-gated potassium channel 1 (HCN1) pacemakers were required for systemic ketamine to induce this rhythm and to elicit dissociation-like behavioural effects. In a patient with focal epilepsy, simultaneous intracranial stereoencephalography recordings from across the brain revealed a similarly localized rhythm in the homologous deep posteromedial cortex that was temporally correlated with pre-seizure self-reported dissociation, and local brief electrical stimulation of this region elicited dissociative experiences. These results identify the molecular, cellular and physiological properties of a conserved deep posteromedial cortical rhythm that underlies states of dissociation. Dissociative states in mouse and human brains are traced to low-frequency rhythmic neural activity—with distinct molecular, cellular and physiological properties—in the deep retrosplenial cortex and the posteromedial cortex."
https://openalex.org/W3087018179,"The reprogramming of human somatic cells to primed or naive induced pluripotent stem cells recapitulates the stages of early embryonic development1-6. The molecular mechanism that underpins these reprogramming processes remains largely unexplored, which impedes our understanding and limits rational improvements to reprogramming protocols. Here, to address these issues, we reconstruct molecular reprogramming trajectories of human dermal fibroblasts using single-cell transcriptomics. This revealed that reprogramming into primed and naive pluripotency follows diverging and distinct trajectories. Moreover, genome-wide analyses of accessible chromatin showed key changes in the regulatory elements of core pluripotency genes, and orchestrated global changes in chromatin accessibility over time. Integrated analysis of these datasets revealed a role for transcription factors associated with the trophectoderm lineage, and the existence of a subpopulation of cells that enter a trophectoderm-like state during reprogramming. Furthermore, this trophectoderm-like state could be captured, which enabled the derivation of induced trophoblast stem cells. Induced trophoblast stem cells are molecularly and functionally similar to trophoblast stem cells derived from human blastocysts or first-trimester placentas7. Our results provide a high-resolution roadmap for the transcription-factor-mediated reprogramming of human somatic cells, indicate a role for the trophectoderm-lineage-specific regulatory program during this process, and facilitate the direct reprogramming of somatic cells into induced trophoblast stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W3087032289,"Climate and physiology shape biogeography, yet the range limits of species can rarely be ascribed to the quantitative traits of organisms1–3. Here we evaluate whether the geographical range boundaries of species coincide with ecophysiological limits to acquisition of aerobic energy4 for a global cross-section of the biodiversity of marine animals. We observe a tight correlation between the metabolic rate and the efficacy of oxygen supply, and between the temperature sensitivities of these traits, which suggests that marine animals are under strong selection for the tolerance of low O2 (hypoxia)5. The breadth of the resulting physiological tolerances of marine animals predicts a variety of geographical niches—from the tropics to high latitudes and from shallow to deep water—which better align with species distributions than do models based on either temperature or oxygen alone. For all studied species, thermal and hypoxic limits are substantially reduced by the energetic demands of ecological activity, a trait that varies similarly among marine and terrestrial taxa. Active temperature-dependent hypoxia thus links the biogeography of diverse marine species to fundamental energetic requirements that are shared across the animal kingdom. A tight coupling between metabolic rate, efficacy of oxygen supply and the temperature sensitivities of marine animals predicts a variety of geographical niches that better aligns with the distributions of species than models of either temperature or oxygen alone."

https://openalex.org/W3087615343,"Breaks in DNA strands recruit the protein PARP1 and its paralogue PARP2 to modify histones and other substrates through the addition of mono- and poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR)1-5. In the DNA damage responses, this post-translational modification occurs predominantly on serine residues6-8 and requires HPF1, an accessory factor that switches the amino acid specificity of PARP1 and PARP2 from aspartate or glutamate to serine9,10. Poly(ADP) ribosylation (PARylation) is important for subsequent chromatin decompaction and provides an anchor for the recruitment of downstream signalling and repair factors to the sites of DNA breaks2,11. Here, to understand the molecular mechanism by which PARP enzymes recognize DNA breaks within chromatin, we determined the cryo-electron-microscopic structure of human PARP2-HPF1 bound to a nucleosome. This showed that PARP2-HPF1 bridges two nucleosomes, with the broken DNA aligned in a position suitable for ligation, revealing the initial step in the repair of double-strand DNA breaks. The bridging induces structural changes in PARP2 that signal the recognition of a DNA break to the catalytic domain, which licenses HPF1 binding and PARP2 activation. Our data suggest that active PARP2 cycles through different conformational states to exchange NAD+ and substrate, which may enable PARP enzymes to act processively while bound to chromatin. The processes of PARP activation and the PARP catalytic cycle we describe can explain mechanisms of resistance to PARP inhibitors and will aid the development of better inhibitors as cancer treatments12-16."
https://openalex.org/W3087643956,"Malaria has had a major effect on the human genome, with many protective polymorphisms-such as the sickle-cell trait-having been selected to high frequencies in malaria-endemic regions1,2. The blood group variant Dantu provides 74% protection against all forms of severe malaria in homozygous individuals3-5, a similar degree of protection to that afforded by the sickle-cell trait and considerably greater than that offered by the best malaria vaccine. Until now, however, the protective mechanism has been unknown. Here we demonstrate the effect of Dantu on the ability of the merozoite form of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum to invade red blood cells (RBCs). We find that Dantu is associated with extensive changes to the repertoire of proteins found on the RBC surface, but, unexpectedly, inhibition of invasion does not correlate with specific RBC-parasite receptor-ligand interactions. By following invasion using video microscopy, we find a strong link between RBC tension and merozoite invasion, and identify a tension threshold above which invasion rarely occurs, even in non-Dantu RBCs. Dantu RBCs have higher average tension than non-Dantu RBCs, meaning that a greater proportion resist invasion. These findings provide both an explanation for the protective effect of Dantu, and fresh insight into why the efficiency of P. falciparum invasion might vary across the heterogenous populations of RBCs found both within and between individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2980638619,"Persistent neural activity in cortical, hippocampal, and motor networks has been described as mediating working memory for transiently encountered stimuli1,2. Internal emotional states, such as fear, also persist following exposure to an inciting stimulus3, but it is unclear whether slow neural dynamics are involved in this process. Neurons in the dorsomedial and central subdivisions of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHdm/c) that express the nuclear receptor protein NR5A1 (also known as SF1) are necessary for defensive responses to predators in mice4-7. Optogenetic activation of these neurons, referred to here as VMHdmSF1 neurons, elicits defensive behaviours that outlast stimulation5,8, which suggests the induction of a persistent internal state of fear or anxiety. Here we show that in response to naturalistic threatening stimuli, VMHdmSF1 neurons in mice exhibit activity that lasts for many tens of seconds. This persistent activity was correlated with, and required for, persistent defensive behaviour in an open-field assay, and depended on neurotransmitter release from VMHdmSF1 neurons. Stimulation and calcium imaging in acute slices showed that there is local excitatory connectivity between VMHdmSF1 neurons. Microendoscopic calcium imaging of VMHdmSF1 neurons revealed that persistent activity at the population level reflects heterogeneous dynamics among individual cells. Unexpectedly, distinct but overlapping VMHdmSF1 subpopulations were persistently activated by different modalities of threatening stimulus. Computational modelling suggests that neither recurrent excitation nor slow-acting neuromodulators alone can account for persistent activity that maintains stimulus identity. Our results show that stimulus-specific slow neural dynamics in the hypothalamus, on a time scale orders of magnitude longer than that of working memory in the cortex9,10, contribute to a persistent emotional state."
https://openalex.org/W3085399169,"The gut microbiota is associated with cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis. However, the composition, functional capacity, and metabolites of the gut microbiome about atherosclerosis have not been comprehensively studied. Here, we reanalyzed 25 metagenomic stool samples from Sweden and 385 metagenomic stool samples from China using HUMAnN2, PanPhlAn, and MelonnPan to obtain more sufficient information. We found that the samples from atherosclerotic patients in both cohorts were depleted in Bacteroides xylanisolvens, Odoribacter splanchnicus, Eubacterium eligens, Roseburia inulinivorans, and Roseburia intestinalis. At the functional level, healthy metagenomes were both enriched in pathways of starch degradation V, glycolysis III (from glucose), CDP-diacylglycerol biosynthesis, and folate transformations. R inulinivorans and R intestinalis are major contributors to starch degradation V, while E eligens greatly contribute to the pathway CDP-diacylglycerol biosynthesis, and B xylanisolvens and B uniformis contribute to folate transformations II. The 11 marker species selected from the Chinese cohort distinguish patients from controls with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of 0.86. Strain-level microbial analysis revealed a geographically associated adaptation of the strains from E eligens, B uniformis, and E coli. Two gut microbial metabolites, nicotinic acid and hydrocinnamic acid, had significantly higher predicted abundance in the control samples compared to the patients in the Chinese cohort, and interestinglynicotinic acid is already an effective lipid-lowering drug to reducing cardiovascular risk. Our results indicate intestinal bacteria such as B xylanisolvens, E eligens, and R inulinivorans could be promising probiotics and potential therapeutic target for atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W3087512712,"Age-related changes in the human brain functioning crucially affect the motor system, causing increased reaction time, low ability to control and execute movements, difficulties in learning new motor skills. The lifestyle and lowered daily activity of elderly adults, along with the deficit of motor and cognitive brain functions, might lead to the developed ambidexterity, i.e., the loss of dominant limb advances. Despite the broad knowledge about the changes in cortical activity directly related to the motor execution, less is known about age-related differences in the motor initiation phase. We hypothesize that the latter strongly influences the behavioral characteristics, such as reaction time, the accuracy of motor performance, etc. Here, we compare the neuronal processes underlying the motor initiation phase preceding fine motor task execution between elderly and young subjects. Based on the results of the whole-scalp sensor-level electroencephalography (EEG) analysis, we demonstrate that the age-related slowing down in the motor initiation before the dominant hand movements is accompanied by the increased theta activation within sensorimotor area and reconfiguration of the theta-band functional connectivity in elderly adults."
https://openalex.org/W3086489375,"The striosome compartment within the dorsal striatum has been implicated in reinforcement learning and regulation of motivation, but how striosomal neurons contribute to these functions remains elusive. Here, we show that a genetically identified striosomal population, which expresses the Teashirt family zinc finger 1 (Tshz1) and belongs to the direct pathway, drives negative reinforcement and is essential for aversive learning in mice. Contrasting a ""conventional"" striosomal direct pathway, the Tshz1 neurons cause aversion, movement suppression, and negative reinforcement once activated, and they receive a distinct set of synaptic inputs. These neurons are predominantly excited by punishment rather than reward and represent the anticipation of punishment or the motivation for avoidance. Furthermore, inhibiting these neurons impairs punishment-based learning without affecting reward learning or movement. These results establish a major role of striosomal neurons in behaviors reinforced by punishment and moreover uncover functions of the direct pathway unaccounted for in classic models."

Materials and methods Vaginal microbiota was analyzed using next-generation sequencing in women with normal, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), or cervical cancer. Results A marked decrease of Lactobacillus crispatus was found in the CIN/cancer groups compared with that in the normal group. The diversity of microorganisms increased in patients with CIN or cervical cancer with HPV infection.

https://openalex.org/W3085263632,"Hantaviruses are rodent-borne viruses causing serious zoonotic outbreaks worldwide for which no treatment is available. Hantavirus particles are pleomorphic and display a characteristic square surface lattice. The envelope glycoproteins Gn and Gc form heterodimers that further assemble into tetrameric spikes, the lattice building blocks. The glycoproteins, which are the sole targets of neutralizing antibodies, drive virus entry via receptor-mediated endocytosis and endosomal membrane fusion. Here we describe the high-resolution X-ray structures of the heterodimer of Gc and the Gn head and of the homotetrameric Gn base. Docking them into an 11.4-Å-resolution cryoelectron tomography map of the hantavirus surface accounted for the complete extramembrane portion of the viral glycoprotein shell and allowed a detailed description of the surface organization of these pleomorphic virions. Our results, which further revealed a built-in mechanism controlling Gc membrane insertion for fusion, pave the way for immunogen design to protect against pathogenic hantaviruses."

The TPD includes parliamentarians from all European Free Trade Association countries where over 45% of parliamentarians are on Twitter as well as a selection of English-speaking countries. The database is designed to move beyond the one-off nature of most Twitter-based research and in the direction of systematic and rigorous comparative and transnational analysis. The TPD incorporates, in addition to data collected through Twitter’s streaming API and governmental websites, data from the Manifesto Project Database; the Electoral System Design Database; the ParlGov database; and the Chapel Hill Expert Survey. By compiling these different data sources it becomes possible to compare different countries, political parties, political party families, and different kinds of democracies. To illustrate the opportunities for comparative and transnational analysis that the TPD opens up, we ask: What are the differences between countries in parliamentarian Twitter interactions? How do political parties differ in their use of hashtags and what is their common ground? What is the structure of interaction between parliamentarians in the transnational debate? Alongside some interesting similarities, we find striking cross-party and particularly cross-national differences in how parliamentarians engage in politics on the social media platform."
https://openalex.org/W3087159033,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, chronic fibrotic lung disease with an irreversible decline of lung function. ""Bronchiolization"", characterized by ectopic appearance of airway epithelial cells in the alveolar regions, is one of the characteristic features in the IPF lung. Based on the knowledge that club cells are the major epithelial secretory cells in human small airways, and their major secretory product uteroglobin (SCGB1A1) is significantly increased in both serum and epithelial lining fluid of IPF lung, we hypothesize that human airway club cells contribute to the pathogenesis of IPF. By assessing the transcriptomes of the single cells from human lung of control donors and IPF patients, we identified two SCGB1A1+ club cell subpopulations, highly expressing MUC5B, a significant genetic risk factor strongly associated with IPF, and SCGB3A2, a marker heterogeneously expressed in the club cells, respectively. Interestingly, the cellular proportion of SCGB1A1+MUC5B+ club cells was significantly increased in IPF patients, and this club cell subpopulation highly expressed genes related to mucous production and immune cell chemotaxis. In contrast, though the cellular proportion did not change, the molecular phenotype of the SCGB1A1+SCGB3A2high club cell subpopulation was significantly altered in IPF lung, with increased expression of mucins, cytokine and extracellular matrix genes. The single cell transcriptomic analysis reveals the cellular and molecular heterogeneity of club cells, and provide novel insights into the biological functions of club cells in the pathogenesis of IPF."
https://openalex.org/W3085724661,"Mid-life metabolic disease (ie, obesity, diabetes, and prediabetes) causes vascular dysfunction and is a risk factor for vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID), particularly in women. Using middle-aged mice, we modeled metabolic disease (obesity/prediabetes) via chronic high-fat (HF) diet and modeled VCID via unilateral common carotid artery occlusion. VCID impaired spatial memory in both sexes, but episodic-like memory in females only. HF diet caused greater weight gain and glucose intolerance in middle-aged females than males. HF diet alone impaired episodic-like memory in both sexes, but spatial memory in females only. Finally, the combination of HF diet and VCID elicited cognitive impairments in all tests, in both sexes. Sex-specific correlations were found between metabolic outcomes and memory. Notably, both visceral fat and the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha correlated with spatial memory deficits in middle-aged females, but not males. Overall, our data show that HF diet causes greater metabolic impairment and a wider array of cognitive deficits in middle-aged females than males. The combination of HF diet with VCID elicits deficits across multiple cognitive domains in both sexes. Our data are in line with clinical data, which shows that mid-life metabolic disease increases VCID risk, particularly in females."

Glycosylation belongs to the one of the most important post-translational modifications of macromolecules, comprising N- and O-glycosylation of proteins, thus playing an essential role in the growth and development of eukaryotes, as well as in host–pathogen interactions. This modification increases the solubility and structural stability of proteins, protects against proteolysis, assists in protein folding, and plays a crucial role in immune response, cell–cell and cell–extracellular matrix recognition, and selective protein targeting (1Song Z.

The glycan moiety is formed by glycosyltransferases, the majority of whose catalytic centers face the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus.

It is worth noting, however, that the above-mentioned approaches were based on a heterologous yeast expression system producing different types of N-glycans as compared with mammalian cells and on proteoliposomes using the protein overexpressed in S. cerevisiae cells. In contrast, our gene silencing analysis of the SLC35A3 gene did not result in significant changes in N-glycans (4Maszczak-Seneczko D. Sosicka P. Olczak T. Jakimowicz P. Majkowski M. Olczak M.

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), Lec8 (CHO mutant cells lacking functional SLC35A2 gene), and HeLa cells with significantly decreased SLC35A3 activity exhibited only a decreased amount of highly branched tri- and tetra-antennary complex type N-glycans, whereas monoantennary and diantennary ones remained unchanged or even were accumulated.

Importantly, we demonstrated that biological function of UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-Gal transporters in glycosylation of proteins may be coupled. This hypothesis was based on the observations that (i) overexpression of UDP-GlcNAc transporter in mutant cells defective in UDP-Gal transporter partially restores galactosylation of N-glycans (37Maszczak-Seneczko D.

This study presents novel data that broaden our knowledge of glycosylation process occurring in the Golgi apparatus. Taking into consideration that siRNA knockdown did not cause a complete inactivation of mRNA encoding SLC35A3 (4Maszczak-Seneczko D. Sosicka P. Olczak T. Jakimowicz P. Majkowski M. Olczak M. UDP–N-acetylglucosamine transporter (SLC35A3) regulates biosynthesis of highly branched N-glycans and keratan sulfate.J. Biol.

Again, no significant changes in N-glycan synthesis were observed. Moreover, the knockout cells also continued to produce GlcNAc-containing O-glycans. Interestingly, we observed not only cell-specific glycosylation pattern but also differences in UDP-GlcNAc transporting activity. These findings suggest that SLC35A3 may not be the key transporter of UDP-GlcNAc and/or that different mechanisms of UDP-GlcNAc transport into the Golgi apparatus should be taken into consideration. We constructed knockout cells lacking not only the SLC35A3 transporter but also both SLC35A3 and SLC35A2 proteins. This attempt allowed us to follow changes occurring in N- and O-glycans in different cell lines resulting not only from a single deletion of the respective transporter but also from a combined deficiency of the two highly homologous and functionally related SLC35A subfamily members, which is important for broadening our knowledge on the functional glycosylation complexes and potential involvement of their members in the glycosylation process. Taking into account the phenomenon of cell-specific glycosylation, a panel of CHO, HEK293T, and HepG2 cell lines consisting of (i) WT cells, (ii) single-knockout cells lacking SLC35A2, (iii) single-knockout cells lacking SLC35A3, and (iv) double-knockout cells lacking both SLC35A2 (A2KO) and SLC35A3 (A3KO) were analyzed. To obtain cell lines deficient in particular proteins, we employed CRISPR-Cas9 or CRISPR-Cas9 double nickase technology. The absence of SLC35A2 protein was confirmed by Western blotting analysis using highly specific anti-SLC35A2 antibody (Fig. 1). A similar approach was impossible in the case of SLC35A3 because of the lack of specific antibody. Therefore, to confirm that inactivation of the corresponding genes was effective, genomic DNA and RNA were isolated from WT cells and from several clones of the knockout cells. PCR and RT-PCR with subsequent DNA sequencing showed that the changes we detected do not allow for production of functional full-length or truncated protein, confirming that the CRISPR-Cas9 strategy successfully inactivated SLC35A3 gene in HepG2, HepG2 A2KO, HEK293T, HEK293T A2KO, CHO, and Lec8 cells (Figure 2, Figure 3 and Table 1).Figure 3Evaluation of SLC35A3 gene knockout in CHO and Lec8 cells.

In contrast to differences clearly visible in the case of SLC35A2-deficient cells, no significant changes in N-glycan profiles between the WT and SLC35A3-deficient cells were observed (Fig. S1). Then 2-aminobenzamide (2-AB) derivatives were analyzed in detail using MALDI-TOF MS. If SLC35A3 was the main Golgi UDP-GlcNAc transporter, no complex type structures could be formed in cells lacking its activity. However, in the case of all single-knockout SLC35A3 cells, every complex type N-glycan typical of the parental cells could be detected (Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). However, subtle quantitative differences could be observed. In the case of CHO cells, four tetra-antennary structures were considerably decreased (Fig. 4, m/z of ∼2660, 3026, 3390, and 3754). This was less evident in the case of HEK293T cells (Fig. 5). Interestingly, the cells lacking both SLC35A2 and SLC35A3 displayed much more profound defects compared with the single-knockout cells. First of all, in the case of the double CHO and HEK293T knockout cells, a complete disappearance of a tetra-antennary, fucosylated structure could be observed (Figure 4, Figure 5, m/z of ∼2011). In the case of CHO cells lacking both SLC35A2 and SLC35A3, a triantennary, nonfucosylated structure (m/z of ∼1663) was also absent from the N-glycan profile. In addition, a triantennary, fucosylated structure (m/z of ∼1802) was completely lost in the case of HEK293T double-knockout cells, resulting in a unique profile completely devoid of complex type N-glycans with more than two antennae, whereas in the case of CHO cells, the relative amount of this structure was substantially reduced. In the case of HepG2 knockout cells, however, we did not observe major changes in N-glycan profiles of SLC35A3-deficient cells compared with the WT cells (Fig. 6). Importantly, in contrast to CHO and HEK293T cell lines, no significant changes could be observed in the case of SLC35A3 knockout constructed in SLC35A2-deficient cells.Figure 4Structural analysis of N-glycans isolated from CHO cells. 2-AB–labeled N-glycans derived from CHO WT (A), Lec8 (B), CHO SLC35A3-deficient (CHO A3KO) (C), and Lec8 SLC35A3-deficient (Lec8 A3KO) (D) cells were treated with neuraminidase and subjected to MALDI-TOF MS analysis carried out in positive ion mode with Na+ excess.

https://openalex.org/W3087573541,"Treatment of diseases that affect the CNS by gene therapy requires delivery of oligonucleotides to target cells within the brain. As the blood brain barrier prevents movement of large biomolecules, current approaches involve direct injection of the oligonucleotides, which is invasive and may have only a localised effect. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of 2 nm galactose-coated gold nanoparticles (NP-Gal) as a delivery system of oligonucleotides across brain endothelium. DNA oligonucleotides of different types were attached to NP-Gal by the place exchange reaction and were characterised by EMSA (electrophoretic mobility shift assay). Several nanoparticle formulations were created, with single- or double-stranded (20nt or 40nt) DNA oligonucleotides, or with different amounts of DNA attached to the carriers. These nanocarriers were applied to transwell cultures of human brain endothelium in vitro (hCMEC/D3 cell-line) or to a 3D-hydrogel model of the blood-brain barrier including astrocytes. Transfer rates were measured by quantitative electron microscopy for the nanoparticles and qPCR for DNA. Despite the increase in nanoparticle size caused by attachment of oligonucleotides to the NP-Gal carrier, the rates of endocytosis and transcytosis of nanoparticles were both considerably increased when they carried an oligonucleotide cargo. Carriers with 40nt dsDNA were most efficient, accumulating in vesicles, in the cytosol and beneath the basal membrane of the endothelium. The oligonucleotide cargo remained attached to the nanocarriers during transcytosis and the transport rate across the endothelial cells was increased at least 50fold compared with free DNA. The nanoparticles entered the extracellular matrix and were taken up by the astrocytes in biologically functional amounts. Attachment of DNA confers a strong negative charge to the nanoparticles which may explain the enhanced binding to the endothelium and transcytosis by both vesicular transport and the transmembrane/cytosol pathway. These gold nanoparticles have the potential to transport therapeutic amounts of nucleic acids into the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W3087221584,"Objectives Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) causes significant morbidity. Candida albicans is the main pathogen associated with both sporadic and recurrent candidiasis. Due to unsatisfactory treatment effect, the impact of chlorhexidine digluconate and fluconazole alone or in combination on C. albicans and biofilm was investigated. Methods Vaginal C. albicans isolates from 18 patients with recurrent candidiasis and commensals from 19 asymptomatic women were isolated by culture. Crystal violet, XTT and colony forming unit assay were used to analyze the effect of chlorhexidine digluconate and fluconazole on growth of C. albicans, formation of new and already established, mature, biofilm. Results Fluconazole reduced the growth of planktonic C. albicans. However, in established biofilm, fluconazole had no effect on the candida cells and was not able to disperse and reduce the biofilm. By contrast, chlorhexidine digluconate had a direct killing effect on C. albicans grown both planktonically and in biofilm. Chlorhexidine digluconate also dispersed mature biofilm and inhibited formation of new biofilm. No major differences were observed between commensal isolates and candida causing recurrent vulvovaginitis with respect to biofilm or growth after chlorhexidine digluconate treatment. Conclusion Biofilm is a problem in patients with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis reducing the effect of antifungal treatment. Development of new treatment strategies are urgently needed to decrease the recurrences. In already established biofilm, chlorhexidine digluconate dispersed the biofilm and was more effective in eradicating candida compared to fluconazole. Future treatment strategy may thus be a combination of chlorhexidine digluconate and fluconazole and prophylactic use of chlorhexidine digluconate to prevent biofilm formation and restrict infections."
https://openalex.org/W3087013131,"Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death worldwide. After an ischemic injury, the myocardium undergoes severe necrosis and apoptosis, leading to a dramatic degradation of function. Numerous studies have reported that cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) play a critical role in heart function even after injury. However, CFs present heterogeneous characteristics according to their development stage (i.e., fetal or adult), and the molecular mechanisms by which they maintain heart function are not fully understood. The aim of this study is to explore the hypothesis that a specific population of CFs can repair the injured myocardium in heart failure following ischemic infarction, and lead to a significant recovery of cardiac function. Flow cytometry analysis of CFs defined two subpopulations according to their relative expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1). Whole-transcriptome analysis described distinct profiles for these groups, with a correlation between VCAM1 expression and lymphangiogenesis-related genes up-regulation. Vascular formation assays showed a significant stimulation of lymphatic cells network complexity by VCFs. Injection of human VCAM1-expressing CFs (VCFs) in postinfarct heart failure rat models (ligation of the left anterior descending artery) led to a significant restoration of the left ventricle contraction. Over the course of the experiment, left ventricular ejection fraction and fractional shortening increased by 16.65% ± 5.64% and 10.43% ± 6.02%, respectively, in VCF-treated rats. Histological examinations revealed that VCFs efficiently mobilized the lymphatic endothelial cells into the infarcted area. In conclusion, human CFs present heterogeneous expression of VCAM1 and lymphangiogenesis-promoting factors. VCFs restore the mechanical properties of ventricular walls by mobilizing lymphatic endothelial cells into the infarct when injected into a rat heart failure model. These results suggest a role of this specific population of CFs in the homeostasis of the lymphatic system in cardiac regeneration, providing new information for the study and therapy of cardiac diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3087748416,"The present study tests predictions from the Tripartite Integration Model of Social Influences (TIMSI) concerning processes linking social interactions to social integration into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) communities and careers. Students from historically overrepresented groups in STEM were followed from their senior year of high school through their senior year in college. Based on TIMSI, we hypothesized that interactions with social influence agents (operationalized as mentor network diversity, faculty mentor support, and research experiences) would promote both short- and long-term integration into STEM via social influence processes (operationalized as science self-efficacy, identity, and internalized community values). Moreover, we examined the previously untested hypothesis of reciprocal influences from early levels of social integration in STEM to future engagement with social influence agents. Results of a series of longitudinal structural equation model-based mediation analyses indicate that, in the short term, higher levels of faculty mentorship support and research engagement, and to a lesser degree more diverse mentor networks in college promote deeper integration into the STEM community through the development of science identity and science community values. Moreover, results indicate that, in the long term, earlier high levels of integration in STEM indirectly influences research engagement through the development of higher science identity. These results extend our understanding of the TIMSI framework and advance our understanding of the reciprocal nature of social influences that draw students into STEM careers."
https://openalex.org/W3086777005,"Renal fibrosis is a common pathological hallmark of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Renal sympathetic nerve activity is elevated in patients and experimental animals with CKD and contributes to renal interstitial fibrosis in obstructive nephropathy. However, the mechanisms underlying sympathetic overactivation in renal fibrosis remain unknown. Norepinephrine (NE), the main sympathetic neurotransmitter, was found to promote TGF-β1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and fibrotic gene expression in the human renal proximal epithelial cell line HK-2. Using both genetic and pharmacological approaches, we identified that NE binds Gαq-coupled α1-adrenoceptor (α1-AR) to enhance EMT of HK-2 cells by activating p38/Smad3 signaling. Inhibition of p38 diminished the NE-exaggerated EMT process and increased the fibrotic gene expression in TGF-β1-treated HK-2 cells. Moreover, the pharmacological blockade of α1-AR reduced the kidney injury and renal fibrosis in a unilateral ureteral obstruction mouse model by suppressing EMT in the kidneys. Thus, sympathetic overactivation facilitates EMT of renal epithelial cells and fibrosis via the α1-AR/p38/Smad3 signaling pathway, and α1-AR inhibition may be a promising approach toward treating renal fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W3087664178,"Under climate change, regional Sea Surface Temperature (SST) changes are a crucial factor affecting marine ecosystems, which thrive only within a certain thermal limit. Thirty-seven years of monthly gridded Optimum Interpolation SST data from 1982 to 2017 were used to investigate the decadal variability of this parameter in the Red Sea during the summer season, in relation to large-scale climate variability. We identified a non-uniform warming trend beginning around the mid-1990s over the whole basin, with a predominant amplified warming over the northern half (0.04°C year-1), which is approximately four times higher than the global warming trend, but much weaker warming over southern end (0.01°C year-1). It was found that the Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation (AMO) and the Silk Road Pattern (SRP) are shaping the RS SST, since their phase shift concurs with the timing of the significant non-uniform warming over the basin. The AMO triggers the SRP-related vertical and horizontal temperature advection that leads to opposite changes in the SST. We suggest that warming is amplified over the basin due to an overlap with global warming signals. Our results have important implications for interannual and decadal SST predictions based on the predictability of AMO and SRP patterns."
https://openalex.org/W3087288787,"The mesothelium is a dynamic and specialized tissue layer that covers the somatic cavities (pleural, peritoneal, and pericardial) as well as the surface of the visceral organs such as the lung, heart, liver, bowel and tunica vaginalis testis. The potential therapeutic manipulation of visceral organs has been complicated by the carbohydrate surface layer-here, called the mesopolysaccharide (MPS)-that coats the outer layer of the mesothelium. The traditional understanding of MPS structure has relied upon fixation techniques known to degrade carbohydrates. The recent development of carbohydrate-preserving fixation for high resolution imaging techniques has provided an opportunity to re-examine the structure of both the MPS and the visceral mesothelium. In this report, we used high pressure freezing (HPF) as well as serial section transmission electron microscopy to redefine the structure of the MPS expressed on the murine lung, heart and liver surface. Tissue preserved by HPF and examined by transmission electron microscopy demonstrated a pleural MPS layer 13.01±1.1 um deep-a 100-fold increase in depth compared to previously reported data obtained with conventional fixation techniques. At the base of the MPS were microvilli 1.1±0.35 um long and 42±5 nm in diameter. Morphological evidence suggested that the MPS was anchored to the mesothelium by microvilli. In addition, membrane pits 97±17 nm in diameter were observed in the apical mesothelial membrane. The spatial proximity and surface density (29±4.5%) of the pits suggested an active process linked to the structural maintenance of the MPS. The striking magnitude and complex structure of the MPS indicates that it is an important consideration in studies of the visceral mesothelium."

Because this organ connects the plant vasculature to the external environment, it is also a known entry site for several vascular pathogens. In this study, we present a detailed microscopic examination of leaf apical hydathodes in monocots for three crops (maize, rice and sugarcane) and the model plant Brachypodium distachyon. Our study highlights both similarities and specificities of those epithemal hydathodes. These observations will serve as a foundation for future studies on the physiology and the immunity of hydathodes in monocots."
https://openalex.org/W3087147178,"Polymyositis and inclusion body myositis are idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, with a pathology characterized by partial invasion of non-necrotic muscle fibres by CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells, leading to fibre degeneration. Although the main effector pathway of CD8+ T-cells is to induce apoptosis of target cells, it has remained unclear if apoptosis occurs in these diseases, and if so, if it is mediated by CD8+ T-cells. In consecutive biopsy sections from 10 patients with partial invasion, muscle fibres and inflammatory cells were assessed by immunohistochemistry and apoptotic nuclei by the TUNEL assay. Analysis of muscle fibre morphology, staining pattern and quantification were performed on digital images, and they were compared with biopsies from 10 dermatomyositis patients and 10 controls without muscle disease. Apoptotic myonuclei were found in muscle with partial invasion, but not in the invaded fibres. Fibres with TUNEL positive nuclei were surrounded by CD8+ T-cells, granzyme B+ cells and macrophages, but lacked FAS receptor expression. In contrast, apoptotic myonuclei were rare in dermatomyositis and absent in controls. The findings confirm that apoptosis occurs in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies and support that it is mediated by CD8+ cytotoxic T- cells, acting in parallel to the process of partial invasion."
https://openalex.org/W3087192631,"HIV-infected older individuals may have a diminished immune response because of exhaustion/immune aging of T-cells. Therefore, we have investigated HIV-specific CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses in 100 HIV-infected patients (HIV+) who have aged on long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART) and achieved controlled viremia (mostly undetectable viral load; 92 patients with <20 to <40 HIV RNA copies/mL and 8 <60 to <100) and improved CD4 T-cell counts. We show that the median frequencies of HIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ IFN-γ T-cells were higher in HIV+ than uninfected individuals (HIV-), including increasing levels of IFN-γproduced by CD4+ T-cells and decreasing levels by CD8+ T-cells with increasing CD4 T-cell counts in HIV+. No correlation was found between T-cell responses and varying levels of undetectable viremia. HIV-specific TNF-α made by CD8+ T-cells was higher in HIV+ than HIV-, including decreasing levels with increasing CD4 T-cell counts in HIV+. Furthermore, the CD8+ T-cell mediators, CD107a and Granzyme-B, were higher in HIV+ than HIV-, and decreased with increasing CD4 T-cell counts in HIV+. Remarkably, HIV-specific CD8 T-cells produced decreasing levels of IFN-γwith increasing age of HIV+, including decreased levels of CD107a and Granzyme-B in older HIV+. However, HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells produced increasing levels of TNF-α with increasing age of the HIV+, suggesting continued inflammation. In conclusion, HIV+ with controlled viremia on long-term ART and with higher CD4 T-cell counts showed reduced HIV-specific CD8 T-cell responses as compared to those with lower CD4 T-cell counts, and older HIV+ exhibited decreasing levels of CD8 T-cell responses with increasing age."
https://openalex.org/W3087684742,"Lignin is the second most abundant carbon polymer on earth and despite having more fuel value than cellulose, it currently is considered a waste byproduct in many industrial lignocellulose applications. Valorization of lignin relies on effective and green methods of de-lignification, with a growing interest in the use of microbes. Here we investigate the physiology and molecular response of the novel facultative anaerobic bacterium, Tolumonas lignolytica BRL6-1, to lignin under anoxic conditions. Physiological and biochemical changes were compared between cells grown anaerobically in either lignin-amended or unamended conditions. In the presence of lignin, BRL6-1 accumulates higher biomass and has a shorter lag phase compared to unamended conditions, and 14% of the proteins determined to be significantly higher in abundance by log2 fold-change of 2 or greater were related to Fe(II) transport in late logarithmic phase. Ferrozine assays of the supernatant confirmed that Fe(III) was bound to lignin and reduced to Fe(II) only in the presence of BRL6-1, suggesting redox activity by the cells. LC-MS/MS analysis of the secretome showed an extra band at 20 kDa in lignin-amended conditions. Protein sequencing of this band identified a protein of unknown function with homology to enzymes in the radical SAM superfamily. Expression of this protein in lignin-amended conditions suggests its role in radical formation. From our findings, we suggest that BRL6-1 is using a protein in the radical SAM superfamily to interact with the Fe(III) bound to lignin and reducing it to Fe(II) for cellular use, increasing BRL6-1 yield under lignin-amended conditions. This interaction potentially generates organic free radicals and causes a radical cascade which could modify and depolymerize lignin. Further research should clarify the extent to which this mechanism is similar to previously described aerobic chelator-mediated Fenton chemistry or radical producing lignolytic enzymes, such as lignin peroxidases, but under anoxic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3087194069,"Malignant melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer, is characterized by high prevalence of BRAF/NRAS mutations and hyperactivation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), leading to uncontrolled melanoma growth. Efficacy of current targeted therapies against mutant BRAF or MEK1/2 have been hindered by existence of innate or development of acquired resistance. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms controlled by MAPK pathway driving melanogenesis will help develop new treatment approaches targeting this oncogenic cascade. Here, we identify E3 ubiquitin ligase PARK2 as a direct target of ELK1, a known transcriptional effector of MAPK signaling in melanoma cells. We show that pharmacological inhibition of BRAF-V600E or ERK1/2 in melanoma cells increases PARK2 expression. PARK2 overexpression reduces melanoma cell growth in vitro and in vivo and induces apoptosis. Conversely, its genetic silencing increases melanoma cell proliferation and reduces cell death. Further, we demonstrate that ELK1 is required by the BRAF-ERK1/2 pathway to repress PARK2 expression and promoter activity in melanoma cells. Clinically, PARK2 is highly expressed in WT BRAF and NRAS melanomas, but it is expressed at low levels in melanomas carrying BRAF/NRAS mutations. Overall, our data provide new insights into the tumor suppressive role of PARK2 in malignant melanoma and uncover a novel mechanism for the negative regulation of PARK2 via the ERK1/2-ELK1 axis.

These findings suggest that reactivation of PARK2 may be a promising therapeutic approach to counteract melanoma growth. Malignant melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer. The most prevalent genetic alterations in melanoma are mutually exclusive mutations in BRAF and NRAS, which occur in nearly 50 and 25% of melanoma patients, respectively (1Cancer Genome Atlas NetworkGenomic classification of cutaneous melanoma.Cell. 2015; 161 (26091043): 1681-169610.1016/j.cell.2015.05.044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar). These mutations result in hyperactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), and consequent uncontrolled melanoma growth. These terminal kinases of the cascade catalyze the phosphorylation, mainly at Ser/Thr-Pro residues, of hundreds of cytoplasmic and nuclear substrates, including regulatory molecules and transcription factors (2Roskoski Jr., R.

The aberrant activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2-ELK1 signaling pathway has provided the basis for efficient targeted therapy with specific inhibitors of mutant BRAF and MEK in melanoma. However, the presence of innate and development of acquired resistance have hindered the long-term clinical benefits of these treatments. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms controlled by MAPK signaling will help develop efficient treatment approaches targeting this pathway in dismal skin cancer. Here, we identified PARK2 as a novel target of the oncogenic ERK1/2-ELK1 pathway, and we provided insights into the role of PARK2 in melanoma.

Our findings define a novel mechanism through which the MAPK pathway controls melanoma cell growth through the suppression of PARK2 in an ELK1-dependent manner, and thus will contribute develop new treatment approaches targeting this oncogenic cascade. Western blotting (WB) and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analyses in melanoma cell lines showed that PARK2 expression is lower in cells harboring BRAFV600E or NRASQ61R mutations (SK-Mel-2, SK-Mel-5, SK-Mel-28, A375, 501-Mel) compared with those with WT BRAF or NRAS (M51, SSM2c, SK-Mel-197). Only SK-Mel-197 cells express high levels of pERK1/2 and low levels of PARK2, although they do not carry mutations in BRAF or NRAS (Fig. 1, A and B). Further analysis showed reduced PARK2 mRNA expression in melanoma cell lines compared with normal human epidermal melanocytes (NHEM) (Fig. 1B). In support of the biological relevance of this finding, analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) melanoma cohort shows higher PARK2 expression in WT compared with mutant BRAS/NRAS metastatic melanomas (p = 0.0027) (Fig. 1C). In agreement with these data, analysis of publicly available transcriptomic datasets (GDS1375) showed that PARK2 mRNA was expressed at higher level in human nevi (n = 18) compared with malignant melanomas (n = 45) (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1D). In addition, there is a trend toward improved overall survival with increased PARK2 expression in metastatic disease, although not statistically significant (Fig. S1). At the cellular level, Western blot analysis indicated a cytosolic localization of PARK2 in melanoma cells (Fig. 1E). Immunofluorescence confirmed these data and showed a colocalization of PARK2 with the protein COXIV, a mitochondrial marker (Fig. 1F). Altogether, our data indicate that PARK2 expression is down-regulated in human melanomas compared with nevi and that metastatic melanomas carrying WT BRAF/NRAS show higher expression of PARK2 compared with those with mutant BRAF/NRAS. To investigate the effect of the RAS-RAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling on PARK2 expression, melanoma cells harboring BRAFV600E (A375, SK-Mel-5, SK-Mel-28, and 501-Mel) were treated with specific inhibitors of the BRAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 cascade. Treatment with the BRAF-V600E inhibitor vemurafenib (19Søndergaard J.N. Nazarian R. Wang Q. Guo D. Hsueh T. Mok S. Sazegar H. MacConaill L.E. Barretina J.G. Kehoe S.M. Attar N. von Euw E.

Likewise, treatment with SCH-772984, an ERK1/2 inhibitor (21Morris E.J. Jha S. Restaino C.R. Dayananth P. Zhu H. Cooper A. Carr D. Deng Y. Jin W. Black S. Long B. Liu J. Dinunzio E. Windsor W. Zhang R. et al.Discovery of a novel ERK inhibitor with activity in models of acquired resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors.Cancer Discov. 2013; 3 (23614898): 742-75010.1158/2159-8290.CD-13-0070Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), consistently increased PARK2 protein levels in all four melanoma cell lines (Fig. 1H and Fig. S2B). To further clarify whether modulation of PARK2 by the BRAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling was exerted also at transcriptional level, qPCR analysis of PARK2 mRNA was performed after inhibition of BRAF-V600E or ERK1/2. Expression of PARK2 mRNA was drastically increased upon treatment with vemurafenib or SCH-772984 (Fig. 1I). The efficiency of these inhibitors was confirmed by strong down-regulation of phosphorylated ERK1/2 level (Fig. 1, G and H and Fig. S2) and of Cyclin D1 (Fig. 1J), an established mitogenic target of mutant RAS signaling. Consistent with these results, transient overexpression of BRAF-V600E in SSM2c melanoma cells and in HEK-293T cells, which harbor WT BRAF and NRAS, led to a reduction of PARK2 both at mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 1, K–M). Furthermore, qPCR analysis in HEK-293T cells treated with EGF, which induces phosphorylation of ERK1/2, shows an increase in Cyclin D1 and c-Fos levels (Fig. S3, A and B) and a time-dependent decrease of PARK2 level (Fig. S3C). Altogether, these data indicate that in melanoma cells the RAS-RAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway negatively regulates expression of PARK2. Bioinformatic analysis identified putative ELK1 binding sites (BS) within the human PARK2 promoter (obtained from the UCSC Genome Browser assembly, ID: hg38) near the transcription start site (TSS) (Fig. 2A and Fig. S4). ELK1, a major downstream effector of ERK1/2, is a member of the ETS (E 26) oncogene family of transcription factors involved in many biological processes, such as cell growth, differentiation and survival, inflammation, and cancer (3Gille H.

Therefore, we investigated whether ELK1 might be a mediator of the RAS-RAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 cascade in modulating PARK2 expression. Treatment of A375 and SK-Mel-5 melanoma cells with the ERK1/2 inhibitor SCH-772984 drastically reduced ELK1 phosphorylation at serine 383 in both cell lines (Fig. 2B). To investigate whether ELK1 directly binds PARK2 promoter, we performed ChIP assay using two different ELK1-specific antibodies. Analysis of the immunoprecipitated DNA by qPCR showed that endogenous ELK1 binds to PARK2 promoter (Fig. 2C). This result was confirmed also upon ELK1 overexpression in HEK-293T cells (Fig. S5A) and upon ELK1 silencing in A375 melanoma cells (Fig. S5B). To confirm the ability of ELK1 to regulate PARK2 expression, the PARK2 promoter (−635 to +98 from the TSS) containing the putative ELK1 BS (CCGGAAA) was cloned into a luciferase reporter. Ectopic expression of ELK1 in A375 and SK-Mel-197 melanoma cells showed a strong reduction of luciferase activity (Fig. 2D). Mutation of the ELK1-binding element strongly reduces the inhibition of PARK2 transactivation by ELK1 overexpression in both cell lines (Fig. 2D). Consistent with the negative regulation of PARK2 by ELK1, silencing of ELK1 with two specific independent shRNAs (LV-shELK1-1, LV-shELK1-2) increased PARK2 mRNA and protein levels in A375 and SK-Mel-5 melanoma cells (Fig. S5, C–F), whereas overexpression of ELK1 in HEK-293T cells had the opposite effect (Fig. S5, G and H). In support of the relevance of the negative regulation of PARK2 expression by ELK1, a statistically significant negative correlation was found between ELK1 and PARK2 expression in the TCGA melanoma cohort (n = 481) (Fig. 2E). To confirm the involvement of ELK1 downstream of MEK1/2-ERK1/2 in regulating PARK2 expression, we overexpressed BRAF-V600E in ELK1-silenced cells. ELK1 depletion enhanced PARK2 mRNA and protein levels, whereas BRAF-V600E overexpression reduced PARK2 expression, as expected. Interestingly, silencing of ELK1 in presence of BRAF-V600E overexpression rescued the reduction of PARK2 expression elicited by BRAFV-600E (Fig. 2, F and G). Consistent with these results, genetic silencing of ELK1 strongly increased PARK2 promoter activity, even when it was co-expressed with BRAF-V600E (Fig. 2H). In addition, PARK2 transactivation induced by the ERK1/2 inhibitor SCH-772984 was reverted by ELK1 overexpression (Fig. 2I). The negative modulation of PARK2 by ELK1 was also confirmed in glioblastoma (U87MG) and breast cancer (MCF7) cell lines. Indeed, in both cell types, PARK2 mRNA and protein levels were decreased upon ELK1 expression (Fig. S6). Altogether, our data indicate that in melanoma cells PARK2 expression is negatively regulated by the RAS-RAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling through the transcription factor ELK1, a new repressor of PARK2 transcription. Further, our results suggest that the regulation of PARK2 by ELK1 may take place in other cancer types beyond melanoma, and it might be a general mechanism to restrain PARK2 function in cancer cells. To evaluate the effect of restoring PARK2 expression in melanoma, we overexpressed it in four melanoma cell lines having low level of PARK2 (A375, SK-Mel-5, SK-Mel-28, and 501-Mel) using a retroviral vector encoding full-length PARK2. Stable overexpression of PARK2, confirmed at protein level (Fig. 3A and Fig. S7A), induced a decrease of melanoma cell growth in all four cell lines (Fig. 3, B and C and Fig. S7, B and C). Consistently, ectopic expression of PARK2 drastically decreased the number of adherent colonies in all four melanoma cell lines (Fig. 3, D and E and Fig. S7, D and E). Next, we tested whether ectopic PARK2 expression might affect the ability to form colonies in soft agar. We found that the number of colonies formed by PARK2-expressing melanoma cells was reduced compared with those in the control melanoma cells in A375 and SK-Mel-5 (Fig. 3, F and G). Further, we demonstrated that the reduced growth of melanoma cells expressing PARK2 was due to an increase in apoptosis. FACS-based Annexin V/7AAD analysis showed an increase of the fraction of apoptotic cells in PARK2 overexpressing cell lines (Fig. 3, H and I and Fig. S7, F and G). Further analysis showed reduced expression of the anti-apoptotic factors BCL-2 and BCL-XL at protein level upon PARK2 overexpression (Fig. 3J and Fig. S7H). qPCR showed also an increase of the pro-apoptotic factor PIG3 in PARK2-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3, K and L). PARK2 has been shown to negatively regulate the AKT pathway, a known survival pathway in melanoma (9Lin D.C. Xu L. Chen Y. Yan H. Hazawa M. Doan N. Said J.W. Ding L.W. Liu L.Z. Yang H. Yu S. Kahn M.

Our data confirmed the reduction of AKT activation (phosphorylation of Ser-473) upon PARK2 overexpression in SK-Mel-5 and, to a lesser extent, in A375 and SK-Mel-28 melanoma cells (Fig. S7I). To further investigate the role of PARK2 in melanoma, PARK2 was silenced in two patient-derived melanoma cell lines (SSM2c and M51), which expressed the highest levels of PARK2, and in a commercial melanoma cell line (SK-Mel-197), which expressed low PARK2 levels, using two different short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) specific for PARK2 (LV-shPARK2-1, LV-shPARK2-2). Western blot analysis showed a strong reduction of PARK2 protein level in cells transduced with both shRNAs (Fig. 4A and Fig. S8A). PARK2 silencing induced an increase of melanoma cell viability over time (Fig. 4, B and C and Fig. S8B) and enhanced colony formation in soft agar in SSM2c and SK-Mel-197 PARK2-depleted cells compared with control, although only LV-shPARK2-1 led to a significant reduction of colony formation in SK-Mel-197 (Fig. 4, D and E). Cytometric analysis of Annexin V/7AAD staining revealed a decrease in the percentage of apoptotic cells in PARK2-silenced cells (Fig. 4, F and G and Fig. S8C). Consistently, Western blot analysis showed that PARK2 silencing increased expression level of the anti-apoptotic factor BCL-2 in all melanoma cell lines (Fig. 4H and Fig. S8D). Moreover, PARK2 silencing led to a consistent increase in the expression of pAKT in SK-Mel-197 and M51 cells (Fig. S8E). Altogether, our data indicate that PARK2 reduces melanoma cell growth promoting apoptosis. To investigate whether PARK2 might affect melanoma xenograft growth in vivo, A375 cells stably transduced with pBABE or PARK2 were subcutaneously injected into the flanks of athymic nude mice and tumor growth was monitored over time. Ectopic expression of PARK2 reduced by 60% the size of melanoma xenografts compared with pBABE control (Fig. 5A and B). Western blotting in dissected tumors confirmed PARK2 overexpression with a 20- to 30-fold increase compared with controls (Fig. 5C) and a drastic decrease of BCL-2 protein level (Fig. 5C), consistent with in vitro tumor cell growth experiments. Induction of apoptosis was confirmed at the molecular level in PARK2-overexpressing xenografts by increased BAX/BCL-2 ratio (Fig. 5D), an indicator of apoptosis (26Oltval Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Bcl-2 heterodimerizes in vivo with a conserved homolog, Bax, that accelerates programmed cell death.Cell. 1993; 74 (8358790): 609-61910.1016/0092-8674(93)90509-OAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5820) Google Scholar, 27Pietrobono S.

PARK2 overexpression in xenografts was also confirmed by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 5E). The degree of reduction of melanoma growth upon PARK2 overexpression in vivo was greater than the decrease of melanoma cell growth observed in vitro, suggesting a potential role of the tumor microenvironment. Altogether, these results indicate that PARK2 represses melanoma cell growth in vitro and in vivo, further confirming the tumor suppressive role of PARK2 in melanoma. Finally, we addressed whether silencing of PARK2 would revert the reduction of melanoma cell proliferation induced by inhibition of BRAF-V600E. Vemurafenib treatment reduced melanoma cell growth in a dose-dependent manner in SK-Mel-28 cells transduced with LV-c, as expected. On the other hand, vemurafenib had a very minor effect in reducing melanoma cell growth in absence of PARK2 (Fig. 6, A and B). For instance, treatment with vemurafenib at 50 nm reduced growth of LV-c–transduced cells by 26%, but only by 3.6% in PARK2-silenced cells (Fig. 6C). These results indicate that PARK2 depletion partially rescues the effect of BRAF-V600E inhibition, suggesting that PARK2 is important to mediate the effects of BRAF-ERK1/2 activation in melanoma. The RAS-RAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway is a complex signaling network that integrates numerous upstream stimuli to modulate several cellular processes, including cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Aberrant activation of this signaling pathway occurs in the majority of malignant melanomas (1Cancer Genome Atlas NetworkGenomic classification of cutaneous melanoma.Cell. 2015; 161 (26091043): 1681-169610.1016/j.cell.2015.05.044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar). In this study, we provide the evidence that PARK2 is negatively modulated by the RAS-RAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling via the transcription factor ELK1. In addition, we provide new evidence of the tumor-suppressive role of PARK2 in melanoma, where PARK2 restrains melanoma cell growth downstream of ERK1/2 through the induction of cellular apoptosis. Our data highlight a previously unexplored mechanism of PARK2 regulation by the RAS-RAF-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling through the transcription factor ELK1, which belongs to the ETS family. ELK1 is the best studied ETS member, and it is directly phosphorylated and activated by ERK1/2 (3Gille H. Kortenjann M. Thomae O. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Cobb M.H. Shaw P.E.

Immunity-related GTPase M (IRGM) in human locates at the inner membrane of mitochondria and is best known for its role in regulating autophagy against intracellular pathogens. Previous studies have shown that IRGM is crucial for the normal function of mitochondria, yet, the molecular mechanisms underlying IRGM-mediated quality control of mitochondria are still not fully understood. In this study, we showed that knocking-down IRGM inhibits CCCP induced mitophagy in SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, we reported that IRGM decreases the stability of Mitofilin (IMMT, MIC60) in the damaged mitochondria. Knocking down Mitofilin rescues the loss of mitophagy that is observed in the IRGM KD cells, suggesting that IRGM regulates mitophagy through the inhibition of Mitofilin. These data together provide molecular insight regarding how IRGM regulates mitophagy to control the quality of mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W3087014191,"Objective The proportion of US emergency department (ED) visits that lead to hospitalization has declined over time. The degree to which advanced imaging use contributed to this trend is unknown. Our objective was to examine the association between advanced imaging use during ED visits and changes in ED hospitalization rates between 2007–2008 and 2015–2016. Methods We analyzed data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. The primary outcome was ED hospitalization, including admission to inpatient and observation units and outside transfers. The primary exposure was advanced imaging during the ED visit, including computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound. We constructed a survey-weighted multivariable logistic regression with binary outcome of ED hospitalization to examine changes in adjusted hospitalization rates from 2007–2008 to 2015–2016, comparing ED visits with and without advanced imaging. Results ED patients who received advanced imaging (versus those who did not) were more likely to be 65 years or older (25.3% vs 13.0%), non-Hispanic white (65.3% vs 58.5%), female (58.4% vs 54.1%), and have Medicare (26.5% vs 16.0%). Among ED visits with advanced imaging, adjusted annual hospitalization rate declined from 22.5% in 2007–2008 to 17.3% (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] 0.77; 95% CI 0.68, 0.86) in 2015–2016. In the same periods, among ED visits without advanced imaging, adjusted annual hospitalization rate declined from 14.3% to 11.6% (aRR 0.81; 95% CI 0.73, 0.90). The aRRs between ED visits with and without advanced imaging were not significantly different. Conclusion From 2007–2016, ED visits with advanced imaging did not have a greater reduction in admission rate compared to those without advanced imaging. Our results suggest that increasing advanced imaging use likely had a limited role in the general decline in hospital admissions from EDs. Future research is needed to further validate this finding."

The present experimental study manipulated three aspects of messaging in a WhatsApp chat as a form of SMC: synchronicity (immediate vs. time-lagged response), modality (with or without emojis), and valence (empathic accurate vs. empathic inaccurate response). The aim of this study was to investigate whether these three aspects had an impact on perceived social support, interpersonal trust, and personality attribution of the communication partner. The partial mediation of perceived social presence (the evaluation of the communication partner’s accessibility) and subjective social presence (the perception of being concordant with him/her) was also examined. Participants were 160 young adults, balanced in gender. They were randomly assigned to different the experimental conditions where they engaged in a manipulated WhatsApp chat with a fictitious same-gender communication partner. Post-questionnaire data were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling. Message valence (empathic accurate response) and modality (with emojis) significantly predicted higher levels of both forms of social presence. Synchronicity (immediate response) predicted higher levels of perceived but not subjective social presence. Social presence, in turn, was positively associated with social support, while subjective, but not perceived social presence, was positively associated with personality attribution. Neither perceived nor subjective social presence were related to interpersonal trust. Our results show that both what is said and how it is said impact the experience of interpersonal relations in SMC."

In this study, we used transient-state kinetics to examine the mechanistic basis for polymerase fidelity. We observe a wide range of efficiency for incorporation of various mismatched base pairs and have uncovered a mechanism in which the rate constant for pyrophosphate release is slowed for certain misincorporation events. This results in an increase in fidelity against these specific misincorporations. Furthermore, we discover that some mismatches are highly unfavorable and cannot be observed under the conditions used here.

The N-glycosylation consensus, Asn-X-Ser/Thr (where X is not Pro), is the sequon, and the N-oligosaccharide chain attached to a protein is the N-glycan.

The amounts of FNGs generated by OST can be measured using a png1Δams1Δ double-knockout strain, by suppressing the generation of the cytosol-originated FNGs (8Harada Y. Buser R. Ngwa E.M. Hirayama H.

In contrast, most of the FNGs in the ER and the cytosol are attributed to the hydrolytic activity of OST in the ER lumen in mammalian cells (11Harada Y. Masahara-Negishi Y. Suzuki T. Cytosolic-free oligosaccharides are predominantly generated by the degradation of dolichol-linked oligosaccharides in mammalian cells.Glycobiology. 2015; 25 (26206502): 1196-120510.1093/glycob/cwv055Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The yeast OST enzyme is a membrane-embedded protein complex consisting of eight membrane-protein subunits in an equimolar ratio. Stt3, Wbp1, Swp1, Ost1, and Ost2 are essential gene products, whereas Ost3/Ost6, Ost4, and Ost5 are nonessential gene products (5Kohda D. Structural basis of protein Asn-glycosylation by oligosaccharyltransferases.Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2018; 1104 (30484249): 171-19910.1007/978-981-13-2158-0_9Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The Stt3 subunit has the catalytic site. In general, eukaryotic genomes encode multiple paralogous stt3 genes (12Kelleher D.J. Karaoglu D. Mandon E.C. Gilmore R. Oligosaccharyltransferase isoforms that contain different catalytic STT3 subunits have distinct enzymatic properties.Mol.

The homologous Stt3 proteins expressed from these paralogous genes generate different OST complexes. Except for Caenorhabditis species, the genomes from all sequenced metazoan organisms contain two STT3 genes (STT3A and STT3B). Plant genomes also encode two copies of STT3 genes (STT3A and STT3B) (13Niu G. Shao Z. Liu C. Chen T. Jiao Q. Hong Z. Comparative and evolutionary analyses of the divergence of plant oligosaccharyltransferase STT3 isoforms.FEBS Open Bio. 2020; 10 (32011067): 468-48310.1002/2211-5463.12804Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In the phylum Protista, for example, the Leishmania major genome contains four stt3 genes, stt3A, stt3B, stt3C, and stt3D (14Nasab F.P. Schulz B.L. Gamarro F. Parodi A.J. Aebi M. All in one: Leishmania major STT3 proteins substitute for the whole oligosaccharyltransferase complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Biol.

Despite their similar names, the human, plant, and protist genes lack direct orthologous relationships (13Niu G. Shao Z. Liu C. Chen T. Jiao Q. Hong Z. Comparative and evolutionary analyses of the divergence of plant oligosaccharyltransferase STT3 isoforms.FEBS Open Bio. 2020; 10 (32011067): 468-48310.1002/2211-5463.12804Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 15Kelleher D.J.

One important exception is fungi, including S. cerevisiae, with genomes encoding a single stt3 gene. The human STT3B protein sequence is more similar to the yeast Stt3 protein sequence, suggesting that the human STT3A is a newcomer in evolution and the human STT3B is orthologous to the yeast Stt3 (15Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. An evolving view of the eukaryotic oligosaccharyltransferase.Glycobiology. 2006; 16 (16317064): 47R-46210.1093/glycob/cwj066Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). In place of the single Stt3, the yeast genome encodes the two paralogous ost3 and ost6 genes, which generate two different OST forms containing either Ost3 or Ost6 (16Schwarz M. Knauer R. Lehle L. Yeast oligosaccharyltransferase consists of two functionally distinct sub-complexes, specified by either the Ost3p or Ost6p subunit.FEBS Lett. 2005; 579 (16297388): 6564-656810.1016/j.febslet.2005.10.063Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The ratio of the Ost3-containing to Ost6-containing OST complexes is 4:1 (8Harada Y. Buser R. Ngwa E.M. Hirayama H. Aebi M. Suzuki T. Eukaryotic oligosaccharyltransferase generates free oligosaccharides during N-glycosylation.J. Biol.

Single deletions of either Ost3 or Ost6 resulted in moderate underglycosylation of proteins, and the Ost3 and Ost6 double knockout led to severe underglycosylation in yeast cells (17Knauer R. Lehle L. The oligosaccharyltransferase complex from Saccharomyces cerevisiae: isolation of the OST6 gene, its synthetic interaction with OST3, and analysis of the native complex.J. Biol.

The Ost3 and Ost6 proteins have a thioredoxin fold in the N-terminal soluble domain, and the oxidoreductase activity was considered to suppress disulfide bond formation during the oligosaccharyl transfer reaction (18Poljak K.

However, the N-glycosylation status was only affected to a limited extent by the disruption of the CXXC motifs in the Ost3 and Ost6 subunits, suggesting the importance of noncovalent interactions (19Schulz B.L. Stirnimann C.U. Grimshaw J.P.A. Brozzo M.S. Fritsch F. Mohorko E. Capitani G. Glockshuber R. Grütter M.G. Aebi M.

In vivo mutagenesis studies of the individual subunits of yeast OST have been performed using the spotting plate assay. Switching from the WT OST to the mutated OST in cells is accomplished by the plasmid-shuffling method (20Li G. Yan Q. Nita-Lazar A. Haltiwanger R.S. Lennarz W.J. Studies on the N-glycosylation of the subunits of oligosaccharyl transferase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol.

Otto C. Routier F.H. Lehle L. The yeast oligosaccharyltransferase complex can be replaced by STT3 from Leishmania major.Glycobiology. 2009; 19 (18955371): 160-17110.1093/glycob/cwn118Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The spotting plate assay is quite easy to execute, but its outcome is rather limited: a mutation is just classified into lethal, temperature-sensitive, or normal (i.e. nonconditional) growth phenotypes. Moreover, the different properties of the two OST complexes containing Ost3 or Ost6 in vivo could complicate the interpretation of the results obtained by the spotting plate assays. In some situations, enzymological studies using purified proteins with a defined subunit composition are preferred. However, the reconstitution of the OST complex in vitro using recombinant proteins has not been successful. Fortunately, the genetic manipulation of the yeast genome is straightforward. Previously, the 3×HA (hemagglutinin) epitope tag–encoding sequence was inserted at the 3′-ends of the stt3 and ost3 genes in the yeast genome, for immunopurification of the OST complexes and immunodetection of other subunits (20Li G.

Subsequently, other types of epitope tag sequences (FLAG, 3×FLAG, and 1D4) were incorporated into the 3′-end of the ost4 gene in the yeast genome, and the tagged OST complexes were affinity-purified to homogeneity for enzymatic investigation (8Harada Y.

In the case of conditional mutations, the isolation of OST complexes containing such mutant proteins is possible, provided that the yeast strain can grow under permissive conditions. Yeast strains carrying the stt3-4 and stt3-6 (G520D), stt3-5 (G520S), and stt3-7 (S552P) alleles have temperature-sensitive phenotypes (24Spirig U. Glavas M. Bodmer D. Reiss G. Burda P. Lippuner V.

Genet. 1997; 256 (9435788): 628-63710.1007/s004380050611Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These strains were grown at the permissive temperature of 23 °C, and the membrane fractions were prepared. In the membrane fractions, the OST complexes with these mutants showed very low oligosaccharyl transfer activities (24Spirig U. Glavas M. Bodmer D. Reiss G. Burda P. Lippuner V. Te Heesen S. Aebi M. The STT3 protein is a component of the yeast oligosaccharyltransferase complex.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 256 (9435788): 628-63710.1007/s004380050611Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast, the introduction of lethal or very severe temperature-sensitive mutations into the Stt3 subunit is rather difficult, as the co-expression of the WT Stt3 subunit is necessary for cell culture. We must confirm that the OST preparation with the mutated Stt3 subunit is not contaminated with the native OST complex containing the WT Stt3 subunit. In this study, we fused a new epitope tag to the 5′-end of the mutated stt3 genes in expression plasmids. The epitope tag has a high affinity to a specific antibody (28Fujii Y. Kaneko M. Neyazaki M. Nogi T. Kato Y. Takagi J. PA tag: a versatile protein tagging system using a super high affinity antibody against a dodecapeptide derived from human podoplanin.Protein Expr.

In addition, the use of host yeast strains expressing either Ost3 or Ost6 permits the purification of the OST complexes with a defined subunit composition. We measured the oligosaccharyl transfer activity and the hydrolytic activity of LLO in vitro, using the Ost3-containing OST complexes carrying mutations in the catalytic Stt3 subunit. In parallel, we determined the N-glycosylation status of the glycoproteins and the amounts of FNGs generated by OST in yeast strains harboring the same stt3 mutations. These detailed comparisons of the two activities of a series of mutations provided new insights into the N-glycosylation reactions in vitro and in living yeast cells. The PA epitope tag sequence was inserted into the region encoding the N terminus of the Stt3 subunit via a 10-residue spacer sequence (Fig. 1A). The tagged Stt3 protein was expressed under the control of the constitutive glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) promoter from the expression plasmid, pPA-STT3. An Ost6-knockout strain (ost6Δ) was used as the host to prepare the Ost3-containing OST complex (referred to as OST[Ost3]). Deleterious effects caused by the absence of Ost6 were compensated by the extra expression of Ost3 from the pOST3 plasmid (27Wild R. Kowal J. Eyring J. Ngwa E.M. Aebi M. Locher K.P.

These two short motifs are located close to the bound peptide substrate in the three-dimensional structure and involved in the recognition of the amino acid residues in or close to the sequon (Fig. 2). Glu45 is the first acidic residue of the DXD motif and is positioned to interact with the residue at position −1 of the sequon (27Wild R. Kowal J. Eyring J. Ngwa E.M. Aebi M. Locher K.P.

The E45K, D47A, and D583A mutations were lethal in the spotting plate assay (Fig. S1). The OST complexes containing Ost3 and the PA-tagged Stt3 subunit with a mutation (OST[Ost3, PA-Stt3(X)], where X denotes a mutation) were affinity-purified from digitonin-solubilized microsomal fractions and subjected to SDS-PAGE and CBB staining (Fig. 1B). No bands were present in the sample from the yeast cells transformed with the empty plasmid, indicating the absence of the native OST complex without the PA tag in the purified samples. The Wbp1 subunit contains two potential N-glycosylation sites. The total amount of Wbp1 was used to estimate the relative amounts of the mutation-bearing OST complexes to the WT OST complex with the PA tag (Fig. 1B). The quantification of the other subunits is less useful, due to diffused, adjacent, or high-mobility bands. The protein yields were variable, but not lower than 30% of the WT OST with the PA tag (Fig. 1C). Finally, we checked the incorporation of the WT Stt3 protein expressed from the chromosome into the OST preparations, considering the oligomeric interactions between the OST molecules. We created a yeast strain carrying an stt3 gene with a FLAG epitope tag–encoding sequence in the chromosome. The immunoprecipitated materials with the anti-FLAG antibody (FLAG-IP) and those with the anti-PA antibody (PA-IP) were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 1D). As a positive control experiment, the FLAG-IP sample was analyzed with the anti-FLAG antibody, indicating the presence of a single band (Fig. 1D, lane 1). In contrast, the PA-IP sample contained no detectable bands with the anti-FLAG antibody (lane 2), even though much larger amounts of the OST complex protein were loaded to the lanes of PA-IP (lanes 2 and 4) than those of FLAG-IP (lanes 1 and 3). We concluded that the genome-derived Stt3 was virtually absent in the OST preparations purified with the PA epitope tag. The oligosaccharyl transfer activities of the purified OST complexes were measured with LLO prepared from yeast cells as the oligosaccharide donor and various peptides containing the sequon Asn-Val-Thr as the oligosaccharide acceptor. The glycopeptide products were separated by normal-phase UPLC and quantified with in-line fluorescence detection of the carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) dye attached to the peptide substrates. We designed four peptide substrates for the selection of a peptide substrate suitable for the oligosaccharyl transfer assay (Table 1). Kinetic parameters were determined using the OST[Ost3, PA-Stt3(WT)] complex. There were few differences in the maximal velocity (Vm), whereas considerable variations in the Km were observed (Table 2 and Fig. S2). The 15-residue peptide substrate, tam-NVT15, had the smallest Km value, indicating the highest affinity for the OST[Ost3] enzyme.Table 1Substrate peptides used in this studyPeptide nameAmino acid sequenceaThe N-glycosylation sequon is underlined.

https://openalex.org/W3087136915,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Hypertension increases kidney stress, which deteriorates function, and leads to peripheral renal vascular resistance. Long-term hypoperfusion promotes interstitial fibrosis and glomerular sclerosis, resulting in nephrosclerosis. Although hypertension and DN are frequent ESRD complications, relevant animal models remain unavailable. We generated a deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive uni-nephrectomized (UNx) KKAy mouse model demonstrating hypertension, hyperglycemia, cardiac hypertrophy, kidney failure, increased urinary albumin creatinine ratio (UACR), and increased renal PDE4D and cardiac PDE5A mRNA levels. We hypothesized that the novel PDE4 selective inhibitor, compound A, and PDE5 inhibitor, sildenafil, exhibit nephroprotective, and cardioprotective effects in this new model. Compound A, sildenafil, and the angiotensin II receptor blocker, irbesartan, significantly reduced ventricular hypertrophy and pleural effusion volume. Meanwhile, compound A and sildenafil significantly suppressed the UACR, urinary kidney injury molecule-1, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels, as well as that of renal pro-fibrotic marker mRNAs, including collagen 1A1, fibronectin, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β). Moreover, compound A significantly suppressed TGF-β-induced pro-fibrotic mRNA expression in vitro in all major kidney lesions, including within the glomerular mesangial region, podocytes, and epithelial region. Hence, PDE4 and PDE5 inhibitors may be promising treatments, in combination with irbesartan, for DN with hypertension as they demonstrate complementary mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3087732164,"Background Recent studies have found that muscle depletion may be a prognostic predictor in patients with pancreatic cancer (PC). However, in these studies, limited data were used to assess the relationship between the serial change in body composition and outcomes after PC resection. Hence, we evaluated the changes in body composition during the perioperative period in patients with PC and their association with the overall survival (OS). Methods A total of 89 patients with PC who received surgery with curative intent between 2006 and 2015 were included in this study retrospectively. These patients underwent serial computed tomography (CT) scans: preoperatively, immediately after surgery (4 weeks), and 12 and 24 weeks after resection. The muscle and visceral fat areas were measured at the third lumbar vertebra level on cross-sectional CT images using sliceOmatic V5.0 program (TomoVision, Canada). The body composition ratio was determined by dividing the post-resection body composition at each point (4, 12, and 24 weeks) by the pre-resection body composition. Patients were divided into two groups—higher and lower groups—based on this body composition ratio (skeletal muscle mass ratio [SMR], visceral fat mass ratio [VFR]). The OS was compared between the two groups using the log-rank test. Results The median age of patients was 63 (27–84) years, and the baseline body mass index was 23.0 (17.0–35.8) kg/m2. In the comparison of the SMR, there was no significant difference in the OS between the two groups at 4 and 12 weeks (4 weeks, P = 0.488; 12 weeks, P = 0.397). However, the higher group showed a longer OS than the lower group at 24 weeks (39 vs. 20 months, P = 0.008). Similarly, in the VFR, there was no significant difference in the OS between the two groups at 4 and 12 weeks (4 weeks, P = 0.732; 12 weeks, P = 0.060). However, the OS was longer in the higher group at 24 weeks (35 vs. 22 months, P = 0.023). When we analyzed the effect of muscle restoration at 24 weeks after resection on the OS by gender, there was no significant difference between the OS and SMR in the male group (P = 0.213), but a significant difference was noted in the female group (P = 0.002). In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, the SMR at 24 weeks after resection was significantly associated with the OS (P = 0.023) but not VFR at 24 weeks. In 69 patients without recurrence at 6 months, the SMR at 24 weeks was related to longer OS but without statistical significance (P = 0.07). Conclusions This study suggests that the restoration of muscle mass at 24 weeks after resection may be an independent prognostic factor for survival in patients with resected PC."

Programmatic theories assume that when prospective migrants are equipped with information about risks, they will make more-informed choices, ultimately resulting in safe migration. In 2016, India was estimated to have 8 million people in modern slavery, including those who migrate internally for work. Work in Freedom (WiF) was a community-based trafficking prevention intervention. This study evaluated WiF’s pre-migration knowledge-building activities for female migrants in Odisha to prevent future labour-related exploitation. Methods Pre- and post- training questionnaires were administered to women (N = 347) who participated in a two-day pre-migration training session. Descriptive analysis and unadjusted analyses (paired t-tests, McNemar’s tests, Wilcoxon signed ranks tests) examined differences in women’s knowledge scores before and after training. Adjusted analyses used mixed effects models to explore whether receiving information on workers’ rights or working away from home prior to the training was associated with changes in scores. Additionally, we used data from a household survey (N = 4,671) and survey of female migrants (N = 112) from a population sample in the same district to evaluate the intervention’s rationale and implementation strategy. Results Female participants were on average 37.3 years-old (SD 11) and most (67.9%) had no formal education. Only 11 participants (3.2%) had previous migration experience. Most participants (90.5%) had previously received information or advice on workers’ rights or working away from home. Compared to female migrants in the population, training participants were different in age, caste and religion. Awareness about migration risks, rights and collective bargaining was very low initially and remained low post-training, e.g. of 13 possible migration risks, before the training, participants named an average of 1.2 risks, which increased only slightly to 2.1 risks after the training (T(346) = -11.64, p<0.001). Changes were modest for attitudes about safe and risky migration practices, earnings and savings. Before the training, only 34 women (10.4%) considered migrating, which reduced to 25 women (7.7%) post-training (X2 = 1.88, p = 0.169)—consistent with the low prevalence (7% of households) of female migration locally. Women’s attitudes remained relatively fixed about the shame associated with paid domestic work. Survey data indicated focusing on domestic work did not correspond to regional migration trends, where women migrate primarily for construction or agriculture work. Conclusion The apparent low effectiveness of the WiF short-duration migration training may be linked to the assumption that individual changes in knowledge will lead to shifts in social norms. The narrow focus on such individual-level interventions may overestimate an individual’s agency. Findings indicate the importance of intervention development research to ensure activities are conducted in the right locations, target the right populations, and have relevant content. Absent intervention development research, this intervention suffered from operating in a site that had very few migrant women and a very small proportion migrating for domestic work—the focus of the training. To promote better development investments, interventions should be informed by local evidence and subjected to rigorous theory-based evaluation to ensure interventions achieve the most robust design to foster safe labour migration for women."
https://openalex.org/W3087597616,"The mitotic kinase Aurora B regulates the condensation of chromatin into chromosomes by phosphorylating chromatin proteins during early mitosis, whereas the phosphatase PP1γ performs the opposite function. The roles of Aurora B and PP1γ must be tightly coordinated to maintain chromosomes at a high phosphorylation state, but the precise mechanisms regulating their function remain largely unclear. Here, mainly through immunofluorescence microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we find that dissociation of PP1γ from chromosomes is essential for maintaining chromosome phosphorylation. We uncover that PP1γ is recruited to mitotic chromosomes by its regulatory subunit Repo-Man in the absence of Aurora B activity and that Aurora B regulates dissociation of PP1γ by phosphorylating and disrupting PP1γ-Repo-Man interactions on chromatin. Overexpression of Repo-Man mutants that cannot be phosphorylated or inhibition of Aurora B kinase activity resulted in the retention of PP1γ on chromatin and prolonged the chromatin condensation process; a similar outcome was caused by the ectopic targeting of PP1γ to chromatin. Together, our findings reveal a novel regulation mechanism of chromatin condensation in which Aurora B counteracts PP1γ activity by releasing PP1γ from Repo-Man and may have important implications for understanding the regulations of dynamic structural changes of the chromosomes in mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W3087713357,"Studies on evoked responses in Parkinson's disease (PD) may be useful for elucidating the etiology and quantitative evaluation of PD. However, in previous studies, the association between evoked responses and detailed motor symptoms or cognitive functions has not been clear. This study investigated the characteristics of the visual (VEF), auditory (AEF), and somatosensory (SEF) evoked magnetic fields in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and the correlations between evoked fields and the patient's clinical characteristics, motor symptoms, and cognitive functions. Twenty patients with PD and 10 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited as participants. We recorded VEF, AEF, and SEF, collected clinical characteristics, performed physical examinations, and administered 10 cognitive tests. We investigated differences in the latencies of the evoked fields between patients with PD and HCs. We also evaluated the correlation of the latencies with motor symptoms and cognitive functioning. There were significant differences between the two groups in 6 of the cognitive tests, all of which suggested mild cognitive impairment in patients with PD. The latencies of the VEF N75m, P100m, N145m, AEF P50m, P100m, and SEF P60m components were greater in the patients with PD than in the HCs. The latencies mainly correlated with medication and motor symptoms, less so with cognitive tests, with some elements of the correlations remaining significant after Bonferroni correction. In conclusion, the latencies of the VEF, AEF, and SEF were greater in PD patients than in HCs and were mainly correlated with medication and motor symptoms rather than cognitive functioning. Findings from this study suggest that evoked fields may reflect basal ganglia functioning and are candidates for assessing motor symptoms or the therapeutic effects of medication in patients with PD."

In an experimental study, we analyse behaviour in such a team contest when allowing to punish or to reward other team members. Moreover, we compare two types of contest environment: One in which two teams compete for a prize and another one in which we switch off the between-group element of the contest. We find that reward giving, as opposed to punishing, induces higher contributions to the team contest. Furthermore, expenditures on rewarding other co-players are significantly higher than those for punishing."
https://openalex.org/W3087257985,"In a between-subject comparison of two memantine administration schedules we observed that treatment with the NMDA receptor antagonist memantine before testing sessions reduced ingestion of a 10% sucrose solution in rats, due to reduced licking burst size, thus suggesting a blunted hedonic response. Conversely, daily post-session administration reduced burst number, indicating a reduced level of behavioural activation, likely due to the development of conditioned taste aversion (CTA). In this study, the effect of pre-session and post-session memantine administration was investigated within-subjects. Memantine was administered in daily intraperitoneal injections for 13 days, on alternate days, either 1-h before-""before testing"" sessions-or immediately after a 30-min session-""after testing"" sessions. The effects on the microstructure of licking for a 10% sucrose solution were examined in the course of treatment and for 21 days after treatment discontinuation. The results show reduced burst size in the ""before testing"" sessions, without effects on the intra-burst lick rate, an index of motoric effects. Moreover, burst number was reduced since the third session of both administration conditions until the end of treatment. Interestingly, the effect of memantine of reducing the activation of ingestive behaviour was less pronounced in this study with respect to that observed with the previous study post-session administration schedule, in spite of the longer treatment. This apparent paradox might be explained if one considers these effects as instances of a memory-related effect, such as the development of CTA. In the framework of this hypothesis, the ""before testing"" sessions, not being followed by memantine administration, can be considered as extinction sessions performed every other day. Moreover, the animals treated with memantine at the highest dose failed to recover to pre-treatment ingestion levels 21 days after treatment discontinuation, while the animals treated after testing sessions in the previously published study showed a complete recovery well before the 15th day test. Within the same interpretative framework, this might depend by the reduced number and frequency of the extinction trials-i.e. the number of the sessions run after treatment discontinuation-in the present study. These results provide further support to the conclusion that memantine administration before sessions reduce burst size, an effect which is likely due to blockade of NMDA receptors occurring during behavioural testing. The observation that this effect can be obtained even in absence of a reduced intra-burst lick rate, which rules out the involvement of motor impairment, provides an important piece of evidence in support to the interpretation of this effect as a blunted hedonic response. Moreover, these results provide further evidence that burst number reduction is due to a memory-related effect induced by memantine administration after sessions."
https://openalex.org/W3087072015,"Introduction Sub-Saharan Africa houses over two-thirds of the 37 million people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) globally and of this, 5–20% are co-infected with Hepatitis B virus (HBV). This is double jeopardy, especially for women of reproductive age in these settings, who can transmit both viruses vertically as well as horizontally to their children. The objectives of this study were to investigate the prevalence and determinants of HBV among women of reproductive age living with HIV. Methods This was a cross-sectional study of HIV-infected women of reproductive age in Benue State, Nigeria. Participants were eligible for the study if they were HIV-infected women (ages 18–45 years) receiving care from any of the selected study sites. A global rapid hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) antibody test strip was used to test for HBsAg in plasma. A pretested questionnaire was used to collect data on sociodemographic, clinical and lifestyle characteristics of participants. We estimated prevalence of HBV infection and used multivariable logistic regression to determine factors associated with the infection at a significance level of <0.05. Results A total of 6577 women were screened for HBsAg. The prevalence of HBV was 10.3% (95% CI: 9.5–10.9%). Age, parity and male partner’s HIV status were found to be associated with having HBV infection. Compared to women older than 40 years, the odds of HBV infection increased significantly with increasing age until age 35 years and decreased significantly with increasing parity (versus no parity). Women with HIV-infected partners and those without a partner had higher odds of HBV infection compared to women with HIV-negative partners. Conclusion HBV is hyperendemic among HIV-infected women of reproductive age in North Central Nigeria. Specific programs targeting HBV testing, vaccination and treatment of all women of reproductive age need to be developed in this resource-limited, high-need setting."
