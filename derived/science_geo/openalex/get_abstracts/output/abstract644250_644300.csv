https://openalex.org/W2994938720,"Tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes are associated with a survival benefit in several tumour types and with the response to immunotherapy1–8. However, the reason some tumours have high CD8 T cell infiltration while others do not remains unclear. Here we investigate the requirements for maintaining a CD8 T cell response against human cancer. We find that CD8 T cells within tumours consist of distinct populations of terminally differentiated and stem-like cells. On proliferation, stem-like CD8 T cells give rise to more terminally differentiated, effector-molecule-expressing daughter cells. For many T cells to infiltrate the tumour, it is critical that this effector differentiation process occur. In addition, we show that these stem-like T cells reside in dense antigen-presenting-cell niches within the tumour, and that tumours that fail to form these structures are not extensively infiltrated by T cells. Patients with progressive disease lack these immune niches, suggesting that niche breakdown may be a key mechanism of immune escape. The authors examine the immune cell infiltrates of human tumours and provide evidence for a population of CD8 T cells with stem-cell characteristics and proliferative capacity that reside in an antigen-presenting niche within tumours."
https://openalex.org/W2992843173,"Limiting the increase of CO2 in the atmosphere is one of the largest challenges of our generation1. Because carbon capture and storage is one of the few viable technologies that can mitigate current CO2 emissions2, much effort is focused on developing solid adsorbents that can efficiently capture CO2 from flue gases emitted from anthropogenic sources3. One class of materials that has attracted considerable interest in this context is metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), in which the careful combination of organic ligands with metal-ion nodes can, in principle, give rise to innumerable structurally and chemically distinct nanoporous MOFs. However, many MOFs that are optimized for the separation of CO2 from nitrogen4-7 do not perform well when using realistic flue gas that contains water, because water competes with CO2 for the same adsorption sites and thereby causes the materials to lose their selectivity. Although flue gases can be dried, this renders the capture process prohibitively expensive8,9. Here we show that data mining of a computational screening library of over 300,000 MOFs can identify different classes of strong CO2-binding sites-which we term 'adsorbaphores'-that endow MOFs with CO2/N2 selectivity that persists in wet flue gases. We subsequently synthesized two water-stable MOFs containing the most hydrophobic adsorbaphore, and found that their carbon-capture performance is not affected by water and outperforms that of some commercial materials. Testing the performance of these MOFs in an industrial setting and consideration of the full capture process-including the targeted CO2 sink, such as geological storage or serving as a carbon source for the chemical industry-will be necessary to identify the optimal separation material."

https://openalex.org/W2992957227,"Formation of the three primary germ layers during gastrulation is an essential step in the establishment of the vertebrate body plan and is associated with major transcriptional changes1-5. Global epigenetic reprogramming accompanies these changes6-8, but the role of the epigenome in regulating early cell-fate choice remains unresolved, and the coordination between different molecular layers is unclear. Here we describe a single-cell multi-omics map of chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation and RNA expression during the onset of gastrulation in mouse embryos. The initial exit from pluripotency coincides with the establishment of a global repressive epigenetic landscape, followed by the emergence of lineage-specific epigenetic patterns during gastrulation. Notably, cells committed to mesoderm and endoderm undergo widespread coordinated epigenetic rearrangements at enhancer marks, driven by ten-eleven translocation (TET)-mediated demethylation and a concomitant increase of accessibility. By contrast, the methylation and accessibility landscape of ectodermal cells is already established in the early epiblast. Hence, regulatory elements associated with each germ layer are either epigenetically primed or remodelled before cell-fate decisions, providing the molecular framework for a hierarchical emergence of the primary germ layers."
https://openalex.org/W2996644149,"Adoptive cell therapy represents a new paradigm in cancer immunotherapy, but it can be limited by the poor persistence and function of transferred T cells1. Here we use an in vivo pooled CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis screening approach to demonstrate that, by targeting REGNASE-1, CD8+ T cells are reprogrammed to long-lived effector cells with extensive accumulation, better persistence and robust effector function in tumours. REGNASE-1-deficient CD8+ T cells show markedly improved therapeutic efficacy against mouse models of melanoma and leukaemia. By using a secondary genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screening, we identify BATF as the key target of REGNASE-1 and as a rheostat that shapes antitumour responses. Loss of BATF suppresses the increased accumulation and mitochondrial fitness of REGNASE-1-deficient CD8+ T cells. By contrast, the targeting of additional signalling factors-including PTPN2 and SOCS1-improves the therapeutic efficacy of REGNASE-1-deficient CD8+ T cells. Our findings suggest that T cell persistence and effector function can be coordinated in tumour immunity and point to avenues for improving the efficacy of adoptive cell therapy for cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2995000440,"RIPK1 is a key regulator of innate immune signalling pathways. To ensure an optimal inflammatory response, RIPK1 is regulated post-translationally by well-characterized ubiquitylation and phosphorylation events, as well as by caspase-8-mediated cleavage1-7. The physiological relevance of this cleavage event remains unclear, although it is thought to inhibit activation of RIPK3 and necroptosis8. Here we show that the heterozygous missense mutations D324N, D324H and D324Y prevent caspase cleavage of RIPK1 in humans and result in an early-onset periodic fever syndrome and severe intermittent lymphadenopathy-a condition we term 'cleavage-resistant RIPK1-induced autoinflammatory syndrome'. To define the mechanism for this disease, we generated a cleavage-resistant Ripk1D325A mutant mouse strain. Whereas Ripk1-/- mice died postnatally from systemic inflammation, Ripk1D325A/D325A mice died during embryogenesis. Embryonic lethality was completely prevented by the combined loss of Casp8 and Ripk3, but not by loss of Ripk3 or Mlkl alone. Loss of RIPK1 kinase activity also prevented Ripk1D325A/D325A embryonic lethality, although the mice died before weaning from multi-organ inflammation in a RIPK3-dependent manner. Consistently, Ripk1D325A/D325A and Ripk1D325A/+ cells were hypersensitive to RIPK3-dependent TNF-induced apoptosis and necroptosis. Heterozygous Ripk1D325A/+ mice were viable and grossly normal, but were hyper-responsive to inflammatory stimuli in vivo. Our results demonstrate the importance of caspase-mediated RIPK1 cleavage during embryonic development and show that caspase cleavage of RIPK1 not only inhibits necroptosis but also maintains inflammatory homeostasis throughout life."

https://openalex.org/W2994883186,"The most frequently mutated oncogene in cancer is KRAS, which uses alternative fourth exons to generate two gene products (KRAS4A and KRAS4B) that differ only in their C-terminal membrane-targeting region1. Because oncogenic mutations occur in exons 2 or 3, two constitutively active KRAS proteins—each capable of transforming cells—are encoded when KRAS is activated by mutation2. No functional distinctions among the splice variants have so far been established. Oncogenic KRAS alters the metabolism of tumour cells3 in several ways, including increased glucose uptake and glycolysis even in the presence of abundant oxygen4 (the Warburg effect). Whereas these metabolic effects of oncogenic KRAS have been explained by transcriptional upregulation of glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes3–5, it is not known whether there is direct regulation of metabolic enzymes. Here we report a direct, GTP-dependent interaction between KRAS4A and hexokinase 1 (HK1) that alters the activity of the kinase, and thereby establish that HK1 is an effector of KRAS4A. This interaction is unique to KRAS4A because the palmitoylation–depalmitoylation cycle of this RAS isoform enables colocalization with HK1 on the outer mitochondrial membrane. The expression of KRAS4A in cancer may drive unique metabolic vulnerabilities that can be exploited therapeutically. KRAS4A interacts directly with hexokinase 1 in a GTP-dependent manner at the outer mitochondrial membrane, leading to kinase activation and an increase in glucose uptake and glycolysis in tumour cells."
https://openalex.org/W2995084623,"Oncogenic activation of RAS is associated with the acquisition of a unique set of metabolic dependencies that contribute to tumour cell fitness. Cells that express oncogenic RAS are able to internalize and degrade extracellular protein via a fluid-phase uptake mechanism termed macropinocytosis1. There is increasing recognition of the role of this RAS-dependent process in the generation of free amino acids that can be used to support tumour cell growth under nutrient-limiting conditions2. However, little is known about the molecular steps that mediate the induction of macropinocytosis by oncogenic RAS. Here we identify vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) as an essential regulator of RAS-induced macropinocytosis. Oncogenic RAS promotes the translocation of V-ATPase from intracellular membranes to the plasma membrane via a pathway that requires the activation of protein kinase A by a bicarbonate-dependent soluble adenylate cyclase. Accumulation of V-ATPase at the plasma membrane is necessary for the cholesterol-dependent plasma-membrane association of RAC1, a prerequisite for the stimulation of membrane ruffling and macropinocytosis. These observations establish a link between V-ATPase trafficking and nutrient supply by macropinocytosis that could be exploited to curtail the metabolic adaptation capacity of RAS-mutant tumour cells."
https://openalex.org/W3102050886,"The macroscopic electromagnetic boundary conditions, which have been established for over a century1, are essential for the understanding of photonics at macroscopic length scales. Even state-of-the-art nanoplasmonic studies2-4, exemplars of extremely interface-localized fields, rely on their validity. This classical description, however, neglects the intrinsic electronic length scales (of the order of ångström) associated with interfaces, leading to considerable discrepancies between classical predictions and experimental observations in systems with deeply nanoscale feature sizes, which are typically evident below about 10 to 20 nanometres5-10. The onset of these discrepancies has a mesoscopic character: it lies between the granular microscopic (electronic-scale) and continuous macroscopic (wavelength-scale) domains. Existing top-down phenomenological approaches deal only with individual aspects of these omissions, such as nonlocality11-13 and local-response spill-out14,15. Alternatively, bottom-up first-principles approaches-for example, time-dependent density functional theory16,17-are severely constrained by computational demands and thus become impractical for multiscale problems. Consequently, a general and unified framework for nanoscale electromagnetism remains absent. Here we introduce and experimentally demonstrate such a framework-amenable to both analytics and numerics, and applicable to multiscale problems-that reintroduces the electronic length scale via surface-response functions known as Feibelman d parameters18,19. We establish an experimental procedure to measure these complex dispersive surface-response functions, using quasi-normal-mode perturbation theory and observations of pronounced nonclassical effects. We observe nonclassical spectral shifts in excess of 30 per cent and the breakdown of Kreibig-like broadening in a quintessential multiscale architecture: film-coupled nanoresonators, with feature sizes comparable to both the wavelength and the electronic length scale. Our results provide a general framework for modelling and understanding nanoscale (that is, all relevant length scales above about 1 nanometre) electromagnetic phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W2996166713,"Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by transcriptional dysregulation that results in a block in differentiation and increased malignant self-renewal. Various epigenetic therapies aimed at reversing these hallmarks of AML have progressed into clinical trials, but most show only modest efficacy owing to an inability to effectively eradicate leukaemia stem cells (LSCs)1. Here, to specifically identify novel dependencies in LSCs, we screened a bespoke library of small hairpin RNAs that target chromatin regulators in a unique ex vivo mouse model of LSCs. We identify the MYST acetyltransferase HBO1 (also known as KAT7 or MYST2) and several known members of the HBO1 protein complex as critical regulators of LSC maintenance. Using CRISPR domain screening and quantitative mass spectrometry, we identified the histone acetyltransferase domain of HBO1 as being essential in the acetylation of histone H3 at K14. H3 acetylated at K14 (H3K14ac) facilitates the processivity of RNA polymerase II to maintain the high expression of key genes (including Hoxa9 and Hoxa10) that help to sustain the functional properties of LSCs. To leverage this dependency therapeutically, we developed a highly potent small-molecule inhibitor of HBO1 and demonstrate its mode of activity as a competitive analogue of acetyl-CoA. Inhibition of HBO1 phenocopied our genetic data and showed efficacy in a broad range of human cell lines and primary AML cells from patients. These biological, structural and chemical insights into a therapeutic target in AML will enable the clinical translation of these findings. The MYST acetyltransferase HBO1 is a critical regulator in maintaining leukaemia stem cells, and a small-molecule inhibitor of HBO1 is developed that shows efficacy against a range of acute myeloid leukaemia cells."

Neubert et al. observed a TGF from above, using instruments on the International Space Station. High-speed photometry in optical, ultraviolet, x-ray, and gamma-ray bands allowed them to determine the sequence of events that produced the TGF. Emission from an intracloud lightning leader was followed within a millisecond by the TGF. The subsequent lightning flash produced an electromagnetic pulse, which induced expanding waves of ultraviolet emission in the ionosphere above the thunderstorm, called an elve. The authors conclude that high electric fields produced within the lightning leader generated the TGF. Science , this issue p. 183"
https://openalex.org/W2996619590,"Biomonitoring programs have evolved beyond the sole use of morphological identification to determine the composition of invertebrate species assemblages in an array of ecosystems. The application of DNA metabarcoding in freshwater systems for assessing benthic invertebrate communities is now being employed to generate biological information for environmental monitoring and assessment. A possible shift from the extraction of DNA from net-collected bulk benthic samples to its extraction directly from water samples for metabarcoding has generated considerable interest based on the assumption that taxon detectability is comparable when using either method. To test this, we studied paired water and benthos samples from a taxon-rich wetland complex, to investigate differences in the detection of arthropod taxa from each sample type. We demonstrate that metabarcoding of DNA extracted directly from water samples is a poor surrogate for DNA extracted from bulk benthic samples, focusing on key bioindicator groups. Our results continue to support the use of bulk benthic samples as a basis for metabarcoding-based biomonitoring, with nearly three times greater total richness in benthic samples compared to water samples. We also demonstrated that few arthropod taxa are shared between collection methods, with a notable lack of key bioindicator EPTO taxa in the water samples. Although species coverage in water could likely be improved through increased sample replication and/or increased sequencing depth, benthic samples remain the most representative, cost-effective method of generating aquatic compositional information via metabarcoding."
https://openalex.org/W3005956383,"Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) drive extensive horizontal transfer in the gut microbiome. This transfer could benefit human health by conferring new metabolic capabilities to commensal microbes, or it could threaten human health by spreading antibiotic resistance genes to pathogens. Despite their biological importance and medical relevance, MGEs from the gut microbiome have not been systematically characterized. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of chromosomal MGEs in the gut microbiome using a method that enables the identification of the mobilizable unit of MGEs. We curated a database of 5,219 putative MGEs encompassing seven MGE classes called ImmeDB. We observed that many MGEs carry genes that could confer an adaptive advantage to the gut environment including gene families involved in antibiotic resistance, bile salt detoxification, mucus degradation, capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis, polysaccharide utilization, and sporulation. We find that antibiotic resistance genes are more likely to be spread by conjugation via integrative conjugative elements or integrative mobilizable elements than transduction via prophages. Horizontal transfer of MGEs is extensive within phyla but rare across phyla, supporting phylum level niche-adaptive gene pools in the gut microbiome. ImmeDB will be a valuable resource for future studies on the gut microbiome and MGE communities."
https://openalex.org/W2994617588,"Diabetes is a large healthcare burden worldwide. There is substantial evidence that lifestyle modifications and drug intervention can prevent diabetes, therefore, an early identification of high risk individuals is important to design targeted prevention strategies. In this paper, we present an automatic tool that uses machine learning techniques to predict the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Data generated from an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was used to develop a predictive model based on the support vector machine (SVM). We trained and validated the models using the OGTT and demographic data of 1,492 healthy individuals collected during the San Antonio Heart Study. This study collected plasma glucose and insulin concentrations before glucose intake and at three time-points thereafter (30, 60 and 120 min). Furthermore, personal information such as age, ethnicity and body-mass index was also a part of the data-set. Using 11 OGTT measurements, we have deduced 61 features, which are then assigned a rank and the top ten features are shortlisted using minimum redundancy maximum relevance feature selection algorithm. All possible combinations of the 10 best ranked features were used to generate SVM based prediction models. This research shows that an individual's plasma glucose levels, and the information derived therefrom have the strongest predictive performance for the future development of T2DM. Significantly, insulin and demographic features do not provide additional performance improvement for diabetes prediction. The results of this work identify the parsimonious clinical data needed to be collected for an efficient prediction of T2DM. Our approach shows an average accuracy of 96.80% and a sensitivity of 80.09% obtained on a holdout set."
https://openalex.org/W3006022441,"The auxin early response gene Gretchen Hagen3 (GH3) plays dual roles in plant development and responses to biotic or abiotic stress. It functions in regulating hormone homeostasis through the conjugation of free auxin to amino acids. In citrus, GH3.1 and GH3.1L play important roles in responding to Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (Xcc). Here, in Wanjingcheng orange (Citrus sinensis Osbeck), the overexpression of CsGH3.1 and CsGH3.1L caused increased branching and drooping dwarfism, as well as smaller, thinner and upward curling leaves compared with wild-type. Hormone determinations showed that overexpressing CsGH3.1 and CsGH3.1L decreased the free auxin contents and accelerated the Xcc-induced decline of free auxin levels in transgenic plants. A resistance analysis showed that transgenic plants had reduced susceptibility to citrus canker, and a transcriptomic analysis revealed that hormone signal transduction-related pathways were significantly affected by the overexpression of CsGH3.1 and CsGH3.1L. A MapMan analysis further showed that overexpressing either of these two genes significantly downregulated the expression levels of the annotated auxin/indole-3-acetic acid family genes and significantly upregulated biotic stress-related functions and pathways. Salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, abscisic acid, ethylene and zeatin levels in transgenic plants displayed obvious changes compared with wild-type. In particular, the salicylic acid and ethylene levels involved in plant resistance responses markedly increased in transgenic plants. Thus, the overexpression of CsGH3.1 and CsGH3.1L reduces plant susceptibility to citrus canker by repressing auxin signaling and enhancing defense responses. Our study demonstrates auxin homeostasis’ potential in engineering disease resistance in citrus."

https://openalex.org/W2996596704,"Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths for women, due mainly to metastatic disease. Invasive tumors exhibit aberrations in recruitment and activity of immune cells, including decreased cytotoxic T cells. Restoring the levels and activity of cytotoxic T cells is a promising anticancer strategy; but its success is tumor type dependent. The mechanisms that coordinate recruitment and activity of immune cells and other stromal cells in breast cancer remain poorly understood. Using the MMTV-PyVmT/FVB mammary tumor model, we demonstrate a novel role for CCL2/CCR2 chemokine signaling in tumor progression by altering the microenvironment. Selective targeting of CCR2 in the PyVmT mammary epithelium inhibited tumor growth and invasion, elevated CD8+ T cells, decreased M2 macrophages and decreased angiogenesis. Co-culture models demonstrated these stromal cell responses were mediated by tumor-derived CCL2 and CCR2-mediated suppression of the T-cell activating cytokine, CD154. Coculture analysis indicated that CCR2-induced stromal reactivity was important for tumor cell proliferation and invasion. In breast tumor tissues, CD154 expression inversely correlated with CCR2 expression and correlated with relapse free survival. Targeting the CCL2/CCR2 signaling pathway may reprogram the immune angiogenic and microenvironments and enhance effectiveness of targeted and immunotherapies."
https://openalex.org/W2995153492,"Schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease can be controlled with dopamine antagonists and agonists. In order to improve the understanding of the reaction mechanism of these drugs, in this investigation we present a quantum chemical study of 20 antagonists and 10 agonists. Electron donor acceptor capacity and global hardness are analyzed using Density Functional Theory calculations. Following this theoretical approach, we provide new insights into the intrinsic response of these chemical species. In summary, antagonists generally prove to be better electron acceptors and worse electron donors than dopamine, whereas agonists present an electron donor-acceptor capacity similar to that of dopamine. The chemical hardness is a descriptor that captures the resistance of a chemical compound to change its number of electrons. Within this model, harder molecules are less polarizable and more stable systems. Our results show that the global hardness is similar for dopamine and agonists whilst antagonists present smaller values. Following the Hard and Soft Acid and Bases principle, it is possible to conclude that dopamine and agonists are hard bases while antagonists are soft acids, and this can be related to their activity. From the electronic point of view, we have evolved a new perspective for the classification of agonist and antagonist, which may help to analyze future results of chemical interactions triggered by these drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2996654954,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the biological effects of roasted Cashew nuts consumption on biochemical and murinometric parameters in dyslipidemic rats receiving lipid supplementation. Young male rats were randomly assigned to three experimental groups (n = 10). The Control group (CONT) was treated with water, the Dyslipidemic group (DL) received a high fat content emulsion throughout the experiment, and the Dyslipidemic Cashew Nuts group (DLCN) received the same high fat content emulsion throughout the experiment, yet was treated with Cashew nuts. Body parameters, biochemical, hepatic and fecal fatty acid profiles were all evaluated. The levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides were higher in the DL and DLCN groups as compared to the control group. DLCN and CONT presented no difference in HDL levels. DLCN presented higher glycemia levels than the other groups. There was reduction of body fat in DLCN as compared to other groups, but with higher accumulations of liver fat. DLCN presented a reduction in saturated hepatic fatty acids of 20.8%, and an increase of 177% in relation to CONT; there was also a 21% in increase DL for ω9 fatty acids in comparison to CONT. As for fecal fatty acids, there was a lower concentration of polysaturates in DLCN as compared to the other groups. The data showed that the consumption of Cashew nuts by the dyslipidemic animals treated with a hyperlipidic diet induced greater accumulations of liver fat and worsened glycemic levels, despite having reduced visceral fats and increased fecal fat excretion."
https://openalex.org/W3013956273,"Sleep-mediated overnight consolidation has been found to facilitate perceptual learning by promoting learners’ generalization across talkers in their perception of novel segmental categories. Lexical tone is characterized by high variability across talkers, and displays dynamic change over time. For this reason, it remains unclear whether a similar effect of overnight consolidation would be found for perceptual learning of novel tonal contrasts. Thus, this study aims to examine whether overnight consolidation facilitates talker-independent learning of lexical tones in the identification and discrimination of novel Cantonese level tones by Mandarin listeners. Two groups of Mandarin listeners were perceptually trained either in the morning or in the evening. Listeners were trained in a tone identification (ID) task with feedback using stimuli produced by a trained talker. Their post-training changes and generalization to a novel talker were then tested in the ID and AX discrimination tasks using stimuli produced by trained and untrained talkers in three posttests following training: immediately after training, 12-hour delay, and 24-hour delay. While the evening group slept between the first and second posttests, the morning group did not. The accuracy rates in the ID task showed that the evening group showed an improved trend, predicted by their individual sleep time, in identifying the level tones produced by both the trained and untrained talkers; in contrast, the morning group showed a declining trend. The d-prime scores in the AX discrimination task did not show different patterns between the two groups. The finding of sleep-related identification changes over time suggests that overnight consolidation might have facilitated tone learning of stimuli produced by the novel talker and eventually facilitated the formation of a more talker-independent representation of novel tone categories in long-term memory. The results are discussed in light of the features of lexical tones to shed light on the mechanism of phonetic learning."
https://openalex.org/W2996713006,"The reduction of masticatory load intensity resulting from dietary changes in human evolution has been proposed as an important factor that alters craniofacial shape in past and current populations. However, its impact on craniofacial variation and on the perceived differences among populations is unclear. The maxillomandibular relationship, which alters masticatory force direction, is a factor often neglected but it can contribute to variation in craniofacial morphology, particularly among modern/urban populations where the prevalence of dental malocclusions is greater than in prehistoric populations. This study investigates the influence of masticatory load intensity and maxillomandibular relationship as a proxy for force direction on the human craniofacial skeleton. By using 3D imaging and geometric morphometrics, we analyzed craniofacial shape variation among 186 individuals from pre-Hispanic and modern Chilean and Argentinean populations that differ in diet consistency (a proxy for masticatory load intensity) and maxillomandibular relationship. We predicted that masticatory load would have a subtle effect on the upper craniofacial bones and that this would be more marked in the maxilla. Our results showed no clear influence of masticatory load on craniofacial shape, particularly in modern/urban populations. Allometry, on the contrary, shows a stronger effect. The degree of integration between the upper craniofacial bones and the load-bearing maxilla depends on masticatory load intensity, decreasing from high to low but showing a conservative pattern of covariation among the groups. The degree of variation in the shape of the maxilla is greater than the upper craniofacial bones. These results suggest that masticatory load has a limited effect in determining differences in craniofacial morphology among populations. This effect is slightly greater for the maxillary region of the face. We propose that the reduction of functional constraints is key to greater shape variation found in modern/urban populations."

Within one time series experiment we tested the cycling in a natural, late stage cyanobacterial bloom by adding 13C bi-carbonate and 15N2, and performed sampling after 10 min, 30 min, 1 h, 6 h and 24 h in order to determine the fixing species as well as the fate of the fixed carbon and nitrogen in the associations. Uptake of 15N and 13C isotopes by the most abundant cyanobacterial species as well as the most abundant associated heterotrophic bacterial groups was then analysed by NanoSIMS. Overall, the filamentous, heterocystous species Dolichospermum sp., Nodularia sp., and Aphanizomenon sp. revealed no or erratic uptake of carbon and nitrogen, indicating mostly inactive cells. In contrary, non-heterocystous Pseudanabaena sp. dominated the nitrogen and carbon fixation, with uptake rates up to 1.49 ± 0.47 nmol N h-1 l-1 and 2.55 ± 0.91 nmol C h-1 l-1. Associated heterotrophic bacteria dominated the subsequent nitrogen remineralization with uptake rates up to 1.2 ± 1.93 fmol N h-1 cell -1, but were also indicative for fixation of di-nitrogen."

Yet, it is understood that both familial predisposition and early life adversity contribute to the development of BD. How the interplay between these two factors influence emotion and reward processing networks in youth at risk for BD remains unclear. In this exploratory analysis, offspring of BD parents performed emotion and reward processing tasks while undergoing a fMRI scan. Risk calculator score was used to assess risk for developing BD in the next 5 years. Environmental risk was tabulated using the Stressful Life Events Schedule (SLES). Emotion and reward processing networks were investigated for genetic and/or environment interactions. Interaction effects were found between risk calculator scores, negative SLES score and activity in right amygdala and bilateral fusiform gyri during the emotion processing task, as well as activity in the fronto-, striatal, and parietal regions during the reward processing task. Our findings are preliminary; however, they support the unique and interactive contributions of both familial and environmental risk factors on emotion and reward processing within OBP. They also identify potential neural targets to guide development of interventions for youth at greatest risk for psychiatric disorders."

Moreover, the paper discusses the estimates of the parameters by the usual maximum likelihood estimation method along with determining the information matrix. In addition, the potentiality of the proposed distribution is illustrated using two real data sets.

https://openalex.org/W2995782322,"The ability to control weight shifting (voluntary sway) is a crucial factor for stability during standing. Postural tracking of an oscillating visual target when standing on a compliant surface (e.g. foam) is a challenging weight shifting task that may alter the stability of the system and the muscle activation patterns needed to compensate for the perturbed state. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of surface stability and sway frequency on the muscle activation of the lower limb, during visually guided voluntary postural sway. Seventeen volunteers performed a 2-min voluntary sway task in the anterior-posterior direction following with their projected center of pressure (CoPAP) a periodically oscillating visual target on a screen. The target oscillated at a frequency of 0.25 Hz or 0.125 Hz, while the participants swayed on solid ground (stable surface) or on a foam pad (unstable surface), resulting in four experimental conditions. The electromyogram (EMG) of 13 lower limb muscles was measured and the target–CoPAP coupling was evaluated with coherence analysis, whereas the difference in the stability of the system between the conditions was estimated by the maximum Lyapunov exponent (MLE). The results showed that slower oscillations outperformed the faster in terms of coherence and revealed greater stability. On the other hand, unstable ground resulted in an undershooting of the CoPAP to the target and greater MLE. Regarding the EMG data, a decreased triceps surae muscle activation at the low sway frequency compared to the higher was observed, whereas swaying on foam induced higher activation on the tibialis anterior as well. It is concluded that swaying voluntarily on an unstable surface results in reduced CoPAP and joint kinematics stability, that is accomplished by increasing the activation of the distal leg muscles, in order to compensate for this perturbation. The reduction of the sway frequency limits the effect of the unstable surface, on the head and upper body, improves the temporal component of coherence between CoP and target, whereas EMG activity is decreased. These findings might have implications in rehabilitation programs."
https://openalex.org/W2995497196,"Background Metabolism in tumor shifts from oxidative phosphorylation to inefficient glycolysis resulting in overproduction of lactate (Warburg effect), and cancers may be effectively treated if this imbalance were corrected. The aim of this longitudinal study of glioblastoma in a rat model was to determine whether the ratio of lactate (surrogate marker for glycolysis) to bicarbonate (for oxidative phosphorylation), as measured via in vivo magnetic resonance imaging of hyperpolarized 13C-labeled pyruvate accurately predicts survival. Methods C6 Glioma implanted male Wistar rats (N = 26) were treated with an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody B20.4.1.1 in a preliminary study to assess the efficacy of the drug. In a subsequent longitudinal survival study, magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) was used to estimate [1-13C]Lactate and [1-13C]Bicarbonate in tumor and contralateral normal appearing brain of glioma implanted rats (N = 13) after injection of hyperpolarized [1-13C]Pyruvate at baseline and 48 hours post-treatment with B20.4.1.1. Results A survival of ~25% of B20.4.1.1 treated rats was noted in the preliminary study. In the longitudinal imaging experiment, changes in 13C Lactate, 13C Bicarbonate and tumor size measured at baseline and 48 hours post-treatment did not correlate with survival. 13C Lactate to 13C Bicarbonate ratio increased in all the 6 animals that succumbed to the tumor whereas the ratio decreased in 6 of the 7 animals that survived past the 70-day observation period. Conclusions 13C Lactate to 13C Bicarbonate ratio (Lac/Bic) at 48 hours post-treatment is highly predictive of survival (p = 0.003). These results suggest a potential role for the 13C Lac/Bic ratio serving as a valuable measure of tumor metabolism and predicting therapeutic response."
https://openalex.org/W2996182370,"Horse-chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum L.) is an endemic and relict species from the Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot and a popular ornamental tree. Knowledge about the evolutionary history of this species remains scarce. Here, we ask what historical and ecological factors shaped the pattern of genetic diversity and differentiation of this species. We genotyped 717 individuals from nine natural populations using microsatellite markers. The influence of distance, topography and habitat variables on spatial genetic structure was tested within the approaches of isolation-by-distance and isolation-by-ecology. Species niche modeling was used to project the species theoretical range through time and space. The species showed high genetic diversity and moderate differentiation for which topography, progressive range contraction through the species’ history and long-term persistence in stable climatic refugia are likely responsible. A strong geographic component was revealed among five genetic clusters that are connected with very limited gene flow. The environmental variables were a significant factor in the spatial genetic structure. Modeling results indicated that future reduction of the species range may affect its survival. The possible impact of climate changes and high need of in situ conservation are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2995783231,"Cryptococcus causes 15% of AIDS-related deaths and in South Africa, with its high HIV burden, is the dominant cause of adult meningitis. Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) mortality is high, partly because patients enter care with advanced HIV disease and because of failure of integrated care following CM diagnosis. We evaluated pathways to hospital care, missed opportunities for HIV testing and initiation of care.We performed a cross-sectional study at five public-sector urban hospitals. We enrolled adults admitted with a first or recurrent episode of cryptococcal meningitis. Study nurses conducted interviews, supplemented by a prospective review of medical charts and laboratory records.From May to October 2015, 102 participants were enrolled; median age was 40 years (interquartile range [IQR] 33.9-46.7) and 56 (55%) were male. In the six weeks prior to admission, 2/102 participants were asymptomatic, 72/100 participants sought care at a public-sector facility, 16/100 paid for private health care. The median time from seeking care to admission was 4 days (IQR, 0-27 days). Of 94 HIV-seropositive participants, only 62 (66%) knew their status and 41/62 (66%) had ever taken antiretroviral treatment. Among 13 participants with a known previous CM episode, none were taking fluconazole maintenance therapy. In-hospital management was mostly amphotericin B; in-hospital mortality was high (28/92, 30%). Sixty-four participants were discharged, 92% (59/64) on maintenance fluconazole, 4% (3/64) not on fluconazole and 3% (2/64) unknown. Twelve weeks post-discharge, 31/64 (48%) participants were lost to follow up. By 12 weeks post discharge 7/33 (21%) had died. Interviewed patients were asked if they were still on fluconazole, 11% (2/18) were not.Among hospitalised participants with CM, there were many missed opportunities for HIV care and linkage to ART prior to admission. Universal reflex CrAg screening may prompt earlier diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis but there is a wider problem of timely linkage to care for HIV-seropositive people."
https://openalex.org/W2996057671,"Nuts and seeds have been increasingly associated with recalls due to contamination with Listeria monocytogenes. Storage of these food commodities occurs at various relative humidity (RH) conditions for months or years. The objective of this study was to assess L. monocytogenes survival on four commodities representing dried legumes, seeds, and spices categories: chickpeas, sesame seeds, pine nuts, and black pepper kernels. Inoculated products at 10 log CFU/g were stored for 180 days (6 months) at 25°C and different relative humidity (RH) levels: 25% (low), 45% (ambient), and 75% (high). After 180 days at 25% RH, L. monocytogenes populations decreased to 2.67-6.59 log CFU/g; the highest survival of the pathogen was observed on pine nuts and sesame seeds with decay rates of -0.014± 0.001 log CFU/g per d. Significantly greater population reductions on all products were observed during storage at 45 and 75% RH. At 45% RH, L. monocytogenes levels decreased to 1.90-6.36 log CFU/g. On chickpeas and black pepper stored at 75% RH, the pathogen population decreased to below the limit of enumeration (1 log CFU/g) yet were still detected via enrichments. The lowest survival of L. monocytogenes occurred at 75% RH on black pepper with a decay rate of -0.058±0.003 log CFU/g per d. Overall, regardless of RH level, the ability of the products to support survival of the pathogen may be expressed in the following order: pine nuts > sesame seeds > chickpeas > black pepper. The results of this study can aid in understanding how L. monocytogenes survives on dried legumes, seeds, and spices, and the data can contribute to the risk assessment of this pathogen."

In traditional communities, they are commonly used in popular medicine for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory activity of Vernonia polysphaera Baker hydroalcoholic extract. A λ-carrageenan-induced paw edema and peritonitis model was established in BALB/c mice. The in vitro activity of the extract was measured on LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. There was no toxic effect on mice or on the cells treated with the extract. Animals treated with V. polysphaera extract demonstrated inhibition of paw edema in comparison with the untreated animals at all the analyzed doses. In peritonitis, treatment with the extract at a dose of 500 mg/kg resulted in a lower total leukocyte count in the peritoneal fluid and blood and lower levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and PGE-2 than the control group. Cells treated with 50 and 100 μg/mL of the extract exhibited lower levels of nitrite and pro-inflammatory cytokine production and lower COX-2, NF-κB expression. The V. polysphaera extract demonstrated an anti-inflammatory effect, interfering with cell migration, reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and COX-2 expression and consequent interference with PGE-2, as well as inhibiting NF-κB transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2994717868,"Several reports on patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) treated by peritoneal dialysis (PD) have shown a higher risk of PD-associated peritonitis compared to non-DM (NDM) patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of PD-associated peritonitis in DM patients.We divided all patients who received PD at a single center between January 1980 and December 2012 into three groups according to era: Period 1 (n = 43, 1980-1993); Period 2 (n = 123, 1994-2004); and Period 3 (n = 207, 2005-2012). We investigated incidences of PD-associated peritonitis between patients with and without DM.In Periods 1 and 2, incidence of PD-associated peritonitis was higher in the DM group than in the NDM group (P<0.05). However, no difference according to presence of DM was seen in Period 3. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed DM as a risk factor for incidence of PD-associated peritonitis in Periods 1 and 2, but not in Period 3 (hazard ratio [HR], 2.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15 to 5.23; HR, 2.36; 95%CI, 1.13 to 4.58; and HR, 0.82; 95%CI, 0.41 to 1.54, respectively). Furthermore, the peritonitis-free period was significantly shorter in the DM group than in the DM group in Periods 1 and 2, whereas no significant difference was seen in Period 3 (P<0.01, P<0.01 and P = 0.55, respectively). Moreover, a significant interaction was seen between diabetes and study period, and became less pronounced during Period 3(P<0.01).The increased risk of peritonitis in diabetics reported in previous periods has not been evident in recent years."
https://openalex.org/W2994923501,"The oncogenic fusion protein RUNX1-ETO is a product of the t(8;21) translocation and consists of the hematopoietic transcriptional master regulator RUNX1 and the repressor ETO. RUNX1-ETO is found in 10–15% of acute myeloid leukemia and interferes with the expression of genes that are essential for myeloid differentiation. The neutrophil serine protease Cathepsin G is one of the genes suppressed by RUNX1-ETO, but little is known about its impact on the regulation of other lysosomal proteases. By lentiviral transduction of the t(8;21) positive cell line Kasumi-1 with an RUNX1-ETO specific shRNA, we analyzed long-term effects of stable RUNX1-ETO silencing on cellular phenotypes and target gene expression. Stable anti RUNX1-ETO RNAi reduces both proliferation and apoptosis in Kasumi-1 cells. In addition, long-term knockdown of RUNX1-ETO leads to an upregulation of proteolytic activity in Kasumi-1 cells, which may be released in vitro upon cell lysis leading to massive degradation of cellular proteins. We therefore propose that protein expression data of RUNX1-ETO-silenced Kasumi-1 cells must be analyzed with caution, as cell lysis conditions can heavily influence the results of studies on protein expression. Next, a mass spectrometry-based approach was used to identify protease cleavage patterns in RUNX1-ETO-depleted Kasumi-1 cells and Neutrophil Elastase has been identified as a RUNX1-ETO candidate target. Finally, proteolytic activity of Neutrophil Elastase and Cathepsin G was functionally confirmed by si/shRNA-mediated knockdown in Kasumi-1 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2995098809,"In humans, to reduce deviations from a perfect upright position, information from various sensory cues is combined and continuously weighted based on its reliability. Combining noisy sensory information to produce a coherent and accurate estimate of body sway is a central problem in human balance control. In this study, we first compared the ability of the sensorimotor control mechanisms to deal with altered ankle proprioception or vestibular information (i.e., the single sensory condition). Then, we evaluated whether successive stimulation of difference sensory systems (e.g., Achilles tendon vibration followed by electrical vestibular stimulation, or vice versa) produced a greater alteration of balance control (i.e., the mix sensory condition). Electrical vestibular stimulation (head turned ~90°) and Achilles tendon vibration induced backward body sways. We calculated the root mean square value of the scalar distance between the center of pressure and the center of gravity as well as the time needed to regain balance (i.e., stabilization time). Furthermore, the peak ground reaction force along the anteroposterior axis, immediately following stimulation offset, was determined to compare the balance destabilization across the different conditions. In single conditions, during vestibular or Achilles tendon vibration, no difference in balance control was observed. When sensory information returned to normal, balance control was worse following Achilles tendon vibration. Compared to that of the single sensory condition, successive stimulation of different sensory systems (i.e., mix conditions) increased stabilization time. Overall, the present results reveal that single and successive sensory stimulation challenges the sensorimotor control mechanisms differently."

It is a cross-sectional study conducted with 874 women from 40 to 65 years of age, selected by probabilistic sampling between August 2014 and August 2015. In addition to the outcome variable, overweight and obesity, other variables such as sociodemographic, reproductive, clinical, eating and behavioural factors were evaluated. Descriptive analyses of the variables investigated were performed to determine their frequency distributions. Then, bivariate analyses were performed through Poisson regression. For the multivariate analyses, hierarchical Poisson regression was used to identify factors associated with overweight and obesity in the climacteric period. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was 74%. Attending public school (PR: 1.30-95% CI 1.14-1.50), less schooling (PR: 1.11-95% CI 1.01-1.23), gout (PR: 1.18-95% CI 1.16-1.44), kidney disease (PR: 1.18-95% CI 1.05-1.32), metabolic syndrome (MS) (PR: 1.19-95% CI 1.05-1.34) and fat intake (PR: 1.12-95% CI 1.02-1.23) were considered risk factors for overweight. Having the first birth after 18 years of age (PR: 0.89-95% CI 0.82 to 0.97) was shown to be a protective factor for overweight and obesity. The presence of overweight and obesity is associated with sociodemographic, reproductive, clinical and eating habits."
https://openalex.org/W2994616076,"Microsatellites-a type of short tandem repeat (STR)-have been used for decades as putatively neutral markers to study the genetic structure of diverse human populations. However, recent studies have demonstrated that some microsatellites contribute to gene expression, cis heritability, and phenotype. As a corollary, some microsatellites may contribute to differential gene expression and RNA/protein structure stability in distinct human populations. To test this hypothesis, we investigate genotype frequencies, functional relevance, and adaptive potential of microsatellites in five super-populations (ethnicities) drawn from the 1000 Genomes Project. We discover 3,984 ethnically-biased microsatellite loci (EBML); for each EBML at least one ethnicity has genotype frequencies statistically different from the remaining four. South Asian, East Asian, European, and American EBML show significant overlap; on the contrary, the set of African EBML is mostly unique. We cross-reference the 3,984 EBML with 2,060 previously identified expression STRs (eSTRs); repeats known to affect gene expression (64 total) are over-represented. The most significant pathway enrichments are those associated with the matrisome: a broad collection of genes encoding the extracellular matrix and its associated proteins. At least 14 of the EBML have established links to human disease. Analysis of the 3,984 EBML with respect to known selective sweep regions in the genome shows that allelic variation in some of them is likely associated with adaptive evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2994894588,"Climate changes that occurred during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) had significant consequences in human eco-dynamics across Europe. Among the most striking impacts are the demographic contraction of modern humans into southern refugia and the potential formation of a population bottleneck. In Iberia and southern France transformations also included the occurrence of significant technological changes, mostly marked by the emergence of a diverse set of bifacially-shaped stone projectiles. The rapid dissemination of bifacial technologies and the geographical circumscription of specific projectile morphologies within these regions have been regarded as evidence for: (1) the existence of a system of long-distance exchange and social alliance networks; (2) the organization of human groups into cultural facies with well-defined stylistic territorial boundaries. However, the degree and modes in which cultural transmission have occurred within these territories, and how it may have influenced other domains of the adaptive systems, remains largely unknown. Using southern Iberia as a case-study, this paper presents the first quantitative approach to the organization of lithic technology and its relationship to hunter-gatherers' territorial organization during the LGM. Similarities and dissimilarities in the presence of morphological and metric data describing lithic technologies are used as a proxy to explore modes and degrees of cultural transmission. Statistical results show that similarities in technological options are dependent on the chronology and geographical distance between sites and corroborate previous arguments for the organization of LGM settlement in Southern Iberia into discrete eco-cultural facies."

The analysis results of these factors will be helpful for us to predict the trend of information spreading and find effective strategies to control information spreading."
https://openalex.org/W2996198700,"Previous research has shown that people often separate the present self from past selves. Applying knowledge gained from intergroup research to the interpersonal domain, we argue that the degree to which people identify with their past self (self-identification) influences their reaction when recalling a past event during which they harmed another person. Because they feel close to their past self, we expected this to be threatening for high self-identifiers, and expected them to be motivated to avoid self-critical emotions and blame. Using four meta-analyses, conducted on a set of seven experimental studies, we investigated four ways in which high self-identifiers can distance themselves from the event: by feeling compassion, by taking a third-person rather than first-person perspective, by emphasizing ways in which their present self is different to their past self, and by disidentifying with the past self altogether. We found the strongest interaction effects for compassion: whereas a compassion manipulation increased self-critical emotions and self-blame about the past event for low self-identifiers, it decreased them for high self-identifiers. We argue that this occurs because the other-focused nature of compassion allows high self-identifiers subtly to shift the focus away from their harmful behavior. Our concept of past self-identification had stronger effects than a measure of self-continuity beliefs. It also correlated only moderately with the latter, suggesting they are distinct concepts. Our findings suggest that, ironically, the most effective way to protect the self against reminders of an undesirable past, may be to have compassion for our victims."
https://openalex.org/W2996433171,"Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) and their production of interferon-alpha (IFN-α) are believed to play an important role in human immunodeficiency virus, type I (HIV-1) pathogenesis. PDCs produce IFN-α and other proinflammatory cytokines through stimulation of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and TLR9 present in endosomal compartments. TLR7 recognizes single-stranded viral RNA, while TLR9 recognizes unmethylated DNA. In this study, we examined the mechanisms that may underlie variations in IFN-α production in response to HIV, and the impact of these variations on HIV pathogenesis. In four distinct cohorts, we examined PDC production of IFN-α upon stimulation with inactivated HIV-1 particles and unmethylated DNA. The signaling cascade of TLR7 bifurcates at the myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MyD88) adaptor protein to induce expression of either IFN-α or TNF-α. To determine whether variations in IFN-α production are modulated at the level of the receptor complex or downstream of it, we correlated production of IFN-α and TNF-α following stimulation of TLR7 or TLR9 receptors. Flow cytometry detection of intracellular cytokines showed strong, direct correlations between IFN-α and TNF-α expression in all four cohorts, suggesting that variations in IFN-α production are not due to variations downstream of the receptor complex. We then investigated the events upstream of TLR binding by using lipid-like vesicles to deliver TLR ligands directly to the TLR receptors, bypassing the need for CD4 binding and endocytosis. Similar tight correlations were found in IFN-α and TNF-α production in response to the TLR ligands. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that differences in IFN-α production depend on the regulatory processes at the level of the TLR7 receptor complex. Additionally, we found no association between IFN-α production before HIV infection and disease progression."

Additionally, there was examination of how the intervention was perceived by the parents. Methods Within randomly selected low socioeconomic municipalities in Belgium, families were recruited through primary schools. Families at risk for developing type 2 diabetes were identified using the FINDRISC questionnaire (n = 457). Afterwards, the municipalities were randomly assigned to the intervention or control condition. At risk families assigned to the intervention group were invited to participate in six Feel4Diabetes counselling sessions in which families were encouraged to adopt a healthier lifestyle. The “Movie Models” videos were integrated within two sessions by using a face-to-face group discussion approach. Parenting-related factors were assessed before and after the integration of the videos, using a questionnaire. After integrating the videos, some extra evaluation questions were assessed. In total, 126 families were included in a per protocol evaluation and Repeated Measures ANOVAs were conducted to evaluate the potential intervention effects. Results Some favourable intervention effects were found on parenting practices and related parental self-efficacy regarding children’s eating behaviours, however almost no effects were found on parenting-related factors regarding children’s physical activity and screen-time. In total, 60.0% of the participants indicated that they applied tips regarding parenting practices and 52.0% indicated that discussions with other participants regarding the videos were useful for them. Conclusion The integration of “Movie Models” within the Feel4Diabetes-study was effective in improving some parenting-related factors regarding children’s health behaviours, however most parenting-related factors could not be improved. The implementation of “Movie Models” as a face-to-face group discussion approach was relatively well received and may be a promising way to improve parenting-related factors in vulnerable families.

https://openalex.org/W2996625894,"Excessive hindfoot pronation, talotarsal joint (TTJ) instability, has been attributed to an increase in medial knee compartment pathology. Advocacy for hindfoot realignment has been the subject of research. An internal solution for TTJ instability, extra-osseous talotarsal stabilization (EOTTS), exists but its effect on knee forces is unknown. This is the first study to measure the in vivo forces acting within the medial knee compartment before and after EOTTS. We hypothesized that following EOTTS there should be a reduction of force acting on the medial knee compartment.10 fresh frozen cadaver lower extremities exhibiting clinical and radiographic evidence of TTJ instability were evaluated. The proximal femur segment was mounted to a mechanical testing unit. Pressure sensors were placed within the medial knee compartment. A force of 1000 newtons was then applied, and the femur was internally rotated 10 degrees. Measurements were recorded before and after the insertion of a type II EOTTS stent.Pre-EOTTS resulted in an average of 842 ± 247N acting within the medial knee joint compartment. These forces then decreased to an average of 565 ± 260N (<0.05) following EOTTS, representing an average reduction of force by 32.8%.EOTTS has been shown to decrease the in vivo forces action within the medial knee compartment. This helps to further illustrate the importance of realigning and stabilizing the hindfoot for the prevention and treatment of chronic knee pain."
https://openalex.org/W2996669933,"Older people are continuing to fall despite fall prevention guidelines targeting known falls’ risk factors. Multisite pain is a potential novel falls’ risk factor requiring further exploration. This study hypothesises that: (1) an increasing number of pain sites and widespread pain predicts self-reported falls and falls recorded in primary and secondary healthcare records; (2) those relationships are independent of known falls’ risk factors and putative confounders. This prospective cohort study linked data from self-completed questionnaires, primary care electronic health records, secondary care admission statistics and national mortality data. Between 2002–2005, self-completion questionnaires were mailed to community-dwelling individuals aged 50 years and older registered with one of eight general practices in North Staffordshire, UK(n = 26,129) yielding 18,497 respondents. 11,375 respondents entered the study; 4386 completed six year follow-up. Self-reported falls were extracted from three and six year follow-up questionnaires. Falls requiring healthcare were extracted from routinely collected primary and secondary healthcare data. Increasing number of pain sites increased odds of future 3 year (odds ratio 1.12 (95% confidence interval: 1.01–1.24)) and 6 year self-reported fall (odds ratio 1.02 (1.00–1.03)) and increased hazard of future fall requiring primary healthcare (hazard ratio 1.01 (1.00–1.03)). The presence of widespread pain increased odds of future 3 year (odds ratio 1.27 (0.92–1.75)) and 6 year fall (odds ratio 1.43(1.06–1.95)) and increased hazard of future fall requiring primary healthcare (hazard ratio 1.27(0.98–1.65)). Multisite pain was not associated with future fall requiring secondary care admission. Multisite pain must be included as a falls’ risk factor in guidelines to ensure clinicians identify their older patients at risk of falls and employ timely implementation of current falls prevention strategies."

In this paper, we discuss a specific case, MSP-2, and shows its efficacy in reconstructing several non-trivial characteristic properties of social networks, including networks with power-law degree distribution, power-law with an exponential decay (exponential cut-off), and exponential degree distributions. We evaluate the proposed evolution mechanism over two real-world networks and observe that the generated networks highly resembles the degree distribution of the real-world networks. Besides, several other network properties such as high clustering and triangle count, low spectral radius, and community structure, of the generated networks are significantly closer to the real-world networks."

In this study, CRLF2 mRNA expression levels and clinical and laboratory parameters in 63 pediatric T-ALL patients were detected at the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University and Children's Hospital of Xianyang between February 2015 and June 2018. The patients were treated according to the modified St. Jude TXV ALL protocol, and early treatment responses (bone marrow smear and MRD level) and prognoses in the enrolled patients were assessed. CRLF2 overexpression was detected in 21/63 (33.33%) patients. Statistical differences were not found for clinical or laboratory parameters (including sex, age, initial WBC count, incidence mediastinal involvement, abnormal karyotype and fusion genes) between patients with high CRLF2 expression and patients with low expression of CRLF2 (P>0.05). One patient died of tumor lysis syndrome and renal failure, and the treatment response was monitored on day 19 (TP1) of remission in 62 patients. One patient quit treatment because of family decisions, and 61 patients underwent treatment response evaluation on day 46 (TP2) of remission. Significant differences were not found between patients with high CRLF2 expression and patients with low CRLF2 expression in terms of the treatment responses at TP1 or TP2 (P>0.05). Following October 2018, 12 patients among the 61 evaluable patients relapsed (relapse rate: 19.67%), 3 patients died from chemotherapy, and the treatment-related mortality (TRM) rate was 4.92%. Secondary tumors occurred in 1 patient. The 3-year prospective EFS rate was 54.1±11.2% and 77.7±6.6% for the 61 evaluable patients and 58 patients without TRM. Patients with low CRLF2 expression had longer EFS durations than patients with high CRLF2 expression (61 evaluable patients: 35.91± 2.38 months vs 23.43± 2.57 months; 58 patients without TRM: 37.86± 2.08 months vs 24.55±2.43 months, P<0.05). CRLF2 expression levels were also monitored in 13 patients at TP1 and TP2, and the MRD level did not vary with the CRLF2 expression level. Our data suggest that clinical features, laboratory findings and treatment responses in the pediatric T-ALL population do not vary based on the overexpression of CRLF2 but that CRLF2 overexpression can contribute to a high risk of relapse in pediatric T-ALL. Thus, CRLF2 expression levels should not be used as biomarkers for monitoring MRD."

Antibiotic resistance in multiple strains of P. aeruginosa is a rapidly developing clinical problem. We have previously demonstrated that the oxygen levels at the site of P. aeruginosa infection can strongly influence virulence and antibiotic resistance in this pathogen, although the oxygen-sensing and -signaling mechanisms underpinning this response have remained unknown. In this study, we investigated the potential role of the putative oxygen sensor Pseudomonas prolyl hydroxylase (PPHD) in the control of virulence and antibiotic resistance in P. aeruginosa . We found that a P. aeruginosa strain lacking PPHD (PAO310) exhibits increased virulence associated with increased bacterial motility. Furthermore, PPHD-deficient P. aeruginosa displayed enhanced antibiotic resistance against tetracycline through increased expression of the xenobiotic transporters mexEF-oprN and MexXY. Of note, the effect of the PPHD knockout on antibiotic resistance was phenocopied in bacteria exposed to atmospheric hypoxia. We conclude that PPHD is a putative bacterial oxygen sensor that may link microenvironmental oxygen levels to virulence and antibiotic resistance in P. aeruginosa ."
