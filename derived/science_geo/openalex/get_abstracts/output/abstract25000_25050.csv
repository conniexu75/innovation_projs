https://openalex.org/W2024363942,"Alzheimer's disease is a form of localized amyloidosis characterized by cerebral cortical amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and amyloid deposits within the walls of leptomeningeal vessels. Although most cases of Alzheimer's disease are sporadic, kindreds with autosomal-dominant inheritance of the syndrome suggest that a single mutation may be important in pathogenesis. Direct sequencing of DNA from a family with autopsy-proven Alzheimer's disease revealed a single amino acid substitution (Phe for Val) in the transmembrane domain of the amyloid precursor protein. This mutation correlates with the presence of Alzheimer's disease in all patients in this study, and may be the inherited factor causing both amyloid fibril formation and dementia."
https://openalex.org/W1976213001,"The immunological mechanisms required to engender resistance have been defined in few infectious diseases of man, and the role of specific cytokines is unclear. Leprosy presents clinically as a spectrum in which resistance correlates with cell-mediated immunity to the pathogen. To assess in situ cytokine patterns, messenger RNA extracted from leprosy skin biopsy specimens was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction with 14 cytokine-specific primers. In lesions of the resistant form of the disease, messenger RNAs coding for interleukin-2 and interferon-γ were most evident. In contrast, messenger RNAs for interleukin-4, interleukin-5, and interleukin-10 predominated in the multibacillary form. Thus, resistance and susceptibility were correlated with distinct patterns of cytokine production."
https://openalex.org/W2047842452,"LAP, a transcriptional activator, and LIP, a transcriptional repressor, are translated from a single mRNA species by using two AUGs within the same reading frame. These two proteins share the 145 C-terminal amino acids that contain the basic DNA-binding domain and the leucine zipper dimerization helix. Probably owing to its higher affinity for its DNA cognate sequences, LIP can attenuate the transcriptional stimulation by LAP in substoichiometric amounts. As revealed by transient transfection experiments, a moderate increase in the LAP/LIP ratio results in a significantly higher transcriptional activation of an appropriate target gene. The LAP/LIP ratio increases about 5-fold during terminal rat liver differentiation and is thus likely to modulate the activity of LAP in the intact animal."
https://openalex.org/W2072516696,"The kinetics of the primary event in vision have been resolved with the use of femtosecond optical measurement techniques. The 11-cis retinal prosthetic group of rhodopsin is excited with a 35-femtosecond pump pulse at 500 nanometers, and the transient changes in absorption are measured between 450 and 580 nanometers with a 10-femtosecond probe pulse. Within 200 femtoseconds, an increased absorption is observed between 540 and 580 nanometers, indicating the formation of photoproduct on this time scale. These measurements demonstrate that the first step in vision, the 11-cis----11-trans torsional isomerization of the rhodopsin chromophore, is essentially complete in only 200 femtoseconds."

Expression of antisense RNA to the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway of ethylene, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase, inhibits fruit ripening in tomato plants. Administration of exogenous ethylene or propylene reverses the inhibitory effect. This result demonstrates that ethylene is the trigger and not the by-product of ripening and raises the prospect that the life-span of plant tissues can be extended, thereby preventing spoilage."
https://openalex.org/W2165830038,"Shaker potassium channels inactivate and recover from inactivation with multiple exponential components, suggesting the presence of multiple inactivation processes. We describe two different types of inactivation in Shaker potassium channels. N-type inactivation can occur as rapidly as a few milliseconds and has been shown to involve an intracellular region at the amino-terminal acting as a blocker of the pore. C-type inactivation is independent of voltage over a range of -25 to +50 mV. It does not require intact N-type inactivation, but is partially coupled to it. The kinetics of C-type inactivation are quite different for channels with different alternatively spliced carboxy-terminal regions. We have localized the differences in C-type inactivation between the ShB and ShA variants to a single amino acid in the sixth membrane-spanning region. N- and C-type inactivation occur by distinct molecular mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2022274052,"The neocortex is patterned in layers of neurons that are generated in an orderly sequence during development. This correlation between cell birthday and laminar fate prompted an examination of how neuronal phenotypes are determined in the developing cortex. At various times after labeling with [3H]thymidine, embryonic progenitor cells were transplanted into older host brains. The laminar fate of transplanted neurons correlates with the position of their progenitors in the cell cycle at the time of transplantation. Daughters of cells transplanted in S-phase migrate to layer 2/3, as do host neurons. Progenitors transplanted later in the cell cycle, however, produce daughters that are committed to their normal, deep-layer fates. Thus, environmental factors are important determinants of laminar fate, but embryonic progenitors undergo cyclical changes in their ability to respond to such cues."
https://openalex.org/W2058598541,"To better understand the basis for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) persistence and latency, the form in which viral DNA exists in the peripheral T lymphocyte reservoir of infected individuals was investigated. In asymptomatic individuals, HIV-1 was harbored predominantly as full-length, unintegrated complementary DNA. These extrachromosomal DNA forms retained the ability to integrate upon T cell activation in vitro. In patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), there was an increase in integrated relative to extrachromosomal DNA forms. By analysis of DNA from patient lymphocyte subpopulations depleted of human lymphocyte antigen-Dr receptor-positive cells, quiescent T cells were identified as the source of extrachromosomal HIV-1 DNA. Thus quiescent T lymphocytes may be a major and inducible HIV-1 reservoir in infected individuals."
https://openalex.org/W1979753840,"An in vivo selection system for isolating targets of DNA binding proteins in yeast was developed and used to identify the DNA binding site for the NGFI-B protein, a member of the steroid-thyroid hormone receptor superfamily. The feasibility of the technique was verified by selecting DNA fragments that contained binding sites for GCN4, a well-characterized yeast transcriptional activator. The DNA binding domain of NGFI-B, expressed as part of a LexA-NGFI-B-GAL4 chimeric activator, was then used to isolate a rat genomic DNA fragment that contained an NGFI-B binding site. The NGFI-B response element (NBRE) is similar to but functionally distinct from elements recognized by the estrogen and thyroid hormone receptors and the hormone receptor-like proteins COUP-TF, CF1, and H-2RIIBP. Cotransfection experiments in mammalian cells demonstrated that NGFI-B can activate transcription from the NBRE with or without its putative ligand binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W1973783562,"An identified neuron of the leech, a Retzius cell, has been attached to the open gate of a p-channel field-effect transistor. Action potentials, spontaneous or stimulated, modulate directly the source-drain current in silicon. The electronic signals match the shape of the action potential. The average voltage on the gate was up to 25 percent of the intracellular voltage change. Occasionally weak signals that resemble the first derivative of the action potential were observed. The junctions can be described by a model that includes capacitive coupling of the plasma membrane and the gate oxide and that accounts for variable resistance of the seal."
https://openalex.org/W1966449090,"Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) functions as a regulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and coordinator of the stress response. CRH receptors exist in peripheral sites of the immune system, and CRH promotes several immune functions in vitro. The effect of systemic immunoneutralization of CRH was tested in an experimental model of chemically induced aseptic inflammation in rats. Intraperitoneal administration of rabbit antiserum to CRH caused suppression of both inflammatory exudate volume and cell concentration by approximately 50 to 60 percent. CRH was detected in the inflamed area but not in the systemic circulation. Immunoreactive CRH is therefore produced in peripheral inflammatory sites where, in contrast to its systemic indirect immunosuppressive effects, it acts as an autocrine or paracrine inflammatory cytokine."
https://openalex.org/W2003687681,"The crystal structure of a murine adenosine deaminase complexed with 6-hydroxyl-1,6-dihydropurine ribonucleoside, a nearly ideal transition-state analog, has been determined and refined at 2.4 angstrom resolution. The structure is folded as an eight-stranded parallel α/β barrel with a deep pocket at the β-barrel COOH-terminal end wherein the inhibitor and a zinc are bound and completely sequestered. The presence of the zinc cofactor and the precise structure of the bound analog were not previously known. The 6R isomer of the analog is very tightly held in place by the coordination of the 6-hydroxyl to the zinc and the formation of nine hydrogen bonds. On the basis of the structure of the complex a stereoselective addition-elimination or SN2 mechanism of the enzyme is proposed with the zinc atom and the Glu and Asp residues playing key roles. A molecular explanation of a hereditary disease caused by several point mutations of an enzyme is also presented."
https://openalex.org/W2036358440,We have used an iterative in vitro genetic selection to identify the important structural features of the viral RNA element bound by the Rev protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Functional Rev-binding RNAs were selected from a pool of 10(13) variants of the wild-type Rev-binding domain. Bases conserved among the binding species define a 20 nucleotide core binding element. Covariation of some of these conserved bases indicates that the Rev-binding element is a stem-bulge-stem with a G:G base pair in the bulge. Mutational studies show that this non-Watson-Crick base pair is required for Rev binding in vitro and Rev responsiveness in vivo. We propose that the G:G base pair distorts the sugar-phosphate backbone of viral RNA and that this distortion is a critical determinant of recognition by Rev.
https://openalex.org/W2050766639,"A family of proteins was shown to bind cooperatively with TFIID to core promoters, as previously demonstrated for the general initiation factor TFIIA. These factors form distinct complexes with TFIID, fail to bind DNA in the absence of TFIID, differ chromatographically from TFIIA, and compete with TFIIA for binding to TFIID. Our results suggest the formation of heterogeneous preinitiation complexes at the step involving TFIIA interactions. This establishes a molecular switch that regulates basal level transcription in vitro and has consequences for transcriptional activation by gene-specific activators."
https://openalex.org/W1993713336,"Dioxin (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, TCDD), a widespread environmental contaminant, may elicit its effects by altering gene expression in susceptible cells. Five TCDD-responsive complementary DNA clones were isolated from a human keratinocyte cell line. One of these clones encodes plasminogen activator inhibitor-2, a factor that influences growth and differentiation by regulating proteolysis of the extracellular matrix. Another encodes the cytokine interleukin-1β. Thus, TCDD alters the expression of growth regulatory genes and has effects similar to those of other tumor-promoting agents that affect both inflammation and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2019762740,"We have used a recombinant retrovirus carrying the lacZ gene to study the developmental potential of precursor cells from the embryonic rat cerebral cortex in dissociated cell culture. Virus was used to label a small number of cultured cells genetically so that their fate could be determined. Infected clones were detected with an anti-β-galactosidase serum, and the labeled cells were identified using monoclonal antibodies. The results revealed that most precursor cells generated a single cell type, the majority being either neurons or oligodendrocytes. However, a proportion off the neuronal clones also included oligodendrocytes. This proportion increased until embryonic day 16 when 18% of the neuronal clones were of this type. This suggests that during neurogenesis in the cerebral cortex there exists a cell with the potential to generate these two quite different neural cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2021818277,"Although it is generally agreed that general anesthetics ultimately act on neuronal ion channels, there is considerable controversy over whether this occurs by direct binding to protein or secondarily by nonspecific perturbation of lipids. Very pure optical isomers of the inhalational general anesthetic isoflurane exhibited clear stereoselectivity in their effects on particularly sensitive ion channels in identified molluscan central nervous system neurons. At the human median effect dose (ED50) for general anesthesia, the (+)-isomer was about twofold more effective than the (-)-isomer both in eliciting the anesthetic-activated potassium current IK(An) and in inhibiting a current mediated by neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. For inhibiting the much less sensitive transient potassium current IA, the (-)-isomer was marginally more potent than the (+)-isomer. Both isomers were equally effective at disrupting lipid bilayers."
https://openalex.org/W2036136061,"Treatment of most cells with brefeldin A (BFA) leads to the retrieval of the Golgi complex to the endoplasmic reticulum, presumably reflecting an inhibition of cytoplasmic coat protein binding to Golgi membranes. Although BFA has been thought to act only on biosynthetic organelles, we now show that this drug also reversibly blocks polymeric immunoglobulin receptor-mediated transcytosis in MDCK cells. The action of BFA on transcytosis was selective, since internalization, recycling, and intracellular degradation were unaffected. The block occurred early on the transcytotic pathway, probably before the translocation of IgA-containing vesicles from the basal to the apical cytoplasm. Although BFA caused MDCK cell endosomes to become more tubular, the organization of the Golgi and binding of the 110 kd Golgi coat protein beta-COP was surprisingly unaffected. These results suggest that in MDCK cells, endocytic organelles contain a BFA-sensitive coat that regulates their organization and function even though the Golgi coat is BFA resistant."
https://openalex.org/W2047128786,"Sex peptide, a secreted component of the male accessory glands, has been shown to induce behavioral and physiological changes in mated Drosophila. We transformed flies with a hybrid gene containing an hsp70 promoter fused to a cDNA encoding sex peptide. Heat-induced ectopic expression of the peptide in transgenic virgin females altered their reproductive behavior, in the presence of courting males, to that observed in mated females. This demonstrates that the peptide is functional as expected. Time course studies revealed that the behavioral change appeared earlier than the stimulated ovulation. We have also introduced a modified sex peptide gene that is driven by the yp1 enhancer, conferring expression in adult females, and shown that these flies refuse mating constitutively in the presence of courting males and lay unfertilized eggs at the rate of mated females."
https://openalex.org/W1977084276,"A gradient of the maternal morphogen dorsal establishes asymmetric patterns of gene expression along the dorsal-ventral axis of early embryos and activates the regulatory genes twist and snail, which are responsible for the differentiation of the ventral mesoderm. Expression of snail is restricted to the presumptive mesoderm, and the sharp lateral limits of this expression help to define the mesoderm-neuroectoderm boundary by repressing the expression of regulatory genes that are responsible for the differentiation of the neuroectoderm. The snail gene encodes a zinc finger protein, and neuroectodermal genes that are normally restricted to ventral-lateral regions of early embryos are expressed throughout ventral regions of snail- mutants. The formation of the sharp snail border involves dosage-sensitive interactions between dorsal and twist, which encode regulatory proteins that are related to the mammalian transcription factors NF-kB and MyoD, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2007663749,"Healing of a broken chromosome and in eukaryotes involves acquisition of a telomere. During macronuclear development in ciliated protozoans, germline chromosomes are fragmented into linear subchromosomes, whose ends are healed by de novo addition of telomeres. We showed previously that the ribonucleoprotein enzyme telomerase elongates preexisting telomeres by synthesizing one telomeric DNA strand, using a template sequence in the RNA moiety of the enzyme. By marking telomerase with a mutation in the telomerase RNA template, which causes synthesis of novel telomeric sequences, we now show that in the ciliate Tetrahymena, telomerase directly adds telomeric DNA onto nontelomeric sequences during developmentally controlled chromosome healing. Unexpectedly, one telomerase RNA template mutation converted telomerase from an enzyme that normally synthesizes precisely templated sequences to a less precise polymerase that sometimes synthesizes irregular telomeric repeats in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2011125756,"We have removed the centrosome from cultured BSC-1 cells by microsurgery, leaving enough cytoplasm with the nucleated cell fragment (karyoplast) to ensure survival and growth. In each experiment, we followed the fate of the karyoplast as well as the anucleate cell fragment (cytoplast) containing the original pair of centrioles. Experimental karyoplasts reestablish a juxtanuclear microtubule-organizing center, an astral array of microtubules, and a compact Golgi apparatus. They enter and presumably complete S phase, and they grow beyond the size of an average BSC-1 cell. However, they do not regenerate centrioles in time periods equivalent to more than 10 cell cycles and do not undergo cell division. Control-operated cells with centrosomes left in the karyoplast progress through the cell cycle, duplicate the centrosome, and form clonal cell colonies. We conclude that the removal of centrioles uncouples cell growth from cell reproduction and impedes centriole biogenesis and centrosome duplication."
https://openalex.org/W2029044730,"SC1, an integral membrane glycoprotein of 100 kd, is uniquely and transiently expressed on spinal cord motoneurons early in development and appears in peripheral neurons and several other tissues during development. SC1 has been purified by immunoaffinity techniques, and SC1 cDNA clones have been obtained by screening an E4 chick embryo phage expression library with a rabbit polyclonal antibody produced against purified SC1. The deduced protein sequence of 588 amino acids consists of a signal peptide, five immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic tail. The sequence is most similar to MUC18, reported as a tumor progression marker in human melanoma. Transfection of SC1 cDNA into mammalian cells leads to cell surface expression of SC1 antigen and a subsequent increase in cell-cell adhesion. SC1 molecules bind to each other via a homophilic adhesion mechanism, independently of calcium or magnesium ions. SC1 may have a role in lateral motor column formation or neurite growth or fasciculation."
https://openalex.org/W2015993052,"Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by sleepiness and episodes of cataplexy. Cataplexy is an abrupt loss of muscle tone, most often triggered by sudden, strong emotions. A subset of cells in the medial medulla of the narcoleptic dog discharged at high rates only in cataplexy and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. These cells were noncholinergic and were localized to ventromedial and caudal portions of the nucleus magnocellularis. The localization and discharge pattern of these cells indicate that cataplexy results from a triggering in waking of the neurons responsible for the suppression of muscle tone in REM sleep. However, most medullary cells were inactive during cataplexy but were active during REM sleep. These data demonstrate that cataplexy is a distinct behavioral state, differing from other sleep and waking states in its pattern of brainstem neuronal activity."
https://openalex.org/W2087116150,"Filamentous bacteriophage coat protein undergoes a remarkable structural transition during the viral assembly process as it is transferred from the membrane environment of the cell, where it spans the phospholipid bilayer, to the newly extruded virus particles. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies show the membrane-bound form of the 46-residue Pf1 coat protein to be surprisingly complex with five distinct regions. The secondary structure consists of a long hydrophobic helix (residues 19 to 42) that spans the bilayer and a short amphipathic helix (residues 6 to 13) parallel to the plane of the bilayer. The NH2-terminus (residues 1 to 5), the COOH-terminus (residues 43 to 46), and residues 14 to 18 connecting the two helices are mobile. By comparing the structure and dynamics of the membrane-bound coat protein with that of the viral form as determined by NMR and neutron diffraction, essential features of assembly process can be identified."
https://openalex.org/W2091314517,"During the process of chromatin diminution, which takes place in all presomatic cells of the early Ascaris embryo, the heterochromatic termini of the chromosomes are lost. Here we show that the newly formed ends of the reduced somatic chromosomes carry tandem repeats of the telomeric sequence TTAGGC. Comparison of a cloned somatic telomere with the corresponding germline chromosomal region revealed that these telomeric repeats are not present at or near the chromosomal breakage site. They are most likely added by a telomerase-mediated event. Chromosomal breakage, which precedes the telomere addition process, takes place within a short, specific chromosomal region (CBR); however, it does not occur at a single locus, but rather at many different sites. Altogether, our data show that chromatin diminution in Ascaris is a complex molecular process that includes site-specific chromosomal breakage, new telomere formation, and DNA degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2017094771,"A DNA construct containing the bacterial beta-galactosidase gene (lacZ) was used to study somatic DNA recombination in the transgenic mouse brain. Recombination-positive areas of the adult brain were stained blue with X-gal, a substrate of beta-galactosidase. Blue-colored cells appeared soon after birth, and continued to emerge in postnatal tissue. Staining was prominent in sensory as opposed to motor regions of the brain, and was present in more than 70 discrete areas of the nervous system. The possibility of DNA rearrangement is discussed with respect to the development of the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2092168230,"Saccades are controlled by neurons in the brainstem reticular formation that receive input from the superior colliculus and cortex. Recently two quantitative models have been proposed for the role of the colliculus in the generation of three-dimensional eye movements. In order to test these models, three-dimensional eye movements were measured in the alert monkey to investigate whether the saccadic motor map of the superior colliculus is two-dimensional, representing retinal target vectors, or three-dimensional, representing three-dimensional motor error for the rotation of the eye. Electrical stimulation of the superior colliculus produced two-dimensional, not three-dimensional, eye movements. It is therefore concluded that the collicular motor map is two-dimensional."
https://openalex.org/W1995353541,"One of the first zygotically active genes required for formation of the terminal domains of the Drosophila embryo is tailless (tll). Expression of the tll gene is activated ectopically in gain-of-function mutants of the maternal terminal gene torso (tor); this suggests that tor normally activates the tll gene in the termini. Ectopic expression of tll under the control of an inducible promoter results in differentiation of ectopic terminal-specific structures, the Filzkörper, and leads to the activation of at least one gene, hunchback, that is required to form these structures. Ectopic expression of the tll gene also represses segmentation by repressing the gap genes Krüppel and knirps and probably also pair rule genes."
https://openalex.org/W2008732647,"A titer for homologous viral neutralization activity (greater than 1:19,683) was observed after a 3.5-year immunization period with an octameric, branching peptide representing the principal neutralizing determinant (PND) of the human immunodeficiency virus-1IIIB envelope protein. Booster immunizations elicited persistent and potent antibodies in guinea pigs, exceeding responses produced by a conventional bovine serum albumin conjugate by 100-fold. Peptide length, central presentation of a conserved sequence, and inclusion of an upstream sequence contributed to immunogenicity. Titers (greater than 1:1,000) of heterotypic neutralizing antibodies also developed. Octameric PND peptides are a promising approach for an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W1553093811,"Abstract The henny-feathering trait is an autosomal dominant mutation that causes the expression of aromatase activity and accumulation of aromatase mRNA in extragonadal tissues of chickens. The current studies establish that the aromatase gene is not amplified and is organized similarly in control (Leghorn) and henny-feathered (Sebright and Campine) birds. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the nine coding exons of the aromatase gene reveals that the predicted amino acid sequence is identical in all three strains. We, therefore, characterized the genomic DNA segments flanking the coding segment of the Sebright, Leghorn, and Campine aromatase genes. The site of transcription initiation utilized in the ovary of all three strains is located approximately 147 nucleotides upstream of the initiator methionine. In addition to aromatase mRNA derived from this common ovarian promoter, another species of aromatase mRNA is present in Sebright and Campine ovary and is the only type detected in Sebright fibroblasts. cDNA copies of this second species of aromatase mRNA contain a unique 5' terminus, suggesting that a second promoter controls extragonadal aromatase expression in birds that carry the henny-feathering trait. Nucleotide sequence analysis of this 5' terminus indicates that this segment is derived from a retroviral long terminal repeat."
https://openalex.org/W1966474073,"GenBank, the national repository for nucleotide sequence data, has implemented a new model of scientific data management, which we term electronic data publishing. In traditional publishing, both scientific conclusions and supporting data are communicated via the printed page, and in electronic journal publishing, both types of information are communicated via electronic media. In electronic data publishing, by contrast, conclusions are published in a journal while data are published via a network-accessible, electronic database."
https://openalex.org/W2072173252,"Many candidate antigens of malaria vaccines have limited immunological recognition. One exception is Pfs25, a cysteine-rich, 25-kilodalton sexual stage surface protein of Plasmodium falciparum. Pfs25 is a target of monoclonal antibodies that block transmission of malaria from vertebrate host to mosquito vector. The surface of mammalian cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus that expressed Pfs25 specifically bound transmission-blocking monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, major histocompatibility complex-disparate congenic mouse strains immunized with recombinant Pfs25 elicited transmission-blocking antibodies, demonstrating that the capacity to develop transmission-blocking antibodies is not genetically restricted in mice. Live recombinant viruses may provide an inexpensive, easily administered alternative to subunit vaccines prepared from purified recombinant proteins to block transmission of malaria in developing countries."
https://openalex.org/W2122345758,"Different combinations of Torpedo acetylcholine receptor (AChR) subunits stably expressed in mouse fibroblasts were used to establish a role for phosphorylation in AChR biogenesis. When cell lines expressing fully functional AChR complexes (alpha 2 beta gamma delta) were labeled with 32P, only gamma and delta subunits were phosphorylated. Forskolin, which causes a 2- to 3-fold increase in AChR expression by stimulating subunit assembly, increased unassembled gamma phosphorylation, but had little effect on unassembled delta. The forskolin effect on subunit phosphorylation was rapid, significantly preceding its effect on expression. The pivotal role of the gamma subunit was established by treating alpha beta gamma and alpha beta delta cell lines with forskolin and observing increased expression of only alpha beta gamma complexes. This effect was also observed in alpha gamma, but not alpha delta cells. We conclude that the cAMP-induced increase in expression of cell surface AChRs is due to phosphorylation of unassembled gamma subunits, which leads to increased efficiency of assembly of all four subunits."

https://openalex.org/W2078516754,"Expression of adult-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction is thought to result from selective induction of their genes in endplate-associated nuclei due to local neurotrophic control. However, denervation studies indicate that endplate-specific expression can be maintained in the absence of the nerve. We investigated the role played by the basal lamina in this expression by assaying for the adult-type-specific epsilon RNA in noninnervated regenerating muscle. We found that this RNA is locally expressed beneath the old endplates after 10 days of regeneration. At earlier times epsilon RNA is also found in areas other than the endplate region. These results indicate that in adult muscle the basal lamina contains all the components necessary to direct nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene expression to the endplate."
https://openalex.org/W1992367315,"Large palindromic DNAs are formed in many cell types, but their molecular mechanism is unknown. During nuclear differentiation in Tetrahymena, the ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) are converted from a single integrated copy to an extrachromosomal head-to-head palindrome. Using in vitro mutagenesis and Tetrahymena transformation, we show that two properties of the rDNA are necessary and sufficient for palindrome formation. The first is a pair of 42 bp inverted repeats found at the rDNA's 5' end. Its inverted symmetry, but not specific sequence, is important. The second is a free end next to the repeats. It is normally created by chromosome breakage in vivo, but can also be provided by restriction endonuclease cutting before transformation. We also demonstrate that the ability to form palindromes is not restricted to developing nuclei, but is present in vegetative cells as well. This process may represent a general mechanism for palindrome formation in eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1997901301,"The guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins include signal-transducing heterotrimeric G proteins (for example, Gs, Gi), smaller GTP-binding proteins that function in protein sorting, and the oncogenic protein p21ras. The T cell receptor complexes CD4-p56lck and CD8-p56lck were found to include a 32- to 33-kilodalton phosphoprotein (p32) that was recognized by an antiserum to a consensus GTP-binding region in G proteins. Immunoprecipitated CD4 and CD8 complexes bound GTP and hydrolyzed it to guanosine diphosphate (GDP). The p32 protein was covalently linked to [alpha-32P]GTP by ultraviolet photoaffinity labeling. These results demonstrate an interaction between T cell receptor complexes and an intracellular GTP-binding protein."

https://openalex.org/W2076232290,"Somatic and germline cells interact during oogenesis to establish the pattern axes of the Drosophila eggshell and embryo. The role of the oocyte nucleus in pattern formation was tested with the use of laser ablation. Ablation in stage 6 to 9 egg chambers caused partial or complete ventralization of the eggshell, phenotypes similar to those of eggs produced by gurken or torpedo females. Accumulation of vasa protein at the posterior pole of treated oocytes was also disrupted. Thus the oocyte nucleus is required as late as stage 9 for dorsoventral patterning within the follicle cells and for polar plasm assembly in the oocyte."
https://openalex.org/W1488751005,"Collagen II is synthesized at high levels by differentiated chondrocytes. A 620-base pair DNA sequence in the first intron of the rat collagen II gene was previously determined to have chondrocyte-specific enhancer activity. Using mobility shift assays, we have defined a decamer sequence, 5'-CACAATGCAT-3', in the middle of the enhancer that binds a protein or protein complex expressed by chondrocytes but not by NIH3T3 cells or L2 rat fibroblasts. This protein was also induced during the differentiation of limb bud mesenchymal cells into chondrocytes. Mutational analyses, coupled with both in vitro binding studies and direct assays of enhancer activity following transfection into cells, demonstrated that this sequence is involved in the binding of the chondrocyte nuclear protein(s) and is necessary for the enhancer activity. This sequence has homology to the consensus binding sequence for helix-loop-helix transcription factors."

The structure and relative stability of all four triplets that are possible involving a G⋅C Watson-Crick base pair were determined with one- and two-dimensional proton nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. Triplexes containing A⋅G⋅C, G⋅G⋅C, or T⋅G⋅C triplets were less stable than the corresponding parent molecule containing a C⋅G⋅C triplet. However, all mismatched bases formed specific hydrogen bonds in the major groove of the double helix. The relative effect of these mismatches on the stability of the triplex differs from the effect assayed (under different conditions) by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and DNA cleavage with oligonucleotide EDTA⋅Fe(II)."

https://openalex.org/W1504713868,"The yeast mitochondrial phosphate transport protein (PTP) has only 38% sequence similarity to the bovine heart protein, and it has recently been postulated to code for a mitochondrial import receptor. Since the reconstitutively active protein is not completely pure, it is important to demonstrate explicitly that the yeast gene codes for PTP. We have replaced Thr43 with Cys (T43C) and show that its unidirectional and pH gradient-dependent inorganic phosphate transport activity becomes highly sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide. This new PTP/T43C catalyzes less than 10% of the wild type transport activity (1 mM [Pi]e, pHe (6.80); 0 mM [Pi]i, pHi (8.07); 30 s [Pi] uptake) suggesting that Thr43 occupies an important position in the PTP."
https://openalex.org/W1507156410,"Previous crystallographic studies of the antibacterial trimethoprim in complexes with bacterial and avian dihydrofolate reductases have shown substantial differences in the mode of binding, providing plausible explanations for the origin of the remarkable species selectivity of this inhibitor (Matthews, D. A., Bolin, J. T., Burridge, J. M., Filman, D. J., Volz, K. W., Kaufman, B. T., Beddell, C. R., Champness, J. N., Stammers, D. K., and Kraut, J. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 381-391; Matthews, D. A., Bolin, J. T., Burridge, J. M., Filman, D. J., Volz, K. W., and Kraut, J. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 392-399). A major species difference between the active sites is that the only carboxylate present is always Glu in vertebrates and Asp in bacteria. Crystallographic studies of the wild-type and E30D mutant of the enzyme from mouse now reveal that in both cases trimethoprim is bound in an identical fashion to that observed with the bacterial enzyme, and there is no obvious single explanation for the origin of the 10(5)-fold selectivity of trimethoprim binding. In an earlier study of a mouse wild-type enzyme using more limited data it was proposed that trimethoprim bound in the avian mode (Stammers, D. K., Champness, J. N., Beddell, C. R., Dann, J. G., Eliopoulos, E. E., Geddes, A. J., Ogg, D., and North, A. C. T. (1987) FEBS Lett. 218, 178-184), but a re-examination indicates that the occupancy of the active site by trimethoprim is less than had been thought, and we are currently unable to make an unambiguous interpretation of the electron density maps and cannot confirm the avian mode of binding in those crystals."
https://openalex.org/W1986705714,"Mapping and sequencing the entire human genome in a timely fashion requires organization of all available resources to the common goal. Federal funding agencies have established individual genome centers that will focus on one or more chromosomes. Further, chromosome-specific workshops are being organized to permit individual centers, researchers, or groups to pool their results with other colleagues working on the same chromosome. The activities imply the following: (1) each chromosome community should have its own database; (2) the databases should permit inclusion of data from many different groups and give different map interpretations of the same chromosome region; and (3) similar formats for data storage and representation should be used across the databases to simplify data exchange and interpretation. However, no matter how sophisticated modern database management systems may be, they cannot realistically fulfill their responsibilities until all parties concerned are prepared to submit their data to centralized databases. To do this they need to be provided with adequate tools and incentives. Provision of the tools is the task of the database organizations. Provision of incentives is partly a question of adequate peer recognition for direct submission, partly a willingness to openly share information with the community at large, andmore » partly the need for funding organizations to insist on data sharing as a requisite for their continued support.« less"

The role of the oocyte nucleus in pattern formation was tested with the use of laser ablation. Ablation in stage 6 to 9 egg chambers caused partial or complete ventralization of the eggshell, phenotypes similar to those of eggs produced by gurken or torpedo females. Accumulation of vasa protein at the posterior pole of treated oocytes was also disrupted. Thus the oocyte nucleus is required as late as stage 9 for dorsoventral patterning within the follicle cells and for polar plasm assembly in the oocyte."
