https://openalex.org/W2806219344,"Metabolic reprogramming is a prominent feature of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Here we investigated metabolic dependencies in a panel of ccRCC cell lines using nutrient depletion, functional RNAi screening and inhibitor treatment. We found that ccRCC cells are highly sensitive to the depletion of glutamine or cystine, two amino acids required for glutathione (GSH) synthesis. Moreover, silencing of enzymes of the GSH biosynthesis pathway or glutathione peroxidases, which depend on GSH for the removal of cellular hydroperoxides, selectively reduced viability of ccRCC cells but did not affect the growth of non-malignant renal epithelial cells. Inhibition of GSH synthesis triggered ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death associated with enhanced lipid peroxidation. VHL is a major tumour suppressor in ccRCC and loss of VHL leads to stabilisation of hypoxia inducible factors HIF-1α and HIF-2α. Restoration of functional VHL via exogenous expression of pVHL reverted ccRCC cells to an oxidative metabolism and rendered them insensitive to the induction of ferroptosis. VHL reconstituted cells also exhibited reduced lipid storage and higher expression of genes associated with oxidiative phosphorylation and fatty acid metabolism. Importantly, inhibition of β-oxidation or mitochondrial ATP-synthesis restored ferroptosis sensitivity in VHL reconstituted cells. We also found that inhibition of GSH synthesis blocked tumour growth in a MYC-dependent mouse model of renal cancer. Together, our data suggest that reduced fatty acid metabolism due to inhibition of β-oxidation renders renal cancer cells highly dependent on the GSH/GPX pathway to prevent lipid peroxidation and ferroptotic cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2805292391,"Accumulating evidence has indicated that microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in the occurrence and progression of ovarian cancer (OC). However, the function of miRNAs implicated in OC remains unclear. This study investigated the potential role of miR-211 in OC. Gene Expression Omnibus database analysis indicated that miR-211 expression was significantly down-regulated in OC tissues compared with normal specimens. In addition, miR-211 overexpression apparently inhibited proliferation, migration, xenograft growth, and induced apoptosis in HEY-T30 and SKOV3 cells. Moreover, PHF19, a component of the polycomb group of proteins, was found to be a direct target of miR-211 based on the luciferase reporter assay and Western blot analysis. Consistently, survival analysis indicated that high PHF19 expression was associated with shorter survival time in patients with OC. Importantly, silence of PHF19 reduced proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest, promoted apoptosis, suppressed migration, and inhibited xenograft growth in SKOV3 cells. Restoration of PHF19 expression markedly reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-211 on OC. Moreover, our results indicate that the long noncoding RNA MALAT1 could sponge miR-211 as a competing endogenous RNA and potentially up-regulate PHF19 expression, thus facilitating the OC progression. These findings suggest that the MALAT1/miR-211/PHF19 axis may act as a key mediator in OC and provide new insight into the prevention of this disease.-Tao, F., Tian, X., Ruan, S., Shen, M., Zhang, Z. miR-211 sponges lncRNA MALAT1 to suppress tumor growth and progression through inhibiting PHF19 in ovarian carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2977784403,"There is an urgent and unmet need for accurate biomarkers in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. A pharmaco-metabolomics study was conducted using plasma samples from the TRO19622 (olesoxime) trial to assess the link between early metabolomic profiles and clinical outcomes. Patients included in this trial were randomized into either Group O receiving olesoxime (n = 38) or Group P receiving placebo (n = 36). The metabolomic profile was assessed at time-point one (V1) and 12 months (V12) after the initiation of the treatment. High performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry was used to quantify 188 metabolites (Biocrates® commercial kit). Multivariate analysis based on machine learning approaches (i.e. Biosigner algorithm) was performed. Metabolomic profiles at V1 and V12 and changes in metabolomic profiles between V1 and V12 accurately discriminated between Groups O and P (p<5×10–6), and identified glycine, kynurenine and citrulline/arginine as the best predictors of group membership. Changes in metabolomic profiles were closely linked to clinical progression, and correlated with glutamine levels in Group P and amino acids, lipids and spermidine levels in Group O. Multivariate models accurately predicted disease progression and highlighted the discriminant role of sphingomyelins (SM C22:3, SM C24:1, SM OH C22:2, SM C16:1). To predict SVC from SM C24:1 in group O and SVC from SM OH C22:2 and SM C16:1 in group P+O, we noted a median sensitivity between 67% and 100%, a specificity between 66.7 and 71.4%, a positive predictive value between 66 and 75% and a negative predictive value between 70% and 100% in the test sets. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that the metabolomics has a role in evaluating the biological effect of an investigational drug and may be a candidate biomarker as a secondary outcome measure in clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2805192311,"The understanding of acclimation strategies to low temperature and water availability is decisive to ensure coffee crop sustainability, since these environmental conditions determine the suitability of cultivation areas. In this context, the impacts of single and combined exposure to drought and cold were evaluated in three genotypes of the two major cropped species, Coffea arabica cv. Icatu, Coffea canephora cv. Apoatã, and the hybrid Obatã. Crucial traits of plant resilience to environmental stresses have been examined: photosynthesis, lipoperoxidation and the antioxidant response. Drought and/or cold promoted leaf dehydration, which was accompanied by stomatal and mesophyll limitations that impaired leaf C-assimilation in all genotypes. However, Icatu showed a lower impact upon stress exposure and a faster and complete photosynthetic recovery. Although lipoperoxidation was increased by drought (Icatu) and cold (all genotypes), it was greatly reduced by stress interaction, especially in Icatu. In fact, although the antioxidative system was reinforced under single drought and cold exposure (e.g., activity of enzymes as Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, APX, glutathione reductase and catalase, CAT), the stronger increases were observed upon the simultaneous exposure to both stresses, which was accompanied with a transcriptional response of some genes, namely related to APX. Complementary, non-enzyme antioxidant molecules were promoted mostly by cold and the stress interaction, including α-tocopherol (in C. arabica plants), ascorbate (ASC), zeaxanthin, and phenolic compounds (all genotypes). In general, drought promoted antioxidant enzymes activity, whereas cold enhanced the synthesis of both enzyme and non-enzyme antioxidants, the latter likely related to a higher need of antioxidative capability when enzyme reactions were probably quite repressed by low temperature. Icatu showed the wider antioxidative capability, with the triggering of all studied antioxidative molecules by drought (except CAT), cold, and, particularly, stress interaction (except ASC), revealing a clear stress cross-tolerance. This justified the lower impacts on membrane lipoperoxidation and photosynthetic capacity under stress interaction conditions, related to a better ROS control. These findings are also relevant to coffee water management, showing that watering in the cold season should be largely avoided."
https://openalex.org/W2805582187,"Interleukin 4 (IL4) is generally viewed as a Th2 cytokine capable of polarizing macrophages into an anti-inflammatory phenotype, whereas granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is often viewed as a proinflammatory cytokine with part of this function due to its action on monocytes/macrophages. Paradoxically, these two cytokines act additively to enhance the in vitro differentiation of dendritic cells from precursors such as monocytes. One up-regulated marker of an IL4-polarized M2 macrophage is the chemokine (C–C motif) ligand 17 (CCL17), which we have recently reported to be induced by GM-CSF in monocytes/macrophages in an interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4)–dependent manner. In this study, we report that IL4 also induces CCL17 production by acting through IRF4 in human monocytes and murine macrophages. Furthermore, evidence is presented that IL4 up-regulates IRF4 expression at the epigenetic level by enhancing the expression and activity of jumonji domain–containing protein 3 (JMJD3) demethylase. Intriguingly, silencing the signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) gene led to a decrease in not only CCL17 formation, but also in that of its upstream regulators, JMJD3 and IRF4. Moreover, IL4 treatment of human monocytes resulted in an increased association of STAT6 to the promoter regions of the CCL17, IRF4, and JMJD3 genes. Thus, despite their vastly different functions, IL4 and GM-CSF appear to share elements of a common signaling pathway in regulating CCL17 production in human monocytes and murine macrophages.

https://openalex.org/W2806943226,"Consistent with the view that disgust might be involved in persistent body dissatisfaction, there is preliminary evidence showing a positive correlation between measures of negative body image and indices of both trait disgust and self-directed disgust. In two correlational studies among undergraduates (N = 577 and N = 346, respectively) we aimed at replicating and extending these findings by testing a series of critical relationships, which follow from our hypotheses that 1) trait disgust propensity would increase the risk of developing a negative body image by increasing the likelihood of feeling self-disgust, and 2) trait disgust sensitivity would heighten the impact of self-disgust on the development of persistent negative body appraisals. Replicating previous research, both studies showed that negative body image was positively related to self-disgust, disgust propensity and disgust sensitivity. Mediation analyses showed that, in line with our model, self-disgust partly accounted for the association between disgust propensity and negative body image. Although disgust sensitivity showed an independent relationship with body image, disgust sensitivity did not moderate the association between self-disgust and negative body image. All in all, findings are consistent with the view that self-disgust-induced avoidance may contribute to persistent negative body appraisals."
https://openalex.org/W2807214913,"The role of albumin reabsorption in proximal tubule (PT) cells has emerged as an important factor in the genesis of albuminuria observed in the early stages of diabetes. Evidence has shown that a decrease in megalin expression could be the key mechanism in this process. In the present work, we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the modulation of albumin endocytosis in LLC-PK1 cells, a model of PT cells. High glucose concentrations (HG) inhibited megalin expression and albumin endocytosis after 48 h of incubation. This inhibitory effect involves the entrance of glucose into PT cells through SGLT located at the luminal membrane. Once inside PT cells, glucose is diverted to the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) increasing O-GlcNAcylation of several intracellular proteins, including PKB. This process promotes the inhibition of PKB activity measured by its phosphorylation at Thr-308 and Ser-473 and phosphorylation of specific substrates, glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and tuberous sclerosis complex 2. The decrease in PKB activity led to a decrease in megalin expression and, consequently, reducing albumin endocytosis in LLC-PK1 cells. HG did not change mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) C2 activity, responsible for phosphorylated PKB at Ser-473. In addition, HG activated the mTORC1/S6K pathway, but this effect was not correlated to the decrease in megalin expression or albumin endocytosis.

Aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like protein 1 (Arntl or Bmal1) is the only clock gene whose loss disrupts circadian locomotor behavior in constant darkness. BMAL1 levels are affected by proteasomal inhibition and by several enzymes in the ubiquitin–proteasome system, but the exact molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, using immunoprecipitation and MS analyses, we discovered an interaction between BMAL1 and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 O (UBE2O), an E3-independent E2 ubiquitin–conjugating enzyme (i.e. hybrid E2/E3 enzyme). Biochemical experiments with cell lines and animal tissues validated this specific interaction and uncovered that UBE2O expression reduces BMAL1 levels by promoting its ubiquitination and degradation. Moreover, UBE2O expression/knockdown diminished/increased, respectively, BMAL1-mediated transcriptional activity but did not affect BMAL1 gene expression. Bioluminescence experiments disclosed that UBE2O knockdown elevates the amplitude of the circadian clock in human osteosarcoma U2OS cells. Furthermore, mapping of the BMAL1-interacting domain in UBE2O and analyses of BMAL1 stability and ubiquitination revealed that the conserved region 2 (CR2) in UBE2O significantly enhances BMAL1 ubiquitination and decreases BMAL1 protein levels. A Cys-to-Ser substitution experiment identified the critical Cys residue in the CR2 domain responsible for BMAL1 ubiquitination. This work identifies UBE2O as a critical regulator in the ubiquitin–proteasome system, which modulates BMAL1 transcriptional activity and circadian function by promoting BMAL1 ubiquitination and degradation under normal physiological conditions.

Age-dependent accumulation of lipofuscin in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) matches the age-dependent increase in the incidence of the atrophic (dry) form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and therefore may be one of several pathogenic factors contributing to AMD progression. Lipofuscin bisretinoid synthesis in the retina depends on the influx of serum retinol from the circulation into the RPE. Formation of the tertiary retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4)–transthyretin–retinol complex in the serum is required for this influx. Herein, we report the pharmacological effects of the non-retinoid RBP4 antagonist, BPN-14136. BPN-14136 dosing in the Abca4−/− mouse model of increased lipofuscinogenesis significantly reduced serum RBP4 levels and inhibited bisretinoid synthesis, and this inhibition correlated with a partial reduction in visual cycle retinoids such as retinaldehydes serving as bisretinoid precursors. BPN-14136 administration at doses inducing maximal serum RBP4 reduction did not produce changes in the rate of the visual cycle, consistent with minimal changes in dark adaptation. Abca4−/− mice exhibited dysregulation of the complement system in the retina, and BPN-14136 administration normalized the retinal levels of proinflammatory complement cascade components such as complement factors D and H, C-reactive protein, and C3. We conclude that BPN-14136 has several beneficial characteristics, combining inhibition of bisretinoid synthesis and reduction in retinaldehydes with normalization of the retinal complement system.

We previously determined the apo crystal structure of S. enterica AadA at 2.5-Å resolution (12.Chen Y. Näsvall J. Wu S. Andersson D.I. Selmer M. Structure of AadA from Salmonella enterica: a monomeric aminoglycoside (3″)(9) adenyltransferase.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2015; 71 (26527143): 2267-227710.1107/S1399004715016429Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In the apo state, AadA has a monomeric two-domain structure with the active site located between an N-terminal adenylyltransferase domain and a C-terminal helical domain. In this inactive conformation, residues predicted to be involved in binding of ATP and magnesium were instead engaged in interdomain interactions. Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we demonstrated that magnesium and ATP had to bind prior to aminoglycoside substrate, suggesting that ATP binding triggered a conformational change, repositioning the two domains for substrate recognition. We now set out to characterize how AadA binds to ATP and its two different antibiotic substrates. We here present crystal structures of wild type (WT) AadA with ATP or ATP and streptomycin and of an active-site mutant in complex with ATP and streptomycin or dihydrostreptomycin. Using manual docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we present a model for how spectinomycin explores a partially different part of the active-site pocket. We also confirm the identity of the catalytic base using in vitro assays. Based on structure-based sequence analysis, we propose and experimentally verify sequence determinants that allow classification of ANT(3″)(9) enzymes and the related ANT(9) enzymes, which only mediate resistance to spectinomycin. Cocrystallization of WT AadA with ATP and magnesium yielded well-diffracting crystals. The crystals grew in a new space group, P32, with two molecules in the asymmetric unit, and the complete atomic structure could be built and refined to 1.9-Å resolution. The two molecules of AadA display close-to-identical structures (root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.1 Å over 261 Cα atoms). This structure represents a native state of the enzyme prior to binding of aminoglycoside substrate. To accommodate binding of ATP and magnesium, compared with the apo structure, the main part of the C-terminal domain rotates 11° relative to the N-terminal domain around the first helix of the C-terminal domain (helix 7), resulting in a shift of up to 4 Å (Fig. 2A). There are also local conformational changes of the 202–206 loop region directly linked to the interaction with ATP. The two parts of the structure are very similar to the apo structure (12.Chen Y. Näsvall J. Wu S. Andersson D.I. Selmer M. Structure of AadA from Salmonella enterica: a monomeric aminoglycoside (3″)(9) adenyltransferase.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2015; 71 (26527143): 2267-227710.1107/S1399004715016429Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) (r.m.s.d. of 0.77 Å over 171 Cα atoms for residues 1–173 and 1.03 Å over 88 Cα atoms for residues 175–262). The structure shows clear electron density for ATP and two magnesium ions in the interdomain cleft (Fig. 2B). In the N-terminal domain, Asp-47, Asp-49, and Glu-87 together with the phosphates of ATP coordinate the two magnesium ions. In addition, the phosphates make interactions with Ser-36 and Ser-46 in the N-terminal domain and Arg-192, Lys-205, and Tyr-231 in the C-terminal domain. The ribose is in C2′ endo conformation with both hydroxyl groups involved in hydrogen bonding to Asp-130. The adenine base is in syn conformation, packing between Leu-133, Leu-166, Thr-189, Arg-192, Ile-193, and Phe-202, and makes a single hydrogen bond to Thr-196 of the protein. The interaction of Arg-192 with the bridging oxygen seems critical to obtain a magnesium-coordinating conformation of ATP because binding of nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues AMPCPP (12.Chen Y. Näsvall J. Wu S. Andersson D.I. Selmer M. Structure of AadA from Salmonella enterica: a monomeric aminoglycoside (3″)(9) adenyltransferase.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2015; 71 (26527143): 2267-227710.1107/S1399004715016429Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and AMPNPP (data not shown) could not be detected. In the apo crystal structure, ATP- and magnesium-binding residues of both domains were involved in interdomain interactions, explaining why that crystal form could not accommodate any ligand binding (12.Chen Y. Näsvall J. Wu S. Andersson D.I. Selmer M. Structure of AadA from Salmonella enterica: a monomeric aminoglycoside (3″)(9) adenyltransferase.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

The magnesium- and phosphate-coordinating residues in the N-terminal domain are to a large extent conserved in other adenylyltransferase enzymes as well as polymerases and nucleases with two metal ions in the active site (12.Chen Y. Näsvall J. Wu S. Andersson D.I. Selmer M. Structure of AadA from Salmonella enterica: a monomeric aminoglycoside (3″)(9) adenyltransferase.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

We can thus rationalize that some related structures, e.g. the structure of kanamycin nucleotidyltransferase in complex with AMPCPP (14.Pedersen L.C. Benning M.M. Holden H.M. Structural investigation of the antibiotic and ATP-binding sites in kanamycin nucleotidyltransferase.Biochemistry. 1995; 34 (7577914): 13305-1331110.1021/bi00041a005Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), only display one magnesium ion because the bridging carbon of the ATP analogue affects the conformation of the phosphate tail in a manner preventing binding of a second magnesium ion. Previous experiments demonstrated that the E87Q mutant of AadA did not convey resistance to streptomycin but still bound ATP and streptomycin, although with 4- and 20-fold lower affinity than the WT enzyme (12.Chen Y. Näsvall J. Wu S. Andersson D.I. Selmer M. Structure of AadA from Salmonella enterica: a monomeric aminoglycoside (3″)(9) adenyltransferase.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2015; 71 (26527143): 2267-227710.1107/S1399004715016429Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We now cocrystallized this presumably catalytically inactive mutant with ATP, magnesium, and antibiotic substrates and obtained well diffracting crystals with streptomycin and dihydrostreptomycin. The crystals grew in the same space group and with similar cell dimensions as the WT crystals with ATP but only appeared in conditions containing calcium. The structure of AadA(E87Q) with ATP and streptomycin (AadA(E87Q)–ATP–sry) was refined to 1.73-Å resolution, and the structure of AadA(E87Q) with ATP and dihydrostreptomycin (AadA(E87Q)–ATP–dhs) was resolved to 1.4-Å resolution. Both structures are modeled with calcium ions instead of magnesium in the active site. The identity of divalent ion B was confirmed in an anomalous difference map (Fig. S1). The second ion (A) is tentatively modeled as calcium based on coordination distances and level of electron density. However, the identity of this ion does not affect any of our conclusions. Dihydrostreptomycin only differs from streptomycin in the reduction of the carbonyl group at the 3′-position (Fig. 1), and because this position does not show any interaction with the protein and the two structures are virtually identical (r.m.s.d. of 0.2 Å over 261 Cα atoms), further analysis will be based on the dihydrostreptomycin structure. The overall structure of AadA(E87Q)–ATP–dhs is very similar to AadA–ATP (r.m.s.d. of 0.3 Å over 252 Cα atoms). Dihydrostreptomycin is bound between the two domains of AadA with the C ring sandwiched between the two domains in proximity of ATP, whereas the B- and A rings extend further toward the surface and form their major interactions with the C-terminal domain (Fig. 3A). AadA hides 417 Å2 (58%) of the van der Waals area of dihydrostreptomycin and makes interactions with all three rings (Fig. 3B). The C ring is the site of modification and is situated in proximity of the suggested catalytic base Glu-87 (mutated to glutamine in the structure) with the 3″-hydroxyl situated in the closest position. Furthermore, the ring is also oriented through a hydrogen bond of Asp-182 with the 6″-hydroxyl group and a stacking interaction with Trp-112. In turn, the B ring is oriented by His-185 through a hydrogen bond with the 3′-hydroxyl group. The enzyme does not interact with the carbonyl at position 3′ of the B ring (Fig. 1), showing why AadA can bind and modify both streptomycin and dihydrostreptomycin. Finally, the A ring displays multiple interactions with the enzyme. Hydrogen bond interactions occur between Trp-173 and hydroxyl groups at positions 5 and 6, between the backbone carbonyl of Ala-177 and the guanidinium group at position 1, and between the backbone carbonyl of Asp-178 and the 6-hydroxyl group. The conformational change of the C-terminal domain relative to the N-terminal domain upon ATP binding (Fig. 2A) is essential to allow streptomycin to fit into the active site. Brief soaking of WT AadA–ATP crystals with streptomycin resulted in a 2.05-Å–resolution structure with clear density for ATP, magnesium, and the major part of streptomycin. The overall conformation of the enzyme is very similar to AadA–ATP (r.m.s.d. of 0.3 Å over 256 Cα atoms) and AadA(E87Q)–dhs (r.m.s.d. of 0.4 Å over 256 Cα atoms). Absence of electron density for part of the C ring (C2″, C3″, and the methylamine; Fig. 3C) suggests that this part of the substrate may move within the active site in connection with catalysis (further discussed below). Sequence analysis and structure comparison with other adenylyltransferase enzymes suggested that Glu-87 is the catalytic base in AadA. This was supported by minimum inhibitory concentration tests of streptomycin with WT AadA and single-amino acid substitution mutants E87Q and E87A (12.Chen Y. Näsvall J. Wu S. Andersson D.I. Selmer M. Structure of AadA from Salmonella enterica: a monomeric aminoglycoside (3″)(9) adenyltransferase.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2015; 71 (26527143): 2267-227710.1107/S1399004715016429Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To confirm the enzymatic in vitro activity of AadA toward streptomycin and to further investigate the role of Glu-87, in vitro activity of AadA was tested for the WT and mutant enzymes E87A and E87Q. In the enzymatic assay, pyrophosphatase converted the pyrophosphate by-product of the reaction to phosphate, which was subsequently detected by the malachite green assay. At the conditions assayed, the turnover for the WT enzyme was 0.020 ± 0.001 s−1. To our surprise, both mutant enzymes showed activity in this assay with turnover of 0.032 ± 0.003 s−1 for E87Q and 0.004 ± 0.001 s−1 for E87A. In the absence of streptomycin, none of the WT or mutant enzymes showed detectable activity. To distinguish whether the observed activity was a result of streptomycin adenylation or unproductive ATP hydrolysis, we developed a chromatographic assay to directly detect adenylated streptomycin. The positive charge of adenylated streptomycin allows its separation from negatively charged ATP and AMP by cation-exchange chromatography, and detection by absorbance at 260 nm, where unmodified streptomycin does not absorb. Our results showed that, in contrast to the WT enzyme, the E87Q mutant could not adenylate streptomycin (Fig. 4), consolidating the role of Glu-87 as essential for adenylation activity. However, in the absence of catalytic base, water can apparently act as a nucleophile, turning AadA into a hydrolytic enzyme. One such candidate water molecule is in the AadA–ATP–dhs structure coordinated between the magnesium ion, the 3″-hydroxyl of dihydrostreptomycin, and the α-phosphate of ATP (Fig. S2). We used the H++ server (15.Anandakrishnan R. Aguilar B. Onufriev A.V. H++ 3.0: automating pK prediction and the preparation of biomolecular structures for atomistic molecular modeling and simulations.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40 (22570416): W537-W54110.1093/nar/gks375Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar) to computationally predict a pKa of 7.1 for Glu-87 in the ATP structures with magnesium (with or without streptomycin). This indicates that Glu-87 within the catalytic center has a pKa in the range where it could be reversibly protonated and abstract a proton from the 3″-hydroxyl of streptomycin. The adenyl transfer reaction by AadA is equivalent to the reactions carried out by well characterized two-metal-ion polymerases and nucleases that display very similar arrangements of residues in the active site (13.Yang W. Lee J.Y. Nowotny M. Making and breaking nucleic acids: two-Mg2+-ion catalysis and substrate specificity.Mol. Cell. 2006; 22 (16600865): 5-1310.1016/j.molcel.2006.03.013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). In analogy with these associative-mechanism enzymes, we predict that the catalytic base Glu-87 will abstract a proton from the 3″-hydroxyl group of streptomycin to allow the oxygen to make a nucleophilic attack on the α-phosphate of ATP. The geometry of the substrates in the active site is consistent with a single-in-line displacement mechanism as suggested for kanamycin nucleotidyltransferase (14.Pedersen L.C. Benning M.M. Holden H.M. Structural investigation of the antibiotic and ATP-binding sites in kanamycin nucleotidyltransferase.Biochemistry. 1995; 34 (7577914): 13305-1331110.1021/bi00041a005Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and LinB (16.Morar M. Bhullar K. Hughes D.W. Junop M. Wright G.D. Structure and mechanism of the lincosamide antibiotic adenylyltransferase LinB.Structure. 2009; 17 (20004168): 1649-165910.1016/j.str.2009.10.013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), but the two substrates are too far apart to represent a catalytic state according to this mechanism. Thus, the nucleophilic oxygen would normally coordinate the magnesium ion and approach 2.5-Å distance of the ATP phosphorus atom during the reaction, whereas the position of our 3″-hydroxyl in AadA–ATP–sry is at 5.1 Å from the α-phosphorus. It seems necessary for the substrate to move, possibly linked to a local conformational change of the enzyme active site, to allow the deprotonated 3″-hydroxyl to coordinate the magnesium ion before nucleophilic attack. The weak electron density for the reacting part of the substrate in the AadA–ATP–sry structure supports dynamics in this part of the substrate. In our higher-resolution substrate structures, the active site in the presence of calcium is distorted from the native, magnesium-bound state through a cumulative effect of increased coordination distances. Binding of calcium to the first metal-binding site (B in Figs. 2B and 3B) increases the distances to coordinating atoms, and the octahedral coordination geometry becomes nonperfect (Fig. S3, A and B). This has an impact on the second magnesium site (A in Figs. 2B and 3B), which now has a nonoptimal configuration, leading to partial-occupancy binding of a divalent ion modeled as calcium (Fig. S3, C and D). In the WT structure, Glu-87 is positioned to coordinate both the magnesium and the substrate 3″-hydroxyl position, using the same side-chain oxygen in the manner observed in other adenylyltransferase structures (16.Morar M. Bhullar K. Hughes D.W. Junop M. Wright G.D.

The third class of enzymes does not provide resistance to any of the antibiotics (one example from C. jejuni (23.Nirdnoy W. Mason C.J. Guerry P.

Including the functionally annotated sequences that were not in the Pfam database, 193 sequences of presumably the same monomeric domain arrangement and sequence identity of 27% or higher were subjected to subsequent analysis. To identify the sequence determinants for the ANT(9) and ANT(3″) activities, the substrate-binding residues from the AadA complex structures with streptomycin and dihydrostreptomycin were mapped to the functionally annotated sequences (Fig. 5) and the entire family. The sequence identities between sequences with predicted ANT(3″)(9) activity were 43% or higher, and those between sequences with predicted ANT(9) activity were 38% or higher. Amino acids that interact with the C ring (the adenylation site) of streptomycin, Glu-87, Trp-112, Asp-182, and His/Asn-185, are conserved in all ANT(3″)(9) and ANT(9) enzymes, defining a subgroup of in total 71 sequences. Enzymes with ANT(3″)(9) activity are characterized by conservation of residues that interact with the A ring of streptomycin. Trp-173 and a two-amino-acid insertion at position 177-178, involved in backbone carbonyl interactions, are conserved in 26 of the 71 sequences. Based on this, we propose that the determinants for adenylation activity on spectinomycin are Glu-87, Trp-112, Asp-182, and His/Asn-185 and that the activity toward streptomycin in addition requires Trp-173 and the insertion at position 177-178.

The present study investigates the approach of combining the methods of mathematical models and the information included in betting odds. A soccer forecasting model based on the well-known ELO rating system and taking advantage of betting odds as a source of information is presented. Data from almost 15.000 soccer matches (seasons 2007/2008 until 2016/2017) are used, including both domestic matches (English Premier League, German Bundesliga, Spanish Primera Division and Italian Serie A) and international matches (UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europe League). The novel betting odds based ELO model is shown to outperform classic ELO models, thus demonstrating that betting odds prior to a match contain more relevant information than the result of the match itself. It is shown how the novel model can help to gain valuable insights into the quality of soccer teams and its development over time, thus having a practical benefit in performance analysis. Moreover, it is argued that network based approaches might help in further improving rating and forecasting methods."
https://openalex.org/W2806071707,"Although highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) remarkably increased life expectancy of HIV positive people, the rate of novel HIV-1 infections worldwide still represent a major concern. In this context, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) approaches such as vaginal microbicide gels topically releasing antiretroviral drugs, showed to have a striking impact in limiting HIV-1 spread. Nevertheless, the co-presence of other genital infections, particularly those due to HSV-1 or 2, constitute a serious drawback that strongly limits the efficacy of PrEP approaches. For this reason, combinations of different compounds with mixed antiviral and antiretroviral activity are thoroughly investigated Here we report the synthesis and the biological evaluation of a novel series of rhodanine derivatives, which showed to inhibit both HIV-1 and HSV-1/2 replication at nanomolar concentration, and were found to be active also on acyclovir resistant HSV-2 strains. The compounds showed a considerable reduction of activity in presence of serum due to a high binding to serum albumin, as determined through in vitro ADME evaluations. However, the most promising compound of the series maintained a considerable activity in gel formulation, with an EC50 comparable to that obtained for the reference drug tenofovir. Moreover, the series of compounds showed pharmacokinetic properties suitable for topical formulation, thus suggesting that the novel rhodanine derivatives could represent effective agents to be used as dual anti HIV/HSV microbicides in PrEP approaches."

The findings in this work suggest that dysregulation of Hb and heme levels in AD brains may contribute to impaired amyloid clearance and that targeting heme homeostasis may reduce amyloid pathogenesis.

Among the flies positive for the bacterium, six (18%) were Paratrichobius longicrus, seven (29%) Strebla guajiro, two (40%) Aspidoptera phyllostomatis, five (11%) Aspidoptera falcata, one (10%) Trichobius anducei, one (25%) Megistopoda aranea, and 18 (32%) Trichobius joblingi, and collected from bats of the following species: Artibeus lituratus, Carollia perspicillata, Artibeus planirostris, Sturnira lilium, and Artibeus obscurus. Six sequences were obtained for Bartonella (nuoG [n = 2], gltA [n = 2], rpoB [n = 1], ribC = 1]). The phylogenetic analysis based on gltA (750pb) gene showed that the Bartonella sequences clustered with Bartonella genotypes detected in bats and ectoparasites previously sampled in Latin America, including Brazil. Only one sample (0.49%) of the species Trichobius joblingi collected from a specimen of Carollia perspicillata was positive for Rickettsia sp. in cPCR based on the gltA gene (401bp). This sequence was clustered with a ‘Candidatus Rickettsia andaenae"" genotype detected in an Amblyomma parvum tick collected from a rodent in the southern region of Brazilian Pantanal. The sampled Macronyssidae and Spinturnicidae mites were negative for Bartonella spp. and Rickettsia spp. This study demonstrated the first occurrence of Bartonella spp. and Rickettsia spp. DNA in Streblidae flies collected from bats in Brazil."

Breakdown of the BRB occurs in a number of ocular diseases that result in vision loss. Understanding the molecular and cellular pathways involved in the development and maintenance of the BRB is critical to developing therapeutics for these conditions. To visualize the BRB in vivo, we used the transgenic Tg(l-fabp:DBP-EGFP:flk1:mCherry) zebrafish model that expresses vitamin D binding protein (a member of the albumin gene family) tagged to green fluorescent protein. Retinoic acid (RA) plays a number of important roles in vertebrate development and has been shown to play a protective role during inflammation-induced blood-brain barrier disruption. The role of RA in BRB development and maintenance remains unknown. To disrupt RA signaling, Tg(l-fabp:DBP-EGFP:flk1:mCherry) zebrafish were treated with N, N-diethylaminobenzaldehyde and 4-[(1 E)-2-[5,6-dihydro-5,5-dimethyl-8-(2-phenylethynyl)-2-naphthalenyl]ethenyl]benzoic acid, which are antagonists of retinal dehydrogenase and the RA receptor, respectively. Treatment with either compound resulted in BRB disruption and reduced visual acuity, whereas cotreatment with all- trans RA effectively rescued BRB integrity. Additionally, transgenic overexpression of Cyp26a1, which catalyzes RA degradation, resulted in breakdown of the BRB. Our results demonstrate that RA signaling is critical for maintenance of the BRB and could play a role in diseases such as diabetic macular edema.-Pollock, L. M., Xie, J., Bell, B. A., Anand-Apte, B. Retinoic acid signaling is essential for maintenance of the blood-retinal barrier."
https://openalex.org/W2806380093,"Multi-stakeholder platforms (MSPs) have been playing an increasing role in interventions aiming to generate and scale innovations in agricultural systems. However, the contribution of MSPs in achieving innovations and scaling has been varied, and many factors have been reported to be important for their performance. This paper aims to provide evidence on the contribution of MSPs to innovation and scaling by focusing on three developing country cases in Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Rwanda. Through social network analysis and logistic models, the paper studies the changes in the characteristics of multi-stakeholder innovation networks targeted by MSPs and identifies factors that play significant roles in triggering these changes. The results demonstrate that MSPs do not necessarily expand and decentralize innovation networks but can lead to contraction and centralization in the initial years of implementation. They show that some of the intended next users of interventions with MSPs–local-level actors–left the innovation networks, whereas the lead organization controlling resource allocation in the MSPs substantially increased its centrality. They also indicate that not all the factors of change in innovation networks are country specific. Initial conditions of innovation networks and funding provided by the MSPs are common factors explaining changes in innovation networks across countries and across different network functions. The study argues that investigating multi-stakeholder innovation network characteristics targeted by the MSP using a network approach in early implementation can contribute to better performance in generating and scaling innovations, and that funding can be an effective implementation tool in developing country contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2805153560,"Serine-threonine kinase Akt (also known as PKB, protein kinase B), a core intracellular mediator of cell survival, is involved in various human cancers and has been suggested to play an important role in the regulation of autophagy in mammalian cells. Nonetheless, the physiological function of Akt in the lysosomes is currently unknown. We have reported previously that PtdIns(3)P-dependent lysosomal accumulation of the Akt-Phafin2 complex is a critical step for autophagy induction. Here, to characterize the molecular function of activated Akt in the lysosomes in the process of autophagy, we searched for the molecules that interact with the Akt complex at the lysosomes after induction of autophagy. By time-of-flight-mass spectrometry (TOF/MS) analysis, kinases of the VRK family, a unique serine-threonine family of kinases in the human kinome, were identified. VRK2 interacts with Akt1 and Akt2, but not with Akt3; the C terminus of Akt and the N terminus of VRK2 facilitate the interaction of Akt and VRK2 in mammalian cells. The kinase-dead form of VRK2A (KD VRK2A) failed to interact with Akt in coimmunoprecipitation assays. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) experiments showed that, in the lysosomes, Akt interacted with VRK2A but not with VRK2B or KD VRK2A. Immunofluorescent assays revealed that VRK2 and phosphorylated Akt accumulated in the lysosomes after autophagy induction. WT VRK2A, but not KD VRK2A or VRK2B, facilitated accumulation of phosphorylated Akt in the lysosomes. Downregulation of VRK2 abrogated the lysosomal accumulation of phosphorylated Akt and impaired nuclear localization of TFEB; these events coincided to inhibition of autophagy induction. The VRK2-Akt complex is required for control of lysosomal size, acidification, bacterial degradation, and for viral replication. Moreover, lysosomal VRK2-Akt controls cellular proliferation and mitochondrial outer-membrane stabilization. Given the roles of autophagy in the pathogenesis of human cancer, the current study provides a novel insight into the oncogenic activity of VRK2-Akt complexes in the lysosomes via modulation of autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2805717588,"Hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) is a relatively new dynamic preservation procedure that has not been widely implemented in liver transplantation despite its advantages. Improved graft protection is one such advantage offered by HOPE and has been attributed to multiple mechanisms, one of which may be the modulation of the thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP)/NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome pathway. The TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway plays a critical role in sterile inflammation under oxidative stress as a result of ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). In the current study, we aimed to investigate the graft protection offered by HOPE and its impact on the TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. To simulate conditions of donation after cardiac death (DCD) liver transplantation, rat livers were exposed to 30 min of warm ischemia after cardiac arrest. Livers were then preserved under cold storage (CS) or with HOPE for 3 h. Livers were then subj ected to 1h ofisolated reperfusion. Liver injuries were assessed on the isolated perfusion rat liver model system before and after reper fusion. Compared with the CS group, the HOPE group had a significant reduction in liver injury and improvement in liver function. Our findings also revealed that reperfusion injury induced liver damage and activated the TXNIP/ NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in DCD rat livers. Pretreatment of DCD rat livers with HOPE inhibited the TXNIP/ NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and attenuated liver IRI. Attenuation of oxidative stress as a result of HOPE led to the down-regulation of the TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and thus offered superior protection compared with the traditional CS method of organ preservation.—He, W., Ye, S., Zeng, C., Xue, S., Hu, X., Zhang, X., Gao, S., Xiong, Y., He, X., Vivalda, S., Li, L., Wang, Y., Ye, Q.

https://openalex.org/W2806021333,"Despite their demonstrated biocompatibility and osteogenic properties, oyster shells have been reported as a potential alternative to other commonly used materials for bone substitution. This study evaluated whether an experimental bone substitute (EBS) made from a typical oyster shell of Northeastern Brazil (Crassostrea rhizophora) has effects on bone development using an animal model. Oysters were collected from a biologically assisted vivarium, and their inner layer was used for preparing an EBS. Chemical and surface characterization of EBS was performed using Individually Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), respectively. Seventy-two rats were randomly assigned to groups according to the treatment of bone defects created in the submandibular area: Negative Control (-C), Positive Control (+C; Bio-Oss®) and EBS. Euthanasia occurred at 7, 21, 42 and 56 days postoperatively. The bone pieces were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The formation of bone tissue was evaluated histologically and histomorphometrically. Data were analyzed through the Kruskal-Wallis test and ANOVA considering a significant level of 5%. The main element found in EBS was calcium (71.68%), and it presented heterogeneity in the particle size and a porosity aspect at SEM analysis. Histological results revealed the absence of inflammatory cells in all groups, being that EBS presented the most accelerated process of bone formation with a statistically significant difference between this group and the +C and -C groups in the 21-day time-point (p < 0.05). After 21 days, the bone formation process was similar between all groups (p > 0.05), showing an immature lamellar bone pattern after 56 days of experimentation (p > 0.05). Within the limitations of this study, it was possible to conclude that EBS presented good biocompatibility and promoted fast stimulation for bone-forming cells in an animal model."

Brazilian biodiversity and the knowledge of traditional peoples have contributed to the treatment of several diseases, including diabetes. Apis mellifera bee tea is used by indigenous Brazilians to treat diabetes, and this traditional knowledge needs to be recorded and studied.The objective of this study was to record the use and to evaluate the antioxidant, antihyperglycemic, and antidiabetic activity of Apis mellifera bee tea, which is used by the Guarani and Kaiowá indigenous people for the treatment of diabetes. Semi-structured interviews were performed with Guarani and Kaiowá ethnic indigenous people from the State of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, seeking to identify the animal species used for medicinal purposes. For the experimental procedures, tea prepared with macerated Apis mellifera bees was used. In vitro assays were performed to evaluate antioxidant activity; direct free radical scavenging, protection against oxidative hemolysis, lipid peroxidation were evaluated in human erythrocytes and potential in inhibiting the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs). In vivo, normoglycemic Swiss male mice treated with Apis mellifera tea (AmT) were subjected to the oral glucose tolerance test and compared with control and metformin-treated groups. Diet-induced diabetic mice were treated for 21 days with AmT and evaluated for glycemia and malondialdehyde levels in the blood, liver, nervous system, and eyes. During interviews, the indigenous people described the use of Apis mellifera bee tea for the treatment of diabetes. In in vitro assays, AmT showed direct antioxidant activity and reduced oxidative hemolysis and malondialdehyde generation in human erythrocytes. The AmT inhibited the formation of AGEs by albumin-fructose pathways and methylglyoxal products. In vivo, after oral glucose overload, normoglycemic mice treated with AmT had reduced hyperglycemia at all times evaluated up to 180 min. AmT also reduced hyperglycemia and malondialdehyde levels in the blood, liver, nervous system, and eyes of diabetic mice to similar levels as those in metformin-treated mice and normoglycemic controls. In summary, Apis mellifera bee tea showed antioxidant, antihyperglycemic, and antidiabetic activity, which provides support for the therapeutic application of Guarani and Kaiowá indigenous knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W2805306834,"The balance between synthesis and degradation of the cartilage extracellular matrix is severely altered in osteoarthritis, where degradation predominates. One reason for this imbalance is believed to be due to the ligation of the α5β1 integrin, the classic fibronectin (FN) receptor, with soluble FN fragments instead of insoluble FN fibrils, which induces matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression. Our objective was to determine whether the lack of α5β1-FN binding influences cartilage morphogenesis in vivo and whether non-ligated α5β1 protects or aggravates the course of osteoarthritis in mice. We engineered mice (Col2a-Cre;Fn1RGE/fl), whose chondrocytes express an α5β1 binding-deficient FN, by substituting the aspartic acid of the RGD cell-binding motif with a glutamic acid (FN-RGE). At an age of 5 months the knee joints were stressed either by forced exercise (moderate mechanical load) or by partially resecting the meniscus followed by forced exercise (high mechanical load). Sections of femoral articular knees were analysed by Safranin-O staining and by immunofluorescence to determine tissue morphology, extracellular matrix proteins and matrix metalloproteinase expression. The articular cartilage from untrained control and Col2a-Cre;Fn1RGE/fl mice was normal, while the exposure to high mechanical load induced osteoarthritis characterized by proteoglycan and collagen type II loss. In the Col2a-Cre;Fn1RGE/fl articular cartilage osteoarthritis progressed significantly faster than in wild type mice. Mechanistically, we observed increased expression of MMP-13 and MMP-3 metalloproteinases in FN-RGE expressing articular cartilage, which severely affected matrix remodelling. Our results underscore the critical role of FN-α5β1 adhesion as ECM sensor in circumstances of articular cartilage regeneration."

Here, crystal structures of a GH family 113 β-1,4-mannanase from Amphibacillus xylanus (AxMan113A) and its complexes with mannobiose, mannotriose, mannopentaose, and mannahexaose were solved. AxMan113A had higher affinity for −1 and +1 mannoses, which explains why the enzyme can hydrolyze mannobiose. At least six subsites (−4 to +2) exist in the groove, but mannose units preferentially occupied subsites −4 to −1 because of steric hindrance formed by Lys-238 and Trp-239.

https://openalex.org/W2806587776,"Degenerative diseases of organs lead to their impaired function. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying organ degeneration are therefore of great research and clinical interest but are currently incompletely characterized. Here, using a forward-genetic screen for genes regulating liver development and function in zebrafish, we identified a cq5 mutant that exhibited a liver-degeneration phenotype at 5 days postfertilization, the developmental stage at which a functional liver develops. Positional cloning revealed that the liver degeneration was caused by a single point mutation in the gene zc3h8 (zinc finger CCCH-type containing 8), changing a highly conserved histidine to glutamine at position 353 of the Zc3h8 protein. The zc3h8 mutation–induced liver degeneration in the mutant was accompanied by reduced proliferation, increased apoptosis, and macrophage phagocytosis of hepatocytes. Transcriptional profile analyses revealed up-regulation and activation of both proinflammatory cytokines and the NF-κB signaling pathway in the zc3h8 mutant. Suppression of NF-κB signaling activity efficiently rescued the proinflammatory cytokine response, as well as the inflammation-mediated liver degeneration phenotype of the mutant. Of note, the zc3h8 mutation-induced degeneration of several other organs, including the gut and exocrine pancreas, indicating that Zc3h8 is a general repressor of inflammation in zebrafish.

Nonreversible damage to liver function results in the death of the affected organism. Thus, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in liver degeneration is essential for the development of novel drug therapies and cures for these diseases. Inflammation is triggered by microbial pathogens or danger signals derived from the host. The receptors of antigen-presenting cells sense microbial products (4.Janeway C.A.

Homozygous cq5 mutants did not show any observable phenotype before 4 dpf (Fig. 1, A, A′, B, and B′) but exhibited a large amount of unabsorbed yolk at 5 dpf (Fig. 1, C and C′). Survival curves showed that the survival rate of the mutants decreased dramatically from 6 dpf on, with all the mutants dead at 13 dpf (Fig. 1E). At 4 dpf, the liver of the mutant remained normal (Fig. 1, F and F′). From 4 to 5 dpf, although the mutant liver continued growing, its outgrowth rate was slower than the WT fish (Fig. 1, F, F′, G, and G′). The cq5 mutant subsequently exhibited degeneration of hepatocytes (Fig. 1, H, H′, I, and I′), displaying a one-third volume of the WT liver at 8 dpf (Fig. 1J). These results demonstrate that mutation of the cq5 mutation is ineffective to the early liver development but does impair liver growth and homeostasis, thus leading to liver degeneration after 4 dpf. Positional cloning identified that the mutation was localized in three candidate genes, fbln7, zc3h8, and itga9, flanked by the markers 1006 and 1023 on the linkage group 13 (LG13) (Fig. S1, A and B). Through sequence analyses of these three candidate cDNAs, we identified a single point mutation in zc3h8 (Fig. 2A).

Collectively, the results of synteny analyses and homologous protein sequence alignment of Zc3h8 in different species (Fig. S1, B and C) revealed that the proteins in all species contained three conserved CCCH-type functional domains, and the mutated histidine in the cq5 mutant was evolutionarily conserved (Fig. 2B). To validate that the cq5 liver degeneration phenotype was caused by the zc3h8 mutation, we generated a Tg(hsp70l:HA-zc3h8-T2A-mCherry)cq43 transgenic line (hereafter referred to as hs:zc3h8) (Fig. S2A), which permitted visualization of red fluorescence after heat shock. Heat shock–induced overexpression of Zc3h8 in the cq5 mutant efficiently rescued the degenerated liver at 6.5 dpf (Fig. S2, B and C). Furthermore, hepatocyte-specific replenishment of WT Zc3h8 using the Tg(fabp10a:HA-zc3h8-T2A-mCherry)cq44 (referred to as fabp10a:zc3h8) transgenic background also efficiently rescued the degenerated liver in the cq5 mutant (Fig. S2, D–H). These results confirm that the liver phenotypes of the cq5 mutant caused by the zc3h8 mutation. Further confirmation was carried out using the transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) technology (23.Huang P. Xiao A. Zhou M. Zhu Z. Lin S. Zhang B. Heritable gene targeting in zebrafish using customized TALENs.Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29 (21822242): 699-70010.1038/nbt.1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) to generate a zc3h8 mutant. Exon 7 was selected as the target of TALEN nuclease, where the cq5 mutation is located (Fig. S3A). Two independent zc3h8 mutant alleles were generated. One allele harbored a 3-bp deletion and a 8-bp insertion (referred to as zc3h8inscq45), leading to disrupted protein sequence from amino acid 351 and a premature stop codon at amino acid 382. The other allele harbored a 10-bp deletion (referred to as zc3h8Δ10cq46), leading to disrupted protein sequence from amino acid 351 and a premature stop codon at amino acid 377 (Fig. S3, B and C). Both zc3h8ins5cq45 and zc3h8Δ10cq46 showed liver degeneration at 6.5 dpf, similar to the cq5 mutant (Fig. S3, D–G). These data validate that the liver degeneration phenotype of cq5 mutant is caused by the zc3h8 mutation. To determine whether the histidine to glutamine switch of Zc3h8 affects the protein stability, the heat shock promoter-driven HA-zc3h8H353Q-T2A-mCherry plasmid that contained the same mutation as the cq5 mutant, as well as the WT HA-zc3h8-T2A-mCherry plasmid, were generated. Similar expression levels of the WT and mutated proteins (Fig. 2C) indicated that the point mutation was ineffective to protein stability of Zc3h8. In situ hybridization and qPCR of zc3h8 showed strong expressions in the brain and eyes and relatively weak expressions in the digestive system at 96 hpf (Fig. 2, D–F). Fluorescent in situ hybridizations (FISHs) confirmed the expression of zc3h8 in hepatocytes (Fig. 2G). These data indicate that zc3h8 is required for the maintenance of liver homeostasis. The balance of cell proliferation and apoptosis affects tissue development and determines organ size (24.Cox A.G. Goessling W. The lure of zebrafish in liver research: regulation of hepatic growth in development and regeneration.Curr. Opin. Genet.

Many previously reported mutants exhibiting smaller livers show low proliferation of hepatocytes (25.Qi F. Song J. Yang H. Gao W. Liu N.A. Zhang B. Lin S.

To determine whether the liver-degenerative phenotype of the cq5 mutant was the result of abnormal cell proliferation or not, EdU incorporation ratios were analyzed. The proliferation rates of mutant hepatocytes remained similar to the control at 4.5 dpf (Fig. 3, A, A′, A″, B, B′, and B″) but were significantly reduced at 5.5 dpf (Fig. 3, C, C′, D, D″, and K). Macrophages play important roles in inflammation, recognition, and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, as well as tissue repair and regeneration (28.Thomas J.A. Pope C. Wojtacha D. Robson A.J. Gordon-Walker T.T. Hartland S. Ramachandran P. Van Deemter M. Hume D.A. Iredale J.P. Forbes S.J. Macrophage therapy for murine liver fibrosis recruits host effector cells improving fibrosis, regeneration, and function.Hepatology. 2011; 53 (21433043): 2003-201510.1002/hep.24315Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). To investigate roles of macrophages in the liver degeneration process, the Tg(fabp10a:mCherry-NTR)cq2 and Tg(mpeg1:EGFP) transgenic backgrounds were applied. Macrophage recruitment to the mutant liver and engulfment of hepatocytes became observed at 5 dpf (Fig. 3, E, E′, F, and F′), which were significantly increased at 6.5 dpf (Fig. 3, G, G′, H, H′, and L). TUNEL assays showed that apoptotic hepatocytes significantly increased in the mutant at 5.5 dpf (Fig. 3, I, I′, I″, J, J′, J″, and M). These data suggest that liver degeneration in the cq5 mutant is contributed by both of the decreased hepatocyte proliferation and increased hepatocyte apoptosis. To explore the regulatory molecules and signaling pathways involved in mutant liver degeneration, we dissected the liver and sorted the Dendra2-positive hepatocytes at two different stages (middle stage at 5.5 dpf and late stage at 7.5 dpf) using the Tg(fabp10a:Dendra2-NTR)cq1 transgenic background (Fig. 4A). Transcriptional profile analyses revealed up-regulation of inflammation-related molecules in the mutant hepatocytes at both middle and late degenerative stages (Fig. 4B). qPCRs verified that expressions of hepatocyte-specific markers (f2, tfa, and ttr) significantly decreased in the zc3h8 mutant (Fig. 4C), whereas expressions of inflammation-related genes increased at both 5.5 and 7.5 dpf (Fig. 4D). These data demonstrated activation of inflammatory responses in the mutant. Treatment of ani-inflammatory drug dexamethasone (Dex) from 4 to 6 dpf partially rescued liver degeneration in the mutant (Fig. 4, E–H), suggesting the inflammatory response as one of the inducers of liver degeneration. NF-κB plays important roles in innate and adaptive responses, inflammation, proliferation, and cellular differentiation (29.Sunami Y. Leithäuser F. Gul S. Fiedler K. Güldiken N. Espenlaub S.

Once it is phosphorylated and activated, NF-κB translocates into the nucleus and up-regulates the transcription of cytokines and chemokines (32.Karin M. NF-κB and cancer: mechanisms and targets.Mol.

To investigate whether the inflammation-induced liver degeneration is mediated by the NF-κB activities, expressions of the active NF-κB components nfkbiaa and nfkbiab were first analyzed. Transcriptional activations of nfkbiaa and nfkbiab were undetectable at 4.5 dpf but became significantly increased at 5.5 dpf (Fig. 5, A, A′, B, B′, C, C′, D, and D′). To obtain additional evidences for the increased presence of activated NF-κB in degenerating hepatocytes, immunostainings of the active NF-κB component, phosphorylated p65 (S276-p65), were performed. Although the hepatic S276-p65 signals in the mutant at 4 dpf remained similar to the WT, nuclear accumulation of S276-p65 steadily increased from 4 to 6 dpf in the mutant liver (Fig. S4, A–F and A′–F′, and Fig. 5, G and G′). Because the number of apoptotic hepatocytes remained unchanged in the mutant at 4.5 dpf (Fig. S4, G–M), activation of the NF-κB signaling occurred prior to the hepatocyte apoptosis in the mutant. Blockade of NF-κB signaling using a chemical inhibitor JSH-23 (34.Koo J.W. Russo S.J. Ferguson D. Nestler E.J. Duman R.S. Nuclear factor-κB is a critical mediator of stress-impaired neurogenesis and depressive behavior.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The reduced proliferation of mutant hepatocytes was not rescued by the treatment of JSH-23 (Fig. 6, F–J). JSH-23 treatment was ineffective to the activation of NF-κB component nfkbiaa in the mutant (Fig. 7, C, C′, D, and D′). However, activations of il1b and mpx at 6.5 dpf in the mutant were efficiently repressed by the JSH-23 (Fig. 7, G, G′, H, H′, K, K′, L, and L′). These data indicate that the NF-κB–mediated inflammation acts as one of the inducers of liver degeneration caused by zc3h8 deficiency.Figure 7Uncontrolled inflammation is induced by activated NF-κB signaling.

Expressions of digestive organ markers (fabp10a, insulin, trypsin, and ifabp) indicated normal liver, pancreas, and gut at 3 dpf (Fig. S5A). At 4 dpf, expressions of trypsin and ifabp started to become weaker in the mutant than in the WT (Fig. S5B). Applications of the Tg(mpeg1:EGFP), Tg(cdh17:EGFP), and Tg(p48:GFP) transgenic backgrounds revealed degenerations of gut and exocrine pancreas from 5 to 7 dpf (Fig. S5, C, D, E–E″, F–F″, G–G″, and H–H″). The degenerated pancreas was partially rescued by the treatment of Dex or JSH-23 (Fig. S6, A and B), suggesting that degenerations of other digestive organs caused by zc3h8 deficiency involve mechanisms similar to liver degeneration. To investigate whether Zc3h8 could act as a general repressor of inflammation, we microinjected Escherichia coli into the circulation at 2 dpf to induce the inflammatory response (35.Hou Y. Sheng Z. Mao X. Li C. Chen J. Zhang J. Huang H. Ruan H. Luo L. Li L. Systemic inoculation of Escherichia coli causes emergency myelopoiesis in zebrafish larval caudal hematopoietic tissue.Sci.

Many previous studies on these proteins have been limited to mammals, and almost no studies have described the functions of CCCH-type zinc finger proteins or the phenotypes of mutants in zebrafish. This report is the first to identify a liver defect-related mutant, cq5, harboring a mutation in zc3h8, which encodes a typical zinc finger protein containing three conserved CCCH-type domains. This mutation resulted in degeneration of the zebrafish liver, gut, and pancreas. Further investigation revealed roles of Zc3h8 in maintaining hepatocyte metabolism through inhibition of proinflammatory responses in zebrafish. To determine the function of the zc3h8 gene in zebrafish, the results of systemic gene analysis and homologous protein sequence alignment were evaluated, which indicated that zc3h8 of fish may exhibit the conserved functions of zc3h6 and zc3h8 in mammals (humans and mice). However, no clear function has been reported for zc3h6 in humans and mice. Another homologous gene of zc3h8 in mice (fetal liver zinc-finger protein 1, Fliz1) has been reported to be expressed in the fetal mouse liver (39.Dahm K. Nielsen P.J. Müller A.M.

Of note, stimulation of endogenous USF-1 by UV-mediated activation increased ILEI expression, whereas shRNA-mediated USF-1 knockdown decreased ILEI gene transcription. Finally, we report that knocking down USF-1 decreases tumor cell migration.

EMT is a cell-biological process in which epithelial cells with apical–basal polarity undergo cytoskeletal rearrangement to become motile mesenchymal cells (17.Nieto M.A. Huang R.Y. Jackson R.A.

This process is thought to contribute to chemoresistance and metastasis. Although melanoma cells do not undergo a traditional EMT, they utilize a similar process known as phenotype switching.

Additionally, we showed that phenotype switching between the proliferative MITF-high and invasive MITF-low state modulates ILEI mRNA expression. The molecular regulation of ILEI has focused on post-transcriptional mechanisms including translational regulation by hnRNP-E1–TGF-β and proteolytic processing by plasmin (26.Song Q. Sheng W.

However, not much is known about transcriptional regulation of ILEI. Here, we report that ILEI contributes to melanoma cell line invasiveness in vivo and build on our previous finding that vemurafenib (BRAFi) decreases ILEI mRNA expression to characterize the molecular details of ILEI transcriptional regulation by USF-1 (25.Noguchi K. Dalton A.C. Howley B.V. McCall B.J. Yoshida A. Diehl J.A. Howe P.H. Interleukin-like EMT inducer regulates partial phenotype switching in MITF-low melanoma cell lines.PLoS ONE. 2017; 12 (28545079): e017783010.1371/journal.pone.0177830Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Previously we found that knockdown of ILEI contributes to melanoma invasiveness in vitro, whereas ILEI had no effect on proliferation (25.Noguchi K. Dalton A.C. Howley B.V. McCall B.J. Yoshida A. Diehl J.A. Howe P.H. Interleukin-like EMT inducer regulates partial phenotype switching in MITF-low melanoma cell lines.PLoS ONE. 2017; 12 (28545079): e017783010.1371/journal.pone.0177830Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Here we used the same ILEI-modulated cell lines and conducted in vivo flank and tail vein injections to measure primary tumor formation or lung colonization, respectively. In the flank injection experiment we found no significant difference in primary tumor growth (Fig. 1, A and B), but we observed in the tail vein injection experiment that ILEI knockdown significantly attenuated lung colonization (Fig. 1C). We did not observe a difference in the size of the lung colonies formed by either shSCR or shILEI cell lines, suggesting that the ability to invade the lung was affected rather than the ability to grow metastatic colonies in the lung (Fig. 1D). Based on these results we conclude that ILEI specifically regulates melanoma invasiveness in vivo without affecting primary tumor growth. To date there are three known mechanisms of ILEI regulation: the first is translational regulation of ILEI by TGF-β–AKT2–hnRNP-E1, the second is degradation of ILEI by the ubiquitin/proteasome system, and the third is an autophagy-mediated increase in ILEI protein expression (16.Waerner T.

Nothing has been reported about the mechanistic basis of ILEI transcription. None of the previously established mechanisms appears to be responsible for ILEI regulation by vemurafenib (25.Noguchi K. Dalton A.C. Howley B.V. McCall B.J. Yoshida A. Diehl J.A. Howe P.H. Interleukin-like EMT inducer regulates partial phenotype switching in MITF-low melanoma cell lines.PLoS ONE. 2017; 12 (28545079): e017783010.1371/journal.pone.0177830Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Herein, we sought to determine the mechanism of ILEI transcriptional regulation. First, we treated WM983B melanoma cell lines with vemurafenib, an inhibitor of V600E BRAF, and observed that ILEI protein and mRNA expression decreased at 24 h (Fig. 2, A and B) (25.Noguchi K. Dalton A.C. Howley B.V. McCall B.J. Yoshida A. Diehl J.A. Howe P.H. Interleukin-like EMT inducer regulates partial phenotype switching in MITF-low melanoma cell lines.PLoS ONE. 2017; 12 (28545079): e017783010.1371/journal.pone.0177830Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We also conducted RT-PCR using primers targeting an intronic sequence of ILEI to amplify ILEI pre-RNA (Fig. 2B). If ILEI mRNA levels are regulated post-transcriptionally by miRNAs, we expect that ILEI pre-RNA should not be affected by vemurafenib. However, if ILEI mRNA levels are regulated transcriptionally, we expect that ILEI pre-RNA should go down upon vemurafenib treatment. We saw that vemurafenib treatment decreased both ILEI total RNA and pre-RNA, suggesting that vemurafenib affected ILEI transcription (Fig. 2B). To confirm that these findings were not due to off-target effects of vemurafenib we conducted a control experiment in which we used the BRAF WT WM3918 melanoma cells. Vemurafenib is a specific inhibitor of mutant BRAF, and it does not affect WT BRAF (34.Tsai J. Lee J.T. Wang W. Zhang J. Cho H. Mamo S. Bremer R. Gillette S. Kong J. Haass N.K. Sproesser K. Li L. Smalley K.S. Fong D. Zhu Y.L. et al.Discovery of a selective inhibitor of oncogenic B-Raf kinase with potent antimelanoma activity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105 (18287029): 3041-304610.1073/pnas.0711741105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). Therefore, we treated BRAF WT WM3918 melanoma cells with vemurafenib, which should retain all the nonspecific effects of vemurafenib without the BRAF-specific effects. We found that vemurafenib did not affect ILEI protein expression or ERK phosphorylation in BRAF WT WM3918 melanoma cells (Fig. 2C). We confirmed these findings by a quantitative method using real-time qPCR and found that vemurafenib decreased ILEI expression in BRAF mutant 501-Mel and 1205Lu cells but not in BRAF WT WM3918 cells (Fig. 2D). Considering that ILEI is a secreted cytokine, we wanted to confirm the physiological relevance of vemurafenib-mediated ILEI inhibition by conducting immunoblot analysis of the conditioned medium. These results confirmed that vemurafenib decreased secreted ILEI levels (Fig. 2E). Finally, to further determine whether this effect is specific for the MEK pathway we used a second inhibitor of the MEK pathway (U0126, MEKi) and observed decreased ILEI expression by U0126 (Fig. 2F). Based on these results we conclude that vemurafenib inhibits ILEI mRNA expression, and that this effect depends on the presence of oncogenic BRAF V600E mutation. We cloned the ILEI promoter from 2,300 bp upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) to 80 bp upstream of the TSS into pBV-Luc (Fig. 3A) (35.He T.C. Chan T.A. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. PPARdelta is an APC-regulated target of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.Cell. 1999; 99 (10555149): 335-34510.1016/S0092-8674(00)81664-5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). We transfected 501-Mel cells with the ILEI promoter luciferase reporter construct along with a control Renilla construct and treated the cells with vemurafenib (Fig. 3B). We found that vemurafenib decreased the ILEI promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. As further controls we tested the ILEI promoter construct with the MEK inhibitor U0126 and found that U0126 decreased promoter activity (Fig. 3C). However, when we tested the ILEI promoter construct with the PI3K inhibitor LY-294002, we found that promoter activity was not affected (Fig. 3D). Additionally, we cloned the ILEI 3′-UTR from the stop codon to the end of the mRNA at 1,620 bp into pmirGLO Dual Luciferase (Fig. 3E). We transfected 501-Mel cells with the ILEI 3′-UTR construct and treated the cells with vemurafenib (Fig. 3F). We found that vemurafenib did not affect the ILEI 3′-UTR construct. From these experiments we concluded that vemurafenib regulates ILEI mRNA at the transcriptional level. Because vemurafenib regulates ILEI transcription, we hypothesized that a cis element in the ILEI promoter region regulates this phenomenon. We analyzed a 2,300-bp sequence at the ILEI promoter from the TSS for various transcription factor motifs using the JASPAR database (36.Mathelier A. Fornes O. Arenillas D.J. Chen C.Y. Denay G. Lee J.

Previously we had found that ILEI is highly expressed in MITF-low invasive melanoma cell lines, so we focused our transcription factor search on regulators of the MITF-low invasive state (E-box (ZEB1/2), JUN, and TEAD4) (20.Ramsdale R.

We found 11 putative E-box, 5 JUN, and 3 TEAD4 sites in the ILEI promoter, and generated successive 5′-deletions of the ILEI promoter reporter (Fig. 4A). We transfected 501-Mel cells with these constructs and observed that the truncation from −204 to −150 reduced the luciferase activity to empty promoter control levels. There was an E-box motif in this region, so we next wanted to know if this E-box was specifically important for ILEI promoter activity or if any E-box would suffice. Thus, we used our longest ILEI promoter reporter (−2300 to −80) and specifically mutated the E-box consensus site at −163 from CACGTG to CAAATG. Again, we observed a marked inhibition in luciferase activity (Fig. 4B). From these experiments we concluded that an E-box 163 bp upstream of the ILEI TSS is critical to basal ILEI promoter activity. Next, we wanted to know the role of this E-box motif in the vemurafenib-mediated regulation of ILEI expression. We transfected 501-Mel cells with the ILEI promoter truncation constructs and treated the cells with vemurafenib (Fig. 5A). We found that truncation of bp −204 to −150, which includes an E-box motif, eliminated ILEI promoter vemurafenib responsiveness. The −204 to −150 region of the ILEI promoter contains 48 bp in addition to the E-box, so we mutated the E-box in the −300/−80 construct. We sequenced the construct and analyzed the sequence in the JASPAR database to find that our mutations abolished all putative binding sites in this region (data not shown). We conducted luciferase assays and observed that mutation of the E-box similarly eliminated vemurafenib responsiveness (Fig. 5B). From these experiments we concluded that vemurafenib inhibits ILEI at the transcriptional level through an E-box 163 bp upstream of the ILEI TSS. Considering the importance of the E-box motif to ILEI expression, we wanted to identify the trans-acting factor regulating this effect. To this end, we overexpressed different transcription factors known to bind E-box motifs and found that USF-1 induced ILEI promoter activity, but not c-MYC, N-MYC, l-MYC, TFEB, TFE3, MITF, CREB3L2, and ID2 (Fig. 6A). USF-1 activates transcription through the E-box motif, but also through a pyrimidine-rich in"
https://openalex.org/W2805254970,"Human tyrosinase (hTyr) is a Type 1 membrane bound glycoenzyme that catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting steps of melanin production in the melanosome. Mutations in the Tyr gene are linked to oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1), an autosomal recessive disorder. Currently, the application of enzyme replacement therapy for a treatment of OCA1 is hampered by the absence of pure hTyr. Here, full-length hTyr (residues 1-529) was overexpressed in Trichoplusia ni larvae infected with a baculovirus, solubilized with detergent and purified using chromatography. Michaelis-Menten kinetics, enzymatic specific activity, and analytical ultracentrifugation were used to compare the hTyr in detergent with the soluble recombinant intra-melanosomal domain, hTyrCtr (residues 19-469). Active hTyr is monomeric in detergent micelles suggesting no stable interactions between protein molecules. Both, hTyr and hTyrCtr, exhibited similar enzymatic activity and ligand affinity in L-DOPA and L-Tyrosine reactions. In addition, expression in larvae is a scalable process that will allow high yield protein production. Thus, larval production of enzymatically active human tyrosinase potentially could be a useful tool in developing a cure for OCA1."
https://openalex.org/W2806760773,"Background Understanding and meeting the reproductive health needs of adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) is a growing concern since advances in antiretroviral therapy mean that many ALHIV are now living into adulthood and starting to have sex. Methods We conducted a mixed-methods study in the Copperbelt Province of Zambia to advance our understanding of the reproductive health needs of ALHIV and to assess the extent to which these needs are being met. We conducted in-depth interviews (IDIs) with 32 ALHIV from two HIV clinics, 23 with their caregivers, and 10 with clinic staff. ALHIV were interviewed twice. We used the data from the qualitative interviews to create a cross-sectional survey that we conducted with 312 ALHIV in three HIV clinics. Findings The vast majority of ALHIV reported they wanted to have children in the future but lacked knowledge about preventing mother-to-child transmission. Some sexually active adolescents used condoms, although they wanted more information about and access to non-condom methods. Many ALHIV reported that their first sexual encounters were forced. Religious beliefs prevented some caregivers from discussing premarital sex and contraception with ALHIV. Clinic staff and caregivers had mixed views about integrating contraceptive counseling and method provision into HIV care and treatment services. Few sexually active ALHIV reported that they disclosed their HIV status to their sexual partners and few reported that they knew their sexual partner’s status. Conclusions ALHIV are in dire need of comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services and information including a range of contraceptive methods to prevent pregnancy, knowledge about preventing mother-to-child transmission and having a healthy pregnancy, skills related to HIV disclosure and condom negotiation to prevent horizontal transmission, and screening for sexual violence for both males and females if services are available."
https://openalex.org/W2807018990,"Myosin binding protein-C slow (sMyBP-C) comprises a family of accessory proteins in skeletal muscles that bind both myosin and actin filaments. Herein, we examined the role of sMyBP-C in adult skeletal muscles using in vivo gene transfer and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats technology to knock down all known sMyBP-C variants. Our findings, confirmed in two different skeletal muscles, demonstrated efficient knockdown (KD) of sMyBP-C (>70%) resulting in notably decreased levels of thick, but not thin, filament proteins ranging from ∼50% for slow and fast myosin to ∼20% for myomesin. Consistent with this, A bands were selectively distorted, and sarcomere length was significantly reduced. Contrary to earlier in vitro studies showing that addition of recombinant sMyBP-C slows down the formation of actomyosin crossbridges, our work demonstrates that KD of sMyBP-C in intact myofibers results in decreased contraction and relaxation kinetics under no-load conditions. Similarly, KD muscles develop markedly reduced twitch and tetanic force and contraction velocity. Taken together, our results show that sMyBP-C is essential for the regular organization and maintenance of myosin filaments into A bands and that its structural role precedes its ability to regulate actomyosin crossbridges.-Geist, J., Ward, C. W., Kontrogianni-Konstantopoulos, A. Structure before function: myosin binding protein-C slow is a structural protein with regulatory properties."

https://openalex.org/W2806651298,"Thyroid hormone (TH) signaling has been shown to regulate cone photoreceptor viability. Suppression of TH signaling with antithyroid drug treatment or by targeting iodothyronine deiodinases and TH receptors preserves cones in mouse models of retinal degeneration, including the Leber congenital amaurosis Rpe65-deficient mice. This work investigates the cellular mechanisms underlying how suppressing TH signaling preserves cones in Rpe65-deficient mice, using mice deficient in type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio2), the enzyme that converts the prohormone thyroxine to the active hormone triiodothyronine (T3). Deficiency of Dio2 improved cone survival and function in Rpe65-/- and Rpe65-deficiency on a cone dominant background ( Rpe65-/-/ Nrl-/-) mice. Analysis of cell death pathways revealed that receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase (RIPK)/necroptosis activity was increased in Rpe65-/-/ Nrl-/- retinas, and Dio2 deficiency reversed the alterations. Cell-stress analysis showed that the cellular oxidative stress responses were increased in Rpe65-/-/ Nrl-/- retinas, and Dio2 deficiency abolished the elevations. Similarly, antithyroid drug treatment resulted in reduced RIPK/necroptosis activity and oxidative stress responses in Rpe65-/-/ Nrl-/- retinas. Moreover, treatment with T3 significantly induced RIPK/necroptosis activity and oxidative stress responses in the retina. This work shows that suppression of TH signaling reduces cellular RIPK/necroptosis activity and oxidative stress responses in degenerating retinas, suggesting a mechanism underlying the observed cone preservation.-Yang, F., Ma, H., Butler, M. R., Ding, X.-Q. Deficiency of type 2 iodothyronine deiodinase reduces necroptosis activity and oxidative stress responses in retinas of Leber congenital amaurosis model mice."
https://openalex.org/W2805116301,"Host Defense Peptides (HDPs) such as cathelicidins are multifunctional effectors of the innate immune system with both antimicrobial and pleiotropic immunomodulatory functions. Chicken cathelicidin-2 (CATH-2) has multiple immunomodulatory effects in vitro and the D-amino acid analog of this peptide has been shown to partially protect young chicks from a bacterial infection. However, the mechanisms responsible for CATH-2 mediated in vivo protection have not been investigated so far. In this study, D-CATH-2 was administered in ovo and the immune status and microbiota of the chicks were investigated at 7 days posthatch to elucidate the in vivo mechanisms of the peptide. In three consecutive studies, no effects on numbers and functions of immune cells were found and only small changes were seen in gene expression of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs). In two studies, intestinal microbiota composition was determined which was highly variable, suggesting that it was strongly influenced by environmental factors. In both studies, in ovo D-CATH-2 treatment caused significant reduction of Ruminococcaceae and Butyricicoccus in the cecum and Escherichia/Shigella in both ileum and cecum. In conclusion, this study shows that, in the absence of an infectious stimulus, in ovo administration of a CATH-2 analog alters the microbiota composition but does not affect the chicks' immune system posthatch."

https://openalex.org/W2805619202,"Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal propagule bank could facilitate the regeneration and plantation of seedlings in disturbed area. In this study, Masson pine (Pinus massoniana) seedlings were used to bait the ECM fungal propagule bank buried in the soils collected from a manganese (Mn) mine wasteland and a non-polluted area in China. After 6-month growth, we found the seedlings grown in the Mn mine soil (Mn:3200 mg kg-1) did not display any toxicity symptoms. Based on morphotyping and ITS-PCR sequencing, we identified a total of 16 ECM fungal OTUs (operative taxonomic units) at 97% similarity threshold, among which 11 OTUs were recovered in the Mn mine soils and 14 in the non-polluted soil. Two soil types shared 9 OTUs and both of them were dominated by a Tylospora sp. Based on those soil propagule banks in Masson pine forests reported in previous, we speculated that some Atheliaceae species may be preferred in the soil propagule bank of some pine species, such as Masson pine. In addition, NMDS ordination displayed geographical position effects on soil propagule banks in five Masson pine forest from three sites at regional scale. In conclusion, Masson pine ECM seedlings could grow well in the Mn wasteland as a suitable tree species used for reforestation application in Mn mineland, in addition, Mn pollution did not alter the dominant ECM fungal species in the soil propagule banks."
https://openalex.org/W2805784853,"Background Recent studies have shown that the microbiome, namely Aspergillus species, play a previously unrecognized role in both stable and exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Galactomannan is a major component of the Aspergillus cell wall that has been widely used as a diagnostic marker. Objectives To explore whether serum levels of Aspergillus-galactomannan antigen could be used to evaluate the risk of severe acute exacerbation of COPD (AE-COPD). Methods We measured the Aspergillus-galactomannan antigen levels of 191 patients with stable COPD, and examined its clinical relevance including AE-COPD. Results There were 77 (40.3%) patients who were positive for serum Aspergillus-galactomannan antigen (≥0.5). High Aspergillus-galactomannan antigen level (≥0.7) was associated with older age and presence of bronchiectasis and cysts on computed tomography images. Compared to patients with low Aspergillus-galactomannan antigen level (<0.7), patients with high Aspergillus-galactomannan antigen level had significantly higher incidence of severe AE-COPD (P = 0.0039, Gray’s test) and respiratory-related mortality (P = 0.0176, log-rank test). Multivariate analysis showed that high Aspergillus-galactomannan antigen level was independently associated with severe AE-COPD (hazard ratio, 2.162; 95% confidence interval, 1.267−3.692; P = 0.005). Conclusion Serum Aspergillus-galactomannan antigen was detected in patients with COPD, and elevated serum Aspergillus-galactomannan antigen was associated with severe AE-COPD."
https://openalex.org/W2806063971,"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 may act in an error-prone pathway called alternative end joining (Alt-EJ) for DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair when nonhomologous end joining is defective. We examined the recruitment of PARP-1 to chromatin in response to radiomimetic agents and the effects of PARP-1 inhibition on DSB repair and recruitment of the meiotic recombination (MRE)-11-double-strand break repair (RAD50) protein-Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NSB)-1 (MRN) complex to the chromatin in Ku70-deficient breast cancer cells. The chromatin-binding affinity of PARP-1 was enhanced in response to neocarzinostatin (NCS) or ca- licheamicin treatment in the absence of Ku70. PARP-1 inhibition impaired the repair of both NCS-induced DSBs and intron-encoded endonuclease from Physarumpolycephalum-induced site-specific DSB. Both fractionation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that chromatin recruitment of MRN was PARP-1 dependent. These data suggest that PARP-1 is vital for DSB repair in breast cancer cells when Alt-EJ is activated.—Huang, Y., Shao, Q., Luo, X., Yang, D., Zeng, B., Xiang, T., Ren, G., Cheng, Q.

https://openalex.org/W2806873924,"Proper arteriovenous morphogenesis is crucial for maintaining normal tissue perfusion. However, our understanding of how arterial morphogenesis is regulated in the CNS is incomplete. In this study, we asked whether vascular basement membrane (BM) laminins, specifically the γ3-containing isoforms, regulate retinal arterial morphogenesis. We provide evidence that Laminin-γ3 is deposited at both arterial and venous BMs during arteriogenesis. Vascular BM Laminin-γ3 bound dystroglycan (DG), a laminin receptor preferentially expressed by arterial endothelial cells (ECs) during arteriogenesis. Blockade of laminin-DG binding in vitro led to decreased Delta-like ligand (DLL)-4 expression in ECs. Moreover, genetic deletion of the Laminin-γ3- and EC-specific deletion of DG led to similar defects in retinal arteriogenesis, including reduced Dll4 expression, hyperbranching and reduced smooth muscle coverage. These results implicate a newly identified Laminin-γ3-DG signaling cascade that regulates arterial Dll4/Notch signaling to specify and stabilize retinal arteries.-Biswas, S., Watters, J., Bachay, G., Varshney, S., Hunter, D.

https://openalex.org/W2806429082,"Enzastaurin is a Protein Kinase C-β selective inhibitor that was developed to treat cancers. Protein Kinase C-β is an important enzyme for a variety of neuronal functions; in particular, previous rodent studies have reported deficits in spatial and fear-conditioned learning and memory with lower levels of Protein Kinase C-β. Due to Enzastaurin’s mechanism of action, the present study investigated the consequences of Enzastaurin exposure on learning and memory in 12-month-old Fischer-344 male rats. Rats were treated daily with subcutaneous injections of either vehicle or Enzastaurin, and behaviorally tested using the spatial reference memory Morris Water Maze. Rats treated with Enzastaurin exhibited decreased overnight retention and poorer performance on the latter testing day, indicating a mild, but significant, memory impairment. There were no differences during the probe trial indicating that all animals were able to spatially localize the platform to the proper quadrant by the end of testing. RNA isolated from the hippocampus was analyzed using Next Generation Sequencing (Illumina). No statistically significant transcriptional differences were noted. Our findings suggest that acute Enzastaurin treatment can impair hippocampal-based learning and memory performance, with no effects on transcription in the hippocampus. We propose that care should be taken in future clinical trials that utilize Protein Kinase C-ß inhibitors, to monitor for possible cognitive effects, future research should examine if these effects are fully reversible."
