https://openalex.org/W3114642149,"Background People with disabilities face multiple barriers that prevent them from accessing care and essential information related to the COVID-19 pandemic that poses additional stress and psychopathology. Therefore, the investigation of psychopathologies during the COVID-19 outbreak and emergency response is critical. Methods A cross-sectional survey was implemented from July 15/2020 to July 30/2020. The PHQ-9, GAD-7 scale, insomnia severity index-7, and brief resilient coping scale were administered to participants. The collected data was then entered into Epi-data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS-20 for analysis. Descriptive statistical procedures were employed to describe the various psychopathologies. A binary logistic regression method was used to identify the related factors for the psychopathologies. Furthermore, an odds ratio with its 95%CI was driven to show association strength, and a P-value &lt;0.05 was declared as statistically significant. Results A significant proportion of individuals living with disability had psychopathologies; 46.2% for depression symptoms, 48.1% for generalized anxiety disorder symptoms, and 71% for insomnia symptoms. Nearly 45.7% of participants were low resilient copers to their psychopathology. Depression was significantly higher in divorced/widowed/separated (AOR = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.28–8.92, P-value = 0.006), non-educated (AOR = 2.12, 95% CI: 1.12, 5.90, P-value = 0.001), and unemployed (AOR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.32, 5.11, P-value = 0.005) as well as a daily laborer (AOR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.20, 4.89, P-value = 0.014) subjects. Generalized anxiety disorder was also significantly higher in young age (&lt;40 years) (AOR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.32, 2.98, P-value = 0.02), single (AOR = 2.3, 95% CI: 1.24, 5.3, P-value = 0.011), widowed/divorced/separated (AOR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.12, 2.78, P-value = 0.032), preparatory school completed (AOR = 3.00, 95% CI: 1.59, 5.46, P-value = 0.001), daily laborer (AOR = 2.7, 95% CI: 1.21, 5.23, P-value = 0.003), and unemployed (AOR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.17, 4.78, P-value = 0.005) participants. Moreover, insomnia was significantly higher in single (AOR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.12, 3.09, P-value = 0.027), divorced/widowed/separated(AOR = 6.2, 95% CI: 1.08, 11.29, P-value = 0.032), unemployed (AOR = 3.00, 95% CI: 1.22, 7.03, P-value = 0.001), blind (AOR = 2.8, 95% CI: 1.42, 6.35, P-value = 0.001), and deaf (AOR = 10.2, 95% CI: 4.52, 35.33, P-value = 0.002) participants. Conclusion Depression, anxiety, and insomnia were highly prevalent among individuals with a disability during the COVID-19 period. Multiple sociodemographic and disability-related factors were associated with this high psychopathology. Attention has to be given by the government and other stakeholders to intervene in psychopathology and its associated factors."
https://openalex.org/W3114839072,"Background Various factors may determine the duration of viral shedding (the time from infection to viral RNA-negative conversion or recovery) in COVID-19 patients. Understanding the average duration of recovery and its predictors is crucial in formulating preventive measures and optimizing treatment options. Therefore, evidence showing the duration of recovery from COVID-19 in different contexts and settings is necessary for tailoring appropriate treatment and prevention measures. This study aimed to investigate the average duration and the predictors of recovery from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection among COVID-19 patients. Method A hospital-based prospective cohort study was conducted at Eka Kotebe General Hospital, COVID-19 Isolation and Treatment Center from March 18 to June 27, 2020. The Center was the first hospital designated to manage COVID-19 cases in Ethiopia. The study participants were all COVID-19 adult patients who were admitted to the center during the study period. Follow up was done for the participants from the first date of diagnosis to the date of recovery (negative Real-time Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCT) test of throat swab). Result A total of 306 COVID-19 cases were followed up to observe the duration of viral clearance by rRT-PCR. Participants’ mean age was 34 years (18–84 years) and 69% were male. The median duration of viral clearance from each participant’s body was 19 days, but the range was wide: 2 to 71 days. Cough followed by headache was the leading sign of illness among the 67 symptomatic COVID-19 patients; and nearly half of those with comorbidities were known cancer and HIV/AIDS patients on clinical follow up. The median duration of recovery from COVID-19 was different for those with and without previous medical conditions or comorbidities. The rate of recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection was 36% higher in males than in females (p = 0.043, CI: 1.01, 1.85). The rate of recovery was 93% higher in those with at least one comorbidity than in those without any comorbidity. The risk of delayed recovery was not influenced by blood type, BMI and presence of signs or symptoms. The findings showed that study participants without comorbidities recovered more quickly than those with at least one comorbidity. Therefore, isolation and treatment centers should be prepared to manage the delayed stay of patients having comorbidity."
https://openalex.org/W3116867541,"Livestock keepers in sub-Saharan Africa face a range of pressures, including climate change, land loss, restrictive policies, and population increase. Widespread adaptation in response can lead to the emergence of new, non-traditional typologies of livestock production. We sought to characterise livestock production systems in two administrative regions in northern Tanzania, an area undergoing rapid social, economic, and environmental change. Questionnaire and spatial data were collected from 404 livestock-keeping households in 21 villages in Arusha and Manyara Regions in 2016. Multiple factor analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis were used to classify households into livestock production systems based on household-level characteristics. Adversity-based indicators of vulnerability, including reports of hunger, illness, and livestock, land and crop losses were compared between production systems. Three distinct clusters emerged through this process. The ethnic, environmental and livestock management characteristics of households in each cluster broadly mapped onto traditional definitions of ‘pastoral’, ‘agro-pastoral’ and ‘smallholder’ livestock production in the study area, suggesting that this quantitative classification system is complementary to more qualitative classification methods. Our approach allowed us to demonstrate a diversity in typologies of livestock production at small spatial scales, with almost half of study villages comprising more than one production system. We also found indicators of change within livestock production systems, most notably the adoption of crop agriculture in the majority of pastoral households. System-level heterogeneities in vulnerability were evident, with agro-pastoral households most likely to report hunger and pastoral households most likely to report illness in people and livestock, and livestock losses. We demonstrate that livestock production systems can provide context for assessing household vulnerability in northern Tanzania. Policy initiatives to improve household and community well-being should recognise the continuing diversity of traditional livestock production systems in northern Tanzania, including the diversity that can exist at small spatial scales."
https://openalex.org/W3113789352,"In the field of fluorescence microscopy, there is continued demand for dynamic technologies that can exploit the complete information from every pixel of an image. One imaging technique with proven ability for yielding additional information from fluorescence imaging is Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM). FLIM allows for the measurement of how long a fluorophore stays in an excited energy state, and this measurement is affected by changes in its chemical microenvironment, such as proximity to other fluorophores, pH, and hydrophobic regions. This ability to provide information about the microenvironment has made FLIM a powerful tool for cellular imaging studies ranging from metabolic measurement to measuring distances between proteins. The increased use of FLIM has necessitated the development of computational tools for integrating FLIM analysis with image and data processing. To address this need, we have created FLIMJ, an ImageJ plugin and toolkit that allows for easy use and development of extensible image analysis workflows with FLIM data. Built on the FLIMLib decay curve fitting library and the ImageJ Ops framework, FLIMJ offers FLIM fitting routines with seamless integration with many other ImageJ components, and the ability to be extended to create complex FLIM analysis workflows. Building on ImageJ Ops also enables FLIMJ’s routines to be used with Jupyter notebooks and integrate naturally with science-friendly programming in, e.g., Python and Groovy. We show the extensibility of FLIMJ in two analysis scenarios: lifetime-based image segmentation and image colocalization. We also validate the fitting routines by comparing them against industry FLIM analysis standards."
https://openalex.org/W3116587641,"The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the world in 2020 by spreading at unprecedented rates and causing tens of thousands of fatalities within a few months. The number of deaths dramatically increased in regions where the number of patients in need of hospital care exceeded the availability of care. Many COVID-19 patients experience Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a condition that can be treated with mechanical ventilation. In response to the need for mechanical ventilators, designed and tested an emergency ventilator (EV) that can control a patient’s peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) and breathing rate, while keeping a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP). This article describes the rapid design, prototyping, and testing of the EV. The development process was enabled by rapid design iterations using additive manufacturing (AM). In the initial design phase, iterations between design, AM, and testing enabled a working prototype within one week. The designs of the 16 different components of the ventilator were locked by additively manufacturing and testing a total of 283 parts having parametrically varied dimensions. In the second stage, AM was used to produce 75 functional prototypes to support engineering evaluation and animal testing. The devices were tested over more than two million cycles. We also developed an electronic monitoring system and with automatic alarm to provide for safe operation, along with training materials and user guides. The final designs are available online under a free license. The designs have been transferred to more than 70 organizations in 15 countries. This project demonstrates the potential for ultra-fast product design, engineering, and testing of medical devices needed for COVID-19 emergency response."
https://openalex.org/W3117940886,"Background Global health security (GHS) and universal health coverage (UHC) are key global health agendas which aspire for a healthier and safer world. However, there are tensions between GHS and UHC strategy and implementation. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between GHS and UHC using two recent quantitative indices. Methods We conducted a macro-analysis to determine the presence of relationship between GHS index (GHSI) and UHC index (UHCI). We calculated Pearson’s correlation coefficient and the coefficient of determination. Analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 25 with a 95% level of confidence. Findings There is a moderate and significant relationship between GHSI and UHCI (r = 0.662, p&lt;0.001) and individual indices of UHCI (maternal and child health and infectious diseases: r = 0.623 (p&lt;0.001) and 0.594 (p&lt;0.001), respectively). However, there is no relationship between GHSI and the non-communicable diseases (NCDs) index (r = 0.063, p&gt;0.05). The risk of GHS threats a significant and negative correlation with the capacity for GHS (r = -0.604, p&lt;0.001) and the capacity for UHC (r = -0.792, p&lt;0.001). Conclusion The aspiration for GHS will not be realized without UHC; hence, the tension between these two global health agendas should be transformed into a synergistic solution. We argue that strengthening the health systems, in tandem with the principles of primary health care, and implementing a “One Health” approach will progressively enable countries to achieve both UHC and GHS towards a healthier and safer world that everyone aspires to live in."
https://openalex.org/W3114329787,"In recent years, metabarcoding has become a key tool to describe microbial communities from natural and artificial environments. Thanks to its high throughput nature, metabarcoding efficiently explores microbial biodiversity under different conditions. It can be performed on environmental (e)DNA to describe so-called total microbial community, or from environmental (e)RNA to describe active microbial community. As opposed to total microbial communities, active ones exclude dead or dormant organisms. For what concerns Fungi, which are mostly filamentous microorganisms, the relationship between DNA-based (total) and RNA-based (active) communities is unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the consequences of performing metabarcoding on both soil and wood-extracted eDNA and eRNA to delineate molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) and differentiate fungal communities according to the environment they originate from. DNA and RNA-based communities differed not only in their taxonomic composition, but also in the relative abundances of several functional guilds. From a taxonomic perspective, we showed that several higher taxa are globally more represented in either “active” or “total” microbial communities. We also observed that delineation of MOTUs based on their co-occurrence among DNA and RNA sequences highlighted differences between the studied habitats that were overlooked when all MOTUs were considered, including those identified exclusively by eDNA sequences. We conclude that metabarcoding on eRNA provides original functional information on the specific roles of several taxonomic or functional groups that would not have been revealed using eDNA alone."
https://openalex.org/W3115524272,"In this study, we aimed to evaluate the fruit quality of Prunus humilis and identify cultivars that could provide superior human health benefits. We measured the basic characteristics, bioactive compounds, and antioxidant capacities of 137 P . humilis accessions. Flavonoid and phenol content were determined via colorimetry and ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography. Single fruit and stone weights varied widely and were genetically diverse among accessions. The variation in soluble solid content was comparatively narrow. Total flavonoid content (TFC) ranged from 3.90 to 28.37 mg/g FW, with an average of 10.58 mg/g FW in 2019. Significant differences between accessions in terms of TFC, total phenol content, and antioxidant capacity were found. TFC in the accessions was normally distributed and predominantly in the medium range (9.57–15.23 mg/g FW). Red was the predominant peel color over all other phenotypes (i.e., dark red, red, light red, red-orange, and yellow). There was no obvious correlation between peel color and TFC. Catechin was the major flavonoid component in the fruit. Principal component analysis showed that TFC, ABTS, single fruit weight, and vertical and horizontal diameter contributed to the first two principal components for each accession. Accessions 10–02, 3-17-2, 3-17-4, and JD1-6-7-37 were characterized by high TFC, ABTS, and large fruit. We believe that our results will aid in the breeding and functional food processing of Prunus humilis ."
https://openalex.org/W3115871348,"Reproducibility in the statistical analyses of data from high-throughput phenotyping screens requires a robust and reliable analysis foundation that allows modelling of different possible statistical scenarios. Regular challenges are scalability and extensibility of the analysis software. In this manuscript, we describe OpenStats, a freely available software package that addresses these challenges. We show the performance of the software in a high-throughput phenomic pipeline in the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) and compare the agreement of the results with the most similar implementation in the literature. OpenStats has significant improvements in speed and scalability compared to existing software packages including a 13-fold improvement in computational time to the current production analysis pipeline in the IMPC. Reduced complexity also promotes FAIR data analysis by providing transparency and benefiting other groups in reproducing and re-usability of the statistical methods and results.

https://openalex.org/W3115878331,"Introduction Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) and infection (DFI) are a major diabetes-related problem around the world due to the high prevalence of diabetes in the population. The aim of our study was to determine the microbiological profile of infected ulcers in patients attending Dasman Diabetes Institute (DDI) clinics in Kuwait and to analyze the distribution of microbial isolates according to wound grade, sex, age and diabetes control. Methods We collected and analyzed clinical data and samples from 513 diabetic patients with foot ulcers referred to our podiatry clinic at DDI from Jan 2011 till Dec 2017. Results We show a higher prevalence of DFU in men than in women, and a greater percentage of DFU occurred in men at an earlier age (p&lt;0.05). Only about half of the DFU were clinically infected (49.3%) but 92% of DFU showed bacterial growth in the microbiological lab analysis. In addition, we isolated more monomicrobial (57.3%) than polymicrobial (34.8%) DFI and representing an average of 1.30 pathogens per patient. The presence of Gram-positive and Gram-negative strains was comparable between men and women regardless their age or glucose levels. Interestingly, more Gram-positive strains are present in ulcers without ischemia while more Gram-negative strains are present in ulcers with ischemia (p&lt;0.05). While Staphylococcus aureus was common in infected ulcers without ischemia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was predominant in ulcers with infection and ischemia, regardless of ulcer depth. Finally, a higher percentage of women has controlled HbA1c levels (19.41% versus 11.95% in men) and more women in this group displayed non-infected wounds (60.6% and 43.90% for women and men, respectively). Conclusion Our results provide an updated picture of the DFI patterns and antibiotics resistance in patients attending Dasman Diabetes Institute (DDI) clinics in Kuwait which might help in adopting the appropriate treatment of infected foot and improving clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3114315049,"Background Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the mainstay of asthma treatment, but evidence suggests a link between ICS usage and increased rates of respiratory infections. We assessed the composition of the asthmatic airways microbiome in asthma patients taking low and high dose ICS and the stability of the microbiome over a 2 week period. Methods We prospectively recruited 55 individuals with asthma. Of these, 22 were on low-dose ICS and 33 on high-dose ICS (16 on budesonide, 17 on fluticasone propionate). Sputum from each subject underwent DNA extraction, amplification and 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the bacterial component of the microbiome. 19 subjects returned for further sputum induction after 24 h and 2 weeks. Results A total of 5,615,037 sequencing reads revealed 167 bacterial taxa in the asthmatic airway samples, with the most abundant being Streptococcus spp. No significant differences in sputum bacterial load or overall community composition were seen between the low- and high-dose ICS groups. However, Streptococcus spp. showed significantly higher relative abundance in subjects taking low-dose ICS (p = 0.002). Haemophilus parainfluenzae was significantly more abundant in subjects on high-dose fluticasone propionate than those on high-dose budesonide (p = 0.047). There were no statistically significant changes in microbiota composition over a 2-week period. Discussion Whilst no significant differences were observed between the low- and high-dose ICS groups, increased abundance of the potential pathogen H . parainfluenzae was observed in patients taking high-dose fluticasone propionate compared to those taking high-dose budesonide. The microbiota were stable over fourteen days, providing novel evidence of the established community of bacteria in the asthmatic airways. Clinical trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02671773"
https://openalex.org/W3115798628,"Within the span of almost ten years, phone dating apps have transformed the dating scene by normalizing and, according to some voices, gamifying the digital quest for a partner. Despite amplified discussion on how swipe-based apps damage the fabric of intimate ties, scientific accounts on whether they have led to different relationship patterns are missing. Using 2018 survey data from Switzerland, this study provides a rich overview of couples who met through dating apps by addressing three main themes: 1) family formation intentions, 2) relationship satisfaction and individual well-being, and 3) assortative mating. The data indicate that in Switzerland, dating apps have recently taken over as main online dating context. Results further show that couples formed through mobile dating have stronger cohabiting intentions than those formed in non-digital settings. Women who found their partner through a dating app also have stronger fertility desires and intentions than those who found their partner offline. Generally, there are no differences between couples initiated through dating apps and those initiated elsewhere regarding relationship and life satisfaction. Though more data are needed to capture the full range of users’ romantic and sexual experiences, current results mitigate some of the concerns regarding the short-term orientation or the poor quality of relationships formed through mobile dating. Findings finally suggest that dating apps play an important role in altering couple composition by allowing for more educationally diverse and geographically distant couples."
https://openalex.org/W3117185051,"Objective The indiscriminate prescription of antibiotics has led to the emergence of resistance microbes worldwide. This study aimed to investigate the antibiotic prescribing practices amongst general dental practitioners and specialists in managing endodontic infections in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Design General dental practitioners and specialists in the UAE were invited to participate in an online questionnaire survey which included questions on socio-demographics, practitioner’s antibiotic prescribing preferences for various pulpal and periapical diseases, and their choice, in terms of the type, dose and duration of the antibiotic. The link to the survey questionnaire was sent to 250 invited dentists. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics and chi-square tests for independence and level of significance was set at 0.05. Results A total of 174 respondents participated in the survey (response rate = 70%). The respondents who prescribed antibiotics at least once a month were 38.5% while 17.2% did so, more than three times a week; amoxicillin 500 mg was the antibiotic of choice for patients not allergic to penicillin (43.7%), and in cases of penicillin allergies, erythromycin 500 mg (21.3%). There was a significant difference in the antibiotic prescribing practices of GDPs compared to endodontists and other specialties especially in clinical cases such as acute apical abscesses with swelling and moderate to severe pre-operative symptoms and retreatment of endodontic cases (p&lt;0.05). Approximately, three quarters of the respondents (78.7%) did not prescribe a loading dose when prescribing antibiotics. About 15% respondents prescribed antibiotics to their patients if they were not accessible to patients due to a holiday/weekend. Conclusions In general, the antibiotic prescribing practices of UAE dentists are congruent with the international norms. However, there were occasions of inappropriate prescriptions such as in patients with irreversible pulpitis, necrotic pulps with no systemic involvement and/or with sinus tracts."
https://openalex.org/W3118150332,"The drip irrigation under mulch has become one of significant supporting technologies for cotton industry development in Xinjiang, and has shown the good economic and ecological benefits. With the rapid development of society and economy in Southern Xinjiang, the conventional mode of large-quota winter and spring irrigation, salt leaching and alkali decreasing is difficult to support sustainable development of land and water resources in Southern Xinjiang. This study tries to adjust soil moisture and salt content regulation mode of massive water salt leaching and drip irrigation under mulch in the non-growing period of cotton field in Southern Xinjiang, explores interannual soil salinity change features of drip irrigation cotton field without winter and spring irrigation, and provides experimental basis for drip irrigation technology under mulch which can reduce and exempt cotton irrigation in winter and spring. According to ET0, the dual-factor complete combination experiment involving 3 irrigating water quotas (I1, I2, I3) and 2 irrigation times (T12, T16) was designed, and 6 treatments were involved in total(I1T12,I2T12,I3T12,I1T16,I2T16 and I3T16). The investigation results of four-year (2012–2015) field positioning experiment showed that, under the condition of “germination under drip irrigation” without winter and spring irrigation, increasing irrigation quota and irrigation times could lower 0-100cm soil salinity accumulation, but the soil salinity accumulation degree was 40-100cm, and less than 0-30cm. In the seedling stage, bud stage, blossom and boll-forming stage, and boll opening stage, the average salinity of 0-100cm soil increased by 39.81%, 31.91%, 26.85% and 29.47%, respectively. Increasing irrigation quota and irrigation times could ease interannual soil salinity accumulation degree of cotton field with drip irrigation under mulch, without winter and spring irrigation. 0-100cm soil salinity before sowing was related to the irrigation quota of cotton in the growing stage of the last year. The larger the irrigation quota was, the smaller the soil salinity before sowing would be. The accumulation amount of soil salinity at the end of growing stage under different treatments was lower than that before sowing. The drip irrigation of cotton under mulch in the growing stage could effectively regulate soil salinity distribution and space-time migration process in the growing stage of cotton. Compared with the beginning of 2012, 0-100cm average soil salinity under 3 irrigation quotas (I1, I2, I3) was 33.66%, 5.60% and 1.24%, respectively. Salt accumulating rates under 12 irrigations and 16 irrigations were 20.66% and 6.33%, respectively. The soil had the risk of salinization when the “germination under drip irrigation” without winter and spring irrigation was used. Such results can provide the reference for prevention and treatment of soil moisture and salt content of cotton field with drip irrigation under mulch in the arid region."
https://openalex.org/W3115799290,"Background The primary objective of this study was to compare concomitant and hybrid therapy in the first line eradication treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in Split-Dalmatia County, Croatia, in which clarithromycin resistance is above 20%. The secondary objective of the study was to determine and compare compliance and adverse events rate between these therapeutic protocols. Materials and methods In an open-label, randomised clinical trial 140 patients total with H . pylori infection were randomly assigned to either concomitant (esomeprazole 40 mg, amoxicillin 1 g, metronidazole 500 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg, twice daily for 14 days) or hybrid (esomeprazole 40 mg and amoxicillin 1 g twice daily during 14 days with adding metronidazole 500 mg and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily, in the last 7 days,) treatment group. Results Eradication rates for concomitant group and hybrid therapy group were 84.1% (58/69) and 83.1% (59/71) respectively in the intention-to-treat analysis and 96.7% (58/60) and 95.2% (59/62) in per-protocol analysis. There was no significant difference between the groups (ITT analysis: P = 0.878; PP analysis: P = 0.675). Adverse events were more frequent in the concomitant group (33.3% vs 18.3%, P = 0.043). There was no difference among groups regarding compliance rate. Conclusion Hybrid therapy has similar eradication rate as concomitant therapy, with lower adverse events rate. In the era of increasing antibiotic resistance, eradication regime with less antibiotic’s usage, as hybrid therapy, should be reasonable first line treatment choice for H . pylori infection.

https://openalex.org/W3116439903,"Flip-flop of lipids of the lipid bilayer (LBL) constituting the plasma membrane (PM) plays a crucial role in a myriad of events ranging from cellular signaling and regulation of cell shapes to cell homeostasis, membrane asymmetry, phagocytosis, and cell apoptosis. While extensive research has been conducted to probe the lipid flip flop of planar lipid bilayers (LBLs), less is known regarding lipid flip-flop for highly curved, nanoscopic LBL systems despite the vast importance of membrane curvature in defining the morphology of cells and organelles and in maintaining a variety of cellular functions, enabling trafficking, and recruiting and localizing shape-responsive proteins. In this paper, we conduct molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the energetics, structure, and configuration of a lipid molecule undergoing flip-flop and desorption in a highly curved LBL, represented as a nanoparticle-supported lipid bilayer (NPSLBL) system. We compare our findings against those of a planar substrate supported lipid bilayer (PSSLBL). Our MD simulation results reveal that despite the vast differences in the curvature and other curvature-dictated properties (e.g., lipid packing fraction, difference in the number of lipids between inner and outer leaflets, etc.) between the NPSLBL and the PSSLBL, the energetics of lipid flip-flop and lipid desorption as well as the configuration of the lipid molecule undergoing lipid flip-flop are very similar for the NPSLBL and the PSSLBL. In other words, our results establish that the curvature of the LBL plays an insignificant role in lipid flip-flop and desorption."
https://openalex.org/W3116955806,"Although behavioral studies have repeatedly demonstrated that individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have deficits in alertness, little is known about its underlying neural basis. It is hypothesized that pupil diameter reflects the firing of norepinephrine (NE) neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC), and that the LC-NE neuromodulatory system for regulating alertness may be dysfunctional in ADHD. To clinically and non-invasively examine this hypothesis, we monitored the kinetics of pupil diameter in response to stimuli and compared them between adults with ADHD (n = 17) and typically developing (TD) adults (n = 23) during an auditory continuous performance task. Individuals in the ADHD group exhibited a significantly larger tonic pupil diameter, and a suppressed stimulus-evoked phasic pupil dilation, compared to those in the TD group. These findings provide support for the idea that the aberrant regulatory control of pupil diameter in adults with ADHD may be consistent with a compromised state of alertness resulting from a hyperactivated LC-NE system."
https://openalex.org/W3117886300,"Background Retrospective studies on the use of Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System blockade in patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been informative but conflicting, and prospective studies are required to demonstrate the safety, tolerability, and outcomes of initiating these agents in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and hypertension. Methods and findings This is a single center feasibility study encompassing two cohorts: (1) prospective cohort (April 21, 2020 to May 29, 2020) and (2) retrospective cohort (March 7, 2020 to April 1, 2020) of hospitalized patients with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal swab. Key inclusion criteria include BP &gt; 130/80 and a requirement of supplemental oxygen with FiO 2 of 25% or higher to maintain SpO 2 &gt; 92%. Key exclusion criteria included hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury (AKI) at the time of enrollment. Prospective cohort consisted of de novo initiation of losartan and continuation for a minimum of 7 days and assessed for adverse events (AKI, hyperkalemia, transaminitis, hypotension) and clinical outcomes (change in SpO 2 /FiO 2 and inflammatory markers, need for ICU admission and mechanical ventilation). Retrospective cohort consisted of continuation of losartan (prior-to-hospitalization) and assessment of similar outcomes. In the prospective cohort, a total of 250 hospitalized patients were screened and inclusion/exclusion criteria were met in 16/250 patients and in the retrospective cohort, a total of 317 hospitalized patients were screened and inclusion/exclusion criteria were met in 14/317 patients. Most common adverse event was hypotension, leading to discontinuation in 3/16 (19%) and 2/14 (14%) patients in the prospective and retrospective cohort. No patients developed AKI in the prospective cohort as compared to 1/14 (7%) patients in the retrospective cohort, requiring discontinuation of losartan. Hyperkalemia occurred in 1/16 (6%) and 0/14 patients in the prospective and retrospective cohorts, respectively. In the prospective cohort, 3/16 (19%) and 2/16 (13%) patients required ICU admission and mechanical ventilation. In comparison, 3/14 (21%) required ICU admission and mechanical ventilation in the retrospective cohort. A majority of patients in both cohorts (14/16 (88%) and 13/14 (93%) patients from the prospective and retrospective cohort) were discharged alive from the hospital. A total of 9/16 (prospective) and 5/14 (retrospective) patients completed a minimum 7 days of losartan. In these 9 patients in the prospective cohort, a significant improvement in SpO 2 /FiO 2 ratio was observed from day 1 to 7. No significant changes in inflammatory markers (initiation, peak, and day 7) were observed in either cohort. Conclusion In this pilot study we demonstrate that losartan was well-tolerated among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and hypertension. We also demonstrate the feasibility of patient recruitment and the appropriate parameters to assess the outcomes and safety of losartan initiation or continuation, which provides a framework for future randomized clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W3118181799,"Managing Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is about managing human behaviours, but decision-making processes have traditionally focussed on ecological aspects, treating social aspects as secondary. It is now becoming more evident that an equal focus on the ecological and social aspects is required. Without the collection of information about social aspect such as impacts and sharing this as well as ecological information with communities, MPAs are at higher risk of opposition and social acceptability problems. This paper explores the development of a wellbeing framework to understand the social aspects, including the impacts of MPAs on the wellbeing of local communities. This research investigates two case study MPAs: Cape Byron and Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Parks in New South Wales, Australia. The MPAs are multiple-use and were implemented in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The research began with a review of the literature, followed by fieldwork, including semi-structured qualitative interviews with community members. Through thematic coding of the interview transcripts in light of the literature on assessing the social impacts of MPAs, a community wellbeing framework of domains and associated attributes was developed to investigate social impacts. Our analysis shows; first, local perspectives are crucial to understanding social impacts. Second, understanding social impacts gives insight into the nature of trade-offs that occur in decision-making regarding MPAs. Third, the intangible social impacts experienced by local communities are just as significant as the tangible ones for understanding how MPAs operate. Fourth, governance impacts have been the most influential factor affecting the social acceptability of the case study parks. We argue that failure to address negative social impacts can undermine the legitimacy of MPAs. We propose that the framework will support policymakers to work towards more effective, equitable and socially sustainable MPAs by employing much-needed monitoring of human dimensions of conservation interventions at the community level to shape adaptive management."
https://openalex.org/W3113421520,"Alkali-activated materials (AAMs), sometimes called geopolymers, are eco-friendly cementitious materials with reduced carbon emissions when compared to ordinary Portland cement. However, the availability of most precursors used for AAM production may decline in the future because of changes in industrial sectors. Thus, new precursors must be developed. Recently there has been increased interest in synthetic glass precursors. One major concern with using synthetic glasses is ensuring that they react sufficiently under alkaline conditions. Reactivity is a necessary, although not sufficient, requirement for a suitable precursor for AAMs. This work involves the synthesis, characterization, and estimation of alkaline reactivity of Na-Mg aluminosilicate glasses. Structural characterization showed that replacing Na with Mg led to more depolymerization. Alkaline reactivity studies indicated that, as Mg replaced Na, reactivity of glasses increased at first, reached an optimal value, and then declined. This trend in reactivity could not be explained by the conventional parameters used for estimating glass reactivity: the non-bridging oxygen fraction (which predicts similar reactivity for all glasses) and optical basicity (which predicts a decrease in reactivity with an increase in Mg replacement). The reactivity of the studied glasses was found to depend on two main factors: depolymerization (as indicated by structural characterization) and optical basicity. Depolymerization dominated initially, which led to an increase in reactivity, while the effect of optical basicity dominated later, leading to a decrease in reactivity. Hence, while designing reactive synthetic glasses for alkali activation, structural study of glasses should be given due consideration in addition to the conventional factors."
https://openalex.org/W3114126899,"Purpose To evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and treatment patterns of ranibizumab 0.5 mg in prior ranibizumab-treated patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) enrolled in the LUMINOUS ™ study. Patients and methods LUMINOUS, a 5-year, prospective, multicenter, observational study, recruited 30,138 adult patients (treatment-naïve or prior ranibizumab-treated or other ocular treatments) across all approved indications for ranibizumab. Patients were treated as per local ranibizumab label of participating countries. Here we report the mean change in visual acuity (VA) at Year 1, treatment exposure, overall incidence of ocular, non-ocular adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) in prior ranibizumab-treated nAMD patients (n = 16,167). Results At baseline, the mean (standard deviation [SD]) age of patients was 78.4 (9.0) years, 59.0% were female, and 80.0% were Caucasian. At Year 1 (n = 10,168), the mean (SD) VA change was −1.6 (12.6) letters (baseline VA: 58.3 [19.0] letters) with a mean (SD) of 4.7 (3.1) ranibizumab injections. Stratified by duration of prior ranibizumab treatment of &lt;1 (n = 4,112), 1 to &lt;2 (n = 2,095), 2 to &lt;3 (n = 1,506), 3 to &lt;4 (n = 1,123), 4 to &lt;5 (n = 689), and ≥5 (n = 256) years, the mean (SD) VA change at Year 1 were −1.2 (13.5), −2.0 (12.3), −2.0 (11.3), −1.9 (11.8), −2.5 (10.9), and 0.0 (11.2) letters, respectively. Mean (SD) VA change in patients who received ≤6 and &gt;6 injections over 1 year was −1.8 (13.8) and +0.5 (12.5) letters, respectively. The rate of ocular/non-ocular AEs and SAEs across all prior ranibizumab-treated patients over 5 years were 13.29%/23.02% and 0.84%/13.66%, respectively. Conclusions Overall, regardless of the prior ranibizumab-treatment duration, VA was maintained in these patients at Year 1, and those receiving ≥6 injections showed a trend towards gaining letters. There were no new safety signals. These results may help inform routine clinical practice to appropriately treat nAMD patients with ranibizumab to achieve optimal visual outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3114638377,"Despite dramatic improvements in outcomes arising from the introduction of targeted therapies and immunotherapies, metastatic melanoma is a highly resistant form of cancer with 5 year survival rates of &lt;35%. Drug resistance is frequently reported to be associated with changes in oxidative metabolism that lead to malignancy that is non-responsive to current treatments. The current report demonstrates that triphenylphosphonium(TPP)-based lipophilic cations can be utilized to induce cytotoxicity in pre-clinical models of malignant melanoma by disrupting mitochondrial metabolism. In vitro experiments demonstrated that TPP-derivatives modified with aliphatic side chains accumulated in melanoma cell mitochondria; disrupted mitochondrial metabolism; led to increases in steady-state levels of reactive oxygen species; decreased total glutathione; increased the fraction of glutathione disulfide; and caused cell killing by a thiol-dependent process that could be rescued by N-acetylcysteine. Furthermore, TPP-derivative-induced melanoma toxicity was enhanced by glutathione depletion (using buthionine sulfoximine) as well as inhibition of thioredoxin reductase (using auranofin). In addition, there was a structure-activity relationship between the aliphatic side-chain length of TPP-derivatives (5–16 carbons), where longer carbon chains increased melanoma cell metabolic disruption and cell killing. In vivo bio-distribution experiments showed that intratumoral administration of a C 14 -TPP-derivative (12-carbon aliphatic chain), using a slow-release thermosensitive hydrogel as a delivery vehicle, localized the drug at the melanoma tumor site. There, it was observed to persist and decrease the growth rate of melanoma tumors. These results demonstrate that TPP-derivatives selectively induce thiol-dependent metabolic oxidative stress and cell killing in malignant melanoma and support the hypothesis that a hydrogel-based TPP-derivative delivery system could represent a therapeutic drug-delivery strategy for melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W3115197936,"Although strong evidence exists about the effectiveness of basic childbirth services in reducing maternal and newborn mortality, these services are not provided in every childbirth, even those at health facilities. The WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist (SCC) was developed as a job aide to remind health workers of evidenced-based practices to be provided at specific points in the childbirth process. The Zambian government requested context-specific evidence on the feasibility and outcomes associated with introducing the checklist and related mentorship. A study was conducted on use of the SCC in four facilities in Nchelenge District of Zambia. Observations of childbirth services were conducted just before and six months after the introduction of the intervention. Observers used a structured tool to record adherence to essential services indicated on the checklist. The primary outcome of interest was the change in the average proportion of essential childbirth practices completed. Feedback questionnaires were administered to health workers before and six months after the intervention. At baseline and endline, 108 and 148 pause points were observed, respectively. There was an increase from 57% to 76% of tasks performed (p = 0.04). Considering only these cases where necessary supplies were available, health workers completed 60% of associated tasks at baseline compared to 84% at endline (p&lt;0.01). Some tasks, such as taking an infant’s temperature and hand washing, were never or rarely performed at baseline. Feedback from the health workers indicated that nearly all health workers agreed or strongly agreed with positive statements about the intervention. The performance of health workers in Zambia in completing essential practices in childbirth was low at baseline but improvements were observed with the introduction of the SCC and mentorship. Our results suggest that such interventions could improve quality of care for facility-based childbirth. However, national-level commitment to ensuring availability of trained staff and supplies is essential for success.

https://openalex.org/W3115610476,"Primary focal hyperhidrosis (PFH, OMIM %144110) is a genetically influenced condition characterised by excessive sweating. Prevalence varies between 1.0–6.1% in the general population, dependent on ethnicity. The aetiology of PFH remains unclear but an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, incomplete penetrance and variable phenotypes have been reported. In our study, nine pedigrees (50 affected, 53 non-affected individuals) were included. Clinical characterisation was performed at the German Hyperhidrosis Centre, Munich, by using physiological and psychological questionnaires. Genome-wide parametric linkage analysis with GeneHunter was performed based on the Illumina genome-wide SNP arrays. Haplotypes were constructed using easyLINKAGE and visualised via HaploPainter. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) with 100x coverage in 31 selected members (24 affected, 7 non-affected) from our pedigrees was achieved by next generation sequencing. We identified four genome-wide significant loci, 1q41-1q42.3, 2p14-2p13.3, 2q21.2-2q23.3 and 15q26.3-15q26.3 for PFH. Three pedigrees map to a shared locus at 2q21.2-2q23.3, with a genome-wide significant LOD score of 3.45. The chromosomal region identified here overlaps with a locus at chromosome 2q22.1-2q31.1 reported previously. Three families support 1q41-1q42.3 (LOD = 3.69), two families share a region identical by descent at 2p14-2p13.3 (LOD = 3.15) and another two families at 15q26.3 (LOD = 3.01). Thus, our results point to considerable genetic heterogeneity. WES did not reveal any causative variants, suggesting that variants or mutations located outside the coding regions might be involved in the molecular pathogenesis of PFH. We suggest a strategy based on whole-genome or targeted next generation sequencing to identify causative genes or variants for PFH."
https://openalex.org/W3117215689,"Background The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having a profound impact on global healthcare. Shortages in staff, operating theatre space and intensive care beds has led to a significant reduction in the provision of surgical care. Even vascular surgery, often insulated from resource scarcity due to its status as an urgent specialty, has limited capacity due to the pandemic. Furthermore, many vascular surgical patients are elderly with multiple comorbidities putting them at increased risk of COVID-19 and its complications. There is an urgent need to investigate the impact on patients presenting to vascular surgeons during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods and analysis The COvid-19 Vascular sERvice (COVER) study has been designed to investigate the worldwide impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on vascular surgery, at both service provision and individual patient level. COVER is running as a collaborative study through the Vascular and Endovascular Research Network (VERN), an independent, international vascular research collaborative with the support of numerous national and international organisations). The study has 3 ‘Tiers’: Tier 1 is a survey of vascular surgeons to capture longitudinal changes to the provision of vascular services within their hospital; Tier 2 captures data on vascular and endovascular procedures performed during the pandemic; and Tier 3 will capture any deviations to patient management strategies from pre-pandemic best practice. Data submission and collection will be electronic using online survey tools (Tier 1: SurveyMonkey® for service provision data) and encrypted data capture forms (Tiers 2 and 3: REDCap® for patient level data). Tier 1 data will undergo real-time serial analysis to determine longitudinal changes in practice, with country-specific analyses also performed. The analysis of Tier 2 and Tier 3 data will occur on completion of the study as per the pre-specified statistical analysis plan."
https://openalex.org/W3004088475,"The availability of large metagenomic data offers great opportunities for the population genomic analysis of uncultured organisms, which represent a large part of the unexplored biosphere and play a key ecological role. However, the majority of these organisms lack a reference genome or transcriptome, which constitutes a technical obstacle for classical population genomic analyses. We introduce the metavariant species (MVS) model, in which a species is represented only by intra-species nucleotide polymorphism. We designed a method combining reference-free variant calling, multiple density-based clustering and maximum-weighted independent set algorithms to cluster intra-species variants into MVSs directly from multisample metagenomic raw reads without a reference genome or read assembly. The frequencies of the MVS variants are then used to compute population genomic statistics such as F ST , in order to estimate genomic differentiation between populations and to identify loci under natural selection. The MVS construction was tested on simulated and real metagenomic data. MVSs showed the required quality for robust population genomics and allowed an accurate estimation of genomic differentiation (Δ F ST &lt; 0.0001 and &lt;0.03 on simulated and real data respectively). Loci predicted under natural selection on real data were all detected by MVSs. MVSs represent a new paradigm that may simplify and enhance holistic approaches for population genomics and the evolution of microorganisms."
https://openalex.org/W3113808385,"Pastoralism is widely practiced in arid lands and is the primary means of livelihood for approximately 268 million people across Africa. Environmental, interpersonal, and transactional variables such as vegetation and water availability, conflict, ethnic tensions, and private/public land delineation influence the movements of these populations. The challenges of climate change and conflict are widely felt by nomadic pastoralists in Somalia, where resources are scarce, natural disasters are increasingly common, and protracted conflict has plagued communities for decades. Bereft of real-time data, researchers and programmatic personnel often turn to post hoc analysis to understand the interaction between climate, conflict, and migration, and design programs to address the needs of nomadic pastoralists. By designing an Agent-Based Model to simulate the movement of nomadic pastoralists based on typologically-diverse, historical data of environmental, interpersonal, and transactional variables in Somaliland and Puntland between 2008 and 2018, this study explores how pastoralists respond to changing environments. Through subsequent application of spatial analysis such as choropleth maps, kernel density mapping, and standard deviational ellipses, we characterize the resultant pastoralist population distribution in response to these variables. Outcomes demonstrate a large scale spatio-temporal trend of pastoralists migrating to the southeast of the study area with high density areas in the south of Nugaal, the northwest of Sool, and along the Ethiopian border. While minimal inter-seasonal variability is seen, multiple analyses support the consolidation of pastoralists to specifically favorable regions. Exploration of the large-scale population, climate, and conflict trends allows for cogent narratives and associative hypotheses regarding the pastoralist migration during the study period. While this model produces compelling associations between pastoralist movements and terrestrial and conflict variables, it relies heavily on assumptions and incomplete data that are not necessarily representative of realities on the ground. Given the paucity of data regarding pastoralist decision-making and migration, validation remains challenging."
https://openalex.org/W3114658290,"Sense of body ownership is an immediate and distinct experience of one’s body as belonging to oneself. While it is well-recognized that ownership feelings emerge from the integration of visual and somatosensory signals, the principles upon which they are integrated are still intensely debated. Here, we used the rubber hand illusion (RHI) to examine how the interplay of visual, tactile, and proprioceptive signals is governed depending on their spatiotemporal properties. For this purpose, the RHI was elicited in different conditions varying with respect to the extent of visuo-proprioceptive divergence (i.e., the distance between the real and fake hands) and differing in terms of the availability and spatiotemporal complexity of tactile stimulation (none, simple, or complex). We expected that the attenuating effect of distance on illusion strength will be more pronounced in the absence of touch (when proprioception gains relatively higher importance) and absent in the presence of complex tactile signals. Additionally, we hypothesized that participants with greater proprioceptive acuity—assessed using an elbow joint position discrimination task—will be less susceptible to the illusion, but only under the conditions of limited tactile stimulation. In line with our prediction, RHI was attenuated at the farthest distance only when tactile information was absent or simplified, but the attenuation was effectively prevented by the use of complex tactile stimulation—in this case, RHI was comparably vivid at both distances. However, passive proprioceptive acuity was not related to RHI strength in either of the conditions. The results indicate that complex-structured tactile signals can override the influence of proprioceptive signals in body attribution processes. These findings extend our understanding of body ownership by showing that it is primarily determined by informative cues from the most relevant sensory domains, rather than mere accumulation of multisensory evidence."
https://openalex.org/W3117806641,"Background Despite an increasing importance of home care, quality assurance in this healthcare sector in Switzerland is hardly established. In 2010, Swiss home care quality indicators (QIs) based on the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care (RAI-HC) were developed. However, these QIs have not been revised since, although internationally new RAI-HC QIs have emerged. The objective of this study was to assess the appropriateness of RAI-HC QIs to measure quality of home care in Switzerland from a public health and healthcare providers’ perspective. Methods First, the appropriateness of RAI-HC QIs, identified in a recent systematic review, was assessed by a multidisciplinary expert panel based on the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method taking into account indicators’ public health relevance, potential of influence, and comprehensibility. Second, the QIs selected by the experts were afterwards rated regarding their relevance, potential of influence, and practicability from a healthcare providers’ perspective in focus groups with home care nurses based on the Nominal-Group-Technique. Data were analyzed using median scores and the Disagreement Index. Results 18 of 43 RAI-HC QIs were rated appropriate by the experts from a public health perspective. The 18 QIs cover clinical, psychosocial, functional and service use aspects. Seven of the 18 QIs were subsequently rated appropriate by home care nurses from a healthcare providers’ perspective. The focus of these QIs is narrow, because three of seven QIs are pain-related. From both perspectives, the majority of RAI-HC QIs were rated inappropriate because of insufficient potential of influence, with healthcare providers rating them more critically. Conclusions The study shows that the appropriateness of RAI-HC QIs differs according to the stakeholder perspective and the intended use of QIs. The findings of this study can guide policy-makers and home care organizations on selecting QIs and to critically reflect on their appropriate use."
https://openalex.org/W3115004780,"Recent studies reported conflicting results on the association of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with dementia and Parkinson’s disease in patients with prostate cancer (Pca). Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) increases the risk of both diseases. A nationwide population cohort study was conducted involving newly diagnosed patients with Pca %who started ADT with GnRHa (GnRHa users, n = 3,201) and control (nonusers, n = 4,123) between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2016, using data from the National Health Insurance Service. To validate the result, a hospital cohort of patients with Pca consisting of GnRHa users (n = 205) and nonusers (n = 479) in a tertiary referral center from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2016, were also analyzed. Traditional and propensity score-matched Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the effects of ADT on the risk of dementia and Parkinson’s disease. In univariable analysis, risk of dementia was associated with GnRHa use in both nationwide and hospital validation cohort (hazard ratio [HR], 1.696; 95% CI, 1.425–2.019, and HR, 1.352; 95% CI, 1.089–1.987, respectively). In a nationwide cohort, ADT was not associated with dementia in both traditional and propensity score-matched multivariable analysis, whereas in a hospital validation cohort, ADT was associated with dementia only in unmatched analysis (HR, 1.203; 95% CI, 1.021–1.859) but not in propensity score-matched analysis. ADT was not associated with Parkinson’s disease in either nationwide and validation cohorts. This population-based study suggests that the association between GnRHa use as ADT and increased risk of dementia or Parkinson’s disease is not clear, which was also verified in a hospital validation cohort."

https://openalex.org/W3113671929,"Our previous studies have shown that Zika virus (ZIKV) replicates in human prostate cells, suggesting that the prostate may serve as a long-term reservoir for virus transmission. Here, we demonstrated that the innate immune responses generated to three distinct ZIKV strains (all isolated from human serum) were significantly different and dependent on their passage history (in mosquito, monkey, or human cells). In addition, some of these phenotypic differences were reduced by a single additional cell culture passage, suggesting that viruses that have been passaged more than 3 times from the patient sample will no longer reflect natural phenotypes. Two of the ZIKV strains analyzed induced high levels of the IP-10 chemokine and IFNγ in human prostate epithelial and stromal mesenchymal stem cells. To further understand the importance of these innate responses on ZIKV replication, we measured the effects of IP-10 and its downstream receptor, CXCR3, on RNA and virus production in prostate cells. Treatment with IP-10, CXCR3 agonist, or CXCR3 antagonist significantly altered ZIKV viral gene expression, depending on their passage in cells of relevant hosts (mosquito or human). We detected differences in gene expression of two primary CXCR3 isoforms (CXCR3-A and CXCR3-B) on the two cell types, possibly explaining differences in viral output. Lastly, we examined the effects of IP-10, agonist, or antagonist on cell death and proliferation under physiologically relevant infection rates, and detected no significant differences. Although we did not measure protein expression directly, our results indicate that CXCR3 signaling may be a target for therapeutics, to ultimately stop sexual transmission of this virus."
https://openalex.org/W3113856101,"Background Many patient decision aids (PDAs) are developed in academic settings by academic researchers. Academic settings are different from public health clinics where the focus is on clinical work. Thus, research on implementation in public health settings will provide insights to effective implementation of PDA in real-world settings. This study explores perceived factors influencing implementation of an insulin PDA in five public health clinics. Methods This study adopted a comparative case study design with a qualitative focus to identify similarities and differences of the potential barriers and facilitators to implementing the insulin PDA across different sites. Focus groups and individual interviews were conducted with 28 healthcare providers and 15 patients from five public health clinics under the Ministry of Health in Malaysia. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using the thematic approach. Results Five themes emerged which were: 1) time constraint; 2) PDA costs; 3) tailoring PDA use to patient profile; 4) patient decisional role; and 5) leadership and staff motivation. Based on the interviews and drawing on observations and interview reflection notes, time constraint emerged as the common prominent factor that cut across all the clinics, however, tailoring PDA use to patient profile; patient decisional role; leadership and staff motivation varied due to the distinct challenges faced by specific clinics. Among clinics from semi-urban areas with more patients from limited education and lower socio-economic status, patients’ ability to comprehend the insulin PDA and their tendency to rely on their doctors and family to make health decisions were felt to be a prominent barrier to the insulin PDA implementation. Staff motivation appeared to be stronger in most of the clinics where specific time was allocated to diabetes team to attend to diabetes patients and this was felt could be a potential facilitator, however, a lack of leadership might affect the insulin PDA implementation even though a diabetes team is present. Conclusions This study found time constraint as a major potential barrier for PDA implementation and effective implementation of the insulin PDA across different public health clinics would depend on leadership and staff motivation and, the need to tailor PDA use to patient profile. To ensure successful implementation, implementers should avoid a ‘one size fits all’ approach when implementing health innovations."
https://openalex.org/W3115332782,"Ecotin, first described in Escherichia coli , is a potent inhibitor of a broad range of serine proteases including those typically released by the innate immune system such as neutrophil elastase (NE). Here we describe the identification of ecotin orthologs in various Campylobacter species, including Campylobacter rectus and Campylobacter showae residing in the oral cavity and implicated in the development and progression of periodontal disease in humans. To investigate the function of these ecotins in vitro , the orthologs from C . rectus and C . showae were recombinantly expressed and purified from E . coli . Using CmeA degradation/protection assays, fluorescence resonance energy transfer and NE activity assays, we found that ecotins from C . rectus and C . showae inhibit NE, factor Xa and trypsin, but not the Campylobacter jejuni serine protease HtrA or its ortholog in E . coli , DegP. To further evaluate ecotin function in vivo , an E . coli ecotin-deficient mutant was complemented with the C . rectus and C . showae homologs. Using a neutrophil killing assay, we demonstrate that the low survival rate of the E . coli ecotin-deficient mutant can be rescued upon expression of ecotins from C . rectus and C . showae . In addition, the C . rectus and C . showae ecotins partially compensate for loss of N-glycosylation and increased protease susceptibility in the related pathogen, Campylobacter jejuni , thus implicating a similar role for these proteins in the native host to cope with the protease-rich environment of the oral cavity."
https://openalex.org/W3116181672,"The variation in temperament among animals has consequences for evolution and ecology. One of the primary effects of consistent behavioral differences is on reproduction. In chelonians some authors have focused on the study of temperament using different methods. In our research our first aim was i) establish a methodology to determine the degree of boldness among individuals Rhinoclemmys areolata . Our second aim was to ii) determine the role boldness plays during reproduction, with emphasis on courtship and copulation, considering a) the interactions between males and females, and b) competition between males. We used 16 sexually mature individuals of each sex. Males were observed in four different situations and 17 behavioral traits were recorded. We selected 12 traits that allowed us distinguish between the bolder and the shier individuals and found that five behavioral traits were specific for bolder individuals and five others for shier individuals. In a second step, we observed a male in presence of a female and recorded courtship behaviors and breeding attempts. Bolder individuals did not display courtship behaviors and just attempted to copulate. Shier individuals displayed courtship behaviors and copulation attempts were rarely observed. Finally, in the simulations that compared two males in the presence of a female we noticed that bolder individuals displayed courtship behaviors while the shier ones simply ignored the female. Our results first allowed us to determine which methodology is the best to determine temperament in turtles. Secondly, temperament seems to be an important factor in modulating interaction between males and females. Bolder individuals have an advantage during competition and display courtship behaviours only if other males are present. Shier males displayed courtship behaviors and only try to copulate when no competitors were present. These two different temperament-dependant strategies are discussed in terms of ecology, evolution and management."

This study elucidates changes in the mental states of mothers and children residing in low-dose radiation contaminated regions within Fukushima Prefecture over a five-year period after the Fukushima Daiichi accident. From 2011 to 2015, questionnaire surveys assessing psychological symptoms, including posttraumatic stress disorder-related responses, depressive responses, and stress responses, and radiation protection behaviors were conducted with 18,741 mothers of children aged four, 18, and 42 months. Mothers’ and children’s psychological symptoms and mothers’ radiation protection behaviors were highest in 2011, immediately following the nuclear accident, but decreased over time. However, even in 2015, psychological symptoms and radiation protection behaviors were higher for children and mothers within Fukushima Prefecture than for those in a control group living in regions outside the area, which were minimally affected by the accident. The results suggest that the psychological effects in mothers and children living in low-dose radiation contaminated areas continued for at least five years after the accident. Furthermore, psychological effects in children born after the incident were likely to have been triggered by the parental behavior of mothers who were negatively affected by anxiety and stress. This finding raises concerns regarding the accident’s long-lasting psychological effects in mothers and children living in low-contamination regions."

With an effective atomic number of 10.6 (approximating bone equivalence), photon energy dependency is apparent in the low x-ray energy range, with interplay between the photoelectric effect and attenuation. As an example, over the examined dose range, at 120 kVp the photon sensitivity has been found to be some 5× that of 60 Co gamma irradiations, also with repeatability to within ~1%. The glow-curves, taking the form of a single prominent broad peak, have been deconvolved yielding at best fit a total of five peaks, the associated activation energies and frequency factors also being obtained.

In 2014, we assessed delay discounting in children (N = 167; mean age = 8.3 years-old), who were preschool age at the time of the earthquake (mean age at the time of disaster = 4.8 years-old) in a time-investment exercise where children allocated five tokens between rewards ""now"" (one candy per token on the same day) versus ""one month later"" (two candies per token one month later). The number of tokens allocated for ""now"" was higher by 0.535 (95% confidence interval: −0.012, 1.081) in children who had their housing destroyed or flooded than those with no housing damage. Other types of traumatic experiences were not associated with delay discounting."
https://openalex.org/W3115076188,"On account of its stringent regulation and high rate of induction, the tetracycline regulatory system is used extensively for inducing target gene expression in eukaryotes. However, under certain circumstances, its associated background expression can be problematic, as in the expression of highly toxic proteins. We found that when using the Tet-On 3G system to drive expression of the kid toxin gene in sf9 insect cells, a higher percentage of cells were killed than when using an empty vector in the absence of the induction agent doxycycline, thereby indicating the leaky expression of this inducible expression system. Moreover, we found that the tetracycline-controlled transcriptional silencer (tTS) does not effectively reduce the background expression of the Tet-On 3G system in sf9 cells. However, Csy4, a Cas9 homologous protein in the CRISPR family with sequence-specific endonuclease activity, was found to be effective in reducing the Tet-On 3G system-associated background expression, although there was a concomitant reduction in the maximum induced expression. Nevertheless, we found that modification of the system via incorporation of TRE-controlled anti-sense csy4 in combination with a WSSVie1 (Δ23) promotor-driven sense csy4 significantly reduced the leaky expression of the Tet-On 3G system, and that the level of induction was higher than that initially obtained. This optimized Tet-On 3G system can significantly reduce cell death attributed to the background expression of Kid under uninduced conditions. Therefore, we developed a novel low-background inducible expression system for use in insect cells and potentially in other organisms including mammals based on post-transcriptional regulation using Csy4."
https://openalex.org/W3116083074,"Past research has shown that pain experience reduces feelings of guilt for earlier wrongdoings. In this paper, we aim to investigate whether watching other people in pain can reduce feelings of guilt. In Study 1 ( N = 60), we found that participants’ levels of guilt and sadness decreased after they watched a one-minute movie clip showing a painful medical procedure. Study 2 ( N = 156), eliminated an alternative explanation in which pain observation but not the misattribution of unrelated excitation reduced guilt. Finally, in Study 3 ( N = 60), pain observation lowered participants’ feelings of guilt but not their feelings of shame. Overall, these results suggest that the guilt-reducing effect of pain may appear even without the actual experience of physical pain."
https://openalex.org/W3116298815,"The alarming spread of the pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus requires several measures to reduce the risk of contagion. Every successful strategy in controlling the SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on timely diagnosis, which should include testing of asymptomatic carriers. Consequently, increasing the throughput for clinical laboratories for the purposes of conducting large-scale diagnostic testing is urgently needed. Here we support the hypothesis that standard diagnostic protocol for SARS-CoV-2 virus could be conveniently applied to pooled samples obtained from different subjects. We suggest that a two-step sequential pooling procedure could identify positive subjects, ensuring at the same time significant benefits of cost and time. The simulation data presented herein were used to assess the efficiency, in terms of number of required tests, both for random assignment of the subjects to the pools and for situations in which epidemiological and clinical data are used to create ""informed"" pools. Different scenarios were simulated to measure the effect of different pool sizes and different values for virus frequency. Our results allow for a customization of the pooling strategy according to the specific characteristics of the cohort being tested."
https://openalex.org/W3116830805,"Personal distress is a building block of empathy, yet has received scant attention in studies of individual differences in leadership. We investigate whether the effect of leader emergence on men’s distress is influenced by their personalized power motive (p Power) and changes in their testosterone (T) and cortisol (C) levels. In an experiment involving 96 males, p Power modulated the direction and intensity of T change in emergent leaders, with high p-Power leaders showing a more positive T change compared to their low p-Power counterparts. We also conducted a dynamic test of the dual-hormone hypothesis in which participants’ changes in T and C interacted to produce differences in personal distress. Contrary to expectations, positive changes in T were associated with increased distress at negative changes in C. Given that high T and low C are associated with leadership, we explain these findings and question the assumption that personal distress represents a shortcoming in leaders."
https://openalex.org/W2945586371,"In sequential competitions, the order in which teams take turns may have an impact on performance and the outcome. Previous studies with penalty shootouts have shown mixed evidence of a possible advantage for the first shooting team. This has led to some debate on whether a change in the rules of the game is needed. This work contributes to the debate by collecting an extensive dataset of shootouts which corroborates an advantage for the first shooter, albeit with a smaller effect than what has been documented in previous research. To evaluate the impact of alternative ordering of shots, we model shootouts as a probability network, calibrate it using the data from the traditional ordering, and use the model to conduct counterfactual analysis. Our results show that alternating the team that shoots first in each round would reduce the impact of ordering. These results were in part developed as supplement to field studies to support the International Football Association Board’s (IFAB) consideration of changing the shooting order."
https://openalex.org/W3113750519,"A detailed understanding of the CSF dynamics is needed for design and optimization of intrathecal drug delivery devices, drugs, and protocols. Preclinical research using large-animal models is important to help define drug pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics and safety. In this study, we investigated the impact of catheter implantation in the sub-dural space on CSF flow dynamics in Cynomolgus monkeys. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed before and after catheter implantation to quantify the differences based on catheter placement location in the cervical compared to the lumbar spine. Several geometric and hydrodynamic parameters were calculated based on the 3D segmentation and flow analysis. Hagen-Poiseuille equation was used to investigate the impact of catheter implantation on flow reduction and hydraulic resistance. A linear mixed-effects model was used in this study to investigate if there was a statistically significant difference between cervical and lumbar implantation, or between two MRI time points. Results showed that geometric parameters did not change statistically across MRI measurement time points and did not depend on catheter location. However, catheter insertion did have a significant impact on the hydrodynamic parameters and the effect was greater with cervical implantation compared to lumbar implantation. CSF flow rate decreased up to 55% with the catheter located in the cervical region. The maximum flow rate reduction in the lumbar implantation group was 21%. Overall, lumbar catheter implantation disrupted CSF dynamics to a lesser degree than cervical catheter implantation and this effect remained up to two weeks post-catheter implantation in Cynomolgus monkeys."
https://openalex.org/W3115195615,"Secondary structure elements are generally found in almost all protein structures revealed so far. In general, there are more β-sheets than α helices found inside the protein structures. For example, considering the PDB, DSSP and Stride definitions for secondary structure elements and by using the consensus among those, we found 60,727 helices in 4,376 chains identified in all-α structures and 129,440 helices in 7,898 chains identified in all-α and α + β structures. For β-sheets, we identified 837,345 strands in 184,925 β-sheets located within 50,803 chains of all-β structures and 1,541,961 strands in 355,431 β-sheets located within 86,939 chains in all-β and α + β structures (data extracted on February 1, 2019). In this paper we would first like to address a full characterization of the nanoenvironment found at beta sheet locations and then compare those characteristics with the ones we already published for alpha helical secondary structure elements. For such characterization, we use here, as in our previous work about alpha helical nanoenvironments, set of STING protein structure descriptors. As in the previous work, we assume that we will be able to prove that there is a set of protein structure parameters/attributes/descriptors, which could fully describe the nanoenvironment around beta sheets and that appropriate statistically analysis will point out to significant changes in values for those parameters when compared for loci considered inside and outside defined secondary structure element. Clearly, while the univariate analysis is straightforward and intuitively understood, it is severely limited in coverage: it could be successfully applied at best in up to 25% of studied cases. The indication of the main descriptors for the specific secondary structure element (SSE) by means of the multivariate MANOVA test is the strong statistical tool for complete discrimination among the SSEs, and it revealed itself as the one with the highest coverage. The complete description of the nanoenvironment, by analogy, might be understood in terms of describing a key lock system, where all lock mini cylinders need to combine their elevation (controlled by a matching key) to open the lock. The main idea is as follows: a set of descriptors (cylinders in the key-lock example) must precisely combine their values (elevation) to form and maintain a specific secondary structure element nanoenvironment (a required condition for a key being able to open a lock)."
https://openalex.org/W3115292482,"Introduction Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is strongly associated with vascular calcification. An important driver of vascular calcification is high phosphate levels, but these become lower when patients initiate nocturnal hemodialysis or receive a kidney transplant. However, it is unknown whether nocturnal hemodialysis or kidney transplantation mitigate vascular calcification. Therefore, we compared progression of coronary artery calcification (CAC) between patients treated with conventional hemodialysis, nocturnal hemodialysis, and kidney transplant recipients. Methods We measured CAC annually up to 3 years in 114 patients with ESRD that were transplantation candidates: 32 that continued conventional hemodialysis, 34 that initiated nocturnal hemodialysis (≥4x 8 hours/week), and 48 that received a kidney transplant. We compared CAC progression between groups as the difference in square root transformed volume scores per year (ΔCAC SQRV) using linear mixed models. Reference category was conventional hemodialysis. Results The mean age of the study population was 53 ±13 years, 75 (66%) were male, and median dialysis duration was 28 (IQR 12–56) months. Median CAC score at enrollment was 171 (IQR 10–647), which did not differ significantly between treatment groups (P = 0.83). Compared to conventional hemodialysis, CAC progression was non-significantly different in nocturnal hemodialysis -0.10 (95% CI -0.77 to 0.57) and kidney transplantation -0.33 (95% CI -0.96 to 0.29) in adjusted models. Conclusions Nocturnal hemodialysis and kidney transplantation are not associated with significantly less CAC progression compared to conventional hemodialysis during up to 3 years follow-up. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings, to determine which type of calcification is measured with CAC in end-stage renal disease, and whether that reflects cardiovascular risk."
https://openalex.org/W3116388017,"Whereas recent clinical studies report metastatic melanoma survival rates high as 30–50%, many tumors remain nonresponsive or become resistant to current therapeutic strategies. Analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) data set suggests that a significant fraction of melanomas potentially harbor gain-of-function mutations in the gene that encodes for the ErbB4 receptor tyrosine kinase. In this work, a drug discovery strategy was developed that is based on the observation that the Q43L mutant of the naturally occurring ErbB4 agonist Neuregulin-2beta (NRG2β) functions as a partial agonist at ErbB4. NRG2β/Q43L stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation, fails to stimulate ErbB4-dependent cell proliferation, and inhibits agonist-induced ErbB4-dependent cell proliferation. Compounds that exhibit these characteristics likely function as ErbB4 partial agonists, and as such hold promise as therapies for ErbB4-dependent melanomas. Consequently, three highly sensitive and reproducible (Z’ &gt; 0.5) screening assays were developed and deployed for the identification of small-molecule ErbB4 partial agonists. Six compounds were identified that stimulate ErbB4 phosphorylation, fail to stimulate ErbB4-dependent cell proliferation, and appear to selectively inhibit ErbB4-dependent cell proliferation. Whereas further characterization is needed to evaluate the full therapeutic potential of these molecules, this drug discovery platform establishes reliable and scalable approaches for the discovery of ErbB4 inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W3116618510,"Placobdelloides siamensis is a glossiphoniid leech with a short life cycle. In a laboratory setting, ten mature P . siamensis left their host (a turtle) after feeding for approximately three days and initiated copulation. The adults spent 3–4 days gestating before depositing eggs (272.8±62.9 eggs/clutch; range: 186–359 eggs/clutch). The eggs then changed from a creamy white to a creamy brownish color before hatching. Hatching occurred after incubation on the parent's ventral surface for 5–7 days. The transparent brood, with a single pair of red eyes, spent a couple of weeks under the venters of their parents. After this period, they left their parents and grew to maturity in 10–15 days; leeches were considered mature when their color was similar to that of their parents and they performed their first copulation. In addition, the mature leeches survived for 163 days on one feeding."
https://openalex.org/W3116784639,"Verticillium wilt, caused by the soil-borne fungus Verticillium dahliae , is one of the most harmful diseases in Mediterranean olive-growing areas. Although, the effects of both soil temperature and moisture on V . dahliae are well known, there is scant knowledge about what climatic drivers affect the occurrence of the pathogen on a large scale. Here, we investigate what climatic drivers determine V . dahliae occurrence in olive-growing areas in southern Spain. In order to bridge this gap in knowledge, a large-scale field survey was carried out to collect data on the occurrence of V . dahliae in 779 olive groves in Granada province. Forty models based on competing combinations of climatic variables were fitted and evaluated using information-theoretic methods. A model that included a multiplicative combination of seasonal and extreme climatic variables was found to be the most viable one. Isothermality and the seasonal distribution of precipitation were the most important variables influencing the occurrence of the pathogen. The isothermal effect was in turn modulated by the seasonality of rainfall, and this became less negative as seasonality increases. Thus, V . dahliae occurs more frequently in olive-growing areas where the day-night temperature oscillation is lower than the summer-winter one. We also found that irrigation reduced the influence of isothermality on occurrence. Our results demonstrate that long-term compound climatic factors rather than “primary” variables, such as annual trends, can better explain the spatial patterns of V . dahliae occurrence in Mediterranean, southern Spain. One important implication of our study is that appropriate irrigation management, when temperature oscillation approaches optimal conditions for V . dahliae to thrive, may reduce the appearance of symptoms in olive trees."

Previous studies indicate that lncRNAs involved in the process of diabetes and another vascular disease. However, their detailed mechanism of the lncRNAs involved in diabetic macroangiopathy has not been well characterized. In the present study, we generated rat models of diabetic macroangiopathy induced by High fat of 16weeks. A total of 15 GK rats were constructed as a test group, along with 15 Wistar rats set as control group, and thoracic aorta tissue from each group was collected. Whole genomic RNA sequencing was performed on thoracic aorta tissue; 3223 novel lncRNAs and 20367 annotated lncRNAs were indemnified in thoracic aorta samples, and 864 lncRNAs were expressed differently in the test and control groups. Gene ontology term enrichment showed the apparent enrichment of inflammatory response and cell apoptosis, which consistent with the results of H&amp;E Staining, TUNEL Assay, and ELISA; Extensive literature reveals inflammatory response and cell apoptosis play an important role in the process of diabetic macroangiopathy.
