https://openalex.org/W2116753165,"We identified 255 loci across the human genome that contain genomic imbalances among unrelated individuals. Twenty-four variants are present in > 10% of the individuals that we examined. Half of these regions overlap with genes, and many coincide with segmental duplications or gaps in the human genome assembly. This previously unappreciated heterogeneity may underlie certain human phenotypic variation and susceptibility to disease and argues for a more dynamic human genome structure."
https://openalex.org/W2111110205,"Several calcium-independent protein kinases were activated by hyperosmotic and saline stresses in Arabidopsis cell suspension. Similar activation profiles were also observed in seedlings exposed to hyperosmotic stress. One of them was identified to AtMPK6 (Droillard, M. J., Boudsocq, M., Barbier-Brygoo, H., and Laurière, C. (2002) FEBS Lett. 527, 43–50) but the others remained to be identified. They were assumed to belong to the SNF1 (sucrose nonfermenting 1)-related protein kinase 2 (SnRK2) family, which constitutes a plant-specific kinase group. The 10 Arabidopsis SnRK2 were expressed both in cells and seedlings, making the whole SnRK2 family a suitable candidate. Using a family-specific antibody raised against the 10 SnRK2, we demonstrated that these non-MAPK protein kinases activated by hyperosmolarity in cell suspension were SnRK2 proteins. Then, the molecular identification of the involved SnRK2 was investigated by transient expression assays. Nine of the 10 SnRK2 were activated by hyperosmolarity induced by mannitol, as well as NaCl, indicating an important role of the SnRK2 family in osmotic signaling. In contrast, none of the SnRK2 were activated by cold treatment, whereas abscisic acid only activated five of the nine SnRK2. The probable involvement of the different Arabidopsis SnRK2 in several abiotic transduction pathways is discussed.

The probable involvement of the different Arabidopsis SnRK2 in several abiotic transduction pathways is discussed. Environmental stresses such as drought, cold, and salinity impose osmotic stress on plants, leading to imbalance in ionic homeostasis, oxidative damages, and growth inhibition. Understanding how plants respond to these stresses is critical to improve plant resistance. Reversible protein phosphorylation is one of the major mechanisms for mediating intracellular responses, including responses to osmotic changes. Indeed, several protein kinases have been shown to be activated by hyperosmotic stresses in different plant species. Because of the well known osmosensing pathway in yeast involving a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; SnRK2, sucrose nonfermenting 1-related protein kinase 2; SnRK3, sucrose nonfermenting 1-related protein kinase 3; CPDK, calcium-dependent protein kinase; ABA, abscisic acid; MES, 4-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid; HA, hemagglutinin; RT, reverse transcription; DTT, dithiothreitol; MBP, myelin basic protein. much interest was focused on the MAPK family in plants. In Arabidopsis, AtMPK6 and AtMPK4 were shown to be activated by hyperosmolarity, salt, cold, or drought (1Droillard M.J. Boudsocq M. Barbier-Brygoo H. Laurière C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 2Ichimura K. Mizoguchi T. Yoshida R. Yuasa T. Shinozaki K. Plant J. 2000; 24: 655-665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the tobacco SIPK was activated by hyperosmotic or salt stresses (3Droillard M.J. Thibivilliers S. Cazalé A.C. Barbier-Brygoo H. Laurière C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 474: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 4Mikolajczyk M. Awotunde O.S. Muszynska G. Klessig D.F. Dobrowolska G.

In alfalfa, SAMK was reported to be activated by cold and drought but not NaCl (6Jonak C. Kiegerl S. Ligterink W. Barker P.J. Huskisson N. Hirt H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11274-11279Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), whereas SIMK was activated by sorbitol, KCl, and NaCl (7Munnik T. Ligterink W. Meskiene I. Calderini O. Beyerly J. Musgrave A. Hirt H. Plant J. 1999; 20: 381-388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammals, MAPK cascades are composed of MAPK, MAPKK, and MAPKKK, each component being activated by phosphorylation by the upstream kinase. The involvement of MAPKK and MAPKKK in plant osmotic response was suggested by molecular and biochemical studies. The Arabidopsis MAPKKK AtMEKK1 was transcriptionally induced by salt stress and the protein was able to complement a yeast mutant affected in osmotic signaling (8Covic L. Silva N.F. Lew R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 242-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Moreover, Mizoguchi et al. (9Mizoguchi T. Ichimura K. Irie K. Morris P. Giraudat J. Matsumoto K. Shinozaki K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 56-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) described using two-hybrid and yeast complementation a possible MAPK cascade composed of the osmotically activated AtMPK4, AtMEK1 (MAPKK), and AtMEKK1. More recently, the activation of AtMPK4 by AtMEK1 (10Huang Y.F. Li H. Gupta R. Morris P.C. Luan S. Kieber J.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 1301-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and the interaction between SIPKK and SIPK (11Liu Y. Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2000; 13: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) were demonstrated in vitro independently of osmotic signaling. Interestingly, Kiegerl et al. (12Kiegerl S. Cardinale F. Siligan C. Gross A. Baudouin E. Liwosz A. Eklof S. Till S. Bogre L. Hirt H. Meskiene I. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) demonstrated that SIMKK activated SIMK in vivo and enhanced the SIMK activation by NaCl. Other kinase families have been shown to play a role in osmotic signaling. Among them, SOS2 (salt overly sensitive 2), which belongs to the sucrose nonfermenting 1-related protein kinase 3 (SnRK3) family, was transcriptionally induced by salt stress (13Liu J.P. Ishitani M. Halfter U. Kim C.S. Zhu J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3730-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). sos2 mutant displayed hypersensitivity to Na+ ions but not to mannitol (14Zhu J.K. Liu J. Xiong L. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1181-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar), suggesting a role of SOS2 in ion homeostasis. Using in vitro and yeast experiments, progress has been made in understanding the SOS2 pathway. Intramolecular interaction maintains SOS2 in an inactive form by autoinhibition (15Guo Y. Halfter U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.K. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1383-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), which is relieved by interaction with the calcium-binding protein SOS3 (16Ishitani M. Liu J. Halfter U. Kim C.S. Shi W. Zhu J.K. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 1667-1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 17Halfter U. Ishitani M. Zhu J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3735-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Then SOS3 targets SOS2 to the plasma membrane where the SOS2-SOS3 complex activates the SOS1 Na+/H+ antiporter via phosphorylation (18Quintero F.J. Ohta M. Shi H.Z. Zhu J.K. Pardo J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9061-9066Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 19Qiu Q.S. Guo Y. Dietrich M.A. Schumaker K.S. Zhu J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8436-8441Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Moreover, the complex also induces the transcriptional up-regulation of SOS1 by salt stress (20Shi H. Ishitani M. Kim C. Zhu J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6896-6901Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar). Calcium signals elicited by hyperosmotic stresses (21Sanders D. Pelloux J. Brownlee C. Harper J.F. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: S401-S417Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar) can also be sensed by calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPK), although very few data are available on the role of CDPK in osmotic signaling. Transcriptional induction of several CDPK was reported in response to salt, cold, or drought in different plant species (22Urao T. Katagiri T. Mizoguchi T. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Hayashida N. Shinozaki K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 23Yoon G.M. Cho H.S. Ha H.J. Liu J.R. Lee H.S. Plant. Mol.

Moreover, overexpression of OsCDPK7 conferred cold, salt, and drought tolerance on rice plants (24Saijo Y. Hata S. Kyozuka J. Shimamoto K. Izui K. Plant J. 2000; 23: 319-327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the activation of a rice CDPK in response to cold treatment was reported, but it occurred only 12 to 18 h after treatment, indicating that the kinase does not participate in the early response to stress but rather in the adaptative process (25Martin M.L. Busconi L. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 1442-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Transcript accumulation in response to NaCl or PEG treatments was also reported for several SHAGGY/GSK3-like kinases (AtSK) (26Piao H.L. Pih K.T. Lim J.H. Kang S.G. Jin J.B. Kim S.H. Hwang I. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1527-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 27Charrier B. Champion A. Henry Y. Kreis M. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 577-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). On the other hand, AtSK22 complemented a yeast salt stress-sensitive mutant (26Piao H.L. Pih K.T. Lim J.H. Kang S.G. Jin J.B. Kim S.H. Hwang I. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 1527-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and its overexpression enhanced salt and drought tolerance in Arabidopsis (28Piao H.L. Lim J.H. Kim S.J. Cheong G.W. Hwang I. Plant J. 2001; 27: 305-314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only few data are available on another group of the SNF1-related protein kinases (SnRK2), which appears unique to plants (29Hrabak E.M. Chan C.W. Gribskov M. Harper J.F. Choi J.H. Halford N. Kudla J. Luan S. Nimmo H.G. Sussman M.R. Thomas M. Walker Simmons K. Zhu J.K. Harmon A.C. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 666-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). A tobacco homolog of the Arabidopsis ASK1/SnRK2–4 was shown to be activated by hyperosmotic stress in cell suspension (4Mikolajczyk M. Awotunde O.S. Muszynska G. Klessig D.F. Dobrowolska G. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 165-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), whereas dehydration activated SnRK2-E/SnRK2–6 (30Yoshida R. Hobo T. Ichimura K. Mizoguchi T. Takahashi F. Aronso J. Ecker J.R. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In soybean, SPK3 and SPK4 were transcriptionally induced by drought and saline stress (31Yoon H.W. Kim M.C. Shin P.G. Kim J.S. Kim C.Y. Lee S.Y. Hwang I. Bahk J.D. Hong J.C. Han C. Cho M.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), whereas only SPK1 and SPK2 were activated by salt stress in yeast (32Monks D.E. Aghoram K. Courtney P.D. DeWald D.B. Dewey R.E. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1205-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We have previously reported the activation of several protein kinases that did not require calcium for their activity, in response to hyperosmotic stresses in Arabidopsis cell suspension (1Droillard M.J. Boudsocq M. Barbier-Brygoo H. Laurière C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Among them, one was identified to the MAPK AtMPK6 but the others remained unknown. In this work, we demonstrated that these unidentified kinases were also activated in Arabidopsis seedlings and belonged to the SnRK2 family. Molecular identification revealed that nine of the 10 SnRK2 were activated by hyperosmolarity. Then the possible involvement of SnRK2 in other signal transduction pathways such as saline stress, cold, and abscisic acid (ABA) was also tested. Plant Material—Arabidopsis thaliana cell suspension (Columbia ecotype) was cultured in JPL medium as previously described (1Droillard M.J. Boudsocq M. Barbier-Brygoo H. Laurière C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) at 23 °C in constant light. Cells were used after 5 days subculturing with 100 mg of fresh weight/ml cell density. A. thaliana (Columbia ecotype) seeds were sterilized and sown on a medium containing 5 mm KNO3, 2.5 mm K2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 6, 2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm Ca(NO3)2, 1 mm MES, 50 μm Fe-EDTA, Murashige and Skoog microelements (33Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (54341) Google Scholar), 10 g/liter sucrose, and 7 g/liter agar. The seedlings were grown at 21 °C with a 8-h dark/16-h light (110 μE m–2 s–1) photoperiod. Expression and Purification of His-tagged SnRK2—PCR was performed using the primers presented in Table I. The open reading frame of SnRK2-1, SnRK2-2, SnRK2-3, SnRK2-4, SnRK2-5, SnRK2-7, and SnRK2-10 were cloned as a KpnI-PstI fragment into pQE30 (Qiagen) and the open reading frame of SnRK2–6, SnRK2–8, and SnRK2–9 as a SphI-KpnI fragment. After transformation of Escherichia coli DH5α, positive clones containing the fragments were verified by DNA sequencing. His-tagged proteins were expressed in M15 E. coli (Qiagen) and purified using nickel columns according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen).Table IOligonucleotides used for SnRK2 cloning into pQE30 and RT-PCRGeneSequence of oligonucleotides forward (F) and reverse (R)SnRK2-1F5′-TTTGGTACCATGGACAAGTATGACGTTG-3′R5′-ATTCTGCAGTTTAAGCTTTGTCAGACTCTTG-3′SnRK2-2F5′-AAAGGTACCATGGATCCGGCGACT-3′R5′-TCCCTGCAGTCAGAGAGCATAAACTATCT-3′SnRK2-3F5′-TTAGGTACCATGGATCGAGCTCCG-3′R5′-GGCTGCAGATTAGAGAGCGTAAACTATC-3′SnRK2-4F5′-TTAGGTACCGCGAGAATGGACAA-3′R5′-CAGACTGCAGACCAAAATATCAACTTATTCT-3′SnRK2-5F5′-TTAGGTACCATGGACAAGTATGAGGTTG-3′R5′-TTTCTGCAGTTAAGCTTTGGGAGGC-3′SnRK2-6F5′-TTAGCATGCATGGATCGACCAGCAG-3′R5′-TTTGGTACCGTATCACATTGCGTACACA-3′SnRK2-7F5′-TTAGGTACCATGGAGAGATACGACATC-3′R5′-TTTCTGCAGTCATAGAGCACATACGAA-3′SnRK2-8F5′-TTAGCATGCATGGAGAGGTACGAAATA-3′R5′-TATGGTACCTTCACAAAGGGGAAAG-3′SnRK2-9F5′-TTAGCATGCATGGAGAAGTATGAGATGG-3′R5′-TTTGGTACCCTATGCGTAATCATCATAC-3′SnRK2-10F5′-TTAGGTACCATGGACAAGTACGAGCTT-3′R5′-TTTCTGCAGTTTTAACTGACTCGGACT-3′ Open table in a new tab GATEWAY Cloning of SnRK2—The open reading frame of SnRK2 genes were amplified by PCR using primers containing attB1 and attB2 sequences that were purchased from Invitrogen. The sequences of the oligonucleotides are presented in Table II. For the reverse primers, the stop codon was removed to allow C-terminal fusions. In vitro BP clonase recombination reactions using pDONR207 as entry vector were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The product of recombination reactions (BP reactions) was used to transform E. coli DH5α, and the positive clones were verified by DNA sequencing.Table IIOligonucleotides used for SnRK2 cloning into pDONR207GeneSequence of oligonucleotides forward (F) and reverse (R)SnRK2-1F5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCACCATGGACAAGTATGACGTT-3′R5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTGAGCTTTGTCAGACTCTTGA-3′SnRK2-2F5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCACCATGGATCCGGCGACT-3′R5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCGAGAGCATAAACTATCTCTCCA-3′SnRK2-3F5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCACCATGGATCGAGCTCCG-3′R5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCGAGAGCGTAAACTATCTCT-3′SnRK2-4F5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCACCATGGACAAGTACGAGCTG-3′R5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCACTTATTCTCACTTCTCCAC-3′SnRK2-5F5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCACCATGGACAAGTATGAGGTT-3′R5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCAGCTTTGGGAGGCTCT-3′SnRK2-6F5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCACCATGGATCGACCAGCAG-3′R5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCCATTGCGTACACAATCTC-3′SnRK2-7F5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCACCATGGAGAGATACGACATC-3′R5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCTAGAGCACATACGAAATC-3′SnRK2-8F5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCACCATGGAGAGGTACGAAATA-3′R5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCCAAAGGGGAAAGGAGA-3′SnRK2-9F5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCACCATGGAGAAGTATGAGATGG-3′R5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCTGCGTAATCATCATACCA-3′SnRK2-10F5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCACCATGGACAAGTACGAGCTT-3′R5′-GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCACTGACTCGGACTTCTC-3′ Open table in a new tab LR clonase recombination reactions to transfer DNA fragments from entry clones to destination vectors were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen) using pGreen-HiA-GW (see below) as destination vector. The product of recombination reactions (LR reactions) was used to transform E. coli DH5α. Construction of Destination Vector pGreen-HiA-GW—The bluntended GATEWAY conversion cassette C (Invitrogen) was inserted in the BamHI site of the intron-tagged HA-epitope cassette of pPILY vector (34Ferrando A. Farras R. Jasik J. Schell J. Koncz C. Plant J. 2000; 22: 553-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) after filling in the site with Klenow polymerase I. The resulting cassette was inserted in the KpnI site of pGreen0129 (www.pGreen.ac.uk). This construction allows the expression of HA-tagged proteins under the control of a 35 S promoter carrying a duplicated enhancer domain. RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from cell suspension 5 days after subculturing and from 6-day-old seedlings using NucleoSpin RNA Plant kit (Macherey-Nagel). The cDNA was synthesized from 4 μg of total RNA and oligo(dT) using the Superscript First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). PCR was run for 30–40 cycles using the primers presented in Table I. Amplified transcripts were separated on 0.8% (w/v) agarose gel and detected by ethidium bromide staining. The gene specificity of the primers was confirmed by subsequent cloning and sequencing of the amplified products (see section “Expression and Purification of His-tagged SnRK2”). As an internal standard, the level of ACTIN2 and ACTIN8 transcripts was monitored with the following primers: 5′-GATTCAGATGCCCAGAAGTCTTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCTGGAATGTGCTGAGGGAAG-3′ (reverse), because their combined expression profile was shown to be constitutive (35An Y.Q. McDowell J.M. Huang S. McKinney E.C. Chambliss S. Meagher R.B. Plant J. 1996; 10: 107-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Cell Suspension Treatments—Osmolarity was monitored using a freezing-point osmometer (Roebling, Berlin, Germany). Cells were equilibrated for 4 h in their culture medium containing 10 mm MES-Tris, pH 6.2, and adjusted to 200 mOsm with sucrose. After equilibration, extracellular medium was replaced by either the same volume of isoosmotic medium, 200 mOsm (10 mm MES-Tris, pH 6.2, 1 mm CaSO4, 190 mm sucrose), or hyperosmotic medium, 500 or 1000 mOsm (10 mm MES-Tris, pH 6.2, 1 mm CaSO4, 500 or 1000 mm sucrose). In the indicated cases, sucrose was replaced by 1000 mm mannitol or 650 mm NaCl to get similar hyperosmolarity. To stop treatment, cell suspension was filtered, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until use. Seedling Treatments—Seedlings were grown for 6 days in the medium described above (control medium). Plantlets were transferred to either isoosmotic medium (control medium) or to the same medium containing 500 or 1000 mm sucrose for 30 min. To stop treatment, seedlings were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until use. Preparation of Protoplasts—Cell cultures were used 3 days after subculturing at 33% (v/v) for isolation of protoplasts. Cells were collected by centrifugation (540 × g for 5 min) and resuspended in 25 ml of enzymatic solution (1% (w/v) cellulase RS (Yakult, Tokyo, Japan), 0.2% (w/v) macerozyme R10 (Yakult) in modified JPL medium (JPL-A), which does not contain sucrose but 30.5 g/liter glucose and 30.5 g/liter mannitol). Final volume was adjusted to 75 ml with JPL-A and cells were incubated for 3 h 30 min on a rotary shaker in constant light. Protoplasts were collected by centrifugation (150 × g for 5 min), washed with JPL-A, and resuspended in JPL medium containing 0.28 m sucrose. After centrifugation (150 × g for 5 min), floating protoplasts were harvested. Protoplast Transient Expression Assay—Typically, 1.5 × 106 protoplasts in 120 μl were mixed with 20–40 μg of plasmid DNA and 360 μl of PEG solution (25% (w/v) PEG 6000, 450 mm mannitol, 100 mm Ca(NO3)2). After an incubation at 22 °C in the dark for 15 min, the transfection mixture was washed with 275 mm Ca(NO3)2 and centrifuged at 150 × g for 5 min. Protoplasts were resuspended in 1 ml of JPL-A and incubated in the dark at 22 °C for 15 h before treatments. Protoplast Treatments—For osmotic stresses, protoplasts were centrifuged (150 × g for 5 min) and resuspended in the same volume of isoosmotic medium (JPL-A, 400 mOsm) or hyperosmotic medium containing mannitol (JPL-A supplemented with 660 mm mannitol, 1000 mOsm) or NaCl (JPL-A supplemented with 350 mm NaCl, 1000 mOsm) for 10 min. For cold treatment, protoplasts were incubated for 10 min at 4 °C or room temperature for the control. For ABA treatment, protoplasts were incubated for 20 min with 30 μm ABA or the same volume of ethanol solvent control. To stop treatments, protoplasts were centrifuged (150 × g for 5 min) and then the pellet was frozen in liquid nitrogen before storage at –80 °C until use. Preparation of Protein Extracts—Cells or seedlings were ground in liquid nitrogen and homogenized at 4 °C in extraction buffer EB1 (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml antipain). After centrifugation at 17,600 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, the supernatant was precipitated in 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid solution containing 10 mm NaF, washed twice with 80% (v/v) cold acetone, and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, the 17,600 × g supernatant was obtained as above in extraction buffer EB2 (EB1 modified in the concentration of three protectants: DTT (10 mm), orthovanadate (10 mm), and β-glycerophosphate (60 mm)). For protein extraction from protoplasts, extraction buffer EB3 corresponds to EB2 supplemented with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 75 mm NaCl. The protoplast pellet was melted on ice with 100 μl of EB3 and vortexed. Protein extract was recovered after centrifugation at 17,600 × g at 4 °C, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until use. In-Gel Kinase Assay—Protein extract (20 μg) was separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels embedded with 0.2 mg/ml myelin basic protein (MBP) or 0.5 mg/ml histone as substrates for the kinases. The gels were treated for protein renaturation as described by Zhang et al. (37Zhang S. Du H. Klessig D.F. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 435-449PubMed Google Scholar). For the activity, the gels were preincubated for 30 min at room temperature in kinase activity buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm DTT, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm orthovanadate). Phosphorylation was performed for 1 h in 8 ml of the same buffer supplemented with 25 μm cold ATP and 2.9 MBq of [γ-33P]ATP per gel. Then the gels were washed extensively in 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and 1% (w/v) disodium pyrophosphate solution. The protein kinase activity was detected on the dried gels by the Storm imaging system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation assays were carried out either with the polyclonal anti-HA antibody (Sigma) or with a polyclonal plant kinase antibody. It was raised against 15 amino acids of the catalytic domain of SnRK2 kinases (GYSKSSLLHSRPKST, Eurogentec). Protein extract (200 μg from cells or 100 μg from protoplasts) was incubated with either 35 μg of anti-SnRK2 or 1.6 μg of anti-HA (Sigma) antibodies in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 60 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml antipain, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) for 3 h. Then 30 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma) was added and incubation was continued for another 1 h. The immunoprecipitate was washed 4 times in immunoprecipitation buffer and twice in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 12 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm orthovanadate) and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Kinase activity of precipitated proteins was analyzed by the in-gel kinase assay as previously described. Competition was performed with two different peptides: the SnRK2 peptide used for immunization and one AtSK peptide (KKVLQDRRYKNRELQC, Eurogentec). The antibody was preincubated for 10 min with the peptide before adding protein extract and immunoprecipitation buffer. The peptide was used at a final concentration of 0.2 mm. Immunoblotting—Recombinant proteins (100 ng) or total extracts (10 μg from protoplasts or 20 μg from cells) were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and immunoblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Blots were blocked with 5% (w/v) defatted milk in TBS-Tween (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 154 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) and probed with either 1:2000 polyclonal anti-SnRK2 or 1:5000 monoclonal anti-HA (Sigma) antibodies. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) were used as secondary antibodies and the reactions were visualized using the nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate kit (Bio-Rad) and enhanced chemiluminescence ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences), respectively.

Several Non-MAPK Protein Kinases Are Activated by Hyperosmotic and Saline Stresses in Arabidopsis Cells and Plantlets—To investigate the activation of Ca2+-independent protein kinases in response to hyperosmotic stresses, in-gel kinase assays were performed in the absence of calcium using MBP or histone as substrates. Moderate (500 mOsm) or high (1000 mOsm) hyperosmotic stresses were studied in comparison to an isoosmotic control condition as previously described (1Droillard M.J. Boudsocq M. Barbier-Brygoo H. Laurière C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). When Arabidopsis cell suspension was submitted to hyperosmolarity, the activation of several Ca2+-independent kinases was observed using MBP as a substrate: two thin activity bands with apparent molecular masses of 42 and 35 kDa and a thick one around 37–38 kDa (Fig. 1A). The activations were greater when the stress strength was increased. When the same extracts were analyzed using histone as a substrate, a similar activation profile was visualized, with two distinct bands with apparent molecular masses of 38 and 37 kDa in addition to the 42- and 35-kDa bands. These four protein kinases activated by hyperosmolarity can phosphorylate both histone and MBP, indicating that they do not belong to the MAPK family. By contrast, the 44-kDa kinase active on MBP but almost not on histone has already been identified to the MAPK AtMPK6 (1Droillard M.J. Boudsocq M. Barbier-Brygoo H. Laurière C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 527: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The effect of two other osmolytes, mannitol and NaCl, was analyzed in conditions leading to the same osmolarity (Fig. 1B). When cells were treated with 1 m sucrose, 1 m mannitol, or 650 mm NaCl, similar activation profiles were observed, indicating that these kinase activations represent a general response to osmotic stress. When Arabidopsis seedlings were submitted to moderate and high hyperosmotic stresses, several protein kinases were activated with profiles comparable with those observed in cells (Fig. 1C). Using MBP as a substrate, only the 42-, 38-, and 37-kDa activity bands were visualized, whereas on histone, the four non-MAPK protein kinases were detected. Unlike in cells, kinase activations hardly increased in plantlets submitted to high hyperosmolarity in comparison with moderate stress. This result suggests that signaling induced by high hyperosmotic medium on seedlings (1 m sucrose) corresponds only to signaling induced by a moderate hyperosmotic condition on cell suspension (500 mm sucrose). Coherently, the 44 kDa displayed a strong activation in plantlets exposed to high stress, whereas the activity of this kinase decreased in cell suspension when the stress strength increased. As in cells, the 44-kDa kinase corresponds to At-MPK6 (data not shown). Thus, the four non-MAPK protein kinases are a"

A wide-field, movement-sensitive visual neuron in the brain of the locust was studied by presenting simulated approaching, receding, and translating objects. The neuron's responses could be described simply by multiplying the velocity of the image edge (dtheta/dtau) with an exponential function of the size of the object's image on the retina (e-alpha theta). Because this product peaks before the image reaches its maximum size during approach, this neuron can anticipate collision. The neuron's activity peaks approximately when the approaching object reaches a certain angular size. Because this neuron receives distinct inputs about image size and velocity, the dendritic tree of a single neuron may function as a biophysical device that can carry out a multiplication of two independent input signals."

Unlike ubiquitylation, sumoylation of target proteins does not lead to proteasomal degradation but can affect diverse functions of the protein, such as subcellular localization, protein/DNA interaction, or enzymatic activity (5Schwartz D.C.

In addition, the conjugating and deconjugating machinery are conserved from yeast to humans and perform essential functions in yeast. The only yeast proteins known to be modified by Smt3 are the nonessential septins involved in cytokinesis and the essential Pol30, Top2, and Pds5 (7Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.L. Pyrowolakis G.

Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 690-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Recent proteomic approaches in mammalian cells have identified new proteins that are subject to SUMO-1 and SUMO-2 modification (10Zhao Y. Kwon S.W. Anselmo A. Kaur K. White M.A. J. Biol.

The confirmation of sumoylation of target proteins in these approaches was limited by the need for protein specific antibodies. Previously, we have shown that the deconjugating enzyme Ulp1 is tethered to the nuclear pore channel via nuclear import receptors (13Panse V.G. Kuster B. Gerstberger T. Hurt E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The biological significance of such a tethering mechanism is poorly understood because of the lack of knowledge about its substrate proteins. Yeast has served as a powerful, rapid, genetic and in vivo biochemical model system to gain mechanistic insights into protein function in eukaryotes. Hence, we applied a proteomic approach in yeast to unravel the SUMO proteome. We have enriched sumoylated proteins from yeast cell lysates using the high affinity tag of Protein A (ProtA). In this study, we provide a list of proteins that are potentially modified by Smt3. Using rapid biochemical assays, we confirmed sumoylation for some of the isolated proteins. Yeast and Microbiological Methods—Yeast strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in the supplemental information. Microbiological techniques, plasmid transformation and recovery, mating, sporulation of diploids, and tetrad analysis were done as described by Santos-Rosa et al. (17Santos-Rosa H. Moreno H. Simos G. Segref A. Fahrenkrog B. Pante N. Hurt E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6826-6838Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Genomic integration of TAP (TRP1 marker) in a SMT3 shuffle strain was performed according to Rigaut et al. (18Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar). Affinity Purifications and “SUMO Fingerprint”—The ProtA-Smt3 containing the yeast strain was grown to an A600 nm of 3.5 in 2 liters of YPD medium (yeast extract/peptone/dextrose) at 30 °C. The cells were washed and resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.4, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. After 15 min of incubation, the cells were pelleted and resuspended in 1.2 m sorbitol, 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. The cells were spheroplasted with 10 mg of zymolyase (20T) at 30 °C for 30 min. The pelleted spheroplasts were treated with 50 mg of iodoacetamide for 15–30 min on ice and then lysed by vortexing with glass beads in LB buffer (150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl). After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with IgG-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed with LB buffer and increasing concentrations of MgCl2 (0.1–2 m) followed by a wash with LB buffer and final elution with 0.5 m acetic acid (pH 3.5). The eluate was lyophilized, resuspended in SDS-loading buffer, and analyzed on a SDS 4–12% gradient polyacrylamide gel. Western blot analysis was performed using anti-ProtA antibodies (14Simos G. Segref A. Fasiolo F. Hellmuth K. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5437-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). TAP purifications of RNA polymerase subunits were performed as described previously (18Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (2287) Google Scholar), except that the cells were incubated with 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide for 30 min on ice prior to lysis. The final eluates from calmodulin-Sepharose were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed on a 4–12% gradient gel. The antibodies used were polyclonal rabbit anti-ProtA horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Dako Cytomation; 1:1000), polyclonal rabbit anti-myc (Biomol; 1:2000), and horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit (Bio-Rad; 1:3000). For Western blot analysis, ECL detection was performed (Amersham Biosciences). For the SUMO fingerprint, lysates from 10 units A600 nm of cells were prepared using glass bead lysis in 20% cold trichloroacetic acid. The protein pellets were washed with cold ethanol, air-dried, and resuspended in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer, and 5 μl were analyzed on 4–12% and 3–8% gradient gels. Western analysis was performed using anti-ProtA antibodies as described by Santos-Rosa et al. (17Santos-Rosa H. Moreno H. Simos G. Segref A. Fahrenkrog B. Pante N. Hurt E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6826-6838Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis of Rpc128 was performed using the QuikChange site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Rpc82 was mutagenized using nested PCR-based techniques. Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. Protein Identification by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry—The gel lane containing purified ProtA-Smt3 conjugates was cut in 48 slices across the entire separation range of the gel. Each gel slice was treated with trypsin as described by Shevchenko et al. (19Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). The generated peptide pools were subjected to partial peptide sequencing using nanocapillary reverse-phase chromatography (75-μm inner diameter column) coupled directly to an ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ DecaXP, Thermo Finnigan). The proteins were unambiguously identified by searching the peptide sequencing spectra against a translated version of the yeast genome using the software Mascot (Matrix Science). In cases where the identification of a protein was based on only a single sequenced peptide, the identification was independently verified by searching the mass spectrometry data using the sequence tag algorithm (20Mann M. Wilm M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 4390-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). A Proteomic Approach to Identifying Sumoylated Substrate Proteins in Yeast—To enrich for sumoylated proteins by affinity purification, a yeast strain expressing ProtA-tagged Smt3 instead of endogenous Smt3 was used. This modified Smt3 version was found to be functional in the temperature range from 23 to 37 °C in a yeast strain lacking chromosomal SMT3 (Fig. 1A). Under conditions that preserve sumoylation (see “Experimental Procedures”), a cell lysate from the strain expressing ProtA-Smt3 was passed over an IgG-Sepharose column to enrich for ProtA-Smt3-modified proteins. Because sumoylated proteins could be part of multimeric complexes, we treated ProtA-Smt3 conjugates immobilized on IgG-Sepharose with increasing concentrations of MgCl2. This treatment is known to disrupt protein-protein interactions within protein complexes but does not dissociate the ProtA tag from IgG-Sepharose (14Simos G. Segref A. Fasiolo F. Hellmuth K. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5437-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Indeed, this harsh MgCl2 incubation removed many nonsumoylated proteins, but ProtA-Smt3 conjugates remained bound to the beads (Fig. 1B). Finally, the ProtA-Smt3 conjugates were eluted from IgG-Sepharose by acetic acid and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, numerous bands ranging from 40 to 200 kDa became visible (Fig. 1B, lane 8; (Coomassie)). The corresponding Western blot using antibodies against the ProtA tag revealed that many of these bands carried ProtA-Smt3 (Fig. 1B, lane 8;(Western)). To elucidate the identity of these proteins, the gel lane was sliced into 48 pieces across the entire separation range to sample modified proteins without bias as to size or abundance. Each gel slice was trypsinized and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”). The data obtained are summarized in Table I. Although all of the proteins listed in Table I were unambiguously identified, we were unable to directly sequence the Smt3-modified peptides of the identified proteins. Therefore, it is possible that a fraction of the identified proteins are contaminants (e.g. abundant enzymes of metabolic/anabolic pathways or “sticky” proteins) or high affinity interactors to genuinely sumoylated proteins that were not removed by MgCl2 treatment. However, for a representative number of identified proteins, we show that they are indeed sumoylated (see below). We have grouped the proteins isolated via ProtA-Smt3 into classes according to available functional annotations (Table I). Evidently, our proteomic approach has identified factors that are known to be sumoylated in yeast. These are the yeast septins Cdc3, Cdc11, and Sep7 (4Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and Pol30 (PCNA), which is involved in DNA synthesis and repair (7Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2002; 419: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar). The identification of known sumoylated proteins confirms the validity of the applied method and demonstrates how our proteomic approach can be used to identify SUMO-targeted proteins in yeast. However, our list exhibits a vast number of proteins, which were previously not known to be sumoylated in yeast. Notably, these SUMO-carrying substrate proteins point to diverse functions in many cellular pathways.Table IIdentification of sumoylated substrate proteins in yeastFunctional categorySumoylated substrate proteinsPol IRpa190, Rpac40Pol IIRpb3Pol IIIRpc160, Rpc128, Rpc82, Rpac40, Rpc37Transcription (Pol II)Tfg1, Tfg2, Toa1, Anc1, Med7, Mot1, Tup1, Ssn6, Pdr1, Stb3, Spt16, Caf45′ capping/decappingAbd1, Cet1, Ceg1, Dcp2Sumo pathwayUba2, Aos1Ubiquitin pathwayCdc48, Rpn1, Rpn7, Rpn12, Pre9, Ubr1SeptinsCdc3, Cdc10, Cdc11, Sep7, Bni4PolyadenylationCft2, Pab1, Ref2DNA replication/repairPo130, Tof1Chromatin remodelingHda1, Rsc8, Rsc9Transport factorsSub2, She3, Rna1SecretionSec27, Cop1, Gcs1Tubulin chaperonesCct3, Cct5, Cct8, Tub2, Tub1MeiosisUme1RNA metabolismRnr2Ribosomal proteinsRps31, Rpsob, Rpl5, Rps3tRNA synthetasesIIs1, Grs1, Gus1, Mes1, Ded81, Yhr020wUnknownYn1042w (Bop3)OthersAct1, Ade12, Adh1, Adh3, Apa1, Aro2, Aro4, Cdc19, Cpa2, Cox1, Dpm1, Eft2, Erg9, Faa1, Fba1, Gcd2, Gcd11, Gfa1, Gnd1, Gnd2, Gpd1, His4, Hom2, Hsc82, Hsp60, Hsp82, Hvg1, Ilv2, Ilv3, Kar2, Lcb1, Lcw1, Leu2, Lys21, Pdc1, Pep4, Pgk1, Por1, Psa1, Rhr2, Sam1, Scs2, Sec53, Shm1, Shm2, Snz2, Ssa1, Ssa2, Ssb1, Ssb2, Ssc1, Tdh3, Tef1, Tef2, Tfp1, Tif1, Tif34, Trp2, Trp3, Trp5, Tuf1, Ura7, Vma2, Ydj1, Yef3, Yg1157w, Yhm2, Ykr025w, Yjr024c Open table in a new tab Developing a SUMO Fingerprint—To confirm that ProtA-Smt3-purified proteins are sumoylated in vivo, we developed a simple verification assay, wherein a suspect target protein was genomically TAP-tagged at the C terminus to allow sensitive detection using anti-ProtA antibodies. In a next step, this TAP-tagged putative target was co-expressed with either of the three different Smt3 constructs that differ in size: Smt3 (∼15 kDa), myc3-Smt3 (∼35 kDa), and GFP-Smt3 (∼45 kDa). The mobility of the target protein-SUMO conjugates generated in the three different yeast strains should decrease depending on the size of the different SUMO constructs. Thus, if a target is conjugated to Smt3, myc3-Smt3, or GFP-Smt3, one would expect a stepwise decrease in mobility on SDS-PAGE, thus generating a SUMO fingerprint for that substrate protein. To validate the assay, we tested a known SUMO substrate, Cdc3, which exhibits four sumoylation sites (4Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) (see also Table I). Cell lysates were prepared from Cdc3-TAP strains, which expressed either Smt3, myc3-Smt3, or GFP-Smt3 (see “Experimental Procedures”). After SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-ProtA antibodies, both the unmodified and the various SUMO-modified Cdc3 forms could be discerned, which differ in size according to the Smt3 construct used (Fig. 2). Thus, the Cdc3 SUMO fingerprint confirmed the sumoylation of Cdc3 (4Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 981-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Next, we applied this assay to a number of proteins present in our “SUMO catalogue,” for which sumoylation has not been yet demonstrated. Clearly, Ubc9 (SUMO E2 carrier protein), Tup1, Ssn6, and Pdr1 (transcription factors), Rsc8 (chromatin remodeling), Bop3 (unknown function), and Rpc82 (Pol-III subunit) all revealed a typical SUMO fingerprint (Fig. 2). Altogether, we concluded from these studies that affinity purification of ProtA-tagged Smt3 yielded novel sumoylated substrate proteins. RNA Polymerases I, II, and III Are Sumoylated—In our SUMO proteome, we have obtained several subunits of RNA Pol-I, -II, and -III. To show sumoylation for these subunits in a direct way, we affinity-purified RNA Pol-I, -II, and -III complexes using several bait proteins. To probe for sumoylation, we affinity-purified Pol-III (via TAP-tagged Rpc82 and Rpc128) from cells that expressed myc-tagged Smt3 to allow Western analysis. In agreement with the SUMO fingerprint, sumoylated Rpc82 is detected in the purified Pol-III complex via the myc epitope (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 3). The second prominent SUMO-modified band in Pol-III could correspond to Rpc128 (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 3). To assign the Western bands to sumoylated versions of Rpc82 and Rpc128, we mutated the several consensus sumoylation sites in these proteins. Notably, the K17R mutation in Rpc128 and the K406R mutation in Rpc82 caused the disappearance of the attributed SUMO bands (Fig. 3A, compare lane 1 with 2 and lane 3 with 4). Mutating the other consensus sites (K927R in Rpc128, K406R in Rpc82) did not change the sumoylation pattern (data not shown). Similar studies were performed to demonstrate that subunits of RNA polymerases I and II are SUMO-modified as well. As baits for TAP purifications, we used Rpa190 (Pol-I), Rpb2 (Pol-II), Rpb8 (common subunit of Pol-I/II/III), and Rpac40 (common subunit of Pol-I/III). As shown in Fig. 3B, purified RNA polymerases I and II exhibited sumoylated bands mainly in the high molecular weight range of the gel (Mr = >100,000). By comparing the different sumoylated bands in various Pol-I/II/III preparations, we concluded that Rpa190 and Rpa135 (the first and second subunit of Pol-I), Rpb1 (first subunit of Pol-II), and Rpc128 and Rpc82 (second and third subunit of Pol-III) are sumoylated. As expected, a mixed pattern of sumoylation was observed for purified Rpac40 and Rpb8, which were present in different RNA polymerases. Taken together, our data show that all three yeast RNA polymerases are targets of sumoylation. Notably, mainly the larger subunits of Pol-I/II/III become modified by SUMO. Employing a powerful affinity purification of functional ProtA-tagged yeast SUMO from lysates in combination with mass spectrometry, we could isolate a large number of potential SUMO substrates and confirm sumoylation for a few of these proteins by different methods. Conspicuous targets of sumoylation are nuclear proteins, which are part of different multisubunit gene expression machineries. These include components of complexes involved in chromatin remodeling, rRNA and mRNA transcription, and mRNA processing (see Table I, Table II, Table III). In agreement with these observations, both SUMO-conjugating and deconjugating enzymes are predominantly located in the nucleus and at the nuclear pore complexes (3Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Moreover, our findings are consistent with data from the mammalian system, which have shown that many SUMO substrates are part of nuclear complexes with a wide role in transcription and genome organization (6Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 690-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Moreover, the isolation of conjugates based on the ProtA methodology could be exploited for other ubiquitin-like proteins.Table IIYeast strainsStrain nameGenotypeOriginFY23MATa, ura3, trp1, leu2, HIS3Derived from S288CFY86MATα, ura3, his3, leu2, TRP1Derived from S288CSmt3 shuffle strainMATα trp1 his3 leu2 lys2 ura3 smt3::kanMX4 (ARS/CEN pURA3-SMT3)This studyRPC82/SMT3 shuffle strainura3, his3, leu2, lys2, trp1, smt3::kanMX4, rpc82::his3 (pRS316-RPC82, pRS316-SMT3)This studyRPC82 wt/myc3-SMT3ura3, his3, leu2, lys2, trp1, smt3::kanMX4, rpc82::his3 (pRS314-RPC82-TAP wt, pRS315-myc3-SMT3)This studyRPC82 K406R/myc3-SMT3ura3, his3, leu2, lys2, trp1, smt3::kanMX4, rpc82::his3 (pRS314-RPC82-TAP K406R, pRS315-myc3-SMT3)This studyRPC128 shuffle strainMATa, ura3, his3, leu2, lys2, TRP1, rpc128::kanMX4 (pRS316-RPC128)This studyRPC128/SMT3 shuffle strainura3, his3, leu2, lys2, TRP1, rpc128::kanMX4, smt3::kanMX4 (pRS316-RPC128, pRS316-SMT3)This studyRPC128 wt/myc3-SMT3ura3, his3, leu2, lys2, TRP1, rpc128::kanMX4, smt3::kanMX4 (pRS315-RPC128-TAP wt, pRS313-myc3-SMT3)This studyRPC128 K17R/myc3-SMT3ura3, his3, leu2, lys2, TRP1, rpc128::kanMX4, smt3::kanMX4 (pRS315-RPC128-TAP K17R, pRS313-myc3-SMT3)This study Open table in a new tab Table IIIPlasmids and constructionsPlasmidConstruction details/referencespRS315-NOP1::GFP21Hellmuth K.

How sensitive is our assay? Not all the proteins obtained in the proteomic approach exhibited the SUMO fingerprint, suggesting either the proteins represent contaminants or low abundance SUMO conjugates. Indeed, in the case of Rpc128, we were unable to obtain a SUMO fingerprint. However, upon enrichment by TAP-purification, we have been able to detect the sumoylation of Rpc128 via myc tagging of Smt3 and Western blot analysis. Moreover, Rna1 did not show the SUMO fingerprint or a myc-Smt3 Western signal when TAP-purified, 2V. Panse, unpublished results. suggesting that it is a very low abundant conjugate or a contaminant in our preparation. The mammalian homologue of Rna1 (RanGAP) was shown to be modified by SUMO-1 (15Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, both the methods could be useful to analyze SUMO modification in protein complexes and follow the changes of sumoylation patterns during formation and turnover of these large multimeric assemblies. Interestingly, the human homologues of the yeast RNA polymerase subunits Rpc160, Rpc128, Rpc82, Rpc37, Rpc25, Rpac40, and Rpabc27 are found to be “potentially” sumoylated in a proteomic approach using mammalian cells (10Zhao Y. Kwon S.W. Anselmo A. Kaur K. White M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20999-21002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, sumoylation of RNA polymerases is conserved, suggesting that this post-translational modification is important for gene expression. Whether this modification affects the catalytic activity or assembly of RNA polymerases remains to be shown. Did our large scale approach cover the entire SUMO proteome? We did not find Top2 (topoisomerase II) and Pds5 (sister chromatin cohesion), which are known to be sumoylated in yeast. It is possible that strong association with chromosomes (8Bachant J. Alcasabas A. Blat Y. Kleckner N. Elledge S.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1169-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 9Stead K. Aguilar C. Hartman T. Drexel M. Meluh P. Guacci V. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) prevented their release into the soluble cell lysates. Moreover, sumoylated proteins that were not identified in our proteomic approach may be low abundant. Although we could not unravel the entire SUMO proteome, the potent affinity purification of Smt3-ProtA in combination with mass spectrometry was able to identify several unknown SUMO substrates. Indeed similar proteomic approaches in mammalian cells lead to the isolation of a distinct set of proteins (10Zhao Y. Kwon S.W. Anselmo A. Kaur K. White M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20999-21002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 12Li T. Evdokimov E. Shen R.F. Chao C.C. Tekle E. Wang T. Stadtman E.R. Yang D.C. Chock P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8551-8556Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). It is thus conceivable that only several different proteomic approaches will give a more comprehensive list of sumoylated proteins. SUMO-1 has been implicated as a versatile regulator of protein function (16Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar). However, two fundamental questions regarding its biological function remain to be answered. Why is SUMO-1 essential in most eukaryotic cells? What are these essential processes? The loss of Smt3 modification in Pol30, Top2, and Pds5 were shown not to be essential for the viability of yeast (7Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2002; 419: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar, 8Bachant J. Alcasabas A. Blat Y. Kleckner N. Elledge S.J. Mol.

Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Our mutational analysis, which inactivated the major sumoylation sites within Rpc128 or Rpc82, indicated that cell growth is not inhibited. 3U. Hardeland and V. Panse, unpublished data. Thus, the influence of SUMO-1 on Pol-III function remains unknown. It is possible that inactivation of single sumoylation sites are not sufficient to affect Pol-III assembly/function. Clearly, more work is required to understand why Pol-III, as well as Pol-I and Pol-II, transcription machineries are sumoylated in vivo. Further, insights into these issues can be gained using the power of yeast genetics. Our catalogue of sumoylated proteins in yeast can trigger further studies to reveal the essential nature of sumoylation. We thank Dr. D. Kressler and S. Neumann for fruitful discussions."

In epithelial cells at the initial phase of polarization, these proteins are recruited to cadherin-based spotlike adherens junctions (AJs). As a first step to clarify the function of ZO-1, we successfully generated mouse epithelial cell clones lacking ZO-1 expression (ZO-1-/- cells) by homologous recombination. Unexpectedly, in confluent cultures, ZO-1-/- cells were highly polarized with well organized AJs/TJs, which were indistinguishable from those in ZO-1+/+ cells by electron microscopy. In good agreement, by immunofluorescence microscopy, most TJ proteins including claudins and occludin appeared to be normally concentrated at TJs of ZO-1-/- cells with the exception that a ZO-1 deficiency significantly up- or down-regulated the recruitment of ZO-2 and cingulin, another TJ scaffold protein, respectively, to TJs. When the polarization of ZO-1-/- cells was initiated by a Ca2+ switch, the initial AJ formation did not appear to be affected; however, the subsequent TJ formation (recruitment of claudins/occludin to junctions and barrier establishment) was markedly retarded. This retardation as well as the disappearance of cingulin were rescued completely by exogenous ZO-1 but not by ZO-2 expression. Quantitative evaluation of ZO-1/ZO-2 expression levels led to the conclusion that ZO-1 and ZO-2 would function redundantly to some extent in junction formation/epithelial polarization but that they are not functionally identical.

TJs constitute the epithelial junctional complex together with adherens junctions (AJs) and desmosomes and are located in the most apical part of the complex (1Farquhar M.G. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 375-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (2078) Google Scholar). TJs seal cells to create a primary barrier to the diffusion of solutes across the cellular sheet and also function as a boundary between the apical and basolateral membrane domains to produce their polarization (2Schneeberger E.E. Lynch R.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: L647-L661PubMed Google Scholar, 3Anderson J.M. Van Itallie C.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G467-G475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Balda M.S. Matter K. J.

Therefore, TJs are essential structures for epithelial cells to exert their physiological functions. On ultrathin-section electron microscopy, TJs appear as a series of discrete sites of apparent fusion involving the outer leaflets of the plasma membranes of adjacent cells (1Farquhar M.G. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 375-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (2078) Google Scholar). On freeze-fracture electron microscopy, TJs appear as a set of continuous, anastomosing intramembranous particle strands (TJ strands) (6Staehelin L.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1974; 39: 191-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). TJ strands are mainly composed of linearly polymerized integral membrane proteins called claudins with molecular masses of ∼23 kDa, which comprise a multigene family consisting of >20 members (5Tsukita S. Furuse M. Itoh M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1979) Google Scholar, 7Furuse M. Fujita K. Hiiragi T. Fujimoto K. Tsukita S. J.

Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 268-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Claudin molecules bear four transmembrane domains with both NH2 and COOH termini located in the cytoplasm. In addition to claudins, two other types of integral membrane proteins have been reported to concentrate at TJs, occludin (9Furuse M. Hirase T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1777-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (2073) Google Scholar), and JAM (10Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L. Romano M. Fruscella P. Panzeri C. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Villa A. Simmons D. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). One of the interesting questions regarding the molecular mechanism behind the morphogenesis of simple epithelial cells, i.e. epithelial polarization, is how claudins are polymerized exclusively at the most apical part of the junctional complex, i.e. more apically than AJs. In this connection, various scaffold proteins have been reported to be concentrated at the cytoplasmic surfaces of the junctional complex regions to determine the specialization and localization of junctions (5Tsukita S. Furuse M. Itoh M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1979) Google Scholar, 11Kowalczyk A.P. Bomslaeger E.A. Norvell S.M. Palka H.L. Green K.J. Int. Rev.

At TJs, three closely related proteins called ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3 were identified to constitute the plaque structures underlying plasma membranes (13Mitic L.L. Anderson J.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 121-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 14González-Mariscal L. Betanzos A. Avila-Flores A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) together with various proteins including cingulin, symplekin, Par-3·Par-6·atypical protein kinase C complex, ZONAB, and guanine nucleotide exchange factor-H1/Lfc (15Citi S.

ZO-1 with a molecular mass of ∼220 kDa was first identified as an antigen for a monoclonal antibody raised against a junction-enriched fraction from the liver (20Stevenson B.R. Siliciano J.D. Mooseker M.S. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 755-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar). ZO-2 then was identified as a 160-kDa protein that was coimmunoprecipitated with ZO-1 from cell lysates (21Gumbiner B. Lowenkopf T. Apatira D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3460-3464Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). A phosphorylated 130-kDa protein was also found in the ZO-1 immunoprecipitate (22Balda M.S. Gonzalez-Mariscal L. Matter K. Cereijido M. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) and is now called ZO-3. The cloning and sequencing of cDNAs encoding these molecules showed that all have three PDZ domains (PDZ1–3), one Src homology 3 domain, and one guanylate kinase-like homologue domain in this order from their NH2 termini, indicating that ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3 are membrane-associated guanylate kinase-like homologues (MAGUKs) (23Itoh M.

In well polarized epithelial cells, ZO-1 is exclusively concentrated at TJs through its direct binding to claudins (27Itoh M. Furuse M. Morita K. Kubota K. Saitou M. Tsukita S. J.

ZO-1 forms independent complexes with ZO-2 and ZO-3 (32Wittchen E.S. Haskins J. Stevenson B.R. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that, together with ZO-2 (and ZO-3), ZO-1 plays a key role in the establishment of not only TJs but also AJs during epithelial polarization. To date, intensive efforts have been made to clarify the functions of ZO-1, for example, through exogenous expression of various deletion mutants of ZO-1 (29Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A.

Cell. 2000; 11: 1687-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) but it has been difficult to experimentally dissect the physiological functions of ZO-1. Although there were no experimental data, this difficulty was thought to be partly due to a possible functional redundancy between ZO-1 and ZO-2 (and also ZO-3). One of the most promising approaches to this problem would be to suppress the expression of endogenous ZO-1 in epithelial cells and to observe what happens in these cells. For this purpose, we attempted to apply the technology of RNA interference (35Yu J.Y. DeRuiter S.L. Turner D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6047-6052Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar) to cultured mouse epithelial cells but failed to suppress the expression of ZO-1 completely. During the course of such RNA interference experiments, we noted that, to examine the functions of constituents of junctions in detail, the expression of each constituent should be “completely” and “stably” suppressed in cultured epithelial cells. In this study, we report that ZO-1-deficient mutants of cultured mouse epithelial cells were successfully generated by conventional homologous recombination and characterized in detail from the viewpoint of junction assembly. We believe that the gene knock-out at the level of cultured epithelial cells is important for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the junction formation and epithelial polarization.

As shown in Fig. 1A, an 8.5-kb BstXI/NlaIV fragment and a 1.7-kb PvuII fragment were ligated to the targeting vector cassette. Gene targeting was performed twice to delete both alleles of the ZO-1 gene. The first and second targeting vectors contained a β-geo (β-galactosidase/neomycin-resistance gene) and hygromycin-resistance gene in the middle, respectively. For the first gene targeting, the targeting vector was linearized at a unique SacII site located at the 5′ end of the 5′-homologous fragment and then the trypsinized/floated Eph4 cells (2.0 × 107) were electroporated with 100 μg of linearized targeting vector DNA using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). Cells were plated on six 10-cm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum for 48 h and selected by adding G418 at a final concentration of 400 μg/ml. At day 14–17 of culture, the G418-resistant colonies were removed and screened by Southern blotting of EcoRI-digested DNA with the 3′-external probe. Correctly targeted clones were identified by a 8.6-kb band in addition to the 21-kb band of the wild-type allele. For the second gene targeting, the targeting vector was linearized at a unique XhoI site located at the 3′ end of the 3′-homologous fragment, and electroporation was performed as described above. Cells were cultured in the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum for 48 h, and hygromycin and G418 were added at a final concentration of 300 μg/ml each. Colonies resistant to both hygromycin and G418 were screened by Southern blotting of EcoRI-digested DNA with the 3′-external probe, and correctly targeted clones were identified by a 9.0-kb band in addition to the 8.6-kb band of the first allele targeted. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were cultured on Transwell filters 12 mm in diameter for 2 days. For ZO-1, ZO-2, Par-3, claudin-3, occludin, and E-cadherin staining, cells were fixed with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min on ice (38Hayashi K. Yonemura S. Matsui T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1149-1158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For afadin staining, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. These cells were washed with PBS and then treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. For ZO-3, cingulin, and JAM staining, cells were fixed with 100% methanol for 3 min at -20 °C. After a wash with PBS, cells were soaked in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS and incubated with the respective primary antibody for 1 h. Cells then were washed with PBS extensively and incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated (Molecular Probes) or Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min (Jackson ImmunoResearch). They were washed with PBS and mounted in ProLong Antifader (Molecular Probes). Ca2+ Switch—Cells were plated at 5 × 104 cells/well on Transwell filters 12 mm in diameter (Corning) and grown in the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum for 48 h. They were then washed twice with PBS and cultured overnight in a low Ca2+ medium; S-MEM, calcium-free minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 5 μm CaCl2 and 10% fetal calf serum that had been pretreated with Chelex resin (Bio-Rad). For the Ca2+ switch, the low Ca2+ medium in both the upper and lower chambers was replaced with the normal Ca2+ medium (minimum Eagle's medium with 1.8 μm CaCl2 and 10% fetal calf serum). Measurement of Transepithelial Electric Resistance (TER) and Paracellular Tracer Flux—Aliquots of 5 × 104 cells were plated on Transwell filters 12 mm in diameter (8 filters for each cell line), and the culture medium was exchanged every day. After a 6-day culture, TER was measured directly in culture media using a Millicell-ERS epithelial voltohmmeter (Millipore). The TER values were calculated by subtracting the background TER of blank filters and by multiplying by the surface area of the filter. For paracellular tracer flux assay, at 2, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h after the Ca2+ switch, FITC-dextran with a molecular mass of 40 kDa was added to the medium in the apical compartment at a concentration of 2 mg/ml. After a 2-h incubation at each time point, a 100-μl aliquot of the medium was collected from the basal compartment and the paracellular tracer flux was measured as the amount of FITC-dextran in the medium with a fluorometer (Pt). The paracellular tracer flux at time 0 was measured without a Ca2+ switch in the low Ca2+ medium (P0). “Permeability” was determined as the Pt/P0 ratio. Cell Aggregation Assay—Cells were plated on Transwell filters 24 mm in diameter (Corning) and grown overnight in the low Ca2+ medium. When incubated with Hepes-buffered saline (25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.2, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mm Na2HPO4, and 6 mm dextrose) containing 5 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 30 min, most of the cells had detached from the filter as single cells. They then were centrifuged and resuspended in L-15 medium (normal Ca2+ concentration) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at a density of 1.5×106 cells/ml. Aliquots (0.5 ml) of this suspension were placed in 12-well non-tissue culture plates (FALCON). After 15-, 45-, 90-, or 180-min shaking on a gyratory shaker at 80 rpm to allow cell aggregation, the aggregates were enumerated with a hemocytometer. The extent of cell aggregation was represented by the index Nt/N0, where Nt and N0 are the total numbers of aggregates and cells per dish, respectively. Immunoblotting and Quantitative Analysis of the ZO-1/ZO-2 Expression Levels—The SacII fragment of ZO-1 cDNA (7–143 amino acids) and the EcoRV fragment of ZO-2 cDNA (385–577 amino acids) were sub-cloned into the pGEX4T-1 and pGEX 4T-2 expression vectors, respectively. GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) as previously described (28Furuse M. Itoh M. Hirase T. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). The concentration of the GST fusion protein in each eluate was determined with a protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad) using bovine γ-globulin as a standard. An appropriate amount of whole cell lysate and various amounts of GST-fused ZO-1 or ZO-2 were separated by SDS-PAGE on the same gel and immunoblotted with anti-ZO-1 mAb or anti-ZO-2 pAb, respectively, as described previously (28Furuse M. Itoh M. Hirase T. Nagafuchi A. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). We then compared the intensity of immunoblotted bands of ZO-1 or ZO-2 in cell lysates with that of GST fusion proteins using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 histograms. Homozygous Disruption of the ZO-1 Gene in Cultured Eph4 Epithelial Cells—To explore the function of ZO-1 in epithelial cells, we attempted to homozygously disrupt the ZO-1 gene in cultured epithelial cells. In an attempt to share the same targeting vectors for the gene knock-out analyses between the cultured cell and whole body levels in mice, we searched for appropriate “mouse” epithelial cell lines for gene targeting. Based on the stability of the well polarized epithelial morphology as well as the growth rate, we eventually chose the Eph4 cell line originally established from mouse mammary glands (36Reichmann E. Ball R. Groner B. Friis R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1127-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The genomic structure of the mouse ZO-1 gene was partially clarified as shown in Fig. 1A. Putative exons 2–4 encoded most of the PDZ1 domain. Two targeting vectors were constructed with the expectation that homologous recombination between the vectors and the ZO-1 gene would result in a deletion of almost all (125 bp) of exon 3 (Fig. 1A). In the first targeting and screening, the wild-type ZO-1 allele displayed a 21-kb band on Southern blotting of EcoRI-digested DNA with the 3′ probe, whereas the disrupted locus showed an 8.6-kb band (Fig. 1B). Of the 96 G418-resistant clones examined, 5 independent clones had undergone a single homologous recombination event. Two of these five clones (Fig. 1B, clones A and B) then were expanded and subjected to the second targeting. When the wild-type allele was targeted by the second vector, Southern blotting of EcoRI-digested DNA with the 3′ probe was expected to generate a 9.0-kb band (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, 1 of 68 hygromycin-resistant clones derived from clone A (clone 13) and two of 97 hygromycin-resistant clones derived from clone B (clone 18 and 39) lacked the wild-type 21-kb band and instead showed ∼9-kb thick bands in which the 8.6- and 9.0-kb bands might not be resolved. Correct targeting in clones A/B/13/18/39 was confirmed by Southern blotting with a 5′ probe, and targeted clones were also checked for single integration by hybridization with a β-galactosidase or hygromycin resistance gene probe (data not shown). We next confirmed the loss of ZO-1 expression in clones 13, 18, and 39 at the protein level. We performed immunoblotting analyses using an anti-ZO-1 mAb that recognizes both the α(+) and α(-) isotypes of ZO-1. As shown in Fig. 1C, both isotypes were detected in the wild-type as well as two ZO-1+/- clones (clones A and B), but in clones 13, 18, and 39, no trace of either ZO-1 isotype was detectable, even when their cell lysates were overloaded. Furthermore, we introduced cDNA encoding the α(-) isotype of ZO-1 or HA-tagged ZO-2 into clones 13, 18, and 39 and obtained stable transfectants. Their expression was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 1C). Because clones 13, 18, and 39 showed the same phenotype as far as was examined, the data obtained from clone 18 (and the clone 18 transfectant expressing exogenous ZO-1 and HA-ZO-2) are mostly represented below. Morphology, Growth, and Motility of ZO-1-deficient Eph4 Cells—We cultured ZO-1-deficient Eph4 cells (ZO-1-/- cells; clone 18) on a coverslip under confluent conditions. Phase-contrast microscopy revealed that these cells appeared to completely retain the epithelial morphology. They showed a typical cobble stonelike appearance (Fig. 2, a and a′). No significant difference was discerned between wild-type (ZO-1+/+) and ZO-1-/- Eph4 cells in the size of individual cells and the appearance of the cell-cell contacts. Also at the ultrathin-section electron microscopic level, ZO-1-/- cells were indistinguishable from ZO-1+/+ cells. They appeared to be well polarized with apical membranes bearing characteristic short microvilli (Fig. 2, b and b′). In good agreement, preliminary observations indicated that immunofluorescence staining patterns with “apical” markers did not appear to change between ZO-1+/+ and ZO-1-/- cells (data not shown). The appearance of the junctional complex did not appear to be altered by the deficiency of ZO-1, although it was difficult to clearly distinguish TJs from AJs both in ZO-1+/+ and in ZO-1-/- cells using ultrathin sectional images (Fig. 2, c and c′). We then compared the morphology of TJs of ZO-1-/- cells and ZO-1+/+ cells by freeze-fracture replica electron microscopy. As shown in Fig. 2d, the TJs of ZO-1+/+ cells were characterized by a well developed network of “P-face-associated” intramembranous particle strands and the lack of ZO-1 did not alter these characteristics (Fig. 2, d and d′). We next compared the growth rate and motility of ZO-1-/- cells with those of ZO-1+/+ cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, simple cell counting revealed that ZO-1-/- cells had the same growth curve as ZO-1+/+ cells. Furthermore, the wound-healing assay with the confluent cultures showed that ZO-1-/- cells moved toward the wounded region as quickly as ZO-1+/+ cells (Fig. 3B). Molecular Assembly of TJs in ZO-1-deficient Eph4 Cells—In confluent cultures, ZO-1-/- cells were well polarized and formed the TJs of normal appearance. We then examined the molecular assembly of TJs in these cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. As controls, we used ZO-1+/+ and ZO-1-/- cells (clone 18) exogenously expressing the α(-) isotype of ZO-1 (ZO-1-/-/+ cells). First, cells were cultured on Transwell filters under highly confluent conditions (2–3 × 105 cells/cm2) and immunofluorescently stained with antibodies specific for the components of the plaque structures of TJs (Fig. 4A). Of course, ZO-1 was undetectable at TJs of ZO-1-/- cells and the concentration of ZO-1 at TJs in ZO-1-/-/+ cells appeared to be comparable with that in ZO-1+/+ cells. Interestingly, the ZO-2 signal was significantly increased at TJs in ZO-1-/- cells as compared with ZO-1+/+ cells and this increase of the ZO-2 signal at TJs was suppressed to the ZO-1+/+ cell level by exogenous expression of ZO-1. ZO-3 was undetectable in parental ZO-1+/+ cells by immunofluorescence microscopy, which was consistent with our previous study (37Inoko A. Itoh M. Tamura A. Matsuda M. Furuse M. Tsukita S. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 837-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). ZO-3 did not become detectable in ZO-1-/- cells. Among non-MAGUK components of the TJ plaque structure, cingulin was clearly affected in its distribution in ZO-1-/- cells. Cingulin became undetectable from TJs in ZO-1-/- cells but was clearly recovered at TJs in ZO-1-/-/+ cells. In ZO-1-/- cells, no significant changes were observed in the subcellular distribution of other TJ plaque components such as"

The results have given us new information regarding HS biosynthesis with implications on the role of HS in embryonic development.

Lindahl U. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 2Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). These processes include physiological as well as pathological situations where HS acts in morphogen binding, enzyme activation, or cellular signaling, all of which are essential for the development and maintenance of an organism (3Selleck S.B. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 4Park P.W. Reizes O. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29923-29926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). HS is characterized by a long linear backbone structure consisting of alternating glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine residues. During biosynthesis, this backbone is modified by N-deacetylation/N-sulfation of the glucosamine unit, C5-epimerization of the glucuronic acid residue to iduronic acid, and O-sulfation of both monosaccharide units. Not all of the sites are modified, and a large number of different sequences are produced that provide tailored binding sites for different proteins (2Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar). Glucosaminyl N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (NDST) is the first enzyme engaged in the modification of the sugar backbone and is believed to create substrates for further enzymatic activity along the polymer (1Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). NDST removes the acetyl group from the glucosamine residue and replaces it with a sulfate group. By action of this enzyme, a domain structure is imprinted on the chain with stretches of N-sulfated disaccharides (NS domains) interrupted by stretches of N-acetylated disaccharides (NA domains). At the border of these two domain types, short alternative N-sulfated/N-acetylated areas are found (NA/NS domains) (5Kreuger J. Matsumoto T. Vanwildemeersch M. Sasaki T. Timpl R. Claesson-Welsh L.

Four isoforms of NDST have been identified in mammalian organisms with NDST-1 and NDST-2 being the most widely expressed (7Grobe K. Ledin J. Ringvall M. Holmborn K. Forsberg E. Esko J.D. Kjellen L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The roles of the different isoforms in HS/heparin biosynthesis are only partly known. The drastically different effects of targeted mutations in NDST-1 and NDST-2 suggest critical differences (8Forsberg E. Pejler G. Ringvall M. Lunderius C. Tomasini-Johansson B. Kusche-Gullberg M.

Stretches of N-sulfated disaccharides in NS domains are the substrates for the next enzyme in the biosynthetic cascade, the glucuronyl C5-epimerase (Epi), an enzyme that is encoded by a single gene. Epimerization provides the substrate for the 2-O-sulfotransferase. In addition, uronic acid residues give more flexibility to the chain, which may favor protein binding (12Casu B. Petitou M.

Yet very little is known regarding the quantity and quality of HS found in different organs of a single animal or how changes in the biosynthetic machinery affect different tissues. The increasing number of genetically modified mice produced with defects in HS biosynthesis and structure (28Forsberg E. Kjellén L. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) has increased the demand for sensitive and high throughput methods for HS-structural analyses. To study the impact of HS-structural changes on the phenotype of genetically altered organisms, we have developed suitable methods to characterize HS from different tissues. We analyzed HS from minute tissue samples of wild type animals and animals deficient in either the biosynthesis enzymes (NDST-1, NDST-2, and Epi) or a core protein (Sdc-1). To our surprise, we found an astonishing stability of tissue-specific HS production in control as well as in mutant mice. Materials—NDST-1 (10Ringvall M. Ledin J. Holmborn K. van Kuppevelt T.H.

Age-matched wild type (NDST and Sdc) or heterozygous (Epi) animals were used as control. Swine kidney was bought from the local slaughterhouse and kept frozen until use. HS isolated from bovine organs was obtained from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan) (24Maccarana M. Sakura Y. Tawada A. Yoshida K. Lindahl U. J. Biol.

HS from swine intestine was a gift from D. van Dedem (Diosynth, Oss, The Netherlands) and radiolabeled by 3H-acetylation as described previously (29Spillmann D. Witt D. Lindahl U. J. Biol.

N-Sulfated K5 and N-/6-O-sulfated K5 and synthetic glucuronic acid (Glc)A2S-GlcN and GlcA3S-GlcN were received from B. Casu (32Razi N. Kreuger J. Lay L. Russo G. Panza L. Lindahl B. Lindahl U. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 807-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Chondroitinase ABC was obtained from Seikagaku Corp., and heparitinases (heparin lyase) I, II, and III were from IBEX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Montreal, Canada). Benzonase was obtained from Merck, and Pronase was from Roche Applied Science. ΔHS and chondroitin sulfate (ΔCS) disaccharide standards were from Calbiochem. Bio-Gel P-2 (fine) column was from Bio-Rad. Sephadex G-10, G-15, and DEAE-Sephacel gels were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. A Partisil-10 SAX anion-exchange column (4.6 × 250 mm) was purchased from Whatman Ltd. (Maidstone, Kent, United Kingdom). A Luna 5u C18 (2Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar) reversed phase column (4.6 × 150) was purchased from Phenomenex. Columns (10-ml) were purchased from Bio-Rad. NaB3H4 (50-60 Ci/mmol) and [3H]acetic anhydride (500 mCi/mmol) were obtained from Amersham International. All of the other reagents were of best grade available. Large Scale Isolation of Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)—Five grams of swine kidney powder were homogenized in cold acetone and left for 24 h. The solvent was removed by filtration over Whatman No. 3MM paper, and the pellet was suspended in a minimal volume of water. Methanol and chloroform were added while stirring to a final ratio of 3:8:4 (H2O:CH3OH:CHCl3 v/v) and left overnight at room temperature. The solvent mixture was removed by filtration as above, and the filtrate was washed twice with ethanol and dried at room temperature. The defatted tissue powder was suspended in Pronase digestion buffer (0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm CaCl2, 3% ethanol) to a concentration of 100 mg/ml, and Pronase was added (5 mg/g tissue). After incubation for 24 h at 55 °C, another aliquot of Pronase was added and the incubation continued for 24 h. The incubation was terminated by heating the sample for 15 min at 96 °C, and the suspension was centrifuged for 15 min at 2000 × g. Before adding benzonase (125 units), the supernatant was adjusted to a final 2 mm MgCl2. After the addition of the enzyme, the sample was incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged as above and loaded onto a column of 5 ml of DEAE-Sephacel equilibrated in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl. The column was washed with one column volume of equilibration buffer and three volumes of 50 mm NaAc, pH 4.5, 0.2 m NaCl before a gradient of NaCl from 0.2 to 2 m was applied in the same buffer (a 15 volume total). Fractions were collected and tested for uronic acid content, and the positive fractions were pooled, dialyzed against H2O, and dried. Purification of HS from GAGs—Purified GAGs (100 μg of uronic acid) were incubated in 100 μl of 40 mm Tris-Ac, pH 8.0, containing 100 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC overnight at 37 °C. The digest was loaded onto a 2-ml DEAE-Sephacel column equilibrated in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl. The column was successively washed with five column volumes of equilibration buffer, five volumes of wash buffer (50 mm NaAc, pH 4, 0.1 m NaCl), and two volumes of 0.2 m NH4HCO3 before elution with five volumes of 2 m NH4HCO3. Miniscale Isolation of GAGs from Tissues and Cells—Mouse tissues were isolated and dried by lyophilization. Dry tissue (≤50 mg) was dissolved in 0.5 ml of Pronase buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 1 mm CaCl2, 1% Triton X-100) containing 0.8 mg/ml Pronase and incubated for 24hat55 °C with end-over-end mixing. A second aliquot of Pronase was added after 20 h. After heat inactivation of the Pronase, the buffer was adjusted to 2 mm MgCl2 and benzonase (12 milliunits) was added. The sample was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, heat inactivated, adjusted to a final sodium chloride concentration of 0.1 m, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min. For purification of GAGs from tissue digests, 0.3-ml columns of DEAE were prepared in Bio-Rad 10-ml columns. The columns were primed by washing with one column volume of elution buffer (2 m NH4HCO3) and three column volumes of loading buffer, pH 8 (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100). The supernatants of the tissue extracts were applied, and the columns were washed successively with six volumes of loading buffer, six volumes of wash buffer, pH 4 (50 mm NaAc, pH 4, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100), one volume of H2O, and five volumes of 0.2 m NH4HCO3. The elution of GAGs was achieved with six volumes of 2 m NH4HCO3. The eluate was collected in an Eppendorf tube and repetitively dried by a SpeedVac until the pH reached ∼7. For the isolation of HS, the GAG pool was digested with 50 milliunits of chondroitinase ABC in a final volume of 50 μl of 40 mm Tris-Ac buffer, pH 8.0. The CS digestion was allowed to proceed for ≥3 h at 37 °C. To stop the reaction, 50 μlofH2O was added and boiled. From the CS digest, 10 μl was removed for analysis of the CS content by reversed-phase ion pairing-high performance liquid chromatography (RPIP-HPLC) (see below). The remainder of the chondroitinase-digested GAGs (i.e. HS) was cleaned on a new DEAE-column performed in the same way as described for the GAG isolation. Under these conditions of elution, a quantitative recovery of all types of HS was achieved. After freeze-drying, the purified HS was dissolved in 100 μl of H2O and the pH was checked. Two equal aliquots were dried and prepared for heparitinase digestion. One of the aliquots was treated with 0.4 milliunits each of heparitinases I, II, and III in 15 μl of heparitinase buffer (5 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.7 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. The other aliquot was incubated under the same conditions without enzymes. The reaction was stopped by heat inactivation. All of the samples were dried and resuspended in 45 μl of H2O for injection on the HPLC. Production of Disaccharide Standards by Deamination—Reducing disaccharide standards were produced by deaminative cleavage of native and modified heparin and K5-polysaccharides. Heparin, 2-O-desulfated heparin (33Jaseja M. Rej R.N. Sauriol F. Perlin A.S. Can. J. Chem. 1989; 67: 1449-1457Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar), 6-O-desulfated heparin (34Kariya Y. Kyogashima M.

Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). After neutralization, an aliquot of each preparation was radiolabeled by reduction with NaB3H4 and separated by gel chromatography on a column (1 × 190 cm) of Sephadex G-15 in 0.2 m NH4HCO3. The radiolabeled disaccharides were pooled and analyzed as described below. The other aliquot was neutralized and fractionated on a Sephadex G-15 column in the presence of radiolabeled marker disaccharide and pooled. The synthetic standard disaccharides GlcA2S-GlcN and GlcA3S-GlcN were deaminated at pH 3.9 (32Razi N. Kreuger J. Lay L. Russo G. Panza L. Lindahl B. Lindahl U. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 807-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), neutralized, and desalted on a desalting column (1 × 6 cm) of Sephadex G-10 in 0.2 m NH4HCO3 before analysis by reversed-phase ion-pairing chromatography. Production of Oligosaccharides from GAGs and HS—GAGs and HS isolated from swine kidney were cleaved by deamination at pH 1.5 into disaccharides, tetrasaccharides, and larger oligosaccharides according to standard procedures (38Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) and subfractionated on Sephadex G-15 as described above. Individual pools were analyzed by RPIP-HPLC as described below. Deamination of HS Chains and Tissue Samples—For fingerprinting different tissue and cell GAGs, purified GAG or HS (0.5–10 μg) was dried down in Eppendorf tubes. 10 μl of freshly prepared deamination reagent (50 mm NaNO2 in H2O adjusted to pH 1.5) was added to the samples. Samples were incubated for 10 min at room temperature and evaporated. The dry cleavage products were redissolved in 100 μl of H2O and analyzed directly by RPIP-HPLC without further purification. As control, the non-cleaved sample was mixed with the reagent salts of an aliquot of evaporated deamination reagent dissolved in 100 μl of H2O. Under the conditions chosen, quantitative cleavage of HS chains at available N-sulfated glucosamine residues was achieved in a window up to 5 μg of starting HS (data not shown). Analysis of GAGs—GAGs were quantified by colorimetric determination of hexuronic acid using the meta-hydroxy-diphenyl method (39Blumenkrantz N. Asboe-Hansen G. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 54: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (5885) Google Scholar) with GlcA as a standard. A factor of 3 was arbitrarily employed to convert values to saccharide mass. Reducing disaccharides were quantified by the methylbenzothiazolinone hydrazone hydrochloride assay using GlcN as a standard (40Riesenfeld J. Roden L. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 188: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The analysis of the 3H-labeled anhydromannitol disaccharide species was performed by strong anion exchange (SAX-HPLC) on a Partisil-10 SAX column (41Bienkowski M.J. Conrad H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 356-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with on-line monitoring of the radioactivity by a flow detector (Radiomatic 500 TR, Packard, CT). The analysis of reducing disaccharides after either enzymatic or deaminative cleavage was performed by RPIP-HPLC in acetonitrile (8.5%) tetra-N-butylammonium hydrogen sulfate (1.2 mm) by applying a gradient of NaCl (0–8 mm in 10 min, 8–30 mm in 1 min, 30–56 mm in 11.5 min, 56–106 mm in 1.5 min, and 106 mm for 6 min) followed by a column wash with 120 mm NaCl for 1 min essentially as described by Staatz et al. (42Staatz W.D. Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Chhor K. Selleck S.B. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 171: 41-52PubMed Google Scholar). A flow rate of 1.1 ml/min was kept, and post-column detection was performed by the addition of 2-cyanoacetamide (0.25%) in NaOH (0.5%) at a flow rate of 0.35 ml/min as described previously (42Staatz W.D. Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Chhor K. Selleck S.B. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 171: 41-52PubMed Google Scholar). Signals were quantified against known amounts of standard disaccharides analyzed in parallel runs. Heparan Sulfate Content and Structure Is Distinct in Different Mouse Tissues—GAGs were purified from mouse tissues by a miniscale protocol adapted for handling a larger number of samples with identical results as by the use of traditional isolation methods (data not shown). The samples were analyzed with a method modified from a protocol originally used for structural analysis of GAGs from Drosophila tissues (43Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Selleck S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2269-2275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In this method, isolated HS is cleaved with heparitinases I-III to generate disaccharides containing a 4,5-unsaturated hexuronic acid (ΔHexA) at the non-reducing end (see Fig. 1) that are analyzed by RPIP-HPLC. Also CS can be studied by analyzing the chondroitinase digest. As little as 5 mg of dry weight of any HS-producing mouse tissue give enough material for the analysis of quantitative and qualitative aspects of HS composition. The amounts of HS present in different tissues of an adult mouse (C57BL strain) varied considerably, i.e. kidney and lungs with 600–800 ng of HS disaccharides/mg of dry tissue being the most HS-rich tissues, whereas skeletal muscle, liver, skin, or brain contained <150 ng/mg dry weight (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Recovery of HS from different murine tissues. Quantification of HS disaccharides recovered from different tissues of an adult female mouse. Tissues were isolated and extracted as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and ΔHS disaccharides were quantified after HPLC runs and expressed per dry weight of the tissues.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The HS disaccharide composition (Fig. 3A) as well as the overall degree of N- and O-sulfation (Fig. 3B) was characteristic for each individual tissue. The most remarkable pattern relative to a more “average” HS composition was seen in lung tissue with an extremely high overall 2-O-sulfation level due to the presence of monosulfated ΔHexA2S-GlcNAc species (Fig. 3A). HS from spleen, kidney, and liver on the other hand was relatively rich in 6-O-sulfate groups. In contrast to all of the other tissues examined, skin samples from different mice contained HS with a somewhat variable structure. HS Fingerprints Are Tissue-specific—By enzymatic digestion of HS followed by disaccharide compositional analysis (Fig. 1A), only part of the information concerning the HS structure was obtained. The epimerization state of the different disaccharide species as well as the domain arrangement of the chain cannot be analyzed by this me"
https://openalex.org/W2005177957,"Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease are the two entities of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). One of the main pathogenic mechanisms is probably a dysregulated immune response triggered by products of the enteric bacterial flora. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor SB203580 on inflammatory responses using the DSS-induced experimental colitis model in mice reflecting human IBD. We found that SB203580 improved the clinical score, ameliorates the histological alterations, and reduces the mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines. In addition to p38 kinase activity, the ""classical"" and the ""alternative"" NF-kappaB pathways were also strongly activated during colitis induction. All three pathways were drastically down-regulated by SB203580 treatment. An analysis of the molecular basis of NF-kappaB activation revealed that Rip-like interacting caspase-like apoptosis-regulatory protein kinase (RICK), a key component of a pathway leading to NF-kappaB induction, is also strongly inhibited by SB203580. Since RICK is an effector kinase of NOD2, an intracellular receptor of bacterial peptidoglycan, these results support the notion that NOD signaling could play a pivotal role in the IBD pathogenesis. Thus, RICK could represent a novel target for future therapies in human IBD."
https://openalex.org/W1966869152,"Pardaxins are a class of ichthyotoxic peptides isolated from fish mucous glands. Pardaxins physically interact with cell membranes by forming pores or voltage-gated ion channels that disrupt cellular functions. Here we report the high-resolution structure of synthetic pardaxin Pa4 in sodium dodecylphosphocholine micelles, as determined by <sup>1</sup>H solution NMR spectroscopy. The peptide adopts a bend-helix-bend-helix motif with an angle between the two structure helices of 122 ± 9°, making this structure substantially different from the one previously determined in organic solvents. In addition, paramagnetic solution NMR experiments on Pa4 in micelles reveal that except for the C terminus, the peptide is not solvent-exposed. These results are complemented by solid-state NMR experiments on Pa4 in lipid bilayers. In particular, <sup>13</sup>C-<sup>15</sup>N rotational echo double-resonance experiments in multilamellar vesicles support the helical conformation of the C-terminal segment, whereas <sup>2</sup>H NMR experiments show that the peptide induces considerable disorder in both the head-groups and the hydrophobic core of the bilayers. These solid-state NMR studies indicate that the C-terminal helix has a transmembrane orientation in DMPC bilayers, whereas in POPC bilayers, this domain is heterogeneously oriented on the lipid surface and undergoes slow motion on the NMR time scale. These new data help explain how the non-covalent interactions of Pa4 with lipid membranes induce a stable secondary structure and provide an atomic view of the membrane insertion process of Pa4."
https://openalex.org/W2126399632,"Oxidative stress plays a major role in hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury. We have shown previously that mice lacking the Nrf2 are more susceptible to hyperoxia than are wild-type mice. Nrf2 activates antioxidant response element (ARE)-mediated gene expression involved in cellular protection against toxic insults. The present study was designed to investigate the mechanisms that control the activation of Nrf2 by hyperoxia using a non-malignant murine alveolar epithelial cell line, C10. No significant alteration in the levels of Nrf2 mRNA and protein was found following exposure to hyperoxia. In contrast, hyperoxia caused the translocation of Nrf2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus within 30–60 min of exposure. Consistent with these observations, gel shift and reporter analyses demonstrated a correlation between the hyperoxia-enhanced ARE DNA-binding activity of Nrf2 and an up-regulation of ARE-driven transcription. Inhibition of NADPH oxidase with diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) blocked both Nrf2 translocation and ARE-mediated transcription. Inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway caused a similar effect. Consistent with this finding, hyperoxia stimulated ERK-1 and ERK-2 phosphorylation, whereas DPI or N-acetyl-l-cysteine blocked such activation. Hyperoxia stimulated the phosphorylation of endogenous Nrf2, but not in the presence of U0126, suggesting a critical role for ERK signaling in the activation of Nrf2. Consistent with this notion, hyperoxia did not stimulate the phosphorylation of Nrf2 in fibroblasts lacking the ERK-1. Collectively, our findings suggest that hyperoxia-induced, ARE-driven, Nrf2-dependent transcription is controlled by NADPH oxidase and ERK-1 signaling.

Signal. 2002; 4: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown a protective role for phase II detoxifying enzymes such as glutathione reductase, thioredoxin, NQO1, and glutathione transferase against oxidative processes (12O'Brien P.J. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1991; 80: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar, 13Fahey J.W. Talalay P. Food Chem. Toxicol. 1999; 37: 973-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). These enzymes detoxify reactive electrophilic metabolites, which include organic peroxides, lipid peroxides, epoxides, and quinones, and facilitate their excretion through conjugation reaction or two-electron reduction (14Ishii T. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 348: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 15Chinenov Y. Kerppola T.K.

Collectively, these results strongly indicate that expression and regulation of both classic and non-classic AOEs and of detoxifying enzymes by oxidative stress play a critical role in pulmonary defense mechanisms. Many of the genes coding for AOEs and phase II defense enzymes contain an antioxidant response element (ARE) in their enhancers. NF-E2-related transcription factor 2 (Nrf2) has been identified as a key transcriptional activator of these genes through the ARE. It binds to ARE by forming a heterodimer with other transcription factors, such as Maf (26Nguyen T. Sherratt P.J. Pickett C.B. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 233-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). Nrf2 is a member of the Cap'n'Collar family of basic regionleucine zipper transcription factors and expressed abundantly in liver, intestine, lung, and kidney, where detoxification reactions occur routinely (17Chan K. Lu R. Chang J.C. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13943-13948Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 18Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3169) Google Scholar). Nrf2 also modulates gene expression regulated by keratinocyte growth factor, which plays an important role in lung epithelial repair and cell stretching (19Braun S. Hanselmann C. Gassmann M.G. auf dem Keller U. Born-Berclaz C. Chan K. Kan Y.W. Werner S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5492-5505Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). We recently showed that Nrf2 plays a key role in protection against hyperoxia-induced lung injury in vivo (20Cho H.-Y. Jedlicka A.E. Reddy S.P.M. Kensler T.W. Yamamoto M. Zhang L.-Y. Kleeberger S.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 21Cho H.Y. Jedlicka A.E. Reddy S.P. Zhang L.Y. Kensler T.W. Kleeberger S.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In contrast to wild-type, the Nrf2-deficient mice are more susceptible to inflammatory and hyper-permeability responses induced by hyperoxia (20Cho H.-Y. Jedlicka A.E. Reddy S.P.M. Kensler T.W. Yamamoto M. Zhang L.-Y. Kleeberger S.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, studies from other laboratories have shown an important role for Nrf2 in the regulation of AOE expression in response to various oxidative and cytotoxic insults in many cells and tissues (14Ishii T. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 348: 182-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 18Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16023-16029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). Several studies have also shown that in response to external stimuli Nrf2 translocates into the nucleus and up-regulates AOEs (26Nguyen T. Sherratt P.J. Pickett C.B. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 233-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). Although we have previously shown that Nrf2 plays a critical role in hyperoxia-induced lung injury (20Cho H.-Y. Jedlicka A.E. Reddy S.P.M. Kensler T.W. Yamamoto M. Zhang L.-Y. Kleeberger S.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 21Cho H.Y. Jedlicka A.E. Reddy S.P. Zhang L.Y. Kensler T.W. Kleeberger S.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), the mechanisms contributing to this process are unclear. To delineate the molecular basis of Nrf2-mediated protection against hyperoxia-induced toxicity in the lung, we investigated the mechanisms controlling Nrf2 activation and subsequent ARE-mediated gene transcription in response to hyperoxia in an alveolar epithelial cell culture system. Our results indicate that ROS-induced ERK MAPK signaling plays a critical role in regulating ARE-mediated, hyperoxia-induced gene expression in pulmonary epithelial cells. Cell Culture—C10, a non-malignant murine alveolar type II-like epithelial cell line (27Malkinson A.M. Dwyer-Nield L.D. Rice P.L. Dinsdale D. Toxicology. 1997; 123: 53-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), was grown in MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. A549, a tumorigenic human alveolar type II-like epithelial cell line, was grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Isogenic mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking ERK-1 (ERK-1-/-) and wild-type (ERK-1+/+) were cultured as previously described (28Zhang J. Yang J. Roy S.K. Tininini S. Hu J. Bromberg J.F. Poli V. Stark G.R. Kalvakolanu D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9342-9347Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Exposure to Hyperoxia—Culture medium was changed 1 h prior to hyperoxia (95% oxygen) exposure. C10 cells were exposed to hyperoxia in a tightly sealed chamber (model PROOX-RS232) configured to operate with E702 sensors (Reming Bioinstruments Co., Redfield, NY), which monitor the constant flow of oxygen. As a control, cells were exposed to room air. Cell Viability Assays—Cell viability was analyzed with the CellTiter-Glo™ Luminescent Cell Viability Assay kit using the protocol recommended by the manufacturer (Promega). In brief, cells cultured in a 48-well plate were treated with or without Me2SO or pharmacological inhibitors for 40 min and then exposed to hyperoxia or air. After exposure, cells were then incubated with 100 μl of CellTiter-Glo reagent, and generation of a luminescent signal was recorded by using a luminometer. The luminescent signal is proportional to the amount of ATP present, which signals the presence of metabolically active cells. Cell number correlation and ATP standard curves were generated with luminescent output as per the instructions of the product (data not shown). Generation of Nrf2-overexpressing Stable C10 Cell Line—To generate stable transfectants, C10 cells were transfected with either parental vector (pCI-Neo) or pCI-vector containing the wild-type mouse Nrf2 cDNA (pCI-Nrf2). Stable transfectants were selected after culturing cells in medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Several independent colonies stably expressing the Nrf2 were selected and pooled, and Nrf2 expression was analyzed by Western blot analysis. Immunocytochemistry—C10 cells were grown to 80% confluence in Lab-Tek II chamber slides (Nalgene) and exposed to room air or hyperoxia for 1 h. After fixation in cold methanol for 10 min at room temperature, cells were washed three times with cold PBS to remove methanol and then permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. They were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h and then incubated with primary anti-Nrf2 antibody (SC-13032, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin for 18–20 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody (SC-2365, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h, washed, and mounted using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (H-1500, Vector Laboratories). Subcellular localization of Nrf2 was observed using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE2000-S) fitted with a digital camera. The fluorescent images were captured using appropriate filters. For inhibitor studies, cells were treated with pharmacological inhibitor or vehicle for 1 h before exposure. Gene Expression and Immunoblot Analyses—For Northern blot analyses, total RNA (15 μg/lane) isolated from cells was separated on a 1.2% formaldehyde agarose gel and blotted onto a nylon membrane. Membranes were sequentially hybridized with 32P-labeled Nrf2 and β-actin cDNA probes. For Western blot analyses, total protein was extracted in a kinase lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, with150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, and 10 μg/ml protease inhibitor complex (Sigma) containing 10 μm proteasome inhibitor MG-132). A comparable quantity of total or nuclear (see below) protein from each sample was separated on 4–12% gradient PAGE Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Membranes were probed with anti-Nrf2 (SC-13032), anti-Erk-2 (SC-154), and anti-p-ERK (SC-7383) antibodies (all obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and developed using ECL-Plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—Cells were exposed to hyperoxia and washed with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 1% Nonidet P-40; 0.25% sodium deoxycholate; 150 mm NaCl; 1 mm EDTA; 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; and protease inhibitor mixture (10 μl/ml, Sigma)). Total cell lysate (500 μg) was pre-cleared with 20 μl of Protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 20 min and centrifuged (1000 × g for 2 min). Supernatant was incubated with Nrf2 antibody (2 μg) for 4 h at 4 °C, and the immune complexes were precipitated with Protein A-agarose beads overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were then washed twice with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer before separating the proteins on a SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblotting with anti-phosphoserine antibody (BD Biosciences). Transfections and Reporter Gene Analyses—Transient transfections were performed as described previously (29Adiseshaiah P. Papaiahgari S.R. Vuong H. Kalvakolanu D.V. Reddy S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47423-47433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were transfected with 100 ng of HO-1-ARE-Luc or the human NQO1 (hNQO1, NADPH:quinone oxidase reductase-1)-ARE-Luc reporter, together with 1 ng of Renilla luciferase plasmid, pRL-TK (Promega). HO-1-ARE-Luc (kindly provided by Jawed Alam, Ochsner Clinic Foundation, New Orleans, LA) contains three copies of ARE (5′-CGGACCTTGACTCAGCAGAAAA-3′) cloned upstream of the mouse HO-1 minimal (-35 to +72 bp) promoter. The hNQO1-ARE-Luc contains a single copy of ARE, derived from the human NQO1 promoter, placed upstream of a minimal promoter containing a TATA box fused to the luciferase gene (30Moehlenkamp J.D. Johnson J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 363: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Jeffrey Johnson, University of Wisconsin). Cell extracts were assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activities using a dual luciferase kit (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to that of Renilla luciferase. All transfections were performed in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least twice. Data are presented as the mean luciferase activity ± S.E. (n = 3) of a representative experiment. The statistical significance of the differences between groups was determined using Student's t test, and a p < 0.05 value was considered statistically significant. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear extracts were isolated as described previously (31Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar), except that the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (10 μm) was included in the extraction buffers. EMSA was carried out as described previously (29Adiseshaiah P. Papaiahgari S.R. Vuong H. Kalvakolanu D.V. Reddy S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47423-47433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar): nuclear extracts (2–3 μg) were incubated with a binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 4% glycerol, 0.25 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), and 0.5 μg of salmon sperm DNA) on ice for 20 min before addition of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, samples were resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel containing 2% glycerol. To determine the specificity of complex formation, nuclear extracts were incubated for 10–15 min with a 50-fold molar excess of appropriate unlabeled oligonucleotides. In supershift assays, nuclear extracts were incubated on ice with 2 μg of anti-Nrf2 (sc-13032X), anti-Sp1 (sc-420 X), and anti-Maf F/G/K (sc-16278 X) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h before addition of probe. Hyperoxia Triggers the Nuclear Translocation of Nrf2—Previously, we have shown that Nrf2 provides protection against hyperoxia-induced toxicity in the lungs at least in part through the modulation of Nrf2 expression and functional activity (20Cho H.-Y. Jedlicka A.E. Reddy S.P.M. Kensler T.W. Yamamoto M. Zhang L.-Y. Kleeberger S.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanisms controlling the activation of Nrf2, we initially studied the effects of hyperoxia on Nrf2 expression in A549 and C10 cell lines, which exhibit alveolar epithelial-like characteristics (27Malkinson A.M. Dwyer-Nield L.D. Rice P.L. Dinsdale D. Toxicology. 1997; 123: 53-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Hyperoxia caused no significant change in the level of Nrf2 mRNA or protein expression in either cell type after various times of exposure (data not shown). These results suggest that hyperoxia does not affect the levels of Nrf2 mRNA or protein expression in C10 or A549 cells, and they are consistent with the reported regulation of Nrf2 in a majority of cell types in response to toxic stimuli (16Otterbein L.E. Choi A.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 161-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 26Nguyen T. Sherratt P.J. Pickett C.B. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 233-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). We next examined whether hyperoxia modulates subcellular localization of Nrf2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and up-regulates ARE-mediated transcription. Immunostaining analyses of intact cells exposed to room air or hyperoxia indicated that the Nrf2 antigen was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A, left panels). The intense fluorescent staining of Nrf2 was seen to extend peripherally around the nucleus and into the distal cytoplasm. However, a high proportion of Nrf2 accumulated in the nucleus of both cell types following the exposure of cells to hyperoxia (Fig. 1A, right panels). To further validate these observations, nuclear extracts were obtained from room air- or hyperoxia-exposed C10 and A549 cells, and immunoblot analyses were performed to monitor the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 (Fig. 1B). In addition to a specific signal, a nonspecific (NS) band just below the Nrf2 band was seen with these antibodies, as previously reported (32Stewart D. Killeen E. Naquin R. Alam S. Alam J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2396-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Consistent with our immunostaining data, minimal amounts of Nrf2 were present in the nuclei of cells exposed to room air. However, the nuclear Nrf2 levels increased rapidly (within 30 min) after exposure to hyperoxia, suggesting a rapid nuclear accumulation of this transcription factor in response to hyperoxia. Hyperoxia Enhances the Nrf2 DNA-binding Activity and Downstream Target Gene Transcription—To determine whether the nuclear Nrf2 is capable of binding to DNA, we used an EMSA approach with a 32P-labeled ARE probe (Fig. 2). When incubated with the nuclear extracts from control and hyperoxia-exposed C10 cells, the ARE probe formed two major protein complexes, designated I and II. The formation of these complexes was enhanced in cells exposed to hyperoxic conditions (lane 2, Fig. 2B). In particular, a significant difference was observed at 3 h post-exposure. Similar results were obtained with the nuclear extracts from A549 cells (data not shown). The specificity of formation of these complexes was assessed in competition assays using an excess of unlabeled ARE-oligonucleotide (self) or an oligonucleotide-bearing AP-1 binding site (Fig. 2C). Both of these oligonucleotides inhibited the formation of both complexes. Because ARE also contains an embedded AP-1 site, we asked whether any or all of these complexes were formed by AP-1. To distinguish between these possibilities, we used an ARE probe bearing mutations within the AP-1 site in an EMSA (ARE-AP1mt; Fig. 2A). Mutation of the AP-1 site markedly reduced the formation of complex II without significantly affecting the formation of complex I (Fig. 2D). The weak complex II observed with ARE-AP1mt may be attributed to other flanking sequences present in the ARE. This observation is consistent with a previous report that showed a similar pattern of DNA complex formation with the ARE (18Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3169) Google Scholar, 33Li N. Wang M. Oberley T.D. Sempf J.M. Nel A.E. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4531-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The blockade of the formation of complexes I and II by AP-1 oligonucleotide (5′-CGC TTG ATG ACT CAA ACG GAA-3′; lane 9, Fig. 2C) suggested that protein complexes formed at ARE were composed of AP-1-like transcription factors. To examine the nature of protein binding to ARE, EMSAs were performed using antibodies specific for the Nrf2 and Maf proteins. The addition of either anti-Nrf2 or anti-Maf antibody reduced the formation of complex I in the case of nuclear extracts isolated from cells exposed to hyperoxia, as compared with IgG controls (lanes 1–4, Fig. 3) in contrast, anti-Sp1 antibody had no appreciable effect (lanes 13–16). Incubation of nuclear extracts with specific antibodies recognizing the Jun and Fos families of proteins revealed the presence of Jun-D, Jun-B, and Fra-1 in complex II (data not shown). Collectively, the data presented in Figs. 2 and 3 indicate that hyperoxia induces the binding of Nrf2 to the ARE. To further correlate the Nrf2 DNA binding with gene transcription, we analyzed the effect of hyperoxia on ARE-mediated reporter gene expression by transient transfection assay using the reporter constructs HO-1-ARE-Luc and hNQO1-ARE-Luc (Fig. 4A). Various studies have demonstrated that these reporters contain sufficient information to mediate Nrf2-dependent gene transcription (34Alam J. Wicks C. Stewart D. Gong P. Touchard C. Otterbein S. Choi A.M. Burow M.E. Tou J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27694-27702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 35Zhang Q. Kleeberger S.R. Reddy S.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 286: L427-L436Google Scholar). To determine the kinetics of induction of the reporters, cells were exposed to hyperoxia for 60 or 180 min, and Luc activity was analyzed (Fig. 4B). A 60-min exposure to hyperoxia significantly enhanced (>60%) the luciferase activity, as compared with room air-exposed controls. The reporter gene expression was maximal in cells exposed to hyperoxia for 180 min. More importantly, the ARE-driven promoter activity correlated (Fig. 4B) with the hyperoxia-induced Nrf2 nuclear accumulation (Fig. 1). NADPH Oxidase Mediates Hyperoxia-induced Nrf2-dependent Gene Transcription—ROS generated via NADPH oxidase in response to hyperoxia or other stressful stimuli have been implicated in the activation of various transcription factors, such as NF-κB and AP-1 (36Parks W.C. Shapiro S.D. Respir. Res. 2001; 2: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 37Martindale J.L. Holbrook N.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 192: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar, 38Lee P.J. Choi A.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 35: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To examine the role of ROS in mediating hyperoxia-enhanced ARE-mediated gene transcription, we treated C10 cells with or without the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) before exposure to hyperoxia. We then took three independent approaches, immunolocalization, EMSA, and transient reporter assays, to examine the translocation, DNA binding, and functional activity of Nrf2, respectively. As expected, Nrf2 immunostaining was enhanced in the nuclei of vehicle (Me2SO)-treated cells following hyperoxia (Fig. 5A). However, treatment of cells with DPI markedly diminished both basal and hyperoxia-enhanced Nrf2 accumulation in the nucleus (Fig. 5A). We have also determined the DNA-binding activity of Nrf2 in cells treated with Me2SO or DPI (Fig. 5B). For this purpose, EMSAs were performed with an ARE probe. As shown earlier (Fig. 3), Nrf2 and AP-1 protein complexes were readily detected (Fig. 5B). DPI markedly diminished the formation of Nrf2-based DNA-protein complexes (lanes 3 and 4) and had a modest inhibitory effect on the formation of AP-1 complexes (top band). These results indicate that ROS, generated through the activation of NADPH oxidase, may play a role in mediating ARE-dependent hyperoxia-induced gene transcription. To confirm this notion, we analyzed the effects of DPI on hyperoxia-stimulated ARE reporter g"
https://openalex.org/W1968640233,"Endocannabinoid signaling has been shown to be enhanced in several cancer tissues and malignant cells, and studies in cell lines have shown that this up-regulation might serve the purpose of providing transformed cells with a further means to inhibit their proliferation. Here we investigated the effect of inhibitors of endocannabinoid degradation on the growth of rat thyroid tumor xenografts induced in athymic mice. VDM-11, a selective inhibitor of endocannabinoid cellular re-uptake, and arachidonoyl-serotonin (AA-5-HT), a selective blocker of endocannabinoid enzymatic hydrolysis, both inhibited the growth in vivo of tumor xenografts induced by the subcutaneous injection of rat thyroid transformed (KiMol) cells. This effect was accompanied by significantly enhanced endocannabinoid concentrations in the tumors excised at the end of the in vivo experiments. Endocannabinoids, as well as VDM-11 and AA-5-HT, inhibited the growth in vitro of the transformed rat thyroid cells used to induce the tumors in vivo, and their effect was reversed at least in part by the cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist SR141716A. This compound, however, when administered alone, did not enhance, but instead slightly inhibited, the growth of rat thyroid transformed cells both in vitro and in tumor xenografts induced in vivo. These findings indicate that endocannabinoids tonically control tumor growth in vivo by both CB1-mediated and non-CB1-mediated mechanisms and that, irrespective of the molecular mechanism of their anti-proliferative action, inhibitors of their inactivation might be used for the development of novel anti-cancer drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2114307219,"The amyloid beta protein (Abeta) is derived from beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP). Cleavage of APP by beta-secretase generates a C-terminal fragment (APPCTFbeta or C99), which is subsequently cleaved by gamma-secretase to produce Abeta. BACE (or BACE1), the major beta-secretase involved in cleaving APP, has been identified as a Type 1 membrane-associated aspartyl protease. In this study, we found that treatment with proteasome inhibitors resulted in an increase in APP C99 levels, suggesting that APP processing at the beta-secretase site may be affected by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. To investigate whether the degradation of BACE is mediated by the proteasome pathway, cells stably transfected with BACE were treated with lactacystin. We found that BACE protein degradation was inhibited by lactacystin in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Non-proteasome protease inhibitors had no effect on BACE degradation. BACE protein is ubiquitinated. Furthermore, lactacystin increased APP C99 production and Abeta generation. Our data demonstrate that the degradation of BACE proteins and APP processing are regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2117299292,"Caveolin-1 is a scaffolding/regulatory protein that interacts with diverse signaling molecules in endothelial cells. To explore the role of this protein in receptor-modulated signaling pathways, we transfected bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) with small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes to down-regulate caveolin-1 expression. Transfection of BAEC with duplex siRNA targeted against caveolin-1 mRNA selectively “knocked-down” the expression of caveolin-1 by ∼90%, as demonstrated by immunoblot analyses of BAEC lysates. We used discontinuous sucrose gradients to purify caveolin-containing lipid rafts from siRNA-treated endothelial cells. Despite the near-total down-regulation of caveolin-1 expression, the lipid raft targeting of diverse signaling proteins (including the endothelial isoform of nitric-oxide synthase, Src-family tyrosine kinases, Gαq and the insulin receptor) was unchanged. We explored the consequences of caveolin-1 knockdown on kinase pathways modulated by the agonists sphingosine-1 phosphate (S1P) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). siRNA-mediated caveolin-1 knockdown enhanced basal as well as S1P- and VEGF-induced phosphorylation of the protein kinase Akt and did not modify the basal or agonist-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2. Caveolin-1 knock-down also significantly enhanced the basal and agonist-induced activity of the small GTPase Rac. We used siRNA to down-regulate Rac expression in BAEC, and we observed that Rac knockdown significantly reduced basal, S1P-, and VEGF-induced Akt phosphorylation, suggesting a role for Rac activation in the caveolin siRNA-mediated increase in Akt phosphorylation. By using siRNA to knockdown caveolin-1 and Rac expression in cultured endothelial cells, we have found that caveolin-1 does not seem to be required for the targeting of signaling molecules to caveolae/lipid rafts and that caveolin-1 differentially modulates specific kinase pathways in endothelial cells. Caveolin-1 is a scaffolding/regulatory protein that interacts with diverse signaling molecules in endothelial cells. To explore the role of this protein in receptor-modulated signaling pathways, we transfected bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) with small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes to down-regulate caveolin-1 expression.

We explored the consequences of caveolin-1 knockdown on kinase pathways modulated by the agonists sphingosine-1 phosphate (S1P) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). siRNA-mediated caveolin-1 knockdown enhanced basal as well as S1P- and VEGF-induced phosphorylation of the protein kinase Akt and did not modify the basal or agonist-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2. Caveolin-1 knock-down also significantly enhanced the basal and agonist-induced activity of the small GTPase Rac. We used siRNA to down-regulate Rac expression in BAEC, and we observed that Rac knockdown significantly reduced basal, S1P-, and VEGF-induced Akt phosphorylation, suggesting a role for Rac activation in the caveolin siRNA-mediated increase in Akt phosphorylation. By using siRNA to knockdown caveolin-1 and Rac expression in cultured endothelial cells, we have found that caveolin-1 does not seem to be required for the targeting of signaling molecules to caveolae/lipid rafts and that caveolin-1 differentially modulates specific kinase pathways in endothelial cells. Caveolae are specialized plasmalemmal microdomains that were originally described on the surface of endothelial and epithelial cells (1Palade G.E. J. Appl. Physiol. 1953; 24: 1424-1436Google Scholar, 2Yamada E. J. Biophys. Biochem. Cytol. 1955; 1: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). First described as endocytic structures, caveolae have been identified as sites for the sequestration of diverse membrane-targeted signaling proteins (for review, see Refs. 3van Deurs B.

Biol. 1999; 19: 7289-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Caveolae are characterized by the presence of the scaffolding/regulatory protein caveolin (6Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E.

Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar) and by a distinctive lipid composition notable for high concentrations of cholesterol and sphingolipids; the presence of caveolin distinguishes caveolae from other “lipid raft” domains that have a similar lipid composition but do not necessarily contain caveolin. The three caveolin isoforms in mammalian cells are 22–24-kDa integral membrane proteins; caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 are co-expressed in most cell types and are particularly abundant in endothelial cells, whereas caveolin-3 is an isoform that is specific to muscle cells (6Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar). The most extensively characterized member of this protein family, caveolin-1, has been shown to interact with and modulate the function of many signaling proteins in caveolae, including the epidermal growth factor receptor, the endothelial isoform of nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), 1The abbreviations used are: eNOS, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; PI3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; Cav-1 siRNA, small interfering RNA targeted to the bovine caveolin-1 mRNA; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; BAEC, bovine aortic endothelial cells; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; S1P, sphingosine-1 phosphate; GSK3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; ANOVA, analysis of variance.

On the other hand, caveolin-1 also interacts with acting binding cytoskeletal proteins; these interactions have been proposed to be required for the spatial organization of caveolin-associated membrane domains and caveolae internalization (10Oh P. McIntosh D.P. Schnitzer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 11Stahlhut M. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Much of our understanding about the role of caveolin-1 in cellular signaling derives from overexpression experiments in heterologous systems. However, in cell types in which caveolin-1 is already robustly expressed, the complementary experimental approach of attenuating caveolin-1 expression has proven more challenging. Standard antisense methods have not been broadly applied (12Griffoni C. Spisni E. Santi S. Riccio M. Guarnieri T. Tomasi V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 756-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) because of their intrinsic limitations, particularly in endothelial cells, where caveolin-1 is so abundant. Caveolin-1 knock-out mice have recently been characterized and provide a promising experimental system for exploring the role of caveolae in physiological processes (13Drab M. Verkade P. Elger M. Kasper M. Lohn M. Lauterbach B. Menne J. Lindschau C. Mende F. Luft F.C. Schedl A. Haller H. Kurzchalia T.V. Science. 2001; 293: 2449-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar, 14Razani B.

Cells derived from these mice lack caveolae membranes, and a prominent phenotype is observed in the vascular system of these mice with abnormalities in permeability and contractile functions (13Drab M. Verkade P. Elger M. Kasper M. Lohn M. Lauterbach B. Menne J. Lindschau C. Mende F. Luft F.C. Schedl A. Haller H. Kurzchalia T.V.

However, biochemical analyses in vascular tissues prepared from these mice are hampered by the limited quantities of tissue available for analysis. In particular, the role of caveolin-1 in the regulation of receptor-modulated kinase pathways has been difficult to ascertain, particularly with respect to the differential control of MAP kinase and phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI3) kinase pathways, both of which have regulatory components localized in caveolae (8Shaul P.W. Anderson R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L843-L851PubMed Google Scholar, 17Liu P. Ying Y. Anderson R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13666-13670Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Antisense RNA studies have implied that caveolin-1 has an inhibitory effect on the MAP-kinase cascade in NIH-3T3 cells (18Galbiati F. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The role of caveolin-1 in the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway is more controversial; some reports suggest that overexpression of caveolin-1 down-regulates the PI3-kinase pathway and sensitizes fibroblast and epithelial cells to apoptotic stimuli (19Liu J. Lee P. Galbiati F. Kitsis R.N. Lisanti M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C823-C835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Zundel W. Swiersz L.M. Giaccia A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1507-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), whereas other studies have reported that overexpression of caveolin-1 activates Akt signaling (21Shack S. Wang X.T.

In this article, we describe the results of experiments using transfection of small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes to specifically and efficiently knockdown caveolin-1 expression in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). We explore the effects of siRNA-mediated caveolin-1 knockdown on signaling pathways initiated by the agonists S1P and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and the consequence of caveolin-1 knockdown on the subcellular targeting of key signaling proteins in endothelial cells. Materials—Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Hyclone (Logan, UT). Cell culture reagents, media, and LipofectAMINE 2000 transfection reagent were from Invitrogen. S1P was purchased from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA). VEGF, bradykinin, and wortmannin were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Polyclonal antibodies directed against phospho-eNOS (Ser-1179), phospho-Akt (Ser-473), Akt, phospho-glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) (Ser-9), phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204) and ERK1/2 were from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA).

Super Signal substrate for chemiluminescence detection and secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were from Pierce. Tris-buffered saline and phosphate-buffered saline were from Boston Bioproducts (Ashland, MA). Other reagents were from Sigma. Cell Culture—Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were obtained from Cell Systems (Kirkland, WA) and maintained in culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10% v/v) as described previously (23Michel T. Li G.T. Busconi L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6252-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Cells were plated onto 0.2% gelatin-coated culture dishes and studied before cell confluence between passages 5 and 9. siRNA Preparation and Transfection—Based upon established characteristics of siRNA targeting constructs (24Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8186) Google Scholar, 25Dykxhoorn D.M. Novina C.D. Sharp P.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 457-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar), we designed a caveolin-1 siRNA duplex corresponding to bases 223–241 from the open reading frame of the bovine caveolin-1 mRNA: 5′-CCA GAA GGA ACA CAC AGU U-dTdT-3′, and a Rac siRNA duplex corresponding to bases 78–96 from the open reading frame of the bovine Rac mRNA: 5′-UGC GUU UCC UGG AGA AUA U-dTdT-3′. The RNA sequence used as a negative control for siRNA activity was: 5′-GCG CGC UUU GUA GGA UUC G-dTdT-3′. Small interfering RNA duplex oligonucleotides were purchased from Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). In preliminary experiments, we optimized conditions for the efficient transfection of BAEC using siRNA. We found that optimal conditions for siRNA knock-down involved transfecting BAEC at 50–70% confluence maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal bovine serum; transfections with siRNA (30 nm, or as noted) used LipofectAMINE 2000 (0.15%, v/v), following protocols provided by the manufacturer. Fresh medium was added 5 h after transfection, and experiments were conducted 48 h after transfection. Drug Treatment, Cell Lysates, and Immunodetection—Culture medium was changed to serum-free medium, and incubations proceeded overnight before all experiments (26Lee H. Goetzl E.J. An S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C612-C618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Igarashi J. Bernier S.G. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12420-12426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). S1P was solubilized in methanol and stored at –20 °C; the same volume of methanol was used as a vehicle control, and the final concentration of methanol did not exceed 0.4% (v/v). VEGF was solubilized in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and stored at –70 °C. Bradykinin was solubilized in water and stored at –20 °C. After drug treatments, BAEC were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 10 min in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 2 μg/ml lima trypsin inhibitor). Cells were harvested by scraping and then centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C. For immunoblot analyses, 20 μg of cellular protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and analyzed with antibodies using protocols provided by the suppliers. Densitometric analyses of the Western blots were performed using a ChemiImager 4000 (Alpha Innotech). Rac Activity Assay—BAEC in 100-mm dishes were transfected with control or caveolin-1-specific siRNA. Cells were starved overnight before experiments, and Rac activity was measured 48 h after transfection. After stimulation with S1P, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 m m EDTA, 10% glycerol, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1mm NaF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 2 μg/ml lima trypsin inhibitor). Pull-down of GTP-bound Rac was performed by incubating the cell lysates with glutathione S-transferase fusion-protein corresponding to the p21-binding domain of PAK-1 bound to glutathione agarose (Upstate Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C following instructions provided by the suppliers. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and the protein bound to the beads was eluted with Laemmli buffer and analyzed for the amount of GTP-bound Rac by immunoblotting using a Rac monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). Migration Assay—Cell migration was assayed (30Wang F. Van Brocklyn J.R. Hobson J.H. Movafagh S. Zukowska-Grojec Z. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35343-35350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) using a Transwell cell culture chamber containing polycarbonate membrane inserts with 8-μm pore (Corning Costar Corp.) coated with 0.2% gelatin. BAEC were transfected with control or caveolin-1-specific siRNA, and experiments were carried out 48 h after transfection; the transfected cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.4% fetal bovine serum for 18 h before migration experiments. The cells were briefly incubated with trypsin to obtain a single-cell suspension, and 5 × 104 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/0.4% fetal bovine serum were added to the upper Transwell chamber. The bottom chamber was filled with 600 μl of media, and the assembly was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. S1P (100 nm) was added to the lower chamber, and the assembly was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h to allow cell migration. In some experiments, wortmannin (500 nm) was added to the lower chamber 30 min before the addition of S1P. After incubation, the membranes were washed with PBS, and the cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde (10 min), permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS (3 min), and stained with 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride according to the manufacturer's protocols. Cells that did not migrate through the membrane were gently removed from the upper surface and the membranes were mounted between slide and coverslips using the SlowFade antifade kit (Molecular Probes Inc.) Cell migration was scored under light microscopy in four random fields by a blinded observer; each experimental treatment was analyzed in triplicate. Albumin Uptake—BAEC were transfected with control or caveolin-1-specific siRNA; 48 h after transfection, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated albumin (10 μg/ml) at 37 °C. Cells were washed with PBS, and cell lysates were prepared as described above. Albumin uptake was analyzed in immunoblots probed with an antibody against Alexa Fluor 488. Isolation of Caveolae-enriched Fractions—Caveolae-enriched fractions were separated by ultracentrifugation in a discontinuous sucrose gradient system as reported previously (28Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). In brief, transfected BAEC from two 100-mm dishes were scraped together into 2 ml of carbonate buffer containing 500 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11, and the cells were homogenized (40 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer) and sonicated (three 20-s bursts in a Branson Sonifier 450). The resulting cell suspension was brought to 45% sucrose by adding 2 ml of 90% sucrose prepared in MES-buffered saline (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl) and placed at the bottom of a 12-ml ultracentrifuge tube. A discontinuous gradient was formed above the 45% sucrose bed by adding 4 ml each of 35% and 5% sucrose solutions (prepared in MES-buffered saline containing 250 mm of sodium carbonate) and centrifuging at 39,000 rpm for 16–20 h in a TH-641 rotor (Sorvall, Asheville, NC). Twelve 1-ml fractions were collected starting at the top of each gradient, and an equal volume of each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described above. Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—BAEC grown on coverslips were transfected with control or caveolin-1-specific siRNA using LipofectAMINE 2000. 48 h after transfection, cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, rinsed with PBS, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100/0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 5 min, and blocked with 10% horse serum in PBS for 1 h. Incubations with primary antibodies were performed in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to immunofluorescent dyes (Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse IgG or Alexa Fluor 568 anti-rabbit IgG) in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times with PBS, coverslips were mounted on slides using the SlowFade antifade kit (Molecular Probes Inc.). For staining of F-actin, fixed cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 3 min and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. Cells were incubated with phalloidin-Alexa Fluor 488 in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 20 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the coverslips were mounted on slides as described previously. Microscopy analysis of samples was performed in the Nikon Imaging Center at Harvard Medical School, using a Nikon TE2000U inverted microscope in conjunction with a PerkinElmer Ultraview spinning disk confocal system equipped with a Hamamatsu Orca ER cooled-CCD camera. Images were acquired using a 60× differential interference contrast oil immersion objective lens and analyzed using Metamorph software from Universal Imaging, Inc. (Downingtown, PA). siRNA-mediated Down-regulation of Caveolin-1 Expression in BAEC—To selectively “knockdown” the expression of caveolin-1 protein in BAEC, we designed a siRNA duplex targeted to the bovine caveolin-1 mRNA (Cav-1 siRNA, sequence 5′-CCAGAAGGAACACACAGUU-dTdT-3′, corresponding to bases 223–241 from the open reading frame of bovine caveolin-1 mRNA). We decided to use siRNA duplexes rather than plasmid-based RNA interference techniques because preliminary experiments (and our past experience) showed that plasmid-based methods had an unacceptably low transfection efficiency in endothelial cells. After optimizing conditions for duplex siRNA transfection, we assayed the ability of this caveolin-1-specific siRNA to knock down caveolin expression by transfecting BAEC with increasing concentrations of this siRNA duplex. Fig. 1A shows an immunoblot probed for caveolin-1 protein in BAEC 48 h after transfection with caveolin-1-specific siRNA. Caveolin-1 expression was efficiently knocked-down in a dose-dependent manner by transfection with Cav-1 siRNA; transfection with a control random sequence siRNA did not affect the expression of caveolin-1 (Fig. 1). Under both experimental conditions, levels of β-actin protein in cell lysates remained constant. To further characterize the effect of caveolin-1 siRNA on caveolin-1 expression levels and protein distribution, we performed immunofluorescence analysis of caveolin-1 in BAEC transfected with Cav-1 and control siRNA. As illustrated in Fig. 2, cells transfected with caveolin-1 siRNA showed a marked reduction of caveolin-1 expression levels compared with control cells (Fig. 2). The subcellular distribution pattern of the small amount of residual caveolin-1 remaining after siRNA-mediated knockdown paralleled the caveolin-1 distribution pattern of control cells: despite the quantitative reduction in caveolin-1 expression, the distribution of the expressed protein seemed to be unchanged (Fig. 2). We next explored whether down-regulation of caveolin-1 expression would affect the subcellular distribution of caveolae-targeted proteins. Fig. 2 shows the results of immunofluorescence microscopy analyses of BAEC transfected with control or caveolin-1 siRNA and stained for the key caveolae-targeted signaling protein eNOS. The subcellular distribution of eNOS was not affected by siRNA-mediated knockdown of caveolin-1; the enzyme was detected as a membrane-associated protein localized at the plasma membrane and around the perinuclear region, as described previously in native BAEC (29Prabhakar P. Thatte H.S. Goetz R.M. Cho M.R. Golan D.E. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27383-27388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Because caveolin-1 has been reported to interact with a variety of actin-binding cytoskeletal proteins (10Oh P. McIntosh D.P. Schnitzer J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 11Stahlhut M. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 325-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), we also explored whether actin organization would be affected in caveolin-1 knockdown cells. Fig. 2 shows siRNA-transfected BAEC stained with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled phalloidin to visualize the actin cytoskeleton. As seen in this figure, caveolin-1 siRNA-treated cells showed both a notable increase in the abundance of lamellipodia and augmented cortical actin rings compared with control cells, suggesting that cytoskeletal structure is altered in endothelial cells in which caveolin-1 is knocked down. Down-regulation of Caveolin-1 Expression Enhances S1P-induced Migration of BAEC—Because siRNA-mediated down-regulation of caveolin-1 significantly altered the cytoskeletal structure of BAEC, we next explored whether caveolin-1 knock-down affected agonist-induced endothelial cell migration. Fig. 3 shows the results of a cell motility assay using a Transwell cell culture chamber. As reported previously in wild-type BAEC (30Wang F. Van Brocklyn J.R. Hobson J.H. Movafagh S. Zukowska-Grojec Z. Milstien S. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35343-35350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), we observed a chemotactic response to S1P in BAEC treated with the control siRNA. BAEC transfected with caveolin-1-specific siRNA displayed significantly greater S1P-mediated migration compared with control cells. The PI3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin significantly attenuated S1P-induced cell migration in control and caveolin-1 siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 3), suggesting that the augmentation in BAEC migration induced by caveolin-1 siRNA is mediated by PI3-kinase pathways. Down-regulation of Caveolin-1 Expression Impairs Albumin Uptake in BAEC—Previous reports have suggested that the transport of albumin across the endothelial barrier is mediated by caveolae (31Schubert W.

Chem. 2001; 276: 38121-38138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We analyzed the effects of siRNA-mediated caveolin-1 knockdown on albumin uptake in cultured BAEC. Control or caveolin-1 siRNA transfected BAEC were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled albumin, and albumin uptake was analyzed in the cell lysates at different time points by immunoblot analyses using an antibody against the exogenous labeled albumin. As shown in Fig. 4, the uptake of exogenous albumin was significantly attenuated in caveolin-1 siRNA-treated cells, demonstrating that down-regulation of caveolin-1 expression is sufficient to impair caveolae-mediated albumin endocytosis in BAEC. Down-regulation of Caveolin-1 Expression Does Not Impair Targeting of Signaling Molecules—Diverse signaling molecules are targeted to caveolae (5Smart E.J. Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C.

https://openalex.org/W2013205499,"Interleukin 1 receptor (IL-1R)-associated kinase-4 (IRAK-4) is required for various responses induced by IL-1R and Toll-like receptor signals. However, the molecular mechanism of IRAK-4 signaling and the role of its kinase activity have remained elusive. In this report, we demonstrate that IRAK-4 is recruited to the IL-1R complex upon IL-1 stimulation and is required for the recruitment of IRAK-1 and its subsequent activation/degradation. By reconstituting IRAK-4-deficient cells with wild type or kinase-inactive IRAK-4, we show that the kinase activity of IRAK-4 is required for the optimal transduction of IL-1-induced signals, including the activation of IRAK-1, NF-κB, and JNK, and the maximal induction of inflammatory cytokines. Interestingly, we also discover that the IRAK-4 kinase-inactive mutant is still capable of mediating some signals. These results suggest that IRAK-4 is an integral part of the IL-1R signaling cascade and is capable of transmitting signals both dependent on and independent of its kinase activity. Interleukin 1 receptor (IL-1R)-associated kinase-4 (IRAK-4) is required for various responses induced by IL-1R and Toll-like receptor signals. However, the molecular mechanism of IRAK-4 signaling and the role of its kinase activity have remained elusive. In this report, we demonstrate that IRAK-4 is recruited to the IL-1R complex upon IL-1 stimulation and is required for the recruitment of IRAK-1 and its subsequent activation/degradation.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 1The abbreviations used are: TLR, Toll-like receptor; IL, interleukin; IL-1R, IL-1 receptor; IRAK, IL-1R-associated kinase-4; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; TRAF, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; EF, embryonic fibroblasts. are critical for receiving signals from molecular patterns associated with microbial pathogens to initiate innate immune responses (1Janeway Jr., C.A.

Interleukin 1 receptor (IL-1R) on the other hand is important for amplifying inflammatory responses triggered by microbial pathogens (4Dinarello C.A. Int. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 457-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Interestingly, signal transduction pathways mediated by the IL-1R and TLRs are very similar (5O'Neill L.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 270: 47-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 6Martin M.U. Wesche H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). One common signaling pathway is initiated by the recruitment of the adaptor protein MyD88 to individual receptors upon ligand binding (7Akira S. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. J. Endotoxin Res. 2000; 6: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). MyD88 in turn is capable of recruiting IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK, also called IRAK-1) to the receptor complex (8Janssens S. Beyaert R. Martin M.U. Wesche H. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 293-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Upon activation and modification, IRAK-1 dissociates from the receptor complex and associates with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) to trigger downstream signaling pathways (9Cao Z.

The apparently simple cascade of MyD88→ IRAK→ TRAF6 became slightly more complex recently with a number of interesting discoveries. Starting from the top of the signaling cascade, three MyD88-like adaptor proteins, Mal (TIRAP), TRIF (TICAM-1), and TRAM (TICAM-2), were reported to play a role in mediating TLR signals (13O'Neill L.A. Fitzgerald K.A. Bowie A.G. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 286-290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Although MyD88 is important in mediating signals for most TLRs and IL-1R (7Akira S. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. J. Endotoxin Res. 2000; 6: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), Mal helps transmit MyD88-dependent signals induced by TLR2 and TLR4 (14Horng T. Barton G.M. Flavell R.A. Medzhitov R.

Nature. 2002; 420: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). TRIF is critical in mediating TLR3 and TLR4 signals, particularly interferon-responsive pathways (through IRF-3) that are MyD88-independent (16Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T.

Studies of IL-1R/TLR signals at the level of IRAKs have also made important progress over the past two years. There are a total of four IRAK family members: IRAK-1, IRAK-2, IRAK-M, and IRAK-4 (10Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar, 21Muzio M.

A. 2002; 99: 5567-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). As deletion of the prototypical member IRAK-1 in mice reveals a partial defect in IL-1R/TLR signaling (24Kanakaraj P. Schafer P.H. Cavender D.E. Wu Y. Ngo K. Grealish P.F. Wadsworth S.A. Peterson P.A. Siekierka J.J. Harris C.A. Fung-Leung W.P. J. Exp.

Immunol. 1999; 163: 978-984PubMed Google Scholar), it was initially speculated that other IRAK proteins might compensate for the absence of IRAK-1. However, mice lacking IRAK-M exhibit enhanced inflammatory responses induced by IL-1 or TLR ligands, suggesting that IRAK-M may instead be a negative signal regulator (26Kobayashi K. Hernandez L.D. Galan J.E. Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 191-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have previously reported that, in IRAK-4-deficient mice, the signals mediated by IL-1R and most TLRs are severely impaired, indicating that IRAK-4 plays an essential non-redundant role in these signaling pathways (27Suzuki N. Suzuki S. Duncan G.S. Millar D.G. Wada T. Mirtsos C. Takada H. Wakeham A. Itie A. Li S. Penninger J.M. Wesche H. Ohashi P.S. Mak T.W. Yeh W.C. Nature. 2002; 416: 750-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). IRAK-4 was shown to be primarily involved in MyD88-dependent pathways including signals triggered by IL-18 and LPS (28Suzuki N. Chen N.J. Millar D.G. Suzuki S. Horacek T. Hara H. Bouchard D. Nakanishi K. Penninger J.M. Ohashi P.S. Yeh W.C. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 4031-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 29Suzuki N.

Immunol. 2003; 171: 6065-6071Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), but the relationship between IRAK-4 and IRAK-1 and the requirement of the kinase activity of IRAK-4 in various signaling events remain to be addressed. In this report, we demonstrate that IRAK-4 is an integral component of the IL-1R signaling complex induced by IL-1 stimulation. The presence of IRAK-4 is required for the recruitment of IRAK-1 to the receptor complex and for the activation and subsequent degradation of IRAK-1 protein. Reconstitution of IRAK-4-deficient cells with wild type IRAK-4, but not kinase-inactive IRAK-4, is capable of restoring IL-1 responses. Interestingly, kinase-inactive IRAK-4 still supports partial cytokine production in IL-1-stimulated mutant cells. These results provide genetic evidence that IRAK-4 is required for IRAK-1 function and that IRAK-4 can transmit signals both through phosphorylation of downstream substrates and through protein-protein interactions that are independent of its kinase activity. Biological Reagents—Recombinant mouse IL-1β was purchased from R&D. Polyclonal rabbit antiserum to murine IRAK-4 was raised against a peptide corresponding to the COOH-terminal amino acids 439–459 of mouse IRAK-4 protein. Polyclonal rabbit antiserum to murine IRAK-1 was raised against a peptide corresponding to the COOH-terminal amino acids 692–712 of mouse IRAK-1 protein. Anti-mouse CD121a (IL-1 receptor, type I/p80) monoclonal antibody, anti-human JNK1 polyclonal antibody, and anti-IκB-α polyclonal antibody were purchased from BD Biosciences, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and Cell Signaling, respectively. 3T3-like immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cloning and Expression Vectors—Human wild type and kinase-inactive IRAK-4 (K213A/K214A) vectors were obtained from H. Wesche (Tularik Inc.). Murine IRAK-4 cDNA was obtained by PCR with a universal mouse cDNA library as template. Expression vectors for IRAK-4 were constructed by inserting PCR-generated cDNA fragments in the mammalian retroviral expression vector, pBabe-puro. Murine IRAK-4 (K213A/K214A) was constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Cytokine Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—For detection of secreted IL-6 protein, MEFs (5 × 104/well) were incubated overnight in 24-well plates in 10% fetal bovine serum-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were treated for 24 h with IL-1β (10 ng/ml) in fresh medium. Supernatants were then collected and analyzed for the presence of IL-6 using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (from BD Biosciences) using recombinant mouse IL-6 as a standard. Transfection-based Reporter Gene Assays—Cells were seeded at a density of 8 × 104/well in 6-well plates 24 h prior to transfection. For experiments with the NF-κB-dependent endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule promoter, cells were transfected using the polycationic transfection reagent Superfect (Qiagen) with 0.2 μg of cytomegalovirus-lacZ/0.8 μg of pELAM-luciferase reporter and the indicated amounts of expression constructs. 42 h after transfection, cells were left untreated or stimulated with 10 ng/ml IL-1β for 6 h. Cells then were washed twice with PBS and lysed in 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega) at room temperature for 30 min. Luciferase activity in 20 μl of extract was measured immediately using the luciferase assay system (Promega) and a luminometer (Spectrafluor Plus, TECAN) according to the manufacturers' instructions. β-Galactosidase activity was measured in 20 μl of extract with 4 mg/ml ONPG (o-nitrophenyl-β-galactopyranoside, Sigma) in a 0.067 m of sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). The optical density then was measured at 405 nm. Fold activation of reporter activity was calculated for each sample by dividing the luciferase activity in the experimental sample (normalized to β-galactosidase activity) by the luciferase activity in the unstimulated control. Stable Transfections—pBabe-puro (24Kanakaraj P. Schafer P.H. Cavender D.E. Wu Y. Ngo K. Grealish P.F. Wadsworth S.A. Peterson P.A. Siekierka J.J. Harris C.A. Fung-Leung W.P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 2073-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), a murine leukemia virus-based retroviral vector, was used to transduce the target genes. 16 h prior to transfection, the packaging cell line (Phoenix) was seeded at 5 × 106 cells/10-cm plate. Cells were grown to 60–70% confluency and transfected with empty pBabe-puro, pBabe-mIRAK-4, or pBabe-mIRAK-4 K213A/K214A vectors using a calcium-phosphate method. Viral supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection and then added to wild type or irak-4–/– cells. The infected cells were grown for 24 h and then subjected to selection in the same medium containing puromycin (2 μg/ml). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analyses—Cells (2 × 106) were seeded on 10-cm plates and incubated with or without 10 ng/ml IL-1β for the indicated amount of time. For harvesting, the plates were immediately chilled in an ice tray, washed once with ice-cold PBS, and then scraped in ice-cold PBS. The cells were centrifuged, and the cell pellet was lysed for 30 min on ice in 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor mixture containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. The cells were spun for 15 min at 6000 rpm in an Eppendorf 5415 C centrifuge, and the solubilized lysate was collected. Lysates were precleared with 20 μlofa 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose or Gamma-bind Plus-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at 4 °C on a rotator. Proteins were immunoprecipitated from precleared lysates by the addition of 1–2 μlof antibody and 30 μl of Sepharose beads followed by incubation for 2–3h at 4 °C on a rotator. The samples were washed five times in lysis buffer, and the beads were resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for IRAK-1 and IRAK-4 and 10% gels for IκBα and JNK immunoblots and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The blots were subsequently incubated with primary antibodies to mIRAK-1, mIRAK-4, IκBα, or JNK, all at 1:1000 dilutions in PBS + 4% milk. Immunoblot analyses were performed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse (Amersham Biosciences) secondary antibodies, and proteins were visualized with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as previously described (27Suzuki N. Suzuki S. Duncan G.S. Millar D.G. Wada T. Mirtsos C. Takada H. Wakeham A. Itie A. Li S. Penninger J.M. Wesche H. Ohashi P.S. Mak T.W. Yeh W.C. Nature. 2002; 416: 750-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). 2 × 106 cells were either left untreated or stimulated with 10 ng/ml IL-1β for the times indicated followed by the preparation of nuclear extracts. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard. 10 μg of nuclear extract was incubated with an end-labeled, double-stranded, and NF-κB-specific oligonucleotide probe containing two tandemly positioned NF-κB-binding sites. The reaction was performed in a total of 20 μl of binding buffer (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 10% glycerol) for 20 min at room temperature. After incubation, samples were fractionated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel and complex formation was visualized by autoradiography. JNK Assay—JNK proteins in total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C using anti-JNK polyclonal antibody (C-17, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Kinase activity in the precipitated fractions was determined using glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun as a substrate in the presence of 60 μm [γ-32P]ATP. The amount of total JNK protein in the immunoprecipitated lysate was determined by Western blotting using the polyclonal anti-JNK antibody. IRAK-4 Is Recruited to the IL-1R Signaling Complex—To study the role of IRAK-4 in IL-1 signaling, three independent sets of IRAK-4-deficient embryonic fibroblasts (EF) and their wild type littermate controls were generated. As shown in Fig. 1A, the defect in IL-1-mediated IL-6 production was reproduced in all of the knock-out lines. These independent IRAK-4-knock-out lines were all utilized in the experiments in this study to minimize the contribution of clonal variation. We have previously demonstrated that signals downstream of MyD88 (and Mal) depend on IRAK-4, whereas overexpression of TRAF6 is capable of activating NF-κB independent of IRAK-4. These results suggest that IRAK-4 functions in the signaling cascade between MyD88 and TRAF6 in a similar position as IRAK-1 (5O'Neill L.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 270: 47-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 8Janssens S. Beyaert R. Martin M.U. Wesche H. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 293-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). We first investigated whether IRAK-4 is recruited to the receptor complex as MyD88 and IRAK-1. As shown in Fig. 1B, as early as 1 min after IL-1 treatment, IRAK-4 is recruited to the IL-1R-associated complex. Interestingly, unlike IRAK-1 that quickly dissociates from the receptor complex (Fig. 2A) and is degraded (6Martin M.U. Wesche H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), IRAK-4 interacts with IL-1R for up to 240 min after stimulation and the total protein level of IRAK-4 does not appear to change during this time period (Fig. 1B). In addition, a mild smearing pattern of IL-1R-associated IRAK-4 was observed at late time points after IL-1 stimulation (Fig. 1B), although the nature of this modification remains unclear. IRAK-4 Deficiency Impairs IRAK-1 Recruitment and Activation—As IRAK-1 has been shown to interact with IRAK-4 shortly and transiently after IL-1 stimulation (23Li S. Strelow A. Fontana E.J. Wesche H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5567-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), we examined whether the absence of IRAK-4 affects the function of IRAK-1 in IL-1 signaling. Indeed, the recruitment of IRAK-1 to the IL-1R complex in response to IL-1 is severely impaired in cells lacking IRAK-4 (Fig. 2A). Subsequent to its recruitment to the IL-1R complex in wild type cells, IRAK-1 becomes phosphorylated (not easily visible in EF cells) and then degraded (readily visible in EF cells) (30Burns K. Janssens S. Brissoni B. Olivos N. Beyaert R. Tschopp J. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). However, in the absence of IRAK-4, IRAK-1 does not undergo activation or degradation following IL-1 treatment (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that IRAK-4 is essential for the recruitment and activation of IRAK-1. It is interesting to note that the level of IRAK-1 expression is enhanced in IRAK-4-deficient cells compared with their wild type counterparts (Fig. 2B), although this enhancement does not confer compensation in IL-1-mediated responses. The Role of IRAK-4 Kinase Activity on IL-1 Signaling Output—If IRAK-4 can function as a kinase and activate downstream substrates such as IRAK-1 (23Li S. Strelow A. Fontana E.J. Wesche H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5567-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 31Kollewe C. Mackensen A.C. Neumann D. Knop J. Cao P. Li S. Wesche H. Martin M.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5227-5236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), it is possible that the kinase activity of IRAK-4 plays a role in IL-1 signal transduction. Indeed, transient overexpression of wild type IRAK-4, but not kinase-inactive IRAK-4, in three independent IRAK-4-deficient cell lines was sufficient to rescue the IL-1-induced response as measured by NF-κB-dependent reporter assays (one representative experiment is shown in Fig. 3). The intensity of the IL-1-mediated NF-κB signal was proportional to the extent of wild type IRAK-4 overexpression. In contrast, equivalent levels of kinase-inactive IRAK-4 expression resulted in severely reduced IL-1 responses compared with wild type reconstitution (Fig. 3). To further investigate the requirement of IRAK-4 kinase activity for IL-1R signaling, we generated stable lines of IRAK-4 null cells expressing vector alone, wild type IRAK-4, or kinase-inactive IRAK-4. Wild type littermate control cells expressing vector alone were utilized as the standard for IL-1 responses. First, we measured IL-1-induced cytokine (IL-6) production and found that mutant cells reconstituted with wild type IRAK-4 were capable of producing IL-6 to almost the same level as the wild type standard. On the other hand, mutant cells reconstituted with kinase-inactive IRAK-4 produced approximately one-tenth to one-fifth of the cytokine levels that cells reconstituted with wild type IRAK-4 produced (Fig. 4A). The level of IL-6 production induced by the kinase-inactive IRAK-4, although severely reduced, was significant considering IRAK-4 mutant cells reconstituted with vector alone produced undetectable levels of IL-6. We confirmed the phenotype of a partial cytokine response mediated by kinase-inactive IRAK-4 by performing stable transfection experiments on all three IRAK-4 knock-out cell lines (data not shown). We also compared wild type and kinase-inactive IRAK-4 reconstitutions using pooled stably transfected cells as well as individually selected stable clones, and similar results were obtained (data not shown). Importantly, protein expression levels of wild type and kinase-inactive IRAK-4 in stable lines were characterized, and those with similar expression levels were utilized for these experiments (Fig. 4A). Finally, we also utilized human wild type and kinase-inactive IRAK-4 to reconstitute mouse IRAK-4-knock-out cells and again kinase-inactive IRAK-4 only partially reconstituted the cytokine response induced by IL-1 (Fig. 4B). NF-κB and JNK activation have been reported to play a role in IL-6 production (32Vanden Berghe W. Vermeulen L. De Wilde G. De Bosscher K. Boone E. Haegeman G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1185-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 33Morse D. Pischke S.E. Zhou Z. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Loop T. Otterbein S.L. Otterbein L.E. Choi A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36993-36998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined these signaling events in IRAK-4 null cells reconstituted with wild type or kinase-inactive IRAK-4. As expected, compared with wild type IRAK-4 reconstitution, the reconstitution of mutant cells with kinase-inactive IRAK-4 resulted in severely defective NF-κB and JNK activation induced by IL-1 (Fig. 4, C and D). These results suggest that the kinase activity of IRAK-4 plays an important role in IL-1 signals leading to NF-κB and JNK activation. We also examined whether the kinase activity of IRAK-4 plays a role in the activation of IRAK-1 in response to IL-1. Compared with wild type IRAK-4 reconstitution of mutant cells, reconstitution with kinase-inactive IRAK-4 was incapable of fully restoring IRAK-1 degradation (which is dependent on its activation) after IL-1 stimulation (Fig. 4E). The common signaling cascade of MyD88→ IRAK→ TRAF6 is responsible for mediating signals induced by the IL-1R and most TLR family members (with the exception of TLR3 and TLR4) (34Akira S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38105-38108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Therefore, studies of how this signaling pathway is regulated will have therapeutic implications for many infectious diseases and inflammatory disorders. In this report, we examine the function of IRAK-4 and its interaction with IRAK-1, both being kinases that play important roles in IL-1R and TLR signaling cascades. We demonstrate that IRAK-4 is essential for IL-1-mediated signals at least partly by participating in the recruitment of IRAK-1 to the receptor complex and in the activation of IRAK-1. The kinase activity of IRAK-4 is indeed required for mediating IL-1-induced NF-κB and JNK activation and for the optimal induction of inflammatory cytokines. In knock-out cells reconstituted with kinase-inactive IRAK-4, the only IRAK-4 molecules available for signaling complex formation lack enzymatic activity but can presumably still signal via their physical association with other signaling molecules. From our results, these kinase-independent interactions are capable of generating a partial cytokine response to IL-1 stimulation. The signals responsible for this partial response are still unknown. One possibility may lie in the kinase activity of IRAK-1 (6Martin M.U. Wesche H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 31Kollewe C. Mackensen A.C. Neumann D. Knop J. Cao P. Li S. Wesche H. Martin M.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5227-5236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). A small fraction of IRAK-1 molecules may be active at the receptor complex, or they may function in the cytosol in response to processed downstream signals. Alternatively, it is interesting to speculate that signaling molecules other than IRAK-1 may mediate signals independent of IRAK-4 kinase activity. These molecules may depend more on protein domain interactions and aggregation to signal. Further studies of novel IRAK-4-interacting proteins could provide important clues to this question. Upon IL-1 stimulation, IRAK-4 interacts with the IL-1R for a sustained period of time, whereas, in contrast, IRAK-1 associates with the receptor only transiently in EF cells. Whether IRAK-4 can transmit signals from the receptor complex when IRAK-1 is absent remains to be addressed. It is possible that there are IRAK-4 substrates other than IRAK-1 that can promote IL-1 signals. Alternatively, the prolonged inclusion of IRAK-4 in the IL-1R complex may serve as a negative signal at later stages to quench ongoing inflammatory responses. Consistent with the latter possibility, the overexpression of IRAK-4 has been shown to inhibit IL-1 signals in certain cell contexts (35Medvedev A.E. Lentschat A. Kuhns D.B. Blanco J.C. Salkowski C. Zhang S. Arditi M. Gallin J.I. Vogel S.N. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 521-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The relationship between IRAK-4 and two other IRAK family members, IRAK-2 and IRAK-M, remains unclear. It is possible that IRAK-2 or IRAK-M can interact with IRAK-4 and may act as substrates for IRAK-4. How these two kinase-inactive IRAK family members might contribute to signaling cascades in a positive manner (thereby mimicking IRAK-1 function) or as negative regulators (as demonstrated in the IRAK-M knock-out) are interesting questions to investigate. Future studies comparing mutant mice and cells lacking individual or combinations of IRAK molecules will help to clarify the molecular mechanisms involving different IRAK molecules. Our results demonstrating the requirement for the kinase activity of IRAK-4 in IL-1R signaling are significantly different from those observed by Qin et al. (36Qin J. Jiang Z. Qian Y. Casanova J.L. Li X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26748-26753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). They concluded from their data using human kinase-inactive IRAK-4 to reconstitute a transformed adult fibroblast cell line derived from a IRAK-4-deficient patient (37Picard C. Puel A. Bonnet M.

Science. 2003; 299: 2076-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar) that the kinase activity of IRAK-4 is dispensable for its signaling function. The reasons for this discrepancy are unclear, but there are three major differences in our experimental systems: 1) mouse versus human; 2) embryonic fibroblasts versus adult fibroblasts; and 3) the status of cell transformation. It is possible that all three factors influenced our results. If the requirement for the kinase activity of IRAK-4 does vary between different tissues, it will be very interesting from the standpoint of the mechanisms of signaling as well as drug development. Further studies will help elucidate these possibilities. We thank Holger Wesche for providing human IRAK-4 expression plasmids and for helpful discussions.

The elongated structure of the conserved core of yeast Dot1p contains an N-terminal helical domain and a seven-stranded catalytic domain that harbors the binding site for the methyl-donor and an active site pocket sided with conserved hydrophobic residues. The S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine exhibits an extended conformation distinct from the folded conformation observed in structures of SET domain histone lysine methyltransferases. A catalytic asparagine (Asn479), located at the bottom of the active site pocket, suggests a mechanism similar to that employed for amino methylation in DNA and protein glutamine methylation. The acidic, concave cleft between the two domains contains two basic residue binding pockets that could accommodate the outwardly protruding basic side chains around Lys79 of histone H3 on the disk-like nucleosome surface.

Histones can be modified in many ways to affect gene expression, including acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, methylation (reviewed in Refs. 1Zhang Y. Reinberg D.

A. 2003; 100: 13225-13230Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Evidence accumulated over the past few years suggests that such modifications constitute a “histone code” that directs a variety of processes involving chromatin (4Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6623) Google Scholar, 5Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7666) Google Scholar). There are currently many known sites of lysine methylation on histones and additional sites of modification are still being uncovered. Methylation at these sites, in combination with other modifications (or demodifications) at nearby residues, generates “modification cassettes” (6Fischle W. Wang Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 2003; 425: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) yielding distinct patterns on chromatin for signaling downstream events (reviewed in Ref. 7Fischle W. Wang Y. Jacobs S.A. Kim Y. Allis C.D. Khorasanizadeh S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1870-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). The best characterized sites of histone methylation are located on the N-terminal tails of histones (such as at Lys4 and Lys9 of histone H3 and Arg3 of histone H4) that protrude from the nucleosome. In contrast, Lys79 of histone H3 is located in the core of the histone, exposed on the nucleosome disk surface. Histone H3 Lys79 is methylated by Dot1p (8van Leeuwen F. Gafken P.R. Gottschling D.E.

Methylation of H3 Lys79 is important for gene silencing and the proper localization of the SIR (silent information regulator) complex in S. cerevisiae (8van Leeuwen F. Gafken P.R. Gottschling D.E.

Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 329-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), similar to the ones in protein-arginine MTases (PRMTs) that modify arginines on many proteins including histones H3 and H4. Class I MTases such as Dot1p are distinct from, and do not contain the SET domain, a conserved domain found in HKMTs that methylate lysines 4, 9, 27, or 36 of histone H3 and Lys20 of H4. Thus, entirely different structural scaffolding and unrelated local active site spatial arrangements can catalyze AdoMet-dependent methyl transfer to a protein Lys side chain. Besides the differences in protein sequence and structure, Dot1p has several unique biochemical properties that distinguish it from the SET domain HKMTs. (i) Dot1p, and its human homolog Dot1L, methylate only nucleosomal substrates, but not free histone H3 protein. Several other enzymes whose targets lie within the highly structured histone core require nucleosome substrates for efficient methylation; this includes Set2, which targets Lys36 of histone H3 (15Strahl B.D. Grant P.A. Briggs S.D. Sun Z.W. Bone J.R. Caldwell J.A. Mollah S. Cook R.G. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell.

(ii) A distribution of unmodified, mono-, di-, and trimethlyated H3 Lys79 exist simultaneously in yeast (8van Leeuwen F. Gafken P.R. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 2002; 109: 745-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Whereas the functions of different methylation states at H3 Lys79 are not fully defined, a complex spectrum of methylation is also found for certain lysine residues methylated by SET domain HKMTs. The S. cerevisiae SET1 protein can catalyze di- and trimethylation of H3 Lys4, and trimethylation of Lys4 is thought to be present exclusively in active genes (18Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Sherriff J. Bernstein B.E. Emre N.C. Schreiber S.L. Mellor J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2002; 419: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). Human SET7/9 protein, on the other hand, generates exclusively monomethyl Lys4 of H3 (19Zhang X. Yang Z. Khan S.I. Horton J.R. Tamaru H. Selker E.U. Cheng X. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 177-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 20Xiao B. Jing C. Wilson J.R. Walker P.A. Vasisht N. Kelly G. Howell S. Taylor I.A. Blackburn G.M. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 2003; 421: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Furthermore, DIM-5 of Neurospora crassa generates primarily trimethyl Lys9 of H3, which marks chromatin regions for DNA methylation (19Zhang X. Yang Z. Khan S.I. Horton J.R. Tamaru H. Selker E.U.

Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Allis C.D. Strahl B.D. Nature. 2002; 418: 498Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). This situation bears similarity to the methylation of Lys4 of H3 by Set1 (23Dover J. Schneider J. Tawiah-Boateng M.A. Wood A. Dean K. Johnston M. Shilatifard A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28368-28371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 24Sun Z.W. Allis C.D. Nature. 2002; 418: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). It was suggested that a ubiquitinated histone H2B might serve as a spacer between adjacent nucleosomes to allow access by enzymes (24Sun Z.W. Allis C.D. Nature. 2002; 418: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Here we present the conserved core structure of yeast Dot1p, the founding member of the Dot1p family, in complex with the methyl transfer reaction product S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (AdoHcy), at a resolution of 2.19 Å. The structure reveals an extended AdoHcy conformation that distinguishes it from the folded conformation found in the SET domain HKMTs, and an active site pocket sided with conserved hydrophobic residues. A catalytic Asn side chain is present at the bottom of the pocket, linking a mechanism of Dot1p to that of aminomethylation of adenine or cytosine in DNA and of the protein glutamine in peptide release factors. Two basic residue binding pockets on the concave surface of an acidic cleft indicate the location of substrate binding. The nucleosomal dependent behavior of Dot1p, mediated by a disordered N-terminal stretch containing many positively charged residues, is also discussed in comparison to the human Dot1L structure (25Min J. Feng Q. Li Z. Zhang Y. Xu R.M. Cell. 2003; 112: 711-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Purification—The S. cerevisiae Dot1 gene was subcloned from the original pFVL39 construct (8van Leeuwen F. Gafken P.R. Gottschling D.E. Cell. 2002; 109: 745-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) by PCR into a modified pET28b (Novagen) vector, which adds a short N-terminal MGHHHHHH tag and accepts an NdeI-EcoRI insert. Deletions (Δ157 and Δ172) and point mutations were constructed by PCR using the same vector. Cultures of Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) Codon plus RIL (Stratagene) containing Dot1 constructs were grown in LB medium at 37 °C to A600 = 0.6, shifted to 22 °C, and induced by 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight at 22 °C. Selenium-containing Δ157 Dot1 protein (with seven methionines) was expressed in a methionine auxotrophic stain (B834) grown in the presence of selenium-methionine, and the protein was purified similarly to the native protein. The His-tagged proteins were purified using nickel-chelating, Hitrap Q, Hitrap SP, and Superdex 75 columns (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was stored in the Superdex 75 column buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol. Amino acid replacements of Dot1Δ157 to yield D301A, D301N, E374A, E374Q, Y350F, Y372F, E422D, E422A, W543F, W543A, Y550F, and Y550A were made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). All mutants were sequenced to verify the presence of the intended mutation and the absence of additional mutations. Mutant proteins were purified from 300 ml of induced cultures by nickel-chelating, Hitrap Q and S columns. Methyl Transfer Activity Assay—The activity was assayed in a 20-μl reaction containing 25 mm citric acid, 25 mm CHES, 50 mm BisTris propane (pH 8.5), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 μCi of [methyl-3H]AdoMet (14.7 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences NET155H), 1 μm enzyme, and 2 μm nucleosome (either purified from chicken erythrocyte or recombinant nucleosome, a gift from Dr. K. Luger). The enzyme was preincubated with [methyl-3H]AdoMet at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was started by addition of the nucleosome substrates, incubated at 30 °C for 1 h, and methylation was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, fluorography, or by precipitation with 20% trichloroacetic acid, filtration (Millipore GF/F filter), washing, and liquid scintillation counting. For DNA stimulation experiments, 150-base pair DNA (1 or 5 μm) (Fig. 2D) or 30-base pair DNA was preincubated with the enzyme and [methyl-3H]AdoMet at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was started at 30 °C for 1 h by addition of recombinant histone octamers (a gift from Dr. K. Luger). For analysis of optimum pH, a mixture of 25 mm citric acid, 25 mm CHES, and 50 mm BisTris propane were adjusted to each pH (Fig. 2E). AdoMet Binding Assay by UV Cross-linking—An aliquot of 2 μg of purified enzyme was incubated with 0.5 μCi of [methyl-3H]AdoMet (14.7 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences NET155H) at room temperature for 1 h in 20 μl of 25 mm citric acid, 25 mm CHES, 50 mm BisTris propane (pH 8.5), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were transferred to a 96-well plate on ice and placed 8 cm from an inverted UV transilluminator (VWR, 302 nm) for 1 h. The protein was then separated by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie, and subjected to fluorography. Nucleosome and DNA Binding Assay by Gel Shift—Different amounts of Dot1 protein were incubated with mononucleosome (1 μm) or 36-mer (GAC)12 DNA (0.5 μm) at 30 °C for 1 h in a 10-μl volume containing 25 mm citric acid, 25 mm CHES, 50 mm BisTris propane (pH 8.5), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. After incubation, the sample was added to glycerol final concentration of 5% and subjected to a 1.8 (nucleosome) or 1.2% (DNA) agarose gel and visualized under UV by ethidium bromide staining. Nucleosome Preparation—Whole chicken blood from birds 6-8 weeks of age was supplied by Pel-Freeze Biologicals (Rodgers, AR) with sodium citrate as anticoagulant. Preparation of chicken erythrocyte nuclei was performed as described in Ref. 26von Holt C. Brandt W.F. Greyling H.J. Lindsey G.G. Retief J.D. Rodrigues J.D. Schwager S. Sewell B.T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 431-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, except that 0.5% Nonidet P-40 was used instead of Nonidet LE. Soluble chromatin was isolated from 1 ml of isolated nuclei by treatment with micrococcal nuclease, according to Ref. 27Kornberg R.D. LaPointe J.W. Lorch Y. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar. In brief, isolated nuclei were treated with 20 units of micrococcal nuclease at 37 °C for 30 min in 15 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 65 mm NaCl, 65 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 2× complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor solution (Roche Diagnostics). Following incubation, EDTA was added to 5 mm, and the reaction cooled on ice. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation (4000 × g, 5 min) and broken by Dounce homogenization. After a second centrifugation, chromatin was solubilized in 2 ml of 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 600 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.2 mm EDTA. Under these conditions, linker histones dissociate. Mono- and polynucleosomes were isolated by gel filtration in the solubilization buffer over a Sephacryl S-300 column (Amersham Biosciences). DNA content was evaluated by phenol-chloroform extraction and agarose gel electrophoresis. Fractions judged to contain polynucleosomes had a minimum of 800 base pairs of DNA associated with them, whereas mononucleosomes had equal to or less than 200. Nucleosome preparations appeared to be linker-histone and contaminant-free by SDS-PAGE. Fractions were pooled, concentrated against solid sucrose, and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Nucleosomes were snap frozen and stored at -80 °C. Crystallography—Purified Δ157 protein was concentrated to 15-20 mg/ml in the gel filtration column buffer with 600 μm AdoHcy. Crystals were obtained via the hanging drop method, with the mother liquor containing 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 18% PEG 8000 (or 20% PEG 2000 MME), and 15% glycerol at 16 °C. The diffraction data were collected at beamline X26C of the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory. A selenium-containing crystal was used to collect a single wavelength data set at the selenium absorption peak wavelength (Table I). The data were reduced and scaled using DENZO/SCALEPACK package (28Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38570) Google Scholar). There are three molecules per asymmetric unit. SOLVE (29Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The phases were greatly improved by RESOLVE (30Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 173-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). The non-crystallographic restraints were imposed on the three protein molecules throughout the refinement by CNS programs (32Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

After several cycles of refinement and manual rebuilding, the final model was refined with an R value of 21.3% and a free R value of 24.6%. Among the nonglycine and nonproline well defined residues, 92% are in the most favored and 8% in the additional allowed regions of a Ramachandran plot (33Laskowski R.A. J. Appl.

Open table in a new tab A Conserved Dot1p Core—Purified full-length yeast Dot1p (582 residues) was subjected to limited protease digestion by V8 protease, generating a stable C-terminal fragment representing amino acids between 158 and 582, termed Δ157. Dot1p Δ157 contains a core region conserved among human, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, and Anopheles gambiae Dot1p homologues. The length of these Dot1 proteins varies from 582 amino acids in yeast to 2237 amino acids in Drosophila. The conserved Dot1p core is located at the C terminus in yeast, but is at the N terminus in human, C. elegans, Drosophila, and Anopheles gambiae Dot1p homologues (Fig. 1A). The Δ157 protein, expressed more efficiently than the full-length protein, retained partial activity on nucleosomes (Fig. 2A). Here we describe the structure of Δ157 in complex with the methyl donor by-product AdoHcy. Overall Structure of Dot1p—Electron density maps were calculated using single wavelength anomalous diffraction data from a SeMet-incorporated crystal (Table I). The crystallographic asymmetric unit contains three molecules of Δ157 (Fig. 3A). However, analytic gel filtration and dynamic light scattering measurements suggest that the protein Δ157 has an apparent molecular weight of a monomer (data not shown) and we thus describe the monomeric structure. Monomeric Δ157 contains two domains (Fig. 3B). The N-terminal domain consists of 4 β-strands (β1-β4) and 6 α-helices (αA-αF). Three helices (αB, αC, and αD), together with a hairpin (β2 and β3), mimic a classic up and down four-helix bundle, where the hairpin replaces the fourth helix. The N-terminal residues (purple), unique to yeast Dot1p, appear to be critical to the structural integrity of the molecule: the 41-residue segment (amino acids 176-216) forms a V-shaped structure clamped onto nearly the entire N-terminal domain, pairing strand β1 with strand β4, and packing helix αA with αE, followed by a 10-residue loop (residues 202-211) buried between the N- and C-terminal domains, and capping with a 310-helix. After a disordered region (residues 217-234), the N-terminal domain connects to strand β2 (Fig. 3B). The C-terminal region forms the catalytic domain (orange) with a seven-stranded β-sheet (β5-β11), a characteristic feature of the class I AdoMet-dependent MTases (14Schubert H.L. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 329-335Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 37Cheng X. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3784-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Helices αK, αL, and αM are located on one side of the β-sheet, and helices αH, αI, and αJ are on the other side. In addition, helix αJ is packed with N-terminal helix αF, connecting the two domains. Interestingly, rather than a hydrophobic interface, in the middle of the interface between the two domains lies two pairs of salt bridges, Arg441 of αJ and Glu249 of β3, Arg352 of αF and Glu267 of βB, surrounded by many polar residues saturated with hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3C). The overall dimensions of the molecule are 75 × 35 × 35 Å, with an open cleft located between the two domains (Fig. 3D). There are three segments disordered in the current structure: the N-terminal residues (158-175), residues 217-234 prior to strand β2, and the C-terminal residues (567-577). The disordered N-terminal residues co-localize with the disordered C-terminal residues of a crystallographic related molecule on the surface of the cleft. Discontinuous densities exist on the concave surface of the cleft (Fig. 4), but we were not able to unambiguously distinguish between the N- and C-terminal residues. Nevertheless, the densities allowed us to identify two basic residue-binding sites. One piece of the density is in an open pocket at the bottom of the cleft (Fig. 4C). An Arg residue best fits the density, forming an interaction with Glu374 (an invariant amino acid, see Fig. 1B). The second piece of density can be fit by a stretch of 5 or 6 residues, which possibly contains a Lys side chain forming hydrogen bonds with Ser177, Asn297, and Asp301 (Fig. 4D). The concave cleft between the two domains is the likely binding site for the substrate. The bottom of the cleft is highly acidic (Fig. 4A), complementing with the basic nucleosomal disk surface around Lys79 of histone H3 (Fig. 4E), which includes many positively charged residues of H3 (Arg72 and Arg83), H4 (Arg67, Lys79, and Arg78), and H2B (Arg89, Arg96, and Lys105), forming a core nucleosome surface crucial for transcriptional silencing (38Park J.H. Cosgrove M.S. Youngman E. Wolberger C. Boeke J.D. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The Arg- and Lys-binding sites identified on the surface of the concave cleft may provide a docking site for the outwardly protruding basic side chains around Lys79 of histone H3. Many of the residues that form the Arg- and Lys-binding sites, particularly Asp301, Tyr350, Tyr372, and Glu374, are invariant in the six Dot1p homologous shown in Fig. 1B. The importance of these residues in histone binding is supported by site-directed mutagenesis experiments. Changes at the two negatively charged residues (D301A, D301N, E374A, and E374Q) essentially abolished HKMT activity (Fig. 4F, top two panels). However, the mutants had normal expression levels and retained the ability to bind AdoMet, DNA, and nucleosomes (Fig. 4F, three bottom panels). We suggest that the loss of methyl transfer activity was because of defects in binding one of the basic residues near Lys79 of histone H3 on the disk-like nucleosome surface. Such a defect may affect proper positioning of the target Lys79 into the active site, without total disruption of the nucleosome association through DNA interaction. Of course, we cannot completely exclude the involvement Glu374, located near the active site, in catalysis, although we consider it unlikely (see “Discussion”). Conservative changes at the two tyrosine residues (Y350F and Y372F) reduced HKMT activity, consistent with the hydroxyl groups of Tyr350 and Tyr372 being critical in positioning the side chain of Glu374 away from the active site by forming hydrogen bonds to one of the two carboxyl oxygen atoms of Glu374 (Fig. 4C). Dot1p Core Contains Conserved Sequence Motifs Common to Class I MTases—Having determined the structure of yeast Dot1p, we were able to perform a structure-guided sequence alignment of Dot1 family proteins (Fig. 1B). The sequence alignment reveals invariant or conservatively substituted positions scattered throughout the conserved core. Only two regions of the conserved core have more than 2-residue insertions or deletions among the different Dot1 homologues (Fig. 1B). In comparison with human Dot1L (25Min J. Feng Q. Li Z. Zhang Y. Xu R.M. Cell. 2003; 112: 711-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), a longer and bent helix αC is formed (because of Pro294) by yeast Dot1p residues 284-300 and additional secondary structures helix αE and strand β4 are formed by yeast Dot1p residues 325-338. The four most highly conserved segments involve consecutive invariant residues, namely YGE prior to helix αH, DLGSGVG in the carboxyl end of strand β5 and the loop that follows, NNF after strand β8, and VSWT between strands β10 and β11. These segments correspond to the sequence motifs X, I, IV, and VIII in the class I MTases; we therefore retain the nomenclature (39Malone T. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 618-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). However, the structure shows that these four motifs are clustered together on one surface patch at or near the AdoHcy-binding site (Fig. 3E). In addition, motifs II and III contain a single invariant residue (Glu422 and Phe460) involved in direct interactions with AdoHcy (see below). The structure suggests that the conserved Dot1p motifs have functional importance. Besides being involved in direct interactions with AdoHcy (motif I, Asp397 and Gly399; motif II, Glu422; and motif III, Phe460), active site formation (motif X, Gly373; motif IV, Phe481; and motif VIII, Trp543), and catalysis of methyl transfer (motif IV, Asn479), many invariant residues (motif I, Ser400; motif IV, Asn480; and motif VIII, Ser542) are involved in intramolecular interactions that likely confer stability to the molecule, particularly around the AdoHcy-binding and active sites.

https://openalex.org/W2150620646,"In the thyroid, iodotyrosine dehalogenase acts on the mono and diiodotyrosines released during the hydrolysis of thyroglobulin to liberate iodide, which can then reenter the hormone-producing pathways. It has been reported that the deiodination of iodotyrosines occurs predominantly in the microsomes and is mediated by NADPH. Recently, two cDNAs, 7401- and 7513-base pairs long that encode proteins with a conserved nitroreductase domain were published in GenBank as iodotyrosine dehalogenase 1 (DEHAL1) and iodotyrosine dehalogenase 1B (DEHAL1B), respectively. We report here our investigation of the localization and activity of one of these isoforms, DEHAL1. DEHAL1 mRNA is highly expressed in the thyroid, is up-regulated by cAMP, and encodes a transmembrane protein that efficiently catalyzes the NADPH-dependent deiodination of mono (L-MIT) and diiodotyrosine (L-DIT), with greater activity vs. L-MIT. Iodotyrosine deiodinase was active in HEK293 cells transfected by DEHAL1 cDNA, but not in CHO cells. A fraction of DEHAL1 protein is exposed to the cell surface, as indicated by biotinylation experiments. Immunohistochemistry studies showed that DEHAL1 proteins accumulate at the apical pole of thyrocytes. Taken together, these findings indicate that the deiodination reaction occurs at the apical pole of the thyrocyte and is involved in a rapid iodide recycling process at and/or close to the organification site."
https://openalex.org/W2086249546,"The amyloid β peptide (Aβ) is toxic to neuronal cells, and it is probable that this toxicity is responsible for the progressive cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer's disease. However, the nature of the toxic Aβ species and its precise mechanism of action remain to be determined. It has been reported that the methionine residue at position 35 has a pivotal role to play in the toxicity of Aβ. We examined the effect of mutating the methionine to valine in Aβ42 (AβM35V). The neurotoxic activity of AβM35V on primary mouse neuronal cortical cells was enhanced, and this diminished cell viability occurred at an accelerated rate compared with Aβ42. AβM35V binds Cu2+ and produces similar amounts of H2O2 as Aβ42 in vitro, and the neurotoxic activity was attenuated by the H2O2 scavenger catalase. The increased toxicity of AβM35V was associated with increased binding of this mutated peptide to cortical cells. The M35V mutation altered the interaction between Aβ and copper in a lipid environment as shown by EPR analysis, which indicated that the valine substitution made the peptide less rigid in the bilayer region with a resulting higher affinity for the bilayer. Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that both Aβ42 and AβM35V displayed a mixture of α-helical and β-sheet conformations. These findings provide further evidence that the toxicity of Aβ is regulated by binding to neuronal cells.

Although the precise mechanism of Aβ-induced neuronal toxicity remains unclear, the interaction of Aβ with membranes and/or membrane proteins appears to play an important role in Aβ-mediated neurotoxicity. Because Aβ contains part of the transmembrane domain of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), it is not surprising that Aβ interacts with cell membranes and lipoproteins. Numerous reports have described the effects of Aβ on membranes and lipid systems and their possible roles in Aβ neurotoxicity. These include changes in membrane fluidity leading to membrane depolarization and disorder (11Muller W.E. Kirsch C. Eckert G.P. Biochem. Soc.

Aβ can decrease the fluidity of both artificial unilamellar liposomes and mouse brain membranes (12Hartmann H. Eckert A. Muller W.E. Life Sci. 1994; 55: 2011-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and human frontal cortex membranes (11Muller W.E. Kirsch C. Eckert G.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Aβ has an amplifying effect on cellular calcium signaling. At a low concentration, Aβ acts by stimulating endogenous calcium conductance pathways (20Hartmann H. Eckert A. Muller W.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 1216-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), whereas at higher concentrations Aβ disrupts the membrane to allow calcium flux in a channel-like fashion (15Arispe N.

The Met-35 residue in the Aβ42 sequence has been reported to play a key role in Aβ toxicity because Aβs with Met-35 substituted by either norleucine or cysteine are non-toxic and unable to induce oxidative stress responses in cells (24Varadarajan S. Yatin S. Kanski J. Jahanshahi F. Butterfield D.A. Brain Res. Bull. 1999; 50: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 25Varadarajan S. Kanski J. Aksenova M. Lauderback C. Butterfield D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 5625-5631Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In contrast, we reported that Met(O)Aβ has significant toxicity to neuronal cells in primary culture (26Barnham K.J. Ciccotosto G.D. Tickler A.K. Ali F.E. Smith D.G. Williamson N.A. Lam Y.H.

Many of the proposed mechanisms of toxicity listed above are dependent on Aβ aggregation, whether as dimers or trimers (9Walsh D.M. Klyubin I. Fadeeva J.V. Cullen W.K. Anwyl R. Wolfe M.S. Rowan M.J. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 2002; 416: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (3721) Google Scholar), larger aggregates such as protofibrils (27Harper J.D. Wong S.S. Lieber C.M. Lansbury P.T.

The oxidation of methionine affects the aggregation properties of the peptide leading to an altered oligomer size distribution (30Bitan G. Tarus B. Vollers S.S. Lashuel H.A. Condron M.M. Straub J.E. Teplow D.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 15359-15365Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and inhibition of fibril formation (31Hou L. Kang I. Marchant R.E. Zagorski M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40173-40176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In addition, Met(O)Aβ induces changes in peptide structure resulting in modified aggregation properties and diminished interactions with lipid membranes by inhibiting membrane penetration (26Barnham K.J. Ciccotosto G.D. Tickler A.K. Ali F.E. Smith D.G. Williamson N.A. Lam Y.H. Carrington D. Tew D. Kocak G. Volitakis I. Separovic F. Barrow C.J. Wade J.D. Masters C.L. Cherny R.A. Curtain C.C. Bush A.I.

Nonetheless, these modifications did not significantly hinder the toxic effects of the peptide suggesting that Aβ toxicity via these mechanisms is of secondary importance. To further probe the role of Met-35 in Aβ toxicity we investigated a novel mutant Aβ42 where the Met-35 was substituted with a Val residue (AβM35V) and studied its neurotoxic, structural, and biochemical properties compared with its wild type Aβ42 equivalent. Peptide Preparation—Synthetic Aβ42 was purchased from W. M. Keck Laboratory (Yale University, New Haven, CT). Recombinant Aβ42 and AβM35V were purchased from Recombinant Peptide Technologies (Athens, GA). Peptide working stock solutions were prepared by making a 250 μm concentration by weight, dissolving the peptide in 20 mm NaOH, and then diluting out in water and 10× PBS in a v/v ratio of 2:7:1. All Aβ solutions were sonicated in a water bath for 5 min and centrifuged for 5 min at high speed, and supernatant was used for the toxicity experiments. The absorbance value at 214 nm was measured, and an accurate concentration of the peptides was determined using a molar extinction coefficient value of 75,887 liters/mol/cm and adjusting the final concentration to 200 μm. This method of Aβ preparation is associated with increased peptide solubility and reproducibility between experiments. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Primary Neuronal Cultures—Cortical neuronal cultures were prepared as described previously under sterile conditions (26Barnham K.J. Ciccotosto G.D. Tickler A.K. Ali F.E. Smith D.G. Williamson N.A. Lam Y.H. Carrington D. Tew D. Kocak G. Volitakis I. Separovic F. Barrow C.J. Wade J.D. Masters C.L. Cherny R.A. Curtain C.C. Bush A.I. Cappai R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42959-42965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Briefly, embryonic day 14 BL6J×129sv mouse cortices were removed, dissected free of meninges, and dissociated in 0.025% (w/v) trypsin (Sigma) in Krebs buffer. The dissociated cells were triturated using a filter-plugged fine pipette tip, pelleted, resuspended in plating medium (minimum Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 5% horse serum), and counted. Cortical neuronal cells were plated into poly(l-lysine)-coated 48-well plates at a density of 125,000 cells/well in plating medium. All cultures were maintained in an incubator set at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After 2 h the plating medium was replaced with fresh neurobasal medium containing B27 supplements, geneticin, and 0.5 mm glutamine (all tissue culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen unless otherwise stated). This method resulted in cultures highly enriched for neurons (>95% purity) with minimal astrocyte and microglial contamination as determined by immunostaining of culture preparations using specific marker antibodies (data not shown). Cell Viability Assays—The neuronal cells were allowed to mature for 6 days in culture before commencing treatment using freshly prepared neurobasal medium plus B27 supplements minus antioxidants. For the treatment of neuronal cultures, freshly prepared soluble Aβ stock solutions were diluted to the final concentration in neurobasal medium. The mixtures were then added to neuronal cells for up to 4 days. Cell survival was monitored by phase contrast microscopy, and cell viability was quantitated using the MTS assay as described previously (26Barnham K.J. Ciccotosto G.D. Tickler A.K. Ali F.E. Smith D.G. Williamson N.A. Lam Y.H. Carrington D. Tew D. Kocak G. Volitakis I. Separovic F. Barrow C.J. Wade J.D. Masters C.L. Cherny R.A. Curtain C.C. Bush A.I. Cappai R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42959-42965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Briefly, the medium was replaced with fresh neurobasal medium supplemented with B27 lacking antioxidants, and 10% v/v MTS (Promega, Madison, WI) was added to each well and incubated for 3–4 h at 37 °C ina5%CO2 incubator. Plates were gently shaken, and a 100-μl aliquot from each well was transferred to separate wells of a 96-well plate. The color change of each well was determined by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm using a Wallac Victor Multireader, and background readings of MTS incubated in cell-free medium were subtracted from each value before calculations. The data were normalized and calculated as a percentage of untreated vehicle control values. Data are shown as mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons between groups were done using Student's t test. Electron Microscopy—200 μm stock solutions of Aβ42 and AβM35V were prepared as described above and diluted to 5 μm in 1× PBS to replicate the concentration of peptide that is routinely used for toxicity experiments. An initial aliquot (day 0) and further aliquots were taken at days 1, 2, and 3 following incubation at 37 °C. Aliquots were then serially diluted at 1:100 four times in water. A small drop was then spotted in the center of a carbon-coated grid (ProSciTech, Queensland, Australia) and allowed to dry by placing the grid upside down on a 3% agar dish for up to 1 h at room temperature. The peptides were negatively stained with 0.5% uranyl acetate for 3 min and then washed several times with water. Images of the samples were taken using a Siemens ELMI-SKOP 102 electron microscope. H2O2 Assay—Dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was dissolved in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (5 mm; argon purged for 1 h at 20 °C), deacetylated with 50% v/v 0.05 m NaOH for 30 min, and then neutralized (pH 7.5) to a final concentration of 1 mm. The reactions were carried out in Dulbecco's PBS, pH 7.5, in a 96-well plate (250 μl/well) containing freshly prepared synthetic peptide (200 nm), copper-glycine (150 nm CuCl2 and 900 nm glycine), and ascorbate (0, 1.1, 2.2, 4.4, 8.8, and 17.6 μm) in the presence of deacylated DCF (100 μm) and horseradish peroxidase (0.1 μm) incubated at 37 °C. There was a 4:3 molar excess of peptide to copper to ensure that there would be no free copper ions in the solution. The reaction was carried out at 200 nm Aβ42 to reflect the soluble concentration of Aβ in the brain. Studies were performed on the day of reagent preparation. The fluorescence signal specific for H2O2 was decreased in parallel samples co-incubated with catalase (40 units/ml; 100 nm). Fluorescence readings were recorded on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS55 plate reader (excitation, 485 nm; emission, 530 nm) against a standard curve of reagent grade H2O2 in PBS. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Preparation of LUVs—Large unilaminar vesicles were prepared by initially dissolving equal quantities of palmitoyl phosphatidyl serine (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.) and synthetic palmitoyl phosphatidyl choline in chloroform. The chloroform was evaporated off, and the lipids were resuspended in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, to 50 mg/ml. Following the addition of some glass beads, the mixture was shaken for 1 h at 37 °C. The lipid mixture was then decanted from the glass beads, subjected to freeze-thaw cycles using liquid nitrogen and a 37 °C water bath, and finally passed through an extruder apparatus, resulting in a uniform solution of LUV having a mean diameter between 120 and 140 nm. LUVs were stored at 4 °C and used within 48 h of preparation. EPR Spectroscopy—The acidic phospholipid spin label 16NPS was synthesized according to Hubbell and McConnell (32Hubbell W.L. McConnel H.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971; 93: 314-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (1428) Google Scholar). The water-soluble spin label Tempo choline chloride (TCC) was obtained from Molecular Probes. All spin probes were checked for purity to ensure that their number of spins/mol were >90% of theory (33Aloia R.C. Curtain C.C. Gordon L.M. Methods for Studying Membrane Fluidity, Advances in Membrane Fluidity. 1. Liss, New York1988Google Scholar). LUVs were prepared by freezing and thawing of the lipid suspension six times and then extruding the suspension through a 22-μm Nucleopore filter (Pleasanton, NJ) (34Hope M.J. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar). Lyophilized peptides were weighed and dissolved at the desired concentration in a suspension of LUV in buffer, and the mixture was vortexed under N2 for 10 min at 305 K. Stock solutions of 100 mm concentration of analytical reagent grade CuCl2 were prepared, and the desired amount was added to the LUV after addition of the peptide. The metal chelator EGTA (50 mm) was added to all control solutions to counter the possible effects of any trace metals present. For copper EPR measurements, 99.99% pure 65Cu (Cambridge Isotopes) was used. Metal concentrations were measured by inductively coupled plasmamass spectroscopy (Model 700, Varian), and peptide concentrations were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. Continuous wave X-band EPR spectra were obtained using a Bruker ECS106 spectrometer equipped with a temperature controller and flow-through cryostat. Cu2+ spectra were collected at 110 K from samples contained in 4-mm inner diameter “Suprasil” quartz EPR tubes (Wilmad). Labeled lipid samples (25 μl) were contained in 0.8-mm inner diameter quartz capillaries (Wilmad) and handled as described by Gordon et al. (35Gordon L.M. Looney F.D. Curtain C.C. J. Membr. Biol. 1985; 84: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) to ensure reproducibility. Other procedures, including adding to the spin-labeled LUV a small amount of the water-soluble, non-membrane-penetrant spin probe Tempo choline chloride to ensure x axis reproducibility, have been described previously (22Curtain C.C. Ali F. Volitakis I. Cherny R.A. Norton R.S. Beyreuther K. Barrow C.J. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Barnham K.J. J. Biol.

J. 1999; 28: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The analysis of EPR spectra of peptide/lipid mixtures was carried out using the spectral subtraction and addition methods described by Marsh (38Marsh D. Spin Labeling: Theory and Applications.in: Berliner L. Reuben J. Biological Magnetic Resonance. 8. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1989: 255-303Google Scholar). As a check on the validity of these procedures as applied to our system, where a motion-restricted lipid component was observed, the lipid spin label spectra were simulated using the modified Bloch equations as described by Davoust and Devaux (39Davoust J. Devaux P.F. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 475-494Google Scholar). Their Model I was used in the simulations, where the unique director orientation in the fluid component, corresponding to the nitroxide axes being aligned along the membrane normal in the motion-restricted lipid component, was assumed to be preserved on exchange. CD Spectroscopy—The LUV mixture was subjected to five freezethaw cycles and then extruded 11 times through a 0.1-μm pore filter (Millipore, Australia) using an Avanti “mini-extruder” apparatus. Aβ42 and AβM35V were dissolved in LUVs (50 mg/ml, giving a molar ratio of 60:1 LUV/peptide) in the presence of Cu2+ (molar ratio of 1:1 Cu2+/peptide). The samples were then diluted in phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, to a final peptide concentration of 10 μm. The CD spectra were obtained using a Jasco 810 spectropolarimeter at 37 °C. Far-UV CD spectra were obtained from 190 to 260 nm with a 1-cm path length. The base line acquired in the absence of peptide was subtracted, and the resulting spectra were smoothed using a Fourier transform. Peptide Binding and Cell Uptake—5 μm Aβ42 and AβM35V were added to 6-day-old cortical neuronal cells in culture for 1 h. The conditioned medium was then collected and centrifuged, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. The cortical neurons in the wells were briefly washed in cold PBS or ice-cold 0.1 m sodium carbonate (carbonate wash); the cells were scraped up from the wells, and proteins were extracted from the cells in 100 μl of extraction buffer. The conditioned medium and cell extracts were analyzed by Western blot to confirm the presence of peptide uptake by cells. Aliquots of each sample were diluted in sample buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 8% SDS, 50% glycerol, 25% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) and heated to 90 °C for 5 min, and samples were separated by SDS-PAGE using 16.5% T, 3% C Tris-Tricine gels and then transferred to 0.2-μm pore nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). Immunoblots were boiled for 5 min in PBS and blocked for 1 h in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% skim milk. The immunoblots were then probed for 2 h at room temperature with an anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody (WO2, targeting Aβ residues 5–8) diluted 1:50 from culture medium in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, washed three times in 10-min intervals in TBST, probed with a peroxidase sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin diluted 1:5000 in TBST for 1 h at room temperature, and then washed several times again. Blots were developed with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 min per the manufacturer's instruction, and the chemiluminescent signals from immunoblots were quantitated using a charge-coupled device camera imaging system and GeneTool analysis software (GeneGnome, Syngene, Cambridge, UK). AβM35V Is More Neurotoxic than Wild Type Aβ42—The neurotoxic activity of AβM35V was tested to determine whether it, like the wild type Aβ42, is toxic to neuronal cells. AβM35V had a significantly higher degree of toxicity on neuronal cortical cultures than Aβ42 after 96 h at all of the concentrations tested (Fig. 1A). Because AβM35V is potently toxic to cells at 5 μm after 96 h of treatment, we examined the cell viability of the cortical neurons at shorter treatment times of 24, 48, and 72 h (Fig. 1B). The cell viability of the cortical neurons treated with wild type Aβ42 was significantly decreased after 72 and 48 h but not after 24 h. In comparison, AβM35V was 2–2.5-fold more toxic to the neuronal cells compared with Aβ42 after 72 and 48 h. A 24-h treatment with AβM35V caused a significant decrease in cell viability (Fig. 1B). To determine whether the toxicity of AβM35V was mediated via H2O2, we used a selective H2O2-scavenging enzyme catalase as reported previously (26Barnham K.J. Ciccotosto G.D. Tickler A.K. Ali F.E. Smith D.G. Williamson N.A. Lam Y.H. Carrington D. Tew D. Kocak G. Volitakis I. Separovic F. Barrow C.J. Wade J.D. Masters C.L. Cherny R.A. Curtain C.C. Bush A.I. Cappai R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42959-42965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). As expected, the catalase completely rescued the toxicity induced by Aβ42. However, it only caused total rescue of AβM35V at the lowest concentration examined (1.25 μm), and partial rescue was observed at the higher doses tested (Fig. 1A). This indicates that AβM35V utilized H2O2-like wild type Aβ42, but at the higher concentrations of AβM35V tested, the high levels of cell toxicity far exceeded the capacity of catalase to exert its protective properties. The Aggregation Profiles of Aβ42 and AβM35V Were Similar in Electron Micrographs—Aβ will form oligomers, protofibrils, or fibrils when dissolved and allowed to aggregate (40Huang T.H. Yang D.S. Plaskos N.P. Go S. Yip C.M. Fraser P.E. Chakrabartty A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Aβ42 and AβM35V were prepared under identical conditions, and the sizes of the oligomeric species formed after 0 and 3 days of incubation were examined by electron microscopy (Fig. 2). The results show that the day 0 samples for both Aβ42 and AβM35V had aggregated with diameters generally less than 10 nm (Fig. 2, Day 0). There were no quantifiable differences in the observed sizes of the oligomers for AβM35V and Aβ42 at day 0 or after day 3 (Fig. 2). Catalytic Production of H2O2 Is Similar between Aβ42 and AβM35V—The ability of catalase to rescue Aβ toxicity implicates the generation of H2O2 in the toxic pathway. We have reported previously that Aβs in the presence of the redox-active metal copper and iron are able to catalytically generate H2O2. The catalytic activity of both Aβ42 and AβM35V to produce H2O2 was determined using a DCF assay (41Barnham K.J. Haeffner F. Ciccotosto G.D. Curtain C.C. Tew D.J. Mavros C. Beyreuther K. Carrington D. Masters C.L. Cherny R.A. Cappai R. Bush A. FASEB J. 2004; (July 1, 10.1096/fj.04–1890fje)PubMed Google Scholar). The Vmax and Km of H2O2 production were determined by successively increasing the amount of the substrate ascorbic acid used in the reaction (Fig. 3A). The Lineweaver-Burk plots yielded straight lines for both Aβ42 and AβM35V (Fig. 3B). The calculated Vmax (63 ± 4 and 45 ± 1nm/min) and Km (3.6 ± 0.4 and 1.4 ± 0.1 μm) values were similar for Aβ42 and AβM35V, respectively, indicating that the presence of Met-35 is not critical for the production of H2O2 in the presence of a substrate such as ascorbate. EPR Spectroscopy Reveals That AβM35V Has a Slower Copper-reducing Activity and Is Less Rigid in a Lipid Bilayer—The Cu2+ EPR spectra of the two peptide complexes at pH 6.9 were determined and plotted in Fig. 4A. The spectra are characteristic of type 2 square planar coordination of the Cu2+ (42Berliner L.J. Reuben J. Biological Magnetic Resonance. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1978Crossref Google Scholar) and are identical, indicating that substituting the Met to Val does not alter the copper coordination site of Aβ42. Both samples were allowed to stand at 295 K for a series of time intervals (0–24 h); then the temperature was reduced to 110 K, and their spectra were recorded. The amount of Cu2+ visible in the spectra was determined by double integration and plotted in Fig. 4B. This shows that the reduction of Cu2+ to the EPR-silent Cu+ is much slower with AβM35V, confirming earlier observations (22Curtain C.C. Ali F. Volitakis I. Cherny R.A. Norton R.S. Beyreuther K.

T cell responses, including interferon-γ production, are severely suppressed in chronic HCV patients. The HCV core protein has been previously shown to circulate in the bloodstream of HCV-infected patients and inhibit host immunity through an interaction with gC1qR. To determine the role of the HCV core-gC1qR interaction in modulation of inflammatory cytokine production, we examined interleukin (IL)-12 production, which is critical for the induction of interferon-γ synthesis, in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human monocyte/macrophages. We found that core protein binds the gC1qR displayed on the cell surface of monocyte/macrophages and inhibits the production of IL-12p70 upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation. This inhibition was found to be selective in that HCV core failed to affect the production of IL-6, IL-8, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor α. In addition, suppression of IL-12 production by core protein occurred at the transcriptional level by inhibition of IL-12p40 mRNA synthesis. Importantly, core-induced inhibition of IL-12p40 mRNA synthesis resulted from impaired activation of AP-1 rather than enhanced IL-10 production. These results suggest that the HCV core-gC1qR interaction may play a pivotal role in establishing persistent infection by dampening TH1 responses.

The propensity of HCV to persist in the vast majority of infected individuals suggests that the virus has evolved one or more mechanism(s) of evading host immunity. Unfortunately, the current anti-HCV therapy, IFN-α treatment in conjunction with the nucleoside analog ribavirin, has proven ineffectual, and attempts to generate a vaccine against viral proteins have been unsuccessful (10Hino K.

Cavalletto L. Pontisso P. Alberti A. Gretch D.R. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 7241-7247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) is critical for the elimination of virus-infected cells. Virus-specific CTL, both in the liver and periphery, are significantly diminished in chronic HCV patients as compared with those observed for other persistent viruses, such as hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus (12Rehermann B. Chang K.M. McHutchinson J. Kokka R. Houghton M. Rice C.M. Chisari F.V. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7092-7102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Nelson D.R. Marousis C.G. Davis G.L. Rice C.M. Wong J. Houghton M. Lau J.Y. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1473-1481PubMed Google Scholar). This apparent suppression of CTL responses suggests that HCV may interfere with CD4+ helper T cell activation and differentiation, thus allowing for the establishment of chronic infection. IL-12, which is known to regulate proinflammatory T helper (TH) 1 responses by promoting IFN-γ production, provides an important link between innate and adaptive immunity. Patients chronically infected with HCV demonstrate a diminished capacity to up-regulate IL-12 and generate TH1-type immunity (14Amaraa R. Mareckova H. Urbanek P. Fucikova T. Immunol. Lett. 2002; 83: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 15Sarih M. Bouchrit N. Benslimane A. Immunol. Lett. 2000; 74: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Kanto T. Hayashi N. Takehara T. Tatsumi T. Kuzushita N. Ito A. Sasaki Y. Kasahara A. Hori M. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5584-5591PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to HCV, several other infectious organisms, including measles virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and Legionella pneumophila, prevent the establishment of a TH1 environment by inhibiting IL-12 production (17Karp C.L. Wysocka M. Wahl L.M. Ahearn J.M. Cuomo P.J. Sherry B. Trinchieri G. Griffin D.E. Science. 1996; 273: 228-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 18Chehimi J. Starr S.E. Frank I. D'Andrea A.

Immun. 2001; 69: 1929-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This suppression of TH1 polarization by infectious organisms may represent a novel mechanism of host immune evasion. Although both lymphocytes and macrophages are targeted for infection by HCV, the rate of infectivity is relatively low (20Gunji T. Kato N. Hijikata M. Hayashi K. Saitoh S. Shimotohno K. Arch. Virol. 1994; 134: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 21Lerat H. Berby F. Trabaud M.A. Vidalin O. Major M. Trepo C. Inchauspe G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Thus, it is unlikely that infection of these cells alone accounts for the immune dysregulation observed in chronic HCV patients, suggesting that the virus may utilize an indirect mechanism, such as the production of an immunomodulatory factor, to persist. HCV core (21 kDa), which is the first protein to be produced upon viral infection, demonstrates multiple functions, affecting numerous operations within both the host and virus. In addition to forming the viral nucleocapsid, HCV core has been observed to modulate host cellular responses, including apoptosis and immunity (22McLauchlan J. J. Viral Hepat. 2000; 7: 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 23Dolganiuc A. Kodys K. Kopasz A. Marshall C. Do T. Romics Jr., L. Mandrekar P. Zapp M. Szabo G. J.

Studies on mice infected with a panel of recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing the various HCV proteins demonstrated the HCV core protein to be sufficient for the increased morbidity and mortality because of failure of vaccinia viruses clearance (26Accapezzato D Francavilla V Rawson P. Cerino A. Cividini A. Mondelli M.U. Barnaba V. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This core-induced immune suppression was found to result from inhibition of IFN-γ-mediated CTL activation. Interestingly, activated murine macrophages stably transfected with a vector containing HCV core exhibit severely diminished IL-12 and nitric oxide production (27Lee C.H. Choi Y.H. Yang S.H. Lee C.W. Ha S.J. Sung Y.C. Virology. 2001; 279: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This result corresponds well with the clinical observation that HCV-infected individuals with a self-limited course of disease demonstrate a TH1 dominance, whereas those who progress to chronic infection tend toward a TH2 phenotype (15Sarih M.

In addition to cytoplasmic and nuclear localization, HCV core protein is secreted from stably transfected cell lines. Indeed, circulating core protein is detectable in the bloodstream of infected patients, where it may provide the virus with an indirect, infection-independent mechanism of immune dysregulation (30Kanto T.

Recently, we demonstrated that exogenous addition of HCV core protein to mixed lymphocyte culture resulted in suppression of IFN-γ production and T cell proliferation (3Kittlesen D.J. Chianese-Bullock K.A. Yao Z.Q. Braciale T.J. Hahn Y.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Importantly, this core-induced inhibition of T cell responsiveness was dependent upon its interaction with a complement receptor, gC1qR, on the surface of immune cells (3Kittlesen D.J.

The natural ligand of gC1qR, C1q, functions to elicit diverse responses within cells of the immune system by modulating both innate and adaptive inflammatory responses. Although C1q affects innate immunity by enhancing phagocytosis in macrophages and mediating C1q-dependent cytotoxicity, C1q also influences adaptive immunity by suppressing cytokine expression and cellular proliferation (33Kishore U.

Notably, HCV core has been shown to elicit similar inhibitory effects on T cell responsiveness through its interaction with gC1qR, suggesting that HCV might usurp gC1qR signaling to down-regulate host immune responses (3Kittlesen D.J. Chianese-Bullock K.A. Yao Z.Q. Braciale T.J. Hahn Y.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Indeed, gC1qR has been shown to interact with several pathogen-derived proteins in addition to HCV core, including HIV-1 Rev, EBV EBNA-1, and Listeria monocytogenes internalin B, potentially providing these organisms with a novel mechanism of immune subversion (37Luo Y. Yu H. Peterlin B.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3850-3856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Matthews D.A. Russell W.C. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 1677-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 39Braun L. Ghebrehiwet B. Cossart P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1458-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Here we sought to determine whether the interaction between HCV core and gC1qR on the surface of monocyte/macrophages (M/Mϕ) might suppress IL-12 production, a key cytokine for induction of IFN-γ and TH1 type CD4+ T cell responses. To address this possibility, we examined the effect of HCV core on the production of IL-12 by human M/Mϕ stimulated with the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) ligand LPS, which is known to induce production of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-12. We demonstrated that HCV core is able to bind the surface of M/Mϕ and that this binding involves an interaction with gC1qR. Further, we found that exogenous addition of HCV core to human PBMC stimulated with either LPS or SAC/anti-IL10 antibody results in suppression of both IL-12p70 and IFN-γ production. We subsequently demonstrated that M/Mϕ are targeted for IL-12p70 inhibition by HCV core within the bulk PBMC population and that this suppression involves a diminished capacity to up-regulate IL-12p40 mRNA by interfering with AP-1 activation. Importantly, HCV core-mediated inhibition of IL-12p40 mRNA synthesis depends upon its interaction with gC1qR. These results indicate that the HCV core-gC1qR interaction may be significant in the establishment of chronic HCV infection through the suppression of TH1 responses, and, for the first time, report the role of gC1qR in immunomodulation of antigen presenting cell function. Therapies aimed at disrupting this interaction may prove invaluable in the prevention of HCV persistence. Cell Cultures—PBMC were isolated from whole blood or buffy coats of donors (Virginia Blood Services) by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient (Amersham Biosciences). The cells were washed twice and cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT), penicillin/streptomycin (100 μg/ml; Invitrogen), l-glutamine (2 mm), and 2-mercaptoethanol (55 μm; Invitrogen) at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. THP-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), a human monocytic leukemia cell line, were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 2 mm l-glutamine adjusted to contain 0.15% sodium bicarbonate, 0.45% glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.05 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. Quantification of Cytokine Production by ELISA—PBMC (2 × 105cells/well) were stimulated to produce IL-12p70 and/or IFN-γ by incubation in complete medium containing 0.005% (v/v) Staphylococcus aureus Cowen strain (SAC; Sigma) and 10 μg/ml anti-IL-10 antibody (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) in a round-bottomed, 96-well tissue culture plate for 24 h. Primary human M/Mϕ (5 × 105 cells/well) were isolated from the bulk PBMC by attachment to a 48-well, flat-bottomed polystyrene tissue culture plate for 20 min at 37 °C. Macrophage maturation of THP-1 cells was driven by incubation of 6 × 105 cells in complete medium containing 1.2% Me2SO for 24 h at 37 °C. These isolated M/Mϕ and matured THP-1 cells were presensitized with 100 ng/ml recombinant human (rh)-IFN-γ (BD Pharmingen) for 16 h and were stimulated with 5 μg/ml LPS (Sigma) in the presence of varying doses of either β-gal-fused HCV core (Virogen, Watertown, MA) or β-gal control protein for 24 h at 37 °C. The supernatants were obtained to quantify the production of IL-12p70 or IFN-γ by ELISA (BD Pharmingen). For quantification of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-8, primary M/Mϕ were activated as above, and cytokine levels were determined using a BD™ cytometric bead array multiplex assay (BD Biosciences), as per the manufacturer's instructions. Flow Cytometric Analysis—To determine core binding on the cell surface of M/Mϕ, 1 × 106 PBMC were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of His6-tagged HCV core (80 nm). His6-tagged HCV core was expressed as six histidine residues located at the N terminus of the full-length HCV core protein (amino acids 2–191) and was purified under native conditions as described previously (32Yao Z.Q. Nguyen D.T. Hiotellis A.I. Hahn Y.S. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5264-5272Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The cells were washed three times in fluorescence-activated cell sorter media (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1% NaN3). The cells were resuspended in 50 μl of fluorescence-activated cell sorter media and incubated with anti-gC1qR (University of Virginia Hybridoma Center) or anti-core (Affinity Bioreagents, Inc., Golden, CO) monoclonal antibodies on ice for 1 h. After washing three times, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-mouse IgG (BD Pharmingen) on ice for 1 h in the dark. The cells were washed three times at 4 °C and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and analyzed by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Unstained cells and primary isotype controls were used to determine the levels of background fluorescence. The viable cell gates were used to collect 30,000 events. To address the role of gC1qR in core binding to macrophages, anti-gC1qR polyclonal antibody, prebleed control sera (1:10 (v/v) dilution; QED Bioscience, San Diego, CA), or soluble His6-gC1qR or His6-DHFR (prepared in our laboratory) were co-incubated with His6 core and PBMC. Core binding was assessed by flow cytometry as described above. Determination of Cytokine mRNA Levels—RT-PCR was employed to determine the levels of IL-12p40, IL-10, and β-actin mRNA. RNA was isolated by TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 1 μg of RNA was treated with DNase to digest genomic DNA and 0.27 μg of RNA was then reverse transcribed using murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase under conditions of 10 min at room temperature, 20 min at 42 °C, 5 min at 99 °C, and 5 min at 5 °C. Various volumes of cDNA generated in the RT reaction were added to the PCR. PCR was carried out using the following primer pairs: IL-12p40 sense 5′-CAGCAGTTGGTCATCTCTTG-3′, antisense 5′-CCAGCAGGTGAAACGTCCAG-3′; IL-10 sense 5′-ATGCCCCAAGCTGAGAACCA-3′, antisense 5′-TCTCAAGGGGCTGGGTCAGC-3′; and β-actin sense 5′-CGAGCGGGAAATCGTGCGTGACAT-3′, antisense 5′-CGTCATACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCACATCT-3′ for 35 cycles of 95 °C for 40 s, 60 °C for 20 s, 72 °C for 40 s, followed by 10 min of incubation at 72 °C. Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—5 × 106 THP-1 cells/well were matured and primed with rh-IFN-γ as before, followed by activation with 5 μg/ml LPS for various time points. The nuclei were isolated by suspending cells in extraction buffer (200 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.5 m EDTA, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 2.5 μl of Nonidet P-40/ml) for 15 min on ice. The cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 800 × g and 4 °C. Supernatant was removed and stored as cytoplasmic fraction. The nuclear extracts were prepared by resuspending nuclei in extraction buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl, incubating on ice for 15 min, and centrifuging for 15 min at 16,000 × g and 4 °C. 20% glycerol was added to stabilize isolates, and extracts were mixed with 32P-labeled probes for either NF-κB, 5′-ACTTCTTGAAATTCCCCCAGAAGG-3′, AP-1, consensus binding motif 5′-TGACTCA-3′ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or NF-IL-6, 5′-TCGATCAGTTGCAAATCGT-3′. The mixtures were run on a 4% acrylamide gel, which was prerun for 20 min at 200V. Supershift was conducted using antibodies specific for the p65 or p50 subunits of NF-κB (Santa Cruz Biologicals). To control for nonspecific binding of the probe, binding was also carried out in the presence of a 10× unlabeled competitor. The gel was dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film at –80 °C. HCV Core Binds the Surface of Human Monocytes/Macrophages in a gC1qR-dependent Manner—We previously demonstrated that HCV core interaction with gC1qR results in suppression of IFN-γ production and T cell proliferation in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (3Kittlesen D.J. Chianese-Bullock K.A. Yao Z.Q. Braciale T.J. Hahn Y.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 32Yao Z.Q. Nguyen D.T. Hiotellis A.I. Hahn Y.S. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5264-5272Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To determine whether the HCV core-gC1qR interaction alters the production of inflammatory cytokines (i.e. IL-12) and inhibits IFN-γ production, we first examined the ability of HCV core to bind gC1qR displayed on the cell surface of primary human monocytes/macrophages (M/Mϕ). As shown in Fig. 1a, 94.3% of primary M/Mϕ were positive for the expression of cell surface gC1qR by flow cytometric analysis. Additionally, when cells were incubated with recombinant His6 core, 64.0% of primary M/Mϕ displayed core protein bound on their surface (Fig. 1b). To assess the role of gC1qR in the association of core with M/Mϕ, we determined the ability of α-gC1qR antibody to prevent core binding on the cell surface of M/Mϕ. In the presence of specific α-gC1qR antibody, but not prebleed control sera, the percentage of core-bound M/Mϕ was reduced by 54%, whereas the mean intensity of staining decreased 68% (Fig. 1c). Likewise, we examined the ability of soluble recombinant gC1qR to antagonize core association with M/Mϕ. Excess His6-gC1qR (molar ratio of 6× core) reduced the frequency as well as intensity of core staining in M/Mϕ by 42 and 59%, respectively (Fig. 1d). In contrast, an equivalent excess amount of His6-DHFR control protein did not affect core binding to M/Mϕ. These results suggest that gC1qR is as a receptor for binding HCV core on the cell surface of M/Mϕ. HCV Core Inhibits IL-12p70 and IFN-γ Production by Activated PBMC—IL-12p70, the biologically functional form of IL-12, is responsible for inducing IFN-γ production and T cell proliferation (40Trinchieri G. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (2975) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of HCV core on modulation of IL-12p70 production by activated PBMC, we determined IL-12p70 production in PBMC stimulated with SAC/α-IL-10 antibody in the presence or absence of β-gal core by ELISA. As shown in Fig. 2a, IL-12p70 production in SAC/α-IL-10-stimulated PBMC is significantly inhibited by HCV core in a concentration-dependent manner as compared with that in β-gal control protein-treated cells. In addition, His6 core prepared in our laboratory is able to inhibit IL-12p70 production similar to that seen with the commercially available β-gal core (data not shown). To ensure that the inhibition of IL-12p70 production is not as a result of cell death induced by core protein, LDH release as well as trypan blue exclusion analyses were performed and revealed little cell death following the 24-h incubation period under any of the treatment conditions (data not shown). IL-12 secreted by antigen presenting cells is able to induce IFN-γ production in T and NK cells (40Trinchieri G. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (2975) Google Scholar). In addition, chronic HCV patients exhibit depressed peripheral IFN-γ levels (15Sarih M. Bouchrit N. Benslimane A. Immunol. Lett. 2000; 74: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 41Ulsenheimer A. Gerlach J.T. Gruener N.H. Jung M.C. Schirren C.A. Schraut W. Zachoval R. Pape G.R. Diepolder H.M. Hepatology. 2003; 37: 1189-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Based on the apparent suppression of IL-12 observed above, we next sought to determine the effect of HCV core on IFN-γ production by activated PBMC. As shown in Fig. 2b, HCV core demonstrates a significant, dose-dependent inhibition of IFN-γ production by SAC/α-IL-10-stimulated PBMC as compared with those treated with control protein β-gal. These data indicate that HCV core can suppress IL-12 as well as IFN-γ production from human PBMC. It implicates that the inhibition of IFN-γ production by HCV core might be responsible for preventing TH1 type CD4+ T cell responses as observed in chronic HCV patients. HCV Core Selectively Inhibits IL-12 Production by Activated Macrophages—Macrophages and dendritic cells are the major sources of IL-12 produced during an inflammatory response (42Trinchieri G. Adv. Immunol. 1998; 70: 83-243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the observed suppression of IL-12p70 by HCV core might be due to a direct interference with macrophage/dendritic cells activation by HCV core. To examine whether HCV core affects macrophage-derived IL-12p70 production, primary M/Mϕ were isolated from the bulk PBMC by adherence to polystyrene. Because LPS is a potent inducer of inflammatory cytokine production including IL-12, isolated M/Mϕ were activated by LPS in the presence of varying doses of either β-gal core or β-gal. As shown in Fig. 3a, HCV core inhibits IL-12 production by activated M/Mϕ in a dose-dependent manner. A 4-fold decrease in IL-12p70 was detected in cells treated with 100 nm core. In contrast, control protein β-gal fails to elicit the inhibitory effect on IL-12p70 production. The HCV core-mediated inhibition of IL-12 production was reproducible in primary M/Mϕ derived from 10 different blood donors (data not shown). These results suggest that HCV core interferes with macrophage activation and is able to inhibit IL-12 production. In addition, HCV core also suppressed IL-12p70 production in LPS- or CD40L-stimulated human dendritic cells (data not shown). To confirm the ability of HCV core to inhibit IL-12 production by primary M/Mϕ, we examined the ability of HCV core to affect IL-12p70 production by the human monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1. As shown in Fig. 3b, HCV core elicited a similar dose-dependent inhibition of IL-12p70 production by LPS-stimulated THP-1 (10-fold decrease in IL-12p70 at 100 nm core) as observed in primary M/Mϕ. It is notable that the amount of IL-12p70 produced by activated THP-1 in this experiment was ∼10-fold greater than that observed for primary M/Mϕ. In contrast, the β-gal control protein did not affect IL-12p70 production by these cells. In addition to IL-12, macrophages also produce other inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-8 followed by the binding of LPS on TLR4 (43Magor B.G. Magor K.E. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2001; 25: 651-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To determine whether HCV core-gC1qR engagement affects the production of other cytokines, we examined the effect of HCV core on secretion of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-8 by LPS-stimulated primary M/Mϕ using a cytometric bead array. As shown in Fig. 4, HCV core elicited no significant effect on production of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, or IL-8 in LPS-stimulated primary M/Mϕ. This suggests that the ligation of gC1qR by HCV core selectively inhibits IL-12p70 production in macrophages in response to LPS stimulation.

Herein, we report that in macrophages, the chemokine RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted)/CCL5 activates the small GTPase Rac and its downstream target PAK2 within seconds. This response depends on Gi activation and largely on the subsequent triggering of phosphoinositide 3-kinase γ (PI3Kγ) and Rac. Retroviral transduction of tagged Rac1 and -2 indicates that RANTES/CCL5-mediated activation of PI3Kγ triggers Rac1 but not Rac2. In agreement, silencing of Rac1 by shRNA blocks PAK2 activity and inhibits RANTES/CCL5-induced macrophage polarization and directional migration. On the other hand, the tyrosine kinase receptor agonist CSF-1 activates PAK2 independently of PI3Kγ and Rac. Our results thus demonstrate a chemokine-specific signaling pathway in which Gi and PI3Kγ coordinate to drive Rac1 and PAK2 activation that eventually controls the chemotactic response.

Rac1, Rac2, and Rac3 constitute a subfamily of the Rho family of monomeric GTPases and cycle between active GTP-bound (RacGTP) and inactive GDP-bound (RacGDP) states (1Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem.

Rho GTPases integrate signals from cellular receptors and membrane components to regulate the cytoskeleton dynamics required for cell locomotion during chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and many other cellular responses (2Ridley A.J.

Sci. 1998; 19: 376-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) is primarily mediated by chemokine signaling. RANTES CCL5 is a disease-relevant and potent chemoattractant for macrophages. Moreover, it has been shown that RANTES-mediated T-cell activation and chemotaxis requires Rho GTPase activity (8Clissi B. D'Ambrosio D. Geginat J. Colantonio L. Morrot A. Freshney N.W. Downward J.

Biol. 2002; 22: 774-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). RANTES is a member of the CC-subfamily of chemokines and activates the seven-transmembrane CC-chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR3, CCR4, and CCR5, which are coupled to pertussis toxin sensitive heterotrimeric Giα proteins (10Proudfoot A.E. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 106-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). PI3K was identified as a target of these G-protein-coupled chemokine receptors because chemotaxis and polarization of T cells could be inhibited by isoform non-selective class I PI3K inhibitors, such as LY294002 (11Turner L. Ward S.G. Westwick J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2437-2444PubMed Google Scholar). All class I PI3Ks are heterodimers consisting of a 110-kDa (p110) catalytic subunit and an 85-(p85) or 101-kDa (p101) regulatory subunit (12Stein R.C. Waterfield M.D. Mol. Med. Today. 2000; 6: 347-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The two catalytic subunits p110α and -β are ubiquitously expressed, whereas p110γ and -δ expression is largely confined to leukocytes. In addition to their characteristic expression, PI3Ks are differentially regulated by GPCRs and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) (13Katso R. Okkenhaug K. Ahmadi K. White S. Timms J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 615-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). RTKs have been shown to activate p110α, -β, and -δ via the p85 regulatory subunit (class I A: PI3K-α, -β, and -δ). In contrast, it has been shown that regulation of p110γ (class I B: PI3Kγ) is mediated via the p101 adapter, engaged by Giβγ subunits released after activation of GPCRs (14Stephens L.R. Eguinoa A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Cooke F. Coadwell J. Smrcka A.S. Thelen M. Cadwallader K. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T.

Class I B PI3Kγ-deficient mice, PI3Kγ-/-, showed in vitro and in vivo impaired migration of neutrophils and macrophages toward chemoattractants (15Hirsch E. Katanaev V.L. Garlanda C. Azzolino O.

PI3Kγ-/- neutrophils are unable to produce 3′-phosphorylated phosphoinositides (PIP3; e.g. phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate) when stimulated with GPCR agonists such as fMLP, complement component 5a, or interleukin-8. When activated by cell surface receptors, all isoforms of PI3K generate intracellular membrane-integral 3′-phosphorylated phosphoinositides as second messengers. Proteins can bind via different protein modules to PIP3, among them pleckstrin homology domains (18Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Like for several PI3K-regulated protein kinases, such as AKT/PKB (19Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2001/66/pe1)PubMed Google Scholar, 20Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem.J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar), Rho-GEFs contain pleckstrin homology domains but in addition have an adjacent Dbl homology domain (21Hoffman G.R. Cerione R.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 85-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the Dbl homology domain is responsible for the GEF activity and regulated by the pleckstrin homology domain that binds phospholipids such as PIP3. In many cell types, PI3K activity and elevated PIP3 are necessary and sufficient for receptor-driven stimulation of Rac activation (22Hawkins P.T. Eguinoa A. Qiu R.G. Stokoe D. Cooke F.T. Walters R.

Cantrell D.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1445-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To trigger the reorganization of the cytoskeleton during migration and phagocytosis, RacGTP interacts with several downstream effectors. One of these downstream targets comprises a family of serine/threonine protein kinases termed PAK (24Daniels R.H. Bokoch G.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The isoforms PAK1 and PAK2 belong to the well-studied PAK-I subfamily. RhoGTPases and PI3Ks have been shown to be involved in the regulation of macrophage chemotaxis (25Ridley A.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 168-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that PI3Kγ-deficient macrophages show only partial loss of migration in vitro and in vivo in response to chemokine stimuli, suggesting that PI3K-independent signaling mechanisms are capable of supporting chemotaxis. The objective of this study was to investigate possible signaling cross-talk between Rac and PI3Kγ and, furthermore, to elucidate PI3K-independent pathways involved in chemokine signaling in murine macrophages. Our strategy combined genetic inactivation of PI3Kγ and pharmacological inhibition of PI3Ks, tyrosine kinases, and GPCRs in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM). To gain better insight into signaling specificity addressed by ligands that can induce comparable cellular responses in macrophages (such as cell migration) yet act via GPCR or RTK, we have stimulated BMDM with either RANTES or macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF-1), respectively (26Allen W.E. Jones G.E. Pollard J.W. Ridley A.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 707-720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We monitored RacGTP activity by PAK-p21 Rac-binding domain (PAK-PBD) affinity precipitation (27Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 28Huang R. Lian J.P. Robinson D. Badwey J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7130-7138Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and the activation status of PAK and AKT with phosphospecific antibodies as well as in-gel kinase assays. Furthermore, retrovirus-transduced primary macrophages with constructs coding for epitope-tagged HA-Rac proteins or shRNA has specified Rac1 as the isoform regulated by PI3Kγ and required for PAK activation and cell migration. Macrophage Preparation, Growth, and Stimulation Conditions— PI3Kγ-/- mice have been described previously (15Hirsch E. Katanaev V.L. Garlanda C. Azzolino O. Pirola L. Silengo L. Sozzani S.

Isolated bone marrow cells (29Stanley E.R. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 75: 301-304PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in BMDM medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Ham's F12 medium (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum (Cansera, Rexdale, ON, Canada), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 20% fresh conditioned medium of L929 cells rich in CSF-1) (30Englen M.D. Valdez Y.E. Lehnert N.M. Lehnert B.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). After 5 days in suspension, cells were seeded on tissue culture plates, and experiments were performed at day 7 or 8. Differentiated adherent BMDM were characterized by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (BD Biosciences) for CD11b, CD11c, GR-1, F4/80, and CCR5 expression (data not shown). Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis showed equal mRNA expression of p110α,-β,-δ, p101, CSF-1-R (c-fms), CCR1, -3, and -5 in WT and PI3Kγ-/- BMDM; p110γ mRNA was expressed only in WT BMDM. RANTES binds to CCR1, -3, and -5 (10Proudfoot A.E. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 106-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis revealed that CCR5 protein was equally expressed in WT and PI3Kγ-/- BMDM. Anti murine-CCR1 and -CCR3 antibodies were not available, but previous studies suggest that macrophages express CCR1 but not CCR3 (31Baggiolini M. Nature. 1998; 392: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (2407) Google Scholar). Unless indicated otherwise, BMDM were starved overnight in L929-free medium and subsequently in serum-free medium for 4 h. Starved BMDM were stimulated with serum-free medium for control samples or with either 0.8 μm RANTES (A. Proudfoot, SPRI) or 50 ng/ml CSF-1 (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) in serum-free medium. BMDM were pretreated with either 50 μm genistein (Calbiochem), 10 μm LY294002 (Calbiochem) for 15 min, or 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin (Sigma) for 4 h. Rac activation assay—Active GTP-bound Rac was precipitated with a PAK-PBD-based assay (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Stimulation of BMDM (10 cm dish) was stopped by addition of 0.75 ml of ice-cold 1× MLB (Upstate Biotechnology). Dishes were placed on ice and scraped, and samples were rotated for 10 min and clarified by centrifugation for 1 min. Aliquots were saved for immunoblot analysis. Lysates were rotated with 10 μg of PAK-PBD agarose at 4 °C for 30 min. The agarose pellet was washed twice and resuspended in 30 μl (1:1; v/v) reducing sample buffer. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (4-12% Bis-Tris gels, MES buffer; Invitrogen), transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen), and blotted for Rac. Immunoblotting analysis—Cell lysates were suspended in (1:4; v/v) reducing sample buffer, boiled, and separated by SDS-PAGE (4-12% Bis-Tris gels, MOPS buffer; Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen) with a semi-dry blotting apparatus (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following antibodies: phospho-PAK1Ser-199/204/phospho-PAK2Ser-192/197 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), phospho-PAK1Thr-423/phospho-PAK2Thr-402 (Cell Signaling), phospho-AKTSer-473 (Cell Signaling), and PAK, recognizing PAK1 and PAK2 (C-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PAK2 (Cell Signaling), AKT (Cell Signaling), Rac (23A8; Upstate Biotechnology), and HA.11 (Babco, Richmond, CA) and subsequently with the appropriate secondary antibody (peroxidaseconjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG, 1:10,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.). Bound antibodies were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Band intensities were quantified with Quantity-One software (Bio-Rad Laboratories). PAK In-gel Kinase Assay—This assay is based on the ability of renatured PAKs to phosphorylate their specific peptide substrate p47-phox (amino acid residues 297 to 331; 0.5 mg/ml) polymerized into the gel (28Huang R. Lian J.P. Robinson D. Badwey J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7130-7138Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The assay was performed according to published methods with minor modifications (32Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Yamashita T. Hoshi M. Kawakami M. Sakai H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 33Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Positions of PAK were visualized by autoradiography after incubation of the gel with 150 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. MnCl2 (2 mm) was added to the gel equilibration solution, and 0.08% Tween 20 was added to the renaturation buffer. Recombinant active PAK2 (Upstate Biotechnology) was used as a positive control for gel mobility and kinase activity. Retroviral Transduction—The retroviral packaging cell line Platinum-E (Plat-E) and the vector pMX have been described previously (34Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar). Human cDNA clone of Rac1 was purchased as pUSEamp-Rac1 (Upstate Biotechnology). The sequence of Rac2 (GenBank accession no. NM_009008) was cloned by PCR from a mouse thymus cDNA library into pAcGTC8 vector. Both Rac1 and Rac2 coding sequences were subcloned into the pMX vector in frame with a N-terminal triple-HA epitope-tag. Plat-E cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (4500 mg/ml glucose; Sigma), 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, 1 μg/ml puromycin (BD Biosciences Clontech) and 10 μg/ml blasticidine S (Calbiochem). Before calcium phosphate transfection, cells were cultured without puromycin and blasticidine S. Virus was collected 48 and 72 h later, concentrated, and processed as described previously (35Bowles N.E. Eisensmith R.C. Mohuiddin R. Pyron M. Woo S.L. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1735-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Isolated bone marrow cells were cultured in suspension for 1 day in the presence of 10 ng/ml interleukin-3 (Peprotech) to facilitate retroviral transduction. Cells were collected and resuspended in retrovirus-BMDM medium supplemented with 10 ng/ml interleukin-3, 50 ng/ml CSF-1, and 8 μg/ml polybrene. 3-4 × 106 cells/1.5-ml volume were distributed in each well of a non-adherent 6-well plate (Evergreen Scientific, Los Angeles, CA). For spin-culture-infection, plates were centrifuged for 90 min at 820 × g at 32 °C. Thereafter, 1.5 ml of medium supplemented with interleukin-3 and CSF-1 was added. At day 5, transduced suspension cells were harvested and seeded on tissue-culture dishes in BMDM-medium, which was exchanged 1 day later. Experiments were performed at day 8 after preparation with differentiated BMDM characterized as described above. Transduction efficiency was confirmed by GFP control virus and was in the range of 60-80%. Real-time PCR—with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) was performed using Rac1 primers (forward primer, 5′-GCA TTT CCT GGA GAG TAC ATC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TGT GTC CCA TAG GCC CAG-3′) and cDNA of NIH 3T3 cells. The specificity and the optimal primer concentrations were tested. The absence of nonspecific amplification was confirmed by analyzing the PCR products on a 3.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. Potential genomic DNA contamination was excluded by performing PCR reactions with specific intron-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers. 40 PCR cycles were performed, and the Ct (cycle threshold) values were normalized to the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. shRNA Constructs—The retroviral pMX-IRES-GFP (36Nosaka T. Kawashima T. Misawa K. Ikuta K. Mui A.L. Kitamura T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4754-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 37Paddison P.J. Caudy A.A. Bernstein E. Hannon G.J. Conklin D.S. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 948-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar) construct was converted into a destination vector according to the Gateway technology (Invitrogen) by introducing a ‘reading frame cassette B’ into the SnaBI site to generate pMX-DEST-IRES-GFP. Five different shRNA constructs targeting Rac1 (shRac1) were cloned by PCR using reverse primers containing a portion that anneals to the 3′ end of the human U6 promoter and the specific hairpin sequence flanked by attB1. The forward primer contained the attB2 site and a portion that anneals to the 5′ end of the U6 promoter (5′-GGG GAC CAC TTT GTA CAA GAA AGC TGG GT CCC GAG TCC AAC ACC CGT GG-3′). A vector containing the U6 promoter was used as a template for PCR amplification. Recombination of the attB2-U6-shRac1-attB1-PCR product with the donor vector pDONR221 containing attP sites created an entry clone. Recombination of the entry clone with the designed destination vector pMX-DEST-IRES-GFP generated pMX-DEST-shRac1 constructs. All pMX-DEST-shRac1 constructs were tested for functionality regarding Rac1 silencing by real-time PCR analysis, and NIH 3T3 total cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblot with Rac antibody (data not shown). The most efficacious suppression was detected with the construct pMX-DEST-shRac1.3 (within text Rac1 shRNA) using the following primer: 5′-GGG GAC AAG TTT GTA CAA AAA AGC AGG CTA AAA AAG ACA GAC GTG TTC TTA ATT TGA AGC TTG AAA TTA AGA ACA CGT CTG TCT CGG TGT TTC GTC CTT TCC ACA-3′. Note that the selected interfering sequence (underlined) is specific for Rac1 and does not recognize any known related mouse gene. As a control, we used the construct pMX-DEST-mismatch shRac1 using the following primer: 5′-GGG GAC AAG TTT GTA C A AAA AAG CAG GCT AAA AAA ATA CAT CCC CAC TGT ATT TGG AAG CTT GCA AAT ACA GTG GGG ATG TAT TCG GTG TTT CGT CCT TTC CAC A-3′. Constructs were sequenced twice in the two directions for corroborating the sequence. PCR reactions were performed using Pwo DNA-polymerase (Roche). Time-lapse Videomicroscopy—Glass-bottomed plates (6 cm; Milian) were coated overnight with 2 μg/ml Vitronectin. Day-5 BMDM were seeded in L929-free 10% fetal bovine serum containing medium; 15 min after adherence, they were stimulated with a point source of chemokine (femtojet). Live cells were imaged every 12 s during stimulation from the micropipette containing 2 mm RANTES (Zeiss microscope). The recorded data were used for analysis of macrophage migration using openlab software. RANTES-induced Rac Activation Significantly Depends on PI3K Activity—We investigated whether RANTES is able to activate Rac and, if so, whether Rac is a target of PI3K. To compare the specificity of GPCR-versus RTK-signaling regarding PI3K isoform engagement, we investigated the RTK ligand CSF-1 in parallel. BMDM were stimulated with RANTES or CSF-1 for the indicated times, and activation of Rac was investigated using the PAK-PBD binding assay to precipitate RacGTP. Different concentrations and timing for RANTES-induced Rac activation were tested, and submaximal doses with respect to Rac activation and optimal timing were used. Stimulation by RANTES led to a rapid and transient activation of Rac, which was partially inhibited by LY294002 (Fig. 1, A and D, left). In contrast, no activation was detected in response to CSF-1 within the same experiment (see also Fig. 5C for value at 10 s). Activation of Rac peaked at 10 s, followed by a very rapid decrease in levels of active GTPase (see also Fig. 3A). Because semiquantitative PCR analysis showed that BMDM expresses the Rac1 and Rac2 isoforms but not Rac3 (data not shown), activated Rac analyzed by immunoblot with the Rac antibody corresponds to the 92% identical Rac1 and Rac2 isoforms. 2Upstate Biotechnology, personal communication. We conclude that stimulation of serum-starved macrophages by RANTES resulted in a very rapid, transient, and partially PI3K-dependent activation of Rac, whereas incubation with CSF-1 under the same conditions was unable to activate Rac.Fig. 5PI3Kγ deficiency has no impact on CSF-1 induced phosphorylation of PAK2Ser-192/197 and AKTSer-473; CSF-1 induced Rac activation relies on serum.A-C, serum-starved WT and PI3Kγ-/- (KO) BMDM were stimulated with 50 ng/ml CSF-1 for the indicated times. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with phosphospecific antibodies recognizing phosphorylation of PAK2Ser-192/197 (A) and of AKTSer-473 (B). Bottom, blots were reprobed with PAK and AKT antibodies respectively. C, as a control for Rac activation, cells were stimulated with 0.8 μm RANTES. Rac activation was analyzed as in Fig. 1 and was activated by RANTES, but not by CSF-1 stimulation. The 10-s value of RANTES-induced Rac activation in WT cells was normalized to an arbitrary value of 100 and compared with the 30 s value of CSF1. Values are mean ± S.E. D, cells were starved in medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum for 4 h, stimulated with 50 ng/ml CSF-1 for the indicated times, and Rac activation was monitored. Bottom, equal Rac content in lysates was confirmed in each experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Impaired RANTES-mediated Rac, PAK2, and AKT activation in PI3Kγ-/- macrophages. Starved WT and PI3Kγ-/- (KO) BMDM were stimulated with 0.8 μm RANTES for 10 s, 30 s, 1 min, and 3 min. Cell lysates were analyzed as described in Fig. 1. A, PAK-PBD affinity precipitation shows reduced Rac activation in KO cells. Bottom, equal Rac expression is demonstrated. B, three separate experiments under equal conditions were quantified by densitometry. The 10-s value of RANTES-induced Rac activation in WT cells was normalized to an arbitrary value of 100.

The 20-s value of RANTES-induced Rac activation in WT cells was normalized to an arbitrary value of 100. Values are mean ± S.E. In more concentrated lysates, phosphorylation of PAK2Ser/Thr was still detectable after 1-min RANTES stimulation (Fig. 4, C and D). E, autoradiograph and quantification of PAK in-gel kinase assay.

Values are mean ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Rac Activation Correlates with PAK2Ser-192/197 Phosphorylation and PAK2 Activity—Subsequently we examined whether the observed partial PI3K-dependent activation of Rac by RANTES is correlated with an activation of PAK. The Ser/Thr kinase PAK is activated in a multistep process, including steps such as binding to RacGTP and autophosphorylation of threonine (PAKThr) and serine (PAKSer) residues to establish and maintain the catalytically active state (38Chong C. Tan L. Lim L. Manser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17347-17353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 39Lei M. Lu W. Meng W. Parrini M.C. Eck M.J. Mayer B.J. Harrison S.C. Cell. 2000; 102: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). We analyzed PAKSer phosphorylation by immunoblot with a phospho-PAKSer antibody. BMDM were stimulated with RANTES and CSF-1 for the indicated time points, and total cell lysates were analyzed. RANTES rapidly and transiently triggered phosphorylation of PAK2Ser-192/197 (Fig. 1, B and D, middle). As seen for Rac activation, this phosphorylation of PAK2Ser-192/197 was partially inhibited by LY294002. In contrast, CSF-1 was unable to induce Rac and PAK activation (Fig. 1, A and B, right). Nevertheless, phosphorylation of AKT confirmed that CSF-1 signaling to PI3K was intact (Fig. 1C). Within the shown time window, RANTES and CSF-1 both triggered phosphorylation of AKTSer-473 to a similar extent. This phosphorylation was completely blocked by LY294002 (Fig. 1, C and D, right). In contrast to Rac and PAK activation, LY294002 also reduced basal levels of AKTSer-473 phosphorylation (data not shown). To determine the kinase activity of PAK2, we used an in-gel kinase assay together with a PAK-specific peptide substrate derived from p47Phox (28Huang R. Lian J.P. Robinson D. Badwey J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7130-7138Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Recombinant PAK2 (500 ng) confirmed the identification of the PAK2 isoform activated in response to RANTES stimulation based on activity and gel motility (59 and 62 kDa; Fig. 1E, left lane). We observed a rapid and transient activation of PAK2 in BMDM treated with RANTES (Fig. 1E). PAK2 exhibited maximal activation within 10 s to 1 min of RANTES stimulation (see also Fig. 3E), followed by significant loss of activation at 3 min. In correlation with the inhibition of PAK2Ser-192/197 phosphorylation, LY294002 partially inhibited RANTES-induced PAK2 activation. We conclude that RANTES activated PAK2 in a class I PI3K-dependent manner and that this activation correlated with Rac activation. CSF-1 Promotes PAK2Ser-192/197 Phosphorylation but Not Rac Activation—GPCRs often operate instantly upon ligand binding, whereas RTKs require dimerization and subsequent recruitment of effectors (40Thelen M. Baggiolini M. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2001/104/pe34)PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether RANTES and CSF-1 differed only with respect to t"
https://openalex.org/W2154861643,"Given the recent demonstration that oleoylethanolamide (OEA), a cannabinoid receptor-inactive N-acylethanolamine, decreases food intake by activating the nuclear receptor PPARalpha (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha) in the periphery, we here evaluated the effects of both saturated and unsaturated C18 N-acylethanolamides (C18:0; C18:1; C18:2) in mice feeding behavior after overnight starvation. Our results show stearoylethanolamide (SEA, C18:0) exerts, unlike other unsaturated C18 homologs, a marked dose-dependent anorexic effect evident already at 2 h after its intraperitoneal administration. In addition, oral administration of SEA (25 mg/kg) was also effective in reducing food consumption, an effect ascribed to the molecule itself and not to its catabolites. Moreover, although the anorexic response to oral administered SEA was not associated with changes in the levels of various hematochemical parameters (e.g., glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, leptin) nor in liver mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) including PPARalpha, the anorexic effect of SEA was interestingly accompanied by a reduction in liver stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) mRNA expression. As SCD-1 has been recently proposed as a molecular target for the treatment of obesity, the novel observation provided here that SEA reduces food intake in mice in a structurally selective manner, in turn, correlated with downregulation of liver SCD-1 mRNA expression, has the potential of providing new insights on a class of lipid mediators with suitable properties for the pharmacological treatment of over-eating dysfunctions."

The mammalian BMP-1-related proteinases are all capable of activating the TGF-β-like protein growth differentiation factor 8 (also known as myostatin), by freeing it from a non-covalent latent complex with its cleaved prodomain (25Wolfman N.

Thus, BMP-1-like proteinases may orchestrate formation of the ECM with signaling by various TGF-β-like proteins in morphogenetic and homeostatic events. The small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) constitute a small family of secreted proteoglycans/glycoproteins with structurally related core proteins, with 11 members in mammals (26Iozzo R.V. Annu.

SLRP core proteins contain a central domain consisting of 6–12 tandem leucine-rich repeats, and flanking NH2- and COOH-terminal domains containing characteristic cysteine clusters. The SLRPs can be divided into three subclasses, based on the intron/exon organization of cognate genes, spacing of the four cysteine residues in NH2-terminal regions, and the number of leucine-rich repeats in the central domains. Class I comprises the chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chain-containing proteoglycans decorin and biglycan, and the glycoprotein asporin; class II comprises the keratan sulfate chain-containing proteoglycans fibromodulin, lumican, keratocan, and osteoadherin, and the glycoprotein PRELP; and class III consists of osteoglycin (also known as mimecan) and epiphycan, both of which carry a glycosaminoglycan chain, and the glycoprotein opticin. Whereas evidence is lacking for processing of precursors to mature forms of class II SLRPs, biglycan is cleaved from a precursor to the mature protein by BMP-1-related proteinases, in vitro and in vivo (31Scott I.C. Imamura Y. Pappano W.N. Troedel J.M. Recklies A.D. Roughley P.J. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30504-30511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Because biglycan appears to be a positive regulator of bone growth (32Xu T. Bianco P. Fisher L.W. Longenecker G. Smith E. Goldstein S. Bonadio J. Boskey A. Heegaard A.-M. Sommer B. Satomura K.

Interestingly, the two class III SLRPs, osteoglycin (OGN) (33Funderburgh J.L. Corpuz L.M. Roth M.R. Funderburgh M.L. Tasheva E.S. Conrad G.W. J. Biol.

Epiphycan, also known as PG-Lb, is localized to the ECM of growth plate chondrocytes and may play structural and/or instructional roles in the integrity and development of this tissue (34Johnson H.K.

Here we extend the known range of substrates in general and of SLRP substrates in particular of the BMP-1-like proteinases, by demonstrating that such proteinases play roles in biosynthetic processing of the class III SLRP OGN. Moreover, cleavage by these proteinases is shown to affect the ability of OGN to regulate the fibrillogenesis of type I collagen. Pro-OGN Expression Vector—An 897-bp cDNA fragment encoding full-length pro-OGN was amplified by PCR using an EST clone, image number 5067073 (ATCC), as a template, Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and two primers, 5′-CGGGATCCATGGAGACTGTGCACTCTACATTTCTC-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCCTTAGAAGTATGACCCTATGGGTAATC-3′. Use of these primers created a BamHI site at the 5′ end and an EcoRI site at the 3′ end of the fragment (restriction site sequences are in boldface), which was inserted between BamHI and EcoRI sites of pBluescript II SK(+) (Stratagene). The full-length pro-OGN cDNA was then used as a template for PCR amplification of full-length pro-OGN sequences to which a His6 tag was fused via a thrombin cleavage site to the NH2 terminus. Primers were 5′-CGCGGATCCTCACCATCATCACCATCACCTGGTTCCGCGTGGATCTGCACCACAGTCGCAGCTGGAC-3′ and 5′-GGAATTCCTTAGAAGTATGACCCTATGGGTAATC-3′. These added a BamHI site to the 5′ end and an EcoRI site to the 3′ end (restriction site sequences are in boldface) of the amplified fragment, which was inserted between BamHI and EcoRI sites of pAcGP67-A (BD Pharmingen). Predicted sequences of the resulting expression vector, pOGN, were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by IDT, Inc. Insect Cell Culture—Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (Sf9) cells (obtained from Dr. Mary Estes, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) were grown and maintained on Grace's insect cell medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-products), lactalbumin hydrolysate (3.33 mg/liter), yeastolate (3.33 mg/liter), and l-glutamine. Spinner cultures were started at an initial density of 5 × 105 cells/ml with stirring at 80–90 rpm. The spinner cultures were subcultured when the cell density reached ∼3 × 106 cells/ml. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Pro-OGN—Monolayers of exponentially growing Sf9 insect cells (2 × 106 cells in a 60-mm plate) were co-transfected with 5 μg of transfer vector pOGN and 0.5 μg of linearized BaculoGold virus DNA (BD Pharmingen) in transfection buffer (BD Pharmingen). Recombinant baculoviruses, vOGN, were selected and purified three times by plaque assay. Positive colonies were confirmed by purification of secreted pro-OGN and identification via Western blot using affinity purified polyclonal rabbit antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide derived from the COOH-terminal region of murine OGN (amino acid 255–298). Positive colonies were used to propagate high titer stocks (108–109 plaque forming units/ml), which were stored at 4 °C. For a scale-up of protein production, Sf9 insect cells were maintained in spinner flasks (Bellco Glass, Inc.) and the recombinant vOGN virus stocks were used at a multiplicity of infection of 10 to infect Sf9 insect cells at a density of 3 × 106 cells/ml. At 1 h post-infection, recombinant virus-infected cells were harvested and resuspended in serum-free medium (BD Pharmingen). At 96 h post-infection conditioned medium was collected, centrifuged, and filtered using a 0.2-μm membrane filter. The supernatant was then applied to the Labscale TFF system (Millipore, Co.) with the Pellicon XL module (Biomax 10) for concentration of the sample volume and buffer change to 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The sample was then applied to a 5-ml High Trap metal chelating column charged with Ni2+ (Amersham Biosciences), which was washed with 30 mm imidazole buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.02% CHAPS, after which bound protein was eluted from the resin with the same buffer containing 100 mm imidazole. Eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the peak fractions were pooled and concentrated by Centricon-10 spin columns (Amicon). The mass of purified protein was determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Tufts University, Protein chemistry facility). Prior to analysis the proteins were dialyzed into 10 mm NH4HCO3. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE was performed with 10 (Figs. 1 and 2), 15 (Figs. 4 and 5), and 12% (Fig. 6) polyacrylamide gels with 4% stacking gels and the Laemmli buffer system (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). For Western blots, proteins separated on SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with affinity purified polyclonal rabbit antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide derived from the COOH-terminal region of murine OGN (amino acids 255–298). Horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit affinity purified immunoglobulin G (heavy and light chains) (Bio-Rad) was used as the secondary antibody, and SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) was used for signal detection. Prestained broad-range marker proteins (Bio-Rad) were used as molecular mass standards. A monoclonal mouse antibody (anti-Penta His, Qiagen) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse affinity purified immunoglobulin G (Bio-Rad) were used as first and secondary antibodies, respectively, for detecting the recombinant pro-OGN His tag.Fig. 2Mass spectrometry and peptide N-glycosidase F digestion of recombinant OGN.A, the mass of recombinant OGN, dialyzed overnight against 10 mm NH4HCO3 at 4 °C, was determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. B, recombinant OGN was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining without further treatment (lane 2) or after incubation with peptide N-glycosidase F (lane 3).

Immunoblots employed either antibodies directed against the NH2-terminal His tag (α His), or antibodies directed against sequences within mature OGN (α OGN). α His antibodies detected only 39-kDa pro-OGN, whereas α OGN antibodies detected both 39-kDa pro-OGN and the 27-kDa OGN cleavage product.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 6Absence of proteolytic processing of pro-OGN in cultures of MEF from embryos doubly homozygous null for the Bmp1 and Tll1 genes. Western blot analysis was employed, using antibodies specific for sequences within the mature region of OGN, to monitor pro-OGN processing within cultures of wild-type (WT) MEF or MEF doubly homozygous null (Bmp1/Tll1 null) for the Bmp1 and Tll1 genes. Cultures were either treated (+) or not treated (–) with 2 ng/ml TGF-β. α OGN antibodies detected the 39-kDa pro-OGN and the 27-kDa OGN cleavage products in TGF-β-treated WT MEF cultures, but only detected 39-kDa pro-OGN in TGF-β-treated Bmp1/Tll1 null MEF cultures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Peptide N-glycosidase F Digestion—Purified recombinant pro-OGN was denatured with 0.5% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol for 10 min at 100 °C and was then treated with 25 units of peptide N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs) in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40 at 37 °C for 16 h. After incubation, samples were immediately subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Thrombin Cleavage and Purification of Non-tagged Pro-OGN—Purified recombinant pro-OGN was treated with 1 unit of biotinylated thrombin (Novagen) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm CaCl2 at room temperature for 16 h. After incubation, samples were sequentially subjected to streptavidin-agarose column and Ni2+-charged metal chelating column chromatography to remove the biotinylated thrombin and the cleaved His tag, respectively. Cleavage of the His6 tag was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis, using anti-His antibody. Prior to use in experiments non-tagged proteins were dialyzed into phosphate-buffered saline. Collagen Fibrillogenesis Assay—Fibrillogenesis assays were performed as described previously (38Birk D.E. Silver F.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 235: 178-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, at 4 °C, stock solutions (1–2 mg ml–1) of bovine dermal type I collagen (VITROGEN, Palo Alto, CA) were neutralized with 10× phosphate-buffered saline and brought to a concentration of 0.5 mg ml–1 with 1× phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2. Recombinant protein was added to aliquots of the mixture at 1–60 μg ml–1, samples were transferred to a 96-well plate in a SpectraMax Plus 384 Microplate Spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices Co.), and assays were performed at 37 °C. In Vitro Enzyme Assays—500 ng of recombinant pro-OGN was incubated alone or in combination with 15 ng of recombinant BMP-1, mTLD, mTLL-1, or mTLL-2, containing COOH-terminal FLAG epitopes, in 20 μl total volume of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, and incubated 20 h at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by addition of 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) containing 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and boiling of samples for 5 min. 50 ng of proteins per sample were subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequent Western blot analysis, as described above. Amino Acid Sequence Analysis—2 μg of purified recombinant pro-OGN was incubated with 50 ng of BMP-1 at 37 °C for 20 h, and the reaction was quenched and prepared for SDS-PAGE as above. Products were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 12% polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred to Sequi-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (BioRad). Proteins were revealed with 0.025% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and NH2-terminal amino acid sequences were determined by automated Edman degradation at the Harvard University Microchemistry Facility using a PerkinElmer/Applied Biosystems Division Procise 494 HT Protein Sequencing System. Mouse Embryo Fibroblasts (MEFs)—MEFs were isolated from 13.5-day post-conception embryos as previously described (8Suzuki N. Labosky P.A. Furuta Y. Hargett L. Dunn R. Fogo A.B. Takahara K. Peters D.M. Greenspan D.S. Hogan B.L. Development. 1996; 122: 3587-3595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in growth medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 1 mm L-glutamine, 10 IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum, and were immortalized by routine serial passage. To detect endogenous OGN protein in MEFs, wild-type or Bmp1/Tll1 doubly homozygous null cells at 80% confluence were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were then treated with or without 2 ng/ml TGF-β1 (R&D Systems) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 48 h. Proteins in conditioned media were ethanol precipitated and resuspended in 0.5% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol. Deglycosylation of precipitated media proteins with β1→4 galactosidase was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Sigma). Expression, Purification, and Characterization of Recombinant OGN—The murine full-length pre-OGN protein contains 298 amino acid residues that include a signal peptide, six cysteine residues; four within the NH2- and two within the COOH-terminal domains, respectively; six leucine-rich repeats in the central domain, and a single potential N-glycosylation site at amino acid residue 258 (Fig. 1A). To generate recombinant OGN using a baculovirus expression system, a transfer vector, pOGN, was constructed using a cDNA encoding the core protein of murine OGN, such that a fusion protein would be produced corresponding to the acidic glycoprotein gp67 signal sequence, followed by six consecutive histidine residues, a thrombin cleavage site, and the full OGN coding sequence (Fig. 1B). Recombinant baculovirus vOGN was then generated by homologous recombination between transfer vector pOGN and linearized baculoGold virus DNA. Sf9 cells infected with vOGN were incubated in serum-free medium and 96 h later culture medium was harvested and recombinant His-tagged protein was purified by a single passage over a nickel chelating column. The concentration of purified samples was estimated using the theoretical molar extinction coefficient (39Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 1C). Recombinant protein was predominantly eluted from the nickel column at 100 mm imidazole and no contaminating protein bands were visualized in this fraction via SDS-PAGE, indicating a high degree of purity for the sample. The yield of recombinant OGN was ∼5 mg/3.5 × 109 cells per 96 h. Identity of the recombinant protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1D) using a polyclonal antiserum specific for mouse OGN, with detection of a single band of recombinant OGN (Fig. 1D, lane 3), and no signal detected from samples derived from uninfected control cells (Fig. 1D, lane 1) or from control cells infected with wild-type baculovirus AcNMPV (Fig. 1D, lane 2). Recombinant OGN appeared on SDS-PAGE, under reducing conditions as a single ∼39-kDa band (Figs. 1C and 2), whereas the expected mass of murine OGN is 33,245 Da, based on the primary amino acid sequence. MALDI-TOF MS yielded a peak with a mass of 34,557 Da for recombinant OGN (Fig. 2A). One possible explanation for the mass difference between MALDI-TOF MS results and the expected mass might have been glycosylation of recombinant OGN with the N-linked high mannose oligosaccharides characteristic of insect cells. To test this possibility, recombinant OGN was incubated with peptide N-glycosidase F, which cleaves between the innermost N-acetylglucosamine and asparagine residues of N-linked high mannose oligosaccharides. Upon enzyme digestion, OGN protein underwent a shift to a higher mobility form (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 3). Thus, the re"
https://openalex.org/W1981540068,"We recently reported that CD47 (integrin-associated protein) on sickle red blood cells (SS RBCs) activates G-protein-dependent signaling, which promotes cell adhesion to immobilized thrombospondin (TSP) under relevant shear stress. These data suggested that signal transduction in SS RBCs may contribute to the vaso-occlusive pathology observed in sickle cell disease. However, the CD47-activated SS RBC adhesion receptor(s) that mediated adhesion to immobilized TSP remained unknown. Here we demonstrate that the α4β1 integrin (VLA-4) is the receptor that mediates CD47-stimulated SS RBC adhesion to immobilized TSP. This adhesion requires both the N-terminal heparin-binding domain and the RGD site of TSP. CD47 signaling induces an “inside-out” activation of α4β1 on SS RBCs as indicated by an RGD-dependent interaction of this integrin with soluble, plasma fibronectin. However, CD47 engagement also induces an α4β1-mediated, RGD-independent adhesion of SS RBCs to immobilized vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). CD47 signaling in SS RBCs appears to be independent of large scale changes in cAMP formation but nonetheless promotes α4β1-mediated adhesion via a protein kinase A-dependent, serine phosphorylation of the α4 cytoplasmic domain. CD47-activated SS RBC adhesion absolutely requires the Src family tyrosine kinases and is also enhanced by treatment of SS RBCs with low concentrations of cytochalasin D, which may release α4β1 from cytoskeletal restraints. In addition, CD47 co-immunoprecipitates with α4β1 in a sickle reticulocyte-enriched fraction of SS RBCs. These studies therefore identify the α4β1 integrin on SS RBCs as a CD47-activated receptor for TSP, VCAM-1, and plasma fibronectin, revealing novel binding characteristics of this integrin.

Sheridan J. Mould A.P. Newham P. CIBA Found. Symp. 1995; 189: 177-191PubMed Google Scholar); these interactions are widely assumed to play an important role in leukocyte physiology (2Rose D.M. Han J. Ginsberg M.H. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 186: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and blood cell maturation (3Coulombel L. Auffray I. Gaugler M.H. Rosemblatt M.

Unlike many integrins, α4β1 binds to these ligands in an RGD-independent manner (6Ager A. Humphries M.J. Chem. Immunol. 1991; 50: 55-74PubMed Google Scholar, 7Clements J.M. Newham P. Shepherd M.

Clements J. Edwards M. Humphries M.J. Mould A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4005-4011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this integrin can also interact with Fn in an RGD-dependent manner (9Sanchez-Aparicio P. Dominguez-Jimenez C. Garcia-Pardo A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The α4β1 integrin is suspected to assume multiple “activation” states (10Chigaev A. Blenc A.M. Braaten J.V. Kumaraswamy N. Kepley C.L. Andrews R.P. Oliver J.M. Edwards B.S. Prossnitz E.R. Larson R.S. Sklar L.A. J. Biol.

J. 2003; 85: 3951-3962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Consistent with our expanding knowledge of integrin physiology, the activation state of α4β1 may be regulated by several factors, including divalent cation concentration and agonist-induced “inside-out” cell signaling (12Liu S. Thomas S.M. Woodside D.G. Rose D.M. Kiosses W.B. Pfaff M. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 13Han J. Rose D.M. Woodside D.G. Goldfinger L.E. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34845-34853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), which could induce the conversion of α4β1 to an active conformation. Recently, the α4 cytoplasmic domain has been demonstrated to be directly phosphorylated in vitro by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) (14Goldfinger L.E. Han J. Kiosses W.B. Howe A.K. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), suggesting that activation of PKA could impact the activation state of α4β1. Activation of α4β1, as with other integrins, may also confer the ability of this integrin to bind additional ligands. For instance, although α4β1 is not a well characterized thrombospondin (TSP) receptor, an activated form of α4β1 has been reported to bind TSP in the N-terminal heparin binding region of TSP (15Li Z. Calzada M.J. Sipes J.M. Cashel J.A. Krutzsch H.C. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Roberts D.D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 16Barazi H.O. Li Z. Cashel J.A.

However, a requirement for the RGD sequence in any mechanism of active α4β1 binding to any ligand has never been demonstrated. Regulation of α4β1 activation in vivo may promote leukocyte adhesion (2Rose D.M. Han J. Ginsberg M.H. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 186: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Likewise, a pathological role for this integrin receptor is being realized in SS RBC adhesion in sickle cell disease (SCD) (17Wick T.M. Eckman J.R. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 1996; 3: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18Parise L.V. Telen M.J. Curr. Hematol. Rep. 2003; 2: 102-108PubMed Google Scholar). SS RBCs are typically two to ten times more adherent than normal RBCs (19Hebbel R.P. Boogaerts M.A. Eaton J.W. Steinberg M.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1980; 302: 992-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 20Hebbel R.P. Yamada O. Moldow C.F. Jacob H.S. White J.G. Eaton J.W. J. Clin. Investig. 1980; 65: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and may impair blood flow in SCD by adhering to factors that line the blood vessel wall or circulate in plasma (18Parise L.V. Telen M.J. Curr. Hematol. Rep. 2003; 2: 102-108PubMed Google Scholar). SS RBC adhesion to the α4β1 ligands TSP, VCAM-1, and Fn or other factors in the vasculature may dramatically impact vaso-occlusion. Either soluble TSP, which is abnormally elevated in the plasma of SCD patients (21Browne P.V. Mosher D.F. Steinberg M.H. Hebbel R.P. Am. J. Hematol. 1996; 51: 296-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), or soluble Fn may serve as a “tether” to anchor circulating SS RBCs to vascular endothelium (22Brittain H.A. Eckman J.R. Swerlick R.A. Howard R.J. Wick T.M. Blood. 1993; 81: 2137-2143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Sugihara K. Sugihara T. Mohandas N. Hebbel R.P. Blood. 1992; 80: 2634-2642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), monocytes (24Hebbel R.P. Schwartz R.S. Mohandas N. Clin. Haematol. 1985; 14: 141-161PubMed Google Scholar), and platelets (25Wun T. Paglieroni T. Tablin F. Welborn J. Nelson K. Cheung A. J. Lab Clin. Med. 1997; 129: 507-516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). TSP is also present in the subendothelial matrix and is exposed to flowing blood at sites of vascular injury. This exposed TSP potentially serves to anchor SS RBCs to the vascular wall. The resulting adhesion of SS RBCs to the endothelium and/or vascular proteins in the blood vessel is likely to slow or stop blood flow. Furthermore, the in vitro adhesivity of an SCD patient's cells has been positively correlated to the severity of their disease (26Hebbel R.P. Boogaerts M.A. Koresawa S. Jacob H.S. Eaton J.W. Steinberg M.H. Trans. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1980; 93: 94-99PubMed Google Scholar). In an effort to better understand the mechanism(s) of SS RBC interaction with the matrix and plasma molecule TSP, we recently identified CD47, a known receptor for soluble TSP, as a potent signaling receptor on SS RBCs that upon engagement by soluble TSP, activates intracellular signaling events, resulting in SS RBC adhesion to immobilized TSP markedly above basal levels (27Brittain J.E. Mlinar K.J. Anderson C.S. Orringer E.P. Parise L.V. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 1555-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These results pointed to a novel mechanism of activated, agonist-induced SS RBC adhesion to TSP and potentially other vascular proteins. However, the CD47-activated adhesion receptor on SS RBCs that mediates this stimulated adhesion to immobilized TSP remained unknown. Classically, CD47 associates with integrins and activates integrin-dependent adhesion in other hematopoietic cells (28Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 130-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). In platelets, CD47 co-immunoprecipitates with and activates both integrin αIIbβ3 (29Chung J. Gao A.G. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14740-14746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and α2β1 (30Chung J. Wang X.Q. Lindberg F.P. Frazier W.A. Blood. 1999; 94: 642-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In other cell lines, CD47 activates integrins αvβ3 and α4β1 (15Li Z. Calzada M.J. Sipes J.M. Cashel J.A. Krutzsch H.C. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Roberts D.D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 31Green J.M. Zhelesnyak A. Chung J. Lindberg F.P. Sarfati M. Frazier W.A. Brown E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Although circulating mature erythrocytes have lost integrin expression, we and others have shown that α4β1 expression persists and is the only integrin present on circulating immature sickle RBCs (32Swerlick R.A. Eckman J.R. Kumar A. Jeitler M. Wick T.M. Blood. 1993; 82: 1891-1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Joneckis C.C. Ackley R.L. Orringer E.P. Wayner E.A. Parise L.V. Blood. 1993; 82: 3548-3555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, SS RBCs provide an excellent model to unravel α4β1 biochemistry, as these cells allow for the isolated study of this integrin in an abundant, pathophysiologically relevant system. We have demonstrated that the reticulocyte population of circulating SS RBCs is the most responsive to CD47-stimulated adhesion to TSP (27Brittain J.E. Mlinar K.J. Anderson C.S. Orringer E.P. Parise L.V. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 1555-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Other studies have demonstrated that increased reticulocyte count correlates with SCD severity (34Ballas S.K. Am. J. Hematol. 1991; 36: 122-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar); therefore, the combination of increased soluble TSP levels, reticulocytosis, and the capacity of CD47 to initiate signaling in SS RBCs could provide a potent mechanism through which SS RBC adhesion could promote vaso-occlusion in vivo. Given the unrealized binding and activation potential of α4β1 on SS RBCs, we asked whether this integrin was the unknown receptor for immobilized TSP. We now show that α4β1 is the TSP receptor that becomes activated upon CD47-induced stimulation of SS RBCs. Furthermore, the CD47-activated α4β1 on these cells exhibits an unusual combination of adhesive properties by requiring both the N-terminal domain of TSP as well as the more C-terminal RGD site in this molecule. CD47-activated α4β1 on SS RBCs also recognizes soluble Fn in an RGD-dependent manner. However, CD47 signaling promotes SS RBC adhesion to immobilized VCAM-1 in an RGD-independent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CD47 and α4β1 are complexed on the surface of SS RBCs and that efficient α4β1-mediated adhesion, as with several other integrins (35Bennett J.S. Zigmond S. Vilaire G. Cunningham M.E. Bednar B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25301-25307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 36Wang J. Chen H. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14474-14481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), requires cytoskeletal remodeling. We have elucidated part of the mechanism of CD47-induced, α4β1-mediated adhesion and integrin activation in these cells and show that CD47-mediated activation of α4β1 requires a PKA-dependent phosphorylation of the α4 cytoplasmic domain that occurs without a measurable increase in cAMP above basal levels. The activation of α4β1 is also dependent on the activity of the large G-protein Gi, but may be mediated by Gi activation of the Src family of tyrosine kinases rather than by a direct coupling of Gi to adenylyl cyclase. Taken together, our results further reinforce the importance of α4β1 as a therapeutic target in SCD. Reagents—Human purified recombinant VCAM-1 was obtained from R&D Biosciences (Raleigh, NC), purified platelet TSP was from Sigma, and purified plasma Fn was from Invitrogen. The anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody, IF7, was a generous gift from Dr. Eric Brown, University of California, San Francisco (37Brown E. Hooper L. Ho T. Gresham H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2785-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The hybridoma for B6H12 was obtained from ATCC, and B6H12 was purified from cell culture supernatant by an Immunopure® (G) IgG purification kit (Pierce). Antibodies against the α4 and β1 integrin subunits and Fn were obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). The conformationally specific antibodies against TSP were obtained as follows. The M1A antibody was a generous gift from Jack Lawler (Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School), and the D4.6 antibody against TSP was purchased from Labvision (Fremont, CA). The monoclonal antibody against TSP, C6.7, was purchased from Labvision. TSP peptides 4N1K (kRFYVVMWKk) and control 4NGG (kRFYGGMWKk) were synthesized and high pressure liquid chromatography-purified by the University of North Carolina (UNC)-Chapel Hill Protein Chemistry Laboratory. In this work, either RGDS (the native sequence in Fn), RGDA (the native sequence in TSP), or RGDW peptides were used interchangeably and were purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA) or synthesized at the University of North Carolina as described above. The results from either of the RGD peptides were the same. Okadaic acid, d-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine chloromethyl ketone, cytochalasin D, PP2, forskolin, PKAI were obtained from Calbiochem. The NoC1 peptide was a generous gift from Dr. Dean Mosher, University of Wisconsin at Madison. The α-PS α4 monoclonal antibody was provided by co-author Dr. J. Han. Unless otherwise indicated, all other reagents were obtained from Sigma. RBC Preparation—Sickle RBCs were obtained from homozygous sickle cell patients with informed consent during routine clinic visits to the University of North Carolina Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center. All studies with human subjects followed the guidelines of the UNC-Chapel Hill institutional review board and the tenets of the Helsinki protocol. All blood samples were drawn by venipuncture into 0.13 m sodium citrate and processed immediately by centrifugation at 150 × g for 15 min at ambient temperature to isolate RBCs from plasma and platelets. RBCs were then washed three times in CGS (1.29 mm sodium citrate, 3.33 mm glucose, 124 mm NaCl, pH = 7.2). For flow adhesion assays, a 1% hematocrit was then prepared by diluting 30 μl of packed RBCs in 1.5 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.3% bovine serum albumin (Serologicals, Kankakee, IL) and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Flow Adhesion Assay and Protein Immobilization—The flow adhesion system used for this study was designed to mimic blood flow through postcapillary venules as described previously (38Joneckis C.C. Shock D.D. Cunningham M.L. Orringer E.P. Parise L.V. Blood. 1996; 87: 4862-4870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, purified TSP (18.75 ng/ml), VCAM-1 (50 μg/ml), or the NoC1 peptide (50 μg/ml) in perfusion medium was immobilized onto identical wells formed by a silicon gasket in a 35-mm polystyrene culture dish by incubating for 2 h at 37 °C. A 1% hematocrit solution (1.5 ml) was flowed over the wells at a rate of 1.0 ml/min and a constant shear stress of 1 dyne/cm2. After a wash period of ∼4 min, the number of adherent cells from four representative areas of the well were counted using direct light microscopy. The counted cells were then averaged and presented as adherent cells/mm2. Density Fractionation of SS RBCs—Reticulocyte-enriched fractions of SS RBCs were prepared by centrifuging washed SS RBCs over an arabinogalactan gradient (Larex, St. Paul, MN) (74,000 × g, 20 °C, 45 min). SS RBCs collected from low density fractions were resuspended in perfusion medium and packed at 400 × g for 10 min at ambient temperature. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer as described below. RBC Lysis and Western Blotting—For co-immunoprecipitation studies, fractionated or unfractionated RBCs were lysed for 20 min in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 500 μm EGTA, 100 mm NaVO3, 100 mm NaF, and 1× Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Set III (Calbiochem). The Triton X-100-soluble portion from both samples was incubated overnight at 4 °C with either an anti-CD47 or anti-β1 integrin at 2 μg/ml final concentration followed by incubation for 1 h with protein G-agarose beads (Pierce). Immunoprecipitated proteins were washed three times in lysis buffer, loaded on 4–20% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and blotted with an anti-CD47 mAb, B6H12. For α4 cytoplasmic domain phosphorylation studies, washed SS RBCs were pretreated with 19 ng/ml okadaic acid (37 °C, 120 min), lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.05% Tween 20, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 40 μg/ml bestatin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 mm Pefabloc, 20 mm glycerophosphate, 50 μm sodium vanadate, 1 mm NaF, 10 mmp-nitrophenol phosphate) (39Han J. Liu S. Rose D.M. Schlaepfer D.D. McDonald H. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40903-40909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and incubated as before with an anti-α4 antibody from Chemicon (20 μg/ml) followed by SDS-PAGE and transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were then Western blotted with α-PSα4, a monoclonal antibody raised against the Ser988-phosphorylated form of the cytoplasmic domain of the α4 integrin (14Goldfinger L.E. Han J. Kiosses W.B. Howe A.K. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Determination of cAMP Levels in SS RBCs—cAMP levels in SS RBCs were determined exactly as described previously (40Hines P.C. Zen Q. Burney S.N. Shea D.A. Ataga K.I. Orringer E.P. Telen M.J. Parise L.V. Blood. 2003; 101: 3281-3287Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Conformational Studies with Immobilized TSP—To determine whether the RGD site in TSP is exposed upon protein immobilization, 18.75 ng/ml TSP was allowed to adhere for 2 h at 37 °C in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 2 mm Ca2+ in microtiter wells (Falcon). The wells were washed and then either reduced with β-mercaptoethanol for 1 h at room temperature or maintained in the Ca2+-supplemented Tris-buffered saline. The wells were subjected to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using either the D4.6 antibody or the MA1 antibody at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml followed by anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences, San Francisco, CA). The samples were then developed using TMB substrate (3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine) and read by Spectra Max Plus (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) microplate reader. Immunoprecipitation of TSP from SS Patient Plasma—Sickle cell patient samples were drawn into d-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine chloromethyl ketone anticoagulant to maintain Ca2+ levels, and platelet poor-plasma was obtained by immediate centrifugation at 150 × g to separate platelet-rich plasma from red blood cells and white blood cells. The platelet-rich plasma was then incubated with 40 ng/ml prostaglandin I2 to prevent platelet activation and release and then centrifuged at 200 × g to remove platelets. The TSP antibody D4.6 or C6.7 (1 μg/ml final concentration) was then added to the platelet-poor plasma and incubated for 2 h at room temperature followed by the addition of 30 μl of a 50% slurry of protein G-agarose (Amersham Biosciences). The samples were then incubated for an additional hour at room temperature and centrifuged. Immunoprecipitated proteins were then washed in Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 2 mm Ca2+, reduced, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and Western blotted with the C6.7 antibody against TSP. Determination of Soluble Fn Binding—Freshly drawn, washed SS RBCs were stimulated with 50 μm 4N1K agonist peptide or 4NGG control peptide for 30 min at 37 °C. The red blood cells were then washed by centrifugation to remove residual agonist and incubated with 200 μg/ml human plasma Fn (41Bolarin D.M. Adenuga A.O. Acta Haematol. (Basel). 1986; 75: 209-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 42Emeribe A.O. Udoh A.E. Etukudoh M.H. Okany C.C. Kehinde M. Catty D. Raykundalia C. Br. J. Haematol. 2000; 111: 1194-1197PubMed Google Scholar) for 30 min at 37 °C, washed again, and incubated with an anti-Fn monoclonal antibody for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed and incubated briefly with an anti-mouse R-phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). The cells were washed again and analyzed by flow cytometry. Statistics—The significance of any differences for all treatments studied was determined using a two-tailed Student's t test. Unless otherwise noted, p < 0.001. We reported previously that stimulation of CD47 on SS RBCs induces their adhesion to immobilized TSP. However, the adhesion receptor(s) on SS RBCs that mediated this induced adhesion remained unknown. The α4β1 integrin is expressed on sickle reticulocytes (33Joneckis C.C. Ackley R.L. Orringer E.P. Wayner E.A. Parise L.V. Blood. 1993; 82: 3548-3555Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is thought to partially mediate basal sickle reticulocyte adhesion to vascular endothelial cells via an interaction with VCAM-1 expressed on the endothelial cell (43Wautier J.L. Wautier M.P. Pintigny D. Galacteros F. Courillon A. Passa P. Caen J.P. Blood Cells. 1983; 9: 221-234PubMed Google Scholar). Because CD47 had been demonstrated to stimulate α4β1 function in certain T-cell lines (15Li Z. Calzada M.J. Sipes J.M. Cashel J.A. Krutzsch H.C. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Roberts D.D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), we asked whether this integrin mediated CD47-induced adhesion to immobilized TSP using SS RBCs freshly isolated from SCD patients. We therefore induced SS RBC adhesion to immobilized TSP by treating the SS RBCs with activating ligands for CD47, either soluble TSP or the 4N1K agonist peptide (44Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Finn M.B. Blystone S.D. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), and evaluated stimulated SS RBC adhesion under shear conditions in a flow adhesion assay. Soluble TSP in the presence of an isotype-matched control IgG induced a 3-fold increase in SS RBC adhesion to immobilized TSP. Preincubation with either an α4-blocking mAb or a β1-blocking mAb alone completely inhibited the CD47-stimulated portion of SS RBC adhesion to immobilized TSP (Fig. 1a). Incubation with submaximal concentrations of the α4- and β1-blocking mAbs in combination also completely blocked TSP-stimulated adhesion to TSP (Fig. 1a). These results suggest that each integrin subunit contributed to the stimulated SS RBC adhesion. However, neither antibody alone or in combination had any effect on basal SS RBC adhesion to TSP (data not shown). Similar results as above were obtained when SS RBCs were stimulated with the 4N1K agonist peptide derived from TSP (data not shown). These data implicate a specific role for α4β1 as the integrin on SS RBCs that mediates CD47-stimulated adhesion to immobilized TSP. In myeloid cell lines, CD47-stimulated α4β1 binds to the heparin-binding domain at the N terminus of TSP. We therefore evaluated CD47-stimulated SS RBC adhesion to a peptide derived from the N terminus of TSP termed the NoC1 peptide (15Li Z. Calzada M.J. Sipes J.M. Cashel J.A. Krutzsch H.C. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Roberts D.D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that SS RBCs stimulated with the 4N1K peptide adhered to the NoC1 peptide, and this adhesion could be completely blocked by an α4 or β1 function-blocking antibody but not by a control IgG (Fig. 1b). However, even at saturating concentrations of immobilized NoC1 peptide (Fig. 1b), the degree to which the 4N1K-stimulated SS RBCs adhered was substantially less than the degree to which they adhered to the intact TSP molecule (Fig. 1a), suggesting that the NoC1 peptide could not fully recapitulate SS RBC adhesion to intact TSP. In addition, incubation of CD47-stimulated SS RBCs with soluble NoC1 peptide completely blocked stimulated SS RBC adhesion to intact TSP (Fig. 1a). These results indicate that CD47-stimulated SS RBCs bind at least in part to the sequence of immobilized TSP defined by the NoC1 peptide. An LDV conjugate, representative of a class of inhibitors known to block α4β1 function, failed to inhibit the α4β1-mediated adhesion to either TSP or the NoC1 peptide (Fig. 1, a and b, respectively), even though both TSP and NoC1 contain an LDV sequence that has been implicated in α4β1-mediated adhesion to other ligands (45Wang J. Springer T.A. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 197-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Although α4β1 is typically identified as a non-RGD-binding integrin, α4β1 can mediate RGD-dependent interactions with its ligands (9Sanchez-Aparicio P. Dominguez-Jimenez C. Garcia-Pardo A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, α4β1 is typically identified as a receptor for VCAM-1 and Fn but, when activated, can also bind TSP (46Yabkowitz R. Dixit V.M. Guo N. Roberts D.D. Shimizu Y. J.

We therefore asked whether the CD47-induced increase in SS RBC adhesion to immobilized TSP under shear was also RGD-dependent. We found that an RGD (100 μm), but not a control RGE peptide, completely blocked the TSP-stimulated portion of SS RBC adhesion to immobilized TSP (Fig. 2a, left). Similar results were obtained when SS RBCs were stimulated with the 4N1K agonist peptide (Fig. 2a, right). Because the RGD peptide could potentially interfere with either soluble TSP or 4N1K binding to CD47, we also stimulated SS RBC adhesion to immobilized TSP with the B6H12 mAb, whi"
https://openalex.org/W1979056890,"The insulin-like peptide relaxin is a central hormone of pregnancy, but it also produces anti-fibrotic, myocardial, renal, central-nervous, and vascular effects. Recently, two G protein-coupled receptors, LGR7 and LGR8, have been identified as relaxin receptors. Prompted by reports on immunoregulatory effects of relaxin, we investigated possible interactions with the human glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Relaxin blunted the endotoxin-induced production of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha) by human macrophages--an effect that was suppressed by the GR antagonist RU-486. In three different cell lines, relaxin induced GR activation, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding as assessed in GRE-luciferase assays. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed physical interaction of endogenous and exogenous relaxin with cytoplasmic and nuclear GR. Relaxin competed with GR agonists for GR binding, both in vivo in whole-cell assays, and in vitro in fluorescence polarization assays. Relaxin was shown to up-regulate GR protein expression as well as the number of functionally active GR sites. In LGR7/8-free cells, the relaxin-mediated activation of GR was preserved. In conclusion, relaxin acts as GR agonist--a pathway pivotal to its effects on cytokine secretion by human macrophages. These findings may deepen our understanding of relaxin's abundant physiological actions, as well as our insights into general principles of hormone signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2058030533,"The neuroprotective role of estrogen (E2) is supported by a multitude of experimental and epidemiological data, although its mode of action is not fully understood. The present work was conducted to study the underlying mechanisms of its neuroprotective action, using the rat cell line PC12, an established model for neuronal cell apoptosis and survival. Our results show that E2 (but not androgens or progestins) prevent growth inhibition and apoptosis of PC12 cells, induced by serum deprivation. Several mechanisms of action were investigated: 1) intracellular estrogen receptors (ERs) have been identified but do not appear to mediate the protective effect of E2. 2) The antioxidant properties of E2 cannot explain their protective actions at the concentrations used (10(-12)-10(-6) M). 3) Finally, membrane sites for E2 have been identified, and the underlying initial signaling cascade (2-30 min after E2) has been tested, showing Ca(2+) mobilization-->PI3K activation-->Akt phosporylation-->NOS activation. Inhibition of PI3K or NOS completely reversed the anti-apoptotic effect of E2. These results suggest a new mechanism of neuroprotective action of estrogen."
https://openalex.org/W2122375393,"Though the etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unclear, alpha-synuclein (alpha-SN) is regarded as a major causative agent of PD. Several lines of evidence indicate that immunological abnormalities are associated with PD for unknown reasons. The present study was performed to assess whether peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) show altered alpha-SN expression in PD patients and to identify its functions, which may be related to peripheral immune abnormalities in PD. alpha-SN was found to be expressed more in 151 idiopathic PD (IPD) patients than in 101 healthy controls, who nevertheless showed as age-dependent increases. By in vitro transfection, alpha-SN expression was shown to be correlated with glucocorticoid sensitive apoptosis, possibly caused by the enhanced expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR), caspase activations (caspase-8, caspase-9), CD95 up-regulation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. An understanding of the correlation between alpha-SN levels and apoptosis in the presence of the coordinated involvement of multiple processes would provide an insight into the molecular basis of the disease. The present study provides a clue that the alpha-SN may be one of the primary causes of the immune abnormalities observed in PD and offers new targets for pharmacotherapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W1979254637,"We previously showed that sunlight-mimicking light induces genotoxic damage not only in skin but also even in lung, bone marrow, and peripheral blood of hairless mice. Moreover, light and smoke acted synergically in the respiratory tract. To clarify the mechanisms involved, we investigated by cDNA-arrays the expression of 746 toxicologically relevant genes in skin and lungs of mice exposed for 28 days to light and/or environmental cigarette smoke. Glutathione-S-transferase-Pi and catalase were overexpressed in the lungs of mice exposed to light only. Moreover, the light induced in skin the expression of genes involved in carcinogenesis, photoaging, and production of genotoxic and oxidizing derivatives traveling at a distance. Smoke induced the expression of multiple genes in both skin and lung, which reflect adaptive responses and mechanisms related to cancer and, possibly, to emphysema and stroke. As shown in mice exposed to both light and smoke, the light tended to increase smoke-induced gene expression in lungs, while smoke tended to attenuate light-induced gene expression in skin. The oral administration of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug sulindac inhibited the light-induced overexpression of cyclooxygenase-2 and oxidative stress-related genes in skin, and down-regulated smoke-induced genes involved in oxidative stress, removal of damaged proteins, inflammation, and immune response in lung. These results provide a mechanistic insight explaining the systemic alterations induced by both light and smoke in mouse skin and lungs."
https://openalex.org/W1996558420,"The genetic instabilities of (CCTG·CAGG)n tetranucleotide repeats were investigated to evaluate the molecular mechanisms responsible for the massive expansions found in myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) patients. DM2 is caused by an expansion of the repeat from the normal allele of 26 to as many as 11,000 repeats. Genetic expansions and deletions were monitored in an African green monkey kidney cell culture system (COS-7 cells) as a function of the length (30, 114, or 200 repeats), orientation, or proximity of the repeat tracts to the origin (SV40) of replication. As found for CTG·CAG repeats related to DM1, the instabilities were greater for the longer tetranucleotide repeat tracts. Also, the expansions and deletions predominated when cloned in orientation II (CAGG on the leading strand template) rather than I and when cloned proximal rather than distal to the replication origin. Biochemical studies on synthetic d(CAGG)26 and d(CCTG)26 as models of unpaired regions of the replication fork revealed that d(CAGG)26 has a marked propensity to adopt a defined base paired hairpin structure, whereas the complementary d(CCTG)26 lacks this capacity. The effect of orientation described above differs from all previous results with three triplet repeat sequences (including CTG·CAG), which are also involved in the etiologies of other hereditary neurological diseases. However, similar to the triplet repeat sequences, the ability of one of the two strands to form a more stable folded structure, in our case the CAGG strand, explains this unorthodox “reversed” behavior.

Herein, we show that the repeating tetranucleotide genetic instabilities associated with DM2 are caused by a structure-mediated replication-based slippage mechanism. The difference in the propensities of the CAGG and CCTG strands to transiently form quasistable DNA hairpin structures determines the type and level of instability. Furthermore, this instability is influenced by the length, orientation, and position of the repeats with respect to the origin of replication. Construction of the (CCTG·CAGG)n Containing Shuttle Vector—The (CCTG·CAGG) tetranucleotide repeats (1Liquori C.L. Ricker K. Moseley M.L. Jacobsen J.F. Kress W. Naylor S.L. Day J.W. Ranum L.P.

All three (CCTG·CAGG)n inserts (where n = 30, 114, or 200) were excised from their respective pCR2.1TOPO derivative plasmids using either an EcoRV/EagI digest or an EcoRI digest (all enzymes used in this study were purchased from New England Biolabs, Inc.). The (CCTG·CAGG) inserts are flanked on either side by vector sequences and lack any flanking non-repetitive human DM2 sequences. On excising the inserts using the EcoRV/EagI digest, in addition to the 30, 114, and 200 repeats there are 21 bp of vector flanking sequences on the EcoRV side of the insert and 24 bp of vector flanking sequence on the EagI side. The EcoRV/EagI fragments were filled-in using 1 unit of the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), purified on a 5.5% polyacrylamide gel in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8), and blunt-end ligated into the SmaI site of pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Alternately, the (CCTG·CAGG)n tracts were excised using an EcoRI digest, purified on a 5.5% polyacrylamide gel, and ligated into the MfeI site of the same shuttle vector. This fragment had 11 bp of pCR2.1TOPO vector flanking sequence on one side and 9 bp of vector flanking sequence on the other side of the repeating tract. The ligations were performed at 16 °C for 16 h by the addition of 20 units of T4 DNA ligase (U. S.

An EcoRI digest was used for repeat tracts cloned proximal (SmaI site) to the SV40 origin of replication and an AflIII/BglII digest was used for inserts cloned into the site distal (MfeI site) to the same origin of replication. The restriction fragments were end-labeled with [α-32P]dATP and 1 unit of the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I and analyzed on 5.5% polyacrylamide gels. Furthermore, the plasmids containing the (CCTG·CAGG)n repeats were dideoxy sequenced on both strands to determine the length, purity, and orientation of the repeats with respect to the origin of replication. The sequencing reactions were performed using the Thermo Sequenase Radiolabeled Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The products of the sequencing reactions were analyzed on 6% Long Ranger gels (FMC BioProducts) containing 7.5 m urea in the glycerol tolerant gel buffer (1.78 m Tris, 0.57 m taurine, and 0.01 m EDTA) (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The (CCTG·CAGG)30 is a pure repeat (i.e. it contains no polymorphisms/interruptions) as determined by sequencing of the entire repeat containing tract. The (CCTG·CAGG)114 and the (CCTG·CAGG)200 carried a single base pair interruption 11 repeats into the tract to give the sequence (CCTG)11CCTT(CCTG)n, where n = 102 and 188, respectively. The (CCTG·CAGG)n (where n = 114 or 200) repeats were sequenced using primers located at both ends of the repeating tract. In case of the (CCTG·CAGG)114, sequencing enabled the determination of ∼200–300 bp into the repeats from either side; however, on excising and analyzing the repeat containing fragment from the plasmid, an error of approximately ±5 repeats was obtained. Similarly, on analyzing the excised (CCTG·CAGG)200 fragment on polyacrylamide gels, the estimated repeat length varied by ±5 repeats. Thus, the repeat lengths were estimated by both sequencing and fragment analyses. The plasmids carried the (CCTG·CAGG)n repeat tracts in both orientations with respect to the SV40 origin of replication (Fig. 1). However, the SV40 origin is bidirectional (59Deb S. DeLucia A.L. Baur C.P. Koff A. Tegtmeyer P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1663-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and is the operative origin in COS-7 cells (60Gluzman Y. Cell. 1981; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1425) Google Scholar). Orientation I refers to the orientation in which the CCTG repeats are on the leading strand template with respect to the SV40 origin of replication, whereas the orientation in which the CCTG repeats are on the lagging strand template with respect to the same origin are referred to as orientation II. Transfection of the (CCTG·CAGG)n Repeat Containing Plasmids into COS-7 Cells—The plasmids containing the (CCTG·CAGG)n tracts were transfected into COS-7 cells. The COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) on 10-cm diameter plates. The cells were 75% confluent when transfected with 2 μg of DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The COS-7 cells were allowed to grow for 24 h after transfection before replacing the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cells were then cultured for either 48 h or 2 weeks after transfection. The COS-7 cells cultured for 2 weeks were split every 36–48 h when the cells were almost 100% confluent. Antibiotic selection (geneticin (G418), 400 μg/ml) (Invitrogen) was applied 48 h after transfection and continued thereafter for the entire 2-week period. The episomal DNA was isolated using alkaline lysis (Promega, Wizard Plus Miniprep DNA Purification System). This episomal DNA was then cleaved with 10 units of DpnI at 37 °C for 2 h. DpnI cleaves only DNA that is methylated at its GATC recognition site by the DAM methylase. Thus, treatment of the episomal DNA preparation fragments only the unreplicated DNA that is methylated, leaving the newly replicated but unmethylated or hemimethylated DNA intact. The effectiveness of the DpnI cleavage was assessed by digesting the parental plasmids with DpnI, followed by transformation in E. coli HB101 and plating on LB plates containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). The absence of colonies on LB plates confirmed the complete fragmentation of the plasmids by DpnI. The DNA after the DpnI digestion was then further purified by phenol-chloroform extractions and ethanol precipitation. Genetic Instabilities by Individual Colony Analyses—The episomal DNA, obtained after transfection in COS-7 cells cultured for either 48 h or 2 weeks, was transformed into E. coli HB101 and plated on LB plates containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Individual colonies were then picked and grown in LB broth for 16 h at 37 °C. The analyses of single colonies enabled the detection of individual events during replication of the plasmids in COS-7 cells. The plasmids were isolated using alkaline lysis and the DNA analyzed by restriction mapping. The (CCTG·CAGG)n inserts were excised using an EcoRI digest for plasmids carrying the repeats cloned into the SmaI site, whereas an AflIII/BglII digest was used to excise the inserts cloned into the MfeI site. The restriction fragments were resolved on 5.5% polyacrylamide gels. The genetic instability was measured as a change in the length of the (CCTG·CAGG)n repeat containing fragments when compared with the size of the insert excised from the parental plasmid and the 1-kbp DNA ladder size standard (Invitrogen). The lengths of each insert excised from individual colonies were determined using FluorChem version 3.04 (Alpha Innotech Corp.). Furthermore, ∼20 random clones containing expansions were sequenced to confirm the lengths and sequences of the repeat containing inserts. The genetic instability (expansions and deletions) of the (CCTG·CAGG)n repeats generated in COS-7 cells is calculated by subtracting the background instability of the repeat-containing plasmids in E. coli HB101. The genetic instability of the parental plasmids was measured by transforming these plasmids into E. coli HB101 and analyzing individual colonies using restriction mapping. The restriction digests used for these analyses were similar to those used for individual colony analyses of the episomal DNA. The percentage of background instability (average of two experiments for the three tetranucleotide lengths in both orientations (total of six experiments)) varied from 2 to 7% for repeats cloned proximal (SmaI site) and from 0 to 12% for repeats cloned distal (MfeI site) (except for (CCTG·CAGG)200 in orientation I, which was 23%) to the SV40 origin (data not shown). All statistical analyses were performed using SigmaStat version 2.03. Substrate Preparation for Chemical Modification and Enzymatic Probing—To analyze the structural features of the (CCTG·CAGG) repeats, we used “single-stranded” synthetic oligonucleotides as models of unpaired regions of the duplex repeat sequences for chemical and enzymatic modification studies. The individual oligonucleotides (Genosys), d(CCTG)26 and d(CAGG)26, were purified on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 7.5 m urea in glycerol tolerant gel buffer (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The purified oligonucleotides were labeled at the 5′ end with 15 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and [γ-32P]ATP at 37 °C for 1 h. The labeled oligonucleotides were purified on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. These purified and labeled oligonucleotides were used as substrates for the chemical and enzymatic probing reactions. Chemical Modifications and Enzymatic Probing—Three chemical probes, osmium tetraoxide (OsO4) (Aldrich), potassium permanganate (KMnO4) (Fisher), and diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) (Sigma), each were used to modify the d(CCTG)26 oligonucleotide, whereas the latter two chemicals were used to modify the d(CAGG)26 oligonucleotide. The purified and labeled oligonucleotides (4–5 × 105 cpm/reaction) in 10 mm Tris, 40 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 were denatured by heating at 80 °C for 5 min followed by renaturation by gradually decreasing the temperature (2 °C/min) to the indicated reaction temperature (61Napierala M. Krzyzosiak W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31079-31085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The chemical and enzymatic probes were then added along with the carrier DNA (salmon sperm DNA, 1 μg/μl) (Invitrogen). The DEPC modification of the oligonucleotides was carried out in a buffer containing 50 mm sodium cacodylate, 40 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.0) at 25 °C for 60 min (40Ohshima K. Wells R.D. J.

To gain insights into the molecular differences between rods and cones, we compared the gene expression profile of the rod-dominated retina of wild type mouse with that of the cone-only retina of Nrl-/- (Neural retina leucine zipper knockout) mouse. Our analysis, using custom microarrays of eye-expressed genes, provided equivalent data using either direct or reference-based experimental designs, confirmed differential expression of rod- and cone-specific genes in the Nrl-/- retina and identified novel genes that could serve as candidates for retinopathies or for functional studies. In addition, we detected altered expression of several genes that encode cell signaling or structural proteins. Prompted by these findings, additional real-time PCR analysis revealed that genes belonging to the Bmp/Smad and Wnt/Ca2+ signaling pathways are expressed in the mature wild type retina and that their expression is significantly altered in the Nrl-/- retina. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of adult retina identified Bmp4 and Smad4, which are down-regulated in the Nrl-/- retina, as possible direct transcriptional targets of Nrl. Consistent with these studies, Bmp4 and Smad4 are expressed in the mature rod photoreceptors of mouse retina. Modulation of Bmp4 and/or Smad4 by Nrl may provide a mechanism for integrating diverse cell signaling networks in rods. We hypothesize that Bmp/Smad and Wnt/Ca2+ pathways participate in cell-cell communication in the mature retina, and expression changes observed in the Nrl-/- retina reflect their biased utilization in rod versus cone homeostasis.

In mammals, vision is initiated in the retina, which is a highly structured part of the brain consisting of over 50 types of neurons that are organized in three distinct layers (1Dowling J.E. The Retina: an Approachable Part of the Brain. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA1987Google Scholar, 2Masland R.H. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The outer nuclear layer consists exclusively of two types of photoreceptors, rods and cones, responsible for detection and transduction of light energy. Rods function under low ambient light and form the major photoreceptor population of many mammals, including humans (95%) and mice (97%). Cones are responsible for phototransduction in bright light, providing high acuity and color vision (1Dowling J.E. The Retina: an Approachable Part of the Brain. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA1987Google Scholar). Cones are needed for maintaining central vision, and their survival is vital for preserving visual function in retinal and macular diseases (3Hicks D. Sahel J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 3071-3074PubMed Google Scholar, 4Curcio C.A. Owsley C. Jackson G.R. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 2015-2018PubMed Google Scholar). Rods and cones possess distinct subsets of proteins involved in the phototransduction cascade (5Nathans J.

Sci. 1998; 39: 2491-2513PubMed Google Scholar), but despite significant neuroanatomical and physiological advances (2Masland R.H. Curr. Opin.

Neurobiol. 2003; 28: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), little progress has been made toward delineating the molecular mechanisms that underlie functional distinctions between the two photoreceptor types, their communication with other neurons, and their maintenance, survival, or remodeling in response to extrinsic or intrinsic insults. One approach to systematically dissect the regulatory networks and molecules associated with rod or cone photoreceptor function is to take advantage of animal models that exhibit preferential utilization of one or the other photoreceptor sub-type. Unfortunately, many species with cone-rich retinas (e.g. ground squirrel and chick) present difficulties with respect to experimentation and are less amenable to genetic manipulations. Because of a large number of naturally occurring and experimentally generated mutants (available at jaxmice.jax.org/info/index.html), the mouse offers a unique opportunity to examine this complex question.

Farjo R. MacNee S.P. Baehr W. Stambolian D.E. Swaroop A. Genome Biol. 2003; (http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/10/R65)Google Scholar, 34Farjo R. Yu J. Othman M.I. Yoshida S. Sheth S. Glaser T. Baehr W. Swaroop A. Vision Res. 2002; 42: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Here, we report the expression profile of the mature retina from the rod-less (and cone-only) Nrl-/- mice using I-gene microarrays and compare it to the gene profile of the rod-dominated wild type mouse retina. We demonstrate differential expression of several genes, encoding phototransduction, structural, and signaling proteins, in the Nrl-/- retina. Our data reveal novel differentially expressed genes for future functional studies. Of particular importance are the findings that genes encoding components of Bmp/Smad and Wnt/Ca2+ signaling pathways are expressed in the mature retina and their expression is altered in the Nrl-/- retina. Expression analysis by real-time PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies suggest that the activity of the Smad-mediated Bmp signaling pathway is modulated by Nrl in the mature retina. In support of this, we show that Bmp4 and Smad4 are expressed in the rod photoreceptors of the mature mouse retina. We also propose that rods and cones exhibit selective bias in the utilization of different signaling pathways for cell-cell communication and controlling intracellular functions. Tissue Preparation, RNA Isolation, and Northern Analysis—All procedures involving mice were approved by the University Committee on Use and Care of Animals of the University of Michigan. Retinas were dissected from the wild type and Nrl-/- mice at postnatal day (P) 21 and snap-frozen on dry ice. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and purified by using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA integrity was verified by denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gels. Total RNA samples with a 260- to 280-nm absorbance ratio of greater than 1.9 were used for studies. Northern analysis was performed as described previously (10Swaroop A. Xu J.Z. Pawar H. Jackson A. Skolnick C. Agarwal N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Reference RNA for Retinal Gene Profiling—To generate the reference RNA for microarray hybridizations, total RNA was pooled from the following tissues and cell lines: mouse eye or retina at embryonic day (E) 14–16, P2–3, P10–12, and adult (5.5 mg); mouse adult brain (1.5 mg); P19 embryonic carcinoma cells (35McBurney M.W. Jones-Villeneuve E.M. Edwards M.K. Anderson P.J. Nature. 1982; 299: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) (3 mg); retinoic acid-induced P19 cells that differentiated into neuronal and glial-like cells (3 mg); and neuroblastoma cell line N1E-115 (36Amano T. Richelson E. Nirenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar) (4 mg). The pooled RNA was divided into aliquots (at a concentration of 1.28 μg/μl) and stored at -80 °C until use. Target Labeling and Microarray Hybridization—Mouse I-gene cDNA microarray slides (34Farjo R. Yu J. Othman M.I. Yoshida S. Sheth S. Glaser T. Baehr W. Swaroop A. Vision Res. 2002; 42: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) contained PCR-amplified products from over 6,500 cDNAs, printed in duplicate; cDNAs were isolated from libraries constructed from E15.5 eyes, P2 eyes, and adult retinas, sequenced, and annotated (33Yu J. Farjo R. MacNee S.P. Baehr W. Stambolian D.E. Swaroop A. Genome Biol. 2003; (http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/10/R65)Google Scholar). Target RNA (10 μg of total RNA) was labeled using a 3DNA Submicro Expression Array Detection kit (Genisphere, Hatfield, PA) and hybridized to microarray slides, as described (37Yu J. Othman M.I. Farjo R. Zareparsi S. MacNee S.P. Yoshida S. Swaroop A. Mol. Vis. 2002; 8: 130-137PubMed Google Scholar). The slides were scanned using an Affymetrix 428 scanner (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) to obtain the highest intensity of signal, without reaching saturation for a maximum of 10 out of the 13,440 spots. Image Processing and Data Analysis—Scanned array images without major defects (such as scratches or blobs) were analyzed using AnalyzerDG (MolecularWare Inc., Cambridge, MA) in a batch mode. A “contour shape” was utilized to detect spots for intensity calculations, whereas a “cell method” was set to calculate background on an individual basis in a local square region centered on the spot. A data file containing spots' intensities and annotations was exported for each array in the tab-delimited text format and then imported into the statistical package, R (available at www.r-project.org/). Intensities of Cy3 and Cy5 channels for each spot were calculated separately by subtracting corresponding median background from the mean signal intensity. Genes with negative background-corrected intensities in either channel were filtered out. To reduce systematic variation caused by experimental procedures (such as dye effects), a data-driven normalization was applied to individual datasets using a cluster of least-altered genes on the array identified by a rank-based algorithm. Briefly, let (Rj, Gj) denote the measurements for the jth gene in the red (Cy5) and green (Cy3) channels, respectively, j = 1,..., m. We calculate the ranks in each channel separately, take the difference in ranks between the two channels, and fit a three-component normal mixture model to the difference in ranks for the m genes. There will be three classes of genes to consider: those for which the rank in the red channel is significantly higher than that in the green channel, those for which the rank in the green channel is significantly higher than that in the red channel, and those for which the ranks do not substantially change between the two channels. The genes whose ranks did not change between the two channels were used to perform a slide-dependent normalization based on a locally weighted linear squares procedure (38Cleveland W.S. J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 1979; 74: 829-836Crossref Scopus (7474) Google Scholar). This allowed us to normalize genes and redefine a new horizontal zero axis that was used to compute log ratios of intensities in two channels. For indirect comparisons, log ratios of the wild type slide were subtracted from the Nrl-/- slide to obtain reference-corrected values for each gene. An Empirical Bayes method was then applied to the replicated arrays to obtain a B statistic for each gene (39Lonnestedt I. Speed T. Statistica Sinica. 2002; 12: 31-46Google Scholar); the B statistic estimates the posterior log odds of differential expression. Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—To validate gene expression changes, qRT-PCR analysis was performed as described (33Yu J. Farjo R. MacNee S.P. Baehr W. Stambolian D.E. Swaroop A. Genome Biol. 2003; (http://genomebiology.com/2003/4/10/R65)Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA (2.5 μg) treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI) was subjected to reverse transcription using oligod(T) primers and with (+RT sample) or without (-RT) SuperScript II (Invitrogen). For each gene, real-time PCR reactions from wild type and Nrl-/- samples were performed in triplicate with SybrGreen I (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and analyzed with the iCycler IQ real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). The average threshold cycle (Ct) differences between the two samples were normalized against Hprt (control) in the corresponding cDNA preparation. Immunohistochemistry—Anti-Gnb3 polyclonal antibodies were generated in rabbit against the peptide (ADITLAELVSGLEVV) and affinity-purified (Invitrogen). Anti-Smad4 rabbit polyclonal antibody (H-552) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Due to the low number of cones in wild type mouse retina (3% of photoreceptors), we also performed immunohistochemical analyses on frozen sections of adult pig retina, which contains ∼15–20% cones (40Hendrickson A. Hicks D. Exp. Eye Res. 2002; 74: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Cryostat sections of mouse and pig retina were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (5 min), and then preincubated in blocking buffer (PBS supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% normal rabbit serum, and 0.1% NaN3) for 30 min. The sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in anti-Gnb3 and anti-Smad4 polyclonal antibodies (diluted 1:200 in blocking buffer), combined either with rho-4D2 anti-rod opsin monoclonal antibody (1 μg/ml) (41Hicks D. Molday R.S. Exp. Eye Res. 1986; 42: 55-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) or with biotinylated peanut agglutinin (PNA, Vector Laboratories, 10 μg/ml). After extensive washing in PBS, sections were incubated in a mixture of goat anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa488 or -Alexa594 (Molecular Probes; 2 μg/ml), and either rabbit anti-mouse IgG- or streptavidin-Alexa594 or -Alexa488 (each 2 μg/ml) in blocking buffer for 2 h. Slides were washed extensively, mounted, and viewed by fluorescence microscopy (Nikon Optiphot 2) or by laser scanning confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510 version 2.5 scanning device with Zeiss Axiovert 100 inverted microscope). Control experiments were performed by omitting the primary antibody. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—A commercially available assay kit (Upstate Biotechnologies, Charlottesville, VA) was used for ChIP studies. Briefly, four snap-frozen retinas from wild type mice were cross-linked for 15 min at 37 °C with 1% formaldehyde in PBS containing proteinase inhibitors. The retinas were washed four times in ice-cold PBS with proteinase inhibitors and then incubated on ice for 15 min. The tissue was then sonicated on ice eight times using 20-s pulses. The remaining steps were essentially performed as described by the manufacturer, using anti-NRL polyclonal antibody (12Swain P.K. Hicks D. Mears A.J. Apel I.J. Smith J.E. John S.K. Hendrickson A.

Putative promoter regions (5′ upstream of the transcription start site) for Rho, Bmp4, Smad4, and Bmpr1a were determined in silico (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview). Each DNA sequence was analyzed using MatInspector (www.genomatix.de/index.html). PCR primers were designed to flank the putative Nrl binding sites (Nrl response element, NRE) (18Rehemtulla A.

The sequence closest to the transcription start site was chosen. ChIP DNAs from two independent experiments were used for PCR using equal amounts for input, with antibody, and no antibody reactions.Table IPutative NRE and the PCR primers used for ChIP enrichment assaysGenePutative NRE (base pairs upstream of the transcription start site)ChIP PCR primersBmp4GACAGTGACGCAGGGAATCAA (—1495)Forward 5′-AACCTGCTATGGGAGCACAG-3′Reverse 5′-GGAATGTCAGGTTGGAAGGA-3′Smad4CAATTTTGATGACAATGAAGAATTG (—1299)Forward 5′-GCATCCAAAGGGTCATGAGT-3′Reverse 5′-GGGTAAGCCAAAGGGACAAT-3′Bmpr1aATGTATGACTGTGCATCACAT (—1684)Forward 5′-GGTGGATATGAGGGAATGGA-3′Reverse 5′-TGGTGGTCCACTACCATCTG-3′RhodopsinGGATGCTGAATCAGCCTCT (—70)Forward 5′-GATGGGATAGGTGAGTTCAGGA-3′Reverse 5′-GAGAAGGGCACATAAAAATTGG-3′ Open table in a new tab In Situ Hybridization—The 35S-labeled antisense and sense cRNA transcripts were synthesized from the mouse Bmp4 and Smad4 cDNAs cloned in pSPORT1 vector, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Ambion). The labeled transcripts were subjected to alkali hydrolysis (to give an average size of 70 nucleotides) and then hybridized overnight to 5- to 7-μm serial sections of adult mouse retina using standard protocols (Phylogeny Inc., Columbus, OH). After stringent washing, the slides were dipped in Kodak NTB-2 nuclear track emulsion and exposed for 1–2 weeks. Slides were developed in Kodak D-19, counterstained with toluidine blue, and analyzed by light and dark-field optics. Expression Analysis Using Purified Rod Photoreceptors—To obtain a highly enriched population of rod photoreceptors, we used Nrl-GFP transgenic mice that express enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under the control of Nrl promoter specifically in rods. 4M. Akimoto and A. Swaroop, unpublished data. Retinas of Nrl-GFP mice at P28 were dissected and dissociated using the Papain Dissociation System (Worthington). Cells that were positive and negative for EGFP were flow-sorted by FACSAria (BD Biosciences). Total RNA was used for RT-PCR using gene-specific primers, as follows. Bmpr1a: forward, AAGGAATGGGTGGGATTAGC; reverse, TGGCGATTGCCAACTAGATA; Grm6: forward, CAAGTAGCAAGGTTGAGTGT; reverse, GGAAGAATGCTGGAAGCAAG; Hprt: forward, CAAACTTTGCTTTCCCTGGT; reverse, CAAGGGCATATCCAACAACA; Nrl: forward, GCTGCATTTTCACCGAATCT; reverse, GGTGGTTTGGGTTGTGGTAG; Rho: forward, CTTCCTGATCTGCTGGCTTC; reverse, ACAGTCTCTGGCCAGGCTTA; Smad4: forward, ACCCGCGTATGCCGCCCCATCC; reverse, ACAGCGTCGCCAGGTGCTCGGC; Thy1: forward, AACTCTTGGCACCATGAACC; reverse, AGGCTGAACTCATGCTGGAT. We chose to generate gene expression profiles of P21 retinas from rod-dominated wild type and rodless (cone-only) Nrl-/- mice. At this stage, the differentiation and laminar organization of retinal neurons are complete, and phototransduction pathways in the retina (from photoreceptors to ganglion cells) are fully functional. High Concordance between Direct and Indirect Microarray Comparisons—We examined two different experimental designs, direct and indirect comparison (42Yang Y.H. Speed T. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 579-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar), for their ability to identify differentially expressed genes. Two direct comparison experiments (two slides), in which Cy3-labeled wild type and Cy5-labeled Nrl-/- retinal RNA targets were hybridized simultaneously to the same slide, were performed. Five indirect comparisons were carried out with the reference RNA labeled by Cy3 and hybridized in conjunction with Cy5-labeled either wild type or Nrl-/- retinal RNA (total of 10 slides). Of the 13,440 spots on the I-gene microarray slides, 97.4% (13,092 spots) showed higher spot intensity than the background (i.e. were considered detected) in both direct comparison slides, whereas 91.6% (12,307 spots) spots were detected in all 10 slides with indirect comparisons. Scatter-plot analysis of signal intensities of the wild type and Nrl-/- retinas revealed high similarity between direct and indirect comparisons (Fig. 1). A majority of genes have log2 ratios centered at 0, indicating no change between the two tested samples. Only a few spots displayed over 4-fold change in both methods, although direct comparison showed a tighter scatter within the 4-fold lines. Both methods were able to successfully identify the duplicate spots of S-opsin and rhodopsin as the most up- or down-regulated genes in the Nrl-/- retina, respectively. To compare the power of direct versus indirect methods in identifying differential gene expressi"

These studies indicate that ZAP-70 antagonists could be useful immuno-modulatory therapeutic agents. ZAP-70 contains two N-terminal SH2 (Src homology domain 2) domains and a C-terminal kinase domain. During T cell activation, the binding of ZAP-70 SH2 domains to the phosphorylated ζ subunit on the activated TCR complex causes a colocalization with the Lck tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates ZAP-70 on Tyr493 in the activation loop (10Chan A.C.

ZAP-70-mediated activation of these downstream effectors leads to the release of intracellular calcium stores, and the transcription of interleukin-2 and other genes important for an immune response. Previously, the crystal structure of the ZAP-70 SH2 domains in complex with a TCR ζ subunit peptide was reported (1Hatada M.H. Lu X. Laird E.R. Green J. Morgenstern J.P. Lou M. Marr C.S.

As a step toward a better understanding of the structure-function relationship of ZAP-70 and to assist in the design of selective active site inhibitors, we have determined the crystal structure of the kinase domain of human ZAP-70 to 2.3 Å resolution. Cloning of ZAP-70 Truncated Kinase Domains—Human ZAP-70 cDNA fragments (GenBankTM accession number L05148) were synthesized by PCR and cloned using the NcoI (5′) and XhoI (3′) sites of pTriEx (Novagen), the BamHI (5′) and NotI (3′) sites of pFastBacHTb (Invitrogen), the BamHI (5′) and EcoRI (3′) sites of pVL1393 (Invitrogen), or the BamHI (5′) and the NotI (3′) sites of pEBB (16Kang H. Freund C. Duke-Cohan J.S. Musacchio A. Wagner G. Rudd C.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2889-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The pFastBacHTb plasmids were designed to express N-terminal His-tagged proteins containing the sequence MSYYHHHHHHDYDIPTTENLYFQGAMGSHM prior to the first ZAP-70 residue. All other ZAP-70 proteins were expressed as fusion proteins with a C-terminal heptahistidine tag. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Vectors pVL1393, pFastBacHTb, and pTriEx were used for protein expression in insect cells. Vectors pTriEx and pEBB were used for protein expression in mammalian cells. Mammalian Cell Transfection and Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Kinase Assay—ZAP-70 expression plasmids (pEBB or pTriEx) were transiently transfected into 293T human kidney fibroblast cells (ATCC) or COS7 cells (ATCC) by LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) using Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. After 24 h, cells were harvested by trypsinization, resuspended in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. Subsequently, cells were lysed by the addition of 1 ml of 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO3, 10% glycerol, and complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min on ice. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration of the supernatant solution was estimated by the Bradford dye-binding assay (Pierce). For kinase activity measurements, lysates (1–2 mg of total protein) were immunoprecipitated with an anti-His antibody (Novagen) and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 20mm MnCl2, 200 μm NaVO3, 1 mm DTT, and 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate) and recovered each time by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 1 min. The beads were resuspended in 20 μl of kinase buffer with 100 μm ATP and 23 μm A1 peptide (biotinyl-EQEDEPEGDYEEVLE, American Peptide) (17Park Y.W. Cummings R.T. Wu L. Zheng S. Cameron P.M. Woods A.

The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and stopped by the addition of EDTA to 30 mm. Reaction tubes were centrifuged, and the supernatants were transferred to a streptavidin-coated plate (Pierce) that had been pretreated with blocking buffer (1× Tris-buffered saline, 0.5× Western blocking buffer (Roche Applied Science)). The plate was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then washed five times with 1× Tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20 to remove unbound material. A conjugated secondary antibody (anti-phosphotyrosine antibody-horseradish peroxidase (4G10, Upstate Biotech)) was added (100 μl of a 1:40,000 dilution) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Following five washes with 1× Tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20, 3,3,5,5-tetramethyl-benzidine substrate (Pierce) was added, and the plate was incubated at room temperature while shaking. The reaction was stopped after 10 min by adding 100 μl of 2 m H2SO4, and the absorbance at 450 nm was read (Fig. 1A). Full-length ZAP-70 (Panvera/Invitrogen) was used as a positive control in each assay. To verify ZAP-70 recombinant protein expression for every sample, the immunoprecipitated protein was eluted from the beads using 25 μl of 1× NuPage lithium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer with NuPage sample reducing agent (Invitrogen) at 70 °C for 10 min. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for immunoblotting using a murine anti-ZAP-70 monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories/BD). The immunoblot was developed by the addition of peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at a dilution of 1:5000 followed by the addition of Super Signal WestDura extended duration substrate (Pierce). Chemiluminescence was detected using a FluorChem™ IS-5500 image station (Alpha Innotech Corp.). Recombinant Baculoviruses, Infection, and Protein Expression—The pTriEx and BacVector (Novagen) plasmids were utilized to generate recombinant baculoviruses by standard procedures. A single plaque-purified recombinant baculovirus was amplified to form a high titer virus stock (typically 1–4 × 108 plaque-forming units/ml) (Abgent). SF+ cells (Protein Sciences Corp.) were expanded in 1-liter shaker flasks to a concentration of 4 × 106 cells/ml in SF-900II SFM medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with gentamycin (50 μg/ml) and fungizone (250 ng/ml). High titer baculovirus was used to infect 10 liters of SF+ insect cells at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml and a multiplicity of infection of 2 in a bioreactor (WAVE Biotech). The cells were harvested after 72 h by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed once by resuspension in phosphate-buffered saline, and then centrifuged again at 800 × g for 10 min. The pelleted cells were stored at –80 °C. Protein expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis of lysates with a monoclonal anti-Zap-70 antibody as described above. Purification of the Kinase Domain Containing Residues 327–606-His7—Frozen cell pellets expressing recombinant human ZAP-70 residues 327–606 (rhZAP70327–606) were thawed at room temperature following the addition of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 5% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science)) at a ratio of 1.25 × 107 cells/ml. The suspension was then sonicated (Branson Sonifier, model 250) for 3 × 2-min bursts with a 1-cm flat tip at a power setting of 8 and constant duty cycle. DNase (Sigma) was added to 10 μg/ml, and the lysate was incubated on ice with occasional stirring for 30 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was filtered through a glass fiber pre-filter on top of an 0.8-μm membrane (Millipore). The clarified supernatant was loaded onto an 11-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column (25-mm interior diameter × 22-mm height, Qiagen). The column was washed with 10–15 column volumes of 25 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 5% glycerol, and rhZAP70327–606 was eluted with increasing amounts of EDTA (50, 100, and 500 mm EDTA in 25 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol). Fractions containing ZAP-70 were identified by either SDS-PAGE or Western blots, pooled, and dialyzed against 40 volumes of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, and 5% glycerol overnight at 4 °C. The dialyzed sample was passed over a 10-ml column of Q-Sepharose Fast Flow (25 × 21 mm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5% glycerol. rhZAP70327–606 was collected in the unbound fraction. A 5-fold molar excess of staurosporine was added, and the fraction was concentrated to ∼5 ml. The concentrated sample was injected onto a 2.6 × 95-cm Superdex 75 column (Amersham Bioscience) equilibrated with 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5% glycerol. Fractions containing rhZAP-70327–606 were pooled. Determination of Enzymatic Activity of rhZAP70327–606—A homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) competitive immunoassay was utilized to determine the activity of rhZAP70327–606. The assay buffer consisted of 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.01% v/v Tween 20®. A synthetic co-polymer of glutamic acid and tyrosine (poly(Glu,Tyr), 4:1 (Sigma)) was used as the peptide substrate. Final assay concentrations of ATP and poly(Glu,Tyr) were 5 μm and 66 μg/ml, respectively. Relative enzymatic activity was determined by performing 2-fold serial dilutions of enzyme in 384-well black polystyrene microtiter plates (MatriCal) on ice. An equal volume of substrate solution containing 5% v/v Me2SO was added to start the reaction, which was then allowed to proceed for 1 h at room temperature. Control wells received no enzyme. The final reaction volume was 20 μl. The enzyme reaction was terminated by addition of 5 μl of stop/development solution comprising of 10 nm europium-labeled antiphosphotyrosine antibody (P-Tyr-100, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 40 nm streptavidin-allophycocyanin conjugate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 50 nm phosphorylated biotinylated A1 peptide (see above), and 25 mm EDTA. The plate was incubated for an additional hour at room temperature and subsequently read in a Victor2 multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) utilizing an excitation wavelength of 340 nm. Emission was monitored at two wavelengths, 665 and 615 nm, the emission maxima of allophycocyanin and europium, respectively. The default LANCETM settings were used for time-gated fluorescence resonance energy transfer (50 μs time delay). Data were plotted as fluorescence ratio (665/615 nm) versus enzyme concentration, and the enzyme EC50 and EC80 were determined through nonlinear least squares fitting (Fig. 2A). In the absence of enzyme activity, a fluorescent signal is generated by the europium-peptide-allophycocyanin complex. Phosphorylated poly(Glu,Tyr) generated by active enzyme displaces the europium-labeled antiphosphotyrosine antibody, thereby abrogating the fluorescent signal. Staurosporine inhibition of rhZAP-70327–606 was determined using the assay described above with the following modifications. A 22-point 2-fold serial dilution of a 2 mm staurosporine stock solution in 100% Me2SO was performed in a separate 384-well polypropylene dilution plate. 0.5 μl of each of the staurosporine dilutions was added to 10 μlof substrate solution in a 384-well polystyrene assay plate. 10 μl of enzyme solution was added to initiate the reaction. The final enzyme concentration was 411.5 pm (EC80 for rhZAP70327–606). All subsequent steps are as described above. Data were plotted as fluorescence ratio versus compound concentration. The staurosporine IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) was determined through nonlinear least squares fitting to a sigmoid curve (Fig. 2B). Crystallization and Data Collection of rhZAP70327–606-Staurosporine Complex—Purified rhZAP70327–606 was concentrated to 28 mg/ml (determined by absorbance at 280 nm with extinction coefficient of 0.68 mg/ml/absorbance) with a Microcon 10 concentrator (Amicon) in the presence of a 5-fold molar excess of AMP-PCP, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue. AMP-PCP worked as an additive agent for growing high quality rhZAP70327–606 crystals. Crystals grown overnight in hanging droplets containing equal volumes of enzyme and well solution and placed over a well containing 0.15 m d,l-malic acid, pH 7.0, 20% w/v polyethylene glycol 3350 at 20 °C. Crystals were dipped into a cryoprotecting solution (well solution with 20% glycerol) before being flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected on a RAXIS IV++ with a RU-H3R generator and X-stream 2000 system (Rigaku) and processed with HKL2000 (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter J.C.W. Sweet R.M. Macromolecular Crystallography, Part A. 276. Academic Press, New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar). The crystal diffracted to 2.3 Å resolution and belonged to the space group P212121 (Table I).

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The initial phases for the Zap-70 structure were obtained by molecular replacement with the program AmoRe (19Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 57: 1367-1372Crossref Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The coordinates of ephrin receptor A2 (B chain, Protein Data Bank code 1MQB) were used as the search model, excluding the N and C termini, flexible loops, and side chain atoms beyond Cβ. The molecular replacement solution was first refined as two rigid bodies, N-lobe and C-lobe, to optimize the relative orientations of the two lobes. Cycles of structure refinement and manual model building were carried out in CNX and Quanta2000 (Accelrys), respectively. After the first round of refinement, the sequence of ZAP-70 was built in, and the missing loops were added in stepwise fashion with each round of model building and refinement. The final model contains residues 328–606 plus 6 of the 7 histidines in the C-terminal His tag. Residues 327 and 359–361 were omitted from the model because of poorly defined electron density. Electron density for AMP-PCP was not observed in the final maps. The refinement statistics are listed in Table I. Identification of an Active ZAP-70 Kinase Domain—Our first objective was to identify a version of the kinase domain that possesses kinase activity and is crystallizable for structure determination. In many instances, the novel N and C termini of proteins generated by molecular engineering can be crucial for crystallization (reviewed in Ref. 20Jin L. Babine R.E. Babine R.E. Abdel-Meguid S.S. Protein Crystallography in Drug Discovery. 20. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim2004: 209-214Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence conservation between ZAP-70 and other protein kinases indicated the approximate location of the kinase domain; however, delineation of a stable fragment of the full-length protein needed to be determined empirically. We prepared multiple plasmids with a series of N- and/or C-terminal truncations of the kinase domain, each with a polyhistidine tag, and tested their kinase activity using a mammalian transient transfection assay (Fig. 1). Following transient transfection in mammalian cells, cell lysates were evaluated for kinase activity. A typical experiment is shown in Fig. 1A. Following immunoprecipitation with an antibody against the His tag, protein kinase activity was measured by peptide substrate phosphorylation as detected by increased binding of anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis of the cell lysates and the immunoprecipitated samples confirmed the presence of ZAP-70 protein for each transfection and for the immunoprecipitated samples that were tested for kinase activity (Fig. 1A). A summary of the kinase activity of all truncations analyzed is shown in Fig. 1B. N-terminal truncations between residues Cys254 and Asp327 yielded active proteins (Fig. 1B). In contrast, truncations at Asp335 or Leu338 caused inactivation of the ZAP-70 kinase fragment as did site-specific modification of a catalytic aspartate residue to asparagine, D479N (Fig. 1B). Truncation of the C terminus to residue 606 retained kinase activity, whereas deletion to Tyr593 or Tyr598 eliminated its activity (Fig. 1B). These results were consistent with previous reports of activity from glutathione S-transferase fusion protein recombinants of the ZAP-70 kinase domain (21Visco C. Magistrelli G. Bosotti R. Perego R. Rusconi L. Toma S. Zamai M. Acuto O. Isacchi A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2784-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 22Magistrelli G. Bosotti R. Valsasina B. Visco C. Perego R. Toma S. Acuto O. Isacchi A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 1166-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Therefore, a recombinant ZAP-70 fragment consisting of residues 327–606 is sufficient to yield an active catalytic domain. We performed crystallization trials on several of these active ZAP-70 kinase domains. rhZAP70327–606 was the shortest one and yielded the best crystals for solving the structure. Enzymatic Properties and Crystallization of rhZAP70327–606— rhZAP70327–606 was expressed in insect cells and purified to homogeneity with a representative yield of 1.7 mg/liter and >90% purity (Fig. 2A, inset). Consistent with previous reports (21Visco C. Magistrelli G. Bosotti R. Perego R. Rusconi L. Toma S. Zamai M. Acuto O. Isacchi A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2784-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), the purified kinase domain was found to be more active (7-fold) than full-length protein in a TR-FRET competitive immunoassay (Fig. 2A). rhZAP70327–606 yielded diffraction-quality crystals in the presence of staurosporine and AMP-PCP (see “Experimental Procedures”). Staurosporine, a microbial alkaloid from Streptomyces, is a nonselective, ATP-competitive inhibitor of many kinases (23Omura S. Iwai Y. Hirano A. Nakagawa A. Awaya J. Tsuchya H. Takahashi Y.

The Overall -Fold of rhZAP70327–606—rhZAP70327–606 exhibits a bilobal architecture that is well conserved among the catalytic domains of protein kinases (Fig. 3). The smaller N-terminal lobe contains a five-stranded antiparallel β-sheet and a single helix (αC) (Figs. 3 and 4). The larger C-terminal lobe is predominantly helical with short strands of β-sheet. The two lobes are connected by an extended linker region. The catalytic site (ATP-binding site) is located at the junction between these two lobes and contains staurosporine. The N-terminal lobe has more thermal disorder than the C-terminal lobe, as indicated by the higher temperature factors for the atoms in the N-terminal lobe. The average temperature factor is 60.0 Å2 for the N-terminal lobe (residues 328–415) and 47.0 Å2 for the C-terminal lobe (residues 416–606-His6).Fig. 4Amino acid alignment of the Zap-70 kinase domain with related kinases. ZAP-70 kinase domain alignment with tyrosine kinases Syk, Lck, Src, Abl, and EphA2 are shown. The boundaries of the secondary structural motifs for rhZAP70327–606 are indicated by arrows for β-strands, boxes for α-helices, and lines for coils or turns. Several residues in the catalytic loop and the DFG motif are indicated in red and major regulatory phosphorylation sites in pink (Tyr492 and Tyr493); residues in the surface site and gatekeeper pocket, as discussed in the text, are shown in yellow. The conserved residues are highlighted in gray boxes. Residue numbers for each kinase are indicated in parentheses. The alignment was generated using VectorNTI (Informax, Inc.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Analysis of the crystal structure reveals that rhZAP70327–606 is in an “active” conformation. In the C-terminal lobe, the activation loop contains two regulatory tyrosines involved in trans- and autophosphorylation (Tyr492 and Tyr493). Phosphorylation of tyrosines in the activation loop is known to be a mechanism of kinase activation by causing a conformational change of the loop such that the loop no longer blocks protein substrate accessibility (e.g. insulin receptor tyrosine kinase) (28Hubbard S.R.

Science. 1991; 253: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). For ZAP-70, phosphorylation of Tyr493 is required for activation in vivo (10Chan A.C. Dalton M. Johnson R. Kong G.H. Wang T. Thoma R. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2499-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 11Wange R.L. Guitian R. Isakov N. Watts J.D. Aebersold R. Samelson L.E. J. Biol.

In the ZAP-70 structure, the activation loop adopts an open and active conformation, without phosphorylation of Tyr492 or Tyr493. Also, there was no detectable phosphorylation on Tyr493 by semi-quantitative Western blot analysis of rhZAP70327–606 (data not shown). Since part of the activation loop is interacting with a symmetry-related molecule in the crystal, it is impossible to determine from this structure whether the loop was in an apparently active conformation in solution prior to crystal packing or whether crystal packing induced the observed conformation. However, a similar conformation of the nonphosphorylated activation loop is observed in the crystal structure of the Chk1-staurosporine complex (33Zhao B. Bower M.J. McDevitt P.J. Zhao H. Davis S.T.

https://openalex.org/W2070169837,"Normal spontaneous apoptosis in neutrophils is enhanced by “stress” stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor-α, Fas ligand, and oxidants, and this effect is inhibited by anti-apoptotic stimuli including granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, lipopolysaccharide, and formylmethionine-leucine-phenylalanine. In this report we demonstrate that anti-apoptotic stimuli protect neutrophils from stress-induced apoptosis via activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway. The protection occurs downstream of mitochondrial alterations assessed as a decrease in membrane potential concomitant with enhanced cytochrome c release. ERK activation was shown to inhibit apoptosis by maintaining levels of XIAP, which is normally decreased in the presence of the pro-apoptotic/stress stimuli. This report also demonstrates that potent intra- and extracellular oxidants inhibit the protective effect of ERK. Oxidant-dependent inhibition of ERK was because of activation of p38 MAPK and activation of the protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A. Our data suggest that ERK suppresses stress-induced apoptosis downstream of mitochondrial alterations by maintaining XIAP levels and that oxidants block this effect through activation of p38 and protein phosphatases.

Apoptosis is an essential process for development, normal growth, and tissue homeostasis. Neutrophils are unique in their ability to undergo rapid spontaneous apoptosis once released from the bone marrow, resulting in their clearance from the circulation within a few hours. During in vitro culture, 80% will undergo apoptosis within 16–20 h (1Savill J.S. Wylie A.H. Henson J.E. Walport M.J. Henson P.M. Haslett C. J. Clin. Investig. 1989; 83: 865-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). Recently, we have suggested that repetitive engagement of cell surface β2 integrins within the vasculature, as well as during transvascular emigration of the cells during inflammation, may serve as a protective stimulus to prolong the life span of the cell (2Whitlock B.B.

Enhanced apoptosis during an inflammatory reaction may help prevent tissue damage as it promotes the surface exposure of phosphatidylserine and ultimately results in the removal of neutrophils from the blood or tissue by local phagocytes. The apoptotic process in neutrophils is delayed by at least three major pathways involving 1) PI3K/Akt, 2) the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) subgroup (7Sweeney J.F. Nguyen P.K. Omann G. Hinshaw D.B. J. Surg. Res. 1999; 81: 108-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and 3) activation of NF-κB (8Ward C. Chilvers E.R. Lawson M.F. Pryde J.G.

Our previous investigations have determined that the combined presence of integrin activation (but not integrin clustering) and pro-apoptotic stress stimuli down-regulate or bypass these anti-apoptotic pathways resulting in markedly enhanced neutrophil apoptosis (2Whitlock B.B. Gardai S. Fadok V. Bratton D. Henson P.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1305-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The three mitogen-activated protein kinases MAPK/ERK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase, and p38 have been implicated in controlling neutrophil apoptosis through the regulation of downstream kinases and activation of transcription factors. ERK activation is by a variety of necessary growth factors including GM-CSF, LPS, and fMLP and is important for their ability to inhibit apoptosis (7Sweeney J.F. Nguyen P.K. Omann G. Hinshaw D.B. J. Surg. Res. 1999; 81: 108-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). ERK activation also inhibits apoptosis induced by stress stimuli such as oxidants, TNFα, UV light, as well as growth factor withdrawal (7Sweeney J.F. Nguyen P.K. Omann G. Hinshaw D.B. J. Surg. Res. 1999; 81: 108-112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this report we demonstrate that ERK blocks spontaneous and stress-induced neutrophil apoptosis downstream of mitochondrial injury and release of cytochrome c, a process also noted in other cell types (10Erhardt P. Schremser E.J. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5308-5315Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family is a likely target for ERK-mediated protection. These proteins were initially identified in baculovirus and are highly conserved across species. They act directly on caspases, distal to mitochondrial perturbation (11Yang Y.L. Li X.M. Cell Res. 2000; 10: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The IAP family consists of cIAP-1, cIAP-2, XIAP, neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein, and survivin. Their baculoviral IAP repeat domains recruit and inhibit caspase activity, regulate cell cycle progression, and modulate receptor-mediated signal transduction (11Yang Y.L. Li X.M.

XIAP contains a ring finger domain that becomes highly ubiquitinated upon the induction of apoptosis, in part due to auto-ubiquitination resulting in rapid degradation of the protein (16Yang Y. Fang S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Science. 2000; 288: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Ring mutants of XIAP display higher protein levels after exposure to apoptotic stimuli and in fact delay dexamethasone-induced apoptosis in T-cells (13Yang Y. Ashwell J.D. J. Clin. Immunol. 1999; 19: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). XIAP activity is also regulated by the SMAC/DIABLO protein, which binds the baculoviral IAP repeat 3 domain and disassociates XIAP from the caspases (17Liu Z. Sun C. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Betz S.F. Oost T. Herrmann J. Wu J.C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 2000; 408: 1004-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Oxidants, intra- and extracellular, have long been associated with the induction of apoptosis, due in part to their ability to modify protein activity and alter intracellular signaling (18Lieberthal W. Triaca V. Koh J.S. Pagano P.J. Levine J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F691-F702PubMed Google Scholar, 19Chen Y.C. Lin-Shiau S.Y. Lin J.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Oxidants may also activate the ubiquitination pathway, in particular ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase (20Chandra J. Samali A. Orrenius S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar), resulting in the degradation of important anti-apoptotic molecules such as XIAP. Oxidants are also known activators of the MAPK family, particularly p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (21Wang K. Gross A. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6083-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The effect of p38 on apoptosis still remains undetermined; there are reports demonstrating that activation of p38 enhances apoptosis and that inhibiting p38 results in enhanced survival (22Underwood D.C. Osborn R.R. Bochnowicz S. Webb E.F. Rieman D.J. Lee J.C. Romanic A.M. Adams J.L. Hay D.W. Griswold D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L895-L902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, other studies indicate that p38 may be involved in inhibiting apoptosis (23Alvarado-Kristensson M. Porn-Ares M.I. Grethe S. Smith D. Zheng L. Andersson T. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 129-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In neutrophils p38 is involved in UV-induced apoptosis and has also been linked to promoting spontaneous apoptosis (5Frasch S.C. Nick J.A. Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Worthen G.S. Henson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8389-8397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 24Aoshiba K. Yasui S. Hayashi M. Tamaoki J. Nagai A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1692-1700PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of oxidant-stimulated p38 activity on neutrophil apoptosis has not yet been explored, but its ability to suppress ERK activity in epithelial cells and macrophages suggests a possible mechanism for a pro-apoptotic effect (25Berra E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10792-10797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 26Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E.

In this report we demonstrate that stress-induced apoptosis is associated with mitochondrial damage and degradation, or decreased synthesis, of the potent anti-apoptotic molecule XIAP. ERK activation inhibits stress-induced apoptosis by maintaining XIAP levels but does not prevent the mitochondrial changes including decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c. Addition of oxidants blocked ERK activation through the stimulation of p38 and subsequent activation of protein phosphatases (PP1 and PP2A). Reagents and Antibodies—The following monoclonal antibodies were obtained from commercial sources and were confirmed to bind to human neutrophils by flow cytometry. Anti-αM 2LPM19c was obtained from Dako (Carpinteria, CA) and anti-αMVim12 from Caltag Laboratories (Burlingame, CA). Unless specified otherwise, monoclonal antibodies were used at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml. All antibodies were tested as dialyzed preparations to rule out nonspecific effects of commercial diluents. Formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine (fMLP), was used at 10–7m; t-butyl hydroperoxide was used at a final concentration of 100 μm; (–)-2-oxo-4-thiazolidine-carboxylic acid (OTC) was used at 10 μm, and all were obtained from Sigma. TNFα was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MI) and was used at a final concentration of 1,000 units/ml. IgM anti-Fas clone CH11 was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), and used at a concentration of 1 μg/ml to induce apoptosis. The MEK-1 inhibitor PD-98059 was used at 25 μm; NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI) was used at 10 μm; p38 inhibitor SB-208035 was used at 10 μm, and the protein phosphatase inhibitors calyculin and okadaic acid were used at 20 nm and 20 μg/ml, respectively. All inhibitors were obtained from Calbiochem. Anti-phospho-MEK and total MEK-/2 were obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA) and were used at 1:1000 in 5% BSA; anti-cytochrome c was obtained from Pharmingen and used at 1 μg/ml. Neutrophil Isolation—Human neutrophils were purified from whole blood by using a Percoll gradient as described previously (28Haslett C. Guthrie L.A. Kopaniak M.M. Johnston Jr., R.B. Henson P.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1985; 119: 101-110PubMed Google Scholar). Neutrophil purity was 95% with typically less than 2% eosinophils and cell viability greater than 98%. Assessment of Apoptosis in Suspension Neutrophils—After isolation, neutrophils were suspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI supplemented with 1% LPS-free BSA (Sigma, A-1933) and incubated in conical polypropylene tubes (Sarstedt, Newton, NC). Neutrophils were allowed to apoptose spontaneously or were exposed to IgM anti-Fas (1 μg/ml), t-butyl hydroperoxide (100 μm), hydrogen peroxide (100 μm), or UV irradiation (10 min) in the presence or absence of fMLP (1 × 10–7m). Experiments carried out with the MEK inhibitor PD-98059 (25 μm), p38 inhibitor SB-208035 (10 μm), anti-oxidants DPI or OTC (10 μm), or protein phosphatase inhibitors, calyculin (50 μm) and okadaic acid (2 0μg/ml), used a 30-min preincubation before addition of stimuli. Apoptosis was assessed after 2 h for UV irradiation and 4 h for all other stimuli. 2 × 105 cells were diluted and cytocentrifuged at 600 rpm for 3 min onto glass slides and were stained with a modified Wright-Giemsa stain. Cells were counted as apoptotic if their nuclei lost segmentation and appeared round and darkly stained. At least 200 cells were counted per slide in a blinded fashion. The accuracy of morphological assessment was checked periodically by flow cytometric analysis of hypodiploid DNA in propidium iodide-stained neutrophils. Apoptotic percentages obtained by these two methods agreed within 5%. Mitochondria Staining—After stimulation, neutrophils were incubated with 10 mm JC-1 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 37 °C for 10 min, centrifuged, resuspended in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Increases in mean green fluorescence intensity (FL-1) correspond to a loss of fluorescent JC-1 J aggregates in the mitochondria that occurs upon decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (29Cossarizza A. Baccarani-contri M. Kalashnikova G. Franceschi C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 40-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). The increase in JC-1 green fluorescence corresponds to a decrease in JC-1 red fluorescence indicating the relative levels of J aggregates in the mitochondria. Cytochrome c Immunostaining—Human neutrophils were pretreated for 20 min with the MEK-1 inhibitor PD-98059 at which point fMLP (1 × 10–7m) and IgM anti-Fas (1μg/ml) were added for 2 h. After 2 h 75 nm Mitotracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes) was added to the sample for 15 min at 37 °C after which cells were cytospun. Cytochrome c staining was performed as described in Kennedy et al. (30Kennedy S.G. Kandel E.S. Cross T.K. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5800-5810Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) with the anti-cytochrome c antibody (1 μg/ml) (Pharmingen) and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. After fixation and cytochrome c staining, cells were washed (twice) and mounted. Images were collected with Slidebook (3I) on a Leica DMRXA microscope at ×62 magnification. Intracellular Oxidant Staining Using Dihydrorhodamine-123—Cells were resuspended at 5 × 106/ml, and dihydrorhodamine-123 (Molecular Probes) was used as described by Vowells et al. (31Vowells S.J. Sekhsaria S. Malech H.L. Shalit M. Fleisher T.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 178: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Briefly, neutrophils were preloaded with 1.0 × 10–5m dihydrorhodamine-123 for 5 min in a 37 °C shaking water bath prior to addition of stimuli, 2 μg/ml of either the monoclonal antibody Vim12 or 2LPM19c, 1 × 10–7 fMLP or 1000 units of TNFα. Following a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, cells were put on ice and analyzed by flow cytometry (FL-2, FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences). XIAP Western Blots—Cells were resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml, and samples were stimulated for 4 h with stress stimuli IgM anti-Fas (1μg/ml), t-butyl hydroperoxide (100 μm), or TNFα (1000 units/ml) in the presence or absence of fMLP (1 × 10–7m) or the proteosome inhibitor MG-132 (Calbiochem) (30 μm). fMLP-treated cells were also preincubated for 30 min with the MEK-1 inhibitor PD-98059 (25 μm) before simulation with fMLP. After 4 h cells were lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40 with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 15 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin) for 10 min on ice. Lysates were cleared and supernatants boiled for 5 min. Samples were run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and probed with 1:1000 anti-XIAP (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD). Immunoblots were visualized with ECL detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). All immunoblots were stripped as in Frasch et al. (5Frasch S.C. Nick J.A. Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Worthen G.S. Henson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8389-8397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and then reprobed with anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) to confirm equal protein levels. Measurement of Phospho-p38 and ERK—Neutrophils were resuspended at 5 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI supplemented with 1% LPS-free BSA and transferred to sterile Eppendorf tubes. Stimuli were added, monoclonal antibody Vim12 (2 μg/ml) or t-butyl hydroperoxide (100 μm), and samples were incubated at 37 °C for 20 or 40 min for p38 phosphorylation analysis. For phospho-ERK analysis, cells were stimulated with fMLP 10–7m for 45 and 90 s and 3, 6, and 12 min with or without a 30-min preincubation with the oxidant stimuli. All samples were lysed on ice in 75 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% deoxycholate, 1% Triton, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.5) supplemented with the protease inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) (Sigma) and phosphatase inhibitor sodium orthovanadate (0.02 mm) (Sigma) for 5 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were boiled for 5 min and run on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Blots were incubated overnight with antiphospho-ERK 1:1000 (Cell Signaling) or anti-phospho-p38 1:1000 (Calbiochem). Blots were then stripped according to Frasch et al. (5Frasch S.C. Nick J.A. Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Worthen G.S. Henson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8389-8397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and reprobed with anti-ERK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) 1:1000 or anti-p38 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:1000. Phospho-MEK-1 experiments were performed similarly except that blots were probed with an anti-phospho-MEK-1 antibody and reprobed for anti-MEK-1. ERK Immunoprecipitation and Kinase Assay—Lysates from isolated neutrophils, incubated with the appropriate stimulus at 37 °C, were assayed for ERK activity by using an enzyme activity reagent kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Upstate, NY) with slight modification of the provided protocol. After stimulation, 7.5 × 106 cells were centrifuged at 4 °C and lysed with ice-cold RIPA buffer (supplemented with 15 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate). Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min, and supernatants were transferred to protein A-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) beads containing 1 μg of rabbit anti-ERK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. After incubation, beads were washed twice with cold lysis buffer and once with assay buffer (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Beads were resuspended in 50 μl of assay buffer containing myelin basic protein, inhibitor mixture, 1 mCi [32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), and Mg/ATP mixture and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C with agitation. A portion of the reaction mix was transferred to P81 phosphocellulose paper, washed three times with 0.75% phosphoric acid, and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. Data Analysis—Averages and S.D. values were calculated from at least three experiments. Statistical analysis was carried out using the JMP statistical program (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The Tukey-Kramer and Dunnett's parametrical tests were used for single and multiple comparisons, respectively. ERK Inhibits Stress-induced Apoptosis Downstream of Mitochondrial Changes—Recent studies have established the importance of the ERK/MAPK pathway in protecting cells from apoptosis. Previously, we demonstrated that clustering of the β2 integrin inhibits stress-induced neutrophil apoptosis via the ERK pathway, apparently acting downstream of mitochondrial perturbation (2Whitlock B.B. Gardai S. Fadok V. Bratton D. Henson P.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1305-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 32Westermarck J. Li S.P. Kallunki T. Han J. Kahari V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2373-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To pursue the apparent divergence between ERK inhibition of apoptosis but not mitochondrial damage, we established a system by using fMLP, a stimulus known to activate ERK and inhibit stress-induced apoptosis (5Frasch S.C. Nick J.A. Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Worthen G.S. Henson P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8389-8397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), and a variety of pro-apoptotic stimuli, IgM anti-Fas and UV, to analyze the effect of ERK on apoptosis and mitochondrial function. Neutrophils were incubated with activating IgM anti-Fas in the presence or absence of fMLP and the MEK-1 inhibitor PD-98059 for 4 h, and apoptosis was assessed by morphology (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1B demonstrates the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential assessed by JC-1 fluorescence. JC-1 fluoresces green in a monomeric form; however, when it is transported into healthy mitochondria it aggregates and fluoresces red. Cells were analyzed for a decrease in red JC-1 fluorescence, indicating a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential. IgM anti-Fas treatment resulted in a marked decrease in JC-1 red fluorescence, correlating with the enhancement of apoptosis. Although fMLP treatment inhibited anti-Fas-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1A), it did not prevent the decrease in JC-1 red fluorescence (Fig. 1B). Addition of the MEK-1 inhibitor PD-98059 reversed the protective effect of fMLP on Fas-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1A) but did not alter JC-1 red fluorescence (Fig. 1B). To confirm these observations, cytochrome c loss was analyzed. Neutrophils were treated with IgM anti-Fas in the presence or absence of fMLP, and cytospins were performed and cells stained for cytochrome c. As cells apoptose, cytochrome c is released into the cytoplasm resulting in an observable reduction in cytochrome c staining in the mitochondria. Treatment with anti-Fas led to a significant decrease in cytochrome c mitochondrial staining, as well as decreased Mitotracker red staining (Fig. 1C). Although addition of fMLP inhibited apoptosis, loss of cytochrome c and Mitotracker red staining (loss of mitochondria membrane potential) was still observed. Pretreatment with PD-98059 restored anti-Fas-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1A) but did not alter cytochrome c release (Fig. 1C). Similar enhancement of apoptosis and injury to the mitochondria were seen with oxidant and TNFα stimulation as the ERK activator, fMLP or GM-CSF, inhibited apoptosis but not mitochondrial changes (data not shown). ERK Inhibits the Decrease in XIAP Caused by Pro-apoptotic Stimuli—A primary candidate for ERK regulation is XIAP of the IAP family. XIAP blocks apoptosis by binding to caspase 9, 3, and 7 and inhibiting their activity. To pursue the involvement of XIAP in neutrophil apoptosis and the ability of ERK to regulate its activity, the levels of XIAP in neutrophils exposed to various pro-apoptotic/stress stimuli was analyzed. Neutrophils were treated with TNFα, IgM anti-Fas, or the oxidant t-butyl hydroperoxide for 4 h. Cells treated with pro-apoptotic stimuli exhibited a marked decrease in XIAP levels compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2A). To determine whether the reduction of XIAP was because of degradation, the proteosome inhibitor MG-132 (30 μm) was added prior to IgM anti-Fas treatment. Cells treated with the proteosome inhibitor no longer showed a decrease in XIAP (Fig. 2B). These data support the suggestion that pro-apoptotic stimuli promote the degradation of XIAP, and this may contribute to their ability to enhance apoptosis. Fig. 2C demonstrates that ERK activation maintains XIAP levels in the presence of a stress stimulus. Neutrophils were stimulated with fMLP and exposed to IgM anti-Fas for 4 h. fMLP treatment maintained XIAP levels, whereas pretreatment with the MEK-1 inhibitor PD-98059 returned XIAP levels to those from cells treated with pro-apoptotic stimuli alone. Endogenous and Exogenous Oxidants Inhibit the Ability of ERK to Prevent Stimulated Apoptosis—Our previous studies examining the role of β2 integrin engagement in neutrophil apoptosis demonstrated that, in the absence a stress stimulus, both clustering and activation of the β2 integrin were equally anti-apoptotic (2Whitlock B.B. Gardai S. Fadok V. Bratton D. Henson P.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1305-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A significant divergence existed between β2 integrin clustering and clustering accompanied by integrin activation. Clustering activated both the PI3K/Akt and ERK pathways and inhibited stress-induced apoptosis through the ERK pathway. However, β2 integrin activation solely stimulated the PI3K/Akt pathway and paradoxically enhanced stress-induced apoptosis. The major difference between integrin clustering and clustering with activation was the intracellular oxidants elicited by β2 integrin activation (Fig. 3A). Stimulation with TNFα significantly enhanced oxidant production, whereas fMLP had little or no effect. To determine whether oxidants reversed the protective effect of ERK, neutrophils were pretreated with t-butyl hydroperoxide, H2O2, or the β2 integrin-activating antibody (Vim12) for 20 min followed by the ERK activator fMLP and then the stress stimulus, UV irradiation. Apoptosis was assessed at 2 h. The ability of fMLP to inhibit UV-induced apoptosis was reversed in the presence of the oxidant stimuli similar to that seen with the MEK-1 inhibitor PD-98059 (Fig. 3B). This effect was not unique for fMLP and UV irradiation as oxidants also reversed the ability of GM-CSF to inhibit IgM anti-Fas-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3C). Oxidant-stimulated p38 Activity Prevents the Activation of ERK—Oxidants are potent modulators of signaling and have been suggested to enhance apoptosis through the activation of p38. To determine whether oxidant inhibition of fMLP/ERK was due to p38, neutrophils were pretreated with the p38 inhibitor SB-203580 prior to oxidant exposure followed by fMLP stimulation and UV irradiation. Samples pretreated with the p38 inhibitor consistently demonstrated a restored ability of fMLP to inhibit UV-induced apoptosis in the presence of oxidants (Fig. 4A). Fig. 4B confirms that the extracellular oxidants and oxidantgenerating systems activated p38. Cells treated with the β2 integrin-activating antibody Vim12 dem"

Toward this end, 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine (DAHP) has been used as the prototypical GTPCH inhibitor. Using a novel real-time kinetic microplate assay for GTPCH activity and purified prokaryote-expressed recombinant proteins, we show that potent inhibition by DAHP is not the result of a direct interaction with GTPCH. Rather, inhibition by DAHP in phosphate buffer occurs via an indirect mechanism that requires the presence of GTPCH feedback regulatory protein (GFRP). Notably, GFRP was previously discovered as the essential factor that reconstitutes inhibition of pure recombinant GTPCH by the pathway end product BH4. Thus, DAHP inhibits GTPCH by engaging the endogenous feedback inhibitory system. We further demonstrate that l-Phe fully reverses the inhibition of GTPCH by DAHP/GFRP, which is also a feature in common with inhibition by BH4/GFRP. These findings suggest that DAHP is not an indiscriminate inhibitor of GTPCH in biological systems; instead, it is predicted to preferentially attenuate GTPCH activity in cells that most abundantly express GFRP and/or contain the lowest levels of l-Phe.

Because the activity of these enzymes is typically limited by the availability of BH4, intracellular levels of BH4 determine the rate of production of several key cell-signaling molecules including nitric oxide (NO), dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and serotonin.

The prototypical GTPCH inhibitor 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine (DAHP) has been used extensively to assess the roles of BH4 and GTPCH in physiological and pathophysiological conditions, although the exact mechanism of this inhibition has not been defined. Four decades ago, DAHP was identified as a potent inhibitor of biopterin-dependent growth of the protozoan Crithidia fasciculata (21Rembold H. Hoppe Seyler's Z Physiol. Chem. 1964; 339: 258-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Investigations of biopterin excretion in rats suggested the presence of a de novo biopterin synthesis pathway that is potently inhibited following DAHP treatment (22Pabst W. Rembold H. Hoppe Seyler's Z Physiol. Chem. 1966; 344: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Subsequently, biosynthesis of 7,8-dihydrobiopterin from GTP was demonstrated in rat brain, and the responsible multienzyme pathway was found to be inhibited by DAHP (23Gal E.M. Nelson J.M. Sherman A.D. Neurochem. Res. 1978; 3: 69-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 24Gal E.M. Sherman A.D. Neurochem. Res. 1976; 1: 627-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). DAHP-induced BH4 deficiency was later used to generate an animal model for hyperphenylalaninemia (25Cotton R.G. J. Inherit. Metab.

Additionally, DAHP has been widely used to determine the impact of BH4 availability on NO synthesis in cells in culture (27Gross S.S. Jaffe E.A. Levi R. Kilbourn R.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Because of the overt structural homology between DAHP and the GTPCH substrate GTP, the ability of DAHP to inhibit GTPCH has been assumed to result from competition for substrate binding. However, DAHP is also structurally similar to BH4 (Fig. 1) and, inasmuch as GTPCH is regulated by end product feedback inhibition, DAHP could potentially inhibit GTPCH activity by co-opting the endogenous feedback inhibitory mechanism. Feedback inhibition by BH4 is mediated by the formation of a ternary complex between BH4, GTPCH, and a protein termed GTPCH feedback regulatory protein (GFRP) (35Harada T. Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K. Science. 1993; 260: 1507-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 36Milstien S. Jaffe H. Kowlessur D. Bonner T.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19743-19751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). GTPCH is a stable decamer, and in the presence of BH4, feedback inhibition is engaged by the binding of one GFRP pentamer to each of the two pentameric faces of GTPCH. Interestingly, millimolar level concentrations of l-Phe have been shown to reverse this feedback inhibition without causing dissociation of the GFRP·GTPCH complex (37Yoneyama T. Hatakeyama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20102-20108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the absence of BH4, l-Phe triggers GFRP binding to GTPCH resulting in increased GTPCH activity at low levels of GTP substrate (35Harada T. Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K. Science. 1993; 260: 1507-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 38Yoneyama T. Brewer J.M. Hatakeyama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9690-9696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because l-Phe is potentially neurotoxic, the ability of l-Phe to stimulate GTPCH activity may have evolved to provide an abundant supply of BH4 cofactor for optimal activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase. A previous observation that DAHP-mediated inhibition of GTPCH in rat aortic smooth muscle cells is partially reversed by addition of l-Phe suggests that the mode of inhibition by DAHP may be GFRP-dependent (39Xie L. Smith J.A. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21091-21098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, DAHP has been widely assumed to selectively inhibit GTPCH activity via competition for binding substrate GTP. Utilizing a novel kinetic assay for GTPCH activity and purified recombinant rat GTPCH and GFRP from prokaryotic expression systems, we have now conducted a rigorous in vitro analysis of the mechanism of GTPCH inhibition by DAHP. Results confirm that potent GTPCH inhibition by DAHP requires GFRP and recapitulates the endogenous mechanism by which BH4 inhibits its own synthesis. Expression and Purification of Recombinant GFRP—GFRP cDNA was amplified by PCR from a rat aortic smooth muscle cell cDNA library (Invitrogen). To facilitate insertion into the pET15b expression vector (Novagen), primers for PCR were designed to include the desired restriction enzyme cut sites. The GFRP forward primer (5′-CCAGCCACTCCATATGCCCTAAA-3′) contained a site for NdeI digestion, and the GFRP reverse primer (5′-AAGTCAGCTCACTCGAGTCATTCC-3′) contained an XhoI cut site. PCR was performed by standard methods using 2 μl of DNA template and the following schedule: 95 °C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of denaturation (94 °C for 45 s), annealing (55 °C for 1 min), and elongation (72 °C for 1 min), terminating with extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The resulting PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and visualized by UV fluorescence. The predicted GFRP cDNA-containing product (255 bp) was observed and gel-purified (Bio 101, GeneClean). The purified PCR product and pET15b plasmid were both digested with NdeI and XhoI and resolved by electrophoresis. Following repurification from the gel, the GFRP insert was ligated into the plasmid using T4 DNA ligase (Invitrogen) at 24 °C overnight. On insertion of GFRP cDNA between the NdeI and XhoI sites, the resulting pET15b expression construct encodes a stretch of six His residues fused to the N terminus of GFRP. Competent DH5α Escherichia coli (Invitrogen) were transformed with the ligation product, and positive clones were selected using LB agar plates containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Correct orientation of GFRP cDNA in pET15b was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion analysis. Plasmid DNA from a positive clone was purified and used to transform the E. coli expression host strain Tuner(DE3)pLysS (Novagen). A clone transformed with the expression construct was grown in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (35 μg/ml) at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm. After the bacteria reached an A600 of 0.5–0.6, expression of the GFRP fusion protein was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) at room temperature in the dark for 18 h. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, and the resulting pellet was stored at –70 °C until needed. Frozen pellets were thawed and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.25% Tween 20) containing protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Bacteria were lysed by sonication, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 39,000 × g. The supernatant was applied to an affinity chromatography column of 3 ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic-agarose (Qiagen). The column was washed with 50 ml of lysis buffer without protease inhibitors followed by 30 ml of wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole). His6-GFRP was eluted from the column with elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 300 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole). Elution fractions were analyzed for purity by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue protein staining. Fractions containing a single strong band at the predicted molecular mass of the fusion protein (11.8 kDa) were combined and subjected to buffer exchange using Sephadex G-25 PD-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences). The fusion protein was exchanged into a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 550 mm l-Arg. The presence of l-Arg in this buffer was necessary to prevent rapid precipitation of His6-GFRP. Expression and Purification of Recombinant GTPCH—Recombinant rat GTPCH was expressed as a maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion protein and purified from E. coli as described previously (39Xie L. Smith J.A. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21091-21098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In brief, DH5α E. coli were transformed with a pMAL-P2 expression plasmid engineered to express GTPCH-MBP fusion protein. GTPCH-MBP expression was induced by growing bacteria in LB broth with 1 mm IPTG at 37 °C for 3 h. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and then lysed by sonication. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation and applied to a column of amylose resin for affinity capture of GTPCH-MBP. GTPCH-MBP was eluted from the column with 10 mm maltose and analyzed for purity using SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue protein staining. The purified fusion protein exhibited a native level of GTPCH activity at ≈40 nmol of product/min/mg protein. Kinetic Microplate Assay for GTPCH Activity—Formation of dihydroneopterin triphosphate (H2NTP), the product of GTPCH, was continually monitored using a spectrophotometry-based kinetic assay (40Kolinsky M.A. Gross S.S. Blau N. Thony B. Pterins, Folates and Neurotransmitters in Molecular Medicine. SPS Publications, Heilbronn, Germany2004: 22-27Google Scholar). A 200-μl reaction mixture consisted of the desired additions of the following components: 100 mm Na+/K+ phosphate buffer (93.5 mm Na2HPO4, 6.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.8), 0.1 μm GTPCH, 0.5 μm His6-GFRP (5-fold molar excess over GTPCH-MBP), 10 mm GTP, 1.5 mm DAHP, and 3 mml-Phe. The accumulation of H2NTP was assessed from the rate of increase in A340, measured at 15-s intervals over a 1-h period at 37 °C using a Thermomax microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). From a total of 241 data points collected, 100 were used for computer-assisted determination of the GTPCH activity Vmax. Determination of Extinction Coefficient and Standard Curve for H2NTP—Because H2NTP is neither commercially available nor readily amenable to synthesis, standards were produced by complete enzymatic conversion of the desired concentrations of GTP and a fixed excess of GTPCH (40Kolinsky M.A. Gross S.S. Blau N. Thony B. Pterins, Folates and Neurotransmitters in Molecular Medicine. SPS Publications, Heilbronn, Germany2004: 22-27Google Scholar). Assuming the final concentration of H2NTP was equal to the initial concentration of GTP, A340 values were plotted against H2NTP concentration to generate a standard curve. Beer's law was used to calculate a H2NTP working extinction coefficient of ϵ340 = 1820 m–1 cm–1 for the assay. The standards and extinction coefficient were used to establish a relationship between A340 and GTPCH activity. The extinction coefficient for GTP was also calculated (ϵ340 = 0.091 m–1 cm–1) and used to determine the extent to which absorbance of GTP interfered with the measurement of H2NTP. This absorbance by GTP was determined to be negligible because complete consumption of GTP during the reaction would cause the measured A340 to decrease by <0.1% of the total increase in OD. HPLC-based Assay for GTPCH Activity—The activity of 0.1 μm GTPCH activity was measured by spectrometry at 37 °C as described for the microplate assay above, and after 60 min, a 100-μl aliquot was withdrawn for product analysis using the conventional HPLC-based assay for H2NTP (41Werner-Felmayer G. Gross S.S. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons, Sussex, UK1996: 271-299Google Scholar). To this end, oxidation of H2NTP in the sample was achieved by treatment with 20 μlof1 m HCl and 10 μlof0.1 m KI/I2 for 1 h at 37 °C in the dark. Samples were then decolorized with 10 μl of freshly prepared ascorbic acid, neutralized with 20 μl of 1 m NaOH, and dephosphorylated for 1 h at 37 °C by treatment with alkaline phosphatase (20 μl of 16 units/ml dissolved in 50 mm MgCl2). After a 2-min microcentrifugation at 13,000 rpm, samples were subjected to C18 reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, and neopterin content was determined by comparison with a pure standard. Materials—Restriction enzymes, TaqDNA polymerase, and LB broth base were purchased from Invitrogen. BH4 was from Shircks Labs (Jona, Switzerland). DAHP, l-Phe, GTP, and all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma and were of the best grade available. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen. Development of a Novel Kinetic Microplate Assay for GTPCH Activity—H2NTP has a markedly greater A340 than the substrate GTP (42Bracher A. Schramek N. Bacher A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7896-7902Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and this feature was used for the development of a high throughput kinetic microplate assay for GTPCH activity (40Kolinsky M.A. Gross S.S. Blau N. Thony B. Pterins, Folates and Neurotransmitters in Molecular Medicine. SPS Publications, Heilbronn, Germany2004: 22-27Google Scholar). An increase in A340 was a linear function of time and GTP concentration, in the presence of a fixed amount of recombinant GTPCH enzyme (Fig. 2A). Activity was also dependant on GTPCH concentration and, after a brief lag phase, was linear for at least 60 min or until substrate GTP became rate limiting (Fig. 2B). A standard curve was generated based on complete conversion of GTP to H2NTP (Fig. 3A) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Notably, a linear relationship was established between A340 and H2NTP production (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3Development of the H2NTP standard curve.A, H2NTP standards were produced by allowing the complete conversion of known substrate concentrations to product by a fixed amount of GTPCH (1.5 μm). B, the H2NTP standard curve generated from the data in A is shown. The curve establishes a relationship between A340 and H2NTP concentration, thus allowing an estimation of GTPCH activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analysis of GTPCH Activity in the Presence of DAHP Indicates that Inhibition Is Weakly Competitive—To investigate the extent to which DAHP inhibits GTPCH activity via competition for substrate occupancy, recombinant rat GTPCH activity was analyzed over a range of GTP concentrations in the presence and absence of 1.5 mm DAHP, a concentration that effectively inhibits BH4 synthesis in cells (Fig. 4) (39Xie L. Smith J.A. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21091-21098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the absence of DAHP, the Km and Vmax for GTP utilization were 75.52 ± 9.78 μm and 46.31 ± 1.23 nmol H2NTP/min/mg protein, respectively, in accord with published values (39Xie L. Smith J.A. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21091-21098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 43Auerbach G. Herrmann A. Bracher A. Bader G. Gutlich M. Fischer M. Neukamm M.

Watanabe Y. Kagamiyama H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21660-21664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On addition of DAHP, the Km for GTP was modestly increased (100.70 ± 17.34 μm), and Vmax was unchanged (47.48 ± 1.89 nmol H2NTP/min/mg protein) as determined by nonlinear regression analysis. The very modest DAHP-induced increase in Km was considered insufficient to explain the potent attenuation of BH4 synthesis observed with 1.5 mm DAHP in cells. Inhibition of GTPCH by DAHP Is Achieved Primarily through an Indirect GFRP-dependent Mechanism—Based on the structural similarity between DAHP and BH4 (see Fig. 1), it was considered that DAHP may be acting as a BH4-mimetic to engage GFRP-mediated feedback inhibition of GTPCH (39Xie L. Smith J.A. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21091-21098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, recombinant GFRP was purified from a prokaryotic expression system (Fig. 5) and characterized with reconstituted components of the feedback inhibition system in vitro. GTPCH activity was measured in the presence of a fixed GTP concentration (10 mm) with increasing concentrations of DAHP in the presence or absence of GFRP. As shown in Fig. 6, DAHP elicited a significant and concentration-dependent inhibition of GTPCH only in the presence of GFRP, in accord with a BH4-mimetic mechanism of GTPCH inhibition. Notably, GTPCH activity was reduced by only 6.5% with DAHP (1.5 mm) alone, whereas the addition of GFRP increased inhibition to 81.4%. Conferral of enhanced GTPCH inhibition by GFRP in vitro suggests that DAHP recruits the feedback inhibitory system for potent inhibition of GTPCH in biological systems.Fig. 6Influence of GFRP on the ability of DAHP to inhibit GTPCH. The activity of recombinant rat GTPCH (1.44 μg, 0.1 μm) was measured using the microtiter plate assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The inhibitory potency of DAHP was assessed in the absence (–) or presence (+) of recombinant rat GFRP (1.15 μg, 0.5 μm). The effect of 3 mm l-Phe alone or in combination with GFRP was also determined. Note that concentration-dependent inhibition of GTPCH by DAHP is achieved only in the presence of GFRP. Reversal of inhibition by l-Phe is in accord with a GFRP-dependent mechanism akin to that established for feedback inhibition by BH4. Values are means ± S.E. from two experiments, each using triplicate determinations for each data point.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Reversal of DAHP/GFRP-mediated Inhibition by l-Phe—As discussed above, potent inhibition of GTPCH was DAHP concentration-dependent and required GFRP. The addition of increasing concentrations of l-Phe to DAHP-inhibited GTPCH resulted in complete restoration of enzymatic activity (Fig. 7). The concentration of l-Phe needed for half-maximal reversal of GTPCH inhibition was ≈1.5 mm. Notably, no detectable reversal of GTPCH inhibition was found with other aromatic amino acids, Tyr, or Trp at concentrations up to 6 mm. 2M. A. Kolinsky and S. S. Gross, unpublished observations. Similarly, BH4-mediated GFRP-dependent inhibition of GTPCH has been found to be reversed by l-Phe and by no other naturally occurring amino acids (35Harada T. Kagamiyama H. Hatakeyama K. Science. 1993; 260: 1507-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 36Milstien S. Jaffe H. Kowlessur D. Bonner T.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19743-19751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Verification of the GFRP Dependence and l-Phe Reversibility of GTPCH Inhibition by DAHP—H2NTP is a labile compound that undergoes dephosphorylation to dihydroneopterin. Inasmuch as the microplate assay for GTPCH activity relies on spectral properties of H2TNTP for quantification, we considered the possibility of an artifact because of a possible DAHP-induced alteration in H2NTP stability. Thus, we sought to verify that GFRP is required for inhibition of GTPCH by DAHP using an independent assay method. Results shown in Fig. 8A confirm that DAHP inhibition is indeed GFRP-dependent and l-Phe-reversible as demonstrated by the conventional assay for GTPCH (i.e. relying on HPLC separation and fluorescencebased detection of neopterin in chemically oxidized samples). The ≈30% decrease in total H2NTP quantified by the HPLC assay compared with the microplate assay (Fig. 8B) is routinely observed and attributed to inefficiencies in sample processing for HPLC analysis (i.e. sample oxidation, dephosphorylation, and recovery). The Molar Ratio of GFRP to GTPCH Determines the Efficacy of DAHP as a GTPCH Inhibitor—To investigate the GFRP dependence of GTPCH inhibition by DAHP, the activity of a fixed amount of GTPCH was studied in the presence of 1.5 mm DAHP and increasing amounts of GFRP. As shown in Fig. 9, the potency of DAHP was enhanced as the ratio of GFRP to GTPCH increased until a ratio of 1:1 at which point inhibition was nearly maximal. These data support the hypothesis that the extent of GFRP protein expression would dictate the degree of GTPCH inhibition by DAHP in cells and tissues. We describe a novel kinetic assay for quantification and characterization of GTPCH activity in microtiter plate wells. This assay directly and continually measures formation of H2NTP in real time, providing more detailed information on GTPCH reaction kinetics than available previously. The microplate format is conservative with respect to reagent consumption and allows for high throughput analysis of GTPCH activity simultaneously, under multiple experimental conditions. A limitation is that the assay can only be used effectively with pure or partially purified GTPCH because of interference by UV-absorbing contaminants in crude biological extracts. This constraint does not hinder our application of the assay to probe the mechanism for potent inhibition of GTPCH by DAHP. DAHP is a specific inhibitor of GTPCH activity and has been widely used to inhibit de novo BH4 synthesis in biological systems. Despite extensive use of DAHP as an inhibitor of BH4 biosynthesis, the mechanism of inhibition has never been defined experimentally; it has been assumed that inhibition is competitive based on a structural similarity of DAHP with the GTPCH substrate, GTP. It is established that in vivo GTPCH activity is subject to feedback inhibition by the pathway end product BH4. The mechanism of feedback inhibition involves the induced formation of an inhibitory complex between GTPCH and the regulatory protein GFRP. l-Phe reverses this inhibition without disrupting the inhibitory complex. The apparent structural similarity of DAHP and BH4 as well as results from previous studies conducted in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (39Xie L. Smith J.A. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21091-21098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and in vitro (45Yoneyama T. Wilson L.M. Hatakeyama K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 388: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) suggested a possible role for GFRP in the mechanism of DAHP-mediated inhibition. Based on careful analyses using pure recombinant proteins, our findings confirm that a major mode of DAHP inhibition of GTPCH is indeed dependent on GFRP. In the presence of GFRP, inhibition of GTPCH by DAHP was observed to be potent, concentration-dependent, and completely reversed by l-Phe, which are features that typify the GFRP-dependent GTPCH feedback inhibitory system. GTPCH assays described herein were routinely performed in phosphate buffer (100 mm, pH 7.8). Interestingly, when the mode of inhibition of GTPCH by DAHP was investigated in a non-phosphate buffer system (i.e. 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8), it was found to be largely competitive.2 Thus, in contrast to the present findings, inhibition of GTPCH could be observed in the absence of GFRP and was not found to be reversed by l-Phe addition. However, a very recent report (46Mitchell B.M. Dorrance A.M. Webb R.C. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 2004; 43: 758-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) shows that prolonged treatment of rats with DAHP results in a decrease in blood pressure by a mechanism that was reversed on cotreatment with l-Phe, in accord with the view that in vivo inhibition of GTPCH by DAHP is indeed GFRP-dependent. The essentially exclusive observation of GFRP-dependent inhibition of GTPCH by DAHP in phosphate buffer may be explained by the binding of phosphate itself to the GTPCH active site, limiting the binding of DAHP as a competitive inhibitor (GTP-mimetic) and switching the mode of inhibition to GFRP-mediated (BH4-mimetic). An unpublished structure of GTP-free E. coli GTPCH revealed bound inorganic phosphate that coincides with the position of the GTP γ-phosphate (47Rebelo J. Auerbach G. Bader G. Bracher A. Nar H. Hosl C. Schramek N. Kaiser J. Bacher A. Huber R. Fischer M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 503-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The contribution of physiological levels of phosphate to GTPCH regulation and interaction with GFRP awaits investigation. Data presented here strongly support the model in which, under biological conditions, DAHP is functioning as a BH4-mimetic to engage GFRP-mediated feedback inhibition of GTPCH. These results may explain in vivo disparities in the efficacy of DAHP as an inhibitor of BH4 synthesis in various tissues. The relative potency of DAHP will predictably depend on the cell content of GFRP and l-Phe. We thank Mark Crabtree for expert assistance with the HPLC-based assay for GTPCH activity."

In this study, we have generated skeletal muscle specific FKBP12-deficient mice to investigate the role of FKBP12 in skeletal muscle. Primary myotubes from these mice show no obvious change in either Ca2+ stores or resting Ca2+ levels but display decreased voltage-gated intracellular Ca2+ release and increased L-type Ca2+ currents. Consistent with the decreased voltage-gated Ca2+ release, maximal tetanic force production is decreased and the force frequency curves are shifted to the right in extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles of the mutant mice. In contrast, there is no decrease in maximal tetanic force production in the mutant diaphragm or soleus muscle. The force frequency curve is shifted to the left in the FKBP12-deficient diaphragm muscle compared with controls. No changes in myosin heavy chain (MHC) phenotype are observed in EDL or soleus muscle of the FKBP12-deficient mice, but diaphragm muscle displays an increased ratio of slow to fast MHC isoforms. Also, calcineurin levels are increased in the diaphragm of the mutant mice but not in the soleus or EDL. In summary, FKBP12 deficiency alters both orthograde and retrograde coupling between the L-type Ca2+ channel and RyR1 and the consequences of these changes depend on muscle type and activity. In highly used muscles such as the diaphragm, adaptation to the loss of FKBP12 occurs, possibly due to the increased Ca2+ influx."

This includes polydnaviruses (PDVs) that are produced in the reproductive organ of female hymenopteran endoparasitoids and are injected, together with venom proteins, into the host hemocoel at oviposition. Inside the host, PDVs enter various tissue cells and hemocytes where viral genes are expressed, leading to developmental and physiological alterations in the host, including the suppression of the host immune system. Although several studies have shown that some PDVs are only effective when accompanied by venom proteins, there is no report of an active venom ingredient(s) facilitating PDV infection and/or gene expression. In this study, we describe a novel peptide (Vn1.5) isolated from Cotesia rubecula venom that is required for the expression of C. rubecula bracoviruses (CrBVs) in host hemocytes (Pieris rapae), although it is not essential for CrBV entry into host cells. The peptide consists of 14 amino acids with a molecular mass of 1598 Da. In the absence of Vn1.5 or total venom proteins, CrBV genes are not expressed in host cells and did not cause inactivation of host hemocytes.

Endoparasitoid wasps oviposit their eggs inside the hemocoel of other insects, where their progeny is exposed to host defense reactions, which include humoral and cellular responses. Endoparasitoids have evolved effective mechanisms for successful parasitism that allow them to evade or inhibit the host immune responses (1Strand M.R. Pech L.L. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1995; 40: 31-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Maternal factors are introduced into the host hemocoel, together with eggs, during oviposition. These factors include symbiotic PDVs, 1The abbreviations used are: PDV, polydnavirus; CrBV, Cotesia rubecula bracovirus; RT, reverse transcription; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; rpHPLC, reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. calyx, and venom proteins (2Edson K.M.

Inhibition of insect immune responses may involve one or more pathways, such as changes in hemocyte population, down-regulation of phenoloxidase activity, and aberrant hemocyte morphologies (4Webb B.A. Luckhart S. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1994; 26: 147-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 5Beckage N.E. Metcalf J.S. Nesbit D.J. Schleifer K.W. Zetlan S.R. De Buron I. Insect Biochem. 1990; 20: 285-294Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Polydnaviruses associated with hymenopteran parasitoid families Ichneumonidae and Braconidae are referred to as ichnoviruses and bracoviruses (6Stoltz D.B. Vinson S.B. Adv.

The particles are only produced in the female reproductive tract and are released into the oviduct lumen and injected at oviposition into the host hemocoel, where virus genes are expressed in the absence of viral DNA replication (8Fleming J.G.W.

Virions are able to enter many host cell types (10Strand M.R. Mckenzie V. Grassl B.A. Aiken J.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 11Harwood S.H. Beckage N.E. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 685-698Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Viral transcripts are detected within a few hours following parasitization, and viral genes are either expressed transiently or persistently (10Strand M.R. Mckenzie V. Grassl B.A. Aiken J.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 12Asgari S. Hellers M. Schmidt O. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 2653-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The presence of PDVs has been shown to be essential for successful parasitism and development of parasitoids inside their hosts (2Edson K.M. Vinson S.B. Stoltz D.B. Summers M.D. Science. 1981; 211: 582-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 13Stoltz D.B. Guzo D. J. Insect Physiol. 1986; 32: 377-388Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 14Fleming J.G. Summers M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9770-9774Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). When parasitoid eggs devoid of PDVs are artificially injected into the host hemocoel, the host insect displays a cellular immune response against large exogenous objects that encapsulates the eggs (2Edson K.M. Vinson S.B. Stoltz D.B. Summers M.D. Science. 1981; 211: 582-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In endoparasitoids without PDVs, venom proteins, produced by a pair of specialized glands associated with the female reproductive organ, seem to play a major role in host immune suppression and host regulation. For example, in Pimpla hypochondriaca (Braconidae), venom adversely affects the morphology, viability, and immune function of hemocytes of the tomato moth, Lacanobia oleracea (15Richards E.H. Edwards J.P. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 557-569Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16Richards E.H. Parkinson N.M. J. Invertebr. Pathol. 2000; 76: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Venom proteins also cause developmental alterations in the host. Venom from Aphidius ervi (Braconidae) causes castration of female Acyrthosiphon pisum aphids (17Digilio M.C. Isidoro N. Tremblay E. Pennacchio F. J. Insect Physiol. 2000; 46: 1041-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In Galleria mellonella, venom from Microplitis croceipes reduces larval growth (18Gupta P. Ferkovich S.M. J. Insect Physiol. 1998; 44: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that, in certain cases, venom might have a potent immune-suppressive activity, impairing hemocyte-mediated immune responses before the expression of PDVs or interfering with the activation of the host hemolymph phenoloxidase (18Gupta P. Ferkovich S.M. J. Insect Physiol. 1998; 44: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19Webb B.A. Dahlman D.L. Arch. Insect Biochem.

In some parasitoid systems, PDVs are only effective in conjunction with venom proteins. For example, in Cotesia glomeratus (23Kitano H. J. Insect Physiol. 1986; 32: 369-375Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and Apanteles kariyai (24Tanaka T. J. Insect Physiol. 1987; 33: 413-420Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar), venom is an essential requirement for successful parasitism. In Cotesia melanoscela, it is reported that venom proteins promote the release of virions into the cytoplasm after uptake by host cells, facilitating the uncoating of PDVs at nuclear pores in host hemocytes (25Stoltz D.B. Guzo D. Belland E.R. Lucarotti C.J. MacKinnon E.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1988; 69: 903-907Crossref Google Scholar). In addition, venom proteins enhance virus persistence in the host. Four genes from Cotesia rubecula bracoviruses (CrBVs) have been found to be expressed in the host Pieris rapae, designated as CrV1–4 (12Asgari S. Hellers M. Schmidt O. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 2653-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). They are abundantly expressed in various host tissues, providing active protection by suppressing host cellular responses (26Asgari S. Schmidt O. Theopold U. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 3061-3070Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 27Glatz R. Schmidt O. Asgari S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19743-19750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A 32-kDa protein associated with particles is produced in calyx cells and covers the eggs of the parasitoid, providing passive immune protection while CrBV genes are expressed (28Asgari S. Schmidt O. J. Insect Physiol. 1994; 40: 789-795Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 29Asgari S. Theopold U. Wellby C. Schmidt O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3690-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Several novel proteins have been isolated from C. rubecula venom and found to provide immune protection by inhibiting the activation of host hemolymph prophenoloxidase and melanin formation (20Asgari S. Zareie R. Zhang G. Schmidt O. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 2003; 53: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Asgari S. Zhang G. Zareie R. Schmidt O. Insect Biochem. Mol.

However, there is little known about the functional relationship between CrBVs and venom proteins in this host-parasitoid system. In the present study, we found that venom proteins are essential for the expression of CrBV genes in host cells, although not required for virus entry. A novel venom peptide consisting of 14 amino acids with a molecular mass of 1598 Da (Vn1.5) was found to be sufficient for CrBV gene expression in host cells. In the absence of Vn1.5, CrBV gene transcription was not detected, and hemocyte behavior was not changed, despite the entrance of viruses into the cells. Insect Cultures—The endoparasitoid wasps, C. rubecula (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) and its host insect were maintained at 25 °C, on a 14:10 hour (light:dark) photoperiod. P. rapae (Lepidoptera: Pieridae) larvae were reared on cabbage plants. Adult wasps were fed with honey-water solution (28Asgari S. Schmidt O. J. Insect Physiol. 1994; 40: 789-795Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Bracovirus Isolation—CrBVs were purified from newly emerged female wasps as described previously (30Beckage N.E. Tan F.F. Schleifer K.W. Lane R.D. Cherubin L.L. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1994; 26: 165-195Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated ovaries were macerated in PBS (138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.47 mm KH2PO4, and 7.3 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) by using micro-scissors. The suspension was centrifuged at 750 × g for 5 min to exclude large cellular debris. The homogenate was then passed through a 0.45-μm syringe filter (Ministart®) and centrifuged at 15,800 × g in a desktop centrifuge for 20 min. The pelleted virus particles were resuspended in PBS. Reverse Phase High Pressure Liquid Chromatography—Venom reservoirs from 50 female C. rubecula wasps were dissected and disrupted in PBS by micro-scissors to release venom proteins into the buffer solution. Reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (rpHPLC) of samples was carried out in a Hewlett Packard 1090 liquid chromatograph. The crude venom sample was loaded onto a Vydac reverse phase C18 column and eluted at the flow rate of 0.2 ml/min using a gradient of 5–100% of buffer B (0.04% trifluoroacetic acid in 70% acetonitrile) against buffer A (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in water) over 82 min. The collected fractions were detected by absorbance at 214 nm, and protein fractions were collected manually. For in vitro hemocyte infection assays (see below), individual fractions were vacuum-dried and dissolved in sterile water. Mass Spectrometry—To determine the molecular mass of venom peptides, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was carried out by using a PE Sciex API-100. Generally, an amount equivalent to ∼7 pmol of purified protein was directly infused, and the resulting raw data were analyzed using the BioMultiView 3.1.1 software. Peptide Sequencing—Approximately 100 pmol of the purified peptides from rpHPLC was vacuum-dried, reconstituted in 8 m urea containing 0.1 m NH4HCO3 and 4 mm dithiothreitol, and finally alkylated by the addition of sodium iodoacetate to the final concentration of 10 mm. The sample was acidified with trifluoroacetic acid to stop the reaction. Peptide sequencing was carried out using a Hewlett Packard G1000A protein sequencer. Peptide Vn1.5 Synthesis—Vn1.5 was synthesized by Auspep Pty. Ltd. and analyzed by mass spectral analysis for molecular weight and purity. The lyophilized peptide was reconstituted in sterile water. Various concentrations of the peptide were used in CrBV infection of hemocytes (see below). CrBV Infection of Hemocytes in Vitro—Fourth instar P. rapae larvae were surface sterilized in 70% ethanol and bled into cold PBS (saturated with 1-phenyl-2-thiourea to prevent melanization) by removing one of the forelegs. Hemocytes were collected by centrifuging the hemolymph at 750 × g for 5 min and removing the serum. The cells were resuspended in 100 μl of HyQ-SFX insect cell culture medium (HyClone) per insect, bled, and transferred into a 24-well tissue culture plate. 200 μl of the cell suspension containing ∼500 cells were allowed to attach for about half an hour at room temperature. Purified CrBVs, equivalent of two wasps, were added to each well. In different treatments, total venom proteins, individual peptides, or mixtures of purified peptides were also added to the cells and mixed by gently pipetting up and down. The cells were incubated for an additional 6 h at 25 °C, after which they were collected by resuspending the cells in the medium and centrifuging at 750 × g for 5 min. Total RNA was then isolated from the cells for reverse transcription-PCR or slot blot assays. DNA and RNA Isolation—DNA was isolated from cells by homogenization in a Tris buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS, pH 8.0. Proteinase K was added to a final concentration of 0.25 μg/μl. The samples were incubated at 37 °C overnight and then treated with RNase A at 37 °C for an additional 30 min. The samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform, and then 2 volumes of ethanol and 0.2 volume of 3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.3) were added to precipitate the DNA. The mixtures were incubated on wet ice for 15 min and centrifuged at 15,800 × g for 20 min. Pellets were washed with 70% ethanol, dried at 37 °C for 5 min, and resuspended in 30 μl of water. Total RNA was isolated from hemocytes as described by Ausubel et al. (31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1 and 2. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1993Google Scholar). Reverse Transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)—Two pairs of primers (CrV1-F and CrV1-R (12Asgari S. Hellers M. Schmidt O. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 2653-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and CrV2-F and CrV2-R (32Glatz R. Schmidt O. Asgari S. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 2873-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar)) specific to the two CrBV genes, CrV1 and CrV2, were used in reverse transcription reactions using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. In a total volume of 10.7 μl, 2 μg of extracted RNA plus 0.1 μg of primer was heated at 95 °C for 5 min to denature RNA before being cooled immediately on ice. After that, 3 μl of 5× avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcription buffer, 0.5 μl of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (9 units/μl, Promega), 0.5 μl of RNasin (40 units/μl) and 0.5 μl of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (15 mm) were added. The reactions were carried out at 42 °C for 1 h followed by 95 °C for 5 min to inactivate the reverse transcriptase. The resulting DNA fragments were then used in a PCR amplification by adding 5 μl of 10× reaction buffer, 1 μl of forward primer (0.1 μg/μl), 1 μl of reverse primer (0.1 μg/μl), 0.5 μl of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (15 mm), 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) and 27.5 μ l of H2O. After 5 min at 94 °C, 35 amplification cycles were run, including denaturing at 94 °C for 50 s, annealing at 56 °C for 50 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1.5 min. The final extension at 72 °C was carried out for 10 min. All reaction products were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels and visualized by using ethidium bromide. DNA and RNA Slot Blot Hybridization—DNA or RNA samples were blotted onto a nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) under denaturing conditions according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). The blots were prehybridized and then hybridized with 32P-labeled PCR products encoding CrV1 (∼900 bp) and CrV2 (∼900 bp) at 65 °C overnight. For RNA slot blots, a P. rapae ribosomal 18 S DNA fragment probe was used as a control. Hemocyte Behavior Changes after CrBV Infection with or without Vn1.5—Hemocytes were collected as described above and resuspended in 120 μl of HyQ-SFX insect cell culture medium (HyClone) per insect equivalent. 30 μl of a cell suspension containing ∼80 cells was transferred into each well of a multiwell plate and incubated for 10 min to allow the cells to attach. Four treatments were set up by adding the following ingredients to the cell monolayers: 1) purified CrBVs and synthesized Vn1.5, 2) CrBVs and total venom proteins, 3) CrBVs alone, and 4) PBS. The cells were incubated for an additional 6 h at 25 °C, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and observed under a phase contrast microscope. Transmission Electronic Microscopy—Hemocyte monolayers were inoculated with purified CrBVs plus synthesized Vn1.5 or with CrBVs alone as above for 2 h at 25 °C. The cells were then fixed overnight in 4% glutaraldehyde (electron microscope grade) in PBS, with 4% sucrose at pH 7.2. The cells were washed in PBS plus 4% sucrose (2 changes of solution for 10 min each). The samples were post-fixed in 2% osmium tetroxide (OsO4) for 1 h on a rotator and dehydrated in ethanol and propylene oxide. The samples were embedded in resin, and micrographs were taken by using a Jeol 1010 transmission electron microscope. Venom Is Required for CrBV Gene Expression—To show whether venom components are essential for CrBV gene expression in host cells, in vitro assays were carried out using P. rapae hemocytes. Specific primers from the CrV1 coding region, which is highly expressed in host hemocytes 6 h following parasitization (12Asgari S. Hellers M. Schmidt O. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 2653-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), were used as markers in RT-PCR reactions. When hemocytes were infected with purified CrBV particles isolated from female wasps, no CrV1 transcripts were detected in cells after 6 h (Fig. 1A). However, when CrBV particles were added to cells together with venom fluid, CrV1 was expressed strongly (Fig. 1A). The results were confirmed by three independent repeats of the experiment. In addition, slot blot hybridization, using CrV1 cDNA as a probe, showed that the gene is not expressed in inoculated hemocytes in the absence of venom (Fig. 1B). This indicated that venom components are required for CrBV gene expression of host cells, although they are not essential for CrBV entry into host cells (see below). rpHPLC Separation of Venom Proteins and Bioassays— When crude venom preparations from female C. rubecula endoparasitoids were fractionated on a rpHPLC column, more than a dozen peptides and proteins were identified (Fig. 2A). To examine which venom component(s) are involved in CrBV function, we collected 12 main fractions and arbitrarily divided the fractions into three groups (Fig. 2A; a, 1–4; b, 5–8; and c, 9–12), each containing four major fractions. The eluted proteins corresponding to each fraction were vacuum-dried and resuspended in sterile water. Proteins or peptides from each group were mixed together (equivalent to two wasps) and applied together with purified CrBV particles to hemocyte monolayers. After 6 h, total RNA was isolated from the inoculated cells and subjected to RT-PCR using CrV1-specific primers. CrV1 transcripts were detected in inoculated cells when a mixture of the 12 fractions was added together with purified CrBVs (Fig. 3A). However, when a mixture of individual groups was added together with purified CrBVs, CrV1 transcripts were only found in group A and not in the other two groups (Fig. 3B). Because component(s) required for CrBV infection are in group A, individual fractions from this group were used in a subsequent assay. CrV1 transcripts were found in cells infected with CrBVs in the presence of fractions 1, 3, or 4 (Fig. 3C). All subsequent experiments were performed with fraction 1. Mass Spectrometry and Peptide Sequence Analyses—The size of the peptide in fraction 1 isolated on rpHPLC (Fig. 2A) was determined by mass spectrometry to be 1598 Da and designated Vn1.5. The peptide was also N-terminally sequenced, providing 14 amino acids (Fig. 2B) with the predicted molecular weight matching the mass of the peptide determined by mass spectrometry. The estimated isoelectric point of Vn1.5 is 10.01. The sequence of Vn1.5 was compared with other proteins and peptides in protein databases, but no significant similarity was found. Attemps to N-terminally sequence fractions 2–4 only produced amino acid sequences in fraction 2. The other two fractions might contain proteins/peptides that are N-terminally blocked. Sequence analysis of fraction 2 produced 14 amino acids (Fig. 2C) with the predicted molecular mass of 1640 Da and a theoretical pI of 6.18. The mass of the peptide was also analyzed by mass spectrometry and determined as 1640 Da, indicating that the sequence contained the full-length sequence. We designated this peptide Vn1.6. Effect of Synthetic Peptide Vn1.5 on the CrBV Gene Expression—To further confirm the function of Vn1.5 in CrBV gene expression, the peptide was synthesized and used for in vitro bioassays. Hemocytes were inoculated with purified CrBV particles in the presence or absence of synthetic Vn1.5. To examine possible concentration dependence, three different magnitudes of peptide concentrations 5 μg/ml, 0.5 mg/ml, and 50 mg/ml were applied. CrV1 transcripts were detected in treated cells at all three concentrations (Fig. 4A). Although the intensity of signals increased slightly with the increase in concentration (Fig. 4), the difference in gene expression did not reflect three magnitudes in peptide concentrations. These results further confirmed that Vn1.5 alone was sufficient to promote the expression of CrBV genes at low concentrations. To examine whether other CrBV genes were also dependent on the venom peptide for their expression, we used CrV2 coding DNA as a probe. When CrV2-specific primers were used for RT-PCR, CrV2 transcripts were also detected in the infected cells in the presence of 1.5 μg/ml Vn1.5 or total venom proteins equivalent to one wasp (Fig. 5). Conversely, no transcript was detected in cells inoculated with CrBVs alone. Hemocyte Changes after CrBV Incubation with or without Vn1.5—We have shown previously that CrBVs do not cause cell death in host hemocytes (12Asgari S. Hellers M. Schmidt O. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 2653-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 26Asgari S. Schmidt O. Theopold U. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 3061-3070Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The main effect observed in hemocytes after parasitization and infection by CrBVs was a breakdown of cell cytoskeleton, which precluded the spreading and encapsulation responses. To further confirm the effect of Vn1.5 on the expression of CrBV genes, hemocyte changes, such as spreading behavior after CrBV infection with or without the synthetic peptide, were investigated. When hemocytes from P. rapae were incubated with purified CrBV particles or Vn1.5 (1.5 μg/ml) for 6 h, the cells spread and aggregated extensively, similar to the control. However, when hemocytes were incubated with a mixture of purified CrBV particles and Vn1.5 for 6 h, the hemocytes were dispersed and spread less frequently on the glass surface compared with the control (Fig. 6), which is reminiscent of the hemocyte behavior after natural parasitization (12Asgari S. Hellers M. Schmidt O. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 2653-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 26Asgari S. Schmidt O. Theopold U. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 3061-3070Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This further confirms the role of Vn1.5 in facilitating the expression of CrBV genes at the functional level. Electron Microscopy—To examine whether CrBV particles are able to enter host cells in the absence of venom components, hemocytes were inoculated with purified particles and the cytoplasm analyzed for the presence of electron-dense particles, using transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 7). Under these conditions, electron-dense particles are detected in endosomes, free of membranes in the cytoplasm, and associated with nuclear membranes (Fig. 7B), similar to naturally infected hemocytes (25Stoltz D.B. Guzo D. Belland E.R. Lucarotti C.J. MacKinnon E.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1988; 69: 903-907Crossref Google Scholar). This implies that the peptide might be involved in chromatin restructuring or uncoating of the virus genome at the nuclear membrane. Alternatively, the peptide may be required for viral gene expression at the transcriptional level (e.g. as a transcription factor). Further investigations are required to elucidate the exact mechanism by which Vn1.5 facilitates CrBV gene expression in host cells. In contrast to insect ectoparasitoid-host interactions, where venom has a paralyzing function, venom has a different function in endoparasitoids, where it is mainly involved in alterations of host physiology. In addition, depending on whether or not endoparasitoids produce virus-like particles, such as PDVs, venom may complement or replace PDV functions in host regulation. For example, venom from P. hypochondriaca (Braconidae), which seems to lack any virus-like particles, adversely affects the morphology, viability, and the immune function of hemocytes of the tomato moth, Lacanobia oleracea (16Richards E.H.

In endoparasitoids with PDVs, a combination of maternal factors suppresses host immune responses, and venom proteins play a synergistic role with PDVs (23Kitano H. J.

In C. melanoscela, total venom was found to promote the release of virions into the cytoplasm of infected host cells and enhanced persistence of the virus in the host (25Stoltz D.B. Guzo D. Belland E.R. Lucarotti C.J. MacKinnon E.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1988; 69: 903-907Crossref Google Scholar). In C. rubecula, maternal factors introduced into the body of the host at oviposition are essential for successful completion of parasitism. An immunosuppressive gene (CrV1) from C. rubecula bracoviruses is involved in the destabilization of cytoskeleton in host hemocytes (12Asgari S. Hellers M. Schmidt O. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 2653-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 26Asgari S. Schmidt O. Theopold U. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 3061-3070Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In addition, a calyx protein (Crp32) on the surface of CrBV particles and eggs provides short term protection against host encapsulation reactions before CrBV genes are expressed (28Asgari S. Schmidt O. J. Insect Physiol. 1994; 40: 789-795Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 29Asgari S. Theopold U. Wellby C. Schmidt O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3690-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). When crude venom preparations isolated from female C. rubecula endoparasitoid wasps were separated by rpHPLC, over a dozen proteins were found, some of which are involved in the inhibition of melanization by blocking the activation of prophenoloxidase (20Asgari S. Zareie R. Zhang G. Schmidt O. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 2003; 53: 92-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 21Asgari S. Zhang G. Zareie R. Schmidt O. Insect Biochem. Mol.

In the present study, we explored the interaction between venom proteins and CrBVs with regard to virus entry and gene expression. When P. rapae hemocytes were incubated with CrBVs in vitro in the presence or absence of venom proteins, viral transcripts were only detected in infected cells in conjunction with venom proteins. It is clear that venom is required for CrBV expression in host cells, although electron microscopy observations revealed that venom components were not essential for CrBV entry into host cells. Using various mixtures of venom proteins separated on rpHPLC, we found that a 1598-Da peptide (Vn1.5) was sufficient for the expression of CrBV genes when used together with purified particles in in vitro assays. However, another peptide from C. rubecula venom consisting of 14 amino acids and a molecular mass of 1640 Da (Vn1.6) did not support expression of CrBV genes. Considering that the peptide is similar in size to Vn1.5, this indicates that only specific peptides are able to support the expression of CrBV genes. Vn1.5 is basic and hydrophobic, whereas Vn1.6 is acidic. These or other biochemical properties of Vn1.5 might contribute to its ability to facilitate CrBV expression. In addition to Vn1.5, two other fractions were also found to equally promote expression of viral genes. Whether these fractions contain proteins/peptides that have biochemical properties similar to Vn1.5 that facilitate the expression of CrBV genes remains to be investigated. Synthetic Vn1.5 peptides in conjunction with purified virus were shown to facilitate the expression of CrBV genes, whereas synthetic peptides or CrBV particles alone were not able to cause behavioral changes in hemocytes. This suggests that calyx-derived virus particles and venom-derived Vn1.5 peptides are both required to express CrBV genes in host hemocytes, similar to natural parasitism (12Asgari S. Hellers M. Schmidt O. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 2653-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 26Asgari S. Schmidt O. Theopold U. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 3061-3070Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Transmission electron microscopy observations showed that venom proteins, including Vn1.5, are not required for the virus entry, release into the cytoplasm from endosomes, or attachment to the nuclear membrane of CrBVs. This suggests that the peptide might facilitate virus chromatin restructuring, uncoating of genomic DNA at the nuclear pore, or expression of CrBV genes at transcriptional level. Further investigations are required to elucidate the exact involvement of Vn1.5 and perhaps other venom proteins in facilitating the expression of polydnaviral genes. However, this is the first report of the characterization of a venom peptide from an endoparasitoid wasp involved in promoting the expression of polydnavirus genes at the molecular and functional level. We thank Dr. Jelle Lahnstein for his help in rpHPLC and peptide microsequencing and Dr. Reza Zareie for mass spectrometry."
https://openalex.org/W2120349066,"Glutathione depletion by inhibition of its synthesis with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) is a focus of the current research in antitumor therapy, BSO being used as chemosensitizer. We had previously shown that two human tumor cell lines (U937 and HepG2) survive to treatment with BSO: BSO can elicit an apoptotic response, but the apoptotic process is aborted after cytochrome c release and before caspase activation, suggesting the development of an adaptive response (FASEB J., 1999, 13, 2031-2036). Here, we investigate the mechanisms of such an adaptation. We found that following BSO, U937 up-regulate Bcl-2 mRNA and protein levels, by a mechanism possibly involving NF-kappaB transcription factor; the increase in protein level is limited by a rapid decay of Bcl-2 in BSO-treated cells, suggesting that redox imbalance speeds up Bcl-2 turnover. BSO-dependent Bcl-2 up-regulation is associated with the ability to survive to BSO. Indeed, 1) its abrogation by CAPE or protein synthesis inhibition sensitizes U937 to BSO; 2) in a panel of four tumor lines, BSO-resistant (U937, HepG2, and HGB1) but not BSO-sensitive (BL41) cells can up-regulate Bcl-2 following GSH depletion; remarkably, only the latter are chemosensitized by BSO."

Deposition of proteins as insoluble amyloid aggregates in tissues is a common feature in a wide range of important human diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, type II diabetes, and the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (1Stefani M. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 678-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). Proteinaceous fibrils are central components of the amyloid deposits, being typically composed of linear, unbranched, and non-covalent aggregates of a single polypeptide chain arranged in crossed β-pleated sheets (2Padrick S.B. Miranker A.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 9: 4694-4703Crossref Scopus (282) Google Scholar). By mechanisms that are still incompletely understood, amyloid deposition leads to cell dysfunction and death, and, ultimately, to severe tissue damage in amyloid diseases.Islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) 1The abbreviations used are: IAPP, islet amyloid polypeptide; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; TFE, 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol; ThT, thioflavin T; rhIAAP, recombinant mature human IAAP; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight; Trx, thioredoxin. 1The abbreviations used are: IAPP, islet amyloid polypeptide; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; TFE, 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol; ThT, thioflavin T; rhIAAP, recombinant mature human IAAP; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight; Trx, thioredoxin. or amylin is a 37-amino acid peptide produced by pancreatic islet β-cells (3Kapurniotu A. Biopolymers. 2001; 60: 438-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). IAPP is synthesized, packaged within secretory granules and co-secreted with insulin by the islet β-cells in response to elevations in plasma glucose levels (4Hayden M.R. Tyagi S.C. J. Pancreas. 2001; 2: 129-139Google Scholar). The IAPP gene, located in chromosome band 12p12.3-p12.1, is transcribed as a 1.5-kb message that codes for an 89-amino acid precursor protein (pro-IAPP), which is subsequently processed to yield the mature polypeptide (5Krampert M.

Previous studies have suggested that proprotein convertases PC3 (also known as PC1) and PC2 are responsible for processing the prohormone to the active secreted form of IAPP (6Higham C.E. Hull R.L.

Although it has been proposed that PC2 is primarily responsible for IAPP processing within secretory granules (7Badman M.K. Shennan K.I. Jermany J.L. Docherty K. Clark A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), both PC3 and PC2 are likely to be responsible for pro-IAPP processing (8Wang J. Xu J. Finnerty J. Furuta M. Steiner D.F.

In vitro, IAPP has a strong tendency to aggregate into amyloid fibrils, and has recently been described as the most amyloidogenic polypeptide known (12Kayed R. Bernhagen J. Greenfield N. Al-Abed Y. Teichberg S. Frank R.W. Voelter W. Bucala R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 781-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The molecular determinants of the aggregation of IAPP are not yet fully understood. In vitro, IAPP aggregation follows a kinetics that is consistent with a nucleation-dependent polymerization mechanism (5Krampert M. Bernhagen J. Schmucker J. Horn A. Schmauder A. Brunner H.

Thus, chemical synthesis or recombinant expression and purification of IAPP in sufficient amounts for such studies constitute important steps toward the elucidation of the mechanisms of amyloidogenicity. However, the chemical synthesis of amyloidogenic peptides is often difficult (13Nilsson M.R. Nguyen L.L. Raleigh D.P. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 288: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and production of most of them, including IAPP, in the recombinant form has not yet been achieved. A recent study by Krampert et al. (5Krampert M. Bernhagen J. Schmucker J. Horn A. Schmauder A. Brunner H. Voelter W. Kapurniotu A. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 855-871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) reported the bacterial expression of recombinant human proIAPP fused to a histidine tag, but that fusion product was found to be markedly less amyloidogenic than native IAPP. Another recent report described the expression and purification of a recombinant MBP (maltose-binding protein)-IAPP fusion protein, failing in the attempts to express the intact, mature human IAPP (14Mazor Y. Gilead S. Benhar I. Gazit E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 1013-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Here, we report the successful expression, purification and characterization of human mature IAPP utilizing the LacI-T7 RNA polymerase-based heterologous expression system for Escherichia coli. The solution conformation and the amyloidogenic and cytotoxic potentials of recombinant mature human IAPP (rhIAPP) were characterized using a variety of biochemical and biophysical methods, including light scattering, thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence measurements, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and cytotoxicity assays using primary cultures of human β-cells. The approach described here is likely to be useful for the recombinant expression of other amyloidogenic peptides or proteins that are difficult to obtain by chemical synthesis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—The pET bacterial expression system used is from Novagen Corp. (Madison, WI). Primers were synthesized by Invitrogen (São Paulo, Brazil). Molecular biology enzymes and reagents were from Amersham Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden), Invitrogen, Novagen, and Fermentas Ltd. (Vilnius, Lithuania). Thioflavin T, enterokinase, CMRL cell culture medium, and all other reagents were from Sigma. Human synthetic IAPP was purchased from Bachem Inc. (Torrance, CA). Predistilled water was filtered and deionized through a Millipore purification system.Cloning of N-tagged Human Mature IAPP—A 151-bp DNA fragment containing the coding sequence for the mature IAPP peptide was amplified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from 5 μg of total RNA from human pancreatic islets purified at the Human Islet Unit of the University of São Paulo. Total RNA was purified after cell lysis with guanidine thiocyanate/β-mercaptoethanol followed by ultracentrifugation on a cesium chloride cushion (41Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. McDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16620) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription was carried out with SuperScript II (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PCR amplification was performed with Platinum Taq High Fidelity (Invitrogen) using an initial denaturing step at 95 °C for 1 min, followed by 35 cycles of incubation at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 15 s, and a final extension step of 5 min at 68 °C. Forward and reverse primers corresponding to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the human mature IAPP coding sequence (IAPP-F: 5′-AGA TCT GGG TAC CGA CGA CGA CGA CAA GAA ATG CAA CAC TGC CAC AT-3′; IAPP-R: 5′-GTC GAC TCA ATA TGT ATT GGA TCC CAC GTT GGT AG-3′) were designed to contain BglII and SalI restrictions sites (underlined) for directional and in-frame cloning, as well as a stop codon inserted in-frame after the last residue (italic). An enterokinase (Ek) cleavage site coding sequence (in bold) was also added to the forward oligo immediately before the first amino acid residue of IAPP in order to allow cleavage of mature IAPP from the vector-encoded protein tag.The resulting 151-bp PCR product generated was cloned into the pUC 18 plasmid vector and ligated to the pET32a vector, which was previously digested with the same enzymes and dephosphorylated. Therefore, in this cloning strategy, the Ek site from the vector was removed and replaced by the Ek site-containing PCR insert. Therefore, IAPP was expressed as an N-fusion protein with the vector-encoded HT-TRX-S tag. The ligated product was electroporated into competent DH10B E. coli. A recombinant clone (pET32a-IAPP) was isolated and characterized by restriction digestion and automated sequencing.Bacterial Expression and Purification—The pET32a-IAPP plasmid containing the IAPP fusion protein was used for transformation of competent BL21(DE3)pLysS cells by electroporation. These cells were grown at 37 °C in a bioreactor in 1 liter of Super Broth medium (20 g of tryptone, 12 g of yeast extract, 5 ml of NaOH, 5 g of NaCl) containing ampicillin (150 μg/ml). When the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.6 (∼1.7 × 108 cells/ml), isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 6 h of induction at 37 °C, the medium was centrifuged at 5,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 500 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm imidazole buffer, pH 7.4. Cells were lysed using an ultrasonic homogenizer (Vibracell 72412; Bioblock, Illkirch, France) at 20 kHz, using a 19-mm probe, and ten 1-minute pulses on ice, with 2-min intervals between pulses. The material was kept on ice throughout the lysis step. The suspension was centrifuged at 18,000 × g at 4 °C for 40 min in order to pellet the inclusion bodies containing IAPP. The pellet was then resuspended in 250 ml of the same buffer containing 6 m urea and incubated overnight at 4 °C for solubilization of the inclusion bodies. To remove any remaining insoluble material, the sample was centrifuged at 39,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The clear supernatant was collected, filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane and used for IAPP purification on an immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography column, using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose (Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of 6 m urea.The Ni-NTA column was washed with 3 bed volumes of the buffer described above in the absence of urea followed by three washes with the same buffer plus 6 m urea, using a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column was then loaded with 300 ml of solubilized IAPP at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. After loading, the column was washed with 3 bed volumes of washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, pH 7.4) plus 6 m urea. Urea was slowly removed using a discontinuous gradient (from 6 to 0 m urea) in the same washing buffer. The IAPP fusion protein was cleaved with enterokinase within the column to remove the thioredoxin and His tags. Enterokinase (1 unit) was loaded onto the column in the cleavage buffer containing: 10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0, and the cleavage reaction was carried out for 18 h at 25 °C. The purified rhIAPP was eluted with a solution of 50% (v/v) 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE) in the same cleavage buffer. The concentration of pure rhIAPP fractions was determined from the UV absorbance at 280 nm, considering a molar extinction coefficient of 1.330 m–1 cm–1.Electrophoresis Systems—Analysis of fractions obtained at various steps of the expression and purification process was carried out using SDS-PAGE or Tricine electrophoresis (20Schägger H. Jagow G.V. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10442) Google Scholar). Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or silver staining was used to visualize the proteins bands.Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time of Flight (MALDI-TOF) Analysis—Aliquots of purified rhIAPP were analyzed on an ABI 4700 Analyzer with TOF-TOF Optics (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA) at the National Synchrotron Laboratory (LNLS). 3 μl of purified peptide solution (∼5 pmol) were mixed with 6 μl of matrix solution (5 mg of α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid (Aldrich) in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and placed on the sample plate to dry. Calibration and mass measurements of the rhIAPP samples were carried out in the linear mode. Calibration of the instrument in the low molecular mass range was carried out using Calibration Mixture 3 from the Peptide Mass Standard Kit number 3 (Applied Biosystems).Peptide Aggregation—Stock IAPP solutions were maintained in 50% TFE. Aggregation was triggered by diluting aliquots of the stock solution in buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (prefiltered on a 0.45-μm filter), to a final concentration of 2.5 μm IAPP (residual TFE concentration of 1%).For cytotoxicity assays, lyophilized synthetic IAPP (Bachem) was resuspended to a final concentration of 3 mm in 50% TFE immediately prior to the addition to the cell cultures. Alternatively, the fresh stock solution of rhIAPP was diluted to a final concentration of 60 μm in the cultures. The residual TFE concentration in the culture was ≤ 1.2% (v/v) in both conditions. Control assays showed no effects of these low concentrations of residual TFE on cell viability.Fluorescence Measurements—IAPP aggregation and formation of amyloid fibrils were determined by right-angle light scattering (LS) and thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence measurements using an ISS-PC spectrofluorometer (Hitachi F-4500). The samples were incubated in a dry bath at 37 °C for the duration of the experiment (up to 120 h). LS was measured at 500 nm. ThT was added to a final concentration of 5 μm and the fluorescence signal (excitation at 450 nm) was recorded between 482 and 487 nm (42LeVine H. Amyloid: Int. J. Exp. Clin. Invest. 1995; 2: 1-6Crossref Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 43Naiki H. Nakakuki K. Lab. Invest. 1996; 74: 374-383PubMed Google Scholar). Nonspecific background fluorescence was subtracted from the samples by using appropriate blanks not containing protein.Cell Culture and Cytotoxicity Assays—Purified human islet cells were obtained at the Human Islet Unit (University of São Paulo, Brazil) by collagenase digestion according to the Edmonton protocol (44Shapiro A.M. Lakey J.R. Ryan E.A. Korbutt G.S. Toth E. Warnock G.I. Kneteman N.M. Rajotte R.V. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 343: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (4311) Google Scholar). Islet cells were plated onto 48-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells per well in CMRL medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin and 100 units/ml of streptomycin. After 24 h, the plates were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8 mm Na2PO4, pH 7.4) and the concentration of serum was lowered to 0.5% before addition of IAPP to the cultures at the concentrations indicated under “Results.” Untreated control cultures received the same volume of phosphate-buffered saline. The cultures were further incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 72 h, and then carefully washed with phosphate-buffered saline to remove the dead cells, collected by trypsinization, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde and counted in a CELM CCS 530 electronic cell counter (CELM, São Paulo, Brazil). The data were statistically evaluated using analysis of variance and Student's t test. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant.Electron Microscopy (EM)—Samples of IAPP which had undergone aggregation for 72 h were applied to Formvar-coated nickel grids for 2 min and dried. These samples were negatively stained with 2% (v/v) uranyl acetate for 45 s and washed with a drop of water. The samples were air-dried and examined on a Zeiss 900 electron microscope operated at 80 kV.RESULTSDesign of the Recombinant Human IAPP—We used the pET E. coli expression system and the BL21(DE3)pLysS-pET host strain to produce mature IAPP (Fig. 1). This system has been shown to efficiently suppress unwanted expression of potentially toxic proteins and to produce high levels of recombinant protein products in an inducible fashion (15Studier F.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 219: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). For this purpose, RT-PCR was employed to generate a cDNA fragment encoding the mature IAPP (Fig. 2). Modifications at the 5′-end of the PCR oligonucleotides were introduced for in-frame and directional subcloning of the amplified fragment and to allow proteolytic cleavage of the recombinant fusion protein. BglII and SalI sites were introduced in the forward and reverse oligonucleotides, respectively, in order to allow for in-frame cloning of the fragment with the vector-encoded HT-TRX-S tag. In addition, the enterokinase cleavage site was removed from the vector, and another cleavage site was inserted into the forward oligo in-frame and juxtaposed to the first IAPP amino acid (Fig. 1B). This prevented the addition of a dipeptide tail to the N-terminal of IAPP that would otherwise be inserted in case the vector-encoded Ek site was used instead of the Ek site added to the primer. High fidelity RT-PCR using total RNA extracted from human pancreatic islets yielded the cDNA in a clear, single band of 151 bp, as expected (Fig. 2B). This fragment was cloned into the pUC18 vector and subcloned into the pET32a bacterial expression vector. The IAPP insert was restriction digested and subjected to automated DNA sequencing of both strands of both the vector and the inserted primers in order to check the integrity of the cloned sequence and the correct reading frame relative to the vector encoded protein tag (data not shown).Fig. 2Cloning by RT-PCR of the cDNA for mature human IAPP.Panel A, schematic representation of the cloning strategy showing the two primers for amplification of the coding region for mature IAPP.

DiBlasio-Smith E.A. Kovacic S. Grant K.L. Schendel P.F. McCoy J.M. Biotechnology (NY). 1993; 11: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Previous reports have shown that fusion to Trx dramatically increases the solubility of heterologous proteins synthesized in E. coli, with Trx fusion proteins usually accumulating to high levels (16LaVallie E.R. DiBlasio-Smith E.A. Kovacic S. Grant K.L. Schendel P.F. McCoy J.M. Biotechnology (NY). 1993; 11: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). In an attempt to improve the solubility and the rate of expression of IAPP, a Trx tag was included in the fusion protein, in addition to a hexahistidine (His) tag used to facilitate purification (Fig. 1). Both fusion tags could then be removed by enterokinase cleavage, resulting in full-length IAPP. The S-fragment of RNaseA (S) tag was not utilized in this study. The recombinant fusion protein has a molecular mass of about 17 kDa; the tag region corresponds to 13.2 kDa and mature IAPP is ∼3.9 kDa in mass.Expression and Purification of Recombinant Human IAPP—In order to optimize protein expression, we induced the bacterial cultures with two different concentrations of IPTG for 6 h (Fig. 3). No significant difference was found using 0.4 mm or 1 mm IPTG, and, therefore, the latter concentration was employed in subsequent experiments. With both IPTG concentrations, a prominent protein band representing the main component in the bacterial extracts was found in the induced cultures.Fig. 3SDS-PAGE analysis of the expression of recombinant human IAPP fusion protein. Electrophoresis was performed using an 18% acrylamide gel, and the proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Lanes 1 and 10, molecular mass markers. Lanes 4 and 8, crude extracts from two different bacterial cultures after 6 h of induction with 0.4 mm IPTG. Lanes 5 and 9, crude extracts from two different bacterial cultures after 6 h of induction with 1 mm IPTG. Lanes 2, 3, 6, and 7, crude extracts from two different non-induced bacterial cultures. A 10-fold excess of protein was applied in lanes 4, 5, 8, and 9 compared with lanes 2, 3, 6, and 7. The band corresponding to the IAPP fusion protein is indicated by a black arrow on the right-hand side of the gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)As might have been expected for the recombinant expression of an amyloidogenic protein, rhIAPP formed inclusion bodies. SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 3) showed the expected protein band only when cell lysis was carried out under denaturing conditions. When lysis was carried out under non-denaturing conditions, a pellet consisting of inclusion bodies was obtained. The pellet was washed three times with lysis buffer to remove cell debris and other impurities. After washing, the inclusion bodies were solubilized by urea, as described by Ramos et al. (17Ramos O.H. Carmona A.K. Selistre de Araujo H.S. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 28: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The effectiveness of solubilization of inclusion bodies increased proportionally to the urea concentration (data not shown). The inclusion bodies were routinely solubilized in 6 m urea and clarified by ultracentrifugation and filtration.The lysates were purified by immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography, using Ni-NTA agarose under denaturing conditions. It is widely known that the affinity between proteins and metal ions under denaturing conditions is usually lower (18Ueda E.K. Gout P.W. Morganti L. J. Chromatrogr. A. 2003; 98: 1-23Google Scholar). Thus, in order to optimize the interaction of the solubilized protein with the column, the flow rate was decreased in this step. This approach was useful to increase the purification yield in the presence of urea.Because of the high amyloidogenicity of IAPP (19Kapurniotu A. Schmauder A. Tenidis C.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 339-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), we performed the enterokinase cleavage step directly on the column. To this end, urea was removed by washing the column with a discontinuous gradient of decreasing urea concentrations (from 6 to 0 m). Previous tests showed that the optimal conditions of temperature and time of cleavage to avoid proteolytic degradation and to provide the best yield of IAPP were 18 h of incubation at 25 °C with 1 unit of enterokinase. Cleaved IAPP was then eluted from the column with a 50% solution of TFE in cleavage buffer. Using these procedures, the yield of rhIAPP obtained was ∼10 mg of pure protein per liter of bacterial culture, which we consider to be quite significant considering that IAPP is a very hydrophobic and amyloidogenic protein.Fractions of purified rhIAPP were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using Tricine as the trailing ion in the presence of 6 m urea (20Schägger H. Jagow G.V. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10442) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed the expected band of ∼4 kDa (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Tricine SDS-PAGE analysis of synthetic and purified recombinant human IAPP.Lane 1, ultra low range molecular mass markers for SDS-PAGE.

For synthetic IAPP, an ion (M+H+) of 3,902 Da was obtained (Fig. 5A), and for rhIAPP a major component (M+H+) of 3,903 Da was also determined (Fig. 5B), corresponding to full-length IAPP. Interestingly, the rhIAPP samples also contained minor lower MW peaks in addition to the main IAPP peak. MS/MS analysis of the lower molecular mass ions showed that they correspond to peptide fragments derived from the full-length IAPP molecule (data not shown). Longer incubation periods with enterokinase led to increased amounts of the low molecular mass fragments (data not shown), whereas proteolytic treatment for 18 h or less led to reduced peptide fragmentation in the samples (Fig. 5B).Fig. 5MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectra of synthetic (panel A) and recombinant (panel B) human IAPP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Previous reports have shown that human IAPP readily aggregates into amyloid fibrils in aqueous medium (3Kapurniotu A.

The results show that amyloid fibrils are formed, as indicated by the increase in light scattering (Fig. 6A) and by the characteristic increase in thioflavin T fluorescence (Fig. 6B) as a function of time.

https://openalex.org/W2166926225,"LAS enzymes are a group of metallopeptidases that share an active site architecture and a core folding motif and have been named according to the group members lysostaphin, d-Ala-d-Ala carboxypeptidase and sonic hedgehog. Escherichia coli MepA is a periplasmic, penicillin-insensitive murein endopeptidase that cleaves the d-alanyl-meso-2,6-diamino-pimelyl amide bond in E. coli peptidoglycan. The enzyme lacks sequence similarity with other peptidases, and is currently classified as a peptidase of unknown fold and catalytic class in all major data bases. Here, we build on our observation that two motifs, characteristic of the newly described LAS group of metallopeptidases, are conserved in MepA-type sequences. We demonstrate that recombinant E. coli MepA is sensitive to metal chelators and that mutations in the predicted Zn2+ ligands His-113, Asp-120, and His-211 inactivate the enzyme. Moreover, we present the crystal structure of MepA. The active site of the enzyme is most similar to the active sites of lysostaphin and d-Ala-d-Ala carboxypeptidase, and the fold is most closely related to the N-domain of sonic hedgehog.

We conclude that MepA-type peptidases are LAS enzymes. Peptidoglycan amidases are important for bacterial cell wall remodeling during cell growth and division (1Holtje J.V. Heidrich C. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It has become clear in recent years that peptidoglycan hydrolases exist for nearly every amide linkage that occurs in bacterial cell walls (2Smith T.J. Blackman S.A. Foster S.J. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In many species of bacteria, the number of peptidolglycan hydrolases is even higher than the number of different amide linkages, pointing to a functional redundancy in peptidoglycan hydrolases or to a role of specific peptidoglycan hydrolases only at certain stages of the bacterial life cycle (2Smith T.J. Blackman S.A. Foster S.J. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Although the different peptidoglycan hydrolases have either no or no significant similarity at the sequence level, work in several laboratories has established that most of these peptidoglycan hydrolases are structurally related (3Anantharaman V. Aravind L. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Bateman A. Rawlings N.D. Trends Biochem.

Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 854-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We have recently proposed to classify lysostaphin-type enzymes, metallopeptidases with specificity for d-Ala-d-Ala and sonic hedgehog as LAS enzymes (6Bochtler M. Odintsov S. Marcyjaniak M. Sabala I. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 854-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). LAS enzymes contain a single, tetrahedrally coordinated Zn2+ in their active sites. Three Zn2+ ligands are conserved and occur in the order histidine, aspartate, histidine in the sequence. They are part of two motifs, HX(3,6)D and HXH (EXXH in VanX-type enzymes), which are separated by 30 to 100 amino acids in the sequence. In the crystal structures, the histidine of the first motif coordinates the Zn2+ via the N-ϵ atom and is oriented by a hydrogen bond from its N-δ atom to a main chain carbonyl oxygen atom. The aspartate acts as a monodentate ligand, with one of its O-δ atoms in contact with Zn2+ and with the other exposed to solvent in the active enzymes. The glutamate of the EXXH motif of VanX-type enzymes and the first histidine of the HXH motif in all other LAS enzymes are close to the Zn2+ in the crystal structures, but never in direct contact with it, suggesting that these residues may act as the catalytic base. The histidine of the EX(2Smith T.J. Blackman S.A. Foster S.J. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar)H motif and the second histidine of the HXH motif contact the Zn2+ directly via their N-δ atoms, and, except in VanX, are oriented by hydrogen bonds from their N-ϵ atoms to varying hydrogen bond acceptors. The identity of the fourth Zn2+ ligand differs between structures. It is a water molecule in the structures of d-Ala-d-Ala carboxypeptidase (Protein Data Bank accession code 1LBU) (P. Wery, Ph.D thesis), VanX (Protein Data Bank accession code 1R44) (7Bussiere D.E. Pratt S.D. Katz L. Severin J.M. Holzman T. Park C.H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 75-84Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and sonic hedgehog (Protein Data Bank accession code 1VHH) (8Hall T.M. Porter J.A. Beachy P.A. Leahy D.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In the case of the lysostaphin-type peptidase LytM (Protein Data Bank accession code 1QWY), a latent form of the enzyme was crystallized. In this structure, a poorly conserved asparagine residue from the N-terminal part of the enzyme contacts the metal via its O-δ. Biochemical data are consistent with a role of this residue as an “asparagine switch” (9Odintsov S. Sabala I. Marcyjaniak M. Bochtler M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 775-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Spatial superposition of LAS enzymes shows that the conservation of active-site architecture includes the presence of two additional residues that can be either glutamate or histidine in conserved locations. As these residues are not Zn2+ ligands, it has been speculated that they play a role as general base/general acid in the catalytic mechanism. Beyond the catalytic machinery, LAS enzymes share a core folding motif of four antiparallel β-strands with conserved topology and strand order 1, 2, 4, 3 that is typically part of a larger central β-sheet with poorly conserved periphery. Outside of the core folding motif, LAS enzymes are very diverse, making the similarity between different LAS families undetectable by PSI-BLAST similarity searches (6Bochtler M. Odintsov S. Marcyjaniak M. Sabala I. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 854-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli MepA is a periplasmic murein endopeptidase that is believed to play a role in the removal of murein from the sacculus and could also play a role in the integration of nascent murein strands into the sacculus (10Goodell E.W. Schwarz U. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 136-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mechanistically, the enzyme is an amidase that cleaves the alanyl-meso-2,6-diaminopimelyl peptide bond that connects peptidoglycan strands in Gram-negative cell walls (11Kitano K. Tuomanen E. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 759-765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Partially purified preparations of E. coli MepA were reported to be sensitive to metal-chelating agents, deoxyribonucleic acid and lipoteichoic acid, but insensitive to penicillin (12Tomioka S. Matshuhashi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 84: 978-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Because of the low abundance of MepA in the E. coli periplasm, the previously reported purification procedure required large amounts of cells (12Tomioka S. Matshuhashi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 84: 978-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Homologues of E. coli MepA occur in many Gram-negative bacteria, consistent with the universal presence of amide bonds between d-alanine and meso-2,6-diaminopimelate in these species (13Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MepA-type enzymes have not been detected in Gram-positive organisms (14Rawlings N.D. O'Brien E. Barrett A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), even though some of them, such as Bacillus subtilis, contain alanyl-meso-2,6-diaminopimelyl peptide bonds in their peptidoglycan (13Schleifer K.H. Kandler O. Bacteriol. Rev. 1972; 36: 407-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the penicillin insensitivity of the E. coli enzyme, MepA-type peptidases are not related in sequence to the largest class of murein endopeptidases, the penicillin-binding proteins. MepA-type enzymes are poorly understood at the mechanistic level. Their fold and catalytic class have not been determined. In the MEROPS peptidase data base, they are currently classified as family U6 (“unknown”) (14Rawlings N.D. O'Brien E. Barrett A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In this article, we show that MepA-type peptidases are LAS enzymes. We demonstrate that the recombinant E. coli enzyme is inhibited by Zn2+ chelators, and that mutations in any of the signature sequence residues strongly reduce or abolish activity. Moreover, we present the crystal structure of E. coli MepA to prove that the fold and active site architecture of the enzyme are consistent with the classification as a LAS enzyme. Cloning, Expression, and Protein Purification—Standard PCR techniques were used to amplify mepA from genomic DNA of E. coli XL-1Blue. The amplified DNA fragment was cloned into pET15b with restriction enzymes NcoI and XhoI, and the construct was checked by double strand sequencing. For protein expression, the plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. Bacteria were initially grown in 37 °C to an A600 of 0.5-0.8, induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and then grown for up to 3 h in 25 °C. For selenomethionine containing protein, the plasmid was transformed into the methionine auxotroph E. coli strain B834(DE3). Cells were cultured in 1 liter of medium at 37 °C to an A600 of 1.0 and additionally up to 6 h after induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, according to the published protocol (15Budisa N. Steipe B. Demange P. Eckerskorn C. Kellermann J. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 788-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested and resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5). After sonication and high-speed centrifugation at 40,000 × g, the supernatant was fractionated with ammonium sulfate. The material precipitating between 35 and 60% saturation was dissolved in buffer A and dialyzed overnight against 100 volumes of buffer A with one buffer change. The dialyzed supernatant was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose FF column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A, and the flow-through fractions containing MepA were collected and subsequently applied on an SP-Sepharose column (Sigma). After extensive washing of the column with 100 mm NaCl, buffer A, the protein was eluted with 200 mm NaCl, buffer A. The pooled fractions with MepA were concentrated to 1 ml (YM-10 Centricons) and subjected to a Sephacryl S-300 (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl. The pure MepA was dialyzed overnight against 100 volumes of 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and concentrated to 10-15 mg/ml (Amicon 10 kDa cut-off regenerated cellulose fibers). Crystallization—All crystals were grown at room temperature (21 °C) by sitting drop vapor diffusion with 0.5 ml of reservoir buffer. Orthorhombic, monoclinic, and triclinic crystals could be grown. Orthorhombic crystals appeared after 4 weeks by mixing equal amounts of reservoir buffer containing 0.2 m ammonium acetate, 0.1 m trisodium citrate dihydrate (pH 5.69), 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, and 10 mg/ml protein solution in 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). One asymmetric unit consisted of two molecules. For cryoprotection crystals were soaked in the mixture containing 85% reservoir buffer and 15% polyethylene glycol 400 (Table I).Table IData collection and phasing statistics for the P21212 crystal formSpace groupP21212a × b × c (Å)66.53 × 165.29 × 45.63Wavelength (Å)1.05001.27801.2820Total reflections118,625153,357157,931Unique reflections30,71928,96429,129Resolution (Å)20.0-2.520.0-2.620.0-2.6Completeness (%)91.5 (84.4)97.3 (96.8)97.6 (97.8)I/σ24.7 (7.9)28 (7.7)28.0 (7.1)Rsym (%)6.9 (15.1)7.7 (18.0)7.5 (20.8)Number of zinc sites2FOMaFOM, figure of merit.

Crystals contained 6 molecules per asymmetric unit, and could be reproduced also with the selenomethionine version of the protein (Table II). Structure Determination—All datasets were collected at beamline BW6 at DESY synchrotron in Hamburg (Germany). Fluorescence scanning showed that the orthorhombic and triclinic forms contained Zn2+, whereas Zn2+ was unexpectedly absent from the monoclinic form. The orthorhombic crystal form was solved by multiple anomalous diffraction at the Zn2+ edge. Three highly redundant datasets with both Friedel mates were collected to a resolution of about 2.6 Å (Tab. I), and the dataset at the remote wavelength was then extended in a final pass with long exposures to a resolution of 1.9 Å. AUTOSHARP (16Bricogne G. Vonrhein W. Paciorek C. Flensburg M. Schiltz E. Blanc P. Rovesi R. Evans M.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 2002; 58: C239Crossref Google Scholar) was used to identify the two Zn2+ sites and to calculate initial phases with an overall figure of merit of 0.57 to 2.6 Å that were subsequently improved by SOLOMON (17Abrahams J.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). These phases combined with the high resolution dataset served as an input for ARP/WARP (18Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 229-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) that delivered an ∼50% complete model (without sequence assignment) for subunit A, and almost no model for subunit B. No further building was attempted in this crystal form. Two copies of the partial model for subunit A were subsequently located in the monoclinic crystal form using MOLREP (19Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) and used to calculate starting phases for an ARP/WARP-run at 1.4-Å resolution, which yielded near complete models and a confident sequence assignment for both monomers in this crystal form. The model from the monoclinic crystal form was then used to solve the triclinic crystal form, again by molecular replacement using MOLREP (19Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). The MOLREP search for six monomers worked with default settings, probably because of the high quality of the model from the monoclinic crystal form and because of the presence of pseudotranslation vectors relating several monomers in identical or near identical orientations. As the success of the molecular replacement procedure was not expected at the stage of data collection, we had collected anomalous data at both the Zn2+ and selenium edges for a selenomethinonine crystal of this form. With the help of the model phases, the Zn2+ and selenium scatterers could be identified with excellent signal in anomalous difference Fourier maps. This assignment confirmed Zn2+ in the active sites, identified three additional Zn2+ sites, and confirmed all selenium sites predicted by the model, strongly supporting the sequence assignment. Heavy atom sites were then used to calculate a model-independent map with MLPHARE (20Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar), and this map was improved by combined solvent flattening and 6-fold averaging with DM (20Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) using model-derived NCS operators and a model-derived averaging mask. The resultant averaged map was very clear and allowed to model differences between the triclinic and monoclinic forms with confidence. Structure Refinement—The orthorhombic crystal form proved unexpectedly difficult to refine even with structural information from the other crystal forms. We were unable to lower the free R factor significantly below 30% (for 1.9 Å data), suggesting that changes or more likely disorder in the poorly defined subunit B in this crystal form are not adequately described by the model. The monoclinic form has well defined electron density for both subunits, and could be satisfactorily refined with REFMAC (21Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) to an effective resolution of 1.4 Å with good stereochemistry (Table II). The final model comprises residues 20 to 244 and 260 to 274 for subunit A, residues 23 to 244 and 259 to 272 for subunit B, and 560 water molecules and 9 sulfate anions from the crystallization buffer. The assignment of one molecule of 1,4-butanediol from the crystallization buffer is very tentative. The triclinic form at 2.4-Å resolution was refined with CNS (22Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M.

Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) without NCS restraints in the final stage. Models are similarly complete as for the P21 form, but all six copies of MepA contain Zn2+ in their active sites. Three additional Zn2+ ions are located at the interfaces between monomers that are related by local 2-fold symmetry. Sulfates from the buffer are bound to sites near the active centers that also accommodate sulfates in the P21 form. Generation and Purification of Mutants—MepA mutants H113A, D120A, H209A, and H211A were obtained by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis according to the Stratagene protocol with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). The engineered MepA variants were all soluble and expressed at least at the same level as wild type MepA. For their purification, the same protocol as for the wild type MepA could be used. Alternatively, a simplified procedure was applied, with the periplasmic fraction isolation as a first step. This included growing cells at 30 °C to an optical density (A600) of 0.6, induction with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and further incubation for 2 h at the same temperature. Harvested cells were then incubated in Buffer B (20% sucrose, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) for 10 min at room temperature and centrifuged to collect cells. Osmotic shock was accomplished by the rapid addition of 5 mm MgSO4 to washed cells and gentle mixing. The sample was then incubated on ice for an additional 5 min and centrifuged at 12,000 × g to remove the spheroplasts and intact cells from the supernatant, which was the periplasmic fraction. MepA mutants were the dominant band on SDS-polyacrylamide gels in this solution. For final purification, the solution was subjected to ion-exchange chromatography on SP-Sepharose resin as described above for native MepA. After dialysis to 5 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), the protein could be concentrated and stored in -70 °C. Peptidoglycan Isolation—Gram-negative peptidoglycans were isolated according to Ref. 23Glauner B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 451-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar with modifications. Briefly, Pseudomonas putida were grown in 30 °C on LB medium and harvested at A600 of ∼1.5. The cell pellet was resuspended in cold water and added slowly to 8% boiling SDS. Samples were boiled for another 30 min and then incubated 12 h at room temperature. Polymeric peptidoglycan was recovered by high-speed centrifugation (100,000 × g) and washed several times to remove traces of SDS. Harvested, insoluble material was then treated with α-amylase at 37 °C and subsequently with Pronase at 60 °C. After dilution with water, the sacculi were washed several times and finally resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). Zymography—The activity of MepA was detected on 12% polyacrylamide-sodium dodecyl sulfate gels containing 0.05% P. putida PCM 2124 murein sacculi, according to the described protocol (24Bernadsky G. Beveridge T. Clarke A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5225-5232Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) with modifications. Before the gels were cast, peptidoglycans were homogenized by sonication. Samples containing whole cell supernatants (cytoplasmic and periplasmic fraction) were prepared from cells grown as described above. The supernatants were loaded on the gel in amounts corresponding to 5 μg of whole protein content. In the case of purified proteins, about 0.2 μg of protein was loaded per lane. Electrophoresis was done in the cold room. Gels were incubated in renaturation buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm BisTris buffer, pH 6.0) for 16 h, with one buffer exchange. After incubation, the zymograms were rinsed with Milli-Q water, stained with 0.1% methylene blue in 0.01% KOH, and destained in deionized water. Lytic zones indicating the enzyme hydrolytic activity appeared as clear zones on the blue background. For testing the dependence of MepA activity on pH of the buffer, zymography gels were incubated in renaturation buffers of different pH values, using 20 mm sodium citrate buffer for pH 4 and 5, and 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer for pH 7, 8, and 9. LAS Motifs in MepA Enzymes—Our recent definition of LAS enzymes (6Bochtler M. Odintsov S. Marcyjaniak M. Sabala I. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 854-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) prompted us to search for additional protein families that could belong to this group. Therefore, we searched alignments of poorly characterized protease families for the HX(3,6)D and HXH motifs that are characteristic for LAS enzymes and found that both are present in MepA peptidases. We further inferred from consensus secondary structure predictions that the characteristic histidines and the aspartate occurred in secondary structure contexts that would be expected for LAS enzymes. These observations together with the peptidoglycan amidase activity of MepA suggested that MepA enzymes could be an additional family in the LAS group of peptidoglycan amidases. Based on the sequence data alone, this conclusion remained very tentative. First, the similarity between MepA enzymes and other LAS enzymes could not be substantiated by iterative PSI-BLAST searches. Second, many other residues, including serines, cysteines, and histidines outside of the HX(3,6)D and HXH motifs are conserved among MepA proteins, leaving room for many other hypotheses about potential catalytic dyads or triads. Therefore, we decided to test our prediction about the similarity of MepA amidases and LAS enzymes experimentally. MepA Purification—The E. coli mepA gene was amplified by PCR and various E. coli expression constructs were prepared. A number of attempts to express the protein in the cytoplasm, both alone and as a fusion protein, yielded large amounts of insoluble protein. However, when overexpressed MepA was targeted to the periplasm by its own native leader sequence, soluble protein in moderate yield could be recovered from whole cell lysates. As recombinant overexpression of MepA rendered cells prone to lysis, direct isolation of MepA from the periplasm was not possible. Nevertheless, mass spectrometry analysis of MepA purified from whole cell lysates showed that the overexpressed protein had a mass of 28,295 Da, corresponding to the protein after cleavage of the predicted 19-residue periplasmic leader sequence. The protein was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and obtained in an overall yield of ∼2 mg per liter of culture. Zymography Assay for MepA Activity—With sufficient amounts of enzyme in hand, we next attempted to develop a simple, non-radioactive assay for MepA activity. Previous experience with peptidoglycan peptidases suggested that the activity could be conveniently assayed by zymography with purified peptidoglycans polymerized as a substrate into denaturing SDS-PAGE gels. As E. coli peptidoglycan is difficult to isolate in quantity, we settled for peptidoglycan from P. putida that is similar or identical to E. coli peptidoglycan and gave clear signals for MepA activity (Fig. 1A). Inhibitor Sensitivity of MepA—Our hypothesis about the similarity of MepA to LAS enzymes suggested that the enzyme should be sensitive to the metal chelating agents EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline, but not to serine and cysteine peptidase inhibitors such as phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and E-64. This turned out to be the case. Zn2+ at 10 mm concentration was also inhibitory to the enzyme, consistent with previous reports about the inhibition of zinc-dependent metallopeptidases by unphysiologically high concentrations of Zn2+ (9Odintsov S. Sabala I. Marcyjaniak M. Bochtler M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 775-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 25Kessler E. Safrin M. Abrams W.R. Rosenbloom J. Ohman D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9884-9889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Role of Conserved Residues in the HX(3,6)D and HXH Motifs—The LAS hypothesis further implied that the conserved histidines and the aspartate in the HX(3,6)D and HXH motifs of MepA should be catalytically important (9Odintsov S. Sabala I. Marcyjaniak M. Bochtler M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 775-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 26Gustin J.K. Kessler E. Ohman D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6608-6617Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To test this assumption for MepA, each of the four conserved residues was separately mutated to alanine. E. coli cells overexpressing any of the four mutants were significantly less prone to lysis than cells overexpressing the wild-type protein. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” this allowed the isolation of periplasmic fractions and thus considerably simplified the purification procedure. More importantly, it suggested a difference in activity between the wild-type and mutant proteins. This difference was also clearly apparent from the zymography results. As the mutants were expressed in mepA+ background, the preparations of mutant protein were contaminated with traces of wild-type protein, which could be responsible for the residual activity that was observed in these lanes (Fig. 1C).

https://openalex.org/W1981405325,"The growth factor signaling mechanisms responsible for neointimal smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and accumulation, a characteristic feature of many vascular pathologies that can lead to restenosis after angioplasty, remain to be identified. Here, we examined the contribution of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) 2 and 3 as well as novel fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) to such proliferation. Balloon catheter injury to the rat carotid artery stimulated the expression of two distinctly spliced FGFR-2 isoforms, differing only by the presence or absence of the acidic box, and two distinctly spliced FGFR-3 isoforms containing the acidic box and differing only by the presence of either the IIIb or IIIc exon. Post-injury arterial administration of recombinant adenoviruses expressing dominant negative mutant forms of these FGFRs were used to assess the roles of the endogenous FGFR isoforms in neointimal SMC proliferation. Dominant negative FGFR-2 containing the acidic box inhibited such proliferation by 40%, whereas the dominant negative FGFR-3 forms had little effect. Expression of FGF-9, known to be capable of binding to all four neointimal FGFR-2/-3 isoforms, was abundant within the neointima. FGF-9 markedly stimulated both the proliferation of neointimal SMCs and the activation of extracellular signal-related kinases 1/2, effects which were abrogated by the administration of antisense FGF-9 oligonucleotides to injured arteries and the expression of the dominant negative FGFR-2 adenovirus in cultured neointimal SMCs. These studies demonstrate that, although multiple FGFRs are induced in neointimal SMCs following arterial injury, specific interactions between distinctly spliced FGFR-2 isoforms and FGF-9 contribute to the proliferation of these SMCs.

To date, the agents responsible for the proliferation of SMCs within the intima have eluded identification, and strategies aimed at inhibiting intimal SMC proliferation after arterial injury by either preventing platelet-derived growth factor expression or neutralizing fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) have been unsuccessful (4Wong J.

This has led to postulates stating that phenotypically unique SMCs that can exhibit autonomous growth in the intima and secrete unknown heparin binding growth factors may be responsible for expansion of the SMC population in the intima (6Bochaton-Piallat M.L.

Such FGFs are most likely also responsible for SMC proliferation within the intima of healing arteries following arterial injury during angioplasty and during the development of arteriosclerosis.Immunohistochemical studies have identified the presence of multiple FGFR types in healing and atherosclerotic arteries, including FGFR-1, FGFR-2, and FGFR-3 (11Koyama H. Reidy M.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 12Hughes S.E. Cardiovasc. Res. 1996; 32: 557-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Brogi E. Winkles J.A. Underwood R. Clinton S.K. Alberts G.F. Libby P. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 92: 2408-2418Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Although FGFR-1 has been shown to be involved in the medial SMC proliferation within healing arteries, it does not play a major role in neointimal SMC proliferation (11Koyama H. Reidy M.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the contribution of FGFR-2 and FGFR-3 to neointimal SMC proliferation has not been elucidated. The structural features of FGFRs include an extracellular ligand binding domain, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. The extracellular region of FGFRs prototypically consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains, a short motif of acidic amino acids (the “acidic box”) located just distal to Ig-like domain I, and a heparin binding domain also interposed between the first and second Ig-like domains; however, alternative RNA splicing can result in several isoforms of an FGFR from the one respective gene that differ in their extracellular sequence and possess unique ligand binding properties (14Powers C.J. Mcleskey S.W. Wellstein A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2000; 7: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). One such splicing event results in a deletion of the exon encoding the amino-terminal Ig-like domain (domain I), resulting in a shorter, two-Ig-like domain isoform of the receptor (15Wang F. Kan M. Yan G. Xu J. McKeehan W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10231-10235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar); such shorter FGFRs (“β-forms”) frequently have higher affinities for some FGFs than do the corresponding longer three-Ig-like domain FGFRs (“α-forms”) and, in some instances, have been associated with tumor progression (16Yamaguchi F. Saya H. Bruner J.M. Morrison R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 484-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Another splicing event that can dramatically alter the FGF binding ability of FGFR-1, -2, and -3 involves the alternate usage of either the “IIIb” or “IIIc” exon to encode the carboxyl-terminal portion of Ig-like domain III (14Powers C.J. Mcleskey S.W. Wellstein A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2000; 7: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). Expression of these FGFR isoforms appears to be regulated in a tissue-specific manner, with IIIb exon-containing isoforms apparently restricted in expression to epithelial cell lineages and IIIc exon-containing isoforms restricted in expression to mesenchymal cell lineages (17Ornitz D.M. Xu J. Colvin J.S. McEwen D.G. MacArthur C.A. Coulier F. Gao G. Goldfarb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15292-15297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar). As a consequence of such splicing events, FGF ligands can have either a diverse or an extremely restricted FGFR binding profile. For example, FGF-1 binds to all FGFR isoforms with high affinity, FGF-2 exhibits a high affinity for binding to FGFR-1IIIb, FGFR-1IIIc, and FGFR-3IIIc, and FGF-9 exhibits a high affinity for binding to FGFR-2IIIc, FGFR-3IIIb, and FGFR-3IIIc (17Ornitz D.M. Xu J. Colvin J.S. McEwen D.G. MacArthur C.A. Coulier F. Gao G. Goldfarb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15292-15297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar); conversely, FGF-7 and FGF-10 are restricted in binding, with high affinity only to FGFR-2IIIb (14Powers C.J.

Aaronson S.A. Mohammadi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2266-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Finally, it has become increasingly apparent that the cellular potency of FGFR signaling is also influenced by post-translational receptor modification, in particular the enhanced mitogenic capacity of FGFR-2β isoforms arising from glycosaminoglycan modification at the acidic box motif (19Sakaguchi K. Lorenzi M.V. Bottaro D.P. Miki T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6754-6764Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Here, we demonstrate that arterial injury induces the predominant expression by neointimal SMCs of two distinctly spliced FGFR-2IIIc β-isoforms, differing from each other only by the presence/absence of the acidic box motif, and two distinctly spliced FGFR-3 α-isoforms, both containing the acidic box motif and differing from each other only by the alternate IIIb/IIIc composition of Ig-like domain III. Using adenoviruses expressing dominant negative mutants of specific receptor types truncated at their transmembrane domain and devoid of tyrosine kinase activity, we demonstrate that signaling through FGFR-2IIIc is a major contributor to neointimal SMC proliferation. We further demonstrate that a specific FGF ligand, FGF-9, known to have high affinity for the neointimal FGFR-2/-3 isoforms, shows an elevated neointimal expression after arterial injury and contributes to neointimal SMC proliferation through an interaction with FGFR-2IIIc. These findings, for the first time, demonstrate a major regulatory role for an FGFR2-IIIc/FGF-9 interaction in the stimulation of neointimal SMC proliferation in the injured arterial wall.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCarotid Artery Injury—Balloon catheter injury to the rat carotid artery was carried out as described previously (4Wong J. Rauhoft C. Dilley R.J. Agrotis A. Jennings G.L. Bobik A. Circulation. 1997; 96: 1631-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 20Ward M.R. Tsao P.S. Agrotis A. Dilley R.J. Jennings G.L. Bobik A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, after anesthetizing the rats with a mixture of pentobarbitone (30 mg/kg), methohexitone (40 mg/kg), and atropine sulfate (3 mg/kg) administered by intraperitoneal injection, a 2F Fogarty arterial embolectomy catheter (Baxter) was passed through an arteriotomy in the left common femoral artery and into the left common carotid artery to its bifurcation. The balloon was inflated with 25 μl of saline and withdrawn with a rotating action to the aortic arch and then reintroduced and withdrawn a further two times. The femoral artery was then ligated, the incision was closed, and the animals were allowed to recover in a humidified, warmed chamber for 1–2 h. Subsequently, the animals either underwent a second surgical procedure (see below) or were sacrificed 2 to 14 days later with an overdose of pentobarbitone (100 mg/kg intraperitoneal), and the carotid arteries were collected for mRNA analyses, Western blotting, or immunohistochemistry.Delivery of Adenoviruses/Antisense Oligonucleotides to Injured Arteries and Determination of SMC Proliferation—After anesthetizing the rats (see above), a midline neck incision was made, and blunt end dissection to the carotid bifurcation was performed. A fine catheter was then inserted through an arteriotomy in the external carotid artery and placed into the common carotid artery. Temporary ligatures were then placed around the catheter in the common carotid artery before flushing the vessel with a solution of adenovirus or oligonucleotide and then placing a second ligature on the vessel toward the aortic arch. Solutions of either adenovirus (5 × 109 plaque-forming units in 100 μl saline) or oligonucleotides (20 μm in 100 μl of LipofectAMINE/Opti-MEM) were then infused into the ligated segment of the common carotid artery for 30 min at a pressure of 80–100 mm Hg. The ligatures and catheter were then removed, the external carotid ligated, the incision closed, and the animals allowed to recover (see above). To measure cell proliferation in the healing vessels, 50 mg/kg bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) was administered by intraperitoneal injection 24 and 8 h before sacrifice.Tissue Collection and Immunohistochemistry—Carotid arteries were removed from the sacrificed animals and cleaned of non-vascular tissue. Then, arteries intended for mRNA analyses or Western blotting underwent careful removal of their neointima under a dissecting microscope, and the neointimal tissue was then rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Carotid arteries for immunohistochemical analyses were mounted in OCT compound (Tissue Tek; Miles Scientific), frozen in pentane over liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70 °C. Immunohistochemical detection of FGFR and FGF peptide expression and BrdUrd incorporation was carried out using 6 μm of frozen cross-sections and the avidin-biotinperoxidase complex kit (Vector Laboratories) with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrachloride as the chromogenic substrate, essentially as described previously (21Ward M.R.

Primary antibodies to FGFR-2 (1:500, rabbit anti-human polyclonal; catalog number sc-122), FGFR-3 (1:500, rabbit anti-human polyclonal; catalog number sc-123), and FGF-9 (1:500, goat anti-human polyclonal; catalog number sc-1368) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., the anti-FGF-1 antibody (1:500, rabbit antibovine polyclonal; catalog number G5081) was from Promega, the anti-FGF-2 antibody (1:500, mouse anti-human monoclonal; catalog number DE6) was from du Pont du Nemours and Company, and the anti-BrdUrd antibody (1:100, mouse monoclonal; catalog number 03-3900) was from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. The appropriate peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories) were used at a concentration of 1:200. After completing the immunohistochemical procedures, the sections were lightly counterstained with hematoxylin.Reverse Transcription PCR—RNA was isolated from 2–3 neointimas and treated with DNase (Promega) essentially as described previously (21Ward M.R. Agrotis A. Kanellakis P. Dilley R.J. Jennings G. Bobik A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2461-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Approximately 300 ng of RNA was reverse transcribed using a GeneAmp RNA-PCR kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and specific FGFR-2, FGFR-3, and FGF-9 fragments were amplified using 35 PCR cycles (see next paragraph) as described previously (20Ward M.R. Tsao P.S. Agrotis A. Dilley R.J. Jennings G.L. Bobik A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 208-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For determination of FGFR cDNA structures and verification of FGF-9 amplification specificity, nucleotide sequencing (TaqTrack, Promega) was carried out on gel-purified fragments cloned into pGEM-T vectors (Promega) (22Agrotis A. Condron M. Bobik A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).Oligonucleotide Primers for RT-PCR and Antisense FGF-9 Oligonucleotides—FGFR-2 and FGFR-3 primers were designed to provide definitive structural information on distinct regions of the receptors encoded by each amplified cDNA (seeFig. 2A). Specifically, to detect the presence/absence of Ig-like domain I and the acidic box motif in the extracellular region of each receptor, primer sets designated as “Region A” were utilized in which the sense and antisense primers were chosen such that they were sufficiently distal from the 5′ and 3′ splicing boundaries of both consecutive exons that code for Ig-like domain I and the acidic box; for detection of alternatively spliced IIIb or IIIc exons in the carboxyl terminus of Ig-like domain III and in the presence of the transmembrane-spanning region, primer sets designated as “Region B-TM” in the case of FGFR-2 and “Region A-IIIb”, “Region A-IIIc”, or Region B-TM in the case of FGFR-3 were utilized. The precise location of each of the primer pairs within each cDNA and the predicted size of their amplification products were as follows. For FGFR-2 cDNA (GenBank™ accession numbers Z35138, L19104, and D83495), in Region A the sense primer comprised nucleotides 19–42 and the antisense primer comprised nucleotides 585–614 (596 bp); in Region B-TM the sense primer comprised nucleotides 884–913 and the antisense primer comprised nucleotides 1426–1445 (562 bp). To detect the presence in this cDNA fragment of the IIIb or IIIc exon, the restriction endonuclease HpaI, a site for which is present in the IIIc exon but not the IIIb exon, was used to digest the amplified product. For FGFR-3 cDNA (GenBank™ accession numbers M81342 and L26492), in Region A the sense primer comprised nucleotides 6–33 and the antisense primer comprised nucleotides 433–452 (447 bp). To detect either the IIIb exon or IIIc exon in the carboxyl-terminal half of Ig-like domain III, the sense primer of Region A was used with a IIIb exon-specific antisense primer (Region A-IIIb, nucleotides 914–939; 934 bp) or a IIIc exon-specific antisense primer (Region A-IIIc, nucleotides 956–981; 976 bp). For the transmembrane-spanning domain (Region B-TM), the sense primer comprised nucleotides 913–942 and the antisense primer comprised nucleotides 1676–1696 (784 bp). To detect FGF-9 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number D14839), the sense primer comprised nucleotides 222–247 and the antisense primer comprised nucleotides 508–537 (316 bp). Phosphorothioate-modified FGF-9 antisense and sense oligonucleotides were made, corresponding to nucleotides 170–184 of the rat cDNA.In Situ RT-PCR—To detect FGF-9 mRNA in the neointima, 6-μm cross-sections of carotid arteries fixed onto gelatinized slides with formalin were subjected to in situ RT-PCR as described previously (23Kalinina N. Agrotis A. Tararak E. Antropova Y. Kanellakis P. Ilyinskaya O. Quinn M.T. Smirnov V. Bobik A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 2037-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, FGF-9 mRNA was detected by a “one-step” RT-PCR method (35 cycles) utilizing EZ rTth polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol and digoxigenin-11-dUTP. Messenger RNA expression/localization was then determined with an anti-digoxigenin antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase; color detection was carried out using the substrate nitro blue tetrazolium. Controls included tissue sections not exposed to PCR primers and reaction mixtures not subjected to reverse transcription.Recombinant Dominant Negative FGFR-2 and FGFR-3 Adenoviruses—The pAd-Easy1 virus and shuttle plasmid pAd-TrackCMV were obtained from Dr. R. Hannan, Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute, Melbourne, Australia (24Thomas W.G. Brandenburger Y. Autelitano D.J. Pham T. Qian H. Hannan R.D. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Adenoviruses expressing dominant negative (DN) FGFR-2βIIIcAB (devoid of Ig-like domain I and containing the acidic box), FGFR-3αIIIbAB, and FGFR-3αIIIcAB (both containing all three Ig-like domains and the acidic box and differing from each other only in the alternate presence of either the IIIb or IIIc exon in the carboxyl terminus of Ig-like domain III) were prepared by amplifying their cDNAs from rat SMC RNA and truncating these cDNAs at the transmembrane domain with the inclusion of a FLAG epitope tag immediately distal to the last amino acid of the transmembrane domain. These cDNAs were cloned into pAd-TrackCMV using the following PCR primers incorporating KpnI and XbaI restriction sites: FGFR-2βIIIcAB, 5′-taccggtaccATGGTCAGCTGGGGGCGCTTCATC-3′ (sense; nucleotides 1–24 of cDNA; KpnI site is lowercase and underlined and the initiation codon is bold and italicized) and 5′-ccggtctagaCTActtgtcatcgtcgtccttgtagtcGCTGCTGAAGTCTGGCTTCTTGGT-3′ (antisense; nucleotides 1207–1236 of cDNA; XbaI site is lowercase and underlined, termination codon is bold and italicized, and the FLAG epitope is in small capitals); and FGFR-3αIIIbAB or FGFR-3αIIIcAB, 5′-cacggtaccATGGTAGTCCCGGCCTGCGTGCTA-3′ (sense; nucleotides 1–24 of cDNA; KpnI site is lowercase and underlined and the initiation codon is bold and italicized) and 5′-ccggtctagaCTActtgtcatcgtcgtccttgtagtcGCCCAGGCCCTTCTTTGGGGGACT-3′ (antisense; nucleotides 1180–1209 of cDNA; the XbaI site is lowercase and underlined, the termination codon is bold and italicized, and the FLAG epitope is in small capitals). The integrity of each construct was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing, and the differentiation between either the FGFR-3αIIIbAB or the FGFR-3αIIIcAB constructs was confirmed by the use of restriction enzymes specific for either the IIIb or IIIc exon. Recombinant adenoviruses were generated by bacterial homologous recombination between pAd-TrackCMV containing DN-FGFR cDNAs and pAdEasy-1. Large scale amplification and purification using human embryonic kidney 293 cells was then carried out as described previously (25He T.-C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3228) Google Scholar).Neointimal SMC Culture and Proliferation Assay—Neointimal SMCs were isolated by elastase/collagenase digestion of 2–3 neointimas obtained from healing carotid arteries and cultured as described previously (21Ward M.R. Agrotis A. Kanellakis P. Dilley R.J. Jennings G. Bobik A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2461-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These SMCs exhibited the “cobblestone” morphology described previously for such SMCs (26Bochaton-Piallat M.L. Ropraz P. Gabbiani F. Gabbiani G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 815-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Proliferation stimulated by FGF-9 was determined on semiconfluent neointimal SMC cultures that had been serum-deprived for 48 h prior to the addition of the growth factor (50 ng/ml) and then for a further 18 h with the subsequent measurement of cellular [3H]thymidine incorporation, essentially as described previously (27Agrotis A. Saltis J. Bobik A. Hypertension. 1994; 23: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For such experiments, SMCs at passages 1–3 were used.Western Blot Analyses—Protein was extracted from the neointima of injured arteries and subjected to Western blot analysis using either the anti-FGF-9 antibody (see above), an anti-FLAG epitope antibody (mouse monoclonal, Sigma catalog number F-3165), or an antibody to green fluorescent protein (GFP; mouse anti-jellyfish monoclonal, Roche Applied Science catalog number 1814460) and the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting system (Amersham Biosciences) essentially as described previously (4Wong J. Rauhoft C. Dilley R.J. Agrotis A. Jennings G.L. Bobik A. Circulation. 1997; 96: 1631-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To measure DN-FGFR adenovirus expression in neointimal SMCs infected 48 h earlier, the cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate buffered saline and lysed using a solution consisting of 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The solution was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the protein was quantified using the Coomassie Plus protein assay kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as standard. SDS-electrophoresis was performed using 10% acrylamide gels followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), and confirmation of mature DN-FGFR peptide expression was carried out by using the anti-FLAG epitope antibody. The ability of FGF-9 to stimulate the phosphorylation of p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinases (ERK 1/2) in the neointimal SMCs, either with or without prior DN-FGFR-2 infection, was assessed with Western blot analysis using a mouse anti-human monoclonal phospho-p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibody (Cell Signaling Technology catalog number 9106); in these SMCs total ERK levels were assessed using a rabbit anti-human polyclonal antibody to ERK 1/2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. catalog number sc-93), and levels of DN-FGFR-2βIIIcAB were assessed using the anti-FLAG antibody.Statistical Analyses—Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. The inhibitory effect of the DN-FGFR adenoviruses and the antisense-FGF-9 oligonucleotide on neointimal SMC proliferation in injured arteries was assessed using unpaired t tests. Significance was established by a value of p < 0.05.RESULTSFGFR Expression in Proliferating SMCs of the Neointima—Because FGFRs bind FGF family members with varying affinities, and alternative hnRNA splicing leads to receptor isoforms that possess unique FGF binding properties (14Powers C.J. Mcleskey S.W. Wellstein A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2000; 7: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar, 17Ornitz D.M. Xu J. Colvin J.S. McEwen D.G. MacArthur C.A. Coulier F. Gao G. Goldfarb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15292-15297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1412) Google Scholar), we initially investigated the expression of two FGFRs, FGFR-2 and FGFR-3, in the rapidly proliferating SMCs within the growing neointima of healing rat carotid arteries injured with an inflated balloon catheter. Ten days after injury, high concentrations of FGFR-2 and FGFR-3 were expressed in the neointima and the media of these arteries (Fig. 1, A and B). Four days later, FGFR-2 levels were greatly reduced (Fig. 1C), but FGFR-3 continued to be expressed (Fig. 1D). FGFR-2 and FGFR-3 were also expressed in the media of these vessels as early as 2 days after injury (not shown), but not in uninjured carotid arteries (Fig. 1, E and F). To gain an insight into the potential role of these receptors in neointimal SMC proliferation and the FGF ligands with which they might interact, we determined the expression of distinctly spliced FGFR-2 and FGFR-3 isoforms by RT-PCR analysis of their mRNAs isolated from the neointima, followed by nucleotide sequencing of specific amplified fragments. Analysis of FGFR-2 mRNA was performed using oligonucleotide primers (depicted in Fig. 2A) encompassing the extracellular region that includes Ig-like domains I and II (Region A, nucleotides 19–614 of the rat cDNA) and the region that includes Ig-like domain III and the transmembrane-spanning domain (Region B-TM, nucleotides 884–1445 of the rat cDNA). Amplification using Region A primers indicated that only trace amounts of full-length FGFR-2 containing all three Ig-like domains was expressed, as shown by the low abundance of the expected PCR product (596 bp; Fig. 2B, lane 1); an additional two minor FGFR-2 cDNA specie"
https://openalex.org/W2062783366,"SoxR protein, a member of the MerR family of transcriptional activators, mediates a global oxidative stress response in Escherichia coli. Upon oxidation or nitrosylation of its [2Fe-2S] centers SoxR activates its target gene, soxS, by mediating a structural transition in the promoter DNA that stimulates initiation by RNA polymerase. We explored the molecular basis of this signal transduction by analyzing mutant SoxR proteins defective in responding to oxidative stress signals in vivo.We have confirmed that the DNA binding domain of SoxR is highly conserved compared with other MerR family proteins and functions in a similar manner to activate transcription. Several mutations in the dimerization domain of SoxR disrupted intersubunit communication, and the resulting proteins were unable to propagate redox signals to the soxS promoter. Mutations scattered throughout the polypeptide yielded proteins that were under-responsive to in vivo redox signals, which indicates that the redox properties of the [2Fe-2S] centers are influenced by global protein structure. These findings indicate that SoxR functions as a redox-responsive molecular switch in which subunit interactions transduce a subtle alteration in oxidation state into a profound change in DNA structure."

ATRA-resistant NB4.R2 cells are also partially responsive to the action of piclamilast and retinoic acid receptor X agonists. Treatment of NB4 cells with piclamilast or ATRA results in activation of the cAMP signaling pathway and nuclear translocation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. This causes a transitory increase in cAMP-responsive element-binding protein phosphorylation, which is followed by down-modulation of the system. ATRA + piclamilast have no additive effects on the modulation of the cAMP pathway, and the combination has complex effects on cAMP-regulated genes. Piclamilast potentiates the ligand-dependent transactivation and degradation of RARα through a cAMP-dependent protein kinase-dependent phosphorylation. Enhanced transactivation is also observed in the case of PML-RARα. In NB4 cells, increased transactivation is likely to be at the basis of enhanced myeloid maturation and enhanced expression of many retinoid-dependent genes. Piclamilast and/or ATRA exert major effects on the expression of cEBP and STAT1, two types of transcription factors involved in myeloid maturation. Induction and activation of STAT1 correlates directly with enhanced cytodifferentiation.

ATRA induces complete clinical remission in the majority of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients (1Chomienne C. Fenaux P. Degos L. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 2Warrell Jr., R.P. Semin.

Paradoxically, APL is characterized by the prototypical t15:17 translocation, which involves the nuclear retinoic acid receptor RARα and leads to the expression of the aberrant fusion protein PML-RARα (1Chomienne C. Fenaux P. Degos L. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The success of ATRA in APL represents proof of principle that cytodifferentiation therapy (4Garattini E. Terao M. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2001; 1: 358-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) can be applied clinically. However, a more general use of ATRA at the clinical level is limited by toxicity and natural or induced resistance (5Biesalski H.K.

The identification of agents capable of augmenting the therapeutic index of ATRA may lead to the development of useful pharmacological combinations in the treatment of APL and other acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs). In addition, dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between these agents and retinoids in AML cells is likely to cast light on the process of myeloid maturation.Analogs of cAMP (8Gianni M.

In this report, we demonstrate that inhibition of phosphodiesterase IV (PDEIV), the enzyme that hydrolyzes cAMP to the corresponding nucleoside monophosphate, by piclamilast, potentiates the retinoid-dependent granulocytic maturation of the APL-derived NB4 and other AML cell lines. The molecular mechanisms underlying this potentiating effect are investigated in the NB4 model. Furthermore, we present initial evidence that the combination of ATRA and piclamilast is more effective than the single components in prolonging the life span of SCID mice transplanted with APL cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—ATRA, rolipram, H89, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-CPT-cAMP), dibutyryl-cAMP, H89, and 8-bromoadenosine-3′,5′-cyclicmonophosphorothioate-Rp-isomer (Rp-8-BrcAMP) were from Sigma.

The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor probe is a full-length human cDNA (16Gianni M. Terao M. Zanotta S. Barbui T. Rambaldi A. Garattini E. Blood. 1994; 83: 1909-1921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Protein extracts of NB4 cells were prepared as described (17Pisano C. Kollar P. Gianni M. Kalac Y. Giordano V. Ferrara F.F. Tancredi R.

Nuclear and cytosolic fractions were isolated with nuclear extract kit (Active Motif Europe, Rixensart, Belgium). The nuclear extracts are essentially free of cytosolic contamination. Similarly, cytosolic extracts (cytosol) are not significantly contaminated with cell nuclei. In fact, the protein band corresponding to the nuclear protein marker histone H3 is present only in the nuclear fraction, whereas the cytosolic marker caspase-3 is evident only in the cytosolic fraction (see Supplemental Fig. 1S).EMSAs using a CREB-specific oligonucleotide were conducted on nuclear extracts as reported (17Pisano C.

The antibodies directed against ERK-1/ERK-2, CREB, STAT1, and the corresponding phosphorylated forms were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The antibodies recognizing cEBPα (sc-9315), cEBPβ (sc-150), cEBPϵ (sc-158), PKA-rIα (sc-18798), PKA-rIIα (sc-908), PKA-cα (sc-903), histone H3 (sc-10809), cathepsin D (sc-6486), and β-actin (sc-8432) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

Blood. 2001; 97: 3234-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). CD11b, CD11c, CD38, and CD33 fluorescein-conjugated antibodies (Becton Dickinson Europe, Erembodegem, Belgium) were used for FACS, as described (16Gianni M. Terao M. Zanotta S. Barbui T. Rambaldi A. Garattini E. Blood. 1994; 83: 1909-1921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ELISAs were used to determine secreted monocyte chemotactic peptide 1 (MCP-1) (31Peri G. Milanese C. Matteucci C. Ruco L.

Kollar P. Gianni M. Kalac Y. Giordano V. Ferrara F.F. Tancredi R. Devoto A. Rinaldi A. Rambaldi A. Penco S. Marzi M. Moretti G. Vesci L. Tinti O. Carminati P. Terao M. Garattini E. Blood. 2002; 100: 3719-3730Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Piclamilast was dissolved in 0.5% carboxyl methyl cellulose, 0.01% Tween 80 solution and injected at a dose of 10 mg/kg. ATRA (Sigma) was dissolved in the same solution and injected at a dose of 15 mg/kg. Drugs were administered intraperitoneally in a volume of 100 μl/animal 1 day after the inoculation, and the treatment continued for 13 days (5 daily injections/week). Data on the survival of animals were analyzed considering the following parameters: median survival time (MST) and percentage increase in life span (MST-treated/MST control × 100) - 100). Statistical treatment of the results was conducted according to the Cox regression model (33Cox D.R. J. R. Stat. Soc. 1972; B34: 187-220Google Scholar).RESULTSInhibition of PDEIV Enhances and Accelerates the Differentiation of the ATRA-sensitive NB4 Cell Line—As illustrated in Fig. 1A, upon RT-PCR analysis, the APL-derived NB4 blast synthesizes detectable amounts of the transcripts coding for members of the PDEIV A, B, and D families. PDEIVC substitutes PDEIVB in the monoblastic cell line U937, which is used as a positive control (34MacKenzie S.J. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 571-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) in these experiments. Treatment of NB4 cells with ATRA for 4 days does not affect the levels of the various PDEIV transcripts.Challenge with combinations of ATRA and various PDEIV inhibitors, such as rolipram and piclamilast, enhances the ATRA-dependent maturation of NB4 cells (data not shown). Since piclamilast belongs to a chemical series of promising PDEIV inhibitors undergoing phase II/III clinical trials (22Bundschuh D.S. Eltze M. Barsig J. Wollin L. Hatzelmann A. Beume R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 297: 280-290PubMed Google Scholar), all subsequent experiments were conducted with this molecule.The effect of piclamilast on the morphological differentiation of NB4 cells is illustrated in Fig. 1B. Relative to what was observed with ATRA alone, NB4 cultures treated for 3 days with ATRA (0.1 μm) + piclamilast (30 μm) showed an increased proportion of cells with lobated nuclei, cytoplasmic granules, and/or elevated cytoplasm/nucleus volume ratios, three parameters that are associated with granulocytic maturation (27Charrad R.S. Gadhoum Z. Qi J. Glachant A. Allouche M. Jasmin C. Chomienne C. Smadja-Joffe F. Blood. 2002; 99: 290-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). No detectable myeloid maturation is evident upon treatment with the PDEIV inhibitor alone. Enhanced morphological maturation by ATRA + piclamilast is associated with a parallel stimulation of the synthesis of ctsD, a retinoid-regulated and lysosomal differentiation marker (35Levy J. Kolski G.B. Douglas S.D. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 1632-1634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enhancing effect of piclamilast is not limited to ctsD and extends to the other surface differentiation marker, CD11b, as demonstrated by the FACS analysis shown in Fig. 1C. Maximal induction of CD11b is observed at the highest concentration of ATRA considered (0.01 μm), both in terms of the number of positive cells and mean associated fluorescence. At 0.001 μm ATRA, the addition of piclamilast results in a doubling of the number of CD11b-positive cells. At 0.01 μm ATRA, the PDEIV inhibitor maintains a significant stimulating effect on CD11b mean associated fluorescence. Similar effects are not evident in the case of CD11c and CD38, two other ATRA-regulated surface antigens. As expected (16Gianni M. Terao M. Zanotta S. Barbui T. Rambaldi A. Garattini E. Blood. 1994; 83: 1909-1921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), undifferentiated and ATRA-, piclamilast-, or ATRA + piclamilast-treated NB4 cells are positive for CD33.Induction of the cell membrane enzymatic complex, NBT-R, is another popular myeloid marker used to assess granulocytic maturation of APL cells. Piclamilast (30 μm) enhances the ATRA-dependent induction of NBT-R in NB4 cells. Enhanced NBT-R is evident both when the enzymatic activity is measured in cell extracts and when the number of NBT-R+ cells is counted (data not shown). The enhancing effect of piclamilast is similar to that observed with the cAMP analogue, 8-CPT-cAMP (data not shown). Fig. 2A demonstrates that treatment with piclamilast (30 μm) does not result in a significant increase in the number of NBT-R+ NB4 at any of the time points considered. However, when the PDEIV inhibitor is added to ATRA, the retinoid-dependent increase of NB4 positive cells is enhanced and accelerated. Enhanced NBT-R activity is not only time-dependent but also dose-dependent relative to ATRA (Fig. 2B) and piclamilast (Fig. 2C). When ATRA is present in the medium at a concentration of 0.1 μm, a significant increase in the levels of retinoid-induced NBT-R is already observed with 1 μm piclamilast, and the effect plateaus at 30 μm. In the absence of ATRA, even high concentrations of piclamilast (100 μm) are ineffective in inducing NBT-R. Piclamilast has a growth-inhibitory action at all of the concentrations tested, and the action is augmented by the presence of ATRA. When the concentration of piclamilast is kept constant at 30 μm, enhancement of the ATRA-dependent induction of NBT-R is evident at all of the concentrations of the retinoid. A similar dose-response curve is observed in the case of the antiproliferative effect of ATRA + piclamilast.Fig. 2Time- and concentration-dependent effects of piclamilast and ATRA on NBT-R activity.A, NB4 cells (150,000/ml) were treated with vehicle (Me2SO), ATRA, piclamilast, or the combin"
https://openalex.org/W2065265981,"Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) is normally synthesized at low levels but is elevated in various pathophysiological conditions including diabetes-associated vascular diseases. FGF-2 expression is regulated translationally through an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) located in its mRNA, which allows a nonclassical cap-independent translation. We addressed the pathophysiological regulation of the IRES in vivo by using a streptozotocin-induced hyperglycemic model known to suppress markedly overall translation. Evaluation of FGF-2 IRES-dependent translation was performed with transgenic mice expressing dual luciferase bicistronic mRNA containing the FGF-2 IRES. FGF-2 IRES-dependent reporter activity increased 240% of control in the diabetic aorta although the reporter mRNA levels significantly decreased. Expression of endogenous FGF-2 protein in the aorta closely correlated with the IRES activity but not with FGF-2 mRNA levels. Moreover, the biosynthesis of endogenous FGF-2 protein was stimulated in an IRES-dependent manner by high glucose that significantly suppressed global protein synthesis in aortic smooth muscle cells from the transgenic mice. These results suggest that IRES-dependent translational regulation could play a pathological role in FGF-2 expression in vivo, especially in the cardiovascular consequences of diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2091286525,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hal3 is a conserved protein that binds the carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain of the PP1c (protein phosphatase 1)-related phosphatase Ppz1 and potently inhibits its activity, thus modulating all of the characterized functions so far of the phosphatase. It is unknown how Hal3 binds to Ppz1 and inhibits its activity. Although it contains a putative protein phosphatase 1c binding-like sequence (263KLHVLF268), mutagenesis analysis suggests that this motif is not required for Ppz1 binding and inhibition. The mutation of the conserved His378 (possibly involved in dehydrogenase catalytic activity) did not impair Hal3 functions or Ppz1 binding. Random mutagenesis of the 228 residue-conserved central region of Hal3 followed by a loss-of-function screen allowed the identification of nine residues important for Ppz1-related Hal3 functions. Seven of these residues cluster in a relatively small region spanning from amino acid 446 to 480. Several mutations affected Ppz1 binding and inhibition in vitro, whereas changes in Glu460 and Val462 did not alter binding but resulted in Hal3 versions unable to inhibit the phosphatase. Therefore, there are independent Hal3 structural elements required for Ppz1 binding and inhibition. S. cerevisiae encodes a protein (Vhs3) structurally related to Hal3. Recent evidence suggests that both mutations are synthetically lethal. Surprisingly, versions of Hal3 carrying mutations that strongly affected Ppz1 binding or inhibitory capacity were able to complement lethality. In contrast, the mutation of His378 did not. This finding suggests that Hal3 may have both Ppz1-dependent and independent functions involving different structural elements.

This finding suggests that Hal3 may have both Ppz1-dependent and independent functions involving different structural elements. In contrast with the high number of protein kinases, eukaryotic cells contain a relatively small number of proteins with Ser/Thr protein phosphatase activity. A general strategy to refine specificity and to allow fine control of thousands of different dephosphorylation reactions in the cells has been the association of a catalytic subunit with a number of different regulatory subunits, which would confer to the catalytic protein specificity for given substrate(s), defined regulatory properties, or/and restricted subcellular location. Such a strategy is particularly important in the case of type 1 Ser/Thr phosphatases (for review see Refs. 1Cohen P.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Bollen M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 426-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Ppz1 is a type 1-related yeast Ser/Thr protein phosphatase composed of a catalytic carboxyl-terminal domain and an NH2-terminal extension (3Posas F. Casamayor A. Morral N. Arino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11734-11740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic domain is approximately 60% identical to the mammalian and plant catalytic subunits of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1c). 1The abbreviations used are: PP1c, protein phosphatase 1; CM, complete minimal medium; CM-uracil, CM lacking uracil; GST, glutathione S-transferase. In yeast cells, Ppz1 is involved in a variety of cell processes including regulation of salt tolerance, maintenance of cell wall integrity, and regulation of cell cycle at the G1/S transition (4Arino J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1072-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These functions can be explained as a result of an inhibitory activity on the Trk1/Trk2 potassium transporters (5Yenush L. Mulet J.M. Arino J. Serrano R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 920-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), although Trk-independent functions have been also reported (6Ruiz A. Yenush L. Arino J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 937-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The activity of Ppz1 is regulated by Hal3/Sis2, a conserved protein identified several years ago in two independent screens as a high-copy suppressor of the sit4 growth defect (7Di Como C.J. Bose R. Arndt K.T. Genetics. 1995; 139: 95-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and by its capacity to confer halotolerance (8Ferrando A. Kron S.J. Rios G. Fink G.R. Serrano R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5470-5481Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Hal3 acts as a negative regulatory subunit of Ppz1 by binding to the phosphatase carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain (9de Nadal E. Clotet J. Posas F. Serrano R. Gomez N. Arino J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7357-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and strongly inhibits Ppz1 activity, thus modulating its diverse physiological functions. Therefore, the overexpression of Hal3 provides increased salt tolerance, whereas hal3 cells are hypersensitive to sodium and lithium cations. sit4 and hal3 mutations display synthetic lethality due to G1 blockade, whereas high-copy expression of HAL3 accelerates entry into S phase after an α-factor-induced G1 arrest in a sit4 mutant (7Di Como C.J. Bose R. Arndt K.T. Genetics. 1995; 139: 95-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Simon E. Clotet J. Calero F. Ramos J. Arino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29740-29747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Finally, high-copy expression of Hal3 aggravates the lytic phenotype of a Slt2/Mpk1 MAP kinase mutant, whereas, in contrast, a lack of HAL3 improves growth of this strain (9de Nadal E. Clotet J. Posas F. Serrano R. Gomez N. Arino J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7357-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Homologs of Hal3 have been found in plants and animals (11Espinosa-Ruiz A. Belles J.M. Serrano R. Culianez-Macia F.A. Plant J. 1999; 20: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), although they lack the acidic tail. The Arabidopsis thaliana AtHal3a isoform was found to be a flavoprotein able to partially complement a hal3 yeast mutant. Resolution of its three-dimensional structure allows Albert et al. (12Albert A. Martinez-Ripoll M. Espinosa-Ruiz A. Yenush L. Culianez-Macia F.A. Serrano R. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 961-969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (44) Google Scholar) to propose that the plant protein could act as a dehydrogenase through a mechanism that might involve His90, a residue conserved in yeast Hal3 (His378). Further work uncovered that AtHal3a could catalyze the decarboxylation of 4′-phosphopantothenoylcysteine (13Kupke T. Hernandez-Acosta P. Steinbacher S. Culianez-Macia F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19190-19196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), suggesting that this protein could be involved in coenzyme A biosynthesis, and pointed out an important role of Cys175 in the catalytic mechanism (13Kupke T.

It is worth noting that a such Cys residue is not conserved in yeast Hal3. The S. cerevisiae genome contains two genes, VHS3 and YKL088w, encoding proteins that are 49 and 28% identical to Hal3, respectively. Recent evidence suggests that Vhs3 could be functionally related to Hal3 on the basis that high-copy VHS3 partially complements the absence of Hal3 function (15Munoz I. Simon E. Casals N. Clotet J. Arino J. Yeast. 2003; 20: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and that recent work in our laboratory has revealed that Vhs3 binds to and inhibits Ppz1 in vitro (16Ruiz A. Munoz I. Serrano R. Gonzalez A. Simon E. Arino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34421-34430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The mechanism of binding between PP1c and its different regulatory subunits and how these interactions modulate the phosphatase activity has received considerable attention in the last few years, particularly after the elucidation of the PP1c structure (17Goldberg J.

Biol. 1995; 254: 942-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). A number of structural features shared by most known PP1c regulatory subunits have been defined. The most common one is the existence of a motif, initially identified as a RVXF sequence (19Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 20Zhao S. Lee E.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28368-28372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and subsequently found in many regulatory subunits as more or less conserved variations of the original sequence. In addition to this motif, additional interactions sites are probably required in many cases (for review see Ref. 1Cohen P.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, besides the early observation that the characteristic highly acidic tail of Hal3 is required for function in vivo (7Di Como C.J. Bose R. Arndt K.T. Genetics. 1995; 139: 95-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ferrando A. Kron S.J. Rios G. Fink G.R. Serrano R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5470-5481Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), very little is known regarding the structural elements defining the cellular role of Hal3 or its function as phosphatase inhibitor. Interestingly, Hal3 does not structurally resemble previously characterized PP1c phosphatase inhibitors and it does not bind or inhibit in vitro yeast PP1c (encoded by GLC7 in S. cerevisiae) (9de Nadal E. Clotet J. Posas F. Serrano R. Gomez N. Arino J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7357-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 21Garcia-Gimeno M.A. Munoz I. Arino J. Sanz P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47744-47752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, previous experience and knowledge on the regulation of Glc7 by its diverse regulatory subunits were of little help to face the question of how Hal3 might bind to and inhibit Ppz1. To gain insight into the Hal3 regulatory mechanisms, we have developed a mutagenesis analysis followed by a loss-of-function genetic screen aiming to identify residues relevant for Hal3 function. The results presented here show that His378 has no function in regulating Ppz1 activity and allow us to identify a number of residues, most of them clustering between residues 446 and 480, which are important for Ppz1 binding and/or inhibition. In addition, we provide evidence pointing to possible Ppz1-independent functions for Hal3.

Clotet J. Posas F. Serrano R. Gomez N. Arino J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7357-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Restriction reactions, DNA ligations, and other standard recombinant DNA techniques were carried out as described previously (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The source for the HAL3 gene was plasmid YEp351-HAL3, which contains a 2.4-kbp BclI-HindIII DNA genomic fragment (8Ferrando A. Kron S.J. Rios G. Fink G.R. Serrano R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5470-5481Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Plasmid pGEM3Z-HAL3 was constructed by digestion of YEp351-HAL3 with EcoRI/HindIII and cloning of the 2.4-kbp fragment into the same sites of plasmid pGEM3Z (Promega). Plasmid YEplac195-Hal3 was obtained by cloning the EcoRI/HindIII HAL3 fragment into the same sites of YEplac195 (23Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2521) Google Scholar). Mutation of His265 to glycine was made by PCR using oligonucleotides 5′-Hal3H265AR and 3′-Hal3HpaI (see Supplemental Table) to amplify a fragment of ∼700 bp that was then digested and cloned into the BamHI/HpaI sites of the gapped YEplac195-Hal3 to yield YEp195-Hal3(H265G). The mutation of Phe268 to alanine was made in a similar way but using oligonucleotides 5′-Hal3F268A and 3′-Hal3HpaI. The version of Hal3 in which His378 was replaced by alanine was made by a sequential PCR strategy using the pairs of oligonucleotides 5′-HAL3BamHI/3′-HAL3His378Ala and 5′-HAL3His378Ala/3′-HAL3HpaI in the first step and 5′-Hal3BamHI and 3′-Hal3HpaI in the second step. The amplification fragment was cloned into the BamHI/HpaI sites of the gapped YEplac195-Hal3 to yield YEp195-Hal3(H378A). Random PCR Mutagenesis and Screen for Loss of Hal3 Activity— Random PCR mutagenesis was performed essentially as described by Fromant et al. (24Fromant M. Blanquet S. Plateau P. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) using MgCl2 at a final concentration of 4.7 mm to minimize the occurrence of insertions and/or deletions. YEp351-HAL3 and oligonucleotides 5′-Hal3BamH1_2 and 3′-Hal3HpaI_2 were used to amplify the 716-bp fragment between the BamHI and the HpaI sites found in the HAL3 coding sequence. Four different reactions were made in the presence of one of the forcing dNTPs. The products of several independent PCR reactions were pooled, purified, and digested with BamHI and HpaI and cloned in the same sites of the gapped plasmid pGEM3Z-HAL3. Ligation products were introduced into E. coli competent cells by electroporation. Approximately 30,000 independent colonies were recovered and mixed. Plasmid DNA was prepared, digested with EcoRI/HindIII, and electrophoresed. The 2.4-kbp band was recovered and cloned into YEplac195 to yield at least 30,000 colonies. The plasmid library was used to transform strain JC010 (slt2Δ) using enough DNA to yield around 3000 transformants/plate (determined using control CM lacking uracil (CM-uracil) plates and containing 1 m sorbitol). Approximately 40,000 transformants were plated in CM-uracil medium, and plates were incubated for 48–72 h. Clones able to generate macroscopic colonies under these conditions (usually 20–30/plate) were picked out and grown for an additional 3–6 h in sterile 96-well plates filled with CM-uracil medium. They were then replicated in CM-uracil plates and in the same plates containing 1 m sorbitol, 1 m NaCl, 0.2 m LiCl, or 3 mm caffeine for initial characterization of the clones. Plasmids from the selected clones were then extracted, amplified in E. coli, and subjected to restriction mapping to verify the nature of the insert. The constructs were reintroduced in strain JC010, and the phenotypes were reassessed as indicated above. Clones showing a consistent behavior were considered positives and subjected to further analysis. To ensure that the absence of function did not result from truncations of the protein, the presence of the entire Hal3 protein was assessed. For this purpose, yeast cell lysates of selected clones were prepared as described by de Nadal et al. (9de Nadal E. Clotet J. Posas F. Serrano R. Gomez N. Arino J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7357-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), 40 μg of total protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and Hal3 was inmunodetected using anti-Hal3 polyclonal antibodies. The plasmids expressing a full-length protein then were subjected to sequence analysis covering the entire BamHI-HpaI fragment in search of mutations producing a change in the amino acidic sequence of the protein that could be responsible for the loss of Hal3 function. All of the mutated versions of HAL3 were removed from YEplac195 by digestion with EcoRI and HindIII, and the resulting 2.4-kbp fragments were cloned into the same sites of plasmids YCp33 (URA3 marker), YCp22 (TRP1 marker), and YEplac 112 (TRP1 marker). In Vitro Binding Assays—In vitro binding assays were performed as follows. GST-Ppz1Δ1–344 was expressed in bacteria and bound to glutathione-agarose beads essentially as described previously (21Garcia-Gimeno M.A. Munoz I. Arino J. Sanz P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47744-47752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Yeast extracts of strain IM021 (ppz1 hal3) transformed with the YEplac195 multicopy plasmids carrying the different versions of Hal3 under study were basically prepared as described by de Nadal et al. (9de Nadal E. Clotet J. Posas F. Serrano R. Gomez N. Arino J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7357-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). 1 mg of total protein from each sample was mixed with 50 μl of the affinity beads and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking. The washing procedure was essentially as described previously (9de Nadal E. Clotet J. Posas F. Serrano R. Gomez N. Arino J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7357-7362Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) with the exception that the beads were finally resuspended in 100 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer and boiled. Samples (10 μl) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and probed using anti-Hal3 polyclonal antibodies. In Vitro Phosphatase Assays—The effect of the different versions of Hal3 as inhibitors of Ppz1 phosphatase activity was analyzed using bacterially expressed proteins. To this end, the entire open reading frame of the different HAL3 versions was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides 5′-HAL3EcoRI and 3′-HAL3 XhoI to generate a 1.7-kbp fragment that was then cloned into these same sites of plasmid pGEX6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The different versions of GST-Hal3 generated were expressed using 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for induction at 37 °C for 3 h. Conditions of expression and purification of bacterial recombinant GST-Ppz1Δ1–344 were essentially as described previously (21Garcia-Gimeno M.A. Munoz I. Arino J. Sanz P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47744-47752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Once bound to the glutathione-agarose affinity column, the recombinant phosphatase was treated for 4 h at 4 °C with PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's indications (80 units/ml resin) to cleave the GST moiety. The eluted GST-free phosphatase was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and quantified. Because bacterial expression of the different GST-Hal3 versions produced variable amounts of shorter polypeptides, the amount of intact GST-Hal3 present in the samples used in the assays was determined as follows. A 10-μl aliquot of each version eluted from the glutathione-agarose affinity column was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue-stained. The gel was scanned, and the amount of intact protein in each sample was quantified by comparison using commercial software with different amounts of a bovine serum albumin solution of known concentration. The Ppz1 phosphatase activity was measured using p-nitrophenylphosphate as substrate essentially as described previously (21Garcia-Gimeno M.A. Munoz I. Arino J. Sanz P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47744-47752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. 0.5 μg of Ppz1 phosphatase was used, the concentration of substrate was 10 mm, and the assay was carried out for 20 min at 30 °C. Different amounts of each version of GST-Hal3 were incubated in the presence of the phosphatase for 5 min at 30 °C, and the assay was started by the addition of the substrate. Other Techniques—Growth on plates (drop tests) was assessed as described previously (25Posas F. Camps M. Arino J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13036-13041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Random spore analysis was performed essentially as described previously (26Treco D.A. Winston F. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998: 13.2.10-13.2.11Google Scholar). Evaluation of the Functional Relevance of His378 and the265HVLF268 Residues in Hal3—As mentioned in the Introduction, Hal3 does not exhibit significant similarity with known regulatory subunits of type 1 protein phosphatases. However, it contains a HVLF sequence (residues 265–268) that resembles the consensus RVXF sequence found in many PP1c regulatory subunits and we considered it necessary to evaluate whether this region could act as a regulatory element. To this end, we mutated His265 to glycine and Phe268 to alanine and tested the ability of these versions of Hal3 to mimic the function of the native protein, both at normal levels and under overexpression conditions. As shown in Fig. 1, the mutation of Phe268 to Ala did not affect the ability of the protein to restore wild type tolerance in a hal3 strain, whereas a change of His265 to Gly reduced this ability partially (Fig. 1, upper panel). When these HAL3 versions were overexpressed, they behaved essentially as the wild type forms (data not shown). When overexpressed, both versions were also able to block growth of a slt2/mpk1 strain in the absence of sorbitol, similarly to native Hal3 (Fig. 1, middle panel). Finally, when they were expressed in low-copy (Fig. 1, lower panel), both versions allowed the growth of strain JC002 (sit4 tetO:HAL3), which suffers a G1/S blockade in the presence of doxycycline due to lack of HAL3 expression (10Simon E. Clotet J. Calero F. Ramos J. Arino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29740-29747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). On the basis of the structure of the AtHal3a protein, it was reasonable to assume that His378 in S. cerevisiae Hal3 (equivalent to AtHal3a His90) could have functional relevance. However, when we mutated this residue to Ala and performed all of the functional tests described above, this mutated version of Hal3 displayed a completely wild type phenotype (Fig. 1). Previous work has shown that the Hal3 functions tested above are mediated by Ppz1 and result from inhibition of this phosphatase. Therefore, we investigated whether these mutated versions were still able to effectively bind and inhibit Ppz1. A GST-fused version of the phosphatase domain was expressed in E. coli and bound to glutathione-agarose to form an affinity system for Hal3. The different Hal3 versions were expressed at similar levels in ppz1 yeast cells, and extracts were allowed to bind to the affinity beads. As shown in Fig. 2, left panel, the F268A and H378A versions were able to bind Ppz1 as the wild type form, whereas the H265G form was slightly less effective. To test the capacity of the different Hal3 versions to inhibit the catalytic activity of Ppz1, they were expressed in E. coli and in vitro inhibition assays were carried out. As it can be observed in Fig. 2, right panel, the F268A and H378A versions displayed an inhibitory potency very similar to that of wild type Hal3. The H265G mutated form allowed almost full inhibition of Ppz1, although it was slightly less effective than native Hal3. In conclusion, these results indicates that the 265HVLF268 motif in Hal3 is probably not critical for Ppz1 binding and inhibition. Similarly His378, although theoretically equivalent to AtHal3a His90, is not relevant for Ppz1 regulation. A Screen for Mutations Resulting in Loss of Function Reveals a Small Region in Hal3 Important for Ppz1 Binding and/or Inhibition—As the approach described above failed to reveal residues important for regulation of Ppz1 by Hal3, we decided to create a PCR-based library of mutated versions of the regulatory protein and set up a screen for loss of function. The region was subjected to mutagenesis encompassed from Arg256 to Ile480 just upstream of the highly acidic tail, and it corresponds to the most conserved region among eukaryotes. This approach depicted in Fig. 3 is based on the ability of high-copy expression of HAL3 to inhibit growth in synthetic medium of a slt2/mpk1 mutant except if an osmotic stabilizer, such as sorbitol, is present. Therefore, transformants growing in the non-permissive conditions should harbor non-functional forms of Hal3. The screen of ∼40,000 colonies yielded around 225 positive clones. The subsequent analysis of the plasmid insert allowed the discarding of ∼50% of those inserts. The remaining clones were introduced again in strain JC10 (slt2/mpk1) and re-tested for growth. Protein extracts were prepared from 85 clones, subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, and transferred to membranes, and immunoblots were developed using anti-Hal3 polyclonal antibody. Approximately 80% of the clones did not give signal with the antibody, did not contain a full size protein (probably due to premature stop codons), or exhibited the right protein size but at low levels of expression and therefore were also discarded. 17 clones passed all of these tests and were subjected to DNA sequencing in search of mutations. The relevant changes identified in this study are shown in Table II. Nine changes appeared to be unique. Interestingly, they were not scattered through the entire region that was subjected to mutagenesis but mostly concentrated in the last 40 carboxyl-terminal residues. In three cases, multiple mutations affecting more than one amino acid were found. It is worth noting that two of them included a change also found as a single mutation. The third one represents a triple change in which one of the mutations (S459P) lies in the vicinity of several residues affected by single mutations. These multiple mutated versions have not been further characterized.Table IIMutations in the Hal3 protein identified by the loss-of-function screenAmino acid changeCodon mutationSingle changesY313DTAT to GAT (1)V390GGTA to GGA (1)I446KATA to AAA (3)W452GTGG to GGG (1)E460GGAG to GGG (1)V462AGT"

It is greatly down-regulated in breast cancer, and its re-expression suppresses tumorigenesis by an unknown mechanism. To establish a mouse model, we identified the mouse ortholog of hCLCA2, termed mCLCA5, and investigated its behavior in mammary epithelial cell lines and tissues. Expression in the immortalized cell line HC11 correlated with slow or arrested growth. Although rapidly dividing, sparsely plated cells had low levels of expression, mCLCA5 was induced by 10-fold when cells became confluent and 30-fold when cells were deprived of growth factors or anchorage. The apoptosis effector Bax was induced in parallel. Like hCLCA2, mCLCA5 was down-regulated in metastatic mammary tumor cell lines such as 4T1 and CSML-100. Ectopic re-expression in 4T1 cells caused a 20-fold reduction in colony survival relative to vector control. High mCLCA5 expression in stable clones inhibited proliferation and enhanced sensitivity to detachment. Moreover, mCLCA5 was induced in lactating and involuting mammary gland, correlating with differentiation and onset of apoptosis. Together, these results establish mCLCA5 as the mouse ortholog of hCLCA2, demonstrate that mCLCA5 is a detachment-sensitive growth inhibitor, and suggest a mechanism whereby these channels may antagonize mammary tumor progression.

Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2786) Google Scholar). Metastatic tumor cells are usually nearly impervious to anoikis due to mutations that inactivate apoptotic signaling, enhance survival signaling, or both (1Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A.

Much effort has been invested in identifying new tumor suppression mechanisms that are lost in the evolution of the metastatic cell. Epithelial cells, from which most human cancers are derived, exist at a boundary between the organism and its external environment and so must maintain a vast array of plasma membrane ion channels, sensitive to a range of internal or external cues, to maintain homeostasis in the face of sudden environmental changes.

Ectopic expression of hCLCA2 in cancer cell lines greatly reduced tumorigenicity in nude mice, suggesting that hCLCA2 is a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. hCLCA2 belongs to a recently discovered family of proteins, currently comprising about a dozen members, that are widely expressed in mammals but apparently not beyond (19Gruber A.D.

Various family members are found in epithelia, endothelia, and smooth muscle of multiple organs (21Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol.

CLCAs do not resemble any other known Cl– channel (i.e. CFTR, ligand-gated channels, or the CLC or CLIC families) or any other protein. The family is deeply divergent, some members sharing as little as 36% identity, yet all share certain signatory features. The prototypical CLCA family member is a type I transmembrane protein about 900 amino acids in length with a proteolytic cleavage near amino acid 680 that results in products of 90 kDa and 30–40 kDa that are found in close association on the exterior surface of the plasma membrane (19Gruber A.D. Pauli B.U. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5488-5491PubMed Google Scholar, 24Elble R.C. Widom J. Gruber A.D. Abdel-Ghany M. Levine R. Goodwin A. Cheng H.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol.

Potential phosphorylation sites for calmodulin kinase II and protein kinase C are consistent with calcium regulation, and ectopic expression of CLCA proteins leads to a novel chloride current that is activated by calcium and blocked by typical chloride channel inhibitors such as DIDS (19Gruber A.D. Pauli B.U. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5488-5491PubMed Google Scholar, 23Cunningham S.A. Awayda M.S. Bubien J.K. Ismailov I.I. Arrate M.P. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. Fuller C.M. J. Biol.

In addition to chloride conductance, several members of this family have been shown to interact with integrin β4 via a short, semiconserved motif found in both the 90- and 30–40-kDa subunits (29Abdel-Ghany M.

Four CLCA family members have been reported in mouse, all only distantly related (∼40% identical) to hCLCA2, an evolutionary outlier of the family (25Elble R.C. Ji G. Nehrke K. DeBiasio J. Kingsley P.D. Kotlikoff M.I. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18586-18591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To establish an animal model of hCLCA2 in mammary gland development and neoplasia, we sought a true ortholog. We report here the identification of this ortholog, termed mCLCA5, and show that, like hCLCA2, it is expressed in normal mammary epithelium but down-regulated in metastatic cell lines. Furthermore, mCLCA5 is a detachment-inducible gene, the ectopic expression of which suppresses the growth and survival of a metastatic tumor cell line while having little effect on the growth of normal mammary epithelial cells. These results demonstrate that mCLCA5 is the murine counterpart of hCLCA2 and provide insight into the likely tumor suppression mechanism. Cell Lines and Culture—The mouse mammary epithelial cell line, HC11, was obtained from Dr. Nancy Hynes (Friedrich Miescher Institute, Basel, Switzerland). HC11 was maintained in complete medium (CM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 μg/ml insulin, and 10 ng/ml recombinant human epidermal growth factor). CSML-0 and CSML-100 were a gift from Dr. S. Zain (University of Rochester School of Medicine). The cell line series, 67NR, 4T07, and 4T1, was obtained from Dr. Fred Miller (Karmanos Cancer Institute). All tumor cell lines were grown in normal medium (NM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum). Serum-free medium (SFM: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) was used in starvation and anchorage deprivation experiments. Population doubling times were determined by seeding cells at different densities in triplicate in 24-well plates, trypsinizing, and manually counting at 24-h intervals. Doubling times (Dt) were computed using the formula Dt = t/3.3log(N1/N0), where t is time, N0 is the starting cell number, and N1 is the cell number at time t. Identification and Cloning of mCLCA5—A BLAST search using the cDNA sequence of hCLCA2 revealed a previously unknown mouse CLCA that had sequence identity to hCLCA2. Two expressed sequence tags were obtained, corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the ORF (GenBank™ accession numbers BB368914 and AV170822, respectively). RNA was extracted from the mouse mammary tumor cell line, CSML-0, reverse-transcribed (Superscript, Invitrogen), and used as the template in PCR. A 2.9-kb product was amplified by PCR (94 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 60 s; 72 °C, 3 min + 5 s/cycle; 40 cycles) using primers corresponding to the ends of the ORF (5′-TCCCCGTGAATAAACCAGAG-3′ and 5′-GGTCATGTCCATCCTACCTAAG-3′) and the high fidelity Pfu/Taq polymerase (Herculase Hotstart, Stratagene). The product was purified and cloned into pGEM T-easy vector (Promega), and three clones were sequenced. An error-free clone was selected by comparison with expressed sequence tags and smaller PCR products spanning the ORF. The clone was digested with NotI, and the insert was transferred to the NotI site of pcDNA3.1-Zeo. Addition and Detection of Epitope Tag—A hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag was added to the carboxyl terminus by replacing the 3′ 215-bp Bsu36I/XhoI fragment with a PCR product that fused the mCLCA5 ORF with coding sequences for the 9-amino-acid HA epitope, YPYDUPDYA. The construct was transfected into HEK293T cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with anti-HA antibodies Y11 and F7, respectively (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Semiquantitative RT-PCR—Relative differences in mCLCA5 expression were determined by semiquantitative PCR (30Kinoshita T. Imamura J. Nagai H. Shimotohno K. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 31Freeman W.M. Walker S.J. Vrana K.E. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 112-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). For every experimental sample, total RNA was quantified both spectrophotometrically and electrophoretically, and amounts were adjusted so that 1 μg was reverse-transcribed (Superscript, Invitrogen). All samples to be compared were reverse-transcribed in parallel, and 5% of each reaction was used as template for PCR with Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The appropriate cycle number was determined empirically for each amplicon so that reaction yields were analyzed in log phase. For the internal control GAPDH, duplicate samples were run for 23, 24 or 25 cycles, and mCLCA5 reactions were run for 35–40 cycles. The most representative gel images were selected for inclusion in the figures. Significant relative differences were quantified by PCR-amplifying serial dilutions of each sample in parallel and scanning gel images densitometrically. Significant results were confirmed by repeating each experiment from the start. Organ and Tissue Distribution of mCLCA5 by RT-PCR—Primer pairs specific for mCLCA5 were designed based on alignment of the five known mouse CLCA genes and bracketed one intron to exclude amplification of genomic DNA. Primers were 5′-AGTCATCGGGCTGAAACTTG-3′ and 5′-GAGGAATGTGCATCCTTCCCT-3′, starting at bases 27 and 667, respectively. Initially, a mouse multitissue cDNA array normalized to β-actin (RapidScan, Origene) was probed (94 °C, 20 s; 58 °C, 45 s; 72 °C, 45 s; 40 cycles). To confirm and extend these results, the organs identified in the array and several others were isolated from a C57BL/6 mouse. RNA was reverse-transcribed and amplified as above, with GAPDH as an internal control for RNA amount (primers: 5′-ACGACCCCTTCATTGACCTC-3′ and 5′-CTTTCCAGAGGGGCCATCCAC-3′) (21Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40510-40517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Serum Deprivation—4T1 and HC11 cells were grown to confluency in NM and CM, respectively, in 6-cm dishes. RNA was harvested from one plate (zero time point), and the medium in five other identical plates was changed to SFM. RNA was harvested 4, 8, 24, 48, and 72 h later, reverse-transcribed, and analyzed by PCR for mCLCA5 and GAPDH as described above. Anchorage Deprivation—4T1 and HC11 cells were grown to confluency. RNA from one plate was harvested (zero time point); a second identical plate was treated with trypsin and resuspended in SFM. Equal numbers of cells were aliquoted into polypropylene 1.5-ml tubes (Costar) and rotated end-over-end at 37 °C for 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h. RNA was harvested, reverse-transcribed, and subjected to PCR for mCLCA5 and GAPDH as described above. Bax primers were 5′-TCCGGGAGCAGCTTGGGAGC-3′ and 5′-CACAAAGATGGTCACTGTCTG-3′ (94 °C, 20 s; 55 °C, 45 s; 72 °C, 45 s; 35 cycles) (21Elble R.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40510-40517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Cell Death Assays—Aliquots of cells were plated after trypsinization (zero time point) or end-over-end rotation (24-h time point) and stained with propidium iodide (4 μg/ml). Cells that took up propidium iodide were counted as dead cells. Random fields of cells were counted totaling 500–1000 cells/time point, and average absolute percentages plus one standard deviation were plotted for comparison. Survival Assays—4T1 and HC11 cells were electroporated with 5 μg of either pcDNA3.1Zeo vector or pcDNA3.1Zeo-mCLCA5 plus 1 μg of pEGFP-C3 (Clontech) to normalize for transfection efficiency. The cells were replated, allowed to recover for 72 h, and then treated with trypsin, resuspended, and counted with trypan blue (Invitrogen). Equal numbers of cells were seeded in 6-well plates and subjected to antibiotic selection for 10 days (NM plus 750 μg/ml zeocin for 4T1 and CM plus 400 μg/ml zeocin for HC11). Vector- and mCLCA5-transfected populations were normalized for transfection efficiency by counting the percentage of cells expressing GFP in five random fields (∼150 cells/field). The resulting colonies were stained with crystal violet (5% solution in 20% methanol). After photography, the crystal violet was eluted with 10% acetic acid overnight, and the absorbance at 562 nm was determined to quantitate differences in survival between vector- and mCLCA5-transfected cells. Discovery and Cloning of mCLCA5—A Blast search of the Ensembl Mouse Genome Server (32Hubbard T. Barker D. Birney E. Cameron G. Chen Y. Clark L. Cox T. Cuff J. Curwen V. Down T. Durbin R. Eyras E.

Stalker J. Stupka E. Ureta-Vidal A. Vastrik I. Clamp M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 38-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar) using the hCLCA2 ORF revealed a series of expressed sequence tags clustered on chromosome 3 (H3 region) with sequence identity to hCLCA2. Two expressed sequence tags were identified with similarity to the 3′ and 5′ ends, respectively, of the hCLCA2 ORF. Primers based on these sequences were used to amplify the entire ORF of the suspected ortholog by RT-PCR of mouse mammary epithelial cell line RNA. The resulting product showed high sequence identity to hCLCA2, 78% at the nucleotide level and 72% at the amino acid level (Fig. 1A), and was named mCLCA5 in accordance with established CLCA nomenclature, which is chronological within species (27Gruber A.D. Fuller C.M. Elble R.C. Benos D.J. Pauli B.U. Current Genomics. 2000; 1: 201-222Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). By contrast, other family members retain only 38–45% amino acid identity with hCLCA2 and cluster independently on a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1B). In addition to the higher primary sequence identity, mCLCA5 shares two other distinct properties of hCLCA2: the spacing of the symmetrical multicysteine motif, CX9CX4CX4-CX9C, as opposed to CX12CX4CX4CX12C in the rest of the family; and a frameshift mutation that results in an ∼40-amino-acid carboxyl-terminal extension (20Gruber A.D. Schreur K.D. Ji H.L. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1261-C1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Elble R.C. Widom J. Gruber A.D. Abdel-Ghany M. Levine R. Goodwin A. Cheng H.C. Pauli B.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27853-27861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition, the conservation of most of the putative N-linked glycosylation and protein kinase C phosphorylation sites suggests structural and functional conservation. To determine whether mCLCA5 is processed similarly to other family members, an HA epitope tag was appended to the carboxyl terminus. Immunoblotting of HEK293T cells transfected with this construct detected bands of ∼135 and ∼35 kDa, corresponding respectively to the precursor and the carboxyl-terminal processing product (Fig. 1C). Tissue Expression Pattern of mCLCA5—To determine whether mCLCA5 occurs in the same tissues as hCLCA2, its expression was assessed in a broad range of tissues by RT-PCR, first using a commercial cDNA array. Positive signals were then confirmed using manually isolated tissues. Although most adult tissues were negative, mCLCA5 was detected in many of the same locations as hCLCA2, including lung, kidney, uterus, and endothelial cells (20Gruber A.D. Schreur K.D. Ji H.L. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1261-C1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Agnel M. Vermat T. Culouscou J.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). However, mCLCA5 was also detected in heart and spleen and throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, mCLCA5 tissue distribution overlaps, but is broader than, that of hCLCA2. Most importantly for this study, hCLCA2 was reported in luminal epithelial cells of the mammary gland (19Gruber A.D. Pauli B.U. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5488-5491PubMed Google Scholar, 20Gruber A.D. Schreur K.D. Ji H.L. Fuller C.M. Pauli B.U. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1261-C1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). mCLCA5 was detected in mammary gland as well but only in fully differentiated lactating and involuting gland, correlating with slow or arrested growth and anoikis (Fig. 2B). Expression of mCLCA5 in Mammary Cell Lines—hCLCA2 is highly expressed in the spontaneously immortalized mammary epithelial cell line MCF10A but down-regulated in tumor cell lines (19Gruber A.D. Pauli B.U. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5488-5491PubMed Google Scholar). To find whether mCLCA5 behaved similarly, we determined relative mRNA levels by RT-PCR in a series of mouse cell lines ranging from normal mammary epithelial cells to metastatic tumor cells. (The alternative of measuring protein levels was not possible due to the inability to develop an anti-mCLCA5 antibody despite five attempts.) The immortalized cell line HC11 has been used extensively to model the growth and differentiation of mammary epithelial cells in vitro. Like other immortalized mammary epithelial cell lines, HC11 cells undergo apoptosis when deprived of growth factors and anchorage (33Hovey R.C. Goldhar A.S. Baffi J. Vonderhaar B.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 34Merlo G.R. Basolo F. Fiore L. Duboc L. Hynes N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 35Merlo G.R. Graus-Porta D. Cella N. Marte B.M. Taverna D. Hynes N.E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 70: 97-105PubMed Google Scholar, 36Merlo G.R. Cella N. Hynes N.E. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 251-260PubMed Google Scholar). Starvation-induced apoptosis is potentiated by high cell density, apparently due to loss of cell contact with the substratum (34Merlo G.R. Basolo F. Fiore L. Duboc L. Hynes N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 36Merlo G.R. Cella N. Hynes N.E. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 251-260PubMed Google Scholar). We found that expression of mCLCA5 in HC11 varied with cell density and growth rate. Expression was 10-fold higher in densely plated or confluent cells than in sparsely seeded cells (Fig. 3A). High expression in dense populations corresponded to slow or arrested growth. Although sparse cells doubled in only 13 h, densely plated cells doubled in 20 h, and 4-day confluent cells were non-dividing. Induction was apparently due to contact inhibition rather than accumulation of an inhibitor because conditioned medium from densely plated cells failed to induce mCLCA5 expression in sparsely plated populations (Fig. 3A, low-cm). As in mammary gland, mCLCA5 expression was post-proliferative and correlated with growth arrest and predisposition to apoptosis. Related sets of tumor cell lines with varying metastatic properties were selected for comparison. CSML-0 and CSML-100 are respectively non-metastatic and metastatic derivatives from the same tumor (37Ebralidze A.K. Tul'chinskii E.M. Grigorian M.S. Senin V.M. Lukanidin E.M. Genetika. 1989; 25: 932-936PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, 67NR, 4T07, and 4T1 are respectively non-metastatic, very poorly metastatic, and highly metastatic lines derived from a single tumor and have been employed extensively to model breast cancer metastasis (38Aslackson C.J. Miller F.R. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 1399-1405PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike hCLCA2, mCLCA5 was not down-regulated in non-metastatic tumor cell lines, especially CSML-0, but like hCLCA2, was nearly undetectable in the highly metastatic cell lines CSML-100 and 4T1 (Fig. 3B). In contrast to HC11 cells, plating 4T1 cells at high density had no effect on growth rate, as expected for a non-contact-inhibited cell line, and failed to induce mCLCA5 expression (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that mCLCA5 has a growth-limiting effect that metastatic cells escape by down-regulating the gene. Induction of mCLCA5 in Mammary Epithelial Cells by Starvation and Detachment—The induction of mCLCA5 by contact inhibition, which is mediated by the loss of focal adhesion signaling, suggests that mCLCA5 may be involved in cell cycle arrest in response to growth factor and anchorage deprivation, a process to which metastatic cells are often refractory (7Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2786) Google Scholar, 36Merlo G.R. Cella N. Hynes N.E. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 251-260PubMed Google Scholar, 39Kajstura J. Bereiter-Hahn J. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1989; 13: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Also consistent with this possibility is the observation that mCLCA5 is expressed during mammary involution, a time of massive cell death triggered by the withdrawal of growth factors and dissolution of extracellular matrix (36Merlo G.R. Cella N. Hynes N.E. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 251-260PubMed Google Scholar, 40Talhouk R.S. Bissell M.J. Werb Z. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1271-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, confluent HC11 cells were deprived of serum for various periods, and expression was analyzed. mCLCA5 was induced by serum deprivation after only 4 h and peaked at 30-fold induction by 8 h (Fig. 4, A and B). This inductio"
https://openalex.org/W2094677385,"Kinetic studies and analysis of the products formed by native and mutant forms of ovine prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase-1 (oPGHS-1) have suggested that arachidonic acid (AA) can exist in the cyclooxygenase active site of the enzyme in three different, catalytically competent conformations that lead to prostaglandin G2 (PGG2), 11R-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HPETE), and 15R,S-HPETE, respectively. We have identified an oPGHS-1 mutant (V349A/W387F) that forms predominantly 11R-HPETE. Thus, the preferred catalytically competent arrangement of AA in the cyclooxygenase site of this double mutant must be one that leads to 11-HPETE. The crystal structure of Co3+-protoporphyrin IX V349A/W387F oPGHS-1 in a complex with AA was determined to 3.1 Å. Significant differences are observed in the positions of atoms C-3, C-4, C-5, C-6, C-10, C-11, and C-12 of bound AA between native and V349A/W387F oPGHS-1; in comparison, the positions of the side chains of cyclooxygenase active site residues are unchanged. The structure of the double mutant presented here provides structural insight as to how Val349 and Trp387 help position C-9 and C-11 of AA so that the incipient 11-peroxyl radical intermediate is able to add to C-9 to form the 9,11 endoperoxide group of PGG2. In the V349A/W387F oPGHS-1·AA complex the locations of C-9 and C-11 of AA with respect to one another make it difficult to form the endoperoxide group from the 11-hydroperoxyl radical. Therefore, the reaction apparently aborts yielding 11R-HPETE instead of PGG2. In addition, the observed differences in the positions of carbon atoms of AA bound to this mutant provides indirect support for the concept that the conformer of AA shown previously to be bound within the cyclooxygenase active site of native oPGHS-1 is the one that leads to PGG2. Kinetic studies and analysis of the products formed by native and mutant forms of ovine prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase-1 (oPGHS-1) have suggested that arachidonic acid (AA) can exist in the cyclooxygenase active site of the enzyme in three different, catalytically competent conformations that lead to prostaglandin G2 (PGG2), 11R-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HPETE), and 15R,S-HPETE, respectively. We have identified an oPGHS-1 mutant (V349A/W387F) that forms predominantly 11R-HPETE. Thus, the preferred catalytically competent arrangement of AA in the cyclooxygenase site of this double mutant must be one that leads to 11-HPETE. The crystal structure of Co3+-protoporphyrin IX V349A/W387F oPGHS-1 in a complex with AA was determined to 3.1 Å. Significant differences are observed in the positions of atoms C-3, C-4, C-5, C-6, C-10, C-11, and C-12 of bound AA between native and V349A/W387F oPGHS-1; in comparison, the positions of the side chains of cyclooxygenase active site residues are unchanged. The structure of the double mutant presented here provides structural insight as to how Val349 and Trp387 help position C-9 and C-11 of AA so that the incipient 11-peroxyl radical intermediate is able to add to C-9 to form the 9,11 endoperoxide group of PGG2. In the V349A/W387F oPGHS-1·AA complex the locations of C-9 and C-11 of AA with respect to one another make it difficult to form the endoperoxide group from the 11-hydroperoxyl radical. Therefore, the reaction apparently aborts yielding 11R-HPETE instead of PGG2. In addition, the observed differences in the positions of carbon atoms of AA bound to this mutant provides indirect support for the concept that the conformer of AA shown previously to be bound within the cyclooxygenase active site of native oPGHS-1 is the one that leads to PGG2. Prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase (PGHS) 1The abbreviations used are: PGHS, prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase; PG, prostaglandin; oPGHS, ovine PGHS; AA, arachidonic acid; 11-HETE, 11-hydroxy-5c,8c,12t,14c-eicosatetraenoic acid; 15-HETE, 15-hydroxy-5c,8c,11c,13t-eicosatetraenoic acid; 11-HPETE, 11-hydroperoxy-5c,8c,12t,14c-eicosatetraeonic acid; 15-HPETE, 15-hydroperoxy-5c,8c,11c,13t eicosatetraenoic acid; COX, cyclooxygenase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; β-OG, n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. is a heme-containing, bi-functional enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid (AA) to prostaglandin (PG) H2 (Fig. 1), the immediate precursor to prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and prostacyclin. In mammalian tissues, there are two isoforms of PGHS designated PGHS-1 (or cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1)) and PGHS-2 (or COX-2) (1Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 149-182Crossref Scopus (2477) Google Scholar, 2Marnett L. DuBois R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 55-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). PGHS-1 is constitutively expressed and produces prostaglandins in response to hormone stimulation mainly for regulating housekeeping functions. PGHS-2, the inducible form, is expressed in response to mitogens, growth factors, tumor promoters, and/or cytokines and produces prostaglandins associated with pain, fever, and inflammation (1Smith W.L.

Toxicol. 2002; 42: 55-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Despite the differences in patterns of expression, PGHS-1 and PGHS-2 are quite similar both structurally (3Picot D. Loll P.J.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15451-15458Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Both isoforms function as dimers with each monomer having an epidermal growth factor domain, a membrane-binding domain, and a large catalytic domain. The catalytic domain of PGHS possesses two distinct but functionally connected active sites (3Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar, 4Luong C. Miler A. Barnett J. Chow J. Ramesha C. Browner M.F. Nat. Struct.

Biophys. 1988; 266: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These two sites include the COX site, which exists as a long hydrophobic channel within the core of the protein and binds AA (8Malkowski M.G. Ginell S. Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1933-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (3Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito M.

Nature. 1996; 384: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar), and a more solvent-exposed peroxidase site containing a heme moiety, which is involved in reducing PGG2 formed at the COX site to PGH2, the final enzymatic product. The crystal structure of native Co3+-protoporphyrin IX oPGHS-1 in a complex with AA shows that AA binds within the COX active site having the carboxylate group anchored at the mouth of the hydrophobic channel via electrostatic interactions with Arg120 and Tyr355 (8Malkowski M.G. Ginell S. Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1933-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). 2The numbering of residues in oPGHS-1 is based on numbering the N-terminal methionine of the signal peptide as residue number 1. The carbons of the AA chain weave into the COX active site, making forty-eight hydrophobic contacts with the residues lining this channel. Based on the crystal structure and knowledge of the stereochemical requirements of the COX reaction (9Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5336-5343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a structural sequence of catalytic events was proposed (8Malkowski M.G. Ginell S. Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1933-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The COX reaction begins with the abstraction of the 13proS hydrogen of AA by a tyrosyl radical formed at Tyr385, creating an arachidonyl radical centered at C-13 (6van der Donk W.A. Tsai A.-L. Kulmacz R.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15451-15458Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Following a rearrangement centering the radical on C-11, an attack of molecular oxygen occurs to form an 11R-hydroperoxyl radical (Fig. 1). At this point it is proposed that rotation about the C-10–C-11 bond moves the 11R-hydroperoxyl radical in close proximity to C-9 to form the 9,11-endoperoxide group; concurrently, rotation about the C-10–C-11 bond additionally brings C-8 near to C-12 to form the cyclopentane ring. Repositioning of C-12 closer to C-8 for ring formation also repositions atoms C-13 to C-20. The result is an optimal positioning of C-15 for a second attack by molecular oxygen. Additionally, with the 15-hydroperoxyl radical now positioned in proximity to Tyr385, Tyr385 is poised to donate a hydrogen to form the product of the COX site, PGG2, thus simultaneously reforming the Tyr385 radical and regenerating the enzyme for another round of catalysis. Both PGHS isoforms exhibit some lipoxygenase activity. Small amounts of 11-hydroperoxy-8Z,12E,14Z,-eicosatrienoic acid and 15-hydroperoxy-8Z,11Z,13E-eicosatrienoic are formed from dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (9Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 5336-5343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the corresponding 11- and 15-HPETEs are produced from AA (10Lecomte M. Laneuville O. Ji C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13207-13215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Thuresson E.D. Lakkides K.M. Smith W.L. J. Biol.

Thus, the native enzyme is not 100% efficient in converting AA to PGG2. Additionally, with native enzyme the Km values for AA in forming 11-HPETE, 15-HPETEs, and PGG2 are different for each product (11Thuresson E.D. Lakkides K.M. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8501-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This suggests that AA can exist in the COX site in at least three catalytically competent arrangements at the time of hydrogen abstraction to yield either PGG2, 11R-HETE, or 15R,S-HETE (11Thuresson E.D. Lakkides K.M. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8501-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Extensive kinetic and product analysis of numerous mutants of the COX active site have identified several residues that influence the relative proportions of PGG2 and monohydroperoxide products formed from AA (11Thuresson E.D.

Two single amino acid substitutions, V349A and W387F, were of particular interest to us because relatively more 11R-HPETE is formed (35–50% of total products) without substantially altering the kinetics of oxygenation (12Thuresson E.D. Lakkides K.M. Rieke C.J. Sun Y. Wingerd B.A. Micielli R. Mulichak A.M. Malkowski M.G. Garavito R.M. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10347-10357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Because each single mutation favors the formation of 11R-HPETE ∼50% of the time, we constructed and analyzed a V349A/W387F oPGHS-1 mutant. As described in this report, this double mutant produces predominantly 11R-HPETE. To investigate why this double mutant produces predominantly 11R-HPETE from AA, we determined the crystal structure of Co3+-protoporhyrin V349A/W387F oPGHS-1 with AA bound in the COX active site. Significant differences in the conformations of AA bound to native oPGHS-1 versus V349A/W387F oPGHS-1 mutant enzyme were observed. Our results provide insight into how Val349 and Trp387 influence the conformation of AA and how these residues are involved in directing the formation of the endoperoxide group. Materials—Arachidonic acid, 11R-HETE, and 15S-HETE were purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). [1-14C]Arachidonic acid (40–60 mCi/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Sf21 insect cells and 100× antibiotic-antimycotic were purchased from Invitrogen.

Flurbiprofen and hemin were purchased from Sigma, and Co3+-protoporphyrin IX was from Porphyrin Products (Provo, UT). Oligonucleotides used as primers for mutagenesis and for sequencing were prepared by the Michigan State University Macromolecular Structure and Sequencing Facility. Preparation of V349A/W387F oPGHS-1—Site-directed mutants were prepared with a pFastbac vector containing a cDNA encoding native oPGHS-1 with a hexahistidine tag (14Spencer A.G. Thuresson E.A.

Mutations were confirmed with sequence analysis performed by the DNA Sequencing Facility at Michigan State University. Generation of Recombinant Baculovirus and Expression of oPGHS-1 Mutants—DH10Bac cells were transformed with pFastbac containing cDNA for either V349A oPGHS-1 or V349A/W387F oPGHS-1 to obtain baculoviral DNA, which was then isolated and used to transfect sf21 insect cells to produce recombinant baculovirus. The recombinant baculovirus was amplified, and supernatants of amplifications were used as inoculum stocks. Sf21 insect cells grown in a 17-liter bioreactor to an approximate density of 1.7–2.0 × 106 cells/ml in medium with 1% antibiotic and antimycotic were infected with recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 at 27 °C. Three to four days after infection, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. Purification oPGHS-1 Mutants from Sf21 Insect Cells—Cell pellets from three bioreactors were resuspended in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 8.0, containing 20 mm imidazole and were lyzed by sonication. To solubilize PGHS from the membranes, Tween 20 was added to the lysate up to 1% (v/v) and was then incubated at 4 °C for 45 min with gentle agitation. Solubilized lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min, followed by ultracentrifugation at 45,000 rpm at 4 °C for 90 min. The supernatant was carefully removed and incubated for at least 3 h at 4 °C with Ni-NTA resin equilibrated in 1× PBS, pH 8.0, 20 mm imidazole, and 0.1% Tween 20. After this incubation period, the mixture of Ni-NTA resin plus supernatant was poured into a column that was washed with four column volumes each of 1× PBS, pH 8.0, 20 mm imidazole, 0.1% Tween 20 and 1× PBS, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 0.1% Tween 20. Hexahistidine-tagged PGHS was eluted with 1× PBS, pH 8.0, 200 mm imidazole, and 0.1% Tween 20. Fractions with the highest specific peroxidase activity (8Malkowski M.G. Ginell S. Smith W.L.

Science. 2000; 289: 1933-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) were pooled and concentrated using a Millipore Ultrafree-15 spin concentrator (30-kDa molecular mass cut-off) to a protein concentration of 8–10 mg/ml. Detergent exchange and desalting of the concentrated protein was performed by spinning protein over 5 ml of packed G-25 Sephadex (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaN3, and 0.5% β-OG. The protein concentrations were determined using BCA protein assays (Pierce). Analysis of Products Formed from Arachidonic Acid—Aliquots (equivalent to 150 COX units, where one unit is defined as 1 nmol of O2 consumed per min) of purified oPGHS-1 native and/or mutants were incubated for 1 min at 37 °C with 35 μm [1-14C]arachidonic acid with and without 200 μm flurbiprofen in a reaction volume of 200 μl. The radioactive products were extracted and separated by thin layer chromatography as previously described (12Thuresson E.D. Lakkides K.M. Rieke C.J. Sun Y. Wingerd B.A. Micielli R. Mulichak A.M.

The products were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Negative controls from samples containing flurbiprofen were subtracted from values measured from the corresponding samples not containing flurbiprofen. Characterization of V349A/W387F oPGHS-1—Kinetic parameters for V349A/W387F oPGHS-1 were measured with a cyclooxygenase assay by monitoring the initial rate of O2 uptake at 37 °C using an oxygen electrode (12Thuresson E.D.

A typical assay consisted of 3 ml of 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm phenol, 1 mm hemin, and 2–100 μm AA. The reactions were initiated by adding a volume of enzyme equivalent to 150 units of Ni-NTA-purified V349A/W387F oPGHS-1. Crystallization and Data Collection—Purified apo-V349A/W387F oPGHS-1 at ∼8 mg/ml (0.11 mm) was reconstituted with a 2-fold molar excess of Co3+-protoporphyrin IX. Prior to setting up sitting drop crystallization experiments, the protein was incubated in the presence of AA at a 5-fold molar excess over the protein concentration. The protein was mixed 1:1 with buffer containing 0.68 m sodium citrate, 0.6–0.9 m LiCl, 1 mm NaN3, and 0.3% β-OG and equilibrated within a reservoir containing 0.68–0.9 m sodium citrate, 0.60–0.90 m LiCl, and 1 mm NaN3. Crystals appeared after 4 weeks to several months. Crystals were harvested with a nylon loop and transferred briefly into a cryo solution containing 0.9 m sodium citrate, 1.0 m LiCl, 0.15% β-OG, 1 mm NaN3, and 24% (w/v) sucrose. The crystals were immediately flash frozen in liquid propane at -165 °C. The data were collected at beamline 19ID of the Structural Biology Center (Advance Photon Source, Argonne IL). The data from a single crystal were indexed and integrated using HKL2000 (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Thus, the structure of V349A/W387F oPGHS-1 was determined by using the protein atoms of native oPGHS-1:AA (Protein Data Bank code 1DIY) as a phasing model for simple rigid body refinement utilizing CNS version 1.1 (16Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar), to correct for small changes in lattice parameters. After an initial round of simulated annealing and positional and group B-factor refinement, the resulting R and Rfree factors were 25.4 and 31.2%. Inspection of the initial 2Fo - Fc (contoured at 1 σ) and Fo - Fc (contoured at 2.5σ) electron density maps using the program CHAIN (17Sack J.S. J. Mol. Graphics. 1988; 6: 224-225Crossref Google Scholar) allowed the placement of Co3+-protoporphyrin IX, seven carbohydrate residues, and three β-OG detergent molecules. Strong electron density was observed for AA starting from the carboxylate group up to carbon C-4. With subsequent rounds of refinement, the improved phases led to the appearance of further electron density, which allowed the additional placement of atoms C-5–C-12 of AA. No further electron density was observed for AA. Although no density was observed for C-13, the position of C-13 was modeled based on the limited orientations it can adopt because of the stereochemical restrictions of the C-11–C-12 double bond and was included in the refinement; thus C-1 (including the carboxylate) to C-13 of AA was included in the refinement of the model. Further refinement included the addition of 22 water molecules at positions that were within 2.4–3.6 Å of a hydrogen bond donor/acceptor and an electron density peak of 3 σ or greater. The R and Rfree values of the final model are at 23.2 and 30.8% (Table I). Evaluation with PROCHECK (18Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) showed that all non-Pro and non-Gly residues lay within the most favored or allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. Because medium resolution diffraction data were used in this analysis, the following two tests were performed to verify that changes observed in the AA conformation between the structures of native and V349A/W387F oPGHS-1 were significant. In the first test, Fo - Fc difference electron density maps were calculated using the observed structure factors and modified phase sets. Because the crystals of native and mutant oPGHS-1 were isomorphous, a calculated phase set was created by combining the Co3+-heme V349A/W387F oPGHS-1, excluding the observed AA atoms, with atoms from the AA conformer observed in the refined model of native Co3+-heme oPGHS-1:AA complex (Protein Data Bank code IDIY). A similar method has been utilized previously to verify observed differences between AA and several other fatty acid substrates bound within the COX site (19Thuresson E.D. Malkowski M.G.

In areas where the carbon positions differ between the two observed conformations of AA, we would expect to observe the appropriate positive and negative difference density peaks, indicating a shift in atom positions. The second test addressed the possibility that other conformations of AA could exist and be represented by the density, given the broad extent of the electron density observed at this resolution. A parallel series of simulated annealing refinements were performed, using the observed structure factors and the V349A/W387F oPGHS-1 coordinates. Each series of simulated annealing refinements were done four times to generate a family of structures from each starting point. The starting conformation of bound AA differed, however, between the two parallel series of refinement. In the first series, the AA conformer found in native oPGHS-1 (8Malkowski M.G. Ginell S.

Science. 2000; 289: 1933-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), was used, whereas in the second series, the AA conformer derived from the refined V349A/W387F oPGHS-1 structure was used. If the contributions from the x-ray data for the mutant were significant, it was expected that the AA conformer seen in the mutant would be recovered in the first case and retained in the second. If not, both series of refinements would yield a wide range of unrelated AA conformers. As expected, the simulated annealing refinement starting from the AA conformer derived from the refined V349A/W387F oPGHS-1 structure generated a family of AA conformations that were very similar to the starting conformer. In contrast, all four AA conformers generated by using the native AA conformer as the starting point for refinement looked remarkably similar to the AA conformation found in the V349A/W387F mutant. Of these four conformers, one fit the observed electron density quite well and was used for further structure refinement. Statistics of the refinement of the final model using the conformer from simulated annealing are shown in Table I. Comparison of Products Formed from Arachidonic Acid by Native and Mutant oPGHS-1—There are considerable differences in the proportions of oxygenated products formed from [1-14C]arachidonic acid by native oPGHS-1, V349A oPGHS-1, and V349A/W387F oPGHS-1 (Fig. 2). Native enzyme produces predominantly products derived from PGG2 (∼95% including 12-hydroxy-5c,8c,10t-heptadecatrienoic acid and various prostaglandins) and small amounts of 11-HETE (∼2.5%) derived from 11-HPETE and 15-HETE (∼2.5%) from 15-HPETE. In comparison, the V349/W387F double mutant produces predominantly 11-HETE (>84%) and correspondingly less PGG2 derived products (∼12%) than native enzyme. V349A oPGHS-1 forms about 50% 11-HETE (12Thuresson E.D. Lakkides K.M. Rieke C.J. Sun Y. Wingerd B.A. Micielli R. Mulichak A.M. Malkowski M.G. Garavito R.M. Smith W.L. J. Biol.

Kinetic Analysis of V349A/W387F oPGHS-1—To determine whether AA is utilized with similar efficiencies by native and V349A/W387F oPGHS-1, the Km value for the oxygenation of AA was determined using a cyclooxygenase assay. The Km for AA of V349A/W387F oPGHS-1 was determined to be 5 μm, a value very similar to that previously reported for native enzyme under similar assay conditions (11Thuresson E.D. Lakkides K.M.

Arachidonic Acid Bound in the COX Site of Co3+-heme V349A/W387F oPGHS-1—The electron density of the Co3+-heme V349A/W387F oPGHS-1·AA complex was of good quality for building in considerable amounts of nonprotein substructure (i.e. the Co3+-protoporphyrin IX; the carbohydrate groups linked to residues Asn68, Asn144, and Asn410; and three β-OG detergent molecules bound within the membrane binding domain). The overall structure, which includes the epidermal growth factor and the membrane-binding and the catalytic domains of the Co3+-heme V349A/W387F oPGHS-1:AA complex, is virtually identical to that of Co3+-heme oPGHS-1:AA complex having a root mean square deviation of 0.3 Å over all Cα atoms. This indicates that the overall structure is relatively unchanged by the two mutations (V349A and W387F) in the COX active site. The Fo - Fc electron density map allowed the placement of carbons C-1–C-12 into the electron density with some degree of confidence (Fig. 3), although no electron density was observed for carbons C-13–C-20.

VP1 Pockets 1, 2, and 3 bind terminal SA, Gal, and second branched SA, respectively. The consequence of recognition on viral cell entry remains elusive. In this work, we show that preincubation of Py with soluble compounds within Pocket 1 (N-acetyl or N-glycolyl neuraminic acids) increases Py cell binding and infectivity in murine 3T6 fibroblasts. In contrast, Gal does not significantly alter Py binding nor infectivity, whereas sialyllactose, in Pockets 1 and 2, decreases cell binding and infectivity. Binding experiments with Py virus-like particles confirmed the direct involvement of VP1 in this effect. To determine whether such results could reflect VP1 conformational changes induced by SA binding, protease digestion assays were performed after pretreatment of Py or virus-like particles with soluble receptor fragments. Binding of SA with the VP1 Pocket 1, but not of compounds interacting with Pocket 2, was associated with a transition of this protein from a protease-sensitive to a protease-resistant state. This effect was transmitted to the minor capsid proteins VP2 and VP3 in virus particles. Attachment of Py to cell monolayers similarly led to a VP1 trypsin-resistant pattern. Taken together, these data present evidence that initial binding of Py to terminal SA induces conformational changes in the viral capsid, which may influence subsequent virus cell entry steps.

Taken together, these data present evidence that initial binding of Py to terminal SA induces conformational changes in the viral capsid, which may influence subsequent virus cell entry steps. The first phase of viral infection is determined by the interaction of virus particles with specific receptors on host cell membranes followed by subsequent cell penetration. In the case of enveloped viruses such as retroviruses, paramyxoviruses, or coronaviruses, recognition and binding to cell receptors trigger a conformational change in the virus attachment protein, which in turn leads to the activation of the fusogenic properties of an associated viral capsid protein. This event results in the fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane (1Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. Farber J.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar, 2Lu C-W. Roth M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 10841-10849Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 3Takimoto T. Taylor G.L.

Virol. 2002; 76: 11819-11826Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Cell entry of nonenveloped viruses is less well understood, but it has emerged from recent studies that this process can be induced by similar molecular mechanisms. For example, binding of poliovirus to its cell receptor promotes conformational changes of the major capsid protein, VP1, which are transmitted to the other capsid proteins. This results in the exposure at the viral capsid surface of hydrophobic sequences that may participate in membrane penetration (5Fricks C.E. Hogles J.M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1934-1945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of reoviruses or papillomaviruses with their receptors has also been reported to promote conformational changes in the viral capsid, which are detected by changes in the sensitivity to proteases or in the antigenic properties of the viral protein (6Fernandes J.

Polyomavirus (Py) 1The abbreviations used are: Py, polyomavirus; SA, sialic acid; VLP, virus-like particles; NANA, N-acetyl neuraminic acid; NGNA, N-glycolyl neuraminic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; SL, sialyllactose; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; Ab, antibody; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. is a nonenveloped murine tumor virus with a T=7 icosahedral lattice capsid composed of 72 pentamers of the major capsid protein VP1 consisting of both pentavalent and hexavalent structures (8Stehle T. Yan Y. Benjamin T.L. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1994; 369: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The minor capsid proteins, VP2 or VP3, are positioned in the center of each pentamer, likely anchored to VP1 through their C terminus by hydrophobic interactions (9Barouch D.H. Harrison S.C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3982-3989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Chen X.S. Stehle T. Harrison S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3233-3240Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The Py cell attachment receptor contains N-acetyl neuraminic acid (a sialic acid (SA) residue) present on glycoproteins and glycolipids (11Cahan L.D. Singh R. Paulson J.C.

Crystallography analysis of the virus complexed with an oligosaccharide receptor fragment has revealed the presence of four pockets on the VP1 surface. Pockets 1 and 2 accommodate the terminal SA and galactose moieties, respectively, whereas Pocket 3 can accommodate the (α-2,6)-linked SA of a branched chain receptor (8Stehle T. Yan Y. Benjamin T.L. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1994; 369: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). So far, no specific binding function has been attributed to Pocket 4, which may interact with other as yet undefined sugar moieties (8Stehle T. Yan Y. Benjamin T.L. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1994; 369: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). High resolution structure of a recombinant VP1 pentamer complexed with a receptor fragment has identified VP1 residues Tyr-72, Arg-77, Gly-78, His-298, and Asn-93 as essential components of Pockets 1 and 2 (16Stehle T. Harrison S.C. Structure. 1996; 4: 183-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 17Stehle T. Harrison S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5139-5148Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Single mutations in these residues result in the complete loss of infectivity (18Bauer P.H. Cui C. Stehle T. Harrison S.C. DeCaprio J.A. Benjamin T.L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5826-5832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated, at least for Arg-77 and His-298 mutants, that this effect is due to impaired cell entry caused by abrogation of SA-dependent cell binding (14Caruso M. Cavaldesi M. Gentile M. Sthandier O. Amati P. Garcia M.I. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 2927-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The interaction of VP1 with terminal SA residues is the critical initial step of a complex multistage Py cell entry mechanism. We have recently demonstrated that the α4β1 integrin is a cell receptor for Py post-attachment (13Caruso M. Belloni L. Sthandier O. Amati P. Garcia M.I. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3913-3921Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Such an interaction, likely determined by the specific recognition of an LDV motif present on the VP1 DE loop by the α4β1 integrin-ligand binding site, only occurs subsequent to the initial VP1-SA interaction (13Caruso M. Belloni L. Sthandier O. Amati P. Garcia M.I. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3913-3921Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 14Caruso M. Cavaldesi M. Gentile M. Sthandier O. Amati P. Garcia M.I. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 2927-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that Py cell binding can be restored in neuraminidase-treated fibroblast cells if the virus is first preincubated with soluble SA (13Caruso M. Belloni L. Sthandier O. Amati P. Garcia M.I. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3913-3921Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data led us to hypothesize that the initial interaction of Py with SA moieties may induce an alteration of the capsid conformation, which is necessary for the recognition of post-binding cell receptors and subsequent cell penetration. In this work, we have analyzed the effect of soluble receptor compounds on Py cell binding and infectivity. Potential conformational changes of the viral capsid induced by receptor binding have been investigated by testing the sensitivity of capsid proteins to protease digestion. Cells, Viruses, and Virus-like Particles (VLPs)—Mouse 3T6 fibroblast cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Insect Sf9 cells were grown as monolayers in Grace's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% decomplemented fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) at 27 °C. Py strain A2 was propagated at a low multiplicity of infection in 3T6 fibroblasts, and virus particles were purified by CsCl gradients, as described previously (13Caruso M. Belloni L. Sthandier O. Amati P. Garcia M.I. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3913-3921Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19Garcia M.I. Perez M. Caruso M. Sthandier O. Ferreira R. Cermola M. Macchia C. Amati P. Virology. 2000; 272: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Production and CsCl gradient purification of VLPs were performed as described (14Caruso M. Cavaldesi M. Gentile M. Sthandier O. Amati P. Garcia M.I. J. Gen. Virol. 2003; 84: 2927-2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Reagents and Antibodies—N-acetyl neuraminic acid (NANA), N-glycolyl neuraminic acid (NGNA), and Gal, from Sigma, were dissolved in PBS (supplemented with 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.05 mm MgCl2) to give a 320 mm (10%) stock solution. N-acetylneuraminyllactose (sialyllactose (SL)) was purchased from Sigma and dissolved in the same buffer to obtain a stock solution at 160 mm (5%). Aliquots of each stock solution were conserved at –20 °C. Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) was purchased from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal anti-VP1 DE loop (designated 488) and mouse monoclonal anti-VP1 or -VP2/3 antibodies (Abs) were kindly provided by R. Garcea and J. Forstovà (20Forstovà J. Krauzewicz N. Wallace S. Street A.J. Dilworth S.M. Beard S Griffin B.E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Polyclonal large T antiserum was obtained from Brown Norway rats inoculated with syngeneic Py-transformed cells. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antirabbit and anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) Abs were purchased from Bio-Rad, and R-phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin was purchased from BD PharMingen. Rat fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated IgG fraction Ab was obtained from Cappel. FACS Analysis—Cell monolayers were detached by incubation in PBS, 5 mm EDTA and washed in buffer A (PBS supplemented with 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.05 mm MgCl2, and 1% bovine serum albumin). Biotinylation of purified Py, Py VLPs, or WGA lectin was described previously (13Caruso M. Belloni L. Sthandier O. Amati P. Garcia M.I. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3913-3921Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Biotinylated Py (0.8 μg), Py VLPs (0.5 μg), or WGA (75 ng) were pretreated for 1 h on ice with the sugar compound or buffer A (adjusted to pH 2.3 or 7.5) before being incubated with 4 × 105 cells for a subsequent hour on ice. Cells were washed and incubated with R-phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin in buffer A for 30 min on ice. After being washed twice, cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde, and their fluorescence intensity was analyzed by FACS using the CellQuest software. Virus Infectivity Assays—2 × 105 3T6 cells, seeded for 3–4 h, were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium just before infection. CsCl-purified viruses (1 μg corresponding to 1 × 107 plaque-forming unit) were preincubated with sugar compounds or buffer alone (PBS adjusted to pH 2.3 or 7.5) for 1 h on ice. Afterward, the virus volume was adjusted to 300 μl with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and the mixture was used to infect cells for 1.5 h at 37 °C. In some experiments, cells were pretreated with 50 milliunits of Neuraminidase (Sigma) for 1 h at 37 °C before viral infection. Unbound virus was removed, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, was added to the cells and left for 20 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed, fixed, and immunostained for virus (large T expression) and total nuclei (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) as described previously (13Caruso M. Belloni L. Sthandier O. Amati P. Garcia M.I. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3913-3921Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Infectivity was measured as the number of large T-positive cells among total nuclei. A minimum of 1,000 nuclei was counted for each single plate, and each single experiment was performed in duplicate. 100% virus infectivity corresponded to an average of 10–20% large T-positive cells. Protease Digestion Assays—Py or VLPs (1 μg) was incubated with the sugar compound or buffer alone (PBS adjusted to pH 2.3 or 7.5) for 1 h on ice. Dissociated VLPs were obtained by adding 3.3 mm dithiothreitol and 10 mm EDTA (final concentrations) to VLPs for 1 h. Samples were then mixed with 100 μg of trypsin (Invitrogen) or 25 μg of proteinase K (Sigma) and placed at room temperature. Aliquots from the digestion reactions were collected at various time points and lysed with Laemmli buffer. For assays performed on cell-bound viruses, 2 × 105 cells (monolayers) were precooled for 15 min at +4 °C, washed with ice-cold buffer, and then incubated with Py (2 μg) for a further hour on ice. Unbound viruses were removed, and trypsin (750 μg) was added to the monolayers at room temperature for 30 s, 2 min, or 20 min. Cells were washed three times with PBS containing protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and lysed with Laemmli buffer. After sample boiling, proteins were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), stained with GelCode blue staining reagent (Pierce) or, alternatively, transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell). Western blot analysis was carried out by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Abs after blocking nonspecific reactivity with 4% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20. Bands were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (Pierce). Effect of Different Sugar Compounds on Py and VLPs Cell Binding—Exposure of murine Py particles to soluble NANA effectively restores virus binding to cells pretreated with neuraminidase (13Caruso M. Belloni L. Sthandier O. Amati P. Garcia M.I. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3913-3921Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To get better insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect, we studied the effect of NANA on the ability of Py to bind to the permissive mouse 3T6 cell line. For this purpose, biotin-labeled purified Py was mixed for 1 h on ice with NANA at different concentrations (0, 32, 64, or 120 mm final concentration) and incubated with 3T6 cells for a further hour on ice. Cell-bound Py was detected by FACS using fluorochromelabeled streptavidin. As shown in Fig. 1, preincubation of Py with NANA, but not with acidic buffer alone, increased cell binding in a dose-dependent manner. We further examined the effect of other sugar compounds on Py cell binding. Pretreatment of Py with NGNA, a larger compound than NANA, led to an increase of cell binding similar to that observed with NANA. The Gal compound, predicted to be accommodated within VP1 Pocket 2, did not modify Py cell binding. In contrast, preincubation of Py with SL (formed by NANA-α(2,3)-Gal-β(1,3)-GlcNAc), predicted to lie within Pockets 1 and 2 (16Stehle T. Harrison S.C. Structure. 1996; 4: 183-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 17Stehle T. Harrison S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5139-5148Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in cell binding (Fig. 1). Additionally, simultaneous pretreatment of Py with NANA and Gal resulted in increased cell binding, comparable with that seen with NANA alone (data not shown). The same experiments performed with Py VLPs, constituted by auto-assembled VP1 protein, showed effects similar to those observed with the viral particles (Fig. 1), indicating that the effects of sugars on cell binding were attributable solely to interactions involving the major capsid protein VP1. We ruled out that the increased cell binding observed with NANA-/NGNA-pretreated Py or VLPs could not be attributed to nonspecific binding of dissociated particles. Indeed, we ensured that integrity of Py or VLPs was perfectly maintained under acidic buffer conditions, by sedimentation of treated particles on CsCl gradients and direct electron microscopy observation (data not shown). In addition, we checked that the genomes packed into the viral particles were fully resistant to DNase I digestion (data not shown). The influence of these different compounds on the cell binding ability of the WGA lectin, which has been proposed to interact with N-linked α(2,3)-SA in a way similar to Py VP1 (17Stehle T. Harrison S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5139-5148Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 21Wright C.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 635-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), was also studied. We found that Gal did not influence WGA cell binding, similarly to Py VP1. In contrast, WGA binding was reduced in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of the other compounds used (Fig. 1). Taken together, these data indicate that the interaction of Py and VLPs, but not of WGA, with compounds accommodated within the VP1 binding Pocket 1, determines an increased cell binding ability. Effect of Different Sugar Compounds on Py Infectivity—This topic was analyzed using the same 3T6 cell line after first determining that preincubation of Py with acidic or neutral buffer does not affect infectivity (data not shown). Our data showed that SL reduced viral infectivity in a dose-dependent manner (36.5% ± 8.5% infectivity at 120 mm), whereas incubation with Gal only slightly reduced Py infectivity (81% ± 5.5% at 120 mm) (Fig. 2A). In contrast, infectivity was increased if Py was preincubated with NANA (139% ± 1% at 120 mm) or NGNA (data not shown). Taken together with cell binding assays, these data suggested a differential effect between VP1 Pockets 1 and 2 on Py infectivity. Next, we asked whether the binding of Py to neuraminidase-treated cells, restored after exposure to NANA, results in a productive infection. Py, preincubated with or without 120 mm NANA, was used to infect cells that had been treated or not with the SA-removing enzyme. As shown in Fig. 2B, treatment of cells with neuraminidase reduced Py infectivity (to 38% ± 2%), but pretreatment of Py particles with NANA significantly restored infectivity (to 76% ± 8%). Thus, NANA binding to Py allows the recognition of SA-independent cell receptors for cell attachment and productive infection. Preincubation of VLPs with NANA Partially Protects VP1 from Protease Digestion—To detect potential conformational changes of the Py VP1 protein due to soluble SA binding to Pocket 1, digestion protection assays were performed using trypsin protease. VLPs were preincubated with PBS buffer alone or 64 mm NANA, and trypsin was then added for various time periods. The resulting protease-resistant VP1 products were analyzed both by SDS-PAGE and by staining with the GelCode blue reagent (Fig. 3A) and by Western blot (Fig. 3B). A clearly different digestion profile was observed in samples treated or not with NANA. In NANA-VLPs samples, a large part of VP1 remained undigested, whereas digestion of PBSVLPs, for as little as 2 min, resulted in complete disappearance of the intact VP1 and simultaneous appearance of smaller polypeptides with 37, 39, and 40 kDa. In NANA-VLPs samples, the fraction of VP1 that was digested generated bands of 28–30 and 25–26 kDa, which were not detected in PBS-VLPs samples. Longer digestion times (up to 300 min) did not significantly change the two digestion profiles (data not shown). As a control, dissociated VLPs (treated with dithiothreitol and EDTA prior to protease digestion) appeared more digested than PBSVLPs. Further experiments ruled out that low pH could have modified the cleavage specificity of the protease. That is, the trypsin digestion profile was shown to be identical whether VLPs had been pretreated with buffer adjusted to pH 2.3 or 7.5, and purified H1 histone, as alternative substrate, was similarly digested by trypsin if pretreated with PBS or 64 mm NANA (data not shown). Our data demonstrated that NANA binding to the VLPs converted VP1 from a trypsin-susceptible to a trypsin-resistant state. To determine whether such conformational changes were also detected with other proteinases, similar experiments were performed using proteinase K, which has broader cleavage specificity than trypsin. Protease-resistant VP1 fragments were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with the GelCode blue reagent. As observed in Fig. 3C, NANA-treated VLPs were protected relative to untreated VLPs, whereas dissociated VLPs appeared almost completely digested even after 2 min. Taken together with the trypsin digestion assays, these data indicated that the interaction of NANA with VP1 changes the accessibility of the VP1 cleavage sites to proteases, and therefore, suggested that binding of the soluble receptor to the VP1 Pocket 1 may alter the conformation of the VLPs. Since the digestion profiles obtained by proteinase K treatment were more complex to analyze, further studies were performed with the trypsin protease. Effect of Sugar Compounds on the Sensitivity of VLPs to Trypsin Digestion—Sugar compounds (NANA, NGNA, Gal, SL, or NANA + Gal) were assessed with regard to susceptibility of VLPs to trypsin digestion. VLPs were incubated with the sugar compounds at two different concentrations, and then trypsin digestion was carried out. The resulting protease-resistant VP1 fragments were analyzed by Western blots (Fig. 4). It was found that the protection effect of NANA on VLPs was dose-dependent; that is, a higher proportion of VP1 was trypsin-resistant at 120 mm than at 64 mm (Fig. 4A). Incubation of VLPs with NGNA resulted in a digestion pattern similar to that observed with NANA (Fig. 4A). In contrast, preincubation of VLPs with either SL or Gal (at any concentration) gave trypsin digestion patterns comparable with those of PBS-VLPs (Fig. 4B). Finally, simultaneous incubation of VLPs with NANA and Gal conferred a digestion profile similar to that observed for NANA-VLPs (Fig. 4C). These data are consistent with the notion that a conformational change of VP1 is induced by the compounds that exclusively bind to Pocket 1. Effect of NANA-induced Conformational Changes of VP1 on the Minor Capsid Proteins—We investigated whether the conformational change observed on VLPs upon SA binding also occurs in the viral capsid context, which includes the two minor capsid proteins VP2 and VP3 and the packed minichromosome. To this end, Py was incubated with SA-containing compounds (NANA or SL) at different concentrations or with PBS buffer alone before trypsin digestion. As shown in Fig. 5A, the incubation of viruses with NANA, but not with PBS or SL, was associated with VP1 resistance to trypsin digestion in a dose-dependent manner, similar to VLPs. The same samples were analyzed by Western blot using monoclonal Abs that recognize both the VP2 and the VP3 proteins. In PBS-Py samples, as early as 2 min after digestion, both minor capsid proteins had been totally digested. A similar result was observed in SL-Py samples at any concentration. In contrast, in NANA-Py samples, a different digestion profile could be observed depending on the concentration. In fact, at 32 mm, some VP2/3 products were still detected and, at 64 and 120 mm, minor proteins were almost fully protected from trypsin digestion. These data show that the change of VP1 conformation induced by NANA binding also occurs in the virus and modifies the accessibility of minor coat proteins to proteases. Effect of Py Binding to Host Cells on VP1 Sensitivity to Trypsin—To determine whether the VP1 resistance to trypsin observed after incubation of Py or VLPs with soluble NANA also occurs at the host cell surface, Py was allowed to bind to 3T6 fibroblast monolayers, and trypsin was added to cells for the times indicated in Fig. 5B. The amount of trypsin used for this experiment was increased by 7.5-fold with respect to that used for the soluble virus and was determined not to be a limiting factor in the digestion assay (data not shown). As detected by Western blots, the VP1 of cell-bound viruses was totally trypsin-resistant, whereas that from unbound viruses appeared sensitive to trypsin (Fig. 5B). The possibility that the apparent resistance of cell-associated VP1 to trypsin resulted from viral cell entry was ruled out by measuring the virus internalization in these experimental conditions. Biotin-labeled purified Py (0.8 μg) was added to 2.105 3T6 cells for 1 h on ice. Unbound particles were washed away, and cells were incubated at room temperature for the indicated times. Then, cell-bound Py was detected by FACS analysis as described (see “Experimental Procedures”). The percentage of internalization (% Py Int.) was calculated as the difference of fluorescence intensity of cells before and after the temperature switch. 0% Py Int. corresponds to the fluorescence observed after 1 h of Py binding at +4 °C. As indicated in Fig. 5B, only 8% of total cell-bound Py had become internalized within 30 s, and the percentage of Py internalization only reached 23% after 20 min. Therefore, as seen with the soluble receptor, the binding of Py to the cell membrane triggers conformational changes in the major capsid protein VP1. The present work provides for the first time biological and biochemical evidence that the initial binding of Py to terminal SA alters the conformation in both major and minor capsid Py proteins, which may be necessary for subsequent virus entry into cells. The use of soluble receptor compounds is an approach that has previously been adopted to analyze the receptor specificity of Adenovirus 37 on Chang cells. In this case, NANA, NGNA, and SL used at concentrations of 160 mm were all shown to block 80–90% of Ad37 cell attachment (22Arnberg N. Pring-Akerblom P. Wadell G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8834-8841Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In our experiments, a similar blocking effect was observed on WGA cell binding. In contrast, we observed a dose-dependent increase of Py cell binding in the presence of compounds only accommodated within Pocket 1 of VP1. Such a result was not specific of the cell line since it was detected in other murine permissive cell lines (data not shown). The effect of NANA on Py cell binding was not due to non-specific pH effect since control experiments, performed at acidic pH, did not alter the host cell membrane nor influence Py cell attachment. Since increased cell attachment upon SA binding was also detected with both Py virions and VLPs, the observed effect must be dependent on the major capsid protein VP1. For Py viral particles, increased cell binding resulted in increased infectivity. A similar phenomenon has been reported for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or coronaviruses, whose incubation with their soluble cell receptors activate viral infectivity due to a conformational change of the envelope protein (1Berger E.A. Murphy P.M. Farber J.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar, 4Matsuyama S. Taguchi F. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 11819-11826Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For Py, soluble NANA binding to VP1 was accompanied by a change in VP1 sensitivity to proteases, the data indicating that the interaction of terminal SA with VP1 Pocket 1 triggers a conformational change in the protein that results in favored cell entry of particles and infection. The NGNA is an SA variant that is expressed on the surface of murine cells in various tissues (16Stehle T. Harrison S.C. Structure. 1996; 4: 183-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Structural analysis suggested that its additional hydroxyl group (with regard to NANA) could possibly hydrogen-bond with the side chains of Tyr-72 and Asp-85 of the clockwise VP1 neighbor in the viral pentamer. In accordance with this hypothesis, we found that NGNA has effects on Py cell binding, infectivity, and protease digestion that are similar to NANA. The data raise the interesting question whether NGNA may also be a functional cell receptor for Py on murine cells. Intriguing data were obtained with regard to the VP1 interaction with Gal. Naturally occurring terminal SA are linked to Gal moieties (23Kelm S. Schauer R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1997; 175: 137-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and crystallographic evidence has indicated that Gal is accommodated within VP1 Pocket 2 through hydrogen bonding with Asn-93. Hydrogen bonding of Gly-78 with Gal and terminal SA contributes (together with Arg-77) to form a ridge with both sugar moieties separated onto either side of the ridge (17Stehle T. Harrison S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5139-5148Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Mutation of any of these sites in VP1 leads to nonviability of the Py strains (18Bauer P.H. Cui C. Stehle T. Harrison S.C. DeCaprio J.A. Benjamin T.L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5826-5832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our experiments, Gal did not modify Py cell binding, nor did it significantly affect viral infectivity, and no particular conformational change of VP1 was detected in the protease digestion assays. Further, 3′-sialyllactose had a blocking effect on Py cell binding and infectivity, similar to that seen for the WGA lectin, and no associated conformational change of VP1, in line with previous crystallographic studies performed with this particular compound (17Stehle T. Harrison S.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5139-5148Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In contrast, simultaneous binding of unlinked NANA and Gal moieties resulted in VP1 conformational changes. Taken together, these data suggest a critical role of the SA-Gal linkage conformation as a determinant for productive interaction between Py and its receptor. The conformation of the SA-Gal linkage, determined by the presence of internal hydrogen bonds in each SA and Gal and between both moieties, may depend on the nature of the oligosaccharide receptor. In vivo, it is conceivable that Py infection will be productive if the interaction of VP1 only occurs with sialylated receptors carrying a SA-Gal linkage conformation that is compatible with conformational changes that occur in the capsid protein. Incompatibility may lead to “pseudoreceptors,” a hypothesis already proposed for VP1 binding to second branched SA through Pocket 3 (18Bauer P.H. Cui C. Stehle T. Harrison S.C. DeCaprio J.A. Benjamin T.L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5826-5832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In support of this model is the observation that, among large plaque strains, mutation of the Val-296 to Ala (PTA and LID strains, respectively) confers weaker binding to Pocket 1 due to abrogation of a hydrophobic interaction with terminal SA and results in a higher virulent phenotype (18Bauer P.H. Cui C. Stehle T. Harrison S.C. DeCaprio J.A. Benjamin T.L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5826-5832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exploration of the conformational changes induced by SA binding in the VP1 proteins of PTA and LID strains may help define this possibility. Conformational change of viral attachment proteins upon receptor binding is associated with structural alterations of the other capsid proteins for several viruses (2Lu C-W. Roth M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 10841-10849Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 24Belnap D.M. Filman D.J. Trus B.L. Cheng N. Booy F.P. Conway J.F. Curry S. Hiremath C.N. Tsang S.K. Steven A.C. Hogle J.M. J.

For Py, we found that NANA binding to VP1, but not SL, promotes a transition of VP2 and VP3 from a protease-sensitive to a protease-resistant state, indicating that the interaction of VP1 with SA also confers changes to the conformation of VP2 and VP3. Consistent with our data, several reports support a role for the minor capsid proteins during the early stages of Py infection (26Mannovà P. Liebl D. Krauzewicz N. Fejtovà A. Tokrovà J. Palkovà Z. Griffin B.E. Forstovà J. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 2309-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Sahli R. Freund R. Dubensky R. Garcea R. Bronson R. Benjamin T.L. Virology. 1993; 192: 142-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the case of VP2, this function seems to depend primarily on the amino acid composition rather than the presence of the myristyl moiety at the N terminus (26Mannovà P. Liebl D. Krauzewicz N. Fejtovà A. Tokrovà J. Palkovà Z. Griffin B.E. Forstovà J. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 2309-2319Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), although this modification has been demonstrated to play a central role in cell penetration for other viruses (28Moscufo N. Gomez Yafal A. Rogowe A. Hogle J. Chow M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5075-5078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Gripon P. Le Seyec J. Rumin S. Guguen-Guillouzo C. Virology. 1995; 213: 292-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Determination of the crystal structure of the C-terminal segment of VP2/3 complexed with a VP1 pentamer at 2.2-Å resolution shows that this portion of the minor capsid proteins is strongly anchored to VP1 through specific hydrophobic interactions (10Chen X.S. Stehle T. Harrison S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3233-3240Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which VP1 confers conformational changes on the minor proteins remains to be further defined, one may hypothesize that this could be mediated by the region of hydrophobic interactions taking place between the major and the minor proteins. The fact that VLPs, which are only constituted from VP1, behave similarly to viral particles after SA binding indicates that there must be VP1 sequences, similar to those of VP2/3, that become exposed upon SA binding to interact with host cell membranes and further promote viral entry. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the recognition of SA moieties on host cell membranes provokes initial conformational changes in the Py capsid, which appear crucial for productive infection. In this regard, Py resembles other viruses in which a primary interaction with SA-containing receptors also leads to conformational alterations of capsid proteins (3Takimoto T. Taylor G.L. Connaris H.C. Crennell S.J. Portner A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 13028-13033Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 6Fernandes J. Tang D. Leone G. Lee P.W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17043-17047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This addresses the question of whether the recognition of SA moieties as primary cell receptors can be a mechanism to induce conformational changes in viral capsids necessary for viral entry, common to other viruses such as polyomavirus species associated with human diseases (30Liu C.K. Wei G. Atwood W.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4643-4649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Griffin for fundamental help in revising the manuscript."

Herein, we report evidence that a Cdc6-like factor from the hyperthermophilic crenarchaea Sulfolobus solfataricus stimulates binding of the homohexameric MCM-like complex to bubble- and fork-containing DNA oligonucleotides that mimic early replication intermediates.

These findings may provide important clues to understanding how the DNA replication initiation process has evolved in the more complex eukaryotic organisms. The archaeal replication apparatus appears to be a simplified version of the eukaryotic one with fewer polypeptides and simpler protein complexes. Herein, we report evidence that a Cdc6-like factor from the hyperthermophilic crenarchaea Sulfolobus solfataricus stimulates binding of the homohexameric MCM-like complex to bubble- and fork-containing DNA oligonucleotides that mimic early replication intermediates. This function does not require the Cdc6 ATP and DNA binding activities. These findings may provide important clues to understanding how the DNA replication initiation process has evolved in the more complex eukaryotic organisms. Living organisms have evolved different strategies to recruit and load DNA helicases at the replication origins, and accessory factors, referred to as helicase loaders, are required to accomplish this task (1Davey M.J. O'Donnell M. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R594-R596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 2Konieczny I. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The helicase loading process was best characterized at the molecular level in two bacterial systems: Escherichia coli (3Davey M.J. Fang L. McInerney P. Georgescu R.E. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3148-3159Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and Bacillus subtilis (4Velten M. McGovern S. Marsin S. Ehrlich S.D. Noirot P. Polard P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1009-1020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The E. coli replicative homohexameric DNA helicase DnaB associates with its loader, DnaC, forming a 6:6 complex that is recruited at the chromosomal replication origin (oriC) by the initiator protein DnaA (5Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication, 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992: 355-378Google Scholar). DnaB is then released in an active form, and this initiates formation of two replication forks that extend in opposite directions from oriC (6Fang L. Davey M.J. O'Donnell M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 541-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Because E. coli DnaB forms stable hexamers in solution that are unable to efficiently self-load onto single-stranded DNA, it was proposed that its loading by DnaC is carried out by a ring-breaking mechanism (1Davey M.J. O'Donnell M. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R594-R596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A similar ring-opening/closing mechanism was demonstrated to take place during loading of the E. coli phage T7 gp4 DNA helicase/primase, but in this case no accessory loading factor is required (7Ahnert P. Picha K.M. Patel S.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3418-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In B. subtilis, the replicative DNA helicase DnaC forms homohexamers in solution in the presence of ATP, but without ATP the hexameric form readily dissociates into monomers. The preformed hexameric DnaC helicase is unable to unwind DNA and instead must be assembled from monomers around DNA by a loading system that consists of two proteins, DnaI and DnaB (4Velten M. McGovern S. Marsin S. Ehrlich S.D. Noirot P. Polard P. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1009-1020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A ring-forming mechanism was also proposed for the E. coli bacteriophage T4 helicase gp41 (8Ishmael F.T. Alley S.C. Benkovic S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20555-20562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and for the simian virus 40 large tumor antigen, but in this latter case a separate helicase loader is not required (1Davey M.J.

It is now well established that DNA replication factors of Archaea are more similar in sequence to those found in Eukarya than to the analogous proteins of Bacteria (10Kelman L.M. Kelman Z. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Analysis of the sequenced genomes revealed that the Archaea kingdom contains homologs of certain eukaryal initiation factors (such as Cdc6 and MCM), whereas evident homologs of some other initiation factors are not present at all (e.g. Cdt1, MCM10, and Cdc45). The hyperthermophilic crenarchaea Sulfolobus solfataricus (11She Q. Singh R.K. Confalonieri F. Zivanovic Y. Allard G. Awayez M.J. Chan-Weiher C.C. Clausen I.G. Curtis B.A. De Moors A. Erauso G.

Cell. 2004; 116: 25-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The biological function of these proteins has not yet been clearly defined. Furthermore, it was found that the chromosome of S. solfataricus possesses three active DNA replication origins (15Robinson N.P. Dionne I. Lundgren M. Marsh V.L. Bernander R. Bell S.D. Cell. 2004; 116: 25-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 16Lundgren M. Andersson A. Lanming C. Nilsson P. Bernander R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Whereas oriC2 is bound by all three S. solfataricus Cdc6 factors, oriC1 is bound only by SsoCdc6-1 and SsoCdc6-2. It was proposed that SsoCdc6-1 and SsoCdc6-3 promote initiation of DNA replication because they are present in G1 and S phases, whereas SsoCdc6-2 may act as a negative regulator because it seems to be present only in G2 phase Sulfolobus cells (15Robinson N.P. Dionne I. Lundgren M. Marsh V.L. Bernander R. Bell S.D. Cell. 2004; 116: 25-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In this work we focused our attention on SsoCdc6-2 among the three S. solfataricus Cdc6 factors, because we have already investigated the biochemical properties of this protein (13De Felice M. Esposito L. Pucci B. Carpentieri F. De Falco M. Rossi M. Pisani F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46424-46431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In fact, we previously reported that SsoCdc6-2 is a monomer in solution, binds single- and double-stranded DNA molecules, undergoes autophosphorylation in vitro, possesses a weak ATPase activity, and strongly inhibits the SsoMCM DNA helicase activity (13De Felice M. Esposito L. Pucci B. Carpentieri F. De Falco M. Rossi M. Pisani F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46424-46431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, we demonstrated that SsoCdc6-2 has a modular organization since a C-terminally deleted form of the protein (named ΔC) retains the ability to bind and hydrolyze ATP, whereas the C-terminal Winged Helix (WH) domain, produced separately in recombinant form (named ΔN), is able to bind single- and double-stranded DNA and to inhibit the SsoMCM DNA helicase activity (14De Felice M. Esposito L. Pucci B. Carpentieri F. De Falco G. Manco M. Rossi M. Pisani F.M. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Herein we report evidence that SsoCdc6-2 physically interacts with SsoMCM and promotes its loading onto DNA. The ATP and DNA binding activities of SsoCdc6-2 are not required for this function. Proteins—SsoMCM, wild type and KA mutant SsoCdc6-2, and SsoCdc6-2 ΔC were purified as described (12Carpentieri F De Felice M. De Falco M. Rossi M. Pisani F.M. J. Biol.

DNA Substrates—Oligonucleotides were labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences). To prepare the double-stranded substrates the labeled oligonucleotide was annealed to a 3-fold molar excess of a cold complementary strand. The substrate containing a bubble made from a duplex surrounding poly(dT) (Bub-20T) had the following sequence: 5′-TCTACCTGGACGACCGGG-(T)20GGGCCAGCAGGTCCATCA-3′. Forked (Fork) and tailed duplex substrates were constructed by annealing the appropriate combinations of the following oligonucleotides: 5′-GCTCGGTACCCGGGGATCCTCTAGA(T)n-3′ and 5′-(T)nTCT-AGAGGATCCCCGGGTACCGAGC-3′ (where n = 0 or 20). When n = 0 for both substrates, a duplex of 25 bp was produced. The oligonucleotide (5′-CCCAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTGCGAGGCGCGCGAAGACCG-3′) was used as a single-stranded ligand in DNA band shift assays. DNA Band Shift Assays—For each substrate, 10-μl mixtures were prepared that contained 200 fmol of 32P-labeled DNA in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and the indicated amounts of SsoCdc6-2 and/or SsoMCM. Following incubation for 10–15 min at room temperature, complexes were separated by electrophoresis through 5% polyacrylamide/bisacrylamide gels (37.5:1) in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA. Gels were dried down and quantified on a Storm PhosphorImager using Image-Quant software (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation Experiments—Mixtures (volume: 10 μl) were prepared that contained wild type (or ΔC) SsoCdc6-2 (1 μg) and/or full-size (or Δ268) SsoMCM (0.2 μg) and 200 fmol of DNA Bub-20T (where indicated) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. These mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 10–15 min, then 20 μl of Dynabeads M-280 sheep anti-rabbit IgG (Dynal) conjugated with anti-SsoCdc6-2 antibodies were added, and incubation was continued at room temperature for 2 h with gentle shaking. After abundant washing with buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100), the beads were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.6% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue). After boiling, the samples were analyzed by Western blot using anti-SsoCdc6-2 or anti-SsoMCM antibodies. DNA Binding Activity of SsoCdc6-2 and SsoMCM—The ability of SsoCdc6-2 to bind DNA in a structure-dependent manner was assayed using a standard electrophoretic mobility shift assay on a variety of synthetic oligonucleotides: molecules containing a bubble of 20 T residues (Bub-20T), flayed duplexes with tails of 20 T residues (Fork), 3′- or 5′-tailed duplexes (3′-Tail and 5′-Tail), blunt double-stranded DNA molecules, and single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides. As shown in Fig. 1, SsoCdc6-2 binds preferentially to DNA molecules that contain a bubble, a fork, or a tail and produces various shifted bands, the intensity of which was dependent upon the protein concentration. DNA molecules containing bubbles of 60 residues (with the sequence (TTTTTA)10) or 10 T residues were also used as ligands in band shift experiments, and both were found to be bound with similar affinity with respect to the Bub-20T.2 On the other hand, single-stranded oligonucleotides (see Fig. 1) or blunt duplexes2 were bound with noticeably lower affinity. Similar band shift experiments were carried out to analyze whether SsoMCM bound DNA with any structural specificity. We found that SsoMCM bound all the DNA ligands tested with higher affinity with respect to SsoCdc6-2. As shown in Fig. 2, at low protein concentration binding of SsoMCM to bubble- or fork-containing ligands produced various retarded bands (see gels in Fig. 2, lanes 2–6). At higher protein concentrations, the faster migrating bands disappeared, and only a lower mobility complex was observed (see gels in Fig. 2, lanes 7 and 8). Because SsoMCM hexamers are not stable and dissociate upon dilution (12Carpentieri F De Felice M. De Falco M. Rossi M. Pisani F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12118-12127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), it is likely that the faster migrating bands are produced by binding to DNA of these various SsoMCM subassemblies, whereas the slower migrating complex found at the higher protein concentrations could contain one or possibly two SsoMCM hexamers. SsoCdc6-2 Stimulates Binding of SsoMCM to Bubble- or Fork-containing DNA Molecules—We decided to analyze the mutual effect of SsoCdc6-2 and SsoMCM on the binding to oligonucleotides containing either a bubble or a fork structure. When SsoCdc6-2 was incubated alone with the bubble-containing DNA molecules it produced a main retarded band in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Complex I in Fig. 3A, lane 2). On the other hand, SsoMCM (0.5–1.0 pmol) incubated alone with the bubble-containing DNA molecules formed a single slow migrating complex (Complex II in Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6). When SsoCdc6-2 and SsoMCM were mixed together in the above experimental conditions, we observed a gradual reduction of Complex I (Fig. 3B) together with an increase of Complex II. In a subsequent set of band shift assays the amount of SsoMCM was kept constant at a value that produced only a minimal amount of Complex II (0.1 pmol, see Fig. 3C, lane 5), whereas the amount of SsoCdc6-2 was increased from 0 to 8 pmol, a range of values that produced a low level of DNA band shift (Fig. 3C, lanes 2–4). In these conditions we found that Complex II was increased with respect to the experiments in which SsoMCM was incubated alone, and this increase was proportional to the concentration of SsoCdc6-2 used (Fig. 3C, lanes 6–8). Complex II formation was increased by about 50-fold when 16 pmol of SsoCdc6-2 were used (see plot in Fig. 3D). These results indicate that SsoCdc6-2 promotes SsoMCM binding to bubble-containing oligonucleotides. This effect was not significantly influenced by the addition of ATP (or ADP) and was also observed on the fork-containing DNA molecules although to a lesser extent (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, it was not dependent on the order of addition of the two proteins to the mixtures containing the DNA molecules. A similar effect was not observed in control experiments where, instead of SsoCdc6-2, we used equal amounts of various proteins including a single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SsoSSB) (17Wadsworth R.I. White M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 914-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) or a family B DNA polymerase (SsoDNA pol B1) (18Pisani F.M. De Felice M. Rossi M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15005-150012Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) from S. solfataricus, and a carboxylesterase from the bacterium Alyciclobacillus acidocaldarius (19Manco G. Mandrich L. Rossi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37482-37490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Loading of SsoMCM onto DNA Does Not Require the SsoCdc6-2 ATP and DNA Binding Activities—To further investigate the mechanisms by which SsoCdc6-2 stimulates binding of SsoMCM to DNA, we analyzed the loading capability of a C-terminally truncated form of SsoCdc6-2, referred to as SsoCdc6-2 ΔC. The ΔC protein contains an intact nucleotide-binding Rossmann fold but lacks the last C-terminal 103 amino acid residues that are likely to fold into a DNA-binding WH domain. We recently reported that this protein retains the ability to bind and hydrolyze ATP, but it is completely devoid of the DNA binding function (14De Felice M. Esposito L. Pucci B. Carpentieri F. De Falco G. Manco M. Rossi M. Pisani F.M. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 4A, lane 7). We found that the SsoCdc6-2 ΔC protein stimulates the SsoMCM binding to DNA with an efficiency comparable with the full-size protein (see Fig. 4A, lanes 8–12). These results indicate that the SsoCdc6-2 DNA binding activity is not required to stimulate binding of SsoMCM to DNA. In addition, we studied the effect of a SsoCdc6-2 Walker A mutant (referred to as SsoCdc6-2 KA) on the SsoMCM interaction with a bubble-containing DNA ligand by band shift assays. The SsoCdc6-2 KA protein carries a substitution of the Walker A lysine residue 59 by alanine and was shown to be completely unable to bind and hydrolyze ATP (13De Felice M. Esposito L. Pucci B. Carpentieri F. De Falco M. Rossi M. Pisani F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46424-46431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We found that the SsoCdc6-2 KA mutant promoted SsoMCM binding to DNA with an efficiency similar to the wild type protein (Fig. 4B), indicating that integrity of the Walker A motif is not required for SsoMCM loading onto DNA. SsoCdc6-2 and SsoMCM Physically Interact—The stimulation of the SsoMCM DNA binding activity by SsoCdc6-2 suggested that the two proteins could physically interact with one another. In a previous report we demonstrated by a gel filtration analysis that SsoMCM and SsoCdc6-2 are able to associate, but the protein complexes formed were unstable (13De Felice M. Esposito L. Pucci B. Carpentieri F. De Falco M. Rossi M. Pisani F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46424-46431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study a physical interaction between the two proteins was tested by immunoprecipitation experiments using Dynabeads that were conjugated with antibodies raised against the homogeneous SsoCdc6-2. As shown in Fig. 5, SsoCdc6-2 is able to associate with SsoMCM either in the absence or presence of bubble-containing DNA molecules. Likewise, the SsoCdc6-2 ΔC protein was able to physically interact with SsoMCM, indicating that its C-terminal WH domain is not necessary to establish this association. To further investigate the physical/functional interaction between SsoCdc6-2 and SsoMCM we carried out electrophoretic mobility shift assays using a truncated form of SsoMCM, named SsoMCM Δ268. This protein lacks the first N-terminal 268 amino acid residues, including the zinc-binding motif and a cluster of basic residues that are thought to be responsible for the DNA binding function (20Fletcher R.J. Bishop B.E. Leon R.P. Sclafani R.A. Ogata C.M. Chen X.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). We have recently found that SsoMCM Δ268 retains ATPase activity, forms homohexamers in solution but is completely unable to bind to DNA. 3B. Pucci, M. De Felice, and F. M. Pisani, manuscript in preparation. When a fixed amount of SsoMCM Δ268 (2 pmol) was mixed with SsoCdc6-2 (amounts ranging from 5 to 40 pmol), we observed a gradual reduction of the shifted Complex I with respect to control experiments where SsoMCM Δ268 was omitted (see Fig. 6A). A likely interpretation of these findings is that SsoMCM Δ268 interacts with SsoCdc6-2, and this interaction causes a reduction of the SsoCdc6-2 DNA binding affinity. This hypothesis was confirmed by the results of immunoprecipitation experiments carried out on mixtures of the two proteins using Dynabeads that were conjugated with antibodies raised against SsoCdc6-2 (Fig. 6B). These findings also indicate that the first N-terminal 268 amino acid residues of the SsoMCM polypeptide chain are not necessary for the physical interaction with SsoCdc6-2. All sequenced archaeal genomes were found to contain genes putatively coding for Orc1/Cdc6 homologs, the only exception being Methanococcus jannaschii. However, whereas certain species, such as those of the Pyrococcus genus and Pyrobaculum aerophilum, have a single Orc1/Cdc6-like protein, several other archaea have multiple Orc1/Cdc6 homologs. It is quite likely that in the species having a single Orc1/Cdc6 homolog this factor may function either as the replication initiator or as the replicative DNA helicase loader. On the other hand, in species with multiple Orc1/Cdc6 factors they may play different roles in the establishment of active replication forks. The hyperthermophilic crenarchaea S. solfataricus possesses three Orc1/Cdc6-like initiation factors. The biological function of these proteins has not yet been clearly defined. In the current study we demonstrate that SsoCdc6-2 binds DNA molecules that mimic early replication intermediates in a sequence-independent manner and stimulates binding of the SsoMCM DNA helicase to these DNA ligands. In a previous study we showed that the SsoMCM homohexamers are not stable but dissociate in solution into various subhexameric complexes (12Carpentieri F De Felice M. De Falco M. Rossi M. Pisani F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12118-12127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We propose that the SsoMCM loading process is of the ring assembly type, being likely to proceed through the recruitment of the helicase monomers and their oligomerization around DNA. Our analysis indicates that the SsoCdc6-2 DNA-binding WH domain is not necessary to establish an association with SsoMCM and to promote its loading onto DNA. In fact, we showed that these functions are also carried out by a C-terminally truncated form of SsoCdc6-2, which only contains an AAA+ (ATPases with associated cellular activities) module (14De Felice M. Esposito L. Pucci B. Carpentieri F. De Falco G. Manco M. Rossi M. Pisani F.M. Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Our current working hypothesis is that the SsoCdc6-2 ATPases with associated cellular activities module could promote the oligomerization of the SsoMCM monomers, although an integral Walker A motif does not seem to be required for this function. On the other hand, the SsoCdc6-2 WH domain could be responsible for the recruitment of SsoMCM at the replication origins by means of its ability to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner (15Robinson N.P. Dionne I. Lundgren M. Marsh V.L. Bernander R. Bell S.D. Cell. 2004; 116: 25-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, SsoCdc6-2 could also play a role in loading SsoMCM at stalled replication forks, because it binds and promotes binding of this hexameric DNA helicase to DNA in a structure-dependent fashion. It was recently shown that the MCM-like complex and one of the two Cdc6 homologs of the Archaea Archeoglobus fulgidus bind with higher affinity DNA molecules containing a single-stranded bubble. However, in contrast with our results, the A. fulgidus Cdc6 factor was found to displace MCM hexamers bound to these DNA molecules (21Grainge I. Scaife S. Wigley D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 4888-4898Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that in a recent sequence analysis of the Cdc6-like proteins from various archaeal species, SsoCdc6-2 and the above A. fulgidus Cdc6 factor were reported to belong to different phylogenetic clades, thus being likely that they may play different roles at the replication origins (22Berquist B.R. DasSarma S. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5959-5966Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, the two other S. solfataricus Cdc6 factors have been recently characterized by us and discovered to promote binding of SsoMCM to bubble- or fork-containing DNA molecules with an efficiency similar to SsoCdc6-2.2 In addition, we have found that SsoCdc6-1 and -2 inhibit the SsoMCM DNA unwinding function in vitro, as reported previously in the case of SsoCdc6-2 (13De Felice M. Esposito L. Pucci B. Carpentieri F. De Falco M. Rossi M. Pisani F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46424-46431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, we postulate that SsoMCM is loaded onto DNA at the replication origins in an inactive form and released as an active DNA helicase at the onset of mitosis by the action of other replication factors. Our ongoing biochemical analysis of the interplay among the various S. solfataricus initiation factors will help in unraveling the mechanisms of replisome assembly in this species and may also provide important clues toward understanding the molecular mechanisms by which replicative DNA helicases are recruited and loaded onto DNA during chromosomal DNA replication in the more complex eukaryotic organisms. We thank Dr. Stuart MacNeill (Edinburgh, United Kingdom) for critical reading of the manuscript."

Apoptosis is one of the important regulatory mechanisms of this turnover. Therefore, identification of the factors that control epithelial cell apoptosis should help us understand the mechanism of intestinal mucosal turnover. Here, we report the identification of a novel small intestine-specific member of the Ly-6 family, intectin, by signal sequence trap method. Intectin mRNA expression was exclusively identified in the intestine and localized at the villus tips of intestinal mucosa, which is known to undergo apoptosis.

Intectin expression also reduced cell-cell adhesion of intestinal epithelial cells. Intestinal epithelial cells originate from stem cells at the base of the crypt and migrate along the crypt-villus axis toward the intestinal lumen. When intestinal epithelial cells reach the luminal surface at the villus tips, they finally exfoliate into the lumen, and their cell cycle is terminated with a life span of only 3–5 days (1Potten C.S. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1992; 11: 179-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 2Potten C.S. Allen T.D. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1977; 60: 272-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This constant and rapid turnover of intestinal mucosa is essential for maximal nutrient absorption, adaptation to changes in diet, and repair of mucosal injury (3Williamson R.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 1978; 298: 1444-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Apoptosis plays an important role in maintaining the physiological integrity of many tissues. In the intestine, apoptosis is a key regulator for the turnover of intestinal mucosa, and apoptotic intestinal epithelial cells have been detected at the villus tips of the small intestine and the colonic luminal surface (4Jones B.A. Gores G.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G1174-G1188PubMed Google Scholar, 5Potten C.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G253-G257PubMed Google Scholar, 6Groos S. Reale E. Luciano L. Anat. Rec. 2003; 272: 503-513Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, the one or more underlying mechanisms of this process have not been elucidated. In this regard, it is important to identify the factors that control intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis to understand the mechanism of intestinal mucosal turnover. The present study was designed to identify a small intestine-derived protein or secretory protein modulated nutritionally that is involved in the control of intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis. Using the efficient signal sequence trap (SST) 1The abbreviations used are: SST-REX, signal sequence trap by retrovirus-mediated expression screening system; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; PI, propidium iodide; PIG-A, phosphatidylinositolglycan-class A; PI-PLC, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C; PNH, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DIG, digoxigenin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary cells; RT, reverse transcription; ISH, in situ hybridization. method (7Kojima T. Kitamura T. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we identified a novel small intestine-specific GPI-anchored protein, intectin, which showed distinct localization at the villus tips of intestinal mucosa and accelerated fatty acid-induced apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells. Cloning of Intectin cDNA—Poly(A)+ RNAs were extracted from the small intestinal epithelium of C57BL/6J mice under three feeding conditions; ad libitum, 24-h fasting, and 24-h fasting followed by 24-h feeding, and from the small intestinal epithelium of ad libitum-fed db/db mice. Equal amount of poly(A)+ RNA from each group was pooled and used as the template to synthesize complementary DNA (cDNA). To selectively clone the genes with signal sequence at the N-terminal end of cDNAs, the SST-REX system (signal sequence trap by retrovirus-mediated expression screening system) was introduced as described previously by our laboratories (7Kojima T. Kitamura T. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA was synthesized from the poly(A)+ RNA by random hexamers, using the SuperScript System (Invitrogen), and was then inserted into BstXI sites of the pMX-SST vector, using BstXI adapters (Invitrogen). The ligated DNA was amplified in DH10B cells (Electromax, Invitrogen) to construct an SST-REX library, and a library DNA was prepared using Qiagen plasmid kits (Qiagen). High titer retroviruses representing the SST-REX library were produced using the packaging cell line PlatE and infected to Ba/F3 cells. After 1-day infection period, selection of factor-independent Ba/F3 cells commenced in the absence of interleukin-3, using 96-well multititer plates. The integrated cDNAs were isolated from the interleukin-3-independent Ba/F3 cells by genomic PCR and sequenced. Animals and Experimental Protocol—C57BL/6J and obese diabetic db/db mice were obtained from Clea Japan (Tokyo) and kept under a 12-h/12-h dark/light cycle (lights on: 8 am to 8 pm) at constant temperature (22 °C) with free access to food and water. The composition of the diet was as follows: carbohydrate, 54.0%; protein, 23.8%; and fat, 5.1%. For analysis of intectin mRNA expression in various tissues of mouse, 6-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were used. For fasting and refeeding time-course experiments, 3–4 male mice (6-week-old) were used in each group. The groups consisted of mice fed ad libitum with standard chow, mice fasted for 24 h, and mice refed 1, 2, and 4 h after 24-h fasting. Mice were sacrificed under deep anesthesia, and their small intestines were harvested immediately. Experiments designed to determine intectin mRNA expression in the small intestine were conducted in 6-week-old C57BL/6J and db/db mice. All experimental protocols described in this report were approved by the Ethics Review Committee for Animal Experimentation of Osaka University. RNA Isolation, Northern Blot, and Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from various tissues, using RNA STAT-60 kit (Tel-Test “B” Inc., Friendswood, TX) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Ten micrograms of total RNA was subjected to Northern blotting as described previously (8Nishizawa H. Shimomura I. Kishida K. Maeda N. Kuriyama H. Nagaretani H. Matsuda M. Kondo H. Furuyama N. Kihara S. Nakamura T. Tochino Y. Funahashi T. Matsuzawa Y. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2734-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). First strand cDNA was synthesized using ThermoScript™ RT-PCR System (Invitrogen). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed on a LightCycler using the FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche Diagnostics, Tokyo, Japan) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The following forward and reverse primers were used for quantitative PCR amplifications: mouse intectin, 5′-GTTGCCCCTGATTCTGCTGG-3′ and 5′-GCACTATTGCAGAGGT-CCGT-3′; mouse cyclophilin, 5′-CAGACGCCACTGTCGCTTT-3′ and 5′-TGTCTTTGGAACTTTGTCTGCAA-3′. Construction of Stable Expression Vector—To express FLAG-tagged intectin, we constructed an expression vector of FLAG-tagged intectin containing the signal sequence of CD59. We prepared a cDNA of intectin (amino acids 21–111: removed the region corresponding to intectin signal sequence) by PCR using a pair of primers containing HindIII and NotI restriction enzyme sites, respectively, 5′-CCCCAAGCTTTTGAAGTGTCATGAATGC-3′, corresponding to amino acids 21–26 and 5′-TTTTTTTTGCGGCCGCCTACTGGCTGAGATAGATATAGC-3′, corresponding to amino acids 106–111. The amplified product was digested with HindIII and NotI to isolate a 290-bp fragment. The pME-puro-FLAG-CD59 vector (a kind gift from Dr. T. Kinoshita, Osaka University) was digested with HindIII-SfiI and NotI-SfiI, respectively. The above three isolated fragments were ligated to generate pME-CD59 (signal sequence)-FLAG-intectin. Cell Culture—IEC-6 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin in a watersaturated atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. To measure palmitate-induced cell death, IEC-6 cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 104 cells/cm2. The medium was removed 36 h later, and the cells were incubated in DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS in the presence of 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) alone or with various concentrations of palmitate (25, 50, 100, and 200 μm) for 12 h. Establishment of Stable Cell Lines Expressing FLAG-tagged Intectin—To create stable cell lines that express FLAG-tagged intectin, electroporation was performed using GenePulser transfection apparatus (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA). IEC-6 cells (80–90% confluence) were trypsinized and suspended in DMEM. Approximately 6 × 106 cells were resuspended in FBS-free DMEM without antibiotics and with 10 μg of plasmid DNA in a final volume of 400 μl. Electroporation was performed at room temperature (500 microfarads, 250 V, 0.4-cm cuvette). After electroporation, the cells were incubated at room temperature for 10 min, diluted in DMEM with 10% FBS, and then plated onto a 10-cm dish. The transfected cells were selected by growth in a medium containing 2 μg/ml puromycin. Cell clones were obtained from individual puromycin-resistant colonies using the limiting dilution method. FLAG-tagged intectin expression was investigated by flow cytometry. Cell Fractionation and Western Blotting—IEC-mock cells (IEC-mock) and IEC-6 cells expressing FLAG-tagged intectin (IEC-intectin) were harvested after confluence. The cells were lysed with extraction buffer containing a protease inhibitor mixture as described previously (8Nishizawa H. Shimomura I. Kishida K. Maeda N. Kuriyama H. Nagaretani H. Matsuda M. Kondo H. Furuyama N. Kihara S. Nakamura T. Tochino Y. Funahashi T. Matsuzawa Y. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2734-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar) and divided into membrane fraction and cytosolic fraction by centrifugation (15 min, 20,000 × g, 4 °C). Equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-14% PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated with a mouse anti-FLAG M2-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma). Immunoreactive protein bands were visualized by using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Flow Cytometry—For selection of FLAG-tagged intectin-expressing cells, cells were stained with anti-FLAG FITC-conjugated antibody. Stained cells were analyzed by FACSort (BD Biosciences). The cellular DNA content was determined by flow cytometric measurement of propidium iodide (PI) binding. In preparation for flow cytometry, both adherent and unattached cells were harvested and combined. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and fixed with 70% cold ethanol. After treatment with 1 μg/ml DNase-free RNase A in PBS containing 10 μg/ml PI, the cells were analyzed using a FACSort. The cell cycle distribution was quantified by using FlowJO (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR) software. In Situ Hybridization—According to the instructions supplied by the manufacturer (digoxigenin (DIG) RNA labeling kit (SP6/T7), Roche Diagnostics), DIG-labeled RNA probes were synthesized using intectin full-length cDNA, which was cloned into pCRII-TOPO (Invitrogen). Male C57BL/6Cr Slc mice (6-week-old, SLC, Shizuoka, Japan) were deeply anesthetized by sodium pentobarbital and perfused transcardially with PBS and 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer. Tissues were postfixed for 12–24 h with the same fixative and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections (4 μm) were treated with 0.2 n HCl for 30 min and 10 μg/ml proteinase K for 15 min at 37 °C followed by re-fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. Hybridization was performed overnight at 50 °C in a hybridization solution (40% formamide, 0.6 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1× Denhardt's solution, 250 μg/ml tRNA, 125 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 10% dextran sulfate, and 200 ng/ml DIG-labeled probe). After treatment with 20 μg/ml RNase A (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C, the sections were washed with 0.2× SSC at 55 °C. The sections were immunolabeled with anti-DIG alkaline-phosphatase conjugate (Roche Diagnostics), and color was developed using nitro blue tetrazolium/BCIP (5-bromo, 4-chloro, 3-indoylphosphate), which created black and purple signals. Some specimens were counter-stained with hematoxylin. Cell Viability Assay—The cells (5 × 103/well) in 96-well plates were cultured for 12 h, then exchanged with medium in the absence or presence of various concentrations of apoptotic inducer, and further incubated for 12 h (palmitate) or 24 h (camptothecin and daunorubicin). The cell viability was determined using Cell Count Reagent SF (Nacalai Tesque, Japan). WST-8 (9Uchida E. Mizuguchi H. Ishii-Watabe A. Hayakawa T. Biol. Pharmacol. Bull. 2002; 25: 891-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), which is based on colorimetric quantification of NADH, was added to the culture. After 1 h, absorbance at 450 and 650 nm was measured using a Viento multi-spectrophotometer (Dainippon, Tokyo, Japan). In Vitro Caspase-3 Activity Assay—Caspase-3 activity was measured using the ApoAlert caspase assay kit (BD Biosciences), using the instructions supplied by the manufacturer. Briefly, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, lysed for 10 min on ice with cell lysis buffer (BD Biosciences), and centrifuged (10 min, 15,000 × g, 4 °C) to remove debris. After determination of protein concentration using the BCA protein quantification kit (Pierce Chemical Co.) with BSA as a standard, 10 μg of the protein was incubated with caspase-3 substrate, ac-DEVD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin at 37 °C for 1 h. The initial rate of release of free ac-DEVD-7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin was measured using a Spectra MAX GeminiXS microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) in fluorescence mode using an excitation filter of 400 nm and an emission filter of 505 nm. Enzyme activity was calculated according to the formula provided by the manufacturer. Cell Aggregation Assay—Cell aggregation assay was performed as described previously (10Whittard J.D. Akiyama S.K. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 263: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Parental Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and intectin-transfected CHO cells (CHO-intectin) were washed with PBS and incubated with 0.125% trypsin and 0.5 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 3 min. Dispersed cells were suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution (1 × 106 cells/ml) and then placed on BSA pre-coated 24-well plate (0.5 ml). The cells were incubated under continuous shaking at 70 rpm for the indicated periods of time. The reaction was stopped with the addition of an equal volume of 4% paraformaldehyde. Samples were evaluated by counting single cells and aggregates. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed with unpaired t-tests. A p value less than 0.05 denoted the presence of a statistically significant difference. Identification of Intectin as a Small Intestine-derived Nutritionally Modulated Membrane Protein—We previously developed an efficient SST method using retrovirus-mediated gene transfer (7Kojima T. Kitamura T. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To identify small intestine-derived nutritionally modulated membrane protein or secretory protein, we conducted this SST method using the pooled poly(A)+ RNA from the small intestinal epithelium of mice at ad libitum, fasted and refed conditions, and obese diabetic db/db mice. We screened and sequenced 1224 clones. Four clones were selected as unknown proteins with signal sequence or transmembrane region. The mRNA of one clone was exclusively expressed in the small intestine among various tissues of mice as revealed by Northern blotting analysis and quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 1, A and B). This clone and its full-length cDNA were selected and named intectin. The nucleotide sequence and deduced 111-amino acid sequence of intectin are shown in Fig 1C. A hydrophobicity plot revealed a 20-residue N-terminal and a 13-residue C-terminal signal peptide (Fig. 1, C and D) (11Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar). A potential GPI-anchoring site was identified at Asn-88 based on the published GPI consensus sequences (Fig. 1C) (12Johnson R. Lancki D.W. Fitch F.W. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2986-2999PubMed Google Scholar). A Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search revealed that intectin sequence is identical to NM_025929 (GenBank™), whose function is totally unknown, and that intectin has a Ly-6 domain (Fig. 2). All cysteine residues highly conserved among Ly-6 family are present in intectin. The amino acid similarity of intectin to other Ly-6 family is not high, with homology of only 30–40% (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Amino acid alignments between intectin and other mouse Ly-6 proteins. The amino acid sequence of intectin is aligned with other known mouse Ly-6 proteins. The highly conserved 10 cysteines in mouse Ly-6 proteins are indicated by bold boxed letters.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We established a stable cell line that expressed intectin by transfecting the intectin-FLAG gene into a normal intestinal epithelial cell line, IEC-6. Expression of intectin protein in intectin-transfected IEC-6 (IEC-intectin) and mock-transfected IEC-6 (IEC-mock) are shown in Fig. 3A. IEC-intectin cells expressed intectin protein in the cell membrane fraction, and intectin protein was not detected in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that intectin can be considered a membrane-associated protein. As described above, intectin protein has a predicted GPI-anchoring site in Asn-88. To clarify whether intectin is a GPI-anchored protein, we treated the cells with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) exhibiting activity to excise GPI-anchored region. Without PI-PLC treatment, IEC-intectin cells exhibited higher FITC signal on cell membrane, compared with IEC-mock cells (Fig. 3B). PI-PLC treatment of IEC-intectin cells decreased the signal to the level of IEC-mock cells (Fig. 3B). The same results were observed in FLAG-tagged intectin-transfected CHO cells as well as FLAG-tagged CD59, a known GPI-anchored protein, transfected CHO cells (data not shown). These results indicate that intectin is a GPI-anchored protein. Exclusive Expression of Intectin in the Small Intestine— Analysis of various tissues of 6-week-old C57BL/6J mice by Northern blotting and quantitative RT-PCR showed that intectin mRNA was expressed exclusively in the small intestine (Fig. 1, A and B). Unlike other known members of the Ly-6 family, which are highly expressed in peripheral blood leukocytes and in lymphoid organs, intectin mRNA expression was not detected in the bone marrow, WR19L (mouse T cell line), WEHI3 (mouse macrophage-like cell line), and BaF3 (mouse pro-B cell line) cells by quantitative RT-PCR (data not shown). In situ hybridization was performed to determine the distribution of intectin mRNA in the intestine. Remarkably, a strong signal was detected only at the villus tips of the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum (Fig. 4, B, E, H, and N), and only a weak signal was detected in the colon (Fig. 4K), and a trace signal was found in the stomach and esophagus (data not shown). No signal was detected in all other tissues examined, including the brain, spleen, heart, lungs, eyes, lymph nodes, thyroid, skeletal muscles, thymus, liver, WAT, BAT, pituitary, adrenals, urinary bladder, gallbladder, and testes, by in situ hybridization (data not shown). Thus, intectin mRNA was exclusively expressed in the villus tips of the epithelial cells of the mouse small intestine. In this regard, Groos et al. (6Groos S. Reale E. Luciano L. Anat. Rec. 2003; 272: 503-513Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) reported the exclusive presence of apoptotic cells at the villus tips in human and rat small intestine epithelium. Thus, it is likely that the intectinpositive region is the same as that where apoptosis was identified by Groos et al. (6Groos S. Reale E. Luciano L. Anat. Rec. 2003; 272: 503-513Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Intectin mRNA Expression Is Modulated by Nutritional Status—We next examined the nutritional regulation of intectin mRNA expression in vivo (Fig. 5A). Intectin mRNA expression in the small intestine was significantly decreased by 24-h fasting and restored to basal level by 1- to 2-h refeeding (Fig. 5A). These results indicate that intectin mRNA expression is modulated by nutritional stimuli. This conclusion was supported by our finding in db/db mice, whose daily food intake is 1.5- to 2-fold higher than that of age-matched C57BL/6J mice (data not shown); intectin mRNA expression in the small intestine of 6-week-old db/db mice was significantly higher than ad libitum-fed C57BL/6J mice (Fig. 5B). Involvement of Intectin in the Rapid Turnover of Intestinal Mucosa—Based on its specific expression at the villus tips of the intestine and active nutritional regulation, we hypothesized that intectin could be involved in the rapid turnover of intestinal mucosa. To test our hypothesis, we first compared the viability of IEC-intectin cells and IEC-mock cells. Cell viability assay was performed after 12-h treatment with palmitate, a nutrient-derived inducer of apoptosis, or 24-h treatment with camptothecin and daunorubicin, chemical inducers of apoptosis. Palmitate treatment decreased cell viability of both IEC-intectin cells and IEC-mock cells, but the effect was significantly more pronounced in IEC-intectin cells than IEC-mock cells (Fig. 6A). For example, 6.3 μm palmitate reduced cell viability of IEC-intectin cells to 50%, whereas a similar change in cell viability of IEC-mock cells required 50 μm palmitate. On the other hand, there was no difference in cell viability between IEC-intectin cells and IEC-mock cells after treatment with camptothecin or daunorubicin (data not shown). Intectin Induces Apoptosis of Intestinal Mucosal Cells via Caspase-3 Activation—Next, we compared the effects of palmitate on cell cycle in IEC-intectin cells and IEC-mock cells. For this purpose, the cells were incubated with palmitate and then stained with PI and sorted according to DNA content. As shown in Fig. 6B, cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry indicated that palmitate dose-dependently decreased the G1 population, whereas it increased the sub-G1 population and the cell death fraction, including apoptotic cells. These palmitate-induced changes in the cell cycle toward cell death were more pronounced in IEC-intectin cells compared with IEC-mock cells. For example, the majority of IEC-mock cells were in the G1 or G2 phase, while the majority of IEC-intectin cells were in the sub-G1 phase when these cells were incubated in the presence of 50 or 100 μm palmitate (Fig. 6B). To further examine the possible involvement of intectin in the rapid turnover of intestinal mucosa through cell death and especially through apoptosis, we measured caspase-3 activity in palmitate-treated IEC-intectin cells and IEC-mock cells (Fig. 6C). Because activation of caspase-3 is a common downstream effector of diverse apoptotic pathways (13Green D.R. Cell. 2000; 102: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar), we measured cleavage of colorimetric substrate, specific to caspase-3. Low dose palmitate significantly increased caspase-3 activity in IEC-intectin cells compared with in IEC-mock cells. Taken together, the above results suggest that intectin expression causes activation of caspase-3, which in turn induces apoptotic death of IEC-6 cells. Intectin Reduces Cell-to-Cell Adhesion—Previous studies suggested that some members of the Ly-6 family are involved in cell-cell adhesion (14Bamezai A. Rock K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4294-4298Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 15Hanninen A. Jaakkola I. Salmi M. Simell O. Jalkanen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6898-6903Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Therefore, we conducted a cell aggregation assay using parental CHO cells (CHO) and CHO cells stably expressing intectin (CHO-intectin). Intectin expression significantly attenuated CHO cell aggregation (Fig. 6D), suggesting that intectin expression weakens the cell-cell adhesion probably to promote the exfoliation of intestinal epithelial cells. The intestinal mucosa is continuously exposed to various toxic factors, including enteropathogenic microorganisms and food antigens. It also has to face potent digestive enzymes present in the lumen secreted from the liver and pancreas. In such harmful environments, the intestinal mucosa exhibits a rapid turnover, which serves to maintain the essential functions of the intestine and the integrity of the intestinal wall. The regulation of this rapid turnover of intestinal mucosa is complex and controlled by several factors. Apoptosis is one important factor that determines this process (16Potten C.S. Wilson J.W. Booth C. Stem Cells. 1997; 15: 82-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 17Hall P.A. Coates P.J. Ansari B. Hopwood D. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3569-3577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, identification of the regulatory factors of intestinal mucosal apoptosis should help us understand the mechanism of intestinal mucosal turnover. In the present study, we identified intectin using an efficient SST technique. Although the precise physiological significance of intectin has yet to be determined, several important features were defined in the present study. 1) Intectin is a new member of GPI-anchored Ly-6 family; 2) intectin mRNA is exclusively expressed in the villus tips of the small intestine, which are known to undergo apoptosis; 3) intectin mRNA expression is influenced by nutritional changes; 4) intectin expression increases the sensitivity of intestinal epithelial cells to palmitate-induced apoptosis; and 5) intectin expression significantly attenuates cell aggregation. These findings suggest that intectin might modulate nutrition-dependent apoptosis, weaken cell-cell attachment, and promote the dying cells to exfoliate into the lumen at the final stage of intestinal mucosal turnover. The intectin gene is located on murine chromosome 15, similar to murine Ly-6 genes (18LeClair K.P. Rabin M. Nesbitt M.N. Pravtcheva D. Ruddle F.H. Palfree R.G. Bothwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1638-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The intectin protein is composed of 111 amino acid residues and has an Ly-6 domain, which is defined by a distinct disulfide-binding pattern between 10 cysteine residues. Furthermore, intectin protein has N-terminal and C-terminal signal sequences, and the result of PI-PLC treatment of intectin-expressing cells indicated that intectin was a GPI-anchored protein, a hallmark of Ly-6 family. These findings indicate that intectin is a novel member of the Ly-6 family. Previous studies suggested the involvement of Ly-6A/E in T-cell activation (19Flood P.M. Dougherty J.P. Ron Y. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 20Lee S.K. Su B. Maher S.E. Bothwell A.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2167-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and development (21Bamezai A. Palliser D. Berezovskaya A. McGrew J. Higgins K. Lacy E. Rock K.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4233-4239PubMed Google Scholar). Ly-6A/E and Ly-6C have been shown to regulate cell adhesion (14Bamezai A. Rock K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4294-4298Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 15Hanninen A. Jaakkola I. Salmi M. Simell O. Jalkanen S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6898-6903Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), but the in vivo functions of Ly-6 family are unknown with the exception of CD59 and urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor. CD59 functions as a membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis, and failure to express CD59 is related to the pathogenesis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). In PNH, acquired somatic defect of the PIG-A gene results in a defect in GPI-anchored proteins expression, including CD59, on the cell surface, making blood cells more susceptible to host complement-mediated lysis (22Kinoshita T. Ohishi K. Takeda J. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 23Rosse W.F. Ware R.E. Blood. 1995; 86: 3277-3286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These patients are more susceptible to leukemia (24Horikawa K. Nakamura H. Kawaguchi T. Iwamoto N. Nagakura S. Kagimoto T. Takatsuki K. Blood. 1997; 90: 2716-2722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) due to resistance to apoptosis caused by PIG-A gene mutations, suggesting that some of GPI-anchored proteins are important in modulating apoptosis (25Brodsky R.A. Vala M.S. Barber J.P. Medof M.E. Jones R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8756-8760Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Considered together with the results of the present study, it is conceivable that intectin, a member of the GPI-anchored Ly-6 family proteins, is involved in the regulation of intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis. Induction of apoptosis by palmitate has been reported in various cells, including pancreatic β-cells (26Shimabukuro M. Zhou Y.T. Levi M. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2498-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar), cardiomyocytes (27Sparagna G.C. Hickson-Bick D.L. Buja L.M. McMillin J.B. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2001; 3: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and hematopoietic cells (28Paumen M.B. Ishida Y. Muramatsu M. Yamamoto M. Honjo T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3324-3329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrated that palmitate induced apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells. Furthermore, recent studies reported nutritional modulation of intestinal mucosal apoptosis (29Raab S. Leiser R. Kemmer H. Claus R. Metabolism. 1998; 47: 1105-1111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 30Sukhotnik I. Shiloni E. Krausz M.M. Yakirevich E. Sabo E. Mogilner J. Coran A.G. Harmon C.M. J. Pediatr.

Res. 2003; 109: 74-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Raab et al. (29Raab S. Leiser R. Kemmer H. Claus R. Metabolism. 1998; 47: 1105-1111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) showed that high energy diet and purines in the diet induced intestinal mucosal apoptosis. In addition, Sukhotnik et al. (30Sukhotnik I. Shiloni E. Krausz M.M. Yakirevich E. Sabo E. Mogilner J. Coran A.G. Harmon C.M. J. Pediatr. Surg. 2003; 38: 1182-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) reported that exposure to low fat diet decreased intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis in a rat model of short bowel syndrome. These reports implicate nutrient-derived fat should induce apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells. Groos et al. (31Groos S. Reale E. Hunefeld G. Luciano L. J. Surg. Res. 2003; 109: 74-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) also showed that apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells at the villus tips was markedly reduced in subjects receiving total parenteral nutrition over 2 weeks compared with enterally nourished subjects, suggesting that food components seem to influence apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells. The precise molecular mechanism that regulates apoptosis of intestinal mucosa in response to nutritional conditions has not yet been established. Since intectin mRNA expression was restored as fast as 1 h after refeeding following 24-h fasting, intectin expression is more likely regulated by food-related physical stimuli rather than by endocrine factors such as insulin. Palmitate is a major fatty acid in fat diet and is probably involved in fat diet-induced apoptosis of intestinal mucosa. Our finding that intectin accelerated palmitate-induced apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells suggests that diet-induced expression of intectin might mediate this diet-induced apoptosis of intestinal mucosa. Apoptotic cells are observed at the villus tips of intestinal mucosa. In certain inflammatory conditions, such as celiac disease, nematode infections, and graft-versus-host disease, the numbers of apoptotic nuclei were increased in villus epithelial cells (32Moss S.F. Attia L. Scholes J.V. Walters J.R. Holt P.R. Gut. 1996; 39: 811-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 33Hyoh Y. Nishida M. Tegoshi T. Yamada M. Uchikawa R. Matsuda S. Arizono N.

In addition, the involvement of dysregulation of the apoptotic process in intestinal epithelial cells in inflammatory bowel diseases and colon cancer has also been suggested (36Ruemmele F.M. Seidman E.G. Lentze M.J. J. Pediatr. Gastroenterol. Nutr. 2002; 34: 254-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 37Shanmugathasan M. Jothy S. Pathol. Int. 2000; 50: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that apoptosis plays some role in pathological conditions as well as in physiological turnover of villus epithelial cells. In this regard, whether intectin is involved in the pathology of inflammatory bowel diseases or colon cancer remains to be elucidated. In conclusion, we described in this study the identification of intectin, a novel intestine-specific GPI-anchored protein. This protein enhanced palmitate-induced apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells. We thank the members of Shimomura's laboratory for the helpful discussions. We thank Drs.

In this work, we characterized the pH-dependent interactions of pancreatic acinar cell-regulated secretory proteins (zymogens) with Muclin, a putative Golgi cargo receptor. In solution, purified Muclin co-aggregated with isolated zymogens at mildly acidic pH. In an overlay assay, [35S]sulfate biosynthetically labeled Muclin bound directly at mildly acidic pH to the zymogen granule content proteins amylase, prolipase, pro-carboxypeptidase A1, pro-elastase II, chymotrypsinogen B, and Reg1. Denaturation of Muclin with reducing agents to break the numerous intrachain disulfide bonds in Muclin's scavenger receptor cysteine-rich and CUB domains did not interfere with binding. Non-sulfated [35S]Met/Cys-labeled Muclin showed decreased binding in the overlay assay. Extensive Pronase E digestion of unlabeled Muclin was used to produce glycopeptides, which competed for binding of [35S]sulfate-labeled Muclin to zymogens. The results demonstrate that the sulfated, O-glycosylated groups are responsible for the pH-dependent interactions of Muclin with the zymogens.

The behavior of Muclin fulfils the requirement of a Golgi cargo receptor to bind to regulated secretory proteins under the mildly acidic pH conditions that exist in the trans-Golgi network. All eukaryotic cells synthesize and transport both membrane and soluble proteins through the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi complex to the cell surface, where they are delivered by unregulated exocytosis, a process called constitutive secretion (1Kelly R.B. Science. 1985; 230: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). Some cells also have the capacity to store proteins in secretory granules, which are exocytosed upon neural or hormonal stimulation of the cell, and this is called the regulated secretory pathway (1Kelly R.B. Science. 1985; 230: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). Sorting and packaging of proteins in the regulated pathway involves protein selection at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) 1The abbreviations used are: TGN, trans-Golgi network; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; ZGC, zymogen granule contents; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; PNA, peanut agglutinin; CRP, cyclic AMP receptor protein; CUB, complement components C1r/C1s, Urchin EGF, and bone morphogenic protein-1. (sorting-for-entry) as well as removal of residual lysosomal enzymes and constitutively secreted proteins during post-Golgi maturation of secretory granules (sorting-by-retention) (for review, see Ref. 2Arvan P. Zhang B.Y. Feng L.J. Liu M. Kuliawat R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The underlying process operating in the regulated secretory pathway is the aggregation of regulated proteins, which excludes constitutively secreted proteins. Protein aggregation in the secretory pathway relies on a variety of mechanisms for interaction of regulated proteins. The most widespread mechanism is the pH-dependent aggregation of regulated proteins in the TGN, which has a pH of about 6.0 (3Orci L. Ravazzola M. Anderson R.G.W. Nature. 1987; 326: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To complete the process of granule formation and keep the content proteins aggregated, secretory granules are either mildly acidified (pancreatic zymogen granules, pH ∼6–6.5 (4Gasser K.W. DiDomenico J. Hopfer U. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: C705-C711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) or moderately acidified (neuroendocrine granules, pH ∼5 (5Anderson R.G.W. Orci L. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar)). Regulated protein storage in some cells also relies on calcium, which is at millimolar concentrations in the secretory pathway compared with submicromolar levels in the cytosol (6Colomer V. Kicska G.A. Rindler M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 48-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Despite understanding these processes in a general way, the details of packaging of regulated secretory proteins are not well understood. The major protein of the pancreatic zymogen granule is amylase, and although this enzyme co-aggregates with other zymogens, it does not self-aggregate at mildly acidic pH (7Gorr S.U. Tseng S.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 8Jacob M. Laine J. LeBel D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 70: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Amylase was shown to associate with an SH3 binding domain of the soluble rat zymogen granule protein ZG29p (9Kleene R. Classen B. Zdzieblo J. Schrader M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9893-9900Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that amylase can interact with N-glycosylated proteins (10Matsushita H. Takenaka M. Ogawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4680-4686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Whether either of these components exists in sufficient amounts in the secretory pathway to account for amylase sorting is unknown. Sulfated proteoglycans and glycoproteins are also likely to be involved in protein packaging in zymogen granules (11De Lisle R.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2941-2952PubMed Google Scholar, 12Biederbick A. Licht A. Kleene R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 82: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 13Schmidt K. Dartsch H. Linder D. Kern H.F. Kleene R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2233-2242PubMed Google Scholar), but the nature of these interactions is not known. We previously showed that zymogen granule formation in mouse acinar cells requires O-glycosylation as well as sulfation (11De Lisle R.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2941-2952PubMed Google Scholar). When sulfation was inhibited, regulated protein secretion was not inhibited but newly formed granules were large and poorly condensed. When O-glycosylation was blocked, both regulated and constitutive secretion were strongly inhibited. These results suggest important roles for sulfated O-linked oligosaccharides in the secretory pathway. A candidate for mediating these interactions is pro-Muclin, a type I membrane protein that is the precursor to mature Muclin, the major O-glycosylated protein as well as the major sulfated macromolecule of the acinar cell (14De Lisle R.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 56: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Because the inhibitors used in the previous studies target all sulfated and O-glycosylated proteins, they cannot show whether pro-Muclin is central to these processes. In the current work, we studied the interactions of purified Muclin with isolated zymogens and show that the sulfated, O-linked oligosaccharides of Muclin interact with purified zymogens in a pH-dependent manner. Preparation of Pancreatic Acini and Radiolabeling of Muclin—Pancreatic acini were prepared from mouse pancreas (20–25 g male ND4 mice, Swiss Webster strain; Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) by digestion with purified collagenase (Worthington, Freehold, NJ) as described previously (11De Lisle R.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2941-2952PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare [35S]sulfate-labeled Muclin, acini were suspended in HEPES-buffered Ringer's solution and biosynthetically labeled for 2.5 h in the presence of 0.5 mCi/ml [35S]sulfate (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA). For other experiments, control and non-sulfated [35S]Met/Cys-labeled Muclin fractions were prepared. Acini were preincubated for 1 h in buffer supplemented with 30 mm sodium chloride (control) or 30 mm sodium chlorate to deplete cellular pools of the high-energy sulfate donor 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (11De Lisle R.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2941-2952PubMed Google Scholar, 15Baeuerle P.A. Huttner W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1986; 141: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). In the continued presence of NaCl or chlorate, the cells were incubated for 30 min in Met/Cys-free medium (Sigma) to deplete cellular pools of these amino acids followed by 30-min pulse-labeling with 1 mCi of [35S]Met/Cys (TranSLabel; ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) and chasing in medium containing excess unlabeled amino acids for 2 h to allow biosynthetic maturation of Muclin. Purification of Muclin by Preparative SDS-PAGE—Acini were solubilized with a probe-type sonicator in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (without reducing agent) and run on a PrepCell following the manufacturer's instructions (model 491; Bio-Rad). Initial experiments showed that Muclin migrated to an RF of 0.5–0.6 on a 3% acrylamide/0.5% agarose separating gel, so this gel composition was used in the PrepCell to optimize resolution of Muclin from other cell proteins. Elution was carried out with 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate at a flow rate of 42 ml/h. This buffer matched the conductivity of Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE running buffer, which was used in the outer chamber of the PrepCell, and allowed concentration of the collected fractions by lyophilization. After the bromphenol blue dye front was eluted, the gel run was continued, and 95 × 2.5 ml fractions were collected. Unlabeled Muclin in PrepCell fractions was detected by immuno-dot blot (16De Lisle R.C. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) with a Muclin-specific antiserum (14De Lisle R.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 56: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). 35S-labeled Muclin was detected in the fractions by liquid scintillation counting. The specific activity of [35S]sulfate-labeled Muclin was about 1.7 × 105 cpm/μg of protein. Muclin-positive fractions were pooled, lyophilized, and dissolved in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MES, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, and then dialyzed against the same buffer for 48 h at 4 °C. Control and non-sulfated [35S]Met/Cys-labeled Muclin fractions were purified in the same manner. To prepare Muclin for aggregation assays, the buffer was exchanged to 0.1 m NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, and 0.02% NaN3, and protein was concentrated by centrifugation in a 10-kDa cutoff Amicon Ultra-15 filter device (Fisher Scientific). Preparation of Zymogen Granule Contents and Muclin Interaction Assays—Zymogen granules were isolated from mouse pancreas on a self-forming density gradient of 40% Percoll (Sigma) as described previously (17De Lisle R.C. Schulz I. Tyrakowski T. Haase W. Hopfer U. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: G411-G418PubMed Google Scholar). Granules were osmotically lysed to release soluble content proteins using the cation exchange ionophore nigericin (27 μg/ml) in 150 mm sodium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, containing protease inhibitors (pefabloc-SC, benzamidine, pepstatin A, leupeptin) as described previously (14De Lisle R.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 56: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Soluble zymogen granule contents (ZGC) were then isolated by ultracentrifugation at 200,000 × g for 60 min, followed by buffer exchange and protein concentration into 50 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm MES, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, with a 10-kDa cutoff Amicon Ultra-15 filter device. The pH-dependent ZGC aggregation assay was carried out as described previously (11De Lisle R.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2941-2952PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 50 μg of ZGC in 250 μl of the above buffer was adjusted to pH 6.0 or left at pH 8.0, incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and pelleted at 16,000 × g for 15 min. The pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE or liquid scintillation counting when 35S-labeled Muclin was used. For the Muclin overlay assay, isolated ZGC (10 μg/lane) were separated on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and transferred to PVDF. The PVDF with separated ZGC was cut into strips that were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h. The strips were then rinsed with 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MES, and 5 mm HEPES buffer at either pH 8.0 or 6.0 followed by incubation with 2–5 × 105 cpm [35S]sulfate-labeled Muclin for 1 h in the same pH buffers. After rinsing three times for 2 min each with appropriate buffers, the strips were dried and subjected to filmless autoradiographic analysis (Cyclone Storage Phosphor System; Perkin Elmer, Downers Grove, IL) for 4–7 days. As another approach to investigate Muclin interactions with zymogens, purified Muclin was bound and cross-linked to peanut agglutinin (PNA) agarose beads (Sigma). Approximately 300 μg of purified Muclin was bound to 250 μl of PNA-beads and cross-linked using 0.4% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Reactive sites were quenched with 0.2 m lysine, and Muclin-PNA-beads were stored in 0.05% Triton X-100, phosphate-buffered saline, and 0.02% NaN3 at 4 °C. Muclin-PNA-agarose (20-μl packed bead volume containing about 8 μg of Muclin) was mixed with ZGC at either pH 8.0 or 6.0 in the same buffers used for the aggregation assay. Binding was carried out in a 250-μl final volume with 50 μg of ZGC for 15 min at room temperature. The beads were washed three times at the appropriate pH by centrifugation at 2,000 × g, at which speed ZGC aggregates were not appreciably pelleted. Cross-linked 4% beaded agarose (Sepharose CL-4B; Sigma) was used as a control. The bound proteins were released from the beads with 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol and analyzed on SDS-PAGE. Preparation of Unlabeled and 35S-labeled Glycopeptides from Muclin—Unlabeled or [35S]sulfate-labeled Muclin was dissolved in 25 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.8, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, and digested with 1 mg of Pronase E (Sigma) for 24 h at 37 °C followed by heating for 20 min at 70 °C to inactivate Pronase (18Cummings R.D. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1993Google Scholar). Before use, the Pronase was incubated 60 min at 37 °C to allow proteolytic destruction of potential contaminating carbohydrate-degrading enzymes. The digested material was fractionated by gel filtration on a 0.5-cm2 × 50-cm column of Bio-Gel P-10, fine (Bio-Rad) and eluted at flow rate of 6 ml/h with 0.1 m NH4HCO3, pH 8.0, and 0.02% NaN3. Fractions of 1 ml each were collected and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting for the presence of [35S]sulfate glycopeptides, which were pooled and lyophilized. The same fractions of Pronase E digested unlabeled Muclin were pooled and used as unlabeled glycopeptides. Other Techniques—Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216334) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad reagent and bovine serum albumin as the standard. For protein identification, ZGC were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the bands of interest were excised from the Coomassie blue-stained gels. The samples were submitted to the University of Kansas Biochemical Research Service Laboratory (Lawrence, KS) for tryptic digestion and mass spectrometry analysis. For proteins that could not be identified by mass spectrometry, ZGC were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF, and Coomassie blue-stained bands were submitted for N-terminal sequencing to the Molecular Biology Resource Facility at the William K. Warren Medical Research Institute (Oklahoma City, OK). Isolated glycopeptides were also submitted for amino acid analysis. Because the glycopeptides contain significant levels of hexosamines, a separate run was performed at elevated pH to resolve hexosamines from the amino acids and allow correction of the data. Glycine had a high signal, presumably because of Tris-glycine used in the gel running and transfer buffers, and was omitted from the analysis. This work explores the ability of the putative Golgi cargo receptor pro-Muclin to bind to pancreatic zymogens in a pH-dependent manner. pro-Muclin is a type I membrane protein that has a signal peptide that directs the nascent protein to the rough endoplasmic reticulum lumen (20De Lisle R.C. Ziemer D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 892-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). As the protein traffics through the secretory pathway, it acquires both N- and O-linked oligosaccharides (14De Lisle R.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 56: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The O-linked oligosaccharides become heavily sulfated in the TGN, where it is proposed that the sulfates interact electrostatically with the zymogens at the mildly acidic pH in the TGN lumen (11De Lisle R.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2941-2952PubMed Google Scholar, 20De Lisle R.C. Ziemer D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 892-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Once the immature granule forms from the TGN, pro-Muclin is proteolytically cleaved, and mature Muclin remains in the regulated pathway complexed with secretory proteins in the zymogen granule (20De Lisle R.C. Ziemer D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 892-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The other portion, an 80-kDa type I membrane protein called apactin, is targeted to the actin-rich apical membrane of the acinar cell (20De Lisle R.C. Ziemer D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 892-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 21Tandon C. De Lisle R.C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Because pro-Muclin is a membrane protein and exists at relatively low levels in the acinar cell, we purified the more abundant mature Muclin for these studies. Muclin was shown experimentally to be heavily sulfated on O-linked oligosaccharides (14De Lisle R.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 56: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Using the NetOGlyc algorithm (Ref. 22Hansen J.E. Lund O. Tolstrup N. Gooley A.A. Williams K.L. Brunak S. Glycoconjugate J. 1998; 15: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar; www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetOGlyc/) there are many predicted sites for O-glycosylation in mature Muclin (Fig. 1A). These sites include six so-called CRP domains (23Cheng H. Bjerknes M. Chen H.Y. Anat. Rec. 1996; 244: 327-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), a Thr-rich domain, and a Thr-Pro-rich domain (Fig. 1, B–D). Muclin was purified from isolated pancreatic acini on a preparative SDS-PAGE system (Bio-Rad PrepCell). Immunoreactive Muclin eluted off the preparative gel between fractions 54–74, as shown by dot-blot and Western blot (Fig. 2, A and B, respectively). Because of its unique size (∼300 kDa) among acinar cell proteins, Muclin elutes as an essentially pure protein as shown by Coomassie blue staining of the PrepCell fractions (Fig. 2D). To prepare a sensitive probe for these studies, pancreatic acini were incubated with carrier-free [35S]sulfate to biosynthetically label Muclin. As shown in Fig. 2C, [35S]sulfate-labeled Muclin eluted at the same position as unlabeled Muclin (Fig. 2A). Muclin comprises approximately one half of the incorporated label and is completely separated from other sulfated cell proteins that elute with the tracking dye front; the front was allowed to run off the gel before the fraction collector was started. Purified [35S]sulfate-labeled Muclin was used in the pH-dependent in vitro aggregation assay previously used with unlabeled Muclin (11De Lisle R.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2941-2952PubMed Google Scholar). This entails mixing purified ZGC at pH 8.0 or 6.0, followed by pelleting the large aggregates in a microcentrifuge. Labeled Muclin efficiently co-aggregates with purified ZGC at pH 6.0 but not at pH 8.0 (Fig. 3). [35S]sulfate-labeled Muclin in the absence of ZGC does not self-aggregate at mildly acidic pH (Fig. 3). As a negative control, [35S]sulfate-labeled Muclin was mixed with chicken ovalbumin or bovine serum albumin at pH 8.0 and 6.0. As shown in Fig. 3, Muclin does not aggregate with either of these proteins, which by themselves also do not aggregate [(11De Lisle R.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2941-2952PubMed Google Scholar) and data not shown]. These results are consistent with previous work using unlabeled Muclin (11De Lisle R.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2941-2952PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether we could identify individual Muclin-binding partners among the ZGC proteins, an overlay assay was used. Isolated ZGC were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF. After blocking the membrane with bovine serum albumin (a constitutively secreted protein), [35S]sulfate-labeled Muclin was overlaid on the PVDF at pH 8.0 or 6.0. Labeled Muclin binding to six distinct protein bands was enhanced at pH 6.0 compared with pH 8.0 (Fig. 4A). By mass spectrometry of trypsin-digested proteins and N-terminal sequence analysis, the six binding partners for Muclin were identified: the digestive enzymes amylase, pro-lipase, pro-carboxypeptidase A1, pro-elastase II, and chymotrypsinogen B and a pancreatic stress protein called Reg1 (24Bimmler D. Schiesser M. Perren A. Scheele G. Angst E. Meili S. Ammann R. Graf R. J. Surg. Res. 2004; 118: 122-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4B). The pH-dependent binding was highly reproducible, and the increased binding at pH 6.0 compared with pH 8.0 ranged from about 2.5-fold for pro-carboxypeptidase A1, proelastase II, and chymotrypsinogen B and 2.9-fold for Reg1 to 3.6-fold for amylase and pro-lipase (Fig. 4C). As controls for the overlay assay, [35S]sulfate-labeled Muclin was also overlaid at pH 8.0 and 6.0 on PVDF membranes containing whole pancreatic or liver homogenates, or just bovine serum albumin. When overlaid on whole pancreatic homogenates, the predominant bands at pH 6.0 were the zymogens identified above (Fig. 5A). Additional bands were observed at about 100, 42, 26–27, and <20 kDa (Fig. 5A). There was no binding at either pH 8.0 or 6.0 when a large amount (5 μg) of bovine serum albumin was separated and transferred to PVDF (Fig. 5B). On total liver homogenates, there were only two weakly binding bands at about 116 and 30 kDa (Fig. 5B). These results show that Muclin binding in the overlay assay is fairly specific for pancreatic proteins, especially those stored in zymogen granules. Muclin is composed of scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domains interspersed with CRP domains, and CUB domains at its carboxyl terminus (Fig. 1A). The scavenger receptor cysteine-rich and CUB domains are globular structures with multiple intrachain disulfide bonds in each domain (25Hohenester E. Sasaki T. Timpl R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 26Feinberg H. Uitdehaag J.C.M. Davies J.M. Wallis R. Drickamer K. Weis W.I. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2348-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The presence of intrachain disulfide bonds in Muclin was previously demonstrated by its decreased mobility on SDS-PAGE after treatment with a reducing agent (14De Lisle R.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 56: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To test whether the acidic pH-dependent binding of Muclin to zymogens is sensitive to the protein conformation, we performed the overlay assay in the presence of a reducing agent (Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine) to disrupt the numerous disulfide bonds. Reduction of Muclin had no effect on binding to ZGC proteins (Fig. 6), indicating that the structure of the peptide is unimportant in binding of Muclin to ZGC proteins. This result is consistent with the proposal that the carbohydrate portion of Muclin is responsible for its association with ZGC proteins (11De Lisle R.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2941-2952PubMed Google Scholar, 20De Lisle R.C. Ziemer D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 892-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). As an independent assay of pH-dependent interactions of Muclin with ZGC, Muclin was immobilized to agarose beads to use as a solid phase that could be separated from unbound zymogens at low centrifugal force. We took advantage of the fact that Muclin can be quantitatively bound to the lectin PNA (11De Lisle R.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2941-2952PubMed Google Scholar), and we cross-linked Muclin to PNA agarose beads. When incubated with ZGC, a similar pattern of zymogens bound to agarose bead-immobilized Muclin was observed compared with the aggregation assay (Fig. 7). Binding to bead-immobilized Muclin was also pH-dependent with increased binding at pH 6.0 over pH 8.0 of amylase (1.5-fold), pro-carboxypeptidase A1 (3-fold), pro-elastase II (2-fold), and Reg1 (2-fold). Unlike the aggregation assay, there was not appreciably more binding of pro-lipase or chymotrypsinogen B to bead-immobilized Muclin (Fig. 7). The patterns of ZGC that aggregate at acidic pH and also bind to immobilized Muclin are similar to that obtained in the Muclin overlay assay, except that one band of about 74 kDa present in the former assays is not observed in the Muclin overlay assay (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, pro-elastase is bound in the overlay assay (Fig. 4A) and to bead-immobilized Muclin but does not show pH-dependent aggregation (Fig. 7). Binding to unconjugated agarose beads was minimal and also shows that insignificant amounts of ZGC were pelleted at the low centrifugal force used to wash the beads (Fig. 7). To test whether the oligosaccharides on Muclin mediate its binding to ZGC proteins, purified [35S]sulfate-labeled Muclin was reduced and extensively digested with the broad-specificity protease mixture Pronase E to prepare labeled glycopeptides (18Cummings R.D. Fukuda M. Kobata A. Glycobiology: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1993Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8A, after digestion of labeled Muclin, no bands were visible by Coomassie blue staining on either 7.5 or 15% acrylamide gels, demonstrating the effective degradation of the protein. Nevertheless, there was a peak of 35S radioactivity and a band of about 21 kDa on the gel by filmless autoradiographic analysis (Fig. 8A). Lack of Coomassie blue staining of the glycopeptides may be a result of their high carbohydrate content. The 35S-labeled glycopeptides were separated from small digestion products by gel filtration (Fig. 8B). Amino acid analysis of the isolated glycopeptides was performed and compared with the predicted O-glycosylated domains of Muclin. Because it is not known exactly where the Pronase mixture would cleave the peptide backbone and how many amino acids near O-glycosylated sites would be protected from the proteases, we evaluated several possibilities: the entire domains shown in Fig. 1A would be Pronase-resistant compared with only 1, 2, or 3 amino acids flanking each predicted O-glycosylated Ser and Thr being protected. The best fit to the measured amino acid composition occurred when it was modeled that the three amino acids flanking these sites would be protected from protease digestion (Fig. 8C). The ability of the [35S]sulfate-labeled, Muclin-derived glycopeptides to co-aggregate with ZGC was tested and there was significant co-aggregation at pH 6.0 compared with pH 8.0 (Fig. 8D). The [35S]sulfate-labeled glycopeptides also bound to ZGC in the overlay assay at pH 6.0 (Fig. 8E), but the amount bound was reduced compared with intact labeled Muclin (Fig. 4A). A possible explanation for weaker pH-dependent binding of glycopeptides may be that the several sulfated, O-glycosylated domains in an intact Muclin molecule exhibit cooperativity that increases the affinity of binding. To test this in another way, glycopeptides were prepared from unlabeled Muclin and used as a competitor for [35S]sulfate-labeled intact Muclin in the overlay assay. When ∼100-fold excess unlabeled glycopeptides were added to [35S]sulfate-labeled Muclin in the overlay assay, binding at pH 6.0 was abolished (Fig. 9B) compared with control (Fig. 9A). As a more direct test of whether the sulfate groups are important for association of Muclin with zymogens, [35S]Met-Cys-labeled control and non-sulfated Muclin were prepared. Non-sulfated Muclin was prepared by radiolabeling acini in the presence of sodium chlorate, which is a competitive inhibitor of ATP-sulfurylase, a key enzyme in biosynthesis of the high-energy sulfate donor 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (15Baeuerle P.A. Huttner W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1986; 141: 870-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Using the overlay assay, binding of non-sulfated Muclin at pH 6.0 was reduced 40–60% for the different zymogens compared with control sulfated Muclin (Fig. 10). Thus, the sulfated, O-glycosylated domains of Muclin are at least partly responsible for its pH-dependent association with ZGC proteins. In this work, we explored the interactions of Muclin with isolated pancreatic zymogens to test the proposal that pro-Muclin serves as a Golgi cargo receptor in the regulated secretory pathway of the pancreatic acinar cell. Three different assays were used to investigate the pH-dependent interactions of Muclin with pancreatic zymogen granule contents: a solution phase assay, in which both both Muclin and ZGC were used as soluble proteins; an overlay of Muclin on ZGC immobilized to PVDF membranes; and binding of soluble ZGC to Muclin immobilized to PNA-agarose beads. There were some minor difference in the ZGC proteins that associated with Muclin in the different assays; overall, however, the patterns of bound proteins were similar. In addition, Muclin bound only weakly to two proteins in total liver homogenates, showing Muclin's specificity for binding to pancreatic proteins. When non-sulfated Muclin was compared with control sulfated Muclin in the overlay assay of ZGC, there was a reduction of 40–60% compared with sulfated Muclin, demonstrating that the majority of pH-dependent Muclin binding to zymogens involves its sulfate groups. The remaining binding may be mediated by sialic acid residues, which are also present on Muclin (14De Lisle R.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 56: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The results demonstrate that the sulfated O-glycosylated domains of Muclin are responsible for Muclin's ability to bind to several of the protein species in the zymogen granule content in a pH-dependent manner. These data support the idea that pro-Muclin is a Golgi cargo receptor. In the pancreatic acinar cell, regulated secretory protein concentration begins in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (27Oprins A. Rabouille C. Posthuma G. Klumperman J. Geuze H.J. Slot J.W. Traffic. 2001; 2: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and small aggregates of regulated secretory proteins exist at pH 7.5 (28Kleene R. Kastner B. Rosser R. Kern H. Digestion. 1999; 60: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Protein concentration continues in the TGN and secretory granule. The TGN process can be mimicked in vitro by mildly acidifying isolated zymogens to match the pH of the TGN lumen (3Orci L. Ravazzola M. Anderson R.G.W. Nature. 1987; 326: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and ZGC aggregates become large enough to pellet in a microcentrifuge at pH 6 or lower (29Dartsch H. Kleene R. Kern H.F. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The major regulated protein in the pancreatic acinar cell is amylase, which comprises 20 to 30% of the total zymogen granule protein (30Scheele G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5375-5385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several zymogens, including amylase, do not undergo individual homotypic aggregation at mildly acidic pH, and they aggregate only when mixed together (7Gorr S.U. Tseng S.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The minimal protein composition required for zymogen aggregation at acidic pH is unknown. Also unknown is how the aggregated proteins are targeted to a patch of TGN membrane to form the secretory granule and whether this process requires a membrane protein that serves as a cargo receptor for the regulated secretory pathway at the TGN. A possible mechanism for inclusion of amylase with other sorted proteins is that amylase can bind to N-linked glycoproteins in a pH- and Ca2+-dependent manner (10Matsushita H. Takenaka M. Ogawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4680-4686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although this association could explain amylase's ability to be sorted, identification of specific N-glycoprotein binding partners in the granule has not been made. It has also been shown that amylase interacts with the soluble rat zymogen granule protein ZG29p (9Kleene R. Classen B. Zdzieblo J. Schrader M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9893-9900Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This interaction occurs through an SH3 binding domain on ZG29p, and it was suggested that ZG29p is an accessory protein in aggregation of proteins in the acinar cell-regulated pathway. In neither of these examples has it been shown how the aggregates are linked to the TGN membrane. It has been convincingly demonstrated in endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi traffic that the p24 family of membrane proteins acts as cargo receptors (for review, see Ref. 31Barlowe C. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 295-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar]. The p24 proteins bind content proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen and recruit coat-forming proteins to the cytosolic face of the membrane, which results in vesicle formation. For regulated secretory granule formation in neuroendocrine cells, the prohormone processing enzyme carboxypeptidase E (CPE) has been shown to act as a cargo receptor (32Loh Y.P. Kim T. Rodriguez Y.M. Cawley N.X. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2004; 22: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). CPE is a membrane protein that associates with the cargo pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) through a pair of acidic residues and a pair of hydrophobic residues (33Loh Y.P. Maldonado A. Zhang C. Tam W.H. Cawley N. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 971: 416-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In the Cpe(fat)/Cpe(fat) mouse, which has a mutated CPE gene, granule formation is impaired and regulated proteins are constitutively released (34Cool D.R. Normant E. Shen F.S. Chen H.C. Pannell L. Zhang Y. Loh Y.P. Cell. 1997; 88: 73-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 35Cawley N.X. Rodriguez Y.M. Maldonado A. Loh Y.P. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether a membrane protein cargo receptor exists in the exocrine pancreas. Several models for ZGC aggregation and sorting have been advanced. It was proposed that a submembrane proteoglycan matrix in the rat granule mediates association of zymogens with the membrane (13Schmidt K. Dartsch H. Linder D. Kern H.F. Kleene R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2233-2242PubMed Google Scholar), but it remains to be shown how the proteoglycans associate with the membrane. There is also recent evidence for association of granule membrane components with lipid rafts that may serve as a sorting mechanism at the TGN (36Kalus I. Hodel A. Koch A. Kleene R. Edwardson J.M. Schrader M. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but the protein composition of such lipid rafts is not well defined at this point, and a specific membrane protein that serves as a cargo receptor has not been identified. An alternative proposal is that a membrane protein cargo receptor is unnecessary because zymogens may bind directly to lipid membrane (37Laine J. LeBel D. Biochem. J. 1999; 338 (Pt 2): 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A drawback to this idea is that it does not explain how needed membrane proteins, such as soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors and rab GTPases, would be selected for inclusion in the granule. Much of the work done on the problem of ZGC aggregation and sorting has focused on the mechanism of aggregation and identification of soluble proteins that may assist the aggregation process. A role for sulfated macromolecules in zymogen granule formation is attractive because their fixed negative charge makes them good candidates for the pH-dependent sorting/aggregation process. There seem to be species differences in that guinea pigs and rats have sulfated glycosaminoglycans as components of their zymogen granules (13Schmidt K. Dartsch H. Linder D. Kern H.F. Kleene R. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2233-2242PubMed Google Scholar, 38Reggio H.A. Palade G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 77: 288-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), whereas mice have mostly sulfated O-glycans (14De Lisle R.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 56: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Inhibition of glycosaminoglycan synthesis in rat acinar cells with p-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside inhibits sorting of the proteoglycan serglycin as well as amylase and procarboxypeptidase A to granules (12Biederbick A. Licht A. Kleene R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 82: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We have shown in the mouse pancreas that inhibition of sulfation with sodium chlorate or O-glycosylation with benzyl-N-acetyl-α-galactosaminide inhibits normal zymogen granule formation (11De Lisle R.C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2941-2952PubMed Google Scholar). The best candidate sulfated macromolecule in the mouse pancreas is Muclin, the major sulfated, O-glycosylated protein of the mouse pancreas. Muclin is a major acinar cell protein, comprising approximately 2% of the total pancreatic protein and 6–8% of the zymogen granule protein (39De Lisle R.C. Petitt M. Huff J. Isom K.S. Agbas A. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 521-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Muclin is derived from the type I membrane protein pro-Muclin by proteolytic cleavage in a post-Golgi compartment (immature secretory granule) (20De Lisle R.C. Ziemer D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 892-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Our model is that pro-Muclin becomes heavily sulfated when it reaches the TGN, where it will associate with the aggregating granule content proteins in the acidic environment of the TGN lumen. Because it is a membrane protein at the TGN, pro-Muclin binding to zymogens will also link them to the TGN membrane. This is important because it will allow the regulated protein aggregate to be associated with a patch of membrane that contains the needed proteins to form a functional regulated secretory granule (e.g. soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors, rabs, etc.). The presence of sulfated O-linked oligosaccharides along the length of Muclin provides numerous sites for pH-dependent electrostatic interactions with aggregating zymogens. Muclin's sulfates will be negatively charged at any physiological pH, whereas the zymogens will be protonated at the acidic pH of the TGN/secretory granule and will lose their charge upon exocytosis into the alkaline environment of the acinar lumen allowing solubilization and release of the zymogens (40Freedman S.D. Scheele G.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 992-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It remains to be shown whether the 16-amino acid cytosolic carboxyl tail of pro-Muclin can recruit coat proteins or somehow induce formation of an immature zymogen granule. Some previous data indicate that the cytosolic tail is important for trafficking of pro-Muclin to zymogen-like granules in the pancreatic cell line AR42J (20De Lisle R.C. Ziemer D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 892-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Other recent data using fusion peptides of the cytosolic tail with a TAT-protein transduction domain to attempt to interfere with the function of the endogenous cytosolic domain had no effect on granule formation or regulated protein trafficking (21Tandon C. De Lisle R.C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The work presented here shows that Muclin satisfies one requirement of a Golgi cargo receptor, which is to interact with cargo (zymogens) under conditions that exist in the TGN. It remains to be determined whether pro-Muclin satisfies the second requirement of a cargo receptor, which is the ability to recruit coat-forming proteins to induce granule formation."
https://openalex.org/W2147001553,"A dramatic increase in obesity prevalence and cardiovascular morbidity is expected for the coming years. However, with relevance to the heart, little is known about the specific contribution of obesity on associated morbidity. Consequently, global analysis of gene regulations in human heart was undertaken to monitor molecular regulations related to obesity or to obesity-related hypertension. Transcriptome analysis using cDNA arrays was performed in right appendage biopsies from obese patients (n=5), from patients with arterial hypertension with (n=5) or without obesity (n=5), and from 5 leans. All biopsies came from patients that had cardiac surgery and coronary bypass. Statistical analysis of the data revealed 2686 differentially expressed genes out of 11,500 when compared with lean tissues. Differential expression was verified by real-time PCR in 84% of 50 randomly chosen genes. Among genes encountered, 397 were specifically regulated in obese, 1,299 in non-obese hypertensive, and 355 in obese hypertensive patients, respectively, whereas an additional set of 153 genes was differentially expressed in all these situations. Ontology analysis, hierarchical clustering, and molecular pathway analysis indicated that the heart molecular picture of obesity differs clearly from that observed for obesity-related hypertension or arterial hypertension. Clearly, the Wnt pathway known to be involved in cardiac hypertrophy mechanisms, showed opposite regulation in obese heart compared with hypertensive heart and potentially prevented the development of cardiac remodeling in obese patients. All over, this work shows that uncomplicated obesity has a strong impact on cardiac gene expression, which could be considered as precursor signs for future cardiac disease and also demonstrates that obesity-related hypertension generates a heart-molecular-distinct phenotype that cannot be predicted by a simple sum of the impact of obesity and arterial hypertension on gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1976415472,"In sporulating cells of Bacillus subtilis, the serine peptidase SpoIVB is the essential component of a transmembrane signaling cascade between the two intracellular compartments (forespore and mother cell) that leads to activation of the σK transcription factor in the mother cell chamber. This regulatory process, referred to as the σK checkpoint, is essential for ensuring proper development of the spore and introduces an appropriate level of fidelity to the developmental process. This work unravels the signaling process and establishes how SpoIVB interacts with other protein partners in the σK checkpoint. SpoIVB is synthesized as a zymogen that is autoproteolytically activated and carries a PDZ domain that is responsible for at least three distinct binding reactions, a phenomenon not previously demonstrated for an individual PDZ domain. First, binding to the SpoIVB NH2 terminus to maintain the protein in its zymogen form. Second, following secretion across a spore membrane, binding in trans to the COOH terminus of another SpoIVB molecule. Binding in trans facilitates the first cleavage event of SpoIVB near the NH2 terminus releasing it from the inner forespore membrane. We show that at least two further cis cleavage events occur at specific sites near the NH2 terminus after which the PDZ domain targets SpoIVB to the pro-σK processing complex in the outer forespore membrane. Specifically, SpoIVB binds to the COOH terminus of BofA. In turn, this allows SpoIVB to cleave the COOH terminus of SpoIVFA an event pivotal to activating the SpoIVFB zinc metalloprotease by disruption of the heteroligomeric pro-σK complex.

In turn, this allows SpoIVB to cleave the COOH terminus of SpoIVFA an event pivotal to activating the SpoIVFB zinc metalloprotease by disruption of the heteroligomeric pro-σK complex. Spore formation in Bacillus subtilis is a highly coordinated process relying on differential gene expression being tightly coupled with morphogenesis. Minor errors in the activation of gene expression orchestrated by any one of the five sporulation-specific sigma factors (σ) can have catastrophic consequences on the completion of sporulation (1Losick R. Stragier P. Nature. 1992; 355: 601-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 2Losick R. Shapiro L. Science. 1993; 262: 1227-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A notable example is the activation of the transcription factor, σK, in the mother cell chamber of the sporulating cell in what is referred to as the “σK checkpoint.” The σK-regulon is involved in the final stages of spore maturation including spore coat biosynthesis and release of the spore from the sporangial cell. σK is made in an immature (proprotein) form known as pro-σK and is activated by proteolytic cleavage of its amino-terminal (pro) leader sequence (3Cutting S. Oke V. Driks A. Losick R. Lu S. Kroos L. Cell. 1990; 62: 239-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 4Lu S. Halberg R. Kroos L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9722-9726Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Processing of pro-σK must occur at a precise time because premature activation of σK by as little as 30 min leads to aberrant spore formation (3Cutting S. Oke V. Driks A. Losick R. Lu S. Kroos L. Cell. 1990; 62: 239-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Pro-σK has been shown to interact with the outer forespore membrane (OFM) 1The abbreviations used are: OFM, outer forespore membrane; IFM, inner forespore membrane; ORF, open reading frame; GST, glutathione S-transferase.1The abbreviations used are: OFM, outer forespore membrane; IFM, inner forespore membrane; ORF, open reading frame; GST, glutathione S-transferase. in which is embedded a processing complex consisting of three polypeptides, SpoIVFB, SpoIVFA, and BofA (5Cutting S. Roels S. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1237-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 6Ricca E. Cutting S. Losick R. J.

Extensive cytological as well as biochemical analysis has recently shown that SpoIVFA, SpoIVFB, and BofA exist in a multimeric complex in the OFM (8Rudner D.Z. Losick R. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1007-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). SpoIVFB has been identified as the zinc-metalloprotease that cleaves pro-σK and is anchored in the OFM by three transmembrane loops (9Green D.H. Wakeley P.R. Page A. Barnes A. Baccigalupi L. Ricca E. Cutting S.M. Appl. Env. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 4288-4291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Rudner D.Z. Fawcett P. Losick R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3305-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and belongs to a new family of membrane-embedded metalloproteases whose active sites lie at the membrane interface (10Rudner D.Z. Fawcett P. Losick R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14765-14770Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 11Lewis A.P. Thomas P.J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Genetic experiments have shown that SpoIVFA and BofA negatively regulate the activity of SpoIVFB because mutations that disrupt the COOH termini of both SpoIVFA (bofB mutations) and BofA (bofA) allow constitutive processing of pro-σK (5Cutting S. Roels S. Losick R. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1237-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 6Ricca E. Cutting S. Losick R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3177-3184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several models for how SpoIVFA and BofA might regulate SpoIVFB activity have been proposed but only recently has sufficient evidence validated a working mode1 (8Rudner D.Z. Losick R. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1007-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These studies have shown first, that SpoIVFA plays a central role in assembling the pro-σK processing complex by serving as a platform for bringing BofA and SpoIVFB together as a heteroligomeric complex. Second, in this “tethered” state BofA inhibits the SpoIVFB processing enzyme, probably through a direct interaction, until the appropriate forespore signal is received that disrupts the processing complex. Finally, the COOH terminus of SpoIVFA that is exposed to the intramembrane space between the inner forespore membrane (IFM) and OFM is important for recruiting BofA because bofB mutations at the COOH-terminal tip of SpoIVFA prevent proper localization of BofA in the membrane. Signaling of SpoIVFB-controlled processing, however, is mediated exclusively by SpoIVB, which is made in the opposed forespore chamber (13Gomez M. Cutting S. Stragier P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4825-4827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its gene, spoIVB, is initially expressed under the control of RNA polymerase associated with σF (EσF) but is subsequently transcribed in earnest under EσG control (14Gomez M. Cutting S.M. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 3453-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). SpoIVB has been studied extensively and offers important insights into intercompartmental signaling. First, SpoIVB has been shown to be a serine peptidase of a new family of trypsin-like enzymes belonging to clan PA(S) with the MEROPS classification S55.001 (15Wakeley P.R. Dorazi R. Hoa N.T. Bowyer J.R. Cutting S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1336-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 16Hoa N.T. Brannigan J. Cutting S.M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 17Hoa N.T. Cutting S.M. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner J.F. The Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, London2004: 2043-2046Google Scholar). Second, SpoIVB carries a PDZ domain (Fig. 1) that could be used for self-recognition, enabling cleavage in trans, as well as for interaction with its signaling partner(s) (18Hoa N.T. Brannigan J.A. Cutting S.M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4364-4373Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). SpoIVB must signal pro-σK processing by acting across the IFM and this is achieved through its NH2-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence that is required for it to target and transit the IFM (15Wakeley P.R. Dorazi R. Hoa N.T. Bowyer J.R. Cutting S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1336-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Self-cleavage of SpoIVB is initially inhibited by the action of BofC (19Gomez M. Cutting S.M. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 20Wakeley P. Hoa N.T. Cutting S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1415-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This inhibition is brief and once the levels of SpoIVB exceed those of BofC then SpoIVB undergoes self-cleavage. At least one cleavage reaction of SpoIVB has been shown to be trans and is followed by further cleavage events generating a number of discrete SpoIVB species that are released from the IFM (15Wakeley P.R. Dorazi R. Hoa N.T. Bowyer J.R. Cutting S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1336-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that SpoIVB can cleave the COOH-terminal domain of SpoIVFA that is exposed in the space between the inner and outer forespore membranes (21Dong T.C. Cutting S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1425-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We have proposed that cleavage of this region of SpoIVFA would lead to disassembly of the pro-σK processing complex releasing BofA inhibition and activation of SpoIVFB. Here, we have examined autoproteolysis of SpoIVB in detail and determined the order and nature of self-cleavage reactions. We also show that the PDZ domain of SpoIVB is required for at least three separate interactions. General recombinant DNA work was as described in Sambrook and Russell (22Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) and Bacillus methods (sporulation, transformation, etc.) were as described in Harwood and Cutting (23Harwood C.R. Cutting S.M. Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, United Kingdom1990Google Scholar). The following B. subtilis congenic strains were used: PY79 (spo+ (24Youngman P. Perkins J. Losick R. Plasmid. 1984; 12: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar)), SC1836 (spoIVBΔ::spc (25Oke V. Shchepetov M. Cutting S. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar)), SC2080 (spoIVBSA378 chr::Tn917ΩHU144 (15Wakeley P.R. Dorazi R. Hoa N.T. Bowyer J.R. Cutting S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1336-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar)), and NH1135 (spoIVBΔ::spc amyE::spoIVBD149N (18Hoa N.T. Brannigan J.A. Cutting S.M. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4364-4373Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar)). pET28b(+) plasmids (Novagen) were used for expression of SpoIVB proteins. Vectors pΔIVB, pΔIVBSA378, and pΔIVBD149N expressing M36, M36-S378A, and M36-D149N have been described previously (21Dong T.C. Cutting S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1425-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) but in this work M36-S378A is referred to as M36* and M36-D149N as M36D. pV100 that encodes the V100 SpoIVB polypeptide and is truncated for residues 1–99 has been reported elsewhere (21Dong T.C. Cutting S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1425-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To construct clones expressing full-length SpoIVB (M1) or truncated derivatives, N53, F63, and T75, two primers were used in each case to amplify the appropriate segment of spoIVB from PY79 (spo+) chromosomal DNA as outlined under Supplemental Materials Table SI. Primers carried restriction endonuclease sites to facilitate cloning in pET28b(+). To clone similar spoIVB templates but carrying the S378A or D149N mutations the same primers were used but with chromosomal DNA from strain SC2080 (spoIVBSA378) or NH1135 (spoIVBD149N) as the PCR template (Supplemental Materials Table SI). To construct vectors expressing COOH-terminal deletions of SpoIVB (M36(Δ9), M36(Δ16), M36(Δ24), M36(Δ34)) a forward primer, 36F, was used that annealed to spoIVB starting at codon 36 (Supplemental Materials Table SI). The reverse primer annealed to 3′ sequences of spoIVB so that a TTA stop codon was placed after codons 391 (Δ34), 401 (Δ24), 409 (Δ16), and 416 (Δ9) in the spoIVB ORF. Wild-type or spoIVBSA378 alleles were incorporated into the deletions by using either PY79 (spo+) or SC2080 (spoIVBSA378) templates for PCR amplification (Supplemental Materials Table SI). To verify constructions the cloned templates were sequenced in their entirety. Deletions—To construct B. subtilis strains carrying the spoIVB COOH-terminal deletions, Δ34, Δ24, Δ16, and Δ9, two oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify a truncated spoIVB product using B. subtilis chromosomal DNA of strain PY79. The forward primer, P1 (5′-TTATAACGTTCGTGCACATCCATTCGTTC) annealed to nucleotides –146 to –127 upstream of the spoIVB start codon and carried an embedded HindIII site. For the 3′-end the reverse primers R34B (5′-CCGGGATCCTTAGACAGCACCGATCACTTTTCC), R24B (5′-CCGGGATCCTTAGCTTGTCGGGTCATTTACAAATAC), R16B (5′-CCGGGATCCTTACCATTCAATATGAACACCGTAG), and R9B (5′-CCGGGATCCTTAGATTCCTGCTTCTGACAGCATCC) were used and each carried an embedded BamHI site. Each reverse primer would introduce a TAA stop codon at positions 418 (R9B), 411 (R16B), 403 (R24B), and 393 (R34B). The PCR amplified products were cleaved with HindIII and BamHI and cloned into pBluescript II KS(+). The clone was verified by sequencing and then subcloned into pDG364. pDG364 enables insertion of cloned DNA, in trans, at the amyE locus by a double crossover marker replacement (26Cutting S.M. Vander-Horn P.B. Harwood C.R. Cutting S.M. Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, United Kingdom1990: 27-74Google Scholar). For each deletion the pDG364 clone was introduced into cells of SC1836 (spoIVBΔ::spc) by DNA-mediated transformation and selection for chloramphenicol resistance (encoded by pDG364). Strains were TD776 (amyE::spoIVBΔ9 spoIVBΔ::spc), TD1034 (amyE::spoIVBΔ16 spoIVBΔ::spc), TD1036 (amyE::spoIVBΔ24 spoIVBΔ::spc), and TD775 (amyE::spoIVBΔ34 spoIVBΔ::spc). Site-specific Mutations—A PCR-based mutagenesis method using double strand DNA template and selecting mutants with DpnI (22Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) was used to generate site-specific mutations at Thr393 (Thr to Iso and Thr to Asn) and Val395 (Val to Glu) within the spoIVB ORF. The spoIVB template in pBluescript II KS(+) vector was used as a template for mutation. The mutated templates were checked for the presence of the desired mutation and then subcloned into pDG364 before introduction of the mutated spoIVB gene into the chromosome of SC1836 (spoIVBΔ::spc) at the amyE locus by a double crossover marker replacement (26Cutting S.M. Vander-Horn P.B. Harwood C.R. Cutting S.M. Molecular Biological Methods for Bacillus. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, United Kingdom1990: 27-74Google Scholar) to generate the following strains, TD1160 (amyE::spoIVBT393I spoIVBΔ::spc), TD1164 (amyE::spoIVBT393N spoIVBΔ::spc), and TD1168 (amyE::spoIVBV395E spoIVBΔ::spc). The GST pull-down assay was carried out using immunoblotting to detect protein partners as described in Ref. 22Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar. To alleviate problems associated with membrane-bound proteins, purified proteins were used. Incubation mixtures consisted of 50 μl of prepared glutathione-Sepharose beads, 50 μg of PDZ protein (His tag purified) mixed with either binding buffer only (20 mm Tris-Cl, 200 mm NaC1, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100), 50 μg of GST protein in binding buffer or 50 μg of GST-fusion protein in binding buffer. Binding reactions were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, then the beads were washed three times with ice-cold binding buffer using a refrigerated microcentrifuge (4 °C). Bound complexes were eluted with reduced glutathione (20 mm in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0) and analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting with an antibody raised to a chimeric GST-PDZ protein (see “Deletions”). Experiments were performed at least three times. Molecular masses are shown in kDa. Assays were as described in the legend to Fig. 6. The following reagents were used. GST-IVBC—A truncated SpoIVB polypeptide consisting of the COOH-terminal 41 residues of SpoIVB fused to the GST protein. The spoIVB ORF from codon 385 to the stop codon was amplified using the primer pair 385F (5′-CGCGGATCCGGAAAAGTGATCGGTGCTG) and IVBCR (5′-TCCCCCCGGGTCAGCTTGCTTTTTCTTTTCCATAAATATC), which included BamHI and XmaI sites to facilitate cloning into the pGEX-4T-3 vector and in-frame fusion to the 3′-end of GST carried in pGEX-4T-3. The recombinant plasmids were checked for errors by nucleotide sequencing and expression of the polypeptides were confirmed by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction in BL21(DE3)pLys-S cells and SDS-PAGE analysis. GST-IVBC(T393I), GST-IVBC(V393E), and GST-IVBC(T393N)—These were identical to GST-IVBC except that the COOH-terminal SpoIVB polypeptides carried mutations at codons 393 (Thr to Iso and Thr to Asn) and 395 (Val to Glu). GST-IVBN—A truncated SpoIVB polypeptide consisting of the NH2-terminal 32 residues of SpoIVB fused to the GST protein. The spoIVB ORF from codon Pro2 to codon Ile32 was amplified using the primer pair 2F (5′-CGCGGATCCCCCGATAACATCAGAAAAGC) and IVBN (5′-CCGCTCGAGTTAAATCAGTAAATATTCTTTTAGCGG), which included BamHI and XhoI sites to facilitate cloning into the pGEX-4T-3 vector and in-frame fusion to the 3′-end of GST carried in pGEX-4T-3. The recombinant plasmids were checked for errors by nucleotide sequencing and expression of the polypeptides were confirmed by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction in BL21(DE3)pLys-S cells and SDS-PAGE analysis. GST-ΔBofA—This was a fusion of GST at its COOH terminus to residues 58–87 of BofA. The bofA ORF (beginning at codon 58 and ending at the stop codon) was PCR amplified by the primer pair BofA-V58-F (CGCGGATCCGTGCCGATTAATCTGGTTAC) and BofA-R (CCGCTCGAGTTAAATGATAAATTGCTTAATGACG). These primers carried the BamHI and XhoI sites (underlined) to facilitate cloning into the pGEX-4T-3 vector and fusion to the 3′-end of GST. The recombinant plasmids were validated as described for GST-B385. GST-FA264 and GST-FA189—This was a fusion of GST at its COOH terminus to residues 100–264 or 100–189 of SpoIVFA. The spoIVFA ORF was amplified by the primer pair FA-Q100-F (5′-CGCGGATCCCAGATTAAACCCGCCG) and FA-V189-R for GST-IVFA-(100–189) (5′-CCGCTCGAGTTAGACTTCAACCACATAGCC) or FA-R for GST-IVFA-(100–264) (5′-CCGCTCGAGTTATTCAAATGAAATCACCTG), which included BamHI and XhoI sites to faciliate cloning into pGEX-4T-3 vector and in-frame fusion to GST. The recombinant plasmids were validated as described for GST-B385. PDZ-His—The spoIVB ORF from codon 98 to 193, corresponding to the PDZ domain, was amplified using the primer pair PDZF (5′-ATGCCATGGGGGTGCATGTTCTTCCTG) and PDZR (5′-CCGCTCGAGCAGCTTCGTTTTGATTTTC), which included NcoI and XhoI sites, respectively, to faciliate cloning into pET28b(+) vector and COOH-terminal fusion to the hexa-histidine tag. The vector encoded a 10-kDa PDZ protein carrying the poly-histidine tag at the COOH terminus. V100SA378—The spoIVBSA378 ORF (SC2080) from codon V100 to the stop codon was amplified using the primer pair V100F (5′-CATGCCATGGGCGTTCTTCCTGATTTAAAAGTTATACCTGGC) and IVBR, which included NcoI and XhoI sites, respectively, to faciliate cloning into pET28b(+) vector and COOH-terminal fusion to the hexa-histidine tag. The vector encoded a 36-kDa protein carrying the poly-histidine tag at the COOH terminus. GST-ΔBofC—A truncated BofC polypeptide consisting of the COOH-terminal 141 residues of BofC fused to the GST protein. The bofC ORF from codon Gly30 to the stop codon was amplified using the primer pair bofCF (5′-CGCGGATCCGGCGCGGAAGTGGAGCAC) and bofCR (5′-CCGCTCGAGTTACCCGCTGTATGTCTTCATATGTTC), which included BamHI and XhoI sites to facilitate cloning into the pGEX-4T-3 vector and in-frame fusion to the 3′-end of GST carried in pGEX-4T-3. The recombinant plasmids were checked for errors by nucleotide sequencing and expression of the polypeptides was confirmed by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction in BL21(DE3)pLys-S cells and SDS-PAGE analysis. Antibodies—Because of the small size of the PDZ domain protein (10 kDa) we chose to generate an antiserum in rabbits to a hybrid protein consisting of PDZ fused to GST. The primer pairs PDZ-GST-F (5′-CGCGGATCCGCAGTGCATGTTCTTCCTG) and PDZ-GST-R (5′-CCGGAATTCCAGCTTCGTTTTGATTTTC) were used to amplify the PDZ domain from the spoIVB ORF (codons 98–193) of a B. subtilis chromosomal DNA template. These primers also carried restriction sites (BamHI and EcoRI) for directional and in-frame cloning downstream of the GST coding region on the pGEX-4T-3 vector (Amersham Biosciences). This clone would express a fusion protein consisting of the PDZ domain fused to GST at its NH2 terminus. The fusion protein was purified using a GSTrap (Amersham Biosciences) and used to raise antisera in rabbits. Antisera was affinity purified and preabsorbed with an Escherichia coli cell extract before use at a dilution 1:10,000 and was found to recognize both GST and the SpoIVB PDZ domain. The EcoPro T7 System (Novagen) was used according to the manufacturers instructions. Approximately, 100 ng of pure plasmid DNA (pET28b(+) or cloned derivatives) was used per reaction (37 °C, 60 min) with [35S]methionine (1000 Ci mm–1) for the hot reaction. Reactions were stopped using RNase (5 μl; 1 mg/ml) and DNase (5 μl; 1 mg/ml) and reactions were incubated for a further 30 min at 37 °C. For mixing experiments, 1 volume of a cold reaction mixture was mixed with 1 volume of a hot reaction and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Samples (20 μl) were run on SDS-PAGE gels. Autoproteolysis of SpoIVB—Full-length SpoIVB (SpoIVBM1; 46 kDa) and NH2-terminal deletions of residues 1–35 (SpoIVBΔM36; 42 kDa), 1–52 (SpoIVBΔN53; 40 kDa), 1–62 (SpoIVBΔF63; 39 kDa), and 1–74 (SpoIVBΔT75; 38 kDa) were expressed from pET vectors using a membrane-free, in vitro transcription-translation system and [35S]Met labeling. For simplicity we will henceforth refer to these clones as M1, M36, N53, F63, and T75, respectively (Fig. 1). All ORFs were placed under the control of the pET promoter, ribosome binding site, and an ATG start codon (see “Experimental Procedures”). M36 (described as IVBΔ), which has the NH2-terminal signal sequence deleted has previously been shown to be proteolytically active and can cleave another SpoIVB template (proteolytically inactive M36-S378A or M36*) in trans (15Wakeley P.R. Dorazi R. Hoa N.T. Bowyer J.R. Cutting S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1336-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The N53, F63, and T75 proteins were designed to correspond to the individual polypeptides identified from NH2-terminal sequence analysis of purified SpoIVB cleavage products (15Wakeley P.R. Dorazi R. Hoa N.T. Bowyer J.R. Cutting S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1336-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Expression of full-length SpoIVB protein, M1, produced three products of 46, 40, and 38 kDa (Fig. 2A). Expression of the truncated spoIVB ORFs produced bands of 42, 40, 39, and 38 kDa for M36; bands of 40, 39, and 38 kDa for N53; bands of 39 and 38 kDa for F63; and a single species of 38 kDa for T75 (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, for M36 the slowest migrating band of 42 kDa was less abundant than the 40- and 38-kDa species. Similarly, for both M36 and N53 the 39-kDa band was of low abundance while in full-length IVB it was not observed at all. In each case the slowest migrating band corresponded to the predicted molecular weight of the encoded SpoIVB protein and this was confirmed by performing an identical analysis using the same clones engineered to carry a mutation (S378A; Ser to Ala) in the catalytic serine at position 378 (termed M1*, M36*, N53*, F63*, and T75*). Expression of these clones showed that, with one exception, mutation of the active site serine prevented cleavage (Fig. 2B), confirming that cleavage is autoproteolytic. Minor bands were seen that could correspond to cleavage products (notably F63*) and we believe these may result from low levels of residual activity that has been shown to occur despite the presence of the S378A mutation (16Hoa N.T. Brannigan J. Cutting S.M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The one discrepancy was with expression of the full-length SpoIVB protein (M1*) carrying the S378A mutation where a secondary band of 42 kDa was detectable. Residual proteolytic activity within the catalytic triad might account for this but it does not explain why proteolysis did not proceed further nor likewise in the case of the M36*, N53*, or F63* polypeptides. As proposed previously, it is more likely that codon 36 (methionine) of the spoIVB ORF provides a secondary start site for translation in the in vitro system used here (15Wakeley P.R. Dorazi R. Hoa N.T. Bowyer J.R. Cutting S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1336-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cleavage Reactions: Cis or Trans?—To determine the ability of SpoIVB to cleave in trans we mixed unlabeled SpoIVB products from an in vitro transcription and translation system with [35S]Met-labeled SpoIVB templates that carried the S378A allele, and thus, were unable to autonomously self-process (as shown in Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 2C all four truncated versions of SpoIVB, M36, N53, F63, and T75, were able to cleave the labeled M36* protein carrying the S378A allele, producing, in each case, a 40-kDa cleavage product corresponding in size to the first cleavage site (between residues 52 and 53). As a control we also used an unlabeled M36* protein and showed that this failed to cleave M36*. One further reaction performed here was to examine trans cleavage using a SpoIVB protein (V100) in which residues 1–99 had been deleted from the NH2 terminus. In other work this truncated SpoIVB protein was shown to cleave SpoIVFA in trans using a similar mixing experiment (21Dong T.C. Cutting S.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1425-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We observe here that V100 was also able to cleave M36* in trans. In contrast to the use of M36* as a template neither the N53* and T63* proteins (both carrying the S378A allele) were cleaved by any of the five active SpoIVB forms, M36, N53, F63, T75, or V100 (Fig. 2C). These results show that the M36 protein can serve as a template for trans cleavage but not the N53 or F63 proteins. Because expression of M36, N53, or F63 lead to self-proteolysis ultimately generating a 38-kDa species equivalent in size to T75 we conclude that the initial self-processing reaction of SpoIVB is in trans and subsequent cleavages must be in cis (Fig. 1). Activity of Full-length SpoIVB—In the in vitro experiments shown in Fig. 2A expression was allowed to proceed for 1 h. Prolonged in vitro expression of either full-length M1 or M36 revealed that the full-length M1 protein self-processed at a much slower rate than the truncated M36 species (Fig. 3, A and B, respectively). With M36, little, if any of the 42-kDa species was detectable after 2 h of incubation and by 4 h self-processing appeared almost complete with the accumulation of stable 38- and 39-kDa species. In contrast, the 46-kDa M1 protein was still readily detectable after 8 h of incubation. However, additional species of 40, 39, and 38 kDa were also present. We tested whether the full-length SpoIVB protein M1 was active as a peptidase using in vitro expression of M1 and mixing with appropriate 35S-labeled substrates as shown in Fig. 3C. Expression of M1 alone generated a predominant 46-kDa species and lower molecular mass products of 40, 39, and 38 kDa (in agreement with Fig. 2A). Expression of M1* carrying the S378A allele abolished these lower m"

We employed two-photon photolysis to apply ATP locally and transiently, thus mimicking ATP release upon cell damage or exocytosis. Using this technique, an increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was induced via P2Y receptors in individual sensory neurons, or in a neurite region. The ATP-induced [Ca2+]i rise was attenuated by applications of either a phospholipase C inhibitor, or inhibitors for IP3 or ryanodine receptors. These results indicate that intracellular Ca2+ stores play a major role in contributing to the increase in [Ca2+]i. Spatiotemporal analysis revealed that local and transient applications of ATP increased [Ca2+]i by release from intracellular stores, but in a unique, graded, and synchronized manner. 1) As the duration of local ATP application was prolonged, the latency decreased and the magnitude of the [Ca2+]i rise increased; 2) The time course of the rising phase of the [Ca2+]i response to ATP was essentially the same over the cell body, once [Ca2+]i had started to rise. It is anticipated that sensory responses may be modulated variably, depending on the spatiotemporal characteristics of the ATP-related [Ca2+]i profile."
https://openalex.org/W2170575676,"A crystal structure of the bacteriophage T7 gene 5 protein/Escherichia coli thioredoxin complex reveals a region in the exonuclease domain (residues 144-157) that is not present in other members of the E. coli DNA polymerase I family. To examine the role of this region, a genetically altered enzyme that lacked residues 144-157 (T7 polymerase (pol) Δ144-157) was purified and characterized biochemically. The polymerase activity and processivity of T7 pol Δ144-157 on primed M13 DNA are similar to that of wild-type T7 DNA polymerase implying that these residues are not important for DNA synthesis. The ability of T7 pol Δ144-157 to catalyze the hydrolysis of a phosphodiester bond, as judged from the rate of hydrolysis of a p-nitrophenyl ester of thymidine monophosphate, also remains unaffected. However, the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity on polynucleotide substrates is drastically reduced; exonuclease activity on single-stranded DNA is 10-fold lower and that on double-stranded DNA is 20-fold lower as compared with wild-type T7 DNA polymerase. Taken together, our results suggest that residues 144-157 of gene 5 protein, although not crucial for polymerase activity, are important for DNA binding during hydrolysis of polynucleotides."
