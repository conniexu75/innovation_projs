The basic principle of this method, however., is adaptable to the determination of Z-ascorbic acid (AsA), DHA, and DKA in the presence of each other. It is the purpose of this paper to report methods for such determinations. The first problem to overcome in this work was the extraction of the three compounds from tissues. This must be done by techniques that will not permit the oxidation of AsA to DHA and will keep at a minimum the ‘change of DHA into DKA. Roe and Oesterling (2) prevented the oxidation of AsA in plant tissues by extracting with a metaphosphoric acid solution containing 1 per cent of thiourea. However, in animal tissues thiourea will not adequately prevent the oxidation of AsA during extraction because of the powerful oxidant effect of oxyhemoglobin. The problem was solved by adding SnCla in 10 per cent concentration to the HP03 solution; SnClz effectively reduces the oxyhemoglobin of animal tissues. Furthermore SnCh is a more convenient reagent, since it can be removed later in the procedure. The procedure developed consists of grinding the tissue under 10 per cent solution of stannous chloride in 5 per cent HPOI, after which enough 5 per cent metaphosphoric acid solution is added to make the SnCh. concentration 0.5 per cent. From data on melting points, nitrogen content, and chromatographic adsorption Penney and Zilva (3) came to the conclusion that the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine derivatives of AsA, DHA, and DKA are the same compound. Absorption curves of the derivatives of DHA and DKA, prepared by ourselves, also indicate that these derivatives are identical substances. Penney and Zilva (3) have postulated that 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine couples only with DKA and, therefore, DHA gives rise to a derivative in"

The substance is not combined in the proteins of the seed, but occurs in the free state, and makes up 2.5 per cent of the dry weight of jack beans (3). In a series of papers available to the authors for the most part in abstract only, the Japanese workers have reported extensive investigations into the chemistry and physiology of the substance. The structure of canavanine was established by Gulland and Morris (4) and by Kitagawa and Takani (5) as NH2•C(:NII)•NII•O•CH2•CH2•CHNH2•COOH. Natural canavanine is of the L configuration (6)."

https://openalex.org/W2007227078,"IN a paper presented before the Sixth International Congress of Experimental Cytology at Stockholm, 1947, J. Runnström1 remarked : ""I find it reasonable to assume that the activation of the development means the activation of a number of enzyme systems"" . Starting from this assumption, I have studied the distribution of alkaline phosphatase in oocytes, mature unfertilized and fertilized eggs of the sea-urchin Paracentrotus lividus Lm. The material was collected during the summer of 1947 at the Station Biologique, Roscoff, Finistère."

https://openalex.org/W66693341,"A study of the ultraviolet absorption spectra of preparations of blood group A-specific substance isolated from hog gastric mucin supports the view that group A substance, and probably group O substance, has little specific absorption in this spectral region and that other components account for most if not all of the specific absorption noted in the case of impure preparations. However, ultraviolet spectrophotometric analyses have been found to be particularly useful in following changes in composition brought about by the fractionation of group A substance preparations obtained from hog gastric mucin as well as in comparing preparations isolated by different methods and from different sources. Such analyses have also indicated that tyrosine and tryptophan, if indeed present in group A substance, are but minor constituents."

Recently, with an electron microscope, Gessler and Fullam2 investigated guinea pig liver fixed with osmium tetroxide and cut with the high-speed microtome; they observed that the ‘nuclear membrane' is sharply shown, and that, generally, the fat-containing parts of the tissue appear darker in these electron photomicrographs."
