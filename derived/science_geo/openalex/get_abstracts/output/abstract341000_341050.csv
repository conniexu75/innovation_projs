Core formation was contemporaneous with earth accretion; the core is not in chemical equilibrium with the mantle; the outer core is a fluid iron alloy containing significant quantities of lighter elements and is probably almost adiabatic and compositionally uniform; the more iron-rich inner solid core is a consequence of partial freezing of the outer core, and the energy release from this process sustains the earth's magnetic field; and the thermodynamic properties of the core are well constrained by the application of liquid-state theory to seismic and laboratory data."

The rate at which fringe-lipped bats capture frogs is significantly higher when the frogs are calling. These bats respond to a wide variety of calls from edible frogs, and, when simultaneously presented with a choice, choose the recorded call of a palatable species over that of a poisonous species and the call of a small species over that of one too large to capture. Thus the selective advantages of loud, rapid mating calls in anurans are balanced by an increased risk of predation."

In addition to being associated with living cells and dead remains of plants and microbes, carbohydrates also coat clay platelets and occur in crevices of submicron size within mineral aggregates. The determination of the precise location of polysaccharides in soils explains in part why some carbohydrates are resistant to microbial degradation and why small quantities of microbial polysaccharides are able to stabilize clay aggregates."
https://openalex.org/W1979474035,"Well-preserved plant remains in packrat middens chronicle vegetation change in Chaco Canyon over the past 11,000 years. Early Holocene evidence of communities dominated by Douglas fir, Rocky Mountain juniper, and limber pine in the San Juan Basin calls for revision of traditional constructs based on fossil pollen. Middle and late Holocene vegetation in the canyon was pinyon-juniper woodland up until Anasazi occupation between 1000 and 800 years ago. Instead of climate, Anasazi fuel needs may explain the drastic reduction of pinyon and juniper after 1230 years ago. The lack of pinyon-juniper recovery over the past millennium has implications for contemporary forest and range ecology."

The seven experiments to be conducted during this flight-investigations related to continental geology, atmospheric chemistry, meteorology, marine biology, and plant physiology-will demonstrate the potential usefulness of the shuttle for research in the earth and life sciences."

https://openalex.org/W2065391621,"It is argued that interstellar polycyanoacetylenes are formed not on dust grains by catalytic buildup or by dissociation of longer molecules, but rather by gas phase ion-molecule reactions. The primary evidence for this view is the detection of deuterated cyanoacetylene in an interstellar cloud. It is also argued that the relative abundance of successive homologs of polycyanoacetylenes rules out the grain catalysis theory."

https://openalex.org/W2085182364,Alcohol has several effects on human reproduction. A recent report based on animal studies suggests that adolescent consumption of alcohol may delay the onset of sexual maturity. Male mice were fed alcohol during the growth period corresponding to human adolescence and at 29 days after birth when they should become sexually mature their reproductive organs were observed to be smaller than those of the control group. After an additional 14 days sexual maturity for the alcohol fed mice was achieved. Another report indicates that high levels of alcohol in female rats prevents ovulation. Researchers have shown that a pint or more of hard liquor consumed daily for 5-8 years can produce sterility impotency feminization in men and premature menopause in women. Alcohol damages the hypothalamus and pituitary thus reduces sperm counts and testosterone levels in the blood which may lower the sex drive and make men impotent. In addition some alcoholic men increase the production of estrogen-like compounds in the peripheral cells which in conjunction with decreased testosterone produces changes in secondary sex characteristics. Ethanol has been found toxic for Leydig cells which are crucial for the synthesis of testosterone. Nearly all the effects are reversible if consumption stops before damage is severe.

https://openalex.org/W4232486112,"Because a line was inadvertently omitted, the article ""Reagan reforms create upheaval at NIOSH"" (News and Comment, 9 Oct., p. 166) stated on p. 168 that Donald Millar, new director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), believes that NIOSH should be separated from the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. The sentence should have read, ""Millar says one of the things he learned as acting director [of NIOSH] is that NIOSH should be moved to Atlanta or that its ties to CDC should be severed."" Millar, who wants strengthened ties between NIOSH and CDC, favors the former alternative."
