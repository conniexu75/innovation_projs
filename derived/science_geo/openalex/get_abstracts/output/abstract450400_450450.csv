https://openalex.org/W2066500891,"The performance of superconducting qubits has improved by several orders of magnitude in the past decade. These circuits benefit from the robustness of superconductivity and the Josephson effect, and at present they have not encountered any hard physical limits. However, building an error-corrected information processor with many such qubits will require solving specific architecture problems that constitute a new field of research. For the first time, physicists will have to master quantum error correction to design and operate complex active systems that are dissipative in nature, yet remain coherent indefinitely. We offer a view on some directions for the field and speculate on its future."
https://openalex.org/W1982353990,"The past decade has seen remarkable progress in isolating and controlling quantum coherence using charges and spins in semiconductors. Quantum control has been established at room temperature, and electron spin coherence times now exceed several seconds, a nine-order-of-magnitude increase in coherence compared with the first semiconductor qubits. These coherence times rival those traditionally found only in atomic systems, ushering in a new era of ultracoherent spintronics. We review recent advances in quantum measurements, coherent control, and the generation of entangled states and describe some of the challenges that remain for processing quantum information with spins in semiconductors."
https://openalex.org/W2163077582,"Trapped atomic ions are standards for quantum information processing, serving as quantum memories, hosts of quantum gates in quantum computers and simulators, and nodes of quantum communication networks. Quantum bits based on trapped ions enjoy a rare combination of attributes: They have exquisite coherence properties, they can be prepared and measured with nearly 100% efficiency, and they are readily entangled with each other through the Coulomb interaction or remote photonic interconnects. The outstanding challenge is the scaling of trapped ions to hundreds or thousands of qubits and beyond, at which scale quantum processors can outperform their classical counterparts in certain applications. We review the latest progress and prospects in that effort, with the promise of advanced architectures and new technologies, such as microfabricated ion traps and integrated photonics."
https://openalex.org/W2166529463,It's a SIRT Intense attention has focused on the SIRT1 deacetylase as a possible target for anti-aging drugs. But unexpected complications in assays of SIRT1 activity have made it unclear whether compounds thought to be sirtuin-activating compounds (STACs) are really direct regulators of the enzyme. Further exploration of these effects by Hubbard et al. (p. 1216 ; see the Perspective by Yuan and Marmorstein ) revealed that interaction of SIRT1 with certain substrates allows activation of SIRT1 by STACs and identified critical amino acids in SIRT1 required for these effects. Mouse myoblasts reconstituted with SIRT1 mutated at this amino acid lost their responsiveness to STACs.

Two groups tested this hypothesis using diverse experiments, with both finding that quinolone, lactam, and aminoglycoside antibiotics had similar efficacy for killing in the presence or absence of oxygen (or nitrate). Liu et al. (p. 1210 ) saw no increase in hydrogen peroxide production in antibiotic-exposed cells and found no association between antibiotic exposure and the expected symptoms of oxidative damage, such as the breakdown of iron-sulfur clusters in enzymes or of hydroxyl radical injuries to DNA. Similarly, Keren et al. (p. 1213 ) found no correlation between the production of ROS, inferred from hydroxyphenyl fluorescein dye measurements, and bacterial survival, nor was there any significant protective effect engendered by thiourea. The results do not support a common mode of action for bactericidal antibiotics mediated by ROS."

This organism is endowed with extraordinary metabolic talents and can consume a variety of strange carbohydrates, as well as turn on photosynthesis when the food runs out. Schönknecht et al.

https://openalex.org/W2069545220,"Despite considerable interest in the modulation of tumor-associated Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (T(regs)) for therapeutic benefit, little is known about the developmental origins of these cells and the nature of the antigens that they recognize. We identified an endogenous population of antigen-specific T(regs) (termed MJ23 T(regs)) found recurrently enriched in the tumors of mice with oncogene-driven prostate cancer. MJ23 T(regs) were not reactive to a tumor-specific antigen but instead recognized a prostate-associated antigen that was present in tumor-free mice. MJ23 T(regs) underwent autoimmune regulator (Aire)-dependent thymic development in both male and female mice. Thus, Aire-mediated expression of peripheral tissue antigens drives the thymic development of a subset of organ-specific T(regs), which are likely coopted by tumors developing within the associated organ."
https://openalex.org/W2170530388,"African forest elephants- taxonomically and functionally unique-are being poached at accelerating rates, but we lack range-wide information on the repercussions. Analysis of the largest survey dataset ever assembled for forest elephants (80 foot-surveys; covering 13,000 km; 91,600 person-days of fieldwork) revealed that population size declined by ca. 62% between 2002-2011, and the taxon lost 30% of its geographical range. The population is now less than 10% of its potential size, occupying less than 25% of its potential range. High human population density, hunting intensity, absence of law enforcement, poor governance, and proximity to expanding infrastructure are the strongest predictors of decline. To save the remaining African forest elephants, illegal poaching for ivory and encroachment into core elephant habitat must be stopped. In addition, the international demand for ivory, which fuels illegal trade, must be dramatically reduced."

The human relationship with caffeine is relatively recent, however, and thus its impact on our brains is likely a by-product of its true ecological role. Caffeine occurs naturally in the floral nectar of Coffea and Citrus plants. Wright et al. (p. 1202 ; see the Perspective by Chittka and Peng ) found that caffeine presented at naturalistic levels significantly improved the ability of bees to remember and locate a learned floral scent and potentiated the responses of neurons involved in olfactory learning and memory."
https://openalex.org/W2163982872,"S-T-R-E-T-C-H Me Most metals show elastic strain limits well below 1%, beyond which permanent plastic deformation occurs. Metal nanowires can be elastically stretched to much higher strains, on the order of 4 to 7%. However, when placed inside a metal matrix to form a composite, these nanowires can no longer be stretched to the same extent, even when the nanowires are well distributed and show good bonding with the matrix. Hao et al. (p. 1191 ; see the Perspective by Zhou ) used a shape memory alloy as the matrix material to produce a much better (more elastic) composite."

https://openalex.org/W2045296728,"Relativistic quantum mechanics predicts that when the charge of a superheavy atomic nucleus surpasses a certain threshold, the resulting strong Coulomb field causes an unusual atomic collapse state; this state exhibits an electron wave function component that falls toward the nucleus, as well as a positron component that escapes to infinity. In graphene, where charge carriers behave as massless relativistic particles, it has been predicted that highly charged impurities should exhibit resonances corresponding to these atomic collapse states. We have observed the formation of such resonances around artificial nuclei (clusters of charged calcium dimers) fabricated on gated graphene devices via atomic manipulation with a scanning tunneling microscope. The energy and spatial dependence of the atomic collapse state measured with scanning tunneling microscopy revealed unexpected behavior when occupied by electrons."
https://openalex.org/W1989838827,"Quantum computation requires controlled engineering of quantum states to perform tasks that go beyond those possible with classical computers. Topological quantum computation aims to achieve this goal by using non-Abelian quantum phases of matter. Such phases allow for quantum information to be stored and manipulated in a nonlocal manner, which protects it from imperfections in the implemented protocols and from interactions with the environment. Recently, substantial progress in this field has been made on both theoretical and experimental fronts. We review the basic concepts of non-Abelian phases and their topologically protected use in quantum information processing tasks. We discuss different possible realizations of these concepts in experimentally available solid-state systems, including systems hosting Majorana fermions, their recently proposed fractional counterparts, and non-Abelian quantum Hall states."
https://openalex.org/W2055971178,"Respiratory substrates and adenine nucleotides cross the mitochondrial outer membrane through the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), comprising three isoforms--VDAC1, 2, and 3. We characterized the role of individual isoforms in mitochondrial metabolism by HepG2 human hepatoma cells using siRNA. With VDAC3 to the greatest extent, all VDAC isoforms contributed to the maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential, but only VDAC3 knockdown decreased ATP, ADP, NAD(P)H, and mitochondrial redox state. Cells expressing predominantly VDAC3 were least sensitive to depolarization induced by increased free tubulin. In planar lipid bilayers, free tubulin inhibited VDAC1 and VDAC2 but not VDAC3. Erastin, a compound that interacts with VDAC, blocked and reversed mitochondrial depolarization after microtubule destabilizers in intact cells and antagonized tubulin-induced VDAC blockage in planar bilayers. In conclusion, free tubulin inhibits VDAC1/2 and limits mitochondrial metabolism in HepG2 cells, contributing to the Warburg phenomenon. Reversal of tubulin-VDAC interaction by erastin antagonizes Warburg metabolism and restores oxidative mitochondrial metabolism."

Their adoption as cosmic yardsticks has led to the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe. Wang et al.

https://openalex.org/W2041225817,"The secure base and safe haven effects of the attachment figure are central features of the human attachment theory. Recently, conclusive evidence for human analogue attachment behaviours in dogs has been provided, however, the owner’s security-providing role in danger has not been directly supported. We investigated the relationship between the behavioural and cardiac response in dogs (N = 30) while being approached by a threatening stranger in separation vs. in the presence of the owner, presented in a balanced order. Non-invasive telemetric measures of heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) data during the threatening approaches was compared to periods before and after the encounters. Dogs that showed distress vocalisation during separation (N = 18) and that growled or barked at the stranger during the threatening approach (N = 17) were defined as behaviourally reactive in the given situation. While characteristic stress vocalisations were emitted during separations, the absence of the owner did not have an effect on dogs’ mean HR, but significantly increased the HRV. The threatening approach increased dogs’ mean HR, with a parallel decrease in the HRV, particularly in dogs that were behaviourally reactive to the encounter. Importantly, the HR increase was significantly less pronounced when dogs faced the stranger in the presence of the owner. Moreover, the test order, whether the dog encountered the stranger first with or without its owner, also proved important: HR increase associated with the encounter in separation seemed to be attenuated in dogs that faced the stranger first in the presence of their owner. We provided evidence for human analogue safe haven effect of the owner in a potentially dangerous situation. Similarly to parents of infants, owners can provide a buffer against stress in dogs, which can even reduce the effect of a subsequent encounter with the same threatening stimuli later when the owner is not present."
https://openalex.org/W1997012066,"Cell-cell fusion is critical for the conception, development, and physiology of multicellular organisms. Although cellular fusogenic proteins and the actin cytoskeleton are implicated in cell-cell fusion, it remains unclear whether and how they coordinate to promote plasma membrane fusion. We reconstituted a high-efficiency, inducible cell fusion culture system in the normally nonfusing Drosophila S2R+ cells. Both fusogenic proteins and actin cytoskeletal rearrangements were necessary for cell fusion, and in combination they were sufficient to impart fusion competence. Localized actin polymerization triggered by specific cell-cell or cell-matrix adhesion molecules propelled invasive cell membrane protrusions, which in turn promoted fusogenic protein engagement and plasma membrane fusion. This de novo cell fusion culture system reveals a general role for actin-propelled invasive membrane protrusions in driving fusogenic protein engagement during cell-cell fusion."
https://openalex.org/W1990975152,"When dynamics in a system proceeds under suppressive external bias, the system can undergo an abrupt phase transition, as it occurs for example in the epidemic spreading. Recently, an explosive percolation (EP) model was introduced in line with such phenomena. The order of the EP transition has not been clarified in a unified framework covering low dimensional systems and the mean-field limit. We introduce a stochastic model, in which a rule for dynamics is designed to avoid the formation of a spanning cluster through competitive selection in Euclidean space. We show by heuristic arguments that, in the thermodynamic limit and depending on a control parameter, the EP transition can be either continuous or discontinuous if $d < d_c$ and is always continuous if $d \geq d_c$, where $d$ is the spatial dimension and $d_c$ the upper critical dimension."

https://openalex.org/W2072108269,"The Fumarate nitrate reduction (FNR) regulator from Escherichia coli controls expression of >300 genes in response to O2 through reaction with its [4Fe-4S] cluster cofactor. FNR is the master switch for the transition between anaerobic and aerobic respiration. In response to physiological concentrations of nitric oxide (NO), FNR also regulates genes, including the nitrate reductase (nar) operon, a major source of endogenous cellular NO, and hmp, which encodes an NO-detoxifying enzyme. Here we show that the [4Fe-4S] cluster of FNR reacts rapidly in a multiphasic reaction with eight NO molecules. Oxidation of cluster sulfide ions (S(2-)) to sulfane (S(0)) occurs, some of which remains associated with the protein as Cys persulfide. The nitrosylation products are similar to a pair of dinuclear dinitrosyl iron complexes, [Fe(I)2(NO)4(Cys)2](0), known as Roussin's red ester. A similar reactivity with NO was reported for the Wbl family of [4Fe-4S]-containing proteins found only in actinomycetes, such as Streptomyces and Mycobacteria. These results show that NO reacts via a common mechanism with [4Fe-4S] clusters in phylogenetically unrelated regulatory proteins that, although coordinated by four Cys residues, have different cluster environments. The reactivity of E. coli FNR toward NO, in addition to its sensitivity toward O2, is part of a hierarchal network that monitors, and responds to, NO, both endogenously generated and exogenously derived."
https://openalex.org/W1981491357,"Still Living in Their Mother's House Dispersal, movement away from an organism's natal site, is a critical stage in the development of a juvenile into an adult and several drivers of this process have been proposed. A classic hypothesis put forward by Hamilton and May argues that individuals disperse away from kin in order to avoid competing with similar phenotypes. Many species have been shown to follow this pattern, and it is generally accepted that most organisms disperse well away from the sites where they were born. However, not all species follow this pattern and some display a distinct tendency to remain within their mother's home range. Hoogland (p. 1205 ) studied populations of three species of prairie dogs over more than three decades and found that the presence of close kin in these highly social rodents actually led young animals to remain on their natal site, whereas dispersal away from it occurred almost exclusively when close female kin were absent. This suggests that sociality may in fact result in individuals remaining with their close kin in order to benefit from cooperation and that longer-distance dispersal may instead occur when the opportunity for cooperation does not exist."
https://openalex.org/W1995704287,"RNA chaperones are ubiquitous, heterogeneous proteins essential for RNA structural biogenesis and function. We investigated the mechanism of chaperone-mediated RNA folding by following the time-resolved dimerization of the packaging domain of a retroviral RNA at nucleotide resolution. In the absence of the nucleocapsid (NC) chaperone, dimerization proceeded through multiple, slow-folding intermediates. In the presence of NC, dimerization occurred rapidly through a single structural intermediate. The RNA binding domain of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 protein, a structurally unrelated chaperone, also accelerated dimerization. Both chaperones interacted primarily with guanosine residues. Replacing guanosine with more weakly pairing inosine yielded an RNA that folded rapidly without a facilitating chaperone. These results show that RNA chaperones can simplify RNA folding landscapes by weakening intramolecular interactions involving guanosine and explain many RNA chaperone activities."
https://openalex.org/W2078297111,"Pediatric cancer is a relatively rare and heterogeneous group of hematological and non-hematological malignancies which require multiple procedures for its diagnostic screening and classification. Until now, flow cytometry (FC) has not been systematically applied to the diagnostic work-up of such malignancies, particularly for solid tumors. Here we evaluated a FC panel of markers for the diagnostic screening of pediatric cancer and further classification of pediatric solid tumors. The proposed strategy aims at the differential diagnosis between tumoral vs. reactive samples, and hematological vs. non-hematological malignancies, and the subclassification of solid tumors. In total, 52 samples from 40 patients suspicious of containing tumor cells were analyzed by FC in parallel to conventional diagnostic procedures. The overall concordance rate between both approaches was of 96% (50/52 diagnostic samples), with 100% agreement for all reactive/inflammatory and non-infiltrated samples as well as for those corresponding to solid tumors (n = 35), with only two false negative cases diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma and anaplastic lymphoma, respectively. Moreover, clear discrimination between samples infiltrated by hematopoietic vs. non-hematopoietic tumor cells was systematically achieved. Distinct subtypes of solid tumors showed different protein expression profiles, allowing for the differential diagnosis of neuroblastoma (CD56(hi)/GD2(+)/CD81(hi)), primitive neuroectodermal tumors (CD271(hi)/CD99(+)), Wilms tumors (>1 cell population), rhabdomyosarcoma (nuMYOD1(+)/numyogenin(+)), carcinomas (CD45(-)/EpCAM(+)), germ cell tumors (CD56(+)/CD45(-)/NG2(+)/CD10(+)) and eventually also hemangiopericytomas (CD45(-)/CD34(+)). In summary, our results show that multiparameter FC provides fast and useful complementary data to routine histopathology for the diagnostic screening and classification of pediatric cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1970189693,"Monoaminergic and neuropeptidergic neurons regulate a wide variety of behaviors, such as feeding, sleep/wakefulness behavior, stress response, addiction, and social behavior. These neurons form neural circuits to integrate different modalities of behavioral and environmental factors, such as stress, maternal care, and feeding conditions. One possible mechanism for integrating environmental factors through the monoaminergic and neuropeptidergic neurons is through the epigenetic regulation of gene expression via altered acetylation of histones. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play an important role in altering behavior in response to environmental factors. Despite increasing attention and the versatile roles of HDACs in a variety of brain functions and disorders, no reports have detailed the localization of the HDACs in the monoaminergic and neuropeptidergic neurons. Here, we examined the expression profile of the HDAC protein family from HDAC1 to HDAC11 in corticotropin-releasing hormone, oxytocin, vasopressin, agouti-related peptide (AgRP), pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), orexin, histamine, dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline neurons. Immunoreactivities for HDAC1,-2,-3,-5,-6,-7,-9, and -11 were very similar among the monoaminergic and neuropeptidergic neurons, while the HDAC4, -8, and -10 immunoreactivities were clearly different among neuronal groups. HDAC10 expression was found in AgRP neurons, POMC neurons, dopamine neurons and noradrenaline neurons but not in other neuronal groups. HDAC8 immunoreactivity was detected in the cytoplasm of almost all histamine neurons with a pericellular pattern but not in other neuropeptidergic and monoaminergic neurons. Thus, the differential expression of HDACs in monoaminergic and neuropeptidergic neurons may be crucial for the maintenance of biological characteristics and may be altered in response to environmental factors."

Variant W23R/W30R protein (termed W23/30R) is preferentially targeted to mitochondria but very poorly to the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas the L32N protein is preferentially targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum and poorly to mitochondria. These results explain the physiological significance of bimodal CYP targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria previously described. COS-7 cells and HepG2 cells stably expressing W23/30R mutations showed markedly increased alcohol toxicity in terms of increased production of reactive oxygen species, respiratory dysfunction, and loss of cytochrome c oxidase subunits and activity. Stable cells expressing the L32N variant, on the other hand, were relatively less responsive to alcohol-induced toxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction. These results further support our previous data, based on mutational studies involving altered targeting, indicating that mitochondria-targeted CYP2E1 plays an important role in alcohol liver toxicity.

https://openalex.org/W1987840531,"Mutations in the MCPH1 (microcephalin 1) gene, located at chromosome 8p23.1, result in two autosomal recessive disorders: primary microcephaly and premature chromosome condensation syndrome. MCPH1 has also been shown to be downregulated in breast, prostate and ovarian cancers, and mutated in 1/10 breast and 5/41 endometrial tumors, suggesting that it could also function as a tumor suppressor (TS) gene. To test the possibility of MCPH1 as a TS gene, we first performed LOH study in a panel of 81 matched normal oral tissues and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) samples, and observed that 14/71 (19.72%) informative samples showed LOH, a hallmark of TS genes. Three protein truncating mutations were identified in 1/15 OSCC samples and 2/5 cancer cell lines. MCPH1 was downregulated at both the transcript and protein levels in 21/41 (51.22%) and 19/25 (76%) OSCC samples respectively. A low level of MCPH1 promoter methylation was also observed in 4/40 (10%) tumor samples. We further observed that overexpression of MCPH1 decreased cellular proliferation, anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, cell invasion and tumor size in nude mice, indicating its tumor suppressive function. Using bioinformatic approaches and luciferase assay, we showed that the 3′-UTR of MCPH1 harbors two non-overlapping functional seed regions for miR-27a which negatively regulated its level. The expression level of miR-27a negatively correlated with the MCPH1 protein level in OSCC. Our study indicates for the first time that, in addition to its role in brain development, MCPH1 also functions as a tumor suppressor gene and is regulated by miR-27a."

However, the interaction between p75(NTR) and TrkA receptors required for this activity is not understood. Here, we report that a specific 29-amino acid peptide derived from the intracellular domain fragment of p75(NTR) interacts with and potentiates binding of NGF to TrkA-expressing cells, leading to increased neurite outgrowth in sympathetic neurons as a result of enhanced Erk1/2 and Akt signaling. An endogenous intracellular domain fragment of p75(NTR) (p75(ICD)) containing these 29 amino acids is produced by regulated proteolysis of the full-length receptor. We demonstrate that generation of this fragment is a requirement for p75(NTR) to facilitate TrkA signaling in neurons and propose that the juxtamembrane region of p75(ICD) acts to cause a conformational change within the extracellular domain of TrkA. This finding provides new insight into the mechanism by which p75(NTR) and TrkA interact to enhance neurotrophic signaling."

In the embryonic pancreas, Neurogenin3 is transiently expressed at high levels for a narrow time window to initiate endocrine differentiation in scattered progenitor cells. The mechanisms controlling these rapid and robust changes in Neurogenin3 expression are poorly understood. In this study, we characterize a Neurogenin3 positive autoregulatory loop whereby this factor may rapidly induce its own levels. We show that Neurogenin3 binds to a conserved upstream fragment of its own gene, inducing deposition of active chromatin marks and the activation of Neurog3 transcription. Additionally, we show that the broadly expressed endodermal forkhead factors Foxa1 and Foxa2 can cooperate synergistically to amplify Neurogenin3 autoregulation in vitro. However, only Foxa2 colocalizes with Neurogenin3 in pancreatic progenitors, thus indicating a primary role for this factor in regulating Neurogenin3 expression in vivo.

Neurog3 is transiently expressed in scattered MPCs within the trunk region of the developing pancreas, it is progressively down-regulated as the endocrine program is initiated and remains expressed at low levels in some adult islet cells (6Schwitzgebel V.M.

Despite its relevance for endocrine cell formation, the molecular mechanisms that control Neurog3 expression are poorly understood. The transcription factors HNF6/Onecut1, HNF1b/Tcf2, HNF3b/Foxa2, Sox9, Pdx1, and Glis3 have all been acknowledged to be upstream regulators of the Neurog3 gene (11Jacquemin P. Durviaux S.M. Jensen J.

Conversely, in clear parallelism to neural development, the Notch signaling pathway negatively regulates Neurog3 expression through the transcriptional repressor Hes1 (16Smith S.B. Watada H. German M.S. Neurogenin3 activates the islet differentiation program while repressing its own expression.Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 142-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), implying that release from Hes-1-mediated repression is required for Neurog3 gene activation in MPCs. Consistent with this notion, loss of Hes1 in the developing foregut endoderm is sufficient to induce ectopic endocrine cell formation (17Apelqvist A. Li H. Sommer L. Beatus P. Anderson D.J. Honjo T. Hrabe de Angelis M. Lendahl U. Edlund H. Notch signalling controls pancreatic cell differentiation.Nature. 1999; 400: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Recent studies have pointed out that attaining high Neurog3 levels is critical for endocrine cell commitment. Thus, low Neurog3-expressing MPCs can adopt alternative exocrine fates (18Wang S. Yan J. Anderson D.A. Xu Y. Kanal M.C. Cao Z. Wright C.V. Gu G. Neurog3 gene dosage regulates allocation of endocrine and exocrine cell fates in the developing mouse pancreas.Dev.

Wright C.V. Gu G. Neurog3 gene dosage regulates allocation of endocrine and exocrine cell fates in the developing mouse pancreas.Dev. Biol. 2010; 339: 26-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Hence, activation mechanisms must operate to allow for rapid and substantial increases in Neurog3 expression in a narrow time window that is estimated to be <24 h (20Miyatsuka T. Li Z. German M.S. Chronology of islet differentiation revealed by temporal cell labeling.Diabetes. 2009; 58: 1863-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 19Beucher A. Martín M. Spenle C. Poulet M. Collin C. Gradwohl G. Competence of failed endocrine progenitors to give rise to acinar but not ductal cells is restricted to early pancreas development.Dev. Biol. 2012; 361: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). One of the proposed mechanisms whereby Neurog3 may amplify its protein levels is through a positive feedback loop involving the Neurog3 target Myt1b, which activates Neurog3 gene transcription (21Wang S. Hecksher-Sorensen J. Xu Y. Zhao A. Dor Y. Rosenberg L. Serup P. Gu G. Myt1 and Ngn3 form a feed-forward expression loop to promote endocrine islet cell differentiation.Dev. Biol. 2008; 317: 531-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Another mechanism used by transcription factors to control their protein levels is self-regulation. In this regard, exogenous Neurog3 has been shown to induce the endogenous mouse Neurog3 gene in pancreatic duct-like mPAC cells (8Gasa R. Mrejen C. Leachman N. Otten M. Barnes M. Wang J. Chakrabarti S. Mirmira R. German M. Proendocrine genes coordinate the pancreatic islet differentiation program in vitro.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 13245-13250Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), thus revealing positive autoregulation as a potential mechanism that may contribute to the rapid accumulation of Neurog3 protein in endocrine progenitors. However, in apparent contradiction to results in mPAC cells, Neurog3 has also been shown to inhibit its own promoter in NIH3T3 fibroblasts (16Smith S.B. Watada H. German M.S. Neurogenin3 activates the islet differentiation program while repressing its own expression.Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 142-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Given the transient nature of Neurog3 expression in endocrine progenitors, it is conceivable that positive and negative regulatory mechanisms function in a timely coordinated manner to ensure tight regulation of Neurog3 expression during pancreatic development. Because of the essential role played by Neurog3 in the determination of endocrine cell fate in the pancreas, deciphering the molecular mechanisms that regulate its expression is important to fully understand how pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation is accomplished. Based on previously published studies indicating that Neurog3 is able to activate its own expression (8Gasa R. Mrejen C. Leachman N. Otten M. Barnes M. Wang J. Chakrabarti S. Mirmira R. German M. Proendocrine genes coordinate the pancreatic islet differentiation program in vitro.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 13245-13250Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), here we sought to gain further insight into the mechanisms governing Neurog3 autoregulation. Using reporter luciferase and ChIP assays, we show that Neurog3 activates its own promoter by binding to a conserved upstream regulatory region. In addition, we demonstrate that the forkhead transcription factor Foxa2 synergizes with Neurog3 to autoactivate the Neurog3 gene. Importantly, we reveal that Foxa2 is not only instrumental for Neurog3 autoregulation but it is also required for the activation of other Neurog3 target genes, indicating that Neurog3 and Foxa2 functionally cooperate to switch on the endocrine differentiation program in the pancreas. CD1 mice used in this study were maintained in a barrier facility according to protocols approved by the University of Barcelona Animal Welfare Committee. The morning of the appearance of a vaginal plug was considered as embryonic day (E) 0.5. A 5-kb fragment of 5′-flanking sequence extending from −4864 nt to +88 nt (+1 is the transcription start site) of the mouse Neurog3 gene was amplified from mouse tail genomic DNA using primers A/B. The 5-kb fragment was then used as template to generate shorter promoter fragments by PCR using primers C/B (3kb, −3057 nt to +88 nt) and D/E (−3.2 kb cluster region, −3885 nt to −3217 nt), or by restriction digest with NheI-XhoI (0.9 kb, −932 nt to +88 nt). Primer sequences are listed in supplemental Tables. The 5, 3, and 1 kb fragments were cloned upstream from the firefly luciferase gene in the KpnI/XhoI sites of the pFOXluc vector, while the enhancer fragment was cloned upstream of the firefly luciferase gene in the KpnI-XhoI sites of the pGL3-promoter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). To generate mutations, we used the QuikChange II XL Site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA) and the primers listed in supplemental Tables. The artificial E box-driven enhancer luciferase reporter constructs used to test E box preference of the Neurog3/E47 heterodimers were kindly provided by K. Kroll (Washington University). The Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid pRL-CMV (Promega) was used as transfection control in all luciferase assays. The expression vectors for mouse Neurog3 (pCMV-TNT-Neurog3) and mouse E47 (pCMV-TNT-E47) were previously described (13Lynn F.C. Smith S.B. Wilson M.E. Yang K.Y. Nekrep N. German M.S.

Expression vectors encoding rat Foxa1 (pCMV-Bgal-Foxa1) and rat Foxa2 (pCMV-Bgal-Foxa2) were kindly provided by M. A. Navas (Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain). Expression vectors encoding mouse HNF6 (pCMV4-HNF6) and rat HNF1b (pRSV-HNF1b) were kindly provided by M. Gannon (Vanderbilt University, TN) and J. Ferrer (IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain) respectively. All cell lines (mPAC L20, αTC1.6, βTC3, NIH3T3, MIN6, PANC-1) were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium-4.5 g/liter of glucose (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum plus antibiotics. MIN6 cells were additionally supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. For adenoviral infection experiments, cells were seeded onto 6-well plates or 10-cm plates and treated 1 day later (or when reaching 70–80% confluence) with adenoviruses at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 40 for 2–5 h at 37 °C in culture medium. Then, virus-containing media was replaced, and cells were cultured for an additional 44–48 h period. Generation and amplification of recombinant adenoviruses encoding human NEUROG3 and β-galactosidase was previously described (8Gasa R. Mrejen C. Leachman N. Otten M. Barnes M. Wang J. Chakrabarti S. Mirmira R. German M. Proendocrine genes coordinate the pancreatic islet differentiation program in vitro.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 13245-13250Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The adenovirus encoding the HA-tagged version of mouse Neurog3 used in ChIP and co-immunoprecipitation assays was kindly provided by G. Gradwohl (IGBMC, INSERM, University of Strasbourg, France). For luciferase assays, 1.2–1.5 × 104 mPAC or NIH3T3 cells were plated onto 96-well culture tissue plates 1 day before transfection. Transient transfections were performed using Metafectene (mPAC) from Biontex Laboratories GmbH (Martinsried, Germany) or Transfast (NIH3T3) from Promega according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amount of DNA used per well was 125 ng of firefly luciferase reporter vector, 2.5 ng of pRL.CMV and 10 ng of any cotransfected transcription factor cDNA. Empty expression vector was added when necessary to keep the amount of DNA equal in all wells. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and luciferase activity was analyzed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and a Veritas microplate luminometer (Promega). Luciferase readings were normalized to activities of the internal control vector pRL.CMV. For siRNA transfections, 2 × 105 mPAC cells were seeded onto 12-well plates and simultaneously transfected with 100 pmols of SMART pool mouse Foxa2 siRNA or a siControl (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) using Metafectene®SI (Biontex) following the manufacturer's instructions. The following day, cells were infected with recombinant adenoviruses as detailed above. Total RNA was prepared from cell lines and embryonic mouse pancreas using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA samples were treated with DNase to remove contaminating genomic DNA. First-strand cDNA was prepared using 1–2 μg of total RNA, Superscript III enzyme (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and random hexamer primers (Invitrogen) in a total volume of 20 μl. Reverse transcription reaction was carried for 90 min at 50 °C and an additional 10 min at 55 °C. 1/20 or 1/40 of the transcribed cDNA was used as template for conventional RT-PCR or real time PCR, respectively. Real time PCR was performed on an ABI Prism 7900 sequence detection system using SybrGreen reagents (Express Greener, Invitrogen). PCR primer sequences are provided in the supplemental Tables. mPAC cells or E15.5 pancreata were fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 10–15 min and cross-linking was quenched by addition of 0.125 mm glycine. Histone ChIPs were performed as described elsewhere (22Pujadas G. Felipe F. Ejarque M. Sanchez L. Cervantes S. Lynn F.C. Gomis R. Gasa R. Sequence and epigenetic determinants in the regulation of the Math6 gene by Neurogenin3.Differentiation. 2011; 82: 66-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). ChIP against transcription factors were performed using the EpiQuik kit (Epigentek, Farmingdale, NY) following the manufacturer's instructions. Antibodies used were: rabbit anti-dimethylated and tri-methylated H3K4 (Millipore, Billerica, MA), goat anti-Foxa2 (HNF3β/M20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), mouse anti-HA clone HA-7 (Sigma) and normal mouse and rabbit IgG as controls (Sigma). Immunoprecipitated DNA was assayed by real time PCR to test for the precipitation of specific promoter fragments with primers listed in the supplemental Tables. Real time PCR was performed on an ABI Prism 7900 sequence detection system using SybrGreen reagents (Express Greener, Invitrogen). Percentage of input was calculated as follows: 2−(Cp antibody-Cp input) − 2−(Cp IgG-Cp input). For co-immunoprecipitation assays, mPAC cells were lysed in coIP buffer (Tris-HCl 20 mm pH 7.5, NaCl 100 mm, EDTA 1 mm, Igepal CA-630 1%, NaF 5 mm, 10% protease inhibitor mixture from Sigma). Lysates were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Cellular lysates (500 μg) were then immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of anti-Foxa2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or mouse IgG (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. Immunoconjugates were recovered using protein G-coupled magnetic beads (Millipore) and, after 3 washes with coIP buffer, they were eluted by boiling in SDS-Laemli buffer. For preparing whole cell extracts, mPAC cells were lysed in triple detergent lysis buffer (Tris-HCl 50 mm, NaCl 150 mm, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate). Lysates were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. 50 μg of whole cell extracts or immunoprecipitates were separated by PAGE-SDS electrophoresis, transferred to a Polyscreen PVDF membrane (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with goat anti-mouse Foxa2 (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-HA (1:1000, Sigma) or beta actin (1:1000, Sigma). Blots were visualized with ECL Reagent (Pierce Biotechnology) using a LAS4000 Lumi-Imager (Fuji Photo Film, Valhalla, NY). Protein spots were evaluated with Image J software. Mouse embryos were dissected in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and their intestinal tracts, including stomach, pancreas, and spleen, were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 3 to 6 h. After three washes in PBS, tissues were subsequently dehydrated, embedded in paraffin wax, and sectioned at 3 μm. For immunofluorescence, a standard immunodetection protocol was followed. Briefly, tissues were rehydrated and subjected to heat-mediated antigen retrieval in citrate buffer in a pressure cooker for 10 min. After a blocking step in 3% donkey serum/0.2% Triton X-100 tissue sections were incubated with the following primary antibodies: goat anti-Foxa2/HNF3β 1:100, rabbit anti-Sox9 1:200, rabbit anti-mucin-1 1:100 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-Neurogenin3 1:500, mouse anti-Nkx6.1 1:500 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA), guinea pig anti-Pdx1 1:500 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), guinea pig anti-insulin 1:500 (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark), rabbit anti-chromogranin A 1:200 (Thermo Scientific). The secondary antibodies used were donkey anti-goat Cy2, donkey anti-mouse Cy3, donkey anti-rabbit Cy2 Cy3, or Alexa643, and donkey anti-guinea pig Cy3 (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Suffolk, UK). For immunocytochemistry, mPAC and MIN6 cells were seeded onto coverslips and transduced with the β-galactosidase and NEUROG3 adenoviruses as described above. Cells were fixed 44–48 h after infection in 4% PFA for 20 min and permeabilized in PBS with 0.2–0.5% Triton X-100. After a blocking step of 1 h in 3% normal donkey serum, cells were incubated overnight with an antibody against mouse Neurog3 at 1:500 dilution. The secondary antibody used was donkey anti-mouse Cy3. Before mounting onto slides, nuclei were stained for 3 min in a 1:500 dilution of Hoechst 33258 (Sigma). Fluorescent images were captured using a Leica DMI 6000B widefield microscope or a Leica TCS SPE confocal microscope. For quantification of Neurog3 and Foxa2 levels, single confocal scans were analyzed using image J software. Briefly, Foxa2 and Neurog3 fluorescence intensities of >100 Neurog3 positive cells were quantified and normalized for each channel to the maximum intensity (100%) for each of the images. To assign cells a qualitative fluorescence intensity value (HIGH or LOW), cells displaying fluorescence levels over 60% were arbitrarily considered HIGH and vice versa, and plotted onto a bar chart. For statistics, linear regression analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism. Data are presented as means ± S.E. of the mean (S.E.). Statistical significance was tested using Student's t test. As a first step to locate cis-regulatory sequences potentially involved in Neurog3 autoregulation, we searched a 20 kb genomic region surrounding the mouse Neurog3 gene for evolutionarily conserved regions. We identified two areas that displayed extensive conservation throughout vertebrates: a ∼2 kb region located between −3 kb and −5 kb and a 0.3 kb region lying immediately upstream of the Neurog3 transcription initiation site (Fig. 1A). To define sequences potentially involved in Neurog3 autoregulation, we focused on the 5-kb region located upstream of the Neurog3 TSS and cloned 5′ deletion fragments of a 5 kb mouse Neurog3 genomic construct, depicted in Fig. 1A, in front of the luciferase gene. We used the pancreatic cell line mPAC and NIH3T3 fibroblasts, where positive and negative Neurog3 self-regulatory loops have been previously described (8Gasa R. Mrejen C. Leachman N. Otten M. Barnes M. Wang J. Chakrabarti S. Mirmira R. German M. Proendocrine genes coordinate the pancreatic islet differentiation program in vitro.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Neurogenin3 activates the islet differentiation program while repressing its own expression.Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 142-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), to test whether Neurog3 alone, or in conjunction with its dimeric partner E47, increased the transcriptional activity of these reporter vectors. We found that, in both cell types, Neurog3+E47 activated the 5kb Neurog3 promoter but were unable to do so when using the shorter promoter constructs containing 3 kb and 0.9 kb promoter fragments (Fig. 1, B and C). Altogether, our results demonstrate that Neurog3 can autoactivate its own expression and point to the distal conserved area (between −3 and −5 kb) as a required element in this autoregulatory loop. In agreement with these data, it is worth noting that sequences upstream from −2.6 kb have been shown to be necessary for high expression levels of a Neurog3 promoter-driven reporter gene construct in the embryonic pancreas of transgenic mice (12Lee J.C. Smith S.B. Watada H. Lin J. Scheel D. Wang J. Mirmira R.G. German M.S. Regulation of the pancreatic pro-endocrine gene neurogenin3.Diabetes. 2001; 50: 928-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Detailed homology analyses revealed that, within the ∼2 kb distal conserved region, sequences from −3.1 to −3.9 kb displayed the highest conservation (92%) between the mouse and human genes. Moreover, we located 8 E boxes as putative Neurog3 binding sites in this highly similar fragment, all of which were conserved between both species. To determine whether this region alone could mediate Neurog3 autoregulation, we cloned a 670-bp fragment (−3885 nt to −3217 nt) containing all 8 E boxes in front of the SV40 promoter and co-transfected it along with Neurog3 and/or E47 in mPAC cells. As depicted in Fig. 1D, Neurog3+E47 significantly stimulated the activity of the Neurog3 (−3885 to −3217)-SV40 heterologous promoter by 3.5-fold, thus confirming that this region alone (hereafter referred to as −3.2 kb cluster) confers Neurog3 responsiveness to a heterologous promoter. We next analyzed which E boxes in the −3.2 kb cluster were required for Neurog3 autoregulation. Given the high number of E boxes present in this region and the fact that bHLH factors exhibit preference for specific E box core sequences, we first determined which E box types are specifically activated by Neurog3. To this aim, we used ten different artificial enhancer luciferase reporter constructs containing three copies in tandem of each possible E box type, CANNTG (23Seo S. Lim J.W. Yellajoshyula D.

Malaria begins when Plasmodium sporozoites gain entry to the bloodstream via a bite from an infected mosquito, after which the parasite infects liver cells. During this liver stage infection, the 8-aminoquinoline, PQ (Fig. 1), acts as a hepatic schizontocide to clear infection (1Hill D.R. Baird J.K. Parise M.E. Lewis L.S. Ryan E.T. Magill A.J.

If left untreated, the parasites mature into merozoites and are released into the bloodstream to infect erythrocytes. In erythrocytes, the parasites either spawn into more merozoites or mature into gametocytes capable of infecting mosquitoes through additional bites. During the erythrocytic stage of infection, the 4-aminoquinoline, CQ (Fig. 1), acts as a blood schizontocide to clear infection (2Lalloo, D. G., Shingadia, D., Pasvol, G., Chiodini, P. L., Whitty, C. J., Beeching, N. J., Hill, D. R., Warrell, D. A., Bannister, B. A., and HPA Advisory Committee on Malaria Prevention in UK Travellers (2007) UK malaria treatment guidelines. J. Infect. 54, 111–121Google Scholar). As such, PQ and CQ are routine medications for treating malaria. In recent years, however, the emergence of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum has rendered CQ ineffective in most endemic areas. PQ, on the other hand, is still widely used as a prophylaxis of malaria because parasites rarely exhibit resistance against this drug. primaquine chloroquine quinone reductase 2 NQO2 oxidized form NQO2 reduced form dihydronicotinamide riboside 1-(3-sulfonatopropyl)-3-carbamoyl-1,4-dihydropyrimidine α-carbon. In terms of therapeutic mechanisms, PQ is thought to work by generating toxic oxygen species via its reactive metabolites (3Foley M. Tilley L. Quinoline antimalarials. Mechanisms of action and resistance and prospects for new agents.Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 79: 55-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). CQ, on the other hand, is thought to prevent a detoxification of excess heme in the parasite, which is generated as a result of its metabolism of hemoglobin (3Foley M. Tilley L. Quinoline antimalarials. Mechanisms of action and resistance and prospects for new agents.Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 79: 55-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Despite these findings, no protein target has been identified for either drug in the parasite, causing some controversy about the mode of action of the two drugs (4Fitch C.D. Ferriprotoporphyrin IX, phospholipids, and the antimalarial actions of quinoline drugs.Life Sci. 2004; 74: 1957-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 5Vale N. Moreira R. Gomes P. Primaquine revisited six decades after its discovery.Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2009; 44: 937-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This led Graves et al. (6Graves P.R. Kwiek J.J. Fadden P. Ray R. Hardeman K. Coley A.M. Foley M. Haystead T.A. Discovery of novel targets of quinoline drugs in the human purine binding proteome.Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1364-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) to search for target proteins of CQ and PQ using a proteomics approach. Surprisingly, no parasitic protein targets were identified; instead, two human proteins present in infected erythrocytes, quinone reductase 2 (NQO2) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 1, were identified. Of the two proteins, NQO2 was potently inhibited by concentrations of the quinoline drugs used in clinical treatment, whereas aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 was not. It is not known whether the inhibition of NQO2 by PQ and/or CQ plays a role in the antimalarial effects of the drugs. The identification of NQO2 as a human target of PQ and CQ is intriguing because both drugs are used to treat non-malarial diseases. For instance, PQ is used to treat pneumocystis pneumonia and is active against leishmaniasis and trypanosomiasis in vivo (7Benfield T. Atzori C. Miller R.F. Helweg-Larsen J.

Similarly, CQ is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erthosyma, and amoebic hepatitis; is under clinical trials for use in HIV-1/AIDS; and is being investigated for use in cancer chemotherapy (10Wallace D.J. Gudsoorkar V.S. Weisman M.H. Venuturupalli S.R. New insights into mechanisms of therapeutic effects of antimalarial agents in SLE.Nat. Rev.

Thus, the inhibition of NQO2 may contribute to the therapeutic effects of PQ and CQ against diseases other than malaria. NQO2 is a cytosolic and ubiquitously expressed metalloflavoprotein that catalyzes the two-electron reduction of quinone substrates. It has been the subject of extensive study over the last 15 years and binds a number of bioactive compounds, including imatinib (13Rix U. Hantschel O. Dürnberger G. Remsing Rix L.L. Planyavsky M.

J. 2008; 413: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); however, the only natural substrate identified is ubiquinone, and the physiological function of NQO2 is not understood (20Vella F. Ferry G. Delagrange P. Boutin J.A. NRH:quinone reductase 2. An enzyme of surprises and mysteries.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 71: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). NQO2 is a member of the thioredoxin family of enzymes but is unique in that it uses dihydronicotinamide riboside (NRH) as a reducing coenzyme rather than NADH or NADPH. The oxidized form of the co-enzyme, nicotinamide riboside, is involved in NAD metabolism (21Bogan K.L. Brenner C. Nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, and nicotinamide riboside. A molecular evaluation of NAD+ precursor vitamins in human nutrition.Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2008; 28: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), but the cellular source of the reduced form, NRH, is not known, and it is not clear why NQO2 has evolved to use NRH. In addition to an enzymatic role in quinone reduction, NQO2 stabilizes the p53 tumor suppressor against 20S proteasomal degradation in the presence of NRH (22Gong X. Kole L. Iskander K. Jaiswal A.K. NRH:quinone oxidoreductase 2 and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 protect tumor suppressor p53 against 20s proteasomal degradation leading to stabilization and activation of p53.Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 5380-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 23Khutornenko A.A. Roudko V.V. Chernyak B.V. Vartapetian A.B. Chumakov P.M. Evstafieva A.G. Pyrimidine biosynthesis links mitochondrial respiration to the p53 pathway.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 12828-12833Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NQO2 is capable of generating reactive oxygen species (24Reybier K. Perio P. Ferry G. Bouajila J. Delagrange P. Boutin J.A. Nepveu F. Insights into the redox cycle of human quinone reductase 2.Free Radic. Res. 2011; 45: 1184-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Yet the current understanding of NQO2 and its inhibition does not adequately explain the effects of PQ and CQ on malaria and non-malarial diseases. PQ and CQ inhibit NQO2 with different mechanisms. Kinetic studies show that PQ and CQ both inhibit NQO2 in the micromolar range, with KI values of 1.0 and 0.6 μm, respectively (25Kwiek J.J. Haystead T.A. Rudolph J. Kinetic mechanism of quinone oxidoreductase 2 and its inhibition by the antimalarial quinolines.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4538-4547Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), but PQ exhibits competitive inhibition against the reducing co-factor (NRH), whereas CQ competes with the quinone substrate. This pattern of inhibition can be explained by the ping-pong kinetic mechanism that NQO2 uses. The tightly bound FAD co-enzyme is first reduced by NRH to FADH2; nicotinamide riboside is replaced by the quinone substrate, which is then reduced by FADH2. As such, NQO2 can exist as either the oxidized (NQO2ox) or reduced (NQO2red) form, and inhibitors may have a higher affinity for one or the other. To provide a structural basis for the difference in specificity between PQ and CQ, we solved high resolution crystal structures of NQO2ox in complex with either PQ or CQ as well as NQO2red in complex with CQ. The NQO2red-CQ complex is particularly interesting because CQ is present in a completely different orientation compared with the NQO2ox-CQ complex, and this difference in binding is accompanied by movement of an active site loop, a change in crystal packing, and a change in space group symmetry. The structure of the NQO2red-CQ complex provides support for the idea that, in common with some other flavin-containing proteins (26Becker D.F. Zhu W. Moxley M.A. Flavin redox switching of protein functions.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; 14: 1079-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), NQO2 acts as a redox-sensitive “switch” that is responsive to the presence of cellular NRH in conjunction with binding of certain bioactive compounds. Recombinant NQO2 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (27Leung K.K. Litchfield D.W. Shilton B.H. Flavin adenine dinucleotide content of quinone reductase 2. Analysis and optimization for structure-function studies.Anal. Biochem. 2012; 420: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A critical step in the purification was full reconstitution of the enzyme with the FAD cofactor. When expressed in E. coli, recombinant NQO2 typically contains substoichiometric levels of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and no FAD. A partial denaturation of NQO2 and reconstitution with FAD was incorporated into the purification procedure, leading to full saturation of the enzyme with FAD, as reported previously (27Leung K.K. Litchfield D.W. Shilton B.H. Flavin adenine dinucleotide content of quinone reductase 2. Analysis and optimization for structure-function studies.Anal. Biochem. 2012; 420: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). NQO2ox was co-crystallized with 1 mm PQ or CQ by hanging drop vapor diffusion against reservoirs containing 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, and 1.3–2.0 m (NH4)2SO4. To prepare NQO2red-CQ crystals, crystals of NQO2-CQ were soaked in 1 μl of reducing-soak solution consisting of 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 2.0 m (NH4)2SO4, 10 mm 1-(3-sulfonatopropyl)-3-carbamoyl-1,4-dihydropyrimidine (SCDP; an NRH analog), and 1 mm chloroquine, for 2 min; the soak was repeated until crystals turned pale yellow. Whereas larger rod-shaped crystals (0.5 mm × 0.2 mm) cracked when introduced into the reducing soak, medium size crystals (0.3 mm × 0.1 mm) remained intact. The reduced crystals were transferred to a soak of 1 mm chloroquine, 2.0 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5, to decrease the of the amount of SCDP, which may be competitive with CQ at high concentrations. Crystals were then briefly passed through a cryoprotectant solution (20% glycerol, 2.0 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 m Hepes, pH 7.5) and plunged into liquid nitrogen. To prevent autoxidation of NQO2, the entire crystal mounting process from harvesting to cryocooling was performed under an anoxic atmosphere in a glove bag purged with N2. To prepare for the reduction protocol, the glove bag was initially evacuated and flushed with nitrogen for 5 min. All soaking solutions were then deoxygenated by sparging with nitrogen gas inside the glove bag. In the dry nitrogen atmosphere, crystals and crystal soak solutions quickly evaporated; therefore, to maintain an appropriate level of humidity, the nitrogen used to flush the glove bag was bubbled through a flask of crystallization reservoir solution (0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 2.0 m (NH4)2SO4). Data were collected at the CMCF-1 beamline of the Canadian Light Source, processed using XDS (28Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11228) Google Scholar) or MOSFLM (29Leslie A.G.W. Powell H.R. Processing diffraction data with Mosflm.Evolving Methods Macromol. Crystallogr. 2007; 245: 41-51Crossref Google Scholar), and merged using Scala (30Evans P. Scaling and assessment of data quality.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3745) Google Scholar). The structures were solved by molecular replacement with Protein Data Bank entry 1QR2 as a starting model (31Foster C.E. Bianchet M.A. Talalay P. Zhao Q. Amzel L.M. Crystal structure of human quinone reductase type 2, a metalloflavoprotein.Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9881-9886Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar); refinement was carried out using PHENIX (32Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J. Hung L.W. Kapral G.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Oeffner R. Read R.J. Richardson D.C. Richardson J.S. Terwilliger T.C. Zwart P.H. PHENIX. A comprehensive Python-based system for macromolecular structure solution.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (16436) Google Scholar). Given the high resolution of the crystallographic data, NCS restraints were not used for any of the refinements. Topology files for PQ and CQ were generated using PHENIX.ELBOW in conjunction with small molecule crystal structures of the two compounds (33Rubin J.R. Swaminathan P. Sundaralingam M. Structure of the anti-malarial drug primaquine diphosphate.Acta Crystallogr. C. 1992; 48: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 34Karle J.M. Karle I.L. Redetermination of the crystal and molecular structure of the antimalarial chloroquine bis(dihydrogenphosphate) dihydrate.Acta Crystallogr. C. 1988; 44: 1605-1608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For refinement of the NQO2red structure, the FAD topology file was modified to allow bending along the N5–N10 axis of FAD: the planarity restraints incorporating N5 and N10 of the isoalloxazine ring were removed so that it was separated into two planes, one incorporating the pyrimidine ring and the second incorporating the benzyl ring. Also, the bond length, bond angle, and dihedral angle restraints involving N5 and N10 were removed. The degree of bending in the isoalloxazine ring was calculated by finding equations for the two planes using principal component analysis incorporating all atoms in each of the two planes. The final structures for NQO2ox-PQ, NQO2ox-CQ, and NQO2red-CQ were deposited in the Protein Data Bank as 4FGJ, 4FGK, and 4FGL respectively. To validate the observed changes in FAD structure and, in particular, to assess the contribution of the FAD and FADH2 stereochemical restraint files to the structure of the isoalloxazine ring, each model was refined using an identical simulated annealing strategy with the FADH2 stereochemical restraint file to assess the degree of bending along the N5–N10 axis. In each case, the refinement was performed three times using the same starting model with a different random seed to calculate a final average bending angle. To ensure an “active” convergence to an optimal conformation, FAD in the starting model of NQO2 was bent to an angle of ∼30°. NQO2 was co-crystallized with PQ in space group P212121. Crystals of NQO2-PQ diffracted to 1.35 Å and contained a homodimer in the asymmetric unit; the structure was solved by molecular replacement and refined to an Rfree value of 0.167 (Table 1). Primaquine was initially modeled in a single orientation in both active sites of the homodimer (Fig. 2a), and after several rounds of refinement, a second orientation was incorporated to fully account for the electron density (Fig. 2b). The occupancies for bound PQ molecules refined to values of ∼0.5 for each of the conformations, indicating that PQ binds with roughly equal affinity in each mode. In both orientations, the quinoline ring of PQ is buried in the active site, making planar stacking interactions with the FAD isoalloxazine ring and the phenyl ring of Phe178. PQ also makes contact with additional aromatic residues (Trp105, Phe106, and Phe126), which form the interior wall of the active site. As well, both orientations of PQ make a water-mediated hydrogen bond with the side chain of Asn161. In the first orientation of PQ (Fig. 2a), a water molecule (position 557 in A chain and 450 in B chain) mediates hydrogen bonding between the aromatic nitrogen in the quinoline ring and the side chain of Asn161. In the alternate orientation (Fig. 2b), the quinoline ring is flipped 180°, and the water molecule mediates a hydrogen bond between the 6-methoxy group of PQ and the side chain of Asn161.TABLE 1Crystallographic data collection and refinement statisticsOxidized NQO2 crystalReduced NQO2 crystal (chloroquine ligand)Primaquine ligandChloroquine ligandWavelength (Å)1.0332171.0332170.97949Space groupP212121P212121P21Unit cell dimensions (Å)56.5, 83.0, 106.556.37, 83.11, 106.654.31, 105.71, 82.00 β = 90.17°Resolution30.1-1.3532.7-1.4048.3-1.20RsymaValues in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell.0.066 (0.63)0.065 (0.50)0.041 (0.288)I/σ(I)aValues in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell.10.4 (2.4)14.5 (3.7)19.3 (4.4)CompletenessaValues in parentheses refer to the highest resolution shell.99.5 (98.8)99.6 (99.0)99.8 (99.9)Redundancy4.87.33.7Unique reflections110,79398,537287,298Rwork/Rfree0.1413/0.16660.1325/0.17450.1059/0.1362Ramachandran plotbRamachandran plot statistics were calculated using PROCHECK (53).

Open table in a new tab NQO2 catalysis proceeds by a ping-pong mechanism. The reducing co-factor, NRH, binds in the active site, reduces the FAD, and then dissociates; the quinone substrate then enters the active site and undergoes a two-electron reduction. Thus, NQO2 can exist in either an oxidized (NQO2ox) or reduced (NQO2red) state, and inhibitors of NOQ2 will exhibit a preference for one or the other. Kinetic studies indicate that CQ exhibits competitive inhibition against the quinone substrate and therefore binds preferentially to NQO2red (25Kwiek J.J. Haystead T.A. Rudolph J. Kinetic mechanism of quinone oxidoreductase 2 and its inhibition by the antimalarial quinolines.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4538-4547Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, high concentrations of CQ will also compete against the reducing co-enzyme, NRH, indicating that CQ also has affinity with NQO2ox. To fully characterize CQ binding to NQO2, we co-crystallized NQO2ox in complex with CQ. CQ-NQO2ox crystals diffracted to 1.4 Å, and the structure was refined to an Rfree of 0.175 (Table 1). Electron density for the bound CQ was initially quite poor, but a large peak (greater than 10σ) in the difference (Fo − Fc) electron density map was used to position the CQ chlorine atom, after which the rest of the CQ molecule was placed in the remaining electron density. For the “A” subunit of the homodimer, CQ is present in one position, with the quinoline ring less deeply buried than primaquine and the aminopentane arm projecting toward the solvent (Fig. 2c). In the active site of the “B” subunit, additional difference density was observed after several rounds of manual adjustment and refinement, and an alternate orientation of CQ was modeled into the structure (Fig. 2d). The occupancies for the two modes of CQ binding to the B subunit refined to 0.52 and 0.48. In conjunction with these two positions for CQ, an active site loop consisting of residues 126–136 was modeled in two different conformations (Fig. 2e). In the position of CQ unique to the B subunit, in which the quinoline ring is more deeply buried in the active site, the bulky aminopentane arm of CQ interferes with the ability of the 126–136 loop to close over the active site, and therefore the loop adopts an “open” conformation (Fig. 2e). There is no evidence of cooperative interactions or nonequivalence between the two subunits of NQO2, and therefore this minor difference in CQ binding between the A and B subunits probably originates from different crystal packing environments. The reduced form of NQO2 (NQO2red) was not sufficiently stable to allow for co-crystallization with CQ. To obtain crystals of NQO2red in complex with CQ, crystals of NQO2ox-CQ were treated with SCDP (an NRH analog) in an anoxic environment until the crystal was bleached, indicating reduction of FAD to FADH2, and then frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen for data collection. Data from three such crystals of NQO2red-CQ were collected and processed (Table 2). In all three cases, the crystallographic data for NQO2red could be processed using the P212121 space group, with unit cell dimensions ∼1 Å shorter in all three directions compared with those for NQO2ox-CQ. However, data processed in P212121 yielded unacceptably high Rsym values, making it clear that the crystals had undergone a structural transition to a lower symmetry space group with four rather than two protomers in the asymmetric unit. Data processed and merged in P21 yielded acceptable Rsym values (Table 2), and the highest resolution data set was used for refinement and analysis (Table 1). The NQO2 structure underwent several rounds of manual rebuilding and refinement to yield an Rfree of 0.17. Analysis of the crystallographic data indicated the presence of pseudomerohedral twinning, and further refinement in Phenix using the twin operator (h, −k, −l) yielded an estimated twin fraction of 0.15, with a final Rfree value of 0.136 and improved electron density maps. This is the first structure of a reduced quinone reductase, and the combined effects of FAD reduction and chloroquine binding are described below.TABLE 2Space group change upon reduction of NQO2-chloroquine crystalsCrystal 1aCrystals of NQO2ox in complex with chloroquine were soaked with SCDP, an NRH analogue, to effect reduction of the FAD cofactor.

In this study, we investigated whether vasomotor dysfunction develops in AngII-infused ApoE−/− mice and the underlying mechanism involved. Methods ApoE−/− mice were infused with vehicle (distilled water) or AngII subcutaneously for 14 days. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured using the non-invasive tail cuff method. Aortic vascular reactivity and expression of key proteins (endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), phospho-eNOS and caveolin-1) were assessed using tension myography and Western blotting respectively. Plasma nitric oxide (NO) level was estimated using a colorimetric assay. Results AngII infusion caused a time-dependent increase in blood pressure (P<0.001). Aortas from AngII-infused mice were significantly less responsive to acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation when compared to aortas from mice infused with vehicle control (P<0.05). Contractile responses to phenylephrine (P<0.01) and potassium chloride (P<0.001) were significantly enhanced in aortas from AngII-infused mice. eNOS phosphorylation was significantly decreased in the aorta of AngII-infused mice (P<0.05). Aortic caveolin-1 protein expression was significantly increased in AngII-infused mice (P<0.05). Plasma nitrate/nitrite level was significantly reduced in AngII-infused mice (P<0.05). Pharmacological disruption of caveolae using methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) in isolated aortas from AngII-infused mice caused a significant leftward shift of the acetylcholine-induced relaxation concentration-response curve when compared to vehicle control (P<0.05). Conclusion Upregulation of caveolin-1 protein expression and reduced NO bioavailability contributes to aortic endothelial dysfunction in AngII-infused ApoE−/− mice."
https://openalex.org/W2017272070,"Activity in the ventral striatum has frequently been associated with retrieval success, i.e., it is higher for hits than correct rejections. Based on the prominent role of the ventral striatum in the reward circuit, its activity has been interpreted to reflect the higher subjective value of hits compared to correct rejections in standard recognition tests. This hypothesis was supported by a recent study showing that ventral striatal activity is higher for correct rejections than hits when the value of rejections is increased by external incentives. These findings imply that the striatal response during recognition is context-sensitive and modulated by the adaptive significance of ""oldness"" or ""newness"" to the current goals. The present study is based on the idea that not only external incentives, but also other deviations from standard recognition tests which affect the subjective value of specific response types should modulate striatal activity. Therefore, we explored ventral striatal activity in an unusually difficult recognition test that was characterized by low levels of confidence and accuracy. Based on the human uncertainty aversion, in such a recognition context, the subjective value of all high confident decisions is expected to be higher than usual, i.e., also rejecting items with high certainty is deemed rewarding. In an accompanying behavioural experiment, participants rated the pleasantness of each recognition response. As hypothesized, ventral striatal activity correlated in the current unusually difficult recognition test not only with retrieval success, but also with confidence. Moreover, participants indicated that they were more satisfied by higher confidence in addition to perceived oldness of an item. Taken together, the results are in line with the hypothesis that ventral striatal activity during recognition codes the subjective value of different response types that is modulated by the context of the recognition test."

Several v-SNAREs have a Longin N-terminal extension that, by promoting a closed conformation, plays an autoinhibitory function and decreases SNARE complex formation and membrane fusion efficiency. The molecular mechanism leading to Longin v-SNARE activation is largely unknown. Here we find that exocytosis mediated by the Longin v-SNARE TI-VAMP/VAMP7 is activated by tonic treatment with insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 but not by depolarization and intracellular calcium rise. In search of a potential downstream mechanism, we found that TI-VAMP is phosphorylated in vitro by c-Src kinase on tyrosine 45 of the Longin domain. Accordingly, a mutation of tyrosine 45 into glutamate, but not phenylalanine, activates both t-SNARE binding and exocytosis.

https://openalex.org/W2045698719,"ERG, a member of the ETS transcription factor family, is frequently overexpressed in prostate cancer as a result of its fusion to the androgen-responsive Tmprss2 gene. Different genomic rearrangements and alternative splicing events around the junction region lead to multiple combination of Tmprss2:ERG fusion transcripts that correlate with different tumor aggressiveness, but their specific functions and biological activities are still unclear. The complexity of ERG expression pattern is compounded by the use of alternative promoters, splice sites, polyadenylation sites and translation initiation sites in both the native and fusion contexts. Our systematic characterization of native ERG and Tmprss2:ERG variants reveals that their different oncogenic potential is impacted by the status of the Ets domain and the configuration of the 5′ UTR region. In particular, expression and activity of functional ERG and Tmprss2:ERG variants are influenced both by translation initiation signals within the different isoforms and by inhibitory upstream Open Reading Frames (uORF) in their 5′ UTRs. Stable expression of ERG and Tmprss2:ERG variants promoted cell migration/invasion, induced a block of proliferation and induced a senescence-like state, suggesting a role for these variants in the prostate tumorigenesis process. In addition to Tmprss2:ERG fusion products, a group of related native ERG isoforms is also highly over-expressed in fusion-carrying prostate cancers, and share the same translation initiation site (in ERG exon 4) with the commonly observed Tmprss2 exon1 joined to ERG exon 4 (T1:E4) fusion-derived variant. Usage of this ATG can be preferentially down-regulated by directed antisense-based compounds, possibly representing the basis of a targeted approach that distinguishes between tumor–associated and normal ERG."

Phosphorylation of Whi3 by PKA led to its decreased interaction with CLN3 G1 cyclin mRNA and was required for the promotion of G1/S progression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the phosphomimetic S568D mutation of Whi3 prevented the developmental fate switch to sporulation or invasive growth.

https://openalex.org/W2084106804,"Proteins that form ion-selective pores in the membrane of cells are integral to many rapid signaling processes, including regulating the rhythm of the heartbeat. In potassium channels, the selectivity filter is critical for both endowing an exquisite selectivity for potassium ions, as well as for controlling the flow of ions through the pore. Subtle rearrangements in the complex hydrogen-bond network that link the selectivity filter to the surrounding pore helices differentiate conducting (open) from nonconducting (inactivated) conformations of the channel. Recent studies suggest that beyond the selectivity filter, inactivation involves widespread rearrangements of the channel protein. Here, we use rate equilibrium free energy relationship analysis to probe the structural changes that occur during selectivity filter gating in Kv11.1 channels, at near atomic resolution. We show that the pore helix plays a crucial dynamic role as a bidirectional interface during selectivity filter gating. We also define the molecular bases of the energetic coupling between the pore helix and outer helix of the pore domain that occurs early in the transition from open to inactivated states, as well as the coupling between the pore helix and inner helix late in the transition. Our data demonstrate that the pore helices are more than just static structural elements supporting the integrity of the selectivity filter; instead they play a crucial dynamic role during selectivity filter gating."
https://openalex.org/W2093629921,"Intimal injury rapidly activates TGFβ and enhances vascular repair by the growth of endothelial (EC) and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). The response to the TGFβ family of growth factors can be modified by BAMBI (BMP, Activin, Membrane Bound Inhibitor) acting as a non-signaling, competitive antagonist of TGFβ type I receptors such as ALK 1 and 5. In vivo the effect of BAMBI will depend on its cell-specific expression and of that of the ALK type receptors. We recently reported EC restricted BAMBI expression and genetic elimination of BAMBI resulting in an in vitro and in vivo phenotype characterized by endothelial activation and proliferation involving alternative pathway activation by TGFβ through ALK 1.To test the hypothesis that BAMBI modulates arterial response to injury via its effects on endothelial repair and arterial wall neovascularization we used a model of femoral arterial denudation injury in wild type (WT) and BAMBI(-/-) mice. Arterial response was evaluated at 2 and 4 weeks after luminal endothelial denudation of femoral arteries. The BAMBI(-/-) genotype mice showed accelerated luminal endothelial repair at 2 weeks and a highly unusual increase in arterial wall neovascularization compared to WT mice. The exuberant intimal and medial neovessel formation with BAMBI(-/-) genotype was also associated with significant red blood cell extravasation. The bleeding into the neointima at 2 weeks transiently increased it's area in the BAMBI(-/-)genotype despite the faster luminal endothelial repair in this group. Vascular smooth muscle cells were decreased at 2 weeks in BAMBI(-/-) mice, but comparable to wild type at 4 weeks.The absence of BAMBI results in a highly unusual surge in arterial wall neovascularization that surprisingly mimiks features of intra-plaque hemorrhage of advanced atheroma in a mechanical injury model. This suggests important effects of BAMBI on arterial EC homeostasis that need to be further studied in a model of inflammatory atherosclerosis."

Among various protein modifications, much attention has recently been paid to the cysteine-targeted oxidation in regulation of protein function under stress conditions. Protein cysteine residues are highly susceptible to various types of oxidation. Sulfenic acid (–SOH) is the initial product of cysteine oxidation and is a key intermediate in the functional modulation of enzymes and proteins. Under variant biochemical circumstances, it may serve to mediate redox signaling (12Poole L.B. Karplus P.A. Claiborne A. Protein sulfenic acids in redox signaling.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Although sulfenic acid is likely to represent a dynamic and transient oxidation product, its unique chemistry allows it to be captured by dimedone-based labeling reagents before progressing to a potentially more complex array of disulfide-bonded or oxidized products (e.g. sulfinic acid (–SO2H) and sulfonic acid (–SO3H)) (14Nelson K.J.

We found that only three cysteine residues, Cys-183, Cys-205, and Cys-323, are structurally fully exposed. Given the antioxidant capacity of the cysteine thiol group, we hypothesized that these exposed cysteine residues in maspin may act as potent scavengers/quenchers of ROS. In this study, we provide evidence that maspin indeed acts as a ROS scavenger. Maspin-overexpressing cells are more resistant to oxidative stress, and this property is attributed to the cysteine residues in maspin. Maspin x-ray crystal structures were reported by Law et al.

HRP-labeled goat anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody was used as a secondary antibody, and proteins were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce).

Briefly, 106 cells in a 6-well dish were plated and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The next day, the culture medium was discarded, and cells were washed twice with PBS, followed by incubation with 20 μm carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate at 37 °C for 30 min in serum-free medium.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8186-8197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with cold PBS, scraped, and kept for 30 min on ice. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Pellets were either stored at −80 °C or immediately processed for HPLC analysis. Cells were lysed using 0.1% Triton X-100 in Dulbecco's PBS. Cell lysates were mixed with an equal amount of 0.2 m solution of HClO4 in MeOH and left undisturbed for 2 h to allow protein precipitation. Samples were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and 100 μl of supernatant was mixed with an equal amount of a 1 m solution of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 2.6). After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, samples were analyzed by HPLC-MS. The instrumental setup for the analysis of HE and its oxidation products by HPLC-MS is depicted in supplemental Table 2. HPLC peak areas were normalized to protein concentration. Adhesion of mouse mammary TM40DNeo cells to Matrigel matrix (BD Biosciences) was used to determine the biological activity of recombinant proteins. The adhesion assay was performed as described by Corbett et al. (26Corbett S.A. Wilson C.L. Schwarzbauer J.E. Changes in cell spreading and cytoskeletal organization are induced by adhesion to a fibronectin-fibrin matrix.Blood. 1996; 88: 158-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were suspended in medium containing 100 nm maspin (GST-MpWT and GST-MpT) or GST and then cultured on a Matrigel-coated 96-well plate at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in triplicates for 4 h. The plates were washed twice with PBS and incubated with 50 μl of hexosaminidase substrate (3.75 mm 4-nitrophenyl N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide, 0.25% Triton X-100, and 0.05 m citrate buffer (pH 5)) for 1.5 h at 37 °C. After incubation, 75 μl of development buffer (5 mm EDTA and 50 mm glycine (pH 10.4)) was added, and readings were recorded at 405 nm. A luminescence-based system was used for detection and quantification of GSH/GSSG ratios in cultured cells (Promega V6611). Detection of protein sulfenic acid in vitro was done as described previously (14Nelson K.J. Klomsiri C. Codreanu S.G. Soito L. Liebler D.C. Rogers L.C. Daniel L.W. Poole L.B.

Briefly, equal amounts (62.5 ng) of thrombin-cleaved recombinant MpWT and MpT were oxidized with H2O2 (1 mm) for 1 min in the presence of dimedone (10 mm). The oxidation of cysteine residues was detected by Western blot analysis using an antibody (Millipore 07-2139) that specifically recognizes dimedone-derivatized cysteine sulfenic acid residues. Cells were first treated with H2O2 (250 μm) for 3 h and then lysed in lysis buffer (100 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor mixture) with or without dimedone (10 mm) for 45 min before the addition of N-ethylmaleimide to a final concentration of 100 mm for another 10 min. Cellular debris was cleared from lysates by centrifugation, and protein concentration was determined by the BCA protein assay. Whole cell extracts (1 mg) were incubated overnight (constant rocking) with 0.5 μg of rabbit anti-maspin antibody AbS4A (3Zou Z. Anisowicz A. Hendrix M.J. Thor A. Neveu M. Sheng S. Rafidi K.

Protein A-Sepharose-coupled beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C under constant agitation. Beads were centrifuged, washed briefly with ice-cold lysis buffer, and finally incubated with elution buffer for 15 min at room temperature. Samples were mixed with 5× nonreducing buffer; separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels; transferred to a PVDF membrane; and probed for maspin, cysteine sulfenic acid, and IgG. Appropriate secondary antibodies were added, and proteins were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence substrate. The anti-cysteine sulfenic acid antibody (Millipore 07-2139) used recognizes proteins containing dimedone-bound cysteine sulfenic acid. As described previously (28Sabherwal Y. Mahajan N. Helseth D.L. Gassmann M. Shi H. Zhang M. PDEF downregulates stathmin expression in prostate cancer.Int. J. Oncol. 2012; 40: 1889-1899PubMed Google Scholar), 6-well dishes were plated with the bottom agar (0.7% agarose) for 30 min. Cells were mixed with the top agar (0.3% agarose) at a concentration of 5 × 104 cells/well and allowed to solidify. The cells were fed every fifth day with medium and grown at 37 °C for 3 weeks. Cells were stained for 1 h with 0.05% crystal violet, and the numbers of purple-colored colonies were counted as 10 fields/well at ×40 using ImageJ software with a cutoff range of 20–5000 pixels. Cells were seeded at 103 cells/well in a 96-well plate and allowed to grow at 37 °C with 5% CO2. At each time point, MTT reagent (5 mg/ml) was added in a volume of 10 μl/well and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 3 h. The medium was aspirated, and 100 μl of Me2SO was added and mixed until a uniform purple color was formed. The cell samples were measured using a plate reader at 570 nm. Assays were performed in triplicates. Protein lysates (30 μg) were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and a PhosphoPlus kit (Cell Signaling Technology 9100) was used to determine ERK1/2 phosphorylation. All experiments were carried out three times or as stated. Quantification of Western blots was performed using Scion Image. Statistical analysis (two-tailed t test) was based on a minimum of three replicates using Prism statistical software. The differences were considered significant if p < 0.05. To understand the role of maspin in oxidative stress, we isolated primary mammary epithelial cells from WT and heterozygous maspin KO mice and measured their ROS levels. Fig. 1A depicts the Western blot analysis for maspin expression in cells isolated from WT and heterozygous maspin KO mice. We observed that the cells isolated from maspin KO mice had significantly higher intracellular ROS levels compared with WT mice (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1B). We also observed a significant increase in ROS production in KO cells compared with WT cells when they were pretreated with H2O2 for 3 h (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1C). To further analyze the importance of maspin in ROS production, we used maspin-silenced MCF-10A cells (MCF-10A229), which, as confirmed by Western blot analysis, showed attenuated levels of maspin (Fig. 1D). MCF-10A cells displayed significantly lower levels of ROS compared with maspin-silenced MCF-10A229 cells (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1E). Collectively, these results indicate that the presence of maspin in primary and immortalized mammary epithelial cells makes them more efficient to quench ROS and therefore indicate the importance of maspin in ROS regulation. To directly target the importance of maspin in oxidative stress, we used the mouse mammary epithelial cell line TM40D, which expresses low levels of maspin, as a cellular model (Fig. 2A). Maspin was overexpressed in TM40D cells (Fig. 2A), and total intracellular ROS levels were measured. Our results demonstrate that exposure for 3 h to 250 μm H2O2 was sufficient to induce a significant increase in intracellular ROS in TM40DNeo cells compared with maspin-overexpressing TM40DMp cells (p < 0.001) (Fig. 2B). To determine the physiological relevance or the effect of endogenous ROS on mammary epithelial cells, we used antimycin A, a compound that inhibits electron transport at complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, thereby inducing the production of superoxide and other ROS in the cells (29Aghajanian A. Wittchen E.S. Campbell S.L. Burridge K. Direct activation of RhoA by reactive oxygen species requires a redox-sensitive motif.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e8045Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 30Hoffman D.L. Brookes P.S. Oxygen sensitivity of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation depends on metabolic conditions.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 16236-16245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Treating cells with antimycin A resulted in decreased ROS levels in maspin-overexpressing cells (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2C). In addition, HE was used to determine the O2̇̄ levels as an indicator of oxidative stress in response to an alternative ROS inducer, i.e. STS, by HPLC-MS in TM40DNeo and TM40DMp cells. Fig. 2D depicts the schematic representation of the reaction of HE and superoxide radical anion (O2̇̄) to form 2-hydroxyethidium. We observed a significant decrease in the levels of superoxide in maspin-overexpressing cells compared with TM40DNeo cells in response STS treatment (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2E). Having established that maspin is involved in modulating oxidative stress in normal mammary epithelial and cancer cells, we further sought to identify the underlying mechanism of maspin action. Due to the presence of an active thiol (–SH) group, cysteine residues play an important role as oxidative stress sensors in various proteins (12Poole L.B. Karplus P.A. Claiborne A. Protein sulfenic acids in redox signaling.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2004; 44: 325-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 13Poole L.B. Nelson K.J. Discovering mechanisms of signaling-mediated cysteine oxidation.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2008; 12: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Using Molsoft ICM-Pro version 3.48, we analyzed the x-ray structure of human maspin protein (Protein Data Bank code 1XU8) reported by Law et al. (16Law R.H. Irving J.A. Buckle A.M. Ruzyla K. Buzza M. Bashtannyk-Puhalovich T.A. Beddoe T.C. Nguyen K. Worrall D.M. Bottomley S.P. Bird P.I. Rossjohn J. Whisstock J.C. The high resolution crystal structure of the human tumor suppressor maspin reveals a novel conformational switch in the G-helix.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22356-22364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We identified that of eight cysteine residues present in human maspin, only three residues at positions 183, 205, and 323 are structurally exposed and might serve as possible sites for oxidation. In contrast, cysteine residues at positions 20, 34, 214, 287, and 373 are buried. Previously, it has been shown that mutating all of the cysteines to serine/alanine by site-directed mutagenesis does not change the structure of maspin (17Al-Ayyoubi M. Gettins P.G. Volz K. Crystal structure of human maspin, a serpin with antitumor properties. Reactive center loop of maspin is exposed but constrained.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55540-55544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, we mutated either single cysteine residues (Cys-183 or Cys-323) or all three exposed cysteine residues to serine. Fig. 3A shows the three-dimensional structure of maspin with the three structurally exposed cysteine residues (Cys-183, Cys-205, and Cys-323). TM40D cells were transfected with different maspin cysteine mutants, and expression of maspin was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B). Mutating a single cysteine residue, i.e. Cys-183 or Cys-323, individually in maspin led to a 2-fold increase in ROS levels in comparison with TM40DMp cells (Fig. 3C), suggesting that both of these cysteine residues are equally important in regulating cellular ROS. When all three surface cysteines were mutated, the cellular ROS level in TM40DT cells was further increased (∼1.4-fold) compared with TM40DC183S or TM40DC323S cells (p < 0.05) (Fig. 3C). Increased ROS levels in TM40DT cells correlated with the absence of surface-exposed cysteine residues, thereby establishing the importance of maspin cysteine residues in modulating ROS. Enzymes such as those involved in the glutathione redox cycle play an important role in detoxification of various oxidant species (31Kulinskiĭ V.I. Kolesnichenko L.S. Glutathione system. I. Synthesis, transport, glutathione transferases, glutathione peroxidases.Biomed. Khim. 2009; 55: 255-277PubMed Google Scholar). A decreased GSH/GSSG ratio is considered indicative of increased oxidative stress (32Xiao G.G. Wang M. Li N. Loo J.A. Nel A.E. Use of proteomics to demonstrate a hierarchical oxidative stress response to diesel exhaust particle chemicals in a macrophage cell line.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50781-50790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 33Serru V. Baudin B. Ziegler F. David J.P. Cals M.J. Vaubourdolle M. Mario N. Quantification of reduced and oxidized glutathione in whole blood samples by capillary electrophoresis.Clin. Chem. 2001; 47: 1321-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We found that overexpression of maspin in TM40D cells resulted in an increased GSH/GSSG ratio (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3D). However, expressing triple-mutant maspin in TM40D cells resulted in a decreased GSH/GSSG ratio compared with cells expressing WT maspin in the absence of ROS stimulus (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3D). To confirm that mutant maspin retains its normal biological activity, we tested whether the triple-mutant recombinant maspin (GST-MpT) could increase cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix similar to the WT maspin protein (GST-MpWT). Increased adhesion of TM40DNeo cells to Matrigel matrix was observed when cells were pretreated with GST-MpT compared with its control (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4A). To elucidate whether selected cysteine residues of maspin trap free radicals or other oxidants, WT and triple-mutant recombinant maspin proteins were treated with H2O2 in presence or absence of dimedone. Dimedone is a highly specific agent that reacts with cysteine sulfenic acid (14Nelson K.J. Klomsiri C. Codreanu S.G. Soito L. Liebler D.C. Rogers L.C. Daniel L.W. Poole L.B.

https://openalex.org/W1989104276,"Lack of understanding of the response of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to anticancer drugs causes the high mortality of HCC patients. Bleomycin (BLM) that induces DNA damage is clinically used for cancer therapy, while the mechanism underlying BLM-induced DNA damage response (DDR) in HCC cells remains ambiguous. Given that 14-3-3 proteins are broadly involved in regulation of diverse biological processes (BPs)/pathways, we investigate how a 14-3-3 isoform coordinates particular BPs/pathways in BLM-induced DDR in HCC.Using dual-tagging quantitative proteomic approach, we dissected the 14-3-3ε interactome formed during BLM-induced DDR, which revealed that 14-3-3ε via its associations with multiple pathway-specific proteins coordinates multiple pathways including chromosome remodeling, DNA/RNA binding/processing, DNA repair, protein ubiquitination/degradation, cell cycle arrest, signal transduction and apoptosis. Further, ""zoom-in"" investigation of the 14-3-3ε interacting network indicated that the BLM-induced interaction between 14-3-3ε and a MAP kinase TAK1 plays a critical role in determining cell propensity of apoptosis. Functional characterization of this interaction further revealed that BLM triggers site-specific phosphorylations in the kinase domain of TAK1. These BLM-induced changes of phosphorylations directly correlate to the strength of the TAK1 binding to 14-3-3ε, which govern the phosphorylation-dependent TAK1 activation. The enhanced 14-3-3ε-TAK1 association then inhibits the anti-apoptotic activity of TAK1, which ultimately promotes BLM-induced apoptosis in HCC cells. In a data-dependent manner, we then derived a mechanistic model where 14-3-3ε plays the pivotal role in integrating diverse biological pathways for cellular DDR to BLM in HCC.Our data demonstrated on a systems view that 14-3-3ε coordinates multiple biological pathways involved in BLM-induced DDR in HCC cells. Specifically, 14-3-3ε associates with TAK1 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner to determine the cell fate of BLM-treated HCC cells. Not only individual proteins but also those critical links in the network could be the potential targets for BLM-mediated therapeutic intervention of HCC."
https://openalex.org/W1993556734,"Prostate Secretory Protein of 94 amino acids (PSP94) is one of the major proteins present in the human seminal plasma. Though several functions have been predicted for this protein, its exact role either in sperm function or in prostate pathophysiology has not been clearly defined. Attempts to understand the mechanism of action of PSP94 has led to the search for its probable binding partners. This has resulted in the identification of PSP94 binding proteins in plasma and seminal plasma from human. During the chromatographic separation step of proteins from human seminal plasma by reversed phase HPLC, we had observed that in addition to the main fraction of PSP94, other fractions containing higher molecular weight proteins also showed the presence of detectable amounts of PSP94. This prompted us to hypothesize that PSP94 could be present in the seminal plasma complexed with other protein/s of higher molecular weight. One such fraction containing a major protein of ~47 kDa, on characterization by mass spectrometric analysis, was identified to be Prostatic Acid Phosphatase (PAP). The ability of PAP present in this fraction to bind to PSP94 was demonstrated by affinity chromatography. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed the presence of PSP94-PAP complex both in the fraction studied and in the fresh seminal plasma. In silico molecular modeling of the PSP94-PAP complex suggests that β-strands 1 and 6 of PSP94 appear to interact with domain 2 of PAP, while β-strands 7 and 10 with domain 1 of PAP. This is the first report which suggests that PSP94 can bind to PAP and the PAP-bound PSP94 is present in human seminal plasma."
https://openalex.org/W2026077537,"The process of quantum measurement has been a long standing source of debate. A measurement is postulated to collapse a wavefunction onto one of the states of a predetermined set - the measurement basis. This basis origin is not specified within quantum mechanics. According to the theory of decohernce, a measurement basis is singled out by the nature of coupling of a quantum system to its environment. Here we show how a measurement basis emerges in the evolution of the electronic spin of a single trapped atomic ion due to spontaneous photon scattering. Using quantum process tomography we visualize the projection of all spin directions, onto this basis, as a photon is scattered. These basis spin states are found to be aligned with the scattered photon propagation direction. In accordance with decohernce theory, they are subjected to a minimal increase in entropy due to the photon scattering, while, orthogonal states become fully mixed and their entropy is maximally increased. Moreover, we show that detection of the scattered photon polarization measures the spin state of the ion, in the emerging basis, with high fidelity. Lastly, we show that while photon scattering entangles all superpositions of pointer states with the scattered photon polarization, the measurement-basis states themselves remain classically correlated with it. Our findings show that photon scattering by atomic spin superpositions fulfils all the requirements from a quantum measurement process."
https://openalex.org/W2073647477,"Recent evidences have demonstrated that the presence of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIV) may play an important role in host ecology and transmission of avian influenza viruses (AIV). While some authors have clearly demonstrated that LPAIV can mutate to render highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV), others have shown that their presence could provide the host with enough immunological memory to resist re-infections with HPAIV. In order to experimentally study the role of pre-existing host immunity, chickens previously infected with H7N2 LPAIV were subsequently challenged with H7N1 HPAIV. Pre-infection of chickens with H7N2 LAPIV conferred protection against the lethal challenge with H7N1 HPAIV, dramatically reducing the viral shedding, the clinical signs and the pathological outcome. Correlating with the protection afforded, sera from chickens primed with H7N2 LPAIV reacted with the H7-AIV subtype in hemagglutination inhibition assay and specifically with the N2-neuraminidase antigen. Conversely, subsequent exposure to H5N1 HPAIV resulted in a two days-delay on the onset of disease but all chickens died by 7 days post-challenge. Lack of protection correlated with the absence of H5-hemagglutining inhibitory antibodies prior to H5N1 HPAIV challenge. Our data suggest that in naturally occurring outbreaks of HPAIV, birds with pre-existing immunity to LPAIV could survive lethal infections with HA-homologous HPAIV but not subsequent re-infections with HA-heterologous HPAIV. These results could be useful to better understand the dynamics of AIV in chickens and might help in future vaccine formulations."
https://openalex.org/W1964984983,"Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) or prion diseases are associated with accumulations of disease specific PrP (PrP(d)) in the central nervous system (CNS) and often the lymphoreticular system (LRS). Accumulations have additionally been recorded in other tissues including the peripheral nervous system and adrenal gland. Here we investigate the effect of sheep scrapie on the morphology and the accumulation of PrP(d) in the adrenal medulla of scrapie affected sheep using light and electron microscopy. Using immunogold electron microscopy, non-fibrillar forms of PrP(d) were shown to accumulate mainly in association with chromaffin cells, occasional nerve endings and macrophages. PrP(d) accumulation was associated with distinctive membrane changes of chromaffin cells including increased electron density, abnormal linearity and invaginations. Internalisation of PrP(d) from the chromaffin cell plasma membrane occurred in association with granule recycling following hormone exocytosis. PrP(d) accumulation and internalisation from membranes is similarly associated with perturbations of membrane structure and trafficking in CNS neurons and tingible body macrophages of the LRS. These data suggest that a major toxic effect of PrP(d) is at the level of plasma membranes. However, the precise nature of PrP(d)-membrane toxicity is tissue and cell specific suggesting that the normal protein may act as a multi-functional scaffolding molecule. We further suggest that the co-localisation of PrP(d) with exocytic granules of the hormone trafficking system may provide an additional source of infectivity in blood."
