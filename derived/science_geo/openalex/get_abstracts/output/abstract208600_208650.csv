https://openalex.org/W1967190054,"Red blood cells of the newt, Triturus, were spread on a water surface and picked up with carbon-coated grids for examination in the electron microscope. The identifiable nuclear material consists entirely of long fibers having a diameter of approximately 400 to 600 A. Similar fibers have been seen in human and grasshopper chromosomes prepared in the same manner."
https://openalex.org/W207752619,"Long chain fatty acids from rat liver slices were isolated after incubation in a medium enriched with tritiated water. The saturated fatty acids were separated by lead salt precipitation and the incorporation of radioactivity into the individual acids determined. The major portion of radioactivity was found in palmitic and stearic acids. Sequential degradation of the saturated fatty acids was carried out and the intramolecular location of tritium determined. Contrary to expectation, more tritium was found in the odd-numbered carbon atoms than the even-numbered. It is suggested that an exchange reaction between reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide and water occurs before or during fatty acid synthesis, and that the exchange is essentially complete. (auth)"

https://openalex.org/W2005324521,"Electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel of homogenates of various organs from the mouse yields five major lactic dehydrogenase bands. If the gels are treated with β-mercaptoethanol, subsequent electrophoresis produces 15 bands which show lactic dehydrogenase activity. This could be explained if one molecule of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (coenzyme) is attached to each of the monomeric subunits of lactic dehydrogenase and if mercaptoethanol can remove the coenzyme only from the muscle type. This is consistent with the hypothesis that intact lactic dehydrogenase is a tetramer."

The virus shows marked biologic and serologic differences from vaccinia virus, and it is presumably the etiologic agent of the milker's nodule syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2068700314,"Mental and motor abilities and personality development were studied in 20 pairs of infant twins of the same sex on a monthly basis in their first year, that is, before mutual imitation becomes a factor. Blood group determinations, made after the study was completed, revealed an N1 of 11 fraternal and N2 of 9 identical pairs. Within-pair differences were significantly greater within fraternal pairs on all tests and rating scales."
https://openalex.org/W32025885,This paper describes convenient large scale procedures that result in the further purification of thymidylate synthetase and in the separation of the enzyme from natural fluorescent inhibitors. The fluorescent material inhibits dihydrofolate reductase from mouse leukemic cells as well as the thymidylate synthetase of Escherichia coli. It is probably a mixture of two or more pteridine compounds related in structure to the folic acid group and is now under study in our laboratory.

https://openalex.org/W2013164896,"The segment of the internal capsule which carries axons relating to the sensorimotor cortex does not closely adjoin the caudate in the monkey as it does in the cat. Therefore, in seeking evidence for caudate-induced cortical responses, activation of the adjoining internal capsule by stimulus spread can be avoided. In the monkey, caudate stimulation never produced cortical responses, and only capsule stimulation evoked the potential complex which has been attributed to caudate stimulation in the cat."
https://openalex.org/W1968445312,"Thalidomide inhibits growth of some protozoa. This inhibition was counteracted by nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, and vitamin K(1). The mechanism of toxicity may be an interference of cellular oxidation. A protozoan test system is useful for studying the potential ""side actions"" of drugs in higher animals and man."
https://openalex.org/W2001539522,"In cats strychnine does not alter measurably the potential, threshold, after potentials, or refractoriness of the membrane of the spinal motoneurons. Increased reflexes probably result from increase of excitatory impingement upon motoneurons. Spikes recorded during a rapid succession of nerve impulses produced by strychnine (""strychnine burst"") suggest that soma membrane resistance is appreciable during stimulation."

https://openalex.org/W1988667576,"THE composition of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid is similar so far as content of electrolytes is concerned. There is also evidence that cerebrospinal fluid can be used as a good medium for maintaining in vitro the activity of isolated organs: frog heart, for example. But if the cerebrospinal fluid of dead, instead of living, subjects is used, the frog heart stops working immediately. This will also occur with atropinized preparations. Potassium was supposed to be responsible for this effect."

https://openalex.org/W1995603494,IT is now well known that the effectiveness of insecticides absorbed by certain soils is much greater at high than at low humidity. Analytical results1–3 have shown that this is not due to an increase in concentration of the toxicant in the superficial layers of the soil.

https://openalex.org/W1968850030,"Silicone rubber O-rings used as gaskets in Sykes-Moore cell culture perfusion chambers are permeable to carbon dioxide. When small numbers of cells are planted in such chambers, loss of carbon dioxide leads to an undesirable increase in pH and inhibits cell multiplication. Substitution of Teflon O-rings prevents this loss and allows a constant carbon dioxide tension to be maintained within the chamber. The rate of growth and plating efficiency of small numbers of cells planted in the modified chambers have been found to be comparable to those observed in conventional culture vessels. The necessary additional parts of the chamber are described, and the modifications in procedure outlined."

Several highly active components, distinct from hesperidin and naringin, were isolated and tested for anti-inflammatory activity. A method for evaluation of this biological activity is recommended."

https://openalex.org/W2086568118,Epidermal cell mitoses occur in a random spatial (Poisson) distribution in the plane of the epidermis of the mouse. It is therefore unlikely that the focal accumulation of a local extracellular factor is responsible for the initiation of mitoses.

https://openalex.org/W2010250602,"GUINEA pigs usually die within 7 days following the oral or parenteral administration of a single dose of penicillin1. Some authors consider that death is due to a direct toxic effect of the drug2. However, following the administration of penicillin, the bacterial flora of the bowel changes from one which is predominantly Gram-positive to one which is mostly Gram-negative. Some authors consider that the animals die from the enterocolitis associated with this alteration in flora3,4, rather than from a direct toxic effect of the drug."

https://openalex.org/W1992670897,"IN 1953, Moore and Barr1 published the results of an investigation of the occurrence of sex chromatin in neurons from different mammalian species. These authors were unable to show any sex chromatin in rat. However, three years later de Castro et al.2 found typical such in ameloblastic nuclei from young rats aged one day; and in 1959, Wolf-Heidegger and Klinger3 described sex chromatin in, among other tissues, spinal ganglion cells from adult rats as well as from fœtuses aged 13 and 16 days. Hinrichsen and Gothe4 and Feiner5 found a difference in the chromatin distribution between male and female rats. The last-mentioned author, however, found this difference concerning spinal ganglion cell nuclei only in fœtuses and not in adults. In trophoblastic nuclei from rat embryos, Zybina6 discovered sex chromatin after 6 days."
https://openalex.org/W2063153034,"The formation of aspartic acid from glutamic acid, of aspartic and glutamic acids from proline, of α-amino-n-butyric acid from methionine, of aspartic acid from histidine, of dihydroxyphenylalanine from tyrosine, of tyrosine and dihydroxyphenylalanine from phenylalanine, of alanine from cysteine, and of glycine from alanine was observed when aqueous solutions of these amino acids in the form of peptides or polyamino acids were irradiated. When poly-L-glutamic acid or poly-L-proline was irradiated in the presence of C14-labeled NaHCO3, the radioactive carbon was fixed by the aspartic and the glutamic acid."

https://openalex.org/W1993945244,"IN man copper can be mobilized from the body by the intramuscular or intravenous administration of BAL (dimercaptopropanol)1,2 or by the oral administration of penicillamine (dimethyl cysteine)3. Further, it has been shown that penicillamine brings about a fall in the plasma level of copper which later rapidly returns to normal4; the plasma copper presumably being made good from tissue stores. There is no direct evidence as to the effect of either of these chelating agents on the copper–protein bonds in tissues. We have investigated the ability of BAL and penicillamine to render liver copper available for nitration through a semipermeable membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2029369149,The scoring of popular responses in the word-association test provides only a fair estimate of the number of original responses. The magnitude of the relationship between popular and original responses will be overestimated unless one employs a correction for the constraint imposed by one score on the other. Two methods of correcting for the lack of independence between the numbers of popular and of original responses are described.
