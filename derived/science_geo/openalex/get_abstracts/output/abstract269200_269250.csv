https://openalex.org/W2030431769,"Many of the early transition elements form large polynuclear metal-oxygen anions containing up to 200 atoms or more. Although these polyoxoanions have been investigated for more than a century, detailed studies of structure and reactivity were not possible until the development of modern x-ray crystallographic and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic techniques. Systematic studies of small polyoxoanions in inert, aprotic solvents have clarified many of the principles governing their structure and reactivity, and also have made possible the preparation of entirely new types of covalent derivatives such as CH(2)Mo(4)O(15)H(3-), C(5)H(5)TiMo(5)O(18)(3-), and (OC)(3)Mn(Nb(2)W(4)O(19))(3-). Since most early transition metal polyoxoanions have structures based on close-packed oxygen arrays containing interstitial metal centers, their chemistry offers a rare opportunity to study chemical transformations in detail on well-defined metal oxide surfaces."

Histopathologic examinations of hepatic tissues of winter flounder from Boston Harbor revealed a high prevalence of neoplasms. The lesions, designated as cholangiocarcinomas and hepatocarcinomas, were found in 16 of 200 fish examined and resembled those experimentally induced in rodents by exposure to carcinogens."

The lycaenids caused striking reduction in seed set, indicating that this small herbivore could act as a potent selectie agent in lupine populations."
https://openalex.org/W2046257200,"An Ordovician hardground fauna in northern Kentucky provides an example from the fossil record of the maintenance of species diversity by periodic disturbance of an autogenic ecologic succession. The marine invirtebrates found encrusting limestone cobbles show an order of community development from a low-diversity pioneer assemblage through a high-diversity association to a monospecific stable fauna. All species, including the late successional dominants, were present in the early stages of colonization. Periodic overturning of the cobbles killed the encrusters and opened up new spaces on which succession was reinitiated. These disturbances maintained high diversity within the encrusting community by limiting the spatial distribution of the most efficient space competitors."

https://openalex.org/W2031562503,"The common ranges of pressure and temperature of the atmosphere of Venus measured last October establish the connection between the Soviet Venera 4 altitude scale and the United States Mariner V radial scale. But if the Venera 4 measurements extended to the surface, as claimed, this comparison implies a radius of the planet which is about 25 kilometers greater than the radius deduced from Earth-based radar data. This impasse has been resolved in favor of the smaller value by a new determination of the radius which is more direct than the method used in deriving the radar radius, and which involves concurrent ranging from Earth both to Mariner V near encounter and to the surface of Venus. It is concluded that neither spacecraft reported on atmospheric conditions near the level of the mean surface, but extrapolations of the measurements yield surface values for mid-latitudes of 100 atmospheres pressure (within a factor of 1.5) and 700 degrees K temperature (within 100 degrees ), in distinction to the Soviet values of 19+/-2 atmospheres and 544 degrees +/-10 degrees K. The higher values support radiometric and radar data on temperature and atmospheric absorption. It appears that the Soviet probe was not designed to work through such a thick atmosphere. A particularly simple (times two) ambiguity in the Venera 4 altimeter reading suggests itself, since this would bring all other data into excellent agreement and would explain the reason for the supposition that the probe reached the surface."
