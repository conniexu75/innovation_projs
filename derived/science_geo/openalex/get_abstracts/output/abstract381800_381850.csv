https://openalex.org/W2111338636,"Orthotopic liver transplantation is the only available treatment for severe liver failure, but it is currently limited by organ shortage. One technical challenge that has thus far limited the development of a tissue-engineered liver graft is oxygen and nutrient transport. Here we demonstrate a novel approach to generate transplantable liver grafts using decellularized liver matrix. The decellularization process preserves the structural and functional characteristics of the native microvascular network, allowing efficient recellularization of the liver matrix with adult hepatocytes and subsequent perfusion for in vitro culture. The recellularized graft supports liver-specific function including albumin secretion, urea synthesis and cytochrome P450 expression at comparable levels to normal liver in vitro. The recellularized liver grafts can be transplanted into rats, supporting hepatocyte survival and function with minimal ischemic damage. These results provide a proof of principle for the generation of a transplantable liver graft as a potential treatment for liver disease."
https://openalex.org/W2112329697,"Macroautophagy is a lysosomal degradative pathway essential for neuron survival. Here, we show that macroautophagy requires the Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related protein presenilin-1 (PS1). In PS1 null blastocysts, neurons from mice hypomorphic for PS1 or conditionally depleted of PS1, substrate proteolysis and autophagosome clearance during macroautophagy are prevented as a result of a selective impairment of autolysosome acidification and cathepsin activation. These deficits are caused by failed PS1-dependent targeting of the v-ATPase V0a1 subunit to lysosomes. N-glycosylation of the V0a1 subunit, essential for its efficient ER-to-lysosome delivery, requires the selective binding of PS1 holoprotein to the unglycosylated subunit and the Sec61alpha/oligosaccharyltransferase complex. PS1 mutations causing early-onset AD produce a similar lysosomal/autophagy phenotype in fibroblasts from AD patients. PS1 is therefore essential for v-ATPase targeting to lysosomes, lysosome acidification, and proteolysis during autophagy. Defective lysosomal proteolysis represents a basis for pathogenic protein accumulations and neuronal cell death in AD and suggests previously unidentified therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2139307267,"Candida albicans is the most common cause of serious fungal disease in humans. Creation of isogenic null mutants of this diploid organism, which requires sequential gene targeting, allows dissection of virulence mechanisms. Published analyses of such mutants show a near-perfect correlation between C. albicans pathogenicity and the ability to undergo a yeast-to-hypha morphological switch in vitro. However, most studies have used mutants constructed with a marker that is itself a virulence determinant and therefore complicates their interpretation. Using alternative markers, we created approximately 3,000 homozygous deletion strains affecting 674 genes, or roughly 11% of the C. albicans genome. Screening for infectivity in a mouse model and for morphological switching and cell proliferation in vitro, we identified 115 infectivity-attenuated mutants, of which nearly half demonstrated normal morphological switching and proliferation. Analysis of such mutants revealed that virulence requires the glycolipid glucosylceramide. To our knowledge, this is the first C. albicans small molecule that has been found to be required specifically for virulence."
https://openalex.org/W1989092549,"In neurons, the axon initial segment (AIS) is a specialized region near the start of the axon that is the site of action potential initiation. The precise location of the AIS varies across and within different neuronal types, and has been linked to cells' information-processing capabilities; however, the factors determining AIS position in individual neurons remain unknown. Here we show that changes in electrical activity can alter the location of the AIS. In dissociated hippocampal cultures, chronic depolarization with high extracellular potassium moves multiple components of the AIS, including voltage-gated sodium channels, up to 17 mum away from the soma of excitatory neurons. This movement reverses when neurons are returned to non-depolarized conditions, and depends on the activation of T- and/or L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. The AIS also moved distally when we combined long-term LED (light-emitting diode) photostimulation with sparse neuronal expression of the light-activated cation channel channelrhodopsin-2; here, burst patterning of activity was successful where regular stimulation at the same frequency failed. Furthermore, changes in AIS position correlate with alterations in current thresholds for action potential spiking. Our results show that neurons can regulate the position of an entire subcellular structure according to their ongoing levels and patterns of electrical activity. This novel form of activity-dependent plasticity may fine-tune neuronal excitability during development."

https://openalex.org/W2067132969,"Dieterich et al. describe a methodology to label all newly synthesized neuronal proteins in situ. This method, which they name FUNCAT, relies on the inclusion of noncanonical amino acids and selective fluorescent labeling via click chemistry. The authors show that this system is amenable to dual pulse-chase experiments and dynamic tracking of newly synthesized proteins. Protein translation has been implicated in different forms of synaptic plasticity, but direct in situ visualization of new proteins is limited to one or two proteins at a time. Here we describe a metabolic labeling approach based on incorporation of noncanonical amino acids into proteins followed by chemoselective fluorescence tagging by means of 'click chemistry'. After a brief incubation with azidohomoalanine or homopropargylglycine, a robust fluorescent signal was detected in somata and dendrites. Pulse-chase application of azidohomoalanine and homopropargylglycine allowed visualization of proteins synthesized in two sequential time periods. This technique can be used to detect changes in protein synthesis and to evaluate the fate of proteins synthesized in different cellular compartments. Moreover, using strain-promoted cycloaddition, we explored the dynamics of newly synthesized membrane proteins using single-particle tracking and quantum dots. The newly synthesized proteins showed a broad range of diffusive behaviors, as would be expected for a pool of labeled proteins that is heterogeneous."

We identified three new susceptibility loci, two of which include genes that are involved in telomere regulation. We identified two independent signals within the TERT-CLPTM1L locus on chromosome 5, which has previously been associated with multiple other cancers (rs4635969, OR=1.54, P=1.14x10(-23); rs2736100, OR=1.33, P=7.55x10(-15)). We also identified a locus on chromosome 12 (rs2900333, OR=1.27, P=6.16x10(-10)) that contains ATF7IP, a regulator of TERT expression. Finally, we identified a locus on chromosome 9 (rs755383, OR=1.37, P=1.12x10(-23)), containing the sex determination gene DMRT1, which has been linked to teratoma susceptibility in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2060545109,"Different myosin II isoforms have distinct roles at adherens junctions: myosin IIa and IIb localization to junctions is regulated by unique upstream signals and they control specific aspects of junction adhesion and linkage to the actin cytoskeleton. Classic cadherin receptors cooperate with regulators of the actin cytoskeleton to control tissue organization in health and disease. At the apical junctions of epithelial cells, the cadherin ring of the zonula adherens (ZA) couples with a contiguous ring of actin filaments1,2,3 to support morphogenetic processes such as tissue integration and cellular morphology4,5. However, the molecular mechanisms that coordinate adhesion and cytoskeleton at these junctions are poorly understood. Previously we identified non-muscle myosin II as a target of Rho signalling that supports cadherin junctions in mammalian epithelial cells6. Myosin II has various cellular functions, which are increasingly attributable to the specific biophysical properties and regulation of its different isoforms7. Here we report that myosin II isoforms have distinct and necessary roles at cadherin junctions. Although two of the three mammalian myosin II isoforms are found at the ZA, their localization is regulated by different upstream signalling pathways. Junctional localization of myosin IIA required E-cadherin adhesion, Rho/ROCK and myosin light-chain kinase, whereas junctional myosin IIB depended on Rap1. Further, these myosin II isoforms support E-cadherin junction integrity by different mechanisms. Myosin IIA RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) selectively perturbed the accumulation of E-cadherin in the apical ZA, decreased cadherin homophilic adhesion and disrupted cadherin clustering. In contrast, myosin IIB RNAi decreased filament content, altered dynamics, and increased the lateral movement of the perijunctional actin ring. Myosin IIA and IIB therefore identify two distinct functional modules, with different upstream signals that control junctional localization, and distinct functional effects. We propose that these two isoform-based modules cooperate to coordinate adhesion receptor and F-actin organization to form apical cadherin junctions."
https://openalex.org/W2013793916,"Eukaryotic cells express a wide variety of endogenous small regulatory RNAs that regulate heterochromatin formation, developmental timing, defence against parasitic nucleic acids and genome rearrangement. Many small regulatory RNAs are thought to function in nuclei. For instance, in plants and fungi, short interfering RNA (siRNAs) associate with nascent transcripts and direct chromatin and/or DNA modifications. To understand further the biological roles of small regulatory RNAs, we conducted a genetic screen to identify factors required for RNA interference (RNAi) in Caenorhabditis elegans nuclei. Here we show that the gene nuclear RNAi defective-2 (nrde-2) encodes an evolutionarily conserved protein that is required for siRNA-mediated silencing in nuclei. NRDE-2 associates with the Argonaute protein NRDE-3 within nuclei and is recruited by NRDE-3/siRNA complexes to nascent transcripts that have been targeted by RNAi. We find that nuclear-localized siRNAs direct an NRDE-2-dependent silencing of pre-messenger RNAs (pre-mRNAs) 3' to sites of RNAi, an NRDE-2-dependent accumulation of RNA polymerase (RNAP) II at genomic loci targeted by RNAi, and NRDE-2-dependent decreases in RNAP II occupancy and RNAP II transcriptional activity 3' to sites of RNAi. These results define NRDE-2 as a component of the nuclear RNAi machinery and demonstrate that metazoan siRNAs can silence nuclear-localized RNAs co-transcriptionally. In addition, these results establish a novel mode of RNAP II regulation: siRNA-directed recruitment of NRDE factors that inhibit RNAP II during the elongation phase of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1983438661,"Despite existing vaccines and enormous efforts in biomedical research, influenza annually claims 250,000-500,000 lives worldwide, motivating the search for new, more effective vaccines that can be rapidly designed and easily produced. We applied the previously described synthetic attenuated virus engineering (SAVE) approach to influenza virus strain A/PR/8/34 to rationally design live attenuated influenza virus vaccine candidates through genome-scale changes in codon-pair bias. As attenuation is based on many hundreds of nucleotide changes across the viral genome, reversion of the attenuated variant to a virulent form is unlikely. Immunization of mice by a single intranasal exposure to codon pair-deoptimized virus conferred protection against subsequent challenge with wild-type (WT) influenza virus. The method can be applied rapidly to any emerging influenza virus in its entirety, an advantage that is especially relevant when dealing with seasonal epidemics and pandemic threats, such as H5N1- or 2009-H1N1 influenza."

https://openalex.org/W2077038726,"Background Cell proliferation in all rapidly renewing mammalian tissues follows a circadian rhythm that is often disrupted in advanced-stage tumors. Epidemiologic studies have revealed a clear link between disruption of circadian rhythms and cancer development in humans. Mice lacking the circadian genes Period1 and 2 (Per) or Cryptochrome1 and 2 (Cry) are deficient in cell cycle regulation and Per2 mutant mice are cancer-prone. However, it remains unclear how circadian rhythm in cell proliferation is generated in vivo and why disruption of circadian rhythm may lead to tumorigenesis. Methodology/Principal Findings Mice lacking Per1 and 2, Cry1 and 2, or one copy of Bmal1, all show increased spontaneous and radiation-induced tumor development. The neoplastic growth of Per-mutant somatic cells is not controlled cell-autonomously but is dependent upon extracellular mitogenic signals. Among the circadian output pathways, the rhythmic sympathetic signaling plays a key role in the central-peripheral timing mechanism that simultaneously activates the cell cycle clock via AP1-controlled Myc induction and p53 via peripheral clock-controlled ATM activation. Jet-lag promptly desynchronizes the central clock-SNS-peripheral clock axis, abolishes the peripheral clock-dependent ATM activation, and activates myc oncogenic potential, leading to tumor development in the same organ systems in wild-type and circadian gene-mutant mice. Conclusions/Significance Tumor suppression in vivo is a clock-controlled physiological function. The central circadian clock paces extracellular mitogenic signals that drive peripheral clock-controlled expression of key cell cycle and tumor suppressor genes to generate a circadian rhythm in cell proliferation. Frequent disruption of circadian rhythm is an important tumor promoting factor."
https://openalex.org/W2058001379,"The MLL1 gene is a frequent target for recurrent chromosomal translocations, resulting in transformation of hematopoietic precursors into leukemia stem cells. Here, we report on structure-function studies that elucidate molecular events in MLL1 binding of histone H3K4me3/2 marks and recruitment of the cyclophilin CyP33. CyP33 contains a PPIase and a RRM domain and regulates MLL1 function through HDAC recruitment. We find that the PPIase domain of CyP33 regulates the conformation of MLL1 through proline isomerization within the PHD3-Bromo linker, thereby disrupting the PHD3-Bromo interface and facilitating binding of the MLL1-PHD3 domain to the CyP33-RRM domain. H3K4me3/2 and CyP33-RRM target different surfaces of MLL1-PHD3 and can bind simultaneously to form a ternary complex. Furthermore, the MLL1-CyP33 interaction is required for repression of HOXA9 and HOXC8 genes in vivo. Our results highlight the role of PHD3-Bromo cassette as a regulatory platform, orchestrating MLL1 binding of H3K4me3/2 marks and cyclophilin-mediated repression through HDAC recruitment."
https://openalex.org/W2131751909,"The low threshold for action potential generation in the axon initial segment (AIS) is thought to reflect a high sodium channel density. Using high-speed sodium imaging, Fleidervish et al. estimate that sodium channel density in the AIS is only threefold higher than in the soma, a smaller difference than previously estimated. In cortical pyramidal neurons, the axon initial segment (AIS) is pivotal in synaptic integration. It has been asserted that this is because there is a high density of Na+ channels in the AIS. However, we found that action potential–associated Na+ flux, as measured by high-speed fluorescence Na+ imaging, was about threefold larger in the rat AIS than in the soma. Spike-evoked Na+ flux in the AIS and the first node of Ranvier was similar and was eightfold lower in basal dendrites. At near-threshold voltages, persistent Na+ conductance was almost entirely axonal. On a time scale of seconds, passive diffusion, and not pumping, was responsible for maintaining transmembrane Na+ gradients in thin axons during high-frequency action potential firing. In computer simulations, these data were consistent with the known features of action potential generation in these neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2133941155,"Wolbachia are among the most abundant symbiotic microbes on earth; they are present in about 66% of all insect species, some spiders, mites and crustaceans, and most filarial nematode species. Infected filarial nematodes, including many pathogens of medical and veterinary importance, depend on Wolbachia for proper development and survival. The mechanisms behind this interdependence are not understood. Interestingly, a minority of filarial species examined to date are naturally Wolbachia-free.We used 454 pyrosequencing to survey the genomes of two distantly related Wolbachia-free filarial species, Acanthocheilonema viteae and Onchocerca flexuosa. This screen identified 49 Wolbachia-like DNA sequences in A. viteae and 114 in O. flexuosa. qRT-PCR reactions detected expression of 30 Wolbachia-like sequences in A. viteae and 56 in O. flexuosa. Approximately half of these appear to be transcribed from pseudogenes. In situ hybridization showed that two of these pseudogene transcripts were specifically expressed in developing embryos and testes of both species.These results strongly suggest that the last common ancestor of extant filarial nematodes was infected with Wolbachia and that this former endosymbiont contributed to their genome evolution. Horizontally transferred Wolbachia DNA may explain the ability of some filarial species to live and reproduce without the endosymbiont while other species cannot."

https://openalex.org/W2091280052,"Background A TRPN channel protein is essential for sensory transduction in insect mechanosensory neurons and in vertebrate hair cells. The Drosophila TRPN homolog, NOMPC, is required to generate mechanoreceptor potentials and currents in tactile bristles. NOMPC is also required, together with a TRPV channel, for transduction by chordotonal neurons of the fly's antennal ear, but the TRPN or TRPV channels have distinct roles in transduction and in regulating active antennal mechanics. The evidence suggests that NOMPC is a primary mechanotransducer channel, but its subcellular location—key for understanding its exact role in transduction—has not yet been established. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, by immunostaining, we locate NOMPC at the tips of mechanosensory cilia in both external and chordotonal sensory neurons, as predicted for a mechanotransducer channel. In chordotonal neurons, the TRPN and TRPV channels are respectively segregated into distal and proximal ciliary zones. This zonal separation is demarcated by and requires the ciliary dilation, an intraciliary assembly of intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins. Conclusions Our results provide a strong evidence for NOMPC as a primary transduction channel in Drosophila mechansensory organs. The data also reveals a structural basis for the model of auditory chordotonal transduction in which the TRPN and TRPV channels play sequential roles in generating and amplifying the receptor potential, but have opposing roles in regulating active ciliary motility."
https://openalex.org/W2068635406,"Learning ultimately relies on changes in the flow of activity in neural microcircuits. The plasticity of neural dynamics is particularly relevant for the processing of temporal information. Chronic stimulation of cultured rat cortical networks revealed experience-dependent plasticity in neural dynamics. We observed changes in the temporal structure of activity that reflected the intervals used during training, suggesting that cortical circuits are inherently capable of temporal processing on short timescales."
https://openalex.org/W2077049571,"Background Drugs of abuse elevate brain dopamine levels, and, in vivo, chronic drug use is accompanied by a selective decrease in dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) availability in the brain. Such a decrease consequently alters the ratio of D1R∶D2R signaling towards the D1R. Despite a plethora of behavioral studies dedicated to the understanding of the role of dopamine in addiction, a molecular mechanism responsible for the downregulation of the D2R, in vivo, in response to chronic drug use has yet to be identified. Methods and Findings Ethics statement: All animal work was approved by the Gallo Center IACUC committee and was performed in our AAALAC approved facility. In this study, we used wild type (WT) and G protein coupled receptor associated sorting protein-1 (GASP-1) knock out (KO) mice to assess molecular changes that accompany cocaine sensitization. Here, we show that downregulation of D2Rs or upregulation of D1Rs is associated with a sensitized locomotor response to an acute injection of cocaine. Furthermore, we demonstrate that disruption of GASP-1, that targets D2Rs for degradation after endocytosis, prevents cocaine-induced downregulation of D2Rs. As a consequence, mice with a GASP-1 disruption show a reduction in the sensitized locomotor response to cocaine. Conclusions Together, our data suggests that changes in the ratio of the D1R∶D2R could contribute to cocaine-induced behavioral plasticity and demonstrates a role of GASP-1 in regulating both the levels of the D2R and cocaine sensitization."
https://openalex.org/W2076709337,"The HIV-1 nucleoside RT inhibitor (NRTI)-resistance mutation, K65R confers intermediate to high-level resistance to the NRTIs abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, and tenofovir; and low-level resistance to stavudine. Several lines of evidence suggest that K65R is more common in HIV-1 subtype C than subtype B viruses.We performed ultra-deep pyrosequencing (UDPS) and clonal dideoxynucleotide sequencing of plasma virus samples to assess the prevalence of minority K65R variants in subtype B and C viruses from untreated individuals. Although UDPS of plasma samples from 18 subtype C and 27 subtype B viruses showed that a higher proportion of subtype C viruses contain K65R (1.04% vs. 0.25%; p<0.001), limiting dilution clonal sequencing failed to corroborate its presence in two of the samples in which K65R was present in >1.5% of UDPS reads. We therefore performed UDPS on clones and site-directed mutants containing subtype B- and C-specific patterns of silent mutations in the conserved KKK motif encompassing RT codons 64 to 66 and found that subtype-specific nucleotide differences were responsible for increased PCR-induced K65R mutation in subtype C viruses.This study shows that the RT KKK nucleotide template in subtype C viruses can lead to the spurious detection of K65R by highly sensitive PCR-dependent sequencing techniques. However, the study is also consistent with the subtype C nucleotide template being inherently responsible for increased polymerization-induced K65R mutations in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1990107720,"The folding of genetic information into chromatin plays important regulatory roles in many nuclear processes and particularly in gene transcription. Post translational histone modifications are associated with specific chromatin condensation states and with distinct transcriptional activities. The peculiar chromatin organization of rod photoreceptor nuclei, with a large central domain of condensed chromatin surrounded by a thin border of extended chromatin was used as a model to correlate in vivo chromatin structure, histone modifications and transcriptional activity.We investigated the functional relationships between chromatin compaction, distribution of histone modifications and location of RNA polymerase II in intact murine rod photoreceptors using cryo-preparation methods, electron tomography and immunogold labeling. Our results show that the characteristic central heterochromatin of rod nuclei is organized into concentric domains characterized by a progressive loosening of the chromatin architecture from inside towards outside and by specific combinations of silencing histone marks. The peripheral heterochromatin is formed by closely packed 30 nm fibers as revealed by a characteristic optical diffraction signal. Unexpectedly, the still highly condensed most external heterochromatin domain contains acetylated histones, which are usually associated with active transcription and decondensed chromatin. Histone acetylation is thus not sufficient in vivo for complete chromatin decondensation. The euchromatin domain contains several degrees of chromatin compaction and the histone tails are hyperacetylated, enriched in H3K4 monomethylation and hypo trimethylated on H3K9, H3K27 and H4K20. The transcriptionally active RNA polymerases II molecules are confined in the euchromatin domain and are preferentially located at the vicinity of the interface with heterochromatin.Our results show that transcription is located in the most decondensed and highly acetylated chromatin regions, but since acetylation is found associated with compact chromatin it is not sufficient to decondense chromatin in vivo. We also show that a combination of histone marks defines distinct concentric heterochromatin domains."
https://openalex.org/W2072413539,"SPROUTY-2 (SPRY2) regulates receptor tyrosine kinase signalling and therefore cell growth and differentiation. In this study, we show that SPRY2 expression in colon cancer cells is inhibited by the active vitamin D metabolite 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)) through E-cadherin-dependent and -independent mechanisms. In turn, SPRY2 represses both basal and 1,25(OH)(2)D(3)-induced E-cadherin expression. In line with this, SPRY2 induces ZEB1 RNA and protein, but not that of other epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition inducers that repress the CDH1/E-cadherin promoter. Consistently, SPRY2 and E-cadherin protein levels inversely correlate in colon cancer cell lines and xenografted tumours. Moreover, SPRY2 knockdown by small hairpin RNA increases CDH1/E-cadherin expression and, reciprocally, CDH1/E-cadherin knockdown increases that of SPRY2. In colon cancer patients, SPRY2 is upregulated in undifferentiated high-grade tumours and at the invasive front of low-grade carcinomas. Quantification of protein expression in 34 tumours confirmed an inverse correlation between SPRY2 and E-cadherin. Our data demonstrate a tumourigenic action of SPRY2 that is based on the repression of E-cadherin, probably by the induction of ZEB1, and a reciprocal regulation of SPRY2 and E-cadherin that dictates cell phenotype. We propose SPRY2 as a candidate novel marker for high-grade tumours and a target of therapeutic intervention in colon cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2076321111,"Background Paramyxoviruses are assembled at the plasma membrane budding sites after synthesis of all the structural components in the cytoplasm. Although viral ribonuclocapsid (vRNP) is an essential component of infectious virions, the process of vRNP translocation to assembly sites is poorly understood. Methodology/Principal Findings To analyze real-time trafficking of vRNPs in live infected cells, we created a recombinant Sendai virus (SeV), rSeVLeGFP, which expresses L protein fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). The rSeVLeGFP showed similar growth kinetics compared to wt SeV, and newly synthesized LeGFP could be detected as early as 8 h postinfection. The majority of LeGFP co-localized with other components of vRNPs, NP and P proteins, suggesting the fluorescent signals of LeGFP represent the locations of vRNPs. Analysis of LeGFP movement using time-lapse digital video microscopy revealed directional and saltatory movement of LeGFP along microtubules. Treatment of the cells with nocodazole restricted vRNP movement and reduced progeny virion production without affecting viral protein synthesis, suggesting the role of microtubules in vRNP trafficking and virus assembly. Further study with an electron microscope showed close association of vRNPs with intracellular vesicles present in infected cells. In addition, the vRNPs co-localized with Rab11a protein, which is known to regulate the recycling endocytosis pathway and Golgi-to-plasma membrane trafficking. Simultaneous movement between LeGFP and Rab11a was also observed in infected cells, which constitutively express mRFP-tagged Rab11a. Involvement of recycling endosomes in vRNP translocation was also suggested by the fact that vRNPs move concomitantly with recycling transferrin labeled with Alexa 594. Conclusions/Significance Collectively, our results strongly suggest a previously unrecognized involvement of the intracellular vesicular trafficking pathway in vRNP translocation and provide new insights into the transport of viral structural components to the assembly sites of enveloped viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2079263951,"Here we identify a previously undescribed protein, HemQ, that is required for heme synthesis in Gram-positive bacteria. We have characterized HemQ from Bacillus subtilis and a number of Actinobacteria. HemQ is a multimeric heme-binding protein. Spectroscopic studies indicate that this heme is high spin ferric iron and is ligated by a conserved histidine with the sixth coordination site available for binding a small molecule. The presence of HemQ along with the terminal two pathway enzymes, protoporphyrinogen oxidase (HemY) and ferrochelatase, is required to synthesize heme in vivo and in vitro. Although the exact role played by HemQ remains to be characterized, to be fully functional in vitro it requires the presence of a bound heme. HemQ possesses minimal peroxidase activity, but as a catalase it has a turnover of over 10(4) min(-1). We propose that this activity may be required to eliminate hydrogen peroxide that is generated by each turnover of HemY. Given the essential nature of heme synthesis and the restricted distribution of HemQ, this protein is a potential antimicrobial target for pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2023146008,"Background There is considerable interest in the high-throughput discovery and genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to accelerate genetic mapping and enable association studies. This study provides an assessment of EST-derived and resequencing-derived SNP quality in maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.), a conifer characterized by a huge genome size (∼23.8 Gb/C). Methodology/Principal Findings A 384-SNPs GoldenGate genotyping array was built from i/ 184 SNPs originally detected in a set of 40 re-sequenced candidate genes (in vitro SNPs), chosen on the basis of functionality scores, presence of neighboring polymorphisms, minor allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium and ii/ 200 SNPs screened from ESTs (in silico SNPs) selected based on the number of ESTs used for SNP detection, the SNP minor allele frequency and the quality of SNP flanking sequences. The global success rate of the assay was 66.9%, and a conversion rate (considering only polymorphic SNPs) of 51% was achieved. In vitro SNPs showed significantly higher genotyping-success and conversion rates than in silico SNPs (+11.5% and +18.5%, respectively). The reproducibility was 100%, and the genotyping error rate very low (0.54%, dropping down to 0.06% when removing four SNPs showing elevated error rates). Conclusions/Significance This study demonstrates that ESTs provide a resource for SNP identification in non-model species, which do not require any additional bench work and little bio-informatics analysis. However, the time and cost benefits of in silico SNPs are counterbalanced by a lower conversion rate than in vitro SNPs. This drawback is acceptable for population-based experiments, but could be dramatic in experiments involving samples from narrow genetic backgrounds. In addition, we showed that both the visual inspection of genotyping clusters and the estimation of a per SNP error rate should help identify markers that are not suitable to the GoldenGate technology in species characterized by a large and complex genome."

https://openalex.org/W1532191554,"L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) overexpression is often associated with bad prognosis in various human carcinomas. Recent studies also suggest a role of L1CAM in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC). To further address its contribution, we expressed functional domains of L1CAM in PT45-P1 PDAC cells. We found that L1CAM that is full length (L1-FL), but neither the soluble ectodomain (L1ecto) nor the cytoplasmic part (L1cyt), could enhance cell proliferation or tumour growth in mice. Expression of L1-FL resulted in constitutive activation of NF-κB, which was abolished by L1CAM knockdown. We showed that the expression of IL-1β was selectively upregulated by L1-FL, and increased IL-1β levels were instrumental for sustained NF-κB activation. IL-1β production and NF-κB activation were abolished by knockdown of α5-integrin and integrin-linked kinase, but insensitive to depletion of L1CAM cleavage proteinases. Supporting these data, PT45-P1 cells transduced with an L1CAM mutant deficient in integrin binding (L1-RGE) did not support the described L1-FL functions. Our results suggest that membranous L1CAM interacts with RGD&!minus;-binding integrins, leading to sustained NF-κB activation by IL-1β production and autocrine/paracrine signalling. The unravelling of this novel mechanism sheds new light on the important role of L1CAM expression in PDAC cells."
https://openalex.org/W1998124805,"Lung cancer shows diverse histological subtypes. Large-cell neuroendocrine cell carcinoma and small-cell lung carcinoma show similar histological features and clinical behaviors, and can be classified as high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma (HGNEC) of the lung. Here we elucidated the molecular classification of pulmonary endocrine tumors by copy-number profiling. We compared alterations of copy number with the clinical outcome of HGNEC and identified a chromosomal gain of the DEK oncogene locus (6p22.3) that was significantly associated with poor prognosis. We further confirmed that DEK overexpression was associated with poor prognosis in a larger set of HGNEC. Downregulation of DEK by small hairpin RNA led to a marked reduction of in vitro colony formation, in vivo tumorigenicity and chemo-resistance, and was associated with loss of lung cancer stem cell markers. Gene expression profiling revealed that DEK downregulation was associated with altered expression of transcriptional regulators, which specifically include known targets of interchromosomal translocations in hematopoietic tumors, and knockdown of these epigenetic modifiers affected colony formation activity. Our study showed that DEK overexpression, partly through an increase in its gene dose, mediates the activity of global transcriptional regulators and is associated with tumor initiation activity and poor prognosis in HGNEC."

All new scenarios were compared to the current coverage in BC under the 2006 IAS guidelines (i.e. baseline scenario). In BC, it is estimated that 25-30% of individuals are unaware of their status. Costs were drug-related and reported in Canadian dollars. HIV-related morbidity and mortality were estimated based on the disability-adjusted life years (DALY) methodology.Currently, there are 4379 individuals on HAART under the IAS 2006 guidelines and 6781 individuals who qualify for treatment based on the new guidelines. Within 5 years, increasing HAART coverage decreased yearly new infections by at least 44.8%. In the 50% scenario, in 5 years, DALY decreased by 53% corresponding to 4155 averted DALYs, and in 25 years it decreased by 66% corresponding to 5837 averted DALYs. The effect was even stronger if the 75% scenario was chosen instead. Compared to the 100% expansion scenario, we observed an excess in annual direct treatment expenditures at the end of 5 years of approximately 1 million dollars in the 75% scenario, and of approximately 2 million dollars in the 50% scenario.The individual and public health benefits of these new guidelines are immense. The results show that by increasing the number of individuals on HAART save lives, it is cost averting, and it positively impacts society by decreasing the number of new HIV infections. Thus, public health community should consider incremental gains when considering guidelines and policy."
https://openalex.org/W2078829914,"Antiestrogens are designed to antagonize hormone induced proliferation and ERalpha target gene expression in mammary tumor cells. Commonly used drugs such as OH-Tamoxifen and ICI 182780 (Fulvestrant) block cell cycle progression in G0/G1. Inversely, the effect of cell cycle stage on ER regulated gene expression has not been tested directly. We show that in ERalpha-positive breast cancer cells (MCF-7) the estrogen receptor gene and downstream target genes are cell cycle regulated with expression levels varying as much as three-fold between phases of the cell cycle. Steroid free culture conditions commonly used to assess the effect of hormones or antiestrogens on gene expression also block MCF-7 cells in G1-phase when several ERalpha target genes are overexpressed. Thus, cell cycle effects have to be taken into account when analyzing the impact of hormonal treatments on gene transcription. We found that antiestrogens repress transcription of several ERalpha target genes specifically in S phase. This observation corroborates the more rapid and strong impact of antiestrogen treatments on cell proliferation in thymidine, hydroxyurea or aphidicolin arrested cells and correlates with an increase of apoptosis compared to similar treatments in lovastatin or nocodazol treated cells. Hence, cell cycle effects synergize with the action of antiestrogens. An interesting therapeutic perspective could be to enhance the action of anti-estrogens by associating hormone-therapy with specific cell cycle drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1999799838,"Allergen immunotherapy presents an opportunity to define mechanisms of induction of clinical tolerance in humans. Significant progress has been made in our understanding of changes in T cell responses during immunotherapy, but existing work has largely been based on functional T cell assays. HLA-peptide-tetrameric complexes allow the tracking of antigen-specific T-cell populations based on the presence of specific T-cell receptors and when combined with functional assays allow a closer assessment of the potential roles of T-cell anergy and clonotype evolution. We sought to develop tools to facilitate tracking of antigen-specific T-cell populations during wasp-venom immunotherapy in people with wasp-venom allergy. We first defined dominant immunogenic regions within Ves v 5, a constituent of wasp venom that is known to represent a target antigen for T-cells. We next identified HLA-DRB1*1501 restricted epitopes and used HLA class II tetrameric complexes alongside cytokine responses to Ves v 5 to track T-cell responses during immunotherapy. In contrast to previous reports, we show that there was a significant initial induction of IL-4 producing antigen-specific T-cells within the first 3-5 weeks of immunotherapy which was followed by reduction of circulating effector antigen-specific T-cells despite escalation of wasp-venom dosage. However, there was sustained induction of IL-10-producing and FOXP3 positive antigen-specific T cells. We observed that these IL-10 producing cells could share a common precursor with IL-4-producing T cells specific for the same epitope. Clinical tolerance induction in humans is associated with dynamic changes in frequencies of antigen-specific T-cells, with a marked loss of IL-4-producing T-cells and the acquisition of IL-10-producing and FOXP3-positive antigen-specific CD4+ T-cells that can derive from a common shared precursor to pre-treatment effector T-cells. The development of new approaches to track antigen specific T-cell responses during immunotherapy can provide novel insights into mechanisms of tolerance induction in humans and identify new potential treatment targets."
https://openalex.org/W2056868086,"Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) open reading frame BILF1 encodes a seven trans-membrane (TM) G protein-coupled receptor that signals with high constitutive activity through Gαi (Beisser et al., 2005; Paulsen et al., 2005). In this paper, the transforming potential of BILF1 is investigated in vitro in a foci formation assay using retrovirally transduced NIH3T3 cells, as well as in vivo by using nude mice. BILF1 revealed a substantial transforming potential that was dependent on constitutive signaling, as a signaling-deficient mutant completely lost its ability to transform cells in vitro, and an intermediately active triple-mutated receptor possessed an intermediate transforming potential. Furthermore, BILF1 expression induced vascular endothelial growth factor secretion in a constitutively active manner. In nude mice, BILF1 promoted tumor formation in 90% of cases, ORF74 (from Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus) in 100% of cases, whereas the signaling-deficient receptor resulted in tumor establishment in 40% of cases. These data suggest that BILF1, when expressed during EBV infection, could indeed be involved in the pathogenesis of EBV-associated diseases and malignancies. Furthermore, the correlation between receptor activity and the ability to mediate cell transformation in vitro and tumor formation in vivo supports the idea that inverse agonists for BILF1 could inhibit cell transformation and be relevant therapeutic candidates."
https://openalex.org/W2041649796,"Synemin (SYNM) is a type IV intermediate filament that has recently been shown to interact with the LIM domain protein zyxin, thereby possibly modulating cell adhesion and cell motility. Owing to this multiplicity of potential functions relevant to cancer development, we initiated a study to decipher SYNM expression and regulation in benign human breast tissue and breast cancer. Dot blot array analysis showed significant SYNM mRNA downregulation in 86% (n=100, P<0.001) of breast cancers compared with their normal tissue counterparts, a result that was confirmed by real-time PCR analysis (n=36, P<0.0001). Immunohistochemistry analysis showed abundant SYNM protein expression in healthy myoepithelial breast cells, whereas SYNM expression loss was evident in 57% (n=37, P<0.001) of breast cancer specimens. Next, we analyzed methylation of the SYNM promoter to clarify whether the SYNM gene can be silenced by epigenetic means. Indeed, methylation-specific PCR analysis showed tumor-specific SYNM promoter methylation in 27% (n=195) of breast cancers. As expected, SYNM promoter methylation was tightly associated (P<0.0001) with SYNM expression loss. In-depth analysis of the SYNM promoter by pyrosequencing showed extensive CpG methylation of DNA elements supposed to regulate gene transcription. Demethylating treatment of SYNM methylated breast cancer cell lines with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine clearly reestablished the SYNM expression. Statistical analysis of the patient cohort showed a close association between SYNM promoter methylation and unfavorable recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio=2.941, P=0.0282). Furthermore, SYNM methylation positively correlated with lymph node metastases (P=0.0177) and advanced tumor grade (P=0.0275), suggesting that SYNM methylation is associated with aggressive forms of breast cancer. This is the first study on the epigenetic regulation of the SYNM gene in a cancer entity. We provide first hints that SYNM could represent a novel putative breast tumor suppressor gene that is prone to epigenetic silencing. SYNM promoter methylation may become a useful predictive biomarker to stratify breast cancer patients’ risk for tumor relapse."
https://openalex.org/W1982590741,"Background Mapping the expression changes during breast cancer development should facilitate basic and translational research that will eventually improve our understanding and clinical management of cancer. However, most studies in this area are challenged by genetic and environmental heterogeneities associated with cancer. Methodology/Principal Findings We conducted proteomics of the MCF10AT breast cancer model, which comprises of 4 isogenic xenograft-derived human cell lines that mimic different stages of breast cancer progression, using iTRAQ-based tandem mass spectrometry. Of more than 1200 proteins detected, 98 proteins representing at least 20 molecular function groups including kinases, proteases, adhesion, calcium binding and cytoskeletal proteins were found to display significant expression changes across the MCF10AT model. The number of proteins that showed different expression levels increased as disease progressed from AT1k pre-neoplastic cells to low grade CA1h cancer cells and high grade cancer cells. Bioinformatics revealed that MCF10AT model of breast cancer progression is associated with a major re-programming in metabolism, one of the first identified biochemical hallmarks of tumor cells (the “Warburg effect”). Aberrant expression of 3 novel breast cancer-associated proteins namely AK1, ATOX1 and HIST1H2BM were subsequently validated via immunoblotting of the MCF10AT model and immunohistochemistry of progressive clinical breast cancer lesions. Conclusion/Significance The information generated by this study should serve as a useful reference for future basic and translational cancer research. Dysregulation of ATOX1, AK1 and HIST1HB2M could be detected as early as the pre-neoplastic stage. The findings have implications on early detection and stratification of patients for adjuvant therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2067515618,"Background Elymus (Poaceae) is a large genus of polyploid species in the wheat tribe Triticeae. It is polyphyletic, exhibiting many distinct allopolyploid genome combinations, and its history might be further complicated by introgression and lineage sorting. We focus on a subset of Elymus species with a tetraploid genome complement derived from Pseudoroegneria (genome St) and Hordeum (H). We confirm the species' allopolyploidy, identify possible genome donors, and pinpoint instances of apparent introgression or incomplete lineage sorting. Methodology/Principal Findings We sequenced portions of three unlinked nuclear genes—phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, β-amylase, and granule-bound starch synthase I—from 27 individuals, representing 14 Eurasian and North American StStHH Elymus species. Elymus sequences were combined with existing data from monogenomic representatives of the tribe, and gene trees were estimated separately for each data set using maximum likelihood. Trees were examined for evidence of allopolyploidy and additional reticulate patterns. All trees confirm the StStHH genome configuration of the Elymus species. They suggest that the StStHH group originated in North America, and do not support separate North American and European origins. Our results point to North American Pseudoroegneria and Hordeum species as potential genome donors to Elymus. Diploid P. spicata is a prospective St-genome donor, though conflict among trees involving P. spicata and the Eurasian P. strigosa suggests either introgression of GBSSI sequences from P. strigosa into North American Elymus and Pseudoroegneria, or incomplete lineage sorting of ancestral GBSSI polymorphism. Diploid H. californicum and/or allotetraploid H. jubatum are possible H-genome donors; direct involvement of an allotetraploid Hordeum species would simultaneously introduce two distinct H genomes to Elymus, consistent with some of the relationships among H-genome sequences in Hordeum and Elymus. Conclusions/Significance Comparisons among molecular phylogenetic trees confirm allopolyploidy, identify potential genome donors, and highlight cases of apparent introgression or incomplete lineage sorting. The complicated history of this group emphasizes an inherent problem with interpreting conflicts among bifurcating trees—identifying introgression and determining its direction depend on which tree is chosen as a starting point of comparison. In spite of difficulties with interpretation, differences among gene trees allow us to identify reticulate species and develop hypotheses about underlying evolutionary processes."
https://openalex.org/W1999400742,"In 2008, a well preserved and complete shoe was recovered at the base of a Chalcolithic pit in the cave of Areni-1, Armenia. Here, we discuss the chronology of this find, its archaeological context and its relevance to the study of the evolution of footwear. Two leather samples and one grass sample from the shoe were dated at the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit (ORAU). A third leather sample was dated at the University of California-Irvine Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Facility (UCIAMS). The R_Combine function for the three leather samples provides a date range of 3627–3377 Cal BC (95.4% confidence interval) and the calibrated range for the straw is contemporaneous (3627–3377 Cal BC). The shoe was stuffed with loose, unfastened grass (Poaceae) without clear orientation which was more than likely used to maintain the shape of the shoe and/or prepare it for storage. The shoe is 24.5 cm long (European size 37), 7.6 to 10 cm wide, and was made from a single piece of leather that wrapped around the foot. It was worn and shaped to the wearer's right foot, particularly around the heel and hallux where the highest pressure is exerted in normal gait. The Chalcolithic shoe provides solid evidence for the use of footwear among Old World populations at least since the Chalcolithic. Other 4th millennium discoveries of shoes (Italian and Swiss Alps), and sandals (Southern Israel) indicate that more than one type of footwear existed during the 4th millennium BC, and that we should expect to discover more regional variations in the manufacturing and style of shoes where preservation conditions permit."
https://openalex.org/W2032975011,"NANOG is a key player in pluripotency and its expression is restricted to pluripotent cells of the inner cell mass, the epiblast and to primordial germ cells. Spermatogenesis is closely associated with pluripotency, because through this process highly specialized sperm cells are produced that contribute to the formation of totipotent zygotes. Nevertheless, it is unknown if NANOG plays a role in this process.In the current study, NANOG expression was examined in testes of various mammals, including mouse and human. Nanog mRNA and NANOG protein were detected by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and western blotting. Furthermore, eGFP expression was detected in the testis of a transgenic Nanog eGFP-reporter mouse. Surprisingly, although NANOG expression has previously been associated with undifferentiated cells with stem cell potential, expression in the testis was observed in pachytene spermatocytes and in the first steps of haploid germ cell maturation (spermiogenesis). Weak expression in type A spermatogonia was also observed.The findings of the current study strongly suggest a conserved role for NANOG in meiotic and post-meiotic stages of male germ cell development."

https://openalex.org/W2041700281,"Background Cross-immunity between seasonal and pandemic A/H1N1 influenza viruses remains uncertain. In particular, the extent that previous infection or vaccination by seasonal A/H1N1 viruses can elicit protective immunity against pandemic A/H1N1 is unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings Neutralizing titers against seasonal A/H1N1 (A/Brisbane/59/2007) and against pandemic A/H1N1 (A/California/04/2009) were measured using an HIV-1-based pseudovirus neutralization assay. Using this highly sensitive assay, we found that a large fraction of subjects who had never been exposed to pandemic A/H1N1 express high levels of pandemic A/H1N1 neutralizing titers. A significant correlation was seen between neutralization of pandemic A/H1N1 and neutralization of a standard seasonal A/H1N1 strain. Significantly higher pandemic A/H1N1 neutralizing titers were measured in subjects who had received vaccination against seasonal influenza in 2008–2009. Higher pandemic neutralizing titers were also measured in subjects over 60 years of age. Conclusions/Significance Our findings reveal that the extent of protective cross-immunity between seasonal and pandemic A/H1N1 influenza viruses may be more important than previously estimated. This cross-immunity could provide a possible explanation of the relatively mild profile of the recent influenza pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W2053660548,"The epidemiology of diarrheal disease in Botswana, an HIV endemic region, is largely unknown. Our primary objective was to characterize the prevalent bacterial and parasitic enteropathogens in Gaborone, Botswana. Secondary objectives included determining corresponding antimicrobial resistance patterns and the value of stool white and red blood cells for predicting bacterial and parasitic enteropathogens.A retrospective cross-sectional study examined laboratory records of stool specimens analyzed by the Botswana National Health Laboratory in Gaborone, Botswana from February 2003 through July 2008. In 4485 specimens the median subject age was 23 [interquartile range 1.6-34] years. Overall, 14.4% (644 of 4485) of samples yielded a pathogen. Bacteria alone were isolated in 8.2% (367 of 4485), parasites alone in 5.6% (253 of 4485) and both in 0.5% (24 of 4485) of samples. The most common bacterial pathogens were Shigella spp. and Salmonella spp., isolated from 4.0% (180 of 4485) and 3.9% (175 of 4485) of specimens, respectively. Escherichia coli (22 of 4485) and Campylobacter spp. (22 of 4485) each accounted for 0.5% of pathogens. Comparing antimicrobial resistance among Shigella spp. and Salmonella spp. between two periods, February 2003 to February 2004 and July 2006 to July 2008, revealed an increase in ampicillin resistance among Shigella spp. from 43% to 83% (p<0.001). Among Salmonella spp., resistance to chloramphenicol decreased from 56% to 6% (p<0.001). The absence of stool white and red blood cells correlated with a high specificity and negative predictive value.Most gastroenteritis stools were culture and microscopy negative suggesting that viral pathogens were the majority etiologic agents in this Botswana cohort. Shigella spp. and Salmonella spp. were the most common bacteria; Isospora spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. were the most common parasites. Resistance to commonly used antimicrobials is high and should be closely monitored."
https://openalex.org/W1977088755,"Hub proteins have central roles in regulating cellular processes. By targeting a single cellular hub, a viral oncogene may gain control over an entire module in the cellular interaction network that is potentially comprised of hundreds of proteins. The adenovirus E1A oncoprotein is a viral hub that interacts with many cellular hub proteins by short linear motifs/molecular recognition features (MoRFs). These interactions transform the architecture of the cellular protein interaction network and virtually reprogram the cell. To identify additional MoRFs within E1A, we screened portions of E1A for their ability to activate yeast pseudohyphal growth or differentiation. This identified a novel functional region within E1A conserved region 2 comprised of the sequence EVIDLT. This MoRF is necessary and sufficient to bind the N-terminal region of the SUMO conjugase UBC9, which also interacts with SUMO noncovalently and is involved in polySUMOylation. Our results suggest that E1A interferes with polySUMOylation, but not with monoSUMOylation. These data provide the first insight into the consequences of the interaction of E1A with UBC9, which was initially described in 1996. We further demonstrate that polySUMOylation regulates pseudohyphal growth and promyelocytic leukemia body reorganization by E1A. In conclusion, the interaction of the E1A oncogene with UBC9 mimics the normal binding between SUMO and UBC9 and represents a novel mechanism to modulate polySUMOylation."

https://openalex.org/W1998299304,"We previously showed that the burden of Chlamydia pneumoniae in carotid plaques was significantly associated with plaque interleukin (IL)-6, and serum IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP), suggesting that infected plaques contribute to systemic inflammatory markers in patients with stroke risk. Since lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA(2)) mediates inflammation in atherosclerosis, we hypothesized that serum Lp-PLA(2) mass and activity levels and plaque Lp-PLA(2) may be influenced by plaque C. pneumoniae infection.Forty-two patients underwent elective carotid endarterectomy. Tissue obtained at surgery was stained by immunohistochemistry for Lp-PLA(2) grade, macrophages, IL-6, C. pneumoniae and CD4+ and CD8+ cells. Serum Lp-PLA(2) activity and mass were measured using the colorimetric activity method (CAM) and ELISA, respectively. Serum homocysteine levels were measured by HPLC. Eleven (26.2%) patients were symptomatic with transient ischemic attacks. There was no correlation between patient risk factors (smoking, coronary artery disease, elevated cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, hypertension and family history of genetic disorders) for atherosclerosis and serum levels or plaque grade for Lp-PLA(2). Plaque Lp-PLA(2) correlated with serum homocysteine levels (p = 0.013), plaque macrophages (p<0.01), and plaque C. pneumoniae (p<0.001), which predominantly infected macrophages, co-localizing with Lp-PLA(2).The significant association of plaque Lp-PLA(2) with plaque macrophages and C. pneumoniae suggests an interactive role in accelerating inflammation in atherosclerosis. A possible mechanism for C. pneumoniae in the atherogenic process may involve infection of macrophages that induce Lp-PLA(2) production leading to upregulation of inflammatory mediators in plaque tissue. Additional in vitro and in vivo research will be needed to advance our understanding of specific C. pneumoniae and Lp-PLA(2) interactions in atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W1965084345,"Gastric and small intestinal circular smooth muscle layers have a transwall resting membrane potential (RMP) gradient that is dependent on release of carbon monoxide (CO) from interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs). Our aim was to determine whether a RMP gradient exists in the mouse colon and whether the gradient is CO dependent. Microelectrodes were used to record RMPs from muscle cells at different depths of the circular muscle layer from wild-type and heme oxygenase-2-knockout (HO-2-KO) mice. A transwall RMP gradient was present in wild-type mice. The CO scavenger oxyhemoglobin (20 µM) and the heme oxygenase inhibitor chromium mesoporphyrin IX (CrMP, 5 µM) abolished the transwall gradient. The gradient was absent in HO-2-KO mice. Tetrodotoxin (1 µM) caused a significant depolarization in circular smooth muscle cells throughout the circular muscle layer and abolished the transwall gradient. Removal of the submucosal neurons abolished the gradient. The majority of submucosal neurons contained HO-2 immunoreactivity (HO-2-IR), while ICCs did not. These data show for the first time that a transwall gradient exists across the circular smooth muscle layer of the mouse colon, that the gradient is due to CO, and that the source of CO is the submucosal neurons.—Sha, L., Farrugia, G., Linden, D. R., Szurszewski, J. H. The transwall gradient across the mouse colonic circular muscle layer is carbon monoxide dependent. FASEB J. 24, 3840–3849 (2010). www.fasebj.org"
https://openalex.org/W1987866132,"Purpose To investigate the relationship between age and axillary lymph node (LN) involvement in Chinese breast cancer patients, and to replicate a recently identified piecewise relationship between age and LN involvement. Methods A dataset, consisting of 3,715 patients (with complete information on study variables) with operable breast cancer consecutively surgically treated between 1996 and 2006, was derived from the database of Shanghai Cancer Hospital. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were employed to analyze the relationship between age and LN. We subsequently performed a similar analysis on another dataset including 1,832 consecutive patients treated between 2007 and 2008 to replicate our findings in the first dataset. Results A U-shaped relationship (previously observed in two European populations) between age and LN status failed to be replicated in our dataset of Chinese patients. Instead, we observed a linear rather than piecewise relationship. After multivariate adjustment, the linear relationship was still present. Moreover, the interaction between age and LN involvement was not modified by tumor size. The odds of LN involvement decreased by 1.5% for each year increase in age (OR 0.985, 95% CI 0.979–0.991, P<0.001). Breast cancer subtypes were also associated with LN status. Proportions of basal-like and ERBB2+ subtypes decreased with increasing age. The observations in the first dataset were successfully replicated in a second independent dataset. Conclusion We confirmed a straightforward but not piecewise relationship between age and LN status in Chinese patients. The different pattern between Chinese and European elderly patients should be considered when making clinical decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2007346774,"Background Oxaloacetate decarboxylase (OAD) is a member of the Na+ transport decarboxylase enzyme family found exclusively in anaerobic bacteria. OAD of Vibrio cholerae catalyses a key step in citrate fermentation, converting the chemical energy of the decarboxylation reaction into an electrochemical gradient of Na+ ions across the membrane, which drives endergonic membrane reactions such as ATP synthesis, transport and motility. OAD is a membrane-bound enzyme composed of α, β and γ subunits. The α subunit contains the carboxyltransferase catalytic site. Methodology/Principal Findings In this report, spectroscopic techniques were used to probe oxomalonate (a competitive inhibitor of OAD with respect to oxaloacetate) and Na+ effects on the enzyme tryptophan environment and on the secondary structure of the OAD complex, as well as the importance of each subunit in the catalytic mechanism. An intrinsic fluorescence approach, Red Edge Excitation Shift (REES), indicated that solvent molecule mobility in the vicinity of OAD tryptophans was more restricted in the presence of oxomalonate. It also demonstrated that, although the structure of OAD is sensitive to the presence of NaCl, oxomalonate was able to bind to the enzyme even in the absence of Na+. REES changes due to oxomalonate binding were also observed with the αγ and α subunits. Infrared spectra showed that OAD, αγ and α subunits have a main component band centered between 1655 and 1650 cm−1 characteristic of a high content of α helix structures. Addition of oxomalonate induced a shift of the amide-I band of OAD toward higher wavenumbers, interpreted as a slight decrease of β sheet structures and a concomitant increase of α helix structures. Oxomalonate binding to αγand α subunits also provoked secondary structure variations, but these effects were negligible compared to OAD complex. Conclusion Oxomalonate binding affects the tryptophan environment of the carboxyltransferase subunit, whereas Na+ alters the tryptophan environment of the β subunit, consistent with the function of these subunits within the enzyme complex. Formation of a complex between OAD and its substrates elicits structural changes in the α-helical as well as β-strand secondary structure elements."
https://openalex.org/W2085956627,"Background Evolutionary theory suggests that natural selection favors the evolution of cognitive abilities which allow humans to use facial cues to assess traits of others. The use of facial and somatic cues by humans has been studied mainly in western industrialized countries, leaving unanswered whether results are valid across cultures. Methodology/Principal Findings Our objectives were to test (i) if previous finding about raters' ability to get accurate information about an individual by looking at his facial photograph held in low-income non western rural societies and (ii) whether women and men differ in this ability. To answer the questions we did a study during July-August 2007 among the Tsimane', a native Amazonian society of foragers-farmers in Bolivia. We asked 40 females and 40 males 16–25 years of age to rate four traits in 93 facial photographs of other Tsimane' males. The four traits were based on sexual selection theory, and included health, dominance, knowledge, and sociability. The rating scale for each trait ranged from one (least) to four (most). The average rating for each trait was calculated for each individual in the photograph and regressed against objective measures of the trait from the person in the photograph. We found that (i) female Tsimane' raters were able to assess facial cues related to health, dominance, and knowledge and (ii) male Tsimane' raters were able to assess facial cues related to dominance, knowledge, and sociability. Conclusions/Significance Our results support the existence of a human ability to identify objective traits from facial cues, as suggested by evolutionary theory."
https://openalex.org/W2031861799,"Despite our incomplete understanding of the function of the type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) in tumorigenesis, IGF-IR targeting agents have entered clinical trials for the treatment of human cancers. Previously, we have shown that downregulation of IGF-IR transgene in mammary tumors in MTB-IGFIR transengic mice results in tumor regression in a majority of the mice and most of these mice do not develop recurrent mammary tumors. In this study, we examined mammary tissue of mice that did not develop recurrent tumors. Areas of tumor regression were visible macroscopically and microscopically these lesions contained cell debris, individual cells, lipofuscin and doxycycline crystals. Three of the 12 mice also presented with considerable lobuloalveolar development. The re-expression of the IGF-IR transgene in mammary tissue with stably regressed tumors resulted in the rapid re-emergence of mammary tumors, some of which seemed to originate from the regressed mammary lesions. Thus, despite stable tumor regression after IGF-IR downregulation, mammary tissue contained preneoplastic lesions and tumors rapidly re-appear upon re-overexpression of IGF-IR transgene. Therefore, IGF-IR-targeting agents may be effective at regressing mammary tumors expressing IGF-IR, but these agents will not completely eradicate all tumor cells or restore the mammary stromal environment."
