https://openalex.org/W2069144532,"Introduction of DNA into Neurospora crassa can lead to sequence instability in the sexual phase of the life cycle. Sequence instability was investigated by using a set of strains transformed with single copies of a plasmid including host sequences, Neurospora sequences deleted from the host genome, and foreign sequences. The sequences already represented in the host were rearranged at high frequency in a cross. In general, both elements of the duplication, that from the plasmid and that from the host, became rearranged, whether or not they were linked. Unique sequences were left unaltered. Cytosine residues in the rearranged sequences typically became methylated de novo. Results from tetrad analyses indicated that the rearrangements occur before meiosis, during a stage between fertilization and karyogamy. We suggest that this previously unrecognized genetic process, RIP (rearrangement induced premeiotically), may contribute diversity for evolution and also maintain the gross organization of the genome."
https://openalex.org/W1968524816,"cDNA encoding a 70 kd protein (70K) associated with U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) was cloned from a human brain-stem library using autoantibodies from patients with connective tissue disease. The cDNA-derived amino acid sequence contains 23 residues homologous to a region of murine leukemia virus group-specific antigen p30gag. The homology residues in an antigenic portion of the 70K protein and is defined by a core consensus sequence, ETPEEREERRR, that occurs as a tandem repeat in p30gag of most mammalian type C retroviruses. Anti-p30gag antibodies recognized a recombinant 70K-LacZ fusion protein as well as U1 snRNPs. Using synthetic peptides as competitors, we demonstrated that the region of homology encompasses the site of immunological cross-reactivity. Thus autoantibodies against U1 snRNPs were elicited by immunization with p30gag. On the basis of these findings, we suggest a role for retroviruses in the initiation of autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W1692343830,"Cationized albumin (pI greater than 8), unlike native albumin (pI approximately 4), enters cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rapidly from blood. This suggests that a specific uptake mechanism for cationized albumin may exist at the brain capillary wall, i.e. the blood-brain barrier. Isolated bovine brain capillaries rapidly bound cationized [3H]albumin and approximately 70% of the bound radioactivity was resistant to mild acid wash, which is assumed to represent internalized peptide. Binding was saturable and a Scatchard plot gave a maximal binding capacity (Ro) = 5.5 +/- 0.7 micrograms/mgp (79 +/- 10 pmol/mgp), and a half-saturation constant (KD) = 55 +/- 8 micrograms/ml (0.8 +/- 0.1 microM). The binding of cationized [3H]albumin (pI = 8.5-9) was inhibited by protamine, protamine sulfate, and polylysine (molecular weight = 70,000) with a Ki of approximately 3 micrograms/ml for all three proteins. The use of cationized albumin in directed delivery of peptides through the blood-brain barrier was examined by coupling [3H]beta-endorphin to unlabeled cationized albumin (pI = 8.5-9) using the bifunctional reagent, N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)proprionate. The [3H]beta-endorphin-cationized albumin chimeric peptide was rapidly bound and endocytosed by isolated bovine brain capillaries, and this was inhibited by unlabeled cationized albumin but not by unconjugated beta-endorphin or native bovine albumin. Cationized albumin provides a new tool for studying absorptive-mediated endocytosis at the brain capillary and may also provide a vehicle for directed drug delivery through the blood-brain barrier."

https://openalex.org/W1513516642,"To better define the biologic function of the type II insulin-like growth factor (IGF) receptor, we raised a blocking antiserum in a rabbit by immunizing with highly purified rat type II IGF receptor. On immunoblots of crude type II receptor preparations, only bands corresponding to the type II IGF receptor were seen with IgG 3637, indicating that the antiserum was specific for the type II receptor. Competitive binding and chemical cross-linking experiments showed that IgG 3637 blocked binding of 125I-IGF-II to the rat type II IGF receptor, but did not block binding of 125I-IGF-I to the type I IGF receptor, nor did IgG 3637 block binding of 125I-insulin to the insulin receptor. In addition, IgG 3637 did not inhibit the binding of 125I-IGF-II to partially purified 150- and 40-kDa IGF carrier proteins from adult and fetal rat serum. L6 myoblasts have both type I and type II IGF receptors. IGF-I was more potent than IGF-II in stimulating N-methyl-alpha-[14C]aminoisobutyric acid uptake, 2-[3H]deoxyglucose uptake, and [3H]leucine incorporation into cellular proteins. IgG 3637 did not stimulate either 2-[3H]deoxyglucose uptake, N-methyl-alpha-[14C]aminoisobutyric acid uptake, or [3H]leucine incorporation into protein when tested alone. Furthermore, IgG 3637 at concentrations sufficient to block type II receptors under conditions of the uptake and incorporation experiments did not cause a shift to the right of the dose-response curve for stimulation of these biologic functions by IGF-II. We conclude that the type II IGF receptor does not mediate IGF stimulation of N-methyl-alpha-[14C]aminoisobutyric acid and 2-[3H]deoxyglucose uptake and protein synthesis in L6 myoblasts; presumably, the type I receptor mediates these biologic responses. The anti-type II receptor antibody inhibited IGF-II degradation in the media by greater than 90%, suggesting that the major degradative pathway for IGF-II in L6 myoblasts utilizes the type II IGF receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1990276386,"C. elegans contains a microtubule binding protein that resembles both dynein and kinesin. This protein has a MgATPase activity and copurifies on both sucrose gradients and DEAE Sephadex columns with a polypeptide of Mr approximately 400 kd. The ATPase activity is 50% inhibited by 10 microM vanadate, 1 mM N-ethyl maleimide, or 5 mM AMP-PNP; it is enhanced 50% by 0.2% Triton. The 400 kd polypeptide is cleaved at a single site by ultraviolet light in the presence of ATP and vanadate. In these ways, the protein resembles dynein. The protein also promotes ATP-dependent translocation of microtubules or axonemes, ""plus"" ends trailing. This property is kinesin-like; however, the motility is blocked by 5 microM vanadate, 1 mM N-ethyl maleimide, 0.5 mM ATP-gamma-S, or by ATP-vanadate-UV cleavage of the 400 kd polypeptide, characteristics that differ from kinesin. We propose that this protein is a novel microtubule translocator."
https://openalex.org/W1527810981,"We have isolated five Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants defective in galactosyltransferase I (UDP-D-galactose:xylose beta-1,4-D-galactosyltransferase) and studied the effect of p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xyloside supplementation on glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis in the mutant cells. Assays of galactosyltransferase I showed that the mutants contained less than 2% of the enzyme activity present in wild-type cells, and enzyme activity was additive in mixtures of mutant and wild-type cell extracts, suggesting that the mutations most likely defined the structural gene encoding the enzyme. Cell hybridization studies showed that the mutations in all five strains were recessive and that the mutants belonged to the same complementation group. The mutants contained wild-type levels of xylosyltransferase (UDP-D-xylose:core protein (serine) beta-D-xylosyltransferase), lactose synthase (UDP-D-galactose:N-acetyl-glucosaminide beta-1,4-D-galactosyltransferase), and lactosylceramide synthase (UDP-D-galactose:glucosylceramide beta-1,4-D-galactosyltransferase). Their sensitivity to lectin-mediated cytotoxicity was virtually identical to that of the wild-type, indicating that there were no gross alterations in glycoprotein or glycolipid compositions. Anion-exchange high performance liquid chromatography of 35S-glycosaminoglycans from one of the galactosyltransferase I-deficient mutants showed a dramatic reduction in both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, demonstrating that galactosyltransferase I is responsible for the formation of both glycosaminoglycans in intact cells. Surprisingly, the addition of 1 mM-p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xyloside, a substrate for galactosyltransferase I, restored glycosaminoglycan synthesis in mutant cells. This finding suggested that another galactosyltransferase, possibly lactose synthase, can transfer galactose to xylose in intact cells."
https://openalex.org/W1577741430,"We have previously demonstrated that the human insulin receptor, mutated in the ATP-binding domain of the beta-subunit, is kinase-defective and fails to mediate multiple post-receptor actions of insulin in stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (Chou, C.-K., Dull, T. J., Russell, D. S., Gherzi, R., Lebwohl, D., Ullrich, A., and Rosen, O. M. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 1842-1847). This study addresses the role of protein-tyrosine kinase activity in insulin-mediated receptor down-regulation. Although the mutant insulin proreceptor was properly processed and able to bind insulin like the wild-type human receptor, it differed from the latter in the following respects: 1) it failed to mediate internalization of surface-bound radiolabeled ligand; 2) it did not undergo short- or long-term down-regulation in response to 1 microM insulin; 3) it did not exhibit ligand-promoted receptor turnover; and 4) it was not phosphorylated on either tyrosine or serine residues in response to insulin. Although the cells transfected with the mutant receptor failed to respond to insulin-mediated insulin receptor down-regulation, they were able to down-regulate their insulin-like growth factor I receptors in response to insulin-like growth factor I or high concentrations of insulin and were sensitive to monoclonal antibody-induced down-regulation of their insulin receptors. Antibody-mediated receptor internalization alone, however, was unable to mimic at least one action of insulin, thymidine incorporation into DNA, and did not lead to any phosphorylation of the receptor. It is concluded that either the protein-tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor or its phosphorylation state is essential for ligand-mediated receptor down-regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1996132904,"The progressive deposition in the human brain of amyloid filaments composed of the amyloid β protein is a principal feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Densitometric analysis of Southern blots probed with a complementary DNA for the amyloid protein has been carried out to determine the relative dosage of this gene in genomic DNA of 14 patients with AD, 12 aged normal subjects, and 10 patients with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). Whereas patients in the last group showed the expected 1.5-fold increase in dosage of this gene, none of the patients with AD had a gene dosage higher than that of the normal controls. These results do not support the hypothesis that the genetic defect in AD involves duplication of a segment of chromosome 21 containing the amyloid gene. Alternative mechanisms for the brain-specific increase in amyloid protein deposition in AD should be considered."

https://openalex.org/W1675314858,"This study describes the biochemical characterization and kinetic analysis of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor in Raji human B-lymphoma and EL4 murine T-lymphoma cells. The internalization of 125I-IL-1 was studied in both cell types by an acid extraction technique which removes surface bound ligand. At 37 degrees C, binding to Raji IL-1 receptors was almost entirely cell surface (91%). EL4 cells, in contrast, internalized 59% of ligand at this temperature and this was almost totally inhibited by sodium azide. Receptor binding studies showed that the B-cells had a lower binding affinity but much higher receptor density per cell (KD = 2.1 nM, Ro = 7709) than the T-cells (KD = 0.4 nM, Ro = 241). The receptor binding affinity of two IL-1 analogs, Glu-4 and clone 18, was determined in competitive binding studies. In the B-cells the analogs had binding affinities of 25 and 90%, respectively, whereas in the T-cells the affinities were 0.2 and 200%, respectively. Chemical cross-linking studies showed that the IL-1 receptor in B-cells had a lower molecular weight than that in T-cells (68 kDa compared to 80 kDa). In summary these studies demonstrate that structural differences exist between IL-1 receptors in Raji and EL4 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1564759593,"Three antibodies reacting with corneal keratan sulfate proteoglycan were used to detect antigenically related molecules in 11 bovine and 13 embryonic chick tissues. Two monoclonal antibodies recognized sulfated epitopes on the keratan sulfate chain and a polyclonal antibody bound antigenic sites on the core protein of corneal keratan sulfate proteoglycan. Competitive immunoassay detected core protein and keratan sulfate antigens in guanidine HCl extracts of most tissues. Keratan sulfate antigens of most bovine tissues were only partially extracted with guanidine HCl, but the remainder could be solubilized by CNBr treatment of the guanidine-extracted residue. Keratan sulfate and core protein antigens co-eluted with purified corneal keratan sulfate proteoglycan on ion exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Endo-beta-galactosidase digestion of the HPLC-purified keratan sulfate antigens eliminated the binding of monoclonal anti-keratan sulfate antibodies in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Extracts of all 11 bovine tissues, except those from brain and cartilage, could bind both anti-keratan sulfate monoclonal antibodies and anti-core protein polyclonal antibody simultaneously. Binding was sensitive to competition with keratan sulfate and to digestion with endo-beta-galactosidase. These results suggest widespread occurrence of a proteoglycan or sulfated glycoprotein bearing keratan sulfate-like carbohydrate and a core protein resembling that of corneal keratan sulfate proteoglycan."

https://openalex.org/W1566775686,"Mouse neuroblastoma N18 cells contain specific high affinity insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptors. Insulin and IGF-I induce phosphorylation, in intact cells, of their respective receptor beta subunits. The insulin receptor beta subunit is represented by a 95-kDa phosphoprotein that is recognized by a specific antiserum (B10). The IGF-I receptor beta subunit is represented by two phosphoproteins of molecular mass 95 and 105 kDa. The hormone-induced phosphorylation was rapid and dose-dependent occurring on both phosphoserine and phosphotyrosine residues. In addition, both insulin and IGF-I induced phosphorylation of an endogenous protein of molecular mass 185 kDa (pp185). The rapidity and dose dependency of the phosphorylation of pp185 suggested that it may represent a common endogenous substrate for the insulin and IGF-I receptors in these neural-derived cells. Phosphorylation was primarily on phosphoserine and phosphotyrosine residues. pp185 did not absorb to wheat germ agglutinin-agarose and was not stimulated by either epidermal growth factor or platelet-derived growth factor. The finding of pp185 in these neural-related cells as well as in non-neural tissues suggests that it may represent a ubiquitous endogenous substrate for both the insulin and IGF-I receptor kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1634205,"Specialized lambda-transducing phages that carry the Escherichia coli genes ptsH, ptsI, crr, cysM, and cysA have been isolated, and the genes were subcloned in plasmid pBR322. Subcloning and restriction mapping data gave the following clockwise order of genes located at about 52 min on the E. coli genetic map: lig, cysK, ptsH, ptsI, crr, cysM, cysA. The nucleotide sequences of ptsH, ptsI, and crr and the corresponding flanking regions have been determined. These genes encode three cytoplasmic proteins of the phosphoenol-pyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system: HPr, Enzyme I, and IIIGlc, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequences are consistent with amino acid composition and Edman degradation analyses obtained with the purified proteins. The calculated subunit molecular weight values (9,109 for HPr, 63,489 for Enzyme I, and 18,099 for IIIGlc) also agree well with values obtained with the proteins. Results of gamma delta-transposon insertional studies provided definitive evidence that IIIGlc is the gene product of crr, and therefore that IIIGlc plays a critical role in regulating the metabolism and uptake of certain non-PTS sugars (see accompanying papers: Mitchell, W.J., Saffen, D.W., and Roseman, S. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 16254-16260; Misko, T.P., Mitchell, W.J., Meadow, N.D., and Roseman, S. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 16261-16266). The gamma delta transposon studies also suggest that crr is transcribed from an independent promoter located within the ptsI gene. Putative regulatory sequence features include a catabolite gene activator protein-cAMP-binding site and two regions of 2-fold rotational symmetry adjacent to the potential promoter upstream from the HPr structural gene, several ribosome-binding sites, and a rho-independent RNA polymerase termination site downstream from crr. In addition, the ptsI gene contains two highly conserved direct repeats. The significance of these sequence features is discussed with respect to possible multiple forms of pts regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1832017107,"Abstract Human colonic adenocarcinoma tissue and derived cell lines have been characterized by an abundance of different type 1 and 2 lacto series glycolipid antigens which are either low or not found in normal colonic mucosa. The enzymatic basis for the expression of contrasting glycolipid compositions between adenocarcinomas and normal colonic mucosa, as well as between derived cell lines, has been studied. The following results were of particular interest. (i) Abundant activities of beta 1----4galactosyltransferase associated with synthesis of both lactosylceramide and lactoneotetraosylceramide, beta 1----3galactosyltransferase for synthesis of lactotetraosylceramide, and an alpha 1----3/4fucosyltransferase responsible for synthesis of Lex and Lea antigens were found in normal colonic mucosa or in a normal mucosal epithelial cell line HCMC, or in both. Variable levels of these activities were found in adenocarcinoma tissues and in various established adenocarcinoma cell lines. In striking contrast, significant activity of a beta 1----3N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase responsible for synthesis of lactotriaosylceramide (Lc3) was found in various cases of colonic adenocarcinoma and cell lines, but was undetectable in normal colonic epithelial cells. (ii) In situ transfer of galactose to Lc3 was performed on histologic sections by preincubation of the tissue with acceptor glycolipid followed by incubation with UDP-galactose. The biosynthesized glycolipid was revealed by indirect immunofluorescence with the monoclonal antibody 1B2 which defines lactoneotetraosylceramide antigen. In these studies, histologic sections prepared from frozen normal proximal colon tissue were shown to lack native type 2 chain structures. However, transfer of galactose from UDP-galactose could be demonstrated in the epithelial cells of normal proximal colon after incorporation of Lc3 into the membranes, indicating the ability of normal colonic epithelial cells to synthesize type 2 chain core structures if the precursor Lc3 is available. In contrast, adenocarcinoma tissues showed significant native immunofluorescence with the antibody. These data suggest that an accumulation of both type 1 and 2 chain lacto series glycolipids with alpha 1----3- or alpha 1----4fucosyl substitution in human adenocarcinoma is due to enhanced beta 1----3N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase rather than enhancement of other enzymes. This enzyme may play a key role in regulating the level of various types of lacto series tumor-associated antigens with the lacto type 1 or 2 chain."
https://openalex.org/W1495480944,"Synthetic rat atrial natriuretic factor (r-ANF, 1-28) was incubated with rat kidney cortex membranes, and a predominant degradation product was identified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The degradation product was subjected to amino acid analyses and found to have a composition identical to r-ANF. Amino-terminal sequence analyses identified two distinct amino-terminal residues and suggested that cleavage had occurred between the cysteine-phenylalanine bond (residues 7 and 8) of r-ANF. This degradative process could be inhibited by 1,10-phenanthroline and EDTA, suggesting that the enzyme responsible for proteolysis is a metalloendoprotease. The enzyme exhibits a Michaelis-Menten constant of approximately 10 microM for the metabolism of r-ANF and has a broad pH optimum between 8.5 and 9.5. These findings suggest that ANF may be initially degraded in the kidney at a single cleavage site within the 17-residue ring structure."
https://openalex.org/W1507151747,"Rabbit antiserum raised against the isolated native epsilon subunit of the chloroplast coupling factor 1 activated the ATPase activity of coupling factor 1 in solution by removing the epsilon subunit. Incubation of thylakoid membranes with the antiserum in the dark had no effect on photophosphorylation or on the dithiothreitol-induced Mg2+-ATPase activity. Incubation with the antiserum during illumination, however, strongly inhibited both activities and caused the membranes to become leaky to protons. The results indicate that the formation of a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane induces a change in conformation of the epsilon subunit of the ATP synthase such that it becomes susceptible to attack and removal by the antibodies. This change may be a part of the mechanism that results in energy-dependent activation of the ATP synthase."
https://openalex.org/W1975985989,"Methylation of cytosine residues in eukaryotic DNA is common, but poorly understood. Typically several percent of the cytosines are methylated; however, it is unclear what governs which sequences eventually become modified. Neurospora crassa DNA containing the ""zeta-eta"" (zeta-eta) region, which is a region of unusually heavy methylation, was tested for its ability to direct DNA methylation de novo. DNA stripped of its methylation by propagation in Escherichia coli was reintroduced into Neurospora crassa by transformation. The zeta-eta region reproducibly became ""properly"" methylated whether inserted at its native chromosomal position or at ectopic sites. Adjacent Neurospora and bacterial sequences in the transforming DNA rarely became methylated. A model is presented that accounts for position-independent faithful methylation as observed in the zeta-eta region, as well as position-dependent methylation, as occasionally observed, especially with sequences not native to Neurospora."
https://openalex.org/W2019885356,"An abnormal alpha 2-antiplasmin that is associated with a serious bleeding tendency has been found in a Dutch family and is referred to as alpha 2-antiplasmin Enschede. This abnormal alpha 2-antiplasmin is converted from an inhibitor of plasmin to a substrate. The molecular defect of alpha 2-antiplasmin Enschede, as revealed by sequencing of cloned genomic DNA fragments, consists of an alanine insertion near the active site region of the molecule. Substitution of this fragment into complementary DNA for a wild-type alpha 2-antiplasmin yields a translation product with physical and functional properties typical of the abnormal alpha 2-antiplasmin Enschede. The naturally occurring mutant may serve as a model for investigating the structures that determine the properties of an inhibitor versus those of a substrate in serine protease inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1599848121,"The insulin proreceptor is a 190-kDa glycoprotein that is processed to mature alpha (135-kDa) and beta (95-kDa) subunits. In order to determine the role of carbohydrate chain processing in insulin receptor biogenesis, we investigated the effect of inhibiting glucose removal from core oligosaccharides of the insulin proreceptor with glucosidase inhibitors, castanospermine and 1-deoxynojirimycin. Cultured IM-9 lymphocytes treated with inhibitors had 50% reduction in surface insulin receptors as demonstrated by ligand binding, affinity cross-linking with 125I-insulin, and lactoperoxidase/Na 125I labeling studies. Degradation rates of surface labeled receptors were similar in both control and inhibitor-treated cells (t1/2 = 5 h); thus, accelerated receptor degradation could not account for this reduction. Biosynthetic labeling experiments with [3H]leucine and [3H]mannose identified an apparently higher molecular size proreceptor (approximately 205 kDa) that failed to show the characteristic decline with time as seen in the normal 190-kDa proreceptor. Along with this finding, the biosynthetic label appearing in the mature subunits was reduced in these inhibitor-treated cells. Endoglycosidase H treatment of both precursors produced identical 170-kDa bands. Carbohydrate chains released from the 205-kDa precursor by endoglycosidase H migrated in the same position as the Glc2-3Man9GlcNAc standards when separated by high performance liquid chromatography, whereas the 190-kDa proreceptor oligosaccharides migrated similar to the Man7-9GlcNAc chains. Although the mature subunits of control and inhibitor-treated cells demonstrated equal electrophoretic mobility, the endoglycosidase H-sensitive oligosaccharides of the mature subunits in treated cells also contained residues that migrated similar to the Glc2-3Man9GlcNAc standards. Thus, glucose removal from core oligosaccharides is apparently not necessary for the cleavage of the insulin proreceptor, but does delay processing of this precursor, which probably accounts for the reduction in cell-surface receptors."

https://openalex.org/W1557763134,"Abstract Survival of the chick depends upon the transfer of maternal IgG from the egg yolk into the fetal circulation. Radiolabeled chicken IgG binds specifically to both fixed and unfixed yolk sac tissue from day 7 or 8 of embryogenesis through at least day 18. This binding is saturable, Fc-specific, pH-dependent, and reversible. Chicken Fc fragments and some heterologous IgGs compete with IgG binding, whereas bovine serum albumin, phosvitin, conalbumin, chicken IgM, and chicken Fab fragments do not. Eight-day embryos appear to have only a low affinity receptor, KD = 3.4 x 10(-7) M, but 18-day embryos have an additional high affinity receptor, KD = 3.0 x 10(-8) M. The membrane density of the low affinity receptor remains essentially constant throughout development."
https://openalex.org/W1584581247,"In muscle and fat, insulin causes the cellular redistribution of glucose transporters and insulin-like growth factor II receptors from an intracellular pool of membranes (low density microsomes) to the plasma membrane. This translocation is a major mechanism by which insulin stimulates cellular glucose uptake. Our aim was to purify and characterize the insulin-regulatable exocytic intracellular membranes that are enriched in glucose transporter. Low density microsome and plasma membrane fractions were isolated from basal and insulin-stimulated rat adipocytes by differential centrifugation. In cells exposed to insulin, glucose transporters were decreased in the low density microsomes and correspondingly increased in the plasma membranes as determined by immunoblotting and cytochalasin B binding. Low density microsomes were further fractionated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Membranes containing glucose transporters were separated from the major protein-containing peaks and from plasma membranes, Golgi, and endoplasmic reticulum. Further fractionation was achieved by agarose gel electrophoresis. Overall, the intracellular membranes enriched in transporter were purified 9-fold compared to low density microsomes. These purified membranes had the following characteristics: 1) uniformly sized vesicles, diameter 60-100 nm; 2) insulin-regulatable protein composition, one constituent being an Mr 43,000 protein that co-migrated with immunoblotted glucose transporters; 3) enrichment in insulin-like growth factor II receptors, but of a lesser degree than the enrichment in transporters. Thus, using a three-step procedure, insulin-sensitive translocatable vesicles from adipocytes have been highly purified. These are similar in size and density to endosomes, and the glucose transporter is a major constituent of this distinct vesicle population."
https://openalex.org/W44234124,"Acetyl phosphate is hydrolyzed by the calcium ATPase of leaky sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles from rabbit skeletal muscle with Km = 6.5 mM and kcat = 7.9 s-1 in the presence of 100 microM calcium (180 mM K+, 5 mM MgSO4, pH 7.0, 25 degrees C). In the absence of calcium, hydrolysis is 6% of the calcium-dependent rate at low and 24% at saturating concentrations of acetyl phosphate. Values of K0.5 for calcium are 3.5 and 2.2 microM (n = 1.6) in the presence of 1 and 50 mM acetyl phosphate, respectively; inhibition by calcium follows K0.5 = 1.6 mM (n approximately 1.1) with 50 mM acetyl phosphate and K0.5 = 0.5 mM (n approximately 1.3) with 1.5 mM ATP. The calcium-dependent rate of phosphoenzyme formation from acetyl phosphate is consistent with Km = 43 mM and kf = 32 s-1 at saturation; decomposition of the phosphoenzyme occurs with kt = 16 s-1. The maximum fraction of phosphoenzyme formed in the steady state at saturating acetyl phosphate concentrations is 43-46%. These results are consistent with kc congruent to 30 s-1 for binding of Ca2+ to E at saturating [Ca2+], to give cE.Ca2, in the absence of activation by ATP. Phosphoenzyme formed from ATP and from acetyl phosphate shows the same biphasic reaction with ADP, rate constants for decomposition that are the same within experimental error, and similar or identical activation of decomposition by ATP. It is concluded that the reaction pathways for acetyl phosphate and ATP in the presence of Ca2+ are the same, with the exception of calcium binding and phosphorylation; an alternative, faster route that avoids the kc step is available in the presence of ATP. The existence of three different regions of dependence on ATP concentration for steady state turnover is confirmed; activation of hydrolysis at high ATP concentrations involves an ATP-induced increase in kt."

https://openalex.org/W1562515317,"Dictyostelium myosin II is a conventional myosin consisting of two heavy chains of 243,000 Da and two pairs of light chains of 16,000 and 18,000 Da. In this paper, we show that the heavy chain of myosin II can be rapidly and selectively cleaved by chymotrypsin to yield two fragments with molecular weights of 195,000 and 38,000 Da as estimated from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Chymotryptic cleavage at this site occurs most readily in the absence of salt and is greatly inhibited as the salt concentration is increased from 0 to 60 mM. Amino acid sequence analysis of the small fragment demonstrates that its amino terminus corresponds to lysine 1826 of the myosin II heavy chain. If the fragment extends to the carboxyl terminus of the myosin II heavy chain, it would have a molecular weight of 33,700. Upon digestion of myosin II which has been phosphorylated with a high molecular weight Dictyostelium myosin heavy chain kinase (Cote, G.P., and Bukiejko, U. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 1065-1072), all of the phosphate is recovered on the 33,700-Da tail-end fragment. Chymotrypsin-cleaved myosin II is shown to be capable of forming filaments at salt concentrations between 20 and 100 mM as judged by its ability to be sedimented by centrifugation. Only the large fragment of myosin II is found in the pellet; the 33,700-dalton fragment remains soluble. Chymotrypsin-cleaved myosin II can bind to actin and displays a high Ca2+-activated ATPase activity but has very low actin-activated ATPase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1533641603,"Sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles were modified with a fluorescent thiol reagent, N-iodoacetyl-N'-(5-sulfo-1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine. One mol of readily reactive thiols per mol of the Ca2+-ATPase was labeled without a loss of the catalytic activity. The fluorescence of the label increased by 8% upon binding of Ca2+ to the high affinity sites of the enzyme. This fluorescence enhancement probably reflects a conformational change responsible for Ca2+-induced enzyme activation. Upon addition of ATP to the Ca2+-activated enzyme, the fluorescence decreased by 15%. This fluorescence drop and formation of the phosphoenzyme intermediate were determined under the same conditions with a stopped-flow apparatus and a rapid quenching system. The amplitude of the fluorescence drop thus determined was saturated with 3 microM ATP. This shows that the fluorescence drop was caused by ATP binding to the catalytic site. In contrast, the rate of the fluorescence drop was not saturated even with 50 microM ATP. The fluorescence drop coincided with phosphoenzyme formation at 0.5 or 3 microM ATP, but it became much faster than phosphoenzyme formation when the ATP concentration was raised to 100 microM. These results indicate that the ATP-induced fluorescence drop reflects a conformational change in the enzyme.ATP complex. The fluorescence drop was accompanied by a red spectrum shift, which suggests that the label was exposed to a more hydrophilic environment. The electrophoretic analysis of the tryptic digest of the labeled enzyme (10.9 kDa) showed that almost all of the label was located on the 5.2-kDa fragment which includes the carboxyl terminus and the putative ATP-binding domain. The sequencing of the two major labeled peptides, which were isolated from the thermolytic digest of the labeled enzyme, revealed that the labeled site in either of these peptides was Cys674. It seems likely that the label bound to this Cys674 could be involved in the observed fluorescence changes."

(1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 2042-2049). ATP, ADP, AMPPCP, trinitrophenyladenosine triphosphate, and decavanadate inhibited the cross-link in a manner suggestive of a homogeneous class of inhibitory sites, with K0.5 values for inhibition in agreement with Kd values for binding to the active site. Cross-link formation was inhibited in proportion to phosphoenzyme levels formed from Pi (E2-P) whereas stoichiometric phosphorylation from CaATP (E1-P) had no effect. Inhibition was observed at millimolar concentrations of CaATP, indicative of nucleotide binding to E1-P. MgATP, in the presence of Ca2+, inhibited cross-linkage in the micromolar and millimolar concentration ranges, the former attributable to E1 X ATP and E2-P formation and the latter to ATP binding mainly to E1-P. The inability to cross-link the active site only of the E2-P intermediate suggests a unique active site conformation, possibly a closed active site cleft, which we suggest is linked to low affinity, inwardly orientated Ca2+-binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1549097735,"Characterization and metabolism of heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans (HSPGs) synthesized by primary cultures of mouse uterine epithelial cells are reported. HSPGs were detected in both the medium and in the cell-associated fraction, whereas glycosaminoglycans containing little or no protein (free glycosaminoglycans) were found primarily in the cell-associated fraction. The cell-associated HSPGs were relatively large (Kav = 0.1 on Superose 12), had a buoyant density in cesium chloride gradients of 1.45-1.55 g/ml, and contained heparan sulfate chains that fell into two size classes, exhibiting Kav values on Superose 12 of 0.2-0.5 and 0.7-0.8, respectively. The free glycosaminoglycan chains displayed a Kav on Superose 12 of 0.6-0.7. The secreted HSPGs were smaller (median Kav on Superose 12 of 0.28) than the cell-associated HSPGs. More than 90% of the cell-associated HSPGs contained hydrophobic portions, as evidenced by their ability to bind to octyl-Sepharose. In contrast, only 10-15% of the secreted HSPGs bound to octyl-Sepharose. HSPGs were detected at both apical and basal cell surfaces/extracellular matrices by indirect immunofluorescence in vitro and in utero and by accessibility to external proteases in vitro. It was estimated that 60-70% of the total cell-associated HSPGs were exposed at the cell surface. The HSPGs released from the cell surface by proteases were slightly smaller than the intact HSPGs and lacked the hydrophobic properties of the latter. These observations suggested that the cell surface HSPGs contain a small, hydrophobic domain that functions in the attachment of HSPGs to cells. The free glycosaminoglycans appeared to be primarily intracellular and were not secreted. The cell-associated HSPGs turned over rapidly (t1/2 = 1.5 h) and appeared to be the precursors to the free glycosaminoglycans. Metabolic turnover of the free glycosaminoglycan pool was a relatively slow process (t1/2 = 10-12 h).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1540782482,"Utilizing a proteoliposome reconstitution system, we have purified the rat liver V1 vasopressin receptor to near homogeneity. The receptor was purified approximately 21,000-fold from rat liver membranes, using differential detergent solubilization, size exclusion gel filtration, lectin affinity, and ion-exchange chromatography. The purified receptor exhibits a Kd of 6 nM, when, prior to solubilization, the membranes were exposed to 1 microM vasopressin. This resulted in the association of a pertussis toxin-insensitive guanine nucleotide-binding protein with the receptor during most of the purification procedure. In the absence of this association, the receptor had a Kd of approximately 30 nM. Association of the receptor with a G-protein was confirmed by the ability of vasopressin to stimulate the hydrolysis of [gamma-32P]GTP. The specific activity of the vasopressin-stimulated hydrolysis was 25 nmol/min/mg, approximately 8,000-fold higher than values obtained with crude reconstituted receptor preparations. Cross-linking of 125I-vasopressin to a partially purified preparation of receptor demonstrated that the receptor had a molecular weight of approximately 68,000 under reducing conditions, and 58,000 under nonreducing conditions. The purification procedure may prove useful in purifying a number of small peptide hormone receptors (e.g. bradykinin, angiotensin II) and perhaps their associated G-proteins as well."

At 37 degrees C, binding of 125I IFN beta ser occurred rapidly (t1/2max less than or equal to 15 min) followed by internalization and degradation of bound ligand. Kinetic analysis at 4 degrees C indicated diffusion-limited association kinetics independent of 125I IFN beta ser concentration. Dissociation of bound 125I IFN beta ser from Daudi cells was slow (t1/2 = 1.2 h) of bound radiolabeled ligand was observed in the presence of unlabeled IFN beta ser, naturally produced IFN beta, and IFN alpha 6, but was not observed with unlabeled IFN gamma or nonspecific proteins. Concomitantly, equilibrium analysis indicated heterogeneous binding of 125I IFN beta ser to six cell lines of lymphoid origin consistent with either negative cooperativity or two populations of receptors. Analysis of binding of 125I IFN beta ser to Daudi cell receptors in the presence of unlabeled IFN alpha 6 suggested that one receptor served both ligands. The latter conclusion was supported by results of chemical cross-linking experiments in which an 125I IFN beta ser/receptor complex (Mr 120,000-130,000) was observed following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This complex was absent when binding occurred in the presence of either excess unlabeled IFN beta ser or IFN alpha 6."
https://openalex.org/W1568904035,"Abstract The photoprobe 3'(2')-O-(4-benzoyl)benzoyladenosine 5'-triphosphate (Bz2ATP) was used to characterize the nucleotide-binding site of myosin subfragment 1 (SF1). Improved synthesis and purification of Bz2ATP are reported. 1H NMR and ultraviolet spectroscopy show that Bz2ATP is a 60:40 mixture of the 3'(2')-ribose isomers and that the epsilon M261 is 41,000 M-1 cm-1. Bz2ATP is hydrolyzed by SF1 comparably to ATP in the presence of actin or K+, NH4+, or Mg2+ ions; and the product, Bz2ADP, has a single binding site on SF1 (K'a = 3.0 X 10(5) M-1). [3H]Bz2ATP was photoincorporated into SF1 with concomitant loss of K+-EDTA-ATPase activity. Analysis of photolabeled SF1 showed that the three major tryptic peptides (23, 50, and 20 kDa) of the heavy chain fragment and the alkali light chains were labeled. The presence of ATP during irradiation protected only the 50-kDa peptide, indicating that the other peptides were nonspecifically labeled. If Bz2ATP was first trapped on SF1 by cross-linking the reactive thiols, SH1 and SH2, with p-phenylenedimaleimide, only the 50-kDa tryptic peptide was labeled. These results confirm and extend previous observations that [3H]Bz2ATP trapped on SF1 by cobalt(III) phenanthroline photolabeled the same 50-kDa peptide (Mahmood, R., and Yount, R.G. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 12956-12959). Thus, the 50-kDa peptide is labeled with or without thiol cross-linking, indicating that the relative position of SH1 and SH2 does not affect the labeling pattern."
https://openalex.org/W1579090468,"Anion dependence of (Ca2+ + K+)-stimulated Mg2+-dependent transport ATPase and its phosphorylated intermediate have been characterized in both and vesicles from endoplasmic reticulum of rat pancreatic acinar cells using adenosine 5'-[gamma-32P] triphosphate ([gamma-32P]ATP). In intact vesicles (Ca2+ + K+)-Mg2+-ATPase activity was higher in the presence of Cl- or Br- as compared to NO3-, SCN-, cyclamate-, SO4(2-) or SO3(2-). Incorporation of 32P from [gamma-32P]ATP into the 100-kDa intermediate of this Ca2+ATPase was also higher in the presence of Cl-, Br-, NO3- or SCN- as compared to cyclamate-, SO4(2-) or SO3(2-). When the membrane permeability barrier to anions was abolished by breaking vesicle membrane with the detergent Triton X-100 (0.015%) (Ca2+ + K+)-Mg2+ATPase activity in the presence of weakly permeant anions, such as SO4(2-) and cyclamate-, increased to the level obtained with Cl-. However, 32P incorporation into 100-kDa protein was still higher in the presence of Cl- as compared to cyclamate-, indicating a direct effect of Cl- on the Ca2+ATPase molecule. The anion transport blocker 4,4-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2-disulfonate (DIDS) inhibited (Ca2+ + K+)-Mg2+ATPase activity to about 10% of the Cl- stimulation level, irrespective of the sort of anions present in both intact and broken vesicles. This indicates a direct effect of DIDS on (Ca2+ + K+)-Mg2+ATPase. K+ ionophore valinomycin influenced (Ca2+ + K+)-Mg2+ATPase activity according to the actual K+ gradient: Ko+ greater than Ki+ caused inhibition, Ko+ less than Ki+ caused stimulation. From these results we conclude that Ca2+ transport into endoplasmic reticulum is coupled to ion movements which must occur to maintain electroneutrality."
https://openalex.org/W1559607500,"The effect of light chain phosphorylation on the actin-activated ATPase activity and filament stability of gizzard smooth muscle myosin was examined under a variety of conditions. When unphosphorylated and phosphorylated gizzard myosins were monomeric, their MgATPase activities were not activated or only very slightly activated by actin, and when they were filamentous, their MgATPase activities could be stimulated by actin. At pH 7.0, the unphosphorylated myosin in the presence of ATP required 2-3 times as much Mg2+ for filament formation as did the phosphorylated myosin. The amount of stimulation of the unphosphorylated myosin filaments depended upon pH, temperature, and the presence of tropomyosin. At pH 7.0 and 37 degrees C and at pH 6.8 and 25 degrees C, the MgATPase activity of filamentous, unphosphorylated, gizzard myosin was stimulated 10-fold by actin complexed with gizzard tropomyosin. These tropomyosin-actin-activated ATPase activities were 40% of those of the phosphorylated myosin. Under other conditions, pH 7.5 and 37 degrees C and pH 7.0 and 25 degrees C, even though the unphosphorylated myosin was mostly filamentous, its MgATPase activity was stimulated only 4-fold by tropomyosin-actin. Thus, both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated gizzard myosin filaments appear to be active, but the cycling rate of the unphosphorylated myosin is less than that of the phosphorylated myosin. Active unphosphorylated myosin may help explain the ability of smooth muscles to maintain tension in the absence of myosin light chain phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1584972059,"Abstract 45Ca2+-40Ca2+ exchangeability of 45Ca bound to the calcium transport sites of unphosphorylated sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase at equilibrium has been found to be heterogeneous: Half of the bound calcium is [Ca2+]-dependent in a slowly exchangeable (k less than 0.3 s-1), state in the Ca2+-ATPase, and the other calcium is [Ca2+]-independent in a rapidly exchangeable (k approximately 0.3 s-1), state (Nakamura, J. (1986) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 870, 495-501). In this paper, the two different forms of exchangeable calcium were studied after phosphorylation of the enzyme by ATP without added Mg2+ at pH 7.0 and 0 degree C. By the phosphorylation, the degree of the occlusion became higher (k less than 0.03 s-1). The unoccluded calcium was, however, not significantly affected. The more highly occluded calcium exchanged at the same rate as the decay rate of the phosphoenzyme (EP) in the steady state at a ratio of about 1:1. The occluded calcium was relieved by dephosphorylation of EP by ADP. These results suggest that 1 mol of ADP-sensitive EP more highly occluded 1 mol of calcium, already occluded before phosphorylation. After transformation of ADP-sensitive EP to its ADP-insensitive form by the addition of 20 mM Mg2+ at pH 8.8, the unoccluded calcium was rapidly (k = 0.1-0.3 s-1) released from the transformed EP. However, the occluded calcium was maintained in an occluded state in which the calcium was slowly (k approximately 0.01 s-1) released from the EP without exchange. The results suggest that calcium occlusion in the ADP-sensitive EP is not relieved by the loss of ADP sensitivity of the EP itself."
https://openalex.org/W1592405459,"We have reexamined the uncoupling of Ca2+ transport from ATP hydrolysis, which has been reported to be caused by trypsin cleavage of the Ca2+-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles at the second (slower) of two characteristic tryptic sites (Scott, T. L., and Shamoo, A. E. (1982) J. Membr. Biol. 64, 137-144). We find that the loss of Ca2+ accumulation capacity in SR vesicles is poorly correlated with this cleavage under several conditions. The loss is accompanied by increased Ca2+ permeability but not by changes in the properties of the ATPase or ATP-Pi exchange activities of the vesicles. Proteoliposomes containing purified Ca2+-ATPase which has been cleaved in part at the two tryptic sites are as well coupled and impermeable to Ca2+ as proteoliposomes containing intact Ca2+-ATPase. We conclude that the loss of Ca2+ accumulation capacity in SR vesicles on tryptic treatment is due to cleavage of a SR membrane component other than the Ca2+-ATPase, possibly a component of the gated channels which function in Ca2+ release from SR, which leads to a Ca2+ leak. The hydrolytic and coupled transport functions of the Ca2+-ATPase itself may well be unaffected by the two tryptic cleavages."

https://openalex.org/W1624869451,"Several experimental parameters, critical to the analysis of ATP synthesis by sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase, were determined experimentally. 1) The phosphorylated enzyme intermediate obtained with acetylphosphate in the presence of a Ca2+ gradient was shown to be entirely ADP sensitive but quite stable in the absence of added ADP. On the contrary, the phosphoenzyme obtained with ATP is unstable due to the ADP formed during the phosphoryl transfer reaction. For this reason, addition of ADP to [32P]phosphoenzyme obtained with [32P]acetylphosphate provides the simplest conditions for kinetic studies on [gamma-32P]ATP synthesis. 2) The dissociation rate constant of newly synthesized ATP (in the reverse direction of the ATPase cycle) was measured experimentally and found to be 16 s-1. This value agrees well with the dissociation rate constant determined for adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate bound to this enzyme. 3) ATP synthesis observed in the absence of a Ca2+ gradient was shown to be a kinetic overshoot due to ligand-induced perturbation of a limited number of partial reactions and occurring before equilibration of the entire system. Most of the ATP formed under these conditions was subsequently hydrolyzed as the overall equilibrium was reached. 4) Based on these and other (previously characterized) parameters, satisfactory simulations of single and multiple cycle ATP synthesis, in the presence and in the absence of a Ca2+ gradient, were obtained."
https://openalex.org/W95386863,"Reaction of the phosphofructokinase from Ascaris suum with the reagent, diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC), results in the loss of enzymatic activity. Treatment of the inactivated enzyme with hydroxylamine brings about the recovery of almost 80% of the original activity suggesting that the modified residues are histidines. Further evidence for the modification of histidines is that concomitant with the loss of activity, there is a change in A242 nm that corresponds to the derivatization of 5-6 histidines per subunit. There is no change in A278 nm during the derivatization process, thereby ruling out the modification of tyrosines by DEPC. Analyses of the first order inactivation rate constant for DEPC derivatization at different pH values resulted in the determination of a pKa of 6.4 +/- 0.1 for the group on the enzyme that reacts with DEPC. Derivatization of the enzyme with DEPC in the presence of fructose 6-phosphate (Fru-6-P) protected the enzyme against inactivation by 80%. ATP or MgATP gave no protection against DEPC inactivation. When the Fru-6-P-protected enzyme was further reacted with DEPC in the absence of Fru-6-P, a total of 2 histidines were modified per subunit, and the derivatization of one of these could be correlated with activity loss. When the phosphofructokinase that had been derivatized by DEPC in the presence of Fru-6-P was assayed, it was found that it no longer exhibited allosteric properties and appeared to be desensitized to ATP inhibition. This loss of ATP inhibition could be correlated with the modification of 2 histidines per subunit by DEPC. The first order rate constant for desensitization was determined at different pH values and a pKa value of 7.0 +/- 0.2 was obtained for the group(s) responsible for the desensitization. Regulatory studies with the desensitized enzyme revealed that the enzyme was not stimulated by AMP, NH4+, K+, phosphate, sulfate, or hexose bisphosphates. It is concluded that histidine may be involved both in the active site and the ATP inhibitory site of the ascarid phosphofructokinase."
https://openalex.org/W1552784415,"Acanthamoeba myosin IA is a globular protein composed of a 140-kDa heavy chain and a 17-kDa light chain. It expresses high actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity when one serine on the heavy chain is phosphorylated. We previously showed that chymotrypsin cleaves the heavy chain into a COOH-terminal 27-kDa peptide that can bind to F-actin but has no ATPase activity and a complex containing the NH2-terminal 112-kDa peptide and the light chain. The complex also binds F-actin and has full actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity when the regulatory site is phosphorylated. We have now localized the ATP binding site to within 27 kDa of the NH2 terminus and the regulatory phosphorylatable serine to a 20-kDa region between 38 and 58 kDa of the NH2 terminus. Under controlled conditions, trypsin cleaves the heavy chain at two sites, 38 and 112 kDa from the NH2 terminus, producing a COOH-terminal 27-kDa peptide similar to that produced by chymotrypsin and a complex consisting of an NH2-terminal kDa peptide, a central 74-kDa peptide, and the light chain. This complex is similar to the chymotryptic complex but for the cleavage which separates the 38- and 74-kDa peptides. The tryptic complex has full (K+, EDTA)-ATPase activity (the catalytic site is functional) and normal ATP-sensitive actin-binding properties. However, the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity and the F-actin-binding characteristics of the tryptic complex are no longer sensitive to phosphorylation of the regulatory serine. Therefore, cleavage between the phosphorylation site and the ATP-binding site inhibits the effects of phosphorylation on actin binding and actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity without abolishing the interactions between the ATP- and actin-binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1534684808,"The Ascaris suum phosphofructokinase exhibits hysteretic transitions in the time course for fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) phosphorylation in addition to allosteric properties when assayed at pH values below 8. Conditions that enhance hysteretic changes also enhance cooperative interactions and thus there appears to be a link between hysteresis and cooperativity. Initiation of reaction with either F6P or phosphofructokinase results in a pronounced lag, while initiation of the reaction with MgATP results in a burst at pH values below 8. Under conditions in which a lag is evident, increasing the concentration of F6P in the assay decreases the lag, while under conditions where a burst is evident, increasing the concentration of MgATP in the assay decreases the burst. The lag is enzyme-dependent going to a limiting value at high enzyme concentration, while the burst is enzyme-independent. As the pH increases, the Hill coefficient for F6P decreases from a pH-independent value of 3 at low pH to a value of 1 above pH 8. Over the same pH range, the burst rate increases to a point that it is too fast to measure at pH 8 (that is, the time course is linear). Finally, at pH 6.9, the saturation curve for F6P becomes more cooperative with the Hill coefficient equal to 3 above 4 mM MgATP. Data are interpreted in terms of the model suggested for the rabbit skeletal muscle phosphofructokinase (Frieden, C., Gilbert, H. R., and Bock, P.E. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 5644-5647) in which MgATP binds preferably to an inactive tetrameric enzyme form in which a group with a pK of 6.8 is protonated and F6P binds preferably to the unprotonated active tetrameric form."
https://openalex.org/W1672702830,"Abstract The separate alpha and beta polypeptides of the tryptophan synthetase of bacteria are represented in fungi by a fusion polypeptide in which the first third is homologous to bacterial alpha chains and the remainder is homologous to bacterial beta chains. In the yeast polypeptide, a short nonhomologous connector joins the two homologous segments. The chromosomal order of all bacterial genes that specify tryptophan synthetase beta and alpha chains, respectively, is trpB-trpA. Fusion of these genes in their present arrangement would result in the synthesis of a polypeptide with a segmental order, N-beta-alpha-C, opposite that observed in fungi. To investigate possible explanations for the apparent transposition that occurred in the evolution of the fungal gene we have made two fusions of trpB and trpA of Escherichia coli in their natural orientation. We find that the fusion proteins are synthesized but both are less active catalytically than the wild type bacterial protein. In addition, the fusion proteins associate abnormally, they are activated only slightly by wild type alpha or beta 2, and they are less sensitive than the wild type protein to inhibition by antibodies to alpha or beta 2. The fusion proteins have normal substrate affinities. Our findings suggest that the altered structures of the fusion proteins affect catalytic ability and the locations of the alpha and/or beta chain combining sites. This structural distortion may have prevented the natural selection of direct gene fusions during the course of the fungal gene's evolution."

The lambda origin region has four repeats of a 19-base pair sequence to which O protein binds. To the right of these sites on the lambda map is a 40-base pair region that is rich in adenine and thymine, followed by a 28-base pair palindromic sequence. To define more precisely the boundaries of the lambda origin, we cloned a 358-base pair piece of lambda DNA containing the origin region into M13mp8 in both orientations. In vitro replication of RF I DNAs prepared from cells infected with these two M13 ori lambda phage was dependent on lambda O and P proteins and a crude protein fraction from uninfected E. coli; with these conditions there was no replication of M13mp8 RF I DNA. We made deletions from the left and the right ends of the lambda origin DNA and determined the deletion end points by DNA sequencing. We have tested RF I DNAs prepared from cells infected with phage carrying ori lambda deletions for their ability to function as templates for O- and P-dependent replication in vitro. Our results show that lambda DNA between nucleotide positions 39072 and 39160 is required for efficient O- and P-dependent replication. This 89-base pair piece of DNA includes only two of the four 19-base pair O protein-binding sites (the two right-most) and the adjoining adenine- and thymine-rich region to the right of the O-binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1580803175,"The kinetic mechanism of phosphofructokinase has been determined at pH 8 for native enzyme and pH 6.8 for an enzyme desensitized to allosteric modulation by diethylpyrocarbonate modification. In both cases, the mechanism is predominantly steady state ordered with MgATP binding first in the direction of fructose 6-phosphate (F6P) phosphorylation and rapid equilibrium random in the direction of MgADP phosphorylation. This is a unique kinetic mechanism for a phosphofructokinase. Product inhibition by MgADP is competitive versus MgATP and noncompetitive versus F6P while fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) is competitive versus fructose 6-phosphate and uncompetitive versus MgATP. The uncompetitive pattern obtained versus F6P is indicative of a dead-end E.MgATP.FBP complex. Fructose 6-phosphate is noncompetitive versus either FBP or MgADP. Dead-end inhibition by arabinose 5-phosphate or 2,5-anhydro-D-mannitol 6-phosphate is uncompetitive versus MgATP corroborating the ordered addition of MgATP prior to F6P. In the direction of MgADP phosphorylation, inhibition by anhydromannitol 1,6-bisphosphate is noncompetitive versus MgADP, while Mg-adenosine 5'(beta, gamma-methylene)triphosphate is noncompetitive versus FBP. Anhydromannitol 6-phosphate is a slow substrate, while anhydroglucitol 6-phosphate is not. This suggests that the enzyme exhibits beta-anomeric specificity."
https://openalex.org/W1598303671,"Fodrin, a non-erythrocyte spectrin-like protein, has been purified from bovine brain and found to be phosphorylated by the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase with a maximal stoichiometry of 1.02 +/- 0.06 mol of phosphate/mol of fodrin dimer (n = 4). This phosphorylation was not affected by the presence of actin and calmodulin. The phosphorylation of fodrin was found to occur exclusively at serine residues on the beta subunit. Two-dimensional thin layer electrophoresis and chromatography of a tryptic digest of phosphorylated fodrin showed one major phosphopeptide and a few minor ones. We have previously reported that nonphosphorylated fodrin is capable of stimulating the smooth muscle actomyosin Mg2+-ATPase by 50-70% under a well-defined set of conditions such as a critical fodrin concentration and an optimal preincubation time (Wang, C., Ngai, P.K., Walsh, M.P., and Wang, J.H. (1987) Biochemistry 24, 1110-1117). We now report that phosphorylation of fodrin completely eliminates this stimulatory effect. However, phosphorylation of fodrin was able to compete with nonphosphorylated fodrin to result in the abolition of the stimulatory effect. Similarly, nonphosphorylated fodrin could overcome the inhibitory effect created by phosphorylated fodrin. The present results support the suggestion that the stimulation of the smooth muscle actomyosin Mg2+-ATPase by fodrin may be a physiological phenomenon and cyclic AMP may serve as a regulator for this effect."
