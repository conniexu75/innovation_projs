https://openalex.org/W2045484875,"The transfer of electrons and protons between membrane-bound respiratory complexes is facilitated by lipid-soluble redox-active quinone molecules (Q). This work presents a structural analysis of the quinone-binding site (Q-site) identified in succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (SQR) from Escherichia coli. SQR, often referred to as Complex II or succinate dehydrogenase, is a functional member of the Krebs cycle and the aerobic respiratory chain and couples the oxidation of succinate to fumarate with the reduction of quinone to quinol (QH2). The interaction between ubiquinone and the Q-site of the protein appears to be mediated solely by hydrogen bonding between the O1 carbonyl group of the quinone and the side chain of a conserved tyrosine residue. In this work, SQR was co-crystallized with the ubiquinone binding-site inhibitor Atpenin A5 (AA5) to confirm the binding position of the inhibitor and reveal additional structural details of the Q-site. The electron density for AA5 was located within the same hydrophobic pocket as ubiquinone at, however, a different position within the pocket. AA5 was bound deeper into the site prompting further assessment using protein-ligand docking experiments in silico. The initial interpretation of the Q-site was re-evaluated in the light of the new SQR-AA5 structure and protein-ligand docking data. Two binding positions, the Q1-site and Q2-site, are proposed for the E. coli SQR quinone-binding site to explain these data. At the Q2-site, the side chains of a serine and histidine residue are suitably positioned to provide hydrogen bonding partners to the O4 carbonyl and methoxy groups of ubiquinone, respectively. This allows us to propose a mechanism for the reduction of ubiquinone during the catalytic turnover of the enzyme.

The Complex II family is comprised of two homologous integral membrane proteins (1Hägerhäll C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 107-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 2Cecchini G.

Succinate:quinone oxidoreductase (SQR), 4The abbreviations used are: SQR, succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase; QFR, menaquinol:fumarate oxidoreductase; AA5, atpenin A5; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase; DNP17, 2-(1-methylhexyl)-4,6-dinitrophenol; Q, quinone; QH2, quinol.4The abbreviations used are: SQR, succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase; QFR, menaquinol:fumarate oxidoreductase; AA5, atpenin A5; SDH, succinate dehydrogenase; DNP17, 2-(1-methylhexyl)-4,6-dinitrophenol; Q, quinone; QH2, quinol. or succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), is a functional member of the Krebs cycle and the aerobic respiratory chain coupling the oxidation of succinate to fumarate with the reduction of quinone (Q) to quinol (QH2). Quinol:fumarate oxidoreductase (QFR), or fumarate reductase, catalyzes the reverse reaction to SQR during anaerobic respiration. Both enzymes have a similar subunit and cofactor composition (1Hägerhäll C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1320: 107-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 2Cecchini G. Schröder I.

The hydrophilic subunits, composed of a flavoprotein (SdhA) and an iron-sulfur protein (SdhB), have a high degree of sequence homology across species. The SdhAB catalytic subunits are anchored to the membrane by the hydrophobic SdhCD subunits, which in the case of mammalian and Escherichia coli Complex II form a cytochrome b that contains one heme b. The two-electron oxidation of succinate at the substrate binding site in the SdhA subunit is coupled to the two-electron reduction of quinone in the membrane domain of Complex II. Electrons are sequentially transferred to ubiquinone (in the case of mammalian and E. coli Complex II) via an electron transport chain consisting of a covalently bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and three iron-sulfur centers ([2Fe-2S], [4Fe-4S], and [3Fe-4S]). The structures of SQRs and QFRs have been solved (5Iverson T.M. Luna-Chavez C. Cecchini G. Rees D.C. Science. 1999; 284: 1961-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 6Lancaster C.R.

Quinones can undergo 2e-/2H+ oxidation-reduction reactions, an essential feature of respiration, allowing the transfer of electrons between the respiratory complexes via the membrane-bound quinone pool. The high resolution crystal structures of a number of quinone-reactive membrane proteins have revealed their quinone-binding sites (Q-sites) and facilitated their detailed analysis. These structures and contributions from biochemical, mutagenic, inhibitor binding, EPR, and Fourier transform infrared studies have highlighted significant variation, and at times controversy, in the mechanisms and architecture of quinone binding. A weak sequence motif associated with the presence of a Q-site has been proposed (9Fisher N. Rich P.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1153-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar); however, currently no common architecture or universal catalytic mechanism can be applied to Q-sites in general. In addition to this, significant variability is seen for quinone binding in the same protein from different species, as for example in the bc1 complex (10Hunte C. Koepke J. Lange C. Rossmanith T. Michel H. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 669-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 11Berry E.A. Huang L.S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Different redox states of quinones may also adopt different conformations in the quinone-binding pockets as has been shown for the photosynthetic bacterial reaction center (12Stowell M.H.B. McPhillips T.M. Rees D.C. Soltis S.M. Abresch E. Feher G. Science. 1997; 276: 812-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). In the case of Complex II, a ubiquinone-binding site was found in SQR proximal to the [3Fe-4S] cluster (7Yankovskaya V. Horsefield R. Törnroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Miyoshi H. Léger C. Byrne B.

Cell. 2005; 121: 1043-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). In E. coli QFR, one functional menaquinone site is also found proximal to the [3Fe-4S] cluster (13Rothery R.A. Seime A.M. Spiers A.M. Maklashina E. Schroder I. Gunsalus R.P. Cecchini G. Weiner J.H. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 313-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), but its location and residue composition are very different to that of E. coli SQR. In addition, a second menaquinone-binding site, apparently not participating in electron transfer, is found on the distal side of the membrane (5Iverson T.M. Luna-Chavez C. Cecchini G. Rees D.C. Science. 1999; 284: 1961-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) at a position similar to a weak inhibitor-binding site in mammalian SQR (8Sun F. Huo X. Zhai Y. Wang A. Xu J. Su Bartiam. Rao Z. Cell. 2005; 121: 1043-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The Wolinella succinogenes QFR site for menaquinol oxidation has not yet been observed structurally (6Lancaster C.R. Kröger A. Auer M. Michel H. Nature. 1999; 402: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), however, mutagenic and kinetic data suggest that the site is located distal from the [3Fe-4S] cluster (14Lancaster C.R. Gross R. Haas R. Ritter M. Mantele W. Simon J. Kröger A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13051-13056Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The single E. coli SQR Q-site is homologous to that of mammalian SQR based on the absolute conservation of amino acids in contact with ubiquinone (7Yankovskaya V. Horsefield R. Törnroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Miyoshi H. Léger C. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 299: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 8Sun F. Huo X. Zhai Y. Wang A. Xu J. Su Bartiam. Rao Z. Cell. 2005; 121: 1043-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) suggesting the same mechanism for electron transfer to ubiquinone thus making it an excellent model system for mitochondrial Complex II research. This is of particular interest in humans, because mutations in Complex II results in various physiological disorders, including paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma tumors (15Parfait B. Chretien D. Rotig A. Marsac C. Munnich A. Rustin P. Hum. Genet. 2000; 106: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 16Baysal B.E. Rubinstein W.S. Taschner P.E. J. Mol.

Indeed, the nuclear SdhB, SdhC, and SdhD genes encoding Complex II are classed as tumor suppressor genes. Furthermore, in Caenorhabditis elegans the SdhC Gly-71 → Glu mutation (mev-1) causes premature aging resulting in a reduced life span and increased production of reactive oxygen species (18Ishii N. Fujii M. Hartman P.S. Tsuda M. Yasuda K. Senoo-Matsuda N. Yanase S. Ayusawa D. Suzuki K. Nature. 1998; 394: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). A similar effect has also been seen in a mouse model (19Ishii T. Yasuda K. Akatsuka A. Hino O. Hartman P.S. Ishii N. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 203-209PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of SQR from E. coli (7Yankovskaya V. Horsefield R. Törnroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Miyoshi H. Léger C. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 299: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) shows that the equivalent residues to those mutated in the paraganglioma and mev-1 phenotypes are located at the Q-site and may perturb quinone binding and/or reduction. A detailed understanding of the Q-site in Complex II and mechanism of quinone binding and reduction could assist the development of suitable treatments for these human disease states. In this work, we present the crystallographic and computational analysis of the Q-site of E. coli SQR using a specific and potent inhibitor, also known to be effective in mammalian Complex II. Previously, carboxin (20Ramsay R.R. Ackrell B.A.C. Coles C.J. Singer T.P. White G.A. Thorn G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Vinogradov A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 682: 491-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) had been used for the analysis of the Q-site of Complex II. More recently a new specific Q-site inhibitor for Complex II, Atpenin A5 (AA5), was reported and characterized (24Ōmura S. Tomoda H. Kimura K. Zhen D.-Z. Kumagai H. Igarashi K. Imamura N. Takahashi Y. Tanaka Y. Iwai Y. J. Antibiot. 1988; 41: 1769-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 25Miyadera N. Shiomi K. Ui H. Yamaguchi Y. Masuma R. Tomoda H. Miyoshi H. Osanai A. Kita K. Ōmura S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 473-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). SQR from E. coli is strongly inhibited by AA5 making it an excellent tool for the elucidation of the characteristics of the Complex II Q-site. Table 1 summarizes the structure and properties of some well characterized ubiquinone analogues and Complex II Q-site inhibitors.TABLE 1Summary of the chemical structures and properties of some well characterized ubiquinone analogues and Complex II Q-site inhibitorsNameAbbreviationChemical nameChemical structureNo. of rotatable bondsReference Open table in a new tab In the E. coli SQR structure (7Yankovskaya V. Horsefield R. Törnroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Miyoshi H. Léger C. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 299: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar) a tyrosine residue (Tyr-83) is proposed to be the primary ligand for ubiquinone; a binding position referred to here as the Q1-site. A tyrosine residue ligating quinone is a unique feature to SQR. However, new evidence, presented by this work, suggests that other residues located at the Q-site in Complex II could be directly involved in ubiquinone ligation and reduction during catalysis. The Q-site of E. coli SQR has been analyzed in detail using a combination of x-ray crystallography and computational chemistry to reveal that ubiquinone reduction may occur deeper within the Q-site than previously proposed (7Yankovskaya V. Horsefield R. Törnroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Miyoshi H. Léger C. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 299: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), at a position referred to here as the Q2-site. These studies suggest a mechanism for the reduction of ubiquinone during the catalytic turnover of this interesting respiratory enzyme. Expression, Purification, and Crystallization—These methods are as previously described (26Maklashina E. Berthold D.A. Cecchini G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5989-5996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Horsefield R. Yankovskaya V. Törnroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Stambouli E. Barber J. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S. Acta Cryst. 2003; D59: 600-602Google Scholar) with only minor modifications to the sample preparation following purification to introduce the inhibitor. Protein sample, containing ∼60 mg ml-1 of purified SQR in Buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.05% Thesit, pH 7.6) was diluted 1:10 with Buffer C plus 50 μm Atpenin A5 (AA5) and incubated at 4 °C for 14 h. Excess inhibitor was washed out by diluting (1:10) and re-concentrating the sample with Buffer C three times. The enzyme was then re-concentrated to ∼60 mg ml-1 and used to set up crystallization trials by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method as previously described (27Horsefield R. Yankovskaya V. Törnroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Stambouli E. Barber J. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S. Acta Cryst. 2003; D59: 600-602Google Scholar). Data Collection and Structure Determination—Crystals were frozen within 72 h of a trial set up for x-ray data collection. The crystals were soaked in cryo-protectant containing the crystallization condition reagents plus 30% polyethylene glycol 400. Diffraction data were collected at -170 °C to 3.0 Å resolution using an Area Detector Systems Corporation detector on beam line ID29 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, France. The x-ray diffraction from the crystals was anisotropic; there were reflections to 3.0 Å along the c axis, however, reflections beyond 3.5 Å resolution on the a and b axis plane were weak. Image data were processed to a resolution of 3.1 Å using the program packages DENZO and SCALE-PACK (28Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). All data better than -2.0σ(I) were used for scaling. The crystals belong to the trigonal space group R32 with cell dimensions of a = b = 138.75 Å, c = 521.87 Å and one molecule per asymmetric unit, very similar to those previously obtained (27Horsefield R. Yankovskaya V. Törnroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Stambouli E. Barber J. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S. Acta Cryst. 2003; D59: 600-602Google Scholar). Phase information was obtained from the native SQR structure (Protein Data Bank (PDB) 1NEK). A starting model for refinement was obtained by docking the AA5 inhibitor into the native structure with ubiquinone removed (PDB 1NEK less Q) using GOLD (31Verdonk M.L. Cole J.C. Hartshorn M.J. Murray C.W. Taylor R.D. Proteins. 2003; 52: 609-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2154) Google Scholar). The GOLD solutions were screened manually, one selected based on its fitness score, and that closely fitted the unrefined electron density and then its coordinates (see Fig. 2B) were combined with the native structure (PDB 1NEK less Q) to give the starting model. The program suite CNS (29Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L.

A 14 Å sphere of the protein structure containing the Q-site at the center was selected, and ubiquinone (Q) was removed. Hydrogens were added, and lone pairs were removed with the final format as .mol2. Prior to protein-ligand docking using the program GOLD 1.2 (31Verdonk M.L. Cole J.C. Hartshorn M.J. Murray C.W. Taylor R.D. Proteins. 2003; 52: 609-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2154) Google Scholar) several preparative steps were taken. The center of the Q-site was identified (x = 6.9, y = 4.9, and z =-24.4) and applied to docking calculations. Initially, the default input files and options of GOLD were used. Initial docking experiments were hindered by the program's persistence in docking the hydrophobic tail of the ligand into the Q-site instead of the reactive head group. This is due to the lack of a hydrophobic environment outside of the protein in silico (normally within the membrane in vivo). The favorable hydrophobic interactions file (fit_pts.mol2) was customized using Sybyl; the position and hydrophobic environment of the membrane was mimicked by adding additional dummy atoms outside the protein/Q-site to create a virtual membrane. Ligand Docking—An exhaustive docking approach was employed to identify all possible docking modes for each ligand, as described for the validation of GOLD (31Verdonk M.L. Cole J.C. Hartshorn M.J. Murray C.W. Taylor R.D. Proteins. 2003; 52: 609-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (2154) Google Scholar). Each docking solution was scored using the “goldscore” function and then screened manually (by eye) using Sybyl. Unreasonable solutions such as where the hydrophobic tail of ubiquinone docked where the quinone headgroup should be found were discarded; the remainders were grouped based on similarity, and several examples were selected for further analysis. The protein-ligand interactions were verified using the “Ligand Protein Contacts” online server (32Sobolev V. Sorokine A. Prilusky J. Abola E.E. Edelman M. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). The coordinates for the carboxin docking result (PDB 1NEK plus docked carboxin) is available from the PDB data base (PDB code 2AD0). Figure Preparation—Coordinate files associated with GOLD (.mol2 format) were converted to PDB format using the program Vega Open GL 1.5.1 (33Pedretti A. Villa L. Vistoli G. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 2002; 21: 47-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). All structure figures were prepared using PyMOL 0.98. 5W. L. DeLano (2002) The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA (www.pymol.org). The sequence alignment was made using the T-Coffee online server (35Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5337) Google Scholar) and edited using GeneDoc. 6K. B. Nicholas, H. B. Nicholas, and D. W. Deerfield (1997) EMBNEW News 4, 14 (www.psc.edu/biomed/genedoc). Analysis of the SQR-AA5 co-complex structure (PDB 2ACZ) reveals that the protein is essentially unchanged from the native SQR structure (PDB 1NEK) with the exception that the inhibitor replaces ubiquinone at the Q-site. In the native structure the side chains of Tyr-D83 and Trp-B164 are direct ligands of the O1 atom of ubiquinone (7Yankovskaya V. Horsefield R. Törnroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Miyoshi H. Léger C. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 299: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). There is, however, no amino acid side chain within proximity to the O4 carbonyl oxygen of the ubiquinone molecule in the native structure (Fig. 1A). Tyr-D83 forms an additional hydrogen bond to Arg-C31, and the Arg-C31 side chain is within 4 Å of the methoxy group of ubiquinone. The structure of SQR co-crystallized with 2-(1-methylhexyl)-4,6-dinitrophenol (DNP17, PDB 1NEN), a competitive inhibitor of SQR, binds at essentially the same position as ubiquinone in the native structure Fig. 1B (7Yankovskaya V. Horsefield R. Törnroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Miyoshi H. Léger C. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 299: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). By comparison to ubiquinone in the native structure (Fig. 1A), this study shows that AA5 binds deeper into the Q-site. The binding site of AA5, named the Q2-site (Fig. 2A), is at a very similar position to that suggested by the protein-ligand docking program GOLD when AA5 was docked into the native structure (Fig. 2B). Closer inspection of the protein environment at the Q2-site reveals that Ser-C27 is positioned such that it can hydrogen bond with the N4 and O5 atoms of AA5 (Fig. 2A), whereas the O1 interactions remain the same as for ubiquinone at the Q1-site in the native structure (Tyr-D83, Fig. 1A). In addition, these data are consistent with the fact that Ser-C27 is strictly conserved, as shown by the alignment of the SdhC sequences from a range of species (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3SdhC sequence alignment from a range of species. Residues that are 100%, 80%, and 60% conserved are highlighted in black, dark gray, and light gray, respectively. The conserved serine C27 is indicated by an arrow (▾). (Sequence alignment was made using T-Coffee (35Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. J. Mol.

In the native structure (7Yankovskaya V. Horsefield R. Törnroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Miyoshi H. Léger C. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 299: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), the Nτ atom of His-B207 was hydrogen-bonded to a heme b propionate based on the presence of strong electron density between the two atoms. To an extent, this is still the case when AA5 is bound at the site, but some additional electron density bridges the O3 atom of an AA5 methoxy group and His-B207 (∼2.8 Å) (Fig. 2A). Along with the spherical shape of the electron density for the side chain of this residue, this suggests that the histidine may exhibit multiple conformations in the crystal structures and probably during catalysis; the Nτ atom could interact with the AA5 methoxy group by a 180° rotation. This histidine residue is adjacent to Cys-B206, one of the ligands for the [3Fe-4S] cluster, which as a consequence positions it approximately equidistant between the three reduction centers: the [3Fe-4S] cluster, heme b, and the Q2-site. The proposal that a water molecule may act as the second ligand for ubiquinone (7Yankovskaya V. Horsefield R. Törnroth S. Luna-Chavez C. Miyoshi H. Léger C. Byrne B. Cecchini G. Iwata S.

https://openalex.org/W2024380558,"ISG15 is an interferon (IFN)-α/β-induced ubiquitin-like protein that is conjugated to cellular proteins during innate immune responses to viral and bacterial infections. A recent proteomics study identified 158 human proteins targeted for ISG15 conjugation, including the ISG15 E1 and E2 enzymes (Ube1L and UbcH8, respectively) and a HECT E3 enzyme, Herc5. Like the genes encoding Ube1L and UbcH8, expression of Herc5 was also induced by IFN-β, suggesting that Herc5 might be a component of the ISG15 conjugation system. Consistent with this, small interfering RNAs targeting Herc5 had a dramatic effect on overall ISG15 conjugation in human cells, abrogating conjugation to the vast majority of ISG15 target proteins in vivo. In addition, co-transfection of plasmids expressing ISG15, Ube1L, UbcH8, and Herc5 resulted in robust ISG15 conjugation in non-IFN-treated cells, while the active-site cysteine mutant of Herc5 or a mutant lacking the RCC1 repeat region did not support ISG15 conjugation. These results demonstrate that Herc5 is required for conjugation of ISG15 to a broad spectrum of target proteins in human cells.

Type 1 interferons play an essential role in innate immunity (1.Biron C.A. Sen G.C. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Field Virology. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2001: 321-351Google Scholar).

Like ubiquitin (Ub), Ubls are linked to target proteins via isopeptide bonds between their terminal carboxyl group and lysine side chains of target proteins (4.Jentsch S. Pyrowolakis G. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 335-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The fact that ISG15 is expressed and conjugated in IFN-α/β-stimulated cells and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cells implies that ISG15 conjugation is likely to mediate an important component of the innate immune response. This is supported by the finding that the influenza B virus NS1B protein specifically blocks ISG15 conjugation (5.Yuan W. Krug R.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The biochemical effect of ISG15 on target proteins is unknown; however, the recent identification of a large number of target proteins (6.Zhao C. Denison C. Huibregtse J.M. Gygi S. Krug R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10200-10205Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) provides opportunities for determining both the function of ISG15 and its role in the innate immune response. Also essential for functional studies is the identification of the complete set of enzymes required for ISG15 conjugation. As with Ub conjugation, it is presumed that a cooperating set of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes, in addition to possible accessory factors, will be required for ISG15 conjugation. The ISG15 E1 and E2 enzymes have been identified. Ube1L is a single-subunit enzyme 62% similar to the Ub E1 enzyme (5.Yuan W. Krug R.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), and UbcH8 is the major, if not exclusive, E2 enzyme for ISG15 (7.Kim K.I. Giannakopoulos N.V. Virgin H.W. Zhang D.E. Mol. Cell.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 4011-4019Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), suggesting that the entire conjugation system might be coordinately regulated. A candidate E3 enzyme for ISG15 conjugation emerged from mass spectrometry-based identification of ISG15 target proteins (6.Zhao C. Denison C. Huibregtse J.M. Gygi S. Krug R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10200-10205Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Proteomics analyses of SUMO- and Ub-conjugated proteins have shown that enzymatic components of Ub/Ubl conjugation pathways are often auto-conjugated (10.Denison C. Rudner A.D. Gerber S.A.

In addition, a single HECT E3, Herc5, was identified as an ISG15-modified protein, suggesting that this enzyme might also be a component of the ISG15 conjugation pathway. We show here that Herc5 is required for the conjugation of ISG15 to a broad spectrum of target proteins in vivo. Cell Culture, Plasmids, Antibodies, and siRNAs—HeLa and 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.

Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR and Microarray Analyses—Total RNA for RT-PCR was isolated using the PARIS kit (Ambion, Inc.). SuperscriptII reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) was used for cDNA synthesis, which was used as a template in subsequent PCR reactions. Initially, a range of PCR cycles was performed using cDNA from IFN-β-treated or untreated cells to determine the linear range of amplification for each gene, and these parameters were used for PCR shown in Figs. 1A and 2A. Microarray analyses were performed as described previously (14.Kelley M.L. Keiger K.E. Lee C.J. Huibregtse J.M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 3737-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).

Cells were treated with IFN-β (1,000 units/ml; Berlex) for the indicated times. Protein extracts were made in buffer containing 0.1 m Tris (pH 7.0), 0.1 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. To detect ISG15 conjugates, 30 μg of total cell proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with anti-ISG15 antibody. Plasmid DNA transfections were performed with HeLa cells at 80% confluence using GeneJuice transfection reagent (Novagen). Plasmids expressing Ube1L (0.25 μg), UbcH8 (0.25 μg), and ISG15 (0.5 μg) were transfected with or without Herc5-expressing plasmids (0.5 μg). Cells were harvested and lysed 48 h post-transfection and ISG15 conjugates were analyzed as described above. Herc5 is one of six human Herc proteins (HECT and RCC1), defined by a carboxyl-terminal HECT domain and by one or more RLDs (RCC1-like domains) (15.Hochrainer K. Mayer H. Baranyi U. Binder B. Lipp J. Kroismayr R. Genomics. 2005; 85: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Herc5 was a candidate for being a component of the ISG15 conjugation pathway based on the fact that it was identified as an ISG15-modified protein (6.Zhao C. Denison C. Huibregtse J.M. Gygi S. Krug R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10200-10205Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), and it belongs to the HECT family of E3 enzymes (16.Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2563-2567Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar), some of which can interact with UbcH8 (8.Zhao C. Beaudenon S.L. Kelley M.L. Waddell M.B. Yuan W. Schulman B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Krug R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7578-7582Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 17.Kumar S. Kao W.H. Howley P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13548-13554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To determine whether Herc5 plays a significant role in overall ISG15 conjugation, two synthetic double-stranded siRNAs (designated 5A and 5B) were designed to target Herc5 mRNA. The Herc6 protein is 49% identical to Herc5, and two siRNAs (6A and 6B) were therefore designed to target Herc6, as well as one siRNA that would simultaneously target both Herc5 and Herc6 (5/6). RT-PCR confirmed that transfection of the Herc5- and Herc6-specific siRNAs reduced Herc5 and Herc6 mRNA levels, respectively, in IFN-β-treated HeLa cells (Figs. 1A). siRNA 5/6 reduced both Herc5 and Herc6 mRNAs, and as shown below (Fig. 3C), all three siRNAs against Herc5 efficiently knocked down expression of Herc5 at the protein level. HeLa cells were transfected with the Herc5 or Herc6 siRNAs or, as a negative control, an siRNA against the E6AP HECT E3 (14.Kelley M.L. Keiger K.E. Lee C.J. Huibregtse J.M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 3737-3747Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and 6 h after transfection, IFN-β was added for an additional 48 h. Total cell extracts were prepared and ISG15 conjugates were analyzed by immunoblotting with an antibody against ISG15. Induction of ISG15 and high molecular weight ISG15 conjugates was observed in IFN-β-treated cells (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 1 and 2). Both of the Herc5-specific siRNAs and the siRNA that targeted Herc5 and Herc6 (5/6) resulted in a dramatic decrease in overall ISG15 conjugates (lanes 3–5), while neither of the Herc6-specific siRNAs or the E6AP siRNA led to a discernible decrease in ISG15 conjugates (lanes 6–8). Similar results were observed in 293 cells (data not shown). Combinations of Herc5 and Herc6 siRNAs were also transfected together, on the premise that potential Herc6-dependent effects might be more evident following reduction of Herc5 activity (Fig. 1C). For these experiments, a third Herc5 siRNA (5C) was used that elicited only a partial reduction in Herc5 activity (compare lanes 1–3). Co-transfection of Herc6 siRNA 6A with either Herc5 siRNA 5A or 5C did not elicit any further decrease in ISG15 conjugates relative to the Herc5 siRNAs alone. The effect of Herc5 and Herc6 siRNAs on conjugation of ISG15 to two specific target proteins (6.Zhao C. Denison C. Huibregtse J.M. Gygi S. Krug R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10200-10205Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), p56 and MxA, was also examined (Fig. 1D). The identification and validation of the IFN-β-induced ISG15-conjugated forms of both of these proteins was described previously (6.Zhao C. Denison C. Huibregtse J.M. Gygi S. Krug R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10200-10205Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Consistent with the effect of Herc5 siRNAs on total ISG15 conjugates, siRNAs that targeted Herc5 blocked conjugation to both p56 and MxA, while Herc6-specific siRNAs did not. We conclude that Herc5 plays a major role in mediating overall ISG15 conjugation to a broad spectrum of target proteins. We cannot rule out that Herc6 might also function in the ISG15 conjugation pathway, but if so, it clearly plays a minor role relative to Herc5. We determined whether expression of Herc5 and/or Herc6 was regulated by IFN-β by microarray gene expression analyses, comparing IFN-β-treated cells to untreated cells at various time points following addition of IFN-β (3, 6, and 21 h). Fig. 2A shows representations of the microarray elements corresponding to ISG15, Ube1L, UbcH8, Herc5, and Herc6 cDNAs, along with elements corresponding to three genes not expected to be affected by IFN-β treatment (E1Ub, UbcH7, and E6AP). The induction of ISG15, Ube1L, and UbcH8 was evident, along with both Herc5 and Herc6, with maximal induction over this time course at 21 h post-IFN-β treatment. This corresponds to the beginning of maximal accumulation of ISG15 conjugates (6.Zhao C. Denison C. Huibregtse J.M. Gygi S. Krug R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10200-10205Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 18.Liu M. Li X.L. Hassel B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1594-1602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Expression of E1Ub, UbcH7, and E6AP was not affected by IFN-β treatment. Fig. 2B shows that the time course and magnitude of Herc5 and Herc6 induction was similar to that of Ube1L and UbcH8. The regulation of Herc5 and Herc6 expression by IFN-β is consistent with the demonstrated importance of Herc5 in ISG15 conjugation, as well as a potential minor role for Herc6. Co-transfection of plasmids expressing ISG15, Ube1L, and UbcH8 leads to ISG15 conjugation in non-IFN-treated HeLa cells, although at a lower level than observed in IFN-β-treated cells (6.Zhao C. Denison C. Huibregtse J.M. Gygi S. Krug R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10200-10205Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). To determine whether this level of conjugation was due to a significant basal level of Herc5 expression, we transfected Herc5 siRNAs prior to co-transfection of plasmids expressing ISG15, Ube1L, and UbcH8. As shown in Fig. 3A, transfection of Herc5 siRNAs (5A, 5B, or 5/6) did indeed block ISG15 conjugation, while Herc6 siRNAs did not, indicating that a basal level of Herc5 expression is responsible for ISG15 conjugation in this context. We also determined whether co-transfection of a Herc5-expressing plasmid would further boost the level of ISG15 conjugates seen in non-IFN cells. In HeLa cells, transfection of a Herc5-expressing plasmid boosted ISG15 conjugation ∼3-fold over that seen with transfection of ISG15, Ube1L, and UbcH8 plasmids (Fig. 3B). Importantly, the Herc5 active-site mutant (C994A) did not stimulate ISG15 conjugation, indicating that the catalytic activity of Herc5 is required for its function in the ISG15 system. In 293 cells, co-transfection of wild-type Herc5 had a stronger effect on ISG15 conjugation, with a 10–20-fold stimulation. Because a Herc5-specific antibody was not available, we took advantage of our epitope-tagged (HA and TAP) Herc5 expression vectors to confirm that all three Herc5 siRNAs effectively knocked-down Herc5 at the protein level (Fig. 3C). The 5A, 5B, and 5/6 siRNAs resulted in a dramatic reduction of HA-Herc5 protein, while neither of the Herc6 siRNAs, an siRNA against E6AP nor a UbcH8-specific siRNA, affected HA-Herc5 protein levels. Identical results were seen using a TAP-tagged Herc5 expression vector (data not shown). Only the E6AP-specific siRNA affected the level of the endogenous E6AP HECT E3. The 293 cell transfection system was used to analyze the effect of two additional Herc5 mutants. Herc5 deleted of the first 381 amino acids, which includes all of the RCC1 repeats, did not support robust ISG15 conjugation, although some stimulation of high molecular weight conjugates was still detected (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 5 and 6). This indicates that the RCC1 repeats are important for overall ISG15 conjugation but that they are perhaps not required for modification of all target proteins. While the HECT domains of Herc5 and Herc6 represent the most conserved region of the two proteins (67% identity), they differ in the position of a conserved phenylalanine residue found at the fourth position from the carboxyl terminus of most HECT E3s (-4F). This residue was previously shown to play a role in promoting ubiquitin conjugation (19.Salvat C. Wang G. Dastur A. Lyon N. Huibregtse J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18935-18943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In Herc5, this phenylalanine is at the second from last position (-2F), while in Herc6 it is at the ninth from last position (-9F). We tested whether this difference might be related to the ability of Herc5 to function in the ISG15 pathway by replacing the last residue of Herc5 (FG) with the last eight residues of Herc6 (FVSPMLTGS). Fig. 3C shows that this mutant (C5–6; lane 7) stimulated ISG15 conjugation as efficiently as wild-type Herc5. The divergent carboxyl-terminal tails are therefore not the basis for the functional difference between Herc5 and Herc6 in the ISG15 system. UbcH8 is the only E2 enzyme known to function in ISG15 conjugation (8.Zhao C. Beaudenon S.L. Kelley M.L. Waddell M.B. Yuan W. Schulman B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Krug R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7578-7582Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), and as expected, Herc5-dependent stimulation of ISG15 conjugation was not evident upon co-transfection with UbcH7 (Fig. 3E, lanes 2 and 5). In addition, a single amino acid mutation at residue 62 of UbcH8 (F62A) abrogated Herc5-dependent ISG15 conjugation. F62 of UbcH8 represents a conserved residue among E2 proteins that have been shown to interact with HECT E3s (e.g. UbcH5 isoforms, UbcH6, UbcH7, UbcH8), and both biochemical and structural experiments have indicated that this residue is critical for the ability of E2s to interact with the HECT domain (20.Huang L. Kinnucan E. Wang G. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Huibregtse J.M. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 286: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 21.Nuber U. Scheffner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7576-7582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The fact that the F62A mutation of UbcH8 abrogated Herc5-dependent ISG15 conjugation is consistent with a model in which UbcH8 directly interacts with Herc5 in mediating ISG15 conjugation. The results presented here show that the Herc5 HECT E3 enzyme is required for conjugation of ISG15 to a broad range, and potentially the complete range, of natural ISG15 target proteins. The coordinate induction by IFN-β of ISG15, Ube1L, UbcH8, and Herc5 is also consistent with a central role for Herc5 in the conjugation system. The most straightforward model for the involvement of Herc5 in the ISG15 system is that it participates directly as an ISG15 ligase, as part of an ISG15 transthiolation cascade from Ube1L to UbcH8 to Herc5, with Herc5 catalyzing ISG15-target protein conjugation. This model is supported by our proteomic analysis of ISG15-conjugated proteins, where Ube1L, UbcH8, and Herc5 were all identified as ISG15-conjugated proteins (6.Zhao C. Denison C. Huibregtse J.M. Gygi S. Krug R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10200-10205Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In addition, a HECT E3 enzyme that can interact with UbcH8 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rsp5) was shown to form an ISG15 thioester intermediate and catalyze ISG15 conjugation in vitro (8.Zhao C. Beaudenon S.L. Kelley M.L. Waddell M.B. Yuan W. Schulman B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Krug R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7578-7582Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). This indicates that there are no inherent structural impediments that prevent at least some HECT E3s from catalyzing ISG15 conjugation. One approach to prove that Herc5 participates directly as an ISG15 ligase would be to establish an in vitro system in which Herc5 forms an ISG15 thioester and conjugates ISG15 to a natural ISG15 target protein. However, we have not yet succeeded in preparing purified recombinant Herc5 protein or protein fragments (e.g. the HECT domain alone) that can be activated with either ubiquitin or ISG15 in vitro. In the absence of such an in vitro system, we cannot rule out alternative models for the role of Herc5 in ISG15 conjugation. For example, it is conceivable that Herc5 might catalyze a ubiquitination event that is a prerequisite for ISG15 conjugation. However, siRNA-mediated depletion of the E1Ub enzyme did not result in any decrease in Herc5-dependent ISG15 conjugation activity in non-IFN-treated cells (data not shown). Regardless of the mechanism, the results presented here demonstrate that Herc5 plays a central and necessary role in ISG15 conjugation in vivo. A proteomics-based approach identified 158 ISG15 target proteins at a very high confidence level (6.Zhao C. Denison C. Huibregtse J.M. Gygi S. Krug R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10200-10205Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). If Herc5 acts directly as an ISG15 E3 enzyme, this would imply that this single E3 has the capacity to recognize, either directly or indirectly, a large number of target proteins. SUMO conjugation utilizes a relatively small number of E3s (two major PIAS family proteins in S. cerevisiae); however, in this case a small consensus site on target proteins is often a determinant for recognition by the SUMO conjugation machinery (22.Johnson E.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 355-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). Analysis of target proteins identified to date has not revealed a motif common to target proteins that might be directly recognized by Herc5. An alternative is that additional cellular proteins or factors might mediate the interaction of Herc5 with individual target proteins or subsets of target proteins. Our previous demonstration that at least some HECT E3s have the capacity to catalyze ISG15 conjugation in vitro (8.Zhao C. Beaudenon S.L. Kelley M.L. Waddell M.B. Yuan W. Schulman B.A. Huibregtse J.M. Krug R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7578-7582Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) raises the question of what might limit the participation of HECT E3s other than Herc5 from participating in the ISG15 conjugation system. The involvement of accessory or “licensing” factors might explain how other HECT E3s are prevented from catalyzing ISG15 conjugation. Of the six human Herc proteins (Herc1–6), Herc6 is the most similar to Herc5 (50% identical), and its expression is also induced by IFN-β. While we did not detect an effect of Herc6 siRNAs on overall ISG15 conjugation, it is possible that Herc6 plays a minor role in ISG15 conjugation, perhaps targeting a limited set of proteins compared with Herc5. Further biochemical comparisons of Herc5 and Herc6 will be important for identifying the determinants of Herc5 that confer its dominant function in the ISG15 system. While several mammalian species appear to have direct Herc5 homologs (primates, cow, dog), rodents (mice, rats) do not. It was speculated that Herc5 is evolutionarily the most recent Herc family member and resulted from duplication of the physically adjacent Herc6 gene (15.Hochrainer K. Mayer H. Baranyi U. Binder B. Lipp J. Kroismayr R. Genomics. 2005; 85: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that Herc6 plays a major role in ISG15 conjugation in rodents. In addition to Herc5 and Herc6, our microarray analysis identified several TRIM (tripartite motif) proteins that were induced by IFN-β, some of which have been shown to function as Ub E3s (23.Urano T. Saito T. Tsukui T. Fujita M. Hosoi T. Muramatsu M. Ouchi Y. Inoue S. Nature. 2002; 417: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 24.Xu L. Yang L. Moitra P.K. Hashimoto K. Rallabhandi P. Kaul S. Meroni G. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. D'Arpa P. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 288: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and at least one of which (TRIM25/Efp) has been reported to interact with UbcH8 (23.Urano T. Saito T. Tsukui T. Fujita M. Hosoi T. Muramatsu M. Ouchi Y. Inoue S. Nature. 2002; 417: 871-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). siRNAs that targeted two of these proteins (TRIM22 and TRIM25/Efp) had no effect on the overall pattern or accumulation of ISG15 conjugates nor did transfection of TRIM22 or TRIM25 expression vectors boost or alter the overall pattern of ISG15 conjugates (data not shown). We conclude that these ligases do not play a broad role in ISG15 conjugation or, alternatively, function downstream of Herc5. The demonstration that Herc5 is required for ISG15 conjugation to a broad spectrum of target proteins in human cells will facilitate analysis of effects of ISG15 conjugation on target proteins and elucidation of the role of ISG15 conjugation in anti-viral and anti-microbial responses.

To elucidate the contribution of fibrillin-rich microfibrils to organogenesis, we have examined the vascular phenotype of a newly created strain of mice that completely lacks fibrillin-1 and the consequences of combined deficiency of fibrillins 1 and 2 on tissue formation. The results demonstrated that fibrillins 1 and 2 perform partially overlapping functions during aortic development. Fbn1-/- mice died soon after birth from ruptured aortic aneurysm, impaired pulmonary function, and/or diaphragmatic collapse. Analysis of the neonatal Fbn1-/- aorta documented a disorganized and poorly developed medial layer but normal levels of elastin cross-links. Transcriptional profiling revealed that aneurysm progression in Fbn1 null mice is accompanied by unproductive up-regulation of gene products normally involved in tissue repair and vascular integrity, such as plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, activin A, and cysteine-rich angiogenic protein 61. In contrast to Fbn1-/- mice, Fbn2 null mice had a well developed and morphologically normal aortic wall. However, virtually all Fbn1-/-;Fbn2-/- embryos and about half of the Fbn1+/-;Fbn2-/- embryos died in utero and displayed a significantly more severe vascular phenotype than Fbn1-/- mice. Consistent with a specialized function of fibrillin-2, electron microscopy visualized ultrastructurally different microfibrils in Fbn1 null compared with control cell cultures. Collectively, these data demonstrate that involvement of fibrillin-2 in the initial assembly of the aortic matrix overlaps in part with fibrillin-1 and that continued fibrillin-1 deposition is absolutely required for the maturation and function of the vessel during neonatal life.

Elastogenesis is a complex biological process that involves the organized deposition and self-assembly of several macromolecules into microfibrils and elastic fibers (1Mecham R.P. Davis E. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure.in: Yurchenco P.D. Birk D.E. Mecham R.P. Academic Press, Inc., New York1994: 281-314Crossref Google Scholar). Elastic fibers are made of an amorphous core of cross-linked elastin and other molecules and microfibrils; the latter are heterogeneous in composition and can also form macroaggregates devoid of elastin (2Handford P.A. Downing A.K. Reinhardt D.P. Sakai L.Y. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 3Kielty C.M. Sherratt M.J. Shuttleworth C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2817-2828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fibrillins 1 and 2 are the main structural components of extracellular microfibrils and the defective gene products in Marfan syndrome (MFS) 3The abbreviations used are: MFS, Marfan syndrome; CCA, congenital contractural arachnodactyly; CYR61, cysteine-rich angiogenic protein 61; Fbn1 and Fbn2, the mouse genes coding for fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2, respectively; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cells; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase. and congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA), respectively (4Ramirez F.

C Embryo Today. 2004; 72: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). MFS is a pleiotropic disorder of the connective tissue with wide variation in clinical severity (6Pyeritz R.E. Principles and Practice of Medical Genetics.in: Rimoin D.L. Connor J.M. Pyeritz R.E. Korf B.R. 4th Ed. Churchill Livingstone, New York, NY2002: 3977-4020Google Scholar). Cardiovascular manifestations in the form of aortic dilatation, dissection, and rupture contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality in affected individuals. CCA, on the other hand, is a rare condition akin to MFS but with major manifestations confined to the musculoskeletal system (6Pyeritz R.E. Principles and Practice of Medical Genetics.in: Rimoin D.L. Connor J.M. Pyeritz R.E. Korf B.R. 4th Ed. Churchill Livingstone, New York, NY2002: 3977-4020Google Scholar). Fibrillins are large cysteine-rich glycoproteins (∼350 kDa) composed primarily of multiple repeated domains homologous to the calcium binding epidermal growth factor module and of distinct 8-cysteine modules (2Handford P.A. Downing A.K. Reinhardt D.P. Sakai L.Y. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 457-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 3Kielty C.M. Sherratt M.J. Shuttleworth C.A. J.

C Embryo Today. 2004; 72: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Fibrillins polymerize into a characteristic beads-on-a-string microfibril structure, which gives rise to the microfibril lattice by lateral association of the individual microfibril polymers and probable association of other structural components. Fibrillins can form homo- or heteropolymeric microfibrils and can interact with integrins, growth factors, several other matrix components, and latent transforming growth factor β-binding proteins. Differential expression of elastic fiber components, dynamic cell-matrix interactions, and microfibril-mediated modulation of signaling molecules account for the diverse architectures and functions of elastic networks during the development and growth of individual organ systems (5Charbonneau N.L. Ono R.N. Corson G.M. Keene D.R. Sakai L.Y. Birth Defects Res. C Embryo Today. 2004; 72: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The process of aortic media formation is an illustrative example of the interplay between resident cells and elastic fiber components that ultimately results in the highly organized and functionally competent tissue (7Brooke B.S. Karnik S.K. Li D.Y. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 51-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 8Kelleher C.M. McLean S.E. Mecham R.P. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2005; 62: 153-188Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar). At about mid-gestation, vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) deposit fibrillins and tropoelastin molecules into the surrounding matrix and begin to organize them into elastic fibers. The latter process extends into early neonatal life accompanied by the gradual growth of elastic fibers into mature elastic lamellae that separate parallel layers of quiescent VSMC. The resulting organization of the tunica media into a multilayered structure of alternating VSMC and elastic lamellae (also known as the lamellar unit) is the main determinant of arterial function. Genetic studies in mice have demonstrated that different molecules participate in the various steps responsible for the maturation and function of the arterial wall. Fibulin-5 has been reported to regulate initial assembly of the elastic fiber by providing the molecular bridge between tropoelastin in the pericellular space and integrins on the surface of VSMC, whereas lysyl oxidase-like protein-1 is believed to spatially restrict elastin polymerization by interacting with fibulin-5 (9Yanagisawa H.

Elastin, on the other hand, is thought to promote the quiescent phenotype of VSMC as well as to influence vascular morphogenesis in response to hemodynamic stress (12Li D.Y. Faury G. Taylor D.G.

Recently, a similar role in vascular remodeling and VSMC proliferation has also been assigned to fibulin-5 (14Spencer J.A. Hacker S.L. Davis E.C. Mecham R.P. Knutsen R.H Li D.Y. Gerard R.D.

Finally, the enzyme lysyl oxidase has been shown to stabilize the aortic wall by mediating the extracellular conversion of tropoelastin molecules into the insoluble elastic meshwork (15Mäki J.M.

Three mouse strains harboring distinct mutations in the fibrillin-1 (Fbn1) gene have been created thus far that faithfully replicate the spectrum of clinical severity in MFS (17Pereira L. Andrikopoulos K. Tian J. Lee S.Y. Keene D.R. Ono R. Reinhardt D.P. Sakai L.Y. Jensen-Biery N. Bunton T. Dietz H.C. Ramirez F. Nat.

Investig. 2004; 114: 172-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The mutations include the substitution of an obligatory cysteinyl residue in a calcium binding epidermal growth factor motif (C1039G) and a hypomorphic in-frame deletion (mgΔ), which in homozygosity mimic the neonatal lethal form of MFS, and a hypomorphic mutation (mgR) that produces ∼15% of the normal amount of wild-type fibrillin-1 and which in homozygosity recapitulates the adult lethal form of MFS. Ruptured aortic aneurysm in these mutant mice is associated with morphologically normal elastic fibers between focal lesions and in unaffected tissues. Hence, the notion followed that fibrillin-1 microfibrils play a predominant role in maintaining tissue integrity rather than controlling aortic development (17Pereira L. Andrikopoulos K. Tian J. Lee S.Y. Keene D.R. Ono R. Reinhardt D.P. Sakai L.Y. Jensen-Biery N. Bunton T. Dietz H.C. Ramirez F. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 18Pereira L. Lee S.Y.

The fact that fibrillin-2 is generally produced earlier than fibrillin-1 and primarily during fetal development was originally interpreted to suggest a predominant role for this molecule in organizing matrix assembly (20Zhang H. Hu W. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1165-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). However, the validity of this hypothesis was subsequently questioned by the finding that ablation of fibrillin-2 production in mice affected BMP signaling and digit formation but had no apparent effect on elastogenesis (21Arteaga-Solis E. Garyraud B. Lee S.Y. Shum L. Sakai L. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Whereas the above studies were instrumental in delineating pathogenic events in MFS, they left unresolved the issue of the role of fibrillin-1 microfibrils during development. The present study was, therefore, designed to elucidate the contribution of fibrillin-1 to organogenesis, specifically to aortic development, by creating a new line of mutant mice that completely lacks fibrillin-1. Availability of these mutant mice also enabled us to assess whether or not fibrillins 1 and 2 have redundant functions in organ formation by examining aortic wall development in the progeny of intercrosses of Fbn1 and Fbn2 heterozygous null mice. The results of these studies are the first to document the critical role of fibrillin-1 in the maturation of the aortic wall and of fibrillin-rich microfibrils in tissue development. They are also the first to demonstrate partial redundancy between fibrillins 1 and 2 in promoting matrix formation and to indicate the potential for specific functions in this process. Generation of Fbn1 Null Mice—Engineering and electroporation of the targeting vector as well as selection and analysis of mouse embryonic stem cells and generation of mutant mice were performed as previously described (17Pereira L. Andrikopoulos K. Tian J. Lee S.Y. Keene D.R. Ono R. Reinhardt D.P. Sakai L.Y. Jensen-Biery N. Bunton T. Dietz H.C. Ramirez F. Nat.

Targeting of the Fbn1 gene substituted ∼700 bp of exon 1, which included the ATG codon and the signal peptide coding sequence, with the phosphoglycerate kinase-neo cassette and the alkaline phosphatase gene containing an internal ribosome entry site (Fig. 1A). Four positively targeted embryonic stem cell clones were injected into blastocysts and yielded mutant mice with identical phenotypes. Gene-targeted animals were generated at the Mount Sinai Mouse Genetics Shared Resource Facility (New York). Characterization of the mutation employed Northern and Western analyses on tissue samples and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, respectively (22Gayraud B. Keene D.R. Sakai L.Y. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 667-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Mice were genotyped by PCR amplification using the following primers and conditions: 5′-GCGGACGATACTTGAAGAGG-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-TGCCTACACGGTCTTAATGG-3′ (reverse primer), 95 °C for 1 min, 51 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min (wild-type allele); 5′-GAGGCTATTCGGCTATGACT-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CTCTTCGTCCAGATCATCCT-3′ (reverse primer), 95 °C for 1 min, 57 °C for 1 min,and 72 °C for 1 min (mutant allele). The frequency of the different genotypes in the progeny from the intercrosses between heterozygous null Fbn1 and Fbn2 mice was evaluated using Fischer's exact test assuming a p value of ≤0.05 as significant. Histological and Ultrastructural Analyses—Embryos and newborn mice (4-10 per genotype) were processed as described previously (17Pereira L. Andrikopoulos K. Tian J. Lee S.Y. Keene D.R. Ono R.

Paraffin-embedded sections were serially sectioned at 7 μm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and adjacent sections were assayed with Weigert stain for elastic fibers and Masson trichrome for collagen. For immunohistochemistry, tissue sections were dewaxed and washed in Tris-buffered saline buffer and then subjected to antigen retrieval, blocking, and primary antibody incubation. Primary antibodies included SMemb (1:100; Covance, Berkeley; CA) and MMP-9 (1:300; Chemicon, Temecula, CA). After removal of the unbound antibodies, sections were incubated with biotin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, or anti-rat IgG (1:500; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 1 h at room temperature followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (1:500; Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) for 15 min at room temperature. Sections were finally washed, incubated with amino ethyl carbazole chromogen solution (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) to localize the antibody, and counterstained with H&E. Processed tissue samples were viewed under a light microscope Nikon Eclipse E-800 (Nikon Instruments Inc., Yokohama, Japan), and micrographs were taken with an RT Slider (Diagnostic Instruments Inc, Sterling Heights, MI). For ultrastructural analyses, wild-type and heterozygous and homozygous mutant neonatal fibroblasts were cultured for 1 month. Cell layers scraped up into 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.4 m NaCl, and 0.2 g/ml (wet weight) were incubated for 3 h at room temperature in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.4 m NaCl, 5 mm CaC12, 0.1 mg/ml Type 1A collagenase (Sigma), 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide. The suspension was centrifuged for 15 min at 7500 × g, the supernatant was applied to Sepharose CL-2B (1.5 × 50 cm, flow rate 0.3 ml/min), equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.4 m NaCl, and the void volume peak was pooled and concentrated. After dialyzing against water, the microfibrils were visualized by electron microscopy after rotary shadowing or negative staining (23Isogai Z. Aspberg A. Keene D.R. Ono R.N. Reinhardt D.P.

Tissue Desmosine Assay—Wild-type and mutant thoracic aortas were collected from E16.5 embryos and P10 mice. Tissue samples containing between 0.02 and 0.5 mg of protein were processed as previously described. Desmosine was quantified by radioimmunoassay in 10-40 ml of sample according to Starcher and Conrad (24Starcher B. Condrad M. Connect. Tissue Res. 1995; 31: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Samples from 3-4 animals were tested for each developmental stage and genotype, and 3-7 samples were independently tested for each aorta. Values were expressed as percentage of desmosine cross-links relative to total protein content, and their statistical value was assessed using Student's t test, assuming a p value ≤0.05 as significant. Immunoblots—Western blots were performed on protein extracts from aortas of wild-type and mutant mice sacrificed at P14 using antibodies against phosphorylated Smad2 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, CA) or from the post-mortem tissue of mutant mice using anti-MMP-9 antiserum; in both cases, anti-β-tubulin antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Charlottesville, VA) was used as a control. Protein extracts (25 μg/lane) were electrophoresed in a 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel and electroblotted onto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The membrane was then subjected to two sequential incubations of12 h at 4°Cand 1 h at room temperature in rabbit anti-phosphorylated Smad2 (1:1000) antisera or in mouse anti-MMP-9 antiserum (1:200) and in a peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:50,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) in the presence of 5% (w/v) skimmed milk in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive products were visualized by chemiluminescence using the ECL Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences), and their relative intensity was evaluated with Photoshop software (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). Statistical significance of the results was evaluated using the Student's t test assuming a p value ≤ 0.05 as significant. RNA Analyses—Total RNA was extracted from the thoracic aortas of wild-type and mutant mice sacrificed at P14 using the RNeasy fibrous tissues kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Real-time PCR was performed on RNA purified from the aortas of wild-type (n = 3) and Fbn1 null (n = 3) mice using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-CTGCTCGCCGGCTTGTTGGTTC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CGGCGGGGCAGGTGGAGAG-3′ (reverse primer) (Cry61/Cnn1; accession number NM_010516); 5′-GTGCAACCCTGGCCGACTTCA-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-GACGCCACTGTGCCGCTCTC-3′ (reverse primer) (Pai-1; accession number NM_008871); 5′-GCAGCTTGGACACGGGGGATGAG-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-GGCGCTGGATGCTGCTGGACA-3′ (reverse primer) [activin A; accession number NM_008380]; 5′-GAATAACGGCTACAGCAACAGGGTGGTGGAC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-AGTGTTGGGGGCCGAGTTGGGATAGG-3′ (reverse primer) (Gapdh; accession number NM_001001303). Samples were transcribed with Sensiscript Kit (Qiagen) and PCR-amplified in a 25-μl reaction of IQ SYBR Supermix kit (Bio-Rad) that included 12.5 μl of PCR master mix, 2.5 pmol of each amplification primer, and 30 ng of original template RNA. Each sample was run in triplicate with an initial 10-min reaction at 95 °C for reverse transcription followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and at 60 °C for 1 min. Amplification data were collected using the iCycler system and analyzed with the iCycler IQ 3.1 system software (Bio-Rad). Relative RNA concentrations were calculated from the threshold cycle (CT) at which fluorescence is first detected using the comparative method 2-ΔΔCT (25Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D.

Loss of Fibrillin-1 Results in Early Onset Vascular Disease and Neonatal Lethality—A Fbn1 null allele (mgN) was created by targeting part of the exon 1 sequence to investigate the potential role of fibrillin-1 during embryonic development and postnatal growth (Fig. 1A). Germ line transmission of the mgN allele was monitored by Southern hybridization using diagnostic DNA sites (Fig. 1B). Northern analysis of neonatal lung tissue and Western analysis of conditioned media from mouse embryonic fibroblast cultures documented loss of Fbn1 gene activity in homozygous mutant mice (Fig. 1, C and D). The Western data also ruled out the possibility that increased fibrillin-2 production may compensate for loss of fibrillin-1 (Fig. 1D). Reverse transcription-PCR amplification of aortic RNA independently corroborated this last conclusion (data not shown). Heterozygous and homozygous mgN mutant mice were born at the expected Mendelian frequency. Whereas mgN/+ mice were viable and fertile, all mgN/mgN mice died within the first 2 weeks of postnatal life from ruptured aortic aneurysm, impaired pulmonary function, and/or diaphragmatic collapse. Findings at necroscopy included aortic aneurysm with documented hemothorax or hemopericardium, severely affected lungs with abnormal enlargement of the alveolar space, and abdominal organs within the chest cavity (Fig. 2A and data not shown). Additionally, all mgN/mgN mice displayed grossly malformed and elongated ribs, seemingly thinner intercostal muscles, and unusually fragile skin and internal organs upon manipulation of the carcasses (Fig. 2A and data not shown). Interestingly, aneurysm in Fbn1 null mice involved the ascending rather than the root of the aorta, a finding at variance with the phenotype of the other Fbn1 mutant mice and MFS patients (Fig. 2A) (6Pyeritz R.E.

Light microscopic examination of H&E or Weigert-stained cross-sections of aortic lesions from dead mutant mice revealed a significant disorganization of the lamellar units in the medial layer (Fig. 2B). Elastic fibers had an abnormally wavy and thin appearance and were fragmented and discontinuous, whereas VSMC had lost their contacts with neighboring cells and surrounding matrix and were misoriented (Fig. 2B). Similarly, trichrome staining revealed discontinuity of collagen in the aortic lamellae (Fig. 2B). However, additional findings that characterize late lesions of mgR/mgR mice, such as excessive matrix accumulation and advential hyperplasia (18Pereira L. Lee S.Y. Gayraud B. Andrikopoulos K. Shapiro S.D. Bunton T. Jensen-Biery N. Dietz H.C. Sakai L.Y. Ramirez F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Likewise, elevated VSMC expression of MMP-9 was reproducibly seen only in the decaying aortic tissue of dead mgN/mgN mice (Fig. 2B). By contrast, two histopathological findings were unique to mgN/mgN mice. First, the endothelial lining was often detached in both pre- and post-mortem specimens of mutant mice, consistent with the loss of structural connections between the intimal and medial layers (Fig. 3A) (26Davis E.C. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 727-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the abnormal morphology of the lamellar unit was not restricted to lesions, as in other Fbn1 mutant mice, but involved the whole aorta (Fig. 3B) (17Pereira L. Andrikopoulos K. Tian J.

This last observation raised the possibility that loss of fibrillin-1 microfibrils may interfere with the maturation of the elastic vessel wall in this particular mouse model of ruptured aortic aneurysm. Loss of Fibrillin-1 Perturbs Maturation of the Aortic Wall—To test the above hypothesis, we compared the development of mutant and wild-type aortas from embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5), when elastic fibers begin to form in the extracellular space (7Brooke B.S.

Biol. 2005; 62: 153-188Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar), to post-natal day 14 (P14), when the majority of mgN/mgN mice die. The analyses documented the appearance of thinner and disorganized elastic lamellae in the mutant mice that developed between P10 and P14 (Fig. 4A). Antibodies against an embryonic VSMC marker (non-muscular myosin heavy chain-B; SMemb) revealed relatively stronger immunostaining in the mutant than in the wild-type tissue during fetal development as well as persistence of SMemb expression postnatally when the gene is normally turned off (Fig. 4B) (27Kuro-o M.

VSMC proliferation and apoptosis and matrix production were instead largely the same in mutant and wild-type littermates (data not shown). We concluded from these results that loss of fibrillin-1 microfibrils interferes with the normal process of aortic wall maturation, especially during neonatal life when both cellular and architectural effects were seen. Despite the absence of histological evidence for a fibroproliferative response, an ongoing transcriptional profiling of fibrillin mutant mice nonetheless revealed that genes involved in tissue repair processes are up-regulated in the aorta of mgN/mgN mice. 4L.

https://openalex.org/W2035556394,"Although NPC1L1 is required for intestinal cholesterol absorption, data demonstrating mechanisms by which this protein facilitates the process are few. In this study, a hepatoma cell line stably expressing human NPC1L1 was established, and cholesterol uptake was studied. A relationship between NPC1L1 intracellular trafficking and cholesterol uptake was apparent. At steady state, NPC1L1 proteins localized predominantly to the transferrin-positive endocytic recycling compartment, where free cholesterol also accumulated as revealed by filipin staining. Interestingly, acute cholesterol depletion induced with methyl-β-cyclodextrin stimulated relocation of NPC1L1 to the plasma membrane, preferentially to a newly formed apical-like subdomain. This translocation was associated with a remarkable increase in cellular cholesterol uptake, which in turn was dose-dependently inhibited by ezetimibe, a novel cholesterol absorption inhibitor that specifically binds to NPC1L1. These findings define a cholesterol-regulated endocytic recycling of NPC1L1 as a novel mechanism regulating cellular cholesterol uptake."

Here we show the molecular mechanism of activation of this pathway. Exposure of bovine aortic endothelial cells to ONOO- significantly increased the phosphorylation of both Thr172 of AMPK and Ser1179 of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase, a known downstream enzyme of AMPK. In addition, activation of AMPK by ONOO- was accompanied by increased phosphorylation of protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ) (Thr410/403) and translocation of cytosolic PKCζ into the membrane. Further, inhibition of PKCζ abrogated ONOO--induced AMPK-Thr172 phosphorylation as that of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase. Furthermore, overexpression of a constitutively active PKCζ mutant enhanced the phosphorylation of AMPK-Thr172, suggesting that PKCζ is upstream of AMPK activation. In contrast, ONOO- activated PKCζ in LKB1-deficient HeLa-S3 but affected neither AMPK-Thr172 nor AMPK activity. These data suggest that LKB1 is required for PKCζ-enhanced AMPK activation. In vitro, recombinant PKCζ phosphorylated LKB1 at Ser428, resulting in phosphorylation of AMPK at Thr172. Further, direct mutation of Ser428 of LKB1 into alanine, like the kinase-inactive LKB1 mutant, abolished ONOO--induced AMPK activation. In several cell types originating from human, rat, and mouse, inhibition of PKCζ significantly attenuated the phosphorylation of both LKB1-Ser428 and AMPK-Thr172 that were enhanced by ONOO-. Taken together, we conclude that PKCζ can regulate AMPK activity by increasing the Ser428 phosphorylation of LKB1, resulting in association of LKB1 with AMPK and consequent AMPK Thr172 phosphorylation by LKB1.

Because AMPK activation could have beneficial metabolic consequences for diabetic patients, AMPK has emerged as a potential target for the treatment of obesity and type II diabetes (reviewed in Refs. 3Winder W.W.

AMPK is an obligatory heterotrimer containing catalytic α subunit and regulatory β and γ subunits, each of which occur in at least two isoforms. Activation of AMPK absolutely requires its phosphorylation at Thr172 in the activation loop of α1 and α2 subunits by one or more upstream kinases (AMPKKs) (21Dyck J.R. Gao G. Widmer J. Stapleton D.

The major breakthrough in identifying the first AMPKK came from research on the regulation of the AMPK ortholog Snf-1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (23Hong S.P. Leiper F.C. Woods A. Carling D.

Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The T-loop residue of Snf-1 was phosphorylated by a group of three related protein kinases bearing homology to mammalian LKB1, which was subsequently identified by several laboratories as being the major upstream kinase for AMPK (25Hawley S.A.

LKB1 was found to co-purify with liver AMPK and to phosphorylate recombinant AMPK complexes. In addition, AMPK could not be activated in mammalian cells that lacked LKB1 expression or in cells that were treated with Hsp90 inhibitors, which decrease LKB1 expression (28Boudeau J. Sapkota G. Alessi D.R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 29Boudeau J. Deak M. Lawlor M.A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Finally, LKB1 turned out to phosphorylate the T-loop of all the 12 human kinases that are phylogenetically related to AMPK (AMPK subfamily) (30Lizcano J.M. Goransso N.O. Toth R. Deak M. Morrice N.A.

However, paradoxically, neither the activity of LKB1 itself nor that of AMPK-related kinases was regulated directly by the stimuli known to activate AMPK, like e.g. AMP, AICAR, or muscle contraction (31Sakamoto K. Goransson O. Hardie D.G. Alessi D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: 310-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 32Sakamoto K. McCarthy A. Smith D. Green K.A. Hardie G.D. Ashworth A. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1810-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Thus, the question remained regarding how AMPK stimuli can lead to LKB1-dependent AMPK activation. We had previously reported that peroxynitrite (ONOO-), a potent oxidant formed by the combination of superoxide anions (O2·¯) and NO at a diffusion-controlled rate, activated AMPK independent of the cellular AMP/ATP ratios (19Zou M.H. Kirkpatrick S.S. Davis B.J. Nelson J.S. Wiles 4th, W.G Schlattner U. Neumann D. Brownlee M. Freeman M.B. Goldman M.H. J. Biol.

We further demonstrated that short periods of hypoxia-reoxygenation (H/R)-activated AMPK in a ONOO --dependent manner, which was also independent of the AMP/ATP ratios, but was sensitive to PI 3-kinase inhibition with either pharmacological inhibitors or overexpression of PDK1 dominant negative mutants (PDK1-DN) (34Zou M.H.

PI 3-kinase-dependent AMPK activation has since been observed by others in insulin-stimulated platelets (35Fleming I. Schulz C. Fichtlscherer B. Kemp B.E. Fisslthaler B. Busse R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 90: 863-871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and adiponectin-stimulated endothelial cells (36Chen H. Montagnani M. Funahashi T. Shimomura I. Quon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45021-45026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, activation of PI 3-kinase with insulin or growth factors that stimulate the PI 3-kinase/PDK1 pathway either did not affect AMPK in most cell types (37Williams M.R. Arthur J.S. Balendran A. van der Kaay J. Poli V. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 439-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) or rather caused AMPK inhibition in some cases (34Zou M.H. Hou X.Y. Shi C.M. Kirkpatick S. Liu F.

Therefore, PI 3-kinase/PDK1 will very likely not serve as a direct upstream kinase for LKB1, and the mechanism for AMPK activation remains to be established. In the present study, we have established a central role of atypical protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ), a protein kinase of the AGC family, as a key regulator in LKB1-dependent AMPK activation. We found that inhibition of PKCζ with pharmacological and genetic inhibitors effectively blocked AMPK activation caused by ONOO-. This AMPK activation pathway was LKB1-dependent, involved LKB1 phosphorylation at Ser428 within the C-terminal part of LKB1, and led to the association of LKB1 with AMPK. The central role of PKCζ in the LKB1-AMPK axis is further supported by the fact that inhibition of PKCζ with either pharmacological (PKCζ-PS) or genetic (PKCζ-dominant negative mutants, PKCζ-DN) inhibitors blunted AMPK activation caused by (ONOO-). Finally, in vitro, recombinant PKCζ phosphorylated both LKB1 at Ser428. We conclude that PKCζ-dependent and LKB1-mediated AMPK activation might play important roles in regulating not only cellular energy metabolism but also signaling pathways that control cell growth, differentiation, and survival.

BAEC were maintained in endothelial basal medium with 2% serum and growth factors before use. HeLa-S3 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% serum. All culture media were added with penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (32Sakamoto K. McCarthy A. Smith D. Green K.A. Hardie G.D. Ashworth A. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1810-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). [32P]ATP was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The SAMS peptide and recombinant LKB1 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Antibodies against phospho-AMPK (Thr172), AMPK-α, phospho-eNOS (Ser1177), phosphor-LKB1 (Ser428, Ser334, and Thr189), LKB1 (for Western blot), PKCζ, phospho-PKCζ (Thr410-403), PKCα/β, and phospho-PKCα/β (Thr638/641) were obtained from Cell Signaling Inc.

Protein A/G-agarose beads, antibodies against PKCζ and LKB1 (used for immunoprecipitation assay, catalogue number Sc-5638, D-19) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). ONOO-, SIN-1, recombinant PKCζ, PKC βII, Go6983, H89, KT5823, calphostin C, wortmanin, LY294002, and arcyriarubin A (2,3-bis(1H-Indol-3-yl)maleimide) were obtained from Calbiochem. Cell-permeable myristoylated both PKC-ζ-PS and PKC-βII-PS were from BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA). Other chemicals and organic solvents of highest grade were obtained from Sigma. Cell Culture and Adenoviral Infection—To generate the adenovial vector expressing a constitutively active mutant of AMPK α1 (AMPK-CA), a rat cDNA encoding residues 1-312 of AMPKα1 and bearing a mutation of Thr172 into aspartic acid (T172D) was subcloned into a shuttle vector (p-shuttle CMV). The c-Myc epitope tag was fused in frame to the 5′-terminus of the coding sequence. The resulting plasmid was linearized by digesting with PmeI and co-transfected into Escherichia coli BJ5183 with the adenoviral backbone plasmid, pAdEasy-1. Homogenous recombinants were selected with kanamycin. The linearized recombinant plasmid was infected into transformed human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Recombinant adenoviruses were amplified on 293 cells and purified by two ultracentrifugation steps on cesium chloride gradients. The number of viral particles was assessed by measurement of the optical density at 260 nm. BAEC were infected with adenovirus expressing a constitutively active PKCζ mutant (PKCζ-CA), a dominant negative mutant PKCζ (PKCζ-DN) (39Tan M. Xu X. Ohba M. Ogawa W. Cui M.Z. J. Biol.

A replication-defective adenoviral vector expressing green fluorescence protein (Ad-GFP) was used as control. BAEC were infected with the adenoviruses with a multiplicity of infection of at least 10 in medium deprived of serum overnight. The cells were then washed and incubated in fresh endothelial base medium without serum for an additional 18-24 h prior to experimentation. Under these conditions, infection efficiency was typically >80% as determined by GFP expression. Hypoxia-Reoxygenation of BAEC—H/R was performed as described previously (34Zou M.H. Hou X.Y. Shi C.M. Kirkpatick S. Liu F. Goldman M.H. Cohen R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34003-34010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Briefly, BAEC were cultured in 6-well plates. The cells were first infected with indicated adenoviruses for 2 days if required. The cells were placed in a water bath (37 °C, total volume of 2 liters) filled with 1 liter of prewarmed Kreb-Ringer's buffer, gassed with 95% O2,5%CO2. After 30 min of incubation, the oxygen tension was reduced abruptly from 95% O2, 5% CO2 to 95% N2, 5% CO2 and was maintained for 15 min as indicated. After this phase of hypoxia, 95% O2,5%CO2 was resumed (reoxygenation) for 15 min. After that the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline buffer twice and collected for Western blot and immunoprecipitation assays. The control BAEC was gassed only with 95% O2, 5% CO2 for equivalent periods. Assay of AMPK Activity—AMPK activity was assayed by using the SAMS peptide, as previously described (19Zou M.H. Kirkpatrick S.S. Davis B.J. Nelson J.S. Wiles 4th, W.G Schlattner U. Neumann D. Brownlee M. Freeman M.B. Goldman M.H. J. Biol.

The difference between the presence and absence of AMP (200 μm) was calculated as the AMPK activity. LKB1 Activity Assay—LKB1 was immunoprecipitated from untreated (control) or treated cells with an antibody against LKB1 (Santa Cruz, catalogue number Sc-5638, D-19) overnight at 4 °C in the presence of protein A/G-agarose. LKB1 activity present in the immunoprecipitates was determined by its ability to activate recombinant AMPK as described previously (20Fryer L.G. Parbu-Patel A. Carling D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25226-25232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). In Vitro Kinase Assays—To determine the effects of PKCζ or PKCβII on AMPK or LKB1 or both, recombinant LKB1 or recombinant AMPK α1β1r1 (41Neumann D. Woods A. Carling D. Wallimann T. Schlattner U. Protein Expr. Purif. 2003; 30: 230-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) were incubated with PKCζ at concentrations indicated for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence of [32P]ATP (1 μCi) with or without AMP (200 μm). The SAMS peptides (final concentration, 200 μm) were added if needed. AMPK activity was calculated by counting the phosphorylated SAMS peptides in the supernatants (25 μl) as described previously (33Davis B. Xie Z. Viollet B. Zou M.H. Diabetes. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar, 34Zou M.H. Hou X.Y. Shi C.M. Kirkpatick S. Liu F. Goldman M.H. Cohen R.A. J. Biol.

The proteins were separated with 12% SDS-PAGE, and the dried gels were subjected to radioautography. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—The proteins were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies and Western blotted into nitrocellulose membranes, and the proteins were detected by specific antibodies, as described previously (33Davis B. Xie Z. Viollet B. Zou M.H. Diabetes. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar, 34Zou M.H. Hou X.Y. Shi C.M. Kirkpatick S. Liu F. Goldman M.H. Cohen R.A. J. Biol.

Preparation of Membrane Fractions—Cellular cytosolic and membrane fractions were prepared as described previously (42Xie Z. Singh M. Singh K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39513-39519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The membranes were then incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies and analyzed in Western blots. Site-directed Mutagenesis of Ser428 and Asp194 of Human LKB1 and Plasmid Transfection—Human cDNA clone was purchased from Invitrogen (clone 3689780). Wild type LKB1 gene coding region was amplified by PCR. The PCR product was ligated into TA cloning vector pGEM-T easy (Promega). LKB1 gene was released with enzymes of EcoRI/NotI from TA cloning vector and was cloned into pCI-neo mammalian expression vector (Promega; catalogue number E184). Ser428 of LKB1 was mutated into either alanine or aspartic acid. Aspartic acid 194 of LKB1, which is essential for maintaining LKB1 activity, was mutated into alanine. All of the site-directed mutagenesis was done by using the QuikChange kits from Stratagene according to the manufacturer's instructions. All of the mutation vectors were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmid DNA was extracted in large scale by using Qiagen EndoFree plasmid maxi kit (catalogue number 12362) and were transfected to HeLa-S3 by using Lipofectamine 2000 kit from Invitrogen (catalogue number 11668-019), according to the instruction provided by the supplier. Twenty four hours after transfection, the cells were treated as indicated. In this experiment, both LacZ expression vector and untreated cells are used as control. Quantification of Western Blot—The intensity (area × density) of the individual bands on Western blots was measured by densitometry (model GS-700, Imaging Densitometer; Bio-Rad). The background was subtracted from the calculated area. Statistical Analysis—The results were analyzed by using two-way analysis of variance. The values are expressed as the means ± S.E. of the mean for n assays. A p value of < 0.05 is considered statistically significant. Inhibition of Protein Kinase C Attenuates ONOO--enhanced AMPK Activity and eNOS Phosphorylation—We had previously shown that ONOO-, either given exogenously or generated endogenously during H/R, activated AMPK in cultured endothelial cells (19Zou M.H. Kirkpatrick S.S. Davis B.J. Nelson J.S. Wiles 4th, W.G Schlattner U. Neumann D. Brownlee M. Freeman M.B. Goldman M.H. J. Biol.

In addition, inhibition of PI 3-kinase with pharmacological inhibitors or overexpression of dominant negative PDK1 abolished AMPK activation caused by either ONOO-or metformin (31Sakamoto K. Goransson O. Hardie D.G. Alessi D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: 310-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 32Sakamoto K. McCarthy A. Smith D. Green K.A. Hardie G.D. Ashworth A. Alessi D.R.

PDK1 serves as an important link between PI 3-kinase and several other kinases in the so-called AGC family, consisting of protein kinase A (PKA), protein kinase G (PKG), and atypical PKC (43Farese R.V. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E1-E11Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To identify which of these kinases leads to AMPK activation, various selective protein kinase inhibitors were preincubated with BAEC before exposure to ONOO-. After treatment, AMPK activation was determined by monitoring both Thr172 phosphorylation of AMPK using a specific antiphospho-antibody and AMPK activity by using [32P]ATP phosphorylation of the SAMS peptide (19Zou M.H. Kirkpatrick S.S. Davis B.J. Nelson J.S. Wiles 4th, W.G Schlattner U. Neumann D. Brownlee M. Freeman M.B. Goldman M.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 34003-34010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). As expected, ONOO- (50 μm) significantly increased AMPK-Thr172 phosphorylation and AMPK activity (Fig. 1, a and b). Interestingly, inhibition of PKC with either GO6983 (1 μm) or arcyriarubin A (1 μm) significantly attenuated ONOO--enhanced AMPK Thr172 phosphorylation and AMPK activity (Fig. 1b). In contrast, inhibition of either PKA with H89 (10 μm) or PKG with KT5823 (10 μm) had no effect (Fig. 1, a and b). These results suggest that ONOO- might activate AMPK via selective PKC activation. eNOS residue Ser1179 (homologous to 1177 in the human sequence) is a substrate for several kinases including both AMPK and protein kinase B/Akt. We had previously reported that ONOO- induced AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of eNOS-Ser1179 in BAEC (33Davis B. Xie Z. Viollet B. Zou M.H. Diabetes. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar, 34Zou M.H.

Thus, we examined the effects of protein kinase inhibitors on eNOS-Ser1179 in BAEC. As expected, ONOO- (50 μm) significantly increased the phosphorylation of eNOS-Ser1179. Neither H89 nor KT5823 altered ONOO--enhanced eNOS-Ser1179 phosphorylation, whereas GO6983 and arcyriarubin A, both of which were shown to inhibit AMPK (Fig. 1, a and b), significantly attenuated ONOO--enhanced eNOS-Ser1179 phosphorylation. These results again suggest that ONOO- might up-regulate AMPK and its downstream enzyme, eNOS, by activating PKC. Activation of Protein Kinase Cζ by ONOO-—Because the employed PKC inhibitors cannot distinguish between these isoforms, we next determined which PKC isoforms are activated by ONOO-. Specific antibodies revealed that BAEC expressed several major isoforms of PKC such as PKCα, β, and atypical PKCζ (data not shown). Atypical PKCζ belongs to the PI 3-kinase/PDK1 family, and its activation is linked to phosphorylation at Thr410/403 that can be monitored by antibodies (43Farese R.V. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: E1-E11Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 44Puceat M. Vassort G. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1996; 157: 65-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Shizukuda Y. Buttrick P.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H320-H327Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Exposure of BAEC to either ONOO- or ONOO- donor SIN-1 significantly increased Thr410/403 phosphorylation without altering PKCζ expression (Fig. 2a). In contrast, ONOO- decreased phosphorylated PKCα/β (Thr638/641), an activated form o"

The paradigm for EGFR down-regulation involves the trafficking of activated receptor molecules from the plasma membrane, through clathrin-coated pits, and into the cell for lysosomal degradation. We have previously shown that oxidative stress generated by H2O2 results in aberrant phosphorylation of the EGFR. This leads to the loss of c-Cbl-mediated ubiquitination of the EGFR and, consequently, prevents its degradation. However, we have found that c-Cbl-mediated ubiquitination is required solely for degradation but not for internalization of the EGFR under oxidative stress. To further examine the fate of the EGFR under oxidative stress, we used confocal analysis to show that the receptor not only remains co-localized with caveolin-1 at the plasma membrane, but at longer time points, is also sorted to a perinuclear compartment via a clathrin-independent, caveolae-mediated pathway. Our findings indicate that although the EGFR associates with caveolin-1 constitutively, caveolin-1 is hyperphosphorylated only under oxidative stress, which is essential in transporting the EGFR to a perinuclear location, where it is not degraded and remains active. Thus, oxidative stress may have a role in tumorigenesis by not only activating the EGFR but also by promoting prolonged activation of the receptor both at the plasma membrane and within the cell.

Therefore, to control cellular growth and tumorigenesis, the activation of the EGFR has to be tightly regulated in a process that includes degradation of the receptor. Binding of EGF to EGFR is rapidly followed by internalization of the membrane-bound receptor mainly through clathrin-coated pits and into early endosomes, which develop into late endosomes. There, the EGFR is either targeted to lysosomes for degradation or recycled to the plasma membrane (1Dikic I. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1178-1181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Waterman H.

The inability of the EGFR to be down-regulated via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and degradation has been linked to its oncogenicity (4Franklin W.A. Veve R. Hirsch F.R. Helfrich B.A. Bunn Jr., P.A. Semin. Oncol. 2002; 29: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 5Eccles S.A. Modjtahedi H. Box G. Court W. Sandle J. Dean C.J. Invasion Metastasis. 1994; 14: 337-348PubMed Google Scholar). H2O2-induced oxidative stress has been shown to activate and aberrantly phosphorylate the EGFR, which impedes the clathrin-mediated endocytosis and subsequent lysosomal degradation of the receptor (6Ravid T.

This results in prolonged downstream activation of proliferative molecules such as Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) (9Ravid T. Heidinger J.M. Gee P. Khan E.M. Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37153-37162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and the lack of receptor turnover has been shown to mediate tumor promotion in non-neoplastic rat liver epithelial cells (10Huang R.P.

To gain more insight into H2O2-induced EGFR signaling and hyperplastic responses, we examined the trafficking of the receptor under oxidative stress. Huang and Sorkin (11Huang F. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1268-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) have recently reported that knock-down of Grb2 by RNA interference inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the EGFR after exposure to EGF, and this was linked to the recruitment of the RING domain of c-Cbl to EGFR. In agreement with these data, we have shown that both Grb2 and c-Cbl association with EGFR are abolished following exposure to H2O2 (6Ravid T. Sweeney C. Gee P. Carraway K.L. II I Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31214-31219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 9Ravid T. Heidinger J.M. Gee P. Khan E.M. Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37153-37162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Earlier confocal analysis of EGFR exposed to H2O2 also showed that the receptor is not internalized into vesicular structures in the cell the way it is under EGF exposure, suggesting that the receptor cannot enter clathrin-coated pits under oxidative stress (6Ravid T. Sweeney C. Gee P. Carraway K.L. II I Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31214-31219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In light of these data, we wanted to determine how EGFR was being sorted under oxidative stress. We began by looking at caveolae, which are specialized flask-shaped subdomains of biochemically defined lipid rafts (12Quest A.F.G. Leyton L. Párraga M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 129-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 13Nabi I.R. Le P.U. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Caveolae are formed when caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 hetero-oligomerize and are integrated into the lipid raft (14Laude A.J. Prior I.A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2004; 21: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 15Galbiati F. Razani B. Lisanti M.P.

A. 1995; 92: 8655-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that caveolin-1 can function in caveolae in a manner analogous to the way clathrin adaptors draw membrane receptors to coated pits and/or drive membrane invagination and budding (12Quest A.F.G. Leyton L. Párraga M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 82: 129-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1 is known to interact directly with many signaling molecules through its caveolin-scaffolding domain at residues 82-101 (17Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar, 18Couet J. Massimo S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30429-30438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Indeed, EGFR has been reported to interact with the caveolin-scaffolding domain through a caveolin-binding sequence motif located in the intracellular kinase domain (residues 898-905) of the receptor (17Okamoto T. Schlegel A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5419-5422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar, 18Couet J. Massimo S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30429-30438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Our previous data showed that Tyr-845 of the EGFR was hyperphosphorylated under oxidative stress, and this was attributed to Src activation (9Ravid T. Heidinger J.M. Gee P. Khan E.M. Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37153-37162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Since Tyr-14 of caveolin-1 has been identified as a target of Src kinase (19Lee H. Volonte D. Galbiati F. Iyengar P. Lublin D.M. Bregman D.B. Wilson M.T. Campos-Gonzalez R. Bouzahzah B. Pestell R.G. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1750-1775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we wanted to examine the role of caveolin-1 in clathrin-independent EGFR trafficking. Our findings suggest that, under oxidative stress, EGFR is able to undergo clathrin-independent endocytosis and is sorted to a perinuclear compartment, where it is not degraded and remains active. The mechanism of this trafficking involves activation of Src by H2O2, which subsequently phosphorylates caveolin-1 Tyr-14 and triggers the caveolar endocytosis of EGFR. Cell Culture and Transfections—A549 human lung carcinoma cells from ATCC (Manassas, VA) were maintained in F-12K (Kaighn's modification) nutrient mixture (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.

Transient transfections using WT (Cav-1) and Y14A mutant caveolin-1 in A549 cells or WT and K721A or Y845F mutant EGFR (a generous gift from Dr. Sarah J. Parsons, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA) in Chinese hamster ovary cells were performed using Lipofectamine transfection reagent (Invitrogen) with the Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells were serum-starved ∼34 h after transfection and treated ∼48 h after transfection. For clathrin heavy chain (CHC) silencing, A549 cells were transiently transfected with the following CHC-specific siRNA: sense, 5′-GCAAUGAGCUGUUUGAAGAUU-3′, and antisense, 5′-PUCUUCAAACAGCUCAUUGCUU-3′ (Dharmacon RNA Technologies, Lafayette, CO) or mock-transfected using the Dharmafect 1 transfection reagent (Dharmacon) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with one modification. The cells were transfected at ∼70% confluence in 10-cm dishes, passaged 24 h later onto coverslips for confocal studies, or into 10-cm dishes for immunoblot and real-time PCR analyses. After 24 h, the cells were transfected again according to the manufacturer's protocol, serum-starved 24 h later, and treated ∼16 h after serum starvation. Real-time PCR—RNA was purified using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and treated with DNase using the RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen). 4 μg of total RNA were used for the reverse-transcriptase reaction performed with the SuperScript first-strand synthesis system for reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen). The cDNA was diluted 1:10, and real-time PCR was carried out using SYBR® Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The primers for the PCR were (based on accession number NM_203506): forward primer, 5′-CTA CTG CAG ACG ACG AGC TG-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-GAA CTT CAC CAC CCA GAG GA-3′. The product size is 221 bp. Primers for β-actin served as a control for normalization of cDNA. The real-time PCR was run in a 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Treatments—To generate H2O2, glucose oxidase (GO; type II from Aspergillus niger, 15,500 units/g; Sigma) was added to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose and 0.5% bovine serum albumin (Sigma). This medium was then preconditioned for 15 min at 37 °C and added to cells for 15 min at 37 °C. For incubation periods greater than 15 min, GO-containing medium was replaced every 15 min with fresh preconditioned medium. For EGF treatments, cells were incubated in the same medium supplemented with 100 ng/ml EGF (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Waltham, MA). For inhibition of Src, cells were preincubated with 5 μm PP1 (Biomol, Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA) for 45 min followed by treatment as indicated in the presence of PP1. Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (20Diamonti A.J. Guy P.M. Ivanof C. Sweeney C. Carraway K.L. II I Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2866-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, A549 cells grown on coverslips (either transiently transfected or not transfected) were treated as indicated and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were permeabilized for 15 min at room temperature with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 0.02% sodium azide, and then the coverslips were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 5% goat serum, and 0.02% sodium azide at room temperature for 1 h. Coverslips were then incubated for 1 h in primary antibody followed by 1 h in secondary antibody. Primary antibodies used were: anti-EGFR clone 528 (generously provided by John Mendelsohn, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY); anti-caveolin-1 N-20 and anti-EGFR phospho-Tyr-1173 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); and anti-Cav-1 phospho-Tyr-14 (BD Transduction Laboratories). The secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and nuclei were stained with 1 μg/ml DAPI or 1 μg/ml propidium iodide (Molecular Probes) for 3 min after removal of secondary antibodies. Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using the ProLong antifade kit (Molecular Probes). Confocal microscopy at ×60 magnification was carried out using an Olympus FV1000 Fluoview confocal laser scanning microscope. All images are merged unless otherwise indicated and are representative of at least 100 cells viewed in each of three separate experiments. Lysate Preparation, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—Lysate preparation and protein immunoprecipitation were performed as described by Bao et al. (21Bao J. Alroy I. Waterman H. Schejter E.D. Brodie C. Gruenberg J. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26178-26186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). After treatments, cells were extracted in solubilization buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EGTA, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and 400 μg of protein in the supernatant were immunoprecipitated by overnight incubation with 4 μg of anti-EGFR clone 225 (a generous gift from ImClone Systems Inc., New York, NY) at 4 °C followed by protein A (Repligen Corp., Needham, MA) precipitation for 1-2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with HNTG buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, containing 0.5% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies followed by a 1-h incubation at room temperature with a 1:10,000 dilution of horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Immunoreactive protein bands were detected with the SuperSignal West Pico substrate (Pierce). Blotting antibodies used were: anti-clathrin heavy chain X22 (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO); anti-EGFR RK2 (generously provided by Dr. J. Schlessinger); anti-phosphotyrosine PY-20, anti-Src, anti-caveolin-1 N-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-caveolin-1 phospho-Tyr-14 (BD Transduction Laboratories); and anti-phospho-Src (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA). EGFR under Oxidative Stress Co-localizes with Caveolin-1 at the Plasma Membrane but Is Internalized over Time into a Perinuclear Region—When the EGFR is activated by EGF, the receptor is rapidly internalized within clathrin-coated pits and undergoes degradation via the lysosomal pathway. This is easily viewed by immunofluorescence staining, in which there is an even distribution of receptor throughout the plasma membrane when the cells are not treated. After treatment with 100 ng/ml EGF for 15 min, EGFR is rapidly redistributed into punctate vesicular compartments within the cell (Fig. 1A). Although H2O2 activates EGFR, as we have previously shown (6Ravid T. Sweeney C. Gee P. Carraway K.L. II I Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31214-31219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the receptor remains at the plasma membrane, where it co-localizes with caveolin-1 (Fig. 1A). Over time, there is some accumulation of the EGFR in a perinuclear location (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, we were able to track the movement of the EGFR from the plasma membrane to the perinuclear region of the cell by prelabeling the receptor with anti-EGFR mAb 528 prior to exposure to 1 unit/ml GO for 45 min or 100 ng/ml EGF for 15 min (Fig. 1C). This indicates that the perinuclear EGFR originates in the plasma membrane and is not the result of receptor recycling or new synthesis. Since the perinuclear EGFR is not degraded, we were also interested in determining whether it was still active. Confocal analysis using a phospho-specific antibody to Tyr-1173 shows that the perinuclear EGFR remains phosphorylated at this trans-autophosphorylation site and is therefore active (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2H2O2-activated EGFR remains active in a perinuclear compartment. Serum-starved A549 cells on coverslips were not treated (NT) or exposed to 100 ng/ml EGF for 45 min on ice or 1 unit/ml GO for 45 min at 37 °C. After fixation, cells were incubated with an antibody against phosphorylated EGFR Tyr-1173 (1:100) followed by staining with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (1:250), and nuclei were stained with DAPI.

Sorkin A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1268-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Grb2 facilitated the recruitment of the RING domain of c-Cbl to the EGFR following EGF treatment. This, in turn, allowed clathrin-mediated endocytosis of the receptor. Using RNA interference to knock down Grb2, they were able to show that Grb2 was essential for clathrin-dependent endocytosis of the EGFR. We have previously shown that mutation of the EGFR at Tyr-1045, the c-Cbl docking site, did not completely abolish EGFR internalization into early endosomes under EGF exposure. This was possibly due to the ability of c-Cbl to bind to the receptor indirectly via Grb2 and was abolished under oxidative stress, when Grb2 was no longer able to bind to the EGFR (9Ravid T. Heidinger J.M. Gee P. Khan E.M. Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37153-37162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This suggested that the perinuclear EGFR under oxidative stress did not traffic there via a clathrin-dependent pathway. To determine whether perinuclear trafficking of the EGFR is clathrin-dependent, A549 cells were either mock-transfected or transfected with CHC siRNA and exposed to 100 ng/ml EGF for 15 min or 1 unit/ml GO for 45 min. Real-time PCR and immunoblot analysis show a near total loss of CHC mRNA and protein, respectively, in the siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Confocal analysis shows that when cells are exposed to EGF, CHC silencing prevents EGFR from leaving the plasma membrane, where it co-localizes with caveolin-1 (Fig. 3C). Perinuclear accumulation of EGFR under oxidative stress, on the other hand, is unaffected by CHC silencing (Fig. 3C). H2O2 Induces Src Family Kinase-dependent Phosphorylation of Caveolin-1—In our previous studies, we found that one of the hallmarks of aberrant EGFR phosphorylation induced by H2O2 was hyperphosphorylation of Tyr-845 (6Ravid T. Sweeney C. Gee P. Carraway K.L. II I Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31214-31219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Since Tyr-845 is a known target for c-Src kinase (24Biscardi J.S. Maa M.C. Tice D.A. Cox M.E. Leu T.H. Parsons S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8335-8343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), we examined the activation of Src under H2O2 exposure and found that Src is indeed activated by H2O2 (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, Tyr-14 of caveolin-1 has also been identified as a target of c-Src (19Lee H. Volonte D. Galbiati F. Iyengar P. Lublin D.M. Bregman D.B. Wilson M.T. Campos-Gonzalez R. Bouzahzah B. Pestell R.G. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1750-1775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether H2O2 induces hyperphosphorylation of caveolin-1 Tyr-14 and whether this is dependent on Src kinases, A549 cells were exposed to H2O2 in the absence and presence of 5 μm PP1, a Src family kinase inhibitor. Immunoblot analysis using a phospho-specific antibody for caveolin-1 Tyr-14 shows that H2O2 induced phosphorylation of this site. This phosphorylation was inhibited by PP1, indicating that caveolin-1 Tyr-14 phosphorylation is dependent on Src kinase(s)(Fig. 4B). Caveolin-1 That Is Associated with EGFR under Oxidative Stress Is Phosphorylated—Having shown that H2O2 induces caveolin-1 Tyr-14 hyperphosphorylation in a Src-dependent manner, the next step was to determine the significance of this event. By immunoprecipitating the EGFR in non-treated, EGF-treated, and GO-treated A549 cells, we examined the ability of EGFR to bind to caveolin-1. We found that EGFR appears to constitutively bind caveolin-1, but only under H2O2 exposure is the bound caveolin-1 phosphorylated (Fig. 5A, upper). Pre-treatment of these cells with 5 μm PP1, followed by exposure to H2O2, resulted in the loss of caveolin-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 5A, lower) and again demonstrated the Src dependence of caveolin-1 phosphorylation. To further test the role of caveolin-1 Tyr-14 phosphorylation in the association between EGFR and caveolin-1, we utilized constructs for both wild-type caveolin-1 (WT Cav-1) and a caveolin-1 Tyr-14 mutant (Y14A). Transient transfection of these constructs into A549 cells followed by no treatment or treatment with 100 ng/ml EGF for 15 min or 1 unit/ml GO for 30 min and immunoprecipitation of EGFR shows that although both WT and Y14A Cav-1 are associated with EGFR, only WT Cav-1 is phosphorylated under H2O2 exposure (Fig. 5B). Additionally, although EGFR Tyr-845 is hyperphosphorylated under oxidative stress, phosphorylation of this site does not appear to have an effect on the receptor's association with caveolin-1 or on perinuclear sorting. A mutant EGFR that connot be phosphorylated at Tyr-845 (Y845F) is still able to associate with caveolin-1 and undergo perinuclear trafficking under oxidative stress (supplemental Fig. S1). Interestingly, although the H2O2-induced perinuclear EGFR is phosphorylated, EGFR kinase activity is not required for the trafficking of the receptor to this region. When Chinese hamster ovary cells were transiently transfected with WT EGFR or the K721A kinase-dead EGFR, there was perinuclear accumulation of the receptor after a 45-min exposure to 1 unit/ml GO (Fig. 6A). A 15-min exposure to 100 ng/ml EGF, however, resulted in the internalization of WT EGFR only. The K721A EGFR, which is not phosphorylated (Fig. 6B) and therefore not able to acquire the necessary protein-protein interactions with c-Cbl and Grb2 required for clathrin-mediated internalization, remained membrane-bound (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation of the WT and K721A EGFR shows that caveolin-1 is constitutively associated with both of the receptors and is phosphorylated only under oxidative stress (Fig. 6B). The Role of Caveolin-1 in EGFR Trafficking under Oxidative Stress— Since caveolin-1 is phosphorylated under oxidative stress, we next wanted to determine whether association with phosphorylated caveolin-1 plays a role in the clathrin-independent sorting of EGFR under oxidative stress. First, A549 cells were pretreated with 5 μm PP1 for 45 min followed by treatment with 1 unit/ml GO for 45 min or 100 ng/ml EGF for 15 min. Confocal analysis shows that EGFR accumulates next to the nucleus only when cells are exposed to GO alone, and this is prevented by the inhibition of Src kinase(s) by PP1 (Fig. 7A). Cells under EGF treatment show internalization of EGFR into punctate vesicular compartments in the absence and presence of PP1 (Fig. 7A). To verify that perinuclear accumulation of EGFR is specifically dependent on phosphorylation of caveolin-1 at Tyr-14, A549 cells were transiently transfected with either the WT or Y14A Cav-1 constructs, serum-starved 32 h after transfection, and exposed for 45 min to 1 unit/ml GO or for 15 min to 100 ng/ml EGF 48 h after transfection. Confocal analysis of the WT Cav-1-transfected cells shows that EGFR under oxidative stress co-localizes with Cav-1 in a perinuclear compartment, whereas in Y14A-transfected cells, the EGFR does not exhibit perinuclear co-localization with caveolin-1 under oxidative stress (Fig. 7B). Futhermore, confocal analysis using an antibody against phospho-Tyr-14 of caveolin-1 indicates that the perinuclear EGFR co-localizes with the phosphorylated form of caveolin-1 under oxidative stress (supplemental Fig. S2). This demonstrates that phosphorylation of caveolin-1 at Tyr-14 is necessary for the movement of the EGFR/caveolin-1 complex to a perinuclear compartment. Oxidative stress in the form of H2O2 has been shown to affect EGFR phosphorylation and trafficking (6Ravid T. Sweeney C. Gee P. Carraway K.L. II I Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31214-31219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 9Ravid T. Heidinger J.M. Gee P. Khan E.M. Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37153-37162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have demonstrated that aberrant phosphorylation of EGFR under oxidative stress results in the loss of c-Cbl-mediated ubiquitination of the receptor, which is necessary for movement out of the early endosomes and progression into lysosomes for degradation (6Ravid T. Sweeney C. Gee P. Carraway K.L. II I Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31214-31219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 9Ravid T. Heidinger J.M. Gee P. Khan E.M. Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37153-37162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The present study focuses on our additional observations regarding the fate of the aberrantly phosphorylated EGFR, which fails to be degraded. We found that under oxidative stress, EGFR does not reach the early endosomes (9Ravid T. Heidinger J.M. Gee P. Khan E.M. Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37153-37162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) but rather traffics to a perinuclear compartment in a non-clathrin-mediated manner. Therefore, herein we concentrate on the mechanism of clathrin-independent trafficking of H2O2-activated EGFR into a perinuclear compartment, allowing for prolonged signaling not only at the plasma membrane but also within the cell. Huang and Sorkin (11Huang F. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1268-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) recently showed that Grb2 is essential for recruiting the RING domain of c-Cbl to the EGFR to allow clathrin-dependent receptor endocytosis. Consistent with these findings, we have shown that under oxidative stress, both c-Cbl and Grb2 cannot bind EGFR, and therefore, the receptor cannot enter into clathrin-coated pits (9Ravid T. Heidinger J.M. Gee P. Khan E.M. Goldkorn T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37153-37162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, EGFR can still be seen by immunofluorescence to accumulate inside the cell at a perinuclear location after H2O2 exposure (Fig. 1B), and silencing of clathrin demonstrates that this mode of trafficking is clathrin-independent (Fig. 3). Several groups have reported that the EGFR is found in caveolae, which have been proposed to sequester inactive signaling molecules and to mediate cross-talk between different signaling cascades (18Couet J. Massimo S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30429-30438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 23Carver L.A. Schnitzer J.E. Nat. Rev.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Recent publications have indicated that clathrin-independent endocytosis is mediated by caveolae in a Src-dependent manner (13Nabi I.R. Le P.U. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 26Nichols B. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 116: 4707-4714Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 27Shajahan A.N. Tiruppathi C. Smrcka A.V.

Marks D.L. Simari R. Parton R.G. Pagano R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3114-3122Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Furthermore, H2O2 has been shown to inhibit phosphatase activity (29Lee S.R. Kwon K.S. Kim S.R. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15366-15372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar), and phosphatase inhibition by okadaic acid causes significant mobilization of static caveolae, presumably into an endocytic pathway (26Nichols B. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 116: 4707-4714Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 30Parton R.G. Joggerst B. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1199-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). This, again, was shown to be inhibited by genistein, a Src family kinase inhibitor (26Nichols B. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 116: 4707-4714Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1, a structural protein necessary for caveolae formation, has been shown to interact directly with EGFR (18Couet J. Massimo S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30429-30438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanism by which EGFR is being trafficked to the perinuclear compartment under oxidative stress, we investigated the involvement of caveolin-1 in this process. Tyr-14 of caveolin-1 is the target for c-Src kinase phosphorylation (19Lee H. Volonte D. Galbiati F. Iyengar P. Lublin D.M. Bregman D.B. Wilson M.T. Campos-Gonzalez R. Bouzahzah B. Pestell R.G. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1750-1775Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we have shown that H2O2 causes a significant activation of Src (Fig. 4A), which also appears to phosphorylate caveolin-1 at Tyr-14 in our model system. By expressing a Tyr-14 mutant (Y14A) caveolin-1 protein in our cell culture model, we were able to show that EGFR constitutively associates with caveolin-1, which is phosphorylated only in the presence of H2O2 (Fig. 5) and no longer accumulates in the perinuclear compartment either when Src is inhibited or when the Y14A caveolin-1 mutant is expressed (Fig. 6). Although there have been reports that other Src family kinases are involved in oxidative stress-induced phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (31Cao H. Sanguinetti A.R. Mastick C.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 294: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 32Sanguinetti A.R. Cao H. Mastick C.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), our observation that EGFR Tyr-845, a c-Src target (24Biscardi J.S. Maa M.C. Tice D.A. Cox M.E. Leu T.H. Parsons S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8335-8343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), is hyperphosphorylated under oxidative stress suggests that c-Src is the main kinase involved here. Additionally, Sanguinetti et al. (33Sanguinetti A.R. Mastick C.C. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) have reported that c-Abl expression is required for oxidative stress-induced phosphorylation of caveolin-1, although its role in the perinuclear sorting of EGFR remains to be determined. Since caveolae-mediated endocytosis has been reported by others to be Src-dependent, the data in this study are consistent with the notion that H2O2 induces caveolae-mediated endocytosis of EGFR and that Src-dependent caveolin-1 Tyr-14 phosphorylation plays an essential role in this process. Furthermore, we show that the H2O2-activated perinuclear EGFR remains phosphorylated at Tyr-1173, which suggests that the receptor is active (Fig. 2). This may have significant ramifications in tumorigenesis since Wang et al. (34Wang Y. Pennock S. Chen X. Wang Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7279-7290Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) have reported that EGFR signaling in the endosome is sufficient to activate the major signaling cascades involved in cell proliferation and to suppress apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal. Interestingly, Sigismund et al. (35Sigismund S. Woelk T. Puri C. Maspero E. Tacchetti C. Transidico P. Di Fiore P.P. Polo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2760-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) and Orlichenko et al. (36Orlichenko L. Huang B. Krueger E. McNiven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 281: 4570-4579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) have shown that EGF-activated EGFR can stimulate caveolar internalization and the formation of caveolae, respectively. On the other hand, our data suggest that EGF stimulation in our system does not result in caveolae-mediated trafficking of the EGFR. In fact, we show that EGFR kinase activity is not required for perinuclear trafficking of the receptor. However, the point of our data that is consistent with the data of Orlichenko et al. (36Orlichenko L. Huang B. Krueger E. McNiven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 281: 4570-4579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) is that caveolae formation appears to require phosphorylation of caveolin-1 at Tyr-14, which in our study occured only in the presence of H2O2. Moreover, Mineo et al. (37Mineo C. Gill G.N. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30636-30643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) have proposed that entire signaling pathways may be pre-organized in caveolae, where early steps of signal transduction take place. A rapid decrease in signaling also coincides with loss of receptors from caveolae and, depending on cell type, this process can take 3-30 min (25Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 39Liu P. Ying Y Ko Y.-G. Anderson R. G.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 30636-30643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) have proposed that following EGF treatment, the EGFR can be found in at least three different membrane compartments, namely caveolae, bulk plasma membrane, and clathrin-coated pits. We show association of EGFR and caveolin-1 by immunoprecipitation even in the presence of EGF, yet our confocal data show EGF-induced internalization of the receptor into vesicular structures that do not co-localize with caveolin-1. The mechanism of caveolar endocytosis is not yet clearly defined. Our study demonstrates that Src-mediated phosphorylation of caveolin-1 Tyr-14 is necessary for caveolar endocytosis of EGFR under oxidative stress, although the exact role of caveolin-1 remains to be determined. Pelkmans et al. (40Pelkmans L. Bürli T. Zerial M. Helenius A. Cell. 2004; 118: 767-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) suggest that the manner in which caveolar cargo is taken up and released depends on how the cargo interacts with caveolin-1 as well as with other caveolar proteins and on how the cargo is influenced by compartment-specific signals such a pH changes. Our model thus far indicates that H2O2 activation of EGFR results in aberrant receptor phosphorylation that precludes it from being sorted through clathrin-coated pits for eventual lysosomal degradation (6Ravid T.

Concomitantly, H2O2 (but not EGF) activates Src, which in turn hyperphosphorylates caveolin-1 (a proposed trigger for caveolar endocytosis) and dynamin-2 (supplemental Fig. S3), which is thought to localize at the neck of caveolae such that activation of its GTPase activity leads to vesicle fission (27Shajahan A.N.

Through this route of caveolar endocytosis, H2O2-activated EGFR is trafficked to a perinuclear region, where continued receptor signaling is undesired because it could potentially contribute to prolonged proliferative signaling (9Ravid T.

Two components of the thylakoid system, cpTatC and Hcf106, compose a precursor-bound receptor complex. The third component, Tha4, assembles with the precursor-bound receptor complex for the translocation step and is thought to compose at least part of the protein-conducting channel. Here, we used two different cross-linking approaches to explore the organization of Tha4 in the translocase. These cross-linking techniques showed that transition to an active protein transport state resulted in an alignment of the Tha4 amphipathic helix and C-terminal tail domains to form Tha4 oligomers. Oligomerization required functional Tha4, a twin arginine signal peptide, and an active cpTatC-Hcf106 receptor complex. The spectrum of oligomers obtained was independent of the mature folded domain of the precursor. We propose a trapdoor mechanism for translocation whereby aligned oligomers of Tha4 amphipathic helices fold into the membrane to allow formfitting passage of precursor proteins.

Plant thylakoid membranes possess two systems to transport proteins to the lumen (1Cline K. Advances in Photosynthesis and Respiration: Light-Harvesting Antennas in Photosynthesis.in: Green B. Parson W. 13. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2003: 353-372Google Scholar). The thylakoid Sec pathway is homologous to the bacterial Sec pathway and uses ATP and chloroplast SecA to thread unfolded precursor proteins through a SecY/E channel (2Yuan J. Henry R. McCaffery M.

Physiol. 2003; 47: 187-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar for review). Targeting to either pathway is mediated by cleavable hydrophobic signal peptides. However, Tat pathway signal peptides also contain an essential twin arginine motif immediately before the hydrophobic helix (9Henry R. Carrigan M. McCaffrey M. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Three membrane proteins appear to be the only components required for thylakoid Tat transport (5Mori H. Cline K. Biochim.

Hcf106 and Tha4 are homologous proteins with similar structures. Each is anchored by an N-terminal transmembrane domain, which is followed by a flexible hinge, an amphipathic α-helix, and a divergent C-terminal tail (5Mori H. Cline K. Biochim. Biophys.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 501: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The Tat system, originally described in chloroplasts (12Cline K. Ettinger W.F. Theg S.M. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 2002; 177: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This suggests that the Tat system is of ancient design and likely employs basic, possibly simple mechanisms. The bacterial and archaeal orthologs of Hcf106, Tha4, and cpTatC are called TatB, TatA, and TatC, respectively (5Mori H. Cline K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1541: 80-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 6Muller M. Klosgen R.B. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Transport by the thylakoid Tat pathway operates by a cyclical assembly and transport mechanism (17Mori H. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 18Cline K. Mori H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Precursor proteins bind to a large cpTatC-Hcf106 receptor complex via their signal peptides (18Cline K. Mori H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). 3Gerard, F., and Cline, K., (December 30, 2005) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc.M512733200. In the presence of the protonmotive force, which consists primarily of the ΔpH in isolated thylakoids (19Theg S.M. Cline K. Finazzi G. Wollman F.A. Trends Plant Sci. 2005; 10: 153-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), Tha4 then assembles with the precursor-bound receptor complex to form the presumptive translocase (17Mori H. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). After protein translocation, Tha4 disassembles from the receptor complex, thereby resetting the path for additional transport events. The tight correlation between Tha4 assembly and protein translocation implies that Tha4 plays a specific critical role in the translocation step. Several models for the Tat translocase propose that Tha4 (TatA) serves as the protein-conducting channel. Specifically, multiples of Tha4 (TatA) transmembrane domains and/or amphipathic helices are envisioned to form a ring around the mature folded domain of the precursor protein (5Mori H. Cline K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1541: 80-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 7Berks B.C. Palmer T. Sargent F. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 14Palmer T. Berks B.C. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 547-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 20Berks B.C. Sargent F.

Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10482-10486Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Such a formfitting channel could explain the ability of Tat systems to transport folded proteins from ∼2 kDa to well over 100 kDa without permitting uncontrolled ion flow (22Teter S.A. Theg S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1590-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Alder N.N. Theg S.M. Cell. 2003; 112: 231-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The large molar excess of Tha4 (TatA) proteins over cpTatC (TatC) proteins (11Mori H. Summer E.J. Cline K.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 3361-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and the appearance of a purified TatA complex as a large ring-forming structure (21Gohlke U. Pullan L. McDevitt C.A. Porcelli I. de Leeuw E. Palmer T. Saibil H.R. Berks B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10482-10486Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) are consistent with such a model. However, it is not currently known what form Tha4 (TatA) adopts in an active translocase. If Tha4 functions as the envisioned channel, then, in the translocase, it should be present in multiples in which the transmembrane domains and/or amphipathic helices align with each other to encompass the substrate. Cross-linking studies verified the association of Tha4 with the cpTatC-Hcf106-precursor complex during transport, but provided no information on the number of Tha4 proteins or the organization of Tha4 in this complex (17Mori H. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Here, two cross-linking approaches were used to examine Tha4 interactions and organization during the protein translocation step. Cysteine scanning/oxidative disulfide cross-linking showed that interactions between Tha4 proteins occur across all domains of the Tha4 protein. Notably, the stroma-facing amphipathic helix and C-terminal tail appear to interact only during protein transport. The use of homobifunctional lysine-reactive cross-linkers showed that Tha4-Tha4 interactions during protein transport result in the formation of multimers or oligomers. Two observations indicate that the Tha4 oligomers are present in the translocase. First, Tha4 mutants inactive for translocase assembly did not form oligomers. Second, Tha4 oligomerization was prevented by pretreating thylakoids with transport-inhibiting anti-cpTatC IgG antibodies, arguing that Tha4 must dock with the precursor-bound receptor complex to oligomerize. Surprisingly, oligomer size appeared to be independent of the size of the precursor. These results suggest that Tha4 docking to the precursor-bound receptor complex either concentrates or reorganizes Tha4 oligomers at the site of translocation. Implications of this finding for the mechanism of translocation are discussed. Preparation of Chloroplasts and Thylakoids—Intact chloroplasts were prepared from 9–10-day-old pea seedlings (Pisum sativum L. cv. Laxton’s Progress 9) (25Cline K. Henry R. Li C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Chloroplasts were resuspended to 1 mg/ml chlorophyll in import buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0) and 330 mm sorbitol) and kept on ice until used. Chloroplast lysates and isolated thylakoids were obtained as described (25Cline K. Henry R. Li C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) by osmotic lysis of intact chloroplasts. Thylakoids were resuspended in import buffer and 10 mm MgCl2 before use. Treatment of thylakoids with antibodies to Tha4, cpTatC, Hcf106, and Alb3 was conducted as described (18Cline K. Mori H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 26Dabney-Smith C. Mori H. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43027-43033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Generation of Cysteine-substituted Mature Tha4—Tha4 proteins with cysteine substitutions (Tha4(XnC)) were generated by QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The template used for mutagenesis was the coding sequence for mature Tha4 (lacking the targeting peptide) from pea as described (10Fincher V. Dabney-Smith C. Cline K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4930-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar); the coding sequence begins with MAFFGLGVPE... The Tha4MAC clone was prepared by PCR mutagenesis from the cDNA clone for pre-Tha4 as the template. The 5′-primer was designed to change the coding sequence such that the resulting protein started with MACNAFFGLGVPE... Cloned constructs were verified by DNA sequencing on both strands at the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research DNA Sequencing Core Facility. Preparation of Radiolabeled Mature Tha4 and Precursors—Radiolabeled mature Tha4, Tha4 mutants, and precursor proteins were prepared by in vitro translation in a wheat germ extract from capped mRNA in the presence of [3H]leucine (9Henry R. Carrigan M. McCaffrey M. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Tha4 translation products were diluted with an equal volume of 60 mm leucine in 2× import buffer before use. Unlabeled DT23 and KK-DT23 (the nonfunctional variant of DT23) were overexpressed in Escherichia coli as described previously (9Henry R. Carrigan M. McCaffrey M. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 17Mori H. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). tpOE17, a synthetic peptide representing the signal peptide of the OE17 precursor, was the generous gift of Dr. Steven Theg (University of California-Davis). Purified DT23 and KK-DT23 inclusion bodies and tpOE17 were freshly dissolved in 8 m urea and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) to 120 μm at 37 °C for 1 h before use. In Vitro Assay for Functional Tha4 Complementation by Recombinant Tha4 Proteins—Cys-substituted Tha4 proteins were assayed for functionality with an in vitro complementation assay to restore transport of the precursor DT23 as described previously (26Dabney-Smith C. Mori H. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43027-43033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated thylakoids were treated with anti-Tha4 IgG antibodies to inactivate endogenous Tha4, and the bound antibodies were capped with protein A. In vitro translated recombinant Tha4 was then integrated into the resulting thylakoids. Tha4-integrated thylakoids were assayed for transport of in vitro translated DT23. Complementation transport assays were conducted for 15 min at 15 °C in white light (∼100 microeinsteins/m2/s) and stopped by transfer to ice and centrifugation to recover thylakoids. Thylakoids were resuspended in 300 μl of 1× import buffer and divided into two aliquots. Thylakoids in one aliquot were analyzed directly, whereas thylakoids in the second aliquot were treated with thermolysin before analysis by SDS-PAGE/fluorography. Quantification of radiolabeled proteins was done by scintillation counting of radiolabeled proteins extracted from gel bands (27Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14804-14810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Untreated samples were used to calculate the amount of recombinant Tha4 in the membrane, whereas thermolysin-treated samples were used to calculate the amount of DT23 transported. The amount of DT23 transported was corrected for background transport that occurred in the negative control for the each experiment. The negative transport control was a transport reaction conducted with anti-Tha4 antibody-treated thylakoids in the presence of 8 μm Tha4 stromal domain antigen to control for possible release of antibodies. Transport in the negative control was generally <4% of the transport that occurred in the wild-type Tha4 complementation assay. Complementation efficiency was calculated as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Cross-linking—In vitro translated [3H]Tha4(XnC) was integrated into isolated thylakoids or anti-Tha4 antibody-treated thylakoids for 20 min at 15 °C. Recovered thylakoids (50 μg of chlorophyll in 175 μl of import buffer and 10 mm MgCl2) were incubated under transport conditions (5 mm MgATP, 0.5 mm DTT, and 50 μm methyl viologen; white light at ∼100 μE/m2/s) or non-transport conditions (absence of energy, darkness) at 15 °C for 2 min before saturating levels of DT23 precursor (1.5 μm; dispensed from a 120 μm stock in 8 m urea and 1 mm DTT) or an equivalent volume of 8 m urea (no-precursor control) was added to initiate transport. After an additional 2 min, 0.25 mm copper(II)-1,10-phenanthroline (CuP; from a 15 mm stock) or 1 mm CuP (from a 150 mm stock) was added to catalyze disulfide formation between proximal cysteine residues. The CuP stock solution (150 mm) contained 150 mm CuSO4 and 500 mm 1,10-phenanthroline (28Careaga C.L. Falke J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1219-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). After cross-linking for 2 min (or for the times indicated in the figures), oxidation was quenched with 50 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM; from a 1 m stock in Me2SO) and 0.5 ml of 14 mm EDTA in import buffer. Thylakoids recovered by centrifugation were washed with 1× import buffer, 5 mm EDTA, and 10 mm NEM. Thylakoid pellets were resuspended in 125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 8 m urea, 5 mm EDTA, 5% SDS, and 15% glycerol and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography under nonreducing conditions. For homobifunctional cross-linking with the cross-linker disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) or dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP), [3H]Tha4 was integrated into washed thylakoids or antibody-treated thylakoids as specified in the figure legends and described previously (10Fincher V. Dabney-Smith C. Cline K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 4930-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thylakoids were recovered by centrifugation, washed and then resuspended in 100-μl aliquots containing 33 μgof chlorophyll in 1× import buffer and 3.3 mm MgCl2. For cross-linking under transport conditions, aliquots received 5 mm MgATP, 50 μm methyl viologen, and 1.5 μm unlabeled DT23 precursor. For cross-linking in the absence of energy or precursor, aliquots received an equivalent amount of 8 m urea and 1 mm DTT without ATP and methyl viologen. Aliquots were incubated at 25 °C in white light at ∼70 μE/m2/s or darkness for 5 min and then received Me2SO or varying amounts of the cross-linker DSS or DSP (dispensed from a 5 or 25 mm stock in Me2SO). After 5 min, cross-linking reactions were quenched with 90 μm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) for 5 min at 25 °C, followed by 15 min at 0 °C. Each reaction was then diluted with 0.8 ml of 1× import buffer and 3.3 mm MgCl2, and thylakoids were recovered by centrifugation. Thylakoids were dissolved in SDS sample buffer with or without β mercaptoethanol (DSS or DSP cross-linker, respectively) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/fluorography. Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—Antibodies against Tha4, cpTatC, Hcf106, or OE23 have been described (11Mori H. Summer E.J. Cline K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 501: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 29Mori H. Summer E.J. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Immunodetection was performed following standard methods using the ECL reagents and protocol (Amersham Biosciences) for detection. For immunoprecipitation, samples were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 1% SDS; heated to 37 °C for 5 min; and centrifuged to remove insoluble material. Immunoprecipitation under denaturing conditions was performed as described previously with anti-IgG antibodies covalently cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose (17Mori H. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Introduction of Single Cysteine Residues throughout Tha4 Does Not Impair Tha4 Function in VitroCysteine scanning and oxidative disulfide formation were undertaken to characterize Tha4-Tha4 interactions mediated by different domains of the protein. A library of single Cys-substituted Tha4 (Tha4(XnC)) was prepared and tested for functionality in an in vitro Tha4 replacement assay (26Dabney-Smith C. Mori H. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43027-43033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this assay, endogenous Tha4 is inactivated with anti-Tha4 IgG antibodies, and in vitro translated recombinant Tha4 is introduced into the membrane by in vitro integration. Transmembrane and hinge domain residues were systematically substituted with cysteine, whereas representative residues in the amphipathic helix and C-terminal tail were selected for substitution (Fig. 1A). Nearly all Cys-substituted Tha4 proteins retained some transport function, although the range of functionality varied from 25 to 200% of wild-type Tha4 (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1). Only Tha4(E10C) was completely nonfunctional (Fig. 1B). This confirms the previously reported Glu10 requirement for Tha4 function (26Dabney-Smith C. Mori H. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43027-43033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Conditions for Tha4-Tha4 Disulfide Cross-linking Analysis—Tha4-Tha4 interactions were mapped by integrating radiolabeled Cys-substituted Tha4 into thylakoids and catalyzing disulfide formation between proximal cysteine residues with CuP. Because single Cys substitutions were made, Tha4-Tha4 disulfide formation was scored by the presence of a Tha4 dimer band on SDS-PAGE fluorograms. Preliminary experiments calibrated cross-linking conditions to reliably report on interactions that occur during protein transport. The experiment in Fig. 2 shows the results from analysis of Tha4 proteins with Cys substitutions at transmembrane domain residues Pro9 and Val12 and stromal domain residue Thr59, as these are representative of the behavior of Cys substitutions in those regions (Table 1).TABLE 1Summary of cross-linking of Cys-substituted Tha4ResidueDimerizationaCross-linking experiments were conducted at low and high CuP concentrations as described under 'Experimental Procedures.'

Two different concentrations of CuP were examined. Tha4(V12C) was not cross-linked by either CuP concentration (middle panel). Tha4(P9C)-Tha4(P9C) was cross-linked under both resting state and active transport conditions with the relatively high 1 mm CuP concentration (upper panel). Tha4(P9C) cross-linking occurred almost as quickly as the quenching agent NEM could be added (lanes 4–8). Control experiments showed that NEM quenched the reaction within 10 s of its addition (data not shown). When 0.25 mm CuP was used, the Tha4(P9C)-Tha4(P9C) dimer was produced at a slower rate and only under transport conditions (upper panel, lanes 9–13). Tha4(T59C) was specifically cross-linked only under active transport conditions with either the low or high CuP concentration and exhibited similar kinetics compared with Tha4(P9C) (lower panel, lanes 4–13). Tha4 Interacts through Its Stromal Domain under Conditions of Active Protein Transport—Table 1 summarizes the results of oxidative disulfide cross-linking at single sites across the Tha4 molecule with high and low CuP concentrations and in the presence or absence of active protein transport. The greatest variation in Tha4-Tha4 interaction was observed for transmembrane domain residues: some residues did not cross-link under any conditions; some cross-linked under both resting and transport conditions; and some cross-linked only under transport conditions. In addition, cross-linking was dependent on the concentration of CuP used to catalyze disulfide formation. A number of Tha4 proteins with Cys substitutions at transmembrane domain residues cross-linked under both conditions with the high CuP concentration (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S2). By contrast, Tha4 with substitutions in the amphipathic helix and C-terminal tail cross-linked only under transport conditions regardless of the CuP concentration, with the exception of Tha4(Q68C), which was cross-linked under both conditions with 1 mm CuP. The requirements for Tha4-Tha4 interaction were more precisely determined for representative residues in the different domains using 0.25 mm CuP (Fig. 3). For this experiment, thylakoid membranes were pretreated with anti-Tha4 IgG antibodies to inactivate endogenous Tha4 prior to integration of in vitro translated Cys-substituted recombinant Tha4. Reaction conditions included the presence or absence of the ΔpH and the presence of a functional (twin arginine) or nonfunctional (twin lysine (KK)) precursor. Tha4 with substitutions in the N terminus and the transmembrane domain (Tha4MAC, Tha4(F3C), and Tha4(G5C)) cross-linked to some extent even under resting state conditions (Fig. 3, upper panels, lanes 1–3). This basal level of interaction was enhanced in the presence of the ΔpH and further increased by the functional precursor (lanes 4–6). Cross-linking of Tha4 with a substitution in the hinge region (Tha4(K25C)) was enhanced by the ΔpH and further increased by the presence of precursor (lower left panel, lanes 1–6). Tha4-Tha4 interactions mediated through the amphipathic helix (Tha4(K39C) and Tha4(Q43C)) and C-terminal tail (Tha4(T59C)) were specifically induced only when both the ΔpH and precursor were present (lower panels, lanes 4–6). In all cases, the nonfunctional twin lysine-containing precursor (KK-DT23) did not stimulate Tha4-Tha4 interaction over the amount resulting solely from the ΔpH (lanes 4 and 5). These results indicate that Tha4-Tha4 interactions occur throughout the entire protein molecule. The transmembrane domain showed some interaction under most conditions, but interacted more strongly in the presence of the pH gradient and a functional precursor. The Tha4 stromal domain, i.e. the amphipathic helix and C-tail, interacted almost entirely in response to conditions leading to protein transport (ΔpH and precursor). Tha4 Forms Higher Oligomers during the Transport Reaction—The site-specific cross-linking through single residues used above can assess interactions, but cannot reveal the presence of oligomers. However, because 9 lysine residues are present in the Tha4 stroma-facing domains, the lysine-reactive homobifunctional cross-linkers DSS and DSP were used to stabilize any oligomers present during protein transport. A preliminary experiment in which endogenous Tha4 was cross-linked with DSS showed ΔpH- and precursor-dependent formation of Tha4 dimer- and higher order Tha4-containing products, but was limited by a high background staining (supplemental Fig. S3). The use of radiolabeled Tha4 integrated into thylakoids and analysis by SDS-PAGE and fluorography (Fig. 4) produced much cleaner banding profile compared with immunoblotting (compare Fig. 4A with supplemental Fig. S3). DSS cross-linking of thylakoids incubated in the presence of the ΔpH (light) and the precursor DT23 stabilized a ladder of larger species with average molecular mass on several gel systems of 28, 41, 52, and 64 kDa (Fig. 4A, lanes 4–8). The ladder step size of 12 kDa corresponds roughly to the 14 kDa of the Tha4 monomer, suggesting that these products correspond to the Tha4 dimer, trimer, tetramer, and pentamer, respectively. The oligomer bands were largely absent in DSS-cross-linked thylakoids incubated in the absence of the ΔpH (darkness) and precursor (lanes 1 and 2). A band in dark-incubated thylakoids at ∼37 kDa (lanes 1 and 2) migrated somewhat faster than the putative trimer of thylakoids actively transporting protein and is likely a nonspecific cross-linking product. Essentially the same results were also obtain"
https://openalex.org/W2047469624,"Hyaluronan (HA) is an extracellular matrix glycosaminoglycan that interacts with cell-surface receptors, including CD44. Although HA usually exists as a high molecular mass polymer, HA of a much lower molecular mass that shows a variety of biological activities can be detected under certain pathological conditions, particularly in tumors. We previously reported that low molecular weight HAs (LMW-HAs) of a certain size range induce the proteolytic cleavage of CD44 from the surface of tumor cells and promote tumor cell migration in a CD44-dependent manner. Here, we show that MIA PaCa-2, a human pancreatic carcinoma cell line, secreted hyaluronidases abundantly and generated readily detectable levels of LMW-HAs ranging from ∼10- to 40-mers. This occurred in the absence of any exogenous stimulation. The tumor-derived HA oligosaccharides were able to enhance CD44 cleavage and tumor cell motility. Inhibition of the CD44-HA interaction resulted in the complete abrogation of these cellular events. These results are consistent with the concept that tumor cells generate HA oligosaccha-rides that bind to tumor cell CD44 through the expression of their own constitutive hyaluronidases. This enhances their own CD44 cleavage and cell motility, which would subsequently promote tumor progression. Such an autocrine/paracrine-like process may represent a novel activation mechanism that would facilitate and promote the malignant potential of tumor cells.

Despite its simple composition, HA possesses a number of functions. It influences the hydration and physical properties of tissues (1Laurent T.C. Fraser J.R.

Cell. 1990; 61: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar). Through these functions, HA forms a pericellular coat around cells (2Toole B.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar, 7Toole B.P. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 37R-42RCrossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and participates in physiological events such as cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation (8Toole B.P. J. Intern. Med. 1997; 242: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). It is also involved in pathological conditions, including cancer (7Toole B.P. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 37R-42RCrossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). An increased synthesis of HA has been reported in various malignant tumors such as breast and ovarian carcinomas, and predicts a poor prognosis (9Ropponen K. Tammi M. Parkkinen J. Eskelinen M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 4589-4592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Hyaluronidases play critical roles in HA metabolism (15Stern R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Six human hyaluronidase-like sequences are present in the human genome. These are HYAL1, HYAL2, HYAL3, HYAL4, SPAM1, and PHYAL1, which, respectively, encode Hyal-1, Hyal-2, Hyal-3, Hyal-4, PH-20, and a pseudogene that is transcribed but not translated (16Csoka A.B. Frost G.I. Stern R. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Of these hyaluronidases, only Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 have been characterized well. Hyal-1 is an acid-active lysosomal enzyme that can utilize HA of any size as a substrate, generating predominantly tetrasaccharides (15Stern R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Hyal-2 is an acid-active enzyme anchored to the plasma membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol link, and can digest high molecular mass HA to a limit product of ∼20 kDa, or about 50 disaccharide units (15Stern R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 83: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). These two hyaluronidases appear to co-operate in HA degradation and both have been implicated in tumor invasion and metastasis. Hyal-1 is highly expressed in an active form in the tissue and urine specimens of patients with bladder (17Pham H.T. Block N.L. Lokeshwar V.B. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 778-783PubMed Google Scholar) or prostate (18Lokeshwar V.B. Rubinowicz D. Schroeder G.L. Forgacs E. Minna J.D. Block N.L. Nadji M. Lokeshwar B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11922-11932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) cancers. It is associated with the appearance of detectable levels of low molecular weight HAs (LMWHAs) (17Pham H.T. Block N.L. Lokeshwar V.B. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 778-783PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lokeshwar V.B. Öbek C. Soloway M.S. Block N.L. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 773-777PubMed Google Scholar); whereas Hyal-2 is expressed in mammary tumors (20Bertrand P. Girard N. Duval C. d'Anjou J. Chauzy C. Menard J.F. Delpech B. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 73: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence indicates that LMW-HAs have distinct functions from high molecular weight-HAs, and that HA molecules of different sizes have different functions (21Sugahara K.N. Hirata T. Murai T. Miyasaka M. Trends Glycosci. Glycotech. 2004; 16: 187-197Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). For instance, HA 4-16-mers induce cytokine gene expression in dendritic cells (22Termeer C.C. Hennies J. Voith U. Ahrens T. Weiss J.M. Prehm P. Simon J.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1863-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and promote their maturation (23Termeer C. Benedix F.

Med. 2002; 195: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar), HA 6-20-mers induce chemokine gene expression in murine alveolar endothelial cells (24McKee C.M. Penno M.B. Cowman M. Burdick M.D. Strieter R.M. Bao C. Noble P.W. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 2403-2413Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar), and HA 8-50-mers induce angiogenesis (25West D.C. Hampson I.N. Arnold F. Kumar S. Science. 1985; 228: 1324-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). In addition, LMW-HAs have been suggested to play a role in tumor biology. High levels of LMW-HAs have been found in several human tumors, such as bladder (19Lokeshwar V.B. Öbek C. Soloway M.S. Block N.L. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 773-777PubMed Google Scholar) and prostate (17Pham H.T. Block N.L. Lokeshwar V.B. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 778-783PubMed Google Scholar) cancers, Wilms tumor (26Kumar S. West D.C. Ponting J.M. Gattamaneni H.R. Int. J. Cancer. 1989; 44: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and mesothelioma (27Dahl I.M. Laurent T.C. Cancer. 1988; 62: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). HA 36-mers activate tumor cell integrins, resulting in the up-regulation of cell binding to intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) (28Fujisaki T. Tanaka Y. Fujii K. Mine S. Saito K. Yamada S. Yamashita U. Irimura T. Eto S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4427-4434PubMed Google Scholar). HA 6-36-mers enhance CD44 cleavage and promote the migration of tumor cells in a CD44-dependent manner (29Sugahara K.N. Murai T. Nishinakamura H. Kawashima H. Saya H. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32259-32265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), in accordance with the idea that LMWHAs can activate tumor cells via the cell-surface receptor CD44. CD44 is a widely distributed cell-adhesion molecule that serves as one of the cell-surface receptors for HA (6Aruffo A. Stamenkovic I. Melnick M. Underhill C.B. Seed B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1303-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar). CD44 participates in a number of biological events, such as tumor cell invasion and migration (30Naor D. Sionov R.V. Ish-Shalom D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1997; 71: 241-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CD44 is proteolytically cleaved at the extracellular domain by metalloproteases such as MT1-MMP (31Kajita M. Itoh Y. Chiba T. Mori H. Okada A. Kinoh H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), ADAM-10, and ADAM-17 (32Nagano O. Murakami D. Hartmann D. De Strooper B. Saftig P. Iwatsubo T. Nakajima M. Shinohara M. Saya H. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), followed by further cleavage at its intracellular domain that may lead to the up-regulation of CD44 expression (33Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Murakami D. Sasayama T. Araki N. Miki T. Wong A.J. Saya H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Enhanced CD44 cleavage has been reported in various human tumors, including glioma, breast carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, colon carcinoma, and ovarian carcinoma (34Okamoto I. Tsuiki H. Kenyon L.C. Godwin A.K. Emlet D.R. Holgado-Madruga M. Lanham I.S. Joynes C.J. Vo K.T. Guha A. Matsumoto M. Ushio Y. Saya H. Wong A.J. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 441-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), suggesting that this cleavage plays an important role in tumor progression. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that tumor cells themselves may generate LMW-HAs of a certain size range, and that the tumor-related LMW-HAs may in turn activate the tumor cells by interacting with CD44. Here, we demonstrate that LMW-HAs ranging from ∼10- to 40-mers are generated by the action of hyaluronidases in a human pancreatic carcinoma cell line, MIA PaCa-2, and that the generated LMW-HAs activate the cells by enhancing CD44 cleavage and cell motility in a CD44-dependent manner. Our results provide evidence for an autocrine/paracrine process that represents a novel activation mechanism that leads to the promotion and maintenance of the malignant properties of tumor cells. Reagents—A rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb), anti-CD44cyto pAb, which is directed against the cytoplasmic domain of CD44 was kindly provided by Dr. Hideyuki Saya (Department of Tumor Genetics and Biology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan) (35Okamoto I.

An anti-human CD44 monoclonal antibody (mAb), BRIC235, was purchased from the International Blood Group Reference Laboratory (Bristol, UK), and the Fab fragment of BRIC235 was prepared as described previously (29Sugahara K.N.

An anti-β-tubulin mAb and mouse IgG were purchased from Calbiochem (Cambridge, MA) and Sigma, respectively. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were purchased from American Qualex (San Clemente, CA). HA oligosaccharides (HA 10-mers and HA 36-mers) were generously provided by Seikagaku Kogyo Co. (Tokyo, Japan) (36Tawada A. Masa T. Oonuki Y. Watanabe A. Matsuzaki Y. Asari A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Human umbilical cord HA, mainly consisting of 1,000-kDa HA, was purchased from Sigma. pAbs against hyaluronidases (anti-Hyal-1 and anti-Hyal-2) were generated by one of us (37Bourguignon L.Y. Singleton P.A. Diedrich F. Stern R. Gilad E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26991-27007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Sheep testicular hyaluronidase and hyaluronidase from Streptococcus dysgalactiae (hyaluronidase SD) were purchased from Sigma and Seikagaku Kogyo Co., respectively. Carbobenzoxyl-leucinyl-leucinylleucinal (MG132) was from the Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). Cell Culture—The human pancreatic carcinoma cell line MIA PaCa-2 (29Sugahara K.N. Murai T. Nishinakamura H. Kawashima H. Saya H. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32259-32265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) was obtained from the Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research, Institute of Development, Aging and Cancer, Tohoku University (Sendai, Japan). The cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% (v/v) 100 × non-essential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Preparation of MIA PaCa-2 Culture Supernatant—MIA PaCa-2 cells were seeded in a 75-cm2 flask (3 × 105 cells/flask), and incubated overnight at 37 °C. After being washed 3 times with serum-free RPMI medium, the cells were further incubated in the RPMI medium for 3 days. The culture medium was collected and cleared by centrifugation (1,200 × g, 4 °C, 5 min). The preparation (M-sup/conc) used in the measurement of hyaluronidase activities and the detection of hyaluronidase proteins was concentrated 50-fold using Centriplus (cut-off size; 30 kDa) (Millipore, Bedford, MA) before being filtered through a 0.22-μm pore filter (Millipore), and the preparation (M-sup) used in other assays was not concentrated but filtered through a 0.22-μm pore filter. Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—For the detection of HYAL-1 and HYAL-2 transcript expression, RNA isolated from MIA PaCa-2 cells by TRIzol (Invitrogen) and RNeasy (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was reverse transcribed using an OmniScript RT kit (Qiagen). PCR was conducted using primers for HYAL-1 (TCAGCCCCAAGGTTGTCCTCGACCA, CTGCCAGCCAGGGTAGCATCGACAT), HYAL-2 (CTTCTACCGCGACCGTCTA, GCCTTGACATAACGCAGTGT), and β-actin (GATCATTGCTCCCTCCTGAGC, CACCTTCACCGTTCCAGTTT), and Z-Taq polymerase (Takara, Shiga, Japan) by 40 cycles of denaturation (98 °C, 5 s), annealing (57 °C, 5 s), and extension (72 °C, 20 s), followed by a further extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR products (1,300 bp for HYAL-1, 359 bp for HYAL-2, and 308 bp for β-actin) were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. As controls, reverse transcriptase-PCR was carried out without the OmniScript RT kit reagents or in the absence of template in the PCR mixture. Measurement of Hyaluronidase Activities (Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent (ELISA)-like Assay)—Hyaluronidase levels present in the samples were measured using an ELISA-like assay (17Pham H.T. Block N.L. Lokeshwar V.B. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 778-783PubMed Google Scholar, 38Stern M. Stern R. Matrix. 1992; 12: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 39Lokeshwar V.B. Öbek C. Pham H.T. Wei D. Young M.J. Duncan R.C. Soloway M.S. Block N.L. J. Urol. 2000; 163: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The wells in a 96-well microtiter plate were coated with 200 μg/ml 1,000-kDa HA. The HA-coated wells were incubated with various amounts of standard sheep testis hyaluronidase in the culture supernatant of tumor cells for 16 h at 37 °C in hyaluronidase assay buffer (0.1 m sodium formate, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) ranging from pH 3.5 to 4.4. After being washed with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, the wells were incubated with 5 μg/ml biotinylated HA-binding protein (HABP). The HABP bound to the wells was then analyzed quantitatively using an avidin-biotin detection system. A standard curve was drawn by plotting the absorbance at 490 nm against the concentration of the residual 1,000-kDa HA that was not digested by the hyaluronidases, and using this curve, the hyaluronidase activities in each sample were calculated. In some assays, the samples were boiled for 5 min or combined with 5 μg/ml of apigenin (Sigma) before being applied to the wells. Detection of Hyaluronidase Proteins (SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting)—MIA PaCa-2 cells were seeded into 10-cm dishes at 1 × 105 cells per dish, cultured overnight at 37 °C, and then lysed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 140 mm NaCl, 1.6 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Samples extracted from equal numbers of cells were separated by electrophoresis on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel under non-reducing conditions, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride filter. In some assays, 15 μl of M-sup/conc or fresh RPMI was applied instead of cell lysate. The filter was blocked in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with anti-Hyal-1 pAb, anti-Hyal-2 pAb, or anti-β-tubulin mAb. The filters were then incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG to detect the anti-Hyal-1 and anti-Hyal-2 pAbs, or with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG to detect the anti-β-tubulin mAb. The secondary Abs were detected using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Measurement of HA Levels (ELISA)—The HA concentrations in the tumor cell culture supernatants and their gel-filtrated samples were determined by an ELISA that is based on a competitive binding principle (39Lokeshwar V.B. Öbek C. Pham H.T. Wei D. Young M.J. Duncan R.C. Soloway M.S. Block N.L. J. Urol. 2000; 163: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 40Fosang A.J. Hey N.J. Carney S.L. Hardingham T.E. Matrix. 1990; 10: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The HA present in the samples competes with HA coated on the microtiter wells to bind biotinylated HABP (39Lokeshwar V.B. Öbek C. Pham H.T. Wei D. Young M.J. Duncan R.C. Soloway M.S. Block N.L. J. Urol. 2000; 163: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 40Fosang A.J. Hey N.J. Carney S.L. Hardingham T.E. Matrix. 1990; 10: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Ninety-six-well microtiter plates coated with 25 μg/ml 1,000-kDa HA were incubated with serial dilutions of the culture supernatant of tumor cells, the gelfiltrated samples of the culture supernatants, or 1,000-kDa HA and 1 μg/ml biotinylated HABP. Following incubation at 37 °C for 4 h, the wells were washed in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. The HABP bound to the wells was then analyzed quantitatively using an avidin-biotin detection system. A standard curve was drawn by plotting the absorbance at 490 nm against the concentration of 1,000-kDa HA, and using this curve, the HA concentration in each sample was calculated. Size Profiling and Purification of MIA PaCa-2-related HA Oligosaccharides (Gel Filtration Chromatography)—Size profiles of the HA species present in the tumor cell culture supernatant were examined by gel filtration chromatography, in which the sizes of the HA molecules were determined by calibrating the column with 1,000-kDa HA, HA 36-mers (6.9-kDa HA), and HA 10-mers. The tumor cell culture supernatants were applied to a Sepharose CL-6B column (1.5 × 120 cm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with PBS. The column was eluted in PBS at 0.875 ml/min, and 3.5-ml fractions were collected. Subsequently, the fractions were assayed for HA by ELISA as described above. Fractions containing HA oligosaccharides ranging from ∼10- to 40-mers were collected and designated as MIA PaCa-2-derived HA oligosaccharides (M-HA). HA Degradation (Hyaluronidase SD Treatment)—HA fragments contained in the gel-filtrated samples of the tumor cell culture supernatant were digested with 0.05 units of hyaluronidase SD at 37 °C for 4 h, and then passed through a 0.22-μm pore filter. The samples were dialyzed against PBS, and assayed for residual HA by ELISA as described above. In some experiments, hyaluronidase SD was heat-inactivated by boiling before use. CD44 Cleavage Assay—The CD44 cleavage assay was performed as reported previously (29Sugahara K.N. Murai T. Nishinakamura H. Kawashima H. Saya H. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32259-32265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In brief, MIA PaCa-2 cells (5 × 104 cells per well) were seeded into 24-well plates, cultured overnight at 37 °C, and then incubated with 10 μm MG132 for 30 min at 37 °C to inhibit the secondary cleavage of the CD44 intracellular domain (33Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Murakami D. Sasayama T. Araki N. Miki T. Wong A.J. Saya H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). The cells were then incubated with various samples for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of 10 μm MG132. The cells were lysed with SDS sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.02% bromphenol blue) and boiled for 5 min. Samples extracted from equal numbers of cells were separated by electrophoresis on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride filter. The filter was blocked in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with anti-CD44cyto pAb or with anti-β-tubulin mAb. The filter was then incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG to detect the anti-CD44cyto pAb, or with HRPconjugated anti-mouse IgG to detect the anti-β-tubulin mAb. The secondary Abs were detected using ECL Western blotting detection reagents. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as reported previously (29Sugahara K.N. Murai T. Nishinakamura H. Kawashima H. Saya H. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32259-32265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Migration Assay—Cell migration was analyzed using 12-well Costar Transwell chambers (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) containing polycarbonate filters with a 12-μm pore size (29Sugahara K.N. Murai T. Nishinakamura H. Kawashima H. Saya H. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32259-32265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Both sides of the filter were coated with 500 μ g/ml 1,000-kDa HA. MIA PaCa-2 cells (2 × 105 cells/ml) were added to the upper compartment and were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h so that the cells became attached to the filter. The cells were then incubated with or without 10 μg/ml BRIC235 or mouse IgG 20 min prior to and during the migration assay. Finally, various HA preparations were added to the upper compartment of the wells at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. The chambers were subsequently incubated at 37 °C for 15 h. After the cells on the upper side of the filters were gently wiped off, the filters were fixed in methanol, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and mounted on glass slides. Cells that had migrated to the lower side of the filters were counted under a light microscope. The number of cells in 10 defined high-power fields (×200) was counted, and the average was determined. Each assay was performed five times. MIA PaCa-2 Cells Express Hyaluronidases and Secrete Them into the Culture Supernatant—We have previously reported that HA oligosaccharides of a certain size range up-regulate CD44 cleavage in CD44-expressing pancreatic carcinoma cell line, MIA PaCa-2 (29Sugahara K.N. Murai T. Nishinakamura H. Kawashima H. Saya H. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32259-32265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Because the MIA PaCa-2 cells show CD44 cleavage in the absence of any exogenous stimulation at a readily detectable level, we investigated the possibility that these tumor cells may themselves generate CD44 cleavage-inducible HA oligosaccharides by expressing HA-degrading enzymes. As shown in Fig. 1A, the MIA PaCa-2 culture supernatant was found to contain potent HA-degrading activities, which digested HA in a highly pH-dependent manner with the optimal pH of 4.0. These activities were abrogated by heat inactivation of the culture supernatant (Fig. 1B) and by a hyaluronidase inhibitor, apigenin (Fig. 1C), in accordance with the hypothesis that MIA PaCa-2 cells produce hyaluronidases. The presence of HA-degrading activities in the culture supernatant was also confirmed by a substrate-gel electrophoresis analysis (data not shown). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 2, MIA PaCa-2 cells expressed two of the known hyaluronidases, Hyal-1 (41Afify A.M. Stern M. Guntenhoner M. Stern R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 434-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and Hyal-2 (42Lepperdinger G. Strobl B. Kreil G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22466-22470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), at both the mRNA and protein levels and secreted both of these proteins into the culture supernatant (Fig. 2). Consistent with previous data, Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 expression were detected in a human prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP (17Pham H.T. Block N.L. Lokeshwar V.B. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 778-783PubMed Google Scholar) and in a human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB231 (37Bourguignon L.Y. Singleton P.A. Diedrich F. Stern R. Gilad E. J. Biol.

The expression levels of Hyal-1 (upper panel) and Hyal-2 (lower panel) were examined by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR (lane 1) and Western blotting (lanes 2-4). Note that both Hyal-1 and Hyal-2 were expressed at the mRNA level (lane 1) and at the protein level (cell lysate, lane 2; and M-sup/conc, lane 4) in MIA PaCa-2 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MIA PaCa-2 Cells Generate HA Oligosaccharides—Tumor cells often demonstrate an up-regulated production of HA (9Ropponen K.

https://openalex.org/W1965359726,"The fusion peptide of influenza hemagglutinin is crucial for cell entry of this virus. Previous studies showed that this peptide adopts a boomerang-shaped structure in lipid model membranes at the pH of membrane fusion. To examine the role of the boomerang in fusion, we changed several residues proposed to stabilize the kink in this structure and measured fusion. Among these, mutants E11A and W14A expressed hemagglutinins with hemifusion and no fusion activities, and F9A and N12A had no effect on fusion, respectively. Binding enthalpies and free energies of mutant peptides to model membranes and their ability to perturb lipid bilayer structures correlated well with the fusion activities of the parent full-length molecules. The structure of W14A determined by NMR and site-directed spin labeling features a flexible kink that points out of the membrane, in sharp contrast to the more ordered boomerang of the wild-type, which points into the membrane. A specific fixed angle boomerang structure is thus required to support membrane fusion. The fusion peptide of influenza hemagglutinin is crucial for cell entry of this virus.

Some viruses fuse with the plasma membrane at the cell surface, but others are first taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis and subsequently fuse with the endosomal membrane triggered by the acidic pH that prevails in the endosome. Influenza virus belongs to the second group. The major glycoprotein on the viral surface, influenza hemagglutinin (HA), 2The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; ATR, attenuated total reflection; DPC, dodecylphosphocholine; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; FTIR, Fourier transform infrared; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; RBC, red blood cell; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; POPC, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; POPG, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol; SUV, small unilamellar vesicle; NiEDDA, nickel (II)-ethylenediamine-N′,N′-diacetic acid. binds to sialic acid residues on the surface of host cells and undergoes a dramatic conformational change when the pH drops below ∼5.3 in the endosome (1Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 531-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (2226) Google Scholar, 2Earp L.J. Delos S.E. Park H.E. White J.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2005; 285: 25-66PubMed Google Scholar, 3Lai A.L. Li Y. Tamm L.K. Protein-Lipid Interactions.in: Tamm L.K. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany2005: 279-303Google Scholar). This conformational change, among other rearrangements, exposes an N-terminal quite hydrophobic peptide of HA2, the smaller of the two HA subunits, and makes it available for interaction with the lipid bilayer of the endosomal membrane. Because this peptide is essential for fusion and thus very highly conserved in sequence among all known strains of influenza virus, it has been termed the “fusion peptide.” Because influenza HAs are trimers consisting of three HA1 and three HA2 subunits and because several HA molecules are needed to build a single fusion site, it is likely that multiples of three fusion peptides insert into the target membrane to initiate fusion between the viral and the target membrane. The C-terminal end of the HA2 chain contains the transmembrane domain that anchors HA in the viral membrane. A salient feature of the pH-induced conformational change of HA is that the ectodomain between the fusion peptide and the transmembrane domain rearranges such that the N and C termini end up at one end of the rod-shaped molecule in very close proximity to each other (4Chen J. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8967-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and thus potentially allow for a mutual contact between the fusion peptides and the transmembrane domains at some point during the fusion reaction. An assessment of the structures of the fusion peptides and transmembrane domains before, during, and after fusion is therefore of high interest in our quest to understand the mechanism of influenza HA-mediated membrane fusion at the molecular level. We have recently determined the structure of the wild-type fusion peptide of HA in dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles by NMR and in lipid bilayer model membranes by EPR spectroscopy (5Han X. Bushweller J.H. Cafiso D.S. Tamm L.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The ∼24-residue fusion peptide features two short helices at pH 5 which are separated by a ∼105° kink at Asn-12. The N-terminal helix is more hydrophobic and contains a conserved glycine edge followed by Glu-11 on one face. The C-terminal half is more amphipathic with a number of polar and charged residues on its upper face and bulky hydrophobic residues including Trp-14 on its lower membrane-dipped face. This structure together with the close proximity of the N and C termini in the low pH crystal structure of the ectodomain and the lower energy of the pH 5 compared with the pH 7 conformation have led to the formulation of the spring-loaded boomerang model of influenza HA-mediated membrane fusion (6Tamm L.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1614: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The angled boomerang structure may be required for membrane fusion. For example, the fusion peptide mutant G1V, which in the context of full-length HA is completely defective in mediating membrane fusion (7Qiao H. Armstrong R.T. Melikyan G.B. Cohen F.S. White J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2759-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), exhibits a linear helical structure in lipid model membranes (8Li Y. Han X. Lai A.L. Bushweller J.H. Cafiso D.S. Tamm L.K. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 12065-12076Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To test whether a boomerang structure is necessary and sufficient for membrane fusion, we targeted the residues that define the angle of the boomerang by site-directed mutagenesis. We analyzed the mutants both in full-length HA to assess their fusion activity in red blood cell (RBC)-cell fusion assays, and in peptide models to assess their structures and lipid interactions in model membranes. Our structure-energetics-function correlations support the notion that a specific fixed angle boomerang is required for tight interactions with lipids of the target membrane and for membrane fusion. Mutagenesis—Mutations were introduced into the pTM1-HA vector with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Primers were purchased from IDT DNA, Inc. The E11A and W14A mutant HAs were sequenced completely. For the other mutants, the sequence around the fusion peptide region (> 500 bp) was checked. HA Expression—Subconfluent monolayers of CV-1 cells in 6-cm dishes were infected with modified Vaccinia ankara, which encodes T7 polymerase, for 1 h at 37°C with rocking every 15 min. The cells were then washed twice with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline, transfected with 1 μg of wild-type or mutant pTM1-HA DNA using 12 μl of Mirus Transit (Panvera), and incubated in Opti-MEM I at 37 °C for 5 h. Finally, the DNA/Transit mixture was replaced with Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and the cells were cultured for a further 16 h. Red Blood Cell Fusion Assay—Fresh human RBCs were double labeled with R18 and CF (Molecular Probes, Inc.), and fusion assays with HA-expressing cells were performed under a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss) as described previously (9Armstrong R.T. Kushnir A.S. White J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). RBC binding and lipid and contents mixing events were counted. Fusion was expressed as lipid mixing ratio (CV-1 cells that were stained with R18 divided by CV-1 cells that bound RBCs) and contents mixing ratio (CV-1 cells that were stained with CF divided by CV-1 cells that bound RBCs). Red Blood Cell Dequenching Assay—HA-expressing CV-1 cell, R18-labeled RBC complexes were prepared, and fusion was measured by dequenching in a spectrofluorometer (SPEX Fluorolog) at 37 °C as described previously (9Armstrong R.T. Kushnir A.S. White J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The percent fluorescence dequenching (FDQ) was calculated asFDQ=(F1-F0/Fdet-F0)×100(Eq. 1) where F0 is the fluorescence during the initial pH 7.0 incubation, F1 is the fluorescence at the end of the pH 5 incubation period and before the addition of detergent, and Fdet is the fluorescence in the presence of detergent. The initial rates of fusion were determined from the slope of the initial increase of the fluorescence dequenching signal. Immunoprecipitation and Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter (FACS)—Biotinylation, immunoprecipitation, and Western blot analysis of cell surface proteins were conducted as described previously (9Armstrong R.T. Kushnir A.S. White J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 425-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Cell surface expression of HA was measured in a FACS (BD Biosciences) as described previously (7Qiao H. Armstrong R.T. Melikyan G.B. Cohen F.S. White J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2759-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Peptides and Lipids—All peptides were synthesized by solid phase synthesis by the Biomolecular Research Facility at the University of Virginia. All lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Small Unilamellar Lipid Vesicles—Desired amounts of POPG and POPC from chloroform stock solutions were dried at the bottom of glass test tubes overnight under vacuum. pH 5 buffer (5 mm HEPES, 10 mm MES, pH 5) was added, and the suspension was vortexed to give a 5 mm lipid dispersion. The dispersion was then sonicated in an ice-water bath using a titanium tip ultrasonicator (Branson) for ∼1 h at 50% duty cycle until the solution was transparent. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—All measurements were carried out at 25 °C in a high sensitivity MCS titration calorimeter (MicroCal, Inc.) as described previously (10Li Y. Han X. Tamm L.K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7245-7251Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To measure reaction enthalpies, 10-μl aliquots of 20 μm peptide were injected into the sample cell containing 2 ml of 5 mm POPC:POPG (4:1) SUVs. To measure free energies, 10-μl aliquots of 5 mm POPC:POPG (4:1) SUVs were injected into the sample cell containing 2 ml of 20 μm peptide. Enthalpies of dilution and mixing were determined by running control experiments with the polar C-terminal host peptide. Analysis of Binding Data—Intrinsic partition coefficients, K0, were calculated from the apparent partition coefficients, Kapp, using the Gouy-Chapman theory with a membrane surface potential ψo of -96.1 mV and Equation 2,K0=Kappexp(zpFψ0/RT)(Eq. 2) where zp = peptide charge, F = Faraday's constant, R = gas constant, and T = absolute temperature. 3The nominal charges of the wild-type, F9A, N12A, and W14A peptides are +1.0, and this charge has been used for zp in these calculations. An effective charge of +1.22 was used for the E11A peptide, which is less than its nominal charge of +2.0. The effective charge of E11A was estimated based on an expected pKa shift of +0.55 of a glutamate at a negatively charged surface at pH 5. Free energy changes associated with the binding of the fusion peptides to lipid bilayers were calculated using the following equation. 4The value of 55.5 m accounts for the cratic contribution of the molarity of water. ΔG=-RTln(55.5K0)(Eq. 3) Entropy changes were calculated by Equation 4.ΔG=ΔH-TΔS(Eq. 4) Circular Dichroism and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy—0.1 mg/ml peptide was added to SUVs composed of POPC: POPG (4:1) or DPC micelles at a ratio of 1:200 peptide:lipid and degassed for 5 min at room temperature before measurement. CD spectra were collected at 25 °C on an AVIV model 215 spectropolarimeter. The signals from pure SUVs or DPC micelles were subtracted from the sample spectra as blanks. For FTIR, planar phospholipid bilayers supported on germanium ATR plates were prepared as described previously (11Han X. Tamm L.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 953-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The substrate-supported monolayer was 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and the monolayer exposed to the buffer compartment was POPC:POPG (4:1). Desired amounts of peptide in pH 5 buffer were added to the sample cell, incubated for 5 min at room temperature, and excess unbound peptide was washed away with pH 5 buffer made in D2O. Polarized spectra were recorded on a Bruker Optics Vector 22 FTIR spectrometer. Order parameters and average insertion angles were calculated as described previously (12Tamm L.K. Tatulian S.A. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1997; 30: 365-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). NMR Spectroscopy and Structure Calculation—NMR spectra were collected on a Varian Inova 600 MHz spectrometer, processed, and structures were calculated as described previously (8Li Y. Han X. Lai A.L. Bushweller J.H. Cafiso D.S. Tamm L.K. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 12065-12076Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The 100 conformers with the lowest energy target function values were energy-minimized using the program OPAL with the Amber94 force field (13Luginbühl P. Güntert P. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 136-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The energy-minimized conformers were aligned and displayed using the program MOLMOL (14Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14 (29-32): 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6490) Google Scholar). EPR Spectroscopy and Docking of NMR Structures to EPR Depth Data—Peptides containing single cysteines were labeled with the methane-thiosulfonate spin label and purified as described previously (8Li Y. Han X. Lai A.L. Bushweller J.H. Cafiso D.S. Tamm L.K. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 12065-12076Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Power-saturation EPR measurements of spin-labeled peptides bound to lipid vesicles in the presence of N2, air, and N2 with 20 mm NiEDDA were performed with a Varian E-line Centuries Series spectrometer as described previously (8Li Y. Han X. Lai A.L. Bushweller J.H. Cafiso D.S. Tamm L.K. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 12065-12076Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Representative NMR conformers with substituted spin labels were docked to lipid bilayers with the program Insight II (Accelrys). The dihedral angles χ1 and χ2 of the spin label were set to 300° (15Langen R. Oh K.J. Cascio D. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8396-8405Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), and the values of χ3, which can assume values of +90°(p) or -90°(n), were determined for each site by energy minimization with the Amber force field. The energy-minimized structure had the χ3 combination nnnp for the four consecutively labeled residues. Fusion Activity of HA Mutants—The angle of the boomerang of the fusion peptide structure in membranes is stabilized by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions between bulky apolar residues distributed around Asn-12, which forms the apex of the structure. To examine the importance of the kink region for fusion, we individually changed four potentially critical residues, namely, Phe-9, Glu-11, Asp-12, and Trp-14 to alanines to make mutant HAs designated F9A, E11A, N12A, and W14A, respectively. These amino acids were targeted because they each contribute hydrogen bonds to the kink in the wild-type fusion peptide (5Han X. Bushweller J.H. Cafiso D.S. Tamm L.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The aromatic side chains of Phe-9 and Trp-14, in addition, appear to contribute hydrophobic interactions to the structural definition of the kink. CV-1 cells were transfected with plasmids harboring HA with or without the respective mutations. Fusion activities of cells expressing the wild-type and mutant HAs were measured by two different methods. Fluorescence microscopy was used to observe lipid and contents mixing at the single cell level at a fixed time point, and spectrofluorometry was used to measure the initial kinetics of lipid mixing in populations of cells. In both cases, fluorescently labeled RBCs served as target cells. For fluorescence microscopy, the RBCs were labeled with the lipid probe octadecylrhodamine B chloride (R18, red) and the contents probe carboxyfluorescein (CF, green). The RBCs were first bound to HA-expressing cells that had been pretreated with a small amount of trypsin to cleave inactive HA0 into active HA1 and HA2. Fusion was induced with a 5-min pulse of pH 5 fusion buffer at 37 °C, and the reneutralized samples were observed under a fluorescence microscope. Cells were classified as “fully fused” when the red and green dyes had been transferred to the CV-1 cell, as “hemifused” when only the red dye had been transferred, and as “not fused” when neither dye had been transferred. The results are shown in Fig. 1. The F9A and N12A mutants behaved similarly to wild-type HA: they underwent lipid and contents mixing, indicating full fusion. E11A induced lipid mixing in ∼60% of all cells with bound RBCs and essentially no contents mixing. This is the hall-mark of hemifusion. W14A did not show lipid or contents mixing. Although W14A is essentially blocked before reaching the hemifusion stage, 13% showed a small amount of partial lipid mixing, reminiscent of a fusion phenotype described recently (16Zaitseva E. Mittal A. Griffin D.E. Chernomordik L.V. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Spectrofluorometric lipid mixing experiments are presented in Fig. 2. They confirm the graduated fusion activities of the different HA mutants. Wild-type, N12A, and F9A HAs exhibited similar initial rates of fusion, whereas those of E11A and particularly W14A were distinctly slower. The results obtained with W14A were also compared with the well established nonfusing HA fusion peptide mutant G1V (7Qiao H. Armstrong R.T. Melikyan G.B. Cohen F.S. White J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2759-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Both have very low initial rates of fusion, but the signal of W14A creeps up very slowly, which is probably a result of the spurious partial lipid mixing that we observed with this mutant in the single cell fusion assays. One might therefore call W14A “severely fusion compromised.” However, because the initial rates of fusion of G1V and W14A are almost zero, and because only very limited partial fusion was ever observed with W14A in the fluorescence microscope fusion experiments, we hereafter term W14A as “nonfusogenic.” In conclusion, N12A and F9A are identified as having fully fused phenotypes, E11A as having a hemifusion phenotype, and W14A as having a nonfusion phenotype. Except for Glu-11, these residues have not been targeted before by mutagenesis. Glu-11 was replaced with a Gly by Gething et al. (17Gething M.J. Doms R.W. York D. White J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and Schoch and Blumenthal (18Schoch C. Blumenthal R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9267-9274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and with a Val by Steinhauer et al. (19Steinhauer D.A. Wharton S.A. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6643-6651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the E11G (but not the E11V) mutant was impaired in heterokaryon formation, the authors of the first two papers noted fusion of horseradish peroxidase- or fluorescent dextran-loaded RBCs. These differences may be caused by either the specific substitutions or differences in expression levels. Expression and Processing of Mutant HAs on the Cell Surface—Experiments were conducted to ascertain that differences in surface expression and the ability of HA to be cleaved by trypsin into HA1 and HA2 were not responsible for the different fusion activities of the mutant HAs. To measure surface expression, the HA-expressing cells were labeled with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody followed by a fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibody, and their fluorescence distribution was measured with a FACS. This experiment yields information on the percentage of HA-expressing cells as well as on the relative amount of HA expressed per cell. We noted that a smaller percentage of cells expressed E11A than cells that expressed all other mutants and wild-type. However, all cells that did express E11A did so at a level comparable with the wild-type and all other mutants (Fig. 3A). Therefore, any fusion defects cannot be the result of differences in protein level on the expressing cell surface. To determine whether surface-expressed HAs were processed properly by trypsin, transfected and trypsin-treated CV-1 cells were labeled with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin. The cells were then lysed, and HA was immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody and protein A-conjugated beads. After running the samples on SDS-PAGE, the gels were probed with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase, which only reveals HA that was on the cell surface during biotinylation. The results presented in Fig. 3B show that all mutants were cleaved by trypsin into HA1 and HA2 as expected. In conclusion, the different fusion phenotypes of E11A and W14A are not the result of reduced expression per cell or cleavage by trypsin on the surface of the CV-1 cells, but the result of intrinsic differences of their fusion activities. Binding of HA Fusion Peptide Mutants to Lipid Bilayers—To examine whether differences in the measured fusion activities could be caused by differences in binding or other modalities of lipid interaction of the different fusion peptide sequences to lipid model membranes, we prepared fusion peptides comprising the first 20 amino acids of the HA2 sequence followed by the highly polar and flexible sequence GCGKKKK. As described previously, this host-guest system greatly increases the solubility of these peptides and permits measurements of equilibrium binding to lipid bilayer model membranes from aqueous solution (20Han X. Tamm L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13097-13102Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The flexible linker between the guest and host portions of the peptide does not affect the fusion peptide-lipid interactions and the polar sequence substitutes for the polar ectodomain of HA as described previously. We first measured the equilibrium partition coefficients for the binding of each of the peptides to lipid bilayers by isothermal titration calorimetry. The titration of SUVs to the F9A fusion peptide is shown in Fig. 4A as an example. After about eight injections all free peptide is bound to lipid, and the remaining spurious heats of reaction are the result of the enthalpies of dilution and mixing, which are corrected for by subtracting appropriate controls. From these data the fraction of bound peptide/mol of lipid, Xb, and the concentration of free peptide, Cf, are obtained. As shown in Fig. 4B, a plot of Xb versus Cf yields a straight line with a slope that is the apparent mol fraction partition coefficient, Kapp. Such plots were obtained for each of the four mutant and the wild-type fusion peptides. The resulting partition coefficients are listed in Table 1. Most fusion peptides have Kapp values in the range of 5.1-13.3 × 105m-1, but W14A has a 10-fold lower Kapp of 5 × 104m-1.TABLE 1Thermodynamic parameters of fusion peptide binding to lipid bilayers composed of POPC:POPG (4:1) at pH 5PeptideKapp/105K0/104aK0 and ΔΔG were calculated individually for each experiment and then averaged.ΔΔGaK0 and ΔΔG were calculated individually for each experiment and then averaged.ΔΔH−TΔΔSm−1m−1kcal/molkcal/molkcal/molWT6.3 ± 0.51.5 ± 0.1−7.2 ± 0.4−15.8 ± 0.58.6 ± 0.6F9A5.1 ± 0.61.2 ± 0.2−7.0 ± 0.7−16.4 ± 0.59.4 ± 0.9E11A13.3 ± 1.91.4 ± 0.3−7.1 ± 0.7−10.2 ± 0.63.1 ± 0.9N12A5.5 ± 0.61.3 ± 0.3−7.1 ± 0.6−15.1 ± 0.68.0 ± 0.9W14A0.50 ± 0.040.12 ± 0.01−5.6 ± 0.3−8.9 ± 0.43.3 ± 0.5a K0 and ΔΔG were calculated individually for each experiment and then averaged. Open table in a new tab All peptides except E11A have a net positive charge of 1, and E11A has a net positive charge of 2. Therefore, all peptides will be electrostatically attracted to the negatively charged membrane surfaces, and the peptide concentrations near the membrane will be higher than the bulk concentrations in solution. The electrostatic contribution to this interaction was calculated by the Gouy-Chapman theory and subtracted from the apparent partition coefficient to obtain the intrinsic mol fraction partition coefficient and corresponding free energy change (11Han X. Tamm L.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 953-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 20Han X. Tamm L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13097-13102Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). As shown in Table 1, the free energy changes of the wild-type, F9A, E11A, and N12A fusion peptides are around -7 kcal/mol, but the ΔΔG of binding W14A is only -5.6 kcal/mol. The values of the former peptides are very similar to those reported previously for the wild-type peptide (10Li Y. Han X. Tamm L.K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7245-7251Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 20Han X. Tamm L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13097-13102Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The good agreement of the binding constants and ΔΔG values confirms that these parameters can be measured reliably by a fluorescence method (10Li Y. Han X. Tamm L.K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7245-7251Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or isothermal titration calorimetry (this work). The enthalpy changes that are associated with the binding of fusion peptides to lipid bilayers were determined by a reverse titration isothermal titration calorimetry experiment (10Li Y. Han X. Tamm L.K. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 7245-7251Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The integrated heats from each injection are measures of the reaction enthalpy as shown in Fig. 4, C and D. After subtraction of the appropriate controls, one obtains the enthalpy changes, ΔΔH, of the binding of the mutant and wild-type fusion peptides to lipid bilayers, which are summarized in Table 1. The wild-type and the F9A and N12A mutants exhibit similar enthalpy changes of binding (about -15 to -16 kcal/mol), whereas E11A and W14A exhibit significantly smaller values of ΔΔH, i.e. -10 and -9 kcal/mol, respectively. The enthalpy changes (and to a lesser extent also the free energy and entropy changes, not shown) of the different peptides correlate quite well with the fusion activities of the corresponding mutants (Fig. 5). To extend the correlation to earlier results, the fusion activities and enthalpy changes of G1S and G1V are also included in this comparison. The nonfusion mutants G1V and W14A clearly show the lowest ΔΔH of binding. The hemifusion mutants G1S and E11A show intermediate values of ΔΔH, and the wild-type and unimpaired mutants show the largest (negative) values of ΔΔH. Perturbation of Lipid Bilayer Order by HA Fusion Peptide Mutants—The perturbation of the lipid bilayer structure by the HA fusion peptide mutants was investigated by polarized ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. The order of the acyl chains in a fluid lipid bilayer is described by the order parameter SL, which is an average of all angles θ from the membrane normal that are experienced by the methylene segments of the acyl chains.SL=(32)〈cos2θ-1〉(Eq. 5) SL values for the bilayer in the presence and absence of the fusion peptides were determined from the ATR dichroic ratios, RATR, of the methylene stretching vibrations at 2920 cm-1 and 2850 cm-1 (Table 2). The theoretical range of these order parameters is from 0 to 1 for completely disordered to completely ordered acyl chains, respectively. The data of Table 2 indicate that the wild-type and the fusogenic mutant peptides F9A and N12A increase the order of the bilayer more than the fusion-deficient mutants W14A and E11A, as has been noted previously for other fusogenic and nonfusogenic HA fusion peptides (21Gray C.

https://openalex.org/W2058717038,"In a process called capacitation, mammalian sperm gain the ability to fertilize after residing in the female tract. During capacitation the mouse sperm plasma membrane potential (Em) hyperpolarizes. However, the mechanisms that regulate sperm Em are not well understood. Here we show that sperm hyperpolarize when external Na+ is replaced by N-methyl-glucamine. Readdition of external Na+ restores a more depolarized Em by a process that is inhibited by amiloride or by its more potent derivative 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride hydrochloride. These findings indicate that under resting conditions an electrogenic Na+ transporter, possibly involving an amiloride sensitive Na+ channel, may contribute to the sperm resting Em. Consistent with this proposal, patch clamp recordings from spermatogenic cells reveal an amiloride-sensitive inward Na+ current whose characteristics match those of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) family of epithelial Na+ channels. Indeed, ENaC-α and -δ mRNAs were detected by reverse transcription-PCR in extracts of isolated elongated spermatids, and ENaC-α and -δ proteins were found on immunoblots of sperm membrane preparations. Immunostaining indicated localization of ENaC-α to the flagellar midpiece and of ENaC-δ to the acrosome. Incubations known to produce capacitation in vitro or induction of capacitation by cell-permeant cAMP analogs decreased the depolarizing response to the addition of external Na+.

Mammalian sperm are not able to fertilize after ejaculation. They acquire this ability only after residing in the female uterine tract for a finite period of time that varies depending on the species. The molecular, biochemical, and physiological changes that occur in sperm while in the female tract are collectively referred to as capacitation (1Yanagimachi R. The Physiology of Reproduction.in: Knobil E. Neill J.D. Vol. 1. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 189-317Google Scholar). Capacitation is associated with changes in membrane properties, enzyme activities, and motility that prepare the sperm for the acrosome reaction and for penetration of the egg vestments prior to fertilization. The molecular basis of capacitation has been partially defined and includes: the removal of cholesterol from the sperm plasma membrane by cholesterol acceptors such as bovine serum albumin (2Visconti P.E.

These events are likely to play a role in the induction of hyperactivated motility and the ability of the sperm to undergo a regulated acrosome reaction (for review see Ref. 8Visconti P.E.

Bovine and mouse sperm capacitation is also accompanied by a plasma membrane hyperpolarization. Em decreases in mouse sperm from –38 to –55 mV (4Demarco I.A. Espinosa F. Edwards J. Sosnik J.

Biol. 1995; 171: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Because capacitation prepares sperm for the acrosome reaction, the capacitation-associated hyperpolarization may regulate the ability of sperm to generate transient Ca2+ elevations during the acrosome reaction induced by physiological agonists (e.g. zona pellucida) (11Florman H.M. Arnoult C. Kazam I.G. Li C. O'Toole C.M. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In this respect, low voltage-activated T-type Ca2+ channels have been detected in mouse spermatogenic cells (12Lievano A. Santi C.M. Serrano C.J. Trevino C.L. Bellve A.R. Hernandez-Cruz A. Darszon A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 13Arnoult C. Villaz M. Florman H.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 1104-1111PubMed Google Scholar), and these channels are also present in mature mouse sperm (14Arnoult C. Cardullo R.A. Lemos J.R. Florman H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13004-13009Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 15Treviño C.L. Felix R. Castellano L.E. Gutierrez C. Rodriguez D. Pacheco J. Lopez-Gonzalez I. Gomora J.C. Tsutsumi V. Hernandez-Cruz A. Fiordelisio T. Scaling A.L. Darszon A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 563: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). One unique property of low voltage-activated Ca2+ channels is that they inactivate at the resting Em of sperm prior to capacitation (around –35 mV) (12Lievano A. Santi C.M. Serrano C.J. Trevino C.L. Bellve A.R. Hernandez-Cruz A. Darszon A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 14Arnoult C. Cardullo R.A. Lemos J.R. Florman H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13004-13009Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Thus, if low voltage-activated Ca2+ channels are involved in the regulation of the acrosome reaction, the capacitation-associated sperm hyperpolarization may be required to remove this inactivation (11Florman H.M. Arnoult C. Kazam I.G. Li C. O'Toole C.M. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 16Arnoult C. Kazam I.G. Visconti P.E. Kopf G.S. Villaz M. Florman H.M. Proc. Natl.

Biol. 2001; 236: 210-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanisms by which the sperm Em hyperpolarizes during capacitation are not clear, there exist several potential candidates. Muñoz-Garay et al. (10Muñoz-Garay C. De la Vega-Beltran J.L. Delgado R. Labarca P. Felix R. Darszon A. Dev. Biol. 2001; 234: 261-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) demonstrated with patch clamp techniques that inward rectifying K+ channels are expressed in mouse spermatogenic cells and proposed that these channels may contribute to the capacitation-associated sperm membrane hyperpolarization. An increase in sperm K+ permeability should lead to an Em hyperpolarization, according to the K+ equilibrium potential (18Wright S.H. Adv. Physiol. Educ. 2004; 28: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the sperm plasma membrane may become less permeable to Na+. The relatively depolarized mammalian sperm resting Em before capacitation could be explained, at least in part, by a relatively high Na+ permeability. A capacitation-dependent decrease of this permeability would result in a sperm hyperpolarization. It has been reported that human sperm suspended in 0 Ca2+ medium undergo a Na+-dependent depolarization. Li+ can replace Na+; thus, these findings suggest that a Na+- and Li+-permeable electrogenic pathway may be present in mammalian sperm (19Gonzalez-Martinez M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36304-36310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The present work explores this later possibility. We observed that replacement of external Na+ by nonpermeable cations resulted in sperm Em hyperpolarization. The addition of external Na+ to these sperm produced a depolarization that was potently inhibited by amiloride and its analog EIPA, 2The abbreviations used are: EIPA, 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride hydrochloride; ENaC, epithelial Na+ channel(s); BCECF, 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-carboxyfluorescein; AM, acetoxymethyl ester; WH, Whitten’s HEPES-buffered; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PC, polycystin; m-chlorophenylhydrazone, carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone; Sp-cAMPS, Sp-adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate. 2The abbreviations used are: EIPA, 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride hydrochloride; ENaC, epithelial Na+ channel(s); BCECF, 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-carboxyfluorescein; AM, acetoxymethyl ester; WH, Whitten’s HEPES-buffered; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PC, polycystin; m-chlorophenylhydrazone, carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone; Sp-cAMPS, Sp-adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate. high pH, and the incubation of mouse sperm under capacitating conditions. Moreover, high pH and amiloride were also capable of hyperpolarizing sperm in the presence of Na+. Altogether, these results suggest that epithelial Na+ channels (ENaCs) are present in mouse sperm and that they may contribute to the capacitation-associated hyperpolarization. Consistent with this hypothesis, we detected the transcripts for both ENaC-α and ENaC-δ subunits in mouse spermatogenic cells and the respective proteins in mature sperm. This is the first time ENaC-δ is reported in mouse. Furthermore, we used electrophysiological techniques to demonstrate the presence of ENaC type currents in spermatogenic cells, the precursors of sperm. Finally, we present evidence that reduction of the Na+ sperm permeability does contribute to the capacitation-associated Em hyperpolarization. Materials—Amiloride, dibutyryl cAMP, m-chlorophenylhydrazone (carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone), valinomycin, choline chloride (choline+Cl–), choline bicarbonate (choline+HCO–3), N-methyl-d-glucamine, and water for embryo transfer (used to make Whitten’s medium) were purchased from Sigma. EIPA, 3,3′-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide (DiSC3) (5Visconti P.E. Bailey J.L. Moore G.D. Pan D. Olds-Clarke P. Kopf G.S. Development. 1995; 121: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-carboxyfluorescein-acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM), and Sodium Green tetraacetate were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Sp-cAMPS, and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine were purchased from Biomol (Butler Pike, PA). Polyclonal antibodies against ENaC-α and ENaC-δ were purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Donkey anti-rabbit IgG biotin-conjugated and Avidin fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies were from Pierce. The following compounds were prepared in Me2SO at the stock concentrations noted between parentheses and stored at –20 °C except when otherwise stated: DiSC3 (5Visconti P.E. Bailey J.L. Moore G.D. Pan D. Olds-Clarke P. Kopf G.S. Development. 1995; 121: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), BCECF-AM, and m-chlorophenylhydrazone and valinomycin (1 mm stocks). Other compounds were prepared on the day of the experiment and dissolved in Whitten’s medium and added at the final concentration indicated between parentheses: Sp-cAMPS (100 μm), Rp-cAMPS (100 μm), dibutyryl cAMP (1 mm), and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (100 μm). Sperm Preparation—Experimental protocols were approved by the University of Massachusetts Animal Care Committee. In most experiments, cauda epididymal mouse sperm were collected from CD1 retired male breeders by placing minced cauda epididymis in a modified Krebs-Ringer medium (Whitten’s HEPES-buffered (WH) medium) (20Moore G.D. Ayabe T. Visconti P.E. Schultz R.M. Kopf G.S. Development. 1994; 120: 3313-3323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This medium, which does not support capacitation, was first prepared in the absence of bovine serum albumin and NaHCO3 and contains 1 mm polyvinyl pyrrolidone (average molecular weight, 40,000). After 5 min, sperm in suspension were washed in 10 ml of the same medium by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min at room temperature. The sperm were then resuspended to a final concentration of 2 × 107 cells/ml and diluted 10 times in the appropriate medium depending on the experiment performed. In experiments where capacitation was investigated, 5 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin and 24 mm of NaHCO3 were added. The pH was maintained at 7.2 except when the role of extracellular pH (pHe) was evaluated. To study the role of Na+ in capacitation and in the regulation of Em, NaCl was replaced by either choline+Cl– or N-methyl-d-glucamine+Cl– up to the concentration indicated in the respective experiment. Membrane Potential Assay in Sperm Populations—Em was measured as previously described (4Demarco I.A. Espinosa F. Edwards J. Sosnik J. De La Vega-Beltran J.L. Hockensmith J.W. Kopf G.S. Darszon A.

Briefly, sperm were collected as indicated above and, after dilution in the appropriate medium, capacitated for different time periods depending on the experiment. Eight min before the measurement, 1 μm DiSC3 (5Visconti P.E. Bailey J.L. Moore G.D. Pan D. Olds-Clarke P. Kopf G.S. Development. 1995; 121: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (final concentration) was added to the sperm suspension and further incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. One μm m-chlorophenylhydrazone (final concentration) was then added to collapse mitochondrial potential, and the sperm was incubated for 2 additional min. After this period, 1.5 ml of the suspension was transferred to a gently stirred cuvette at 37 °C, and the fluorescence (620/670 nm excitation/emission) was recorded continuously. Calibration was performed as described before (4Demarco I.A. Espinosa F. Edwards J. Sosnik J. De La Vega-Beltran J.L. Hockensmith J.W. Kopf G.S. Darszon A. Visconti P.E. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To analyze changes provoked by the addition of Na+, sperm were recovered as described above and incubated for different time periods depending on the experiment. The cells were then transferred to a gently stirred cuvette at 37 °C, and the fluorescence (620/670 nm excitation/emission) was recorded continuously. After reaching steady state fluorescence, different Na+ concentrations were added while the fluorescence was recorded. After a new fluorescent steady state was reached, calibration was performed as indicated above (4Demarco I.A. Espinosa F. Edwards J. Sosnik J. De La Vega-Beltran J.L. Hockensmith J.W. Kopf G.S. Darszon A. Visconti P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7001-7009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The changes in Em elicited by NaCl were quantified taking into consideration the calibration curve and the initial steady state fluorescent before NaCl addition. Intracellular pH and Na+ Measurements in Sperm Populations— [Na+]i and pHi measurements were conducted as described before (4Demarco I.A. Espinosa F. Edwards J. Sosnik J. De La Vega-Beltran J.L. Hockensmith J.W. Kopf G.S. Darszon A. Visconti P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7001-7009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Briefly, sperm (1 × 106 cell/ml) in WH medium were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in 10 μm Sodium Green tetraacetate or 4 μm BCECF-AM, the cell-permeant nonfluorescent precursor of Sodium Green and BCECF, respectively. After incubation, the cells were washed in fresh medium once (400 × g for 5 min) and resuspended, and 1.5 ml of this suspension was placed in a gentle stirring cuvette for fluorescence measurements. Changes in fluorescent were expressed in arbitrary units of fluorescence. When the effects of [Na+]e on pHi or [Na+]i were assayed, sperm were collected, loaded, and washed in Na+-free WH medium. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-PCR Experiments—Total RNA was prepared from isolated mouse elongated spermatids (22Bellve A.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 84-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) using TRIzol reagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was synthesized from total RNA samples by random hexamer-primed reverse transcription (Superscript II RNase H-Reverse Transcriptase; Invitrogen). cDNA was then subjected to PCR amplification using Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The ENaC-α subunit primers were designed using the mouse reported nucleotide sequence for this gene (Scnn1a, NM_011324). Primers for the ENaC-δ subunit were designed using the mouse genomic clone sequence AL670236. Primer sequences are ENaC-α, forward, 5′-AAG CCC AAG GGT GTA GAG T-3′, and reverse, 5′-GAT GAG CCG AAC CAC AGG-3′; ENaC-δ, forward, 5′-CCC AGC CAT AAA CTC-3′, and reverse, 5′-ATC TCC ACC ATC AGC-3′. The absence of genomic contamination in the RNA samples was confirmed with reverse transcription-negative controls (no cDNA) for each experiment (not shown). Amplified products were analyzed by DNA sequencing to confirm their identity. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Mouse sperm membranes were obtained by the method described by Hernández-González et al. (23Hernández-González E.O. Lecona-Valera A.N. Escobar-Herrera J. Mujica A. Cell. Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 46: 43-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The sperm membranes were concentrated by centrifugation (100,000 × g) and resuspended in sample buffer (23Hernández-González E.O. Lecona-Valera A.N. Escobar-Herrera J. Mujica A. Cell. Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 46: 43-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) without 2-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min. After centrifuging, the supernatants were saved, and 2-mercaptoethanol was added to a final concentration of 5% (v/v); the sample was boiled for 5 min, and then subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic transfer of proteins to Immobilon P (Bio-Rad) and immunodetection of ENaC subunits were carried out as previously described (25Kalab P. Visconti P. Leclerc P. Kopf G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3810-3817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblots were developed with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) and an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Indirect Immunofluorescence—Sperm suspensions were fixed in formaldehyde (1.5% final concentration) for 30 min at room temperature, washed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min, permeabilized in PBS-Triton X-100 (0.05% final concentration) for 15 min at room temperature and washed three times with PBS. Specific primary antibodies were added to sperm samples and incubated overnight at 4°C, washed three times with PBS, and then incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody (Biotin-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG) for 1 h at 37°C. The secondary antibody was then subjected to three consecutive washes with PBS and developed by incubation with avidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate diluted in HEPES-saline buffer (20 mm HEPES and 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.2) for 1 h at 37°C. Finally, the samples were washed and mounted in PBS-glycerol (SlowFade, Molecular Probes) and examined using an epifluorescence microscope. Single Cell Fluorescence Analysis of Changes in [Na+]i—Cauda epididymal mouse sperm incubated in WH medium or Na+-free WH medium were loaded with 10 μm Sodium Green tetraacetate for 30 min at 37 °C and immobilized on a poly-l-lysine-coated glass. To withdraw the dye excess, sperm were washed three times with fresh medium. Fluorescence images were collected for 1 s every 10 s using the excitation/emission pair 470/490 nm on an inverted microscope (IX-70 Olympus) through a 40× objective with a digital CCD camera (Hamamatsu C4742–95, MA). The experiments were performed at 37 °C employing a heating chamber regulated on-line with the system acquisition control. Off-line analysis of the collected data were performed using Open Lab (Improvision). At least 30 cells were analyzed in each experiment. Electrophysiology—Spermatogenic cells were obtained following the procedure described by Santi et al. (26Santi C.M. Darszon A. Hernandez-Cruz A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1583-C1593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In ∼3-month-old mice individual meiotic pachytene spermatocytes and spermatids or their symplasts mainly constitute the spermatogenic cell suspension. Recordings were performed only on these symplasts. Na+ currents were recorded according to the whole cell patch clamp technique (27Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15138) Google Scholar). In brief, all of the recordings were done at room temperature using an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments) and 2–4 MOhm micropipettes. The cells were clamped at a holding potential of –50 mV. Currents were evoked by 200-ms voltage steps to test potentials ranging from –100 to +40 mV. The currents were captured on-line and digitized at a sampling rate of 10 kHz following filtering of the current record (5 kHz) using a computer attached to a Digidata 1200 interface (Axon). Pulse protocols, data capture, and analysis of recordings were performed using pCLAMP software (Axon). To isolate Na+ currents, the cells were bathed in a solution containing 130 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaHCO3, 0.5 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4). The internal solution consisted of 110 mm CsMeSO3, 10 mm CsF, 15 mm CsCl, 4.6 mm CaCl2, 10 mm EGTA, HEPES buffer 5 (pH 7.3/CsOH). ENaC channel blockers amiloride and EIPA were prepared as 100 mm stock solutions in Me2SO and diluted in the bath solution for each experiment (Me2SO final concentration < 0.1%). Statistical Analysis—The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. The means were compared using paired Student’s t test, and p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Mouse Sperm Resting Membrane Potential Is Na+-dependent—To investigate whether the Na+ permeability contributes to the resting Em, Na+ in the incubation medium was replaced by nonpermeant cations such as choline+ or N-methyl-d-glucamine+. Sperm were then diluted in WH medium with differing final Na+ concentrations; the sum of the concentrations of either Na+ and choline+ or Na+ and N-methyl-d-glucamine+ were maintained constant in all cases. Reduction of the extracellular Na+ concentration ([Na+]e) in the incubation medium leads to an Em hyperpolarization in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and B). These results indicate that Na+ participates in the regulation of the resting Em in mouse sperm. To directly assay how [Na+]e influences sperm Em, these cells were recovered in Na+-free WH medium, and increasing concentrations of Na+ were added while the Em was recorded continuously as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1, C and D). Under these conditions a Na+ concentration-dependent depolarization was observed, consistent with the hypothesis that electrogenic Na+ uptake occurs in mouse sperm. The Na+-induced Depolarization Is Inhibited by Amiloride and Regulated by pHe—The electrogenic Na+ uptake that seems to occur in noncapacitated mouse sperm could be due to Na+-permeable channels or to the Na+/Ca2+ antiporter. Tetrodotoxin and pyrethroid, which both affect voltage-dependent Na+ channels (28Narahashi T. Mini. Rev. Med. Chem. 2002; 2: 419-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 29Yu F.H. Catterall W.A. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 207.1-7Crossref Scopus (514) Google Scholar), did not alter the Na+-induced depolarizing current when used at 1 and 50 μm, respectively (data not shown). Similarly, a well known inhibitor of Na+/Ca2+ antiporters, KB-R7943 (30Linck B. Qiu Z. He Z. Tong Q. Hilgemann D.W. Philipson K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C415-C423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), at concentrations up to 10 μm, did not inhibit the Na+ permeability (data not shown). Therefore, it is unlikely that voltage-dependent Na+ channels or the Na+/Ca2+ antiporter are responsible for the Na+-induced depolarization in noncapacitated sperm. On the other hand, amiloride and the amiloride analog EIPA inhibited the Na+ depolarizing current in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A and B). Amiloride and EIPA are known to potently inhibit the ENaC family of Na+ channels with IC50 values similar to those obtained for the inhibition of the Na+-induced depolarization (31Inagaki A. Yamaguchi S. Ishikawa T. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C380-C390Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 32Schreiber R. Konig J. Sun J. Markovich D. Kunzelmann K. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 192: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although known Na+/H+ antiporters are not electrogenic (33Aronson P.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1985; 47: 545-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Grinstein S. Rothstein A. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 90: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) and cannot be directly responsible for the Na+-induced depolarization, an intracellular pH (pHi) change could modulate other channels. This possibility was discarded by showing that addition of 20 mm [Na+]e to sperm loaded with a pH-sensitive dye (BCECF) and incubated in Na+-free WH medium did not alter pHi (Fig. 2C, left panel). As expected, the addition of NH4Cl increased pHi (Fig. 2C, right panel). Altogether these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that a member of the ENaC family is present in mature mouse sperm. The activity of ENaC family members is dependent on pHe (35Awayda M.S. Boudreaux M.J. Reger R.L. Hamm L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1896-C1905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Ji H.L. Benos D.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 12529-12534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and thus we investigated the effect of pHe on the Na+-induced depolarizing current. Mouse sperm were incubated for 10 min in Na+-free WH medium buffered at different pH (6.8–7.6), and the Na+-induced depolarization was recorded (Fig. 2, D and E). The observation that the Na+ depolarizing current is significantly activated at low pHe (6.8) is consistent with ENaC being present in sperm. To confirm that the depolarization induced by Na+ is due to Na+ influx, sperm were loaded with Sodium Green, a Na+-specific fluorescent dye. The addition of Na+ resulted in an increase in the concentration of intracellular Na+ ([Na+]i) in the sperm population (Fig. 3, A and B) that could be inhibited by 1 μm EIPA (Fig. 3C). More so, the addition of Li+ did not increase cell fluorescence (Fig. 3D), even though, as shown below, it causes a larger Em depolarization than Na+ (Fig. 4). Furthermore, [Na+]i was examined in individual Sodium Green-loaded sperm suspended in Na+-free WH medium before (Fig. 3E) and after (Fig. 3E′) adding 50 mm NaCl. The relative fluorescence (Rf) was quantified independently in the heads and flagella and expressed as F/F0 (F = fluorescence intensity after Na+ addition, F0 = basal fluorescence intensity). The addition of NaCl increased th"

To further study the regulation, AC was produced fused to the transmembrane segments of the serine chemoreceptor Tsr.

Binding to membranes of either dephospho- or phospho-IIAGlc has no effect on AC activity. However, in the presence of an Escherichia coli extract, P-IIAGlc, but not IIAGlc, stimulates AC activity.

In Escherichia coli, cAMP, produced by adenylyl cyclase (AC), 5The abbreviations used are: AC, adenylyl cyclase; PTS, phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system; EI, the enzyme I phosphocarrier protein of the PTS; IIAGlc, the enzyme IIA component of the glucose-specific PTS; Tsr-AC, the fusion protein containing the two transmembrane segments of Tsr fused to AC; Tsr-ACN, the fusion protein containing the N-terminal region of Tsr fused to the N-terminal region of AC; CRP, the cAMP receptor protein; RF, a factor, as yet uncharacterized, capable of regulating AC activity; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine; CE, crude extract.5The abbreviations used are: AC, adenylyl cyclase; PTS, phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system; EI, the enzyme I phosphocarrier protein of the PTS; IIAGlc, the enzyme IIA component of the glucose-specific PTS; Tsr-AC, the fusion protein containing the two transmembrane segments of Tsr fused to AC; Tsr-ACN, the fusion protein containing the N-terminal region of Tsr fused to the N-terminal region of AC; CRP, the cAMP receptor protein; RF, a factor, as yet uncharacterized, capable of regulating AC activity; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine; CE, crude extract. is an important regulatory molecule, essential for controlling the expression of numerous operons. The cellular levels of cAMP are regulated mainly via effects on AC activity. It has been firmly established that the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) plays an important role in the regulation mechanism. Thus, in wild-type but not in PTS mutant cells, exposure to glucose results in decreased cellular cAMP levels; this decrease accounts for the phenomenon of catabolite repression (1Peterkofsky A. Reizer A. Reizer J. Gollop N. Zhu P. Amin N. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 31-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A popular, but never proven, model for the regulation of AC activity is that the phosphorylated form of IIAGlc of the PTS stimulates AC activity; thus, glucose transport is presumed to lead to dephosphorylation of IIAGlc resulting in a de-activation of AC. It has also been observed that strains of E. coli deficient in the cAMP-binding protein, CRP, produce extraordinarily large amounts of cAMP (2Potter K. Chaloner-Larsson G. Yamazaki H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 57: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This CRP-dependent regulation of cAMP levels depends on the presence of IIAGlc (3Daniel J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 157: 940-941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the CRP-cAMP complex promotes expression of a phosphatase that converts P-IIAGlc to dephospho-IIAGlc (4Takahashi H. Inada T. Postma P. Aiba H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 259: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Consequently, in the absence of CRP, a greater proportion of the pool of IIAGlc is in the phospho-form and the AC is more fully activated. One approach to allow a further understanding of the mechanism by which AC is regulated has involved the use of permeable cells. In this case, exposure of the permeable cells to glucose results in inhibition of AC activity (5Harwood J.P. Peterkofsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4656-4662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this system, it was discovered that Pi is essential for high activity of AC as well as for the capability of the cells to be inhibited by glucose. Because Pi was also shown to stimulate PTS activity in this system, Pi may somehow be involved in the coupling of the interaction of PTS proteins to AC. A number of studies designed to further elucidate the mechanism of regulation of AC have suggested that a simple activation of AC by phospho-IIAGlc is insufficient to account for the regulation mechanism. Liberman et al. (6Liberman E. Saffen D. Roseman S. Peterkofsky A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 1138-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) demonstrated that unphosphorylated IIAGlc resulted in a Pi-dependent inhibition of AC in permeable cells. These data suggested that dephosphorylated IIAGlc can interact with and influence the activity of AC. Reddy et al. (7Reddy P. Meadow N. Roseman S. Peterkofsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8300-8304Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) attempted the reconstitution of the regulatory properties of AC in vitro. Although the partially purified AC or diluted crude extracts showed no effect of added PTS proteins, relatively concentrated extracts showed a variety of effects characteristic of AC activity in permeable cells. These experiments suggested that at least one other uncharacterized factor was required for the effective coupling of PTS proteins to AC. It has been repeatedly speculated elsewhere (8Postma P.W.

C.1996: 1149-1174Google Scholar, 9Saier Jr., M.H. Ramseier T.M. Reizer J. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1325-1343Google Scholar) that other unknown factors could be involved in the regulation of AC activity. In order to further clarify the nature of regulation of AC, a form of AC (Tsr-AC) was engineered in which the enzyme was attached to the membrane. In this way, pull-down experiments might be used to define factors that interact directly with and affect the activity of AC. For the first time, it was possible to show a specific interaction of AC with IIAGlc. The studies reported here demonstrate that Tsr-AC is active, that it interacts with both forms of IIAGlc, and that regulation by P-IIAGlc can be reconstituted only when crude extract is included. These data allow for the formulation of a new model for the regulation of AC activity involving interaction of the regulatory domain of AC with both a regulatory factor and IIAGlc, whereby the state of phosphorylation of IIAGlc determines the level of AC activity.

Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 433Google Scholar) was used for general cloning. Ready-to-Go PCR Beads and Microspin G-25 columns were from Amersham Biosciences. Restriction endonucleases (NdeI, EcoRI, SalI, and BamHI) were purchased from New England Biolabs. Precast SDS-acrylamide gels and molecular weight markers (SeeBlue Plus2) were from Invitrogen. Oligonucleotides for sequencing and PCRs were synthesized by Vicky Guo (NHLBI, National Institutes of Health) using a model 394 DNA/RNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems) or were purchased as high pressure liquid chromatography-purified preparations from Qiagen. Tryptophan was purchased from Invitrogen. Enzyme I (EI), HPr, and IIAGlc were purified as described previously (12Reddy P. Fredd-Kuldell N. Liberman E. Peterkofsky A. Protein Expression Purif. 1991; 2: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). BD Talon His tag purification resin was from BD Biosciences. Transformation of appropriate host cells with plasmids was accomplished by electroporation using an E. coli Pulser (Bio-Rad). Membrane Preparation—Transformants in GI698 cells were cultured in 1 liter of Rich medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) at 30 °C. When the culture reached an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.4, tryptophan (100 μg/ml) was added, and growth was continued overnight. The cells were harvested and resuspended in 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl. The cell suspension was passed twice through a French press at 15,000 p.s.i. The broken cells were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant solution was then centrifuged for 90 min at 40,000 rpm. The pellet was resuspended and washed with 1 m urea in Tris buffer by centrifuging again at 40,000 rpm. The washed pellet was finally resuspended in 1 ml of Tris buffer. The protein concentrations of the membrane preparations were ∼20 mg/ml. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA (bicinchoninic acid) protein assay (Pierce). Calculation of Binding Constants—The interaction of Tsr-AC (126,292 Da) with IIAGlc (18,251 Da) was assumed to be between the monomeric forms of both proteins. As described in the text, various concentrations of IIAGlc were incubated with membranes enriched in either Tsr-AC or Tsr-ACN (control membranes). The samples were processed, using SDS-PAGE, as described in the text (see Fig. 4). Gel scanning was used to quantitate the binding to Tsr-AC and the control membranes as well as the unbound fraction. The specific binding was calculated by subtracting the binding to Tsr-ACN from that bound to Tsr-AC. The formula KD = (IIAGlc unbound or free IIAGlc) × (AC unbound or free Tsr-AC)/(IIAGlc-AC complex) was used to calculate the KD. Adenylyl Cyclase Activity Assay of Membrane Preparations—The assay was modified from a method described previously (5Harwood J.P. Peterkofsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4656-4662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a reaction volume of 50 μl containing Bicine buffer, pH 8.5 (25 mm), MgCl2 (10 mm), ATP (1 mm), dithiothreitol (2 mm), Na2HPO4 (20 mm), and 200 mm NaCl, ∼2.5 μg of membranes were added, and incubation was carried out at room temperature. Samples (25 μl) were withdrawn at the indicated times into 50 μl of 1 n perchloric acid. After centrifugation, the supernatant solutions were assayed for cAMP. cAMP concentrations were determined using the cAMP enzyme immunoassay kit from Amersham Biosciences. pDIA(tsr-cya)—A BamHI fragment from pDIA100 encoding the region around the cya start site was mutagenized to create an NdeI site at the translation initiation codon of cya. This 530-bp fragment was first subcloned into the BamHI site of pBluescript. This clone was used as the template for PCR-based mutagenesis by the method of Higuchi (13Higuchi R. Erlich H.A. PCR Technology: Principles and Applications for DNA Amplification. Stockton Press, New York1989: 61-70Crossref Google Scholar). Two PCRs were carried out using a mixture of mutagenic primer 6134 (5′-GGG TAG CAA ATC AGG CGA TAC CAT ATG TAC CTC TAT ATT GAG ACT CTG-3′) (NdeI site in boldface) and primer 6142, upstream of the BamHI site in pBluescript (5′-AAT TAA CCC TCA CTA AAG GG-3′) in one and a mixture of mutagenic primer 6135 (5′-CAG AGT CTC AAT ATA GAG GTA CAT ATG GTA TCG CCT GAT TTG CTA CCC-3′) and primer 6143, downstream of the BamHI site in pBluescript (5′-GTA AAA CGA CGG CCA GT-3′). The two PCR products were mixed and used as the template for a third PCR using primers 6142 and 6143. The resultant PCR product was digested with BamHI and then recloned into pBluescript digested with BamHI. Plasmid pJFG5, encoding the tsr gene, was used as the template for a PCR designed to clone the fragment encoding residues 1-259 of Tsr with newly created NdeI sites at these residues. The primers 5′-CCA CAG GAA AGA GAA CAT ATG TTA AAA CGT ATC-3′ (NdeI site in boldface; codon for residue 1 underlined) and 5′-CTC TCC CTG CAT ATG GCG CAA ACT-3′ (NdeI site in boldface; codon for residue 259 underlined) were used for the amplification. The product was digested with NdeI and cloned into the NdeI site of the recombinant pBluescript described above. The BamHI fragment of this new construct was moved back into pDIA100 resulting in a derivative of pDIA100 in which an N-terminal fragment of tsr was fused to the beginning of the cya gene. The steps in the construction are schematized in supplemental Fig. 1. pWSK29 Derivatives Encoding cya Genes—In order to obtain low level expression, cya genes were moved into the low copy number vector pWSK29 (14Wang R.F. Kushner S.K. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 100: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). As outlined in supplemental Fig. 1, the EcoRI-SalI fragments encoding the cya gene and its upstream promoter derived from the plasmid pDIA100 or the tsr-cya gene and its upstream promoter from the plasmid pDIA(tsr-cya) were moved into pWSK29 resulting in pLP1663 and pLP1664, respectively. pPR100(tsr-cya)—pPR100 is an expression vector for AC (15Reddy P. Peterkofsky A. McKenney K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10473-10488Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The fragment encoding residues 1-259 of Tsr described above was, after digestion with NdeI, cloned into the NdeI site at the N terminus of the cya gene of pPR100. As shown in supplemental Fig. 2, this expression vector encodes a 130-kDa Tsr-AC fusion protein. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing (16Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). The sequence of cya in our constructs matches that reported for E. coli K12 by Blattner et al. (32Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (5935) Google Scholar) (GenBank™ accession number M87049). pRE1(tsr-cyaN)—The expression vector encoding the N-terminal half of AC was constructed by a PCR using pPR100 (15Reddy P. Peterkofsky A. McKenney K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10473-10488Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) as a template and primer 2753 (upstream of the multiple cloning site of pRE1 (15Reddy P. Peterkofsky A. McKenney K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10473-10488Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); 5′-AAC CAC ACC TAT GGT GTA TGC A-3′) and primer 6403, encoding a double translation stop after Ala-425 (5′-ATA TAT GTC GAC CTA TTA CGC GGC ATA CAG CTT ACG CGT CAG-3′; the underlined region corresponds to a new sequence not found in the cya gene, the italicized regions are the two stop codons, and the boldface region is the new SalI site). The PCR product was digested with NdeI and SalI and cloned into pRE1 digested with the same enzymes. Then the fragment encoding residues 1-259 of Tsr with the newly created NdeI sites at these residues, described above, was cloned in-frame into the NdeI site. This expression vector encodes a Tsr fusion containing the first 425 amino acid residues of AC (Tsr-ACN). pPR100(His Tag)—An expression vector encoding AC with an N-terminal His tag for facile purification of the enzyme was constructed by inserting a linker into the NdeI site of pPR100. The linker encodes the sequence Met-Gly-(Ser)2-(His)6-(Ser)2-Gly-Leu-Val-Pro-Arg-Gly-Ser-His, which resides directly in front of the normal initiator methionine residue. The underlined sequence corresponds to a thrombin cleavage site (cleavage occurs between the Arg and Gly residue). Purification of Soluble AC—GI698/pPR100(His tag) cells were cultured in 1 liter of rich medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) at 30 °C. When the culture reached an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.4, tryptophan (100 μg/ml) was added, and growth was continued overnight. The cells were harvested and resuspended in 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl. The cell suspension was passed twice through a French press at 15,000 p.s.i. The broken cells were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant solution was purified by affinity chromatography using Talon metal affinity resin. After washing out the unbound proteins, the His tag AC was eluted with 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 100 mm imidazole. The eluate was then further purified and desalted by gel filtration chromatography (Superose 12, 1.6 × 50 cm; Amersham Biosciences) in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl. The purified protein was about 1 mg/ml. Crude Extract—The crude extract (CE) was the source of RF. Strain MG1655 or GI698Δpts was grown overnight in 100 ml of LB medium. The culture was centrifuged, and the cells were suspended in 2 ml of 20 mm Tris·HCl, 200 mm NaCl and then disrupted by passage twice through a French press at 10,000 × g. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The protein concentration of CE was ∼25 mg/ml. pDIA(tsr-cya)—As a first step in developing the methodology, it was necessary to determine whether the tethering of AC to the membrane resulted in a protein that was still capable of regulation in the same way that normal AC is regulated. Consequently, the first construct that was created was the fusion of a tsr fragment (encoding the two transmembrane segments of the E. coli serine chemoreceptor) with the cya gene in pDIA100, a pBR322-based vector (see supplemental Fig. 1). In this construct, the expression of the Tsr-AC fusion protein is under the control of the normal cya promoter; the low level expression of the gene in this construct avoids the toxicity associated with high levels of cAMP (17De Robertis Jr., E.M. Judewicz N.D. Torres H.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 55: 758-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 18Ackerman R.S. Cozzarelli N.R. Epstein W. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 357-362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to achieve an even lower level of expression, the fragments encoding both AC and Tsr-AC were recloned into the low copy number plasmid pWSK29 (14Wang R.F. Kushner S.K. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 100: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar) (see supplemental Fig. 1). The plasmids encoding full-length AC (pLP1663) and the Tsr-AC fusion protein (pLP1664) were used to transform strains of E. coli deleted for the genes encoding AC (Δcya) or both AC and CRP (Δcya Δcrp). The transformants, grown at 37 °C in LB medium, all had similar growth curves (data not shown). It has been reported that cAMP levels increase dramatically in Δcrp strains (2Potter K. Chaloner-Larsson G. Yamazaki H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 57: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar); because this increase in cAMP levels requires the presence of IIAGlc (3Daniel J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 157: 940-941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Crasnier M. Danchin A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 1825-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), this phenomenon has been accepted as an indicator of the capability of an AC to be regulated. The data in Fig. 1 demonstrate the capability of AC encoded by the two plasmids to be affected by the absence of CRP. cAMP levels are about 15-fold higher in the Δcrp strain when AC is either made as the normal protein expressed from pLP1663 (Fig. 1, left half) or as the Tsr-AC fusion expressed from pLP1664 (Fig. 1, right half). The actual level of cAMP accumulated in the Tsr-AC fusion strain is lower than that in the strain expressing the normal form of AC. Because Tsr-AC is highly active, as shown in the following studies, this difference in cAMP accumulation probably reflects the limitation in incorporation of the fusion protein into the cytoplasmic membrane. In any event, the important finding is that the Tsr-AC fusion protein is subject to a similar CRP-dependent regulation in vivo as is the normal form of AC. pPR100(tsr-cya)—By having established that tethering of AC to the membrane does not eliminate its capacity to be regulated, the next step in this study was to hyperexpress the tethered enzyme. The construction of the plasmid used for this purpose is described in supplemental Fig. 2. The previously described expression vector, pPR100 (15Reddy P. Peterkofsky A. McKenney K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10473-10488Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which is capable of overexpressing AC under the control of the λ promoter, was used as the starting material for the construct. The N-terminal region, encoding the two transmembrane segments of Tsr, the serine chemoreceptor, was amplified by PCR and then cloned into the NdeI site of pPR100, resulting in pPR100(tsr-cya). This expression vector encodes the Tsr-AC fusion protein (∼1,100 residues long, see supplemental Fig. 2). It has been suggested that AC contains two domains (20Roy A. Danchin A. Joseph E. Ullmann A. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 165: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 21Reddy P. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) as follows: the N-terminal half of the protein contains the catalytic region and the C-terminal half of the protein contains the regulatory region. Consequently, as a control for subsequent studies, a vector hyperexpressing a Tsr-AC fusion containing only the N-terminal half of AC (Tsr-ACN) was also constructed (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 2 demonstrates the expression of the two tethered forms of AC. Transformed cells harboring pRE1 (the control expression vector), pPR100(tsr-cyaN) (the expression vector for tethered ACN), and pPR100(tsr-cya) (the expression vector for tethered full-length AC) were induced for protein expression, and the induced cells were then processed for preparation of membrane vesicles. SDS gel analysis of the whole cells (Fig. 2, lanes 1-3) showed clear bands corresponding to Tsr-ACN (lane 2) and full-length Tsr-AC (lane 3). When membrane preparations from the three induced cells are examined (Fig. 2, lanes 4-6), considerable levels of Tsr-ACN (lane 5) and Tsr-AC (lane 6) are observed. Comparison of the amount of the two expressed proteins relative to that of a reference integral membrane protein (Fig. 2, denoted by heavy arrow) in the whole cell extracts and the membrane preparations suggests essentially complete recovery of the expressed proteins in the membranes. The membrane preparation enriched with the Tsr-AC fusion was compared with control membranes (pRE1) for AC activity (see “Experimental Procedures”). Although there was essentially no detectable activity in the control membranes, the specific activity of AC in the membranes containing Tsr-AC was ∼4 nmol/min/mg of membrane protein. Scanning and quantitation of a gel with Tsr-AC-enriched membranes indicated that the protein corresponding to Tsr-AC accounts for about 10% of the total protein (see Fig. 4, lane 6); using those figures, the specific activity of AC in the membranes is 40 nmol/min/mg of Tsr-AC protein. With different membrane preparations, the AC activity has varied between 20 and 40 nmol/min/mg of AC. It is also noteworthy that the tethered form of AC is stable to storage. The AC activity of a membrane preparation stored at -80 °C for 3 years was unchanged. In contrast, soluble AC tends to aggregate on storage. A critical test of the properties of tethered AC was to determine whether the protein had the capability to interact with its putative regulator IIAGlc. Membranes containing expressed Tsr-AC were compared with control membranes (Tsr-ACN) for interaction with purified IIAGlc (Fig. 3). In one set of reactions, all the components necessary for glucose phosphorylation were included resulting in accumulation of the IIAGlc in the dephospho-form (Fig. 3, reaction mixtures labeled D). In another set of reaction mixtures, P-enolpyruvate but not glucose was included, resulting in accumulation of the IIAGlc in the phospho-form (Fig. 3, reaction mixtures labeled P). After removal of the unbound fraction, the membranes were extracted with urea to release the bound fraction. The data indicate that considerably more of both the dephospho- and phospho-forms of IIAGlc were bound to the Tsr-AC membranes than to the Tsr-ACN membranes. The level of IIAGlc bound to the Tsr-ACN membranes was similar to that bound to the control pRE1 membranes (data not shown). Although higher concentrations of EI and HPr compared with IIAGlc were included in the reaction mixtures, only the binding of IIAGlc, regardless of its phosphorylation state, to Tsr-AC membranes was observed. Furthermore, the band intensities corresponding to IIAGlc in the unbound fraction decreased in reaction mixtures supplemented with Tsr-AC compared with those with Tsr-ACN. These data clearly demonstrate that both phospho- and dephospho-IIAGlc can specifically interact with the C-terminal domain of AC in the absence of other cytoplasmic proteins. Because in wild-type E. coli the cellular concentration of AC is low (less than 20 molecules/cell) (22Yang J.K. Epstein W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3750-3758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that of IIAGlc is substantially higher (∼10-5 m) (23Rohwer J.M. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Westerhoff H.V. Postma P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34909-34921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to assume that the physiological state of AC is as a complex with IIAGlc. The state of phosphorylation of IIAGlc in the complex should reflect that in the cytoplasm. The concentration dependence for interaction of IIAGlc and P-IIAGlc with Tsr-AC-enriched and control (Tsr-ACN-enriched) membranes was studied (Fig. 4). Through the range of 0.5-4 μg of IIAGlc in a 50-60-μl reaction volume, the interaction appeared to be saturable and specific. The calculated KD value for IIAGlc is 6.1 × 10-6 m and that for P-IIAGlc is 8.67 × 10-6 m. The absence of significant specific binding to ACN indicates that the site of interaction of IIAGlc with AC is at the C-terminal half of the protein, consistent with previous suggestions that the C-terminal part of the protein is the regulatory domain (20Roy A. Danchin A. Joseph E. Ullmann A. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 165: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 21Reddy P. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). It is worth pointing out that this binding affinity is in the same range as that reported for other regulatory interactions involving IIAGlc. The KD value for the interaction of IIAGlc with FrsA is 1.8 × 10-7 m (24Koo B.-M. Yoon M.-J. Lee C.R. Nam T.-W. Choe Y.-J. Jaffe H. Peterkofsky A. Seok Y.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31613-31621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), with lactose permease, 1 μm (10Sondej M. Weinglass A.B. Peterkofsky A. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5556-5565Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and with glycerol kinase, 9 μm in the absence of zinc and 0.6 μm in the presence of zinc (25Pettigrew D.W. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Remington S.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4875-4883Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Phosphotransfer interactions involving IIAGlc with HPr (26Wang G. Louis J.M. Sondej M. Seok Y.-J. Peterkofsky A. Clore G.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5635-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) or IIBGlc (27Cai M. Williams D.C. Wang G. Lee B.R. Peterkofsky A. Clore G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25191-25206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) are not as tight. The binding data of Fig. 4 were used to calculate the stoichiometry of the protein-protein interaction (28Ng D.H.W. Watts J.D. Aebersold R. Johnson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1295-1300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); double-reciprocal plot analysis of the total amount of IIAGlc specifically bound (bound to Tsr-AC minus bound to Tsr-ACN) against the total amount of IIAGlc added minus the nonspecifically bound IIAGlc (bound to Tsr-ACN) was carried out. The 1/y intercept is equivalent to the reciprocal of the total amount of IIAGlc bound under saturating conditions. The molar stoichiometry was calculated from the molar amount of Tsr-AC present in the assay and the y intercept. According to this calculation, the stoichiometry was about 0.8 for dephospho- and about 0.9 for phospho-IIAGlc per Tsr-AC, implying a 1:1 interaction. Initial tests of the effect of added IIAGlc in either phosphorylation state indicated that there was no effect on Tsr-AC activity, regardless of the molar ratio of IIAGlc to Tsr-AC added to the reaction mixture (data not shown). These findings suggest that a model for regulation of AC by P-IIAGlc alone is not correct and that there might be another factor(s) regulating activity of the IIAGlc-AC complex, dependent on the phosphorylation state of IIAGlc. Consequently, we embarked on a search for other regulatory factors. As part of this strategy, we tested the effect of adding a crude extract (CE) of E. coli to reaction mixtures for synthesis of cAMP by Tsr-AC or Tsr-ACN membranes (Fig. 5). Addition of ∼500 μg of CE to either type of membrane preparation resulted in about 90% inhibition of AC activity. When we replaced the substrate ATP with cAMP to test its stability under the assay conditions used, we found that the amount of CE used led to ∼90% loss of the added cAMP in the absence of any added membrane preparation. Thus, it is likely that the apparent inhibition of AC activity by CE is because of the action of cAMP phosphodiesterase (29Nielsen L.D. Monard D. Rickenberg H.V. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 116: 857-866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that 500 μg of CE itself did not show detectable AC activity regardless of the addition of either form of IIAGlc, and furthermore, the cAMP hydrolyzing activity of CE was not affected by either form of IIAGlc (data not shown). A further series of experiments were carried out, searching for an additional factor(s) in CE that would promote a response to IIAGlc (see Fig. 6). Incubation mixtures containing Tsr-ACN, Tsr-AC, or partially purified soluble AC, all supplemented with CE, were tested for the effect of added IIAGlc or P-IIAGlc. Although Tsr-ACN was insensitive to the addition of either form of IIAGlc, the other enzyme forms behaved differently. Tsr-AC showed no response to IIAGlc but was stimulated to more than 300% of the control value by P-IIAGlc. A similar P-IIAGlc-specific response was observed with soluble AC; in this case, the stimulation was to ∼250% of the control value. The reasonable interpretation of these findings is that there is a factor(s) in CE that can interact with either the regulatory domain of AC or with IIAGlc (or perhaps both proteins) that results in a stimulation of AC activity when IIAGlc is in the phospho-form (see Fig. 7).FIGURE 7A model for the regulation of AC activity. The two globes represent the two-domain structure of AC; RF corresponds to the uncharacterized regulatory factor present in crude E. coli extracts. It is proposed that the physiological form of AC is composed of a complex including RF and IIAGlc bound to the C-terminal domain of AC. Depending on the metabolic state of the cell, IIAGlc exists in either the dephospho- or phospho-form. As indicated in the diagram, the state of phosphorylation of IIAGlc determines the level of AC activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We considered and eliminated the possibility that that the activation of AC by P-IIAGlc was accompanied by its dephosphorylation. It should be noted that P-IIAGlc migrates slower on the SDS-PAGE than does IIAGlc (see Fig. 3). Because incubation mixtures incubated with P-IIAGlc under the conditions described for Fig. 6 show only that form of the protein recovered from the bound fraction, this system does not result in dephosphorylation of P-IIAGlc. The data presented here allow us to formulate a model for the regulation of AC activity that is consistent with previous observations, including the phenotype of PTS mutants (6Liberman E. Saffen D. Roseman S. Peterkofsky A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 141: 1138-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 8Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Neidhardt F.C.

Microbiol. 1990; 136: 1825-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). The model proposes that the physiological form of AC is a complex of the regulatory C-terminal domain with RF and P-IIAGlc, leading to a high activity form of the enzyme. As indicated in the figure, the IIAGlc-dependent regulation is phosphorylation state-dependent. Thus, a mutant deficient in IIAGlc would be expected to have low AC activity. This study describes a novel approach to the study of AC activity regulation and interaction with IIAGlc. Noteworthy findings are that Tsr-AC is quite active and stable. In whole cells, tethered AC and cytoplasmic AC exhibit similar regulatory properties. Washed membrane preparations devoid of extraneous cytoplasmic factors are able to bind IIAGlc; this is the first demonstration of a direct interaction of IIAGlc with AC. AC activity in isolated membranes is not affected by either phospho- or dephospho-IIAGlc. However, there is a factor(s) in E. coli extracts that interacts with AC, IIAGlc, or the AC-IIAGlc complex; the complex of three proteins (AC, IIAGlc, and RF) renders AC subject to a phosphorylation state-dependent regulation. The results of this study, using tethered AC, provide proof that P-IIAGlc directly interacts with and stimulates AC in vivo. The essential in vivo environment is accomplished by the addition of CE; a factor(s) in CE is essential for the stimulatory effect of P-IIAGlc, and this is in keeping with previous speculations (8Postma P.W.

However, Tat signal peptides are distinctive in possessing an essential twin arginine motif in their N-domains (9Chaddock A.M. Mant A. Karnauchov I. Brink S. Herrmann R.G. Klosgen R.B. Robinson C.

In thylakoids, three membrane protein components are essential for Tat translocation in vivo and in vitro (12Mori H. Summer E.J. Ma X. Cline K. J.

Tha4 and Hcf106 are homologous proteins with similar structure, each containing an amino proximal transmembrane domain followed by a predicted hinge, a stromally exposed amphipathic helix, and a divergent carboxyl tail. cpTatC is a multispanning membrane protein. The bacterial and archaeal orthologs of these components are called TatA, TatB, and TatC, respectively. The thylakoid Tat system operates via a cyclical mechanism (15Cline K. Mori H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 17Mori H. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The precursor protein binds to a 700-kDa cpTatC-Hcf106 receptor complex and then oligomers of Tha4 assemble with the receptor complex in a PMF-dependent manner 3C. Dabney-Smith, H. Mori, and K. Cline (December 30, 2005) J. Biol. Chem. DOI 10.1074/jbc.M512453200. (17Mori H. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), the precursor is translocated, and Tha4 dissociates, thereby resetting the system. The bacterial Tat system is also thought to operate by a cyclical mechanism. Although the thylakoid and bacterial systems appear similar, there are some notable differences with respect to the behavior of Tha4 (TatA). For example, whereas the cpTatC-Hcf106 complex is associated with Tha4 only transiently during protein transport, the isolated Escherichia coli TatC-TatB complex contains variable amounts of TatA (18Bolhuis A. Mathers J.E. Thomas J.D. Barrett C.M. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20213-20219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The highly regulated association of Tha4 with the receptor complex is mediated by a transmembrane glutamate residue that is conserved among all Tha4 proteins but absent from bacterial TatA proteins (3Mori H. Cline K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1541: 80-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A second difference concerns the interaction with precursors. Thylakoid-bound precursors have been chemically cross-linked to cpTatC and to Hcf106, but not to Tha4 (15Cline K. Mori H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). By contrast, bacterial Tat precursors have been shown to directly interact with TatA in Bacillus subtilis (19Dilks K. Rose R.W. Hartmann E. Pohlschroder M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1478-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and E. coli (20Alami M. Luke I. Deitermann S. Eisner G. Koch H.G. Brunner J. Muller M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 937-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). It is not currently clear whether these differences reflect significantly diverse mechanisms between thylakoid and bacterial systems or only minor adaptations to the dissimilar cellular environments in which they operate. Insight into the mechanism of the E. coli Tat system comes from a recent elegant study of the interactions between the preSufI precursor and the Tat machinery using a translationally inserted photoactive cross-linker. Alami et al. (20Alami M. Luke I. Deitermann S. Eisner G. Koch H.G. Brunner J. Muller M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 937-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) found that certain residues of the signal peptide could be cross-linked to TatC, TatB, or TatA. Importantly, all three components interacted near the “RR” consensus, suggesting that only one component can occupy the signal peptide at a time. Moreover, the specific conditions under which precursor could be cross-linked to each component suggested a “hand-off” mechanism in which the signal peptide is initially bound by TatC, then handed off to TatB, and, in the presence of a PMF, is transferred to TatA for the translocation step (1Muller M. Klosgen R.B. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 20Alami M. Luke I. Deitermann S. Eisner G. Koch H.G. Brunner J. Muller M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 937-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). TatA (Tha4) is proposed in some models to form the protein-conducting channel (2Berks B.C. Sargent F. Palmer T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 260-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 21Gohlke U. Pullan L. McDevitt C.A. Porcelli I. de Leeuw E. Palmer T. Saibil H.R. Berks B.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10482-10486Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 22Berks B.C. Palmer T. Sargent F. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2003; 47: 187-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To determine whether this pattern of interactions is a general feature of Tat systems, we used a similar approach with the thylakoid system. The photoactive cross-linker Tmd(Phe) was introduced into positions within and proximal to the targeting signal peptide of the precursor tOE17, which was then productively bound to thylakoids and photo-cross-linked to Tat components. Our results were generally similar to the results with the E. coli Tat system but with important differences. The pattern of interactions showed that cpTatC and Hcf106 interact with distinct regions of the signal peptide, raising the possibility that these two components can simultaneously bind to the same precursor protein. Cross-links between precursor and Tha4 were not observed, even when the membranes were energized for translocation. As an alternative test of the hand-off mechanism for thylakoids, we asked whether it is necessary for the signal peptide to be passed from cpTatC or Hcf106 in order for the precursor to be translocated. Precursors cross-linked to cpTatC were efficiently transported across the thylakoid membrane. These results will be discussed in the context of current models for the mechanism of Tat pathway transport. Plasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—DNA clones for the various precursors used in this study were constructed by PCR mutagenesis with the QuikChange mutagenesis kit from Stratagene and the clone for tOE17 (11Henry R. Carrigan M. McCaffrey M. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) as template. DNA sequencing on both strands at the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research DNA Sequencing Core Facility verified all constructs. The clone for tOE17M was prepared by replacing the TAG stop codon at the end of the tOE17 DNA sequence with an ATG codon. This allowed translation to continue to the next stop codon in the vector sequence, which added the amino acids MTQGLIMAM. tOE17M clones used for (Tmd)Phe translational incorporation were constructed by replacing the codons for amino acid residues shown in Fig. 1 with TAG. Preparation of Radiolabeled Precursors—Capped mRNA was transcribed in vitro with SP6 polymerase (Promega) and was translated in the presence of [35S]methionine with a homemade wheat germ translation system (23Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14804-14810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). N-Pentenoyl-(Tmd)Phe-tRNACUA, the protected form of the suppressor (Tmd)Phe-tRNACUA, was purchased from Botanica PhotoProbes and prepared following the manufacturer's instructions. 1 μl of the (Tmd)Phe-tRNACUA (0.1 A260/μl) was added per 25 μl of translation reaction. Preparation of Chloroplasts, Thylakoids, and Lysate—Intact chloroplasts were isolated from 9- to 10-day-old pea seedlings as described by Cline et al. (24Cline K. Henry R. Li C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Chloroplast pellets were lysed at 2 mg of chlorophyll/ml in 10 mm HEPES, KOH, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2 at 0 °C for 10 min and adjusted to import buffer (IB; 50 mm HEPES, KOH, pH 8.0, 0.33 m sorbitol), 10 mm MgCl2. Thylakoids were obtained from lysates by centrifugation (3,300 × g) for 8 min. Stromal extract was obtained from the supernatant by further centrifugation (100,000 × g) for 20 min to remove envelope membranes. Thylakoids were washed with IB and resuspended in IB to 1 or 2 mg of chlorophyll/ml before use. Chlorophyll concentrations were determined according to Arnon (25Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thylakoid Protein Binding, Chase, and Transport Assay—Precursor binding assays were conducted as described (26Ma X. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10016-10022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Basically, [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translation products were incubated with apyrase for 10 min at 0 °C and then with an equivalent volume of washed thylakoid membranes for 15 min in darkness at 0 °C. Thylakoid membranes were then recovered by centrifugation, washed twice with IB, and analyzed directly (binding) or further incubated for transport from the bound state (chase) by resuspension with a stoichiometric quantity of stromal extract, 5 mm Mg-ATP, and 2 mm dithiothreitol and incubation for 15 min at 25°C in ∼50 microeinsteins/m2/s white light. Thylakoid membranes were recovered by centrifugation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. For transport assays, in vitro translation products were incubated with an equivalent volume of chloroplast lysate (1 mg of chlorophyll/ml) for 15 min at 25 °C in the light. Recovered thylakoid membranes were further treated with thermolysin to remove nontransported precursor proteins (24Cline K. Henry R. Li C. Yuan J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4105-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Bound Precursor Extraction Assays—Precursor-bound thylakoid membranes (15 μg of chlorophyll) were resuspended in 30 μl of the extraction solution (prepared in 10 mm HEPES, KOH, pH 8.0, just prior to use) and incubated at 0 °C for 10 min. Samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 2 min at 2 °C. Pellets and supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Radiolabeled proteins were quantified by scintillation counting of bands extracted from dried gels as described (23Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14804-14810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linking of (Tmd)Phe-labeled Precursors—Thylakoid membranes recovered from binding assays or binding reaction mixtures at 0.5 mg of chlorophyll/ml were illuminated at 0 °C for 5 min with a 120-watt Spectroline model SB-100P ultraviolet lamp (365 nm). Samples (10 μl in 1.5-ml microfuge tubes) were placed at 10 cm from the light bulb. Immunoprecipitation—Samples were diluted 1:2 with TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), 2% SDS, 1 mm EDTA and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. 20–40 μl of denatured samples were transferred to a low retention microfuge tube containing 0.5 ml of IP buffer (TBS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA) and 40 μl of 25% slurry IgGs beads and were incubated overnight with end-over-end mixing at 4 °C. Pellets were recovered and washed three times with 1 ml of IP buffer, one time with 1 ml of TBS, 0.05% Triton X-100, and finally transferred into Wizard (Promega) minicolumns. Elution was performed by incubating beads with 20 μl of 8 m urea, 5% SDS, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, for 2 h at 37°C. The eluate received 1 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol and was further incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The unbound supernatant of the initial incubation was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the proteins were resuspended in 20 μl of elution buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Experimental Approach—The precursor to the 17-kDa subunit of the oxygen-evolving complex OE17 was used in this study. All experiments were conducted with a modified version of the natural precursor called tOE17, which lacks several non-essential N-domain residues; this precursor is used in many of our studies because of its superior binding and transport properties (26Ma X. Cline K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10016-10022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). tOE17 binds productively to thylakoids in the absence of the PMF and is transported to the lumen when the PMF is restored. In general, 80–90% of bound precursor is productive. The tOE17 used for the present work was further modified with additional amino acids on the carboxyl terminus to incorporate methionine residues for [35S]methionine labeling (see “Experimental Procedures”). This alteration did not affect the transport (see supplemental Fig. S1) or the binding properties of the resulting precursor (see below). To generate specific 1:1 cross-links between precursor and components, the UV-activated amino acid analog (Tmd)Phe was translationally substituted for residues in various locations within and near the signal peptide of tOE17M (Fig. 1A). The positions Ala–25, Gly–24, and Ala–21 through Gly–18 were chosen to bracket the RR motif. Residues Ala–21 through Gly–18 are also part of the early hydrophobic region. Substitutions in Gly–10 to Leu–7 cover the end of the hydrophobic region (Fig. 1A), and substitutions in Val+3, Gly+17, and Phe+30 are representative of the early mature sequence of OE17 (Fig. 1A). All substituted precursors were assayed for protein transport with isolated thylakoids. With the exception of the Gly–24 substitution, all were indistinguishable from tOE17M in this assay (data not shown, see supplemental Fig. S1). Gly–24, which places the bulky (Tmd)Phe group next to the RR, was severely impaired in both transport and binding assays and was not analyzed further. Some Tmd(Phe) Substitutions in the Signal Peptide Enhance the Binding Properties of tOE17—Although not significantly different in transport assays, substituted precursors showed variation in thylakoid binding assays. Precursors with (Tmd)Phe at positions Ala–25, (Fig. 1C, lane 2), Ala–21, Ile–19 (Fig. 1D, lanes 2 and 8, respectively), and Ala–8 (Fig. 1E, lane 8) had a reduced ability to stably bind to thylakoids. By contrast, precursors with (Tmd)Phe at the remaining positions bound strongly to thylakoids (Fig. 1, B and D–F, lanes designated “b”). To determine whether such binding reflected productive interaction, thylakoid-bound precursors were subjected to a chase assay, wherein conditions for protein translocation were re-established. All bound precursors were efficiently transported from the bound state (Fig. 1, B–F, lanes designated “c”). tOE17M precursors with Tmd(Phe) substitutions were also examined for association with the cpTatC-Hcf106 receptor complex by BN-PAGE and fluorography (Fig. 2A). Previous work showed that bound precursors are recovered with the ∼700-kDa receptor complex when the precursor-bound thylakoids are dissolved with digitonin and subjected to BN-PAGE (15Cline K. Mori H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). All precursors analyzed could be detected at ∼700 kDa. However tOE17M with substitutions in positions Val–20, Gly–18, Gly–10, Gly–9, Leu–7 produced dramatically more precursor-receptor complex on BN-PAGE (Fig. 2A, lanes 5, 9, 13, 15, 19, respectively, compared with tOE17M lanes 1, 11; supplemental Fig. S2). The binding reactions used for the above analyses were conducted with thylakoids in the absence of the PMF. We have recently found that precursors bind more tightly to membranes energized with the PMF and that this binding is characterized by greater stability of the precursor-receptor complex on BN-PAGE, similar to that observed for tOE17M Val–20, Gly–18, Gly–10, Gly–9, Leu–7 and also by increased resistance to extraction with salt or urea solutions alone. 4F. Gérard, X. Ma, and K. Cline, manuscript in preparation. The relevant Tmd(Phe)-containing precursors also appear more resistant to extraction. Thylakoid-bound tOE17M with a Tmd(Phe) substitution of Val–20 required both salt and urea to release it from the membrane (Fig. 2B, upper panel). This differs from unsubstituted tOE17 bound to membranes in the absence of the PMF, which is largely extracted by 0.25 m KCl (Fig. 2B, lower panel). These results suggest that binding of tOE17M with certain Tmd(Phe) substitutions in the hydrophobic core region mimics the more advanced stage of binding that normally precedes protein translocation. The underlying physical basis for this tighter binding is not known; however, we note that the previously studied recombinant precursors DT17 and DT23, with a slightly higher hydrophobicity in their H-domain, exhibit the same behavior (15Cline K. Mori H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). 5F. Gérard and K. Cline, unpublished data. The Twin Arginine Region of the Signal Peptide Contacts cpTatC and the Hydrophobic Core Contacts Hcf106—For cross-linking analysis, precursor-bound thylakoids were subjected to UV irradiation for 5 min at 0 °C. Six of the nine precursors substituted in the signal peptide, Ala–25, Ala–21, Val–20, Gly–18, Gly–10, and Gly–9, gave ∼52-kDa cross-link products (Fig. 3, even lanes). (Tmd)Phe in position Val–20 gave undoubtedly the most abundant product (Fig. 3B, lane 6). (Tmd)Phe in position Gly–18 yielded a doublet at ∼52 kDa (Fig. 3B, lane 10). Of the (Tmd)Phe substitutions in the OE17 mature domain, only Val+3 produced a faint cross-link product, at ∼52 kDa (Fig. 3D, lane 2). Based simply on size, the ∼52-kDa cross-link product could represent an association between the precursor (∼20 kDa) and either Hcf106 or cpTatC, as both proteins migrate on SDS-PAGE with a molecular mass of ∼30 kDa (27Mori H. Summer E.J. Cline K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 501: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Notably, cross-link products were absent from the ∼35-kDa region of the gel, the location of a presumptive tOE17-Tha4 cross-link product. Of interest is that with the exception of Leu–7, precursors showing greater complex stability on BN-PAGE (Fig. 2A) also produced cross-link products with cpTat components. Cross-link partners were determined by co-immunoprecipitation of SDS-denatured cross-link reactions. Cross-link products from precursors with substitutions proximal to the twin arginine, i.e. Ala–25, Ala–21, Val–20, were immunoprecipitated solely by antibodies to cpTatC (see Fig. 4A, lane 6, for a representative experiment and supplemental Fig. S3 for co-immunoprecipitation of cross-link products directed by other residues). Cross-link products from precursors with substitutions Gly–10, Gly–9, and Val+3 were immunoprecipitated solely by antibodies to Hcf106 (see Fig. 4C, lane 4, for a representative co-immunoprecipitation and supplemental Fig. S3 for co-immunoprecipitation of cross-link products directed by other residues). The slower migrating cross-link product from the substitution in Gly–18 was immunoprecipitated with antibodies to cpTatC (Fig. 4B, lane 6), whereas the faster migrating cross-link product from Gly–18 was immunoprecipitated with antibodies to Hcf106 (Fig. 4B, lane 4). No cross-link product was immunoprecipitated by antibodies to Tha4 (Fig. 4, A–C, lanes 2; supplemental Fig. S3) nor were any cross-link products immunoprecipitated by antibodies to Alb3 (Fig. 4, A–C, lanes 8). Alb3 serves as a negative control for this experiment because Alb3 functions on a different thylakoid translocation pathway, the cpSRP pathway (28Moore M. Harrison M.S. Peterson E.C. Henry R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1529-1532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that the region next to the RR motif interacts strongly with cpTatC and that the hydrophobic domain from position Gly–18 up to and including the signal peptidase cleavage site interacts with Hcf106 (see Fig. 4D). The Twin Arginine Motif of the Signal Peptide Is Essential for Interaction with cpTatC and Hcf106—The twin arginine motif RR is a key specificity element for interactions between the precursor and the cpTat machinery (9Chaddock A.M. Mant A. Karnauchov I. Brink S. Herrmann R.G. Klosgen R.B. Robinson C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2715-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 10Bogsch E. Brink S. Robinson C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3851-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 11Henry R. Carrigan M. McCaffrey M. Ma X. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 15Cline K. Mori H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 17Mori H. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). On the other hand, weak interactions have been reported between twin lysine KK precursors and the thylakoid Tat machinery (29Alder N.N. Theg S.M. Cell. 2003; 112: 231-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 30Alder N.N. Theg S.M. FEBS Lett. 2003; 540: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and Alami et al. (20Alami M. Luke I. Deitermann S. Eisner G. Koch H.G. Brunner J. Muller M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 937-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) detected a cross-link product between a KK precursor and E. coli TatB. To determine whether the RR motif is necessary for the interactions described above, the RR motif was substituted by KK in the precursors in which (Tmd)-Phe replaced Val–20 (kkV –20), Gly–10 (kkG–10), and Gly–9 (kkG–9). As expected from previous work, the KK substrates bound poorly to thylakoid membranes compared with the RR-containing precursors (Fig. 5A, lanes 5 compared with lanes 2). The KK precursors were neither transported directly (data not shown) nor chased from the bound state (Fig. 5A, lanes 6 compared with lanes 3). Because KK precursors do not stably bind to thylakoids, potential interactions with cpTat components were assayed by directly UV irradiating the binding reaction mixture, i.e. before recovering and washing the membranes. Fig. 5B shows the results of such an assay. None of the KK precursors exhibited cross-link products (lanes 4, 8, and 12). These observations indicate that precursors with KK substituted for RR do not interact in a measurable way with the thylakoid Tat receptor complex. Precursor Cross-linked to cpTatC Can Still Be Transported across the Membrane—The pattern of interactions between tOE17M and the thylakoid Tat components bears some similarities to that reported between preSufI and E. coli Tat components (20Alami M. Luke I. Deitermann S. Eisner G. Koch H.G. Brunner J. Muller M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 937-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). One important difference is that Alami et al. (20Alami M. Luke I. Deitermann S. Eisner G. Koch H.G. Brunner J. Muller M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 937-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) also detected interactions between precursor and TatA. TatA interacted with the same signal peptide region as TatC, but cross-links to TatA were only observed in the presence of the PMF. This suggested that the signal peptide is transferred to TatA for the translocation step (20Alami M. Luke I. Deitermann S. Eisner G. Koch H.G. Brunner J. Muller M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 937-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In our experiments, cross-links between the signal peptide and Tha4 were not observed, even when activation of the cross-link agent was initiated at varying times following the start of a chase reaction (data not shown). An alternative way of addressing this issue is to ask whether the signal peptide must be transferred from cpTatC or Hcf106 for translocation to occur. In the experiment shown in Fig. 6, precursor was cross-linked to Hcf106 or cpTatC, and the resulting membranes were subjected to a chase reaction. Because the [35S]methionine label is located at the extreme carboxyl terminus of the precursor and the cross-link occurs via the amino-terminal signal peptide, there are two possible outcomes if translocation occurs. If translocation were accompanied by processing by the thylakoid signal peptidase, the cross-link product would disappear, as radiolabel would be separated from the cross-linked region. If processing were not to occur, the cross-link product would acquire protection from exogenously added protease by virtue of being present on the other side of the membrane. Precursors cross-linked to Hcf106 via substitution of Gly–10 failed to exhibit either characteristic of transport following a chase reaction (data not shown). By contrast, precursor cross-linked to cpTatC via substitution of Val–20 became largely resistant to thermolysin following a chase reaction, producing a protected product of ∼40 kDa (Fig. 6A, lanes 3 and 4). If the chase reaction were conducted in the presence of ionophores that dissipate the PMF and prevent translocation, both cross-linked and non-cross-linked tOE17 precursors were fully sensitive to thermolysin (lanes 5, 6). The drop of ∼10 kDa in the size of the protected cross-link product is likely due to proteolysis of the amino terminus of cpTatC. Thermolysin treatment of thylakoids destroys the stromally exposed amino terminus of cpTatC, producing an ∼23-kDa multispanning membrane domain (27Mori H. Summer E.J. Cline K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 501: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The drop in molecular mass of the cross-link product is not due to proteolysis of the tOE17 adduct because, as mentioned above, the precursor must remain intact in order to be distinguishable in this analysis. This result indicates that tOE17M cross-linked to cpTatC is sufficiently transported across the thylakoids to become resistant to added protease. In addition, by being linked to cpTatC, the processing site is masked from the thylakoid signal peptidase. Comparison with the binding and chase of non-cross-linked precursor in the same reactions shows that the cross-link product was transported with efficiency comparable with tOE17M (Fig. 6A, lanes 2–4). This result suggests that even when the precursor is covalently bound to cpTatC by the twin arginine region, this interaction does not measurably interfere with transport of the mature domain. Interactions detected between the tOE17M precursor protein and thylakoid Tat components were similar in two aspects to those between the preSufI precursor and E. coli Tat components (20Alami M. Luke I. Deitermann S. Eisner G. Koch H.G. Brunner J. Muller M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 937-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) using the same (Tmd)Phe photo-cross-link approach. First, residues near the consensus twin arginine motif interacted strongly with cpTatC (TatC ortholog); specifically, the strongest cross-link product with cpTatC was from the same position relative to RR as the preSufI residue that cross-linked to TatC. We have also analyzed the cross-link behavior of DT17, a recombinant precursor protein that binds very tightly to the cpTat apparatus (15Cline K. Mori H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), and found that the comparable RR-proximal residue strongly cross-linked to cpTatC.5 This verifies the conclusion of Alami et al. (20Alami M. Luke I. Deitermann S. Eisner G. Koch H.G. Brunner J. Muller M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 937-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) that TatC (cpTatC) is the primary recognition component for the consensus RR motif. A second similarity is that tOE17 signal peptide H- and C-domains interacted with Hcf106 (TatB). Our results also differ from Alami et al. (20Alami M. Luke I. Deitermann S. Eisner G. Koch H.G. Brunner J. Muller M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 937-946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). We found that cpTatC and Hcf106 interact primarily with different parts of the signal peptide. Only the weakly interacting Gly–18 cross-linked with both cpTatC and Hcf106. This raises the possibility that the precursor can simultaneously occupy binding sites of cpTatC and Hcf106. Another important difference is that we did not detect any interactions with Tha4 (TatA ortholog). The transient nature of Tha4 association with the translocase (17Mori H. Cline K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) might explain the absence of Tha4 cross-linking products. However, the efficient transport of tOE17M cross-linked to cpTatC (Fig. 6) argues that the tOE17M signal peptide does not need to entirely move from cpTatC to other components for the substrate protein to be translocated. cpTatC (TatC) has been suggested to provide the driving force for Tat protein translocation (31Bruser T. Sanders C. Microbiol. Res. 2003; 158: 7-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and our results are consistent with that suggestion. Our results do not exclude the possibility that Tha4 interacts with the signal peptide at some stage of the process. For example, Tha4 might displace Hcf106 from its signal peptide binding site without displacing cpTatC. In addition, our results do not rule out a role for Tha4 as the protein-conducting channel. Rather, they simply suggest that the channel is attached to or includes cpTatC. We thank Mike McCaffery, Carole Dabney-Smith, and Jon Martin for critical review of the manuscript.

Five of these cluster sites are within 3-5 Å of 10 glucose transporter deficiency syndrome missense mutations. Another three sites are within 8 Å of two other missense mutations. d-Glucose binds to five sites in the external channel opening, with increasing affinity toward the pore center and then passes via a narrow channel into an internal vestibule containing four lower affinity sites. An external site, not adjacent to any mutation, also binding phloretin but recognizing neither d-fructose nor l-glucose, may be the main threading site for glucose uptake. Glucose exit from human erythrocytes is inhibited by quercetin (Ki = 2.4 μm) but not anionic quercetin-semiquinone. Quercetin influx is retarded by extracellular d-glucose (50 mm) but not by phloretin and accelerated by intracellular d-glucose. Quercetin docking sites are absent from the external opening but fill the entire pore center. In the inner vestibule, Glu254 and Lys256 hydrogen-bond quercetin (Ki ≈ 10 μm) but not quercetin-semiquinone. Consistent with the kinetics, this site also binds d-glucose, so quercetin displacement by glucose could accelerate quercetin influx, whereas quercetin binding here will competitively inhibit glucose efflux. β-d-Hexoses dock twice as frequently as their α-anomers to the 23 aromatic residues in the transport pathway, suggesting that endocyclic hexose hydrogens, as with maltosaccharides in maltoporins, form π-bonds with aromatic rings and slide between sites instead of being translocated via a single alternating site.

The glucose uniporter GLUT1 (SLC2A1), a member of the major facilitator superfamily of solute transporters, has to date not been crystallized, but its three-dimensional structure has been modeled by templating it to that of Lac Y permease and glycerol 3-phosphate antiporter (GlpT) from Escherichia coli (1Abramson J.

The 12 transmembrane α-helical domains of the monomeric GLUT protein are arranged around a central water-filled pore lined predominantly with uncharged hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids. The 15-Å-long, 8-Å-wide channel narrows near its midpoint (1Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Iwata S. Kaback H.R.

Molecular dynamic simulations show that glucose binds close to this position within the pore, as expected of lactose binding to Lac Y permease (2Hirai T. Heymann J.A. Shi D. Sarker R. Maloney P.C. Subramaniam S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 597-600PubMed Google Scholar). Glucose docks additionally in a cavity at the external entrance of the pore (3Salas-Burgos A. Iserovich P. Zuniga F.

GLUTs transport other substrates besides hexoses (e.g. dehydroascorbate (4Vera J.C Rivas C.I. Fischbarg J. Golde D.W. Nature. 2000; 364: 79-82Crossref Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 5Rumsey S.C.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 524: 199-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) via GLUT2). The flavonone, quercetin, is transported via GLUT4. Quercetin influx into GLUT4 is inhibited by high glucose or cytochalasin B concentrations (7Strobel P. Allard C. Perez-Acle T. Calderon R. Aldunate R. Leighton F. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Conversely, quercetin inhibits glucose and ascorbate transport via GLUT1, -2, -3, and -4 (8Park J.B. Levine M. J.

Pharmacol. 2003; 140: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This present study demonstrates that quercetin is also transported via GLUT1, and its uptake is accelerated by exchange with intracellular glucose. Our goal here is to deduce the transport mechanism of glucose and quercetin by correlating their transport with their binding properties determined using the molecular recognition program AUTODOCK 3 (11Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9045) Google Scholar). The conventional view of passive facilitated sugar transport is that sugar binds at a single centrally located site in GLUT that isomerizes between inward and outward facing conformations. The altered direction of ligand dissociation from the site mediates transport (12Barrett M.P. Walmsley A.R. Gould G.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 496-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Carruthers A. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 1135-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 14Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Iwata S. Kaback H.R. FEBS Lett. 2003; 555: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 15Lowe A.G. Walmsley A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 857: 146-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To explain accelerated exchange, where the maximal rate of glucose exchange with an intracellular ligand is faster than net flux, the glucose-loaded carrier must isomerize faster than the unliganded carrier. Glucose transport asymmetry is evident as a lower maximal rate and Km for net uptake than for exit. Asymmetric transport by the mobile carrier requires that isomerization rates of the unloaded carrier are also asymmetric (16Baker G.F. Widdas W.F. J. Physiol. 1973; 231: 143-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 17Geck P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 241: 462-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These assumptions require that all ligands should have the same maximal transport rate, since this is determined by the slow return rate of the unloaded carrier to complete the net transport cycle (18LeFevre P.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1962; 203: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, differences have been observed between maximal rates of net influx of different sugars and their temperature coefficients or activation energies (19Naftalin R.J. Rist R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1191: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 20Cloherty E.K. Heard K.S. Carruthers A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10411-10421Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Naftalin R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1328: 13-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Another explanation for sugar transport asymmetry is that glucose accumulates in an endofacial compartment or vestibule. This promotes futile transport cycling, or recycling, that both lowers the maximal net influx rate and reduces the apparent Km for net glucose uptake (22Baker G.F. Naftalin R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 550: 474-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 23Levine K.B Cloherty E.K Fidyk N.J. Carruthers A.

A high glucose concentration binding in the vestibule widens the vestibular exit to the cytosol, whereas ATP binding restricts it, thereby altering glucose mobility between the vestibule and cytoplasmic compartment. Kinetic evidence in support of an ATP and glucose-modulated endofacial vestibular compartment (25Blodgett D.M. Carruthers A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2650-2660Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) is corroborated by the three-dimensional structure of GLUT1 (3Salas-Burgos A. Iserovich P. Zuniga F. Vera J.C. Fischbarg J. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 2990-2999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). An alternative model for glucose transport is that hexoses diffuse between recognition sites in the transport pathway independently of protein conformational changes. This multisite model accounts for saturation and inhibition kinetics and relaxes the requirement for uniform maximal rates of hexose transport (26Naftalin R.J. Afzal I. Browning J.A. Wilkins R.J. Ellory J.C. J. Membr. Biol. 2002; 186: 113-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Attention has been drawn to the structural similarity between GLUT1 and maltoporins (3Salas-Burgos A. Iserovich P. Zuniga F. Vera J.C. Fischbarg J. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 2990-2999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Large numbers of aromatic amino acids line the “greasy pore” of maltoporin and the central pore of the GLUT1. Maltosaccharides are guided through maltoporin by slippage between hydrophobic axial hydrogen atoms projecting from the planar surface of the glycosidic ring and π-electrons of aromatic amino acid side chains in one of the maltoporin strands lining the pore. Hydrogen bonds between OH or endocyclic oxygen groups on both sides of the pyranose ring and hydrophilic porin tracks constitute the other two support rails required to guide the maltosaccharide train through the porin (27Dutzler R. Schirmer T. Karplus M. Fischer S. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 1273-1284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 28Van Gelder P. Dumas F. Bartoldus I Saint N. Prilipov A. Winterhalter M. Wang Y. Philippsen A. Rosenbusch J.P. Schirmer T. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 2994-2999Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Docking and sequence comparisons here reveal that glucose transport across GLUT1 resembles sugar transport across maltoporin in that multiple docking sites provide the nodal points in a network spanning the pore length. The homologies between maltoporin and GLUT1 sequences (29Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 852: 444-2448Google Scholar) may exemplify the phenotypic convergence required of any structure that facilitates slippage of pyranose ligands through a narrow orifice rather than an ontological relationship. GLUT1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT1-DS) 3The abbreviations used are: GLUT1-DS, GLUT1 deficiency syndrome; TM, transmembrane. 3The abbreviations used are: GLUT1-DS, GLUT1 deficiency syndrome; TM, transmembrane. is caused by an inadequate energy supply to brain with failure of growth and development of the central nervous system resulting from diminished glucose transport across the blood brain barrier via defective endothelial GLUT1. The children affected tend to develop microcephaly, epileptic seizures, and ataxia. The major biochemical signs of GLUT1-DS are low cerebrospinal fluid glucose and lactate concentrations typically accompanied by low rates of glucose transport in the subjects' erythrocytes as a result of defective GLUT1 present in these cells (30Wang D. Pascual J.M. Yang H. Engelstad K. Jhung S. Sun R.P. De Vivo D.C. Ann. Neurol. 2005; 57: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 31Klepper J. Salas-Burgos A. Gertsen E. Fischbarg J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12621-12626Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Early introduction of a ketogenic diet may ameliorate this condition by supplying the brain with an alternative energy source. Sixteen missense mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions at 12 sites have been observed in 6 of the 10 exons of GLUT1 (30Wang D. Pascual J.M. Yang H. Engelstad K. Jhung S. Sun R.P. De Vivo D.C. Ann. Neurol. 2005; 57: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 31Klepper J. Salas-Burgos A. Gertsen E. Fischbarg J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12621-12626Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). When mapped on the three-dimensional GLUT1 structure, these mutations are close to all but one of the hexose docking sites revealed by AUTODOCK 3. In this paper, it is shown that one of the glucose binding sites in the inner vestibule of GLUT1 that also binds uncharged quercetin is negatively charged. Docking studies reveal that this site is likely to involve Glu254 and Lys256 that hydrogen-bond to quercetin and glucose. The site is situated appropriately to allow for both retardation of net glucose and quercetin transport, so that displacement of quercetin from it by intracellular glucose explains the observed acceleration of quercetin influx. This new model of transport via GLUT1 built on previous transport, structural, and modeling studies (1Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Iwata S. Kaback H.R.

It offers an explanation for the widely dispersed mutation sites affecting GLUT1-DS (30Wang D. Pascual J.M. Yang H. Engelstad K. Jhung S. Sun R.P. De Vivo D.C. Ann. Neurol. 2005; 57: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 31Klepper J. Salas-Burgos A. Gertsen E. Fischbarg J.

Fresh human erythrocytes obtained by venepuncture from a healthy donor after informed consent and approval by the King's College London Research Ethics Committee, were washed three times in isotonic saline by repeated centrifugation and resuspension. Materials—Phosphate-buffered saline tablets, d-glucose, quercetin, phloretin, ascorbate, ferricyanide, and HgCl2 were all purchased from Sigma. Stopping solution consisted of phosphate-buffered saline with 10 μm HgCl2 at 4 °C (19Naftalin R.J. Rist R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1191: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Measuring Glucose Efflux by Photometry—Glucose efflux from human erythrocytes preloaded with 100 mm glucose at 24 °C was measured photometrically, as previously described (10Naftalin R.J. Afzal I. Cunningham P. Halai M. Ross C Salleh N. Milligan S.R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 140: 487-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 21Naftalin R.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Biol. 2002; 186: 113-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Efflux was measured after 7.5 μl of 90% cell suspension was added to 3 ml of glucose-free saline in a fluorescence cuvette 2-3 times/s over a 5-min interval. Quercetin Uptake—Net uptake of quercetin (final concentration 25 μm) into glucose-loaded, or glucose-free red cells in 10% hematocrit at 4 °C was terminated by the addition of 200 μl of the cell suspension to ice-cold tubes containing 200 μl of stopping solution. The cell suspensions were twice washed by centrifugation at 4 °C in fresh stopping solution and then resuspended in 400 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and left for 24 h at 4 °C to allow intracellular quercetin to leak into the supernatant. The cells were then recentrifuged, and the supernatants were transferred to a 96-well plate. Quercetin in the supernatants was determined by the absorption at 380 nm with a microplate spectrophotometer. Docking Studies—Docking with the various ligands was carried out using AUTODOCK 3 (11Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9045) Google Scholar). This estimates the energy of ligand binding to the site and its Ki on a rigid three-dimensional construction of the protein and allows for rotations of the ligand bonds where applicable. Data on the position, frequency, and affinity of the ligand docking across the entire GLUT1 surface are obtained and used to map the amino acid residues within3Åofthe ligand binding sites and later the coincidences and differences between different ligands. The three-dimensional data files were collected from the following sources: GLUT1 (1SUK) and maltoporin (1AF6) from the Protein Data Bank (via the Macromolecular Structure Database on the World Wide Web at www.ebi.ac.uk/msd/). Protein Data Bank files of sugars were from “SWEET” on the World Wide Web at www.dkfz-heidelberg.de/spec (supported by the German Research Council) and from Daresbury Chemical Data base Service via “CrystalWeb” at www.cds.dl.ac.uk/cweb. Other Web tools used were the Dundee PRODRG2 Server at www.davapc1.bioch.dundee.ac.uk/prodrg. Molecular displays were created by Swiss-PdbViewer (available at ca.expasy.org/spdbv/) and RasMol (available at openrasmol.org/). The default settings of AUTODOCK were normally used, with the exception of the run and the population size. Between 80 and 100 runs were usually performed. Docking involved a grid of 101 points in three dimensions with a spacing of 0.375 Å centered on the GLUT1 molecule. When restricting the docking to sites with sparse ligand binding, the cube side was reduced to 51 units with the same spacing and centered at the coordinates of the region under consideration. Sequence Homologies between Maltoporin Ligand Binding Strands and the Central Pore Region of GLUT1—Homologies between glucose binding sequences in GLUT1 and the ligand binding strands of maltoporin were obtained as follows: the 492 amino acids of GLUT1 (1SUK) were split into 20-mers, with an overlap of 10 amino acids. The program, FASTA (29Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 852: 444-2448Google Scholar) was used to identify and evaluate the partial matches between each of the 20-mers and sequences in one of the maltoporin subunits (1AF6). The searches were then restricted to those matching the pore region GLUT1, as predicted from the templated model of GLUT1 (3Salas-Burgos A. Iserovich P. Zuniga F. Vera J.C. Fischbarg J. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 2990-2999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and the docking data for d-glucose α- and β-anomers were obtained. Coincidence between d-Glucose Docking Sites and GLUT1-DS Mutation Sites—The sites of GLUT1-DS mutations (30Wang D. Pascual J.M. Yang H. Engelstad K. Jhung S. Sun R.P. De Vivo D.C. Ann.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12621-12626Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) were mapped on the three-dimensional structure of GLUT1, and their coincidence was estimated by layering this map onto others with the α- and β-d-glucose docking sites obtained with AUTODOCK. The distances of the mutations from the hexose clusters were obtained using the measuring tools available with Swiss-PdbViewer “Deepview.” Quercetin Inhibition of Glucose Transport—Inhibition of glucose transport by quercetin and other flavonols decreases when the pH is raised above 7.5 (32Salter D.W. Custead-Jones S. Cook J.S. J. Membr. Biol. 1978; 40: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Quercetin, like genistein and estradiol, inhibits the maximal glucose exit rates without significant effect on glucose affinity at the external site, indicating that it acts on glucose transport at the endofacial surface (10Naftalin R.J.

J. 2002; 365: 707-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Quercetin takes part in redox reactions with both ferricyanide and ascorbate to form the anion quercetin semiquinone (34Metodiewa D. Jaiswal A.K. Cenas N. Dickancaite E. Segura-Aguilar J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 35Galati G. Sabzevari O. Wilson J.X. O'Brien P.J. Toxicology. 2002; 177: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The addition of ferricyanide or ascorbate to quercetin solutions prevents quercetin from inhibiting glucose transport. Neither ferricyanide, nor ascorbate alone, has any effect on glucose transport. This indicates that quercetin-semiquinone does not inhibit glucose transport (Fig. 1, A and B) and corroborates the view that negatively charged quercetin does not inhibit glucose transport (36Martin H.J. Kornmann F. Fuhrmann G.F. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2003; 146: 225-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Quercetin Uptake into Red Cells at 4 °C—High glucose concentrations or cytochalasin B inhibits quercetin uptake into adipocytes via GLUT4 (7Strobel P. Allard C. Perez-Acle T. Calderon R. Aldunate R. Leighton F. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). External glucose (50 mm) inhibits the quercetin (25 μm) uptake rate by 40% in human erythrocytes at 4 °C (Fig. 1C). However, when 50 mm glucose is preloaded in the internal solution and the external solution is maintained nominally glucose-free, the quercetin uptake rate is accelerated. This acceleration of quercetin uptake in the infinite-trans mode confirms that glucose and quercetin share a common transport path. Although phloretin (100 μm) inhibits glucose influx by more than 90%, it has no effect on quercetin influx with or without intracellular glucose present (not shown). Docking Studies on GLUT1: Hexoses—d-Glucose affinity for the GLUT1 transport system is ∼5 times higher than either d-mannose or d-galactose; d-fructose has a very low affinity and l-glucose has negligible affinity for GLUT1 (37Burant C.F. Bell G.I. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10414-10420Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 38Cohen N.R. Knecht D.A. Lodish H.F. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 971-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The locations of amino acids with similar selectivity to the above were obtained using docking studies with d-glucose, d-galactose, d-mannose, and d-fructose ligands on the GLUT1 three-dimensional template. In aqueous solution, hexoses coexist as α- and β-anomers in a 34:66% ratio, respectively (39Corchado J.C. Sanchez M.L. Aguilar M.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 7311-7319Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). β-d-Glucose is transported faster than α-d-glucose by human erythrocytes (40Miwa I. Fujii H. Okuda J. Biochem. Int. 1988; 16: 111-117PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, docking of α- and β-anomers of d-glucose, d-galactose, d-mannose, and l-glucose was studied. Docking reveals 10 clusters of sites for α- and β-d-glucose anomers on GLUT1. The clusters were identified, initially by visual inspection of the docking output of AUTODOCK 3 (Fig. 2A) and then confirmed with K-means cluster analysis (Table 1). Nine clusters are in the central hydrophilic pore region and another in a side pocket accessible from the endofacial vestibule. The α- and β-d-glucose affinities increase with depth in the external vestibule (clusters 1-5; Ki range 0.34-0.11 mm; Table 1). The increase in affinity with depth favors sugar movement from the external solution to the bottom of an energy well at cluster 5 (yellow) at the narrowest part of the channel before emergence into the internal vestibule. A similar affinity gradient to that found here with d-glucose has been observed in the maltoporin pore with maltosaccharides (27Dutzler R. Schirmer T. Karplus M. Fischer S. Structure (Camb.). 2002; 10: 1273-1284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The clusters in the internal vestibule (clusters 6-9) all have lower affinities (see Table 1). The cluster (green cluster 10) in the side pocket has the highest affinity, Ki = 0.04 mm. All but the red (cluster 1) and green (cluster 10) clusters are either coincident with or close to missense mutations found in GLUT1-DS (30Wang D. Pascual J.M. Yang H. Engelstad K. Jhung S. Sun R.P.

https://openalex.org/W1987581156,"The transcription factor IPF1/PDX1 plays a crucial role in both pancreas development and maintenance of β-cell function. Targeted disruption of this transcription factor in β-cells leads to diabetes, whereas reduced expression levels affect insulin expression and secretion. Therefore, it is essential to determine molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of this key transcription factor on mRNA levels and, most importantly, on protein levels. Here we show that a minor portion of IPF1/PDX1 is phosphorylated on serine 61 and/or serine 66 in pancreatic β-cells. This phosphorylated form of IPF1/PDX1 preferentially accumulates following proteasome inhibition, an effect that is prevented by inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) activity. Oxidative stress, which is associated with the diabetic state, (i) increases IPF1/PDX1 Ser61 and/or Ser66 phosphorylation and (ii) increases the degradation rate and decreases the half-life of IPF-1/PDX-1 protein. In addition, we provide evidence that GSK3 activity participates in oxidative stress-induced effects on β-cells. Thus, this current study uncovers a new mechanism that might contribute to diminished levels of IPF1/PDX1 protein and β-cell dysfunction during the progression of diabetes.

The homeodomain transcription factor IPF1/PDX1 (insulin promoter factor 1/pancreas duodenum homeobox 1) operates as a master of pancreas development and also ensures differentiated β-cell function. Homozygous disruption of the Ipf1/Pdx1 gene results in pancreatic agenesis in both mice (1Jonsson J. Carlsson L. Edlund T. Edlund H.

In humans, heterozygosity for an inactivating mutation in the Ipf1/Pdx1 gene is associated with development of (MODY 4) maturity onset diabetes of the young (7Stoffers D.A. Ferrer J. Clarke W.L. Habener J.F. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 138-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), a monogenetic form of type 2 diabetes that results from impaired β-cell function characterized by perturbed insulin secretion. Moreover, missense mutations in the Ipf1/Pdx1 gene, in conjunction with other mutations, appear to predispose to the adult onset form of type 2 diabetes (8Cockburn B.N. Bermano G. Boodram L.L.

The participation of IPF1/PDX1 in the transcription of several genes essential for glucose sensing and insulin synthesis underlines its key role in differentiated β-cells. IPF1/PDX1 has been shown to bind and regulate the promoter activity of specific β-cell genes such as insulin (12Ohlsson H. Karlsson K. Edlund T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4251-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar), Glut2 (13Waeber G. Thompson N. Nicod P. Bonny C. Mol.

At the level of the insulin gene promoter, IPF1/PDX1 acts in concert with other transcription factors, such as Beta2/Neuro D1 and the E2A family proteins, and coactivators including p300 and Bridge-1 (17Ohneda K.

Thus, it is the accurate protein-protein interactions between transcription factors and coactivators that define the level of expression of the insulin gene. Despite a clearly established role for IPF1/PDX1 in pancreas development and β-cell function, less is known about its regulation, particularly at the post-translational level. Previous reports indicated nuclear translocation of IPF1/PDX1 upon glucose stimulation that correlate with an increase in insulin-promoter activity (22Rafiq I. Kennedy H.J. Rutter G.A. J. Biol.

Others have reported a nutrient-dependent regulation of insulin promoter activity through increased DNA binding capacity of IPF1/PDX1 (24Petersen H.V. Peshavaria M. Pederson A.A. Philippe J. Stein R.

Physiol. 2003; 284: E830-E840Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, the exact post-translational modification involved, the conditions when this occurs, the underlying mechanism, and the effect on IPF1/PDX1 function remains largely unresolved. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) 3The abbreviations used are: GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase 3; CIP, calf intestinal phosphatase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HEK293, human embryonic kidney 293; LLnL, N-acetyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-norleucinal; MEK, mitogen extracellular kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RIP, rat insulin promoter; WT, wild type. is an ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine kinase that has been implicated in multiple processes including cell fate determination, metabolism, transcriptional and translational control, oncogenesis, and neurological diseases (31Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar). There are two mammalian isoforms of GSK3 encoded by different genes, GSK3α and GSK3β, that are highly homologous and share substrate specificity in vitro. Unlike most protein kinases, GSK3 is constitutively active in resting cells and is inactivated after cellular stimulation by growth factors or hormones such as Wnt ligands and insulin. GSK3 phosphorylates a broad range of substrates including important growth regulators such as β-catenin, cyclin D1, and p21, as well as numerous transcription factors including c-Myc and c-Jun (31Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar). The current study was undertaken to clarify post-translational modifications involved in the modulation of the pancreatic transcription factor IPF1/PDX1 function. Herein, we demonstrate that IPF1/PDX1 can be phosphorylated in vivo on serine 61 and/or serine 66 in pancreatic β-cells. We also show that this phosphorylation targets the protein for degradation by the proteasome machinery and that it is GSK3-dependent. Finally, the present data reveal that oxidative stress, which occurs in the diabetic state, increases serine 61 and/or serine 66 phosphorylation, which correlates with an increased degradation rate and a decreased half-life for the IPF1/PDX1 protein. Hence, our data provide evidence of a new mechanism that leads to reduced levels of IPF1/PDX1 protein and β-cell dysfunction during the development of diabetes. Materials—Calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) and Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture tablets were obtained from Roche Applied Science. All other materials were obtained from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Antibodies—For the production of the anti-phospho-IPF1/PDX1 antibody, a synthetic peptide covering the region 57LEQGpSPPDIpSPYE69 (Innovagen) of IPF1/PDX1, conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin protein using a N-terminal cysteine, was used to immunize rabbits (Agrisera, Sweden). Antiserum was affinity-purified using the synthetic peptide conjugated to UltraLink agarose beads (Nordic Biolabs). Preparation of polyclonal anti-pan-IPF1/PDX1 antiserum has been described previously (12Ohlsson H. Karlsson K. Edlund T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4251-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). Anti-His monoclonal antibody was from Qiagen. Monoclonal antibody against GSK3α/β was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, Stockholm, Sweden). Polyclonal antibodies recognizing phosphorylation on serine 21 of GSK3α and serine 9 of GSK3β and ERK1/2 were obtained from Cell Signaling (In Vitro, Stockholm, Sweden). Expression Vectors and Constructs—The full-length IPF1/PDX1 cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 mammalian expression vector, and a His6 tag was added by PCR using an oligonucleotide containing the sequence encoding the tag. S61A, S61D, S66A, and S66D mutations were introduced into the pcDNA3.1-IPF1/PDX1 vector using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The insulin reporter construct used for luciferase assays contained the rat insulin promoter I (RIP) from residues -410 to +51 cloned upstream of the luciferase gene. All of the constructs generated by cloning and mutagenesis were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mouse cDNA coding for GSK3β (pCMV-SPORT6-GSK3β) was from an image clone (GI:13905273). Islet Isolation and Cell Culture—Islets were isolated by collagenase digestion of pancreas (32Ahren B. Simonsson E. Scheurink A.J. Mulder H. Myrsen U. Sundler F. Metabolism. 1997; 46: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Before treatment, the islets were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 3 mm d-glucose. For overnight cultures the islets were incubated at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 3 or 25 mm glucose. The islets were then lysed as described below or fixed with paraformaldehyde 4%, and frozen in Tissue Tek. The mouse αTC1/16, βTC3, and MIN6 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 5.5 mm d-glucose and 2 mm glutamine supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin in humidified 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. The human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose, 2 mm glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry was carried out as described elsewhere (4Ahlgren U. Jonsson J. Jonsson L. Simu K. Edlund H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1763-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). At least 20 unique islets were analyzed for each glucose concentrations. Primary antibodies used were pan-IPF1/PDX1 (12Ohlsson H. Karlsson K. Edlund T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4251-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar) and phospho-IPF1/PDX1 antibody (this paper). Secondary antibodies used were: Cy3-anti-rabbit (Jackson Laboratory). Protein Expression and Immunoblotting—The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, lysed in Triton buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm orthovanadate, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, and 10% of protease inhibitor mixture) and cleared of cellular debris by centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C). The protein concentrations were measured using BCA (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Equal amounts of proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), and the proteins were detected immunologically after electrotransfer onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at 25 °C. The membranes were then incubated with appropriate primary antibodies in blocking solution followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. After extensive washing in PBS with 0.05% Tween, the blots were visualized with chemiluminescence reagent. Immunoprecipitation and Dephosphorylation of IPF1/PDX1 by CIP—The cells were solubilized in Triton buffer, and 1 mg of cleared lysate was immunoprecipitated with pan-IPF1/PDX1 antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was then added for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose complexes were washed three times with Triton buffer or assay buffer (for dephosphorylation assay) (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 10% of protease inhibitor mixture). For dephosphorylation assay, the beads were equally split in two Eppendorf tubes. CIP (30 units/ml) was added to one of them, and both tubes were then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 4× Laemmli sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2.2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.005% bromphenol blue). Transient Transfections and Luciferase Assays—The cells were seeded in 6-well plates (for protein expression analysis) or 24-well plates (for luciferase assay) and transfected with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol using the indicated amount of DNA. Empty expression plasmid was used to maintain a constant total amount of DNA among wells. For protein expression analysis, the cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and protein lysates were prepared as described above. For luciferase assays, the cells were harvested 36 h after transfection with passive lysis buffer (Promega), and luciferase activities were determined using the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The data are expressed as firefly luciferase activity divided by Renilla luciferase (from pRL-CMV Renilla luciferase vector; Promega) activity to control for transfection efficiency among the different conditions. Data Presentation—All of the experiments were performed at least in triplicate. Typical Western blots are representative of three independent experiments. Densitometric analyses were performed using the Scion Image 4.02 software package (Scion Corp., Frederick, MA). A Minor Portion of IPF1/PDX1 Is Phosphorylated in Pancreatic β-Cells—In the pancreatic β-cell line, MIN6, immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis using an anti-pan-IPF1/PDX1 antibody revealed two bands: a major band at ∼42 kDa and a minor band of higher molecular mass (43 kDa) (Fig. 1A). Because phosphorylation has been proposed as a potential post-translational modification for IPF1/PDX1 (24Petersen H.V. Peshavaria M. Pederson A.A. Philippe J. Stein R. Madsen O.D. Serup P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 27Fernandez-Alvarez J. Barbera A. Nadal B. Barcelo-Batllori S. Piquer S. Claret M. Guinovart J.J. Gomis R. Diabetologia. 2004; 47: 470-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 28Khoo S. Griffen S.C. Xia Y. Baer R.J. German M.S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32969-32977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the upper band might correspond to a phosphorylated form of IPF1/PDX1. To test this hypothesis, IPF1/PDX1 was immunoprecipitated and submitted to CIP treatment. Following CIP treatment, the 43-kDa band disappeared, and only the major 42-kDa band could be detected using the anti-pan-IPF1/PDX1 antibody (Fig. 1B), thus supporting the idea that the 43-kDa protein is a phosphorylated form of IPF1/PDX1. We next analyzed IPF1/PDX1 protein expression in mouse islets and in different pancreatic cell lines. The phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of IPF1/PDX1 protein were present in islets and all pancreatic β-cell lines tested but not in the pancreatic α-cell line αTC1/16 (Fig. 1C), suggesting that a minor portion of IPF1/PDX1 is phosphorylated in pancreatic β-cells. By examination of the N-terminal sequence, we identified two conserved potential phosphorylation sites, Ser61 and Ser66, that also have been suggested by others as potential phosphorylation sites for IPF1/PDX1 (20Stanojevic V. Habener J.F. Thomas M.K. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 2918-2928Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 28Khoo S. Griffen S.C. Xia Y. Baer R.J. German M.S. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32969-32977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, we developed a specific antibody that recognizes phosphorylation of IPF1/PDX1 on Ser61 and/or Ser66 (see “Experimental Procedures”). By Western blot, the anti-phospho-IPF1/PDX1 antibody recognized only one band (Fig. 1C) that corresponded to the highest molecular mass band (43 kDa) visualized by the original IPF1/PDX1 antibody (12Ohlsson H. Karlsson K. Edlund T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4251-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar), hereafter denoted by the pan-IPF1/PDX1 antibody. To assess which phosphorylated serine was recognized by our antibody and to study an eventual functional importance of IPF1/PDX1 Ser61 and/or Ser66 phosphorylation, we proceeded to generate serine-to-alanine (to abolish phosphorylation) and serine-to-aspartic acid (to mimic phosphorylation) point mutations in the full-length Ipf1/Pdx1 coding sequence. His-tagged proteins were expressed in HEK293 cells, and the expression of the proteins, together with their phosphorylation status, was examined. The wild type (WT) construct generated a major protein band of 42 kDa together with a minor band of higher molecular mass (43 kDa), the latter being recognized by the anti-phospho-IPF1/PDX1 antibody (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, the S61A mutant displayed only one major 42-kDa band, and no band corresponding to the phosphorylated IPF1/PDX1 (43-kDa band) was detected, whereas the S61D mutant showed one major 43-kDa band that could also be detected by the anti-phospho-IPF1/PDX1 antibody (Fig. 1D). The S66A mutant still exhibited two bands of 42 and 43 kDa, but the S66D mutant was expressed as a single 43-kDa protein (Fig. 1D). In both cases the 43-kDa band was detected by the anti-phospho-IPF1/PDX1 antibody (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results indicate that our anti-phospho-IPF1/PDX1 antibody can recognize either Ser61 or Ser66 phosphorylation on IPF1/PDX1 protein, that phosphorylation on Ser61 is critical to generate electrophoretic mobility shift of IPF1/PDX1, and that Ser61 phosphorylation is necessary to subsequently achieve Ser66 phosphorylation. Moreover, these results support our findings that IPF1/PDX1 is phosphorylated in vivo on Ser61 and/or Ser66 in pancreatic β-cells and suggest that Ser61 and/or Ser66 are likely to be targets for kinases. The subcellular localization of IPF1/PDX1 has been suggested to be regulated by glucose in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. At low concentrations, 0.5-3 mm glucose, IPF1/PDX1 was found to be unphosphorylated, excluded from the nucleus, and located in the cytoplasm, whereas shifting cells to glucose concentrations of 10 mm and higher, resulted in a complete translocation of IPF1/PDX1 to the nucleus (23Macfarlane W.M. McKinnon C.M. Felton-Edkins Z.A. Cragg H. James R.F.L. Docherty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1011-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 33Elrick L.J. Docherty K. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2244-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, we next proceeded to investigate the subcellular localization of IPF1/PDX1 using both the anti-pan-IPF1/PDX1 and the anti-phospho-IPF1/PDX1 antibodies. As expected IPF1/PDX1, detected using either the anti-pan-IPF1/PDX1 or the anti-phospho-IPF1/PDX1 antibodies, was nuclear in islets and MIN6 cells cultured at high glucose concentrations (Fig. 1E and data not shown). However, also at low glucose conditions (3 mm), distinct nuclear staining was detected using both the anti-pan-IPF1/PDX1 and anti-phospho-IPF1/PDX1 antibodies (Fig. 1E and data not shown). Taken together, these data demonstrate that irrespective of the glucose concentrations, and phosphorylation state, the IPF1/PDX1 protein is nuclear. Accumulation of Phosphorylated IPF1/PDX1 Following Proteasome Inhibition—There is accumulating evidence that the ubiquitin-proteasome system controls transcription factors at multiple levels and thus influences transcription (34Muratani M. Tansey W.P. Nat. Rev. 2003; 4: 1-10Crossref Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has recently been shown that MafA and IPF1/PDX1, two key players in insulin gene expression, are ubiquitinated and degraded in response to oxidative stress (35Harmon J.S. Stein R. Robertson R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11107-11113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next tested the effect of the proteasome inhibitor LLnL (36Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2197) Google Scholar) on IPF1/PDX1 phosphorylation and protein levels. As shown in Fig. 2, treatment of cells with LLnL led to a distinct accumulation of phosphorylated IPF1/PDX1 protein (3.6-fold increase after 4 h and 9.1-fold increase after 8 h), whereas no significant change were observed in the nonphosphorylated IPF1/PDX1 protein level. Coincubation with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide did not prevent the LLnL-induced accumulation of phosphorylated IPF1/PDX1, indicating that this modification is post-translational (data not shown). This observation suggests that the phosphorylated form of IPF1/PDX1 is preferably targeted for degradation by the proteasome machinery. GSK3-dependent Mechanisms Modulate IPF1/PDX1 Phosphorylation—In an attempt to investigate potential kinases involved in IPF1/PDX1 Ser61 and/or Ser66 phosphorylation, we treated MIN6 cells with different kinase inhibitors and analyzed IPF1/PDX1 phosphorylation status using our anti-phospho-IPF1/PDX1 antibody. No modulation of IPF1/PDX1 phosphorylation was found following treatment with the MEK inhibitor U0126, the calmodulin kinase inhibitor KN93, or the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 (data not shown), previously shown to influence mRNA expression of the IPF1/PDX1 target gene insulin (28Khoo S.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 971-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, treatment of MIN6 cells with the GSK3 inhibitor, LiCl (40Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulted in a slight but consistent reduction in IPF1/PDX1 phosphorylation by ∼30%, without significantly affecting total IPF1/PDX1 protein expression (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, in IPF1/PDX1 WT-transfected HEK293 cells, LiCl treatment also reduced exogenous IPF1/PDX1 phosphorylation by 60% (Fig. 3B). Conversely, HEK293 cells cotransfected with IPF1/PDX1 WT and GSK3β showed an increase in IPF1/PDX1 phosphorylation (1.5-fold) compared with control cells transfected with IPF1/PDX1 alone. This level was comparable with the 1.9-fold increase in exogenous GSK3β protein expression. Moreover, the addition of LiCl greatly reduced the GSK3β-induced IPF1/PDX1 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these results suggest that GSK3 activity is likely to influence IPF1/PDX1 phosphorylation on Ser61 and/or Ser66. Because our results suggested that phosphorylation of IPF1/PDX1 might be a signal for degradation by the proteasome machinery, we next evaluated whether inhibition of GSK3 activity could prevent accumulation of the phosphorylated IPF1/PDX1 protein following proteasome inhibition. As shown in Fig. 3C, LiCl treatment prevented the LLnL-induced accumulation of phosphorylated IPF1/PDX1, supporting the idea that phosphorylation of either Ser61 and/or Ser66 of IPF1/PDX1 targets the phosphorylated protein for degradation by GSK3-dependent mechanisms. Oxidative Stress Induces IPF1/PDX1 Phosphorylation—There is now considerable evidence that oxidative stress, which is found in the diabetic state, is involved in the progression of β-cell deterioration (41Robertson R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42351-42354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). To elucidate whether IPF1/PDX1 phosphorylation is affected by the oxidative state, we submitted cells to oxidative stress by treating them with H2O2. The addition of 50 μm H2O2 led within 30 min to a 2-fold induction of IPF1/PDX1 phosphorylation (Fig. 4A). Comparable results were obtained in isolated mouse islets (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 5A, dose-response analysis of IPF1/PDX1 phosphorylation after H2O2 treatment revealed an even higher level of phosphorylated IPF1/PDX1 (nearly 4-fold increase compared with the 2-fold increase induced by 50 μm H2O2) following 2 h of treatment with 100 μm H2O2, which correlated with a 70% re"
https://openalex.org/W2133131387,"Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by polyglutamine expansion within the Atrophin-1 protein. To study the mechanism of this disease and to test potential therapeutic methods, we established Atro-118Q transgenic mice, which express in neurons a mutant human Atrophin-1 protein that contains an expanded stretch of 118 glutamines. Consistent with the results from previous studies on transgenic mice that expressed mutant Atrophin-1 with 65 glutamines, Atro-118Q mice exhibited several neurodegenerative phenotypes that are commonly seen in DRPLA patients, including ataxia, tremors, and other motor defects. Overexpression of wild-type human Atrophin-1 could not rescue the motor and survival defects in Atro-118Q mice, indicating that the mutant protein with polyglutamine expansion does not simply function in a dominant negative manner. Biochemical analysis of Atro-118Q mice revealed hypoacetylation of histone H3 in brain tissues and thus suggested that global gene repression is an underlying mechanism for neurodegeneration in this mouse model. We further show that intraperitoneal administration of sodium butyrate, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, ameliorated the histone acetylation defects, significantly improved motor performance, and extended the average life span of Atro-118Q mice. These results support the hypothesis that transcription deregulation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of polyglutamine expansion diseases and suggest that reversion of transcription repression with small molecules such as sodium butyrate is a feasible approach to treating DRPLA symptoms.

Oyanagi S. Neurology. 1982; 32: 798-807Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This disease is caused by expansion of a polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat within the Atrophin-1 protein. The glutamine stretch in Atrophin-1 ranges from 6 to 35 in normal individuals and expands from 48 to 88 in DRPLA patients (2Koide R. Ikeuchi T. Onodera O. Tanaka H. Igarashi S. Endo K. Takahashi H.

Neuropathological analyses of DRPLA patients identified widespread nuclear inclusion bodies and loss of neurons in specific brain regions such as the dentate cerebellar nucleus, red nucleus, globus pallidus, and subthalamic nucleus (1Naito H.

DRPLA and several other disorders, including Huntington's disease (HD), spinobulbar muscular atrophy, and at least six types of spinocerebellar ataxia, constitute a family of neurodegenerative diseases that are caused by polyQ-expanded proteins (8Ross C.A.

Brain Res. 1998; 117: 397-419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DRPLA causative protein Atrophin-1 is an evolutionarily conserved transcription regulator. Drosophila Atrophin (Atro) functions as a transcription corepressor, which interacts with the transcription repressors Even-skipped (Eve) and Huckebein (Hkb) during embryonic development (11Zhang S. Xu L. Lee J. Xu T. Cell. 2002; 108: 45-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The human Atrophin-1 protein was shown to interact in vitro with ETO/MTG8, a component of nuclear receptor corepressor complexes (12Wood J.D. Nucifora Jr., F.C. Duan K. Zhang C. Wang J. Kim Y. Schilling G. Sacchi N. Liu J.M. Ross C.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 939-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and suppress gene transcription in vivo (11Zhang S. Xu L. Lee J. Xu T. Cell. 2002; 108: 45-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Human Atrophin-1 can also form a heterodimer with Atrophin-2, another Atrophin family protein capable of recruiting the chromatin remodeling enzyme histone deacetylase 1 (13Zoltewicz J.S. Stewart N.J. Leung R. Peterson A.S. Development. 2004; 131: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Interestingly, polyQ-expanded Atrophin-1 can also function as a transcription repressor, although it is less potent than the wild-type protein in a fly-based reporter assay (11Zhang S. Xu L. Lee J. Xu T. Cell. 2002; 108: 45-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, a separate study showed that the binding between Atrophin-1 and Atrophin-2 was enhanced by the presence of a polyQ expansion in Atrophin-1 (14Yanagisawa H. Bundo M. Miyashita T. Okamura-Oho Y. Tadokoro K. Tokunaga K. Yamada M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Moreover, polyQ-expanded Atrophin-1 was found to interact with transcription coactivators such as CBP and TAFII130, and inhibit the CREB-mediated gene transcription (15Shimohata T. Nakajima T. Yamada M. Uchida C. Onodera O. Naruse S. Kimura T. Koide R. Nozaki K. Sano Y. Ishiguro H. Sakoe K. Ooshima T. Sato A. Ikeuchi T. Oyake M. Sato T. Aoyagi Y. Hozumi I. Nagatsu T. Takiyama Y.

Thus far, the published data are not sufficient to distinguish whether the polyQ expansion of Atrophin-1 results in a dominant negative effect or a gain of function. It is generally hypothesized that deregulation of transcription is a key contributor to the pathogenesis of DRPLA and other polyQ expansion diseases (11Zhang S. Xu L. Lee J. Xu T. Cell. 2002; 108: 45-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 17Cha J.H. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 387-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, many changes of gene expression have been observed in mouse models of HD and DRPLA (18Luthi-Carter R. Strand A.D. Hanson S.A. Kooperberg C. Schilling G. La Spada A.R. Merry D.E. Young A.B. Ross C.A. Borchelt D.R. Olson J.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1927-1937Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PolyQ-expanded proteins cause the deactivation of CBP, which has a histone acetyltransferase activity, and lead to cellular toxicity (16Nucifora Jr., F.C. Sasaki M. Peters M.F. Huang H. Cooper J.K.

Nature. 1996; 384: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (1526) Google Scholar). It suggests that the balance of histone acetylation is a good target for therapeutic intervention of polyQ expansion diseases (20Bodai L. Pallos J. Thompson L.M. Marsh J.L. Curr. Med. Chem. 2003; 10: 2577-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). HDACs catalyze histone deacetylation, a reaction opposite of HAT-mediated histone acetylation, and thus induce chromatin compaction and gene repression (21Lemon B. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2551-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 22Ng H.H. Bird A. Trends Biochem.

HDAC inhibitors, such as sodium butyrate (SB) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), have been shown to promote histone acetylation and modulate gene expression (24Candido E.P. Reeves R. Davie J.R. Cell. 1978; 14: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar, 25Marks P. Rifkind R.A. Richon V.M. Breslow R. Miller T. Kelly W.K. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). SB and SAHA could arrest polyQ-dependent neurodegeneration and reduce lethality in a Drosophila model of HD (26Steffan J.S. Bodai L. Pallos J. Poelman M. McCampbell A. Apostol B.L. Kazantsev A. Schmidt E. Zhu Y.Z. Greenwald M. Kurokawa R. Housman D.E. Jackson G.R. Marsh J.L. Thompson L.M.

However, the effects of SB or SAHA on a DRPLA model have never been tested. Previously, two independent groups had established transgenic mice that expressed mutant Atrophin-1 with an expanded stretch of 65 or 78 glutamines (30Schilling G. Wood J.D. Duan K. Slunt H.H.

Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that polyQ-expanded Atrophin-1 can cause behavioral and neuropathological defects in transgenic mice similar to that seen in DRPLA patients (32Schilling G. Jinnah H.A. Gonzales V.

Here, we used an independently generated DRPLA mouse model to further investigate the disease mechanism and examine the therapeutic potential of SB in treating DRPLA symptoms. Generation of Transgenic Mice—Full-length human atrophin-1 cDNAs with a stretch of CAG repeats encoding either 18 or 118 consecutive glutamines were cloned into the NSE transgenic vector with rat neuron-specific enolase promoter (a gift from Dr. Hanxiang Deng, Northwestern University) to construct Atro-18Q and Atro-118Q, respectively. The transgenes were linearized by NotI digestion before pronuclear injection following standard protocols (33Nagy A. Gertsenstein M. Vintersten K. Behringer R. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2002: 289-358Google Scholar). Toe DNA was analyzed by PCR with the following primers: TransQ-1 (5′-GCCTCAGGCTCCACCCTTCTAAG-3′) and TransQ-2 (5′-AGGCAGGTTCGGTGTCACATGG-3′). For Southern Blotting, tail DNAs were digested with EcoRV and probed with labeled fragments of the human atrophin-1 coding sequence (bp 2691-3568). Atro-118Q founder mice were from the mixed background of C57BL/6J and SJL/J (Jackson Laboratories). Atro-118Q3 and Atro-118Q14 mice were backcrossed to the C57BL/6J background for four to six generations before phenotypic analysis and SB treatment. The transgene in the Atro-118Q3 line could be bred to homozygosity; the attempt to generate homozygous animals for the Atro-118Q14 transgene failed because a female sterility was associated with the hemizygotes. Atro-118Q14 mice were also backcrossed to the FVB/NJ background for four generations before crossing with Atro-18Q mice on the FVB/NJ background. The genotypes of Atro-118Q3(Tg/Tg) mice were determined by test breeding for more than 20 progenies. Western Blotting Analysis—Brain tissues were homogenized on ice in 3 volumes of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1× PBS (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% SDS, and complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)), and incubated for 45 min. The supernatants were collected by centrifuge twice at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentrations were assessed using a BCA kit (Pierce). After running on SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) using 2 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol as the transfer buffer. For better detection of Atrophin-1, 0.005% SDS was added to the transfer buffer to enhance protein transfer. Western blotting was performed following a protocol described in Research Applications from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and the signals were detected using a chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Signal intensity of each band was calculated using the National Institutes of Health Image software (version 1.61). The primary antibodies were anti-Atrophin-1 (sc-10301), anti-c-Myc (sc-789), and anti-α-Tubulin (sc-12462) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Histone acetylation was determined following a reported procedure (34Shahbazian M. Young J. Yuva-Paylor L. Spencer C. Antalffy B. Noebels J. Armstrong D. Paylor R. Zoghbi H. Neuron. 2002; 35: 243-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Acid extracts of brain proteins were probed with anti-acetyl-histone H3 rabbit antiserum (Upstate 07-353). Immunohistochemistry—Brains were embedded in OCT compound and frozen in isopentane precooled in liquid nitrogen. Frozen sections (10 μm) were fixed in cold acetone. Immunostaining was done with anti-Atrophin-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-10301) following an ABC staining procedure (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) with 3,3′-diaminobenzidene tetrahydrochloride as the substrate. Brain Section for Nissl Staining—Mice were anesthetized and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4). Brains were post-fixed in the same fixative and processed for paraffin embedding. Coronal sections (10 μm) were done for Nissl staining with Cresyl Violet (Sigma). The somal size of neurons with obvious nucleoli was measured using a microscope (Leica DMRXA2). Survival and Behavioral Assays—All mouse experiments were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care & Use Committee of Institute of Developmental Biology and Molecular Medicine, Fudan University. Rotarod performance was assessed on a rod rotating at 10 revolutions per minute (Tianhuan Instruments). Mice received six training trials from the age of 18 to 20 days. After training, four trials were given weekly to get an average score. A cutoff time of 180 s was set for each trial. Hanging wire performance was assessed on an inverted wire (60 × 60 cm), designed according to a reported protocol (35Crawley J.N. What's Wrong with My Mouse?: Behavioral Phenotyping of Transgenic and Knockout Mice. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2000: 53-55Google Scholar). Mice received the same training as in the rotarod test. Two trials were given weekly with a cutoff time of 180 s. Administration of SB—A daily dose of SB at 0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 mg/kg body weight was administrated to Atro-118Q14 mice and wild-type mice starting from the age of 4 weeks via intraperitoneal injection. Sodium butyrate (Alfa Aesar) was dissolved in PBS (pH 7.4) and made fresh daily. Control groups received PBS alone. Statistical Analysis—Data were collected in Microsoft Excel 2000 and analyzed with Analyze-it (version 1.71). Statistical comparisons were performed using an unpaired t test (confidence interval, 99%) to calculate the p value. Atro-118Q Transgenic Mice Exhibit Neurodegenerative Phenotypes—To establish a mouse model for DRPLA, we used the neuron-specific enolase (NSE) promoter to drive the expression of human atrophin-1 in neurons (Fig. 1A, also see “Experimental Procedures”). Two transgenic founders were obtained for the atrophin-1 transgene, Atro-118Q, which carries an expanded stretch of CAG repeats encoding 118 glutamines. As determined by Southern blotting (supplemental Fig. S1), one of the founders, Atro-118Q14, carried two copies of the transgene in a head-to-head orientation, whereas the other founder, Atro-118Q3, carried only one copy of the transgene. Totally, we established two hemizygous and one homozygous lines from these two founders: Atro-118Q14, Atro-118Q3, and Atro-118Q3(Tg/Tg), respectively (see “Experimental Procedures”). Both Atro-118Q14 and Atro-118Q3(Tg/Tg) mice exhibited neurodegenerative phenotypes, including feet-clasping (Fig. 1B), tremor, and ataxic gait. However, Atro-118Q3 mice did not show any of these phenotypes when compared with nontransgenic mice. Western blotting of brain protein extracts with the anti-Atrophin-1 antibody (sc-10301) indicated that the phenotypic difference was likely due to the difference in transgene expression. Both Atro-118Q14 and Atro-118Q3(Tg/Tg) mice displayed higher levels of transgene expression than did Atro-118Q3 mice (Fig. 1C). Measuring the signal density of protein band in Western blot indicated that the level of transgene expression in Atro-118Q3 mice was ∼55.6% of that in Atro-118Q14 mice and 59.8% of that in Atro-118Q3(Tg/Tg) mice. Several assays were used to further characterize the phenotypes of Atro-118Q mice. Fig. 1D shows the long term survival of 11 mice of each transgenic line. Both Atro-118Q14 and Atro-118Q3(Tg/Tg) mice had much shorter life spans (22.3 ± 3.4 and 34.0 ± 3.1 week on average, respectively), whereas Atro-118Q3 mice appeared to be normal with life spans longer than 60 weeks. The motor performance of Atro-118Q mice was analyzed by two behavioral tests, the rotarod test and the hanging wire test (35Crawley J.N. What's Wrong with My Mouse?: Behavioral Phenotyping of Transgenic and Knockout Mice. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2000: 53-55Google Scholar). Atro-118Q14 and Atro-118Q3(Tg/Tg) mice progressively lost the capability to coordinate and balance in the rotarod test, while Atro-118Q3 had normal rotarod performance (Fig. 1E). The hanging wire test also revealed motor defects in Atro-118Q14 and Atro-118Q3(Tg/Tg) mice (Fig. 1F) at a slightly later time point. Protein aggregation in the nucleus, a pathological phenomenon in DRPLA patients and previous DRPLA mouse models, was also detected in Atro-118Q mice. Immunohistochemistry with the anti-Atrophin-1 antibody (sc-10301) was performed on coronal brain sections. Samples from 12-week-old Atro-118Q14 mice displayed extensive nuclear accumulation of Atrophin-1 and widespread nuclear inclusions in several brain regions (Fig. 2, A-H). Similar phenotypes were also observed in Atro-118Q3(Tg/Tg) mice at the same age, whereas aged Atro-118Q3 mice had a much weaker nuclear accumulation and nearly no inclusions (data not shown). As a control, nontransgenic mice only had a very weak nuclear immunoreactivity under the same assay conditions (Fig. 2I). We also observed changes of neuron morphology in the dentate cerebellar nucleus, the brain region usually affected in DRPLA patients. In Atro-118Q14 mice, neurons in the dentate cerebellar nucleus displayed somal atrophy, which was absent in the control littermates (Fig. 2J). We further measured the somal area of these neurons and sorted them into ten size groups (Fig. 2K). The result showed that the average somal size of these neurons in Atro-118Q14 mice was significantly smaller than that of the nontransgenic littermates (328.6 ± 4.1 μm2 for Atro118Q14 and 429.4 ± 11.5 μm2 for the control group). Similar somal atrophy of neurons in the dentate cerebellar nucleus was also observed in Atro-118Q3(Tg/Tg) mice but not in Atro-118Q3 mice (data not shown). The Motor and Survival Defects in Atro-118Q Mice Are Not Due to a Dominant Negative Effect—The dominant inheritance of DRPLA and other polyQ expansion diseases suggests that the defects may be due to either a hyperactive, dominant negative, or neomorphic role of the mutant gene. To further understand the dominant feature of polyQ expansion, we generated Atro-18Q transgenic mice expressing human wild-type Atrophin-1 with 18 glutamines (Fig. 3A, also see “Experimental Procedures”). If the phenotypes observed in our Atro-118Q mice result from a dominant negative effect of polyQ-expanded Atrophin-1, overexpression of wild-type Atrophin-1 would be expected to suppress the abnormality caused by polyQ-expanded Atrophin-1. Female Atro-18Q mice were crossed to male Atro-118Q14 mice, and their offspring were classified into four groups based on their genotypes: Atro-118Q/Atro-18Q, Atro-118Q, Atro-18Q, and nontransgenic mice. Western blotting for Atrophin-1 expression showed that expression levels of wild-type Atrophin-1 are much higher than Atrophin-1(118Q) in Atro-118Q/Atro-18Q mice (Fig. 3A). Rotarod and hanging wire tests were used to assess the motor performance of these four groups. At the age of 5 and 9 weeks, Atro-118Q/Atro-18Q mice were severely impaired in rotarod tests, and no statistical difference was seen between the performance of Atro-118Q/Atro-18Q and Atro-118Q mice (Fig. 3B). The hanging wire test also indicated no statistical difference between the performance of Atro-118Q/Atro-18Q and Atro-118Q mice (Fig. 3C). Atro-18Q mice showed normal performance similar to nontransgenic mice in the rotarod and the hanging wire test (data not shown). The average life span of Atro-118Q/Atro-18Q and Atro-118Q mice also showed no significant difference (Fig. 3D). The inability of wild-type Atrophin-1 to rescue the motor or survival defects in Atro-118Q mice suggests that the defects in Atro-118Q mice are not likely due to a dominant negative effect of the polyQ expanded transgene. The effects of Atro-118Q transgene may be due to a neomorphic function, or alternatively, hyperactivation of the normal transcription repressor function of Atrophin-1. Sodium Butyrate Treatment Ameliorates the Motor and Survival Defects in Atro-118Q Mice—Several HDAC inhibitors, such as SB and SAHA, have shown therapeutic effects in mouse models of HD and spinobulbar muscular atrophy (27Ferrante R.J.

SB administration in Atro-118Q mice provides an effective approach to test the effects of HDAC inhibitors on DRPLA. A daily dose of SB at 0.5, 1.5, or 4.5 mg/kg body weight was administrated to Atro-118Q14 mice starting from the age of 4 weeks via intraperitoneal injection. SB treatment at a dose of 0.5 or 1.5 mg/kg did not cause obvious adverse effects during the first week, but mice treated with 4.5 mg/kg SB failed to gain weight. Therefore, only the two lower doses were chosen for subsequent experiments. The effects of SB treatment were assessed by motor and survival assays. The rotarod performance of Atro-118Q mice was significantly improved after SB treatment at both doses, although the effect of the higher dose is more obvious (Fig. 4A). The high dose at 1.5 mg/kg significantly improved the performance from 5 to 9 weeks of age. The low dose at 0.5 mg/kg also improved rotarod performance, but only from 5 to 6 weeks of age. The hanging wire test also indicated the ameliorative effects of SB treatment on Atro-118Q mice from the age of 7 to 9 weeks (Fig. 4B). Therefore, SB treatment delayed the onset of motor impairments in Atro-118Q mice. We also tested the effects of SB treatment on nontransgenic mice. The high dose at 1.5 mg/kg did not change the performance of nontransgenic mice when compared with PBS-treated mice (data not shown). SB treatment not only improved the performance of Atro-118Q mice in the behavioral assays but also extended their average life span. SB treatment (1.5 mg/kg) starting from 4 weeks of age increased the average life span of Atro-118Q mice 13.7% over that of PBS-treated mice (Fig. 4C). As described above (Fig. 4, A and B), early-onset SB treatment (from 4 weeks old) significantly improved the motor performance of Atro-118Q mice from 5 to 9 weeks old. However, SB-treated mice had similar levels of motor impairments as PBS-treated mice after 12 weeks of age. We thus asked whether late-onset SB treatment starting from 12 weeks old, when the motor impairments are fully developed, could also suppress or reverse the motor defects in Atro-118Q mice. Our results showed that late-onset SB treatment (1.5 mg/kg) could not improve motor performance in Atro-118Q mice (data not shown). However, late-onset treatment had a beneficial effect on the survival of Atro-118Q mice, as it did extend the average life span of these mice, which was 21.5% longer than that of PBS-treated mice (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that late-onset SB treatment may be effective in antagonizing polyQ toxicity after the development of behavioral impairments. Comparing the somal size of neurons in dentate cerebellar nucleus, we did not find obvious difference between SB-treated (1.5 mg/kg) and PBS-treated Atro-118Q14 mice (328.2 ± 5.2 μm2 for SB-treated group and 325.3 ± 8.5 μm2 for PBS-treated group). SB Treatment Suppresses Hypoacetylation of Histone H3 in Atro-118Q Mice—If the ameliorative effects of SB treatment result from its ability to inhibit HDACs, we expect that the SB treatment should have a direct effect on levels of histone acetylation. We tested this hypothesis by examining the acetylation of histone H3 using an antibody specific to acetylated histone H3. We found that histone H3 was hypoacetylated in Atro-118Q14 and Atro-118Q3(Tg/Tg) mice but not in Atro-118Q3 mice, and the acetylation level was inversely correlated with the phenotype severity in Atro-118 mice (Fig. 5,"

In addition, p38 MAP kinase can also be activated by an MKK-independent mechanism involving TAB-1 (TAK-1-binding protein)-mediated autophosphorylation. Although TAB-1-mediated p38 activation has been implicated in ischemic heart, the biological consequences and downstream signaling of TAB-1-mediated p38 activation in cardiomyocytes is largely unknown. We show here that TAB-1 expression leads to a significant induction of p38 autophosphorylation and consequent kinase activation in cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes. In contrast to MKK3-induced p38 kinase downstream effects, TAB-1-induced p38 kinase activation does not induce expression of pro-inflammatory genes, cardiac marker gene expression, or changes in cellular morphology. Rather, TAB-1 binds to p38 and prevents p38 nuclear localization. Furthermore, TAB-1 disrupts p38 interaction with MKK3 and redirects p38 localization in the cytosol. Consequently, TAB-1 expression antagonizes the downstream activity of p38 kinase induced by MKK3 and attenuates interleukin-1β-induced inflammatory gene induction in cardiomyocytes. These data suggest that TAB-1 can mediate MKK-independent p38 kinase activation while negatively modulating MKK-dependent p38 function. Our study not only redefines the functional role of TAB-1 in p38 kinase-mediated signaling pathways but also provides the first evidence that intracellular localization of p38 kinase and complex interaction dictates its downstream effects.

Activation of the p38 pathway is achieved by a cascade of phosphorylation events involving proximal upstream MAP kinase kinases, such as MKK3 and 6, and further upstream MAP kinase kinase kinases, such as TAK1 and ASK1 (3Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signalling. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of both threonine and tyrosine at a conserved TGY motif leads to p38 kinase activation. This phosphorylation is therefore used widely as a biochemical marker for p38 activation status (5Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol.

Through downstream kinases, such as MAP kinase-activated protein kinase (MAPKAP)-2/3 (MK2, MK3), MNK, and MSK1, p38 activity is also responsible for the phosphorylation of additional downstream targets that include cytosolic PLA2, heat shock proteins, and histone3/HMG-14 (3Ono K.

The onset of heart failure is tightly associated with an elevated inflammatory response, both in human failing hearts arising from a wide variety of etiologies and in several animal models of heart failure (13Dinarello C.A. Pomerantz B.J. Blood Purif. 2001; 19: 314-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 14Mann D.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In addition, p38 activation is also observed in heart in a variety of pathological conditions, including mechanical stimulation, neural-hormonal stimulation, and cardiac ischemia injury (15Force T. Hajjar R. Del Monte F. Rosenzweig A. Choukroun G. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 337-348PubMed Google Scholar, 16Bogoyevitch M.A. Cardiovasc.

Therefore, it has been speculated that p38 activation and subsequent inflammatory induction contribute to pathological changes in the process of heart failure (18Wang Y. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2001; 1: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Our recent studies also suggest a direct contribution of p38 activity to inflammatory induction, cardiac dysfunction, and pathological remodeling in heart (19Liao P. Wang S.Q. Wang S. Zheng M.

Circulation. 2005; 111: 2494-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition to MKK-dependent p38 kinase activation, an alternative pathway leading to p38 activation involving TAB-1 (TAK-1-binding protein) was recently identified (21Ge B. Gram H. Di Padova F. Huang B. New L. Ulevitch R.J. Luo Y. Han J. Science. 2002; 295: 1291-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Although TAB-1 was originally found to interact with and activate an upstream MAP kinase kinase kinase, TAK-1, Ge et al. (21Ge B. Gram H. Di Padova F. Huang B. New L. Ulevitch R.J. Luo Y. Han J. Science. 2002; 295: 1291-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) showed that TAB-1 can also directly bind to p38 and promote SB203580-sensitive, but MKK-independent, p38 autophosphorylation. Recently, Tanno et al. (22Tanno M. Bassi R. Gorog D.A. Saurin A.T. Jiang J. Heads R.J. Martin J.L. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Marber M.S. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) also implicated TAB-1 in p38 activation in ischemic mouse hearts with homozygous MKK3 null alleles, whereas Li et al. (23Li J. Miller E.J. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Russell III, R.R. Young L.H. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) showed an increase in TAB-1 recruitment by p38 in ischemia heart in response to activated AMP-activated protein kinase. Furthermore, TAB-1 expression induces p38α activation leading to IL-10 induction and ERK and IL-2 inhibition in anergic T-cells (24Ohkusu-Tsukada K. Tominaga N. Udono H. Yui K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6957-6966Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although TAB-1 is sufficient to activate p38 kinase in vitro (21Ge B. Gram H. Di Padova F. Huang B. New L. Ulevitch R.J. Luo Y. Han J. Science. 2002; 295: 1291-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) and is involved in p38 activation in cardiomyocytes and T-cells, other recent studies also suggest that TAB-1 might function as a negative feedback regulator between p38 and TAK-1 (25Cheung P.C. Campbell D.G. Nebreda A.R. Cohen P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5793-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 26Singhirunnusorn P. Suzuki S. Kawasaki N. Saiki I. Sakurai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7359-7368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Although increasing evidence suggests that TAB-1 participates in p38 signaling, the downstream effects of TAB-1-mediated p38 activity in stress signaling and gene regulation are unclear, particularly in comparison with MKK-induced p38 function. In this report, we demonstrate that TAB-1 expression in cultured neonatal cardiac myocytes is sufficient to induce p38 activity via autophosphorylation. However, TAB-1-mediated p38 activity does not lead to the classical downstream effects of p38 induced by MKK3 activation. In contrast, TAB-1 expression attenuates MKK3-induced downstream signaling, at least in part via competitive binding with p38, removal of p38 from the MKK3 signaling complex, and translocation of p38 to alternative intracellular compartments. Consequently, TAB-1 negatively modulates IL-1β-induced (MKK3/p38-mediated) inflammatory gene expression in cardiomyocytes. In contrast, knockdown of TAB-1 expression in wild-type MEF cells augments TNFα-induced COX-2 expression. These data clearly suggest that TAB-1 not only induces p38 kinase activation but also has an important role in modulating downstream effects, at least in part by altering p38 intracellular localization and complex interaction. Thus, this study reveals a novel mechanism of stress-MAP kinase regulation and demonstrates that downstream effects of p38 activation can be modulated by different upstream activators to yield distinct intracellular localization and complex interaction.

A full-length TAB-1 cDNA with a DsRed tag was subcloned by PCR into the pShuttle-CMV vector. The C-terminal truncation mutant TAB-1(333–504) with 3×FLAG tag was generated by PCR-mediated mutagenesis and subcloned into a modified pShuttle-CMV vector. A nuclear localization signal sequence coding for GPKKKRKVG was fused by PCR to the C termini of TAB-1 and TAB-1(333–504). Subsequently, recombinant adenoviruses were prepared as described (28Wang Y.

Other adenoviral expressing vectors, including AdvHA-MKK3bE, AdvGFP-P38α, AdvFLAG-dnp38α, AdvLacZ, and AdvGFP, were constructed as described previously (28Wang Y. Huang S. Sah V.P. Ross Jr., J.

Cell Culture—Neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes from 1–2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were isolated using a Percoll gradient method as described previously (28Wang Y. Huang S. Sah V.P. Ross Jr., J. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2161-2168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Cardiomyocytes were plated overnight in medium containing Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/medium 199 (4:1) supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 mm glutamine. Subsequently, cardiomyocytes were infected with adenoviruses at MOI between 10 and 100 (optimized by protein expression level of the transgene) and incubated for 48 h in serum free medium supplemented with 1% ITS (BD Biosciences). p38-specific inhibitor SB203580 (Calbiochem) or IL-1β (BD biosciences) was added into the culture medium, either 2 or 12 h after adenovirus infection, as indicated in specific experiments. HEK293, Cos-1, and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Wild-type MEF cells (C57Bl/6 background) were maintained in high-glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. MEF cells were seeded 1 day before transfection, and 3–5 μg of DNA was mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 200 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) for 30 min before the addition to the cells. After 24–48 h, the cells were incubated in a medium containing 100 μg/ml of hygromycin and further cultured for 2 weeks and pooled. Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and harvested in lysis buffer composed of 50 mm Tris·Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate 1 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a tablet mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Total cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4–12% gradient gels and immunoblotted with antibodies against GFP (Clontech), HA tag, TAB-1, TNFα (Santa Cruz), FLAG (Sigma), COX-2 (Cayman), GAPDH (Chemicon), p38, phospho-p38, MAPKAP2, phospho-MAPKAP2, and phospho-HSP27 (Cell Signaling), respectively. For immunoprecipitation, total cell extracts prepared as described above were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 beads (Sigma) overnight with gentle rocking at 4 °C. The beads were then extensively washed five times with lysis buffer and once with Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris·Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl) and then eluted with 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide in Tris-buffered saline. Eluted proteins were analyzed SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Real Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cultured neonatal cardiac myocytes 48 h after adenoviruses infection using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Five μg of RNA was used to reverse transcribe the first strand cDNA using Superscript first strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen). Then cDNA transcripts were quantified by iCycler iQ real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Each reaction was performed in duplicate, and the values were averaged to calculate the relative expression level. The specific primers for quantitative PCR were: COX-2, 5′-CCAGATGCTATCTTTGGGGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGCCTTTTGATTAGTACTGTAGGG-3′ (antisense); ANF, 5′-CTGATGGATTTCAAGAACCTGCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTCTGGGCTCCAATCCTGTC-3′ (antisense); and GAPDH, 5′-TCCTGCACCACCAACTGCTTAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GATGACCTTGCCCACAGCCTTG-3′ (antisense). Immunostaining and Fluorescence Microscopy—Cardiomyocytes and Cos-1 cells were cultured on 12-mm coverslips coated with 10 μg/ml Laminin (Invitrogen). 48 h after adenoviral infection, the cells were washed with PBS, fixed for 5 min with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeablized for 5 min with 0.2% Triton X-100, and then blocked in PBS for 1 h with 3% bovine serum albumin and 5% donkey serum. The cells were then stained with primary antibodies and secondary antibodies diluted in 3% bovine serum albumin and 1% donkey serum in PBS for 2 h, respectively. The primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-rat ANF antiserum (Peninsula Laboratory) (1:1000), rabbit anti-HA polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) (1:1000), and mouse anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) (1:5000). Secondary antibodies include Alexa568-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa568-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG, and Alexa640-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes). F-actin was probed with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Fluorescence images were obtained with a laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus Fluoview) and analyzed with MetaMorph (Universal Imaging Corp.) and Auto Deblur (AutoQuant). The co-localization and the proximity of proteins were analyzed using custom made software described in Fig. 7. TAB-1 Induces p38 Activity via Autophosphorylation in Cultured Rat Myocytes—Rat neonatal ventricular cardiomyocytes (RNVC) have very low level expression of endogenous TAB-1, based on Western blotting. They have an abundant level of p38α protein, mostly in inactive form under basal condition (Fig. 1). These cells present a good model system to investigate the functional effect of TAB-1 on p38 kinase signaling. We expressed human wild-type, full-length TAB-1 in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes via a recombinant adenovirus vector. TAB-1 expression leads to significant activation of the p38 kinase, as determined either by anti-phospho-p38 immunoblotting or by ATF-2 phosphorylation activity of p38 immunocomplexes (Fig. 1). p38 phosphorylation is partially blocked by p38 kinase-selective inhibitor SB203580 (Fig. 1A), in good agreement with previous observations suggesting that TAB-1-mediated p38 activation involves autophosphorylation (21Ge B. Gram H. Di Padova F. Huang B. New L. Ulevitch R.J. Luo Y. Han J. Science. 2002; 295: 1291-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). A splicing variant of TAB-1 (TAB-1β) containing both the p38-binding domain and the protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C)-like domain but lacking the TAK-1-binding domain (27Ge B. Xiong X. Jing Q. Mosley J.L. Filose A. Bian D. Huang S. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2286-2293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) also activates p38 kinase as reported (21Ge B. Gram H. Di Padova F. Huang B. New L. Ulevitch R.J. Luo Y. Han J. Science. 2002; 295: 1291-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). All of these results suggest that TAB-1 induces bona fide p38 kinase activation in a SB203580-sensitive manner via autophosphorylation. TAB-1 Does Not Induce p38 Downstream Signaling Events Associated with MKK3-p38 Activation—Expression of MKK3bE, an activated mutant of the p38 upstream activating kinase, in RNVC cells results in significant activation of p38 kinase activity as determined by phospho-p38-specific Western blot (Fig. 2A) (28Wang Y. Huang S. Sah V.P. Ross Jr., J. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2161-2168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). As a consequence, TNFα and COX-2 expression are induced at both the protein and mRNA levels (Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, cardiac ANF gene expression is induced, and myofilament organization is enhanced as part of the p38-mediated stress response as reported previously (28Wang Y. Huang S. Sah V.P. Ross Jr., J. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2161-2168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, C and D). In contrast, TAB-1 expression in RNVC cells does not activate any of these well established p38 downstream responses or target gene induction in cardiomyocytes, despite the fact that comparable levels of p38 activation by MKK3bE and TAB-1 are achieved (Fig. 2). TAB-1 Antagonizes MKK3-mediated p38 Downstream Signals—We further investigated the impact of TAB-1 expression on the downstream signaling of p38 kinase in RNVC cells. As shown in Fig. 3A, MKK3bE expression induces phosphorylation of downstream kinase MAPKAPK-2 (MK2) and HSP27 as expected and SB203580 (10 μm) significantly reduces MK2 and HSP27 phosphorylation without affecting the total p38 phosphorylation level (Fig. 3A). In contrast, TAB-1 expression does not result in any significant MK2 or HSP27 phosphorylation (Fig. 3B), suggesting that TAB-1-mediated p38 activation does not induce previously characterized downstream signaling. Furthermore, co-expression of TAB-1 with MKK3bE significantly reduces MK2 and HSP27 phosphorylation, without reducing the total level of phosphorylated p38 (Fig. 3B). TAB-1 also attenuates MKK3bE-induced COX-2 expression (Fig. 3C), further supporting the notion that TAB-1 antagonizes MKK3-dependent p38 downstream activity. We also investigated whether TAB-1 binding to p38 was required for the observed antagonistic activity toward MKK3-induced downstream signaling. When co-expressed in RNVC cells, the full-length TAB-1 and C-terminal fragment (333–504) of TAB-1 can be readily detected in immunocomplexes with p38α following immunoprecipitation using anti-p38 antibodies (Fig. 4A). In contrast, no binding activity can be detected with the TAB-1 N-terminal fragment (residues 1–373), which contains a PP-2C-like domain, confirming the previous finding (21Ge B. Gram H. Di Padova F. Huang B. New L. Ulevitch R.J. Luo Y. Han J. Science. 2002; 295: 1291-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) that the binding motif for p38 is located in the C-terminal domain of TAB-1. Expression of the TAB-1 C-terminal (residues 333–504) fragment shows no ability to induce p38 phosphorylation but does retain potent inhibitory activity for MKK3bE-induced phosphorylation of MK2 and HSP27 (Fig. 4B). In contrast, expression of the TAB-1 N-terminal (1–373) fragment has neither activity for p38 phosphorylation nor any impact on downstream signaling in response to activated MKK3bE (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that, although both N- and C-terminal domains of TAB-1 are required to activate p38 kinase activity, only the C-terminal TAB-1 containing p38-binding domain is both necessary and sufficient to antagonize MKK3-mediated p38 downstream signaling. TAB-1 Binds to p38 and Excludes p38 from the Nucleus—To determine why the TAB-1/p38 interaction down-regulates MKK3-induced downstream signaling, we investigated the effect of TAB-1 on the intracellular localization of p38 kinase. For these experiments, we used a p38-GFP fusion protein as a reporter. In RNVC cells, p38-GFP and HA-MKK3bE are located both in nuclei and in specific reticular patterned structures in the cytosol (Fig. 5A, panels a and b). In contrast, a TAB-1-RFP fusion protein is detectable exclusively in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus (Fig. 5A, panel c). Co-expression of HA-MKK3bE and p38-GFP demonstrates extensive overlapping of their intracellular distribution in both cytosol and nuclear compartments (Fig. 5A, panels d–f). In contrast, co-expression of TAB-1-RFP with p38-GFP excludes p38-GFP from the nucleus and retains the kinase only in the cytosol (Fig. 5A, panels g–i). This result suggests that TAB-1 is a cytosol localized protein and that TAB-1 expression can alter the intracellular location of p38.FIGURE 5Intracellular localization of p38α is regulated by TAB-1 and MKK3bE. A, immunofluorescent confocal images were acquired from RNVC expressing GFP-p38a (panel a, green), HA-MKK3bE (panel b, red), and TAB-1-RFP (panel c, red), showing their respective intracellular localization patterns. Panels d–f are images from RNVC co-expressing GFP-p38 and HA-MKK3bE, visualized for GFP (panel d) or HA (panel e) or merged (panel f). Panels g–i are images from RNVC co-expressing GFP-p38 and TAB-1-RFP visualized for GFP (panel g), RFP (panel h), or merged (panel i). B, schematic showing the structure of TAB-1 and the TAB-1(333–504) N-terminal truncation mutant modified to carry a nuclear localization signal. A nuclei localization sequence and a 3×FLAG tag were fused to the C terminus of TAB-1 and TAB-1(333–504) by PCR as described under “Materials and Methods.” C, in vivo binding of nuclear targeted TAB-1 mutants with endogenous p38. TAB-NLS-FLAG and TAB-1(333–504)-NLS-FLAG were transiently expressed in HeLa cells. Immunoprecipitation from the total cell extracts with M2 anti-FLAG antibody was followed by immunoblot with anti-FLAG or anti-p38 antibodies as indicated. D, immunofluorescent confocal images of GFP-p38α (panel a), TAB-1-NLS-FLAG (panel b) and TAB-1(333–504)-NLS-FLAG (panel c) were shown in RNVC after Adv-mediated expression. Images of nuclei-targeted TAB-1 mutants (panels e and h) and GFP-p38α (panels d and g) were also visualized individually or merged (panels f and i) in RNVC co-expressing GFP-p38α with either TAB-1-NLS-FLAG (panels d–f) or TAB-1(333–504)-NLS-FLAG (panels g–i). E, immunoblot of protein samples from cells expressing TAB-1-NLX-FLAG, TAB-1(333–504)-NLS-FLAG or MKK3bE (as labeled on top) using antibodies for MKK3, TAB-1, p-HSP27, MAPKAP2, and COX-2 as indicated. MW(kd), molecular mass (in kDa).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further demonstrate that TAB-1 can directly modulate p38 intracellular distribution, we generated nucleus-targeted mutants of TAB-1 (TAB-1-NLS-FLAG) and the TAB-1(333–504) C-terminal fragment (TAB-1(333–504)-NLS-FLAG) by adding a nuclear localization signal at the C-terminal of the coding regions (Fig. 5B). The nucleus-targeted TAB-1 and the TAB-1 C-terminal fragment retain p38 binding activity in cells, as determined from co-immunoprecipitation assays (Fig. 5C) and are effectively targeted to nuclei in cardiomyocytes (Fig. 5D, panels b and c). Co-expression of p38α-GFP with either nucleus-targeted TAB-1 or the nucleus-targeted TAB-1 C-terminal fragment results in nearly complete co-localization of p38 and TAB-1 in the nucleus (Fig. 5D, panels d–i). Despite their ability to target p38 into nucleus, both proteins fail to induce p38 downstream signaling, as measured by MK2 phosphorylation HSP27 phosphorylation or COX-2 expression (Fig. 5E). These data demonstrate clearly that (i) the wild-type TAB-1 protein is exclusively localized in the cytosol, (ii) TAB-1 can modulate the subcellular localization of p38 via direct interaction, and (iii) TAB-1 is not sufficient to activate p38 downstream, even if it is targeted to the nucleus. TAB-1 Modulates p38 Intracellular Distribution and the Interaction of p38 with MKK3—The above results suggest that TAB-1 not only modulates p38 intracellular localization but also changes the MKK-mediated downstream effects of p38. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we analyzed the effects of TAB-1 expression on the protein-protein interaction between p38 and its upstream activating kinase MKK3. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrates that TAB-1 expression significantly reduces p38 binding to MKK3 in COS-1 cells (Fig. 6). Supporting this finding, intracellular localization of MKK3bE and p38α were analyzed by immunofluorescent confocal microscopy (Figs. 7, panels a–f). The protein proximity index analyses of these images (Fig. 7, panels m and n) indicate a highly significant degree of overlap between MKK3bE and p38α-GFP proteins (Fig. 7, panel q). However, in the presence of TAB-1, p38 is retained in the cytosol where its co-localization with MKK3 is significantly disrupted (Fig. 4B, panels g–l). The MKK3/p38 protein proximity index changes from 0.96 ± 0.02 to 0.59 ± 0.04 (mean ± S.E., n = 6, p < 0.001) when TAB-1 is co-expressed (Fig. 7, panel q). As shown more clearly in the high magnitude images (Fig. 7, panels d–f and j–k), p38α-GFP and MKK3bE both have a reticular distribution pattern in the cytosol. However, in the presence of TAB-1, the degree of overlap is substantially reduced (illustrated by the appearance of red and green areas). Therefore, both immunoprecipitation and co-localization analysis provide clear evidence that TAB-1 directly competes with MKK3 for p38 protein binding and restricts p38 intracellular distribution in the cytosol to a specific compartment away from the MKK3 kinase. All of these observations, along with previous functional studies, suggest a previously unknown mechanism in p38 kinase regulation in which different upstream activators can dictate the downstream signaling of p38 kinase by modulating its intracellular localization and complex interactions. TAB-1 Modulates Cytokine-induced Inflammatory Gene Expression— p38 is known to mediate cytokine-induced inflammatory gene expression, such as COX-2, in cultured cardiac myocytes (12Degousee N. Martindale J. Stefanski E. Cieslak M. Lindsay T.F. Fish J.E. Marsden P.A. Thuerauf D.J. Glembotski C.C. Rubin B.B. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To investigate the functional significance of TAB-1/p38 interaction in inflammatory gene regulation, we determined the effect of TAB-1 p38 binding activity on IL-1β induced COX-2 expression. As shown in Fig. 8, IL-1β potently induces COX-2 expression in cultured myocytes infected with a control AdvGFP vector. In contrast, COX-2 induction is significantly attenuated by the TAB-1 C-terminal fragment (333–504) (Fig. 8), which contains only the p38-binding motif but lacks p38 autophosphorylation activity (Fig. 4). The ability of TAB-1·p38 complex to inhibit COX-2 expression is correlated with an inhibition of MK2 phosphorylation. However, the level of total p38 activity, as measured by p38 phosphorylation, is not affected. To further investigate the functional role of TAB-1 in cytokine-mediated signaling, we studied mouse embryonic fibroblast in which significant endogenous TAB-1 is present (Fig. 9A). Two MEF cell lines are established using different small interfering RNAs against endogenous TAB-1 mRNA. As shown in Fig. 9A, TAB-1 protein expression is significantly lowered in both small interfering RNA-treated MEF cell lines. TNFα-induced COX-2 expression is augmented in TAB-1 knockdown MEF cells compared with the control cells (Fig. 9B). Similar results are observed using anisomycin as an alternative p38 activator (data not shown). Therefore, both gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies support a potentially important role for TAB-1 as a signaling modulator in inflammatory response. Stress-activated MAP kinase p38 is a highly conserved signaling molecule responsible for a variety of stress responses in different mammalian cells. Like other MAP kinase family members, the p38 kinase catalytic activity is activated by upstream MAP kinase kinases, including MKK3, MKK6, and, with lesser specificity, by MKK4 (3Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signalling. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar, 6Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3537) Google Scholar). p38 activation is implicated in many critical cellular functions, including gene regulation, apoptosis, energy metabolism, cellular differentiation, and proliferation, presumably via an array of downstream target molecules (4Shi Y. Gaestel M. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1519-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear how these diverse downstream signaling pathways are regulated in response to a variety of different stimuli that activate p38 kinase activity. Our data suggest that TAB-1 is not only a MKK3-independent activator of p38 MAP kinase but is also a potent modulator of p38 intracellular localization and p38 signal complex formation in the cytosol. By competing with MKK3 for p38 binding, TAB-1 antagonizes MKK3-mediated activation of downstream kinases and, consequently, inflammatory gene induction. Our observations demonstrate that the differential intracellular localization of activated p38 MAP kinase can be dictated by two different upstream molecules, MKK3 versus TAB-1, and result in dramatically different downstream consequences. Thus, the modulating effect of TAB-1 may offer a potentially important molecular mechanism contributing to the fine tuning and the functional diversity of p38 pathways in mammalian cells. Our study redefines the role of TAB-1 in p38 regulation. TAB-1β, a splicing variant of TAB-1 lacking the TAK-1-binding motif (27Ge B. Xiong X. Jing Q. Mosley J.L. Filose A. Bian D. Huang S. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2286-2293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), has the same capacity as full-length TAB-1 to activate p38 kinase activity in cardiomyocytes. Truncated N- and C-terminal portions of TAB-1 that lack either the p38-binding domain or PP2C-like domain do not activate p38 kinase activity. Therefore, the p38 MAP kinase-binding motif and the PP2C-like domain of TAB-1 are both required for p38 activation in cardiomyocytes as reported (21Ge B. Gram H. Di Padova F. Huang B. New L. Ulevitch R.J. Luo Y. Han J. Science. 2002; 295: 1291-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). In contrast, the C-terminal portion of TAB-1(333–504) containing the p38-binding motif is sufficient to retain p38 in the cytosol, dictates the intracellular distribution of p38, and inhibits MKK3-mediated signaling. In the cytosol, TAB-1 and MKK3 direct p38 into different intracellular compartments with distinct localizations. Therefore, TAB-1 can function both as an activator and a tethering factor for p38 kinase. Activation of p38 by TAB-1 requires both p38 binding and PP2c-like domain of TAB-1, whereas tethering requires only the C-terminal domain containing the p38-binding motif. The potent inhibitory function of TAB-1 (333–504) for MKK3-mediated signaling indicates clearly that TAB-1/p38 interaction is both necessary and sufficient to modulate p38 downstream signaling. It seems likely that TAB-1-mediated changes in p38 kinase cellular localization contribute to the previously reported negative feedback function for TAB-1 in p38 signaling (25Cheung P.C. Campbell D.G. Nebreda A.R. Cohen P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5793-5805Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). A significant number of scaffold proteins have been identified for MAP kinase signaling cascades, all of which possess the hallmark of interacting with multiple components of the kinase signaling complex (29Morrison D.K. Davis R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 91-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Some of them, including KSR, MP1, JIP-1, and JIP2, can target MAP kinase complexes to specific subcellular locations, such as plasma membrane, late endosome, or kinesin cargo (transport vehicles) (30Morrison D.K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1609-1612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hancock J.F. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 32Singhirunnusorn P. Suzuki S.

Sci. 2001; 26: 545-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, unlike TAB-1, none of them has an intrinsic activation function toward the targeted protein kinases. In addition, local signaling complex interaction appears to be critical to achieve spatio-temporal regulation of other protein kinases, including cAMP-dependent protein kinase, protein kinase C, and tyrosine kinases, as revealed by genetic fluorescent probes (34Kunkel M.T.

Indeed, nuclear localized TAB-1 fails to activate p38 downstream signaling, suggesting that TAB-1 and MKK form different signaling complexes for p38. TAB-1 appears to be a unique signaling molecule that functions both as an upstream MKK-independent activator of p38 activity and as a scaffold protein that modulates the intracellular localization and signal complex interaction of the activated p38 kinase. TAB-1 gene inactivation leads to an embryonic lethal phenotype with impaired TGF-β signaling and cardiovascular defects (39Komatsu Y. Shibuya H. Takeda N. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yasui T. Miyado K. Sekimoto T. Ueno N. Matsumoto K. Yamada G. Mech. Dev. 2002; 119: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), suggesting a vital role of TAB-1 in cardiovascular development and function. However, the specific role of TAB-1 in p38-mediated function versus TGF-β/TAK-1 signaling in heart or other cell systems is unknown. Tanno et al. (22Tanno M. Bassi R. Gorog D.A. Saurin A.T. Jiang J.

Li et al. (23Li J. Miller E.J. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Russell III, R.R. Young L.H. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) also recently reported some interesting observations on AMP-activated protein kinase-mediated p38 activation that involves TAB-1. The data from this study indicate that these different mechanisms of p38 activation would lead to distinct downstream signaling events. Although a negative modulating role of TAB-1 for MKK3-mediated signaling has been clearly demonstrated in our study, the selective downstream effect of TAB-1-mediated p38 activity in the cytosol remains unclear and requires further studies. Given the diverse roles of p38 in various cellular functions, it is conceivable that TAB-1-mediated p38 activity is responsible for a specific subset of these activities. In fact, early studies from our laboratory and from others have demonstrated a potent negative inotrophic effect of p38 activity on cardiomyocyte contractility (19Liao P. Wang S.Q. Wang S. Zheng M. Zhang S.J. Cheng H. Wang Y. Xiao R.P. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and cytokine release (20Li M. Georgakopoulos D. Lu G. Hester L. Kass D.A. Hasday J. Wang Y. Circulation. 2005; 111: 2494-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) in addition to gene regulation. Clearly, although our study implicates a negative modulatory role for TAB-1 in the p38 kinase pathway, further studies are needed to identify the specific downstream effect of TAB-1-induced p38 kinase activity and its physiological implication in normal and pathological stress responses.

Despite this, little is known about mechanisms of Zn2+ transport into β-cells or the regulation and compartmentalization of Zn2+ within this cell type. Evidence suggests that Zn2+ in part enters neurons and myocytes through specific voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC). Using a Zn2+-selective fluorescent dye with high affinity and quantum yield, FluoZin-3 AM and the plasma membrane potential dye DiBAC4(3) we applied fluorescent microscopy techniques for analysis of Zn2+-accumulating pathways in mouse islets, dispersed islet cells, and β-cell lines (MIN6 and β-TC6f7 cells). Because the stimulation of insulin secretion is associated with cell depolarization, Zn2+ (5-10 μm) uptake was analyzed under basal (1 mm glucose) and stimulatory (10-20 mm glucose, tolbutamide, tetraethylammonium, and high K+) conditions. Under both basal and depolarized states, β-cells were capable of Zn2+ uptake, and switching from basal to depolarizing conditions resulted in a marked increase in the rate of Zn2+ accumulation. Importantly, L-type VGCC (L-VGCC) blockers (verapamil, nitrendipine, and nifedipine) as well as nonspecific inhibitors of Ca2+ channels, Gd3+ and La3+, inhibited Zn2+ uptake in β-cells under stimulatory conditions with little or no change in Zn2+ accumulation under low glucose conditions. To determine the mechanism of VGCC-independent Zn2+ uptake the expression of a number of ZIP family Zn2+ transporter mRNAs in islets and β-cells was investigated. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that, in part, Zn2+ transport into β-cells takes place through the L-VGCC. Our investigation demonstrates direct Zn2+ accumulation in insulin-secreting cells by two pathways and suggests that the rate of Zn2+ transport across the plasma membrane is dependent upon the metabolic status of the cell.

Our investigation demonstrates direct Zn2+ accumulation in insulin-secreting cells by two pathways and suggests that the rate of Zn2+ transport across the plasma membrane is dependent upon the metabolic status of the cell. Zinc is an important trace element in living organisms, and it plays a key role in many biological processes (1Prasad A.S. Nutrition. 1995; 11: 93-99PubMed Google Scholar, 2Berg J.M. Shi Y.G. Science. 1996; 271: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions the concentration of free Zn2+ in cells is extremely low (3Emdin S.O. Dodson G.G. Cutfield J.M. Cutfield S.M. Diabetologia. 1980; 19: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, the total intracellular Zn2+ concentration can reach 150-200 μm (4Outten C.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 2001; 292: 2488-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar, 5Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). A low concentration of Zn2+ in the cytoplasm is maintained by Zn2+-buffering systems such as metallothioneins and by compartmentalization into intracellular vesicles (6Hamer D.H. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 913-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. Biometals. 2001; 14: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Regulation of Zn2+ metabolism in cells can also include plasma membrane Zn2+ transporters that can have opposite roles in cellular Zn2+ homeostasis. The Zip (Zrt/Irt-related protein) family of metal ion transporters facilitates Zn2+ uptake from the extracellular space or the lumen of intracellular organelles into the cytoplasm, whereas the ZnT (zinc transporter) family of transporters promotes Zn2+ efflux from cells or into various intracellular compartments (8Liuzzi J.P. Cousins R.J. Ann. Rev. Nutr. 2004; 24: 151-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 9Palmiter R.D. Huang L.P. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J.

In pancreatic β-cells a fraction of the intracellular Zn2+ pool is stored with insulin in vesicles as a complex of Zn2+-insulin with a stoichiometry of 2:1 (3Emdin S.O. Dodson G.G. Cutfield J.M. Cutfield S.M. Diabetologia. 1980; 19: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). During exocytosis Zn2+ is released together with insulin into the extracellular medium. The concentration of Zn2+ in insulin-containing vesicles of β-cells is ∼20 mm (11Foster M.C. Leapman R.D. Li M.X. Atwater I. Biophys. J. 1993; 64: 525-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 12Hutton J.C. Penn E.J. Peshavaria M. Biochem. J. 1983; 210: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Thus during exocytosis Zn2+ is released from vesicles into the extracellular space and, because of the increase of Zn2+, it can be transported back into the host cell or into neighboring cells (13Franklin I. Gromada J. Gjinovci A. Theander S. Wollheim C.B. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 1808-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar).

Studies conducted several years ago, demonstrated the possibility of differential mechanisms of Zn2+ uptake into rat pancreatic islets under basal and stimulatory conditions and suggested that Zn2+ may be required for metabolic processes in addition to insulin crystallization (25Ludvigsen C. Mcdaniel M. Lacy P.E. Diabetes. 1979; 28: 570-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 26Figlewicz D.P. Formby B. Hodgson A.T. Schmid F.G. Grodsky G.M. Diabetes. 1980; 29: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The precise subcellular localization and distribution of Zn2+ in islets is also under debate. Histological data in fixed cells have shown mainly granular localization of Zn2+ (27Falkmer S. Pihl E. Diabetologia. 1968; 4: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 28Yokoh S. Aoji O. Matsuno Z. Yoshida H. Diabetologia. 1969; 5: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), whereas experiments with fractionation of islets have demonstrated that only 20-30% of the total islet Zn2+ was associated with the granular fraction (26Figlewicz D.P.

Experientia. 1984; 40: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Given the significance of Zn2+ for proinsulin biosynthesis and exocytosis, understanding the mechanisms of its uptake into islet cells is important. Dys-regulation of the Zn2+ transport system may result in secretory defects and contribute to β-cell dysfunction associated with type-2 diabetes (30Chausmer A.B. J. Am. Coll. Nutr. 1998; 17: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). It is also known that Zn2+ can induce oxidative damage (31Aizenman E. Stout A.K. Harnett K.A. Dineley K.E. McLaughlin B.

Reviews. 1999; 20: 101-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Here glucose metabolism increases the ATP/ADP ratio resulting in the closure of KATP channels, which in turn depolarizes the plasma membrane and opens L-VGCCs. This event leads to an acceleration of Ca2+ influx through the L-VGCCs (43Ashcroft F.M. Proks P. Smith P.A. Ammala C. Bokvist K. Rorsman P. J. Cell.

Insulin stored in secretory vesicles is released in response to an elevation of intracellular Ca2+. Plasma membrane depolarization and increase in intracellular Ca2+ also result in the opening of voltage-dependent K+ (KV) and Ca2+-sensitive voltage-dependent K+ (KCa) channels, which restore an outward flow of K+, thereby repolarizing of the cell membrane and closing the VGCC (39Henquin J.C.

It has been demonstrated that Zn2+ entry into heart cells can take place via dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca2+ channels (20Atar D. Backx P.H. Appel M.M. Gao W.D. Marban E. J. Biol.

J. 2003; 375: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Recently a new Zn2+-selective fluorescent dye, FluoZin-3, was introduced as a probe for Zn2+ detection (46Gee K.R. Zhou Z.L. Ton-That D. Sensi S.L. Weiss J.H. Cell Calcium. 2002; 31: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). FluoZin-3 binds Zn2+ with very high affinity (KD = 15 nm), and it has much higher quantum yield than other Zn2+-sensitive dyes previously used (46Gee K.R. Zhou Z.L. Ton-That D. Sensi S.L. Weiss J.H. Cell Calcium. 2002; 31: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). We employed a cell-permeant form of the dye, FluoZin-3 AM, to elucidate the Zn2+-transporting pathways in the β-cell lines MIN6 and β-TC6f7 (β-TC), mouse islets, and dispersed islet cells. We observed that Zn2+ uptake into β-cells occurred through two distinct pathways, one involving the plasma membrane Zn2+ transporter under basal (low glucose/hyperpolarized) conditions and another through L-VGCC during the depolarization of the plasma membrane. Our data suggest that Zn2+ entry into β-cells is linked to the metabolic status of the cell. Under stimulatory conditions, Zn2+ entry is mediated through the L-type VGCC, whereas under basal conditions its uptake is independent of this channel and possibly dependent on the ZIP family of transporters. To this end we demonstrate by real time PCR analysis the expression of Zip1, Zip2, Zip3, Zip4, Zip5, Zip8, Zip9, Zip10, and Zip14 mRNA in MIN6 cells and mouse islets, with Zip1 and Zip8 being the most abundantly expressed transcripts in MIN6 cells and Zip1 in islets. Reagents—Fluorescent dyes FluoZin-3 AM, bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid)trimethine oxonol (DiBAC4(3)), tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM), Hoechst 33342 were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Dispase II (neutral protease) was from Roche Diagnostics. Pyrithione, N,N,N′,N′,-tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl)-ethylenediamine (TPEN), verapamil, nifedipine, nitrendipine, tolbutamide, tetraethylammonium (TEA), Gd3+, La3+, collagenase, collagen, poly(l-lysine), and poly(l-ornithine) were from Sigma-Aldrich. MIN6 and β-TC Cells—MIN6 insulinoma cells (passages 35-45), a gift from Dr. S. Seino (Chiba University), were cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 μl/500 ml β-mercaptoethanol at 37 °C and 5% CO2-95% air. β-TC insulinoma cells (passages 40-45), a gift from Dr. S. Efrat (Albert Einstein University), were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, 5.6 mm glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Culture medium in both cell lines was changed every 48 h, and cells were grown in monolayer to 80-90% confluence. For fluorescent measurements confluent cell cultures were lifted using treatment by EDTA (0.5 mm)/trypsin (0.05%) solution. The harvested cells were centrifuged, and the pellet was diluted in culture medium and plated on glass coverslips. For experiments coverslips with MIN6 cells were maintained in culture medium for 1-3 days. Experiments with β-TC cells were performed typically 1-2 days after plating. Pancreatic Islets—Islets were isolated from C57BL/6 mice as described previously (47Lacy P.E. Kostianovsky M. Diabetes. 1967; 16: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar, 48Zhang C.Y.

Briefly, mice were anesthetized, and the pancreatic duct was perfused with RPMI 1640 containing type V collagenase (0.8 mg/ml) and bovine serum albumin (2%). The pancreas was then removed and digested for 12 min at 37 °C. Islets were subsequently picked by hand, transferred to fresh medium, and maintained at 37 °C. The islets were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% bovine serum, 11.1 mm glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The islets were plated on glass coverslips coated with collagen, poly(l-lysine) or poly(l-ornithine) and maintained in culture medium for 1-2 days. Dispersed Islet Cells—To obtain dispersed cells, isolated islets were incubated for 10 min in Ca2+-free phosphate-buffered solution, supplemented with 2 mm EGTA, 3 mm glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Islets were then centrifuged and incubated with dispase II for 10 min at 37 °C for digestion, followed by the addition of RPMI 1640 medium with 11.1 mm glucose, 10% bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The suspension was centrifuged, and the pellet resuspended in the same medium. The cells were plated on glass coverslips coated with poly(l-lysine) and maintained in culture for 1-3 days. Conventional Fluorescent Measurements—For fluorescent measurements the incubation and perfusion buffer had the following composition: 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaHCO3, 200 nm TPEN, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, or the same medium without Ca2+. In selected experiments, to depolarize the cells, 50 mm NaCl was replaced with 50 mm KCl. Fluorescent experiments were carried out using an Olympus BX51W1 fluorescent microscope fitted with 20x/0.95 water immersion objective and cooled CCD camera equipped with magnification changer (U-TVCAC, Olympus). For excitation a xenon lamp-based DeltaRam high speed monochromator from Photon Technology International (PTI, Lawrenceville, NJ) was used. For the control of the monochromator and videocamera, as well as for fluorescent imaging and collection of the data, ImageMaster 3.0 software (PTI) was used. For experiments, the cells or islets were transferred to an open chamber, placed on the microscope stage, and perfused at 1 ml/min. All time-dependent experiments were performed at 36-37 °C using TC-324B Heater Controller (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). In static experiments a Delta T culture dish controller (Bioptechs, Butler, PA) was used for heating. 1-30 cells or 1-2 islets were analyzed per coverslip. Measurement of Zn2+ and Plasma Membrane Potential (ΔΨP)—For Zn2+ measurements coverslips with MIN6, β-TC, dispersed islet cells, or islets were loaded with 2 μm FluoZin-3 AM for 50 min in incubation buffer in the presence of low glucose (1 mm) at 37 °C and 5% CO2-95% air. The cells or islets were subsequently incubated for 10 min in the same conditions without dye. The fluorescence of FluoZin-3 AM was excited at 480 nm and emission measured with 525 nm band pass filter using 505 nm beam splitter. We examined the response profile of dispersed islet cells, loaded with FluoZin-3 AM and exposed to sequential perfusion with Zn2+. Tominimize background Zn2+ level in these experiments all chemicals used for the buffer were of highest purity, and the water was of HPLS grade (Sigma). However, perfusion of cells with the Zn2+ ionophore pyrithione in the absence of Zn2+ led to a considerable increase of fluorescence, due to the presence of Zn2+ traces. To avoid this initial pyrithione-induced increase in fluorescence 200-300 nm Zn2+ chelator TPEN was added in the buffer. In this case, perfusion with pyrithione in the absence of Zn2+ led to a slight increase of fluorescence. Experiments showed that perfusion even with 100 nm Zn2+ resulted in a significant increase of fluorescence (supplemental Fig. 1). Cell ΔΨP was measured using the negatively charged oxonol dye DiBAC4(3). Coverslips with cells or islets were loaded with 250 nm dye for 15 min at the same conditions as with FluoZin-3 AM. The perfusion solution contained the same concentration of oxonol dye. The excitation wavelength was 470 nm, and emission was measured using a 525 nm band pass filter and 505 nm beam splitter. Although excitation wavelengths for FluoZin-3 and DiBAC4(3) were not optimal, we used them to avoid possible photobleaching and photodamaging effects. Also to minimize these effects, the shutter on the monochromator was closed for 3 s between each acquisition. Confocal Fluorescent Measurements—Confocal imaging was performed using a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning microscope. Coverslips with islets, dispersed cells, or MIN6 cells loaded with FluoZin-3 AM (2 μm), or co-loaded with FluoZin-3 AM and TMRM (100 nm), were transferred into the chamber and plated on the stage of the microscope fitted with a 40 × 0.75 water immersion objective. For both FluoZin-3 AM and TMRM excitation the 488 nm argon laser line was used, and emissions were acquired using fluorescein isothiocyanate and TRITC set of filters, respectively. The temperature was kept at 37 °C by warming the closed box surrounding the microscope stage with air. Samples were subjected to optical sectioning by moving the focal plane along the vertical (z) axis. The images were analyzed using Zeiss LSM Image Browser software. Deconvolution Fluorescent Microscopy—Coverslips with MIN6 cells co-loaded with FluoZin-3 AM (2 μm) and the DNA staining reagent Hoechst 33342 (1 μm) were transferred into the chamber and plated on the stage of the Axioplan 2 microscope fitted with a 40 × 0.75 water immersion objective. For Hoechst 33342 and FluoZin-3 AM excitation and emission, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and fluorescein isothiocyanate set of filters were used, respectively. The Zeiss Axiovision 3.0 software was used for deconvolution. Quantitative PCR for Zinc Transporters—Total RNA was isolated from MIN6 cells, mouse islets, and whole mouse brain using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following extraction, total RNA was treated with rDNase I (Ambion, Houston, TX), and first strand synthesis of cDNA was carried out using Superscript II RNase H reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting cDNA (10 ng/reaction or 2.5 ng/μl) was used for amplification in quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Serial dilutions of mouse genomic DNA were used for the generation of a standard curve (9, 3, 1, 0.33, and 0.11 ng and a nontemplate negative control). Briefly, genomic DNA or cDNA (4 μl/well) was added to a qPCR mixture (6 μl/well) containing the following components: 3.5 μl of water, 1 μl of 10× PCR buffer, 0.6 μl of 50 mm MgCl2, 0.2 μl of 50 μm Primer Mix (or 0.1 μl of forward and 0.1 μl of reverse), 0.2 μl of 10 mm dNTP mixture, 0.2 μl of ROX reference dye, 0.3 μl of SYBR green I (stock-diluted 1:1000 in water) and 0.025 μl (or 125 units) of platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). For PCR amplification the following general protocol was employed: 95 °C (3 min); 40 cycles of PCR: 95 °C (10 s), 65 °C (15 s), 72 °C (20 s); 95 °C (15 s), 60 °C (15 s), 95 °C (15 s). qPCR was performed in an ABI Prism 7900 HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Streetsville, ON, Canada). Gene-specific oligonucleotide primers were designed using the Primer Quest SciTool (Integrated DNA Technologies, Skokie, IL). Primer sequences are indicated in supplemental Table 1. The expression level of various Zip transcripts was calculated using the standard curve method (49Higuchi R. Fockler C. Dollinger G. Watson R. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 1026-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar). Values were normalized to mouse β-actin mRNA and represent the average of three independent experiments. Statistics—All experiments were repeated in three or more cell cultures or islets, and typical results are presented. The raw data were processed using PSI-PLOT. The time-dependent traces of MIN6, β-TC, and dispersed islet cell fluorescence are shown as mean value averaged from all investigated cells ± S.E. expressed as percentage of fluorescence compared with baseline (100%), which was taken as the mean level of fluorescence during the initial 1 min of the recording. In the case of islets the representative traces averaged from whole islet (global response) and from two randomly selected noncontiguous regions from periphery and the middle of islet are shown. In experiments shown in figures where the time-dependent traces are compared, the cells were from the same seeding, and islets were from the same isolation. Intracellular Zn2+ Distribution and Time-dependent Kinetics—In previous studies a cell-impermeable form of the dye FluoZin-3 tetrapotassium salt was used to monitor efflux of Zn2+ from the cells (50Qian W.J. Gee K.R. Kennedy R.T. Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 3468-3475Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In the present study we used the membrane-permeable FluoZin-3 AM to investigate the intracellular distribution and kinetics of Zn2+ accumulation into β-cell lines and islets. Fig. 1 shows differential interference contrast (DIC) (Fig. 1A) and fluorescent images (Fig. 1, B-D) of a single MIN6 cell stained with 2 μm FluoZin-3 AM. The image in Fig. 1B indicates a visible level of fluorescence after incubation in medium with low glucose and in Zn2+-free conditions, demonstrating the presence of endogenous Zn2+. Further addition of 10 μm Zn2+ to cells strongly increases the fluorescence intensity (Fig. 1C). Following treatment with the membrane-depolarizing agent tolbutamide, an inhibitor of the KATP channel, a further increase of fluorescence was observed (Fig. 1D). The corresponding profiles of fluorescence intensity along the line shown in Fig. 1A are presented under the images. Images Fig. 1, B-D and line profiles of fluorescence intensity demonstrate a nonuniform distribution of the fluorescent probe. As seen from the images, after incubation of the cells with Zn2+ (Fig. 1C) and then with tolbutamide (Fig. 1D), the whole-"
https://openalex.org/W2067043311,"Single site mutations in connexins have provided insights about the influence specific amino acids have on gap junction synthesis, assembly, trafficking, and functionality. We have discovered a single point mutation that eliminates functionality without interfering with gap junction formation. The mutation occurs at a threonine residue located near the cytoplasmic end of the third transmembrane helix. This threonine is strictly conserved among members of the α- and β-connexin subgroups but not the γ-subgroup. In HeLa cells, connexin43 and connexin26 mutants are synthesized, traffic to the plasma membrane, and make gap junctions with the same overall appearance as wild type. We have isolated connexin26T135A gap junctions both from HeLa cells and baculovirus-infected insect Sf9 cells. By using cryoelectron microscopy and correlation averaging, difference images revealed a small but significant size change within the pore region and a slight rearrangement of the subunits between mutant and wild-type connexons expressed in Sf9 cells. Purified, detergent-solubilized mutant connexons contain both hexameric and partially disassembled structures, although wild-type connexons are almost all hexameric, suggesting that the three-dimensional mutant connexon is unstable. Mammalian cells expressing gap junction plaques composed of either connexin43T154A or connexin26T135A showed an absence of dye coupling. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, these mutants, as well as a cysteine substitution mutant of connexin50 (connexin50T157C), failed to produce electrical coupling in homotypic and heteromeric pairings with wild type in a dominant-negative effect. This mutant may be useful as a tool for knocking down or knocking out connexin function in vitro or in vivo.

Gap junctions are one means by which cells communicate with each other and arise as tissue cells grow and abut each other. The morphologically distinctive cell-cell junctional areas allow the exchange of ions, nutrients, and small metabolites between neighboring cells. Gap junction structures are found throughout vertebrates and invertebrates, although the primary sequences of constituent proteins are different from each other even though electron micrographs and physiological assays indicate similar quaternary structure and functionality. Gap junctions are composed of two oligomeric channel structures called connexons, with each cell supplying one connexon that docks with the other at their extracellular surfaces. The connexin family of proteins has a very conserved protein folding topology with highly conserved transmembrane and extracellular primary sequences, but contains variable regions of the cytoplasmic loop and C terminus that confer the individual physiological properties to each connexin. Each connexon is made up of a cyclic arrangement of six protein monomers, called connexins (abbreviated as Cx 5The abbreviations used are: Cx, connexin; wt, wild type; TC, tetracysteine; GFP, green fluorescent protein; SCAM, substituted cysteine accessibility method; CMTX, X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth; TM, transmembrane; MP, MPCCPGCCGS; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; EDT, 1,2-ethanedithiol. 5The abbreviations used are: Cx, connexin; wt, wild type; TC, tetracysteine; GFP, green fluorescent protein; SCAM, substituted cysteine accessibility method; CMTX, X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth; TM, transmembrane; MP, MPCCPGCCGS; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; EDT, 1,2-ethanedithiol. plus the molecular mass of the protein as predicted by the amino acid sequence, e.g. Cx32). At present, over 20 unique connexins have been sequenced (1Willecke K. Eiberger J. Degen J. Eckardt D. Romualdi A. Guldenagel M. Deutsch U. Sohl G. Biol.

Recently, the genetic characterizations of connexin diseases have led to studies focused on understanding how single amino acid changes in connexin sequences result in macroscopic symptoms seen in patients (reviewed in Refs. 8Bennett M.V.L.

Mutations in connexin genes have been demonstrated to be the cause of several diseases such as X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMTX) syndrome (defects in Cx32 causing a peripheral neuropathy (10Patel P.I.

Shah M.M. Zuppan C.W. Fletcher W.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1323-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar)). In each case, no systematic pattern has emerged as to the cause and effect of these mutations; however, these naturally occurring mutations are useful in trying to build three-dimensional models based on bioinformatics considerations (18Fleishman S.J. Unger V.M. Yeager M. Ben-Tal N. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 879-888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Here we present the functional and structural characterization of a mutation of a threonine residue situated in the third transmembrane (TM3) helix. Except as part of a larger mutagenesis study (19Skerrett I.M. Aronowitz J. Shin J.H. Cymes G. Kasperek E. Cao F.L. Nicholson B.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the position and amino acid make up at this site have not been investigated. The presence of this mutation does not impede the formation of channels, which in conventional EM displays the same morphology as wild-type (wt) channels. However, as we show in dye transfer and electrophysiological assays, the channels carrying this mutation are nonfunctional and may mimic a “closed pore” state. This residue is strictly conserved among the α- and β-connexins. Because the majority of the naturally occurring disease-related mutations are site-specific ones that result in mis-folding or mis-trafficking of connexins, this mutation is interesting because the connexin carrying this relatively minor substitution is correctly synthesized, trafficked, inserted into the plasma membrane, and capable of docking with a partner connexon, yet it is completely nonfunctional. We show electron microscopic data indicating small differences in the mutant from wild-type structure. We have mutated this residue at the equivalent positions in three connexin isoforms, and we found that function is eliminated in all three cases in intercellular channels in a dominant-negative fashion. We also show that a loss of function occurs in Cx50 hemichannels in homomeric and heteromeric combinations of wt and mutant connexins. Hence, in addition to being interesting from a structure/function relationship point of view, this mutation is potentially very useful as a tool for knocking out connexin functionality without having to delete connexin genes or for examining potential heteromeric interactions between different connexins. Sequence Analysis of Connexins—Connexin sequences were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) protein sequence search web site and collated into a file format readable by the ClustalW set of sequence alignment programs (European Bioinformatics Institute). These aligned sequences were used as input for dendrograms using the program TreeViewPPC and also used to generate the TM3 sequences shown in Table 1.TABLE 1Naturally occurring single amino acid site mutations in the region spanning TM3 among the nine connexins that have been shown to be the cause of human hereditary connexon-opathies This table shows those mutations found in the 3rd transmembrane helix (shown in larger text and underlined) as compared with the conserved threonine residue that we have shown to eliminate functionality (as shown by the shaded boxed T).

These are listed in order of oldest to newest published sequences (lowest affinity to highest affinity) developed by Tsien and co-workers. and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Rat Cx43 and Cx26 cDNAs were subcloned into the prokaryotic vector Bluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Rat Cx43T154A and rat Cx26T135A were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutation T154A was introduced with the primers 5′-AAAAAGCTTGCCACCATGGGT-3′ and 5′-AAAAAGCTTGGATCCAATCTCCAGGTCATCAGG-3′. The resulting wt and mutated connexins cDNAs were subcloned at HindIII and XhoI restriction sites into the eukaryotic expression vector pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) for transient expression or into the retroviral vector pCLNCX of the RetroMax system (Imgenex, La Jolla, CA) for transduction and stable expression. Wt and mutated connexins were tagged at the C terminus by appending the peptide AEAAAREACCRECCARA (Cx43-TC and Cx26-TC), the peptide ESSGSMPCCPGCCGS (Cx43-MP and Cx26-MP), the peptide ESSGSFLNCCPGCCMEPGGR (Cx43-4C and Cx26-4C), and the fusion tag GFP-4C. The tags TC, MP, and 4C (plus linkers) were introduced into the target cDNA by PCR. Transient transfections in HeLa cells were performed using FuGENE (Roche Diagnostics). Transductions were performed with recombinant virus generated in HEK293 cells. pCLNCX Cx43-GFP-4C was co-transfected with the Imgenex packaging vector pCL-Ampho. HeLa cell lines stably expressing the wt or mutant connexins were isolated after a 2-week selection in 100 μg/ml hygromycin in growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin). Dye Injection Studies—Dye injection was performed by injecting Alexa 568 (Molecular Probes) into HeLa cells that were transiently transfected with connexins containing the GFP-TC tag. Images were recorded in epifluorescence mode on a BX50WI Olympus light microscope using a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set before injection to image the Cx-GFP-TC expression and after injection using a rhodamine filter set to image the Alexa 568. Image acquisition was performed with a Nikon SLR digital camera. Only cells showing fluorescent gap junctions were injected. The images shown in Fig. 6 were obtained by superimposing before and after pictures. ReAsH Labeling of TC Constructs, Light Microscopy, and Photooxidation for Electron Microscopy—Cells expressing protein with tetracysteine tags were labeled with FlAsH-EDT2 or ReAsH-EDT2 similarly to what we described previously (20Gaietta G. Deerinck T.J. Adams S.R. Bouwer J. Tour O. Laird D.W. Sosinsky G.E. Tsien R.Y. Ellisman M.H. Science. 2002; 296: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Briefly, FlAsH-EDT2 or ReAsH-EDT2 was used at final concentrations of 0.5 and 1.25 μm, respectively, in the presence of EDT (12.5 μm). The labeling was performed for 1 h at 37 °C in 1× Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen). Free and nonspecifically bound ligands were removed by washing with EDT/Hanks' balanced salt solution (250 μm EDT for TC-tagged connexins, 300 μm EDT for MP-tagged connexins, 600 μm EDT for 4C-tagged connexins). After washing, cells were either fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (light microscopy imaging) or 2% glutaraldehyde (electron microscopy imaging) or imaged live (using a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal microscope) in complete growth media (phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum). GFP and ReAsH were easily discriminated from one another using standard fluorescein and rhodamine settings, respectively. Cx43-GFP-TC-expressing cells were photooxidized as described previously (24Deerinck T.J. Martone M.E. Lev-Ram V. Green D.P.L. Tsien R.Y. Spector D.L. Huang S. Ellisman M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126 (910): 910Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar) except that the excitation was achieved using 490 nm light. At this wavelength, direct excitation of ReAsH (and thus photooxidation of diaminobenzidine by non-GFP-bound ReAsH) was minimal. Prior to photoconversion, cells were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in sodium cacodylate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.4) for 20 min, rinsed in buffer, and treated for 30 min in KCN (20 mm), aminotriazole (5 mm), glycine (50 mm), and H2O2 (0.01%) in cacodylate buffer to reduce nonspecific background. Diaminobenzidine (1 mg/ml) in oxygenated sodium cacodylate (0.1 m) was added to the culture dish, and the cells were irradiated with 585 nm light from a xenon lamp for 10-15 min until a brownish reaction product appeared in place of the red fluorescence. After photoconversion, cells were washed in buffer and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide for 30 min. Cells were rinsed in double distilled water and incubated in 2% uranyl acetate overnight at 4 °C and rinsed again in double distilled water dehydrated in ethanol, embedded in Durcupan ACM resin, and polymerized at 60 °C for 48 h. Sections or 7-8 nm thickness were cut with a Leica Ultracut UTC microtome (Leica, Bannockburn, IL). Baculovirus Expression of Cx26 T135A Mutant with Insect Cells—Cx26T135A-His6 cDNA was subcloned into the vector Bac-N-Blue (Invitrogen) at EcoRI and HindIII sites and was used to generate recombinant baculovirus. A plaque assay was performed for purifying recombinant viruses. Insect Sf9 cells were cultured in the Sf900II-SFM media supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum and 0.1% antibiotic/antimycotic (Invitrogen) at 27 °C. Cells were infected at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells/ml for expression and then recovered 65 h after infection. Gap Junction and Hemichannel Purification—Gap junctions were purified from HeLa cells grown to confluency by following a procedure published previously (25Hand G.M. Muller D.J. Nicholson B.J. Engel A. Sosinsky G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 587-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or isolated from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells according to published methods (26Oshima A. Doi T. Mitsuoka K. Maeda S. Fujiyoshi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1807-1816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The baculovirus-expressed connexins contained a His6 tag for affinity purification (26Oshima A. Doi T. Mitsuoka K. Maeda S. Fujiyoshi Y. J. Biol.

Solubilized connexons were prepared from isolated Sf9 membranes by incubation in 2% dodecyl maltoside in HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES, 200 mm NaCl), and the protein was purified using the C-terminal His6 tag and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose. Samples were negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate for EM observation. Native gels were carried out according to Schagger (27Schagger H.

Electrophoresis was performed using a 4-20% gradient gel (NuPAGE Novex and Invitrogen). Electron Microscopy and Image Processing Procedures—Conventional EM images were recorded either on a JEOL 1200 EX operating at 80 kV or a JEOL 2000 operating at 200 keV. Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) was performed using a JEOL 2000 at 200 keV equipped with a Tietz Video and Image Processing System low dose tomography package and Tietz Video and Image Processing System TemCam-F224 2k × 2k CCD camera. Images were acquired at 40,000 magnification with a 1.6 post-column magnification and had an effective pixel step size of ∼3.76 Å/pixel on the specimen. For correlation averaging, sub-areas were chosen based on a correlational search using a reference image central gap junction channel surrounded by six neighbors obtained by local Fourier filtering. The program QINDEX in the EMAN package of three-dimensional reconstruction single particle programs (28Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2093) Google Scholar) performs both the local averaging and correlation search. Images were first high pass filtered to eliminate or dampen any correlations with inconsistent background values. A threshold of 160-300 of the highest correlating areas was chosen, and the x and y coordinates for each of these areas were output to a file for use with the automated boxing program BOXER. These were then averaged for each image analyzed. Similar averages were obtained using smaller references as well. Image averages for each of the two samples (mutant and wild-type) were then translationally and rotationally aligned and averaged using the rotational filtering algorithms (29Crowther R.A. Amos L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 184: 81-98Google Scholar) in ROBEM to produce the images in Fig. 4. The mutant average was translationally and rotationally aligned to the wt average. A difference map was calculated by subtracting the mutant from the wt average. Preparation of Connexin Mutants and cRNA for Oocyte Injection Studies—Cx26, Cx43, and mouse Cx50 were subcloned into the pGEM 7Zf(+) (Cx26 and Cx43) and SP64T (Cx50) transcription vectors. Cx26T135A, Cx43T154A, and Cx50T157C mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using overlap extension by PCR as described previously (30Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis across the entire coding region confirmed the success of single point mutagenesis. Constructs were linearized with restriction endonucleases, and capped mRNAs were transcribed in vitro with the appropriate RNA polymerase using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentrations were determined by spectroscopy, and master stocks of ∼1 μg/μl RNA were stored at -80 °C. In some cases, relative RNA concentrations were assayed by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis combined with ethidium bromide staining. Working stocks were prepared by serial dilution of the master stock into RNase-free water and also stored at -80 °C. Oocyte Preparation—Ovarian lobe tissue was surgically removed from adult female Xenopus laevis anesthetized in 0.2% tricaine chilled to 4-6 °C. The tissue was teased apart into smaller clumps containing 6-12 oocytes and incubated on a rocking platform at 22 °C for 1 h in OR2 solution containing 1.5 mg/ml collagenase. The OR2 buffer contains 83 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with NaOH. After washing with OR2, stage V and VI oocytes were selected from the population, manually defolliculated if necessary, and incubated at 17 °C for 24 h in half-strength L-15 media (Sigma) supplemented with 0.05 mg/ml gentamicin. Stage V and VI oocytes were injected with 23-46 nl of a mixture of connexin cRNA and 3-5 ng of Cx38 antisense RNA to suppress endogenous gap junction expression (31Barrio L.C. Suchyna T. Bargiello T.

For Cx43 experiments, oocytes were also pre-injected with Cx38 antisense 2 days prior to injection with the cRNA mixtures. For experiments involving the assay of gap junction currents, oocytes were transferred to Petri dishes coated with 2% agarose 24-72 h after cRNA injections for removal of the vitelline layer prior to pairing. The vitelline layer was separated from the plasma membrane by first incubating the oocytes in half-strength L-15 media made slightly hypertonic by addition of 20-50 mm NaCl and then manually removing the vitelline layer with number 5 Dumont forceps. After removing the vitelline membrane, oocytes were incubated for 20-30 min in half-strength L-15 and then paired in agar wells in the same media. For experiments involving the assay of hemichannel currents, oocytes with their vitelline layers intact were perfused with ND96 buffer containing either 2 mm CaCl2 or no added calcium. ND96 buffer with no added calcium contains 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with NaOH. Electrophysiology (Oocytes)—Voltage clamp experiments began 18-48 h after cRNA injections. Voltage clamp recordings were obtained using a two-electrode voltage clamp technique for single oocytes or a dual two-electrode voltage clamp technique for oocyte pairs. GeneClamp 500B voltage clamps (Axon Instruments, Inc., Foster City, CA) were used in one or two oocyte configurations using a 1× L head stage for voltage recording and a 10× MG head stage for passing current. The bath potential was actively clamped to 0 mV using a 100× VG head stage. Voltage recording and current passing electrodes were pulled from borosilicate glass on a horizontal puller (Flaming-Brown P-87, Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). Electrodes had resistances between 0.5 and 3 megohms using an internal pipette solution of 150 mm KCl, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. The amplifiers were interfaced to a personal computer through a Digidata 1320 A/D converter, and data were acquired and analyzed using Pclamp 8 software (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Currents were filtered at 50-200 Hz and acquired directly from the hard drive. To assay hemichannel currents, individual oocytes were subjected to a two-pulse voltage protocol before and after exchanging the bath media from ND96 containing 2 mm CaCl2 to ND96 with no added calcium. The voltage protocol consisted of a 500-ms -10-mV prepulse followed by a 5-s voltage step ranging from -120 to 60 mV in 10-20-mV increments from a holding potential of -20 mV. Whole-cell hemichannel conductance was determined as the current elicited by the pre-pulse divided by 10 mV. To assay gap junctional currents, both oocytes in a pair were clamped to -20 mV, and one oocyte was subjected to a similar voltage pulse protocol as above but using a series of voltage steps ranging from -120 to 80 mV to generate transjunctional potentials of -100 to 100 mV. In gap junction experiments, the pre-pulse current recorded in the nondriven oocyte was divided by the transjunctional voltage of 10 mV to obtain a measurement of the junctional conductance. Fluorescent Imaging (Oocytes)—For fluorescent measurement of dye transfer, oocytes were prepared as for electrophysiological recording. After recording the initial junctional conductance, the donor oocyte was injected with 41.4 nl of 10 mm hydrazide sodium salt of Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes). At 1, 3, and 6 h after injection, the oocyte pair was imaged with a Zeiss Axiovert S100 fluorescent microscope using a CCD camera (model RTE/CCD-1300-Y, Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ). D450-490 and LP520 (Chroma Technology) excitation and emission filter sets were used for Alexa 488. To qu"

In contrast, celastrol has no effects on trafficking of either CD4 or CD8 membrane proteins.

Our results suggest that chronic exposure to certain drugs may be an important aspect of acquired QT prolongation. Potassium channels play important roles in a variety of biological processes ranging from neuronal excitability to tumorgenesis (1Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 537-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 2Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 91-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 3Mu D. Chen L. Zhang X.

Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 297-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Of the more than 400 ion channel genes identified within the human genome, at least 167 are annotated to encode potassium channels (4Xu J. Chen Y. Li M. Targets. 2004; 3: 32-38Google Scholar). Hence, they represent a major repertoire of ion channel proteins. Mutations of potassium channels are causal to a number of human diseases including ataxia, epilepsy, long-QT syndrome, Bartter's syndrome, and familial persistent hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycemia of infancy (5Ashcroft F.M. Ion Channels and Diseases. Academic Press, London2000: 67-312Google Scholar). In addition to being targeted by therapeutics for treating diabetes, epilepsy, and neuropathic pain, unintended inhibition of potassium channel activities has become an important concern, especially for the cardiovascular system (6Curran M.E. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1998; 9: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 7Ford J.W. Stevens E.B. Treherne J.M. Packer J. Bushfield M. Prog. Drug Res. 2002; 58: 133-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In human cardiac myocytes, repolarization during an action potential is mediated by a number of potassium channels including Kv4.3, Kv1.4, Kv1.5, Kv2.1, hERG, KvLQT1/mink, and Kir2.x (for reviews, see Refs. 8Roden D.M. Balser J.R. George Jr., A.L. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 431-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar and 9Shah M. Akar F.G. Tomaselli G.F. Circulation. 2005; 112: 2517-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Their activities are temporally involved in different phases of cardiac repolarization. Compoundcaused reduction of potassium currents, particularly those mediated by hERG, KvLQT1/mink, and Kir2.1, often slows down the rate of repolarization and hence prolongs the duration of action potential (10Sanguinetti M.C. Mitcheson J.S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 119-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This is also evident in human patients with long-QT syndrome who have genetic mutations in these genes. Both experimental evidence and computational simulation suggest that a small decrease of potassium conductance could significantly prolong the duration of cardiac action potential (11Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: H1675-H1686PubMed Google Scholar, 12Clancy C.E. Rudy Y. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 50: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Because an unusually high percentage of compounds causing QT prolongation is associated with the reduction of cardiac potassium currents (13De Ponti F. Poluzzi E. Montanaro N. Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 2000; 56: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), it is important to understand the mechanisms by which these compounds exert the inhibition. A considerable number of compounds are inhibitory to potassium channel current, but their potency of inhibition may not always be explained by acute inhibition of channel conductivity (14Redfern W.S. Carlsson L. Davis A.S. Lynch W.G. MacKenzie I. Palethorpe S. Siegl P.K. Strang I. Sullivan A.T. Wallis R. Camm A.J. Hammond T.G. Cardiovasc. Res. 2003; 58: 32-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). These compounds may exert their effects by alternative mechanisms including chronic mechanism of action. In general, reduction of potassium current on the cell surface could take place at two levels, ion conduction and channel density. The effect on channel conductivity can be measured by established techniques such as electrophysiological methods (4Xu J. Chen Y. Li M. Targets. 2004; 3: 32-38Google Scholar). However, changes of channel density are not readily assayed by existing high throughput technologies. Thus, it is not known to what extent the acquired QT prolongation is contributed to by chronic effects independent from direct block among those compounds that have been clinically associated with cardiotoxicity. A critical first step to address this question is to identify compounds that affect the surface expression of cardiac potassium channels. Recently, we reported the functional recovery after chemobleaching (FRAC) 2The abbreviations used are: FRAC, functional recovery after chemobleaching; hERG, human ether-a-go-go-related gene; MTSET, [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]-methanethiosulfonate; BFA, brefeldin A; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HA, hemagglutinin; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salts solution. assay, which measures the rate of protein trafficking with effective throughput (15Sun H. Shikano S. Xiong Q. Li M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16964-16969Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This assay system enables an investigation of many compounds in parallel for their roles in regulation of potassium channels, particularly whether and to what extent they affect protein expression on the cell surface. Using this approach, we have screened a compound library of 2000 chemicals including human drugs, natural compounds, and drug-like chemicals, for either acute or chronic effects on cardiac potassium channels. Intriguingly, comparable numbers of compounds have been found to cause acute block or chronic inhibition. One of the identified inhibitors is celastrol, a bioactive compound from the celastraceae plant, also called the Chinese Thunder God vine (16Ngassapa O. Soejarto D.D. Pezzuto J.M. Farnsworth N.R. J. Nat. Prod. 1994; 57: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 17Zhou B.N. Mem. Inst. Oswaldo. Cruz. 1991; 86: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We investigated the effects of celastrol on both channel conduction activity by electrophysiological recording and channel protein trafficking by the FRAC assay (15Sun H. Shikano S. Xiong Q. Li M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16964-16969Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Celastrol has an unusual pharmacological profile including both acute and chronic inhibition for Kir2.1 and hERG potassium channels but not for the homologous Kv2.1 potassium channel. Cell lines are established by standard protocols using pcDNA3.1. HEK 293 stable cell lines expressing Kir2.1, hERG, and Kv2.1 channel and human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 50/50 medium supplied with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, l-glutamine. The HEK 293 cell lines are supplemented with 500 μg/ml G418 (complete medium). The compound library (Spectrum Collection, 2000 compounds, supplied as 10 mm Me2SO solution) used in this study was purchased from MicroSource Discovery Inc. (Groton, CT). This library consists of mostly human therapeutic drugs or drug-like compounds and natural products. The compounds were diluted with deionized water to reach a concentration of 100 μm with 5% Me2SO. This was used as the 10× compound solution to be introduced to the cell culture. HEK 293 cells stably expressing Kir2.1 were plated at 4 × 104/100 μl complete medium per well in poly-l-Lysine coated 96-well plates. Three hours later, 50 μl of complete medium containing 15 mm sodium butyrate was added to each well and then incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 overnight. Thirty microliters of complete medium containing 30 mm RbCl was added to the culture next day and incubated for another 3 h. Cell plating and reagents dispensing were done using a Multidrop 384 dispenser (Thermo Electron Corp., Waltham, MA). [2-(Trimethylammonium)ethyl]-methanethiosulfonate (MTSET) treatment, compound addition, and the Rb+ efflux assay were programmed and performed on a Tekbench liquid handling system (Tekcel Inc., Hopkinton, MA). Briefly, after 20 μl/well of 25 mm (10×) MTSET solution was added to the cell culture and incubated at room temperature for 6 min, each cell plate was washed twice and redispensed with 180 μl/well complete medium containing 5 mm RbCl on an Elx 405 select washer (Bio-Tek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT). Then 20 μl/each of the 10× compound solution was added to 80 wells of each cell plate. To ensure assay consistency, 20 μl of 5% Me2SO solution was added to each well in the first column of each cell plate and 20 μl of 10 μm brefeldin A (BFA) in 5% Me2SO was added to each well in the last column of each cell plate along with the compound solutions; these wells served as negative and positive controls, respectively. Final Me2SO concentration in the cell medium was kept at or below 0.5% for all cell plates to minimize its toxicity. After adding the compounds, the cells were again incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for another 3 h. Then each cell plate was washed twice and redispensed with 200 μl/well Rb+-free complete medium and incubated at room temperature for 15 min before the supernatant was transferred to a new 96-well plate. The cells were then lysed with 200 μl/well 1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Rb+ concentrations in both supernatant and cell lysate were measured by an Ion Channel Reader 8000 (Aurora Biomed Inc., Vancouver, Canada). IC50 Measurement—A Kir2.1Y stable cell line was plated at 2 × 105/well in poly-l-lysine-coated 24-well plates with 5 mm NaBt. Cells were first incubated with complete medium containing 5 mm RbCl for 3 h. Then half of the wells were treated with 2.5 mm MTSET for 5 min, and cells were washed twice with medium containing 5 mm RbCl. Different concentrations of celastrol were added to the cells using 100× stock in 40% Me2SO (final 0.4% Me2SO), and cells were incubated with the compound for another 3 h. Then the cells were washed twice with 1 ml/well Rb+ -free medium and incubated in 0.5 ml/well Rb+-free medium for 15 min at room temperature. Supernatants were transferred to new 24-well plates. Cells were lysed with 0.5 ml/well 1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Rb+ concentrations in both supernatants and lysates were measured on an Ion Channel Reader 8000, and Rb+ efflux was calculated as described previously (15Sun H. Shikano S. Xiong Q. Li M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16964-16969Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Each data point was the average from three different wells. IC50 measurements for celastrol were affected by assay volume due to the poor solubility of celastrol. hERG Rb+ Efflux Assay—A hERG stable cell line was plated at 2 × 105/well in a 24-well plate. One hour after plating, different concentrations of celastrol were added to the cell culture from 1000× Me2SO stock. 0.1% Me2SO and 200 nm BFA were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. After 20-h incubation at 37 °C, culture medium were changed to medium containing the same concentrations of compounds and 5 mm RbCl. After about 24-h incubation with the compounds, cells were washed twice with Rb+-free medium, and Rb+ efflux was initiated by adding 0.5 ml/well medium containing 50 mm KCl. After 10-min incubation, the supernatants were transferred to a new 24-well plate. Cells were lysed with 0.5 ml/well 1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Rb+ concentrations in both supernatants and lysates were measured on an Ion Channel Reader 8000, and Rb+ efflux rate was calculated as described previously. Each data point was the average from two different wells. Standard rupture patch was used to record the whole-cell current. During the recording, constant perfusion of extracellular solutions containing (mm): NaCl, 135; KCl, 5, CaCl2,2;MgCl2, 1; HEPES, 10; d-glucose, 10 (adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH) was maintained by a gravitydriven perfusion system (ALA Scientific Instruments, Inc., Westbury, NY). Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate micropipettes (TW150-4, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). When filled with the intracellular solution containing (mm): 130, KCl; 1, MgCl2; 5, ATPMg; 5, EGTA; 10, HEPES (adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH), the pipette resistance was about 3-5 MΩ, which was normally compensated by 60-80%. Voltage-clamped currents were recorded using an Axopatch-200A amplifier, filtered at 1 kHz, and digitized by DigiData 1322A and processed by pClamp 9.2 software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Membrane voltages were clamped at holding levels and then to different depolarization or hyperpolarization levels for particular types of potassium channels. Corresponding current amplitudes for each type of channel were monitored to evaluate the inhibition caused by the compound. For Kir2.1 channels, membrane voltage was maintained at -40 mV and then stepped into a series of voltage steps ranging from -120 to +50 mV. Steady state currents at each voltage step were measured. For hERG channels, the voltage protocol consisted of a pre-pulse of +60 mV and then a testing step of either -100 mV or -50 mV to obtain tail currents. Tail currents were fitted by an exponential function, and then the actual amplitudes were measured by extrapolating the fitting curve to the beginning of the testing step. For Kv2.1 channels, steady state currents were measured when membranes were depolarized from -80 to 30 mV at a 10-mV step. Patch clamp data were preprocessed using Clampfit 9.2 (Axon Instruments) and then analyzed in Matlab 6.1 (Mathworks, Natick, MA) and Origin 7 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA). Data are presented as means ± S.E. Significance was estimated using the paired Student’s t test. HEK 293 cells were transfected with HA-tagged (between M1 and P-loop) Kir2.1 or CD8 by using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). At 6 h after transfection, cells were trypsinized and thoroughly resuspended before plating in 6-well plates at 4 × 105/well. Compounds were added to each well from 500× or 1000× Me2SO stocks, and an equal volume of Me2SO was added to one well used as a negative control. Cells were incubated at 37 °C with compounds for 16-20 h. Cells were washed with 1× PBS and harvested by incubation with 0.5 mm EDTA in 1× PBS for 5-10 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed twice with Hanks’ balanced salts solution (HBSS) plus 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, and 2% fetal bovine serum and incubated with mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) on ice for 1 h. Cells were then again washed twice with HBSS staining medium and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 15 min on ice. Finally, the cells were washed twice with HBSS staining medium, and the surface fluorescence was measured by FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences), using CELLQUEST software (BD Biosciences). Kir2.1 and hERG stable cell lines were plated in 6-well plates at the density of 5 × 105/well. The next day, cells were treated with compounds with 0.1% Me2SO added. For transient transfection experiments, HEK 293 cells were plated at 2 × 105/well and the next day transfected with C-terminal HA-tagged CD4 or CD8 plasmids. Compounds were added 6 h after transfection. After 24 h of incubation with compounds, cells were washed once with PBS and lysed with 300 μl/well 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, protease inhibitor mixture) at 4 °C for 30 min. For the Kir2.1 stable line, cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 20 min, and the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg anti-HA antibody-conjugated protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and resuspended in 30 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer for 15-20 min at room temperature for elution. The eluates were subjected to 10% SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS plus 0.1% Tween (PBST) at 4 °C overnight and immunoblotted with rabbit polyclonal anti-Kir2.1 (1:500 dilution,1 h at room temperature). After twice washing with PBST, the membrane was blotted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Western blots were developed using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) on a Fujifilm Luminescent Image Analyzer LAS 3000 (Fujifilm, Valhalla, NY). For the hERG stable cell line and HA-tagged CD4, the cell lysate supernatants were incubated with SDS sample buffer for 15-20 min at room temperature and separated on 6% (hERG) or 12% (CD4) SDSpolyacrylamide gel. The protein-transferred membranes were immunoblotted with either rabbit anti-hERG (Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel) or anti-HA antibody followed by the corresponding secondary antibodies. Western blots were developed as described above. hERG surface expression levels were quantitated using Multi Gauge v2.3 (Fujifilm) by measuring the band density ratio of the 155-kDa mature form and the 135-kDa immature form, normalized to that of control sample. SH-SY5Y cells were plated in 60-mm dishes at 1.5 × 106/dish. On the next day, cells were treated with compounds with 0.1% Me2SO for 24 h. Cells were then washed once with PBS and lysed with 150 μl of 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Cell lysates were collected and centrifuged at 4 °C. Then 100 μl of the supernatant was incubated with SDS sample buffer at 75 °C for 5 min and separated on a 6% gel. Membranes were immunoblotted with rabbit anti-hERG or rabbit anti-calreticulin (Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and the blots were developed by ECL. The band density of the hERG mature form was quantitated and normalized to that of calreticulin as a reference protein. To identify small molecules that may have acute or chronic effects on Kir2.1 potassium channel activity, we screened a library of 2000 compounds using the FRAC assay (15Sun H. Shikano S. Xiong Q. Li M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16964-16969Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The assay takes advantage of Rb+ permeability of potassium channels and sensitive quantification of Rb+ by atomic absorption spectrometry. Because the methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagents, such as cell-impermeable MTSET, quantitatively link to the native cysteine (Cys-149) of Kir2.1, which irreversibly nullifies the channel conduction, we are able to probe the rate of channel transport by testing the time to recover after MTSET treatment, i.e. measuring the channel functional recovery at different time points after MTSET treatment (15Sun H. Shikano S. Xiong Q. Li M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16964-16969Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). By applying the compounds before or immediately after the MTSET treatment, one can assess whether a given compound potentiates or inhibits the recovered activity conferred by newly surfaced channel proteins. A compound may exert its effect on vesicular transport and/or conductive activity of newly surfaced channels. The compound collection used in this analysis consisted of about 1000 human drugs, 700 natural products, and 300 drug-like molecules (see “Experimental Procedures”). A diagram of the screening strategy and summary of the hit compounds is shown in Fig. 1. The compounds were screened initially at 10 μm using a Kir2.1 channel stable cell line. The activity of Kir2.1 was monitored by the ratio of released Rb+ to that of total Rb+, determined by atomic absorption spectrometry (15Sun H. Shikano S. Xiong Q. Li M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16964-16969Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 18Terstappen G.C. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 272: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Twenty compounds caused a more than 50% loss of the total Rb+ concentration when compared with controls, indicating that these compounds are toxic to the cells, disrupting cell adhesion for example. Hence, they were not included in the hit selection for the purpose of this study. Forty-three compounds showed at least 30% inhibition of Kir2.1 channel Rb+ efflux and were selected for further analyses. Among these, 30 compounds can be grouped by structure similarity into six different structural classes. The remaining 13 compounds showed no significant structural similarity (Fig. 1). Reduction of Rb+ efflux could be a result of reduced surface expression and/or direct inhibition of ion conduction by the surfaced channels. These two mechanisms of action may be differentiated by testing the compound effects with or without MTSET treatment. Twenty-nine compounds with more than 30% reduction in Rb+ efflux were selected for further analyses. To distinguish the two possible mechanisms, we performed the FRAC assay and compared the signals obtained with the MTSET treatment and without the MTSET treatment. Thirteen compounds showed a similar level of inhibition in both conditions, indicating the inhibitory effect is independent of the MTSET treatment. Nine compounds showed more than 30% significant inhibitory effect in MTSET-treated cells but less than 10% reduction in untreated cells, indicating their effect is MTSET-dependent. Seven compounds showed inhibitory effect in both conditions but with a higher inhibition level in the MTSET-treated cells, indicating the compound effects may affect both channel activity and surface expression. These results suggest that a significant percentage of compounds affect channel surface expression in recombinant cell lines. Celastrol was identified as one of the natural products showing MTSET-dependent inhibition on Kir2.1 channel activity. Because of its therapeutic potential (Ref. 19Cleren C. Calingasan N.Y. Chen J. Beal M.F. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 995-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar and see “Discussion”), celastrol was chosen for more detailed analyses. Four additional compounds in the screened library possess structures similar to celastrol (Fig. 2A). Among them, only celastrol and its methyl ester pristimerin showed inhibitory effects in FRAC analyses (Fig. 2B), while the others, despite the striking structural similarity, had no effects. This indicates that the effects on Kir2.1 channels were chemical structure-specific. In FRAC analyses, celastrol showed 40% inhibition with MTSET treatment but only 10% inhibition without MTSET treatment (Fig. 2C). In contrast, chlorpromazine, a tricyclic antipsychotic drug (Fig. 2A), which has been reported to block hERG channels (20Thomas D. Wu K. Kathofer S. Katus H.A. Schoels W. Kiehn J. Karle C.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 139: 567-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), showed a similar level of inhibition independent of MTSET treatment. To measure the potency of the inhibitory effect of celastrol, we performed Rb+ efflux assay in the presence of different concentrations of celastrol with or without MTSET treatment (Fig. 2D). The resultant inhibition potency (IC50) is 1.2 ± 0.1 μm with MTSET treatment, 5-fold lower (or more potent) than the IC50 measured without MTSET treatment (6.7 ± 0.9 μm). These data suggest that celastrol has dual effects on Kir2.1 channel, both blocking the channel activity and inhibiting channel protein expression on the cell surface. To more precisely define acute block of the Kir2.1 channel activity by celastrol, we measured the Kir2.1 inward currents before and after the extracellular application of 20 μm celastrol using whole-cell voltage clamp recording (Fig. 3A, left panel). Upon application of 20 μm celastrol, the whole cell Kir2.1 current was decreased by 30 ± 9% (n = 4). This indicates that celastrol can acutely inhibit the Kir2.1 channel. To test whether the acute inhibition effect of celastrol is general to cardiac potassium channels, we measured the compound effect on the hERG and Kv2.1 channels (Fig. 3A). Celastrol at 10 μm reduced the hERG peak tail current amplitude by 63 ± 10% (n = 4). However, 10 μm celastrol showed no effect on Kv2.1 (n = 4), a delayed rectifier potassium channel. Together, these data demonstrate the capability and specificity of celastrol in acute inhibition of cardiac Kir2.1 and hERG potassium channels. To test biochemically for any change at the protein level, the inhibitory effect of celastrol on Kir2.1 channel surface expression was further evaluated by flow cytometry analyses using antibody specific to an extracellular epitope. Kir2.1 with an extracellularly tagged HA epitope was transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells and detected with an anti-HA antibody under non-permeable conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”) (21Shikano S. Li M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5783-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Overnight incubation (16-18 h) of celastrol significantly reduced Kir2.1 protein on the cell surface compared with cells incubated with Me2SO alone as control (Fig. 4A, top panel). In contrast, chlorpromazine, which showed MTSET-independent inhibition in our screen (Fig. 2C), did not change the Kir2.1 surface expression level (Fig. 4A, middle panel). The reduced surface expression level of the Kir2.1 channel could be the consequence of general blockade of vesicular transport or reduction in protein synthesis. We tested celastrol for any effect on the surface expression level of CD8 receptor with considerable O-linked glycosylation. Overnight incubation with either 200 nm celastrol in Me2SO or Me2SO alone did not change the surface expression level of CD8 protein (Fig. 4A, bottom panel). In contrast, overnight incubation of BFA, a fungal toxin that inhibits vesicular trafficking by disruption of the Golgi apparatus (22Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar), dramatically reduced CD8 surface expression. Quantification of surface expression by fluorescence intensity showed that celastrol specifically reduced surface expression of the Kir2.1 protein by 80%, with no effect on CD8 (Fig. 4B). In contrast, BFA reduces the surfac"

Caspase 8-mediated cleavage of the BH3-only protein Bid into a truncated protein (tBid) and subsequent translocation of tBid to mitochondria has been implicated in death receptor signaling. We utilized a recombinant fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) Bid probe to determine the kinetics of Bid cleavage and tBid translocation during death receptor-induced apoptosis in caspase 3-deficient MCF-7 cells. Cells treated with tumor necrosis factor-α (200 ng/ml) showed a rapid cleavage of the Bid-FRET probe occurring 75.4 ± 12.6 min after onset of the tumor necrosis factor-α exposure. Cleavage of the Bid-FRET probe coincided with a translocation of tBid to the mitochondria and a collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). We next investigated the role of Bid cleavage in a model of caspase-independent, glutamate-induced excitotoxic apoptosis. Rat cerebellar granule neurons were transfected with the Bid-FRET probe and exposed to glutamate for 5 min. In contrast to death receptor-induced apoptosis, neurons showed a translocation of full-length Bid to the mitochondria. This translocation occurred 5.6 ± 1.7 h after the termination of the glutamate exposure and was also paralleled with a collapse of the ΔΨm. Proteolytic cleavage of the FRET probe also occurred, however, only 25.2 ± 3.5 min after its translocation to the mitochondria. Subfractionation experiments confirmed a translocation of full-length Bid from the cytosolic to the mitochondrial fraction during excitotoxic apoptosis. Our data demonstrate that both tBid and full-length Bid have the capacity to translocate to mitochondria during apoptosis.

The key event in the mitochondrial pathway is the release of proapoptotic factors from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytosol (3Green D.R. Kroemer G. Science. 2004; 305: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar) resulting in the downstream activation of a family of cytosolic cysteine proteases, caspases, that are required for many of the morphological changes that occur during apoptosis. The mitochondrial release of cytochrome-c and Smac/DIABLO allows for the formation of the apoptosome (4Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4405) Google Scholar, 5Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X.

Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6157) Google Scholar), a complex that enables the activation of caspases within the cell. In many apoptotic models the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bax or Bak are required for the release of caspase-activating factors from mitochondria (7Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3299) Google Scholar). Both proteins are believed to form pores that make the outer mitochondrial membrane sufficiently permeable for the release of these intermembrane proteins (8Kuwana T. Mackey M.R. Perkins G. Ellisman M.H. Latterich M. Schneiter R. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 331-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar). For this to occur, Bax and Bak must undergo conformational changes and insert into the outer mitochondrial membrane (9Goping I.S. Gross A. Lavoie J.N. Nguyen M. Jemmerson R. Roth K. Korsmeyer S.J. Shore G.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 10Eskes R. Antonsson B. Osen-Sand A. Montessuit S. Richter C. Sadoul R. Mazzei G. Nichols A. Martinou J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). BH3-only proteins promote the activation of Bax and Bak either by direct protein association or through antagonizing the function of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (11Huang D.C. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). The BH3-only protein Bid has been implicated in death receptor-induced apoptosis. In this pathway, Bid is post-translationally activated through caspase-8-mediated cleavage of the p22 FL-Bid protein to a truncated form (tBid) (12Gross A. Yin X.M. Wang K. Wei M.C. Jockel J.

This cleavage unmasks the BH3 domain, facilitating its accessibility for protein-protein interaction. tBid is subsequently myristoylated and translocates to mitochondria (15Zha J. Weiler S. Oh K.J. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1761-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar) to activate Bax or Bak (16Wei M.C. Lindsten T. Mootha V.K. Weiler S. Gross A. Ashiya M. Thompson C.B.

Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). The subsequent release of caspase-activating factors strongly amplifies caspase activation in response to death receptor ligation. Recently it has also become evident that Bid is critically involved in glutamate-induced apoptosis in neurons, as nerve cells from mice deficient in the BH3-only protein Bid are resistant to excitotoxic injury in vitro and ischemic injury in vivo (18Plesnila N.

In the present study we have utilized single-cell real time imaging to examine the spatiotemporal profile of Bid expression and the kinetics of its activation during models of both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent apoptosis. Materials—Fetal calf serum and minimal essential medium were purchased from Invitrogen. Recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), cycloheximide (CHX), glutamate, glycine, staurosporine, and all other reagents were from Sigma Fluo-4 AM and TMRM were purchased from Invitrogen. Cell Culture—Human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% fetal calf serum (PAA, Cölbe, Germany). Cerebellar granule neurons were prepared as described previously (26Ward M.W. Kushnareva Y. Greenwood S. Connolly C.N. J. Neurochem. 2005; 92: 1081-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cerebella from 7-day-old Wistar rats of both sexes were dissected and pooled. The tissue was placed in 20 ml of filter-sterilized phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.25 mg/ml trypsin and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Trypsinization was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of filter-sterilized phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.05 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 3 mm MgSO4, and 30 units/ml DNase I. The neurons were then triturated, and the resulting neurons were resuspended in supplemented culture medium. Cells were then plated on poly-l-lysine coated glass Willco dishes (Willco BV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), 6-well plates and 24-well plates at 1 × 106 cells/ml and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2:95% air. Transfection—The pFRET-Bid plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. R. Onuki (National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Tsukuba, Japan) (27Onuki R. Nagasaki A. Kawasaki H. Baba T. Uyeda T.Q. Taira K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14716-14721Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells were transfected with 0.6 μg of plasmid DNA (pFRET-Bid) and 6 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)/ml in serum-free culture medium at 37 °C for 3 h. For the generation of stable cell lines, transfected cells were selected in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for 2 weeks, and fluorescent clones were enriched. Cerebellar granule neurons were plated at 1 × 106 cells/ml on poly-l-lysine 2-cm glass-bottomed dishes. Half the medium was removed prior to transfection and retained for addition back to the neurons following the transfection. After 6-7 days, cerebellar granule neurons were transfected with pFRET-Bid plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After 4-5 h in the transfection medium the cells were washed and returned to the preconditioned medium. Experiments were carried out 24-48 h after transfection. Confocal Microscopy—MCF-7 cells stably transfected with the pFRET-Bid plasmid were cultivated in Hepes-buffered (10 mm, pH 7.4) RPMI 1640 medium. Apoptosis was induced with 200 ng/ml TNF-α/1 μg/ml CHX at the start of the measurements. Transfected cerebellar granule neurons were loaded with TMRM (30 nm) for 30 min at 37 °C (in the dark), in a buffered incubation medium (BM) consisting of 120 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm KCl, 0.4 mm KH2PO4,20mm HEPES, 5 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm Na2SO4, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, and 15 mm glucose; pH 7.4. The Willco dishes with cells were washed in fresh medium after loading before being mounted in a non-perfusion (37 °C) holder and placed on the stage of a LSM 510 Meta Zeiss confocal microscope. No MgCl2 was present in buffers for experiments that involved the addition of glutamate. Both types of cells were left to stabilize for 30 min prior to the start of an experiment. To observe FRET cleavage in vitro, neurons were transfected with a plasmid coding for the Bid-FRET probe and loaded with TMRM. CFP was excited at 405 nm with a 30 milliwatt laser diode adjusted to 2.5% of total intensity reflected by a 405/514 nm beam splitter. CFP and YFP (FRET-acceptor) emission were collected through 470-500 and 505-550 nm barrier filters, respectively. YFP was excited at 488 nm with an argon laser (1%), and the emission was collected through a 505-550 nm barrier filter. Cross-talk from CFP and YFP into the FRET channel was determined to be 33% of the CFP and 6% of the YFP fluorescence. There was no CFP cross-talk into the YFP channel. TMRM was excited with a helium neon laser (4%) at 543 nm, and the emission was collected with a 560 nm long pass filter. Images were taken at 5-min intervals and processed using Metamorph software. The TMRM emission signal was plotted as a percent of the total change following background subtraction. The standard deviation (S.D.) for the CFP and YFP emission signals were calculated. The changes in CFP S.D. were plotted as percent of the total change. Kinetics of FRET disruption were processed using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA), and the CFP/YFP emission ratios were obtained by dividing the integrated fluorescence intensity values of single cells (28Rehm M. Dussmann H. Janicke R.U. Tavare J.M. Kogel D. Prehn J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24506-24514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To compare individual cells, time courses of the emission ratios were scaled by defining the base-line ratio before the onset of FRET disruption as 0% and the ratio after termination of the FRET disruption as 100%. Plots were fitted with the sigmoidal Boltzmann equation y = (A1 - A2)/(1 + exp((x - x0)/dt)) +A2 with dt determining the width of the turnover, A1 the minimum, A2 the maximum, and x0 the time point when (A2 - A1)/2 is reached, using Origin 7.0 SRO(Origin Lab Corporation). Detection of Cytosolic Ca2+ Transients—Cerebellar granule neurons on Willco dishes were co-loaded with TMRM (30 nm) and Fluo-4 AM (3 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C (in the dark), in BM. The Willco dishes with cells were washed in fresh medium after loading before being mounted in a non-perfusion (37 °C) holder and placed on the stage of a LSM 510 Meta Zeiss confocal microscope. No MgCl2 was present in buffers for experiments that involved the addition of glutamate. Fluo-4 AM was excited at 488 nm with an argon laser (1%), and the emission was collected through a 505-550 nm barrier filter, TMRM was excited at 543 nm with a helium neon laser (3%), and the emission was collected through a 560 nm long pass barrier filter. Images were collected every 60s and were processed using Metamorph software. Lactate Dehydrogenase Release—Cerebellar granule neurons (1 × 106 cells/well) were plated on poly-l-lysine coated 24-well plates. In each case neuronal injury was assessed at each of the time points by quantitative measurement of lactate dehydrogenase release using a cytotoxicity detection kit (Roche Diagnostics). All conditions were carried out in triplicate in each experiment, and each experiment was carried out three times. Digitonization, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blotting—Briefly, cells were permeabilized with 100 μg/ml digitonin at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant representing the cytosol and the mitochondria-containing pellet fraction were separated by centrifugation and denatured. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis was performed as described (Lankiewicz et al., 22). Bid was detected with the rabbit polyclonal antibody (AR-53; 1:1,000), and Porin was detected by an anti-Porin mouse monoclonal antibody (Calbiochem) diluted 1:5000. Densitometric analysis was carried out on the Western blots using Metamorph software. The pixel intensity for each region was analyzed, the background was subtracted, and the FL-Bid expression was normalized to the porin loading control for each lane. The translocation of FL-Bid was then expressed as a percent of the control response. Measurement of Caspase Activity—After treatment with glutamate/glycine (100 μm/10 μm), staurosporine (300 nm), or vehicle, the cerebellar granule neurons were lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer. 50 μl of this lysate was added to 150 μl of reaction buffer (25 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, 3 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5) plus 10 μm caspase substrate, acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aminomethylcoumarin (Ac-DEVD-AMC), a fluorogenic substrate preferentially cleaved by caspase-3, -7, and -8 but also caspase-1, -6, -9, and -10 (28Rehm M.

Production of fluorescent aminomethylcoumarin was monitored over 60 min using a fluorescent plate reader (HTS 7000, PerkinElmer Life Science) (excitation 380 nm and emission 460 nm).

Death Receptor Signaling in MCF-7 Cells Induces a Simultaneous Cleavage of Bid, Translocation of the Cleaved Bid, and Collapse in ΔΨm—Caspase-mediated proteolytic activation of Bid has been demonstrated to be a key event in death receptor-mediated apoptosis (12Gross A. Yin X.M. Wang K. Wei M.C. Jockel J. Milliman C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol.

Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3756) Google Scholar). However, analysis of this cleavage is complicated by the fact that both the initiator caspase-8 and the effector caspase-3 can cleave the protein (29Slee E.A. Keogh S.A. Martin S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 556-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). We took advantage of the MCF-7 cell line, which is deficient for caspase-3 expression (30Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1696) Google Scholar), enabling the characterization of caspase-8-mediated cleavage of the Bid FRET probe without interference from caspase-3-dependent proteolysis. MCF-7 cells were transfected with a YFP-Bid-CFP FRET probe comprised of YFP, CFP, and the FL-Bid protein as a linker (Fig. 1A). Cleavage of FL-Bid results in a separation of YFP and CFP, reducing the efficiency of resonance energy transfer (Fig. 1A). Acceptor bleaching experiments were carried out to assess the sensitivity of the FRET probe. The acceptor fluorophore YFP was selectively bleached by repeated scanning of the cell area (Fig. 1B, YFP). A quantitative analysis of acceptor bleaching showed the absolute fluorescence values for CFP and YFP for a single cell when plotted as a function of time (Fig. 1C). Upon bleaching there was a marked decrease in the acceptor fluorescence (YFP), which coincided with an increase in the donor fluorescence (CFP) because of an inability of the acceptor to accept energy from the donor after bleaching. Therefore the increase of CFP fluorescence upon YFP bleaching (Fig. 1, B and C) confirmed that FRET exists between the two fluorescent proteins in the Bid-FRET probe in vivo. To describe the kinetics of Bid cleavage and translocation during death receptor signaling, MCF-7 cells stably transfected with the Bid-FRET probe were treated with 200 ng/ml TNF-α (+1 μg/ml CHX) to induce caspase-8 activation. Untreated cells showed an evenly distributed CFP and YFP fluorescence within the cell, a stable ΔΨm, and normal morphology (Fig. 2A). Upon induction of apoptosis the Bid-FRET probe was cleaved, the tBid-CFP fragment was translocated to the mitochondria, and there was a depolarization of the ΔΨm (Figs. 2B and 4F). Following Bid cleavage, tBid-CFP fluorescence was largely clustered at mitochondrial compartments (Fig. 2C), and YFP fluorescence was always homogenously distributed throughout the cell.FIGURE 4Translocation of FL-Bid and mitochondrial depolarization precede Bid cleavage following transient glutamate receptor overactivation. Cerebellar granule neurons transiently transfected with a vector encoding the CFP-Bid-YFP FRET probe and loaded with 30 nm TMRM were treated with glutamate/glycine (100 μm/10 μm) for 5 min. After addition of MK-801 (10 μm) to block N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activity the cell was monitored over time with images taken at 5-min intervals and the selected time points (0, 200, and 250 min) shown.

F, bar graph showing the onset of ΔΨm and Bid cleavage in relation to the onset of Bid translocation for neurons stimulated with glutamate (n = 7) and MCF-7 cells (n = 37) stimulated with TNF-α/CHX (200 ng/ml/1μg/ml). p < 0.01 difference between onset of mitochondrial depolarization and Bid cleavage in cerebellar granule neurons, no significant difference (n. s. p = 0.553) was found in MCF-7 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Upon cleavage of the Bid-FRET probe, the CFP/YFP emission ratio increased as a result of FRET disruption. Cleavage kinetics for the Bid-FRET probe were quantified by plotting the CFP/YFP emission ratio as a function of time. The onset of Bid cleavage closely correlated (≤2 min) with the onset of tBid translocation and mitochondrial depolarization (Figs. 2D and 4F). On average, Bid cleavage occurred 74.5 ± 12.6 min after stimulus addition (37 cells from n = 3 separate experiments). These data show that upon activating apoptotic death receptor signaling the onset of Bid cleavage, tBid translocation and mitochondrial depolarization occur in rapid succession within a narrow time frame. Transient Glutamate Receptor Overactivation Induces a Delayed Caspase-independent Neuronal Injury—Cerebellar granule neurons have been used extensively to identify acute and long term responses of neurons following glutamate receptor overactivation (31Budd S.L. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2282-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 32Ward M.W. Rego A.C. Frenguelli B.G. Nicholls D.G. J.

A transient overactivation of the glutamate receptor has been shown to be sufficient to result in a delayed neuronal injury that occurs 2-3 h following the initial insult, which is characterized by a collapse of the ΔΨm (32Ward M.W. Rego A.C. Frenguelli B.G. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7208-7219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this model we induced an overactivation of the glutamate receptors for 5 min (Fig. 3A) resulting in a delayed neuronal injury that occurred 4-24 h after the initial exposure (Fig. 3, B and C). This delayed injury was associated with a collapse in the ΔΨm that was closely paralleled with a collapse in Ca2+ homeostasis (Fig. 3B) and a rapid condensation of the nucleus (Fig. 4, A and B, DIC). In agreement with previously reported studies (21Budd S.L. Tenneti L. Lishnak T. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6161-6166Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 22Lankiewicz S. Marc Luetjens C. Truc Bui N. Krohn A.J. Poppe M. Cole G.M. Saido T.C. Prehn J.H. J. Biol.

Staurosporine-treated neurons served as a positive control and highlighted the extent to which caspase activation can be induced within cerebellar granule neurons (Fig. 3D), indicating that caspase-independent processes are initiated during glutamate-induced apoptosis. FL-Bid Translocates to the Mitochondria during Excitotoxic Apoptosis in Cerebellar Granule Neurons—Because excitotoxic injury has been shown to require the BH3-only protein Bid (18Plesnila N. Zinkel S. Le D.A. Amin-Hanjani S. Wu Y. Qiu J. Chiarugi A. Thomas S.S. Kohane D.S. Korsmeyer S.J. Moskowitz M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 42074-42081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) we set out to examine in real time, at a single neuron level the role of Bid in our model of caspase-independent, excitotoxic apoptosis. To identify the kinetics of Bid cleavage, cerebellar granule neurons were transiently transfected with the Bid-FRET probe, stimulated with glutamate for 5 min (Fig. 3A), and monitored for 24 h. Prior to stimulation the neurons showed an evenly distributed CFP and YFP fluorescence within the cell, a stable ΔΨm, and normal morphology (Fig. 4A). After glutamate-induced apoptosis (5.6 ± 1.6 h, seven separate experiments) there was a redistribution of both the CFP and YFP fluorescence in the perinuclear region indicating a translocation of FL-Bid-FRET probe to the mitochondria (Fig. 4B). This redistribution was paralleled with a depolarization of the ΔΨm and a condensation of the nucleus within the cell. After ∼20 min the YFP signal became homogenously distributed within the cell, whereas the CFP signal remained clustered in the perinuclear region (Fig. 4C), indicating a late cleavage of the Bid-FRET probe. Following the quantification of the fluorescent signals from neurons stimulated with glutamate for 5 min we were able to identify that the FRET disruption was significantly delayed (p < 0.01) in relation to the onset of mitochondrial depolarization (22.9 ± 7.8 min) or translocation of the probe to the mitochondria (25.2 ± 3.5 min) (Fig. 4, D-F, seven separate experiments). This was in stark contrast to the results obtained in MCF-7 cells (Figs. 2D and 4F). It is clear from these responses that a translocation of FL-Bid and a collapse of the ΔΨm occur prior to a cleavage of the Bid protein, indicating that Bid cleavage is a secondary event to translocation and mitochondrial depolarization. We next investigated whether FL-Bid translocation was specific for excitotoxic apoptosis. In previous studies we have used models of continuous glutamate receptor overactivation to induce rapid excitotoxic necrosis within cerebellar granule neurons (31Budd S.L. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2282-2291Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 32Ward M.W. Rego A.C. Frenguelli B.G. Nicholls D.G. J.

Cerebellar granule neurons transiently transfected with the Bid-FRET probe were exposed to glutamate continuously (32Ward M.W. Rego A.C. Frenguelli B.G. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7208-7219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and images were taken every 5 min. Prior to stimulation the neurons showed an evenly distributed CFP and YFP fluorescence within the cell, a stable ΔΨm, and normal morphology (Fig. 5A). After only 30 min of prolonged glutamate exposure there was a collapse of the ΔΨm with a rapid swelling of the nucleus and cell body (Fig. 5B). No redistribution of CFP or YFP fluorescence occurred under these conditions. Quantification of the fluorescent signals confirmed the absence of any Bid cleavage and translocation during the experiment. Similar results were observed in five separate experiments. Western Blot Analysis Confirms Translocation of FL-Bid from the Cytosolic to the Mitochondrial Fraction during Glutamate-induced Apoptosis—We employed Western blot analysis to verify whether the transient accumulation of FL-Bid at mitochondria can also be identified within a population of neurons. Cerebellar granule neurons were stimulated with glutamate for 5 min as before (Fig. 3A), and the neurons were harvested at several time points following the initial exposure (Fig. 6A). A 5-min glutamate stimulus was sufficient to induce a transient increase of FL-Bid in the mitochondrial containing pellet 4-6 h following the initial insult (Fig. 6A), a time point where neuronal injury, as measured by LDH release, is starting to increase (Fig. 3C). In cerebellar granule neurons transiently transfected with the Bid-FRET probe, cleavage occurred on average 5.9 ± 1.7 h after the initial glutamate exposure. Densitometric analysis of FL-Bid translocation from n = 4 separate experiments demonstrated a significant increase in FL-Bid with the mitochondrial pellet at this time point (6 h, Fig. 6B). The present study identifies two separate apoptotic pathways where Bid translocation to the mitochondria plays a significant role, caspase-dependent death receptor mediated apoptosis and caspase-independent glutamate-induced apoptosis (12Gross A. Yin X.M. Wang K. Wei M.C. Jockel J. Milliman C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol.

Death receptor-mediated apoptosis in MCF-7 cells involves the cleavage of FL-Bid, a translocation of tBid to the mitochondria, and a collapse of the ΔΨm. In contrast, glutamate-induced apoptosis in cerebellar granule neurons involved a translocation of the FL-Bid to the mitochondria, a depolarization of the ΔΨm with a downstream cleavage of the FL-Bid. This study highlights the power of single cell analysis in its ability to identify and resolve the cascade of events that take place within the cell once initiated. Here we identify that the onset of Bid cleavage, tBid translocation, and mitochondrial depolarization during death receptor-induced apoptosis occur in less than a 2-min time frame in MCF-7 cells. This temporal resolution would have been very difficult to resolve using classical population-based methods. Interestingly, the rapidity of these events parallels to that of cytochrome-c and Smac/DIABLO release during apoptosis that we and others have reported previously (35Waterhouse N.J.

Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 1031-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and may help explain the biological nature of these rapid release events. Our results also suggest that very little Bid translocation/cleavage may be sufficient to trigger mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization during death receptor-induced apoptosis. Our data also suggest that Bid is involved in additional, caspase-independent pathways such as those triggered intracellularly by the overactivation of glutamate receptors. Here we could demonstrate that glutamate-induced apoptosis involved the translocation of FL-Bid to the mitochondria. No cleavage by caspases (12Gross A. Yin X.M. Wang K. Wei M.C. Jockel J.

Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 3003-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) was required for this process. However, alternative proteases such as calpains and cathepsins may be involved in the cleavage of FL-Bid after its translocation to the mitochondria. In this study we identified that the collapse of the ΔΨm within our model of glutamate-induced apoptosis was associated with a rapid increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. As calpain activity is highly dependent on the concentration of Ca2+ within the cell (43Saido T.C. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar, 44Inomata M. Hayashi M. Nakamura M. Imahori K. Kawashima S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 98: 407-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), there is the potential for the activation of calpains following the collapse of the ΔΨm within these neurons. Indeed delayed calpain activation has recently been demonstrated in models of excitotoxic neuronal injury (45Bano D. Young K.W. Guerin C.J. Lefeuvre R. Rothwell N.J. Naldini L. Rizzuto R. Carafoli E. Nicotera P. Cell. 2005; 120: 275-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Interestingly, previous reports have demonstrated that the translocation of FL-Bid to the mitochondria may be activated during death receptor-induced apoptosis of Jurkat cells when caspase-8 activation is blocked or during anoikis in epithelial cells (46Tafani M. Karpinich N.O. Hurster K.A. Pastorino J.G. Schneider T. Russo M.A. Farber J.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 32848-32857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Overexpression of FL-Bid or a Bid mutant that cannot be cleaved by caspase-8 was likewise sufficient to activate cell death in Bid- or caspase-8-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (48Sarig R. Zaltsman Y. Marcellus R.C. Flavell R. Mak T.W. Gross A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10707-10715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It is well established that FL-Bid is capable but less potent than tBid in inducing the release of cytochrome-c from isolated mitochondria or permeabilized cells. However, evidence has been presented that changes in the cellular phospholipid content such as increased phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylglycerol levels enhances the ability of FL-Bid to translocate and to permeabilize mitochondria (49Esposti M.D. Erler J.T. Hickman J.A. Dive C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 7268-7276Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). FL-Bid has been shown to insert specific lysophosphati-dylcholine species into the membrane surface, thereby triggering the release of apoptogenic factors (50Goonesinghe A. Mundy E.S. Smith M. Khosravi-Far R. Martinou J.C. Esposti M.D. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these alterations in phospholipids have been shown to be a hallmark of excitotoxic, Ca2+-dependent cell death (51Gasull T. DeGregorio-Rocasolano N. Zapata A. Trullas R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18350-18357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that FL-Bid is able to oligomerize and trigger the insertion of Bax in isolated mitochondria (17Eskes R. Desagher S. Antonsson B. Martinou J.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Excitotoxic injury and subsequent changes in phospholipid composition may therefore convert FL-Bid into a “tBid”-like protein that is subsequently able to activate mitochondrial cell death pathways. This study demonstrates the power of single cell imaging for the study of protein translocation and protein cleavage during apoptosis. It specifically enhances our understanding of the distinct role of Bid during death receptor mediated caspase-dependent and excitotoxic mediated caspase-independent apoptosis that could be potentially missed in population-based studies. We thank Helena Bonner for technical assistance and Dr. R. Onuki for providing the Bid FRET plasmid."

Moreover, recent fluorescence transfer and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy data confirm the existence of STAT3 dimers and higher order statosome complexes (200-400 kDa and 1-2 MDa) in the cytoplasm of live cells (15Kretzschmar A.K.

That different growth factor and cytokine receptors are associated with the endocytic pathway and can even maintain their ongoing signaling function from this membrane-bound compartment has been clearly delineated (18Thiel S.

Nevertheless, today, the widely represented model of IL-6/STAT3 signaling is that of an activation process at the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane with departure of “activated” STATs into the free soluble cytosol with little consideration of membrane-associated transit through the cytoplasm (see Ref. 2Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (2501) Google Scholar for a depiction of this model). We earlier reported that the IL-6-activated STAT3 transcription factor had a cytoplasmic punctate appearance in human liver Hep3B cells in immunofluorescence studies (21Rayanade R.J. Patel K.

Etlinger J.D. Sehgal P.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 325-334PubMed Google Scholar). In cell fractionation experiments we reported the association of Western-blottable STAT3 and PY-STAT3 as well as DNA-binding competent PY-STAT3 with a large granular membrane fraction (the “P15 fraction”) as well as a P100 sedimentable cytoplasmic fraction (6Sehgal P.B.

These data were at variance with the idea of IL-6/STAT3 signaling as exclusively a soluble cytosolic process. In this report we demonstrate the association of STAT3 and PY-STAT3 with the purified early endosome fraction and provide evidence for a significant role of this pathway in the transcriptional activation function of STAT3. Cell Growth and Fractionation—Human liver Hep3B cells were grown as described earlier (5Ndubuisi M.I. Guo G.G. Fried V.A. Etlinger J.D. Sehgal P.B. J. Biol.

In different experiments cells were treated with IL-6 (10 ng/ml, R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN), phenylarsine oxide (PAO, 5 μm, Sigma-Aldrich), or 2,3-mercaptopropanol (50 μm, Sigma) as indicated. Unless indicated otherwise, cell fractionation into a nuclear fraction and the post-nuclear P15 large granular membrane fraction, the P100 and S100 cytoplasmic fractions, DNA shift assays for activated STAT3 using the m67-SIE probe, Western blotting and enzymatic assays for 5′-nucleotidase, and lactate dehydrogenase were carried out using methods previously described (5Ndubuisi M.I.

Purification of Early Endosomal Fraction—This was carried out using the procedure of Aniento et al. (26Aniento F. Gu F. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Briefly, Hep3B cells were scraped into 2 ml of buffer H (3 mm imidazole, 1 mm EGTA, 8.55% sucrose, pH 7.4), broken by Dounce homogenization, the postnuclear supernatant adjusted to 40.6% sucrose, and subjected to equilibrium flotation through layers of 35%, 25%, and 8.55% sucrose. As previously characterized (26Aniento F. Gu F. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), the visible band at the 35/25% interface corresponds to the early endosome (EE) fraction, that at the 25/8.55% interface to late endosomes (LE), and the one at the 40.6/35% interface to heavy membranes (HM). Aliquots of the soluble (S) and the pellet (P) fractions were also collected from within the 40.6% loading region (1 ml out of 4 ml loaded) and the bottom, respectively. Immunoisolation Using Anti-STAT3 pAb-coupled Magnetic Beads— Anti-STAT3 rabbit IgG (H190X, gelatin-free, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was coupled to tosyl-activated 2.8-μm paramagnetic Dynabeads (Dynal Biotech Inc., Brown Deer, WI) using procedures provided by the manufacturer (100 μg of IgG coupled to 4 × 108 beads). As a control, non-immune rabbit IgG (Sigma) was also coupled to Dynabeads in parallel. Intact membrane elements were isolated using these beads in buffer H while protein complexes were isolated in detergent-containing buffers (e.g. 0.05-0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS) as described earlier (7Shah M. Patel K. Fried V.A. Sehgal P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45662-45669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 25Shah M. Patel K. Sehgal P.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: C850-C862Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Alternatively immunopanning for protein complexes was carried out using anti-STAT3 pAb (C-20) in buffer adjusted to 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS and Protein A-magnetic beads. Electron Microscopy of STAT3-carrying Membrane Elements—Immunoisolates derived from purified early endosome fractions using anti-STAT3- or IgG-coupled Dynabeads (2.8 ± 0.2-μm diameter) in buffer H, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde. Whole mount negatively stained specimens spotted on Formvar-coated grids were examined using an Hitachi H7000 electron microscope. Confocal Immunofluorescence Microscopy—This was carried out as described previously using several different fixation protocols as indicated in respective figures (methanol-acetone fixation, fixation in cold paraformaldehyde/Triton, or with formaldehyde (37 °C)/Triton (21Rayanade R.J.

Secondary antibodies included corresponding AlexaFluor 488-, AlexaFluor 594-, and AlexaFluor 647-tagged antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Images were collected using an MRC 1024 ES (Bio-Rad) confocal microscopy system. All data within each experiment were collected at identical imaging settings. Deconvolution of collected images was carried out using the Iterative Deconvolve 3D plugin (DAMAS3 algorithm) for National Institutes of Health (NIH) Image J. Colocalization Image Analyses—Dual channel colocalization analysis was performed on randomly selected sections of the images representing cytoplasmic signals using the NIH Image J software and the Colocalization Threshold and Colocalization Test plug-ins. The Colocalization Threshold tool calculates the Mander's coefficients M1 and M2 representing the number of colocalized pixels expressed as a fraction of the number of the pixels within the respective channels. Zero-zero pixels are ignored for purposes of this calculation. The Mander's coefficients range from 0 to 1 and are independent of the pixel intensities within the individual channels (27Manders E.M.M. Verbeek F.J. Aten J.A. J. Microsc. 1993; 169: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar). Pearson's correlation co-efficient (R), a well known index to determine pattern similarity (28Manders E.M. Stap J. Brakenhoff G.J. van Driel R. Aten J.A. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 857-862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was determined by both plug-ins and matched well. The Colocalization Test tool was used to generate random images using an approach described by Costes et al. (29Costes S.V. Daelemans D. Cho E.H. Dobbin Z. Pavlakis G. Lockett S. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3993-4003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). Briefly, scrambled images from the second channel are compared with the first channel to determine if the colocalization occurs as a matter of chance. To generate the scrambled images, blocks of pixels are rearranged at random and the Pearson's R is calculated for each new random image. For each comparison, 3000 such random images were generated, and the values of the random R (R(rand)) were compared with the actual R. Plasmids, Transient Transfection, and Luciferase Reporter Assays— The pSTAT3/Luciferase reporter was a gift from Dr. David Levy, New York University and carried two tandem repeats of the acute phase response element of α2-macroglobulin (30Nakajima K.

The p950M4/luciferase reporter, containing four copies of the STAT3-binding DNA element from the human angiotensinogen promoter (5′-CGTTTCTGGGAACCT-3′) cloned into pBL2Luc, was a gift from Dr. Ashok Kumar, New York Medical College (7Shah M. Patel K. Fried V.A. Sehgal P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45662-45669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The expression vector for dynaminK44A and for clathrin light chain were gifts from Dr. Lois Greene, NHLBI, National Institutes of Health (31Wu X. Zhao X. Baylor L. Kaushal S. Eisenberg E. Greene L.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Vectors for a truncated amphiphysin A1 dominant negative mutant and for epsin2a were provided by Dr. Richard Jove, University of South Florida (32Bild A.H. Turkson J. Jove R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3255-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and that for the MxA dynamin species was a gift from Dr. Otto Haller (Universität Freiberg, Freiberg, Germany) (33Kochs G. Haener M. Aebi U. Haller O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14172-14176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Transient transfection assays in cultures of Hep3B cells in 6-well plates were carried out as described earlier (7Shah M. Patel K. Fried V.A. Sehgal P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45662-45669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Transfections were carried out at least in triplicate for each variable, and luciferase activity is expressed in arbitrary units (as mean ± S.E.) after normalization with the β-galactosidase activity among different samples. The Student's t test was used to assess statistical significance. Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal IgGs to STAT3 (C20, H190, and H190X), and respective immunogen peptides to which pAbs C20 (STAT3) and sc-894 (cav-1) had been raised, and murine mAb to PY-STAT3 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit pAb to PY-STAT3 was purchased from Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, whereas murine mAbs against STAT3, clathrin heavy chain (CHC), EEA1, Rab5, and LAMP1 were obtained from BD Biosciences. Non-immune rabbit IgG was purchased from Sigma. Association of STAT3 and PY-STAT3 with the Purified Early Endosome Fraction—Three observations, taken together, prompted us to investigate the association of STAT3 with cytoplasmic membrane elements. First, we observed the association of STAT3 and IL-6-activated PY-STAT3 with cytoplasmic membrane fractions, which lacked detectable levels of the plasma membrane marker 5′-nucleotidase and of the cytosolic marker lactate dehydrogenase (Fig. 1A). Second, immunopanning analyses using anti-STAT3 pAb covalently coupled to paramagnetic beads, followed by SDS-PAGE, Coomassie staining, and mass spectrometry-MALDI TOF-based identification of proteins led to the observation that membrane-associated STAT3 was in complexes with CHC (Fig. 1, B and C). Moreover, this association between STAT3 and CHC was also observed in the soluble cytosol S100-derived 1- to 2-MDa statosome II complexes previously reported by us (Fig. 1D), reminiscent of the constitutively cycling membrane-associated and soluble pools of CHC in the endocytic pathway. Third, STAT3 and PY-STAT3 showed punctuate cytoplasmic immunofluorescence (21Rayanade R.J. Patel K. Ndubuisi M. Sharma S. Omura S. Etlinger J.D. Pine R. Sehgal P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 4659-4662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22Rayanade R.J. Ndubuisi M.I. Etlinger J.D. Sehgal P.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 325-334PubMed Google Scholar). Early and late endosome fractions were purified from control and IL-6-treated Hep3B cells using an established approach (26Aniento F. Gu F. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 29-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A provides evidence for the constitutive association of STAT3 with both the early and late endosome fractions as well as the clear association of PY-STAT3 with purified early endosomes. It is also clear that in these fractions most of the STAT3 and PY-STAT3 was not associated with the gp130 chain of the IL-6 receptor per se. Fig. 2B illustrates the characterization of the purification scheme used to obtain the early endosome fraction and provides a “bookkeeping” account of the distribution of STAT3 and PY-STAT3 and various markers in different fractions. As expected, the purified EE fraction was positive for the early endosome markers EEA1 and Rab5, for CHC and for the transferrin receptor. Remarkably, although >90% of bulk cytoplasmic STAT3 was present in the soluble fraction, up to two-thirds of cytoplasmic PY-STAT3 was in the EE fraction. Fig. 2C shows negative-stained whole mount electron microscopy of anti-STAT3-immunoisolated vesicles from the LE and EE fractions. These data show that the STAT3-bearing vesicles in the LE and EE fractions are different in appearance and that those in the EE fraction are clearly “coated.” As controls, non-immune rabbit IgG-coupled beads failed to pull out any detectable vesicular elements (data not shown). The anti-STAT3 immunoisolates from the EE fraction were positive for CHC, and the hepatocyte growth factor regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HRS) (34Hicke L. Dunn R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar) but not for the Smad anchor for receptor activation as assayed by Western blotting (data not shown). Confocal Immunofluorescence Studies—As an independent approach, we used confocal double-label immunofluorescence microscopy to identify the punctuate structures with which STAT3 was associated in the cytoplasm (21Rayanade R.J. Patel K. Ndubuisi M. Sharma S. Omura S. Etlinger J.D. Pine R. Sehgal P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 4659-4662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22Rayanade R.J. Ndubuisi M.I. Etlinger J.D. Sehgal P.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 325-334PubMed Google Scholar). Supplemental Fig. S1 shows that this punctate cytoplasmic STAT3 immunostaining was observed using three different fixation methods. A relevant, but not an irrelevant peptide, specifically inhibited this immunostaining; three different antibodies to STAT3 all immunostained punctate cytoplasmic organelles with a perinuclear preponderance (Supplemental Fig. S1B), whereas non-immune rabbit IgG did not display any immunostaining (Supplemental Fig. S1C). IL-6 clearly and markedly enhanced immunostaining for STAT3 in the nuclear compartment further validating our anti-STAT3 reagents. In additional control experiments using Western blotting we observed that cellular STAT3 was partially lost during fixation (data not shown). The methanol-acetone fixation method produced the least loss with the paraformaldehyde/Triton and formaldehyde/Triton fixations producing losses of up to half of total cellular STAT3. Thus we infer that the cytoplasmic punctate immunostaining of STAT3 observed likely reflects an image following removal of some cytosolic STAT3. Fig. 3 is a composite summary of the colocalization of STAT3 and PY-STAT3 in cytoplasmic organelles with markers of the endocytic pathway (colocalization of STAT3 or PY-STAT3 assessed one at a time with CHC, EEA1, Rab5, and α-adaptin). The insets within each panel point specifically to vesicular cytoplasmic elements showing overlap. Importantly, Table 1 summarizes statistical colocalization metrics of respective analyses of pair-wise antigen comparisons. The statistical analyses in Table 1 of the images in Fig. 3 demonstrate rigorously the colocalization of cytoplasmic STAT3 and PY-STAT3 with markers of the endocytic pathway.TABLE 1Colocalization analysisAntigen pair (green/red)Mander's coefficientsPearson's RCostes' randomizationM1aM1: Mander's coefficient for Channel 1 (this represents the number of colocalized pixels in the green channel expressed as a fraction of the total number of non zero-zero pixels in that channel)M2bM2: Mander's coefficient for Channel 2 (this represents the number of colocalized pixels in the red channel expressed as a fraction of the total number of non zero-zero pixels in that channel).

Smith I. Penman S. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 17: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 36Penman S. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 17: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 37Yeung Y.G.

Supplementary Fig. S2A shows that, when the detergent series saponin, Brij-58, and Triton/0.1%SDS was used to dissect Hep3B cells, >90% of cytoplasmic STAT3 was released by digitonin (which makes holes in the plasma membrane) but only one-quarter of IL-6-induced cytoplasmic PY-STAT3. Conversely, release of most of PY-STAT3 (>70%) required Brij-58. Release of the majority of the early endosomal antigen EEA1 also required Brij-58. It should be noted parenthetically that digitonin and saponin selectively permeabilize the plasma membrane but do not solubilize the cholesterol-poor endomembranes. Using a different detergent pair (digitonin and Brij-58), the data in Supplementary Fig. S2B represent an independent confirmation of the observation that while the bulk of STAT3 is released by digitonin alone, release of the majority of PY-STAT3 requires Brij-58. Dynamic Constitutive Cycling of STAT3 at Cellular Membranes—Clathrin is known to dynamically associate with the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane and dissociate from internalized cytoplasmic vesicular elements in a constitutive manner with a t½ of ∼30 s (31Wu X.

https://openalex.org/W2077090467,"Adiponectin (Acrp30) is an insulin-sensitizing hormone produced and secreted exclusively by adipose tissue. Confocal fluorescent microscopy demonstrated the colocalization of adiponectin with the Golgi membrane markers p115, β-COP, and the trans-Golgi network marker, syntaxin 6. Treatment of cells with brefeldin A redistributed adiponectin to the endoplasmic reticulum where it colocalized with the chaperone protein BIP and inhibited secretion of adiponectin demonstrating a requirement for a functional Golgi apparatus for adiponectin release. Confocal fluorescent microscopy also demonstrated a colocalization of endogenous adiponectin with that of expressed GGA1myc (Golgi-localizing γ-adaptin ear homology ARF-binding protein) but with no significant overlap between adiponectin and the GGA2myc or GGA3myc isoforms. Consistent with confocal fluorescent microscopy, transmission electron microscopy demonstrated the colocalization of GGA1 with adiponectin. Although GGA1 did not directly interact with the adiponectin protein, the adiponectin enriched membrane compartments of adipocyte were precipitated by a GST-GGA1 cargo binding domain (VHS) fusion protein but not with a GST-GGA2 VHS or GST-GGA3 VHS fusion proteins. Moreover, co-expression of adiponectin with a GGA1 dominant-interfering mutant (GGA1-VHS GAT domain) resulted in a marked inhibition of adiponectin secretion in both 3T3L1 adipocytes and HEK293 cells, whereas no inhibition was detected with the truncated mutants GGA2-VHSGAT or GGA3-VHSGAT. Moreover, co-expression of wild type GGA1 with adiponectin enhanced secretion of adiponectin. Interestingly, leptin secretion was unaffected by neither the wild type form or GGA1 mutant. Taken together these data demonstrate that the trafficking of adiponectin through its secretory pathway is dependent on GGA-coated vesicles.

Over the past several years many studies have documented that in addition to being a fat storage depot, adipocytes are a bona fide endocrine tissue that secrete several hormones that control insulin sensitivity and energy balance (1Shuldiner A.

However, in serum adiponectin circulates as two forms, a lower molecular weight trimer-dimer and a higher oligomeric molecular weight complex. Recent studies have demonstrated that disulfide bond formation through Cys-39 is essential for the assembly of the higher oligomeric complexes (33Pajvani U. Du X. Combs T. Berg A. Rajala M.

There are three different isoforms of GGA proteins termed GGA1, GGA2, and GGA3. These proteins have a modular structure consisting of an NH2-terminal VHS (Vps27, Hrs, STAM) domain, and Arf-binding GAT (GGA and TOM1) domain, a clathrin binding hinge region, and a COOH-terminal γ-adaptin “ear” (GAE) domain.

Consistent with the morphological observations, secretion of adiponectin is severely inhibited by treatment of cells with brefeldin A (BFA). Furthermore a dominant-interfering mutant of the GGA1 protein (GGA1 VHS GAT domain) was able to block both traffic of the GLUT4 glucose transporter to its insulin-sensitive intracellular compartment and secretion of adiponectin but did not affect leptin secretion. In addition, confocal and transmission electron microscopy studies showed colocalization of adiponectin with the GGA1 isoform. These data suggest that adiponectin (but not leptin) secretion is dependent on GGA proteins and suggest that GGA adaptors participate in the regulation of selective adipokine trafficking in adipocytes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Brefeldin A and cycloheximide were obtained from Sigma.

https://openalex.org/W2034222489,"A cell surface receptor complex consisting of CD14, Toll-like receptor (TLR4), and MD-2 recognizes lipid A, the active moiety of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Escherichia coli-type lipid A, a typical lipid A molecule, potently activates both human and mouse macrophage cells, whereas the lipid A precursor, lipid IVa, activates mouse macrophages but is inactive and acts as an LPS antagonist in human macrophages. This animal species-specific activity of lipid IVa involves the species differences in MD-2 structure. We explored the structural region of MD-2 that determines the agonistic and antagonistic activities of lipid IVa to induce nuclear factor-κB activation. By expressing human/mouse chimeric MD-2 together with mouse CD14 and TLR4 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, we found that amino acid regions 57–79 and 108–135 of MD-2 determine the species-specific activity of lipid IVa. We also showed that the replacement of Thr57, Val61, and Glu122 of mouse MD-2 with corresponding human MD-2 sequence or alanines impaired the agonistic activity of lipid IVa, and antagonistic activity became evident. These mutations did not affect the activation of nuclear factor-κB, TLR4 oligomerization, and inducible phosphorylation of IκBα in response to E. coli-type lipid A. These results indicate that amino acid residues 57, 61, and 122 of mouse MD-2 are critical to determine the agonist-antagonist activity of lipid IVa and suggest that these amino acid residues may be involved in the discrimination of lipid A structure. A cell surface receptor complex consisting of CD14, Toll-like receptor (TLR4), and MD-2 recognizes lipid A, the active moiety of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Escherichia coli-type lipid A, a typical lipid A molecule, potently activates both human and mouse macrophage cells, whereas the lipid A precursor, lipid IVa, activates mouse macrophages but is inactive and acts as an LPS antagonist in human macrophages. This animal species-specific activity of lipid IVa involves the species differences in MD-2 structure. We explored the structural region of MD-2 that determines the agonistic and antagonistic activities of lipid IVa to induce nuclear factor-κB activation. By expressing human/mouse chimeric MD-2 together with mouse CD14 and TLR4 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, we found that amino acid regions 57–79 and 108–135 of MD-2 determine the species-specific activity of lipid IVa. We also showed that the replacement of Thr57, Val61, and Glu122 of mouse MD-2 with corresponding human MD-2 sequence or alanines impaired the agonistic activity of lipid IVa, and antagonistic activity became evident. These mutations did not affect the activation of nuclear factor-κB, TLR4 oligomerization, and inducible phosphorylation of IκBα in response to E. coli-type lipid A. These results indicate that amino acid residues 57, 61, and 122 of mouse MD-2 are critical to determine the agonist-antagonist activity of lipid IVa and suggest that these amino acid residues may be involved in the discrimination of lipid A structure. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 2The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; HEK293, human embryonic kidney 293 cells; hMD-2, human MD-2; IκBα, inhibitor of NF-κB α; mMD-2, mouse MD-2; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TLR, Toll-like receptor. is a constituent of the outer membrane of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria and plays a major role in septic shock (1Schletter J.

Immunol. 1995; 13: 437-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar). Engagement of LPS on the host cell results in rapid activation of a number of transcription factors, including NF-κB, which leads to production of inflammatory cytokines (3Hatada E.N. Krappmann D. Scheidereit C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Significant progress has been made in the identification of cell surface molecules that recognize LPS and transmit its signal to intracellular components. CD14, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and MD-2 participate in this molecular event and all of these molecules are necessary for cells to respond to picomolar concentrations of LPS (4Fujihara M. Muroi M. Tanamoto K. Suzuki T. Azuma H. Ikeda H. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 100: 171-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 5Miyake K. Trends Microbiol. 2004; 12: 186-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). A recent report (6Gioannini T.L. Teghanemt A. Zhang D. Coussens N.P. Dockstader W. Ramaswamy S. Weiss J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4186-4191Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) has suggested that sequential interactions of LPS with each of these molecules are required for optimal molecular recognition. LPS is first opsonized by the serum LPS-binding protein and then transferred to a CD14 molecule. This LPS-CD14 complex is further recognized by MD-2 to generate an LPS-MD-2 complex that produces TLR4-dependent cell stimulation. It has also been reported that MD-2 is necessary for TLR4 to undergo proper glycosylation and trafficking to the cell surface (7Nagai Y. Akashi S. Nagafuku M. Ogata M. Iwakura Y. Akira S. Kitamura T.

Immunol. 2003; 10: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Without MD-2, TLR4 is not able to reach the plasma membrane and resides predominantly in the Golgi apparatus. Thus, MD-2 is considered to play an important role for transferring LPS from CD14 to TLR4 and for correct cellular distribution of TLR4. MD-2 also plays an important role for discriminating lipid A structure. The lipid A portion has been identified as the active center responsible for most LPS-induced biological effects (1Schletter J. Heine H. Ulmer A.J. Rietschel E.T. Arch. Microbiol. 1995; 164: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 10Lüderitz O. Freudenberg M. Galanos C. Lehmann E.T. Rietschel E.T. Shaw D.H. Curr. Top Membr. Transp. 1982; 17: 79-151Crossref Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli-type lipid A, a typical lipid A molecule, and its biosynthetic precursor lipid IVa have been synthesized chemically (compound 506 and 406, respectively), and their biological activities have been investigated extensively. Compound 506 and most varieties of LPS show little animal species-specific activity, whereas lipid IVa, as well as Salmonella-type lipid A, shows very little stimulatory activity and behaves as an antagonist in human macrophages, despite being potently active in murine macrophages (11Tanamoto K. Azumi S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3149-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 12Means T.K. Golenbock D.T. Fenton M.J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). This species-specific activity of lipid IVa and Salmonella-type lipid A has been attributed to the species difference in the structures of TLR4 (13Poltorak A. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Citterio S.

Azuma H. Ikeda H. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 100: 171-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 15Akashi S. Nagai Y. Ogata H. Oikawa M. Fukase K. Kusumoto S. Kawasaki K. Nishijima M. Hayashi S.

Immunol. 2002; 3: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Thus it is considered that MD-2 is also playing an important role for discriminating lipid A structure. To understand the molecular basis for this discriminating mechanism, we, in the present study, explored the structural region of MD-2 which determines the agonistic and antagonistic activities of lipid IVa. Cell Culture and Reagents—The HEK293 cell line (obtained from the Human Science Research Resources Bank, Tokyo, Japan) was grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Compound 506 and lipid IVa (compound 406) were obtained from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). An antiserum against EIAV-tag epitope (amino acid sequence: ADRRIPGTAEE) was a kind gift from Dr. Nancy Rice (NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center). Stable transfectants expressing mouse CD14, EIAV-tagged mouse TLR4, FLAG-tagged mouse TLR4, and either EIAV-tagged mouse MD-2 or EIAV-tagged mouse MD-2-T57A,V61A,E122A were established as follows. After linearizing with PvuI, expression plasmids encoding the proteins described above were transfected into HEK293 cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Stable transfectants were selected for G418 resistance at a concentration of 2 mg/ml. A monoclonal antibody (clone 5A5) that recognizes phosphorylated Ser32-Ser36 of IκBα was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Expression Plasmids—Expression plasmids encoding CD14, TLR4, and MD-2 as well as NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter plasmid pELAM-L were described previously (16Muroi M. Ohnishi T. Tanamoto K. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 3546-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids encoding MD-2 mutants were created by PCR-mediated mutagenesis, and mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. NF-κB Reporter Assay—The NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter assay was performed as described elsewhere (18Muroi M. Tanamoto K. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 6043-6047Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells (1–3 × 105/well) were plated in 12-well plates and on the following day transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method with 10 ng each of CD14, TLR4, and MD-2 mutant expression plasmids together with 0.1 μg of pELAM-L and 2.5 ng of phRL-TK (Promega, Madison, WI) for normalization. At 24 h after transfection, cells were stimulated for 6 h, and the reporter gene activity was measured according to the manufacturer’s (Promega) instructions. Detection of MD-2 Proteins Expressed on the Cell Surface—Detection of cell surface MD-2 was performed as described previously (19Muroi M. Ohnishi T. Tanamoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42372-42379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Briefly, HEK293 cells were plated in 6-cm dishes and transfected with indicated plasmids by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. After 24 h, the cells were transferred to 1.5-ml tubes and then washed twice with PBS. After suspension with 0.5 ml of PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+, cells were exposed to 0.5 mg/ml of a membrane-impermeable biotinylation reagent (sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-biotin; Pierce) at 4 °C for 15 min. The reaction was quenched by adding 1 ml of culture medium, and then cell extracts were prepared with 0.35 ml of PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, and a protease inhibitor mix (Roche Applied Science). After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatants obtained were incubated with immobilized streptavidin-agarose at 4 °C for 1 h. The agarose was washed three times with PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, and subsequently biotinylated proteins were eluted from the agarose by incubating with 5 mg/ml of a water-soluble biotin derivative (sulfo-NHS-biotin; Pierce) dissolved in a buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). The supernatant obtained was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analyzes. Immunoprecipitation—HEK293 cells (2–5 × 107 cells) stably expressing mouse CD14, EIAV-tagged mouse TLR4, FLAG-tagged mouse TLR4, and either EIAV-tagged mouse MD-2 or EIAV-tagged mouse MD-2-T57A,V61A,E122A were suspended into 1 ml of culture medium. After stimulation with compound 506 or lipid IVa, cells were washed with cold PBS, and cell extracts were prepared with PBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 μm okadaic acid, and a protease inhibitor mix (Roche Applied Science). To the cell extracts, anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The agarose was washed three times with PBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and subsequently bound proteins were eluted from the agarose by incubating with an elution buffer (0.1 m glycine, pH 3.5, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). The supernatant obtained was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analyses. Responsiveness to Lipid A Molecules in HEK293 Cells Expressing CD14, TLR4, and MD-2—We first attempted to confirm the involvement of MD-2 in the animal species-specific activity of lipid IVa in HEK293 cells, which only respond to lipid A for the activation of NF-κB when CD14, TLR4, and MD-2 molecules are present. In HEK293 cells transiently expressing mouse CD14, TLR4, and MD-2, both compound 506 and lipid IVa comparably stimulated the NF-κB-dependent reporter activity (Fig. 1A). When mouse MD-2 was replaced with human MD-2, compound 506 still actively stimulated cells, whereas the response to lipid IVa was substantially impaired (Fig. 1B). To examine the antagonistic activity of lipid IVa, HEK293 cells expressing mouse CD14, TLR4, and either mouse MD-2 or human MD-2 were stimulated with compound 506 in the presence of increasing concentrations of lipid IVa (Fig. 2). In cells expressing mouse MD-2, NF-κB-dependent reporter activity stimulated with 10 ng/ml compound 506 was almost unaffected by lipid IVa. In contrast, when mouse MD-2 was replaced with human MD-2, lipid IVa inhibited the compound 506-induced activation of NF-κB in a concentration-dependent manner. These results indicate that the difference in MD-2 structure between human and mouse is involved in determining the agonist-antagonist activity of lipid IVa. MD-2 Structural Region Involved in Determining Agonist-Antagonist Activity of Lipid IVa—To explore the MD-2 structure required for the agonist-antagonist activity of lipid IVa, the coding region of mouse MD-2 was divided into six regions, and a series of MD-2 mutant plasmids in which each region was replaced with corresponding human MD-2 sequence was created (Fig. 3A). These chimeric mutants were expressed in HEK293 cells together with mouse CD14 and TLR4, and the NF-κB-dependent reporter activity was investigated (Fig. 3B). The cell surface expression of each of these MD-2 mutants was confirmed by Western blotting of biotinylated cell surface proteins, indicating that each of these mutants was similar enough to the parental mouse protein to be delivered to the cell membrane (Fig. 3C). Cells expressing each of the MD-2 mutants responded to compound 506 comparably with slight variations, indicating that all of these mutants functioned properly. In contrast, the activity of lipid IVa varied and was substantially impaired in cells expressing the mMD-2-N3h mutant. The activity was similar to that observed in cells expressing human MD-2. A partial reduction with a statistical significance in the activity of lipid IVa was also observed in mMD-2-N2h and mMD-2-N5h mutants as well as in mMD-2-N1h to a lesser extent. The antagonistic activity of lipid IVa was also studied in these MD-2 mutants by stimulating with compound 506 in the presence of lipid IVa. (Fig. 3B). In cells expressing mouse MD-2, lipid IVa did not inhibit the compound 506-induced activation of NF-κB, whereas in cells expressing human MD-2 the activity of compound 506 was inhibited substantially by lipid IVa as mentioned above. When MD-2 mutants were expressed, the activity of compound 506 was inhibited by lipid IVa in cells expressing the mMD-2-N3h mutant to a degree similar to that observed with human MD-2. These results suggest that the N3 region of MD-2 is involved in the animal species-specific activity of lipid IVa. We next asked whether the N3 region of MD-2 is critical for establishing the agonist-antagonist activity of lipid IVa. To address this, HEK293 cells expressing mouse CD14, TLR4, and N3 chimeras or parental MD-2 were stimulated with compound 506 in the presence of increasing concentrations of lipid IVa (Fig. 4A). As expected, lipid IVa concentration-dependently inhibited the compound 506-induced activation of NF-κB in cells expressing the N3h mutant; however, the inhibitory activity was relatively weaker than that observed in cells expressing the parental hMD-2. If the N3 region of MD-2 is the only region responsible for the species-specific activity of lipid IVa, it was expected that replacing the N3 region of human MD-2 with the corresponding mouse MD-2 sequence would show the mouse phenotype. However, a slight inhibitory effect of lipid IVa was still observed in cells expressing the N3m chimera (hMD-2-N3m). In addition, the agonistic activity of lipid IVa in cells expressing this N3m chimera only reached ∼73% of the activity observed in cells expressing the parental mouse MD-2 (Fig. 4B). The above result brought us to explore another MD-2 region, in addition to the N3 region, that is involved in the agonist-antagonist activity of lipid IVa. Because a slight antagonistic activity of lipid IVa was observed in mMD-2-N2h and mMD-2-N5h mutants (Fig. 3B), we created MD-2 mutant plasmids in which both the N2 and N3 regions or the N3 and N5 regions were mutated. These MD-2 mutants were used to examine the NF-κB-dependent reporter activity in HEK293 cells expressing mouse CD14, TLR4 (Fig. 5A). Compound 506 showed activity comparable with all of these MD-2 mutants. With the MD-2 mutant in which the N2 and N3 regions of human MD-2 were replaced with corresponding mouse sequences (hMD-2-N23m) and the mutant in which the N2 and N3 regions of mouse MD-2 were replaced with corresponding human sequences (mMD-2-N23h), lipid IVa showed partial agonistic and partial antagonistic activities. Contrarily, lipid IVa showed a strong agonistic activity with the MD-2 mutant in which the N3 and N5 regions of human MD-2 were replaced with corresponding mouse sequences (hMD-2-N35m), and almost no agonistic activity of lipid IVa, even at 1 μg/ml, was observed with a mutant in which the N3 and N5 regions of mouse MD-2 were replaced with corresponding human sequences (mMD-2-N35h). The antagonistic activity of lipid IVa was also examined with these mutants (Fig. 5B). Almost no antagonistic activity was observed with hMD-2-N35m, and a clear antagonistic activity was observed with mMD-2-N35h. In addition, lipid IVa caused almost no agonistic activity in cells expressing mMD-2-N35h and showed a potent agonistic activity comparable with that observed with wild-type mouse MD-2 (see Fig. 1A) in cells expressing hMD-2-N35m (Fig. 5C). These results indicate that both of the N3 and N5 regions of MD-2 are involved in determining the agonist-antagonist activity of lipid IVa. MD-2 Structural Region Involved in Antagonistic Activity of Lipid IVa—Replacement of the N3 and N5 regions of mouse MD-2 with corresponding human sequences changed the activity of lipid IVa from agonistic to antagonistic without affecting the activity of compound 506. Human and mouse MD-2 possess a similar amino acid sequence in their N5 regions with only a major difference at amino acid 122, a change in charge. Thus, to investigate the involvement of amino acid 122 of MD-2 in the activity of lipid IVa, we examined the antagonistic activity of lipid IVa with a mouse MD-2 mutant (mMD-2-N3h-E122K) in which the N3 region and amino acid 122 were replaced with the corresponding human sequence and a human MD-2 mutant (hMD-2-N3m-K122E) in which the N3 region and amino acid 122 were replaced with the corresponding mouse sequence (Fig. 6). A stronger antagonistic activity was observed in cells expressing mMD-2-N3h-E122K compared with those expressing mMD-2-N3h (see Fig. 4). On the other hand, almost no antagonistic effect was observed with hMD-2-N3m-K122E. It is therefore likely that the involvement of the N5 region is explained by amino acid 122. We next asked whether the involvement of the N3 region was also explained at the amino acid level. To address this, each amino acid of the N3 region of mouse MD-2, carrying E122K mutation, was replaced individually with the corresponding human amino acid residue, and the antagonistic activity of lipid IVa was examined (Fig. 7A). Although compound 506-induced activation of NF-κB was inhibited to some extent in cells expressing these MD-2 mutants, sufficient antagonistic activities were not observed. Thus we created mouse MD-2 mutant plasmids in which the overlapping three regions (amino acid residues 57–65, 64–73, and 69–78) within N3 and amino acid 122 were replaced with the corresponding human sequences (each named as N3Nh,E122K, N3Mh,E122K, N3Ch,E122K), and the antagonistic activity of lipid IVa was examined (Fig. 7B). A potent antagonistic effect of lipid IVa was observed with the N3Nh,E122K mutant, indicating that amino acid residues 57–65 and 122 of human MD-2 play a role in the antagonistic effect. Because the N3 region of human MD-2 is leucine-rich, we suspected that two leucines (amino acids 60 and 61) might be involved in the antagonistic effect. Thus we created a mouse MD-2 mutant plasmid carrying F60L, V61L, and E122K mutations. Furthermore, because relatively potent antagonistic effects were observed with T57S,E122K and V61L,E122 mutants (Fig. 7A), we also created a mouse MD-2 mutant plasmid carrying T57S, V61L, and E122K mutations. Agonistic effects of compound 506 and lipid IVa as well as antagonistic effects of lipid IVa were examined (Fig. 7C). Only partial agonistic and antagonistic activities of lipid IVa were observed with the mMD-2-F60L,V61L,E122K mutant. However, these activities and the concentration-inhibition effect of lipid IVa (Fig. 7D) in cells expressing the mMD-2-T57S,V61L,E122K mutant were comparable with those observed in hMD-2, indicating a critical role of these three amino acid residues (Ser57, Leu61, and Lys122) for expressing the antagonistic activity. MD-2 Structural Region Involved in Agonistic Activity of Lipid IVa—Mutation of Thr57, Val61, and Glu122 of mouse MD-2 into corresponding human MD-2 sequences caused not only the appearance of antagonistic activity of lipid IVa but also the disappearance of its agonistic activity, without losing the agonistic activity of compound 506 (Fig. 7C). Thus we next asked whether these three amino acid residues of mouse MD-2 were selectively involved in the agonistic activity of lipid IVa. To address this, we examined the agonistic activities of lipid IVa and compound 506 in cells expressing mMD-2-T57S,V61L,E122K together with mouse CD14 and TLR4 (Fig. 8). In these cells, compound 506 induced potent activation of NF-κB comparable with that observed in cells expressing wild-type mouse MD-2, whereas almost no agonistic activity was observed with lipid IVa at concentrations from 1 to 1,000 ng/ml. Although the mutation of glutamic acid to a lysine caused a charge reversal, mutations from threonine to serine and from valine to leucine may not cause significant changes. It is, therefore, still possible that compound 506 may require these amino acid residues for its agonistic activity, but these changes in amino acid residues may be tolerated. To address this, we mutated these three amino acid residues in mouse MD-2 into alanines either individually or in combinations and examined the agonistic activities of compound 506 and lipid IVa as well as the antagonistic activity of lipid IVa (Fig. 9). Although the agonistic activity of compound 506 with the E122A mutation was slightly enhanced, none of the mutations caused significant changes in the activity of compound 506. No significant changes in the agonistic and antagonistic activities of lipid IVa were observed with each point mutant or the T57S,V61A mutant, whereas the concurrent mutation of all three amino acid residues substantially decreased the agonistic activity, and the antagonistic activity was also evident (Fig. 9A). The concentration-response effects showed that the activity of compound 506 was decreased only slightly by the concurrent mutation of all three amino acid residues, whereas the activity of lipid IVa was substantially impaired (Fig. 9B). These results indicate that these three amino acid residues are selectively involved in the agonistic activity of lipid IVa and critical for determining its agonist-antagonist activity.FIGURE 9Replacement of Thr57, Val61, and Glu122 of mouse MD-2 with alanine loses the agonistic activity of lipid IVa without affecting lipid A activity. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with mouse CD14, mouse TLR4, and the indicated MD-2 expression plasmids together with an NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter plasmid. After 24 h, cells were either unstimulated (open columns) or stimulated for 6 h with 10 ng/ml compound 506 (506), 1 μg/ml lipid IVa (406), or 10 ng/ml compound 506 in the presence of 1 μg/ml lipid IVa (506 + 406) in A, or were either unstimulated (○, •) or stimulated for 6 h with the indicated concentrations of compound 506 (▵, ▴) or lipid IVa (□, ▪) in B, and luciferase activity was measured. The activity obtained with 10 ng/ml compound 506 in cells expressing mouse CD14, mouse TLR4, and mouse MD-2 was defined as 100%. Values are the means ± S.E. from three independent experiments. * p < 0.01 (compared with the respective response in the absence of lipid IVa by two-tailed Student’s t test). wt, wild-type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Role of Thr57, Val61, and Glu122 of MD-2 in TLR4 Signaling—The role of Thr57, Val61, and Glu122 of mouse MD-2 in TLR4 signaling was studied in HEK293 cells stably expressing mouse CD14, EIAV-tagged mouse TLR4, FLAG-tagged mouse TLR4, and either EIAV-tagged mouse MD-2 or EIAV-tagged mouse MD-2-T57A,V61A,E122A. These cells were stimulated with compound 506 or lipid IVa, and TLR4 oligomerization was examined (Fig. 10). For this, FLAG-tagged TLR4 was immunoprecipitated, and coprecipitation of EIAV-tagged TLR4 was detected by Western blotting. Coprecipitations of EIAV-tagged TLR4 were barely detectable without stimulations but were detectable after compound 506 stimulation in both stable transfectants. After lipid IVa stimulation, the coprecipitation was also detected in cells expressing wild-type MD-2 but was barely detectable in cells expressing mMD-2-T57A,V61A,E122A. Both the wild-type and mutant MD-2 were coprecipitated with TLR4 without ligand stimulation, and the amount coprecipitated was unaffected by stimulations. In parallel with TLR4 oligomerization, the inducible phosphorylation of IκBα was observed in response to compound 506 in both stable transfectants. The phosphorylation was also observed in response to lipid IVa in cells expressing wild-type MD-2 but was barely detectable in cells expressing mMD-2-T57A,V61A,E122A. These results support the above conclusion that Thr57, Val61, and Glu122 of mouse MD-2 are selectively involved in the agonistic activity of lipid IVa and critical for determining its agonist-antagonist activity. In the present study, we investigated the structural region of MD-2 required for agonistic and antagonistic activities of lipid IVa by utilizing its animal species-specific activity. The involvement of MD-2 in animal species-specific activity of lipid IVa has been demonstrated previously by expressing human and mouse MD-2 in human monocytic THP-1 cells (4Fujihara M. Muroi M. Tanamoto K. Suzuki T. Azuma H. Ikeda H. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 100: 171-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), mouse pro B Ba/F3 cells (15Akashi S. Nagai Y. Ogata H. Oikawa M. Fukase K. Kusumoto S. Kawasaki K. Nishijima M. Hayashi S. Kimoto M. Miyake K. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 1595-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), and HEK293 cells (17Hajjar A.M. Ernst R.K. Tsai J.H. Wilson C.B. Miller S.I. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 354-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). In the present study, we confirmed that the lipid IVa-induced activation of NF-κB in HEK293 cells expressing mouse CD14, TLR4, and MD-2 was substantially impaired when mouse MD-2 was replaced with human MD-2. The activity of compound 506, a typical lipid A molecule, was not significantly affected by the replacement, indicating that both human and mouse MD-2 are functional on mouse TLR4. Thus, in the present study, we created mouse/human chimeric MD-2 mutant plasmids and found that both the N3 (amino acids 57–79) and N5 (amino acids 108–135) regions of MD-2 were involved in the species-specific activity of lipid IVa. We further narrowed the region down and found that the concurrent replacement of Thr57, Val61, and Glu122 of mouse MD-2 with the corresponding human MD-2 amino acids substantially decreased the agonistic activity of lipid IVa without affecting the activity of compound 506. The replacement of each of these amino acid residues individually or as pairs was not enough to lose the activity, indicating that these three residues together contribute to the species-specific activity of lipid IVa. A tertiary structure model of human MD-2, reported by Gruber et al. (20Gruber A. Manèek M. Wagner H. Kirschning C.J. Jerala R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28475-28482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), shows that amino acid residues 57, 61, and 122 of MD-2 are sterically located in close proximity. Thus the domain created by these three amino acid residues may be involved in determining the agonist-antagonist activity of lipid IVa. The mutation of Thr57 to Ser, Val61 to Leu, and Glu122 to Lys of mouse MD-2 substantially decreased the agonistic activity of lipid IVa, whereas these replacements did not affect the activity of compound 506. Because the difference in amino acid structure between Thr and Ser or between Val and Leu is only one methyl or methylene moiety, there was still the possibility that these changes in amino acid residues may be tolerated even though compound 506 may require these amino acid residues for full agonistic activity. Thus we examined the activity of compound 506 in a mouse MD-2 mutant in which Thr57, Val61, and Glu122 were replaced with alanines, and we found that the activity was not affected by these substitutions, whereas the activity of lipid IVa was substantially impaired. It is therefore likely that these three amino acid residues are selectively involved in the agonistic activity of lipid IVa. The replacement of amino acid residues 57, 61, and 122 of mouse MD-2 with corresponding human MD-2 amino acids substantially decreased the agonistic activity of lipid IVa. However, replacement of amino acid residues 57, 61, and 122 of human MD-2 with the corresponding mouse MD-2 amino acid residues restored the agonistic activity of lipid IVa only to ∼50% of the activity observed in mouse MD-2 (data not shown). Replacement of the N3 region, and replacement of amino acid 122 in addition to the N3 region of human MD-2 with corresponding mouse MD-2 sequence restored the activity to ∼73% (Fig. 4B) and 90% (data not shown), respectively. Therefore, these three amino acid residues are necessary for the agonistic activity of lipid IVa, but additional amino acid residues in the N3 region may be required for its full agonistic activity. It has been reported, in studies using soluble MD-2 (6Gioannini T.L. Teghanemt A. Zhang D. Coussens N.P. Dockstader W. Ramaswamy S. Weiss J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Commun. 2002; 292: 880-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) that LPS directly binds to MD-2 in a highly basic region (amino acids 119–132). In our study, the mutation of Thr57, Val61, and Glu122 of mouse MD-2 to alanines (Fig. 9) or the mutation of Ser57, Leu61, and Lys122 of human MD-2 to corresponding mouse MD-2 amino acid residues (data not shown) did not affect the agonistic activity of compound 506, indicating that these three amino acid residues are not involved in lipid A binding. In addition, it is unlikely that these three amino acid residues are involved in lipid IVa binding because lipid IVa showed an antagonistic effect in cells expressing the mouse MD-2 mutant in which all three of these amino acid residues were replaced with the corresponding human MD-2 amino acid residues or with alanines.

Sci. 2004; 29: 294-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) have proposed that MD-2 plays an important role in regulating TLR4 dimerization upon LPS binding. Because the ability of MD-2 to associate with TLR4 and compound 506-induced TLR4 dimerization as well as inducible phosphorylation of IκBα were not affected by the mutation of Thr57, Val61, and Glu122 of mouse MD-2 (Fig. 10), these amino acid residues are unlikely to be involved in interactions with TLR4 or in TLR4 dimerization. These amino acid residues may participate in the discrimination of lipid A structure. We thank Keisuke Nakada and Takamasa Hiratsuka for technical assistance."

The cyst wall material is accumulated in encystation-specific vesicles (ESVs), specialized Golgi-like compartments generated de novo, after export from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and before secretion. These large post-ER vesicles neither have the morphological characteristics of Golgi cisternae nor sorting functions, but may represent an evolutionary early form of the Golgi-like maturation compartment. Because little is known about the genesis and maturation of ESVs, we used a limited proteomics approach to discover novel proteins that are specific for developing ESVs or associated peripherally with these organelles. Unexpectedly, we identified cytoplasmic and luminal factors of the ER quality control system on two-dimensional electrophoresis gels, i.e. several proteasome subunits and HSP70-BiP. We show that BiP is exported to ESVs and retrieved via its C-terminal KDEL signal from ESVs. In contrast, cytoplasmic proteasome complexes undergo a developmentally regulated re-localization to ESVs during encystation. This suggests that maturation of bulk exported cyst wall material in the Golgi-like ESVs involves both continuous activity of ER-associated quality control mechanisms and retrograde Golgi to ER transport.

Giardia lamblia (syn. Giardia intestinalis, Giardia duodenalis) is a unicellular intestinal parasite and a leading cause of diarrheal disease in humans and animals worldwide (1Adam R.D. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 447-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). In addition to this public health importance, the diplomonad Giardia belongs to one of the earliest known branches of the eukaryotic lineage (2Roger A.J. Morrison H.G. Sogin M.L. J. Mol.

Science. 1989; 243: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). As an increasingly popular model organism for cell biology, this protozoan is currently one of the best opportunities for discovering cellular mechanisms and structures that represent potentially ancient eukaryotic features (4Marti M.

Synthesis and secretion of a protective cell wall are essential for transmission of infectious stages of Giardia and many other uni- or multicellular pathogens. Oocysts or (tissue) cysts acquire the necessary environmental resistance to survive their release into the environment and/or subsequent stomach passage when ingested by a new host. Eimeria oocysts develop a multilayered oocyst wall by sequential exocytosis of at least three different extracellular matrices (6Ferguson D.J. Belli S.I. Smith N.C. Wallach M.G. Int. J. Parasitol. 2003; 33: 1329-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These infectious stages may survive for many months outside of a host. Encysting Entamoeba trophozoites produce a fibrillar extracellular matrix composed of proteins and chitin (7Frisardi M. Ghosh S.K. Field J. Van Dellen K. Rogers R. Robbins P. Samuelson J. Infect.

In all cases, however, complex, but poorly understood signal-dependent secretory processes are involved. Notably the nature of membrane compartments responsible for the accumulation/maturation of matrix material, e.g. wall forming bodies of Eimeria species or encystation-specific vesicles (ESVs) 2The abbreviations used are: ESV, encystation-specific vesicle; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CWP, cyst wall protein; DTT, dithiothreitol; HA, Haemophilus agglutinin; ORF, open reading frame; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; GGD, Giardia Genome Database; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; CLSM, confocal laser scanning microscopy; COPI, coat protein complex I.2The abbreviations used are: ESV, encystation-specific vesicle; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; CWP, cyst wall protein; DTT, dithiothreitol; HA, Haemophilus agglutinin; ORF, open reading frame; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; GGD, Giardia Genome Database; DAPI, 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; CLSM, confocal laser scanning microscopy; COPI, coat protein complex I. of Giardia and Entamoeba, is largely unknown. Giardia is a unique model for cyst formation because (i) it is an evolutionarily basic eukaryote with a very simple secretory system that lacks a conventional Golgi apparatus (4Marti M. Regos A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 24837-24848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), (ii) ESVs have been characterized as Golgi-like compartments (10Lanfredi-Rangel A. Attias M.

Cell. 2000; 11: 1789-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), (iii) de novo ESV formation is easily induced in vitro (13Gillin F.D. Boucher S.E. Rossi S.S. Reiner D.S. Exp. Parasitol. 1989; 69: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and (iv) there is a potential for targeted intervention to block encystation and thus prevent transmission to another host. Giardia possesses a structurally conserved but uniquely basic apparatus for vesicular transport (4Marti M. Regos A. Li Y. Schraner E.M. Wild P. Muller N. Knopf L.G. Hehl A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24837-24848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Despite its simplicity and without recognizable Golgi dictyosomes, Giardia can sort proteins to constitutive or regulated export pathways, and maintains few but distinct membrane compartments. After induction of encystation, large amounts of cyst wall proteins (CWPs) and glycans are produced. The bulk of newly synthesized cyst wall material is exported from the ER to nascent ESVs as a pulse during the first 5-8 h after induction, and accumulate in a set of approximately spherical ESVs with defined cargo (14Hehl A.B. Marti M. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15Marti M. Hehl A.B. Trends Parasitol. 2003; 19: 440-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 16Lujan H.D. Touz M.C. Cell. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism of this export is still elusive, however. The available data support two nonmutually exclusive models for ESV genesis: (i) lateral segregation and concentration of cyst wall material in specialized ER subcompartments (10Lanfredi-Rangel A. Attias M. Reiner D.S. Gillin F.D. De Souza W. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 143: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and/or (ii) export of cyst wall material in COPII-coated transport vesicles that give rise to ESVs by homotypic fusion (17Marti M. Li Y. Schraner E.M. Wild P. Kohler P. Hehl A.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1433-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In any case, analogous to the generation of vesicular tubular clusters and cis-Golgi compartments, formation of ESVs seems to require the small GTPase Sar1p 3S. Stefanic and A. B. Hehl, unpublished data.3S. Stefanic and A. B. Hehl, unpublished data. and thus represents a unique form of Golgi neogenesis. Maturation of ESVs is less controversial: during the 15-24-h process until cyst wall secretion, peripheral membrane proteins are sequentially recruited to ESVs (4Marti M. Regos A. Li Y. Schraner E.M. Wild P. Muller N. Knopf L.G. Hehl A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24837-24848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This indicates that the compartments themselves and presumably also their cargo undergo a maturation process during which CWPs are post-translationally modified. Evidence for cargo modification was inferred from the presence of protein-disulfide isomerases in ESVs (18Davids B.J. Mehta K. Fesus L. McCaffery J.M. Gillin F.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 136: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), cleavage of the CWP2 C terminus by an encystation-specific proteases in vitro (19Touz M.C. Nores M.J. Slavin I. Carmona C. Conrad J.T. Mowatt M.R. Nash T.E. Coronel C.E. Lujan H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8474-8481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), or phosphorylation of newly synthesized CWPs (20Slavin I. Saura A. Carranza P.G. Touz M.C. Nores M.J. Lujan H.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 122: 95-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In particular, the formation and reshuffling of intra- and intermolecular disulfide bonds is essential for establishing a cyst wall, because treatment with dithiothreitol (DTT) reversibly abolished cyst wall formation and appeared to dissolve ESVs (21Reiner D.S. McCaffery J.M. Gillin F.D. Cell. Microbiol. 2001; 3: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Interestingly, like conventional Golgi cisternae, ESVs are sensitive to brefeldin A and associate with two Golgi markers, β′COPI and GiYip1 (4Marti M. Regos A. Li Y. Schraner E.M. Wild P. Muller N. Knopf L.G. Hehl A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24837-24848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 17Marti M. Li Y. Schraner E.M. Wild P. Kohler P. Hehl A.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1433-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This is strong evidence for their Golgi-like nature despite the unusual morphology. Previously we have used an in silico strategy to identify proteins associated with ESVs that was based on the available sequence data from the Giardia Genome Database (GGD) (4Marti M. Regos A. Li Y. Schraner E.M. Wild P. Muller N. Knopf L.G. Hehl A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24837-24848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 5McArthur A.G. Morrison H.G. Nixon J.E. Passamaneck N.Q. Kim U. Hinkle G. Crocker M.K. Holder M.E. Farr R. Reich C.I. Olsen G.E. Aley S.B. Adam R.D. Gillin F.D. Sogin M.L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 189: 271-273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We proceeded on the assumption that ESVs were unusual Golgi compartments and searched for homologues of proteins associated with this organelle. However, in addition to being biased, a major limitation of this strategy was the high sequence degeneracy and the fact that some key factors for ESV genesis and maturation of ESVs might be Giardia-specific. Here, we used an organelle-specific proteomics approach to discover unknown ESV-associated proteins. We have developed protocols for the production of fractions enriched in ESV-derived microsomes containing CWP cargo and peripheral Golgi marker proteins. In a first step we have analyzed this fraction with two-dimensional electrophoresis and identified novel proteins. Despite the difficulty to resolve proteins in this fraction, we could identify components of the ER quality control system and localized those to ESVs. These results have important implications for transport and maturation of cyst wall material, as well as the nature of ESVs as de novo-generated Golgi-like maturation compartments in Giardia. Using a membrane-permeable thiol-reducing agent during ESV maturation, we also obtained first evidence that the spherical morphology of ESVs is actively maintained and directly dependent on disulfide bonds in cargo proteins. Giardia Culture, Transfection, and Analysis of Transgenic Cells—G. lamblia strain WBC6 (ATCC catalog number 50803) trophozoites were grown in TYI-S-33 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and bovine bile. Two-step encystation was induced as described previously (12Hehl A.B. Marti M. Kohler P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1789-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) by increasing the medium pH and by addition of porcine bile after culture for ∼44 h in medium without bile (13Gillin F.D. Boucher S.E. Rossi S.S. Reiner D.S. Exp. Parasitol. 1989; 69: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To reduce intra- and intermolecular disulfide bonds in CWPs, DTT was added to a final concentration of 7.15 mm to encysting cells 8 h post-induction for 10-30 min. Cells were harvested and fixed directly for analysis, or the drug was washed out by replacing the growth medium and incubation was continued for 30 min before fixation. Proteasome inhibitors were added 90 min post-induction. Cells were incubated for 6, 14, and 24 h in the presence of the drugs, and processed for analysis by immunofluorescence assay to determine ESV formation, proteasome recruitment, or cyst formation (24 h). Final concentrations in the cell culture were: Pefabloc® SC (Fluka), 40 and 80 μm; MG132 (Sigma), 20 and 60 μm; and Epoxomycin (Sigma), 3 and 8 nm. All inhibitors with the exception of Pefablock, which is water soluble, were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Controls received solvent only. Nucleic Acid Techniques and Expression Vector Construction—Using vectors for Giardia transfection all constructs were based on the expression cassette C1-CWP (12Hehl A.B. Marti M. Kohler P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1789-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) for expression under the control of an inducible CWP1 promoter. A short fragment coding for a single Haemophilus agglutinin (HA) epitope tag was ligated in the form of annealed complementary oligonucleotides with NsiI compatible overhangs into the NsiI site downstream of the CWP signal sequence processing site. This reaction mutated the distal NsiI sequence leaving the one adjacent to the open reading frames (ORF) of interest intact. The ORF from giardial Hsp70-BiP were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA, cut, and ligated into NsiI and PacI sites. PCR oligonucleotide primers (5′-3′ orientation) used in this study were: GiBip-s, GGATGCATATAGACCTCGGCACGACCTACTC; GiBip-as, CGTTAATTAATTAGAGTTCATCTTTTTCTGCATAG; and GiBipMut-as, CGTTAATTAATTAGAGGTCATCATTTTCTGCATAG. The KDEL to NDDL mutations on recombinant BiP were encoded on the antisense primer used for amplifying the ORF. Plasmid vector DNA was electroporated into trophozoites, and stable transgenic cells were selected using the antibiotic G418 (Sigma), as described previously (12Hehl A.B. Marti M. Kohler P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1789-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Plasmids were maintained episomally or targeted to the TPI locus and integrated by homologous recombination. Cell Disruption and Sucrose Density Gradient Centrifugation—Cell fractionation and analysis of marker protein distribution in encysting Giardia trophozoites at 8 h post-induction were carried out as described previously (4Marti M. Regos A. Li Y. Schraner E.M. Wild P. Muller N. Knopf L.G. Hehl A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24837-24848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested as described above, counted, and resuspended at 1.25 × 108/ml in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), containing a 2× protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 2 μm E-64, 2 μm leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells in suspension were disrupted by gentle sonication (∼5 cycles of 20 s, each) on a fixed stand (Branson Sonifier, Danbury, CT). Cells were examined microscopically after each cycle and sonicated until the parasites appeared completely disintegrated. Sucrose was added to a final concentration of 250 mm, mixed gently, and the suspension was centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000 × g. The supernatant was loaded onto a discontinuous 20-60% sucrose gradient in 12-ml polyallomer tubes (number 331374, Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C, the gradient was eluted from the bottom into 18 fractions of 650 μl and kept on ice. Protein content in each fraction was measured with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Proteins in the collected fractions were precipitated by addition of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10% and centrifuged. Pellets were washed three times with acetone, air dried, and re-dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer including 7.75 mg/ml dithiothreitol and boiled for 5 min. After separation on SDS-PAGE gels (10%) marker proteins for ESV microsomes were detected by incubating Western blots with specific antisera diluted in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, and 5% nonfat milk powder at 20 °C for 2 h, followed by incubation with a peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody (Sigma). Bound secondary antibodies were visualized using Western Lightning® (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Microsomes for mass spectrometry and two-dimensional electrophoresis analysis were prepared as follows. Instead of trichloroacetic acid precipitation, sucrose concentrations of selected fractions and fraction pools were lowered by 50% by stepwise addition of cold 10% sucrose solution with gentle mixing on ice. The diluted microsome suspension was transferred to a 12-ml polyallomer tube and topped off with 10% sucrose solution. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C, the supernatant was poured off and all excess liquid was removed. The pellet was resuspended in ice-cold 50 mm ammonium acetate, transferred immediately to an Eppendorf tube, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen pellet was lyophilized and stored at -20 °C until further use. Two-dimensional Electrophoresis and Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Microsome Fractions and Protein Identification—The ESV fraction was prepared for two-dimensional analysis according to the PS-1 protocol and the two-dimensional electrophoresis, gel staining, and MALDI analysis were performed as described in Ref. 22Pal A.

MALDI analysis was performed on a Bruker Reflex III using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix. Peptide maps were searched against simulated tryptic digests of the open reading frames from the G. lamblia genome in NCBI using the Mascot search engine at Matrix Science. The peptide mass tolerance was set to 0.15 dalton and no miscleavages were allowed. All identified proteins showed significant hits (p < 0.05) in the Mascot program. Antibody Production—The open reading frames of a α proteasome subunit (GGD ORF 15099) and GiCim5 (GGD ORF 86683) were inserted downstream of the maltose-binding protein (MBP) in plasmid vector pMal-2Cx (New England Biolabs). The fusion proteins were produced in transgenic Escherichia coli by adding isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 0.5 mm for 2 h at 37 °C.Maltose-binding protein fusions were isolated from bacterial lysates by affinity purification on amylose resin according to the manufacturers protocols (New England Biolabs), dialyzed, and lyophilized (4Marti M.

NMRI mice were immunized intraperitoneally with 100 μg of fusion protein emulsified with RIBI adjuvant (Corixa, Hamilton, MT) on days 0, 15, 30, and 50. Blood from the tail vein was collected prior to the initial immunization and after the second and third boosts. The serum fraction was assayed for the presence of specific antibodies by Western blot using separated total Giardia trophozoite lysate and by immunofluorescence assay. Cell Preparation and Microscopy—Cells were harvested by cooling and centrifugation at 900 × g for 10 min, or by adherence to cover glasses. Fixation and preparation for fluorescence microscopy was done as described previously (17Marti M. Li Y. Schraner E.M. Wild P. Kohler P. Hehl A.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1433-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with cold PBS and fixed with 3% formaldehyde in PBS for 40 min at 20 °C, followed by a 5-min incubation with 0.1 m glycine in PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min at 20 °C and blocked for >2 h in 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Incubations with titrated polyclonal antibodies raised against a giardial α proteasome subunit or GiCim5, or with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody were done in 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. Washes between incubations were done with 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS. Labeled cells were embedded with Vectashield (Vector Labs) containing the DNA intercalating agent DAPI for detection of nuclear DNA. Immunofluorescence analysis was performed on a Leica SP2 AOBS confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) using the appropriate settings. Image stacks of optical sections were further processed using the Huygens deconvolution software package version 2.7 (Scientific Volume Imaging, Hilversum, NL). Three-dimensional reconstruction and surface rendering was done with the Imaris software suite (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland) using the surpass functions. Enrichment of ESV-derived Microsomes by Subcellular Fractionation—For the production of fractions enriched in microsomes containing CWP and Golgi marker proteins (ESV-derived microsomes) from cells at 8-h post-induction we used previously developed protocols for cell disruption and sucrose density centrifugation. Microsomes from 109 encysting cells were loaded onto two 12-ml 20-60% sucrose gradients, centrifuged, and eluted into 18 equal fractions from the bottom. The Western analysis and densitometry (top panel) in Fig. 1A show a bimodal distribution of the CWP2 marker in dense fractions 1-3 as well as in lighter fractions 10-12 when analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 1A, boxed, solid line). The fractions 11/12 were designated the ESV/Golgi-enriched microsome pool (Fig. 1A,I) based on co-migration with the major peaks of two previously identified Golgi marker proteins, the coatomer (COPI) component Giβ′COP and the multispanning membrane protein GiYip1 (Fig. 1B) (4Marti M.

Cytoplasmic proteins did not run into the gradient and accumulated in fractions 15-18 (data not shown). For comparison we also collected medium density microsomes (pooled fractions 5 and 6) with undetermined organellar origin (Fig. 1A, boxed, broken line). The association of β′COP and GiYip1 with developing ESVs was demonstrated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) (Fig. 1). Individual optical sections show extensive co-localization of the marker proteins with CWP in most ESVs, as do the three-dimensional (3D) reconstructed image stacks. A ESV/Golgi fraction (pooled fractions 11/12) was prepared for further analysis. To increase resolution and to minimize cross-contamination, microsomes from only 5 × 108 cells were loaded onto the gradient. The resulting preparations were again tested with SDS-PAGE and Western blot (Fig. 2). The ESV/Golgi fraction (Fig. 2, left panel) showed a distinct protein pattern, i.e. >70 distinguishable bands with a relative mass between 12 and 200 kDa. Western analysis of identical samples run on the same gel revealed exclusive distribution of CWP2 and GiYip1 in fractions 11/12, demonstrating the presence of these markers and providing a qualitative measure of the separation. To gauge the extent of cross-contamination of fractions 11/12 with marker proteins from other compartments, the gradient was analyzed using specific antibodies or verified reporter proteins (4Marti M.

Separation and Identification of Proteins in the ESV Fraction—The ESV/Golgi fraction was prepared for two-dimensional electrophoresis as described under “Materials and Methods.” Because of the extreme pI values of some proteins and presumably also the high sugar (β1-3 Gal-NAc homopolymers) content (25Gerwig G.J. van Kuik J.A.

Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) in the preparation, the quality of the separation was comparatively low. For example, none of the CWPs could be resolved, even though they were readily detected in conventional SDS-PAGE and Western analysis (Fig. 2). Approximately 30 spots were identified in Coomassie-stained two-dimensional gels (Fig. 3) and 20 were chosen for excision and analysis by mass spectrometry. Identified proteins are listed in Table 1. As expected there is a considerable bias, which is demonstrated by the absence of bona fide markers such as CWPs, or low abundance proteins like COPI subunits and Yip1 that were identified in Western blot analysis (Fig. 2). On the other hand, there are three hits for HSP70-BiP, a lumenal ER resident chaperone of Giardia (26Gupta R.S. Aitken K. Falah M. Singh B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We evaluated the role of transcription factor NF-κB in the regulation of anoikis susceptibility of intestinal epithelial cells. Culture of rat intestinal epithelial cells in suspension induced NF-κB activation, which blocked the anoikis of those cells, as assessed by internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 cleavage. Activation of NF-κB after the loss of extracellular attachments required focal adhesion kinase tyrosine 397 phosphorylation. This triggered a signaling cascade through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and AKT, to induce DNA binding of the RelA/p65 NF-κB polypeptide. NF-κB activated in this manner induced the up-regulated expression of a distinct program of genes that included osteoprotegerin, BCL-2, and IAP-1 (inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1). Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that NF-κB directly regulated the promoters of these 3 genes. Knock-down of the expression of osteoprotegerin, BCL-2, or inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1 by RNA interference showed that these factors inhibit anoikis, and genetic reconstitution of their expression alone or in combination restored normal levels of anoikis to NF-κB-inactive intestinal epithelial cells. Together, these findings have identified the molecular components of a previously unrecognized antianoikis pathway in intestinal epithelial cells.

Contact with extracellular matrix provides survival signals to epithelial cells. When epithelial cells lose such contacts, a form of apoptosis results, which has been termed anoikis (1Frisch S.M. Francis H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar). Physiologically, anoikis is important in the regulation of cell number in the intestinal tract, where epithelial cells are shed from villus tips in the small intestine and from the intercrypt epithelium of the colon and die by anoikis (2Hall P.A. Coates P.J. Ansari B. Hopwood D. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3569-3577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Grossmann J. Maxson J.M. Whitacre C.M. Orosz D.E. Berger N.A. Fiocchi C. Levine A.D. Am. J.

Pathophysiologically, resistance to anoikis has been associated with metastatic spread of carcinoma cells (4Yawata A. Adachi M. Okuda H. Naishiro Y. Takamura T. Hareyama M. Takayama S. Reed J.C.

The molecular mechanisms that govern susceptibility to anoikis have not been fully characterized and could provide important insights into epithelial homeostasis and carcinogenesis. It was previously established that the survival of cells cultured without extracellular attachments is promoted by PI 3-K 2The abbreviations used are: PI 3-K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; IKK, inhibitor of κB kinase; IκB, inhibitor of κB; OPG, osteoprotegerin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; RIE-1, rat intestinal epithelial; poly-HEMA, polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TRAIL, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; RT, reverse transcription; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. and AKT because inhibition of these kinases increased anoikis (6Loza-Coll M.A. Perera S.

Moreover, the anchorage-independent survival of cancer cells that is induced by transforming oncogenes such as Ras and Src depends in part on PI 3-K and AKT (8Coll M.L. Rosen K. Ladeda V. Filmus J.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2783-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms by which cells activate PI 3-K and AKT after loss of extracellular attachments and through which this pathway blocks anoikis have not been completely characterized; nor have the molecular factors that ultimately control the susceptibility of cells to undergo anoikis been identified. NF-κB constitutes a family of transcription factors defined by the presence of a Rel homology domain. When exposed to certain stresses, such as inflammation, infection, oxidative stress, or DNA double strand breaks, NF-κB dissociates from inhibitory IκB molecules, translocates from cytoplasm to nucleus, and binds to κB sequences in the promoter regions of specific target genes, up-regulating their expression (11Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). Prominent among the more than 150 genes known to be regulated by NF-κB proteins are a subset whose products inhibit apoptosis, including BCL-XL, BCL-2, IAP-1 and -2, c-FLICE inhibitory protein, growth arrest and DNA damage associated protein 45β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated proteins 1 and 2 (12Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2470) Google Scholar). NF-κB activation is strongly associated with resistance to apoptosis induced by TNF-α (13Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar), ionizing radiation (14Egan L. Eckmann L. Greten F.R. Chae S. Li Z.-W. Myhre G.M. Robine S. Karin M. Kagnoff M.F. Proc. Natl.

Because of the importance of NF-κBin apoptosis resistance and carcinogenesis, we suspected that this factor might regulate anoikis. To address this possibility, we evaluated a functional role for NF-κB in the regulation of anoikis susceptibility, using a suspension culture model of intestinal epithelial cells. We found that following the loss of extracellular attachments in intestinal epithelial cells, FAK triggers a prosurvival signaling pathway through PI 3-K and AKT that activates NF-κB. Moreover, our results have identified a distinct program of genes up-regulated by NF-κB that inhibit anoikis, revealing this transcription factor to be a central regulator of intestinal epithelial cell survival following the loss of extracellular attachments. Reagents—Unless otherwise stated, reagents were obtained from Sigma. Wortmannin, LY294002, bisindolylmaleimide I, and MG132 were obtained from Calbiochem. In all experiments utilizing chemical inhibitors, control conditions contained an equal volume of vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide or saline). Cell Lines—Rat intestinal epithelial (RIE-1) cells (21Blay J. Brown K.D. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1984; 8: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), containing 2 mm l-glutamine and 5% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2. REV cells were prepared by transfecting RIE-1 cells with the empty vector (pRCβ-actin), and RSR cells were prepared by transfecting RIE cells with an expression vector for the NF-κB superrepressor (pRCβ-actin IκBαAA), as previously described (22Egan L.J. De Lecea A. Lehrman E.D. Myhre G.M. Eckmann L. Kagnoff M.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 25: C25Google Scholar). RSR and REV cells were maintained in the same medium as RIE-1 cells supplemented with 0.4 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). For cell proliferation experiments, cells were seeded into 12-well plates in triplicate, and after varying durations of culture, cells were trypsinized and counted using a hemocytometer. Suspension Culture—Cells were grown to confluence in 100-mm or 6-well tissue culture dishes. For culture in suspension, cells were detached from tissue culture plates using 0.25% trypsin, 0.38 g/liter EDTA, or 10 mm EDTA in calcium and magnesium-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen). Preliminary experiments revealed comparable results with these two detachment techniques but faster detachment using the trypsin/EDTA combination, so all subsequent experiments utilized this combination. Once detached, cells were cultured in complete medium in 30-mm Petri dishes that had been coated with polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate (poly-HEMA). Poly-HEMA-coated dishes were prepared by two applications of a 10 mg/ml solution of poly-HEMA in 95% ethanol onto Petri dishes. After drying, the dishes were washed three times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline before use. Cells were incubated in standard medium as described above during suspension culture. After various durations of suspension culture on poly-HEMA-coated dishes, cells were collected and reseeded onto tissue culture plates or immediately processed for analysis as described below. Cell Lysates—Cells were collected, washed with ice-cold PBS, and incubated in ice-cold whole cell lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol), including phosphatase inhibitors (40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.9 mm sodium fluoride) and protease inhibitors (protease inhibitor mixture III, 5 μl/ml; Calbiochem) for 15 min at 4 °C. Samples were then centrifuged at 10,000 r.p.m. for 15 min at 4 °C, and supernatant was saved for use in Western blotting, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Protein concentration in the lysates were determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) Incorporation—BrdUrd (10 μm) was added to culture medium for 2 h. Cells were then fixed in methanol, treated with 2 n HCl for 15 min followed by 0.1 m borax for 10 min. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and incubated in 1:60 diluted biotin-conjugated mouse anti-BrdUrd (Caltag/Invitrogen), followed by CY3-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). Cells were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 and visualized using a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope fitted with appropriate filters. Digital photographs of random fields were taken using filters for both Hoechst and CY3, and BrdUrd incorporation was expressed as the percentage of total cells staining CY3-positive. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—This was carried out as previously described (23Egan L.J. Mays D.C. Huntoon C.J. Bell M.P. Pike M.G. Sandborn W.J. Lipsky J.J. McKean D.J. J. Biol.

Supershift antibodies used were sc-372X (RelA/p65), sc-114X (p50), sc-70X (c-Rel), and sc-226 (RelB), all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and 05-361 (p50) from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Trans-Am Assay for NF-κB Activation—This method utilizes a 96-well plate format to quantify active NF-κB RelA/p65 in cell extracts and was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). Briefly, 5 μg of cellular extract was placed into wells of the 96-well plate, in which there is plate-bound oligonucleotide containing the NF-κB consensus site to which only activated (IκB-free) NF-κB can bind. NF-κB RelA/p65 bound to the immobilized oligonucleotide is detected using an anti-RelA/p65 antibody with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary and colorimetric detection at 450 nm (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). Survival Experiments—Cells were trypsinized and counted using a hemocytometer, and 5 × 105 viable (exclusion of trypan blue) cells were resuspended in culture medium and transferred to poly-HEMA-coated dishes. After various durations of culture in suspension, cells were replated onto 6-well tissue culture plates and incubated overnight. The next day, cells were trypsinized and counted again to evaluate survival. The percentage of survival after each duration of suspension culture was determined by dividing the cell number surviving at that time point by the number surviving with immediate replating. Cell Death Detection ELISA—This assay detects internucleosomal fragmented DNA, a feature of apoptotic cells, and is based on a quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay principle using mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against DNA and histones (24Leist M. Gantner F. Bohlinger I. Germann P.G. Tiegs G. Wendel A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1778-1788PubMed Google Scholar). For each condition, 105 cells were used, and the assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, cells were grown in 6-well plates. After treatment or various time points of culture in suspension, cells were collected and lysed, and samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Samples were transferred to anti-histone biotin-coated 96-well plates and incubated for 90 min. After three washes, anti-DNA peroxidase antibodies were added to each well and incubated for 90 min. After three washes, the peroxidase substrate was added to each well, and absorbance at 405 nm was read using a 96-well plate reader. Results were expressed as DNA fragmentation relative to attached or untreated cells. Immunoblotting—Samples containing 30 μg of total protein were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and then were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), after which membranes were blocked with a 5% (w/v) solution of nonfat milk powder in Tris-buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were probed with antibodies specific for phosphoserine 32 IκBα, IκBα, AKT, phosphoserine 473 AKT, active caspase-3, IAP-1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) FAK, phosphotyrosine 397 FAK (Upstate Biotechnology), BCL-2 (eBioscience, San Diego, CA), OPG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), or β-actin (Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, CA). Detection was performed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody or sheep anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Biosciences), followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences) and exposure to x-ray film (Biomax; Eastman Kodak Co.)

Transfections were performed by square wave electroporation, using a single pulse, 325 V, 10 ms (BTX, Holliston, MA). A total of 30 μg of plasmid DNA and 107 cells for each condition were used, as previously described (23Egan L.J. Mays D.C. Huntoon C.J. Bell M.P. Pike M.G. Sandborn W.J. Lipsky J.J. McKean D.J. J.

Preliminary experiments using a green fluorescence protein expression plasmid indicated that ∼60-90% of cells were transfected under these conditions. Expression Profiling Array—Total cellular RNA was isolated from monolayered REV and RSR cells and after 4 h of detachment using Qiagen RNEasy kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). The apoptosis GEArray Q series array was obtained from SuperArray Bioscience Corp. (Frederick, MD). Briefly, total RNA from the experimental samples was used as a template to generate cDNA probes using the GEAprimer mix as a reverse transcriptase primer. The cDNA probes, which represent abundance of mRNA population, were then denatured, and hybridization was conducted in GEHybridization solution to two nylon membranes spotted with gene-specific cDNA fragments. Membranes were then washed in 2× SSC, 1% SDS twice for 20 min each followed by 0.1× SSC, 0.5% SDS twice for 20 min each. Detection was performed using by CDP-star chemiluminescent solution and exposure to x-ray film. RT-PCR Analysis—RNA was prepared from REV and RSR cells using Qiagen RNEasy kit (Qiagen Inc.). cDNA was prepared from the RNA using Superscript II (Invitrogen). PCR was carried out using the following conditions: 25 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 60 s, annealing at 56 °C for 60 s, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min (primer sequences available on request). One-tenth of the PCR product was analyzed by separation on a 2% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—Cells were cross-linked with formaldehyde for 20 min at 25 °C, harvested in SDS-lysis buffer (Upstate Biotechnology), and sheared to fragment DNA to ∼500 bp. Samples were then immunoprecipitated using RelA/p65 antibody (sc-372; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or agarose beads alone at 4 °C overnight. Following immunoprecipitation, samples were washed and eluted using the Chromatin Immunoprecipitation system (Upstate Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cross-links were removed at 65 °C for 4 h and immunoprecipitated DNA was purified using phenol/chloroform extraction (500 μl) and ethanol precipitation. PCR was utilized to detect RelA/p65 interaction with OPG, BCL-2, and IAP-1 promoters (primer sequences available on request). RNA Interference—The 19-nucleotide small interfering RNA (siRNA) for BCL-2, OPG, and IAP-1 were designed by using Genebee software to predict probable RNA secondary structures, assesses target accessibility, and define RNA-targeting nucleic acids. Multiple sets of sequences were tested for their ability to selectively target BCL-2, OPG, or IAP-1, and the following sets were chosen: BCL-2, GAACTGGGGGAGGATTGTGTT and CACAATCCTCCCCCAGTTCTT; OPG, GCTTATAGTTAGGAATGTT and CATTCCTAACTATAAGCATT; IAP-1, CGGCCTGGATGACATGAGATT and TCTCATGTCATCCAGGCCGTT. Control siRNA was a scrambled sequence without any specific target that did not affect base-line or inducible levels of expression of BCL-2, OPG, IAP-1, or β-actin: CCGTCCTGCTCCAGCTAGATT and TCTAGCTGGAGCAGGACGGTT. Oligonucleotides were annealed with the complementary strand with dTdT overhangs. For the transfection, siRNA or control siRNA solution was added to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) and allowed to incubate for 20 min at room temperature to create the transfection mixture. Transfection was done as per the manufacturer's guidelines for 4 h. After 4 h, medium was supplemented with RPMI 1640 and fetal bovine serum (to a final concentration of 10%). RNA was harvested after 72 h. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were performed using Student's t test or analysis of variance with post hoc Tukey tests, as appropriate. p values of <0.05 were accepted as statistically significant. NF-κB Activation Promotes the Survival of RIE-1 Cells Cultured in Suspension—Initially, we evaluated the role of NF-κB in regulating anoikis, using a model system in which rat intestinal epithelial cells were detached from plastic tissue culture surfaces and cultured in suspension. Experiments were preformed with parental RIE-1 cells or with RIE-1-derived clones that we previously engineered to stably express the NF-κB superrepressor, a mutant nondegradable form of IκBα in which serines 32 and 36 are replaced with alanines (RSR cells) or a control empty vector (REV cells) (30Egan L.J. de Lecea A. Lehrman E.D. Myhre G.M. Eckmann L. Kagnoff M.F. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 285: C1028-C1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). RSR cells cannot activate NF-κB in response to typical stimuli, such as interleukin-1 or TNF-α. We cultured two clones of RSR and two clones of REV cells in suspension on poly-HEMA-coated dishes for 1-6 h before reseeding on standard tissue culture plates. The next day, surviving cells that adhered to the tissue culture plates were counted and compared with the number of starting cells to determine percentage of survival. Across all of the time points of this experiment, control REV clones survived in greater numbers than did NF-κB-inactive RSR clones (Fig. 1A), differences that were statistically significant after 2 h. After 6 h of suspension culture, ∼60% of control REV cells survived, compared with 30% RSR cells. To exclude the possibility that the differences in cell numbers between REV and RSR clones might be due to differences in rates of proliferation between the control and NF-κB-inactive cells, we assessed rates of growth and DNA synthesis. Parental RIE-1 cells, control REV-3 cells, and NF-κB-inactive RSR-6 cells grew at comparable rates (Fig. 1B). REV-3 and RSR-6 cells also had very similar BrdUrd uptake rates (Fig. 1C). Together these findings excluded the possibility that the greater numbers of surviving suspension-cultured REV cells compared with RSR cells was due to a proliferation advantage. Rather, the approximate 2-fold reduction in survival conferred by an inability to activate NF-κB suggested that NF-κB prevented apoptotic death of these cells. To test this idea, we quantified internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, a marker of apoptosis, in REV and RSR cells cultured both attached to tissue culture plates and in suspension. We observed a progressive induction of DNA fragmentation in both REV and RSR cells by suspension culture of 2 or 4 h (Fig. 1D). Notably, the amount of DNA fragmentation induced by suspension culture was ∼3 times greater in RSR than in REV cells after 4 h. To support the results of DNA fragmentation analysis, we evaluated the activation of the death effector caspase-3 using Western blotting for cleaved caspase-3, a marker of its activation. Both REV and RSR cells cleaved caspase-3 when cultured in suspension but to a greater degree in the NF-κB-defective RSR cells (Fig. 1E). These findings indicate that NF-κB provides an antiapoptotic signal to intestinal epithelial cells that supports the survival of those cells when cultured without extracellular attachments. The prosurvival role of NF-κB in suspension-cultured intestinal epithelial cells suggested that the loss of extracellular attachment activated this transcription factor. To test this possibility, we prepared whole cell protein lysates of attached and suspension-cultured RIE-1 cells and analyzed NF-κB activity. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that RIE-1 cells cultured in suspension activated NF-κB DNA binding 1 h after detachment, whereas the DNA binding activity of the unrelated transcription factor NF-Y was not affected (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained when RIE-1 cells were detached from tissue culture plates by incubation with trypsin (left) or with EDTA (right), indicating that NF-κB activation occurs independent of the method used to disrupt extracellular attachment of cells. Using antibodies against the five known mammalian NF-κB polypeptides, supershift analysis revealed that the detachment-induced NF-κB DNA binding complex contained RelA/p65 and p50 but not RelB, c-Rel, or p100/p52 (results not shown). We used a quantitative ELISA-based assay specific for the RelA/p65 NF-κB polypeptide and found a time-dependent induction of RelA/p65 DNA binding activity in detached RIE-1 cells that was maximal after 1 h of suspension culture and declined after 2 and 4 h (Fig. 2B). Together, these findings indicate that RIE-1 cells activate an NF-κB RelA/p65-p50 heterodimer by suspension culture. Activation of RelA/p65-p50 heterodimers by prototypic stimuli, such as TNF-α, is controlled by the “canonical” NF-κB pathway, involving IKKβ-dependent phosphorylation of IκBα (11Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4106) Google Scholar). Using an antibody against serine 32-phosphorylated IκBα, by Western blot analysis we found that suspension culture of RIE-1 cells induced this phosphorylation, indicating activation of the IKK complex (Fig. 2C, top). When we examined total IκBα levels by Western blot, surprisingly, we did not observe a robust decline in protein abundance in suspension-cultured RIE-1 cells, since usually serine 32/36-phosphorylated IκBα is targeted to proteasomal degradation. To determine if the persistence of IκBα expression in suspension-cultured cells might be due to rapid resynthesis of IκBα, we compared protein levels of IκBα in suspension-cultured cells in the absence or presence of protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (Fig. 2C, bottom). This analysis revealed that cycloheximide treatment greatly reduced IκBα expression in suspension-cultured RIE-1 cells, which indicates that these cells rapidly resynthesize this protein after NF-κB activation. To verify the importance of IKKβ-triggered IκBα degradation in the NF-κB activation by this pathway, we compared NF-κB activity in control REV cells and mutant IκBα-expressing RSR cells. Expression of nondegradable mutant IκBα completely abolished suspension culture-induced NF-κB activation, as assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 2D, left) and by ELISA (Fig. 2D, right). Moreover, blockade of proteasome function with MG132 also dose-dependently inhibited NF-κB activity induced by culture in suspension, which supports the importance of proteasome activity in NF-κB activation (Fig. 2E). The role of IKKβ in NF-κB activation was further evaluated by transiently transfecting dominant negative mutant forms of this kinase into RIE-1 cells. Both a T loop serine 177/181 to alanine mutant and a kinase-dead K44A mutant plasmid of IKKβ greatly reduced NF-κB activity induced by culture in suspension (Fig. 2F). Together, these results support the importance of IKK"
https://openalex.org/W2018450317,"α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) glutamate receptors (AMPARs) are ligand-gated sodium channels. Through their ability to mediate the majority of rapid excitatory transmission in the central nervous system, these neurotransmitter receptors have been shown to influence synaptic plasticity. Some of these receptors are also calcium-permeable (CP), and they also have been implicated in regulating synaptic plasticity, particularly in interneurons where their concentration is highest. However, the biochemical pathways emanating from CP-AMPARs that mediate these effects have not been well characterized. In this paper, we show that CP-AMPARs are the predominant AMPAR class responsible for activating the Ras/Erk kinase signaling cascade and the cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) transcription factor in the cortex of mature mice. Activation of Ras and Erk, but not CREB, occurs through the calcium/calmodulin regulated Ras-GRF1 and Ras-GRF2 exchange factors, which form AMPA-induced complexes with CP-AMPARs but not calcium-impermeable (CI) AMPARs in vivo. Furthermore, we show that CP-AMPARs are also the major AMPAR type to activate Ras/Erk signaling in pubescent mice; however, at this developmental stage Ras-GRF (guanine nucleotide-releasing factor) proteins are not involved. Finally, in neonatal animals CI-AMPARs, but not CP-AMPARs, are the predominant AMPAR type that activates Ras-Erk signaling and CREB in cortical neurons. This occurs indirectly through activation of L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels, an event that is also Ras-GRF-independent. Thus, Ras/Erk signaling and CREB activity induced by AMPARs occur through age-dependent mechanisms that likely make unique developmentally dependent contributions to synaptic function."
https://openalex.org/W2074960045,"Type I collagen (Col I)-stimulated matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activation via membrane type 1 MMP (MT1-MMP) involves both a transcriptional increase in MT1-MMP expression and a nontranscriptional response mediated by preexisting MT1-MMP. In order to identify which MT1-MMP domains were required for the nontranscriptional response, MCF-7 cells that lack endogenous MT1-MMP were transfected with either wild type or domain mutant MT1-MMP constructs. We observed that mutant constructs lacking the MT1-MMP cytoplasmic tail were able to activate MMP-2 in response to Col I but not a construct lacking the MT1-MMP hemopexin domain. Col I did not alter total MT1-MMP protein levels; nor did it appear to directly induce MT1-MMP oligomerization. Col I did, however, redistribute preexisting MT1-MMP to the cell periphery compared with unstimulated cells that displayed a more diffuse staining pattern. In addition, Col I blocked the internalization of MT1-MMP in a dynamin-dependent manner via clathrin-coated pit-mediated endocytosis. This mechanism of impaired internalization is different from that reported for concanavalin A, since it is not mediated by the cytoplasmic tail of MT1-MMP but rather by the hemopexin domain. In summary, upon Col I binding to its cell surface receptor, MT1-MMP internalization via clathrin-coated pit-mediated endocytosis is impaired through interactions with the hemopexin domain, thereby regulating its function and ability to activate MMP-2.

Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar). Due to their ability to influence a plethora of cell functions, aberrant MMP activity has been associated with several pathological situations such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic nephropathy, angiogenesis, and tumor invasion and metastasis (2Lafleur M.A. Handsley M.M.

Although several MMPs have been associated with tumor progression, particular attention has been focused on MMP-2 and MT1-MMP, which are often produced by peritumoral fibroblasts within a tumor (4Noel A.C.

An important role of several of the MT-MMPs (MT1-, MT2-, MT3-, MT5-, and MT6-MMP) is the cell-localized activation of pro-MMP-2 (10Seiki M. Koshikawa N. Yana I. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2003; 22: 129-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). MT1-MMP is also a key enzyme involved in cell migration and invasion and has been localized to the leading edge of migrating cells, thus facilitating matrix remodeling (7Kajita M. Itoh Y. Chiba T.

Although unchallenged MMP-2 null mice appear healthy, double knock-out MMP-2/MT1-MMP null mice show a more severe phenotype compared with the single MT1-MMP null mice, since the double null mice die within minutes of birth (14Oh J.

This important observation highlights the cooperativity of MMP-2 and MT1-MMP in vivo, indicating that both enzymes have unique and overlapping functions. MMP-2 activation proceeds on the cell surface in a two-step process involving a trimolecular complex of MT1-MMP, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2, and MMP-2. The initial cleavage of the pro-domain of MMP-2 is mediated by the membrane-tethered MT1-MMP, generating an intermediate form of MMP-2 (15Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A.

The regulation of internalization of MT1-MMP has been postulated as a rapid short term level of control of net MT1-MMP proteolytic activity on the cell surface. Primary fibroblasts grown in three-dimensional fibrillar collagen gels have previously been shown to activate MMP-2 (27Ruangpanit N. Chan D. Holmbeck K. Birkedal-Hansen H. Polarek J. Yang C.

This has also been extended to other cell types, such as endothelial cells and tumor cell lines such as HT1080, MDA-MB-231, and BT549 cells (29Azzam H.S. Arand G. Lippman M.E. Thompson E.W. J. Natl.

Col I can activate MMP-2 through 2 distinct mechanisms. First, Col I can increase MT1-MMP mRNA and protein levels, thereby activating MMP-2 (transcriptional response). Indeed, endothelial cells cultured in a three-dimensional Col I matrix induced MT1-MMP expression, which was dependent on the Egr-1 site in the MT1-MMP promoter (32Haas T.L. Stitelman D. Davis S.J.

Col I induction of MT1-MMP mRNA also appeared to be dependent on Rac1 function in HT1080 cells (33Zhuge Y. Xu J. J. Biol.

Furthermore, treatment of HT1080 cells with Col I induced MT1-MMP-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation, which in turn increased MT1-MMP protein levels and cell migration (31Takino T.

However, an alternate pathway has been observed in which Col I increases the activity of preexisting MT1-MMP molecules in order to activate MMP-2 (nontranscriptional response) (34Galvez B.G. Matias-Roman S. Yanez-Mo M. Sanchez-Madrid F. Arroyo A.G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 509-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 35Gilles C. Polette M. Seiki M. Birembaut P. Thompson E.W. Lab. Invest. 1997; 76: 651-660PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the importance of MT1-MMP and MMP-2 in several pathological conditions, including tumor invasion and metastasis, we aimed to study the nontranscriptional mechanism of MMP-2 activation via MT1-MMP induced by Col I, the latter being abundant in the tissue stroma. We determined that Col I blocks MT1-MMP internalization through a clathrin-coated pit-mediated mechanism involving the MT1-MMP hemopexin domain, thereby stimulating MMP-2 activation.

Quantification of RNA was established based on A260 nm and A280 nm using an ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies Inc., Rockland, DE). Zymography—Conditioned medium was mixed with SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% (w/v) SDS, 0.025% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) and separated on a 10% polyacrylamide resolving gel co-polymerized with 1 mg/ml gelatin (BDH Laboratory Supplies, Poole, UK). Zymograms were then washed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5mm CaCl2 (pH 8.0), and 2.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 overnight and then incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm CaCl2 for 24 h at 37 °C.

Western Blot Analysis—Equal amounts of total protein from each sample, determined by a BCA protein quantification assay, were prepared in SDS sample buffer as above with 100 mm dithiothreitol and boiled for 5 min. Protein samples were separated with a 10% polyacrylamide resolving gel. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for 1 h at 100 V. Membranes were then blocked in 5% (w/v) skim milk powder in 0.1% (v/v) TBS-Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature and probed either with a mouse anti-human MT1-MMP antibody (clone 114-1F2; 1 μg/ml), a rabbit anti-human polyclonal MT1-MMP antibody (AB815; 1 μg/ml), an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (0.5 μg/ml), or an anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (P-Tyr-100; 0.5 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were then washed in 0.1% (v/v) TBS-Tween 20 and probed with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody for all monoclonal primary antibodies or a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody for the polyclonal primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed in 0.1% (v/v) TBS-Tween 20, and detection of the secondary antibody was performed using the SuperSignal Chemiluminescent Substrate system (Pierce). For cell surface biotinylation analysis, membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) BSA in 0.1% (v/v) TBS-Tween 20 for 30 min at room temperature and probed with ExtrAvidin-horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature. In the case of the MMP-2 Western blot analysis, membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature using ODYSSEY blocking buffer and probed with an MMP-2 antibody (PAB 753; 10 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were then washed in 0.1% (v/v) TBS-Tween 20 and probed with IRDye700DX-conjugated purified anti-rabbit antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed in 0.1% (v/v) TBS-Tween 20, and detection was performed using the fluorescence 700 channel on the ODYSSEY Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). Densitometry was performed with the ODYSSEY program, version 1.2. cDNA Synthesis and Quantitative PCR—cDNA was prepared from 100 ng of total RNA. cDNA was generated with the Thermoscript RT-PCR System (Invitrogen) using gene-specific priming with primer 5′-CAGAAAACGTGCACATGAGCTGC-3′ for human L32 and primer 5′-CAGCCAAGTGGCGGTAGGAT-3′ for dynamin and an annealing/extension temperature of 55 °C. Human ribosomal protein L32 mRNA was used as a housekeeping gene to normalize all samples. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed on an ABI Prism 5700 Sequence Detection System (PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems, Scoresby, Australia) with cDNA generated from an equivalent of 2 ng of RNA in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm Mg(C2H3O2)2, 50 mm KCl, 200 μm dNTPs, a 1:40,000 dilution of SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes), 1 μg/ml 6-carboxy-X-rhodamine (Molecular Probes), 8% (v/v) Me2SO, 200 nm primers, and 0.625 units of AmpliTaq Gold polymerase (Applied Biosystems) per 25-μl reaction. PCR primers are as follows: human L32 forward primer, 5′-CAGGGTTCGTAGAAGATTCAAGGG-3′; human L32 reverse primer, 5′-CTTGGAGGAAACATTGTGAGCGATC-3′; forward rat dynamin primer, 5′-CCGGGACATGCTTATGCAGTTT-3′; and reverse rat dynamin primer, 5′-GGCGGCTGTGATATCCTTCTT-3′. Reaction conditions were 95 °C for 10 min followed by 50 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Melt curve analysis from 60 to 95 °C was performed at the end of each run as a quality control step. The difference in average cycle threshold between L32 (housekeeping) and dynamin was determined by quadruplicate readings for each sample, and the mean and S.D. were determined. Data were presented as relative expression levels relative to wild type dynamin-transfected MCF-7 cells. Internalization Detection by Immunofluorescence—Transfected MCF-7 cells were plated and stimulated as indicated on Teflon-printed glass slides (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Ft. Washington, PA) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The following day, cells were equilibrated at 4 °C for 30 min and incubated with a rabbit anti-human polyclonal MT1-MMP antibody (AB815; 1 μg/ml) in serum-free medium for 2 h at 4 °C or 25 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated transferrin in serum-free medium for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with chilled PBS to remove unbound material and then untreated or treated with acetic acid (500 mm acetic acid, 150 mm NaCl) for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cell surface-bound MT1-MMP or transferrin. This method has previously been shown to be very effective at removing cell surface-bound antibody without affecting the internalized antibody-antigen complex (25Uekita T. Itoh Y. Yana I. Ohno H. Seiki M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In addition, after incubation with the MT1-MMP antibody at 4 °C, some cells were washed in chilled PBS and placed at 37 °C for the indicated time periods to resume the internalization process of cell surface molecules. Cells were then treated or not with acetic acid as above and washed with chilled PBS. Cells were fixed with 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde/PBS for 20 min and blocked/permeabilized with 5% (w/v) BSA, 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100, PBS for 30 min. Primary antibody was detected with a donkey anti-rabbit secondary Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated antibody (4 μg/ml) in 1% (w/v) BSA/PBS for 1 h at room temperature. After several PBS washes, nuclei were stained with propidium iodide (0.25 mg/ml in 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100, PBS, RNase) for 10 min at 37 °C for antibody-labeled cells. Cells were then washed in PBS, mounted using fluorescent mounting medium (DAKO), in PBS, mounted using and viewed by confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad MRC 1024). The percentage of internalized MT1-MMP at each time point was determined by measuring the pixel intensity of internalized (acid-treated) samples versus total MT1-MMP. Three representative fields per sample were used for statistical analysis. Immunofluorescence for the Detection of Cell Surface MT1-MMP—After transfection with the indicated plasmids, MCF-7 cells were plated on Teflon-printed glass slides overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The following day, cells were equilibrated at 4 °C for 30 min and incubated with a rabbit anti-human polyclonal MT1-MMP antibody (AB815; 1 μg/ml) in serum-free medium for 2 h at 4°C to label cell surface MT1-MMP molecules only. Cells were washed with chilled PBS, fixed with 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde/PBS for 20 min at room temperature, and blocked with 5% (w/v) BSA/PBS for 30 min. Primary antibody was detected with a donkey anti-rabbit secondary Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated antibody (4 μg/ml) in 1% (w/v) BSA/PBS for 1 h at room temperature. After several washes in PBS, nuclei were stained with propidium iodide (0.25 mg/ml in 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100, PBS, RNase) for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed in PBS and mounted using fluorescent mounting medium and viewed by confocal microscopy. Nontranscriptional Component of Col I-induced MMP-2 Activation—As previously mentioned, Col I can activate MMP-2 in several cell types (27Ruangpanit N. Chan D. Holmbeck K. Birkedal-Hansen H.

However, the DNA supercoiling activity is inefficient and requires an excess amount of enzyme relative to DNA. We report here several activities that reverse gyrase can efficiently mediate with a substoichiometric amount of enzyme. In the presence of a nucleotide cofactor, reverse gyrase can readily relax negative supercoils, but not the positive ones, from a plasmid DNA substrate. Reverse gyrase can completely relax positively supercoiled DNA, provided that the DNA substrate contains a single-stranded bubble. Reverse gyrase efficiently anneals complementary single-stranded circles.

We have designed a novel method based on phage-mid DNA vectors to prepare a circular DNA substrate containing a single-stranded bubble with defined length and sequence. With these bubble DNA substrates, we demonstrated that efficient positive supercoiling by reverse gyrase requires a bubble size larger than 20 nucleotides. The activities of annealing single-stranded DNA circles and positive supercoiling of bubble substrate demonstrate that reverse gyrase can function as a DNA renaturase.

Transactions of genetic information in DNA invariably require unwinding and rewinding of DNA double helix, processes usually resulting in creating topological problems. Nature’s solution to such problems is DNA topoisomerases that can reversibly cleave DNA strands and carry out strand passage through an enzyme-mediated DNA break (reviewed in Refs. 1Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar, 2Wang J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar, 3Corbett K.D. Berger J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2004; 33: 95-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Based on the structure and mechanism of topoisomerases, they are grouped into two types, both of which use an active-site tyrosine to form a transient tyrosyl phosphate bond during the step of reversible DNA cleavage. Type I enzymes generate single strand cleavage, and type II enzymes make coordinated breaks in both DNA strands. Type I topoisomerase is divided into two structurally and mechanistically distinct subfamilies. Type IB enzymes, present in all eukaryotes, certain eukaryotic viruses, and some bacterial species (4Krogh B.O. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1853-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), form a 3′-phosphotyrosyl covalent adduct at the DNA cleavage site. They can readily remove either positive or negative supercoils, capable of serving as an efficient swivel during DNA transactions (5Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Type IA enzymes are ubiquitous, present in eukaryotic, eubacterial, and archaebacterial species. Their enzymatic activity involves strand passage through a protein-mediated DNA gate formed with a tyrosyl linkage to a 5′ phosphoryl group at the cleavage site (6Dekker N.H. Rybenkov V.V. Duguet M. Crisona N.J. Cozzarelli N.R. Bensimon D. Croquette V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12126-12131Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These enzymes prefer DNA substrates with a single-stranded region and usually can only relax negative supercoils in a plasmid DNA. Type IA enzymes may have more divergent roles in DNA metabolism besides that as a swivel. Reverse gyrase is the only topoisomerase that can insert positive supercoils into DNA (7Kikuchi A. Asai K. Nature. 1984; 309: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). It has two closely linked domains: a helicase domain and a type IA topoisomerase domain (8Confalonieri F. Elie C. Nadal M. de La Tour C. Forterre P. Duguet M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4753-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 9Krah R. Kozyavkin S.A. Slesarev A.I. Gellert M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 106-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 10Declais A.C. Marsault J. Confalonieri F. de La Tour C.B. Duguet M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19498-19504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of reverse gyrase from Archaeoglobus fulgidus revealed that the structure of the topoisomerase domain is very similar to those from bacterial type IA topoisomerases, and the helicase domain shares the structure with several DNA helicases except for some residues involved in helicase translocation (11Rodriguez A.C. Stock D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Despite the availability of three-dimensional structures, the biochemical mechanism of reverse gyrase remains to be elucidated. Three mechanisms have been proposed. The first is the selective relaxation of the negative supercoils generated behind the translocating helicase moiety (8Confalonieri F. Elie C. Nadal M. de La Tour C. Forterre P. Duguet M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4753-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, there is no evidence that the helicase domain can translocate along DNA because no strand displacement activity was detected with either intact reverse gyrase or with the recombinant helicase domain (10Declais A.C. Marsault J. Confalonieri F. de La Tour C.B. Duguet M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19498-19504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The second is that upon the unwinding of the DNA by the helicase domain, the reverse gyrase can separate the circular DNA into two topologically independent domains, one with the unwound base pairs, and the other with positive supercoils induced by the unwinding action in the other region (10Declais A.C. Marsault J. Confalonieri F. de La Tour C.B. Duguet M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19498-19504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The reverse gyrase can renature the unwound region without altering the positive supercoiling in the other domain, thereby leaving behind positive supercoils. How reverse gyrase can segregate the DNA molecule into two topological domains, and how the enzyme can switch between unwinding and rewinding action are not addressed here. The third is that reverse gyrase is capable of direction-specific strand passage, thus generating positive supercoils (11Rodriguez A.C. Stock D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The biochemical basis for this vectorial strand passage is unknown. Our recent experiments with reverse gyrase have revealed several interesting new findings (12Hsieh T.S. Capp C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20467-20475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Reverse gyrase is able to carry out different supercoiling reactions depending on the nucleotide cofactor. Besides the hallmark positive supercoiling activity by reverse gyrase with ATP, the enzyme is capable of generating hypernegatively supercoiled DNA in the presence of AMPPNP, 2The abbreviation used is: AMPPNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate. and a mostly relaxed, but slightly positively supercoiled DNA in the presence of ADP. These supercoiling activities are inefficient and require an excess amount of enzyme to DNA. The final level of supercoiling depends on the enzyme to DNA ratio. This dependence is not because of a kinetic effect, since the reaction rate is the same with different amounts of enzyme in our reaction conditions. Furthermore, the negative supercoiling by reverse gyrase with AMPPNP is resistant to relaxation by a potent topoisomerase I added to the reaction, suggesting that negative supercoils are constrained, possibly because of the binding of reverse gyrase/AMPPNP to the unwound region in DNA. Based on these results, we propose that reverse gyrase has affinity for either single- or double-stranded DNA, depending on whether the bound cofactor is ATP or ADP, respectively. Reverse gyrase with ATP can bind to the single-stranded region in the DNA, and upon the hydrolysis of ATP to generate ADP, the enzyme will then have a higher affinity for duplex DNA. This switch in binding specificity, coupled with the strand passage activity, facilitates rewinding of the unwound region. Because the linking number changes depend on the enzyme binding to DNA, the magnitude of final supercoiling is determined by the enzyme to DNA ratio. In this article, we have analyzed the reactions that reverse gyrase can efficiently mediate with a substoichiometric amount of enzyme. They include supercoil relaxation, annealing of complementary single-stranded DNA circles, and positive supercoiling of DNA with a single-stranded bubble. These reverse gyrase activities provide new insight into their biochemical mechanism, and possibly their intracellular functions. Enzymes—Reverse gyrase was purified from an Escherichia coli strain expressing cloned A. fulgidus reverse gyrase following the published procedure from Rodriguez and Stock (11Rodriguez A.C. Stock D.

Chem. 2005; 280: 20467-20475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Recombinant Drosophila topoisomerase I was described previously (14Hsieh T.-s. Brown S.D. Huang P. Fostel J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6177-6182Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). All the restriction enzymes and T7 endonuclease I were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). DNA Substrates—Plasmid DNA including pUC19, pUC(AT)19, and pBS/SK- were prepared through double CsCl/ethidium bromide density gradient ultracentrifugation. Their relaxed forms were prepared from reac-tions with Drosophila topoisomerase I (14Hsieh T.-s. Brown S.D. Huang P. Fostel J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6177-6182Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Positively supercoiled DNA substrates were generated by treating DNA with reverse gyrase at an enzyme/DNA ratio of 41 at 85 °C using the reverse gyrase reaction conditions described earlier (12Hsieh T.S. Capp C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20467-20475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The bubble substrate, a covalently closed circular DNA molecule containing a single-stranded bubble, was made by annealing two single-stranded circles prepared from cells with phagemids pBS/SK+ and pBS/SK- using the published protocol (15Plank J.L. Chu S.H. Pohlhaus J.R. Wilson-Sali T. Hsieh T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3564-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Circular DNA substrates containing a bubble with a variable but defined size were synthesized with a modification of the technique described for making bubble substrate. Briefly, DNA sequences were introduced into phagemid vectors such that the single-stranded circles produced from them, after the annealing reaction, will give rise to DNA with two bubbles: one from the f1 replication origin (f1 ori), and the other from the cloned oligonucleotide sequences to form a bubble with the desired length (Fig. 1A). To remove the single-stranded bubble with the f1 ori sequence, we used the Cre/loxP site-specific recombination reaction to create the intramolecular deletion (16Abremski K. Hoess R. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The product will be a relaxed circular DNA with a unique single-stranded bubble of defined size and sequence. To facilitate the DNA manipulations described here, we created two phagemid DNA vectors, for plus and minus single-stranded circles, respectively, of a size of 6.1 kb and with two loxP sites bisecting the DNA circle and oriented in parallel direction. For making DNA with a bubble of 50, 20, or 5 nucleotides in length, we synthesized 6 pairs of oligonucleotides (Fig. 1B). They can be annealed to form 6 oligonucleotide duplexes, each of which will have unique restriction sites of NheI and XmaI at the ends. The duplexes from annealing A and B series (P50, P20, and P5) were cloned into the NheI/XmaI sites in the phagemid vector for plus strand synthesis, and the duplexes from annealing C and D series (M50, M20, and M5) cloned into phagemid vector for minus strand synthesis. The DNA sequences of the single-stranded bubbles and their neighboring regions are shown in Fig. 1B. DNA constructs were sequenced to confirm the insertion of correct oligonucleotide sequences into the vector. Single-stranded DNA made from vectors with P50 and M50 can anneal and form a bubble of 50 nucleotides on one strand and 49 on the other (Bubble 50). Those from P20 and M20 will form a bubble of 20 nucleotides (Bubble 20), and P5 and M5 will result in a 5-nucleotide bubble (Bubble 5). The sequences flanking the bubble are GC-rich to limit the size of the bubble at elevated temperatures. We used 250 μg each of the plus and minus strand pair and annealed them in 3 ml of reverse gyrase reaction buffer containing 1 mm ADP and 0.2 μm reverse gyrase at 80 °C for 1 h (reaction step A, Fig. 1A). To minimize the topological complexity in the products of the subsequent Cre recombinase reaction, restriction enzyme XhoI was added to cleave the annealed product at the single restriction site (reaction step B, Fig. 1A) to generate a full-length linear molecule. The Cre-mediated cyclization reaction was carried out in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 33 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2 with 40 nm annealed DNA and 40 units/ml of Cre enzyme (step C, Fig. 1A). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and DNA products were purified and concentrated through a MaxiPrep column from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The intramolecular recombination reaction results in the cyclization of a 3.1-kb DNA sequence containing a single loxP site and the single-stranded bubble with defined sequence and length (bubble substrate, Fig. 1A). Because the cyclized DNA is the major covalently closed species in the reaction products, we used CsCl/ethidium bromide density gradient centrifugation to purify it away from the linear fragments of the recombination product containing the f1 ori bubble, and the unreacted linear, full-length DNA. The DNA sample after the banding run was extracted with n-butanol to remove ethidium bromide and dialyzed into TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA). Reverse Gyrase Reaction—The reaction was usually carried out in a 30-μl buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.45 μg of DNA substrate, 1 mm adenine nucleotide cofactor, and a variable amount of reverse gyrase to give an enzyme/DNA ratio ranging from 0.1 to 100. The reaction was usually carried out at 80 °C unless otherwise indicated, and followed by the time course of 3.5, 7, 15, 30, and 60 min. Agarose Gel Electrophoresis—The reverse gyrase reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose in a buffer containing 36 mm Tris phosphate, pH 7.6, and 1 mm EDTA (TPE buffer). To resolve negatively supercoiled DNA, we added chloroquine to the gel and running buffer at a concentration of 30 μm in TPE. For resolving positively supercoiled DNA, the gel and running buffer included 5 μg/ml of netropsin in TPE. We also analyzed DNA samples under a denaturing condition to ascertain the topological linkage between complementary single-stranded circles. The electrophoresis was run in an alkaline solution containing 30 mm NaOH and 1 mm EDTA. The gel electrophoresis under neutral or alkaline conditions was carried out at a voltage gradient of 1.5 V/cm for 16 h at room temperature. The alkaline gel after electrophoresis was first neutralized with TPE for 1 h. The gel was stained with a solution of 0.3 μg/ml ethidium bromide for 30 min, irradiated with UV light to promote DNA nicking, followed by staining in ethidium solution and destaining in water. The DNA bands were visualized with an imaging system EpiChemi3 (UVP Bioimaging System, Garland, CA). Plasmid DNA Relaxation—In our previous work, we noticed that when using the plasmid DNA as a substrate, there is an initial fast phase of supercoil relaxation, followed by insertion of DNA supercoils. Here we analyzed the supercoil relaxation reaction by reverse gyrase under substoichiometric conditions (enzyme/DNA ratio of 0.1), and in the presence of different adenine nucleotide cofactors (Fig. 2). At the optimal temperature of 80 °C (Fig. 2, top panel), reverse gyrase cannot relax DNA in the presence of AMP, but can relax DNA with ADP as a cofactor (lanes 2-6 and lanes 7-11, respectively). The relaxation reaction with ATP is extremely efficient; most of the negative supercoils were removed by the first time point at 3.5 min (lanes 12-16). Whereas the hallmark reaction for reverse gyrase is DNA positive supercoiling in the presence of ATP, we have shown that this reaction requires more than stoichiometric amounts of enzyme. In agreement with our earlier results, a substoichiometric amount of reverse gyrase cannot supercoil DNA even after prolonged incubation. The relaxation reaction with AMPPNP as cofactor is only partial (Fig. 2, lanes 17-21, top panel), in part because of the ability of reverse gyrase to unwind DNA when AMP-PNP is present, thereby stabilizing negative supercoils. A unique feature of the reverse gyrase supercoiling reaction is temperature sensitivity. Raising the temperature from 80 to 85 °C greatly enhances both the negative and positive supercoiling reactions, and lowering to 75 °C drastically reduces them (12Hsieh T.S. Capp C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20467-20475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In an interesting contrast, the supercoil relaxation with a substoichiometric amount of reverse gyrase is not exquisitely sensitive to the temperature. Raising the temperature from 80 to 85 °C does not increase the relaxation activity with either ADP or ATP as cofactors (Fig. 2, bottom panel, lanes 7-11 and lanes 12-16, respectively). The loss of partial relaxation with AMP-PNP as a cofactor (Fig. 2, lanes 17-21, bottom panel) is presumably because of the fact that DNA unwinding is favored at an elevated temperature. At 85 °C, the plasmid DNA is in a pre-melting state with extensively unwound regions (12Hsieh T.S. Capp C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20467-20475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 17Duguet M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Similar relaxation reactions were carried out at 75 °C, and the activities were not significantly different from those observed at 80 °C (data not shown), again demonstrating that the relaxation reaction by reverse gyrase is not as sensitive to temperature as the supercoiling reaction. Reverse gyrase is an atypical type IA topoisomerase, with both a topo I and DNA helicase domain present in the protein, and is capable of supercoiling and relaxing DNA. Its negative supercoil relaxation activity, similar to other type IA topoisomerases, likely requires an unwound region, in this case, promoted by negative supercoiling and elevated reaction temperature. However, it will be interesting to examine whether reverse gyrase has positive supercoil relaxation activity, and what the requirements are for such an activity. We have prepared 3 positively supercoiled DNA substrates, a plasmid DNA (pBS/SK-), DNA with single-stranded bubble (pBS/SK Bubble), and a plasmid with a 38-bp insert of alternating AT (pUC(AT)19). The bubble DNA was prepared by annealing two single-stranded circles produced from phagemids pBS/SK+ and pBS/SK- as described earlier (15Plank J.L. Chu S.H. Pohlhaus J.R. Wilson-Sali T. Hsieh T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 3564-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Because reverse gyrase will introduce positive supercoils into the bubble substrate in the presence of ATP (see later sections under “Results”), supercoil relaxation reactions were carried out with ADP as the cofactor. Neither positively supercoiled pBS/SK- nor pUC(AT)19 are relaxed by reverse gyrase (Fig. 3, lanes 1-5 and lanes 6-10, respectively). Whereas the AT-rich segment is expected to be unwound in a relaxed or negatively supercoiled DNA, the positive supercoiling in this DNA will promote base pairing in the AT-rich region (18Hsieh T.S. Wang J.C. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 19Benham C.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 835-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The positive supercoils in the bubble substrate can be fully relaxed (Fig. 3, lanes 11-15). As a control, all three positively supercoiled DNA can be relaxed completely by a type IB topoisomerase, Drosophila topo I (lanes 19-21). These results demonstrate that in the mode of supercoil relaxation, reverse gyrase is similar to other type IA topoisomerases in that it can relax negatively supercoiled DNA, and only relax the positive supercoils provided the substrate contains a permanently denatured region. Topological Linking of Complementary Single-stranded DNA Circles—One of the hallmark reactions for a type I topoisomerase is the linking of two complementary single-stranded circles through the transient single strand breaks generated by these enzymes. Both rat liver topo I, a type IB enzyme, and E. coli topo I, a type IA enzyme, can mediate this reaction (20Champoux J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5328-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 21Kirkegaard K. Wang J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 3811-3820Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We have prepared plus and minus strands of circular DNA from the corresponding phagemids, and incubated equal moles of two single-stranded circles with reverse gyrase in the presence or absence of cofactors. The DNA products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis under either neutral (Fig. 4A) or alkaline (Fig. 4B) conditions. Without enzyme, incubation of the complementary circles resulted in the formation of DNA species migrating slower than the single-stranded DNA control (Fig. 4A, lanes 21 and 22), presumably because annealing complementary sequences to form circular DNA with duplex winding in both right-handed and left-handed senses, and with interruptions of single-stranded regions (Form V DNA). However, the two DNA strands are not linked topologically (linking number, Lk = 0). This is confirmed by the analysis of gel electrophoresis in alkaline buffer, in which the annealed circles were denatured and comigrated with single-stranded circles (Fig. 4B, lanes 21 and 22). With reverse gyrase, DNA species migrating slower than Form V appeared during the time course of the reactions, suggesting that topological linkage was introduced. However, this strand linking was most efficient with ATP as the cofactor (Fig. 4A, lanes 9-12). The topological linkage between single-stranded circles can be readily monitored with alkaline gel electrophoresis. The initial strand passage between two circles produces the largest mobility shift, and the interlocked dimer with a single crossover between two strands is the slowest migrating species on the gel (Fig. 4B). Subsequent topological linkage further compacts DNA under denaturing conditions, and the electrophoretic mobility correlates with the linking number between the intertwining strands. Using known supercoiled DNA markers, we established that the order of increasing mobility is hypernegatively supercoiled, negatively supercoiled, relaxed, and positively supercoiled DNA (data not shown, and Fig. 4B). Whereas reverse gyrase is inefficient in linking two single-stranded circles without any cofactor (Fig. 4, lanes 1-4), the presence of either ADP or AMPPNP promotes the interlocking reaction, albeit at a slower rate when compared with ATP reactions (lanes 5-8 and 13-16 versus lanes 9-12). We have also tested the annealing reaction with a canonical type IA enzyme, topoisomerase I from T. maritima. With an equivalent amount of enzyme in terms of supercoil relaxation activity, T. maritima topo I anneals about half of the single-stranded circles (lanes 17-20). Therefore, the presence of a helicase domain in a topoisomerase can greatly facilitate the strand annealing reaction. Whereas the helicase domain in reverse gyrase has no detectable DNA translocation activity, we proposed earlier that in the presence ATP it has a preference for binding single-stranded regions. This unique activity in reverse gyrase could remove adventitious base pairing, which may entrap the annealing reaction intermediates in non-productive, dead-end products. It is interesting to note that in the presence of ATP, reverse gyrase can carry out two distinct but topologically similar reactions, annealing complementary DNA strands and positive supercoiling, both of which result in an increase in the linking number. Efficient Positive Supercoiling with a DNA Substrate Containing a Single-stranded Bubble—Positive DNA supercoiling of plasmid DNA by reverse gyrase is relatively inefficient and requires an excess amount of enzyme. For example, at an enzyme/DNA ratio of about 10, each DNA gyrase can introduce less than one positive supercoil, and the average number of supercoils introduced per reverse gyrase molecule decreases at higher enzyme to DNA ratios (12Hsieh T.S. Capp C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20467-20475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It is therefore surprising to observe efficient positive supercoiling in the DNA products after strand annealing (Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 9-10), because the enzyme to DNA ratio was 0.8 in these experiments. However, the DNA products from single strand annealing experiments contain a single-stranded bubble because of the presence of identical, rather than complementary, sequence in the f1 replication origin (f1 ori) in the single-stranded circles. To examine if the presence of a single-stranded bubble may be responsible for such an efficient positive supercoiling reaction, we prepared relaxed DNA substrates from the bubble substrate generated from the strand annealing reaction, and its vector plasmid control, pBS/SK-. We used these relaxed DNA substrates in positive supercoiling reactions with a substoichiometric amount of reverse gyrase (Fig. 5). Concordant with the previous results, at an enzyme/DNA ratio of either 0.5 or 0.1, the plasmid DNA substrate showed no change in DNA supercoiling over a time course up to 1 h (Fig. 5, lanes 1-5 and 11-15). With relaxed bubble substrate, the DNA was positively supercoiled by 15 min with an enzyme/DNA ratio of 0.5 (Fig. 5, lanes 6-10). Even with 5-fold less enzyme, the DNA was efficiently supercoiled after a 60-min incubation with reverse gyrase (Fig. 5, lanes 16-20). Positive supercoiling in the DNA products was confirmed by gel electrophoresis in the presence of chloroquine or netropsin. With chloroquine gel, positively supercoiled DNA still ran as a fast migrating band, whereas with netropsin gel, their electrophoretic mobility was retarded (data not shown). The efficient positive supercoiling of a bubble substrate suggests that reverse gyrase can increase the linking number by promoting duplex winding in a single-stranded region. Minimal Size of the Single-stranded Bubble for Efficient Positive Supercoiling—The single-stranded region in the bubble substrate used in the above experiments is present because of the f1 ori sequence, and is 462 nucleotides in length. To determine the length requirement for a single strand bubble, we designed a novel method to synthesize a circular DNA substrate with a desired length and sequence context of the single-stranded region. The reaction steps and conditions for the synthesis were described under “Experimental Procedures.” It is based on the same idea as the synthesis of the bubble substrate: annealing two complementary circles produced from phagemids. An insertion sequence was engineered into the DNA so that the annealed circle has two single-stranded bubbles, one from the inserted sequence to give a bubble with desired length, and the other from the f1 ori. We have also introduced a tandem set of loxP sites into the DNA vector sequence, thus allowing the Cre/loxP site-specific recombination to remove the f1 ori bubble and leave behind a covalently closed circle with only the engineered bubble from the inserted sequence (see Fig. 1A for a schematic diagram). We designed 6 sets of oligonucleotide sequences to insert into the phagemid vectors (Fig. 1B), which result in the synthesis of a 3.1-kb DNA substrate with a bubble size of 5, 20, or 50 nucleotides. The presence of a single-stranded region in these DNA substrates was also confirmed by their sensitivity toward a structure-specific endonuclease, T7 endo I, compared with either a control sequence without the bubble or a plasmid vector DNA (supplementary Fig. S1). These relaxed bubble DNA substrates were used in subsequent experiments with reverse gyrase. We first examined the 5-nucleotide (Bub5) and 50-nucleotide (Bub50) bubble substrate in the positive supercoiling reactions (Fig. 6, A and B). With an enzyme/DNA ratio of 0.5, Bub5 showed no change in DNA supercoiling (Fig. 6A, lanes 1-5). In contrast, Bub50 was supercoiled with a similar rate and extent as the DNA with a much larger f1 ori bubble (Fig. 6A, lanes 6-10; compared with Fig. 5, lanes 6-10). The extent of DNA supercoiling was further analyzed by gel electrophoresis in the presence of netropsin (Fig. 6B, lanes 1-5). Because netropsin can wind DNA duplex, thus reducing the DNA writhe, the positively supercoiled DNA appeared more relaxed under such conditions. From comparing the distribution of DNA topoisomers between the starting material and the reaction product, we estimated there is an increase of 10 superhelical turns (ΔLK = +10), and thus about 20 supercoils per enzyme per DNA molecule. This number demonstrates a greatly enhanced efficiency in supercoling reactions on the bubble substrate, when compared with between 0.1 and 1 supercoil per enzyme using plasmid DNA as substrate. However, there is an apparent requirement of a minimal bubble size; a circular DNA with a 5-nucleotide bubble is not an efficient substrate. To further test the size limit of the bubble in supercoiling reactions, we examined the Bub20 under identical conditions. Both the rate and extent of supercoiling are reduced for Bub20 (Fig. 7, lanes 6-10). There are about 5 positive supercoils introduced after a 1-h incubation (Fig. 7, lane 10 versus 12), and further incubation for an additional hour did not significantly change the extent of supercoiling (data not shown). To create a control DNA prepared with similar experimental steps but without any single-stranded region, we used the M20 plasmid DNA as the substrate for the Cre-recombinase reaction. The DNA products were purified with similar steps as those for bubble substrate. This no-bubble DNA control again showed little change in supercoiling upon reverse gyrase reaction (Fig. 7A, lanes 1-5). These results suggest that the efficient supercoiling reactions require a bubble size of at least 20 nucleotides. Whereas the heteroduplex (non-complementary) sequence in the DNA provides a single-stranded region for reverse gyrase to act upon, we tested if a segment of the AT-rich sequence can satisfy the requirement of the single-stranded bubble in the supercoiling reaction. A stretch of AT sequence in a relaxed DNA substrate is expected to be denatured under the reverse gyrase conditions at 80 °C. Using a DNA containing 38 nucleotides of AT sequence, pUC(AT)19, we showed that the rate and extent of DNA supercoiling are similar to the bubble substrate of Bub50 or f1 ori bubble (Fig. 8, lanes 6-10). Analysis by gel electrophoresis with netropsin demonstrated an insertion of about 9 superhelical turns into the DNA product (data not shown), a result similar to those obtained by using Bub50. Reverse gyrase showed no activity on the vector control, pUC19 (Fig. 8, lanes 1-5). Combining the results shown in Figs. 7 and 8 there is a requirement of at least 20 nucleotides or more in the size of the single-stranded bubble for efficient positive supercoiling reactions, and the single-stranded region can be from either non-complementary heteroduplex sequence or from a stretch of AT sequence. Reverse gyrase is an unusual type IA topoisomerase both in terms of its structure and mechanism. It has two closely linked domains: a helicase domain at its N terminus and a type IA topoisomerase domain at its C terminus (8Confalonieri F. Elie C. Nadal M. de La Tour C. Forterre P. Duguet M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4753-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 10Declais A.C. Marsault J. Confalonieri F. de La Tour C.B. Duguet M. J. Biol.

Whereas the helicase domain displays DNA-dependent ATPase activity, neither reverse gyrase nor the isolated helicase domain shows any DNA strand displacement activity (10Declais A.C. Marsault J. Confalonieri F. de La Tour C.B. Duguet M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19498-19504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The hallmark reaction for reverse gyrase is the insertion of positive DNA supercoils concomitant with the hydrolysis of ATP (7Kikuchi A. Asai K. Nature. 1984; 309: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). With ADP, reverse gyrase can relax plasmid DNA, but leaving behind a low level of positive supercoils (12Hsieh T.S. Capp C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20467-20475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Using a plasmid DNA substrate, DNA supercoiling activities of reverse gyrase are inefficient, and require an excess amount of enzyme relative to DNA. Based on these results, we suggested a mechanism on how reverse gyrase could mediate these topological transformations in DNA. In this model, we propose that the affinity of reverse gyrase for either singlestranded or double-stranded DNA is affected by its binding to ATP or ADP. The switch of enzyme binding from single- to double-stranded DNA occurs after ATP hydrolysis, thus effectively promoting rewinding of single strands. This rewinding activity is further facilitated by its strand passage activity, allowing the enzyme to increase the linking number of DNA and to introduce positive supercoils. Because enzyme binding determines the magnitude of linking number changes, positive DNA supercoiling requires an excess amount of enzyme relative to DNA, and its extent depends on the stoichiometry of enzyme to DNA. We presented here our analysis of efficient strand passage activities of reverse gyrase with a substoichiometric amount of enzyme. Similar to all type IA topoisomerases, reverse gyrase can readily relax negatively supercoiled DNA. In contrast to the supercoiling reactions we analyzed before, supercoil relaxation is not exquisitely sensitive to the reaction temperature. This supercoil relaxation activity is only limited to the negatively supercoiled DNA for the plasmid DNA substrate. Interestingly, reverse gyrase can relax positively supercoiled DNA, provided there is a single-stranded bubble present in the DNA substrate. Therefore, similar to other type IA topoisomerases, the supercoil relaxation activity of reverse gyrase requires the presence of an unwound or underwound region in the DNA substrate. We also demonstrated here that reverse gyrase can mediate two distinct reactions involving strand annealing: annealing of complementary single-stranded circles and positive supercoiling of DNA with a single-stranded bubble. Using gel electrophoresis under both neutral and alkaline conditions, we showed that single-stranded circles can be readily joined and wound into a double-stranded circle in the presence of reverse gyrase. Because the linking number of two separate circles is zero, during the course of the annealing reaction, the enzyme must mediate enough strand passage events to allow for the formation of double-stranded helical structure. This strand passage and rewinding activity are most efficient with reverse gyrase in the presence of a nucleotide cofactor, especially ATP (see Fig. 3). Therefore, conditions that favor positive supercoiling also promote strand annealing, both of which result in an increase in DNA linking numbers. The positive supercoiling reaction with a bubble substrate is very efficient, capable of reaching a high level of supercoiling using a substoichiometric amount of enzyme. This result is in marked contrast with earlier ones using plasmid DNA substrate, for which only a moderate level of positive supercoiling was reached with an excess amount of enzyme. Because the single-stranded region in the bubble substrate is unable to form stable base pairs, it will likely remain unwound and continue to serve as a site for the rewinding action by reverse gyrase. Besides a single-stranded bubble, the AT-rich segment can also serve as an efficient substrate for the positive supercoiling reaction. This is presumably because of the melting of the AT sequence at the incubation temperature of 80 °C, providing a site for reverse gyrase reaction. The DNA supercoiling can affect helical stability, and positive supercoiling facilitates the rewinding of unwound region (18Hsieh T.S. Wang J.C. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 19Benham C.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 835-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Theoretical considerations have been developed to allow one to calculate the stability of the DNA segment with known base composition at a given superhelical density and temperature (19Benham C.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 835-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 22Bauer W.R. Ohtsubo H. Ohtsubo E. Benham C.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 438-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Precise calculations were not feasible for the system used in our experiments because some of the parameters used in this formulation are not available for the temperature range relevant in our experiments. However, it is possible that the positive supercoiling generated here can drive the rewinding of the AT-segment. A single-stranded bubble, unable to form base pairs, can also undergo plectonemic winding under positive supercoiling stress (19Benham C.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 835-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This rewinding action by reverse gyrase can thus effectively diminish or eliminate the junctions of the single-/double-stranded region. The strand annealing and positive supercoiling reactions described here support the mechanism we proposed for reverse gyrase: promotion of strand rewinding by a switch of binding affinity from single- to double-stranded DNA, and by the coupled strand passage activity. These reverse gyrase reactions may have important intracellular functions as well. From the proteomic analysis, reverse gyrase is the only hyperthermophile-specific protein (23Forterre P. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 236-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Its biological functions are likely involved in maintaining the genome stability under the extreme growth temperature. The reverse gyrase mutant displays significant growth defects at high temperature (24Atomi H. Matsumi R. Imanaka T. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4829-4833Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The winding of DNA strands by reverse gyrase, as demonstrated in the annealing of complementary single strand circles and positive supercoiling in bubble substrates, may be critical for its functions in the hyperthermophilic organisms. Reverse gyrase may thus serve as a “sentinel,” searching for unwound or bubble regions, and efficiently rewind the strands to reform DNA duplex. Future work on the biochemical basis of the differential affinity of reverse gyrase with DNA will be important for further understanding of its function and mechanism. We are grateful to Drs. Chapin Rodriguez and Paul Sadowski for a kind gift of the expression vector of reverse gyrase and Cre recombinase, respectively. We also thank Tammy Collins for helpful comments on the manuscript.

The addition of oxygen to ferrous gsNOS results in long-lived heme-oxy complexes in the presence (Soret peak 427 nm) and absence (Soret peak 413 nm) of substrates l-arginine and NOHA. The substrate-induced red shift correlates with hydrogen bonding between substrate and heme-bound oxygen resulting in conversion to a ferric heme-superoxy species. In single turnover experiments with NOHA, NO forms only in the presence of H4B. The crystal structure of gsNOS at 3.2 AÅ of resolution reveals great similarity to other known bacterial NOS structures, with the exception of differences in the distal heme pocket, close to the oxygen binding site. In particular, a Lys-356 (Bacillus subtilis NOS) to Arg-365 (gsNOS) substitution alters the conformation of a conserved Asp carboxylate, resulting in movement of an Ile residue toward the heme. Thus, a more constrained heme pocket may slow ligand dissociation and increase the lifetime of heme-bound oxygen to seconds at 4 °C. Similarly, the ferric-heme NO complex is also stabilized in gsNOS. The slow kinetics of gsNOS offer promise for studying downstream intermediates involved in substrate oxidation.

Interestingly, D. radiodurans NOS can support l-Arg-based NOx formation with cofactors other than H4B, such as the ubiquitous cofactor tetrahydrofolate and even tryptophan (11Adak S. Bilwes A.M.

The ability to react with l-tryptophan may be significant as NOSs from certain Streptomyces strains participate in biosynthetic tryptophan nitration (17Kers J.A. Wach M.J. Krasnoff S.B. Widom J.

The NOS reaction sequence is well understood (Fig. 1), although the nature of the heme-oxygen complexes directly involved in substrate oxidation remains largely unknown (18Stuehr D.J. Santolini J.

In both the l-arginine and NOHA reactions, reduction of the Fe(III) heme enables oxygen binding and formation of a heme-dioxygen complex, which is best described as a ferric superoxy species (Fe(III)-O2·¯) (1Rousseau D.L.

Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15503-15512Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), reduces the H4B+. radical. Reduction of the Fe(III)-O2·¯. species at cryogenic temperatures results in a ferric heme-peroxo species that rapidly reacts at higher temperatures with either l-arginine or NOHA to form products (35Davydov R. Ledbetter-Rogers A. Martasek P. Larukhin M. Sono M. Dawson J.H. Masters B.S. Hoffman B.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10375-10381Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Unlike heme-oxygenases such as cytochrome P-450 or heme oxygenase (36Davydov R. Makris T.M. Kofman V. Werst D.E. Sligar S.G. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 1403-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 37Davydov R. Kofman V. Fujii H. Yoshida T. Ikeda-Saito M. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 1798-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), a ferric heme-hydroperoxo species has not been observed in cryo annealing experiments. Bacterial NOSs retain NO in their heme pockets for longer times compared with their mammalian counterparts (38Wang Z.Q. Wei C.C. Sharma M. Pant K. Crane B.R. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19018-19025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In B. subtilis NOS (bsNOS), the release of NO is 20-fold slower than that in mammalian NOSs due to a bacterially conserved Val to Ile switch, which offers more steric hindrance for the heme-bound NO to diffuse away from the heme. An Ile to Val mutation in bsNOS increases the rate of NO release 3.6 times, and a Val to Ile mutation in mouse iNOSoxy decreases the rate of NO release by 3 times (38Wang Z.Q. Wei C.C. Sharma M. Pant K. Crane B.R. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19018-19025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, the NOS heme pocket can tune the reactivity of heme ligands. Otherwise unstable reaction intermediates of cytochromes P-450, another class of well studied heme-containing monooxygenases, have been observed at cryogenic temperatures after radiolytic reduction of the heme (39Denisov I.G.

Additionally, in cysteine-ligated heme proteins, such as P450cam and chloroperoxidase, rapid formation of Compound I ([Fe(IV)=O]+. heme/thiolate radical) and related species can be achieved on reaction with peracids (42Spolitak T.

In these cases Compound I (absorption peak ∼367 nm) forms in ∼10 ms after rapidly mixing 3-chloroperbenzoic acid with the ferric enzyme. Within 40 ms, this species converts to an inactive product with a peak ∼406 nm (42Spolitak T. Dawson J.H. Ballou D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20300-20309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In NOS, the heme-oxy species that react with l-arginine or NOHA have not been observed, although it is widely thought that the Compound I species is involved, in analogy to cytochrome P-450-type reactions (43Egawa T. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 201: 1464-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 44Kellner D.G. Hung S.C. Weiss K.E. Sligar S.G. J. Biol.

Thermophilic prokaryotes can be exploited as a source of thermostable enzymes that have slow reaction profiles at temperatures below 25 °C (44Kellner D.G. Hung S.C. Weiss K.E. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9641-9644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). With this motivation, we have cloned, expressed, and characterized a thermophilic nitric-oxide synthase like protein from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (gsNOS). Herein, we characterize biophysical and biochemical properties of gsNOS and demonstrate its enhanced thermostability and slower reaction kinetics compared with other bacterial NOSs. We also show that the N-terminal extension contributes to this thermal stability. The most striking property of gsNOS is that it forms a stable heme-oxygen complex that persists on the timescale of seconds at 4 °C. The crystal structure of gsNOS at 3.2 Å of resolution reveals very high similarity to the structure of bsNOS and provides insight into the slower reactivity of gsNOS. Materials and Methods—Dioxane and sodium chloride were obtained from Mallinckrodt, (±)2-methyl-2,4-pentane diol from Hampton Research and Tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane from Fisher. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich unless otherwise noted. All UV-visible spectra and kinetic data were recorded using an Agilent 8453 UV-visible spectroscopy system. Single-value decomposition (SVD) analysis was done using the program SPECFIT (47Gampp H. Maeder M. Meyer C.J. Zuberbuhler A.D.

Molecular Biology—The NOS gene of G. stearothermophilus (ATCC strain number 12980) was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA. The 5′ primer generated an NdeI site before the start codon, and the 3′ primer generated an XhoI site after the stop codon. The amplified fragment was cloned into the pET28 expression vector (Novagen) and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. Protein Expression and Purification—The full-length NOS (gsNOS) and a shorter construct with the first 13 residues removed from the N terminus (gsNOS+13) were overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells with a His6 tag. The proteins were purified using nickel-chelate chromatography and then size-exclusion chromatography after removal of the His6 tag with thrombin. Both the constructs could be concentrated to ∼100 mg/ml, as estimated by the Bradford assay. Crystallization— gsNOS produced orthorhombic crystals of dimensions 200-400 μm in 24-48 h at 22 °C when grown by vapor diffusion from 45-50 mg/ml of protein in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, mixed with freshly dissolved 1-2 mm l-arginine and 1-2 mm l-tryptophan (Trp). Trp was added to help stabilize the pterin-binding site due to evidence that it will bind there in the D. radiodurans NOS (16Buddha M.R. Tao T. Parry R.J. Crane B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49567-49570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The reservoir was mixed a 1:1 with protein solution and contained 40-46% dioxane and 10% (±)2-methyl-2,4-pentane diol. gsNOS crystals were of space group P21212 with cell dimensions 154.0 Å × 118.7 Å × 49.8 Å. The crystals contained two NOS subunits per asymmetric unit. Structure Determination—Diffraction data were collected at 100 K with synchrotron radiation (λ = 1.002 Å) on beamline X-25 of the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The data sets were reduced and scaled using HKL2000 (51Otwinowski A. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (38570) Google Scholar). Initial phases were determined by molecular replacement (AmoRe) (52Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar) with the structure of NOS from B. subtilis as the probe (PDB entry 1M7V). The model was then refined in CNS (53Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16966) Google Scholar) using standard positional and thermal factor refinement, and the structure was adjusted with XFIT to Fobs-Fcalc and 2Fobs-Fcalc maps. The addition of l-arginine, heme, and water molecules amidst cycles of refinement produced the final model. Nitrite Formation with Peroxide—30-50 μm enzyme was incubated at different temperatures with 1 mm l-arginine and 20 mm H2O2, and the reaction was stopped at different times by adding Griess reagents R1 (sulfanilamide) and R2 (N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine). The product (pink dye) formation was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 540 nm. The amount of nitrite generated in the solution was calculated using the Griess assay kit from Cayman Chemicals. Each activity reported represents an average from at least three experiments. Single Turnover Experiments—Concentrated full-length gsNOS was cycled through a degassing chamber and left in an anaerobic glove box for ∼30 min. All buffer solutions were extensively degassed and placed under argon. Degassed buffer solution was used to dilute the protein solution suitably for UV-visible spectroscopy. To observe the spectral changes the enzyme undergoes during reaction with oxygen, gsNOS (13 μm) was reduced by titration with sodium dithionite (30-50 μm). The cuvette containing reduced gsNOS (13 μm) was sealed using a rubber septum inside the glove box and then transferred to a UV-visible spectrophotometer. The temperature of the cell with the sample in the UV-visible spectrophotometer was lowered to 4 °C. Nitrogen gas was blown around the cuvette to prevent water condensation due to lowered temperature. Ice-cold air saturated buffer was injected into the cuvette through the rubber septum to start the reaction, at which point the sample contained ∼8 μm gsNOS, ∼20-30 μm dithionite, and ∼160 μm oxygen (54Weiss R. Deep Sea Res. A. 1970; 17: 721-735Google Scholar). The solutions were mixed rapidly using a magnetic stir bar in the cuvette. gsNOS was PCR cloned and expressed with a His6 affinity tag in E. coli. The protein has 65% sequence identity when compared with the NOS protein from the related mesophile B. subtilis (Supplemental Fig. 1). After nickel nitrilotriacetic acid affinity purification and proteolytic cleavage of the His tag, gsNOS (∼43 kDa/subunit) elutes on a gel filtration column as a dimer (apparent molecular mass ∼86 kDa). The UV-visible spectra of free gsNOS (absorption maxima at 403 and 519 nm), imidazole-bound enzyme (427 and 553 nm), l-arginine-bound enzyme (399 and 517 nm), and reduced enzyme with l-arginine bound (415 and 552 nm) (Fig. 2) are very similar to those of mammalian and other bacterial NOS oxygenase domains (1Rousseau D.L.

Shifts in the Soret peak indicate that the heme coordinates imidazole (427 nm) and can be displaced by l-arginine (Fig. 2). gsNOS shows high thermal stability. Molar ellipticity measurements (θ222) of NOS dimers indicate irreversible loss of secondary structure with increasing temperature (Fig. 3). We define the melting temperature as that at which half of the ellipticity (θ222) is lost as the temperature is raised. Whereas bsNOS melts at 60 °C, full-length gsNOS melts at 80 °C. gsNOS+13, in which an N-terminal amino acid extension has been removed, melts at an intermediate temperature of 66 °C (Fig. 3). In all cases, loss of secondary structure, as evidenced by CD, is irreversible. Activity of gsNOS and bsNOS were compared at different temperatures by evaluating the rate of nitrite produced from substrate l-arginine in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (Table 1). The amount of nitrite formed was quantitated by the Griess reaction (11Adak S. Bilwes A.M. Panda K. Hosfield D. Aulak K.S. McDonald J.F. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Crane B.R. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) at 25 °C after incubation of the l-arginine-saturated enzyme with peroxide at various temperatures and times. Product formation was linear with time. We followed the conversion of l-arginine rather than NOHA to NOx because NOHA breakdown at elevated temperatures resulted in significant background product formation. At increased temperatures, gsNOS gives a lower rate of product formation than bsNOS. At 50 °C, the bsNOS activity deviates greatly from that of gsNOS, which increases gradually with temperature. At temperatures above 50 °C, bsNOS denatures and precipitates. gsNOS reactions with peroxide and NOHA instead of l-arginine give ∼2 times more nitrite formation at room temperature.TABLE 1Rate constants of nitrite production by NOSs from various sources as a function of temperaturekcatTemperatureNO2− productionNO2− + NO3− production, nNOSbRef. 27.gsNOSbsNOSdeiNOSaRef. 16.°Cheme−1min−1 × 100heme−1min−1 × 100heme−1min−1 × 100heme−1min−1 × 100252.6 ± 0.14.6 ± 0.17.5 ± 0.528 ± 3353.6 ± 0.213.3 ± 0.35010.3 ± 0.150.3 ± 1.1a Ref. 16Buddha M.R.

Open table in a new tab Substrate-free gsNOS—In the absence of any substrate, the spectrum recorded ∼5 s after the introduction of oxygen showed a red-shifted Soret peak at 413 nm (Fig. 4), and the line shape was considerably different than substrate-free reduced gsNOS, which has a Soret peak at 411 nm and a broad shoulder from 440 to 490 nm (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the extinction coefficient for the Soret band of the intermediate is less than that of both the ferric- and ferrous-free enzyme. The 413 species was stable for ∼1 min at 4 °C and slowly decayed back to the ferric form (403 nm) with a change in line shape. Conversion to the ferric form of the enzyme was not complete even after 3 min at 4 °C and required increasing the temperature of the cell to 25 °C. Because the new 413 species results from mixing air-saturated buffer with the reduced protein, it likely represents the Fe(II)-O2 complex; although given the limited time resolution, the initial spectrum observed on the addition of oxygen could include some contribution from free ferric enzyme. Nevertheless, combination of spectra from the substrate-free ferric and ferrous forms cannot explain the optical features of the intermediate observed in the presence of oxygen. When the same reaction was carried out in the presence of 40 μm H4B, which is known to accelerate the decay of the ferrous-oxy species in mammalian and bacterial NOSs (21Bec N. Gorren A.C. Voelker C.

Characterization of the structure and mechanisms of action of natural inhibitors of cysteine peptidases (CPs) 2The abbreviations used are: CP, cysteine peptidase; ICP, inhibitor of cysteine peptidase; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; RMSD, root mean square deviation; NRMSD, normalized RMSD. 2The abbreviations used are: CP, cysteine peptidase; ICP, inhibitor of cysteine peptidase; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; RMSD, root mean square deviation; NRMSD, normalized RMSD. has provided important insights into the functional roles of the inhibitors themselves and also those of the target CPs. CP inhibitors occur widely in nature, and several distinct groups with unrelated primary structures are recognized (1Rawlings N.D. Tolle D.P. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 705-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Members of the cystatin superfamily (clan IH, family I25 (2Rawlings N.D. Tolle D.P. Barrett A.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 160-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) have been extensively characterized at the molecular level (3Bode W. Engh R. Musil D. Thiele U. Huber R. Karshikov A. Brzin J.

Biol. 2003; 326: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). A second group of natural CP inhibitors, assigned to clan IX, family I31, are similar to cystatin in inhibiting CPs of clan CA, family C1, such as papain, but are distinguished by the presence of a thyroglobulin type I domain (6Guncar G. Pungercic G. Klemencic I. Turk V. Turk D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 793-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The recently discovered chagasin family of CP inhibitors, designated ICP for inhibitor of cysteine peptidases (clan I-, family I42), also inhibit papain-like CPs and yet have no significant sequence identity with the other groups of CP inhibitors (7Monteiro A.C.S. Abrahamson M. Lima A.P.C.A. Vannier-Santos M.A. Scharfstein J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3933-3942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This raises the intriguing question: have the different groups of CP inhibitors evolved related tertiary structures to interact with the same target CPs in a similar fashion, as predicted from in silico analysis by Rigden et al. (8Rigden D.J. Mosolov V.V. Galperin M.Y. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1971-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), or does ICP act in a different way? ICP family members appear to occur in species from a very limited phylogenetic range (some parasitic protozoa, bacteria (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and Archaea, but no metazoa), suggesting that the genes have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer or retained for some special function. Although there is good evidence that the in vivo target for ICPs are clan CA, family C1 CPs, it remains uncertain whether the main function of the inhibitors is to modulate the activity of enzymes of the parasite itself (as is suggested for protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (9Santos C.C. Sant'Anna C. Terres A. Cunha-e-Silva N. Scharfstein J. de Lima A. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 901-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar)) or the host (as suggested for the related parasite Leishmania (10Besteiro S. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 1224-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)). Interestingly, no clan CA, family C1 CPs appear to be present in the P. aeruginosa genome, which provides further support for the suggestion that one role of ICPs in pathogens might be to regulate host CP activity and so facilitate infection. This has been investigated with Leishmania by gene targeting to create parasite lines that either lack or overexpress the ICP gene (10Besteiro S. Coombs G.H. Mottram J.C. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 1224-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). ICP null mutants grow normally axenically in vitro and are as infective to macrophages in vitro as wild type parasites. However, they have reduced infectivity to mice. Lines that overexpress ICP also show markedly reduced virulence in vivo. Thus, ICP may be important after it is released in the interaction of the parasite with its mammalian host or as a mechanism of preventing damage from host CPs taken up by the parasite through endocytosis (e.g. from the parasitophorous vacuole, which contains host lysosomal enzymes). The ICP proteins are small (∼13 kDa) and very divergent, with L. mexicana ICP having only 31% identity with ICP of T. cruzi and 24% identity with ICP of P. aeruginosa (11Sanderson S.J. Westrop G.D. Scharfstein J. Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H. FEBS Lett. 2003; 542: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, there are highly conserved motifs that suggest important functional regions. This has facilitated the identification of predicted ICPs from genome data and recombinant ICPs have been produced from the L. mexicana, T. brucei, Entamoeba histolytica, and P. aeruginosa genes and confirmed to have potent inhibitory activity toward CPs, notably cathepsin L homologues (7Monteiro A.C.S. Abrahamson M. Lima A.P.C.A. Vannier-Santos M.A. Scharfstein J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3933-3942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Sanderson S.J. Westrop G.D. Scharfstein J. Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H.

FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 1573-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) To date, the structural basis of the inhibitory activity of ICP is unknown. Previous threading studies have suggested that the binding site of T. cruzi ICP may be located on the loops between β-strands in a fold that resembles immunoglobulin light chain variable domains (8Rigden D.J. Mosolov V.V. Galperin M.Y. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1971-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Rigden D.J. Monteiro A.C.S. De Sá M.F.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Another study drew parallels between the sequence conservation in predicted loops of the ICP family and the peptidase-binding regions of the cystatin family (12Riekenberg S. Witjes B. Saric M. Bruchhaus I. Scholze H. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 1573-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We have now determined the structure of L. mexicana ICP in solution by NMR spectroscopy, confirmed residues key for its inhibitory activity using site-directed mutagenesis, and investigated how the key residues may bind to the model clan CA, family C1 peptidase papain, and an important L. mexicana CP, known as CPB (14Sanderson S.J. Pollock K.G. Hilley J.D. Meldal M. St. Hilaire P.M. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Protein Production—Recombinant L. mexicana ICP was expressed from a pET28 (Novagen)-derived plasmid in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells as described previously (11Sanderson S.J. Westrop G.D. Scharfstein J. Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H. FEBS Lett. 2003; 542: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). 15N,13C-labeled protein was produced by growing the cells in M9 medium using 15NH4Cl and [13C]glucose (Spectra Stable Isotopes) as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources. The fusion protein was purified by nickel chelate chromatography and digested with thrombin (Novagen). The cleaved histidine tag and thrombin were removed by nickel chelate and benzamidine-Sepharose (Sigma) affinity chromatography. The protein comprising the complete native sequence (Q868H1 3UniProt number. ;CAD68975) with the addition of three residues (GSH) at the N terminus (designated ICP-(-2-113)) was buffer-exchanged into 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 4.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.001% NaN3 by extensive diafiltration using a 5,000 MWCO centrifugal concentrator (Vivascience) and concentrated to ∼1 mm. D2O was added to a final concentration of 10% (v/v). NMR samples of L. mexicana ICP-(-2-113) underwent proteolysis over 2-3 days under NMR sample conditions to produce an N-terminally truncated protein starting at residue serine 6 (ICP-(6-113)) as confirmed by mass spectrometry, which then remained stable. No difference in Ki for L. mexicana CPB could be detected between ICP-(-2-113) and ICP-(6-113). Interaction studies were carried out using papain from Papaya latex (Sigma) and L. mexicana CPB2.8Δ CTE, produced as described previously (14Sanderson S.J. Pollock K.G. Hilley J.D. Meldal M. St. Hilaire P.M. Juliano M.A. Juliano L. Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In each case, peptidase was mixed with an excess of 15N-labeled ICP in NMR sample buffer, and the complex was isolated by gel filtration on a Superdex 75 HR10/30 column (APBiotech) and then concentrated using a 10,000 MWCO centrifugal concentrator. NMR Spectroscopy and Data Analysis—Resonance assignments were determined using standard triple resonance NMR techniques and have been deposited as described (15Smith B.O. Westrop G.D. Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H. J. Biomol. NMR. 2005; (in press)Google Scholar). Distance restraints for structure calculation were derived from three-dimensional 15N and 13C HSQC-NOESY spectra recorded with 100 ms mixing times recorded on an 800 MHz Bruker Avance spectrometer. Slowly exchanging amide protons were identified by redissolving a lyophilized sample in D2O and recording a series of 15N HSQC spectra. Spectra were processed with AZARA 4Available at www.bio.cam.ac.uk/azara. and analyzed using CCPN analysis (16Vranken W.F. Boucher W. Stevens T.J. Fogh R.H. Pajon A. Llinas P. Ulrich E.L. Markley J.L.

Structures were generated from random atomic coordinates following the scheme of the rand, dgsa, and refine scripts from the XPLOR 3.1 manual (20Brunger A.T. X-PLOR 3.1.

Distance restraints representing hydrogen bonds were incorporated for slowly exchanging amides where corroborating NOEs existed and an acceptor atom could be unambiguously identified.

Open table in a new tab 15N Relaxation Measurements—Protein dynamics were probed through 15N relaxation measurements of the backbone amide groups. 15N T1, T2, and 1H, 15N-heteronuclear NOE experiments were recorded at 600.13MHz (1H), and the data were analyzed according to the Lipari-Szabo model-free formalism using the programs curvefit and modelfree (23Mandel A.M. Akke M. Palmer A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 144-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). Docking—Data-driven molecular docking was carried out using HADDOCK v1.3 (24Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M.J.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar) using the default parameters and using chemical shift perturbation data as input. In the HADDOCK terminology, the “active” ICP residues are those whose backbone or side-chain amide chemical shifts are significantly perturbed in the complex with papain and which are surface-exposed. The “passive” ICP residues are their immediate, surface-exposed, neighbors. In the absence of chemical shift perturbation data for the peptidase, and given the superficial similarity between the ICP and stefin B structures, the “active” papain residues were defined as those residues in close contact with stefin B in the crystal structure of the stefin B·papain complex. The passive papain residues are their immediate, surface-exposed neighbors. “Semiflexible” regions are defined to be two residues either side of the active and passive residues in the primary sequences of both proteins. The ICP D-E loop was made “fully flexible” to reflect its high mobility in unbound ICP. Mutations—Mutations of L. mexicana ICP were incorporated into the expression vector using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the following pairs of complementary primers (mutated sites in lowercase): NT300, CCCGACCACTGGAgcCATGTGGACGCGC and NT301, GCGCGTCCACATGgcTCCAGTGGTCGGG to generate pBP191 (encoding Y34A); NT282, CATCCTCGACTCCTgacGacGGAGaTGGTGGCATCTAC and NT283, GTAGATGCCACCAtCTCCgtCgtcAGGAGTCGAGGATG to generate pBP193 (encoding M64D, V68D, V70D); NT298, CCTCGACTCCTATGGTGccAGTTccTcccATCTACGTTGTGCTCG and NT299, CGAGCACAACGTAGATgggAggAACTggCACCATAGGAGTCGAGG to generate pBP194, (encoding G69P, G71P, G72P); NT284, CTGGTCTACACGgcCCCCgcCGAGGGCATCAAGC and NT285, GCTTGATGCCCTCGgcGGGGgcCGTGTAGACCAG to generate pBP197, (encoding R94A, F96A); NT280, GAAGGGCAACCCGggCggTGGATACATGTGGACG and NT281, CGTCCACATGTATCCAccGccCGGGTTGCCCTTC to generate pBP199 (encoding T31,T32G). The mutated plasmids were verified by nucleotide sequencing. Ki Determinations—Kis for L. mexicana ICP and its mutants against L. mexicana CPB2.8Δ CTE were determined essentially as described previously (11Sanderson S.J. Westrop G.D. Scharfstein J. Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H. FEBS Lett. 2003; 542: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In summary, concentrations of ICP stock solutions were determined by titration against a known concentration of CPB2.8Δ CTE in a colorimetric assay using N-benzoyl-PFR-p-nitroanilide hydrochloride (Sigma) as a substrate under pseudoirreversible conditions. For mutants with a detectable inhibitor activity, IC50s were determined in a fluorometric assay using 10 μm benzyloxycarbonyl-FR-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin hydrochloride (ZFR-AMC, Sigma) as a substrate and Kis calculated using the relationship Ki = IC50(1/(1 + [S]/Km) where Km = 0.7 μm (25Alves L.C.

Circular Dichroism—Near (250-320 nm) and far (190-240 nm) UV CD analyses were performed with 0.6 mg/ml protein in 0.5 and 0.02 cm path length quartz cells, respectively, using a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter. Eight scans were collected for each protein using a bandwidth of 1.0 nm, a scanning speed of 50 nm min-1 and a response time of 0.25 s. Data were corrected for cell path length and protein concentration and smoothed using the Savitsky-Golay algorithm (convolution width 9.0). The secondary structure analyses of wild type and mutant proteins were obtained using the CDSSTR method (26Manavalan P. Johnson W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) available from the Dichroweb website, at the University of Birkbeck. All three proteins gave similar secondary structure estimates with low NRMSD values (∼0.025). ICP Adopts an Immunoglobulin Fold—In solution, ICP adopts an immunoglobulin-like (Ig) fold with seven β-strands (Fig. 1). One β-sheet is formed by anti-parallel strands B, E, and D, whereas the other is formed by anti-parallel strands G, F, and C with strand A parallel to strand G. A search for structural homologues using the DALI server (27Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3545) Google Scholar) identified the N-terminal Ig domain from α-dystroglycan (PDB:1u2c (28Bozic D. Sciandra F. Lamba D. Brancaccio A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44812-44816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)) as the closest match with a Z-score of 5.1 and an RMSD of 3.2 Å over 82 residues. The SCOP data base (29Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5542) Google Scholar) classifies this as a cadherin-like superfamily fold, which also closely resembles the I-set immunoglobulin-like fold (30Harpaz Y. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 31Halaby D.M. Poupon A. Mornon J.P. Protein Eng. 1999; 12: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The β-sheets enclose a well packed core of principally hydrophobic residues that correspond to the alternating pattern of conserved residues along the strands (see Fig. 2). The C-D loop of ICP folds back on strand C with a number of hydrophobic side-chains making contacts that are not part of the main core of the molecule. These interactions involving residues Met-35, Thr-37, Val-39, Val-42, Val-91, Thr-93, Pro-95, and Ile-99 serve to pin the F-G loop back to the outer face of one β-sheet. The prediction of the ICP family structure based on threading (13Rigden D.J. Monteiro A.C.S. De Sá M.F.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) correctly identified the Ig-like fold, but the details of the predicted strands and loops were out of register after the C-D loop, possibly because of the misidentification of the hydrophobic residues in the C-D loop as representative of an extended C strand. The three highly conserved groups of residues previously noted (8Rigden D.J. Mosolov V.V. Galperin M.Y. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1971-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 11Sanderson S.J. Westrop G.D. Scharfstein J. Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H. FEBS Lett. 2003; 542: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 12Riekenberg S. Witjes B. Saric M. Bruchhaus I. Scholze H. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 1573-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) are all located in loops at one end of the molecule (Fig. 1B). The GNPTTGY motif lies in the B-C loop, the GXGG motif lies in the highly mobile D-E loop and the RPW/F motif in the F-G loop. The co-location of all three motifs, and the finding that none of the residues appear to have roles that are key to the integrity of the fold of the protein, suggests that they together form the CP-binding site. Residues 30-32 in the B-C loop form a turn of 310-helix projecting the side chains of Asn-29, Thr-31, and Thr-32 toward the solvent. Gly-28 and Gly-33 allow the loop to be accommodated between the B and C strands by adopting conformations with positive φ dihedral angles. The conserved Tyr-34, which caps the main hydrophobic core of the protein, interacts with residues in the F-G loop, and contributes to the solvent-exposed surface at this end of the protein. Pinned back to the GFC β-sheet, the 11-amino acid F-G loop (residues 93-103) forms a broad saddle with residues 96-101 running roughly perpendicular to the direction of the β-strands. The side chain of conserved Arg-94 interacts with Tyr-34 and, along with Tyr-96, projects out of this end of the protein accompanied by Glu-97, Lys-100, and Glu-102. The D-E loop (residues 61-72) projects from this end of the protein on the other side of the B-C loop and is poorly defined by the experimental data. The D-E Loop Is Flexible—15N relaxation measurements were used to probe the backbone dynamics of ICP-(6-113). 15N NOE, 15N T1, and 15N T2 were measured at 60.8 MHz (15N), the derived order parameters and correlation times are shown in Fig. 2. The majority of the residues display uniform relaxation rates close to the average values typical of a compactly folded monomeric protein of this size, and their behavior could be modeled using either a single order parameter (S2) or S2 and an internal correlation time. The exceptions are the N terminus up to residue 13 and residues 61-72 in the D-E loop, which display depressed NOE values and lengthened T2 values. These residues were best modeled with two order parameters representing internal motion on distinct timescales and an internal correlation time of the order of a nanosecond. In addition, residue Asn-29, which could not be well fitted by any model, has a significantly shortened T2 value indicative of millisecond timescale chemical exchange, which may reflect backbone flexibility, or given the proximity of Tyr-92 may simply be because of the combination of local motion and the ring current shift from this aromatic side chain. The Conserved Motifs in the Loops Are Involved in CP Binding—Chemical shift perturbation mapping was used to identify the CP-binding site on ICP. Complexes of 15N-labeled ICP with L. mexicana CPB and with P. latex papain were purified, and their 15N HSQC spectra were compared with free ICP. A similar subset of backbone HN and side chain cross-peaks are perturbed from their free ICP chemical shifts in both complexes, and the most distinctive are shown in Fig. 3 for the papain complex. It is clear that all the most perturbed residues fall in the ranges 28-37 (covering the B-C loop), 59-74 (covering the D-E loop), and 94-104 (covering the F-G loop). Chemical shifts are sensitive to changes in chemical environment caused either by proximity to a ligand or by propagated structural changes. The co-location of all the significant changes in the vicinity of the three conserved loops strongly suggests that this is because of their involvement in binding to target CPs. Residues in the D-E Loop Are Critical for CP Binding—Based on our L. mexicana ICP structure and on sequence similarity between ICP family members, we made a limited number of mutant ICPs to test their effect on the inhibitory activity of ICP. In the highly conserved B-C loop, we mutated the pair of threonines to glycine (T31G,T32G) and mutated the conserved tyrosine at the base of the loop to alanine (Y34A). In the flexible D-E loop, we made two triple mutants, one to replace the semiconserved hydrophobic residues with charged residues (M67D,V68D,V70D) and the other to replace the glycines by more conformationally restricted residues (G69P,G71P,G72P). In the F-G loop, we made a double mutant of the conserved arginine and aromatic residues (R94A,F96A). The D-E loop mutants lacked inhibitory activity against L. mexicana CPB. To ensure that these mutants had retained their three-dimensional fold we analyzed them using CD spectroscopy. Wild type ICP and mutant M67D,V68D,V70D possess superimposable CD spectra in both the near and far UV regions indicating very similar, if not identical, secondary and tertiary structures. Mutant G69P,G71P,G72P gave rise to a slightly different far UV spectrum, while retaining similar spectral features in the near UV region, and CDSSTR analysis placed the regular secondary structure estimates within a few percent of the wild type ICP. Of the other mutants, the B-C loop mutations resulted in somewhat lower Kis, whereas the Ki of the F-G loop mutant was ∼3-fold higher (see Table 2).TABLE 2Ki values for L. mexicana ICP mutants against L. mexicana CPB ND, not determined.LoopKipML. mexicana ICP132.8 ± 21.1T31G, T32GB-C53.0 ± 8.3Y34AB-C46.4 ± 6.5M67D, V68D, V70DD-END, no inhibition observedG69P, G71P, G72PD-END, no inhibition observedR94A, F96AF-G428.5 ± 86.5 Open table in a new tab A Model for the Interaction between ICP and CPs—The identification of the three conserved loops as the CP-binding site prompted a comparison of the ICP structure with other CP inhibitors. A slight, but suggestive, structural similarity was detected with the cystatin, stefin B (see below), where the CP-binding site is formed by a short central loop flanked by a flexible N-terminal peptide and a longer flattened loop that incorporates a proline (see Fig. 4). We speculated that ICP might bind target CPs in a similar fashion with the flexible D-E loop binding in place of the N-terminal peptide of stefin B. To produce a model for the interaction between ICP and a CP, we used the chemical shift perturbation data for ICP in complex with papain, together with information from the crystal structure of the complex between papain and stefin B, to drive a docking simulation using HADDOCK (24Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M.J.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2087) Google Scholar). The input data dictated that ICP should bind into the active site of papain but did not, a priori, dictate that ICP should bind the peptidase in a stefin-like orientation. Of the 200 lowest energy structures from the HADDOCK run, all adopted a stefin-like mode of binding (Fig. 4) with residues 67-70 from the D-E loop filling the “unprimed” sites of the active site cleft, whereas the B-C loop approaches the active site cysteine-histidine pair, and side chains from residues in the F-G lo"
https://openalex.org/W2090087004,"The serum collectin mannan-binding lectin (MBL) binds to oligomannose and GlcNAc-terminating glycans present on microorganisms. Using a commercial affinity chromatography resin containing immobilized MBL we screened human and mouse serum for endogenous MBL-binding targets. We isolated the serum protease inhibitor α2 macroglobulin (α2M), a heavily glycosylated thiol ester protein (TEP) composed of four identical 180-kDa subunits, each of which has eight N-linked glycosylation sites. α2M has previously been reported to interact with MBL; however, the interaction was not characterized. We investigated the mechanism of formation of complexes between α2M and MBL and concluded that they form by the direct binding of oligomannose glycans Man5–7 occupying Asn-846 on α2M to the lectin domains (carbohydrate recognition domains) of MBL. The oligomannose glycans are accessible for lectin binding on both active α2M (thiol ester intact) and protease-cleaved α2M (thiol ester cleaved). We demonstrate that MBL is able to interact with α2M in the fluid phase, but the interaction does not inhibit the binding of MBL to mannan-coated surfaces. In addition to α2M, two other members of the TEP family, C3 and C4, which also contain oligomannose glycans, were captured from human serum using the MBL resin. MBL binding may be a conserved feature of the TEPs, dating from their ancestral origins. We suggest that the inhibition of proteases on the surface of microorganisms by an ancestral α2M-like TEP may generate “arrays” of oligomannose glycans to which MBL or other lectins can bind. Binding would lead to opsonization or activation of enzyme systems such as complement.

Each subunit has eight N-linked glycosylation sites located at Asn-32, Asn-47, Asn-224, Asn-373, Asn-387, Asn-846, Asn-968, and Asn-1401 (1Sottrup-Jensen L. Stepanik T.M. Kristensen T.

Chem. 1984; 259: 8318-8327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1), a total of 32 N-linked glycosylation sites per α2M tetramer. α2M is an evolutionarily ancient protease inhibitor, which circulates in human plasma at 1–2 mg/ml and is found in a wide range of species from arthropods to mammals (2van Leuven F. Torrekens S. Overbergh L. Lorent K. de Strooper B. van den Berghe H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). There are two regions of major functional importance, a “bait region,” which contains multiple cleavage sites for many different proteases (Fig. 1), and a second region, a reactive thiol ester (Fig. 1) also found in the complement components C3 and C4. α2M inhibits active proteases via a “trap mechanism” (3Barrett A.J. Starkey P.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 709-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar, 4Gonias S.L. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14682-14685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where cleavage of the “bait” region by the active protease triggers a conformational change in α2M (5Arakawa H. Nishigai M. Ikai A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2350-2356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) forming a cage-like structure around the protease. During the refolding, the protease or other “bystander” molecules (6Chu C.T. Rubenstein D.S. Enghild J.J. Pizzo S.V. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1551-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) may become covalently bound via the thiol ester (7Harpel P.C. Brower M.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1983; 421: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The covalent binding, however, is not essential for protease inhibition (8Travis J. Salvesen G.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 655-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar). The entrapped protease is inhibited in its action on high molecular weight protein substrates, which can no longer access the cage. In contrast low molecular weight (synthetic) substrates (esters and amides) can enter the cage and still be hydrolyzed by the trapped protease (3Barrett A.J. Starkey P.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 709-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar, 5Arakawa H. Nishigai M. Ikai A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2350-2356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The thiol ester can also be cleaved in α2M, as in C4 and C3, by spontaneous hydrolysis or can react with low molecular weight nucleophiles such as NH3. This reaction converts α2M to the “dead” (thiol ester cleaved) form, which, although it has not been cleaved by protease, undergoes a conformational change (9Qazi U. Gettins P.G. Strickland D.K.

Chem. 1999; 274: 8137-8142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).MBL, also known as mannan/mannose-binding protein is a member of the collectin family of proteins (10Malhotra R. Haurum J. Thiel S. Sim R.B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1437-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), synthesized in the liver and secreted into the bloodstream. Levels of MBL in human serum vary greatly between individuals (11Turner M.W. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 532-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar), from below 50 ng/ml to above 10 μg/ml. MBL has a structure and function similar to that of the complement protein C1q and consists of trimers of identical polypeptide chains, each containing a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and a collagen-like region. These trimers form higher order oligomers from dimers to hexamers, resembling a “bunch of tulips” in structure. MBL circulates bound to pro-enzymic MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs) and MAp19. Three MASPs have been characterized to date: MASP-1, MASP-2 (12Matsushita M. Fujita T. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1497-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 13Thiel S. Vorup-Jensen T.

Immunity. 2001; 15: 127-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). MAp19 is an alternatively spliced variant of MASP-2, which does not contain the serine protease domain (15Hajela K. Kojima M. Ambrus G. Wong K.H. Moffatt B.E. Ferluga J. Hajela S. Gal P. Sim R.B. Immunobiology. 2002; 205: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Binding of MBL to a target via its lectin domains leads to autocatalytic activation of the pro-MASPs. MBL can trigger the lectin pathway of complement activation (15Hajela K. Kojima M. Ambrus G. Wong K.H. Moffatt B.E. Ferluga J. Hajela S. Gal P. Sim R.B.

The biological roles of MASP-1 and MASP-3 have not been firmly established, although MASP-1 has thrombin-like activities, cleaving fibrinogen and activating Factor XIII, possibly implicating MASP-1 in localized coagulation (15Hajela K.

Gal P. Sim R.B. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 40: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Protease inhibition studies have shown that α2M inhibits activated MASP-1 with fast kinetics and reacts slowly with activated MASP-2 (17Presanis J.S. Hajela K. Ambrus G. Gal P. Sim R.B. Mol.

Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). This gives MBL affinity for mannose, fucose, and N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) (11Turner M.W. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 532-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). These sugar residues tend to be found on the surfaces of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi (22Holmskov U. Malhotra R. Sim R.B. Jensenius J.C. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 67-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). MBL binds to sugar residues via the CRDs (lectin) heads. The affinity of a single CRD for carbohydrate is very weak (10–3 m) (23Iobst S.T. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15512-15519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but multiple CRD binding generates a much greater avidity. For example, interaction of three CRDs in one subunit with mannan has a Kd of 2–3 × 10–8 m (24Holmskov U. Fischer P.B. Rothmann A. Hojrup P. FEBBS Lett. 1996; 393: 314-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). There are some human plasma proteins with which MBL does interact via oligomannose or GlcNAc terminating glycans such as has been described for specific glycoforms of IgG (IgG-G0) and IgM (25Malhotra R.

Fujita T. Matsuno K. Int. Immunol. 1995; 7: 1579-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and electron microscopy studies showing a complex between porcine MBL and α2M (28Storgaard P. Holm Nielsen E. Skriver E. Andersen O. Svehag S.E. Scand. J. Immunol. 1995; 42: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). α2M·MBL complexes have been detected in plasma (29Petersen S.V. Thiel S. Jensen L. Vorup-Jensen T. Koch C. Jensenius J.C. Mol. Immunol. 2000; 37: 803-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, the interaction has not been characterized, and it has not been determined whether α2M is interacting with MBL or with the MASPs directly.We have characterized one major interaction between MBL and α2M as a lectin interaction. Analysis of the glycosylation of α2M from pooled human serum identified oligomannose glycans, occupying Asn-846. This study shows that the oligomannose glycans are accessible to MBL in both thiol ester-cleaved and thiol ester intact α2M conformations. The oligomannose glycans mediate Ca2+-dependent attachment of MBL to α2M.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESα2M Purification—The method was based on that of Salvesen and Enghild (30Salvesen G. Enghild J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 223: 121-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Chelating Sepharose 6B (Amersham Biosciences, 5 ml) was washed with 50 ml of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.0, then with 50 ml water, and then with 5 ml of ZnSO4 (0.3 g/100 ml), and finally with 5 ml of water. Citrated human plasma (20 ml) pooled from 20 or more donors (HDS Supplies, High Wycombe, UK) was dialyzed twice against 1.2 liters of water at 4 °C. The plasma was spun at 3,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was applied to the Zn2+-loaded Sepharose chelate column. The column was washed with 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, until the A280 was below 0.01, and then washed with 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.0. The bound α2M was eluted with 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 5.0. The eluted material was then raised to pH 7.0 with 1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 1 mm Pefabloc-SC (Pentapharm Ltd., Basle, Switzerland) was added to inhibit trace proteases. The major contaminants were albumin and IgG (identified by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry analysis). These were removed by gel filtration. The α2M-containing fractions were pooled and run on a Superose 6 (HR 10/30) size-exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences, repetitive loading of 1 ml of 1 mg/ml), with the running buffer 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. Fractions containing α2M were pooled and judged by SDS-PAGE to be >95% pure (see supplemental Figs. S1–S3). The preparation was dialyzed into 10 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.4.Nucleophile Treatment of α2M—Nucleophiles such as ammonia can induce conformational change in α2M by cleaving the thiol ester (31Sheriff S.

The purified α2M (thiol ester intact) (10 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) was mixed 1:1 (v/v) with 0.2 m NH4HCO3, pH 8.9, and incubated for 2 h at 37°C, and the material was dialyzed back into 10 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.4.Thrombin Cleavage of α2M—Thrombin cleavage was carried out at a molar ratio of 1 α2M subunit to 2 molecules of human thrombin (Sigma-Aldrich, T6884), based on α2M subunit molecular mass of 180 kDa and a thrombin molecular mass of 37 kDa. The cleavage was carried out in 10 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, for 2 h at room temperature, and the cleaved α2M was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Cleavage was incomplete, suggesting that the thrombin was only partially active (see supplemental material).Autolytic Cleavage of α2M—α2M was identified as being “live” with an intact thiol ester by analyzing autolytic cleavage. Autolytic cleavage occurs on denaturation of α2M and requires the thiol ester to be intact before denaturation (33Sim R.B. Sim E. Biochem. J. 1981; 193: 129-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Treatment of the sample with nucleophilic agents (e.g. dithiothreitol) before denaturation cleaves the thiol ester and prevents autolytic cleavage. To prevent autolytic cleavage protein samples were resuspended in 10 μl of NuPAGE™ sample-reducing agent (10×, Invitrogen, NP0009) and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min before 10 μl of NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen, NP0008) was added, and the samples were incubated at 95 °C for 5 min. To enhance autolytic cleavage the protein samples were resuspended in 10 μl of NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen, NP0008) and incubated at 95 °C for 5 min, before 10 μl of NuPAGE™ sample reducing agent (10×, Invitrogen, NP0009) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 95 °C for a further 5 min. Samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE.MBL Purification—The purification was done by the method of Tan et al. (34Tan S.M. Chung M.C. Kon O.L. Thiel S. Lee S.H. Lu J. Biochem.

The running procedure was adapted from the directions of the manufacturer (www.piercenet.com) using buffers supplied by the manufacturer. The affinity column (5 ml) was pre-washed with 5 ml of ImmunoPure® MBP column preparation buffer (Tris, NaCl, sodium azide, EDTA, pH 7.4) at room temperature and then equilibrated with 20 ml of the ImmunoPure® IgM binding buffer (Tris, 1 m NaCl, CaCl2, and sodium azide, pH 7.4) at 4 °C. The MBL resin was used to capture proteins from serum of human and mouse. Citrated human plasma (HDS Supplies, High Wycombe, UK) was made 20 mm CaCl2 and left overnight at 4 °C to clot, and then the clot was filtered. Pooled mouse serum was obtained from Harlan Sera-Lab (Loughborough, UK). Mouse or human serum was diluted 1:1 with ImmunoPure® IgM binding buffer, and 0.5 ml was applied to the MBL resin and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The column was washed with ImmunoPure® IgM binding buffer until the A280 was <0.01. The bound protein was eluted using 15 ml of ImmunoPure® IgM elution buffer (Tris, 1 m NaCl, EDTA, and sodium azide, pH 7.4). Eluted material was run on SDS-PAGE, and protein bands were analyzed by mass spectrometry.Characterization of Binding of α2M to an Affinity Resin Containing Immobilized MBL—Purified α2M (50 μg) preparations were diluted 1:1 with ImmunoPure® IgM binding buffer, applied to the MBL resin at 4 °C, and allowed to enter the resin completely. A further 500 μl of ImmunoPure® IgM binding buffer was added and allowed to enter the resin. The column was then incubated at 4 °C for 30 min then washed with 20 ml of ImmunoPure® IgM binding buffer. Bound α2M was eluted at 4 °C with 20 ml of ImmunoPure® IgM elution buffer (Tris, 1 m NaCl, sodium azide, and EDTA, pH 7.4). The 20-ml elution and flow-through fractions were then split 50:50, and each half was incubated with 20 μl of StrataClean resin (Stratagene, Zuidoost, The Netherlands). Resin-bound protein samples were then prepared for SDS-PAGE analysis and analysis of autolytic cleavage as described above.Binding of MBL to Immobilized α2M—MBL binding was studied as described by Arnold et al. (35Arnold J.N. Radcliffe C.M. Wormald M.R. Royle L. Harvey D.J. Crispin M. Dwek R.A. Sim R.B. Rudd P.M. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 6831-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates (Nunc-Maxisorp) wells were coated with 100 μl of 10 μg/ml α2M (thiol ester intact) or nucleophile treated α2M (thiol ester cleaved). Mannan was used as a positive binding control, and BSA was used as a negative binding control, both at 10 μg/ml. All were diluted in 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 7, incubated in wells for 1 h at room temperature, then the wells blocked with 400 μl of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (8.2 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 139 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, pH 7.4) 0.1% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature, washed three times with 200 μl of wash buffer (10 mm HEPES, 1 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.4), and incubated in triplicate for 1 h at 37°C with 50 ng/well purified MBL diluted in 10 mm HEPES, 1 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4. Other wells were incubated with MBL diluted with 10 mm HEPES, 1 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4 as controls for non-calcium-dependent binding. The wells were washed three times with the wash buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 100 μl of 1/700 (v/v) anti-MBL polyclonal antiserum (35Arnold J.N. Radcliffe C.M. Wormald M.R.

The wells were washed and incubated 1 h, room temperature with 100 μl of a 1/2000 (v/v) dilution of monoclonal anti-rabbit IgG (γ-chain specific, Clone RG-96 alkaline phosphatase conjugate, Sigma-Aldrich, A-2556) in wash buffer and washed again, 100 μl of an AmpliQ, DakoCytomation (Cambridgeshire, UK) amplification kit reagent mixture was added, and the optical density was read at 492 nm after 30 min.Analytical Ultracentrifugation of MBL and α2M—Experiments were carried out in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorbance optics using an An60Ti rotor as previously described (36Wallis R. Drickamer K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The MBL and α2M (thiol ester intact) were dialyzed overnight against 50 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, at 4 °C. Samples (110 μl of total volume) were placed into sample cells and consisted of either 8 μg of MBL or 14 μg of α2M or both, diluted in dialysis buffer. The reference cells were loaded with 125 μl of dialysis buffer. Experiments were performed at 5,000 rpm at 20 °C. Equilibrium data were obtained at 280 nm in step scan mode using a separation of 0.001 cm and an average of 5 scans. Readings were taken at 6-h intervals until no difference could be detected between consecutive scans (equilibrium reached). At equilibrium, 3 scans were taken at 6-h intervals, which were averaged.Assay of MBL Binding to Mannan in the Presence of Excess α2M—MBL binding and detection was carried out by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay described above, using the wash/dilution buffer 10 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4. It was shown that 100 ng/well MBL did not saturate the mannan-coated well. Binding of MBL to the mannan was complete after 1 h but was detectable at 2-min incubation (data not shown). Serial dilutions of α2M and of BSA (as a negative control) from 2000-fold molar excess over MBL were incubated with 1 μg/ml MBL in 10 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4 for 1 h at 37°C (molarities calculated from 450-kDa MBL, 720-kDa α2M, and 66-kDa BSA). Then 100 μl of the mixtures was incubated on the mannan-coated wells for 2 min or 1 h at room temperature. α2M used was the thiol ester intact form. MBL, which had bound to the mannan, was detected as described above, developed using 100 μl of 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 0.2 m Tris buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, N-2770), and the absorbance values at 405 nm were recorded after 10 min.Release of N-Linked Glycans for Analysis—Human α2M (25 μgin10 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) was run on SDS-PAGE according to Küster et al.

Biochem. 1995; 230: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar), using a Ludger Tag™ 2AB glycan labeling kit (Ludger Ltd., Oxford, UK).Normal Phase-HPLC—Labeled glycans were separated on NP-HPLC as described by Guile et al. (40Guile G.R. Rudd P.M. Wing D.R. Prime S.B. Dwek R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 210-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Glycan profiles from NP-HPLC were calibrated against a dextran ladder prepared from hydrolyzed and 2AB-labeled glucose oligomers (41Royle L. Mattu T.S. Hart E. Langridge J.I. Merry A.H. Murphy N. Harvey D.J. Dwek R.A. Rudd P.M. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 304: 70-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Glycans were assigned glucose units (GU) values by fitting a fifth order polynomial distribution curve to the dextran ladder (glucoses 1–15). Glycan structure/composition was assigned using GU values and confirmed using exoglycosidase digestions.Exoglycosidase Digestions—Exoglycosidases were used to confirm the structures of glycans present in the preparations, in conjunction with NP-HPLC (38Radcliffe C.M.

The gel pieces were then soaked in 100 μl of 70% acetonitrile for a further 20 min, the supernatant was removed, and the gel pieces were dried in a Gyro-Vac (Howe, Oxon, UK) for 30 min. The gel pieces were rehydrated with 10 μl/gel piece with 20 ng/μl trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, T-6567) in 20 mm NH4CO3 and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. The peptides were removed from the gel with 50 μl of 50%(v/v) acetonitrile 0.1%(v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in water shaken for 10 min, the supernatant was extracted, and the step was repeated for a further 10 min. The supernatants were combined and dried in the SpeedVac. Mass spectrometry of the tryptic digested peptides was performed using the Ettan MALDI-ToF Pro according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSCapture of α2M from Human and Mouse Serum Using Immobilized MBL—Serum was passed through an MBL-conjugated resin (Pierce) to screen for endogenous MBL-binding targets. The eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry (Fig. 2). The MBL resin bound α2M from both human and mouse serum (Fig. 2). The mouse α2M on reducing SDS-PAGE gave a fragmentation pattern of 16"
https://openalex.org/W1980180618,"The IkappaB kinase (IKK) complex consists of the catalytic subunits IKKalpha and IKKbeta and a regulatory subunit, IKKgamma/NEMO. Even though IKKalpha and IKKbeta share significant sequence similarity, they have distinct biological roles. It has been demonstrated that IKKs are involved in regulating the proliferation of both normal and tumor cells, although the mechanisms by which they function in this process remain to be better defined. In this study, we demonstrate that IKKalpha, but not IKKbeta, is important for estrogen-induced cell cycle progression by regulating the transcription of the E2F1 gene as well as other E2F1-responsive genes, including thymidine kinase 1, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, cyclin E, and cdc25A. The role of IKKalpha in regulating E2F1 was not the result of reduced levels of cyclin D1, as overexpression of this gene could not overcome the effects of IKKalpha knock-down. Furthermore, estrogen treatment increased the association of endogenous IKKalpha and E2F1, and this interaction occurred on promoters bound by E2F1. IKKalpha also potentiated the ability of p300/CBP-associated factor to acetylate E2F1. Taken together, these data suggest a novel mechanism by which IKKalpha can influence estrogen-mediated cell cycle progression through its regulation of E2F1."
https://openalex.org/W2117271390,"The importance of interleukin 6 (IL-6)-related cytokines in cardiac homeostasis has been studied extensively; however, little is known about their biological significance in cardiac stem cells. Here we describe that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a member of IL-6-related cytokines, activated STAT3 and ERK1/2 in cardiac Sca-1+ stem cells. LIF stimulation resulted in the induction of endothelial cell-specific genes, including VE-cadherin, Flk-1, and CD31, whereas neither smooth muscle nor cardiac muscle marker genes such as GATA4, GATA6, Nkx-2.5, and calponin were up-regulated. Immunocytochemical examination showed that about 25% of total cells were positively stained with anti-CD31 antibody 14 days after LIF stimulation. Immunofluorescent microscopic analyses identified the Sca-1+ cells that were also positively stained with anti-von Willebrand factor antibody, indicating the differentiating process of Sca-1+ cells into the endothelial cells. IL-6, which did not activate STAT3 and ERK1/2, failed to induce the differentiation of cardiac stem cells into the endothelial cells. In cardiac stem cells, the transduction with dominant negative STAT3 abrogated the LIF-induced endothelial differentiation. And the inhibition of ERK1/2 with the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 also prevented the differentiation of Sca-1+ cells into endothelial cells. Thus, both STAT3 and ERK1/2 are required for LIF-mediated endothelial differentiation in cardiac stem cells.

Thus the importance of IL-6-related cytokines/gp130/STAT pathway has been established in cardiac myocytes; however, the possibility remains to be fully addressed that IL-6-related cytokines stimulate the non-myocyte population in the heart and contribute to cardiac homeostasis. Previously it was believed that cardiac myocytes exited from the cell cycle immediately after birth and regenerated only to a lesser extent. However, recently, cardiac stem cells have been identified in the myocardium and demonstrated to differentiate into cardiomyocytes. Thus far, two kinds of cardiac stem cells, c-kit+ cells (11Beltrami A.P. Barlucchi L. Torella D. Baker M. Limana F. Chimenti S. Kasahara H. Rota M. Musso E. Urbanek K. Leri A. Kajstura J.

It is demonstrated that c-kit+ cells differentiate into vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells, as well as cardiac myocytes, whereas Sca-1+ cells differentiate into osteoblasts or adipocytes. Despite the potential importance in the clinical application, the physiological signals responsible for the differentiation of the stem cells remain to be fully elucidated. In the present study, we examined the regulatory mechanisms for the endothelial differentiation of cardiac Sca-1+ cells. We then have demonstrated that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), an IL-6-related cytokine, promotes endothelial differentiation. Inhibition of STAT3 activity or ERK1/2 activity prevents endothelial differentiation, suggesting that both STAT3 and ERK play important roles in endothelial differentiation of cardiac stem cells. These data indicate that signals through gp130 could induce endothelial differentiation of cardiac stem cells as a potential source of endothelial cells.

The labeled cells were resuspended in IMag buffer, and the Sca-1+ cells were separated from the cell suspension by using IMagnet (BD IMag Cell Separation System, BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Flow cytometric analysis confirmed that the 97.6 ± 1.1% of the cells were Sca-1 positive cells, which is consistent with previous studies (12Oh H. Bradfute S.B. Gallardo T. Nakamura T. Gaussin V.

Newly isolated cardiac Sca-1+ cells were incubated in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% FBS overnight. To maintain multipotency of the differentiation, Sca-1+ cells were cultured in mNSCM (modified neural stem cell medium) consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F12 (ratio 1:1) supplemented with 5 mm HEPES, ITS (5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, and 5 ng/ml sodium selenite), 10 ng/ml bFGF, 20 ng/ml EGF, and 1000 units/ml LIF (11Beltrami A.P.

LIF was purchased from Chemicon International. IL-6, bFGF, and EGF were purchased from Peprotech EC (London, UK). U0126 (Cell signaling, MA), a highly selective inhibitor for MEK1/2, was used for the inhibition of ERK1/2. Immunoblot Analyses—Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (14Fujio Y. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16349-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were stimulated with IL-6-related cytokines for the indicated time. After being washed with ice-cold PBS twice, cell lysates were prepared by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, MA). The membrane was blocked with 2% skim milk and incubated with anti-phospho-STAT3, anti-phospho-ERK1/2, or anti-phospho-Akt (all from Cell Signaling) antibody as a first antibody. ECL system was used for detection. To quantify the extent of phosphorylation, the membranes were reprobed with anti-STAT3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling), or anti-Akt (Cell Signaling) antibody. The band intensities of phospho-proteins were normalized with those of total proteins. The activities of phospho-specific antibodies were confirmed by using the extract from cardiomyocytes stimulated LIF as a positive control. RT-PCR Analyses—RT-PCR was performed as described previously (6Fujio Y. Kunisada K. Hirota H. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Kishimoto T. J. Clin.

Cells were washed with Tris-buffered saline and incubated in 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium solution (BCIP/NBT, Sigma). After staining, positively stained cells were counted by a person who was blinded to the culture conditions. Immunofluorescent Examination—Immunofluorescent microscopic analyses were performed as described previously (16Fujio Y. Nguyen T. Wencker D. Kitsis R.N. Walsh K. Circulation. 2000; 101: 660-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature and stained with anti-Sca-1 (R&D Systems) and anti-von Willebrand factor antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Alexa Fluor 488- or 546-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) was used for detection. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst dye. Cells were examined by Olympus IX70. Adenovirus Vectors—Generation of the adenovirus vector expressing dominant negative STAT3 (dnSTAT3) was described previously (17Kunisada K. Tone E. Fujio Y. Matsui H. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Kishimoto T. Circulation. 1998; 98: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Adenovirus vector expressing β-galactosidase was used as a control. Adenovirus vectors were amplified in HEK293 cells and purified by CsCl ultracentrifugation (18Becker T.C. Noel R.J. Coats W.S. Gomez-Foix A.M. Alam T. Gerard R.D. Newgard C.B. Methods in Cell Biology. 43. Academic Press, New York1994: 161-189Google Scholar). Sca-1+ cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 100 for 12 h and cultured under the indicated conditions. By this method, more than 90% of Sca-1+ cells were transfected with adenovirus vectors (data not shown). Statistical Analysis—Statistical significance was determined by paired t test or Student's t test. Data were presented as mean ± S.E., and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. LIF Activates STAT3 and ERK1/2 in Cardiac Stem Cells—Signals through gp130 play important roles in cardiac homeostasis. Recently, cardiac stem cells have been reported to contribute to cardiac repair and regeneration (11Beltrami A.P. Barlucchi L. Torella D. Baker M. Limana F. Chimenti S. Kasahara H. Rota M. Musso E. Urbanek K. Leri A. Kajstura J. Nadal-Ginard B. Anversa P. Cell. 2003; 114: 763-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3008) Google Scholar, 12Oh H. Bradfute S.B. Gallardo T. Nakamura T. Gaussin V. Mishina Y. Pocius J. Michael L.H. Behringer R.R. Garry D.J. Entman M.L. Schneider M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12313-12318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether signals through gp130 are transduced in cardiac stem cells. Cardiac Sca-1+ cells were stimulated with LIF for the indicated time. Cell lysates were prepared, and activation of STAT3, ERK1/2, and Akt was analyzed by immunoblotting with phospho-specific antibodies (Fig. 1A). STAT3 and ERKs, but not Akt, were phosphorylated by LIF stimulation. STAT3 and ERKs were activated within 5 min of LIF stimulation (Fig. 1B). LIF Induces Endothelial Differentiation in Cardiac Stem Cells—We examined the effects of LIF on the differentiation of Sca-1+ cells. By RT-PCR (Fig. 2A), it was revealed that LIF induced VE-cadherin, Flk-1, and CD31, marker genes for endothelial cells, whereas Nkx-2.5 and calponin was not up-regulated by LIF. GATA4 and GATA6 were expressed in nonstimulated Sca-1+ cells, and their expression was not affected by LIF. LIF induced the expression of endothelial marker genes in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2, B and C). The endothelial markers were submaximally induced by 100units/ml LIF. Previously it was reported that cardiac c-kit+ stem cells could be maintained as undifferentiated cells in mNSCM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and Ham's F12 (ratio 1:1) containing bFGF, EGF, and LIF (11Beltrami A.P. Barlucchi L. Torella D. Baker M. Limana F. Chimenti S. Kasahara H. Rota M. Musso E. Urbanek K. Leri A. Kajstura J. Nadal-Ginard B. Anversa P. Cell. 2003; 114: 763-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3008) Google Scholar). Thus we analyzed the expression of the endothelial markers in Sca-1+ cells cultured in mNSCM. In mNSCM, cardiac Sca-1+ cell population did not express endothelial marker genes; however, cells were differentiated into endothelial cells when moved to the medium containing only LIF (Fig. 2D). The induction of endothelial marker genes was detected 7 days after stimulation, and afterward their expression increased. These data suggest that Sca-1+ cells can be maintained in the presence of bFGF, EGF, and LIF without impairing the potential for endothelial differentiation. In preliminary studies, we noticed that cardiac Sca-1+ cells occasionally showed expression of CD31, an endothelial marker, as described previously (12Oh H. Bradfute S.B. Gallardo T. Nakamura T. Gaussin V. Mishina Y. Pocius J. Michael L.H. Behringer R.R. Garry D.J. Entman M.L. Schneider M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12313-12318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar), when cultured in the presence of FBS more than 5 days and that FBS-mediated differentiation depended on the batches of FBS (data not shown). Therefore, in the present study, Sca-1+ cells were amplified in mNSCM. Sca-1+ cells cultured in mNSCM without LIF showed reduced potential for differentiation into endothelial cells, suggesting that LIF could contribute to maintenance of the potential for endothelial differentiation from Sca-1+ cells in the presence of bFGF and EGF (data not shown). To estimate the frequency of endothelial differentiation from Sca-1+ cell culture, cells were cultured in the presence or absence of LIF for the indicated time and stained with anti-CD31 antibody (Fig. 3A). At day 3, CD31+ cells were not observed either in the presence or absence of LIF. Cells positively stained with anti-CD31 antibody were detected 7 days after LIF stimulation. Thereafter, the frequency of CD31+ cells increased up to about 25% of total cells 14 days after LIF stimulation (Fig. 3B). In contrast, CD31+ cells were not significantly detected when the cells were cultured in the absence of LIF. We analyzed the effects of bFGF on LIF-induced endothelial differentiation because bFGF is also known to be a potent angiogenic growth factor, and it was found that co-stimulation with bFGF and LIF did not increase the number of CD31 positive cells, as compared with LIF stimulation (data not shown). The cardiac stem cells were cultured in the presence of LIF for 14 days and co-stained with anti-Sca-1 and anti-von Willebrand factor (vWF) antibodies (Fig. 4). Immunofluorescent microscopic analyses detected Sca-1+ cells that also showed positive staining for vWF, an endothelial marker, thus suggesting the transition from Sca-1+ cells to endothelial lineage. Both STAT3 and ERK1/2 Are Required for LIF-mediated Endothelial Differentiation—To analyze the signaling pathways involved in endothelial differentiation, we tested the effects of IL-6, which utilizes gp130 as one subunit of its receptor system. In contrast to LIF, IL-6 did not activate STAT3 or ERK1/2 in cardiac stem cells (Fig. 5A). Consistently, the endothelial cell-specific genes, including VE-cadherin, Flk-1, and CD31, were not increased in response to IL-6 (Fig. 5B). We also addressed the additional effects of IL-6 to LIF-mediated endothelial differentiation; however, endothelial differentiation, induced by LIF, was not enhanced by co-stimulation with IL-6 (Fig. 5C). Thus, further efforts were made to address the functional significance of STAT3 and ERK1/2. To examine whether STAT3 activity is involved in the endothelial differentiation of Sca-1+ cells by LIF, we analyzed the effects of the inhibition of STAT3 by using adenovirus vectors expressing dnSTAT3 (Fig. 6A). LIF failed to induce the endothelial markers in dnSTAT3-expressing cells, whereas endothelial marker genes were up-regulated in the cells adenovirally transfected with β-galactosidase, a control. Next, we tested the effects of U0126, an MEK inhibitor, on the endothelial differentiation of cardiac stem cells (Fig. 6B). The inhibition of ERK1/2 with U0126 inhibited the induction of endothelial marker genes by LIF. These data indicate that both STAT3 activity and ERK activity are required for the LIF-mediated differentiation of Sca-1+ cells into endothelial cells. We confirmed that neither transfection of dnSTAT3 nor treatment with U0126 increased the frequency of pyknotic nuclei as analyzed by Hoechst staining, suggesting that neither inhibition of STAT3 nor of ERK affected cell viability (data not shown). In the present study, we have demonstrated that LIF induced endothelial differentiation in cardiac stem cells. LIF stimulation rapidly activated STAT3 and ERK1/2 in cardiac stem cells. LIF up-regulated endothelial cell-specific genes without inducing either smooth muscle- or cardiac muscle-specific markers. The inhibition of STAT3 or ERK pathways abrogated endothelial differentiation, indicating that both STAT3 and ERKs are required for LIF-induced endothelial differentiation. Initially, it was believed that postnatal neovascularization results exclusively from fully differentiated endothelial cells. However, recent studies have established that bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells contribute to vessel formation (19Asahara T. Murohara T. Sullivan A. Silver M. Zee R. Li T. Witzenbichler B. Schatteman G. Isner J.M. Science. 1997; 275: 964-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (7761) Google Scholar). Endothelial progenitor cells circulate in the peripheral blood, home to the target organs, and differentiate into endothelial cells (20Kalka C. Masuda H. Takahashi T. Gordon R. Tepper O. Gravereaux E. Pieczek A. Iwaguro H. Hayashi S. Isner J.M. Asahara T. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1198-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). In the progenitor cells, VE-cadherin and Flk-1 are highly expressed, like fully differentiated endothelial cells. In contrast, by RT-PCR we have demonstrated that neither VE-cadherin nor Flk-1 is expressed in cardiac undifferentiated Sca-1+ cells, as reported previously (12Oh H. Bradfute S.B. Gallardo T. Nakamura T. Gaussin V. Mishina Y. Pocius J. Michael L.H. Behringer R.R. Garry D.J. Entman M.L. Schneider M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12313-12318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar, 13Matsuura K. Nagai T. Nishigaki N. Oyama T. Nishi J. Wada H. Sano M. Toko H. Akazawa H. Sato T. Nakaya H. Kasanuki H. Komuro I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11384-11391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Thus, cardiac Sca-1+ cells, used in the present study, are a population that is distinct from endothelial progenitors. Therefore it could be proposed that the cardiac Sca-1+ population is a novel source of endothelial cells in the heart. This proposal is supported by the recent findings that skeletal muscle-derived Sca-1+ cells are also differentiated into endothelial cells (21Tamaki T. Akatsuka A. Ando K. Nakamura Y. Matsuzawa H. Hotta T. Roy R.R. Edgerton V.R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), suggesting the possible involvement of tissue-resident stem cells in vessel formation. Cardiac Sca-1+ cells are known to be differentiated into cardiomyocytes (12Oh H. Bradfute S.B. Gallardo T. Nakamura T. Gaussin V. Mishina Y. Pocius J. Michael L.H. Behringer R.R. Garry D.J.

In the present study, we examined whether LIF induced cardiac differentiation. However, it was revealed that LIF stimulation up-regulated endothelial cell-specific genes without inducing smooth muscle or cardiomyocyte markers. In the process of in vivo neovascularization, differentiated endothelial cells migrate and form the capillary tubes. Therefore, we analyzed the migratory activities of LIF in cardiac Sca-1+ cells; however, we could not detect an LIF-mediated increase in cell motility (data not shown). Other factors might promote the cell motility, resulting in capillary tube formation in vivo. LIF-induced endothelial differentiation is reminiscent of the abnormality in the placenta of LIF receptor-null mice; LIF receptor-null mice exhibit a reduction of the fetal blood vessel component in the placenta (22Ware C.B. Horowitz M.C. Renshaw B.R. Hunt J.S. Liggitt D. Koblar S.A. Gliniak B.C. McKenna H.J. Papayannopoulou T. Thoma B. Cheng L. Donovan P.J. Peschon J.J. Bartlett P.F. Willis C.R. Wright B.D. Carpenter M.K. Davison B.L. Gearing D.P. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 1283-1299PubMed Google Scholar). It would be interesting to examine whether the tissue-resident stem cells from the peripheral organs, especially from the placenta, can be differentiated into endothelial cells by signals through gp130. Activation of gp130 results in the rapid induction of the target genes via STAT and ERK proteins after stimulation with IL-6-related cytokines (23Kishimoto T. Taga T. Akira S. Cell. 1994; 76: 253-262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar). Consistently, LIF rapidly activated STAT and ERK, whereas the up-regulation of endothelial cell-specific genes such as VE-cadherin, Flk-1, and CD31 was detected more than 24 h after LIF stimulation. Therefore it is unlikely that these endothelial cell-specific genes are direct targets of gp130-mediated transcriptional proteins, including STAT proteins. We examined the effects of LIF on the expression of HoxA9 gene as an early-stage endothelial marker (24Gorski D.H. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), because HoxA9 is rapidly induced by angiogenic stimuli such as shear stress and plays important roles in the expression of the endothelial genes in endothelial progenitor cells (25Rossig L. Urbich C. Bruhl T. Dernbach E. Heeschen C. Chavakis E. Sasaki K. Aicher D. Diehl F. Seeger F. Potente M. Aicher A. Zanetta L. Dejana E. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 1825-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, HoxA9 was not up-regulated immediately after LIF stimulation (data not shown). Thus it is suggested that cardiac stem cells are differentiated into endothelial cells by LIF through differential mechanisms from the endothelial progenitor cells. Further studies will be required to elucidate the direct target genes of the signals through gp130 in cardiac stem cells. The Gp130/STAT signaling pathway is activated under pathophysiological conditions in cardiac myocytes. IL-6-related cytokines are produced in cultured cardiomyocytes exposed to pathological stresses such as catecholamine, (26Funamoto M. Hishinuma S. Fujio Y. Matsuda Y. Kunisada K. Oh H. Negoro S.

Yamauchi-Takihara K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 436-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), leading to activation of the gp130/STAT3 pathway in the myocardium. In vivo studies also demonstrated that LIF is up-regulated in pathological hearts, including hypertrophied hearts (29Kurdi M. Randon J. Cerutti C. Bricca G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2005; 269: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and failing hearts (30Podewski E.K. Hilfiker-Kleiner D. Hilfiker A. Morawietz H. Lichtenberg A. Wollert K.C. Drexler H.

Cataliotti A. Chen H.H. Burnett J.C.J. Eur. J. Heart. Fail. 2003; 5: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), suggesting the importance of the paracrine system of IL-6-related cytokines. Previously we demonstrated that activation of STAT3 promotes vessel formation through paracrine of angiogenic factors in the heart (2Osugi T. Oshima Y. Fujio Y. Funamoto M. Yamashita A. Negoro S.

Here, in addition to the promotion of vessel growth through paracrine system, we propose that LIF-mediated activation of gp130 directly induces the endothelial differentiation of tissue-resident stem cells, suggesting a novel role of gp130 signaling in angiogenesis. These combined angiogenic properties may explain the prominent neovascularization induced by signals through gp130 during myocardial remodeling (3Zou Y. Takano H. Mizukami M. Akazawa H. Qin Y. Tako H. Sakamoto M. Minamino T. Nagai T. Komuro I. Circulation. 2003; 108: 748-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), although further efforts should be made to elucidate how much cardiac stem cells contribute to angiogenesis in vivo. In summary, the present study has revealed that signals through gp130 transduce endothelial differentiation in cardiac stem cells and that IL-6-related cytokines are the paracrine factors determining the commitment of cardiac stem cells into the endothelial cell lineage. These findings propose a novel mechanism by which signals through gp130 contribute to neovascularization in the process of tissue remodeling and/or regeneration.

J. 1998; 331: 793-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In addition, PDI serves as an obligatory β subunit of hetero-oligomeric prolyl 4-hydroxylase (8Pihlajaniemi T. Helaakoski T. Tasanen K. Myllyla R. Huhtala M.-L. Koivu J. Kivirriko K.I. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (9Wetterau J.R.

Helaakoski T. Notbohm H. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The four-domain architecture of PDI in the order a-b-b′-a′ was proposed when the PDI cDNA was first sequenced, according to the internal sequence homology within the molecule (11Edman J.C. Ellis L. Blacher R.W. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Nature. 1985; 317: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Later, the domain boundaries were defined (12Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) and further refined as shown in Scheme 1 by combined use of protein engineering, limited proteolysis, and bioinformatics (13Darby N.J.

Ruddock L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10374-10381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The a and a′ domains, each with a -CGHC-motif as the active site, share 47% sequence identity, whereas the b and b′ domains, with no such active site motif, share 28% sequence identity (11Edman J.C. Ellis L. Blacher R.W. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Nature. 1985; 317: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The C-terminal 29 residues, 463–491, constitute an acidic c extension (2Ellgaard L. Ruddock L.W. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), in which over half of the residues are Glu/Asp, and represent a putative Ca2+-binding region (12Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure determined by using NMR of the a domain, which shares 27% identity to thiroredoxin (Trx), shows a Trx-fold (15Kemmink J. Darby N.J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7684-7691Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and the b domain, which shows no significant sequence similarity to the a and Trx, also has a Trx-fold (14Kemmink J. Darby J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 239-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). PDI has thus been suggested to consist of four Trx-fold domains (14Kemmink J. Darby J. Dijkstra K. Nilges M. Creighton T.E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 239-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Recently, a 19-amino acid linker region, 333–351, was identified between the b′ and a′ domains (16Pirneskoski A. Klappa P. Lobell M. Williamson R.A. Byrne L. Alanen H.I. Salo K.E. Kivirikko K.I. Freedman R.B. Ruddock L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10374-10381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), which was suggested to potentially allow more flexibility between these domains than between the other domains. The three-dimensional structure of the entire PDI molecule, or of any other catalytically active eukaryotic PDI family member, has not yet been determined even though PDI was discovered over 40 years ago. PDI had long been considered to be a homodimeric molecule according to its molecular mass determined by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) (17Ohba H. Harano T. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 89: 889-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 18Tojo H. Asano T. Kato K. Udaka S. Horiuchi R. Kahinuma A. J. Biotechnol. 1994; 33: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Recently, by using analytical ultracentrifugation, it was reported that the dimeric 108-kDa species of PDI on SEC is actually a monomer, and PDI is a quite elongated molecule with an axial ratio of 5.7 (19Solovyov A. Gilbert H.F. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1902-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It was further suggested that the four reasonably globular Trx-fold domains are arranged in a linear fashion, and the anomalous molecular mass of PDI determined by SEC was ascribed to the elongated shape of the molecule. By cross-linking with homo-bifunctional alkylating agents of different lengths, the minimum distance between the two active-site reactive groups, separately located in the a and a′ domain, was determined to be only 16 Å (20Hawkins H.C. de Nardi M. Freedman R.B. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 341-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Many experimental data have shown that all four domains are required for PDI to exhibit the maximum catalytic activity (21Darby N.J. Penka E. Vincentelli R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and perform chaperone activity efficiently (22Sun X.X. Dai Y. Liu H.P. Chen S.M. Wang C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1481: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In contrast, the linear model would mean that there are few interactions between the domains. There are obvious contradictions in the molecular models of PDI in the published literature. Small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) has recently been proven to be a powerful tool for investigating the solution structure of biomacromolecules. This is partially due to a significant improvement in the ab initio methods for restoring the three-dimensional shape of a molecule from the observed one-dimensional scattering profile in a model-independent manner (23Svergun D.I. Volkov V.V. Kozin M.B. Stuhrmann H.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1996; 52: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 24Chacon P. Moran F. Diaz J.F. Pantos E. Andreu J.M. Biophys.

J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar, 26Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H.J. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar), i.e. no detailed structural data, such as crystal structure coordinates, are required. Here we report, for the first time, the determination of the low resolution structure of the entire PDI molecule in solution using the SAXS technique with an ab initio shape-determination program, DAMMIN (25Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). The results indicate that the PDI molecule appears as a short and roughly elliptical cylinder, and its four Trx-fold domains are arranged in an annular and not a linear fashion. Examination of the SEC and/or analytical ultracentrifugation behavior of intact PDI, several C-terminally truncated variants, and Trx chimeras suggests that the C-terminal 441–491 fragment of PDI contributes to the discrepancy in molecular mass determinations as determined using these two techniques. Protein Preparations—The plasmid pUC19-PDI, containing the full-length human PDI cDNA, was constructed from pBR322-PDI, a generous gift from Prof. K. Kivirikko, University of Oulu, Finland. The coding sequences of PDI and PDI mutants (Scheme 1) were amplified using pUC19-PDI as a template, and the PCR products with BamHI/HindIII sites were ligated into pQE30 to construct the corresponding expression plasmids. The plasmids of pQE30-Trx-PDI (441–491) and pQE30-Trx (with the additional 11 residues EFPGRPAAKLN at the C terminus of Trx) were constructed as described (22Sun X.X. Dai Y. Liu H.P. Chen S.M. Wang C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1481: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). By taking pQE30-Trx and pQE60-Syn (a plasmid containing the cDNA of α-synuclein (Syn) constructed by G. P. Ren of this group) as templates, the coding sequence of Trx-Syn (99–140) was constructed by overlap extension PCR, and the gene fusion digested with SacI/HindIII was then ligated into pQE30. The sequences of the constructs were verified by diagnostic PCR and DNA sequencing. All the constructs contain an N-terminal His tag (MRGSHHHHHHGS). His-tagged proteins expressed in Escherichia coli M15 [REP4] were purified by using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Amersham Biosciences) and were further purified using a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) eluted by using 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (hereafter referred to as Tris buffer), with a gradient of 0–1 m NaCl. Eluted fractions were examined by SDS-12% PAGE and pooled. For SEC, the proteins were buffer-exchanged to Tris buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl. For SAXS determinations at low protein concentrations (0.83, 1.65, and 3.3 mg/ml), PDI eluted from the Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column was buffer-exchanged to Tris buffer after the best monodisperse condition was confirmed by SEC and stored at -80 °C. The frozen samples were thawed just before performing SAXS experiments. For SAXS determinations at high protein concentrations (7.5 and 10.0 mg/ml) and AFM imaging, PDI eluted from the Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column was dialyzed thoroughly against distilled water at 4 °C, lyophilized, and redissolved in Tris buffer just before the determinations. For analytical ultracentrifugation determinations, proteins eluted from the Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column were dialyzed thoroughly against distilled water at 4 °C, lyophilized, and further purified on a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column eluted with Tris buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl. The sample of reduced Trx-Syn (99–140) was prepared by treatment with 10 mm DTT overnight and then elution with Tris buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl and 0.5 mm DTT. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as a standard (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar). PDI used in this work showed 2.0 free thiols as determined with 5,5′-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (28Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21471) Google Scholar). SAXS Measurements—Synchrotron SAXS measurements of PDI were carried out at the beamline BL-10C of the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan) (29Ueki T. Hiragi Y. Kataoka M. Inoko Y. Amemiya Y. Izumi Y. Tagawa H. Muroga Y. Biophys. Chem. 1985; 23: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The scattered signals were detected using a one-dimensional position-sensitive proportional counter with 512 channels. At a sample-to-detector distance of 1 m and an x-ray wavelength λ of 1.488 Å, the scattering vector q (q = 4πsinθ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle) ranged from 0.01 to 0.35 Å-1, which was calibrated by using dried hen collagen as a standard oriented specimen. Samples in Tris buffer without NaCl were encapsulated inside a cell sandwiched by two thin parallel quartz windows 1 mm apart with a volume of 70 μl. All the SAXS experiments were carried out in a sample holder maintained at 25.0 ± 0.1 °C. SAXS data of buffer and samples were collected alternately in the frames of 60–300 s to avoid radiation-induced protein damage. PDI concentrations from 0.83 to 10.0 mg/ml in Tris buffer were measured so as to obtain the scattering curves at infinite dilution. The data reduction includes normalization of the one-dimensional scattered data to the intensity of the transmitted beam and subtraction of the background scattering of the buffer. All of the scattering curves were then standardized to a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. The low angle data were extrapolated to infinite dilution and merged with the high angle data measured at high protein concentrations to yield final scattering curves. Scattering Data Analysis—The scattering intensity I(q,c), expressed by the Guinier equation (30Guinier A.G. Fournet G. Small Angle Scattering X-rays. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1955: 24-28Google Scholar), is shown in Equation 1 as a function of the scattering vector q and the protein concentration c.I(q,c)=I(0,c)exp-Rg(c)2q23(Eq. 1) Here I(0,c) is the forward scattering intensity, and Rg(c) is the apparent radius of gyration at finite concentration. At low protein concentrations, I(0,c) may be written as shown in Equation 2,Kc/I(0,c)=1/Mr+2A2c+K(Eq. 2) where Kc is a constant determined by using a series of concentrations of bovine serum albumin as a reference protein with the known molecular mass of 67 kDa (31Porod G. Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, London1982: 17-51Google Scholar). Mr is the molecular weight of the protein and can be obtained by extrapolating Kc/I(0,c) to infinite dilution. A2 is the second virial coefficient resulting from interparticle interference effects and can discriminate between attracting and repulsing interactions. Repulsing interactions lead to positive values of A2, and attracting interactions lead to negative values. At the dilute limit, Rg(c) is shown in Equation 3,Rg(c)2=R02-Bifc+K(Eq. 3) where R0 is the radius of gyration at infinite dilution, and Bif is a parameter reflecting inter-solute force potential (32Izumi Y. Kuwamoto S. Jinbo Y. Yoshino H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The sign of Bif means the same as that of A2 (30Guinier A.G. Fournet G. Small Angle Scattering X-rays. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1955: 24-28Google Scholar). The three parameters A2, R0, and Bif were calculated using Equations 2 and 3. The pair-distance distribution function, P(r), given by Equation 4,P(r)=12π2∫I(q)(qr)sin(qr)dq(Eq. 4) is a measure of the frequency of interatomic vector lengths within a protein molecule and can provide more information about the shape of the scattering particle. Ab Initio Molecular Shape Determination—The overall shapes of the protein were restored from the experimental scattering data by DAMMIN (25Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar). Starting with a sphere with a diameter equal to the maximum particle size filled by ∼1000 densely packed small beads (dummy atoms), DAMMIN searches for the best dummy atom model by minimizing the discrepancy function, f(X) = χ2 + αP(X), between the calculated and experimental curves using a simulated annealing method. αP(X) is a looseness penalty with positive weight for α >0, and χ is the discrepancy between the experimental Iexp(qj) and the calculated Icalc(qj) curves as shown in Equation 5,χ2=1N-1∑jIexp(qj)-cscalIcalc(qj)σ(qj)2(Eq. 5) where N is the number of experimental points; cscal is a scaling factor, and σ(qj) is the experimental error at the momentum transfer qj. The method is to modify the coordinates of beads randomly, while always approaching the configurations that decrease the energy f(X). Starting from a random string, simulated annealing was employed to find a compact configuration of beads minimizing the discrepancy. In this method, a constant was subtracted from the experimental data to ensure that the intensity decay follows Porod's law for homogeneous particles. Atomic Force Microscopy—A 10-μl drop of PDI solution at 2.5 μg/ml in Tris buffer was deposited onto a piece of freshly cleaved mica, incubated at room temperature for 10 min, and then rinsed with Tris buffer to remove loosely bound protein. Imaging was performed using a NanoScope IIIa multimode AFM (Veeco Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA) with an E-scanner (10 μm × 10 μm) operating in tapping mode. The cantilevers (100 μm, NP-S, Veeco Instruments) were oscillated at a frequency of ∼8 kHz, and the set point was regulated to have the minimum possible force exerted on the sample while maintaining the sharpness of the image. Height images were collected with a scan rate of 1 Hz. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation experiments were performed using an XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) equipped with a four-cell An-60 Ti rotor at 20 °C. Tris buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl (plus 0.5 mm DTT in the case of reduced Trx-Syn (99–140)) was used as the reference solution. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at a speed of 50,000 rpm for PDI and 60,000 rpm for other samples at a concentration of 0.75 mg/ml. Scans were taken at 280 nm with a radial step size of 0.003 cm. Differential sedimentation coefficients, c(s), were calculated by least squares boundary modeling of sedimentation velocity data using SEDFIT (33Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3064) Google Scholar) from www.analyticalultracentrifugation.com/download.htm. The values of apparent sedimentation coefficients were corrected to s20,w for solvent viscosity by using SEDNTERP from www.jphilo.mail-way.com/download.htm. The frictional coefficients (f/f0) and axial ratios (a/b) were calculated by using the vbar method in Sednterp, assuming a prolate ellipsoid model. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at a speed of 20,000 rpm at protein concentrations of 0.2 and 0.3 mg/ml. Scans were taken at 280 nm with a radial step size of 0.001 cm. For each run, it was verified that equilibrium had been reached until there was no significant difference in scans taken 2 h apart. After the data at equilibrium had been collected, the rotor speed was increased to 40,000 rpm and run for a further 4 h to deplete the meniscus, so that the base line at the meniscus could be measured experimentally. The molecular mass was calculated using the Beckman data analysis software version 5.0 in which absorbance versus radial position data were fitted to the sedimentation equilibrium equation using a nonlinear least squares method. The resulting data sets were analyzed globally using the “self” or the “ideal single-species” model. SAXS Parameters—As shown in Fig. 1, the Guinier plots of the experimental SAXS data at all concentrations were linear in most of the low q region, indicating that PDI protein did not undergo aggregation. The slight downward curvature in the region with very low q near the direct beam stopper, possibly resulting from weak inter-particle interference, was alleviated with decreasing protein concentrations and was negligible for the dilute samples with concentrations of 1.65 and 0.83 mg/ml. To get accurate concentration dependence data and to avoid any influence of x-ray beam stability near the beam stopper, the straight lines were fitted by the least squares method to the measured data within the region 8.0 × 10-4 to 2.5 × 10-3 (Å-2). The function Kc/I(0,c) evaluated from the intercepts of the Guinier plots was linear over the entire concentration range (Fig. 2A), and the slope, which represents the value of A2, was -(4.4 ± 0.3) × 10-4 ml mol g-2. The square of apparent radius of gyration Rg(c) calculated from the slopes of the Guinier plots also showed a linear relationship with protein concentration (Fig. 2B), and the slope, which represents the value of Bif, was -(34.5 ± 3.6) × 10-13 cm5 g-1. The values of A2 and Bif are both negative, indicating attractive interactions between the PDI molecules in solution. The molecular mass of PDI was determined to be 69 ± 3 kDa, indicating that PDI exists as a monomer in solution under the experimental conditions used. The radius of gyration at infinite dilution, i.e. Rg (0), was calculated to be 33.2 ± 0.3 Å. The pair-distance distribution function P(r) (Fig. 3) was obtained from the entire scattering curve I(q) in the range of q, from zero to qmax, by direct Fourier transformation (Equation 4). In the low angle region (q < 0.05 Å-1), I(q) was extended to zero by using Rg (0). In the high angle region (q > 0.05 Å-1), concentrated solutions were used to improve the statistics, as the scattering intensity is not affected by inter-particle interactions. The maximum linear dimension, Dmax, determined from P(r)is105 ± 5 Å, and the radius of gyration estimated from the P(r) function by applying the GNOM package to the entire scattering profile, in the range 0.01 Å-1 to qmax, is 33.7 ± 0.3 Å, which is consistent with the corresponding value of 33.2 ± 0.3 Å estimated from the extrapolated Guinier plots. The P(r) functions calculated from the three-dimensional coordinates (PDB code 1MEK) of domain a (sequence 1–120) and of domain b (PDB code 1BJX) (sequence 119–218) using CRYSOL and GNOM were compared with that of PDI (Fig. 3). The NMR structure of domain b, analyzed by Kemmink et al. (34Kemmink J. Dijkstra K. Mariani M. Scheek R.M. Penka E. Nilges M. Darby N.J. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), actually contains 10 amino acid residues (219–228) more than the currently identified b domain (Scheme 1). The structure of this extra part was found to be disordered and was thus deleted in the P(r) function calculation for the b domain. The value of Dmax of 105 Å for PDI is much smaller than two times the sum of the corresponding values of 37 Å for the a domain and 33 Å for the b domain; therefore, the four domains are not arranged linearly, which would give a value of Dmax larger than 140 Å. Ab Initio Molecular Shape—Dummy atom modeling was performed from the scattering pattern up to qmax = 0.25 Å-1 using DAMMIN within a spherical search diameter of Dmax = 105 Å without symmetrical constraint. The uniqueness and the stability of the restored shapes were checked by repeated modeling. Twenty independent models were then aligned and averaged using the programs SUPCOMB (35Kozin M.B. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 33-41Crossref Scopus (1091) Google Scholar) and DAMAVER (36Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 860-864Crossref Scopus (1617) Google Scholar), which superimposed all models and determined the common envelope containing all models. In the next round, this common envelope was used as an initial search volume for all new models. Twenty runs of the ab initio shape determination produced consistent results, as all output models yielded nearly identical scattering patterns (Fig. 4, solid line) with a discrepancy of χ = 1.3 to the respective corrected experimental data obtained by subtracting a constant in the scattering range up to 0.25 Å-1. These final models were again aligned and averaged using SUPCOMB and DAMAVER. The averaged dummy atom model at three orthogonal orientations (Fig. 5, left column) suggests a short and roughly elliptical cylinder with approximate dimensions of 105 × 65 × 40 Å. By using the three-dimensional structure visualization software RasTop, a shallow concave area with low electrical density was found in the center of the molecule. DAMSEL (part of the DAMAVER package) was employed to align all of the possible pairs of models and to identify the most probable model (Fig. 5, right column), which should yield the smallest average discrepancy. The result showed a molecule with very similar shape to that obtained by averaged dummy atom modeling (Fig. 5, left column) except that it had a significant small cavity of about 20 Å in diameter at the center. This cavity corresponds well to the shallow concave area in the averaged dummy atom model.FIGURE 5Restored models of PDI. A, top view; B, front view; and C, side view. Left column, the averaged model. Right column, the most probable model by DAMMIN using a qmax of 0.25 Å-1 with no symmetrical constraint.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) AFM Imaging—As shown in Fig. 6, most of the particles randomly distributed on a mica substrate do not show linear shape. By evaluation of the ratio of the full width at half-maximum height for the longest to that of the shortest size of a particle by the method of section analysis using Nanoscope version 6.12, the average ratio of 211 particles in several AFM images was calculated to be 1.26 ± 0.15. Allowing for the inevitable tip broadening of AFM imaging (37Keller D. Surf. Sci. 1991; 253: 353-364Crossref Scopus (356) Google Scholar), PDI molecules in AFM image appeared as approximately flat elliptical cylinders. Fragment 441–491 and the Abnormal Behavior of PDI on SEC—In contrast to the a, b, b′, and a′ domains, the C-terminal sequence 463–491, c, has never been assigned as a structural domain but is just an extension (2Ellgaard L. Ruddock L.W. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), probably with no secondary or tertiary structure (38Noiva R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 481-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). We prepared several PDI mutants with the C-terminal sequence deleted to different extents in order to examine the behavior of these mutants by SEC. PDI was found to elute at a position corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 116 kDa (SEC profiles are not shown), and PDI (1–462) with the whole c extension deleted eluted as two peaks of 120 and 65 kDa. According to the calculated monomeric molecular mass of 56.719 kDa (the additional N-terminal His tag was included), PDI appears to be a homodimer, and PDI (1–462) is a mixture of dimers and monomers (Table 1). PDI (1–440), with a further 22 residues deleted and missing the last α-helix and a part of a loop in the a′ domain (10Koivunen P. Pirneskoski A. Karvonen P. Ljung J. Helaakoski T. Notbohm H.

https://openalex.org/W2029021521,"The exosome is a conserved eukaryotic enzymatic complex that plays an essential role in many pathways of RNA processing and degradation. Here, we describe the structural characterization of the predicted archaeal exosome in solution using small angle x-ray scattering. The structure model calculated from the small angle x-ray scattering pattern provides an indication of the existence of a disk-shaped structure, corresponding to the “RNases PH ring” complex formed by the proteins aRrp41 and aRrp42. The RNases PH ring complex corresponds to the core of the exosome, binds RNA, and has phosphorolytic and polymerization activities. Three additional molecules of the RNA-binding protein aRrp4 are attached to the core as extended and flexible arms that may direct the substrates to the active sites of the exosome. In the presence of aRrp4, the activity of the core complex is enhanced, suggesting a regulatory role for this protein. The results shown here also indicate the participation of the exosome in RNA metabolism in Archaea, as was established in Eukarya. The exosome is a conserved eukaryotic enzymatic complex that plays an essential role in many pathways of RNA processing and degradation.

The results shown here also indicate the participation of the exosome in RNA metabolism in Archaea, as was established in Eukarya. In Eukarya, the complex of 3′ → 5′ exoribonucleases named exosome participates in the maturation of the small nuclear RNAs, small nucleolar RNAs, and rRNAs (1Allmang C. Kufel J. Chanfreau G. Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5399-5410Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) as well as in the degradation of deadenylated mRNAs (2Anderson J.S. Parker R.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1497-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 3Oliveira C.C. Gonzales F.A. Zanchin N.I.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1684-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Consequently, the exosome plays a central role in the regulation of gene expression in these organisms. The exosome was originally described in yeast as a complex consisting of nine core components, six of which have homology to bacterial RNase PH (Rrp41p, Rrp42p, Rrp43p, Rrp45p, Rrp46p, and Mtr3p), and three contain a putative S1 RNA binding domain (Rrp4p, Rrp40p, and Cls4p) (5Mitchell P. Tollervey D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 843-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). All these proteins were also identified in human (6Raijmakers R. Egberts W.V. van Venrooij W.J. Pruijn G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 653-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and Trypanosoma brucei (7Estevez A.M. Lehner B. Sanderson C.M. Ruppert T. Clayton C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34943-34951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Some exosome components were also found in Drosophila melanogaster (8Andrulis E.D. Werner J. Nazarian A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Lis J.T. Nature. 2002; 420: 837-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and Arabidopsis thaliana (9Chekanova J.A. Dutko J.A. Mian I.S. Belostotsky D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These findings indicate a conservative function for the exosome among eukaryotic organisms. Currently, no high resolution structural data are available for the eukaryotic exosome, but electron microscopy and bioinformatics analyses led to a model that shows a structure similar to that of the polyribonucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) 4The abbreviations used are: PNPase, polyribonucleotide phosphorylase; ORF, open reading frame; SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering.4The abbreviations used are: PNPase, polyribonucleotide phosphorylase; ORF, open reading frame; SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering. of Streptomyces antibioticus (10Symmons M.F.

Bottcher B. Russell R.B. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 628-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). According to that model, the core components of the eukaryotic exosome assemble into a doughnut-shaped structure, with the six RNase PH-type proteins forming a hexameric ring, and three proteins, which contain S1 RNA binding domain, are located on top of the RNases PH ring. This model is supported by two-hybrid interactions between components of the human (6Raijmakers R. Egberts W.V. van Venrooij W.J. Pruijn G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 653-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), T. brucei (7Estevez A.M. Lehner B. Sanderson C.M. Ruppert T. Clayton C. J. Biol.

Oliveira, unpublished results. exosomes. The existence of an archaeal counterpart of the eukaryotic exosome was previously proposed by comparing the gene clustering in archaeal genomes (12Koonin E.V. Wolf Y.I. Aravind L. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 240-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In these organisms the orthologues of the exosome core subunits aRrp4p, aRrp41p, and aRrp42p are encoded by adjacent ORFs and are part of the so-called exosomal superoperon. Each of these proteins corresponds to one domain of bacterial PNPase and to three proteins of eukaryotic exosome (Fig. 1A). Recently, a complex containing these proteins was isolated from Sulfolobus solfataricus (13Evguenieva-Hackenburg E. Walter P. Hochleitner E. Lottspeich F. Klug G. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 889-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The coprecipitation of 16 S rRNA and ribosomal proteins with this complex suggests its participation in rRNA processing in Archaea. In the exosome of S. solfataricus, the proteins aRrp41, aRrp42, and aRrp4 are in apparent equimolar amounts forming a protein complex of ∼250 kDa, as determined by glycerol gradient centrifugation (13Evguenieva-Hackenburg E. Walter P. Hochleitner E. Lottspeich F. Klug G. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 889-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In the present study we report the in vitro assembly of a protein complex corresponding to the archaeal exosome using recombinant proteins of Pyrococcus abyssi (PAB) and P. horikoshii (PH); archaeal rRNA processing protein 4 (aRrp4, ORF PAB0419), aRrp42 (PH1548), and aRrp41 (PH1549). Analyses of these proteins separately or in complex by small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) allowed us to propose a structural model for the archaeal exosome. In this model aRrp41 and aRrp42 form a disk-shaped structure that correlates with the PNPase hexameric ring formed by the RNase PH domains, as predicted by sequence analysis (Fig. 1A). The RNases PH ring complex showed characteristic activities typical of bacterial PNPase and RNase PH enzymes, including RNA binding, phosphorolysis, and polymerization. During the final preparation of this work a paper was published on the archaeal core exosome structure (14Lorentzen E. Walter P. Fribourg S. Evguenieva-Hackenberg E. Klug G. Conti E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In that work the crystal structure of the RNase PH ring from another Archaea, S. solfataricus, was obtained, revealing a hexameric ring formed by aRrp41-aRrp42 dimers, confirming our prediction about the homologous structure in Pyrococcus.Our data also complement those on Sulfolobus with the analysis of the Pyrococcus complex formed by aRrp4, aRrp41, and aRrp42, which constitute the archaeal exosome. In this complex three aRrp4 molecules are bound to the core complex as extended arms, which can drive the RNA substrates to the catalytic centers of the exosome. In the presence of aRrp4, the activity of the core complex is enhanced, suggesting a regulatory role for this protein. The functional implications of these data and its relationship with the eukaryotic exosome structure are discussed. Microorganisms, Plasmids, Enzymes, and DNA Manipulation—The Escherichia coli strains used in this study were DH5α and BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL (Stratagene). Plasmid DNA was extracted using a Qiagen plasmid purification kit. Restriction enzymes and other DNA-modifying enzymes were used as recommended by their manufacturer (New England Biolabs). Genomic DNA of Pyrococcus horikoshii OT3 was kindly provided by Dr. F.J. Medrano (Laboratório Nacional de Luz Sín-crotron, Campinas, Brazil), and Genomic DNA of P. abyssi GE5 was kindly provided by Dr. Patrick Forterre (Institut de Génétique et Microbiologie, Université Paris Sud, France). Genomic DNA of P. horikoshii was used as a template to amplify aRrp41 (PH1549) and aRrp42 (PH1548), whereas genomic DNA of P. abyssi was used for aRrp4 (PAB0419) amplification. Gene Cloning and Construction of Expression Vectors—aRrp41 was amplified using primers aRrp41 for (5′-TACATATGATGGAGAAACCAGAAG-3′) and aRrp41 rev (5′-ACGAATTCATCTCATTATCACTCACTTTC-3′); the restriction sites for NdeI and EcoRI are underlined. NdeI- and EcoRI-digested DNA of aRrp41 was inserted into the expression vector pET29a(+) (Novagen). aRrp42 (PH1548) was amplified using primers aRrp42for (5′-AGGGATCCCATATGAGTGATAATGAGATCG-3′) and aRrp42rev (5′-ATCTGCAGATTAGGTAAATATTACTCC-3′); the restriction sites for BamHI, NdeI, and PstI are underlined. NdeI- and PstI-digested DNA of aRrp42 was inserted into the expression vector pAE (15Ramos C.R. Abreu P.A. Nascimento A.L. Ho P.L. Braz J. Med. Biol. Res. 2004; 37: 1103-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). aRrp4-aRrp41 were amplified using primer aRrp4for (5′-CGGATCCCATATGAAGAGGATTTTTGTTC-3′) and reverse primer for aRrp41 (aRrp41rev). The PCR-amplified DNA fragment containing the ORFs aRrp4-aRrp41 was digested with NdeI and HindIII (HindIII cuts just downstream of the aRrp4 stop codon), and the aRrp4 ORF was inserted into the pET29a(+) expression vector. Expression and Purification of Proteins—All recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL strain, transformed with the correspondent plasmids. After the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, the cells were harvested and resuspended in buffer A (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and lysed in a French press. The lysate was heated at 85 °C for 30 min and cooled on ice for 15 min. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was fractionated by chromatography. Heat-treated supernatant containing aRrp42 was loaded onto an anion-exchange column (HiTrap Q, Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a linear gradient of 50-500 mm NaCl in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA using an ÄKTA fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences). The proteins aRrp4 and aRrp41 were purified by a similar procedure but with Tris-HCl, pH 11. Exosome Assembly—To reconstitute the archaeal exosome, the RNases PH ring complex was obtained by co-expression of the proteins aRrp41 and aRrp42 in E. coli transformed with the plasmids pET29-aRrp41 (KanR) and pAE-aRrp42 (AmpR). The purification procedure was identical to that used for aRrp42. After anion-exchange chromatography, the fractions containing the protein complex were pooled and dialyzed against 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA. The complex was loaded onto a HiTrap-heparin column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0-500 mm NaCl in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA in an ΔKTA fast protein liquid chromatography system. For exosome assembly the RNases PH ring complex was mixed with a 3-fold excess of aRrp4 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, the mixture was loaded on a HiTrap Q column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0-500 mm NaCl in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA. The excess of aRrp4 protein was in the flow-through fraction, and the exosome complex (aRrp41, aRrp42, and aRrp4) eluted as a single peak. Protein samples were concentrated by centrifugation using Centricon microconcentrators (Millipore). The final step of purification of all proteins and complexes was gel filtration on a Superdex 75 XK 16/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA. The proteins were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Protein content was determined by optical density at 280 nm using the extinction coefficient calculated by ProtParam tools (www.expasy.ch). Gel Filtration Analysis of the Complexes—The purified proteins and complexes were subjected to gel filtration analysis on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) preequilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA. A flow rate of 0.4 ml ·min-1 in the same buffer was used, and fractions were stored at -20 °C. Apparent molecular masses were assessed based on the retention time of the molecular mass markers (low and high molecular mass gel filtration calibration kits, Amersham Biosciences: thyroglobulin, 669 kDa; apoferritin, 443 kDa; catalase, 232 kDa; aldolase, 158 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 67 kDa; ovalbumin, 43 kDa; chymotrypsinogen, 25kDa; ribonuclease A, 13.7 kDa). Small Angle X-ray Scattering—SAXS experiments were performed at the D11A-SAXS beamline of the Brazilian Sinchrotron Light Laboratory (16Kellermann G. Vicentin F. Tamura E. Rocha M. Tolentino H. Barbosa A. Craievich A. Torriani I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 880-883Crossref Google Scholar). The experimental setup included a temperature-controlled glass capillary (17Cavalcanti L.P. Torriani I.L. Plivelic T.S. Oliveira C.L.P. Kellermann G. Neuenschwander R. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 2004; 75: 4541-4546Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and Gabriel type linear position-sensitive detector (18Gabriel A. Dauvergne F. Nucl. Instrum. Methods. 1982; 201: 223-224Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The RNases PH ring and exosome complexes at 3.5-7 mg ·ml-1 (in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA) were kept at 20 °C during the exposures. The data acquisition was performed taking several 600-s frames for each sample, which allowed the control of any possible radiation damage. Several sample-detector distances were used in the experiments, which enabled detection of scattering vector q values (q = 4π/λ sin θ, where 2θ is the scattering vector, and λ is the wavelength) in several angular ranges for each sample. Data treatment of the scattering intensities was performed using the software package trat1d (19Oliveira C.L.P. TRAT1D: Computer Program for SAXS Data Treatment. Laboratório Nacional de Luz Síncrotron, Campinas, SP, Brazil2003Google Scholar). As output, the data treatment program calculates the q values and the corrected experimental errors. Data at low and high concentrations as well as short and long distances were joined to obtain good scattering intensity curves in a wide angular range. From the Guinier Plot of the experimental data (ln(I) versus q2) we calculated the Guinier radius of gyration RgG and the forward scattering intensity I (0) using the exponential approximation limq→0 [I(q)] ≅ I (0) ·exp(q2 ·RgG2/3), valid for very small angles (q < 1.3/RgG). These parameters could also be obtained from the theoretical fit of the entire intensity curve using the program package GNOM (20Semenyuk A.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 537-540Crossref Scopus (564) Google Scholar), which also calculates the pair distance distribution function p(r). From this function the particle maximum dimension Dmax as well as the real space value of the radius of gyration Rg and forward scattering I(0) of the scattering particle were obtained. The molecular mass of the studied proteins and protein complexes were evaluated by comparison of the forward scattering with that from a reference protein solution. The accuracy of this method was limited by the uncertainty in the measured protein concentration used for data calculation. The standards used were catalase (molecular mass 232 kDa), aldolase (molecular mass 158 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (molecular mass 67 kDa). Additionally, we calculated the so-called Kratky plots (I ·q2 × q), which give information on the compactness of the protein structure (21Glatter O. Kratky O. Small Angle X-ray Scattering. Academic Press, Inc., New York1982: 422-429Google Scholar). SAXS Model Calculations—Several modeling tools were applied for the data analysis, and the procedures are described under “Results.” The ab initio program DAMMIN (22Svergun D.I. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2879-2886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar) was applied to restore the protein shapes. The program DAMAVER was used to average independent calculated ab initio models in order to retrieve the most probable configuration (23Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallog. 2003; 36: 860-864Crossref Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). The Rigid Body modeling program MASSHA (24Konarev P.V. Petoukhov M.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 527-532Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar) was used to search and calculate quaternary structures against the experimental data. The program MOLMOL (25Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6454) Google Scholar) was used to generate the model pictures and superpose the calculated structures. The program CRYSOL (26Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2687) Google Scholar) was used to fit the experimental intensity with the composed models and also with known crystallographic model structures. The program HYDROPRO (27Garcia de la Torre J.C. Huertas M.L. Carrasco B. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 719-730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar) was used to calculate theoretical hydrodynamic properties for the generated models. Limited Proteolysis Experiments—Protein suspension in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA was incubated at 25 °C with trypsin at a 250:1 protein/enzyme ratio. At timed intervals, aliquots were withdrawn, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). The samples were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE. In Vitro Transcription of RNA for Activity Assays—Uniformly labeled unspecific RNA was produced by in vitro transcription of XhoI-linearized pBS7 plasmid (28Russnak R. Nehrke K.W. Platt T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1689-1697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of NTPs, 50 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Biosciences), and SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega). This RNA probe is the antisense of the 3′-UTR of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytochrome C pre-mRNA (90 ribonucleotides). Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assays—The labeled RNA was mixed with different quantities of the proteins (0-8 pmol) in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The RNA-protein complexes were subsequently fractionated by electrophoresis on 5% native polyacrylamide gels. RNase PH Phosphorolysis and Polymerase Assays—RNA phosphorolysis was assayed by incubating the proteins with labeled RNA in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm NaH2PO4. RNA polymerization was accomplished under the same conditions but using ADP instead of NaH2PO4. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and products were resolved on a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. To gain information on the structure and function of the exosome complex, we decided to study the predicted archaeal exosome with corresponding recombinant proteins from two closely related organisms: P. horikoshii and P. abyssi (Fig. 1A). The exosome subunits aRrp4, aRr41, and aRrp42 from these Archaea show 95, 97, and 91% of identity and 97, 99, and 97% of similarity, respectively. This high similarity allows the combination of proteins from these organisms to reconstitute the exosome. The ORFs corresponding to aRrp4, (PAB0419), aRrp41 (PH1549), and aRrp42 (PH1548) were amplified by PCR, cloned in E. coli expression vectors, and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1B). Exosome subunits that are homologous to the bacterial RNase PH (aRrp41 and aRrp42) are predicted to associate, forming a hexameric ring, as observed for PNPase RNase PH domains (10Symmons M.F. Jones G.H. Luisi B.F. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1215-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was confirmed by coexpressing aRrp41 and aRrp42 in E. coli. The analysis of the single elution peak observed in the first step of purification confirmed the presence of both proteins (Supplemental Fig. 1). The intensities of the protein bands suggest a 1:1 stoichiometry. The complex purified by this procedure is referred to as RNases PH ring. To reconstitute the archaeal exosome, purified aRrp4 was added to the RNases PH ring complex and subjected to co-purification through anion-exchange chromatography. This procedure resulted in the co-purification of the three subunits in a complex (Fig. 2A). These results indicate the specific association between the aRrp4, aRrp41, and aRrp42 proteins. The resulting complex, obtained by the combination of P. horikoshii and P. abysii proteins, corresponds to the archaeal exosome. The recombinant protein aRrp4 as well as the complexes were characterized by gel filtration on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column. The data obtained are summarized in Table 1. aRrp4 is monomeric and eluted as a 34-kDa protein, a value very close to its theoretical molecular mass. The observed molecular mass for the RNases PH ring was 198 kDa, whereas the theoretical molecular masses of aRrp41 and aRrp42 are 27.8 and 30 kDa, respectively. Considering the similar intensities of the corresponding bands in SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 2A and Supplemental Fig. 1), the molecular mass of 198 kDa suggests that the RNases PH ring complex is composed of three copies of each of these proteins, which is in accordance with the hexameric ring hypothesis.TABLE 1Structural parameters of archaeal exosome complex obtained by gel filtration and SAXSaRrp4RNases PH ringExosomeTheoretical molecular mass (kDa)29.3173.4aTheoretical values correspond to the hexameric ring hypothesis, i.e. the three folds of the sum of theoretical molecular mass of each component261.3aTheoretical values correspond to the hexameric ring hypothesis, i.e. the three folds of the sum of theoretical molecular mass of each componentGel filtrationbThe values are means ± S.D. of three replica experiments.Molecular mass (kDa)34 ± 1198.5 ± 14.8287.8 ± 3Stokes radius (Å)25.9 ± 0.453 ± 1.259.2 ± 0.18SAXSMolecular mass (kDa)36 ± 3179 ± 5257 ± 7Rg (Å)41.3 ± 0.838.5 ± 0.259.9 ± 0.3Maximum dimension (Å)~150~112~190SAXS modelscValues obtained using program HYDROPRO.Stokes radius (Å)39.0149.8286.60a Theoretical values correspond to the hexameric ring hypothesis, i.e. the three folds of the sum of theoretical molecular mass of each componentb The values are means ± S.D. of three replica experiments.c Values obtained using program HYDROPRO. Open table in a new tab The addition of the protein aRrp4 (30 kDa) resulted in an increase of ∼90 kDa in the observed molecular mass of the RNases PH ring complex that corresponds to three molecules of aRrp4 for complex. Accordingly, the observed molecular mass for the exosome complex (287 kDa) is similar to its theoretical molecular mass (261 kDa). The gel filtration profiles of RNases PH ring and exosome complexes and the analysis of the corresponding peaks indicate that the size difference between the RNases PH ring and the exosome is due to the association of three aRrp4 subunits (Fig. 2). In summary, the gel filtration analysis is consistent with the structural similarity between the exosome and the bacterial PNPase. The results of the SAXS analyses for the isolated proteins and the complexes show that in all cases the values of Guinier radius of gyration RgG and real space Rg were close. This agreement in association with the calculated values of molecular weights indicates that in all cases we had satisfactory monodispersity of the solutions. The experimental intensity data as a function of the modulus of the scattering vector q are shown for aRrp4 protein (Fig. 3A), RNases PH ring (Fig. 3B), and exosome complex (Fig. 3C). The analysis of the SAXS data indicates that the aRrp4 protein has a radius of gyration of 41.3 ± 0.8Å(RgG = 42Å) and maximum dimension of ∼150 Å. The estimated molecular mass for this protein using appropriate protein standards is 36 ± 3 kDa, which is close to the theoretical value for a monomeric protein (∼30 kDa; Table 1). The function p(r) indicates that aRrp4 possesses an extremely elongated conformation in solution. However, gel filtration data yields a Stokes radius of 25.9 Å. As shown in the next section, the predicted Stokes radius for the ab initio model is 39 Å, and these results indicate that in addition to the elongated conformation (see Table 1), the protein aRrp4 is quite flexible (29Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry Part II: Techniques for the Study of Biological Structure and Function. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1980: 591Google Scholar). The RNases PH ring complex has a radius of gyration of 38.5 ± 0.2 Å (RgG = 40 Å) and maximum dimension of ∼112 Å. The estimated molecular mass for this complex is 179 ± 5 kDa, which is in good agreement with the expected value for the RNases PH protein complex (173.4 kDa; see Table 1). The distance distribution function (p(r)) indicates that the RNases PH ring possesses a globular conformation. The exosome complex has a radius of gyration of 59.9 ± 0.3Å(RgG = 62 Å) and maximum dimension of ∼190 Å. The calculated molecular mass for this complex is 257 ± 7 kDa, close to the theoretical value for this complex (261.3 kDa; Table 1). The observed molecular mass difference between the exosome and RNases PH ring complex (87.9 kDa) indicates that three molecules of aRrp4 (∼30 kDa) are attached to the RNases PH ring to form the exosome complex. These results corroborate the gel filtration data. The behavior for the p(r) function was similar for the RNases PH ring and exosome complexes, and the major differences occur for large r values. The differences in size and radius of gyration are due to the addition of aRrp4 protein to the RNase PH ring complex. Also, the Kratky plots suggest the flexibility of the aRrp4 protein and the compactness of the RNases PH ring complex (Supplemental Fig. 2, A and B, respectively). Also, this analysis indicates that the exosome complex possesses a globular compact domain. However, it is less structured than the RNase PH ring, indicating that the aRrp4 monomers have flexibility also when in the exosome complex (Supplemental Fig. 2C). aRrp4—Ab initio model calculations for this protein gave a very elongated conformation in solution as indicated in Fig. 4A. As shown in Fig. 3A, this model fits perfectly the experimental data. Interestingly, this structural information is not in agreement with previous predictions using the structure of RNA binding domains from S. antibioticus PNPase as in reference (10Symmons M.F. Jones G.H. Luisi B.F. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 1215-1226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (222) Google Scholar), which indicated that these domains should be more compact and linked to the RNases PH ring in a layered fashion. We do not have any bona fide solved structure of a homologous protein to compare with our aRrp4 model. RNases PH Ring—Ab initio model calculations for the RNases PH ring complex leads to a disk-shaped rigid structure with a central protuberance (Fig. 4B), giving a very good fit of the experimental data (Fig. 3B). To compare the calculated models with homologous crystallographic structures recently published, we applied the program CRYSOL (26Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2687) Google Scholar) using the structural information of the RNases PH ring from the exosome of S. solfataricus (2BR2), Bacillus subtilis RNase PH (1OYR), and RNases PH domains of S. antibioticus PNPase (1E3P). The best fit was obtained using the model of the RNases PH ring of PNPase (Fig. 3B). The difference in the data for values above q = 0.07 Å-1 arises mainly from differences in the monomers since they are homologous proteins. Interestingly, the similarity of P. horikoshii aRrp41 and aRrp42 proteins with B. subtilis RNase PH (46 and 40%, respectively) is higher than the similarity of these proteins with the corresponding RNase PH domain of S. antibioticus PNPase (Fig. 1). SAXS data indicates that despite sequence similarity, the structure of RNases PH ring of the Pyrococcus exosome, formed by aRrp41 and aRrp42, is more closely related to the PNPase ring, formed by two distinct domains, than to the homohexameric ring s"
https://openalex.org/W2077851332,"GNA1870, a 28-kDa surface-exposed lipoprotein of <i>Neisseria meningitidis</i> recently discovered by reverse vaccinology, is one of the most potent antigens of <i>Meningococcus</i> and a promising candidate for a universal vaccine against a devastating disease. Previous studies of epitope mapping and genetic characterization identified residues critical for bactericidal response within the C-terminal domain of the molecule. To elucidate the conformation of protective epitopes, we used NMR spectroscopy to obtain the solution structure of the immunodominant 18-kDa C-terminal portion of GNA1870. The structure consists of an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel overlaid by a short α-helix with an unstructured N-terminal end. Residues previously shown to be important for antibody recognition were mapped on loops facing the same ridge of the molecule. The sequence similarity of GNA1870 with members of the bacterial transferrin receptor family allows one to predict the folding of this class of well known bacterial antigens, providing the basis for the rational engineering of high affinity B cell epitopes."

Thereby, DGKs are considered to be a one of the key players in lipid signaling, but its physiological function remains to be solved. In an effort to investigate one of nine subtypes, we found that DGKγ came to be localized in the nucleus with time in all cell lines tested while seen only in the cytoplasm at the early stage of culture, indicating that DGKγ is transported from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. The nuclear transportation of DGKγ didn't necessarily need DGK activity, but its C1 domain was indispensable, suggesting that the C1 domain of DGKγ acts as a nuclear transport signal. Furthermore, to address the function of DGKγ in the nucleus, we produced stable cell lines of wild-type DGKγ and mutants, including kinase negative, and investigated their cell size, growth rate, and cell cycle. The cells expressing the kinase-negative mutant of DGKγ were larger in size and showed slower growth rate, and the S phase of the cells was extended. These findings implicate that nuclear DGKγ regulates cell cycle.

The generated DG is phosphorylated to phosphatidic acid by diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) or metabolized by DG lipase (2Topham M.K. Prescott S.M. J. Biol.

Thus, DGK is an important enzyme to inactivate PKC by reducing the DG level, contributing to regulating of the cellular response. In addition, phosphatidic acid itself activates ζPKC (7Limatola C.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11447-11450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Although all DGKs have cysteine-rich repeats similar to the C1A and C1B domains of PKCs in the N terminus and a catalytic domain in the C terminus, they are divided into five groups on the primary structure of these DGKs. Type I DGKs, including DGKα,-β, and -γ, have EF-hand motifs and two cysteine-rich regions (C1 domain) in the regulatory domain (12Kanoh H. Yamada K. Sakane F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 13Jiang Y. Qian W. Hawes J.W. Walsh J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34092-34099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), whereas Type II DGKs, DGKδ and -η, have a pleckstrin homology domain instead of the EF-hand motif in addition to the C1 domain (14Sakane F.

Type III, DGKϵ, has only one C1 domain in the regulatory domain (16Tang W. Bunting M. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10237-10241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate phosphorylation site-like region and four ankyrin repeats are unique domains in Type IV DGK (17Bunting M. Tang W. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M.

The final group, type V, includes DGKθ, which has three cysteine-rich regions and a pleckstrin homology domain with overlapping Ras-associating domain (19Houssa B. Schaap D. van der Wal J. Goto K.

The DGKs are thought to be involved in development, differentiation, construction of neural network and immunity, etc. However, subtype specific function and regulation mechanisms of DGKs are not clear. Several groups have reported many different localization and translocation of DGKs, possibly contributing to their subtype-specific functions. In an effort to elucidate the function of DGK, we unexpectedly found that GFP-fused DGKγ (GFP-DGKγ) became localized in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm a few days after transfection but was localized mainly in the cytoplasm just after expressed in CHO-K1 cells. Although nuclear transportation of DGKγ has never been reported, expression of DGKθ and DGKζ in the nucleus has been already described (20Bregoli L. Baldassare J.J. Raben D.M. J. Biol.

McIntyre T.M. Blackshear P.J. Prescott S.M. Nature. 1998; 394: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These findings, together with the facts that phosphatidylinositol turnover exists within the nucleus and DG may be involved in the regulation of cell cycle (22York J.D. Majerus P.W. J. Biol.

However, mechanism of the nuclear transportation and physiological functions of DGKγ are unknown. We, therefore, investigated molecular mechanism and physiological significance of nuclear transportation of DGKγ. Materials—CHO-K1 cells were donated from Dr. M. Nishijima (National Institute of Health, Tokyo, Japan). COS-7 cells, SH-SY5Y cells, and HeLa cells were purchased from the RIKEN Cell Bank. Fetal bovine serum, RNase A, and anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody were obtained from Sigma. FuGENE 6 Transfection reagent was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Propidium iodide was obtained from Wako (Osaka, Japan). FluoroLink Cy3-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. We produced anti-GFP antibody ourselves. 4Y. Yamaguchi, Y.

A TLC plate was obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Geneticin was purchased from Invitrogen. Cell Culture—CHO-K1 cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium (Nacalaitesque, Japan). COS-7 and NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagles' medium (Nacalaitesque, Japan). SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagles' medium/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) (Invitrogen). All cells were cultured at 37 °C in humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. All media contained 25 mm glucose, and all were buffered with 44 mm NaHCO3 and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Invitrogen). The fetal bovine serum used was not heat-inactivated. The media for SH-SY5Y cells was added with 1% GlutaMAX™-I Supplement (Invitrogen). Constructs of Plasmids Encoding DGKγ-fused GFP and Mutants— The constructs encoding DGKγ having GFP at its N terminus (GFP-DGKγ) or at C terminus (DGKγ-GFP) and mutants having substitution of Cys-285 to Gly in the C1A domain (GFP-DGKγ C1Am) or Cys-348 to Gly in the C1B domain (GFP-DGKγ C1Bm) were previously described (28Shirai Y. Segawa S. Kuriyama M. Goto K. Sakai N. Saito N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24760-24766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The constructs encoding the mutants lacking the C1A or C1B domain (GFP-DGKγ ΔC1A or GFP-DGKγ ΔC1B) were also described previously (29Shindo M. Irie K. Masuda A. Ohigashi H. Shirai Y. Miyasaka K. Saito N. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18448-18454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Kinase negative mutant of DGKγ (GFP-DGKγ KN) was produced by substitution of Gly-491 to Asp. Briefly, using the plasmid encoding GFP-DGKγ, site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol with an ExSite PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The primers were 5′-GCTGGATCCTGGATTGCTTTGACAAGG-3′ and 5′-CAACTGTGTCATCTCCGCCACAGGCAA-3′. The mutation was confirmed by verifying its sequence. Furthermore, to make kinase-negative mutants having substitution of Cys-285 or Cys-348 to Gly (GFP-DGKγ KNC1Am and GGFP-DGKγ KNC1Bm), the cDNA of DGKγ KN was digested with SalI and SmaI and then subcloned into the SalI and SmaI site in the plasmid encoding GFP-DGKγ C1Am and GFP-DGKγ C1Bm, respectively. In addition, to construct DGKγ KN having a nuclear localization signal (NLS), cDNA fragments of DGKγ KN with BspEI site at the N terminus and XhoI site at the C terminus were produced by a PCR using cDNA for kinase-negative mutant of DGKγ constructed as described above. The PCR products were first subcloned into a pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI). After digestion with BspEI and XhoI, the cDNA encoding DGKγ KN was subcloned into the BspEI and XhoI site in the pECFP-Nuc vector (Clontech). The primers were 5′-AATCCGGGATGAGTGACGGGCAATGG-3′ and 5′-GCTCGAGCGTCCTTGAACGGCTTTTCCTC-3′. Constructs of the Plasmids Encoding C1 Domain Fragments of DGKγ—cDNA fragments of C1 domain with EcoRI site in the N terminus and BamHI site in the C terminus were produced by a PCR using cDNA for rat DGKγ as the template (30Goto K. Funayama M. Kondo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 13042-13046Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The PCR products were first subcloned into a pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega). After digestion with EcoRI and BamHI, the cDNA-encoding C1 domain was subcloned into the EcoRI and BglII sites in the p3xFLAG-CMV™-14 expression vector (Sigma) or pEGFPC2 (Clontech). The primers for C1 domain (805–1140 bp) were 5′-TTGAATTCATGCACGCCTGGACCCGA-3′ and 5′-TGAGATCTGCACGCTGTCGACCAAT-3′. The primers for C1A domain plus Hinge (805–999 bp) were 5′-TTGAATTCATGCACGGCCTGGACCCTG-3′ and 5′-TTAGATCTCTGCATCACCTCACC-3′. The primers for Hinge plus C1B domain (955–1140 bp) were 5′-CCGAATTCATGGTGAAAACATACTCC-3′ and 5′-TGAGATCTGCACGCTTGCACAAT-3′. The primers for C1A domain (805–954 bp) were 5′-TTGAATTCATGCCACGCCTGGACCCCTGA-3′ and 5′-TTAGATCTCTGCATCACCTCACC-3′. The primers for Hinge (955–990 bp) were 5′-CCGAATTCATGGTGAAAACATACTCC-3′ and 5′-TTAGATCTCTGCATCACCTCACC-3′. The primers for C1B domain (1000–1140 bp) were 5′-TTGAATTCATGCACGCGTGGGTGGAA-3′ and 5′-TGAGATCTGCACGCTTGTCGACATA-3′. Transfection—Cells (2.0 × 104 cells/dish) on glass-bottom dish (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) were transfected using 3 μl of FuGENE™6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) and 1 μg of DNA according to the manufacturer's protocol. Transfected cells were cultured at 37 °C for ∼24 h before use. Immunostaining—CHO-K1 cells transfected cDNA coding FLAG fusion proteins as described above, and those without transfection were fixed for 1 h at room temp with 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% picric acid in 0.1 m phosphate buffer and permeabilized with 0.3% TritonX-100 in 0.01 m PBS for 15 min at room temp. Cells were sequentially incubated with 10% normal goat serum, mouse anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), or anti-DGKγ antibody, and then Fluorolink Cy3-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody. At each step, transfected cells were washed three times with 0.01 m PBS containing 0.03% Triton X-100 (PBS-T) for 5 min. For preparation of anti-DGKγ antibody, an oligopeptide corresponding to amino acids 778–791 of human DGKγ (31Kai M. Sakane F. Imai S. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18492-18498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used for antigen. This antibody was purified by antigen-immobilized affinity column. We finally confirmed that the purified DGKγ antibody has no cross-reactions with pig DGKα or rat DGKβ. Confocal Microscopy—The fluorescence of Cy3 and GFP were observed under confocal laser scanning fluorescent microscopy (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The GFP fluorescence was monitored at 488 nm argon laser excitation with 515 nm long pass barrier filter. Cy3 fluorescence was monitored at 543 nm HeNe 1 excitation with a 560–615 nm band pass filter. Upon quantitating, the subcellular distribution of the proteins fused GFP, which we described below. The cells in which the ratio of GFP fluorescence intensity of cytoplasm and nucleus was under 0.3 were defined as “only in the cytoplasm,” and the cells with the ratio of 0.3–0.8 were defined as “abundantly in the cytoplasm.” In the case the ratio was over 0.8, the cells were defined as “equally in the cytoplasm and the nucleus.” Immunoblotting and Kinase Assay—Plasmids (∼32 μg) were electroporated into COS-7 cells using a GenePulser (Bio-Rad, 975 microfarads, 220 mV) or transfected into NIH3T3 cells using FuGENE™6 transfection reagent. After being cultured, the cells were harvested and centrifuged at 5500 × g for 3 min. The cells were resuspended in homogenizing buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 200 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% TritonX-100, pH 7.4) and sonicated (UD-210 Tomy, Japan, output 3, 15 s, 2 times). For immunoblotting, the samples were subjected to 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by blotting onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by incubation with 5% skim milk in PBS-T at 4 °C overnight. The membrane was incubated with anti-GFP antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS-T, the membrane was incubated with peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson, ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 30 min. After three rinses with PBS-T, the immunoreactive bands were visualized using a chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). To determine the kinase activity of DGKγ and mutants, appropriate volumes of the homogenate samples, which contain comparative amounts of the fusion protein of DGKγ or mutants assessed by immunoblotting, were subjected to octyl glucoside mixed-micelle assay (14Sakane F. Imai S. Kai M. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8394-8401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) by subtle modification. 1-Steroyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) was used as substrate. The radioactivity of phosphatidic acid was separated on 20-cm Silica gel 60 TLC plates (Merck) using a chloroform:methanol:acetic acid (65:15:5) solution and detected by using a BAS2500 (Fujix, Tokyo, Japan) Measurement of the Diameter and Thickness of the Cells Transiently Expressing Fluorescent Proteins—Plasmids (∼5.5 μg) encoding GFP-DGKγ, GFP-DGKγ KN, GFP-DGKγ ΔC1B, GFP-DGKγ KNC1Am, and GFP alone were transfected into CHO-K1 cells by lipofection as described above. Diameters of the respective cells were measured by LSM510 soft ware under confocal microscopy. The thickness of the cells was measured using re-constructed image of three-dimensional sections. Production of Stable Cell Lines—Plasmids (∼5.5 μg) encoding GFP-DGKγ, GFP-DGKγ KN, GFP-DGKγ KNC1Am, and GFP alone were transfected by lipofection using FuGENE™6 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Geneticin (0.5 mg/ml) was added to the medium 24 h after the transfection. After being cultured for more than 24 h, the transfected cells were transferred to 96-well plates at 0.5 cell/well for cloning. The positive clone was identified by the fluorescence under confocal microscopy. Proliferation of Stable Cell Lines— 0.6 × 106 cells of each stable cell lines were split on three 10-cm dishes (0.2 × 106 each). After 24 (day 1), 48 (day 2), and 72 h (day 3), cells were treated with trypsin-EDTA after washed PBS(–) and collected by centrifugation (1250 × g for 10 min, at 4 °C). The harvested cells were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS(–), stained with 0.4% Trypan blue in PBS(–), and counted. The doubling time of the lines were calculated from simple regression based on the number of the cells. Difference of correlation coefficients of the regression lines was determined by testing the t value. Live Imaging of Cell Division of HeLa Cells Expressing CFP-NLS and CFP-DGKγKN-NLS—Plasmids encoding CFP-NLS and CFP-DGKγ KN-NLS were transfected into HeLa cells. Images of both phase contrast and CFP fluorescence were taken every 10 min from 24 to 72 h after transfection using fluorescent microscopy, BZ-8000 (Keyence, Osaka, Japan) equipped with cultivation system, INU-KI-F1 (Tokai Hit, Shizuoka, Japan). Based on the images, the doubling time of respective cells, the time period between the first and the second division, was measured. Flow Cytometry— 0.2 × 106 cells of each stable cell lines were spread on 10-cm dishes. The cells were synchronized at the beginning of S phase by double thymidine block and release protocol. Briefly, the cells were treated with 10 mm (for GFP stable cells) or 5 mm (for GFP-DGKγ KN stable cells) thymidine for the first 18 h, followed by an interval of thymidine-free incubation for 10 h, and the second thymidine incubation for 8 h (32Hirota T. Morisaki T. Nishiyama Y. Marumoto T. Tada K. Hara T. Masuko N. Inagaki M. Hatakeyama K. Saya H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1073-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To release the cell cycle, the cells were washed well and cultured in normal medium containing serum. Every hour after the release, cells were treated with trypsin-EDTA and collected in a 1.5-ml tube. Washed by PBS(–), the cells were fixed by 70% ethanol for 1 h on ice, and treated sequentially by 0.25 mg/ml RNase A and 0.05 mg/ml propidium iodide. Cell cycle analysis was performed by using a FACS-Calibur (BD Biosciences). Changes in Subcellular Localization of DGKγ—During the cultivation of CHO-K1 cells expressing GFP-DGKγ, we observed different localization of GFP-DGKγ; some cells had GFP-DGKγ in the nucleus and some did not. Specifically, just after the transfection many of the CHO-K1 cells express GFP-DGKγ only in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A, CHO-K1, type A) but 2–3 days later, this enzyme was localized equally in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 1A, CHO-K1, type B). Here, we considered the possibility that the nuclear localization of GFP-DGKγ was due to the degradation, because GFP itself is localized in the nucleus and the cytoplasm as shown in below in Fig. 4C. However, no degraded product of GFP-DGKγ was found even at day 3 by immunoblotting using GFP antibody (Fig. 1B), indicating that the enzyme is transported from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during cultivation. Therefore, we investigated time-dependent changes of GFP-DGKγ localization. Fig. 1C shows that the number of the CHO-K1 cells expressing GFP-DGKγ only in the cytoplasm (Type A) decreased, while the number of the cells expressing the fusion protein both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Type B) increased with time. Percentage of the type B CHO-K1 cells was 34% at day 1, but it increased to 53% at day 2. The ratio of type B to type A cells changed from 0.826 at day 1 to 2.790 at day 2. This ratio increased further to 3.110 at day 3. We also carried out the same experiment using NIH3T3 cells. In NIH3T3 cells, the percentage of the type A cells and that of the type B cells are similar at day 1, but the type B cells became the major population with time; it increased to 72% at day 2 and 86% at day 3 (Fig. 1C, NIH3T3). Furthermore, we performed this experiment using the neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y, because DGKγ are abundantly expressed in the brain. In SH-SY5Y cells, DGKγ also showed different types of the localization (Fig. 1A, SH-SY5Y, type A and type B). Percentage of the type B SH-SY5Y cells was 47% at day 1, and it was 52.2% at day 2 with the change in ratio from 1.395 to 2.373 (Fig. 1C, SH-SY5Y). Finally, the ratio reached 4.183 at day 3. These results indicate that DGKγ is transported to the nucleus depending on cultivation periods in all cell lines tested.FIGURE 4Localization of the C1 domain and its fragments of DGKγ in CHO-K1 cells. A, schematic illustration of the C1 domain and its fragments used. C1 domain is from 269 to 380 aa, C1A domain plus Hinge is from 269 to 333 aa, Hinge plus C1B domain is from 319 to 380 aa, C1A domain is from 269 to 318 aa, Hinge is from 319 to 333 aa and C1B domain is from 334 to 380 aa of rat DGKγ.

The FLAG fusion proteins were detected by mouse anti-FLAG antibody and Cy3-labeled anti-mouse IgG. C, localization of GFP-tagged C1 domain in CHO-K1 cells. Plasmids of GFP-C1 domain of DGKγ and GFP was transfected into CHO-K1 cells and fixed 24 h after the transfection. The fluorescence was detected by confocal microscopy.

Immunoblotting using anti-GFP antibody revealed that each mutant had appropriate molecular size (Fig. 2B) and that no significant degraded products were detected. Fig. 2C shows that GFP-DGKγ had kinase activity, whereas DGKγ fused GFP at the N terminus (DGKγ-GFP) had no activity as previously reported (28Shirai Y. Segawa S. Kuriyama M. Goto K. Sakai N. Saito N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24760-24766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The mutants having mutations in the C1A or C1B domains (GFP-DGKγ C1Am and C1Bm) and lacking the C1A or C1B domain (GFP-DGKγ ΔC1A and ΔC1B) showed lower but significant activity than wild-type GFP-DGKγ. Interestingly, mutation in the C1A domain rather than in the C1B domain affected the kinase activity. All the kinase-negative mutants, GFP-DGKγ KN, KNC1Am, and KNC1Bm, whose Gly-491 in the ATP binding site was replaced to Asp, showed no kinase activity. Despite no kinase activities, both GFP-DGKγ KN and DGKγ-GFP were localized in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm of CHO-K1 cells, but the transportation of GFP-DGKγ KN into the nucleus was slower than wild type (Fig. 3, GFP-DGKγ and GFP-DGKγ KN). On the other hand, GFP-DGKγ C1Am and C1Bm did not show the increase in the number of cells expressing the mutants equally in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, although they possessed significant kinase activity (Fig. 3, GFP-DGKγ C1Am and GFP-DGKγ C1Bm). Similarly, GFP-DGKγ ΔC1A, ΔC1B, KNC1Am, and KNC1Bm did not change their localization (Fig. 3, GFP-DGKγ ΔC1A, GFP-DGKγ ΔC1B, GFP-DGKγ KNC1Am, and GFP-DGKγ KNC1Bm). Table 1 summarizes the kinase activities of the mutants and their transportation to the nucleus. These results show that there is no significant correlation between the kinase activity and the nuclear transportation, suggesting that nuclear transportation of DGKγ does not require its kinase activity.TABLE 1The activity of GFP-DGKγ, DGKγ-GFP, and mutants and their nuclear localization in CHO-K1 cellsThe activity of DGKLocalization in the nucleusGFP-DGKγ+++++GFP-DGKγKN-+DGKγ-GFP-+GFP-DGKγC1Am++-GFP-DGKγC1Bm++-GFP-DGKγΔC1A+-GFP-DGKγΔC1B+++-GFP-DGKγKNC1Am--GFP-DGKγKNC1Bm-- Open table in a new tab On the other hand, as seen in the cases of GFP-DGKγ C1Am, C1Bm, ΔC1A, and ΔC1B and GFP-DGKγ KNC1Am and KNC1Bm, mutation in the C1A or C1B domains eliminated the nuclear transportation of DGKγ, suggesting that the C1 domain is important for the nuclear transportation of DGKγ and contains a nuclear transport signal. To confirm the function of C1 domain as a nuclear transport signal and identify which part of the C1 domain is important for the function, we generated six fragments from the C1 domain fused with FLAG; entire C1 domain, C1A domain plus Hinge, Hinge plus C1B domain, C1A domain, Hinge and C1B domain (Fig. 4A) and investigated their localization using FLAG antibody. The entire C1 domain was dominantly localized in the nucleus but the other fragments did not show nuclear localization (Fig. 4B). Similarly, GFP-tagged C1 domain was localized specifically in the nucleus, whereas GFP alone was seen throughout the cells (Fig. 4C). These results represent that the entire C1 domain is necessary to act as a nuclear localization signal at least in DGKγ. Physiological Functions of Nuclear DGKγ—To investigate physiological function of DGKγ in the nucleus, we first measured the size of CHO-K1 cells transiently expressing GFP, GFP-DGKγ, or GFP-DGKγ KN, because we had noticed that the size of cells expressing DGKγ KN were bigger than that of cells expressing wild-type DGKγ. Apparently, the diameter of the typical CHO-K1 cells expressing GFP and GFP-DGKγ was 20–30 μm, whereas that of GFP-DGKγ KN was 30–40μm (Fig. 5, left side), suggesting the importance of DGKγ activity in cell shape. However, it is not clear whether the difference in the cell size was due to the"

Here, we investigated the consequences of aminolauryl (NC12) conjugation to the dermaseptin derivative K4-S4-(1-13) (P) on binding properties to bilayer models mimicking bacterial plasma membrane, which is often cited as the ultimate site of action. Isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that acylation was responsible for enhancing the binding affinity of NC12-P compared with P (K = 13 × 105 and 1.5 × 105 m-1, respectively). Surface plasmon resonance measurements confirmed the isothermal titration calorimetry results (Kapp = 12.6 × 105 and 1.53 × 105 m-1, respectively) and further indicated that enhanced adhesion affinity (Kadhesion = 3 × 105 and 1 × 105 m-1, respectively) was coupled to enhanced tendency to insert within the bilayer (Kinsertion = 4.5 and 1.5, respectively). To gain insight into the molecular basis for these observations, we investigated the three-dimensional structures in the presence of dodecylphosphocholine using NMR. The ensemble of NMR-calculated structures (backbone root mean square deviation <0.6 Å) showed that the acyl moiety was responsible for a significant molecular reorganization, possibly affecting the electrostatic potential distribution in NC12-P relative to that of P. The combined data present compelling evidence in support of the hypothesis that N-acylation affects antimicrobial properties by modifying the secondary structure of the peptide in a manner that facilitates contact with the membrane and consequently increases its disruption.

Various potential targets other than the cytoplasmic membrane have also been proposed; AMPs were shown to activate microbicidal activities of leukocytes (8Ammar B. Perianin A. Mor A. Sarfati G.

Clearly, the externally localized site of action and receptor-independent mechanism of AMPs may significantly reduce or prevent development of drug-resistance. However, since this mechanism is also largely responsible for unselective activity over a wide range of cell types, only topical therapeutic applications have been considered so far (19Chen J. Falla T.J. Liu H. Hurst M.A. Fujii C.A. Mosca D.A. Embree J.R. Loury D.J. Radel P.A. Cheng C.C. Gu L. Fiddes J.C. Biopolymers. 2000; 55: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 20Ge Y.

Thus, a major challenge toward the safe use of AMPs is to improve our understanding of the mechanism of action and consequently conceive AMPs with an increased therapeutic index. Numerous strategies have been adopted toward this goal, including synthetic combinatorial libraries (21Blondelle S.E. Lohner K. Biopolymers. 2000; 55: 74-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), extracting sequence patterns after comparing to natural counterparts (22Tossi A. Tarantino C. Romeo D. Eur. J.

Various attempts were made to modify natural peptides or assemble chimeric peptides from segments of different natural peptides (10Scott M.G. Rosenberger C.M. Gold M.R. Finlay B.B. Hancock R.E. J.

Last, naturally occurring AMPs characterized by a lipophilic acyl chain at the N terminus were discovered in various microorganisms (27Peggion C. Formaggio F. Crisma M. Epand R.F. Epand R.M. Toniolo C. J. Pept. Sci. 2003; 9: 679-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Moreover, acyl conjugation to certain AMPs proved a useful technique for improving antimicrobial characteristics (28Avrahami D. Shai Y.

Bacteria were shown to develop resistance to commercial antibiotics but not to the l- or d-isomers of the dermaseptin derivatives (37Navon-Venezia S. Feder R. Gaidukov L. Carmeli Y. Mor A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 689-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Various acylated derivatives were investigated for their effect on malaria-infected red blood cells, taking advantage of their ability to translocate spontaneously across the plasma membrane of mammalian cells (38Hariton-Gazal E. Feder R. Mor A. Graessmann A. Brack-Werner R. Jans D. Gilon C. Loyter A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9208-9214Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although certain acylated dermaseptin derivatives displayed increased specific antiparasitic efficiency combined with reduced hemolysis of infected or normal erythrocytes (30Efron L. Dagan A. Gaidukov L. Ginsburg H. Mor A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24067-24072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), acylation, in general, was shown to enhance hemolysis, antiprotozoan activity, and antibacterial activity against Gram-positive but not Gram-negative bacteria (39Radzishevsky I.S. Rotem S. Zaknoon F. Gaidukov L. Dagan A. Mor A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 2412-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, the corresponding aminoacyl analogs behaved essentially the same as the nonaminated acyl counterparts but displayed enhanced activity against all microorganisms tested, including Gram-negative bacteria (39Radzishevsky I.S. Rotem S. Zaknoon F. Gaidukov L. Dagan A. Mor A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 2412-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). A general correlation between increased potency and increased secondary structure was reported for various AMPs (32Mak P. Pohl J. Dubin A. Reed M.S. Bowers S.E. Fallon M.T. Shafer W.M. Int. J.

Rivas L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 2441-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), antifungal activity (28Avrahami D. Shai Y.

Agents. 2003; 21: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas a variety of studies report that antimicrobial activity of AMPs can be enhanced through conjugation to an acyl moiety, the underlying molecular basis is far from being fully understood. To explore this issue, the 13-mer dermaseptin S4 derivative, K4-S4-(1-13), was conjugated to either aminolauryl or lauryl moieties and probed in terms of binding and structural properties compared with the acyl-free peptide.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPeptides—The peptides were synthesized by the solid phase method applying the Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl) active ester chemistry on an Applied Biosystems model 433A peptide synthesizer. 4-Methylbenzhydrylamine resin (Novabiochem, Darmstadt, Germany) was used to obtain amidated peptides. The acylated analogs were prepared by linking the amino terminus of the peptides to lauric or aminolauric acid, as described (39Radzishevsky I.S. Rotem S. Zaknoon F. Gaidukov L. Dagan A. Mor A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 2412-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The crude peptide was purified to ≥95% chromatographic homogeneity by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (LC-MS Alliance-ZQ Waters). The purified peptides were subjected to mass spectrometry analysis to confirm their composition. Peptides were stocked as lyophilized powder at -20 °C. Prior to testing, fresh solutions were prepared in water, briefly vortexed, sonicated, centrifuged, and then diluted with the appropriate medium. Buffers were prepared with distilled water (mQ; Millipore Corp.). All other reagents were analytical grade.Liposome Preparation—Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) composed of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3 phosphoglycerol (POPC/POPG, 3:1 molar ratio) were prepared in PBS by the sonication method as per the manufacturer's (Avanti Polar) instructions using a G112SP1 bath sonicator (Laboratory Supplies Company Inc.) to give a translucent solution of vesicles with a mean diameter of 20 nm as measured by dynamic light scattering using a BI-200SM Research Goniometer System (Brookhaven Instruments Corp.). Liposomes were suspended in PBS buffer, pH 7.4, and measurements were performed at 25 °C.Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—Experiments were performed using a calorimeter (Microcal, Northampton, MA) calibrated electronically. Heats of dilution were determined in control experiments by injecting either peptide solution or lipid suspension into buffer. The heats of dilution were subtracted from the heats determined in the corresponding peptide-lipid binding experiments. Each peptide (12 μm) was titrated with 5-μl injections of 38 mm POPC/POPG (3:1) SUVs in PBS buffer, pH 7.4, at 25 °C. Enthalpy changes for each injection were integrated and fitted using the one-binding site algorithm (Microcal Origin, version 5.0).Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)—Peptides binding to phospholipid membranes was determined using the optical biosensor system (BIA-core 2000, Uppsala, Sweden). Experiments, analysis of binding kinetics, and the resulting affinity constants were performed and determined as described (42Gaidukov L. Fish A. Mor A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12866-12874Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).NMR Measurements—Samples in lyophilized form were dissolved at a 20:1 molar ratio of DPC-d38 (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc.) to peptide in 10% PBS and 10% deuterium oxide (Aldrich). The NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker Avance 600-MHz DMX spectrometer operating at the proton frequency of 600.13 MHz using a 5-mm selective probe equipped with a self-shielded xyz-gradient coil. The transmitter frequency was set on the HDO signal, which was calibrated at 4.725 ppm. TOSCY (44Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar), DQF COSY (45Derome A. Williamson M. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 88: 177-185Google Scholar), and NOESY (46Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar) experiments were acquired as described (40Kustanovich I. Shalev D.E. Mikhlin M. Gaidukov L. Mor A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16941-16951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A range of temperatures between 277 and 305 K was examined to find optimal conditions for the NMR measurements. Structural data were acquired at 303.0 K in order to reduce the viscosity of the lipid phase. TOCSY spectra were recorded using the MLEV-17 pulse scheme for the spin lock at mixing periods of 45-75 ms with 80 scans per t1 increment (47Bax A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 223-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The NOESY experiments were collected with six mixing times ranging from 50 to 300 ms in order to gain maximal NOE buildup with a minimal contribution from spin diffusion. The buildup curves were examined for all of the amide protons and the tryptophan aromatic protons, and structural data were subsequently acquired with a mixing time of 150 ms using 160 transients for each t1. A list of NOE restraints used is available from the authors.Spectra were processed and analyzed with the XWINNMR and Viewer software packages (Bruker Analytische Messtechnik GmbH) and SPARKY (provided by T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, SPARKY 3; University of California, San Francisco) on a Silicon Graphics Indigo2 R10000 work station. Zero filling in the t1 dimension and data apodization with a shifted squared sine bell window function in both dimensions were applied prior to Fourier transformation.

The internal peptide dielectric value was 5.0, and when the solution dielectric was varied between 5.0 and 40 to reflect the lipid environment, there was no significant change in the shapes of the calculated electrostatic potential distribution, although their values differed.

The identity of the synthetic products was confirmed by mass spectrometry post purification. Peptide purities were ≥95% as determined by analytical HPLC and subsequently by NMR (data not shown).TABLE 1Primary structure of peptides investigatedPeptideDesignationSequenceK4S4-(1–13)PALWKTLLKKVLKANH2Lauryl-K4S4-(1–13)C12-PC12-ALWKTLLKKVLKANH2Aminolauryl-K4S4-(1–13)NC12-PNC12-ALWKTLLKKVLKANH2 Open table in a new tab ITC—The ability of the peptides to bind to liposomes was compared by titrating a solution of each peptide (12 μm) with a suspension of SUVs. Dynamic light scattering measurements indicated that the liposome size was 25 ± 5 μm and remained unchanged in the presence of the highest peptide concentration used in the titration experiment (data not shown). Fig. 1A depicts the interaction of a representative peptide with the anionic liposomes. Fig. 1B shows the enthalpy changes for each injection shown in Fig. 1A, integrated and fit using a single binding site algorithm. Table 2 summarizes the affinity constants obtained for the dermaseptin derivatives. The acyl-free peptide displayed a binding constant of 1.5 × 105 m-1, but the acylated peptides displayed unambiguously higher affinities, with K values of 13.0 × 105 and 3.1 × 105 m-1, respectively, for NC12-P and C12-P. The derivative C12-P displayed an affinity that was surprisingly 4-fold lower than its aminated analog and (unlike NC12-P) was found to be aggregated at the peptide concentration used with a critical micelle concentration of ∼0.1 μm (39Radzishevsky I.S.

Peptide solutions were passed over the immobilized lipid surface, and the changes in the resonance signal during the binding process (composed of association and dissociation phases) were detected, reflecting the accompanying changes in the mass during the reaction. The membrane-binding affinities of the dermaseptin derivatives were analyzed with a two-stage model. A two-stage reaction describes the binding process involving a conformational change that gradually leads to a more stable complex. This model portrays the interaction of antimicrobial peptides with lipid bilayers as a two-stage process comprising surface adhesion and membrane insertion. The insertion stage, which takes place after the initial adhesion of the peptide to the membrane surface, is consistent with a conformational change that occurs in the peptide-membrane complex and leads to increased stability of the complex. The binding profile obtained for NC12-P is portrayed in Fig. 2A. The binding levels increased as a function of peptide concentration, which is indicative of a specific interaction between the peptide and the phospholipid membrane. Table 2 summarizes the kinetic rate constants and the derived affinity constants obtained for the interaction of P and NC12-P as determined using integrated equations of a two-step model. The individual affinity constants of each step of the interaction were calculated as the ratio of the respective association and dissociation rate constants. The association affinity constant of the first step of the interaction, Kadhesion, indicates the affinity of the peptide for adhering to the membrane surface, whereas Kinsertion is a unitless constant that reflects the tendency of the peptide to insert into the membrane (or efficacy of bilayer penetration by the peptide) and is referred to as the insertion affinity (42Gaidukov L. Fish A. Mor A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12866-12874Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The apparent affinity constant for the global interaction, Kapp, is a product of the individual affinity constants: Kapp = Kadhesion × Kinsertion.FIGURE 2Binding properties based on SPR.

Plasma membrane blebbing, mitochondrial depolarization, externalization of phosphatidylserine, and nuclear permeability changes can all be observed within 15 min of treatment. However, there is no activation of caspases or chromatin condensation. Expression of a fusion protein containing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and human cytosolic Group IVA phospholipase A(2)alpha (EGFP-cPLA(2)alpha) in these cells prevents ionomycin-induced phosphatidylserine externalization and death. Cells expressing the cPLA(2)alpha mutant D43N, which does not bind calcium, retain their susceptibility to ionomycin-induced cell death. Both nonexpressing and EGFP-D43N-cPLA(2)alpha-expressing human embryonic kidney cells can be spared from ionomycin-induced cell death by pretreating them with exogenous arachidonic acid. Moreover, during calcium overload, mitochondrial depolarization is significantly lower in the EGFP-cPLA(2)alpha-expressing cells than in cells expressing normal amounts of cPLA(2)alpha. These results suggest that early cell death events promoted by an overload of calcium can be prevented by the presence of high levels of arachidonic acid."

In addition to regulating several effector proteins, Gβγ subunits help anchor Gα subunits to the plasma membrane, promote interaction of Gα with receptors, stabilize the binding of GDP to Gα to suppress spurious activation, and provide membrane contact points for G protein-coupled receptor kinases. Gβγ subunits have also been shown to inhibit the activities of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), both phospholipase C (PLC)-βs and RGS proteins, when assayed in solution under single turnover conditions. We show here that Gβγ subunits inhibit G protein GAP activity during receptor-stimulated, steady-state GTPase turnover. GDP/GTP exchange catalyzed by receptor requires Gβγ in amounts approximately equimolar to Gα, but GAP inhibition was observed with superstoichiometric Gβγ. The potency of inhibition varied with the GAP and the Gα subunit, but half-maximal inhibition of the GAP activity of PLC-β1 was observed with 5–10 nm Gβγ, which is at or below the concentrations of Gβγ needed for regulation of physiologically relevant effector proteins. The kinetics of GAP inhibition of both receptor-stimulated GTPase activity and single turnover, solution-based GAP assays suggested a competitive mechanism in which Gβγ competes with GAPs for binding to the activated, GTP-bound Gα subunit. An N-terminal truncation mutant of PLC-β1 that cannot be directly regulated by Gβγ remained sensitive to inhibition of its GAP activity, suggesting that the Gβγ binding site relevant for GAP inhibition is on the Gα subunit rather than on the GAP. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer between cyan or yellow fluorescent protein-labeled G protein subunits and Alexa532-labeled RGS4, we found that Gβγ directly competes with RGS4 for high-affinity binding to Gαi-GDP-AlF4.

Gβγ subunits perform diverse roles in G protein-mediated signaling, almost all of which are based on their regulated binding to Gα. Gβγ binds most tightly to the GDP-bound form of Gα, usually considered the inactive conformation. Because Gβγ and GDP bind positively cooperatively to Gα,Gβγ stabilizes GDP binding and thus suppresses spontaneous Gα activation. Conversely, GDP stabilizes Gβγ binding and suppresses its ability to spontaneously regulate effector proteins. In contrast, Gβγ binds least tightly to the GTP-bound, activated conformation of Gα. Such negative cooperative binding permits Gβγ to regulate effectors during G protein activation. In solution, activation of Gα by a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog can drive physical dissociation of Gβγ (1Kuhn H. Nature. 1980; 283: 587-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 2Fung B.K. J.

This implies that the Gα-GTP-Gβγ complex somehow exposes the sites on Gα and Gβγ necessary for productive interaction with effector proteins while they remain bound to each other.

Gβγ also binds a diverse collection of other proteins: G protein-coupled receptor kinases, phosducin, AGS1, and receptors (6Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). In addition to its other functions, Gβγ subunits have been shown to inhibit the activity of G protein GAPs in solution-phase, single turnover assays (17Wang J. Tu Y. Woodson J. Song X. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5732-5740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 18Wang J. Frost J.A. Cobb M.H. Ross E.M. J. Biol.

GAPs can thereby inhibit steady-state signaling, accelerate signal termination when receptor agonist is removed, alter receptor selectivity among G proteins, and/or suppress basal (receptor-independent) signal output (see Ref. 20Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar for review). Gβγ inhibits the GAP activity of both RGS proteins and phospholipase C-βs and inhibits GAP activity toward all Gα subunits tested. The potency and extent of inhibition vary considerably among GAPs and Gα targets. The physiological function of GAP inhibition by Gβγ is intriguing and presently unclear. It may represent a way to shield Gα-GTP from deactivation until it encounters an effector protein, or it may support continued activation in cases where Gβγ does not physically dissociate from Gα-GTP. The mechanism of inhibition is also not known in detail. We initially speculated that Gβγ might inhibit GAP activity by binding Gα-GTP and thus blocking the GAP binding site, but the relatively low concentrations of Gβγ that effectively inhibited several GAPs seemed inconsistent with the presumed low affinity of Gβγ for Gα-GTP. Gβγ might also interact directly with GAPs. Binding of Gβγ to RGS proteins has not been observed, but Gβγ does bind PLC-β and thus stimulate its phospholipatic activity. It was unknown whether the sites that cause phospholipase activation and GAP inhibition are identical. We have now examined the mechanism whereby Gβγ inhibits G protein GAP activity using both enzyme kinetic approaches and direct optical measurements of Gα-RGS binding and dissociation. We find that Gβγ inhibits GAPs by competitively binding to Gα-GTP. In the case of PLC-β, the Gβγ binding site that mediates PLC stimulation is not required for inhibition of GAP activity. Gβγ binds Gα-GTP with unexpectedly high affinity, with values of Kd well within the range of concentrations of Gβγ associated with regulation of its effectors. Thus Gβγ may protect Gα subunits from GAP-accelerated deactivation, and Gβγ from one heterotrimer may exert this effect on a heterologous Gα. Proteins—m1AChR and m2AChR, Gαq, Gαz, Gβ1γ2, and PLC-βs were expressed in Sf9 cells and purified as described (21Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol.

RGS4-197, a mutant RGS4 in which all cysteine residues except Cys197 were removed, was constructed by several rounds of QuikChange mutagenesis of the cDNA in the pGEX-2 expression vector. RGS4-197 displays essentially wild-type GAP activity both before and after its reaction with maleimides at the sole remaining cysteine residue. Mutant and wild-type RGS4 were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusions using the pGEX-2 vector. For production of wildtype and mutant RGS4, transformed BL21DE3/pREP4 cells were grown in T7 medium (containing ampicillin, kanamycin, and isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside) for 6 h. Cell pellets were frozen in liquid N2. Bacteria were thawed on ice and incubated with 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme in Buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min on ice. After sonication (three 1-min bursts), the suspension was centrifuged at 4 °C at 15,000 × g for 40 min. The supernatant was diluted 1:2 with Buffer A and mixed with glutathione-agarose for 2 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed with Buffer A and Buffer A plus 0.1% Lubrol plus 90 mm NaCl. Finally, the resin was equilibrated in 0.1 mm CaCl2, removed from the column, and mixed with 4 μl/ml thrombin for 17–18 h at 4 °C. The resin was returned to the column and eluted with another 2 volumes of Buffer A plus 0.1% Lubrol, concentrated by ultrafiltration, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at –80 °C. RGS4-197 was labeled with the thiol-reactive probe, Alexa532-C5-maleimide, which does not change its activity as a Gq GAP. Prior to labeling, RGS4-197 (800 μg) was dialyzed with 3000 volumes of buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% Lubrol) to remove dithiothreitol. A 10-fold molar excess of probe was added and incubated for 45 min at 0 °C, and the reaction was quenched with β-mercaptoethanol. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 4 °C at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was applied to a G-25 gel filtration column (30 ml). Peak fractions were pooled, concentrated, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at –80 °C. Labeling efficiency was determined according to the protein concentration (26Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1949) Google Scholar) and the absorption of Alexa532 at 528 nm (∈ = 78,000 cm–1m–1). Unilamellar receptor-G protein vesicles were reconstituted as described previously (21Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7999-8007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Vesicles were incubated with 5 mm dithiothreitol at 0 °C for1hto activate receptors (21Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7999-8007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The concentration of receptors in the vesicles was assayed by [3H]quinuclidinylbenzilate binding (27Berstein G. Blank J.L. Smrcka A.V. Higashijima T. Sternweis P.C. Exton J.H. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8081-8088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor-coupled Gα was measured according to carbachol-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding (21Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7999-8007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Functional Assays—Single turnover GAP assays, which measure acceleration of the hydrolysis of a preformed complex of Gα-[γ32P]GTP in detergent solution, were performed as described previously (28Wang J. Tu Y. Mukhopadhyay S. Chidiac P. Biddlecome G.H. Ross E.M. G Proteins: Techniques of Analysis.in: Manning D.R. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1999: 124-151Google Scholar). Temperature, which was varied for some experiments, and concentrations used for specific experiments are given in the figure legends. Steady-state GAP activity was determined according to the increase in agonist-stimulated GTPase activity in phospholipid vesicles that contained trimeric Gαβ1γ2 and receptor (28Wang J. Tu Y. Mukhopadhyay S. Chidiac P. Biddlecome G.H. Ross E.M. G Proteins: Techniques of Analysis.in: Manning D.R. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1999: 124-151Google Scholar). To measure the rate of hydrolysis of Gq-bound GTP under the conditions of steady-state turnover, m1AchR-Gq vesicles and agonist were first mixed in assay buffer (21Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7999-8007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) for 25 min at 10 °C to allow association of receptor and Gq. An aliquot (20 μl) was then mixed with 5 μl of assay buffer that contained carbachol and [γ-32P]GTP (300 nm final concentration). The mixture was incubated for 1 min to steady-state hydrolysis and allow accumulation initiate of Gq-[γ-32P]GTP without excessive production of background [32P]Pi. At this point, defined as t = 0, further [γ-32P]GTP binding was quenched by a 1:2 dilution with 2 mm nonradioactive GTP, 2 mm atropine, and the indicated concentration of PLC-β1. Hydrolysis of bound [γ-32P]GTP was quenched at the appropriate times as described (28Wang J. Tu Y. Mukhopadhyay S. Chidiac P. Biddlecome G.H. Ross E.M. G Proteins: Techniques of Analysis.in: Manning D.R. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1999: 124-151Google Scholar). Release of [32P]Pi was fitted to a single exponential equation to yield the rate constant khydrol. To measure the rate of GDP dissociation, [α-32P]GDP was first bound to m1AChR-Gq vesicles by incubation with 2 μm [α-32P]GDP, 1 mm carbachol, and 10 nm PLC-β1, with or without Gβ1γ2, for 15 min at 15 °C. Aliquots of this mixture were diluted with antagonist and 5 mm unlabeled GTP, dissociation was allowed to proceed for various times, and bound [α-32P]GDP was measured as described (21Biddlecome G.H. Berstein G. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7999-8007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) Phospholipase activity was determined according to hydrolysis of [3 H]PIP2 added as mixed micelles (27Berstein G. Blank J.L. Smrcka A.V. Higashijima T. Sternweis P.C. Exton J.H. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8081-8088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 10 min. Gβ1γ 2 2-stimulated activity was determined in the presence of 1 μm free Ca +. Gαq-stimulated activity was measured in the presence of Gαq that has been activated previously by incubation with GTPγS (29Chidiac P. Markin V.S. Ross E.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) plus 200 nm free Ca 2+. Fluorescence Measurements—Equilibrium fluorescence measurements were performed on a SPEX Fluorolog 211 spectrophotometer using a 3-mm cuvette with both excitation and emission slits set at 1.25 mm. Gαi1-CFP was diluted in 200 μlof20mm NaHepes, pH 8.0, 3 μm GDP, 10 μm AlCl3, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm NaF at 25 °C. After the addition of RGS4-197Fl, the mixture was incubated for 2 min, and fluorescence was recorded between 460 and 580 nm with excitation at 431 nm. FRET between Gαi1-CFP and RGS4-197Fl was measured as the enhancement of RGS4-197Fl emission at 552 nm or the decrease of Gαi1-CFP emission at 475 nm over the sum of both components at the same concentrations. The individual emission intensities of both Gαi1-CFP and RGS4-197Fl (both excited at 431 nm) were scaled for concentration and subtracted from total observed fluorescence to give a measure of FRET intensity. Dissociation of Gαi1-CFP and RGS4-197Fl was assayed in the same buffer used for equilibrium experiments. Fluorescence stopped flow measurements were performed using a Bio-Logic SFM3 stopped flow mixer in which syringe, mixing chambers, and delay lines are all under thermostat control. Gαi1-CFP (20 nm) was incubated with 200 nm RGS4-197Fl in one syringe of the mixer for at least 2 min at 25 °C. An aliquot of this mixture (50 μl) was mixed with an equal volume of 500 nm nonfluorescent Gαi1 in the presence or absence of 1 μm Gβ1γ2. Dissociation was measured by the loss of transferred acceptor fluorescence at 10-ms intervals in a 30-μl cuvette. Excitation was set at 431 nm using a monochromator, and emission was measured using a 520 nm cut-off filter. Gβγ inhibits the GAP activities of RGS proteins and PLC-β (17Wang J. Tu Y. Woodson J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19639-19643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), modulates nucleotide binding to Gα, and is required essentially for G protein regulation by receptors (6Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). We therefore asked how Gβγ alters interactive regulation by receptors and GAPs during steady-state GTPase turnover, which includes all three processes. As shown in Fig. 1A, excess Gβ1γ2 markedly and potently inhibited steady-state GTPase activity in a coupled system composed of a receptor, a trimeric G protein, and a GAP. In the case of Gq, m1AChR, and PLC-β1, inhibition was nearly complete, to about the level observed without a GAP (compare with Fig. 1B). Inhibition was maximal at 50 nm Gβγ and displayed an IC50 of about 5 nm above the amount of Gβγ already included in the vesicles as part of the Gq heterotrimer (∼2nm). Gβγ inhibition of GAP activity during steady-state GTPase turnover is thus more potent than during a single catalytic cycle (19Chidiac P. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19639-19643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Onset of inhibition was rapid upon the addition of Gβγ (at 5 min in Fig. 1) and displayed no obvious lag. Qualitatively similar fast and complete inhibition was observed when PLC-β3 was used as the GAP (not shown) or when the test system was composed of m2AChR, Gz, and either RGS4 (see Fig. 3B) or RGS-Z1 (not shown). In contrast, receptor-stimulated GTPase activity in the absence of GAP was essentially insensitive to inhibition by Gβγ (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the site of inhibition is associated with the GAP rather than the receptor.FIGURE 3Effect of Gβγ on GAP potency. A, carbachol-stimulated GTPase activity in m1AChR-Gq vesicles was measured in the presence of the indicated concentrations of PLC-β1 (○, •) or RGS4 (•, □) either with no addition (open symbols) or with 100 nm excess Gβγ (closed symbols). EC50 values obtained from fits to single-site saturation functions for PLC-β1 and RGS4 were 1.7 and 29 nm without Gβγ and 6.3 and 106 nm with Gβγ, respectively. B, carbachol-stimulated GTPase activity in m2AChR-Gz vesicles was measured in the presence of the indicated concentrations of RGS4 either with no addition (○), with 100 nm excess Gβγ (•), or with 100 nm Gβγ and 500 nm phosducin (▴). EC50 values were 7 nm without added Gβγ, 33 nm with Gβγ, and 12 nm with Gβγ plus phosducin. Each experiment was repeated three times with similar results. C, steady-state GTPase activity was measured in the presence of 2 nm PLC-β1 and the indicated concentrations of carbachol with either no addition (○) or with 100 nm Gβγ (•). After fitting to a single-site activation model (solid lines), EC50 values for carbachol were 32 μm with or without Gβγ.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Inhibition of steady-state GTPase by Gβγ predominantly reflects inhibition of the GAP-accelerated GTP hydrolysis reaction itself rather than of other steps in the GTPase catalytic cycle. Gβγ significantly inhibited hydrolysis of Gαq-GTP in the vesicles (Fig. 2). Excess Gβγ did not alter the receptor-promoted dissociation of GDP from G protein (Fig. 2, inset), the other relatively slow step in the GTPase cycle (30Mukhopadhyay S. Ross E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9539-9544Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Thus, the modest effect of Gβγ in the single turnover assay (Fig. 2) is magnified when GAP activity is measured at steady-state (Fig. 1). For both RGS proteins and PLC-β, Gβγ added to the receptor-G protein vesicles increased the amount of GAP needed to accelerate GTPase hydrolysis but had little if any effect on the maximal hydrolytic rate that could be attained. In a single turnover assay of GTP hydrolysis in vesicles, Gβγ increased the EC50 for PLC-β1 by more than 4-fold (Fig. 2). Gβγ also shifted the concentration dependence of GAP activity during steady-state hydrolysis stimulated by agonist-bound receptor. Similar effects were observed with RGS4 or PLC-β1 (Fig. 3A). Vesicles that contained m2AChR and Gz showed similar shifts in RGS4 potency in the presence of Gβγ (Fig. 3B). In each case, the maximal GTPase activity at high GAP concentration was about the same with or without Gβγ, but the EC50 for GAP was increased 4–6-fold. In contrast to its effects on GAP potency, excess Gβγ had no effect on the potency of agonistbound receptor to accelerate steady-state GDP/GTP exchange (Fig. 3C), again indicating that Gβγ acts primarily at the GAP-promoted hydrolytic step of the GTPase cycle rather than at GDP/GTP exchange. Gβγ Inhibits GAP Activity by a Km-based Mechanism—According to x-ray crystallographic structures, the two surfaces of Gα that interact with Gβγ and RGS proteins overlap substantially. These surfaces include both the switch regions and the N-terminal helix (22Wang J. Ducret A. Tu Y. Kozasa T. Aebersold R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26014-26025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 31Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 38260-38267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Inhibition might thus reflect competition between Gβγ and GAP for binding to Gα-GTP, although affinity of Gβγ for Gα-GTP is low. Alternatively, inhibition could result from an allosteric decrease of GAP-Gα affinity caused by the binding of Gβγ to the GAP-Gα-GTP complex. An increase in Km without a change in Vmax is the hallmark of competitive inhibition, but it is also characteristic of a negative cooperative interaction between inhibitor and substrate. We therefore examined the effect of Gβγ on the Km of RGS-Z1 and RGS4, using Gαz-GTP as substrate because the Km for these reactions is substantially lower than for other GAP-Gα pairs. For both RGS-Z1 and RGS4, the major effect of Gβγ was to increase the Km, with a much smaller or negligible effect on Vmax (Fig. 4). This pattern was observed when Km and Vmax were determined by varying the concentration of either Gαz-GTP or the GAP. The increase in Km by added Gβγ was mirrored by an increase in the concentration of Gβγ needed to inhibit the reaction at higher concentrations o"

In turn, TFIIIB recruits pol III to the promoter and specifies transcription initiating 17-19 base pairs upstream of box A. The resolution of the pol III transcription apparatus into recombinant TFIIIB, highly purified TFIIIC, and pol III is accompanied by a loss of precision in specifying where transcription initiation occurs due to heterogeneous placement of TFIIIB. In this paper we show that Nhp6a, an abundant high mobility group B (HMGB) family, non-sequence-specific DNA-binding protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae restores transcriptional initiation fidelity to this highly purified in vitro system. Restoration of initiation fidelity requires the presence of Nhp6a prior to TFIIIB-DNA complex formation. Chemical nuclease footprinting of TFIIIC- and TFIIIB-TFIIIC-DNA complexes reveals that Nhp6a markedly alters the TFIIIC footprint over box A and reduces the size of the TFIIIB footprint on upstream DNA sequence.

TFIIIC is a 520-kDa protein, containing six distinct subunits arranged into two globular subdomains, τA (subunits Tfc1, Tfc4, and Tfc7) and τB (subunits Tfc3, Tfc6, and Tfc8), which are connected by a flexible linker (Tfc8; see Refs. 1White R.J. RNA Polymerase III Transcription. 3rd. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX2002Google Scholar, 2Geiduschek E.P. Kassavetis G.A. J. Mol.

TFIIIC binds to two intragenic sequence elements, the start site-proximal box A (binding τA) and the distal box B (binding τB), which are optimally separated by 30-60 bp. The τB-box B interaction contributes nearly all of the affinity of TFIIIC for tRNA genes (KD <1 nm) (4Baker R.E. Gabrielsen O. Hall B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5275-5282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is the weak τA-box A interaction that primarily specifies initiation 17-19 bp upstream of box A (5Zecherle G.N. Whelen S. Hall B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5801-5810Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 6Fruscoloni P. Zamboni M. Panetta G. De Paolis A. Tocchini-Valentini G.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2914-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Specification is indirect; the τA-box A interaction determines the placement of TFIIIB, which, in turn, recruits pol III. TFIIIB placement is mediated through an interaction between Tfc4 and the Brf1 subunit of TFIIIB. Brf1 forms a stable complex with TBP, and the major DNA contacts during TFIIIC-dependent assembly of TFIIIB upstream of the start site of transcription are mediated by TBP. Consistent with this role of TBP, the DNA segments occupied by TFIIIB (∼bp -40 to bp -10, relative to predicted start sites of transcription) are uniformly AT-rich (>70% (7Léveillard T. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3594-3603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Dieci G. Percudani R. Giuliodori S. Bottarelli L. Ottonello S. J. Mol.

The notion that preferential sequence selection by TBP can occur during TFIIIC-dependent assembly of TFIIIB comes from in vivo and in vitro studies in which a shift in placement of a TATA box or partial TATA box shifts the start site accordingly but retains dependence on TFIIIC for transcription (10Joazeiro C.A. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 725-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 11Chalker D.L. Sandmeyer S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4927-4931Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Pol III also contributes to start site selection in a sequence-dependent manner, since initiation only occurs at sites specifying a purine as the initiating nucleotide preceded by a pyrimidine in the non-transcribed strand (i.e. -1/+1 is always YR). In vitro and in vivo studies on SUP4 tRNATyr and tRNALeu-3 gene variants that shift the position of YR motifs indicate that spacings of 17 to 20 bp are optimal for transcription and that spacings of 16 bp or less and 22 bp or more are severely compromised (5Zecherle G.N.

Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1232-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar. shows that only 26 genes lack a YR motif for initiation between bp -19 and -17 upstream of box A. Twenty-three of these genes accommodate initiation with a 16-bp spacing; of the remaining three, two have perfect TATA boxes specifying initiation 13 bp upstream of box A (8Dieci G. Percudani R. Giuliodori S. Bottarelli L. Ottonello S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 601-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and one is known to function poorly for transcription in vitro (12Giuliodori S. Percudani R. Braglia P. Ferrari R. Guffanti E. Ottonello S. Dieci G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The combined DNA sequence-specific interactions of TFIIIC, TFIIIB, and pol III are inadequate for specifying the start site in vitro:1) substantial purification of TFIIIB from yeast increases the proportion of minor initiation events at bp +4 and +8 on the SUP4 tRNA gene in assays with TFIIIC and pol III purified to near homogeneity (cf. Ref. 10Joazeiro C.A. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 725-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar); 2) replacement of TFIIIB with recombinant subunits elevates bp +4 and +8 initiation events to the level at bp +1 (13Andrau J.C. Werner M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5167-5175Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 14Kumar A. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Hambalko M. Brent C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1868-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). A crude Bdp1 fraction was also found to contain an excess of a factor or factors that re-establishes the fidelity of initiation at bp +1 on the SUP4 gene with recombinant TFIIIB. EMSA implicated a protein or proteins that interact with TFIIIC- and TFIIIB-TFIIIC-SUP4 DNA complexes (13Andrau J.C. Werner M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5167-5175Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), although modification of TFIIIB, TFIIIC, and/or pol III (e.g. by a protein kinase) could not be excluded. The loss of transcriptional initiation fidelity when recombinant TFIIIB, purified TFIIIC, and pol III are used to form pre-initiation complexes on the SUP4 tRNA gene appears to reflect a heterogeneity in TFIIIB placement upstream of the start site of transcription by TFIIIC. This has hampered mapping regions within TFIIIB subunits that are proximal to specific DNA locations upstream of the start site of transcription (15Shah S.M. Kumar A. Geiduschek E.P. Kassavetis G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28736-28744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To alleviate this problem we decided to turn to the start site selectivity factor. Here we show that Nhp6a, an abundant S. cerevisiae HMG1-related protein and a component of yFACT, a factor that facilitates pol II transcription of chromatin templates (16Brewster N.K. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3491-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 17Formosa T. Eriksson P. Wittmeyer J. Ginn J. Yu Y. Stillman D.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3506-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), is the factor that enforces the fidelity of transcriptional initiation of the SUP4 tRNA gene by pol III in vitro and in vivo.

The 250-bp SUP4 DNA fragment used for EMSA and footprinting was generated by PCR from pTZ2 with a 5′-32P-labeled upstream primer (5′: bp -77, relative to the start site of transcription as +1) and an unlabeled downstream primer (5′: bp +173) and purified by non-denaturing PAGE.

For Figs. 1 and 3B, transcription complexes were formed by adding TFIIIB (100 fmol of Bdp1, 100 fmol of TBP, and 80 fmol of Brf1) pre-mixed with or without Nhp6a, HU, and HMO1 (as specified in the figures) in 4-μl volume to 14 μl of the above reaction buffer containing 100 ng of pTZ2 or pPC1 (50 fmol) and 50 fmol of TFIIIC and incubated for 40 min; 2 μl of pol III (5 or 10 fmol) was then added with an additional 20-min incubation. Single-round transcription was initiated by addition of 2.5 μl of reaction buffer containing a 2 mm concentration each of ATP and CTP and 250 μm [α-32P]UTP (20 cpm/fmol) for 5 min followed by addition of 2.5 μl of reaction buffer containing 2 mm GTP and 2 mg/ml heparin for 5 min. Transcription reactions for primer extension analysis used unlabeled UTP. Primer extension with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase was performed as described (19Kassavetis G.A.

For reaction mixtures that contained the crude BRα fraction, 3.7 μg of this fraction in the requisite volume of bovine serum albumin diluent was used in place of TFIIIB and bovine serum albumin diluent in place of TFIIIC and pol III in the protocol described above. The order of addition transcription analysis shown in Fig. 2 used the following variations of the above protocol: 1) the reaction mixture containing TFIIIC and pTZ2 was incubated for 5 min followed by the addition of Nhp6a and TFIIIB for 40 min; 2) the reaction mixture with pTZ2, TFIIIC, and TFIIIB (16 μl in this case) was incubated for 40 min followed by the addition of Nhp6a in 2 μl volume for 5 min; and 3) the reaction mixture with pTZ2 and Nhp6a (14 μl in this case) was incubated for 5 min followed by the addition of TFIIIC and TFIIIB in 4 μl for 40 min.FIGURE 3Other Nhp6-like nonspecific DNA-binding proteins do not restore initiation fidelity.

Following 60 min of incubation, EMSA was performed on a 4% polyacrylamide gel as described (22Braun B.R. Riggs D.L. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Protein-DNA complexes were formed for 60 min in 20 μl of reaction buffer containing 100 ng of pLNG56 as nonspecific competitor, 200 fmol of TBP, 160 fmol of Brf1, 100 fmol of Bdp1, 200 ng of Nhp6a, and 75 fmol of TFIIIC (as indicated in Fig. 5) with 6 fmol of the 250-bp SUP4 probe (12 fmol for naked DNA and Nhp6a only). Partial DNA cleavage was achieved by sequential addition of 1.2 μl of 23 mm sodium ascorbate and 1.2 μl of 46 μm MPE-Fe(II) (34 μm for naked DNA and Nhp6a alone) for 2 min and quenched by adding 2 μl of 60 μm bathophenanthroline. ·OH-treated complexes were separated by EMSA and footprints of individual complexes were resolved by denaturing gel electrophoresis of the extracted DNA as described previously (20Kassavetis G.A.

Werner M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5167-5175Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), we first examined whether a nonspecific DNA-binding protein might impose greater stringency on TFIIIC-dependent placement of TFIIIB. The HMG1-related Nhp6a was chosen to mimic the effect of nonspecific DNA-binding proteins present in crude Bdp1 fractions. Nhp6a and the closely related Nhp6b play a positive role in pol III transcription of SNR6 (U6 snRNA gene) by a proposed compacting of DNA between the grossly suboptimally spaced box A and box B TFIIIC binding sites of that gene. Nhp6a and Nhp6b were not found to play a positive role in the transcription of any tRNA gene tested (28Lopez S. Livingstone-Zatchej M. Jourdain S. Thoma F. Sentenac A. Marsolier M.C. Mol. Cell.

However, under conditions of limiting pol III with recombinant TFIIIB and highly purified TFIIIC, Nhp6a and Nhp6b were seen to stimulate tRNA gene transcription by shielding partial TATA boxes that otherwise lead to TFIIIC-independent, TFIIIB-DNA complex formation, depleting the availability of pol III for specific transcription and increasing nonspecific transcription (31Kassavetis G.A. Soragni E. Driscoll R. Geiduschek E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15406-15411Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A bacterial HU protein, which like Nhp6 binds to DNA non-specifically and bends DNA sharply, also stimulated tRNA gene transcription under these conditions. 4G. A. Kassavetis and David F. Steiner, unpublished results. Nhp6a Promotes Initiation Fidelity—Fig. 1 examines the effect of Nhp6a on start site selection on the SUP4 tRNA gene. In A, TFIIIB, with or without Nhp6a, was added to TFIIIC-DNA complexes to form TFIIIB-TFIIIC-DNA complexes; pol III and NTPs were subsequently added under conditions that limit transcription to a single round (see “Experimental Procedures”). Lanes 1 and 3 compare SUP4 transcription with a crude pol III transcription fraction (BRα (22Braun B.R. Riggs D.L. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2530-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar)) and with purified TFIIIC, pol III, and recombinant TFIIIB, respectively. BRα generated a relatively sharp SUP4 transcript band upon denaturing gel electrophoresis, reflecting initiation occurring almost exclusively at bp +1 with a trace of initiation at bp +4 (primer extension 5′-end mapping in B, lane 1; profile of this lane in C). In contrast, the SUP4 transcript generated with purified components was diffuse (A, lane 3), reflecting high levels of initiation at bp +1, +4, and +8 and weaker initiation at bp +12 (B, lane 2; profile in C). This pattern reflects initiation at every YR motif preceding the mature tRNA 5′-end-specifying sequence of SUP4: CAACAATTAAATA (bp -1 to +12). The diffuse nature of the SUP4 transcript band in lane 3 of A arises from heterogeneity of 5′-ends and heterogeneous termination within the run of 7 Ts that comprises the SUP4 terminator. Addition of Nhp6a together with TFIIIB to TFIIIC-DNA complexes substantially sharpened the band of SUP4 transcripts (A, compare lanes 4-6 with lane 3), resulting from suppression of initiation at bp +4, +8, and +12 (B, lanes 3 and 4; C profile). The degree of fidelity of initiation with 50 ng of Nhp6a was comparable with that of BRα for bp +4 initiation with only a trace residuum of bp +8 and bp +12 initiation retained (C, compare left and right profiles). Suppression of downstream initiation also occurred under conditions of multiple round transcription (data not shown), and the closely related Nhp6b likewise suppressed downstream initiation (D). Nhp6a and Nhp6b also reduced nonspecific transcription as noted previously (31Kassavetis G.A. Soragni E. Driscoll R. Geiduschek E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 15406-15411Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although transcriptional initiation downstream of bp +1 with purified components probably results from TFIIIB complexes that are misplaced downstream of their canonical site, it remains conceivable that Nhp6a suppresses downstream initiation at a step subsequent to TFIIIB-DNA complex formation (e.g. by shielding the more confined space between downstream-shifted TFIIIB and the box A-bound τA domain of TFIIIC from access by pol III). This possibility was addressed in the experiment shown in Fig. 2. When TFIIIC was allowed to bind to DNA first, followed by the simultaneous addition of TFIIIB and Nhp6a, suppression of downstream initiation was observed (compare lanes 2-4 with lane 1). When Nhp6a was allowed to bind to DNA first, followed by the simultaneous addition of TFIIIC and TFIIIB, downstream initiation was also suppressed (compare lanes 10-12 with lane 9), but this did not happen when Nhp6a was added to preformed TFIIIB-TFIIIC-DNA complexes (compare lanes 6-8 with lane 5). We conclude that Nhp6a must be present as the TFIIIB-DNA complex forms to suppress downstream initiation. Restoration of Transcriptional Initiation Fidelity Is Specific to Nhp6a and Nhp6b—We originally speculated that any nonspecific DNA-binding protein might promote start site fidelity and, accordingly, analyzed the effects of four other nonspecific DNA-binding proteins: human HMG1 and yeast HMO1, which are HMG B class proteins like Nhp6a (32Agresti A. Bianchi M.E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), and bacterial HU proteins from T. maritima and H. pylori, which, like HMG B class proteins, are non-sequence specific and bend DNA. Nhp6a can, in fact, partially substitute for the function of HU in Escherichia coli nucleioid compaction and chromosome segregation (33Paull T.T. Johnson R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8744-8754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Of these proteins, only HMO1 and T. maritima HU could be verified by EMSA to associate stably with the SUP4 gene under the conditions used for transcription (Fig. 3A). HMO1 did not substitute for Nhp6a in restoring start site fidelity (compare lanes 6 and 7 with lanes 3 and 4 in the primer extension analysis shown in Fig. 3B). HU from T. maritima also had no effect on start site selection (Fig. 1B, lane 5); doubling the concentration of HU greatly inhibited transcription but the residuum retained the same relative abundance of downstream initiation events (data not shown). Nhp6a and Nhp6b Are Required for Initiation Site Fidelity in Vivo—The inability of nonspecific DNA-binding proteins similar to Nhp6a to promote initiation fidelity prompted us to examine whether Nhp6a has a role in start site selection in vivo. For this purpose, RNA was purified from logarithmically growing yeast deleted for the genes encoding Nhp6a and Nhp6b and from the otherwise isogenic strain. RNA 5′-ends were mapped by primer extension with reverse transcriptase, using a primer complementary to the intron of the wild type allele of SUP4 (tRNA-Y JR). The non-coding 5′-leaders of tRNA gene transcripts are rapidly processed, but unspliced intron-containing tRNAs are greatly enriched for pre-tRNAs retaining the 5′-leader. This intron-specific primer is complementary to two additional tyrosyl-tRNA genes (tRNA-Y DR and tRNA-Y OL; Fig. 4A, bottom). Relative to the position of the SUP4 bp +1 reverse transcription product, YR motifs that place initiation sites within the optimal 17-20-bp spacing from box A in all three genes (bold and underlined in Fig. 4A) predict 5′-ends at bp -1, +1, +2, and +3. This is what was observed with RNA from the reference type strain (lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, RNA isolated from cells lacking Nhp6a and Nhp6b displayed a relative diminution of the bp -1 and +1 primer extension products and new products corresponding to initiation at bp +4 and +8 (lanes 4 and 5). The same outcome was observed in two additional RNA preparations using different purification procedures (data not shown). We also examined the intron-containing tRNALeu-3 genes with two intron-directed primers. One primer, complementary to the tRNA-L DR2 intron (with possible priming of tRNA-L LR2 also), showed that the fidelity of initiation of this tRNA gene was not dependent on Nhp6 (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 1 and 2). The second primer, complementary to the introns of 7 tRNA-L genes (AR, CL, GL1, GR2, KR, MR, and NL), showed that one or more of these tRNA genes was dependent on Nhp6a and/or Nhp6b for initiation fidelity (compare lanes 3 and 4). One of these genes (tRNA-L CL) was used as a template for in vitro transcription with recombinant TFIIIB, purified TFIIIC, and pol III or with the crude BRα transcription fraction: no significant difference in initiation fidelity was observed (data not shown). It is clear from these results that not every tRNA gene in yeast requires Nhp6a and/or Nhp6b. Given that tRNALeu-3 genes have identical coding sequences (including the box A and box B promoter elements), as well as nearly identical introns and 5′- and 3′-non-coding transcribed sequences, sequences upstream of the start site of transcription are implicated in determining the need for Nhp6 to reinforce initiation fidelity. Nhp6a Alters TFIIIC-Box A Interaction—The order-of-Nhp6a-addition experiment in Fig. 2 implied that Nhp6a must act prior to TFIIIB-DNA complex formation to prevent initiation of transcription downstream of bp +1. Two-dimensional hydroxyl radical footprinting with MPE-Fe(II) was employed to gain insight into the process by which Nhp6a specifies stringency in TFIIIB placement (Fig. 5). Naked DNA or protein-DNA complexes containing combinations of Nhp6a, TFIIIC, and TFIIIB were treated with MPE-Fe(II), and the complex of interest was isolated by EMSA (A, inset), followed by denaturing gel electrophoresis. A compares the MPE-Fe(II) digestion profiles of a 250-bp SUP4 tRNA gene probe, 5′-end-labeled on the non-transcribed strand, as free DNA and as the Nhp6a-DNA complex formed with 200 ng of Nhp6a (0.9 μm). This concentration of Nhp6a is"

Miller M.D. Greene W.C. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4112-4121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This down-regulation of CD4 expression by Nef prevents superinfection and accelerates viral infectivity by enhancing HIV-1 replication (22Cullen B.R.

In addition, CD4 down-modulation facilitates increased release and spread of HIV in vivo with the consequent establishment of high virus loads (25Ross T.M. Oran A.E. Cullen B.R. Curr.

Additionally, it has been reported that Nef down-regulates the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I, CD3, and CD28 surface molecules, up-regulates Fas-ligand expression, and alters the production of several cytokines, thus affecting the host immune responses (29Schwartz O.

Finally, Nef has been shown to modulate cellular activation of T cell signaling pathways (9Hanna Z. Kay D.G. Rebai N. Guimond A. Jothy S. Jolicoeur P.

However, the importance and the physiological relevance of each of these individual functions are poorly documented in lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs), the natural targets of HIV-1 infection. Thus, Nef pathogenesis in vivo still remains unclear and requires further investigation.Nef has been found to interact with a number of cellular protein kinases, including members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases (38Greenway A.

Activation of PAK has been implicated in several cellular processes, including reorganization of the cell cytoskeleton, mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascades (50Sells M.A. Boyd J.T.

Virology. 1996; 224: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This interaction of PAK with Nef is a highly conserved feature of primary HIV-1 and SIV Nef alleles (57Kirchhoff F. Schindler M. Bailer N. Renkema G.H. Saksela K. Knoop V. Muller-Trutwin M.C. Santiago M.L. Bibollet-Ruche F. Dittmar M.T. Heeney J.L. Hahn B.H. Munch J. J.

Moreover, targeting Nef to the plasma membrane is critical to allow NAK association and its autophosphorylation (59Lang S.M. Iafrate A.J. Stahl-Hennig C. Kuhn E.M. Nisslein T. Kaup F.J. Haupt M.

Virol. 2004; 78: 4085-4097Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Among the PAK family members, PAK2 appears to preferentially associate with Nef (47Renkema G.H. Manninen A. Mann D.A. Harris M. Saksela K. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1407-1410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Arora V.K. Molina R.P. Foster J.L. Blakemore J.L. Chernoff J. Fredericksen B.L. Garcia J.V. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11081-11087Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), although PAK1 has also been described as the preferred binding partner (49Fackler O.T. Lu X. Frost J.A. Geyer M. Jiang B. Luo W. Abo A. Alberts A.S. Peterlin B.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 2619-2627Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition, several studies, mostly using the SIV Nef allele, have linked this association to efficient pathogenesis and enhancement of viral infectivity (62Khan I.H. Sawai E.T. Antonio E.

However, these observations were challenged by other studies showing that interaction of SIV Nef with PAK was not a prerequisite for SIV to achieve a high viral load and pathogenesis (59Lang S.M. Iafrate A.J. Stahl-Hennig C. Kuhn E.M. Nisslein T. Kaup F.J. Haupt M. Hunsmann G. Skowronski J. Kirchhoff F. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 64Carl S.

Virol. 2000; 74: 2038-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) (see below).In the present study we studied the binding of Nef to PAK in different subpopulations of primary immune cells of a small transgenic (Tg) animal model (CD4C/HIV) of HIV-1 pathogenesis developed in our laboratory (9Hanna Z. Kay D.G. Rebai N. Guimond A. Jothy S. Jolicoeur P. Cell. 1998; 95: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In these CD4C/HIV Tg mice, Nef expression in cells normally targeted for HIV-1 infection (immature and mature CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DC)) leads to the development of a severe disease showing most of the characteristics of human AIDS, including immunodeficiency, preferential loss of CD4+ T cells, thymic atrophy, activation of T and B cells, loss of germinal center formation, and lung (lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis), heart, and kidney (tubulointerstitial nephritis, segmental glomerulosclerosis, and microcystic dilatation) diseases. The notion that Nef has an effect on altering the signaling machineries, through a PAK-dependent pathway, in different subpopulations of the immune cells and thus favors the development of an AIDS-like disease in Tg mice presents an attractive possibility.We demonstrate here that Nef binds and activates PAK2 in the three major immune cells expressing the transgene (thymocytes, macrophages, and DCs). In addition, because several motifs of Nef have been reported to be important for this association, we carried out in vivo evaluation of some of the domains disrupting this interaction, using a mutational analysis of Nef. We evaluated Nef-NAK interaction or PAK activation in tissues of Tg mice expressing 10 different Nef mutants, 5 of which abrogate Nef-NAK interactions.MATERIALS AND METHODSTransgene Construction and Generation of Tg Mice—The NefP69A, NefR105A/R106A, and NefP147A/P150A mutants were constructed by replacing the amino acids at positions P69, RR105/106, and P147/P150 of the Nef protein to alanine residues. These mutations were produced by using a two-step PCR site-directed mutagenesis, on a SacI-BamHI HIV-1 (strain NL4–3) Nef fragment subcloned in pBS-KS vector, using primer 647 (5-GTGTGACTGCAAAACCCAC-3) containing G to C mutation at nucleotide 8991, to produce P69A, primer 1024 (5-GGATATCTTGTGCTGCTTGGGAGTGAA-3) containing CT to CG mutations at nucleotides 9099 and 9102, to produce R105A/R106A mutations, primer 624 (CCTTATCTGCCTCAACTGCTACTAG) containing C to G mutations at nucleotides 9225 and 9234, to produce P147A/P150A mutations, respectively. The mutations were confirmed by sequencing, and the SacI-BamH1 fragment was incorporated into the transgene CD4C/HIVMutG (now designated CD4C/HIV-NefWT) DNA backbone used in our previous study (9Hanna Z. Kay D.G. Rebai N. Guimond A. Jothy S. Jolicoeur P. Cell. 1998; 95: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), to replace the wild-type (wt) nef sequences and thus generate the CD4C/HIV-NefP69A, CD4C/HIV-NefR105A/R106A, and CD4C/HIV-NefP147A/P150A DNAs. The DNA transgenes were purified and inoculated into 1-day-old (C57BL/6 × C3H)F2 embryos to generate Tg mice as described previously (9Hanna Z. Kay D.G. Rebai N. Guimond A. Jothy S. Jolicoeur P. Cell. 1998; 95: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). CD4C/HIV-NefRD35AA and CD4C/HIV-NefD174K were constructed in a similar fashion (67Hanna Z. Priceputu E. Hu C. Vincent P. Jolicoeur P. Virology. 2006; (in press)Google Scholar). The CD4C/HIV-NefG2A, CD4C/HIV-NefΔ8–17, CD4C/HIV-NefΔ25–35, CD4C/HIV-NefNefΔ57–66, and CD4C/HIV-NefP72AxxP75A transgenes were described previously (68Hanna Z. Priceputu E. Kay D.G. Poudrier J.

Virol. 2001; 75: 9378-9392Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Tg lines with mice expressing Nef at an equal or higher level than that of CD4C/HIV-NefWT were kept and bred for further analysis, whereas these founder lines that expressed Nef at lower levels were discarded. A minimum of two expresser Tg founders was produced, and lines were established from each one by breeding as heterozygotes on the C3H background for three to seven generations.Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blot analysis was carried out on 10 μg of total RNA from different tissues, using 32P-labeled HIV-1 probe, as previously described (9Hanna Z. Kay D.G. Rebai N. Guimond A. Jothy S. Jolicoeur P. Cell. 1998; 95: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar).Antibodies—Rabbit anti-HIV Nef antisera were raised against purified GST-HIV Nef fusion protein, as described (9Hanna Z. Kay D.G. Rebai N. Guimond A. Jothy S. Jolicoeur P. Cell. 1998; 95: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Anti-β-PIX-COOL and p95PKL were produced in rabbits immunized with purified GST/β-PIX450–1543 and GST/p95PKL47–940, respectively. Anti-actin and rabbit anti-αPAK (C-19) or goat anti-γPAK antibodies (V-19) were from Sigma and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. The latter were used to immunoprecipitate PAK2. Specific antibodies against PAK1, PAK2, and PAK3 have previously been described (47Renkema G.H. Manninen A. Mann D.A. Harris M. Saksela K. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1407-1410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Western Blot Analysis—Protein expression was assessed by Western blot analysis of lymphoid organs from different founders using rabbit anti-Nef antisera as described previously (9Hanna Z. Kay D.G. Rebai N. Guimond A. Jothy S. Jolicoeur P. Cell. 1998; 95: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were extracted in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline) containing protease inhibitors aprotinin (2 μg/ml), pepstatin (1 μg/ml), N-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (50 μg/ml) and leupeptin (2 μg/ml). Cell extracts (∼100 μg) were loaded onto SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel and blotted on polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Membranes were blocked overnight in 5% skim milk-0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma) in Tris-buffered saline at 4 °C. Blocked membranes were incubated with the anti-Nef antisera (1:1000), anti-actin (1:2000), or anti-PAK2 (V-19) antibodies, for 2 h at room temperature and washed with 5% skim milk-0.1% Tween 20. Proteins were visualized by incubating the membranes with secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa 680 fluorochrome followed by scanning with Odyssey® infrared imaging system (Licor) for all experiments except the one shown in Fig. 2B. In this latter experiment, the membrane was incubated for 1 h with the secondary reagent rabbit IgG TrueBlot™ (1:1000, eBioscience), and the Nef protein was subsequently revealed using enhanced chemiluminescent horse-radish peroxidase substrate ECL (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), as described previously (9Hanna Z. Kay D.G. Rebai N. Guimond A. Jothy S. Jolicoeur P. Cell. 1998; 95: 163-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar).Preparation of Peritoneal Macrophages—Peritoneal macrophages were harvested by injecting 10 ml of fresh media (Iscove's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum) into the peritoneal cavity of the animals followed by plating on Petri dishes (Falcon) for 3 h. The attached macrophages were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer for subsequent assays.In Vitro Kinase Assay—Cells were lysed in kinase extraction buffer (KEB) (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, and 137 mm NaCl) containing protease (aprotinin (2 μg/ml) and leupeptin (2 μg/ml)) and phosphatase (sodium orthovanadate (0.37 μg/ml) and sodium fluoride (0.04 μg/ml)) inhibitors. Equal amounts of proteins were used for all the in vitro kinase assay (IVKA) reactions, and quantification of proteins was done using the colorimetric microBCA assay. For immunoprecipitation, anti-Nef or anti-PAK antibodies were added to 250 μg of thymocyte lysates or 100 μg of macrophage lysates and incubated overnight. Protein G-coupled agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences, 50 μl) were then added, and the pellets were washed three times with the KEB buffer and once with kinase activation buffer (1% Triton, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm sodium orthovanadate). The IVKA reaction were performed in 50 μl containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 5 min at room temperature, and the pellets were washed once with KEB and resuspended in 2× SDS-loading buffer. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography.Immunodepletion Experiments—Thymocyte or macrophage extracts (250 or 100 μg, respectively) from Tg and non-Tg animals were first immunoprecipitated with the anti-Nef polyclonal serum. Protein G beads were pelleted, and the supernatant was re-immunoprecipitated for a second round with the anti-Nef serum. Protein G beads were pelleted again and a final immunoprecipitation with the anti-PAK2 (V-19) or anti-β-PIX-COOL Ab was carried out. All the immunoprecipitations were performed for 6 h to overnight and kept at 4 °C until kinase assay was started.Semiquantitation of Bound/Unbound PAK2 or β-PIX to Nef—Following immunoprecipitation and IVKA, the samples were submitted to SDS-PAGE, exposed on PhosphorImager screen, and scanned with the Storm® Imaging unit (Amersham Biosciences). Semiquantitation of the fraction of PAK2 or β-PIX unbound to Nef was estimated with ImageQuaNT software (Amersham Biosciences). A ratio of the phosphorylated p85/p95 signal present in the anti-Nef immunoprecipitate over the total signal of the p85/p95 phosphorylated signal present in all the immunoprecipitates (immunodepletion with anti-PAK2 or anti-β-PIX in addition to the anti-Nef immunoprecipitation) was calculated.35S-Labeling Procedure—Thymocytes (5 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated in methionine/cysteine-free RPMI plus fetal calf serum medium with 35S-labeled methionine/cysteine-mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 100 μCi) for 4 h. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, essentially as previously described (70Huang M. Hanna Z. Jolicoeur P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 60-68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Phospho-amino Acid Analysis—Phosphorylated proteins were cut off from the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and then incubated for 1 h at 110 °C in 5.7 n HCl, for acid hydrolysis. Electrophoresis was performed on thin layer cellulose plate in pH 1.9 buffer (2.2% formic acid, 7.8% acetic acid) at 1.5 KV for 20 min, as described (71Boyle W.J. van der G.P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar).Limited In-gel Digestion Assay—Thymocyte extracts (250 μg) were immunoprecipitated with either an anti-Nef or an anti-β-PIX-COOL polyclonal serum followed by an IVKA and SDS-PAGE. The p95, p85, and immunoglobulin phosphorylated substrates were cut off from the dried gel and reloaded in the wells of a 14% polyacrylamide gel. The gel pieces were allowed to rehydrate in equilibration buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3% 2-mercaptoethanol) for 15 min, and 2 μg of V8 peptidase (Sigma) or 500 ng of chymotrypsin (Sigma) diluted in equilibration buffer was added to the samples immediately before starting electrophoresis. The migration was done at room temperature and was stopped for 30 min (when the dye front reached the bottom of the stacking gel) to allow digestion to proceed. The migration was then continued as usual. Digested products were visualized by autoradiography.Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting—Flow cytometry was performed on a BD Biosciences FACScan using antibodies against various cell surface markers, as described previously (9Hanna Z. Kay D.G. Rebai N. Guimond A. Jothy S. Jolicoeur P. Cell. 1"

To investigate the mechanism of initial lipid acquisition by apoB, we examined the lipid binding and interfacial properties of a carboxyl-terminal His6-tagged form of apoB20.1 (apoB20.1H). ApoB20.1H was expressed in Sf9 cells and purified by nickel affinity chromatography. ApoB20.1H was produced in a folded state as characterized by formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds and resistance to chemical reduction. Dynamic light scattering in physiological buffer indicated that purified apoB20.1H formed multimers, which were readily dissociable upon the addition of nonionic detergent (0.1% Triton X-100). ApoB20.1H was incapable of binding dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine multilamellar vesicles, unless its multimeric structure was first disrupted by guanidine hydrochloride. However, apoB20.1H multimers spontaneously dissociated and bound to the interface of naked and phospholipid-coated triolein droplets. These data reveal that the initiating domain of apoB contains solvent-accessible hydrophobic sequences, which, in the absence of a hydrophobic lipid interface or detergent, engage in self-association. The high affinity of apoB20.1H for neutral lipid is consistent with the membrane binding and desorption model of apoB-containing lipoprotein assembly.

These data reveal that the initiating domain of apoB contains solvent-accessible hydrophobic sequences, which, in the absence of a hydrophobic lipid interface or detergent, engage in self-association. The high affinity of apoB20.1H for neutral lipid is consistent with the membrane binding and desorption model of apoB-containing lipoprotein assembly.

The assembly of apoB-containing lipoproteins proceeds in two steps: cotranslational incorporation of the nascent apoB polypeptide into a precursor lipoprotein particle in the rough ER followed by the additional posttranslational lipidation via fusion with lipid droplets in the ER and/or the Golgi (3Alexander C.A.

Both steps of apoB-containing lipoprotein assembly require MTP, a dedicated cofactor composed of a unique 97-kDa subunit complexed with the ubiquitous ER-localized folding enzyme, protein-disulfide isomerase (7Wetterau J.R.

During the first step of lipoprotein assembly, MTP may transfer lipid molecules from the ER membrane or other donor sites directly to apoB and/or may bind to apoB and promote its proper folding and autonomous lipid acquisition (7Wetterau J.R.

MTP also participates in bulk transmembrane lipid transport from the cytosol into the ER-Golgi, a process critical for second step apoB particle expansion (10Wang Y. Tran K. Yao Z. J. Biol.

The earliest and most commonly accepted theory posits that the apoB polypeptide interacts with the inner leaflet of the ER membrane during translation, causing the nucleation and desorption of an ∼20-nm diameter emulsion particle upon the completion of translation (13Olofsson S.-O.

Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 205-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A variation of this model proposes that the interfacial binding and lipoprotein desorption process is completed upon translation of only the first ∼1000 amino-terminal residues of apoB, giving rise to a small, high density lipoprotein-like emulsion particle precursor (1Shelness G.S. Ledford A.S. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2005; 16: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 18Shelness G.S. Hou L. Ledford A.S. Parks J.S. Weinberg R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44702-44707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). An alternative hypothesis of lipoprotein initiation is based on the modeling of the amino-terminal ∼1,000 amino acids of apoB as a closed three-sided, funnel-shaped lipid-binding cavity, similar to that in the apoB paralog, lipovitellin (LV), the processed form of vitellogenin (19Anderson T.A.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1163-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Transfer of predominantly phospholipid molecules into this cavity is predicted to form a discoidal proteolipid intermediate, which is subsequently converted to a TG-rich lipoprotein upon further translation and MTP-mediated lipid transfer (21Segrest J.P.

Chem. 2004; 279: 39757-39766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).New insights into the mechanism of initial lipid acquisition by apoB come from the observation that the amino-terminal 20.1% of apoB (apoB20.1; residues 1-912) is the minimum sequence necessary and sufficient to initiate the first step of TG-rich lipoprotein particle assembly (18Shelness G.S. Hou L. Ledford A.S. Parks J.S. Weinberg R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44702-44707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The ability to express and purify this functional domain has allowed us to examine its biochemical and interfacial properties as a means to understand how it functions in vivo. Our data suggest that apoB20.1H contains solvent accessible hydrophobic surfaces that have a particularly high affinity for neutral lipid interfaces. These properties argue that the initiating domain of apoB may catalyze a lipid desorption reaction during the initial formation of nascent apoB-containing lipoproteins in the ER.MATERIALS AND METHODSExpression of Recombinant ApoB20.1H—ApoB20.1H (18Shelness G.S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 44702-44707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was cloned into the pFastBac1 vector, and the resulting plasmid was transposed into DH10Bac competent cells (Invitrogen). The production of apoB20.1H in Sf9 cells was achieved as described previously (24Weinberg R.B. Cook V.R. DeLozier J.A. Shelness G.S. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1419-1427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Viral supernatants containing recombinant apoB20.1H were cleared by centrifugation at ∼1,000 × g, filter-sterilized, and stored at 4 °C in the presence of 0.05% sodium azide, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin and leupeptin.Purification of ApoB20.1H—All steps were performed at 4 °C. One liter of apoB20.1H viral supernatant was placed in a 2-liter Erlenmeyer flask and adjusted to 325 mm NaCl and 0.5% Triton X-100. Twenty ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen), pre-equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, pH 8.0, was added and incubated for 1.5 h with orbital shaking at 130 rpm. The slurry was poured into a glass column, the resin was washed with five bed volumes of wash buffer I (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 15 mm imidazole, pH 8.0), followed by 15 bed volumes of wash buffer II (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0). Protein was eluted by running 1 bed volume of elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) into the column. The flow was stopped, and the column was incubated for 5 min before restoring the flow. Two successive elutions were performed. Purified protein was concentrated and exchanged into 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1.5 mm sodium azide (TBS) with a Centricon-30 centrifugal concentrator (Millipore) or with a stirred ultrafiltration cell utilizing nitrogen pressure and a YM30 regenerated cellulose membrane (Millipore). Final protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce).Molecular Weight Determination by Mass Spectrometry—The mass of purified apoB20.1H was determined using a Bruker Autoflex MALDI-TOF instrument. Purified protein was diluted to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml into a saturated solution of sinapinic acid (3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid), 50% acetonitrile, and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. One-μl samples were spotted on a stainless steel target plate, and spectra were obtained in the linear mode using the high molecular weight program. For the analysis shown, >600 laser shots were summed, and peaks were found using the centroid method. Calibration was performed using a 5-point protein calibration mixture composed of protein A [m+2H]+2, 22,306 Da; trypsinogen, 23,982 Da; bovine serum albumin [m+2H]+2, 33,216 Da; protein A, 44,613 Da; and bovine serum albumin, 66,431 Da.Assessment of Disulfide Bond Formation—Three μg of purified protein was incubated at various temperatures in the absence or presence of 50 mm DTT in a final volume of 20 μl. The samples were incubated for 10 min and then adjusted to 200 mm iodoacetimide, to alkylate free sulfhydryls and to inactivate the DTT. After further incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, concentrated SDS-PAGE sample buffer (without the reducing agent) was added, and samples were boiled for 5 min and analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE. To assay for the possible presence of free sulfhydryls, 2 μg of purified protein in 10 μl of SDS (0.5%), with or without 5 mm DTT, was heated at 65 °C for 10 min. Samples then received 8 μl of TBS and either 2 μl of dimethylformamide or 2 μl of 100 mm fluorescein-5-maleimide (Pierce) dissolved in dimethylformamide. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, samples were precipitated by adjusting to 10% trichloroacetic acid. After washing the pellets with acetone, samples were dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 0.1 m DTT, boiled for 5 min, and fractionated by 8% SDS-PAGE. The gel was viewed and photographed under UV illumination.Binding of ApoB20.1H to Phospholipid Vesicles—DMPC multilamellar vesicles were prepared as described previously (25DeLozier J.A. Parks J.S. Shelness G.S. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 399-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For DMPC clearing assays, purified apoB20.1H was mixed with DMPC vesicles in phosphate-buffered saline at final concentrations of 175 and 500 μg/ml, respectively. Samples were incubated at 24.5 °C with inversion, and the turbidity was monitored at 325 nm at the indicated times. ApoA-I, which was added at the same protein:lipid mass ratio, served as a positive control. In some experiments, the mixtures were incubated for 20 h, adjusted to a density of 1.25 g/ml with KBr, and centrifuged at 100,000 rpm in a Beckman TL100 Tabletop Ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter) for 18 h at 15 °C, as described previously (18Shelness G.S. Hou L. Ledford A.S. Parks J.S. Weinberg R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44702-44707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The top 1 ml (d < 1.25 g/ml) and bottom 2 ml (d > 1.25 g/ml) fractions were recovered by tube slicing. One-fifth of the top and bottom fractions was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE. In other DMPC binding studies, 100 μg of purified apoB20.1H was mixed with 2 mg DMPC in a final concentration of 0, 0.7, or 2.0 m GdnHCl (final volume of 600 μl). The mixtures were incubated for 20 h at 24 °C with constant dialysis against phosphate buffered saline to remove the GdnHCl. The samples were adjusted to a density of 1.25 g/ml with KBr and analyzed by density gradient centrifugation as described above.Light Scattering Analysis of ApoB20.1H—The hydrodynamic radius of apoB20.1H was measured using a Malvern Instrument ZEN 1600 at a wavelength of 633 nm. One hundred μl of purified protein at a concentration of 0.25 mg/ml was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min to pellet any particulate matter. The supernatant was transferred to a quartz cuvette, and 10-15 readings at 20 °C were averaged per sample. The hydrodynamic radius of the protein was also measured after adjusting the sample to 0.1% Triton X-100.Interfacial Activity of ApoB20.1H at the Triolein/Water Interface—The interfacial behavior of apoB20.1H at a triolein/water interface was examined using a Tracker® oil-drop tensiometer (IT Concept, Parc de Chancolan, Longessaigne, France) (26Weinberg R.B. Cook V.R. Beckstead J.A. Martin D.D. Gallagher J.W. Shelness G.S. Ryan R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34438-34444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 27Wang L.B. Small D.M. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1704-1715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Ten-μl drops of pure triolein were rapidly formed into a cuvette containing apoB20.1H at a concentration of 25 μg/ml in 41.3 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and the binding of the protein to the triolein/water interface was measured as the decrease in interfacial tension with time. In some experiments, before apoB20.1H was injected into the cuvette, a triolein droplet was formed and then coated with a monolayer of phosphatidylcholine, obtained by centrifugation of Intralipid® (Fresenius Kabi Clayton) in an SW27 rotor (Beckman Coulter) at 27,000 rpm for 35 min at 4 °C followed by collection of the infranatant fractions. Binding rate constants were derived by log transformation of the tension versus time data.RESULTSExpression and Purification of ApoB20.1H—A recombinant apoB20.1H-containing bacmid genome was transfected into Sf9 insect cells to generate infectious viral particles. A series of subsequent infections, using successively harvested viral supernatants, were performed to achieve a maximal level of expression. ApoB20.1H secreted from infected cells displayed SDS-PAGE mobility consistent with its predicted molecular mass of 102,475 Da (Fig. 1A, lane 2). To further characterize the status of apoB20.1H expressed in this system, viral supernatants were subjected to density gradient ultracentrifugation. As baculovirus replicates via a lytic life cycle, considerable cellular lipid is released during the course of viral infection. As observed in Fig. 1B, apoB20.1H secreted into this milieu binds sufficient lipid to float in the d < 1.25 g/ml buoyant lipoprotein fraction (Fig. 1B, lane 1). This behavior is consistent with previous analyses of apoB17, which revealed an avid affinity for exogenous lipids (28Herscovitz H. Derksen A. Walsh M.T. McKnight C.J. Gantz D.L.

These data also revealed that anti-human apoB antibodies specifically recognized the ∼100-kDa band during immunoblot analysis, further confirming its identity. Densitometric analysis of the Coomassie-stained gels, using bovine serum albumin standards, indicated an ∼4.0 mg/liter concentration of apoB20.1H in the crude culture supernatant. A single round of nickel affinity chromatography yielded ∼3 mg of purified protein (Fig. 1C). Upon concentration and buffer exchange into TBS, the purified protein remained soluble and stable for at least 28 days when stored at 4 °C (data not shown).Initial Characterization of Purified ApoB20.1H—MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of purified apoB20.1H revealed a molecular mass of 103,361 Da (Fig. 2A), a value in close agreement with the calculated molecular mass of 102,475 Da. Although apoB20.1H contains one N-linked glycosylation site that is utilized in human plasma apoB100 (Asn-158) (30Yang C.-y. Gu Z.-W. Weng S.-a. Kim T.W. Chen S.-H. Pownall H.J. Sharp P.M. Liu S.-W.

Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 447-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the absence of an electrophoretic mobility shift upon N-glycanase treatment and lack of binding to concanavalin A (data not shown) suggest that apoB20.1H may not contain N-linked carbohydrate; however, O-linked glycosylation cannot be ruled out. Six intramolecular disulfide bonds form cotranslationally within apoB20.1, independently of its lipidation state (32Yang C.-y. Kim T.W. Weng S.-a. Lee B. Yang M. Gotto Jr., A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5523-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 33Ingram M.F. Shelness G.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 16267-16274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To assess the state of the disulfide bonds in apoB20.1H, purified protein was incubated without or with 50 mm DTT for 10 min at varying temperatures followed by alkylation of the free sulfhydryls and analysis by nonreducing SDS-PAGE. At both 22 and 50 °C in the absence of DTT, all apoB20.1H was in a disulfide-bonded form as evidenced by the faster gel mobility relative to the fully reduced control (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1 and 5 with lane 7). At 22 °C, addition of DTT did not alter the mobility of apoB20.1H (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1 and 2), consistent with the existence of a native folded state in which intramolecular disulfide bonds are solvent inaccessible (35Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 15: 261-287Crossref Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 36Tatu U. Braakman I. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, as the temperature was raised from 22-50 °C, increased access to disulfide bonds caused a corresponding increase in the ratio of reduced:folded protein (Fig. 2B, lanes 2, 3, 4, and 6). To ensure that all 12 Cys residues in apoB20.1 were disulfide-bonded, the protein was treated with the fluorescent sulfhydryl reagent, fluorescein-5-maleimide (37McLachlin D.T. Dunn S.D. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The samples were then fractionated by SDS-PAGE and viewed under UV illumination. As shown in Fig. 2C, apoB20.1H failed to react with fluorescein-5-maleimide unless it was first reduced with DTT.FIGURE 2Characterization of purified apoB20.1H. A, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of purified apoB20.1H revealed a predominant peak at 103,361 Da. B, purified apoB20.1H was incubated for 10 min without (-) or with (+) 50 mm DTT and 0.5% SDS at the indicated temperatures, followed by alkylation and analysis by nonreducing SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The positions of reduced and folded forms of apoB20.1H are indicated.

In addition, we showed that apoB20.1H recovered directly from baculovirus supernatants was associated with sufficient cellular lipid to float at d < 1.25 g/ml (Fig. 1B). However, upon purification away from lipid and detergent, apoB20.1H failed to decrease the turbidity of a solution of DMPC vesicles (Fig. 3A, closed circles); under the same conditions apoA-I mediated rapid vesicle clearing (Fig. 3A, open circles). To examine the possibility that apoB20.1H can bind to DMPC vesicles but cannot convert them into smaller recombinant lipoproteins, incubations were performed for 20 h followed by the analysis of free and DMPC-bound protein by density gradient centrifugation and SDS-PAGE. As expected, all of the apoA-I bound to the DMPC vesicles and was recovered in the d < 1.25 g/ml top density gradient fraction (Fig. 3B; lane 1). In contrast, all of the apoB20.1H was found in the lipid poor bottom fraction (Fig. 3B, lane 4), confirming that in purified form, apoB20.1H has little affinity for DMPC vesicles.FIGURE 3Binding of apoB20.1H to DMPC vesicles. A, ApoB20.1H (closed circles) and apoA-I (open circles) were incubated with DMPC vesicles at 24.5 °C, and the absorbance (325 nm) was measured at the indicated times. B, ApoA-I or apoB20.1H were incubated with DMPC vesicles for 20 h followed by equilibrium density gradient centrifugation at d = 1.25 g/ml.

Dahneke B.E. Measurement of Suspended Particles by Quasi-Elastic Light Scattering.

Assuming that the protein exists in a roughly spherical conformation, these data indicate a molecular mass of ∼640-kDa (39Hantgan R.R. Braaten J.V. Rocco M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3935-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) suggesting that on an average, apoB20.1H may exist in solution predominantly as hexamers, with a smaller percentage of both higher and lower orders of multimers. Addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 shifted the entire population to a smaller, more mono-disperse, distribution with a mean diameter of 7.2 nm, corresponding to a molecular mass of 110-kDa, close to the monomeric molecular mass of apoB20.1H (Fig. 4B, open circles). The fact that this relatively hydrophobic surfactant dissociates apoB20.1H multimers suggests that the monomers associate via hydrophobic interactions.

To examine this possibility, purified apoB20.1H was incubated with 0, 0.7, or 2 m GdnHCl followed by the addition of DMPC vesicles. After dialysis, the vesicles were subjected to density gradient centrifugation to separate bound and free protein. Incubation with 0.7 m GdnHCl resulted in ∼90% conversion of apoB20.1H into a buoyant, lipid-associated form (Fig. 5, lanes 5 and 6), and 2 m GdnHCl resulted in almost quantitative DMPC binding (lanes 7 and 8). These data suggest that dissociation of apoB20.1H multimers by GdnHCl exposed binding sites that enabled it to interact with DMPC vesicles.FIGURE 5Binding of purified apoB20.1H to DMPC after dissociation with guanidine. ApoB20.1H was incubated without (-) or with (+) DMPC vesicles in the presence of 0, 0.7 or 2 m guanidine. Samples were dialyzed for 20 h at 24 °C against PBS.

The propeptide is essential for protease folding, and, although cleaved by an autocatalytic process, it remains associated with the mature form acting as an auto-inhibitor of PC1/3. To further assess the role of certain residues in its interaction with its cognate enzyme, we performed an alanine scan on two PC1/3 propeptide potential cleavable sites (50RRSRR54 and 61KR62) and an acidic region 65DDD67 conserved among species. Upon incubation with PC1/3, the ensuing peptides exhibit equal inhibitory potency, lower potency, or higher potency than the wild-type propeptide. The Ki values calculated varied between 0.15 and 16.5 nm. All but one mutant exhibited a tight binding behavior. To examine the specificity of mutants, we studied their reactivity toward furin, a closely related convertase. The mutation of certain residues also affects the inhibition behavior toward furin yielding propeptides exhibiting Ki ranging from 0.2 to 24 nm. Mutant propeptides exhibited against each enzyme either different mode of inhibition, enhanced selectivity in the order of 40-fold for one enzyme, or high potency with no discrimination. Hence, we demonstrate through single amino acid substitution that it is feasible to modify the inhibitory behavior of propeptides toward convertases in such a way as to increase or decrease their potency, modify their inhibitory mechanisms, as well as increase their selectivity.

One of the most common methods used by cells to diversify the pool of their biologically active molecules is protein processing. Indeed, numerous secreted proteins are synthesized first as an inactive precursor, which is rendered biologically active upon cleavage at clusters of basic residues. Members of a family of proteins named proprotein convertases (PCs) 3The abbreviations used are: PC, proprotein convertase; AMC, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin; ESI, electron-spray ionization; MCA, 4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide; PACE, paired basic amino acid cleaving enzyme; mPC1/3, murine proprotein convertase 1/3; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography; Sf, Spodoptera frugiperda; WT, wild type. primarily perform this cleavage. To date, seven members were described: furin, PC1/3, PC2, PACE4, PC4, PC5/6, and PC7/PC8/lymphoma proprotein convertase. Some of them are ubiquitously expressed such as furin, PACE4, and PC7, whereas others exhibit a more restricted expression pattern such as PC1/3 and PC2, which are solely present in endocrine and neuroendocrine tissues, and PC4, which is expressed only in germ cells. However, all of them belong to the larger family of serine proteases and are structurally related to bacterial subtilisin and yeast kexin (reviewed in Ref. 1Bergeron F. Leduc R. Day R. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 24: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In terms of biological activities, numerous transfection experiments using recombinant enzymes and substrates, generation of knock-out animals as well as human cases of convertase deficiency pointed out the importance of convertases in crucial biological processes such as patterning during embryogenesis, angiogenesis, prohormone processing, tissue remodeling, and complement activation (2Taylor N.A. Van De Ven W.J. Creemers J.W. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1215-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Furthermore, some members are also implicated in many disease states, because they are able to activate various bacterial toxins and to process viral envelope glycoproteins needed for cell penetration (3Thomas G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 753-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). For all these reasons convertases represent attractive therapeutic targets. Structurally, they share common features such as the presence of (i) a signal peptide guiding the protein to the secretory pathway, (ii) a propeptide (alternatively called prosegment, prodomain, or proregion), implicated in enzyme folding and inhibition, (iii) a catalytic domain that possesses the classic catalytic triad Asp, His, and Ser residues conserved among serine proteases, (iv) a P domain, which appears to regulate Ca2+ and pH dependence of the enzyme, and finally, (v) a COOH-terminal tail often defining the localization in organelles and cells. Such a topological distribution of structural regions makes a convertase an efficient self-controlled molecule whereby activation of its zymogen into its active form requires sequential removal of particular segments. This characteristic is best exemplified by the complex activation of PC1/3, which requires removal of the signal peptide, removal of the propeptide, and further cleavage of the COOH-terminal tail. Among these excised regions, the propeptide plays a pivotal role in enabling efficient functional expression of convertases. Indeed, not only does it prevent undue and untimely activation, but also it is proposed to act as an intramolecular chaperone. Well documented with degradative subtilisins, this feat relies on intimate protein-protein interactions between the propeptide and its cognate enzyme. Hence, concomitantly with the interaction of the COOH terminus of the propeptide where the primary cleavage site is located and the catalytic site, the propeptide could provide the enzyme with a template for acquiring the correct active conformation. However, this role though firmly established with subtilisins has not been widely documented in the case of convertases with the exception of results obtained from expression of chimeric enzymes (4Creemers J.W. Vey M. Schafer W. Ayoubi T.A. Roebroek A.J. Klenk H.D. Garten W. Van De Ven W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2695-2702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 5Zhou A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 16871-16878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the convertase propeptides are best classified as type I propeptides through their role in folding and inhibition of the enzyme. Following the correct folding of the active site, an autocatalytic process leads to cleavage of the propeptide, which can remain associated with the mature form, thus acting as an auto-inhibitor (9Chapman R.L. Kane S.E. Erickson A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8808-8816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 10Lazure C. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2002; 8: 511-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Based upon the structural relatedness of proconvertases and prosubtilisins, it is predicted that a secondary cleavage site might exist within the propeptide. Indeed, such a secondary cleavage is present in the case of profurin (11Anderson E.D. VanSlyke J.K. Thulin C.D. Jean F. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1508-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), prokexin (12Powner D. Davey J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 400-408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pro-PC1/3 (13Boudreault A. Gauthier D. Lazure C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31574-31580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and pro-PC2 (7Muller L. Cameron A. Fortenberry Y. Apletalina E.V. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39213-39222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Proteolytic cleavage at this secondary site is responsible for disassembly of the enzyme·inhibitor complex and for preventing further inhibition of the cognate enzyme by an otherwise intact propeptide. In most instances, these cleavages are sufficient to generate fully active enzyme, an exception being the activation of pro-PC1/3, which requires further cleavage in the COOH-terminal region. Propeptides in the various convertases represent the first 80-100 residues following the signal peptide. Unlike the very well conserved catalytic and P domains, they show very little sequence conservation except in their COOH-terminal portion. They contain multiple basic residues gathered in two regions namely, the region between positions 45 and 55 and the extreme COOH terminus (Fig. 1). 4The numbering used herein corresponds to the pro-PC1/3 complete sequence devoid of the signal peptide. Thus, the 83-residue propeptide corresponds to residues 1-83. The same applies to the numbering used with other convertases. The COOH-terminally located basic cluster is strongly conserved and represents the site of the first autocatalytic cleavage. In all other convertases, with the exception of PC7, basic residues containing regions represent the site of the second cleavage leading to the degradation of the propeptide and the release of the fully enzymatically active enzyme. In vitro and overexpression studies showed that mutations or removal of the COOH-terminal basic residues abolish the production of mature enzyme and prevent inhibition of the active protease by the propeptide. Studies conducted by various groups revealed that peptides derived from the middle portion (near the second cleavage site) and the NH2-terminal domain of the propeptide were weak inhibitors, whereas peptides derived from the first cleavage site are very potent competitive inhibitors, often in the nanomolar range (11Anderson E.D.

Moreover, it was also shown that the longer the COOH-terminally derived peptides the better was their inhibitory capacity (11Anderson E.D. VanSlyke J.K. Thulin C.D. Jean F. Thomas G.

All these studies taken together indicate that the COOH-terminal portion of the propeptides confers a strong inhibitory potency but appears not to be very discriminative toward its cognate enzyme. Conversely, the remaining NH2-terminal part of the propeptide appears to be responsible for improved selectivity as well as ensuring the tight fit necessary to form the propeptide·enzyme complex as seen with furin and pro-PC1/3. Herein we investigate the ability of certain residues within the propeptide of PC1/3 to confer specificity for its cognate protease. To do so, we performed individual alanine substitution of residues contained within two potential PC1/3 convertase-cleavable clusters as well as substitution of three negatively charged residues, two being specific to PC1/3. We tested the generated mutants in inhibitory assays against PC1/3 and furin. Our results show that the generated mutants can be subdivided in three categories, the first one exhibiting identical inhibition properties to the wild-type propeptide, the second having a diminished inhibition, and finally the third one exhibiting increased inhibition, with Ki values ranging from 0.15 to 24 nm. Some of these mutations appear to be advantageous in increasing the inhibitory potency of the propeptide whereas some others clearly can affect the mechanism of inhibition thus conferring selectivity. Finally, we confirm through mutagenesis the location of the second cleavage site in the PC1/3 propeptide. Expression and Purification of Recombinant mPC1/3 and Human Furin—Recombinant murine PC1/3 is produced using the baculovirus expression system in Sf9 insect cells and whole larva as recently described (20Rabah N. Gauthier D.J. Gauthier D. Lazure C. Protein Expr. Purif. 2004; 37: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Modifications to the original recombinant virus described in Boudreault et al. (21Boudreault A. Gauthier D. Rondeau N. Savaria D. Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Lazure C. Protein Expr. Purif. 1998; 14: 353-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) include substitution of the signal peptide of mPC1/3 by the one of the viral glycoprotein 67 (gp67) to enhance the secretion of the recombinant enzyme into the medium of Spodoptera frugiperda cells. Once expressed, the enzyme is recovered and purified as previously described (20Rabah N. Gauthier D.J. Gauthier D. Lazure C. Protein Expr. Purif. 2004; 37: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 21Boudreault A. Gauthier D. Rondeau N. Savaria D. Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Lazure C. Protein Expr.

Gauthier D. Lazure C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31574-31580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The enzymatic activity of each recombinant convertase is assayed routinely by fluorometric assays using a fluorogenic substrate (22Jean F. Basak A. Rondeau N. Benjannet S. Hendy G.N. Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Lazure C. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 891-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Cloning, Mutagenesis, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant mPC1/3 Propeptides—All the enzymes used for cloning as well as all oligonucleotide primers (Table 1) used in mutagenesis were purchased from Invitrogen. The bacterial expression vector pET24b (+) (Novagen, WI) was modified as previously described (23Nour N. Basak A. Chretien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2886-2895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The cDNA corresponding to the wild-type (WT) mPC1/3 propeptide was amplified by PCR using the NAD000 and NAD001 primer nucleotides (listed in Table 1) and ligated into the vector between the BamH1 and NotI sites. Similarly, the propeptide mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, as described in the manufacturer's protocol. All propeptide cDNA sequences were verified by DNA sequencing. In addition to the 83 residues of mPC1/3 propeptide, the expression construct contains two extensions at the NH2 and COOH termini, MASMTGGQQMGRDP and SVQMAAALEHHHHHH, respectively, to facilitate cloning and purification. Each mPC1/3 propeptide, was expressed as a 112-residue His-tagged polypeptide in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) following induction by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37°C. Following this period, the cells were harvested through centrifugation.TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used for PC1/3 propeptide mutagenesisNameaS denotes the sense strand, whereas A denotes the antisense strand.MutationOligonucleotide sequence (5′ to 3′)NAD000GGATCCGAAGAGGCAGTTTGTTAATGAATGGNAD001TGCGCGCGCCATTTGAACTGAACGTTTACTTCTCPRO1SR50ACACAAAAGCCATCCTGCGAGGTCCCGAAGAAGCGCPRO1AGCGCTTCTTCGGGACCTCGCAGGATGGCTTTTGTGPRO2SR51ACACAAAAGCCATCCTCCGGCGTCCCGAAGAAGCGCPRO2AGCGCTTCTTCGGGACGCCCGAGGATGGCTTTTGTGPRO3SS52AGCCATCCTCGGAGGGCCCGAAGAAGCGCPRO3AGCGCTTCTTCGGGCCCTCCGAGGATGGCCPRO4SR53AGCCATCCTCGGAGGTCCGCAAGAAGCGCTCTTCATATCPRO4AGATATGAAGAGCGCTTCTTGCGGACCTCCGAGGATGGCPRO5SR54ACCTCGGAGGTCCCGAGCAAGCGCTCTTCATATCACTAAGPRO5ACTTAGTGATATGAAGAGCGCTTGCTCGGACCTCCGAGGPRO6SK61AGCGCTCTTCATATCACTGCGAGGTTATCTGATGATGATGCPRO6ACGATCATCATCAGATAACCTCGCAGTGATATGAAGAGCGCPRO7SR62AGCGCTCTTCATATCACTAAGGCGTTATCTGATGATGATCGTGTGACGPRO7ACGTCACACGATCATCATCAGATAACGCCTTAGTGATATGAAGAGCGCPRO8SD65ACACTAAGAGGTTATCTGCTGATGATCGTGTGACGTGGPRO8ACCACGTCACACGATCATCAGCAGATAACCTCTTAGTGPRO9SD66ACACTAAGAGGTTATCTGATGCTGATCGTGTGACGTGGPRO9ACCACGTCACACGATCAGCATCAGATAACCTCTTAGTGPRO10SD67AGAGGTTATCTGATGATGCTCGTGTGACGTGGGCTGAACPRO10AGTTCAGCCCACGTCACACGAGCATCATCAGATAACCTCa S denotes the sense strand, whereas A denotes the antisense strand. Open table in a new tab Propeptide Purification and Chemical Characterization—The bacterial cells were lysed by repeated sonications in the presence of 100 μg/ml lysozyme, and the resulting suspension was loaded unto a Ni+2-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). Following extensive washings of the column, the propeptide was eluted using 1 m imidazole. The eluate was dialyzed against 0.1% acetic acid, and the proteins were subsequently further purified on an analytical Vydac-C4 RP-HPLC column (25 × 0.46 cm, The Separation Group, Hesperia, CA) using a Varian 9010/9050 chromatography system. The aqueous phase consisted of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) in water, and the elution was carried out first isocratically at 10% organic phase (acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) followed by a 1%/min linear gradient of organic phase to 65% with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The elution was monitored by measuring absorbency at 225 nm. Typically, all propeptides eluted between 40 and 43% of the organic phase. A specific polyclonal antibody was obtained in rabbits following repeated immunizations using the complete WT-mPC1/3 propeptide (as described above) bacterially produced and purified; according to procedures developed at the Sheldon Biotechnology Center (McGill, Montreal, Canada). Hence, RP-HPLC fractions were analyzed for propeptide content using this antibody through dot blotting. The content of individual immunoreactive fractions was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by coloration and Western blotting and subsequently pooled and kept at -20 °C. Routinely, starting with a 1-liter culture, ∼5-10 mg of each propeptide can be recovered following purification. The peptide purity and concentration were determined for each mutant by quantitative amino acid analysis following 18-24 h hydrolysis in the presence of 5.7 n HCl in vacuo at 110 °C on a Beckman auto-analyzer (Model 6300) with a postcolumn ninhydrin detection system coupled to a Varian DS604 integrator/plotter. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence, corresponding to ASMTGGQQMGRDPKRQFVNE(W)AAEI (the underlined sequence indicates the NH2 terminus of the mature mPC1/3) was determined through automated Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems Procise 494cLC sequencer (Foster City, CA). Molecular mass determination and mass spectral analysis were done on a Voyager DE-Pro matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight instrument (PerSeptive Biosystems, Cambridge, MA); the propeptide in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was mixed with a freshly prepared solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (10 mg/ml) in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile-0.3% trifluoroacetic acid and 1 μl deposited on the sample plate. Alternatively, a sample corresponding to 0.3 μg of each propeptide was directly injected unto a Zorbax SB-C18 column (0.3 × 250 mm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) connected to a μ-Liquid chromatograph coupled to a QSTAR-XL hybrid LC/MS/MS Mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The data generated were analyzed with the Analyst™-QS V1.1 software (Applied Biosystems/MDS-Sciex). Enzymatic Assays and Kinetic Analysis—All enzymatic assays of recombinant mPC1/3 and human furin were performed using initial rate determinations at room temperature on a SpectraMax Gemini EM spectrofluorometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The assays were done in a final volume of 100 μl in black 96-well flat bottomed plates (Corning Life Sciences, Acton, MA) using 100 μm of the fluorogenic substrate pGlu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-MCA (Peptides International, Louisville, KY, USA). For mPC1/3, the buffer consisted of 100 mm sodium acetate at pH 6.0 containing 10 mm CaCl2. Prior to use, the purified recombinant enzyme was incubated in the presence of Ca2+ for ∼6 h or until the release of AMC was determined as linear, to allow conversion into the fully active 71-kDa form. For human furin, the final assay conditions were 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, with 1 mm CaCl2. The fluorescence of the released 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) was measured using an excitation and an emission wavelength of 370 and 460 nm, respectively. All the assays were started by the addition of the enzyme (corresponding to an activity measured as 15 μm AMC-released/h), and the data points were collected every 30 s. The evaluation of the various inhibition parameters was done as previously described (24Fox T. de Miguel E. Mort J.S. Storer A.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12571-12576Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Briefly, the progress curves obtained for the inhibition of mPC1/3 by its propeptide has been shown to follow a tight binding character and, hence, can be defined by the equation (25Cha S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1975; 24: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), [P] = vst + (vi - vs)/k[1 - e-kt], where P is the product formed (AMC released), vi is the initial velocity, vs is the steady-state velocity, t is the time, and k is the apparent rate constant for inhibition. Progress curves were submitted to non-linear regression curve analysis using the software Grafit 4 (Erithacus Software, Horley, Surrey, UK), which allows the determination of the individual parameters vi, vs, and k for each curve. The obtained k values were then plotted against inhibitor concentrations. However, competitive tight binding inhibitors can display two different behaviors. The first one corresponds to a single-step process (Mechanism A) whereby the enzyme and the inhibitor combine to form a stable complex. In this case the plot k versus [I] is linear and best described by Reaction 1, where K = k2/k1. The second one (Mechanism B) is a two-step process whereby the enzyme·inhibitor complex (E·I) undergoes a conformational change. In this case, the plot k versus [I] saturates with increased amounts of inhibitor deviating from a straight line, and the Ki value can be determined following non-linear regression analysis through curvefitting using Reaction 2. In the case of classic competitive inhibition, the various kinetic parameters are evaluated using the Enzyme Kinetic V1.0 module (SigmaPlot 2000 for Windows V6.1, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). In most cases, the computed results were in close agreement with the equations exhibiting overall fit exceeding 0.990. Propeptide Iodination and Cleavage by Recombinant mPC1/3 and Human Furin—The purified mutant and WT propeptides were chemically labeled with radioactive iodine. For this purpose, 2.5 μg of each propeptide was dried then resuspended in 0.05 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. After the addition of 250 μCi of [Na125I] (Amersham Biosciences), the reaction was started by the addition of 50 μg of chloramine-T in phosphate buffer. The reaction was stopped with 100 μg of sodium metabisulfite. The volume of the reaction was made up to 1 ml with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) in water, and the sample passed trough a Sep-Pak C18 cartridge (Millipore, Billerica, MA) as described in the manufacturer's protocol. The iodinated peptide was recovered by elution with 60% acetonitrile (v/v) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid-water, and the radioactivity present in the elution fractions was determined using an automatic Gamma Counter (LKB-Wallac model 1272). The cleavage reaction was carried out in a total volume of 100 μl containing 2.5 × 105 cpm of radiolabeled propeptide (∼2 nm, based on protein content), the sodium acetate buffer specific for each enzyme as above described and the respective enzyme preparation (50 μm AMC-released/h). After a 30-min incubation period, the reaction was stopped with 10 μl of glacial acetic acid. The sample was dried, reconstituted, and boiled in Laemmli buffer, and its content was analyzed by electrophoresis on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The separated peptides were subsequently electro-transferred overnight unto an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The radioactivity on the membrane was measured using a Storm model 860 Imaging system (Amersham Biosciences) with PhosphorImager capability and using the ImageQuaNT TL software.

Rhodopsin is the best understood member of the large GPCR superfamily and is the only GPCR for which atomic resolution structures have been determined. However, these structures are for the inactive, dark-adapted form. Characterization of the conformational changes in rhodopsin caused by light-induced activation is of wide importance, because the metarhodopsin-II photoproduct is analogous to the agonist-occupied conformation of other GPCRs, and metarhodopsin-I may be similar to antagonist-occupied GPCR conformations. In this work we characterize the interaction of antibody K42-41L with the metarhodopsin photoproducts. K42-41L is shown to inhibit formation of metarhodopsin-II while it stabilizes the metarhodopsin-I state. Thus, K42-41L recognizes an epitope accessible in dark-adapted rhodopsin and metarhodopsin-I that is lost upon formation of metarhodopsin-II. Previous work has shown that the peptide TGALQERSK is able to mimic the K42-41L epitope, and we have now determined the structure of the K42-41L-peptide complex. The structure demonstrates a central role for elements of the rhodopsin C3 loop, particularly Gln238 and Glu239, in the interaction with K42-41L. Geometric constraints taken from the antibody-bound peptide were used to model the epitope on the rhodopsin surface. The resulting model suggests that K42-41L locks the C3 loop into an extended conformation that is intermediate between two compact conformations seen in crystal structures of dark-adapted rhodopsin. Together, the structural and functional data strongly suggest that the equilibrium between metarhodopsin-I and metarhodopsin-II is dependent upon the conformation of the C3 loop.

It is an efficient photoreceptor, with the chromophoric retinal cofactor undergoing photoisomerization from 11-cis to all-trans upon activation. The retinal isomerization propagates conformational changes through the light-excited rhodopsin protein to a meta-stable active state, metarhodopsin-II, which is in equilibrium with the inactive metarhodopsin-I precursor (see Fig. 1A). Metarhodopsin-II binds to the heterotrimeric G-protein transducin (Gt) and triggers GDP release followed by GTP uptake (2Okada T. Ernst O.P. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Trends Biochem.

The rhodopsin system is considered a prototypical model for the GPCR superfamily, and recent work has produced new insights on the biochemistry of rhodopsin (1Sakmar T.P. Menon S.T. Marin E.P.

Sci. 2001; 26: 318-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). However, many questions remain unanswered, particularly with respect to the mechanism of receptor and G-protein activation. Metarhodopsin-II is characterized by its specific ability to bind and activate multiple copies of the heterotrimeric G-protein transducin (Gtαβγ) in rapid succession (5Heck M. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol.

There is, however, very little structural information at the atomic level regarding the interactions of these elements with transducin. Five crystal structures of dark-adapted rhodopsin have been determined (10Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E.

Collectively, these structures provide a framework within which detailed conformational changes associated with formation of metarhodopsin-I and metarhodopsin-II may be addressed. Further, the structures imply that several elements on the cytoplasmic face of dark-adapted rhodopsin are flexible, including the C3 loop and the C-terminal tail. Portions of the C3 loop are disordered in three of the five structures reported to date (10Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T.

Biol. 2004; 343: 1409-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar) and Okada et al. (PDB ID 1U19) (14Okada T. Sugihara M. Bondar A.N. Elstner M. Entel P. Buss V. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar) show very different conformations for the C3 loop. The C3 loop is “ordered” in these structures (1GZM and 1U19) but the B-factors for the Cα atoms are high (rising above 100 Å2), suggesting that each of these models represents a family of related conformations, rather than a single, well defined structure. These data, together with site-specific spin labeling (15Hubbell W.L. Altenbach C. Hubbell C.M. Khorana H.G. Adv. Protein Chem. 2003; 63: 243-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), suggest that the C3 loop and C-terminal tail are dynamic structural elements in the dark-adapted state. Dunker and coworkers (16Iakoucheva L.M. Brown C.J. Lawson J.D. Obradovic Z. Dunker A.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 323: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar, 17Dunker A.K. Brown C.J. Lawson J.D. Iakoucheva L.M. Obradovic Z. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6573-6582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar) have recently pointed out that cell-signaling proteins often interact through highly flexible regions that form well structured signaling complexes. A 5.5-Å electron crystallographic study of metarhodopsin-I has recently been published (18Ruprecht J.J. Mielke T. Vogel R. Villa C. Schertler G.F. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3609-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Comparison of this intermediate-resolution electron density map with the x-ray structures of dark-adapted rhodopsin shows that the structure of metarhodopsin-I is quite similar to that of the dark-adapted ground state. Thus, formation of metarhodopsin-I occurs without large rigid-body movements of the transmembrane helices, implying that the large conformational changes thought to accompany formation of metarhodopsin-II occur later in the photobleaching process. The electron crystallography map shows clear density for most of metarhodopsin-I, but as is the case for many crystal structures of dark-adapted rhodopsin, density for the C3 loop is absent, suggesting conformational flexibility for the C3 loop in the meta-I state. Structural information for metarhodopsin-II is more limited, although models have been proposed (19Ishiguro M. Oyama Y. Hirano T. Chembiochem. 2004; 5: 298-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 20Nikiforovich G.V. Marshall G.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9110-9120Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These models are based in large part on site-specific spin labeling studies that demonstrate a substantial conformational change upon formation of metarhodopsin-II (21Altenbach C. Yang K.

The antibody imprint technique has been proposed to overcome difficulties inherent in the structural characterization of transient protein conformations or proteins that have eluded crystallization (24Burritt J.B.

Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2453-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This technique rests upon the primary immunological principle that the antigen recognition site of an antibody is complementary to the structure of the antigen and thus reflects the local topological features of its epitope (24Burritt J.B. Busse S.C. Gizachew D. Siemsen D.W. Quinn M.T. Bond C.W. Dratz E.A. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24847-24852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 26Mumey B.M.

Immunobiology: The Immune System in Health and Disease. 5th. Garland Publishing, New York2001Google Scholar). A combination of techniques is used to access this structural information. First, peptides that bind to an antibody are identified. These peptides might represent fragments of the protein of interest or, more commonly, are identified by phage display of random peptide libraries (29Burritt J.B. Bond C.W. Doss K.W. Jesaitis A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 238: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 30Scott J.K. Smith G.P. Science. 1990; 249: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). Peptides selected from phage display are particularly useful in dealing with discontinuous antibody epitopes, which are quite common (31Laver W.G. Air G.M. Webster R.G. Smith-Gill S.J. Cell. 1990; 61: 553-556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 32Padlan E.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1996; 49: 57-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Residues within the selected peptides are then mapped back to the primary structure of the target protein using techniques common to epitope mapping. We have been developing new computational techniques to determine the optimal epitope mapping (26Mumey B.M. Bailey B.W. Kirkpatrick B. Jesaitis A.J. Angel T. Dratz E.A. J. Comput. Biol. 2003; 10: 555-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 27Bailey B.W. Mumey B. Hargrave P.A. Arendt A. Ernst O.P. Hofmann K.P. Callis P.R. Burritt J.B. Jesaitis A.J. Dratz E.A. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2453-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In favorable cases more detailed information can be obtained by determining the structures of these peptides when they are bound to their complementary antibodies using NMR (24Burritt J.B. Busse S.C. Gizachew D. Siemsen D.W. Quinn M.T. Bond C.W. Dratz E.A. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24847-24852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), or like the present work, by x-ray diffraction. The resulting structure of the peptide and the antibody surface provide numerous constraints that can be used to model the structure of the epitope on the surface of the native protein antigen. In previous work, the antibody imprint technique has been used to identify a consensus peptide sequence that mimics a discontinuous epitope on the surface of flavocytochrome b (24Burritt J.B. Busse S.C. Gizachew D. Siemsen D.W. Quinn M.T. Bond C.W. Dratz E.A. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol.

Haematol. 2000; 65: 407-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The peptide was mapped to two discontinuous regions of the protein that are folded closely together but are 150 residues and two transmembrane spans apart in the primary protein sequence. The structure of the antibody-bound peptide was determined by transferred nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy NMR studies and provided constraints that allowed modeling of the native epitope (24Burritt J.B. Busse S.C. Gizachew D. Siemsen D.W. Quinn M.T. Bond C.W. Dratz E.A. Jesaitis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24847-24852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). More recently, Bailey et al. (27Bailey B.W. Mumey B. Hargrave P.A. Arendt A. Ernst O.P. Hofmann K.P. Callis P.R. Burritt J.B. Jesaitis A.J. Dratz E.A. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2453-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) initiated antibody imprint studies of light-excited rhodopsin to probe its meta-stable conformations. This work utilized a library of monoclonal antibodies developed against opsin. Included in this library is K42-41L, a murine monoclonal antibody first described by Adamus et al. (34Adamus G. Arendt A. Zam Z.S. McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.A. Pept. Res. 1988; 1: 42-47PubMed Google Scholar). Adamus et al. concluded that the primary epitope of K42-41L was contained within the C3 loop of rhodopsin (residues 230-252) by showing that a peptide fragment representing the C3 loop effectively competed against rhodopsin for binding to K42-41L. In contrast, peptides representing other surface loops did not show detectable competitive activity against this antibody. Bailey et al. (27Bailey B.W. Mumey B. Hargrave P.A. Arendt A. Ernst O.P. Hofmann K.P. Callis P.R. Burritt J.B. Jesaitis A.J. Dratz E.A. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2453-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) employed a random sequence peptide library displayed on phage to select small peptides that bind to K42-41L. Ninety phage clones were selected from the J404 9-mer peptide library (29Burritt J.B. Bond C.W. Doss K.W. Jesaitis A.J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 238: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and sequenced. Sequence alignment of the bound clones yielded the consensus sequence TGALQERSK. This peptide was found to compete effectively against rhodopsin for binding to K42-41L. The interaction of K42-41L with light-excited rhodopsin was also examined, providing preliminary evidence that this antibody inhibits formation of metarhodopsin-II (27Bailey B.W. Mumey B. Hargrave P.A. Arendt A. Ernst O.P. Hofmann K.P. Callis P.R. Burritt J.B. Jesaitis A.J. Dratz E.A. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 2453-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this work we report further characterization of the interaction of K42-41L with dark-adapted and light-excited rhodopsin. We show that K42-41L can discriminate between metarhodopsin-I and metarhodopsin-II, inhibiting formation of metarhodopsin-II under several conditions while stabilizing metarhodopsin-I. In addition, we have determined the crystal structure of Fab K42-41L bound to a peptide that mimics the native epitope (TGALQERSK). Geometric constraints taken from the structure of the peptide in the K42-41L-peptide complex were used to model the conformation of the native epitope. This model suggests that K42-41L recognizes a solvent-exposed conformation of the C3 loop that is intermediate between the compact conformations seen in two crystal structures of dark-adapted rhodopsin (1GZM and 1U19). The discriminating activity of K42-41L indicates that the conformation of the C3 loop that binds K42-41L can be attained in both dark-adapted rhodopsin and metarhodopsin-I, but this conformation must be significantly different from that present in metarhodopsin-II. Taken together, the structural and functional data suggest that the equilibrium between inactive metarhodopsin-I and active metarhodopsin-II is dependent upon the conformation of the C3 loop. Rod Outer Segment Preparation—Bovine retinas were obtained from Schenk Packing Co. (Stanwood, WA). Manipulations of retinas, rod outer segments (ROS), and rhodopsin were carried out under dim red light unless otherwise indicated. Retinas were suspended in ice-cold Kuhn's buffer (0.05 m monobasic potassium phosphate, 0.015 m dibasic potassium phosphate, 1 mm Mg(OAc)2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, sparged with argon). ROS were sheared from the retinas by mechanical shaking (35Stone W.L. Farnsworth C.C. Dratz E.A. Exp. Eye Res. 1979; 28: 387-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), purified with discontinuous sucrose gradients (27.0%, 28.7%, 34.0%, and 38.0%), and stored in liquid nitrogen. The purity of the rod outer segments was determined by measuring the ratio of total protein absorbing at 280 nm to photoactivatable rhodopsin. Rhodopsin concentrations were calculated from the difference spectrum (unbleached-bleached) at 500 nm (Δ500) in the presence of 3% lauryldimethylamine N-oxide using a molar extinction coefficient of 40,600 m-1 cm-1. A typical A280/Δ500 ratio for the rod outer segments was ∼2. Light Titration Experiments—Rhodopsin rod outer segment membranes used in light titration experiments (36Parkes J.H. Gibson S.K. Liebman P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6862-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) were suspended in buffer A (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2), and the final pH was adjusted for the given experiment. Prior to light titration experiments, working stock solutions of rod outer segments were briefly sonicated, and rhodopsin concentrations were determined by measuring the Δ500. The concentrations of rhodopsin were then adjusted to 7.5 μm by addition of buffer A at the appropriate pH. For each light titration experiment, an aliquot of rhodopsin was bleached with a series of millisecond flashes at 50-s intervals, and absorbance changes were measured during each interval. Each flash bleached ∼8% of the rhodopsin. The appearance of metarhodopsin-II was detected by monitoring the difference in absorbance between 390 nm and 417 nm (36Parkes J.H. Gibson S.K. Liebman P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6862-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), using an Olis/Shimadzu UV-3000 dual wavelength spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature-controlled cuvette holder and a sampling compartment purged with dry nitrogen gas. All light titration experiments were performed at 4 °C. For measurement of low pH-stabilized metarhodopsin-II, aliquots of rod outer segment were diluted in buffer A at pH 6.7. For assays that included K42-41L, the antibody was present at a concentration of 2.0 μm. The peptide Ac-VLEDLRS(Abu)GLF, a high affinity analog of the C-terminal tail of the transducin α subunit (37Aris L. Gilchrist A. Rens-Domiano S. Meyer C. Schatz P.J. Dratz E.A. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2333-2339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), was used to stabilize metarhodopsin-II at pH 8.0. Light titration assays involving peptide were done with buffer A at pH 8.0. Synthetic peptides were synthesized employing a Protein Technologies PS3 peptide synthesizer and purified by high-performance liquid chromatography. The purified peptide masses were determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Stock solutions of the peptides were prepared by dissolving the peptide in buffer A at pH 8.0. Difference Absorbance Spectra—Absorbance spectra of rhodopsin with and without antibody K42-41L were measured in a Cary 50 spectrophotometer with a temperature-controlled sample holder and sampling compartment purged with dry nitrogen. Absorbance spectra were acquired at 4 °C at pH 8.1. A rhodopsin stock solution (38 μm) was made by diluting rod outer segments in buffer A containing 5 mm dodecyl maltoside (Calbiochem). The final rhodopsin concentration was 3.2 μm, and the final dodecyl maltoside concentration was 2.0 mm. Rhodopsin samples were placed in the temperature-controlled sample holder, and the temperature was allowed to equilibrate. Spectra of unactivated rhodopsin were measured. The sample was then illuminated with >500 nm light from a Fiber Photics Illuminator 150 for 10 s while the absorbance spectra were acquired. The pH of the samples was measured following recording of spectra. Difference spectra were deconvoluted by fitting summed synthetic Gaussian curves for metarhodopsin-I, metarhodopsin-II and rhodopsin. ELISA—Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were performed using polyvinyl chloride microtiter plates coated with bovine rhodopsin in purified rod outer segments (ROSs). The rhodopsin was prepared by adding 1 ml of 10 mm PBS, pH 7.4, to a 200-μl aliquot of 300 μm rhodopsin in dark- or light-exposed ROS, followed by brief sonication. 100-μl aliquots of rhodopsin solution were added to microtiter plates under dim red light and incubated at 4 °C for 8 h, washed three times with PBS, and then blocked with 5% (w/v) milk protein, 0.02% NaN3 in PBS. A serial dilution of K42-41L was added to the coated and blocked microtiter plate to measure antibody binding to dark-adapted rhodopsin and light-exposed opsin. For competition ELISA, microtiter plates were prepared as described above with addition of antibody K42-41L to all wells of the microtiter plates at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Stock solutions (5 mm) of synthetic peptides TQKAEKEVTR-NH2, TGALQERSK, and TETSQVAPA were made in PBS, and the peptides were added in the amount indicated per assay. The microtiter plates were incubated for 4 h on an orbital shaker at room temperature and then rinsed three times with PBS to remove unbound antibody. Binding of antibody K42-41L was detected by the addition of alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (GAM-AP, Zymed Laboratories Inc.) diluted 1:10,000 in PBS. Following the addition of GAM-AP, plates were incubated for 4 h at room temperature on an orbital shaker and washed three times with PBS. Following the addition of NBT/BCIP substrate, bound GAM-AP was detected by measuring absorbance at 405 nm. Sequencing of K42-41L—The sequence of the antibody was obtained as follows: Total mRNA was extracted from a mouse hybridoma cell line producing antibody K42-41L (38Adamus G. Zam Z.S. Arendt A. Palczewski K. McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.A. Vision Res. 1991; 31: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) using the QuickPrep mRNA purification kit (Amersham Biosciences). Variable heavy and variable light chain cDNA were amplified from the total mRNA using a set of degenerate mouse variable heavy and variable light chain primers (39Barbas C.F.I. Silverman G.J. Scott J.K. Burton D.R. Phage Display, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York2001Google Scholar). Amplified variable heavy and variable light chain DNA was gel-purified and sequenced. The amino acid sequence of K42-41L was verified, in part, by mass spectrometry and Edman degradation. Expression and Purification—Expression of the murine monoclonal antibody K42-41L was done as previously described (38Adamus G. Zam Z.S. Arendt A. Palczewski K. McDowell J.H. Hargrave P.A. Vision Res. 1991; 31: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Fab fragments were generated by papain digestion (0.4 μm, ICN) in the presence of 25 mm β-mercaptoethanol, with an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:100 (w/w). The reaction was stopped by dialyzing against PBS to remove β-mercaptoethanol, and the completeness of the digestion was verified by SDS-PAGE. Fab fragments were purified from the Fc fragment by anion exchange chromatography using a Mono-Q column on an Amersham Biosciences fast-protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) with a linear elution gradient from 0 to 0.3 m NaCl in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.1. Fractions containing Fab K42-41L were concentrated and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex-75 column (Amersham Biosciences) in 10 mm MES, pH 6.5. Purified Fab fractions were pooled and concentrated to 4.0 mg/ml using Amicon Ultra 3500 MWCO centrifugal filters (Millipore, Inc.). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as a standard (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217487) Google Scholar). Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE analysis with or without reducing agent (dithiothreitol). The overall yield was ∼2.5 mg of purified Fab from 10 mg of pure monoclonal antibody. Crystallization and Data Collection—Purified Fab K42-41L was crystallized at 18 °C by hanging drop vapor diffusion. Drops were assembled with 2 μl of Fab mixed with 1 μl of peptide TGALQERSK (16 mg/ml) and 2 μl of well solution (0.1 m MES pH 6.5, 0.1 m (NH4)2SO4, 20% polyethylene glycol-monomethyl ether 5000). Crystals grew in ∼4 weeks. The peptide stock solution was analyzed, post-crystallization, by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. It was shown that partial hydrolysis of the peptide had occurred, resulting in a mixed population in which some peptide had lost the serine and lysine residues. Therefore, a reduced occupancy of the C-terminal residues in the crystal is likely to have occurred, and may actually have promoted crystallization. Single crystals were soaked in 25% glycerol for 3 h and flash frozen in liqu"
