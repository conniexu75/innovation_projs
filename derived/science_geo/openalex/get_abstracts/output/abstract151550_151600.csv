In rats, the highest expression of APJ mRNA was detected in the lung, suggesting that APJ and its ligand play an important role in the pulmonary system. When apelin-36 and its pyroglutamylated C-terminal peptide, [<Glu65]apelin-13, were compared in microphysiometric analyses, the elevation of extracellular acidification induced in cells expressing APJ by [<Glu65]apelin-13 was transient, whereas that by apelin-36 was sustained. These responses were almost completely inhibited by a specific inhibitor for Gi or that for Na+/H+ exchanger. 125I -Labeled [<Glu65]apelin-13 analogue specifically bound to APJ with a high affinity, and [<Glu65]apelin-13 was more potent than apelin-36 in competitive inhibition assays. Because pretreatment with apelin-36 but not [<Glu65]apelin-13 drastically reduced the binding of the labeled apelin to APJ, the different patterns of acidification induced by these two peptides appeared to reflect their dissociation rather than association with APJ. Apelin elicited the migration of APJ-expressing cells, and [<Glu65]apelin-13 was more potent than apelin-36 in this activity. Heterogeneous molecular forms of apelin corresponding to apelin-36 and [<Glu65]apelin-13 were produced in bovine colostrum. Apelin-36 and [<Glu65]apelin-13 might have different functions in vivo and in vitro. We have recently identified apelin as the endogenous ligand for human APJ.

Despite the significant structural relationship between angiotensin II receptor and APJ (i.e. 30–40% identity in amino acid sequences), angiotensin II did not interact with APJ expressed in fibroblasts (1.O'Dowd B.F. Heiber M. Chan A. Heng H.H.Q. Tsui L.-C. Kennedy J.L. Shi X. Petronis A. George S.R. Nguyen T.

Hinuma S. Kitada C. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Fujino M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). APJ had been thus originally classified into a ligand-unknown “orphan” 7TMR. On the other hand, APJ reportedly acts as one of candidate coreceptors, together with CD4, in the process of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection (3.Choe H. Farzan M. Konkel M. Martin K.

However, the molecular and functional characteristics of APJ have not been analyzed enough, because its endogenous ligand is still unidentified. Although the first demonstration of identifying orphan 7TMR ligands was the discovery of orphanin/nociceptin (5.Reinscheid R.K. Nothacker H.P. Bourson A. Ardati A. Henningsen R.A. Bunzow J.R.

Nature. 1995; 377: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar), we have recently established a strategy widely applicable for identifying orphan 7TMR ligands by detecting signal transductions in CHO cells expressing orphan 7TMRs (2.Tatemoto K. Hosoya M. Habata Y. Fujii R. Kakegawa T. Zou M.-X. Kawamata Y. Fukusumi S. Hinuma S. Kitada C. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Fujino M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Med. 1999; 77: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). By the application of this strategy, we found that the peptide-enriched fractions prepared from bovine stomach tissues showed activities to promote specifically extracellular acidification in CHO cells expressing APJ in the microphysiometric assay, and we then succeeded in identifying an endogenous peptidic APJ ligand. In addition, we isolated bovine, human, rat, and mouse cDNAs encoding the ligand peptide (2.Tatemoto K. Hosoya M. Habata Y. Fujii R. Kakegawa T. Zou M.-X. Kawamata Y. Fukusumi S. Hinuma S. Kitada C.

Nishizawa N. Murosaki S. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Tatemoto K. Fujino M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1452: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). We named the ligand peptide “apelin” after APJ endogenousligand (2.Tatemoto K. Hosoya M. Habata Y. Fujii R. Kakegawa T. Zou M.-X. Kawamata Y. Fukusumi S. Hinuma S. Kitada C. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Fujino M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Although a mature apelin peptide consists of 36 amino acid residues (apelin-36), we found that the shorter C-terminal peptides, with a length of 13 amino acids (apelin-13) and its N-terminal pyroglutamylated form, [<Glu65]apelin-13, showed higher acidification rate-promoting and cAMP production-inhibitory activities than apelin-36 (2.Tatemoto K. Hosoya M. Habata Y. Fujii R. Kakegawa T. Zou M.-X. Kawamata Y. Fukusumi S. Hinuma S. Kitada C. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Fujino M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). In this study, we isolated a rat APJ cDNA and analyzed the distribution of its mRNA in rat tissues. We subsequently analyzed functional differences in the interaction with APJ between apelin-36 and [<Glu65]apelin-13 and found that the N-terminal portion of apelin-36 could modulate the interaction with APJ, although an essential structure for binding localized in the C-terminal portion. In addition, We demonstrated that apelin shows a chemotactic action and that heterogeneous molecular forms of apelin including shorter forms corresponding to [<Glu65]apelin-13 are produced in vivo in bovine colostrum. Rat APJ cDNA fragments were isolated from poly(A)+ RNA of rat brain by the 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method using a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Primers used were 5′-GACAAAGATGAGGTAGCTGCTGAG-3′ (F1) and 5′-GTCGAGCGTTAGCCACTGGCC-3′ (F2) for 5′-RACE and 5′-TGTTACTTCTTCATTGCCCAAACCAT-3′ (R1), 5′-TGGGGTGTCCTCCACTGCTGT-3′ (R2), and 5′-ACTCAGAGTGGGCCTGGGAGG-3′ (R3) for 3′-RACE. First PCR was carried out using F2 for 5′-RACE or R3 for 3′-RACE in combination with the adapter primer 1 provided with the kit in a 25-μl reaction mixture prepared with appropriately diluted cDNAs, 0.2 μm primers, 1.25 units of ExTaq DNA polymerase (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan) treated with TaqStart antibody (CLONTECH), 0.1 mm dNTPs, and the reaction buffer supplemented with the polymerase. Amplification in the first PCR was conducted under the following conditions: at 94 °C for 2 min for the denaturation of the template and the activation of ExTaq DNA polymerase; 5 cycles at 98 °C for 10 s and at 72 °C for 2 min; 5 cycles at 98 °C for 10 s and at 70 °C for 2 min; and 25 cycles at 98 °C for 10 s and at 68 °C for 2 min. The second PCR was carried out using F1 and F2 for 5′-RACE or R1, R2 and R3 for 3′-RACE with 1.0 μl of the reaction mixture from the first PCR in combination with adapter primers 1 and 2 provided with the kit, and the final amplification step was elongated to 33 cycles. DNA sequences of cDNA fragments amplified were determined with a model 377 DNA sequencer (PE Biosystems) and analyzed with the computer software DNASIS (Hitachi Software Engineering, Yokohama, Japan). A cDNA fragment with the entire open reading frame for expression vector construction was amplified from rat heart cDNA with a primer set (5′-AAGCACCCTCAGACCACTTACTC-3′ and 5′-TTTGCAAGGCTCCTTCCCTTTCC-3′) based on the sequences obtained from the above cDNA fragments. PCR was carried out in a 25-μl reaction mixture prepared with appropriately diluted cDNAs, 0.2 μm primers, 1.25 units of KlenTaq DNA polymerase (CLONTECH) treated with TaqStart antibody (CLONTECH), 0.1 mm dNTP, and the reaction buffer supplemented with the polymerase. Amplification was conducted under the following conditions: at 94 °C for 2 min for the denaturation of the template and the activation of KlenTaq DNA polymerase; 30 cycles at 98 °C for 10 s and at 68 °C for 30 s for amplification; and at 72 °C for 1 min for extension. CHO cells expressing human APJ (CHO-A10) were established as described previously (2.Tatemoto K. Hosoya M. Habata Y. Fujii R. Kakegawa T. Zou M.-X. Kawamata Y. Fukusumi S. Hinuma S. Kitada C. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Fujino M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). CHO cells expressing rat APJ were prepared principally by the same method. Poly(A)+ RNAs were prepared from the tissues of adult (8–12-week-old) and neonate (0–3-day-old) Wistar rats as described previously (9.Habata Y. Fujii R. Hosoya M. Fukusumi S. Kawamata Y. Hinuma S. Kitada C. Nishizawa N. Murosaki S. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Tatemoto K. Fujino M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1452: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). We quantified rat APJ mRNA by means of a Prism 7700 sequence detector (PE Biosystems) with a primer set (5′-CCACCTGGTGAAGACTCTCTACA-3′ and 5′-TGACGTAACTGATGCAGGTGC-3′) and a probe labeled with fluorescent dyes (5′-(FAM)-TGACAGCTTCCTCATGAATGTCTTTCCC-(TAMRA)-3′). RT-PCR was carried out in a 25-μl reaction mixture prepared with a TaqMan PCR core reagent kit (PE Biosystems) containing an appropriately diluted cDNA solution, 0.2 μm each primer, and 0.1 μm probe. PCR was performed under the following conditions: at 50 °C for 10 min for the reaction of uracil-N-glycosylase to prevent the amplification of PCR products carried over; at 95 °C for 2 min for the activation of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase; and 43 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and at 55 °C for 90 s for the amplification. The quantification of APJ mRNA in neonatal tissues was carried out principally according to the conditions described above, but amplification was performed by 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and at 57 °C for 90 s. In order to obtain a calibration curve, we amplified the known amount of a cDNA fragment of rat APJ in the same manner as the samples. A good linear relationship was obtained between the amount of rat APJ cDNA input and the release of the reporter dye within the range of 10 to 106 copies. Rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was also measured as an internal control as described previously (9.Habata Y. Fujii R. Hosoya M. Fukusumi S. Kawamata Y. Hinuma S. Kitada C. Nishizawa N. Murosaki S. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Tatemoto K. Fujino M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1452: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Extracellular acidification rates were measured with a Cytosensor (Molecular Devices Corp.) as described previously (2.Tatemoto K. Hosoya M. Habata Y. Fujii R. Kakegawa T. Zou M.-X. Kawamata Y. Fukusumi S. Hinuma S. Kitada C. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Fujino M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). CHO cells expressing human or rat APJ were dispersed with trypsin, and the cells were dispensed into cell capsules (Molecular Devices) at 2.7 × 105 cells/capsule and cultured overnight. Then, each cell capsule was set to the device, and the cells were continuously loaded with a low-buffered RPMI 1640 medium (Molecular Devices) until the rate of acidification became stable. The acidification rates were measured every 120 s (flow on at 100 μl/min for 80 s; flow off for 8 s; measuring acidification rates for 30 s). For the treatment of pertussis toxin (PTX), CHO-A10 cells were seeded at 9 × 104 cells/capsule and cultured overnight, and then 100 ng/ml PTX (P-9452, Sigma) was added to the culture 24 h before setting the capsules to the device. Methyl-isobutyl amirolide (MIA) (Research Biochemicals Inc., MA, USA) was dissolved in the low-buffered RPMI 1640 medium at 10 μm and exposed to the cells just before adding samples. Apelin-36 (human), [<Glu65]apelin-13, and [<Glu65,Nle75,Tyr77]apelin-13 were synthesized using an automatic peptide synthesizer (model 430, PE Biosystems) and purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (reversed-phase HPLC) as described previously (2.Tatemoto K. Hosoya M. Habata Y. Fujii R. Kakegawa T. Zou M.-X. Kawamata Y. Fukusumi S. Hinuma S. Kitada C. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Fujino M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). [<Glu65,Nle75,Tyr77]apelin-13 was radioiodinated with Na125I (IMS-30, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by a method using lactoperoxidase (Sigma) as described elsewhere (10.Ohtaki T. Watanabe T. Ishibashi Y. Kitada C. Tsuda M. Gottschall P.E. Arimura A. Fujino M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 838-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). After the reaction, the labeled and unlabeled peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC. Aliquots of the labeled peptide were stored at −30 °C until used. The membrane fractions of CHO-A10 cells prepared by the method as described previously (11.Fukusumi S. Kitada C. Takekawa S. Kizawa H. Sakamoto J. Miyamoto M. Hinuma S. Kitano K. Fujino M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 232: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) were incubated with [125I][<Glu65,Nle75,Tyr77]apelin-13 in 100 μl of the binding buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 96-well microplates (Serocluster, Corning Costar Corp.) at room temperature for 90 min. In order to determine the amounts of nonspecific binding, unlabeled [<Glu65,Nle75,Tyr77]apelin-13 was simultaneously added to the wells. After incubation, bound and free radioactivities were separated through rapid filtration using the glass-fiber filter units (GF/C, Packard Instrument Co.) of a 96-well cell harvester (Packard). The filter units were completely dried, and Microcinti O (Packard) was added to each well. The radioactivity of each well was counted with a TopCount liquid scintillation counter (Packard). The dissociation constant (K d) and the number of binding sites (B max) were determined by the method of Scatchard (12.Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17749) Google Scholar). CHO-A10 cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/well in 24-well tissue culture plates and grown for 2 days. Prior to the binding experiments, the cells were washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.05% BSA. In order to determine the amount of nonspecific binding, 1 μm unlabeled [<Glu65,Nle75,Tyr77]apelin-13 was added to the wells. The cells were incubated with 200 pm[125I][<Glu65,Nle75,Tyr77]apelin-13 for the time desired at room temperature. After the incubation, the cells were washed four times with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.05% BSA and then lysed with 0.2 N NaOH containing 1% SDS. The radioactivity of the cell lysate was measured with a gamma counter (Beckman). The binding of radiolabeled apelin to the cells after exposure to unlabeled apelin was determined as follows. CHO-A10 cells were incubated with 1 mm[<Glu65]apelin-13 or apelin-36 for 90 min and then washed four times with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 0.05% BSA to remove unbound peptides. After the cells were incubated with the radiolabeled apelin, the amount of the labeled apelin bound to the cells was determined as described above. Chemotactic assays were performed with 96-well microchemotaxis chambers (Neuro Probe). [<Glu65]apelin-13 and apelin-36 were diluted with Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium supplemented with 0.5% BSA (Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium/BSA), and 37 μl of each diluted solution was added to separate lower chambers. A polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate-framed filter with 5-μm pores (Neuro Probe), after being precoated with 10 μg/ml bovine fibronectin (Yagai Research Center, Yamagata, Japan), was used to separate the upper and lower chambers. CHO-A10 cells and mock-transfected CHO cells were harvested and suspended in Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium/BSA. Cell suspensions at 1 × 105 cells/200 μl/well were added to the upper chamber. The chemotaxis chamber was incubated at 37 °C for 4 h in a CO2 incubator with 5% CO2 in air. After the nonmigrating cells on the upper surface of the filter were scraped off, those migrating to the bottom of the filter were fixed and stained with Diff-Quick (International Reagent Corporation, Hyogo, Japan), and the absorbance at 570 nm was measured with a Benchmark microplate reader (Bio-Rad). Colostrum from Holstein cows was boiled for 15 min, supplemented with up to 1m acetic acid, and homogenized using a Polytron homogenizer. The clear supernatant prepared by centrifugation was fractionated as described previously (2.Tatemoto K. Hosoya M. Habata Y. Fujii R. Kakegawa T. Zou M.-X. Kawamata Y. Fukusumi S. Hinuma S. Kitada C. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Fujino M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). In brief, the fraction eluted with 30% acetonitrile in C18 open column (Prep C18, Waters) chromatography was applied to HiPrep CM-Sepharose FF column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The eluate with 0.5 m ammonium acetate was treated with acetone, and desalted with Sep-Pak C18 column (Waters). After lyophilization, this fraction was applied on Superdex Peptide gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) chromatography. Synthetic apelin-36 and [<Glu65]apelin-13 were applied on the same chromatography in order to determine fraction in which they were eluted. Apelin present in each fraction was detected on the basis of the cAMP production-inhibitory activity on CHO-A10 cells stimulated with forskolin as described previously (9.Habata Y. Fujii R. Hosoya M. Fukusumi S. Kawamata Y. Hinuma S. Kitada C. Nishizawa N. Murosaki S. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Tatemoto K. Fujino M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1452: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). A rat APJ cDNA was isolated from rat brain poly(A)+ RNA. The cDNA encoded a protein with a length of 377 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequences of rat and human APJ are aligned in Fig.1. Amino acid identity between the two sequences was 87.2%. We confirmed that CHO cells expressing rat APJ as well as those expressing human APJ specifically responded to [<Glu65]apelin-13 in a dose-dependent manner in the microphysiometric assay (data not shown). We analyzed the precise distribution of APJ mRNA in rat tissues by a quantitative RT-PCR method. As shown in Fig. 2, we detected APJ mRNA in almost all tissues tested, although their quantity varied considerably among the tissues. The highest expression was detected in the lungs of infants, and a comparable level of expression was also detected in those of adults. Interestingly, APJ mRNA expression tended to be higher in infant tissues (e.g. the kidney, stomach, and intestine) than those in adults. In the peripheral tissues of adults, moderate levels of expression were widely detected in the heart, thyroid gland, kidney, adrenal gland, adipose, ovary, uterus, femur, costal cartilage, and placenta. Similar levels of expression were also detected in the central nervous system in adults, such as the hypothalamus, medulla oblongata, and spinal cord. In these experiments, the levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA expression were almost consistent among the tissues, within the range of 0.7 × 105 to 9.1 × 105 copies/ng of poly(A)+ RNA except for pituitary, heart, and mammary gland (1.1 × 106 to 2.2 × 106 copies/ng of poly(A)+ RNA) and skeletal muscle (4.6 × 106 copies/ng of poly(A)+ RNA). We exposed CHO-A10 cells with [<Glu65]apelin-13 and human apelin-36 for a relatively long time (7 min 2 s). As shown in Fig.3, the promotion of acidification rate induced by [<Glu65]apelin-13 reached a maximum at 7 cycles under the experimental conditions employed here. The maximum acidification rate induced by [<Glu65]apelin-13 at 0.1 nm was 140%, and it reached a plateau (i.e.approximately 180%) at 1 and 10 nm. After the removal of [<Glu65]apelin-13, the elevated acidification rates gradually declined and returned to the basal level by 20 cycles at all doses examined. The acidification rate promoted by apelin-36 reached a maximum at the same number of cycles as [<Glu65]apelin-13. Although the maximum acidification rate induced by apelin-36 at 1 nm was lower (i.e. 120%) than that of [<Glu65]apelin-13, it reached the same plateau level as [<Glu65]apelin-13 at 10 and 100 nm. However, changes in the acidification rate after removal of the samples were quite distinctive between [<Glu65]apelin-13 and apelin-36; the elevated acidification rates induced by apelin-36 at 10 to 100 nmwere kept at a high level even after 20 cycles. In order to compare intracellular mechanisms by which [<Glu65]apelin-13 and apelin-36 caused extracellular acidification in CHO-A10 cells, we examined the effects of enzyme inhibitors. Because apelin could effectively inhibit the forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in CHO-A10 cells (2.Tatemoto K. Hosoya M. Habata Y. Fujii R. Kakegawa T. Zou M.-X. Kawamata Y. Fukusumi S. Hinuma S. Kitada C. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Fujino M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar, 9.Habata Y. Fujii R. Hosoya M. Fukusumi S. Kawamata Y. Hinuma S. Kitada C. Nishizawa N. Murosaki S. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Tatemoto K. Fujino M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1452: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), APJ was thought to couple to the inhibitory G protein, Gi. We thus first tested the effects of PTX treatment. As shown in Fig.4, both [<Glu65]apelin-13 and apelin-36 actions were obviously suppressed by the PTX treatment, suggesting that the signal transduction pathways stimulated by both peptides were transduced via Gi. On the other hand, when we treated the CHO-A10 cells with MIA, the specific inhibitor for Na+/H+ exchanger (13.Neve K.A. Rosser M.P. Barber D.L. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 225-241Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar), the acidification rates promoted by both peptides were also evidently suppressed (Fig.5), suggesting that they induced the promotion of the extracellular acidification through the Na+/H+ exchanger. These results using the two inhibitors indicate that the promotion of acidification induced by both peptides is caused through essentially the same signal transduction pathways, although the profiles of acidification induced by the two peptides were considerably different.Figure 5Effects of MIA treatment on extracellular acidification rates. The running media were replaced by medium with (●) or without (○) 10 μm MIA, and the cells were incubated until stable acidification rates were obtained. Then, the cells were stimulated with 100 nm[<Glu65]apelin-13 (A) or apelin-36 (B) for 7 min 2 s, corresponding to cycles 4–7 as indicated by a boldface bar. The basal acidification rates in the first three cycles were normalized to 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We radioiodinated an analogue of [<Glu65]apelin-13 (i.e.[<Glu65,Nle75,Tyr77]apelin-13) to use for receptor binding experiments. We used this analogue for the following reasons. As there was no tyrosine residue for radioiodination using lactoperoxidase in the sequence of [<Glu65]apelin-13, we substituted Phe77 with Tyr77. [<Glu65,Tyr77]apelin-13 was equivalently potent to the [<Glu65]apelin-13 in the microphysiometric assay (data not shown). In addition, [<Glu65,Nle75,Tyr77]apelin-13 was designed to prevent possible oxidization at Met75during the labeling reactions, as the activity of [<Glu65]apelin-13 was significantly decreased by oxidation (data not shown). The substitution of Met75 to norleucine (Nle75) did not reduce the agonistic activity. By the microphysiometric assay, we confirmed that the agonistic activity of [<Glu65,Nle75, Tyr77]apelin-13 remained after the iodination (data not shown). [125I][<Glu65,Nle75,Tyr77]apelin-13 specifically bound to intact CHO-A10 cells and their membrane preparations. Scatchard plot analyses for the binding of [125I][<Glu65,Nle75,Tyr77]apelin-13 to the membranes of CHO-A10 cells represented a single class of high affinity binding sites with a K d of 22.3 ± 2.7 pm and a B max of 3.01 ± 0.07 pmol/mg of protein (Fig. 6). In the competitive binding experiments, [<Glu65]apelin-13 and human apelin-36 effectively inhibited the binding of [125I][<Glu65,Nle75,Tyr77]apelin-13 to the CHO-A10 cell membranes, and their IC50 values were 1.4 ± 0.1 and 4.8 ± 0.24 nm, respectively (Fig. 7).Figure 7Competitive inhibition of radiolabeled apelin binding to APJ by [<Glu65]apelin-13 and apelin-36.[125I][<Glu65,Nle75,Tyr77]apelin-13 (100 pm) binding to the membrane preparations of CHO-A10 cells (0.25 μg/100 μl) was examined in the presence of [<Glu65]apelin-13 (○) and apelin-36 (●) at the indicated concentrations. The bound and free ligands were separated after incubation for 90 min at room temperature. The amounts of nonspecific binding were estimated by adding 1 μmunlabeled [<Glu65,Nle75,Tyr77]apelin-13 to the reaction buffer. Each symbol represents the mean of triplicate determinations.

At first, we examined the time course of the association of [125I][<Glu65,Nle75,Tyr77]apelin-13 on intact CHO-A10 cells and found that the labeled ligand rapidly bound to the cells within 30 min (Fig.8 A). We therefore exposed CHO-A10 cells to the excess amount of each peptide at a concentration of 1 mm for 90 min, washed out unbound peptides, and then determined the amount of [125I][<Glu65,Nle75,Tyr77]apelin-13 binding to the CHO-A10 cells. The radiolabeled ligand effectively bound to the cells even after pretreatment with a high concentration of [<Glu65]apelin-13 (Fig. 8 B). The time-course kinetics of [125I][<Glu65,Nle75,Tyr77]apelin-13 binding to the cells pretreated with [<Glu65]apelin-13 was close to that of untreated cells. In contrast, the binding of the radiolabeled ligand to CHO-A10 cells treated with apelin-36 was very low, suggesting that apelin-36 bound to APJ cannot be easily replaced with [125I][<Glu65,Nle75,Tyr77]apelin-13. As a functional characterization of APJ, we examined the chemotactic action of apelin. As shown in Fig.9, [<Glu65]apelin-13 showed a potent chemotaxis-inducing activity to CHO-A10 cells. Apelin-36 also induced the chemotactic movement of the cells; however, its potency was weaker than [<Glu65]apelin-13. The dose-response curves for [<Glu65]aplein-13 and apelin-36 were typically bell-shaped. The two peptides did not show the chemotactic activity to mock-transfected CHO cells. With checkerboard analysis, the addition of apelin in the upper chamber did not induce migration and inhibited the migration toward the ligand in the lower chamber (data not shown), indicating that the migration in response to apelin was chemotactic but not chemokinetic. A peptide-enriched fraction was prepared from bovine colostrum by a combination of C18 reversed phase and CM-Sepharose ion exchange column chromatographies. In order to analyze the molecular forms of endogenous apelin, we subjected this fraction to gel filtration, and biologically active apelin contained in each fraction was detected by the cAMP production-inhibitory assay utilizing CHO-A10 cells. As shown in Fig.10, two peaks of the activities were detected at positions corresponding to those of synthetic apelin-36 and [<Glu65]apelin-13 eluted. However, these fractions did not show such activities on mock-transfected CHO calls (data not shown). These results indicate that both the long and short forms of apelin, corresponding to apelin-36 and [<Glu65]apelin-13, respectively, are produced at least in bovine colostrum, although the long forms of apelin appeared to be dominant. By isolating a rat APJ cDNA, we found that the primary structure of APJ is highly conserved between human and rat. The amino acid sequences of mature apelin peptides (e.g. apelin-36) are also highly conserved among human, bovine, rat, and mouse (2.Tatemoto K. Hosoya M. Habata Y. Fujii R. Kakegawa T. Zou M.-X. Kawamata Y. Fukusumi S. Hinuma S. Kitada C. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Fujino M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar, 9.Habata Y. Fujii R. Hosoya M.

Acta. 1999; 1452: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), suggesting that the structures of APJ and apelin are highly conserved in evolution. In quantitative RT-PCR analyses, the highest level of APJ mRNA expression was detected in the lung in rat tissues. In our recent study, a very high level of apelin mRNA has been also detected in the lung (9.Habata Y. Fujii R. Hosoya M. Fukusumi S. Kawamata Y. Hinuma S. Kitada C. Nishizawa N. Murosaki S. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Tatemoto K. Fujino M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1452: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Taken together, it is suggested that APJ and its ligand play a crucial role in the pulmonary system in rats. However, in human tissues, APJ mRNA is very highly expressed in the spleen, but its expression level is low in the lung (14.Edinger A.L. Hoffman T.L. Sharron M. Lee B. Yi Y. Choe W. Kolson D.L. Mitrovic B. Zhou Y. Faulds D. Collman R.D. Hesselgesser J. Horuk R. Doms R.W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7934-7940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results might reflect the functional differences of APJ between the two species. The expression of APJ mRNA in infant rats was higher than that in adults. Because the expression level of rat apelin mRNA was also high in infants, 2M. Hosoya, Y. Kawamata, S. Fukusumi, R. Fujii, Y. Habata, S. Hinuma, C. Kitada, S. Honda, T. Kurokawa, H. Onda, O. Nishimura, and M. Fujino, unpublished data. APJ and apelin were expected to have a regulatory function in the process of development. Bovine, human, rat, and mouse apelin cDNAs encode preproproteins with the same length of 77 amino acids (2.Tatemoto K. Hosoya M. Habata Y. Fujii R. Kakegawa T. Zou M.-X. Kawamata Y. Fukusumi S. Hinuma S. Kitada C. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Fujino M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar, 9.Habata Y. Fujii R. Hosoya M. Fukusumi S. Kawamata Y.

Based on the analyses for the endogenous apelin purified from the bovine stomach, a mature peptide (apelin-36) has been found to consist of 36 amino acid residues, starting from Leu42 and running to the C terminus of Phe77. Because there are many basic amino acid residues in apelin-36 (i.e. lysine 72 and arginine 46, 49, 59, 60, 63, 64, 66, and 68) as potential proteolytic cleavage sites, we presumed that shorter forms of apelin might exist. Indeed, synthetic apelin-13, [<Glu65]apelin-13, and apelin-17 showed stronger extracellular acidifying activities than apelin-36 to CHO-A10 cells in dose-response analyses. We synthesized [<Glu65]apelin-13 as a pyroglutamylated form of apelin-13, and the two peptides were equipotent in the acidification rate promoting activity (2.Tatemoto K. Hosoya M. Habata Y. Fujii R. Kakegawa T. Zou M.-X. Kawamata Y. Fukusumi S. Hinuma S. Kitada C. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Fujino M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). Because [<Glu65]apelin-13 is structurally more stable than apelin-13, we have mainly used [<Glu65]apelin-13 as a representative short form of apelin. In this study, we attempted to reveal functional differences in heterogeneous apelin molecules, and we found that the induction of the extracellular acidification in CHO-A10 cells was quite different between [<Glu65]apelin-13 and apelin-36. Somatostatin exists in multiple forms (i.e. somatostatin-14, somatostatin-25, and somatostatin-28) (15.Bohlen P. Brazeau P. Benoit R. Ling N. Esch F. Guillemin R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 725-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We compared somatostatin-14 and somatostatin-28 in the microphysiometric assay with CHO cells somatostatin type 2 receptor, but we could not detect any obvious differences between the two forms in the induction of extracellular acidification (data not shown). We have reported that apelin is abundantly produced in milk and colostrum and that its molecular form is fairly heterogeneous (9.Habata Y. Fujii R. Hosoya M. Fukusumi S. Kawamata Y. Hinuma S. Kitada C. Nishizawa N. Murosaki S. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Tatemoto K. Fujino M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1452: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). We thus speculate that apelin would act on neonates through the oral intake of the colostrum and milk. By purification, we have confirmed that at least three different apelin isoforms, starting at the N-terminal amino acid residues Leu42, Gly47, and Ser50 (which would correspond to apelin-36, -31, and -28), exist in bovine milk (9.Habata Y. Fujii R. Hosoya M. Fukusumi S. Kawamata Y. Hinuma S. Kitada C. Nishizawa N. Murosaki S. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Tatemoto K. Fujino M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1452: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed whether short forms of apelin corresponding to [<Glu65]apelin-13 were actually produced in vivo. Because apelin is known to be the most abundant in colostrum, we analyzed the molecular heterogeneity of endogenous apelin in bovine colostrum by gel filtration and found that both long and short forms of apelin, corresponding to apelin-36 and [<Glu65]apelin-13, respectively, were produced in bovine colostrum. In addition, we have observed that apelin-13 was actually produced when apelin cDNA was expressed in CHO cells (9.Habata Y. Fujii R. Hosoya M. Fukusumi S. Kawamata Y. Hinuma S. Kitada C. Nishizawa N. Murosaki S. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Tatemoto K. Fujino M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1452: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). We therefore consider that the short forms as well as long forms of apelin are produced and function under some physiological conditions. In our receptor binding assays, [125I][<Glu65,Nle75,Tyr77]apelin-13 specifically bound to CHO-A10 cells with a high affinity, and [<Glu65]apelin-13 was more efficient than apelin-36 in the competitive analyses. In the dose-response relationships in the microphysiometric assay, [<Glu65]apelin-13 was proven to be much more potent than apelin-36 (2.Tatemoto K. Hosoya M. Habata Y. Fujii R. Kakegawa T. Zou M.-X. Kawamata Y. Fukusumi S. Hinuma S. Kitada C. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Fujino M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 471-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). These results unequivocally demonstrated that [<Glu65]apelin-13 could more efficiently associate with APJ than apelin-36. On the other hand, the pretreatment of CHO-A10 cells with [<Glu65]apelin-13 did not efficiently suppress the binding of [125I][<Glu65,Nle75,Tyr77]apelin-13. [<Glu65]apelin-13 was thus supposed to rapidly dissociate from APJ so that the labeled ligand could replace with [<Glu65]apelin-13 bound to APJ. In contrast, the labeled ligand scarcely bound to CHO-A10 cells pretreated with apelin-36, suggesting that apelin-36 bound hardly dissociates from APJ. In our preliminary experiments, the binding of the labeled apelin to CHO-A10 cells pretreated with apelin-36 was significantly recovered after treating the cells with acid (data not shown), suggesting that the decrease of the labeled apelin binding caused by the treatment with apelin-36 is due neither to desensitization nor to internalization in APJ. Although a precise comparison of association rate constants by utilizing the corresponding radioligands of [<Glu65]apelin-13 and apelin-36 will be necessary, we believe that the prolonged acidification caused by aplein-36 in the microphysiometric assays reflects characteristics in its dissociation from APJ. Alternatively, our results indicate that the N-terminal portion of apelin-36 modulates the dissociation from the receptor. In this study, we demonstrated that apelin peptides showed chemotactic activities to CHO-A10 cells. In the chemotactic assay, [<Glu65]apelin-13 was more potent than apelin-36. As we have demonstrated previously, [<Glu65]apelin-13 also shows higher activity than apelin-36 in the cAMP production-inhibitory assay using CHO-A10 cells (9.Habata Y. Fujii R. Hosoya M. Fukusumi S. Kawamata Y. Hinuma S. Kitada C. Nishizawa N. Murosaki S. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Tatemoto K. Fujino M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1452: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). It should be noticed that in the both assays CHO-A10 cells are exposed consistently to test samples during assays. In such cases, the potency of an apelin peptide would be determined by its association rate rather than dissociation rate against APJ. Alternatively, in cases such as the in vivosituation, if APJ is transiently exposed to an apelin peptide, apelin-36 might show greater activity than [<Glu65]apelin-13. In any case, further studies are necessary to confirm whether apelin physiologically acts as one of chemotactic factors. In this study, we demonstrated that the N-terminal portion of apelin-36 is very important to modulate the interaction with APJ, although the core structure of apelin to bind the receptor is situated in the C-terminal portion. Because both the long and short forms of apelin are produced in vivo under some conditions, they might play different physiological roles, respectively, in vivo as well as in vitro. We thank Drs. Yasuhiro Sumino, Yoshihiro Ishibashi, and Takuya Watanabe and Yoshio Matsumoto for their helpful advice and collaboration."
https://openalex.org/W2039629780,"Epac1 (cAMP-GEFI) and Epac2 (cAMP-GEFII) are closely related guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for the small GTPase Rap1, which are directly regulated by cAMP. Here we show that both GEFs efficiently activate Rap2 as well. A third member of the family, Repac (GFR), which lacks the cAMP dependent regulatory sequences, is a constitutive activator of both Rap1 and Rap2. In contrast to Epac1, Epac2 contains a second cAMP binding domain at the N terminus, as does the Epac homologue from Caenorhabditis elegans. Affinity measurements show that this distal cAMP binding domain (the A-site) binds cAMP with much lower affinity than the cAMP binding domain proximal to the catalytic domain (the B-site), which is present in both Epac1 and Epac2. Deletion mutant analysis shows that the high affinity cAMP binding domains are sufficient to regulate the GEFs in vitro. Interestingly, isolated fragments containing the B-sites of either Epac1 or Epac2, but not the A-site from Epac2, inhibit the catalytic domains in trans. This inhibition is relieved by the addition of cAMP. In addition to the cAMP binding domains, both Epac1 and Epac2 have a DEP domain. Deletion of this domain does not affect regulation of Epac1 activity but affects membrane localization. From these results, we conclude that all three members of the Epac family regulate both Rap1 and Rap2. Furthermore, we conclude that the catalytic activity of Epac1 is constrained by a direct interaction between GEF and high affinity cAMP binding domains in the absence of cAMP. Epac1 becomes activated by a release of this inhibition when cAMP is bound."
https://openalex.org/W2030992731,"A role of the copper protein ceruloplasmin (Cp) in iron metabolism is suggested by its ferroxidase activity and by the tissue iron overload in hereditary Cp deficiency patients. In addition, plasma Cp increases markedly in several conditions of anemia, e.g. iron deficiency, hemorrhage, renal failure, sickle cell disease, pregnancy, and inflammation. However, little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanism(s) involved. We have reported that iron chelators increase Cp mRNA expression and protein synthesis in human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells. Furthermore, we have shown that the increase in Cp mRNA is due to increased rate of transcription. We here report the results of new studies designed to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying transcriptional activation of Cp by iron deficiency. The 5'-flanking region of the Cp gene was cloned from a human genomic library. A 4774-base pair segment of the Cp promoter/enhancer driving a luciferase reporter was transfected into HepG2 or Hep3B cells. Iron deficiency or hypoxia increased luciferase activity by 5-10-fold compared with untreated cells. Examination of the sequence showed three pairs of consensus hypoxia-responsive elements (HREs). Deletion and mutation analysis showed that a single HRE was necessary and sufficient for gene activation. The involvement of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) was shown by gel-shift and supershift experiments that showed HIF-1alpha and HIF-1beta binding to a radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing the Cp promoter HRE. Furthermore, iron deficiency (and hypoxia) did not activate Cp gene expression in Hepa c4 hepatoma cells deficient in HIF-1beta, as shown functionally by the inactivity of a transfected Cp promoter-luciferase construct and by the failure of HIF-1 to bind the Cp HRE in nuclear extracts from these cells. These results are consistent with in vivo findings that iron deficiency increases plasma Cp and provides a molecular mechanism that may help to understand these observations."

Here we describe a distantly related member of the TGF-β superfamily, designated placental TGF-β (PTGF-β), that is up-regulated in response to both p53-dependent and -independent apoptotic signaling events arising from DNA damage in human breast cancer cells. PTGF-β is normally expressed in placenta and at lower levels in kidney, lung, pancreas, and muscle but could not be detected in any tumor cell line studied. The PTGF-β promoter is activated by p53 and contains two p53 binding site motifs. Functional studies demonstrated that one of these p53 binding sites is essential for p53-mediated PTGF-β promoter induction and specifically binds recombinant p53 in gel mobility shift assays. PTGF-β overexpression from a recombinant adenoviral vector (AdPTGF-β) led to an 80% reduction in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell viability and a 50–60% reduction in other human breast cancer cell lines studied, including MCF-7 cells, which are resistant to growth inhibition by recombinant wild-type p53. Like p53, PTGF-β overexpression was seen to induce both G1cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in breast tumor cells. These results provide the first evidence for a direct functional link between p53 and the TGF-β superfamily and implicate PTGF-β as an important intercellular mediator of p53 function and the cytostatic effects of radiation and chemotherapeutic cancer agents.

Cell. 1992; 70: 523-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1902) Google Scholar), and the association between loss of p53 function and radiation resistance (26.Lowe S.W. Bodis S. McClatchey A. Remington L. Ruley H.E. Fisher D.E. Housman D.E. Jacks T. Science. 1994; 266: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar) together provide strong evidence for an important role for p53 in the response of tumor cells to radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs. However, evidence has also been presented for the existence of p53-independent growth arrest and apoptotic pathways that are responsive to DNA damage in cells deficient for wild-type p53 function. For example, loss of p53 function does not always correlate with increased resistance of tumor cells to ionizing radiation (27.Brown J.M. Wouters B.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1391-1399PubMed Google Scholar), and studies in our laboratory have shown that the response of human breast cancer cell lines to DNA damage arising from incorporation of the purine analog gancyclovir (9-[(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxy)methyl]guanine) triphosphate can be highly variable and does not correlate with endogenous p53 gene status (28.Li P.X. Ngo D. Brade A.M. Klamut H.J. Cancer Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This issue is further complicated by evidence for cooperation between p53-dependent and p53-independent apoptotic pathways, leading to accelerated cell death when both pathways are activated simultaneously (29.Peled A. Zipori D. Rotter V. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2148-2156PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence for cross-talk between p53-dependent and p53-independent apoptotic pathways suggests that they intersect with each other and that these points of convergence represent important regulatory intermediates in these pathways. To test this hypothesis, recent efforts in our laboratory have focused on the identification of genes positioned at points of convergence of p53-dependent and p53-independent growth arrest and apoptotic signaling pathways that are responsive to DNA damage. One of the genes identified encodes a 1.2-kb1 mRNA that is strongly up-regulated by wild-type p53 and to a lesser extent by radiation treatment. Sequence analysis indicated that this gene corresponds to placental transforming growth factor-β (PTGF-β) (30.Lawton L.N. Bonaldo M.F. Jelenc P.C. Qiu L. Baumes S.A. Marcelino R.A. de Jesus G.M.

Conditions for growth of MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 human breast cancer cell lines have been described previously (34.Li P. Bui T. Gray D. Klamut H.J. Breast Cancer Res.

HS574.Mg normal human mammary cells and the T47D and SK-BR-3 human breast cancer cell lines were obtained from the ATCC and cultured under conditions recommended by the supplier. Procedures used to treat cells with radiation or recombinant adenoviral vectors and the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (Sigma) used to monitor cell growth at various times post-treatment have been described previously (34.Li P.

For flow cytometry, cells were infected with AdPTGF-β or Adβgal at 100 pfu/cell, harvested 4 days post-treatment, stained with propidium iodide, and analyzed using an EPICS flow cytometer (Coulter) as described previously (34.Li P.

Procedures used to identify characteristic morphological (acridine orange and ethidium bromide staining) and biochemical (DNA laddering) features of apoptosis have been described elsewhere (34.Li P. Bui T. Gray D. Klamut H.J. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1998; 48: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of β-catenin cleavage products was carried out essentially as described previously (35.Brancolini C. Lazarevic D. Rodriguez J. Schneider C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 759-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). RNA Image kits (GenHunter, Brookline, MA) were used for mRNA differential display analysis of total RNA isolated from control and treated cells using the RNeasy total RNA kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) essentially as described elsewhere (36.Outinen P.A. Sood S.K. Liaw P.C. Sarge K.D. Maeda N. Hirsh J. Ribau J. Podor T.J. Weitz J.I. Austin R.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In these experiments, duplicate total RNA samples isolated from untreated, Adp53 (100 pfu/cell)-, and radiation (10 Gy)-treated MDA-MB-468 cells were analyzed using 24 primer combinations (three downstream H-T11(G,A,C) and eight upstream random primers (H-AP1–8) supplied with the RNA Image kit. Northern blots of total RNA isolated from control and treated cells using the RNeasy total RNA kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) were prepared essentially as described previously (28.Li P.X. Ngo D. Brade A.M. Klamut H.J. Cancer Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Candidate cDNA fragments that were up-regulated in response to both Adp53 and radiation treatment on duplicate mRNA differential display gels were excised from the dried gel, eluted, reamplified by PCR, gel-purified, radiolabeled, and hybridized to Northern blots as described elsewhere (36.Outinen P.A. Sood S.K. Liaw P.C. Sarge K.D. Maeda N. Hirsh J. Ribau J. Podor T.J. Weitz J.I. Austin R.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Tissue-specific expression was examined using a commercially available Northern blot prepared from poly(A)+ mRNA (2 μg/lane) isolated from adult tissues (CLONTECH). cDNA fragments differentially expressed on Northern blots were subcloned into the TA vector system (In Vitrogen) and sequenced using vector-specific primers and a LI-COR model 400 automated sequencer (ACGT Corp., Toronto, Canada). A 997-bp fragment containing 31 bp within the 5′-untranslated region in exon 1 and 966 bp upstream of the predicted transcription start site of the PTGF-β gene in MDA-MB-468 cells was cloned upstream of the luciferase gene in the pGL3Basic vector (Promega) and transiently transfected into MDA-MB-468 cells using a calcium phosphate precipitation protocol (37.Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A CMV-βgal reporter plasmid was included in all experiments as a control for transfection efficiency. Luciferase and β-galactosidase reporter gene assays were performed on cell extracts prepared 24 h post-treatment with Adp53 (48 h post-transfection) using the Dual-Light Chemiluminescent Reporter Gene Assay System (Tropix, Inc.) and a Lumat LB9507 luminometer (EG & G Berthold). Cell extract protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). PTGF-β promoter activities were normalized for total protein concentrations as well as transfection efficiencies based on control CMV-βgal promoter activities. The 3TP-lux promoter-luciferase construct (kindly provided by J. Wrana) containing three consecutive 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response elements and a portion of the plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 promoter region has been shown to be induced by various members of the TGF-β superfamily (38.Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). The 3TP-lux plasmid was transfected into (Smad4-null) MDA-MB-468 cells in the presence or absence of pCMV5BMADR4, a eukaryotic expression vector encoding the Smad4 gene under the control of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (also kindly provided by J. Wrana). After 24 h, cells were washed extensively in PBS and treated with either AdPTGF-β (50 pfu/cell), Adβgal (50 pfu/cell; negative control), or recombinant TGF-β1 (Sigma; 10 ng/ml; positive control) in serum-free medium. After an additional 24 h of incubation, cells were harvested, and luciferase activities were determined using the Luciferase Assay system (Promega). A histidine-tagged, truncated (aa 82–360) p53 protein was expressed from the pET-15b plasmid (Novagen) in Escherichia coli (strain BL21 (DE3)) and purified using a one-step Ni2+ affinity column yielding a preparation of p53 that was 70–80% pure as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Complementary, single-stranded oligomers corresponding to the p53 consensus binding site (TTTGGACATGCCCGGGCATGTCCTTT) (39.el-Deiry W.S. Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar) or p53 binding site 1 (CACAGCCATGCCCGGGCAAGAACTCA) within the PTGF-β gene promoter were combined at 50 pmol each and end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP. EMSA binding assays (40.Wolkowicz R. Peled A. Elkind N.B. Rotter V. Cancer Detect. Prev. 1998; 22: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) contained annealed oligonucleotide probes and either purified, recombinant p53 or nuclear extracts (40.Wolkowicz R. Peled A. Elkind N.B. Rotter V. Cancer Detect. Prev. 1998; 22: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) prepared from MDA-MB-468 cells either untreated or treated 24 h postinfection with a recombinant adenovirus expressing full-length, wild-type p53 protein (Adp53) at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 100 pfu/cell. EMSA competition assays were performed over a range of 30–300-fold molar excess of the unlabeled, double-stranded competitor oligonucleotide. Binding reactions were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C and then for 15 min at 25 °C and analyzed by electrophoresis on 5% polyacrylamide gels in 1× TBE buffer at 20 mA for 1 h (41.Lee W. Harvey T.S. Yin Y. Yau P. Litchfield D. Arrowsmith C.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 877-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film for 24 h. A PTGF-β minigene consisting of the 1.2-kb PTGF-β cDNA cloned from MDA-MB-468 cells and CMV promoter and bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequences cassette derived from the pRc/CMV vector (Invitrogen) was cloned into the pΔE1Sp1B adenoviral shuttle vector (42.Bett A.J. Haddara W. Prevec L. Graham F.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8802-8806Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) to generate pΔE1Sp1B-CMVPTGF-β. A recombinant adenoviral (Ad) vector expressing the PTGF-β minigene was generated by co-transfection of pΔE1Sp1B-CMVPTGF-β and pJM17 into 293 cells essentially as described elsewhere (42.Bett A.J. Haddara W. Prevec L. Graham F.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8802-8806Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Recombinant adenoviral plaques were clonally expanded and tested for integration of the PTGF-β minigene by PCR using gene-specific primers, as well as by restriction fragment analysis of recombinant adenoviral DNA. Sequence analysis verified the integrity of the PTGF-β minigene. A recombinant adenoviral vector expressing β-galactosidase from a CMV promoter (Adβgal) was kindly provided by Dr. F. Graham (McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada). Procedures used in the growth and maintenance of recombinant adenoviral stocks have been described elsewhere (34.Li P. Bui T. Gray D. Klamut H.J. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1998; 48: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The molecular events associated with the early stages of p53-dependent and p53-independent apoptotic signaling have not been well defined, but they appear to involve distinct pathways that can intersect and cooperate with each other (29.Peled A. Zipori D. Rotter V. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2148-2156PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Steinman R.A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 199-210PubMed Google Scholar). This led us to postulate that key regulators of these apoptotic pathways might be coordinately regulated in response to death-promoting agents that specifically activate these signaling pathways. To explore this possibility, the mRNA differential display technique (45.Liang P. Bauer D. Averboukh L. Warthoe P. Rohrwild M. Muller H. Strauss M. Pardee A.B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 304-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) was used to examine changes in gene expression in human MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells associated with either wild-type p53 overexpression or radiation treatment. MDA-MB-468 cells express high levels of mutant p53 (273Arg-His) (46.Nigro J.M. Baker S.J. Preisinger A.C. Jessup J.M. Hostetter R. Cleary K. Bigner S.H. Davidson N. Baylin S. Devilee P. Glover T. Collins F.S. Weston A. Modali R. Harris C.C. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1989; 342: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (2573) Google Scholar) and undergo rapid and complete p53-dependent growth arrest and apoptosis following transduction with an adenoviral vector expressing wild-type p53 (Adp53; 100 pfu/cell) or p53-independent growth arrest and apoptosis following treatment with ionizing radiation (10 Gy) in the absence of functional p53 (Fig. 1 a). Differential display analysis led to the identification of several candidate genes that are similarly up- or down-regulated in response to each of these apoptotic stimuli (Fig. 1 b). One of these genes was shown by Northern blot analysis to correspond to a 1.2-kb mRNA that is strongly up-regulated in response to wild-type p53 overexpression and to a lesser extent by radiation treatment (Fig. 1 c). Further analysis demonstrated that this gene is also induced by cisplatin and doxorubicin but not by serum withdrawal or treatment with retinoic acid (Fig. 1 c). These results suggested that this gene is uniquely positioned at a convergence point of p53-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways that are specifically responsive to DNA-damaging agents (47.Milner J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 879-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of a 250-bp cDNA fragment isolated from the differential display gel indicated that this gene is highly homologous to six independent entries in the GenBankTM data base corresponding to novel members of the TGF-β superfamily: Homo sapiens mRNA for TGF-β superfamily protein (GenBankTM accession no. AB000584) (48.Yokoyama-Kobayashi M. Saeki M. Sekine S. Kato S. J. Biochem.

Gene (Amst.). 1997; 203: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Based on the high sequence homology between the gene identified in our study and each of these recently described TGF-β superfamily members, we concluded that all of these cDNAs probably correspond to a single gene. This gene encodes a 296-amino acid protein containing an amino-terminal hydrophobic domain corresponding to a putative signal sequence, a potential protease cleavage site between aa 177 and 183 consisting of two overlapping dibasic amino acid motifs (RXXRXXR), and a 113-aa carboxyl-terminal domain containing seven positionally conserved cysteine residues that are nearly invariant within the mature regions of all members of the TGF-β superfamily (32.Massague J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar). Cloning and sequence analysis of reverse transcriptase-PCR products generated by primers corresponding to the full-length 1.2-kb H. sapiens mRNA for TGF-β superfamily protein (GenBankTM accession no.AB000584) confirmed that this gene is induced in MDA-MB-468 cells in response to both Adp53 and radiation treatment (Fig.2 a). Northern blot analysis indicated that this gene is expressed at high levels in placenta, at moderate levels in adult kidney, lung, pancreas, heart, and skeletal muscle, and at low levels in adult brain and liver (Fig.2 b). This tissue-specific profile of expression is almost identical to that reported for the prepro-placental TGF-β gene (30.Lawton L.N. Bonaldo M.F. Jelenc P.C. Qiu L. Baumes S.A. Marcelino R.A. de Jesus G.M. Wellington S. Knowles J.A. Warburton D. Brown S. Soares M.B. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 203: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), providing further evidence that these cDNAs probably represent the same gene. The existence of larger, cross-hybridizing bands in several of these tissues suggests that this gene is alternatively spliced or that closely related genes are co-expressed in these tissues. Interestingly, no expression was seen in transformed counterparts of some of these normal tissues (e.g. H661 lung cancer cells) or in any human breast cancer cell line examined (Fig. 2 c). This may suggest that expression of this novel TGF-β superfamily member is not compatible with malignant transformation and/or tumor progression. On the basis of its high levels of expression in placental tissue and its nearly complete homology to the prepro-placental TGF-β gene, we subsequently refer to this gene as placental TGF-β (PTGF-β). To begin to examine the transcriptional mechanisms that govern the PTGF-β gene response to p53-dependent and p53-independent DNA damage signaling events, a 997-bp genomic fragment corresponding to the promoter region and exon 1 of the PTGF-β gene (30.Lawton L.N. Bonaldo M.F. Jelenc P.C. Qiu L. Baumes S.A. Marcelino R.A. de Jesus G.M. Wellington S. Knowles J.A. Warburton D. Brown S. Soares M.B. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 203: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) in MDA-MB-468 cells was PCR-amplified, cloned, and sequenced (Fig.3 a). Only minor sequence variations were observed relative to the previously published PTGF-β promoter sequence (30.Lawton L.N. Bonaldo M.F. Jelenc P.C. Qiu L. Baumes S.A. Marcelino R.A. de Jesus G.M.

Gene (Amst.). 1997; 203: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and analysis of this sequence against the TFMATRIX transcription factor binding site profile data base identified several candidate regulatory motifs, many of which have been implicated in regulating gene expression during development (51.Weinstein D.C.

However, molecular basis of glycerol release from adipocytes has not yet been elucidated. We recently cloned a novel member of the aquaporin family, aquaporin adipose (AQPap), which has glycerol permeability. The current study was designed to examine the hypothesis that AQPap serves as a glycerol channel in adipocytes. Adipose tissue expressed AQPap mRNA in high abundance, but not the mRNAs for the other aquaglyceroporins, AQP3 and AQP9, indicating that AQPap is the only known aquaglyceroporin expressed in adipose tissue. Glycerol release from 3T3-L1 cells was increased during differentiation in parallel with AQPap mRNA levels and suppressed by mercury ion, which inhibits the function of AQPs, supporting AQPap functions as a glycerol channel in adipocytes. Fasting increased and refeeding suppressed adipose AQPap mRNA levels in accordance with plasma glycerol levels and oppositely to plasma insulin levels in mice. Insulin dose-dependently suppressed AQPap mRNA expression in 3T3-L1 cells. AQPap mRNA levels and adipose glycerol concentrations measured by the microdialysis technique were increased in obese mice with insulin resistance. Accordingly, negative regulation of AQPap expression by insulin was impaired in the insulin-resistant state.

These AQPs regulate water movement and are involved in the correction of the osmotic pressure gradient. The fact that mutations in the AQP2 gene cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in humans has emphasized the importance of the molecule on regulating water balance (14.Deen P.M. Verdijk M.A. Knoers N.V. Wieringa B. Monnens L.A. van Os C.H. van Oost B.A. Science. 1994; 264: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Previously, we isolated a novel cDNA belonging to the AQP family from the human adipose tissue cDNA library and revealed that its mRNA was expressed abundantly in human adipose tissue (15.Kuriyama H. Kawamoto S. Ishida N. Ohno I. Mita S. Matsuzawa Y. Matsubara K. Okubo K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Therefore, we named it aquaporin adipose (AQPap). Functional studies have distinguished the members of AQP family into two subgroups: aquaporins which are selective water channels, and aquaglyceroporins which transport glycerol as well as water (16.Froger A. Tallur B. Thomas D. Delamarche C. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1458-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In our previous study (15.Kuriyama H. Kawamoto S. Ishida N. Ohno I. Mita S. Matsuzawa Y. Matsubara K. Okubo K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), injection of AQPap cRNA intoXenopus oocytes exhibited permeability to glycerol as well as water, indicating that AQPap belongs to the aquaglyceroporin group. Glycerol is one of the essential nutrients in the mammalian body. In fasting, triglyceride in adipocytes is hydrolyzed to glycerol and free fatty acid (FFA) by hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and both are released into the bloodstream. Organs expressing glycerokinase, such as the liver and kidney, take up glycerol and use it for gluconeogenesis to maintain plasma glucose levels (17.Klein S. Holland O.B. Wolfe R.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: E32-E39PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Baba H. Zhang X.J. Wolfe R.R. Nutrition. 1995; 11: 149-153PubMed Google Scholar). It had been believed that transport of liberated fatty acids from adipocytes was achieved by simple diffusion (19.Motojima K. Passilly P. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Latruffe N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16710-16714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have identified several membrane proteins that transport FFA in adipocytes. These include fatty acid transport protein (FATP) (19.Motojima K. Passilly P. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Latruffe N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16710-16714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 20.Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), and fatty acid translocase (19.Motojima K. Passilly P. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Latruffe N. J. Biol.

A specific molecule(s) is thought to participate in facilitating glycerol transport from the cell similar to FFA transport. AQPap mRNA is expressed predominantly in adipose tissue in humans. In the current study, we examined the regulation of AQPap in both animals and tissue culture. The results strongly suggest that AQPap is the physiological glycerol channel specific to adipocytes. Eight-week-old male C57BL/6J, C57BL/KsJ (db+/+m), and C57BL/KsJ (db+/db+) mice were purchased from Clea Japan, Inc. The animals were kept at a constant room temperature with a 12 h dark-light cycle (8 a.m.-8 p.m.). They were acclimated to the new environment for 1 week before the experiment. A mouse 3T3-L1 cell line was purchased from Health Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan, cell number JCRB9014). Cells were maintained and differentiated with 5 μg/ml insulin, 0.5 mm 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthin, 1 μmdexamethazone according to the modified method of Rubin et al. (23.Rubin C.S. Hirsch A. Fung C. Rosen O.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7570-7578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse AQPap, AQP3, AQP9, HSL, and perilipin (derived from sequences common to both perilipin A and B) cDNAs were synthesized by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using mouse fat tissue (AQPap, HSL, and perilipin) (24.Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Moos Jr., M.C. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 12035-12039Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), kidney (AQP3) and liver (AQP9) RNAs as templates and used as probes for Northern blot analysis. The nucleotide sequence of mouse AQP3 and AQP9 has been deposited in DDBJ under accession number AB019039 and AB037180, respectively. Mouse β-actin cDNA was purchased from Stratagene Ltd. Total cellular RNA was prepared with TRIZOLTM reagent kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). Northern blot analysis and RNase protection assay were performed as described previously (25.Shimomura I. Funahashi T. Takahashi M. Maeda K. Kotani K. Nakamura T. Yamashita S. Miura M. Fukuda Y. Takemura K. Tokunaga K. Matsuzawa Y. Nat.

Tissue distribution of AQPap, AQP3, and AQP9 mRNAs was examined in 9-week-old male C57BL/6J mice. Overnight fasted mice were anesthetized by 5 mg/ml pentobarbital sodium salt and killed. Various tissues were removed and used for RNA isolation. The pooled RNA samples from each tissue were used for Northern analysis. Effect of fasting and feeding on AQPap mRNA expression in adipose tissue was examined in male C57BL/KsJ (db+/+m) mice (n = 8, each). The fed group was given free access to standard laboratory chow and the fasted group was fasted for 18 h before killing. For the experiment on the time course of fasting and refeeding, male C57BL/6J mice (each group, n = 3) were given free access to standard laboratory chow and tap water for 12 h after 24 h fasting to strictly determine the starting point of fasting. Actual fasting was started at 6 a.m. (the zero time). The fasted group was fasted for 12 (6 p.m.) or 18 (0 a.m.) hours before killing. The refed group was given free access to standard laboratory chow for 12 h after 18 h fasting. All mice were phlebotomized from the vena cava quickly. Plasma glycerol, FFA, and insulin were measured by the UV method (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, sensitivity >1 μm), Nescauto NEFA kit (Azwell, Japan), and a double-antibody sandwich enzyme immunoassay using a Glazyme Insulin EIA Kit (Sanyo Chemical Industries, Ltd., Japan) with rat insulin as a standard, respectively. Subcutaneous fat tissues were removed and used for RNA isolation. AQPap mRNA expression in adipose tissue of obese C57BL/KsJ (db+/db+) mice was compared with that of their lean littermate C57BL/KsJ (db+/+m) mice (n = 8, each). Glycerol concentration in subcutaneous fat tissues was measured by a microdialysis technique (27.Arner P. Bolinder J. Eliasson A. Lundin A. Ungerstedt U. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: E737-E742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Arner P. Bolinder J. J. Intern. Med. 1991; 230: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). C57BL/KsJ (db+/db+) and (db+/+m) mice (n = 7, each) were brought to the laboratory at 8 a.m. under ad libitum feeding and drinking condition. During the experiments, the mice were anesthetized and warmed with heating pads to maintain the body temperature at about 35–37° C. The microdialysis probes were hand-made (10 × 0.2 mm, 50,000 molecular weight cut-off). The recovery rate in the probes was calculated by in vitroexperiments prior to the study. During dialysis, the probe and catheter were connected to a microinfusion pump (CMA102, BAS) and perfused with Krebs-Ringer solution. The dialysis probe was inserted into the inguinal subcutaneous fat tissue and perfusion with Krebs-Ringer solution (2 μl/min) was started. The blood samples were drawn from the jugular vein. Fractions of dialysate were collected every 30 min. The first and second fractions were discarded because of a transient rise in the concentration of glycerol in response to the initial trauma. The in vitro recovery rate of glycerol was approximately 70%. Glycerol concentration in the perfusate was measured by a fluorometric/colorimetric enzyme method (29.Winartasaputra H. Mallet V.N. Kuan S.S. Guilbault G.G. Clin. Chem. 1980; 26: 613-617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 cells on day 9 after differentiation were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) without calcium and magnesium ions, and incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 0.5% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma) supplemented with and without 10−6m epinephrine for 1 h at 37° C (30.Chernick S.S. Spooner P.M. Garrison M.M. Scow R.O. J. Lipid. Res. 1986; 27: 286-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glycerol concentration in the media was measured by the UV method. The effect of mercury ions on glycerol release was tested as follows. 3T3-L1 cells on day 9 after differentiation were washed twice with PBS followed by incubation with PBS containing various concentration of HgCl2 for 5 min. After incubation, the cells were washed and further incubated with or without 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at room temperature. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were incubated with PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 10−6m epinephrine for 1 h at 37° C. The concentration of glycerol in the incubated buffer was measured as described above. 3T3-L1 cells on day 9 were used for the experiments on the effects of hormones on AQPap expression (30.Chernick S.S. Spooner P.M. Garrison M.M. Scow R.O. J. Lipid. Res. 1986; 27: 286-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with DMEM containing 0.5% BSA for 12 h. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were incubated in DMEM containing 0.5% BSA supplemented with or without 10−9, 10−8, 10−7, and 10−6m bovine insulin for 6 h. For the experiment on time course, cells were incubated in DMEM with 10−8m insulin for 0, 3, or 6 h. Total RNA was isolated and used for Northern blotting and RNase protection assay. Polyclonal rabbit antiserum was raised against the carboxyl terminus of mouse AQPap. We designed two synthetic peptides containing YLGLIHPSIPQDPQRLENF and NFTARDQKVTAS (with NH2-terminal cystein added in the latter synthetic amino acid peptide) because they were divergent among the AQP family. The specificity of antisera was confirmed by immunoblotting. For immunoblotting, crude membrane fractions of 3T3-L1 cells and mouse adipose tissues were prepared as follows. For 3T3-L1 cells, the cells were homogenized in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 255 mm sucrose, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin, then centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 10 min at 4° C. The supernatant was recentrifuged at 100,000 × g, yielding a pellet containing crude membranes and a supernatant containing cytosol. For adipose tissues, the membrane fractions were obtained by the method of Oka et al. (31.Oka Y. Asano T. Lin J.L. Tsukuda K. Katagiri H. Ishihara H. Inukai K. Yazaki Y. Gerontology. 1992; 38: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 32.Oka Y. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Kasuga M. Kanazawa Y. Takaku F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13432-13439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins (40 μg) from each fraction were loaded and separated on a 12.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Western blot analysis was performed using antiserum to AQPap at a dilution of 1:500. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled donkey anti-rabbit immunogloblins were used at a dilution of 1:3000. Detection by chemiluminescence was performed using ECLTM system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunocytochemical detection, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were differentiated on glass coverslips and analyzed on day 13 after differentiation. Cells were incubated with or without 10−6mepinephrine for 20 min at 37° C. After washing with PBS, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min on ice, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min on ice, washed extensively with PBS, blocked with 5% normal swine serum for 30 min, and incubated with antiserum to AQPap serum at a dilution of 1:500 in PBS containing 5% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with biotinylated swine serum to anti-rabbit immunogloblins in PBS containing 5% BSA for 30 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated avidin D for 30 min at room temperature. After extensive washing with PBS, the cells were examined by confocal microscopy and photographed. The results were expressed as mean ± S.E. The significance of the difference between the mean values of the groups was evaluated by Student's t test or analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Fisher's PLSD test. Tissue distribution of AQPap was examined in pooled RNA samples of overnight fasted mice by Northern blotting. Mouse AQPap mRNA was expressed predominantly in white and brown adipose tissues (Fig. 1). Much fainter signals were observed in kidney and skeletal (gastrocunemius) muscle. The expression pattern was similar to that in human tissues as previously reported (15.Kuriyama H. Kawamoto S. Ishida N. Ohno I. Mita S. Matsuzawa Y. Matsubara K. Okubo K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We also examined the expression of mRNAs for AQP3 and AQP9, which are other members of aquaglyceroporins shown to have the ability to transport glycerol. The results of Northern blotting showed that white and brown adipose tissues did not have any detectable amounts of AQP3 and AQP9 mRNAs (Fig. 1). Therefore, AQPap is the sole aquaglyceroporin among the known AQPs. Fasting activates lipolysis and accelerates glycerol release from adipose tissue. We investigated the effect of fasting on AQPap mRNA expression in white adipose tissues. Mice fasted for 18 h exhibited remarkably higher levels of adipose AQPap mRNA compared with the fed mice (Fig.2 a). The time course of AQPap mRNA levels during fasting and refeeding were examined. Plasma glycerol and FFA levels were elevated in the fasted mice and decreased in the refed mice. Plasma insulin levels were decreased in the fasted mice and restored in the refed mice. White adipose AQPap mRNA levels were increased by fasting and suppressed by refeeding (Fig.2 b). The changes of mRNAs for AQPap and HSL showed a similar pattern to that of plasma glycerol and FFA. Glycerol metabolism is dysregulated in obesity with insulin resistance (33.Jansson P.A. Larsson A. Smith U. Lonnroth P. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1610-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Plasma glycerol concentration is elevated in obesity and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. We compared metabolic parameters in obese db+/db+ mice and their lean littermate, db+/+m mice. Plasma glycerol concentration (512 ± 32 μm versus259 ± 37 μm, p < 0.001) and FFA concentration (1.03 ± 0.08 mm versus0.51 ± 0.04 mm, p < 0.001) were elevated in the obese mice (Fig. 3) despite hyperinsulinemia. Glycerol concentration in the interstitial fluid of adipose tissue more precisely reflects the amount of glycerol release from adipocytes than that in plasma. Accordingly, we measured the glycerol concentration in the interstitial fluid of adipose tissue by the microdialysis technique. Adipose tissue glycerol concentrations were higher in obese mice than in lean mice (82 ± 11 μm versus 49 ± 5 μm,p < 0.01) (Fig. 3). White adipose AQPap mRNA levels in obese animals were approximately 4-fold higher than those in lean animals (p < 0.001) (Fig. 3). Obese mice also showed elevated HSL mRNA levels (p < 0.05). Thus, AQPap and HSL mRNAs were overexpressed in mice with insulin resistance. Next, we examined the time course of glycerol release activity and expression of the genes relating to lipolysis during the differentiation of cultured 3T3-L1 cells. The amount of epinephrine-stimulated glycerol release per hour was measured in 3T3-L1 cells each day after differentiation. Glycerol in the medium became detectable from day 4 after differentiation, increased during differentiation, and reached a plateau level on day 13 (Fig. 4). Undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells did not express AQPap mRNA. The signal of AQPap mRNA was detectable in the cells on day 3 after differentiation, and increased in parallel with glycerol release activity. It is known that perilipin associates with the surface of intracellular neutral lipid droplets and controls lipolysis (24.Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Moos Jr., M.C. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 12035-12039Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 34.Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Garty N.B. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11341-11346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression patterns of perilipin and HSL mRNAs after differentiation were similar to that of AQPap mRNA (Fig. 4). Neither AQP3 nor AQP9 mRNA were detected in the differentiated 3T3-L1 cells (data not shown). AQPap mRNA expression was augmented in the fasted mice with low levels of plasma insulin and suppressed in the refed mice with elevated plasma insulin levels. We hypothesized that AQPap mRNA would be negatively regulated by insulin. The effect of insulin on AQPap mRNA expression was investigated in the differentiated 3T3-L1 cells. Administration of insulin dose-dependently suppressed AQPap mRNA expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes on day 9 after differentiation (Fig. 5 a). Treatment with 10−9m insulin decreased AQPap mRNA levels by 43%. The time course of AQPap mRNA suppression by insulin was also investigated. Incubation with 10−8minsulin for 3 h significantly suppressed AQPap mRNA levels and 6 h incubation resulted in 45% suppression (Fig. 5 b). Therefore, insulin is a negative regulator of AQPap expression. We also investigated the effect of lipolytic hormones on AQPap mRNA levels. Administration of epinephrine, glucagon, and ACTH, however, did not change AQPap mRNA levels in the differentiated 3T3-L1 cells (data not shown). These results were also consistent with a previously reported finding that these hormones did not affect HSL mRNA levels (35.Slavin B.G. Ong J.M. Kern P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1535-1541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the regulation and subcellular localization of AQPap at the protein level, we raised an antibody against the carboxyl terminus of AQPap. The specificity of the antibody was assessed by immunoblotting (Fig.6 a). The antibody recognized a single band at 28 kDa corresponding to the predicted molecular mass of AQPap in the crude membrane fraction (M) of differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes (lane 4), but not in the soluble cytosolic fraction (C) (lane 3) consistent with the fact that AQPap is an integral membrane protein. The band could not be observed by preimmune serum (lane 2) and was abolished by the presence of excess immunizing synthetic peptide (lane 6). The AQPap protein was detected in the differentiated 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 6 b, lane 2), but not in the undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells (lane 1). The AQPap protein levels were higher in adipose tissue of the fasted mice (lane 4) compared with those in the fed mice (lane 3). Obese mice showed higher levels of adipose AQPap protein (lane 6) compared with those in lean mouse (lane 5). Subcellular localization of AQPap protein was studied in the differentiated 3T3-L1 cells by confocal immunocytoscopy. AQPap immunoreactivity was detected in the intracellular region around the nucleus with a scattered pattern (Fig. 6 c). When the cells were stimulated by 10−6m epinephrine for 20 min, the signals in the plasma membrane became robust in comparison with those in the intracellular regions (Fig. 6 c), suggesting that AQPap was translocated from intracellular regions to the plasma membrane. The water and glycerol permeability of most aquaporins is inhibited by mercury ions by affecting the cysteine residue near the well conserved NPA (Asn-Pro-Ala) motif, which takes part in the channel forming process (36.Preston G.M. Jung J.S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We previously reported that the osmotic water permeability in AQPap-expressing Xenopus oocytes was inhibited by HgCl2 and that this inhibition was recovered by the addition of 2-mercaptoethanol similar to the other AQPs (15.Kuriyama H. Kawamoto S. Ishida N. Ohno I. Mita S. Matsuzawa Y. Matsubara K. Okubo K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The effect of mercury ions on glycerol release in 3T3-L1 cells was investigated. We tested various concentrations of HgCl2 on epinephrine-stimulated glycerol release from the cells. Administration of HgCl2 at concentrations greater than 10 μmeffectively suppressed glycerol release (Fig.7 a). Treatment of 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol recovered the inhibition of glycerol release between the concentration of 10 and 40 μm of HgCl2 (Fig. 7 a). The inhibition of glycerol release by HgCl2 was also confirmed by a separate experiment. Glycerol release was reduced to 19% by the addition of 30 μm HgCl2 (control versusHgCl2, p < 0.0001) and was restored by the supplementation of 2-mercaptoethanol (ME) (HgCl2 + MEversus HgCl2, p < 0.0001) (Fig.7 b). The addition of 2-mercaptoethanol alone did not affect the amount of glycerol released (data not shown). These data suggest that glycerol release from adipocytes is facilitated through AQPap, which is the only detectable aquaglyceroporin in adipocytes. Adipose tissue is a major site of glycerol production and secretion (37.Ramsay T.G. Endocrinol. Metab. Clin. North Am. 1996; 25: 847-870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Molecules responsible for glycerol release from adipocytes, however, have not yet been elucidated. Recently using the cDNA library from human adipose tissue, we have identified a novel member of the AQP family. As the mRNA of this AQP was expressed most abundantly in adipose tissue, we termed it AQPap (15.Kuriyama H. Kawamoto S. Ishida N. Ohno I. Mita S. Matsuzawa Y. Matsubara K. Okubo K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Although some members of the AQP family possess permeability to small molecules, including urea and glycerol as well as water, the physiological significance has been obscure. In the current study using mice, we demonstrated that 1) AQPap was the only aquaglyceroporin expressed in adipocytes, 2) fasting enhanced and refeeding suppressed its mRNA expression in adipose tissue, 3) adipose AQP mRNA was overexpressed in obese mice with elevated adipose glycerol concentration. These data prompted us to hypothesize that AQPap functions as a glycerol channel in adipocytes. This hypothesis is supported by the result that glycerol release from adipocytes was mercury sensitive. Insulin is the major hormone that suppresses lipolysis (38.O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Adipose expression of AQPap mRNA was enhanced in fasted mice whose insulin levels in plasma had decreased. Long-term fasting has been found to increase HSL mRNA levels in adipose tissues in rats (39.Sztalryd C. Kraemer F.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: E179-E185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FATP expression is also augmented by fasting and is thought to facilitate fatty acid efflux from the adipose cell during lipolysis (40.Man M.Z. Hui T.Y. Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Bernlohr D.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Administration of insulin reduced the expression of AQPap in dose-dependent and time course-dependent manners in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. It had been shown that insulin negatively regulates the expression of HSL and FATP genes (40.Man M.Z. Hui T.Y. Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Bernlohr D.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 41.Botion L.M. Green A. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1691-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Coordinated regulation of HSL, FATP, and AQPap expression will be beneficial for the effective release of FFA and glycerol from adipocytes. The suppression of AQPap mRNA expression by feeding was impaired in obese mice with insulin resistance. Consistent with this finding, we have observed that the interstitial glycerol concentration in subcutaneous fat tissue was elevated in obese mice using the microdialysis technique. It has been reported that glycerol production in fat tissue was increased in human obesity (33.Jansson P.A. Larsson A. Smith U. Lonnroth P. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1610-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Hyperglycerolemia is a frequent finding of obesity and is often associated with increased rates of lipolysis (33.Jansson P.A. Larsson A. Smith U. Lonnroth P. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1610-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Increased glycerol turnover rate in obesity contributes to increased hepatic glucose production, resulting in hyperglycemia (42.Bergman R.N. Mittelman S.D. J. Basic Clin. Physiol.

Impaired suppression of AQPap in the insulin-resistant state may be involved in increased hepatic glucose output through hyperglycerolemia. In non-stimulated 3T3-L1 cells, AQPap immunoreactivity was detected in the perinuclear cytoplasm with a scattered distribution, suggesting that AQPap resides in the intracellular vesicles. After stimulation of epinephrine for 20 min, the intensity of AQPap signals in the plasma membrane was increased. These findings suggest that AQPap protein was translocated from the intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane. Among the members of the AQP family, AQP2 is located on the principal cells of the renal collecting duct and translocated from the intracellular vesicles to plasma membrane by short exposure to arginine-vasopressin (45.Nielsen S.

Phosphorylation of AQP2 through the protein kinase A cascade triggers the translocation of AQP2 (46.Kuwahara M. Fushimi K. Terada Y. Bai L. Marumo F. Sasaki S. J. Biol.

In adipocytes, binding of epinephrine to adrenergic receptors phosphorylates HSL at several serine residues and activates the enzyme through the protein kinase A pathway (47.Honnor R.C. Dhillon G.S.

In conclusion, AQPap is the only aquaglyceroporin that transports glycerol into adipose tissue. Studies on mRNA regulation strongly suggest that AQPap is responsible for the nutritional effect on plasma glycerol and that the disturbed regulation of AQPap mRNA is crucial for hyperglycerolemia in the insulin-resistant state.

https://openalex.org/W2056734858,"In this study we have investigated the molecular mechanisms of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) action on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene expression. Treatment with insulin or IGF-I for 4 h increased the abundance of VEGF mRNA in NIH3T3 fibroblasts expressing either the human insulin receptor (NIH-IR) or the human IGF-I receptor (NIH-IGFR) by 6- and 8-fold, respectively. The same elevated levels of mRNA were maintained after 24 h of stimulation with insulin, whereas IGF-I treatment further increased VEGF mRNA expression to 12-fold after 24 h. Pre-incubation with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin abolished the effect of insulin on VEGF mRNA expression in NIH-IR cells but did not modify the IGF-I-induced VEGF mRNA expression in NIH-IGFR cells. Blocking mitogen-activated protein kinase activation with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 abolished the effect of IGF-I on VEGF mRNA expression in NIH-IGFR cells but had no effect on insulin-induced VEGF mRNA expression in NIH-IR cells. Expression of a constitutively active PKB in NIH-IR cells induced the expression of VEGF mRNA, which was not further modified by insulin treatment. We conclude that VEGF induction by insulin and IGF-I occurs via different signaling pathways, the former involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B and the latter involving MEK/mitogen-activated protein kinase.

D'Amore P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 217-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). However, many diseases are driven by persistent unregulated angiogenesis. In arthritis, new capillary blood vessels invade the joint, destroying cartilage (2.Firestein G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 3-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and tumor growth and metastasis are angiogenesis-dependent (3.Folkman J. J. Natl.

Diabetic retinopathy is characterized by progressive alterations in the retinal microvasculature, leading to the formation of areas of retinal non-perfusion, increased vasopermeability, and the pathologic intra-ocular proliferation of retinal vessels. Increased vasopermeability and uncontrolled neovascularization can result in severe and permanent visual loss in diabetic patients (5.Aiello L.P. Gardner T.W. King G.L. Blankenship G. Cavallerano J.D. Ferris III, F.L. Klein R. Diabetes Care. 1998; 21: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). A variety of growth factors are associated with angiogenesis, including tumor necrosis factor, transforming growth factor β, and basic fibroblast growth factor. However, many of these factors are believed to induce angiogenesis indirectly (1.Klagsbrun M. D'Amore P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 217-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar, 6.Folkman J. Shing Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10931-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)1 is a unique potent angiogenic factor that stimulates capillary formation in vivo and has direct mitogenic actions that are restricted to endothelial cells (7.Thomas K.A.

Rev. 1992; 13: 18-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar). Human VEGF has at least four structurally related isoforms, VEGF121, VEGF165, VEGF189, and VEGF206, resulting from alternative splicing of the VEGF gene (9.Houck K.A. Ferrara N. Winer J. Cachianes G. Li B. Leung D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1806-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar, 10.Tischer E. Mitchell R. Hartman T. Silva M. Gospodarowicz D. Fiddes J.C. Abraham J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11947-11954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of these, VEGF165 has the most potent biological activity and is the most abundant subtype in vivo (11.Ogawa S. Oku A. Sawano A. Yamaguchi S. Yazaki Y. Shibuya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31273-31282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). VEGF121 is also well expressed in many normal and pathological tissues; however, its biological activity has been shown to be 10–100-fold weaker than that of VEGF165 (11.Ogawa S. Oku A. Sawano A. Yamaguchi S. Yazaki Y. Shibuya M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31273-31282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). VEGF is secreted by many cell types, and its expression is regulated by a number of growth factors and cytokines. For example, interleukin 1-β (12.Li J. Perrella M.A. Tsai J.C. Yet S.F. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Patterson C. Endege W.O. Zhou F. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 308-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and transforming growth factor β (13.Brogi E. Wu T. Namiki A. Isner J.M. Circulation. 1994; 90: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) stimulate VEGF production by smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, stimulation of NIH3T3 fibroblasts by PDGF also results in the induction of the VEGF gene in a Ras- and Raf-dependent manner (14.Grugel S. Finkenzeller G. Weindel K. Barleon B. Marme D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25915-25919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). However, the precise molecular mechanisms involved in the induction of VEGF expression by growth factors remains poorly understood. Insulin plays a central role in regulating metabolic pathways associated with energy storage and utilization but also with cell growth control (15.Taylor R. Clin. Endocrinol. 1991; 34: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A perturbation of normal insulin-induced metabolic responses is central to the pathology of type 2 diabetes (16.Kahn C.R. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1066-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Following ligand binding, the insulin receptor kinase is activated, leading to the phosphorylation of intracellular proteins including IRS-1, IRS-2, and Shc. These initial events lead to the stimulation of multiple signaling cascades that mediate the cellular responses to insulin (16.Kahn C.R. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1066-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 17.Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin promotes the transcription of a variety of genes, including those encoding the glucose transporter GLUT1 and VEGF, by inducing the hypoxia-inducible factor HIF-1α/ARNT (18.Zelzer E. Levy Y. Kahana C. Shilo B.Z. Rubinstein M. Cohen B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5085-5094Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is a homologue of insulin and shares many signaling components and cellular responses with insulin itself (19.Blakesley V.A. Scrimgeour A. Esposito D. LeRoith D. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1996; 7: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). IGF-I is also able to induce the expression of different genes, including that encoding VEGF (18.Zelzer E. Levy Y. Kahana C. Shilo B.Z. Rubinstein M. Cohen B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5085-5094Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Indeed, IGF-I increases the expression of VEGF mRNA and production of VEGF protein by COLO 205 colon carcinoma cells (20.Warren R.S. Yuan H. Matli M.R. Ferrara N. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29483-29488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and enhances expression of VEGF in osteoblasts (21.Goad D.L. Rubin J. Wang H. Tashjian Jr., A.H. Patterson C. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2262-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IGF-I levels are shown to be elevated in the vitreous of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (22.Pfeiffer A. Spranger J. Meyer-Schwickerath R. Schatz H. Diabetes. 1997; 46 Suppl. 2: 26-30Crossref Google Scholar). Although many of the effects of insulin and IGF-I are similar, these proteins have differing effects in vivo, and it is therefore important to define the molecular basis for this. Considering the key role of VEGF in controlling angiogenesis (23.Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4750) Google Scholar), we wished to identify the growth factor-activated signaling pathways involved in controlling VEGF gene expression. In this study we have used NIH3T3 fibroblasts expressing equal numbers of either the insulin (NIH-IR) or IGF-I (NIH-IGFR) receptors, allowing for direct comparison of signaling by these two polypeptides. Having determined that VEGF expression is regulated in these cells, we have sought to more clearly define the signaling pathways used by insulin and IGF-I to modulate VEGF gene expression. VEGF165 cDNA was a gift from J. Plouet (CNRS-Lab. Biologie Moléculaire, Toulouse, France). PKBmyr was a gift from B. Hemmings (F. Miescher Inst., Basel, Switzerland). Monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin 12CA5 antibody and the phospho-specific PKB (Ser473) antibody were obtained as described in Filippa et al. (24.Filippa N. Sable C.L. Filloux C. Hemmings B. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4989-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Culture media were from Life Technologies, Inc. Reagents for SDS-PAGE were purchased from Bio-Rad. Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were from Sigma. NIH3T3 fibroblasts expressing either human insulin receptor or human IGF-I receptor were described in Tartareet al. (25.Tartare S. Mothe I. Kowalski-Chauvel A. Breittmayer J.P. Ballotti R. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11449-11455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% v/v bovine calf serum (HyClone), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 atmosphere. To inhibit PI 3-kinase and MAP kinase activities, cells were pre-incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 100 nm wortmannin or 50 μm PD98059, respectively. Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to extract total cellular RNA from confluent cells grown in 100-mm tissue culture plates according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were serum-deprived overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% w/v bovine serum albumin and then incubated with either 100 nm insulin, 10 nm IGF-I, or 50 ng/ml PDGF for the times indicated. RNA was extracted, and 20 μg of RNA samples were resolved by formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis in MOPS buffer, transferred to a nylon membrane (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA), and cross-linked to the membrane by UV irradiation. Blots were then hybridized overnight at 42 °C to the appropriate probe labeled by the random priming method using the Rediprime kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After hybridization, membranes were washed in 0.2× standard sodium citrate, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C. The blots were exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) with an intensifying screen at –80 °C for 24 h. Where indicated, 10 μg/ml cycloheximide was used to inhibit protein synthesis. To determine the effect of insulin and IGF-I on VEGF mRNA stability, cells were treated for 4 h with 100 nm insulin or 10 nm IGF-I, and then transcription was blocked by the addition of 2.5 μg/ml actinomycin D for 1, 2, 3, and 4 h. HUVEC were isolated from umbilical veins by digestion with collagenase as described previously (26.Barbieri B. Balconi G. Dejana E. Donati M.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1981; 168: 204-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in endothelial cell basal medium-2-supplemented endothelial cell medium (Clonetics, BioWhittaker) and were used between passages 2 and 4. HUVEC were seeded into 12-well plates (104 cells/well). After 24 h, either 6 ng/ml VEGF (PeproTech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ) or medium from NIH-IR or NIH-IGFR cells incubated with insulin and IGF-I, respectively, were added to the cells. For VEGF immunodepletion, conditioned medium was incubated for 1 h with a monoclonal antibody to VEGF (Becton Dickinson Laboratories) coupled to protein G-Sepharose and centrifuged for 2 min at 10,000 rpm, and then the supernatant was added to the cells. After 4 days the number of cells in each well was determined by two readings with a Coulter counter. Results are the mean of two separate experiments in which each condition was tested in triplicate. Cells were stimulated with 100 nm insulin or 10 nm IGF-I for the indicated times and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 mm NaF, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 IU/ml aprotinin, 20 μmleupeptin, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (TAT buffer) for 15 min at 4 °C. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, then samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore Corp., Bedford, Mass.). Membranes were blocked for 1 h in TBS (10 nm Tris-HCl, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 4% w/v bovine serum albumin and then incubated either with a monoclonal antibody to VEGF (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), with the phospho-specific PKB (Ser473) antibody, or with an antibody to phosphorylated MAP kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) as indicated. After extensive washing in TBS containing 1% v/v Triton X-100, detection was performed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody and ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were stimulated with 100 nm insulin or 10 nm IGF-I for 15 min at 37 °C as indicated and solubilized for 40 min at 4 °C in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Aliquots of the lysates were precipitated with an anti-IRS-1 antibody coupled to protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. PI 3-kinase activity was determined in immunoimmunoprecipitates as described in Filippa et al. (24.Filippa N. Sable C.L. Filloux C. Hemmings B. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4989-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Cells were transiently transfected with a constitutively active form of PKB, PKBmyr (27.Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31515-31524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar), tagged with the hemagglutinin epitope, using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells extracts were prepared as already described, and then samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in TBS containing 4% w/v bovine serum albumin and then incubated with the appropriate antibody. After extensive washing in TBS containing 1% v/v Triton X-100, detection was performed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody and ECL Western blotting detection reagents. To determine whether insulin and/or IGF-I were able to induce VEGF production in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, cells expressing either the human insulin receptor (NIH-IR) or IGF-I receptor (NIH-IGFR) (25.Tartare S. Mothe I. Kowalski-Chauvel A. Breittmayer J.P. Ballotti R. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11449-11455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were treated with insulin or IGF-I, respectively, for various times. Expression of VEGF was then determined by Northern blotting. As shown in Fig. 1, incubation with insulin for 4 h increased the abundance of VEGF mRNA in NIH-IR cells by 6-fold over that in untreated cells (panel A). These levels of mRNA expression were maintained after 24 h of insulin treatment and decreased within 48 h. Similarly, treatment of NIH-IGFR cells with IGF-I for 4 h led to an 8-fold increase in VEGF mRNA accumulation (Fig. 1, panel B). However, treatment with IGF-I for 24 and 48 h further increased VEGF mRNA expression up to 12-fold greater than basal levels. Thus, both insulin and IGF stimulate VEGF mRNA expression in NIH-IR or NIH-IGFR fibroblasts, respectively, allowing use of these cells to study the mechanisms underlying these effects. We next wished to determine whether insulin or IGF-I increased the stability of VEGF mRNA. NIH-IR or NIH-IGFR cells were treated with insulin or IGF-I, respectively, for 4 h, then transcription was terminated by the addition of actinomycin D. Following inhibition of transcription the loss of insulin (Fig.2, panel A) or IGF-I (Fig. 2,panel B), induced VEGF mRNA was rapid and not significantly different from that observed in the untreated cells. The failure of both growth factors to increase the half-life of VEGF mRNA suggests that insulin and IGF-I increase transcription of the VEGF gene in these cells. To determine whether new protein synthesis was involved in insulin- or IGF-I-induced VEGF mRNA transcription, cells were incubated with cycloheximide before growth factor treatment. The addition of cycloheximide alone led to a 2-fold enhancement of VEGF mRNA, thus, substantially less than that observed in insulin- or IGF-I-treated cells. After treatment with cycloheximide, both insulin (Fig.3, panel A) and IGF-I (Fig. 3,panel B) induced an increase in VEGF mRNA expression similar to that observed in the absence of cycloheximide. Thus, although inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide alone led to a slight increase in VEGF mRNA expression, the stimulation by either insulin or IGF-I was retained. These data suggest that the stimulation of VEGF mRNA expression by insulin and IGF-I is not induced by increased synthesis of a regulatory protein but rather via the acute activation of intracellular signaling pathways. We compared also GLUT1 mRNA expression in NIH-IR versusNIH-IGFR cells. The expression of GLUT1 mRNA increased after 4 h of stimulation with either insulin (Fig. 3, panel A) or IGF-I (Fig. 3, panel B), respectively, and decreased after 24 h as described previously (18.Zelzer E. Levy Y. Kahana C. Shilo B.Z. Rubinstein M. Cohen B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5085-5094Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Thus, unlike VEGF, the time course of stimulation of GLUT1 gene expression is similar for both insulin and IGF-I in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, suggesting that the observed differences were not due to differences in the cell line used. To determine whether VEGF mRNA induction by insulin and IGF-I led to increased VEGF secretion by the cells, we analyzed the level of VEGF in culture supernatants of insulin- and IGF-I-treated cells with an endothelial cell proliferation assay. Medium from NIH-IR cells treated with insulin for 4 h increased the number of HUVEC by 1.4-fold, as shown in Fig. 4. The same increase was observed when HUVEC were incubated with conditioned medium from cells treated with insulin for 24 h. Supernatants of NIH-IGFR cells treated for 4 or for 24 h with IGF-I increased the number of HUVEC by 1.3- and 1.6-fold, respectively (Fig. 4, panel A). Insulin and IGF-I alone or media obtained from untreated NIH-IR and NIH-IGFR cells did not significantly increase proliferation of HUVEC. Furthermore, when VEGF was immunoprecipitated from media obtained from NIH-IR cells treated with insulin for 4 h or from NIH-IGFR treated for 24 h with IGF-I, the proliferative effects of these media were abolished (Fig. 4, panel A). To further study the expression of VEGF protein by these cells we made lysates of insulin- or IGF-I-treated NIH-IR and NIH-IGFR, respectively, and analyzed them for VEGF protein expression by Western blotting. After 4 h of insulin treatment in NIH-IR, the amount of VEGF increased by 4-fold compared with basal levels. The same increase was observed when cells were stimulated with insulin for 24 h (Fig. 4,panel B). In NIH-IGFR cells treated for 4 or for 24 h with IGF-I, the VEGF protein level was increased by 3- and 7-fold, respectively (Fig. 4, panel B). Interestingly, the time courses for VEGF expression correlate well with the expression of VEGF mRNA induced by each ligand (compare with Fig. 3). These observations demonstrate that the stimulatory effect of insulin and IGF-I on VEGF gene expression in NIH fibroblasts leads to the production and secretion of active VEGF protein under these conditions. To more clearly define the signaling mechanisms involved in the insulin- and IGF-I-stimulated VEGF mRNA expression, we examined the role of two key enzymes involved in growth factor signaling, namely PI 3-kinase and MAP kinase. To this end, cells were preincubated with either the selective PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin or the MEK inhibitor PD98059 before growth factor treatment. As shown in Fig.5, insulin treatment led to a robust activation of IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase in NIH-IR cells and, similarly, activation of PKB (Fig. 5, panels A andB). Preincubation with wortmannin completely blocked the activation of PKB by insulin. Insulin also led to the stimulation of MAP kinase, which could be completely prevented by pre-treatment with PD98059 (Fig. 5, panel C). In an almost identical fashion, in NIH-IGFR cells IGF-I stimulated PI 3-kinase and, consequently, PKB activity, in a wortmannin-sensitive manner (Fig. 5, panels D and E). IGF-I also stimulated MAP kinase activity, which could be blocked by pre-treatment with PD98059 (Fig. 5, panel F). When PKB activities were measured by kinase assays, insulin- and IGF-I-treatment led to 3.8- and 4.2-fold increases in activity in NIH-IR and NIH-IGFR cells, respectively (data not shown). Therefore, the extent of the stimulation of PKB by insulin and IGF-I was very similar. As shown in Fig. 6, pre-incubation of NIH-IR cells with PD98059 to prevent MAP kinase activation did not affect the stimulation of VEGF mRNA expression by insulin (Fig. 6,panel A) despite MAP kinase activity being completely inhibited in these cells (Fig. 5, panel C). When PI 3-kinase was inhibited with wortmannin, however, the stimulation of VEGF mRNA expression by insulin was almost completely abolished (Fig. 6,panel B). Insulin-induced GLUT1 mRNA expression was also inhibited by wortmannin, as previously demonstrated (28.Barthel A. Okino S.T. Liao J. Nakatani K. Li J. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20281-20286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and unmodified by PD98059 (Fig. 6, panel C). In contrast, pre-treatment of NIH-IGFR cells with PD98059 abolished the IGF-I-induced expression of VEGF mRNA (Fig.7, panel A), whereas wortmannin had no effect (Fig. 7, panel B). As with insulin, IGF-I-induced GLUT1 mRNA expression was blocked in the presence of wortmannin, whereas PD98059 had no effect (Fig. 7, panel C). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that different pathways exist for the stimulation of VEGF mRNA expression by insulin and IGF-I. Although insulin requires the stimulation of PI 3-kinase activity to induce the expression of VEGF mRNA, IGF-I does not. However, insulin does not require the activation of MAP kinase to increase VEGF mRNA expression, whereas MAP kinase activity is critical for that induced by IGF-I. In contrast, both insulin and IGF-I use the same PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway to activate GLUT1 gene expression. To further confirm that the differences observed between the effects of insulin and IGF-I on VEGF mRNA expression were not due to differences between the cell lines, we examined signaling by a different growth factor, PDGF, in these two cell lines. It has been demonstrated previously that the stimulation of VEGF mRNA expression by PDGF occurs via protein kinase Cα (29.Finkenzeller G. Marme D. Weich H.A. Hug H.

Consistent with this, we observed an almost identical stimulation of VEGF mRNA expression by PDGF in the two cell types that was unaffected by either wortmannin or PD98059 (Fig. 8). To investigate the role of other proteins downstream of PI 3-kinase in insulin-dependent VEGF gene regulation, we used the selective inhibitor of p70S6K, rapamycin, to determine its possible involvement. Rapamycin had no effect either on insulin- or on IGF-I-induced VEGF mRNA expression (data not shown). Next we examined the involvement of PKB in this process. To this end, we transiently transfected NIH-IR cells with a constitutively active form of PKB (PKBmyr). The expression of the constitutively active enzyme induced a strong increase in VEGF mRNA in the absence of insulin that was not further enhanced by insulin treatment (Fig.9, panel A). Similar results were obtained for GLUT1 mRNA, which was strongly induced by PKBmyr expression and not further stimulated by insulin (Fig. 9, panel A). We confirmed that the PKBmyr was expressed and constitutively phosphorylated in transfected cells by Western blotting with antibodies to HA epitope and phospho-Ser473 PKB, respectively (Fig. 9, panel B). These results indicate that the activation of PKB alone is sufficient to induce the VEGF gene expression in NIH3T3 cells and so could mediate insulin effect on VEGF expression. As IGF-I-induced VEGF expression is independent of PI 3-kinase, this pathway cannot be involved. Indeed, we have shown that this effect occurs via MAP kinase activation. Angiogenesis is a fundamental process required for organ development and differentiation during embryogenesis as well as for wound healing and reproductive functions in adults (1.Klagsbrun M.

However, a variety of disorders are driven by unregulated angiogenesis including tumor development, rheumatoid arthritis, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (2.Firestein G.S. J. Clin.

Poltorak Z. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (3116) Google Scholar). Hypoxia is probably the best-characterized regulator of VEGF expression apparently inducing transcription of the VEGF mRNA via binding of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1 to a binding site located in the VEGF promoter (33.Shweiki D.

To investigate the role of ACAT-1 in atherosclerosis, we have generated ACAT-1 null (ACAT-1−/−) mice. ACAT activities were present in the liver and intestine but were completely absent in adrenal, testes, ovaries, and peritoneal macrophages in our ACAT-1−/− mice. The ACAT-1−/− mice had decreased openings of the eyes because of atrophy of the meibomian glands, a modified form of sebaceous glands normally expressing high ACAT activities. This phenotype is similar to dry eye syndrome in humans. To determine the role of ACAT-1 in atherogenesis, we crossed the ACAT-1−/− mice with mice lacking apolipoprotein (apo) E or the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), hyperlipidemic models susceptible to atherosclerosis. High fat feeding resulted in extensive cutaneous xanthomatosis with loss of hair in both ACAT-1−/−:apo E−/− and ACAT-1−/−:LDLR−/− mice. Free cholesterol content was significantly increased in their skin. Aortic fatty streak lesion size as well as cholesteryl ester content were moderately reduced in both double mutant mice compared with their respective controls. These results indicate that the local inhibition of ACAT activity in tissue macrophages is protective against cholesteryl ester accumulation but causes cutaneous xanthomatosis in mice that lack apo E or LDLR.

After lipolytic conversion, these lipoproteins are taken up by the cells of various organs, where their cholesteryl esters (CE) are hydrolyzed in lysosomes to liberate free cholesterol (FC), which is re-esterified by ACAT again for storage in cytoplasmic lipid droplets. Two ACAT genes have been identified in mammals (3.Chang C.C. Huh H.Y. Cadigan K.M. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20747-20755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Anderson R.A.

Cadigan K.M. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20747-20755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is ubiquitously expressed. In particular, it is highly expressed in preputial glands, steroidogenic organs, sebaceous glands, and macrophages (7.Uelmen P.J. Oka K. Sullivan M. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.Y. Chan L. J. Biol.

ACAT-1 is also expressed in macrophage-derived foam cells in human atherosclerotic lesions (10.Miyazaki A. Sakashita N. Lee O. Takahashi K. Horiuchi S. Hakamata H. Morganelli P.M. Chang C.C.

Therefore, it is plausible that inhibition of ACAT in the arterial wall cells exerts a protective effect against atherosclerosis. In contrast, ACAT-2 is expressed only in the liver and small intestine and is conceivably involved in lipoprotein assembly and secretion (4.Anderson R.A. Joyce C. Davis M. Reagan J.W. Clark M.

Consistently, ACAT activities were eliminated from the macrophages and adrenal glands but not from the liver in ACAT-1 knockout mice reported by Meiner et al. (11.Meiner V.L. Cases S. Myers H.M. Sande E.R. Bellosta S. Schambelan M. Pitas R.E. McGuire J. Herz J. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14041-14046Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 12.Joyce C.

To further explore the other unknown functions of ACAT-1 and to determine whether the elimination of ACAT-1 has an anti-atherogenic effect, we have generated ACAT-1 knockout mice by homologous recombination with a targeting vector that is designed to delete the first membrane spanning region plus a serine 268 that is crucial for the catalytic activity of ACAT-1 (13.Cao G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

Reddick R.L. Piedrahita J.A. Maeda N. Science. 1992; 258: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar), and the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-deficient (LDLR−/−) mice (15.Ishibashi S. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Gerard R.D. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 883-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar), which are susceptible to atherosclerosis. Standard molecular biology techniques were used (16.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Before sacrifice, mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital. Sick mice were euthanized. The current experiments were performed in accord with institutional guidelines for animal experiments at the University of Tokyo. Three diets were used: (i) a normal chow diet (MF diet from Oriental Yeast Co., Tokyo) that contained 5.6% (w/w) fat with 0.09% (w/w) cholesterol; (ii) a high fat diet A: MF diet containing 0.15% (w/w) cholesterol and 15% (w/w) butter (essentially similar to Western style diet (17.Yagyu H.

Morrow A. Brandon C. Mitchell D. Holmes P. Atherosclerosis. 1985; 57: 65-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 19.Ishibashi S. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Herz J. Burns D.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1885-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments have shown that feeding with high fat diet B made many of the apo E−/− mice sick probably because of extreme hyperlipidemia irrespective of the presence of the ACAT-1 gene. On the other hand, LDLR−/− mice developed only a minimal lesions in 8 weeks when fed with high fat diet A. Accordingly, two different high fat diets were used to analyze ACAT-1−/−:apo E−/− or ACAT-1−/−:LDLR−/− double knockout mice. A fragment (1623 base pairs) of mouse ACAT-1 cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers that were designed based on reported sequences of human ACAT-1 cDNA (sense primer, 5′-ATGGTGGGTGAAGAGAAGATGTCTCTAAGAA-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-AAACACGTAACGACAAGTCCAGGAACGTGG-3′) (3.Chang C.C. Huh H.Y. Cadigan K.M. Chang T.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20747-20755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was subcloned into pCRII (Invitrogen). After labeling with 32P using the Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the cDNA fragment was used as a probe to screen a 129/Sv mouse genomic library, which had been constructed in Lambda Dash II (Stratagene) as described previously (20.Osuga J.

A 1-kb fragment in intron 5 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the following primers: sense primer, 5′-CGCTCGAGTTCAGTCCTCATTAATGAG-3′ and antisense primer, 5′-CGCTCGAGGTAAATTGTTCTGATGTGG-3′, and used as the short arm (22.Li B.-L.

Another 13-kb genomic clone that contained a fragment of the ACAT gene spanning intron 11 to exon 16 was directly used as the long arm. A replacement-type targeting vector was constructed by ligating the short and long arms into the XhoI and NotI sites, respectively, of the vector pPolIIshort-neobpA-HSVTK as described previously (15.Ishibashi S.

A 4-kb piece of the gene that contained exons 6–10, which encoded the first membrane spanning domain (23.Lin S. Cheng D. Liu M.-S. Chen J. Chang T.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23276-23285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and serine 268 that is crucial for the enzyme activity (13.Cao G. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14642-14648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), was replaced by a neomycin-resistant cassette. Theoretically, homologous recombination would produce a totally inactive enzyme. After digestion with SalI, the vector was electroporated into JH1 embryonic stem cells. Targeted clones that had been selected in the presence of G418 and 1-(2-deoxy, 2-fluoro-β-d-arabinofuranosyl)-5 iodouracil were identified by polymerase chain reaction using the following primers: 5′-TCTGGAGAAAAATGCAGGCTTCTTAC-3′ and 5′-GATTGGGAAGACAATAGCAGGCATGC-3′ (see Fig. 1 A). Homologous recombination was verified by Southern blot analysis after digestion with EcoRI using a fragment that was upstream of the short arm as a probe (probe B; see Fig. 1 A). Targeted embryonic stem clones were injected into the C57BL/6J blastocysts, yielding four lines of chimeric mice that transmitted the disrupted allele through the germline. All experiments reported here were performed with 129/Sv-C57BL/6J hybrid descendants (F1 and subsequent generations) of these animals. For genotyping, tail DNA was digested with BamHI and subjected to Southern blot analyses using probe A (see Fig. 1 A). ACAT-1+/− mice were cross-bred to apo E−/− or LDLR−/− mice to produce mice that were heterozygous for the disrupted alleles of both ACAT-1 and either apo E or the LDL receptor loci. The intercross of these animals was performed to produce ACAT-1+/−:apo E−/− and ACAT-1+/−:LDLR−/−. Brother-sister mating of ACAT-1+/−:apo E−/− or ACAT-1+/−:LDLR−/− mice was performed to produce a set of apo E-deficient mice (ACAT-1+/+:apo E−/−, ACAT-1+/−:apo E−/−, and ACAT-1−/−:apo E−/−) or a set of the LDL receptor-deficient mice (ACAT-1+/+:LDLR−/−, ACAT-1+/−:LDLR−/−, and ACAT-1−/−:LDLR−/−), respectively. Littermates were used as controls. Therefore, genetic background of these animals were mixed: 50% C57BL/6J and 50% 129/Sv. Peritoneal macrophages were prepared as described previously (17.Yagyu H. Ishibashi S. Chen Z. Osuga J. Okazaki M. Perrey S. Kitamine T. Shimada M. Ohashi K. Harada K. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Gotoda T. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. J. Lipid.

Total RNA was isolated from cultured peritoneal macrophages by using TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 10 μg of total RNA was subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel containing formamide and transferred to a nylon filter (Hybond N, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). cDNA probes (the 1623-base pair coding region of ACAT-1 and β-actin) were radiolabeled with [γ-32P]dCTP. After prehybridization for 2 h, blots were hybridized in RapidhybR buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with indicated probes for 1 h at 65 °C. cDNA fragment encoding N-terminal 125 amino acids of ACAT-1 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers (sense primer, 5′-GAGCATATGTCACTAAGAAACCGGCTGTCA-3′; antisense primer, 5′-TTCGGATCCTTAGTCTAAAAGAGACTGCCT-3′) and cDNA pool made from mouse peritoneal macrophages and subcloned into the expression vector PW6A (24.Fujimura K. Ise N. Ueno E. Hori T. Fujii N. Okada M. J. Clin. Lab. Anal. 1997; 11: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). After transformation, Escherichia coli, BL21(DE3), were grown in LB medium in the presence of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were disrupted by sonication and centrifuged to remove cellular debris. The recombinant ACAT-1 peptide was purified by chromatography using SP Sepharose FF column followed by Superdex 75 columns. ACAT-1−/− mice were immunized with the purified recombinant ACAT-1 peptide. Standard technique was used to generate a monoclonal antibody (25.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Peritoneal macrophages (1 × 107 cells) were resuspended in 100 μl of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 5% SDS. After an overnight incubation at 4 °C, 50 μg of protein was subjected to SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane, immunoblot was performed using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as the secondary antibody. After a 16-h fast, blood was collected from the retro-orbital venous plexus into tubes containing EDTA. Plasma levels of total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) were determined enzymatically using kits (Determiner TC555 and Determiner TG555, Kyowa Medex). Lipoproteins were fractionated by high performance chromatography (HPLC), and the cholesterol contents in high density lipoprotein fraction (HDL-C) were determined as described (17.Yagyu H. Ishibashi S. Chen Z. Osuga J. Okazaki M. Perrey S. Kitamine T. Shimada M. Ohashi K. Harada K. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Gotoda T. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. J. Lipid. Res. 1999; 40: 1677-1685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipids were extracted from tissues by the method of Folch et al. (26.Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TC and FC were determined by fluorometric microassay according to a modified method of Heider and Boyett (27.Heider J. Boyett R.L. J. Lipid. Res. 1978; 19: 514-518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the exception that 0.01% (v/v) Triton X-100 was used instead of Carbowax-600. Tissue was homogenized in buffer B (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0) and centrifuged at 107,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended and used for the assay. ACAT activity in microsomes or cell homogenates was determined by the rate of incorporation of [14C]oleoyl-CoA into the CE fraction according to Billheimer et al. with minor modifications (28.Billheimer J.T. Tavani D. Nes W.R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 111: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 29.Becker A. Bottcher A. Lackner K.J. Fehringer P. Notka F. Aslanidis C. Schmitz G. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1346-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Tissues were fixed with neutral-buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The aortic cross-sectional lesion area was evaluated according to a modified method of Paigen et al. (17.Yagyu H. Ishibashi S. Chen Z. Osuga J. Okazaki M. Perrey S. Kitamine T. Shimada M. Ohashi K.

Williams R.A. Atherosclerosis. 1987; 68: 231-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). In brief, the hearts were perfused with saline containing 4% (w/v) formalin and fixed for more than 48 h in the same solution. The basal half of the hearts was embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Miles, Inc.), and the serial sections were captured using Cryostat microtome (6-μm thick) as described (31.Shimada M. Ishibashi S. Inaba T. Yagyu H. Harada K. Osuga J.-I. Ohashi K. Yazaki Y. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7242-7246Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Four sections, each separated by 60 μm, were used to evaluate the lesions: two at the end of the aortic sinus and two at the junctional site of sinus and ascending aorta. The sections were stained with Oil Red O and counter-stained with hematoxylin. Data are represented as the means ± S.D. Student's t test and analysis of variance were used to compare the mean values between two and three groups, respectively. A replacement-type vector was used to generate chimeric mice (Fig.1 A). Heterozygous ACAT-1 knockout mice (ACAT-1+/−) born by these chimera, which were viable and fertile, were intercrossed to obtain homozygous ACAT-1 knockout mice (ACAT-1−/−). Wild type, heterozygotes, and homozygotes were born in accordance with Mendelian fashion (+/+:+/−:−/− = 17:40:19, χ2 = 0.16; p = 0.92) (Fig.1 B). To determine whether the expression of the ACAT-1 gene was ablated, we performed Northern blot analyses (Fig. 1 C). Although three major mRNA transcripts (9.0, 4.6, and 3.5 kb) were detectable in wild-type macrophages, adrenal glands, ovaries, and testes, no bands were detectable in these organs from ACAT-1−/− mice. Approximately one-half of the amounts of the three transcripts were expressed by the cells from ACAT-1+/− mice. Consistent with the Northern blot results, immunoblot analyses revealed no proteins that were immunoreactive with an antibody raised against recombinant mouse ACAT-1 in the peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 1 D), adrenal glands, ovaries, and testes. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that our ACAT-1−/− mice were virtually null for ACAT-1. Table I compares ACAT activities in microsome fractions prepared from the liver, small intestine, adrenal glands, testes, and ovaries, between the wild-type and ACAT-1−/− mice. In ACAT-1−/− mice, ACAT activity was barely detectable in the adrenal glands, testes, and ovaries that normally express substantial ACAT activity in the wild-type mice. In contrast to these steroidogenic organs, the liver and small intestine from the ACAT-1−/− mice expressed ACAT activities similar to those from wild-type mice.Table IMicrosomal ACAT activities in various organs of wild-type and ACAT-1−/− miceTissueACATnACAT activitypmol/mg/minLiver+ /+3156 ± 20− /−3139 ± 36Small intestine+ /+2111− /−2221Adrenal+ /+3 aThe assay was performed on pooled samples from the indicated number of animals.

Open table in a new tab Microsome fractions were prepared from the indicated organs of wild-type (+/+) and ACAT-1−/− (−/−) mice aged 3 months. ACAT activities were measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” ACAT-1−/− mice were grossly normal except that they had narrow eye fissures and lipid-depleted adrenal glands. Abnormal facial expression was noted around the weaning age (3–4 weeks) in almost all ACAT-1−/− mice (Fig.2). Pathological examination of the eye balls and adnexa revealed that ACAT-1−/− mice had atrophic acinar cells in the meibomian glands (Fig. 2). Upon bio-microscopic examination, fine punctate stripping of the corneal epithelium was observed. No other abnormalities were found in conjunctiva, cornea, retina, or Harderian glands. Lipids in adrenal cortex were depleted in ACAT-1−/− mice (data not shown). We measured FC and CE contents in steroidogenic organs whose ACAT activities were markedly reduced in ACAT-1−/− mice and meibomian glands that exhibited remarkable acinar cell shrinkage in ACAT-1−/− mice (Fig. 3). In wild-type mice, most of cholesterol was stored in its esterified form in adrenal glands, ovaries, and meibomian glands. CE contents of these organs were markedly reduced to a base-line level in ACAT-1−/− mice. Interestingly, FC content was increased only in the meibomian glands of ACAT-1−/− mice. There were virtually no differences in CE content of testes between wild-type and ACAT-1−/− mice. To determine whether hyperlipidemia affects the phenotypes of ACAT-1−/− mice, we generated mice lacking both ACAT-1 and either apo E (ACAT-1−/−:apo E−/−) or LDL receptor (ACAT-1−/−:LDLR−/−) by cross-breeding and used their littermates as controls. Although the inactivation of the ACAT-1 gene did not have a significant effect on the lipoprotein profiles in apo E−/− mice, it slightly increased intermediate density lipoprotein/LDL cholesterol levels in LDLR−/− mice (TableII). These hyperlipidemic mice lacking the ACAT gene developed skin lesions upon aging (Fig.4). Even on a normal chow diet, about 20% of ACAT-1−/−:apo E−/− mice developed skin lesions by the age of 6 months (Fig. 4 C). Typically, hair was lost, and skin became rough and thick. In contrast, ACAT-1−/−:LDLR−/− mice did not develop obvious skin lesions, at least by the age of 6 months, as long as they were maintained on a normal chow diet.Table IIEffects of the high fat diet feeding on the plasma lipid levels of ACAT-1−/− mice lacking either apo E or LDL receptorGenotypeDietACAT-1+/+ 10 (5, 5)ACAT-1+/− 10 (4, 6)ACAT-1−/− 9 (5, 4)Apo E−/−Normal dietTC777 ± 236837 ± 392573 ± 163TG133 ± 32134 ± 32142 ± 47HDL-C 9 99High fat diet ATC1471 ± 4721202 ± 572857 ± 157 ap < 0.01versus ACAT-1+/+ mice by analysis of variance.TG181 ± 86152 ± 52156 ± 52HDL-C 11 81010 (5, 5)9 (4, 5)8 (3, 5)LDLR−/−Normal dietTC254 ± 42292 ± 48308 ± 45 bp < 0.05 versusACAT-1+/+.TG191 ± 70203 ± 63279 ± 107 bp < 0.05 versusACAT-1+/+.HDL-C149136168High fat diet BTC1918 ± 4532334 ± 308 bp < 0.05 versusACAT-1+/+.2045 ± 297TG141 ± 89145 ± 79140 ± 44HDL-C 141620At the age of 3 months, apo E-deficient mice were fed high fat diet A, and LDL receptor-deficient mice were fed high fat diet B.

When ACAT-1−/−:apo E−/− and ACAT-1−/−:LDLR−/− mice were fed high fat diets A and B, respectively, both mice developed more pronounced hypercholesterolemia (Table II) and more extensive skin lesions (Fig. 4 D). Compared with ACAT-1+/+:apo E−/− mice, ACAT-1−/−:apo E−/− mice had a 42% decrease in very LDL/intermediate density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels. There was no difference in the plasma lipoprotein profiles between ACAT-1+/+:LDLR−/− and ACAT-1−/−:LDLR−/− mice, whereas very LDL/intermediate density lipoprotein/LDL-cholesterol levels were increased in ACAT-1+/−:LDLR−/− mice by 22%. Microscopic examination revealed extensive infiltration of macrophages throughout the entire dermal layer of ACAT-1−/−:apoE−/− and ACAT-1−/−:LDLR−/− mice fed the high fat diets (Fig. 5, C andD). Many macrophages exhibited foamy appearance with multiple nuclei similar to the Touton type giant cells (Fig. 5,E and F). The thickened dermis was also filled with necrotic acellular areas containing cholesterol clefts (Fig. 5). The number of hair follicles was remarkably reduced. It is noteworthy that subcutaneous adipose tissues, which were normally present in mice with ACAT-1 gene (Fig. 5, A and B), were not discernible in the hyperlipidemic ACAT-1−/− mice. Measurements of FC and CE contents of the xathomatous skins showed that FC content was specifically increased by 5.5-fold in ACAT-1−/−:apoE−/− (20.0 ± 14.8 versus 3.7 ± 1.5 μg/mg tissue;n = 3) and 9.7-fold in ACAT-1−/−:LDLR−/− mice (31.0 ± 19.6 versus 3.2 ± 1.1 μg/mg tissue;p < 0.05, n = 3). After feeding the sets of apo E and the LDL receptor-deficient mice with high fat diets A and B, respectively, for 8 weeks, atherosclerotic lesion size was evaluated at the aortic roots (Fig. 6). ACAT-1−/−:apo E−/− mice developed a 33% smaller lesion area than ACAT-1+/+:apo E−/− mice. ACAT-1−/−:LDLR−/− mice had a 53% reduction in lesion area compared with ACAT-1+/+:LDLR−/− mice. There were no significant differences in the lesion size between males and females in each genotype. With regard to the aortic CE contents, 3-fold and 2-fold decreases were observed in ACAT-1−/−:apo E−/− mice and ACAT-1−/−:LDLR−/− mice, respectively, as compared with their ACAT-1+/+ controls (Fig. 7). In contrast to cutaneous xanthomas, aortic FC contents were not increased.Figure 7Cholesterol content of the aorta.3-month-old mice were used for experiments of high fat feeding. Apo E−/− mice were fed high fat diet A for 8 weeks, and LDLR−/− mice were fed high fat diet B for 8 weeks. Aortas were prepared from the same animals that were used for the evaluation of atherosclerotic lesion sizes as shown in Fig. 6. Attached connective tissue and fat were removed from the aorta as much as possible. Lipids were extracted, and TC and FC content was measured. CE content was obtained by subtracting FC from TC.

Using purified proteins, we have performed a detailed analysis of the structure of complexin and of its interaction with SNARE proteins. NMR spectroscopy revealed that isolated complexins have no tertiary structure but contain an unusual α-helical middle domain of approximately 58 amino acids that overlaps with the most highly conserved region of the molecules. Complexins form a stable stoichiometric complex with the central domain of the ternary SNARE complex, whereas no binding was observed to monomeric SNAREs. Using a combination of limited proteolysis, deletion mutagenesis, and NMR spectroscopy, we found that the helical middle region of complexin is responsible for binding to the SNARE complex. Binding was highly sensitive to substitution of syntaxin 1 or synaptobrevin 2 with other SNARE homologs but less sensitive to substitution of SNAP-25. In addition, a stretch of 12 amino acids in the middle of the SNARE motif of syntaxin 1A was able to confer binding activity to the non-binding relative syntaxin 4. Furthermore, disassembly of ternary complexes is not affected by complexins. We conclude that complexins are specific ligands of the neuronal core complex that bind with a central α-helical domain, probably to the middle of the surface groove formed by synaptobrevin and syntaxin. Complexins may regulate the function of ternary complexes and control membrane fusion through this interaction.

Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). SNAREs comprise a family of proteins that is distinguished by the presence of the SNARE motif, a homologous stretch of approximately 60 amino acids that is usually localized adjacent to the membrane anchor domains (2.Weimbs T. Mostov K. Low S.H. Hofmann K. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 260-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 3.Fasshauer D. Sutton R.B. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Best characterized are SNARE proteins functioning in neuronal exocytosis. They include the synaptic vesicle protein synaptobrevin (also referred to as vesicle-associated membrane protein), and the synaptic plasma membrane proteins SNAP-25 and syntaxin 1. These proteins form a stable ternary complex, the core complex, that can be reversibly disassembled by the ATPase NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor) and additional cofactors termed SNAPs (for soluble NSF attachment proteins) (5.Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). Studies performed largely on recombinant proteins in solution have revealed a detailed picture of SNARE complex assembly. Of the monomeric SNAREs, only syntaxin 1 is partially α-helical, whereas both SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin are largely unstructured. Upon assembly, a dramatic increase in α-helical content is observed suggesting major conformational changes (6.Fasshauer D. Bruns D. Shen B. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4582-4590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 7.Fasshauer D. Otto H. Eliason W.K. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28036-28041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Interactions in the complex are largely confined to the SNARE motifs. X-ray crystallography revealed that the assembled core complex consists of an elongated bundle of four intertwined α-helices, each representing a single SNARE motif. Two of the helices are contributed by SNAP-25, and one each by syntaxin 1 and synaptobrevin (8.Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). The core complex is resistant to proteolysis and to denaturation by the detergent SDS (unless heated) (9.Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is unusually heat-stable and only denatures above 80 °C (10.Fasshauer D. Eliason W.K. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10354-10362Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These and other findings suggested that SNARE complex assembly is the essential step in initiating membrane fusion. According to this hypothesis, assembly of SNAREs localized on the two opposing membranes form a tight connection between the membranes. In the resulting “trans” complexes, the SNARE motifs are partially assembled in a helical bundle, while the transmembrane domains are anchored in the still separated membranes. The energy released during assembly may, at least partially, overcome the barrier separating the membranes destined to fuse. During fusion, the SNAREs relax into a complex in which all transmembrane domains are aligned in parallel (“cis” complex) and which then is re-energized by disassembly involving NSF and SNAPs (11.Hanson P.I. Heuser J.E. Jahn R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In search for molecules regulating the function of neuronal SNAREs, several proteins have been identified that bind specifically to individual SNAREs or to SNARE core complexes (4.Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Annn. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Among these are the complexins, two related proteins of approximately 15 kDa. Complexins, also named synaphins, were identified as polar and soluble proteins that are associated with the neuronal SNARE complex in membrane extracts (12.McMahon H.T. Missler M. Li C. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 111-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 13.Ishizuka T. Saisu H. Odani S. Abe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In vitro, complexins bind to assembled SNAREs and compete with α-SNAP for binding (12.McMahon H.T. Missler M. Li C. Südhof T.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 111-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), suggesting that they are involved in the regulation of the SNARE assembly-disassembly cycle. Both complexins are colocalized with neuronal SNAREs in presynaptic nerve terminals, although cytoplasmic pools are also present, particularly during early stages of neuronal maturation (15.Ono S. Baux G. Sekiguchi M. Fossier P. Morel N.F. Nihonmatsu I. Hirata K. Awaji T. Takahashi S. Takahashi M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 2143-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The precise function of the complexins remains to be elucidated. When the intracellular concentration of complexin was increased by microinjection or by overexpression, a moderate reduction of neurotransmitter release was observed. Injection of an anti-complexin antibody increased transmitter release, suggesting that complexins may function as negative regulators (15.Ono S. Baux G. Sekiguchi M. Fossier P. Morel N.F.

Disruption of the complexin II gene in mice resulted in viable mice with all parameters of synaptic transmission being normal except long term potentiation (17.Takahashi S. Ujihara H. Huang G.Z. Yagyu K. Sanbo M. Kaba H. Yagi T. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 2359-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, disruption of both complexin genes causes massive neurological dysfunctions, 2N. Brose, personal communication. 2N. Brose, personal communication. indicating that complexins are essential for synaptic function. Here we have used a combination of biochemical and biophysical approaches to learn more about complexins and their interactions with SNAREs. First, we have characterized the structure of complexins. Second, we have investigated which domains of complexins are involved in binding to the SNARE complex, which structural elements of the SNAREs participate in the interaction, and how complexins influence the assembly-disassembly reactions of the SNARE proteins. NSF and α-SNAP in pQE-9 plasmids (Qiagen) encoding for His6-tagged fusion proteins were kindly provided by S. Whiteheart and J. E. Rothman (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY). The recombinant protein fragments were derived from cDNAs encoding for rat synaptobrevin 2 and rat syntaxin 1A (kindly provided by R. H.

The sequences encoding rat complexins I and II (residues 1–134), respectively, were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pET-15b vector via NdeI and XhoI restriction sites resulting in fusion proteins carrying a thrombin-cleavable amino-terminal His6 tag. GST-complexin II deletion mutants (Fig. 7) were generated by PCR and subcloning into pGEX-KG vector via EcoRI andBamHI restriction sites with a thrombin-cleavable NH2-terminal GST tag. The correct sequence of all mutants was confirmed by DNA sequencing. SNAP-29 from rat (AF035822) was amplified by PCR using primers based on the published GS-32 sequence from rat (24.Wong S.H. Xu Y. Zhang T. Griffiths G. Lowe S.L. Subramaniam V.N. Seow K.T. Hong W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). cDNA from rat lung and kidney (Stratagene) was used as template. The PCR products were subcloned into pBS vector (Stratagene) and sequenced. All constructs derived from the two different tissues were identical (GenBankTM accession no. AF260577). However, comparison with the published GS-32 sequence revealed four nucleotide discrepancies (c109g, t−153ca, c162–, t194c) resulting in two amino acid exchanges (P37A, F65S) and two frameshifts resulting in three amino acid exchanges (G52R, P53A, S54E). Comparison of the rat sequence with human SNAP-29 (AF115436) and mouse expressed sequence tags (e.g. AA388177, AA270049, and AA388158) further suggests that the sequence determined here is accurate: Ala37corresponds to Ala in human SNAP-29, and Arg-Ala-Glu in positions 52–54 are identical to the corresponding residues in human SNAP-29 and in the mouse expressed sequence tags. The sequence encoding for full-length SNAP-29 from rat was subcloned into pGEX-KG viaBamHI and XhoI restriction sites, resulting in a GST fusion protein. Chimeras of rat syntaxins were generated using the overlapping primer method by Higuchi (25.Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar) and subcloned into pET-28a, resulting in the following chimeras (see Fig. 10): Syx 1/4, syntaxin 1A (1–213)/syntaxin 4 (222–233)/syntaxin 1A (226–262); and Syx 4/1, syntaxin 4-(1–221)/syntaxin 1A-(214–225)/syntaxin 4 (234–258). Sequencing of all DNAs revealed a difference from the published sequence of syntaxin 4 in a single amino acid (T216S) (26.Bennett M.K. Garcia-Arraras J.E. Elferink L.A. Peterson K. Fleming A.M. Hazuka C.D. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 863-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Human and mouse syntaxin 4 contain a serine in this position. Furthermore, Ser216 is conserved between rat syntaxins 1, 2, and 3, suggesting that this discrepancy is probably due to a sequencing error. All recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells according to standard protocols with the exception of GST-complexin I for NMR studies. For this purpose cells were grown at 37 °C in M9 minimal media with 4 g/liter glucose, 1 g/liter NH4Cl, 1 mm MgSO4, and 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Uniform15N and 13C labeling was achieved using15NH4Cl and [13C6]glucose (Isotec) as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively. Cells were induced at optical density 0.6 with 0.8 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. His6-tagged proteins were affinity-purified using Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) and GST fusion proteins by glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST-complexin II deletion mutants (Fig. 7) remained attached to glutathione-Sepharose. Usually the tags were cleaved by thrombin after elution from the beads. However, if used for precipitation in binding experiments (see below), tags remained attached to the proteins. Proteins containing transmembrane regions (synaptobrevin-(1–116) and syntaxin-(183–288)) were eluted from the matrix and dialyzed against standard buffer containing 1.5% sodium cholate. All other proteins were purified by ion exchange chromatography on Mono-Q or Mono-S columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) after elution from the affinity matrix. For NMR experiments, labeled complexin I without tag was buffer exchanged into 60 mm phosphate, 2 mm DTT, 0.5 mmEDTA, pH 6.1 (9:1 H2O/D2O). For binding experiments using 1H-15N HSQC spectra, syntaxin (residues 1–264 and 180–264) and the “midi core complex” (synaptobrevin (1–96), syntaxin (180–262), and SNAP-25 (1–206)) were dialyzed against the same buffer. All other purified proteins were dialyzed against standard buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA). All SNARE complexes were purified using Mono-Q column after overnight assembly of the purified monomers (10.Fasshauer D. Eliason W.K. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10354-10362Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 21.Fasshauer D. Antonin W. Margittai M. Pabst S. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15440-15446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). For technical reasons, constructs for syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25A derived from different expression vectors were used to assemble ternary complexes: syntaxin (1–262, pET-28a), SNAP-25 (pET-28a) (Fig. 4 A); syntaxin (1–265, pGEX-2T), SNAP-25 (pHO-2d) (Fig. 4 B); syntaxin (1–265, pHO-2c), SNAP-25 (pHO-2d) (Fig. 5). No differences in structural and binding properties were observed. In addition, since it was not possible to separate the GST moiety from the thrombin cleaved GST-SNAP-29 fusion protein, GST-SNAP-29 was used to assemble the mixed complex containing SNAP-29. The minimal core complex consists of synaptobrevin (1–96), syntaxin (180–262), SNAP-25 (1–83), and SNAP-25 (120–206) (10.Fasshauer D. Eliason W.K. Brunger A.T. Jahn R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10354-10362Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Minimal core complex with bound complexin was assembled in excess amounts of complexin II and purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 HiLoad 16/60 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Figure 5Complexin forms a 1:1 complex with the ternary SNARE complex and with its minimal core. The various complexes were separated by nondenaturing PAGE from each other and from free complexin. Increasing amounts of complexin II (concentrations as indicated) were added to a constant amount of ternary complex (A) or of the minimal core complex (B) and incubated in standard buffer at 4 °C overnight or at room temperature for 1 h, respectively. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining.

Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). All NMR spectra were acquired at 25 °C on a Varian Unity 500 spectrometer, except the1H-15N HSQC spectra used in the binding experiments of complexin to the midi core complex, which were acquired on a Varian INOVA 600 spectrometer. 1H-15N HSQC experiments were acquired using spectral widths of 7600 and 2000 Hz in the 1H and 15N dimensions, respectively. Data sets consisted of 2 × 100 FIDs of 768 complex points each and were zero filled to yield matrices of 512 × 512 real points after Fourier transformation and removal of the aliphatic part of the spectrum. The numer of transients per FID was adjusted to yield total acquisition times of 0.5–36 h, depending on the protein concentration. Sequential assignments were obtained from a series of three-dimensional pulse field gradient-enhanced 15N-edited and triple resonance experiments using 15N-labeled (1 mm) and 15N,13C-labeled (0.5 mm) complexin samples, respectively. All experiments incorporate water flip-back pulses and sensitivity enhancement in the 15N dimension whenever amide proton resonances are observed in the F3 dimension (28.Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 2055-2057Crossref Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 29.Kay L.E. Guang Yi X. Yamazaki T. J. Magn. Res. Ser. A. 1994; 109: 129-133Crossref Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 30.Zhang O. Kay L.E.

The spectral widths and number of complex points in the F3, F2, and F1 dimensions, with the number of scans per FID and the total measurement time, indicated in parentheses, were:1H-15N TOCSY-HSQC, 6800 × 1070 × 4500 Hz, 512 × 42 × 124 (8 scans, 50 h);1H-15N NOESY-HSQC, 6800 × 1070 × 4500 Hz, 512 × 40 × 124 (8 scans, 53 h); HNCO, 7600 × 1070 × 1620 Hz, 512 × 26 × 80 (8 scans, 18 h); HNCACB, 7600 × 1070 × 7650 Hz, 512 × 26 × 32 (48 scans, 46 h); (H)C(CO)NH-TOCSY, 7600 × 1070 × 7650 Hz, 512 × 26 × 60 (16 scans, 32 h); (H)CBCACO(CA)HA, 4000 × 1620 × 7650 Hz, 256 × 64 × 54 (16 scans, 61 h). The mixing times were 45 ms, 120 ms and 18 ms for the TOCSY-HSQC, NOESY-HSQC, and (H)C(CO)NH-TOCSY experiments, respectively. Linear prediction was used to double the number of points in the F2 dimension of all spectra. After zero filling, Fourier transformation, and removal of the aliphatic half of the F3 dimension for all spectra except (H)CBCACO(CA)HA, matrices of 512 × 128 × 256 points were obtained. For the binding assays, purified recombinant proteins or preformed SNARE complexes were used that carried either a His6 tag or a GST tag, or were unmodified. In some experiments, rat brain cytosol (obtained by subjecting a homogenate, generated in 4 mmHepes-NaOH, pH 7.3, 320 mm sucrose, to centrifugation at 12,000 × g av (Fig. 4 B) or 90,000 × g av (Fig. 9 C)) was used as a source of native complexins. Unless indicated otherwise, binding experiments were carried out in incubation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmDTT, and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100). The incubation buffer was complemented with either 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 1 mm EDTA (GST fusion proteins) or 20 mmimidazole (His6 fusion proteins). Incubations were performed between 1 and 1.5 h at room temperature on a rotator. For immunoprecipitations, anti-synaptobrevin antibody (Cl 69.1; Ref.31.Edelmann L. Hanson P.I. Chapman E.R. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) was then added for 1 h at 4 °C. Complexes were isolated by affinity adsorption, using glutathione-Sepharose beads, Ni2+-NTA-agarose, or Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for GST fusion proteins, His6 fusion proteins, and immunoprecipitations, respectively. Bead incubation was usually approximately 1 h. The beads were then washed four or five times in incubation buffer, except that Triton X-100 and bovine serum albumin were omitted and imidazole was lowered to 8 mm. Beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Where indicated, complexins were detected by immunoblotting using polyclonal antibody 942 (Synaptic Systems, Göttingen, Germany; 1:2000) against the COOH terminus of complexin I and II (amino acid residues 122–134, rat sequence) and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, NEN Life Science Products) on a Fujifilm LAS-1000 system. Proteoliposomes with reconstituted full-length synaptobrevin or ternary complex with transmembrane regions were prepared as previously described (20.Margittai M. Otto H. Jahn R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Liposomes adjusted to 0.4 μm each of synaptobrevin 2 and ternary complex, respectively, were each incubated with 0.8 μm complexin I or II or both for 1 h at room temperature in standard buffer. Liposomes were then immunoisolated by incubating in monoclonal antibody Cl 69.1 (5 μl of ascites) for 1 h at room temperature on a rotator, followed addition of Protein A-Sepharose and an additional incubation for 1 h. After sedimentation and removal of the supernatant containing unbound material, the beads were washed four times with 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100-containing standard buffer. Fifty percent of the Sepharose-bound material were analyzed by immunoblot using antibody 942. For limited proteolysis, purified complexes (8 μm) were incubated in 1% (w/w) proteinase K at 25 °C in standard buffer. At the indicated times, proteolysis was stopped by adding sample buffer without SDS containing 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and chilling on ice. All samples were analyzed by nondenaturing PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Masses of the complexin II-fragments obtained by limited proteolysis were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (Perseptive). For NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing, 1–4 μg of complexin fragment were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by blotting and sequenced by a Protein Sequencer 810 (Knauer). Multi-angle laser light scattering (MALLS) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy were performed as described earlier (21.Fasshauer D. Antonin W. Margittai M. Pabst S. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15440-15446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out as described (32.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). SDS sample buffer (final concentrations: 62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 3% SDS, 10% glycerol, 3.3% β-mercaptoethanol) was added, and samples were incubated at room temperature (not heated) or 95 °C (heated) for 5 min before separation on 15% polyacrylamide gels. Nondenaturing gels were prepared and run as described (7.Fasshauer D. Otto H. Eliason W.K. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28036-28041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, two isoforms of complexin were described that differ only by a few amino acid substitutions and a very high degree of homology was found between distant vertebrate species. Since functionally important domains are usually more highly conserved than flanking regions, we performed data base searches to identify invertebrate orthologs of complexins, and to compare them with the vertebrate sequences. As shown in Fig.1, sequences probably representing complexins were found both in Drosophila melanogaster(full-length) and Caenorhabditis elegans (partial). Sequence alignments revealed a high degree of overall homology between vertebrates and invertebrates, which, however, is still significantly lower than among vertebrates. The highest degree of conservation was detected in a region at the middle of the sequence spanning approximately residues 34–77 (numbering according to the rat sequence). The structure of purified recombinant rat complexin I in solution was analyzed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) spectrum of complexin (Fig.2) exhibits a poor dispersion of1H chemical shifts that suggests a lack of tertiary structure. In contrast, the CD spectrum of complexin contains a double minimum at 206 and 222 nm (data not shown), and is characteristic for a mixture of α-helical and random coil conformations. To locate the α-helical region, we used multidimensional NMR techniques. The severe overlap of the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum hindered assignment of the complexin 1H, 15N, and13C resonances. A combination of triple resonance spectra and three-dimensional 15N-edited TOCSY-HSQC and NOESY-HSQC experiments allowed us to obtain nearly complete (97.1%) sequential assignments (Fig. 2).

Dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP)-stimulated MA-10 Leydig cells were treated with AA and/or the phospholipase A2 inhibitor, dexamethasone. Dexamethasone significantly reduced Bt2cAMP-stimulated progesterone production, StAR promoter activity, StAR mRNA, and StAR protein. The inhibitory effects of dexamethasone were reversed by the addition of 150 μm AA to MA-10 cells. In addition, MA-10 cells were treated with the lipoxygenase inhibitor, nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, AA861, the epoxygenase inhibitor, miconazole, and the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin. Both NDGA and AA861 inhibited progesterone production and StAR protein expression. AA861-inhibited progesterone synthesis and StAR protein were partially reversed by addition of the 5- lipoxygenase metabolite, 5(S)-hydroperoxy-(6E,8Z,11Z,14Z)-eicosatetraenoic acid. Inhibition of epoxygenase activity inhibited progesterone production significantly, but StAR protein was only slightly reduced. Indomethacin enhanced StAR protein expression and significantly increased progesterone production. Inhibition of AA release or lipoxygenase activities did not affect protein kinase A activity, whereas inhibition of protein kinase A activity using H89 reduced Bt2cAMP-induced StAR protein. AA alone did not induce StAR protein expression nor steroid production. These results demonstrate the essential role of AA in steroid biosynthesis and StAR gene transcription and suggest the possible involvement of the lipoxygenase pathway in steroidogenesis. This study further indicates that AA and cAMP transduce signals from trophic hormone receptors to the nucleus through two separate pathways and act to co-regulate steroid production and StAR gene expression and indicates that both pathways are required for trophic hormone-stimulated steroidogenesis.

Wells J. King S.R. Stocco D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28314-28322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Lin D. Sugawara T. Strauss III, J.F. Clark B.J. Stocco D.M. Saenger P. Rogol A.

Weiss A.M. Orly J. Stocco D.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3903-3912Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). However, the manner in which trophic hormones regulate StAR gene expression is not entirely clear. It is generally accepted that trophic hormones, such as luteinizing hormone (LH) or adrenal corticotrophic hormone stimulate cyclic AMP (cAMP) formation followed by activation of protein kinase A (PKA) which in turn phosphorylates known transcription factors and possibly additional unknown factors which regulate StAR gene transcription (5.Reinhart A.J. Williams S.C. Stocco D.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, it is also known that trophic hormones induce arachidonic acid (AA) release in steroidogenic cells and that this release is a requisite for steroid biosynthesis. Following LH stimulation, AA was released within 1 min in rat testicular Leydig cells (6.Cooke B.A. Dirami G. Chaudry L. Choi M.S.K. Abayasekara D.R.E. Phipp L. J. Steroid. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Also, AA release occurred in a dose- and time-dependent manner in human chorionic gonadotrophin-stimulated Leydig cells, with the amount of AA released being dependent on hormone-receptor interaction and the concentration of LH/human chorionic gonadotrophin-binding sites on the cell surface (7.Moraga P.F. Llanos M.N. Ronco A.M. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 154: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recently, an adrenal corticotrophic hormone-induced 43-kDa protein, named arachidonic acid-related thioesterase involved in steroidogenesis (ARTISt), was identified and cloned from rat adrenal cells. ARTISt demonstrated the highest substrate specificity when assayed with arachidonyl-CoA and was reported to play a role in steroid synthesis by regulating AA release from arachidonyl-CoA (8.Finkielstein C. Maloberti P. Mendez C.F. Paz C. Cornejo Maciel F. Cymeryng C. Neuman I. Dada L. Mele P.G. Solano A. Podesta J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The role of AA in trophic hormone-stimulated steroid production in various steroidogenic cells has been well documented over the last 20 years (9.Abayasekara D.R.E. Band A.M. Cooke B.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1990; 70: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 10.Romanelli F. Valenca M. Conte D. Isidori A. Negro-Vilar A. J. Endocrinol.

Van der Kraak G. Gen. Comp. Endocrinol. 1996; 102: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); however, the mechanism responsible for the role of AA remains unknown. Since previous studies suggested that AA and its metabolites act at the rate-limiting step of steroid biosynthesis, cholesterol transfer to the inner mitochondrial membrane (14.Lopez-Ruiz M.P. Choi M.S.K. Rose M.P. West A.P. Cooke B.A. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1122-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 15.Mele P.G. Dada L.A. Paz C. Neuman I. Cymeryng C.B. Mendez C.F. Finkielstein C.V. Maciel F.C. Podesta E.J. Endocr. Res. 1997; 23: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the StAR protein might be involved in the role of AA in the regulation of steroidogenesis. This hypothesis was proven correct by our recent studies, which indicated that AA release is essential for StAR protein expression (16.Wang X.J. Walsh L.P. Stocco D.M. Endocrine. 1999; 10: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Inhibition of AA release inhibited LH- or dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP)-induced progesterone production and StAR protein expression in MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells (16.Wang X.J. Walsh L.P. Stocco D.M. Endocrine. 1999; 10: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Importantly, the inhibitory effects were reversed by the addition of AA into the cell culture with progesterone synthesis and StAR protein being increased as AA in the culture medium was increased. These studies suggest that AA regulated steroid hormone production through its regulation of StAR protein expression. However, the manner in which AA regulates StAR protein expression is not clear. Also, the relationship between AA and cAMP in steroid production and StAR protein expression is unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that AA regulates StAR gene expression at the level of transcription and that the AA-mediated signal transduction pathway is different from the reported cAMP-PKA-phosphorylation pathway. We also once again demonstrate that both pathways are required for trophic hormone-stimulated steroid production and StAR gene expression. Arachidonic acid, dexamethasone, nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), AA861, 5(S)-hydroperoxy-(6E,8Z,11Z,14Z)-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE), miconazole, indomethacin, Bt2cAMP, and bovine serum albumin were purchased from Sigma. H89 was obtained from Calbiochem. Waymouth's MB/752 medium, horse serum, trypsin-EDTA, antibiotics, and PBS were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Rabbit antisera generated against a StAR fusion protein was a generous gift from Dr. D. B. Hales (Dept. of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Illinois, Chicago). Donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [32P]dCTP and [γ-32P]dATP were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Prime-It II kit for 32P labeling was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Other common chemicals used in these studies were obtained from either Sigma or Fisher. The MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells were a generous gift from Dr. Mario Ascoli (Dept. of Pharmacology, University of Iowa, College of Medicine, Iowa City) and were grown in 100-mm tissue culture dishes in Waymouth's MB/752 medium containing 15% horse serum as described previously (17.Ascoli M. Endocrinology. 1981; 108: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in incubators at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Before each experiment, the medium was replaced with serum-free Waymouth's medium. MA-10 cells were cultured for 30 min in serum-free Waymouth's medium containing AA, and/or its metabolic inhibitors (as described in the figure legends), and then stimulated with 0.5 mm Bt2cAMP for 6 h. The medium was collected at the end of each experiment and stored at −80 °C. The cells were washed with cold PBS and stored at −80 °C. Progesterone concentrations in the medium were determined by RIA (18.Resko J.A. Norman R.L. Niswender G, D. Spies H.G. Endocrinology. 1974; 94: 128-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). MA-10 cells (0.5 × 106 per well) were cultured in 6-well plates overnight. The cells were transfected with 12 μg of DNA of the StAR promoter/luciferase plasmid expressing firefly luciferase driven by the −966-bp sequence of the StAR promoter (19.Caron K.M. Ikeda Y. Soo S.C. Stocco D.M. Parker K.L. Clark B.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 138-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Transfections also included 75 ng of the pRL-SV40 vector DNA (a plasmid which constitutively expresses Renilla luciferase, a control reporter under the control of the SV40 promoter, Promega, Madison, WI). Transfections were performed using SuperFect Transfection Reagent, (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), following the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h in culture the cells were used for experiments. Following experiments, the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and 300 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) was added to each well. The cells were scraped into a tube and centrifuged for 30 s at 14,000 ×g at 4 °C. The supernatants were used for luciferase assays using a Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System following the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). The relative light units (expressed as the reading from the StAR promoter/luciferase divided by the reading from Renilla luciferase) were measured using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). Protein kinase A (PKA) activity was measured using the SignaTECTTMcAMP-dependent Protein Kinase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI). This assay measures the transfer of 32P to the biotinylated PKA peptide substrate, Kemptide (LRRASLG). Following treatment, cells were collected in extraction buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm mercaptoethanol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin), homogenized at 1000 rpm for 25 passes using a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer fitted with a Teflon pestle, and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was used for both the PKA assay and protein measurement by the Bradford method (20.Braford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Approximately 3 μg of protein was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mmMgCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm biotinylated Kemptide, 0.1 mm ATP and 0.02 μCi/μl [γ-32P]dATP (specific activity, 3000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products). Reactions were stopped by the addition of 7.5m guanidine HCl. Ten microliters of the reaction mix were spotted onto a streptavidin-coated membrane that specifically binds biotinylated Kemptide. Unincorporated [γ-32P]dATP was then removed by extensive washing. The incorporation of 32P into biotinylated Kemptide bound to the membrane was determined by liquid scintillation counting. PKA activity was expressed as picomoles of 32P incorporated per min/mg of protein. Cells were washed three times with cold PBS and used for total RNA purification using TRIzol reagent following the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). The RNA was separated by electrophoresis in an agarose-formaldehyde gel (1:6%) and blotted onto a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). StAR mRNA on the membrane was probed with32P-labeled mouse StAR cDNA. Autoradiography was performed using Hyperfilm (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was stripped with a buffer containing 15 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm sodium citrate, and 1% SDS, pH 7.0, for 30 min at 55 °C, and 18 S rRNA on the membrane was probed to adjust for the RNA loading in each lane. StAR protein expression in MA-10 cells was detected by Western blot analysis as described previously (21.Townson D.H. Wang X. Keyes P.L. Kostyo J.L. Stocco D.M. Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 868-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Western analysis experiments were performed at least three times, and the results of one representative experiment is shown. Each experiment was repeated at least three times. Statistical analysis of the data was performed with analysis of variance using Stat View SE system (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). To determine the effects of AA release on StAR protein expression and steroid hormone production, Bt2cAMP-stimulated MA-10 mouse Leydig cells were treated with the PLA2 inhibitor, dexamethasone, which inhibits AA release from phospholipids. As shown in Fig.1, increasing levels of dexamethasone from 0 to 1.0 μm resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in StAR protein expression and a concomitant decrease in progesterone production. To test if dexamethasone could also act by inhibiting the activities of P450scc and/or 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, 25 μm 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol was added to each treatment. There was no significant difference in progesterone production among the treatments when 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol was added to the culture medium. In order to confirm that the inhibitory effects of dexamethasone were due to the inhibition of AA release, 150 μm AA was added to the Bt2cAMP-stimulated MA-10 cells treated with 1.0 μm dexamethasone. Whereas Bt2cAMP-stimulated StAR protein expression and steroid production were significantly inhibited by dexamethasone (p < 0.01), addition of AA into the culture medium reversed the inhibitory effects (Fig.2). AA in the absence of Bt2cAMP did not increase either StAR protein or progesterone production significantly.Figure 2Arachidonic acid reversal of the inhibitory effects of the PLA2 inhibitor, dexamethasone, on Bt2cAMP-stimulated StAR protein expression and progesterone production in MA-10 Leydig cells.

Two major bands of StAR mRNA of 1.6 and 3.4 kilobase pairs were detected and are shown in Fig. 3 A. Addition of 0 to 1.0 μm dexamethasone to the MA-10 cells reduced Bt2cAMP-induced StAR mRNA in a dose-dependent manner. The observation of the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on StAR transcription was enhanced when StAR promoter activities were examined using Bt2cAMP-stimulated MA-10 cells incubated in medium containing increasing levels of dexamethasone. Similar to the reduction in StAR mRNA, StAR promoter activities decreased as the dosage of dexamethasone increased (Fig.3 B). The reduction of StAR mRNA was reversed by the addition of AA to the cells (Fig.4 A). Although 1.0 μm dexamethasone significantly reduced Bt2cAMP-stimulated StAR mRNA (p < 0.01), 150 μm AA significantly reversed this inhibition (p < 0.01). A similar reversal was observed in dexamethasone-inhibited StAR promoter activity (Fig. 4 B). Importantly, AA alone did not increase StAR mRNA and slightly, but not significantly, increased StAR promoter activity.Figure 4Arachidonic acid reversal of the inhibitory effects of the PLA2 inhibitor, dexamethasone, on Bt2cAMP-stimulated StAR mRNA and StAR promoter activity in MA-10 Leydig cells.

Cells were collected for total RNA purification. StAR mRNA was analyzed by Northern blot, and StAR-specific bands were quantitated using the BioImage Visage 2000 and expressed as total integrated optical density (IOD).B, cells were transfected with a StAR promoter/luciferase plasmid expressing firefly luciferase driven by −966 bp of the StAR promoter and pRL-SV40 vector DNA, a plasmid which constitutively expresses Renilla luciferase. After 48 h culture, the cells were treated as described above. The cell lysate was used for the luciferase assay using a Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI). The relative light units (expressed as the reading from StAR promoter/luciferase divided by the reading fromRenilla luciferase) were measured using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA). **, highly significantly different from Bt2cAMP (dbcAMP) stimulation or from arachidonic acid reversal (p < 0.01).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to examine which metabolic pathway of AA might be involved in StAR protein expression, Bt2cAMP-stimulated MA-10 cells were treated with the lipoxygenase inhibitors NDGA or AA861, the epoxygenase inhibitor miconazole, and the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin, respectively. StAR protein levels and progesterone production were determined. As shown in Fig. 5, both NDGA and AA861 inhibited both StAR protein expression and progesterone production (p < 0.01). Miconazole slightly inhibited StAR protein expression but significantly inhibited progesterone production (p < 0.01). Indomethacin caused an increase in StAR protein and also resulted in a significant increase in progesterone production (p < 0.01). Based on these results, we continued the studies on the lipoxygenase pathway. AA861-treated MA-10 cells were incubated in a medium containing 1.5 μm 5-HPETE, a metabolite of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway. The results are shown in Fig. 6. Addition of 5-HPETE to the cell cultures partially reversed AA861-inhibited StAR protein and also partially reversed the inhibition in progesterone production (p < 0.01).Figure 65-HPETE reversal of the inhibitory effects of the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, AA861, on Bt2cAMP-stimulated StAR protein expression and progesterone production in MA-10 Leydig cells.

PKA activities and StAR protein expression were determined and are shown in Fig.7. Stimulation with Bt2cAMP increased PKA activity by 20-fold over control. 30 μm H89 significantly inhibited PKA activity (p < 0.01) and also inhibited StAR protein expression. Addition of 150 μm AA to the H89-treated cells did not reverse the PKA activity or StAR protein. AA alone had no effect on PKA activity. Inhibition of AA release by dexamethasone or its metabolism by NDGA inhibited StAR protein expression but did not inhibit PKA activity. There was no significant difference in PKA activities among the groups treated with Bt2cAMP alone, Bt2cAMP + dexamethasone, and Bt2cAMP + NDGA. Arachidonic acid is well known as a component of phospholipids in cell membranes, and cytosolic free AA is mainly generated through the activation of PLA2 that catalyzes its release from phospholipids (22.Van Den Bosch H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 604: 191-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar, 23.Lapetina E.J. Billah M.M. Cuatracasas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5037-5041Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Metabolism of the released AA through one of the three enzyme systems, namely the lipoxygenase, the cyclooxygenase, or the cytochrome P450-dependent epoxygenase pathways, produces various metabolites (24.Neddleman P. Turk J. Jakschik B.A. Morrison A.R. Lefkowith J.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 69-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Willis A.L. Smith D.L. Cunningham F.M. The Handbook of Immunopharmacology Series: Lipid Mediators. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1994: 1-30Google Scholar). In recent years, the regulatory effects of AA and its metabolites on steroid hormone biosynthesis have been demonstrated (26.Band V. Kharbanda S.M. Murugesan K. Farooq A. Prostaglandins. 1986; 31: 509-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 27.Mikami K. Omura M. Tamura Y. Yoshida S. J.

J. 1984; 219: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), but the mechanisms for the effects of AA are not clear. The results of the present study indicate that AA release is essential for steroid production and StAR protein expression. Inhibition of AA release by the PLA2 inhibitor, dexamethasone, reduced Bt2cAMP-stimulated StAR protein to a remarkably low level. As StAR protein decreased, progesterone production was concomitantly decreased (p < 0.01). The inhibitory effect of dexamethasone was clearly not due to an inhibitory effect on the activities of the P450scc and/or 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymes. There was no significant difference in steroid production in any of the treatments when 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol was added to the MA-10 cell cultures, indicating that these enzymes were unaffected by dexamethasone. The necessity for AA release in steroidogenesis was further demonstrated when the inhibitory effects of dexamethasone were reversed by addition of exogenous AA to the cell cultures, with steroid production and StAR protein expression being increased. We have previously reported the regulatory effects of AA on LH- or Bt2cAMP-stimulated steroid production and StAR protein expression using quinacrine as a PLA2 inhibitor (16.Wang X.J. Walsh L.P. Stocco D.M. Endocrine. 1999; 10: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Dexamethasone, which is used in the present study, inhibits PLA2 activity through a mechanism different from that of the effects of quinacrine (29.Flower R.J. Weissmann G. Advances in Inflammation Research. 8. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1984: 1-33Google Scholar, 30.Chang J. Musser J.H. McGregor H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 2429-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). However, the results from these two inhibitors were essentially identical and thus corroborated our earlier observations. Since StAR protein was demonstrated to play a critical role in cholesterol transfer to the mitochondrial inner membrane (1.Clark B.J. Wells J. King S.R. Stocco D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28314-28322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Lin D. Sugawara T. Strauss III, J.F. Clark B.J. Stocco D.M. Saenger P. Rogol A. Miller W.L.

Orly J. Stocco D.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3903-3912Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), these results are in agreement with the earlier experiments that suggested that AA regulates steroidogenesis at the rate-limiting step of mitochondrial cholesterol transfer (14.Lopez-Ruiz M.P. Choi M.S.K. Rose M.P. West A.P. Cooke B.A. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 1122-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 15.Mele P.G. Dada L.A. Paz C. Neuman I. Cymeryng C.B. Mendez C.F. Finkielstein C.V. Maciel F.C. Podesta E.J. Endocr. Res. 1997; 23: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The manner in which AA regulates StAR protein expression is currently unknown. The present study demonstrated that this fatty acid regulates StAR gene transcription. Whereas Bt2cAMP stimulation induced StAR mRNA synthesis, inhibition of AA release by dexamethasone reduced Bt2cAMP-stimulated StAR mRNA expression. Importantly, the reduction in StAR mRNA was restored by co-incubation of dexamethasone-treated MA-10 cells with 150 μm exogenous AA. AA regulation of StAR gene transcription was further demonstrated by utilizing a StAR promoter activity assay which showed that inhibition of AA release by dexamethasone resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in Bt2cAMP-stimulated StAR promoter activity. The inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on promoter activity was also reversed by the addition of AA to the culture medium clearly indicating that AA release is essential for StAR promoter activity. The specific details concerning the AA regulation of StAR gene transcription is currently under investigation in our laboratory. It is possible that AA or its metabolites might regulate transcription factors controlling StAR promoter activity. As mentioned earlier, after AA is released, it is metabolized mainly through three pathways. Our results suggested that among the three, the lipoxygenase pathway may be involved in steroid production and StAR protein expression. Blocking AA metabolism through this pathway by using the inhibitor NDGA greatly decreased Bt2cAMP-induced StAR protein expression and reduced progesterone production significantly (p < 0.01). Although the specificity of NDGA might be questionable, similar results were also obtained when the more specific 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, AA861, was used. Moreover, the inhibitory effects of AA861 were reversed when the 5-lipoxygenase metabolite of AA, 5-HPETE, was added to the culture suggesting a possible involvement of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway in steroidogenesis and StAR protein expression. The roles of the lipoxygenase metabolites in steroid production were previously demonstrated (31.Hirai A. Tahara K. Tamura Y. Saito H. Terano T. Yoshida S. Prostaglandins. 1985; 30: 749-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 32.Solano A.R. Dada L. Podesta E.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1988; 1: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 33.Sullivan M.H.F. Cooke B.A. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and are essentially in agreement with the results obtained in this study. Besides 5-HPETE, the effects of other lipoxygenase metabolites, such as 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and 15-HPETE, in steroid biosynthesis were described (34.Natarajan R. Dunn W.D. Stern N. Nadler J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1990; 72: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 35.Nishikawa T. Omura M. Noda M. Yoshida S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to determine if they are involved in StAR protein expression. Stimulatory effects of epoxygenase metabolites on steroidogenesis were reported previously (36.Nishimura M. Hirai A. Omura M. Tamura Y. Yoahida S. Prostaglandins. 1986; 38: 413-430Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 37.Van Voorhis B.J. Dunn M.S. Falck J.R. Bhatt R.K. VanRollins M. Snyder G.D. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1993; 76: 1555-1559PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, inhibition of AA metabolism through this pathway inhibited progesterone production significantly (p < 0.01); however, StAR protein expression was only slightly inhibited. The reasons for this apparent discrepancy are not clear at this time but perhaps the absence of epoxygenase pathway metabolites interfered with another required component or event in supporting steroidogenesis. Blocking the cyclooxygenase pathway using indomethacin resulted in an increase in Bt2cAMP-stimulated StAR protein expression and also in a significant increase in progesterone production in MA-10 cells (p < 0.01). The reason for the indomethacin-induced increase of StAR protein is unknown. One of the cyclooxygenase metabolites, prostaglandin F2α was reported to be able to induce a rapid decline in StAR protein expression (38.Fiedler E.P. Plouffe Jr., L. Hales D.B. Hales K.H. Khan I. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It is possible that the inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity reduced the production of inhibitory metabolites, resulting in an increase in StAR protein expression. Alternatively, perhaps after blocking the cyclooxygenase pathway more AA was available to produce lipoxygenase metabolites that enhanced StAR protein expression. The mechanism responsible for the actions of AA and its metabolites on StAR gene expression and steroid production probably involves the signal transduction pathway from trophic hormone receptors to the nucleus (39.Wang X.J. Stocco D.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 158: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 40.Cooke B.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The role of the cAMP-PKA-phosphorylation pathway is well known in trophic hormone stimulation and is important in StAR gene expression (5.Reinhart A.J. Williams S.C. Stocco D.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, results obtained earlier and those provided in this study indicate that the PKA pathway is not sufficient to transduce all the signals from the trophic hormone receptor to the nucleus in order to accomplish the physiological functions of hormone stimulation. As shown in Fig. 7, inhibition of either AA release or lipoxygenase activity did not affect Bt2cAMP-induced PKA activities, but this high level of PKA activity was unable to induce StAR protein expression, suggesting that PKA phosphorylation alone does not represent the entire signal pathway involved in steroid biosynthesis. Reversal of StAR protein expression and steroid production by addition of AA indicated that the blocked pathway is an AA-mediated pathway. Although PKA activity remained at a high level, inhibition of AA release reduced the Bt2cAMP-stimulated StAR promoter activity, StAR mRNA, StAR protein, and steroid production (Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). On the other hand, inhibition of the PKA activity using H89 also inhibited StAR protein expression, but addition of AA did not reverse the H89-reduction in StAR protein. Also, whereas exogenous AA reversed the PLA2 inhibitor-reduced StAR promoter activity, StAR mRNA, StAR protein, and steroid production, in the absence of an elevated PKA activity (resulting from an increase in cAMP), AA alone did not have a significant effect on StAR gene expression. These results indicated that 1) AA transduces signals from trophic hormones and cAMP to the nucleus through a pathway different from the cAMP-PKA-phosphorylation pathway, and 2) both pathways are essential with neither pathway alone being sufficient for trophic hormone-induced steroid production and StAR gene expression. Collectively, the results shown here demonstrate the critical role of arachidonic acid in the transcriptional regulation of StAR gene expression and steroid production and suggest a possible involvement of the lipoxygenase pathway in steroidogenesis. These studies further suggest a new concept in signal transduction in cAMP-dependent steroidogenesis, in which trophic hormones not only induce cAMP formation but also AA release, and then these second messenger systems transduce signals to the nucleus through two separate pathways to co-regulate StAR gene expression and steroid production."

Furthermore, uPAR initiates cell signaling responses (7.Besser D. Verde P. Nagamine Y. Blasi F. Fibrinolysis. 1996; 10: 215-237Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These activities are particularly intriguing because uPAR is linked to the cell surface only by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (8.Ploug M. Rønne E. Behrendt N. Jensen A.L. Blasi F. Dano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1926-1933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor may be critical for uPAR function, in that it affects interaction with other plasma membrane proteins and allows for proper compartmentalization of uPAR within plasma membrane microdomains (5.Wei Y.

The proteolytic activity of uPA is not necessary for this response because the amino-terminal fragment of uPA, which lacks the serine proteinase domains, also activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and promotes cellular migration (10.Nguyen D.H.D.

Yang X. Liu Q.P. Wilkins J.A. Chapman H.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Other potential uPAR-adaptor proteins, which may function independently of integrins, include the cytokine receptor, gp130, and G protein-coupled receptors (21.Kolshenick Y. Ehart M. Hufnagl P.

Blood. 1999; 94: 649-662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the principal function of uPA may be to alter the conformation of uPAR so that uPAR associates with critical adaptor proteins in the plasma membrane (22.Fazioli F. Resnati M. Sidenius N. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7279-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 23.Degryse B. Resnati M. Rabbani S.A. Villa A. Fazioli F. Blasi F.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7279-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) demonstrated that peptides derived from the linker region between the first and second domains of uPAR, which contain the sequence SRSRY, activate the Src family tyrosine kinase, p56/p59hck, and demonstrate chemotactic activity, similarly to uPA.If uPAR ligation initiates cell signaling through integrins, then similar intracellular enzymes and adaptor proteins should function in both responses. It is well established that integrin ligation causes ERK activation (25.Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Lin T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol.

The responsible pathway may involve FAK, which binds to integrin β-chains, undergoes autophosphorylation at Tyr-397, and recruits c-Src or other Src family tyrosine kinases (27.Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D.

Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1385-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). c-Src and FAK may also phosphorylate Shc, which serves as an adaptor protein, recruiting Grb2 (33.Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13189-13195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 34.Schlaepfer D.D. Jones D.C. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2571-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Furthermore, integrin clustering may cause ERK activation by FAK-independent pathways (35.Lin T.H. Aplin A.E. Shin Y. Chen Q. Schaller M. Romer L. Aukhil I. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1385-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). For example, it has been shown that caveolin bridges integrin α-chains to Fyn and Shc, which results in the recruitment of Grb2 and activation of the Ras-ERK pathway (36.Wary K.K. Mariotti A. Zurzolo C. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1998; 94: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar).The goal of the present investigation was to characterize the pathway, upstream of Ras, by which uPAR ligation leads to ERK activation and stimulation of MCF-7 cell migration. Our results demonstrate for the first time that soluble uPAR and a uPAR-derived peptide that contains the sequence SRSRY promote MCF-7 cell migration by a pathway that requires ERK activation. The uPAR-initiated pathway requires FAK, c-Src, and Shc, which have also been implicated in integrin-mediated ERK activation. The involvement of these factors suggested a role for Grb2/Sos complex. Therefore, we performed experiments demonstrating that uPA causes Sos to associate with Shc, presumably through Grb2. Association of Sos with Shc was highly transient, providing an explanation for the transient nature of ERK phosphorylation in uPA-stimulated cells.DISCUSSIONCellular migration requires orchestration of diverse biochemical processes that may be controlled by different cell signaling pathways (46.Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3254) Google Scholar). In MCF-7 and HT 1080 cells, uPA promotes cellular migration by activating the Ras-ERK pathway (10.Nguyen D.H.D. Hussaini I.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8502-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 11.Nguyen D.H.D. Catling A.D. Webb D.J. Sankovic M. Walker L.A. Somlyo A.V. Weber M.J. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The same pathway is also important in promoting cellular migration in response to growth factors and integrin ligation, based on its ability to alter integrin activation states (47.Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), promote focal adhesion disassembly (48.Xie H. Paler M.A. Gupta K. Chang P. Ware M.F. Witke W. Kwitkowski D.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Wells A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 615-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and activate myosin light chain kinase (11.Nguyen D.H.D. Catling A.D. Webb D.J. Sankovic M. Walker L.A. Somlyo A.V. Weber M.J. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 49.Klemke R.L. Cai S. Giannini A.L.

Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1107-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). These activities may be most important for uropod retraction. Similar activities have been attributed to signaling proteins that function upstream of ERK. For example, c-Src weakens interactions between αVβ3 and the cytoskeleton in focal adhesions (51.Felsenfeld D.P. Schwartzberg P.L. Venegas A. Tse R. Sheetz M.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar).We previously demonstrated that uPA binding to uPAR is required for ERK activation and stimulation of migration (11.Nguyen D.H.D. Catling A.D. Webb D.J. Sankovic M. Walker L.A. Somlyo A.V. Weber M.J. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar); however, the factors that link uPAR to Ras were undetermined. Addressing this problem was not straightforward because the nature of the adaptor proteins that associate with uPAR to transduce signaling responses remains unresolved. There is substantial evidence that integrins may function in this capacity; however, gp130 and/or G protein-coupled receptors may also be involved (21.Kolshenick Y. Ehart M. Hufnagl P. Heinrich P.C. Binder B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28563-28567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 22.Fazioli F. Resnati M. Sidenius N. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7279-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 23.Degryse B. Resnati M. Rabbani S.A. Villa A. Fazioli F. Blasi F. Blood. 1999; 94: 649-662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each putative adaptor protein may be coupled to different signaling effectors that could serve to link uPAR to Ras. To determine the function of FAK, c-Src, and Shc in uPA signaling, we transfected MCF-7 cells to express derivatives of these signaling proteins with dominant-negative activity. In each case, we analyzed ERK phosphorylation and cellular migration on serum-coated surfaces. FAK phosphorylation in response to uPA has been demonstrated previously (13.Tang H. Kerins D.M. Hao Q. Inagami T. Vaughan D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18268-18272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 18.Yebra M. Goretzki L. Pfeifer M. Mueller B.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar); however, our results demonstrate for the first time that FAK is necessary for uPA-stimulated ERK phosphorylation and cellular migration.As with FAK, the role of c-Src in uPA signaling has not been clearly defined. In smooth muscle cells, uPA induces the subcellular relocalization of c-Src to the plasma membrane, preferentially toward the leading-edge of migration (23.Degryse B. Resnati M. Rabbani S.A. Villa A. Fazioli F. Blasi F. Blood. 1999; 94: 649-662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). uPA also causes cytoskeletal reorganization in c-Src+/+ but not c-Src–/–fibroblasts (23.Degryse B. Resnati M. Rabbani S.A. Villa A. Fazioli F. Blasi F. Blood. 1999; 94: 649-662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in endothelial cells, uPA activates ERK by a pathway that is not affected by a general antagonist of Src family kinases (13.Tang H. Kerins D.M. Hao Q. Inagami T. Vaughan D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18268-18272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Our results with kd-Src support a model in which c-Src is necessary for uPA-induced ERK activation and MCF-7 cell migration; however, we cannot rule out the possibility that kd-Src functions by competing with a different enzyme or adaptor protein for a common docking site, such as phosphorylated FAK-397.Shc was phosphorylated within 1 min in uPA-treated MCF-7 cells. Because tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc recruits Grb2/Sos complex (34.Schlaepfer D.D. Jones D.C. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2571-2585Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 36.Wary K.K. Mariotti A. Zurzolo C. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1998; 94: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 41.Walk S.F. March M.E. Ravichandran K.S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2265-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), our results suggested that Shc may play a critical role in coupling uPAR to Ras. To test this hypothesis, we transfected MCF-7 cells to express Shc FFF and demonstrated that these cells do not respond to uPA in ERK phosphorylation assays and in cellular migration experiments. Thus, we propose that ERK is activated by a pathway that requires FAK, Src family kinases, Shc, and Ras. Although we cannot precisely define the relationship of these factors in activating the Ras-ERK pathway, it is significant that the uPAR-initiated pathway shares many similarities with pathways that link integrins to ERK (29.Schaller M.D. Otey C.A. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 30.Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar, 31.Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 623-5633Crossref Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 32.Schlaepfer D.D.

Chem. 1997; 272: 13189-13195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar).Shc phosphorylation was sustained after ERK dephosphorylation was complete in uPA-treated MCF-7 cells. Various feedback inhibition pathways may account for this. For example, Raf may be hyperphosphorylated by enzymes downstream of MEK in the Ras-ERK pathway, causing a redistribution of Raf away from the plasma membrane (45.Wartmann M. Hofer P. Turowski P. Saltiel A.R. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3915-3923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). ERK or another enzyme downstream of MEK may also phosphorylate Sos, promoting Sos dissociation from Grb2 and Shc (44.Langlois W.J. Sasaoka T. Saltiel A.R. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25320-25323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In uPA-treated MCF-7 cells, Sos rapidly dissociated from Shc despite sustained Shc phosphorylation. Thus, integrity of the Shc-Grb2/Sos complex may be a major factor in determining the transient nature of ERK phosphorylation in uPA-treated cells. We propose a model in which 10 nmDIP-uPA rapidly saturates cell-surface uPAR. FAK, Src family kinases, and Shc are recruited to the plasma membrane to form signaling complexes. Phosphorylated Shc then recruits Grb2/Sos complex. Because DIP-uPA does not react with plasminogen activator-inhibitor-1, DIP-uPA-uPAR complex is stable on the cell surface, and free uPAR is not regenerated by endocytosis and recycling (52.Cubellis M.V. Wun T.-C. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1079-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 53.Jensen P.H. Christensen E.I. Ebbesen P. Gliemann J. Andreasen P.A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7412-7420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In this scenario, Sos dissociation from Grb2 and Shc may leave residual upstream signaling complexes incapable of activating Ras. Without this linkage, the activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases dominate and ERK dephosphorylation is observed (56.Keyse S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1265: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 57.Clarke P.R. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 647-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Extremely low levels of uPAR occupancy may be sufficient to promote ERK phosphorylation (10.Nguyen D.H.D.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7412-7420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In fact, uPA that is produced endogenously by cells in culture activates uPAR, via an autocrine pathway, and thereby serves as a major determinant of the basal level of ERK phosphorylation (37.Webb D.J. Nguyen D.H.D. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 113: 123-134Crossref Google Scholar, 55.Webb D.J. Nguyen D.H.D. Sankovic M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 89-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). In addition to its effects on cellular migration, ERK also regulates the transition between tumor cell dormancy and proliferation (58.Ghiso J.A.A. Kovalski K. Ossowski L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 89-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Which ERK activity is observed in a specific uPA-treated cell type may depend on diverse cellular properties, including the kinetics of ERK activation/deactivation. Understanding this process in different cell types represents a challenge for future study. The urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR)1 demonstrates diverse activities that may be important in cellular migration. By binding urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), uPAR localizes proteolytic activity to the leading edge of cellular migration and thereby facilitates cellular penetration of tissue boundaries (1.Estreicher A. Mühlhauser J. Carpentier J.-L. Orci L. Vassalli J.-D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 783-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 2.Gyetko M.R. Todd III, R.F. Wilkinson C.C. Sitrin R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1380-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). uPAR also binds directly to vitronectin and laterally associates with integrins within the plasma membrane, altering the strength of cellular adhesion (3.Wei Y. Waltz D.A. Rao N. Drummond R.J. Rosenberg S. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32380-32388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Simon D.I. Rao N.K. Xu H. Wei Y. Majdic O. Ronne E.

Furthermore, uPAR initiates cell signaling responses (7.Besser D. Verde P. Nagamine Y. Blasi F. Fibrinolysis. 1996; 10: 215-237Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These activities are particularly intriguing because uPAR is linked to the cell surface only by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (8.Ploug M. Rønne E. Behrendt N. Jensen A.L. Blasi F. Dano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1926-1933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor may be critical for uPAR function, in that it affects interaction with other plasma membrane proteins and allows for proper compartmentalization of uPAR within plasma membrane microdomains (5.Wei Y. Lukashev M. Simon D.I. Bodary S.C. Rosenberg S. Doyle M.V. Chapman H.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1551-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 9.Li H. Kuo A. Kochan J. Strickland D. Kariko K. Barnathan E.S. Cines D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8153-8158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In MCF-7 and HT 1080 cells, binding of uPA to uPAR promotes cellular migration on vitronectin by a mechanism that requires uPAR-initiated cell signaling and activation of the Ras-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (10.Nguyen D.H.D. Hussaini I.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8502-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 11.Nguyen D.H.D. Catling A.D. Webb D.J. Sankovic M. Walker L.A. Somlyo A.V. Weber M.J. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The proteolytic activity of uPA is not necessary for this response because the amino-terminal fragment of uPA, which lacks the serine proteinase domains, also activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and promotes cellular migration (10.Nguyen D.H.D. Hussaini I.M. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8502-8507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). uPA activates ERK in other cell types as well, including endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells (12.Kanse S.M. Benzakour O. Kanthou C. Kost C. Lijnen H.R. Preissner K.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2848-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 13.Tang H. Kerins D.M. Hao Q. Inagami T.

There is considerable evidence that uPAR-initiated signaling requires a transmembrane adaptor protein or proteins, as might be expected since uPAR is glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored. Integrins are strong candidates as uPAR-adaptor proteins because integrins are co-purified and co-immunoprecipitated with uPAR and co-localized with uPAR within the plasma membrane by fluorescence m"

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: M19-M31Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Compared with the classical Ras, which plays a pivotal role in cell growth and differentiation, less is known about the other members of this family. It is proposed that three proteins, including R-Ras, TC21, and M-Ras, make up a subfamily (2.Kimmelman A. Tolkacheva T. Lorenzi M.V. Osada M. Chan A.M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2675-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It has also been noted, however, that M-Ras differs at the carboxyl terminus from both TC21 and R-Ras, which share a conserved amino acid motif designated the R-Ras box (3.Ehrhardt G.R. Leslie K.B. Lee F. Wieler J.S. Schrader J.W. Blood. 1999; 94: 2433-2444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Like the classic Ras proteins (Ha-, K-, and N-Ras), all proteins of the R-Ras subfamily transform NIH3T3 cells, albeit less efficiently than does the classic Ras (3.Ehrhardt G.R. Leslie K.B. Lee F.

Consistent with its transforming activity, overexpression and mutation of TC21 have been reported in tumor tissues or cell lines (8.Clark G.J. Kinch M.S. Gilmer T.M. Burridge K. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 169-176PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Huang Y. Saez R. Chao L. Santos E. Aaronson S.A. Chan A.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1255-1260PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Chan A.M. Miki T. Meyers K.A.

Furthermore, TC21 and M-Ras inhibit differentiation of C2 skeletal muscle myoblasts, as does Ha-Ras (7.Quilliam L.A. Castro A.F. Rogers-Graham K.S. Martin C.B. Der C.J. Bi C. J. Biol.

These biological activities are, at least partially, due to the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade by the R-Ras subfamily proteins. In support of this idea, it is reported that R-Ras subfamily proteins bind to Ras effectors and activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (2.Kimmelman A. Tolkacheva T. Lorenzi M.V. Osada M. Chan A.M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2675-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 3.Ehrhardt G.R. Leslie K.B. Lee F. Wieler J.S. Schrader J.W.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In contrast to these reports, however, it is also reported that the R-Ras subfamily does not bind to Raf (6.Graham S.M. Vojtek A.B. Huff S.Y. Cox A.D. Clark G.J. Cooper J.A. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6132-6140Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7.Quilliam L.A. Castro A.F. Rogers-Graham K.S.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and that overexpression of R-Ras did not induce DNA synthesis of Swiss3T3 cells or the differentiation of PC12 cells (14.Rey I. Taylor-Harris P. van Erp H. Hall A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 685-692PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from the similarity to Ras, R-Ras seems to have its unique functions. R-Ras inhibits apoptosis of BaF3 cells induced by cytokine deprivation (15.Suzuki J. Kaziro Y. Koide H. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1689-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and stimulates cell adhesion by integrin (16.Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). However, so far, no effector molecules for R-Ras have been reported to explain its specific function. Ras family G proteins cycle between GDP-bound inactive and GTP-bound active states. The GDP-bound form is converted to the active form by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF),1 and the GTP-bound form returns to the GDP-bound form by hydrolysis. The intrinsic GTPase activity is stimulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). The number of known GEFs and GAPs of Ras family G proteins is increasing owing to the progress of genome sequencing projects. A GEF for Rap1, C3G, and GEFs for Ras, CalDAG-GEFII, and RasGRF, also activate R-Ras (17.Gotoh T. Niino Y. Tokuda M. Hatase O. Nakamura S. Matsuda M. Hattori S. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 13278-13283Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar); however, as far as we know, no GEFs specific to R-Ras subfamily G proteins have been reported. GAPs for Ras family G proteins may be divided into three groups: GAPs for Ras, Rap1, and Ral (19.Zwartkruis F.J. Bos J.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). GAPs for Ras include p120 GAP, GAP1m, and NF-1. R-Ras GAP shares a high amino acid sequence homology with GAP1m, and both R-Ras GAP and GAP1m have been shown to stimulate R-Ras GTPase. GAPs for Rap1 include rap1GAP, SPA-1, tuberin, and GAPIP4BP. The activity of GAP for Ral has been demonstrated; however, the genome of this protein has not been isolated (20.Emkey R. Freedman S. Feig L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9703-9706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Knowledge about GEFs and GAPs of R-Ras subfamily proteins is limited and fragmented in the literature.

Here, by the use of 10 GEFs and 5 GAPs for Ras family G proteins, we report that R-Ras and TC21 are regulated by the same set of GEFs and GAPs and that M-Ras behaves like the classical Ras in terms of its sensitivity to GEFs and GAPs. cDNAs of R-Ras, c-Ha-Ras, and Rap1A (Krev1) were obtained from A. Hall (University College London, London, United Kingdom), K. Kaibuchi (Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Nara, Japan), and M.

The entire coding region of rap1GAPII was subcloned into pAcSG2-His (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) to generate pAcSG2-His-rap1GAPII. cDNAs of the mCDC25 homology domains of CalDAG-GEFs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pGEX4T-3 to generate pGEX-CalDAG-GEFs-CD. The cell lines used in this study, 293T (obtained from B. J. Mayer, Harvard Medical School) and MDCK (ATCC CCL34), were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui, Tokyo) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Expression plasmids were introduced into 293T cells by the calcium-phosphate precipitation method and into MDCK cells with FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Recombinant proteins fused to GST were expressed inE. coli from pGEX-derived vectors and purified as described previously (31.Matsuda M. Tanaka S. Nagata S. Kojima A. Kurata T. Shibuya M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3482-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). His-tagged and maltose-binding protein-tagged proteins were purified from bacterial lysates according to the manufacturers' protocols. Purification of His-tagged rap1GAPII from baculovirus-infected cells will be described elsewhere. 3Y. Ohba, N. Mochizuki, and M. Matsuda, unpublished. Guanine nucleotides bound to R-Ras, TC21, and M-Ras were analyzed essentially as described previously (17.Gotoh T. Niino Y. Tokuda M. Hatase O. Nakamura S. Matsuda M. Hattori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18602-18607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells were transfected with pEBG-R-Ras, TC21, and M-Ras in the presence or absence of the expression plasmids of GEFs or GAPs. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were labeled for 2–4 h with32Pi in phosphate-free modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). For activation of Epac, Sp-cAMPS triethylamine (Research Biochemical International, Natick, MA) was added at 100 μm for 10 min before cell harvest. GST-tagged R-Ras, TC21, and M-Ras were collected on glutathione-Sepharose beads, and guanine nucleotides bound to the G proteins were separated by TLC and quantitated with a BAS-1000 image analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). A fluorescent analogue of GDP, 2′,3′-bis(O)-(N-methylanthranolol)-GDP (mGDP), was purchased from Dojin Kagaku (Kumamoto, Japan). His-R-Ras, His-TC21, and His-M-Ras were loaded with mGDP as described previously (32.Lenzen C. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The mGDP loading efficiency for R-Ras was between 50 and 60%; for TC21 and M-Ras, it was between 80 and 90%. For the measurement of GEF activity, 400 nm of labeled small G protein was incubated with or without 100 nm GEFs in reaction buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) at 20 °C (for R-Ras and TC21) or at 30 °C (for M-Ras). The reaction was started by the addition of GTP at 200 μm. The decrease in fluorescence was monitored with a JASCO FP-750 fluorescence spectrometer, with excitation and emission wavelengths of 366 and 450 nm, respectively. The value obtained at each time point was fitted as a single exponential function, and a rate constant of the reaction was calculated as described previously (32.Lenzen C. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). GAP activity was measured in vitro as described previously (28.Hattori S. Maekawa M. Nakamura S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 481-485PubMed Google Scholar). His-R-Ras, His-TC21, His-M-Ras, GST-Ha-Ras, or GST-Rap1, 5 μm each, was loaded with [γ-32P]GTP in loading buffer (20 mmTris, pH 8, 1.5 μm GTP, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 30 °C for 15 min, followed by the addition of MgCl2 to 20 mm. Purified GAP proteins were added to 250 nm of each small G protein in reaction buffer (20 mm Tris, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) at 30 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of ice-cold washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl). Samples were adsorbed to nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell). The filters were washed three times with washing buffer, dried, and analyzed with a BAS-1000 image analyzer. 293T and MDCK cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated glass plates, and transfected with pCAGGS-EGFP-R-Ras, pCAGGS-EGFP-TC21, and pCAGGS-EGFP-M-Ras. After 24 h, the cells were observed with an LSM-510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). In another experiment, MDCK cells maintained on collagen-coated glass dishes were transfected with expression vectors encoding ECFP-R-Ras, ECFP-TC21, or ECFP-M-Ras and YFP-ER or YFP-Golgi (CLONTECH) for 24 h and observed with the confocal microscope. We first investigated whether GEFs for Ras and Rap1 promote guanine nucleotide exchange of R-Ras, TC21, and M-Ras in vivo. 293T cells expressing GST-tagged G proteins and GEFs were labeled with32Pi, and guanine nucleotides bound to G proteins were analyzed by TLC. As shown in Fig.1 A, the basal level of GTP-bound R-Ras was 22%. The amount of GTP-R-Ras was increased significantly by the expression of RasGRF, C3G, CalDAG-GEFI, CalDAG-GEFII, and CalDAG-GEFIII. Very similarly to R-Ras, the basal level of GTP-bound TC21 was 25%, and the amount of GTP-bound TC21 was increased by the expression of RasGRF, C3G, CalDAG-GEFI, CalDAG-GEFII, and CalDAG-GEFIII. By contrast, GTP-bound M-Ras was 6% without GEFs and increased by the expression of mSos, RasGRF, CalDAG-GEFII, and CalDAG-GEFIII, all of which have been shown to activate Ha-Ras. Because the effect of C3G expression was marginal, we utilized C3G-CD, which is the activated form of C3G (Fig. 1 B). Expression of C3G-CD increased the amount of GTP-R-Ras and TC21 more efficiently than did the full-length C3G, whereas M-Ras was not activated by either the full-length C3G or C3G-CD. Other GEFs for Rap1, including GFR (24.Ichiba T. Hoshi Y. Eto Y. Tajima N. Kuraishi Y. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), PDZ-GEF1 (25.de Rooij J.

We examined the guanine nucleotide exchange reaction of R-Ras, TC21, and M-Ras in vitro. A fluorescent analogue of guanine nucleotide, mGDP, was loaded on G proteins, and its replacement with GTP was monitored by a fluorescence spectrometer in the presence of GEFs as described previously (35.van den Berghe N. Cool R.H. Horn G. Wittinghofer A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The intrinsic exchanging rate under our experimental conditions was examined, because TC21 is reported to show a high intrinsic exchange activity (5.Movilla N. Crespo P. Bustelo X.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5860-5869Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As shown in TableI, the intrinsic exchange rate of R-Ras was the highest, followed by those of TC21 and M-Ras at the examined temperatures. These intrinsic guanine nucleotide exchange rates were significantly higher than those of Ha-Ras and Rap1. In order to normalize the intrinsic exchange rate, the effect of GEFs was monitored at 20 °C for R-Ras and TC21 and at 30 °C for M-Ras. As shown in Fig. 2 and TableII, RasGRF, CalDAG-GEFII, and CalDAG-GEFIII efficiently promoted dissociation of mGDP from all three G proteins. C3G and CalDAG-GEFI promoted guanine nucleotide exchange of R-Ras and TC21, albeit less efficiently than did the other three GEFs. Epac did not promote the guanine nucleotide exchange of any of the tested G proteins, irrespective of the presence or absence of the cAMP analogue. Under the same conditions, guanine nucleotide exchange of Ha-Ras was promoted by CalDAG-GEFII and CalDAG-GEFIII.2Similarly, under these conditions, we confirmed that nucleotide exchange of Rap1 was promoted by C3G, CalDAG-GEFI, CalDAG-GEFIII, and Epac.3 Thus, the same set of GEFs regulates R-Ras and TC21, whereas M-Ras was stimulated by the GEFs for Ha-Ras.Table IIntrinsic exchange rates of R-Ras, TC21, and M-RasG proteinsReaction temperature (°C)203037R-Ras6.81545TC214.81125M-Ras3.67.08.6Ha-Ras1.8ND aND, not determined.NDRap1A2.3NDNDPurified G proteins were loaded with mGDP and incubated at the indicated temperatures for 10 min.

Rate constants are given in 10−4 units/s. We next examined the specificity of GAPs to R-Ras, TC21, and M-Ras. G proteins were loaded with [γ-32P]GTP and incubated with GAPs. The decrease in the bound radioactivity was quantitated as shown in Fig. 3. GTPase activity of R-Ras, TC21, and M-Ras was stimulated by GAPs for Ras, Gap1m, p120 GAP, and NF-1, as efficiently as was that of Ha-Ras. R-Ras GAP stimulated GTPase activity of R-Ras and TC21, but not of M-Ras, Ha-Ras, or Rap1. None of the tested G proteins except Rap1 was sensitive to rap1GAPII. We further investigated the sensitivity of the G proteins to GAPs in 293T cells (Fig. 4). To measure the GAP activity, we increased the GTP-bound form by the co-expression of RasGRF. In accordance with the in vitro data, the GTPase activity of R-Ras and TC21 was activated by both Gap1m and R-Ras GAP, but that of M-Ras was stimulated only by Gap1m. By using green fluorescent protein-tagged proteins, Choy et al. have shown that the choice of exon at the carboxyl terminus of K-Ras determines whether it reaches the plasma membrane from Golgi or ER (48.Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J. Feoktistov M. Morimoto T. Michaelson D. Ivanov I.E. Philips M.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Thus, we compared the subcellular localization of R-Ras, TC21, and M-Ras using green fluorescent protein-tagged proteins. As shown in Fig. 5 A, green fluorescent protein-R-Ras, TC21, and M-Ras were localized mainly at the plasma membrane in 293T cells. When we used MDCK cells, they were more enriched in the cytoplasm. To investigate further whether these G proteins were localized at the Golgi apparatus or endoplasmic reticulum in MDCK cells, we co-expressed enhanced yellow fluorescent protein-tagged markers of ER or Golgi with the cyan fluorescent protein-tagged G proteins (Fig. 5 B). We observed that some of the R-Ras, M-Ras, and TC21 co-localized with ER; however, the characteristic distribution of Golgi apparatus was not observed for the G proteins. In this study, we have shown that R-Ras and TC21 are regulated by the same set of GEFs (TableIII) and GAPs. In addition, R-Ras and TC21 have another feature in common; the basal level in the GTP-bound form of R-Ras and TC21 exceeds 20% without stimulation, whereas those of M-Ras, Ras, Rap1, and Ral are less than 15% in 293T cells. By contrast, M-Ras is very similar to Ha-Ras in the regulation by GEFs and GAPs. This observation is particularly important because the amount of M-Ras exceeds that of Ha-Ras in many tissues and cell lines (3.Ehrhardt G.R. Leslie K.B. Lee F. Wieler J.S. Schrader J.W. Blood. 1999; 94: 2433-2444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these cells, signals that have been postulated to be transmitted by Ras seem also to be transmitted by M-Ras. However, it should be pointed out that Raf activation by M-Ras is significantly weaker than that by the classical Ras. In agreement with this difference, the transforming activity of M-Ras is significantly weaker than that of the classical Ras (3.Ehrhardt G.R. Leslie K.B. Lee F. Wieler J.S. Schrader J.W. Blood. 1999; 94: 2433-2444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, M-Ras does not necessarily function as the fourth member of the classical Ras.Table IIISummary of the specificity of GEFs for Ras-family G proteinsSosRasGRFCalDAG-GEFIIC3GCalDAG-GEFIEpacPDZ-GEFGFRRas aData for Ras, Rap1, Rap2, and Ral are shown for comparison.2, 3+++−−−−−M-Ras+++−−−−−TC21−++++−−−R-Ras−++++−−−Rap1−−−+++++Rap2−−−+++++Ral−−−−−−−−Specificity of GEFs is determined as described in the text and shown in Figs. 1 and 2.a Data for Ras, Rap1, Rap2, and Ral are shown for comparison.2, 3 Open table in a new tab Specificity of GEFs is determined as described in the text and shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Recent analyses have revealed that the switch II region (amino acids 57–75) and residues 40, 61, and 70 of Ha-Ras are critical in the recognition by GEFs (36.Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 37.van den Berghe N. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11078-11085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the M-Ras switch II region differs from that of TC21 only at residue 75 (Fig.6); the classical Ras and M-Ras contain serine at this position, whereas R-Ras and TC21 contain glycine. To examine whether the amino acid of this position determined the interaction to GEFs, we made two mutants, TC21Ser-75 and M-RasGly-75. Against our expectation, neither substitution changed the interaction to GEFs, compared with each wild type.3 Hence, GEFs discriminate between TC21 and M-Ras by a region(s) other than the switch II region. Surprisingly, although five GEFs have been shown to activate R-Ras and TC21, none of them is specific to this R-Ras subfamily. RasGRF, CalDAG-GEFII, and CalDAG-GEFIII also activate G proteins of the classical Ras subfamily. C3G, CalDAG-GEFI, and CalDAG-GEFIII also activate the Rap1 subfamily. Officially, it is possible that an unidentified GEF is highly specific to the R-Ras subfamily; however, it should be noted that, in many circumstances, activation of the R-Ras subfamily is accompanied by activation of either the Ras or the Rap1 subfamily. In this regard, the substrate specificity of R-Ras GAP seems to be more specific (21.Yamamoto T. Matsui T. Nakafuku M. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30557-30561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and thus, R-Ras GAP may play a critical role in the specific regulation of the R-Ras subfamily. Apart from the substrate specificity, the tissue distribution of G protein, GEFs, and GAPs is critical in the understanding of the regulation of the G proteins in a physiologic milieu. R-Ras, TC21, and M-Ras are all expressed ubiquitously, although their expression levels vary among tissues; for example, M-Ras is enriched in the brain (2.Kimmelman A. Tolkacheva T. Lorenzi M.V.

The expression levels of TC21 and M-Ras also vary depending upon the stimulation of growth factors and cytokines (38.Louahed J. Grasso L. De Smet C. Van Roost E. Wildmann C. Nicolaides N.C. Levitt R.C. Renauld J.C. Blood. 1999; 94: 1701-1710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40.Kozian D.H. Augustin H.G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Some GEFs, including mSos and C3G, are expressed ubiquitously (17.Gotoh T. Niino Y. Tokuda M. Hatase O. Nakamura S. Matsuda M. Hattori S. J. Biol.

Expression of other GEFs is limited to some tissues; for example, RasGRF is expressed mostly in brain and testis (42.Shou C. Farnsworth C.L. Neel B.G. Feig L.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), and CalDAG-GEFI and CalDAG-GEFII are concentrated in brain and hematopoietic organs (18.Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Toki S.

Of note, p120 GAP, NF-1, Gap1m, and R-Ras GAP were expressed abundantly in the brain, suggesting a specific role of G proteins in this organ (21.Yamamoto T. Matsui T. Nakafuku M. Iwamatsu A.

Extensive examination of localization of G proteins and their regulatory proteins will be required to decipher the cell type-specific signaling cascades. Subcellular localization of the G proteins and the corresponding regulatory proteins should also be important for understanding the signaling cascade of Ras family G proteins. Sos and C3G are activated by translocation to the plasma membrane by the adaptor proteins (46.Feig L.A. Science. 1993; 260: 767-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar,47.Buchsbaum R. Telliez J.B. Goonesekera S. Feig L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4888-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, GEFs such as Epac and CalDAG-GEFs may be activated at the intracellular membrane compartments (19.Zwartkruis F.J. Bos J.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In our preliminary experiments, we noticed that fixatives used for the indirect immunofluorescent method significantly altered the staining pattern, hindering correct estimation of the subcellular localization of G proteins. Thus, we utilized green fluorescent protein-tagged G proteins in this study. Against our expectation, there was no remarkable difference in the subcellular distribution of R-Ras, TC21, and M-Ras. All three G proteins were localized both at the plasma membrane and also within the cells, although the ratio varied significantly between 293T cells and MDCK cells. It may be important to examine the localization of G proteins together with that of GEFs and GAPs. In conclusion, we showed that TC21 and R-Ras form a subgroup and that M-Ras belongs to the classic Ras subfamily when we classified these G proteins according to their specificity to GEFs and GAPs.

https://openalex.org/W1968658950,"Activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells by the calcium-sensitive serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin has been proposed as one of the molecular mechanisms by which motor nerve activity establishes the slow muscle phenotype. To investigate whether the calcineurin pathway can regulate the large spectrum of slow muscle characteristics in vivo, we treated rats for three weeks with cyclosporin A (an inhibitor of calcineurin). In soleus (slow muscle), but not in plantaris (fast muscle), the proportion of slow myosin heavy chain (MHC-1) and slow sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA2a) was decreased, whereas that of fast MHC (MHC-2A) and fast SERCA1 increased, indicating a slow to fast contractile phenotype transition. Cytosolic isoforms of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase (most abundant in fast fibers), as well as mitochondrial creatine kinase and citrate synthase activities (elevated in fast/oxidative fibers) were dose dependently increased by cyclosporin A treatment in soleus muscle, with no change in plantaris. Calcineurin catalytic subunit was more abundant in soleus muscle fibers compared with plantaris. Taken together these results suggest that the calcineurin pathway co-regulates a set of multigenic protein families involved in the transition between slow oxidative (type I) to fast oxidative (type IIa) phenotype in soleus muscle.

Four major fiber types have been characterized according to their contractile and metabolic properties: slow oxidative (type I), fast oxidative/glycolytic (type IIa), and fast glycolytic (type IIx and IIb) fibers. Increasing motor nerve activity results in the phenoconversion from a fast twitch into a slow twitch muscle, involving changes in the expression of specific members of multigenic families encoding proteins involved in excitation-contraction coupling and energy metabolism (1.Buller A.J. Eccles J.C. Eccles R.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1960; 150: 417-439Crossref Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 2.Pette D. Vrbova G. Muscle Nerve. 1999; 22: 666-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Whereas the factors regulating muscle phenotype have begun to be identified, the transcription factors regulating fiber-type specification and plasticity remain largely unknown (3.Buonanno A. Rosenthal N. Dev. Genet. 1996; 19: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recently a signal mechanism involving calcineurin, a cyclosporin-sensitive phosphatase, has been suggested to promote the fast to slow fiber transformation induced by increased motor nerve activity (4.Chin E.R. Olson E.N. Richardson J.A. Yang Q. Humphries C. Shelton J.M. Wu W. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). The serine/threonine phosphatase activity of the calcium-activated calcineurin leads to the dephosphorylation of a nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT),1which is then translocated to the nucleus where it binds to specific nucleotide recognition sequences and stimulates the transcription of target genes (4.Chin E.R. Olson E.N. Richardson J.A. Yang Q. Humphries C. Shelton J.M. Wu W. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 5.Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Imunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar) in cooperation with cell-specific transcription factors. It was shown that myoglobin and the slow isoform of troponin I genes respond positively to calcineurin. Moreover, an increase in fast myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms was observed in soleus muscle of rats treated with cyclosporin A (CsA), a specific inhibitor of calcineurin (4.Chin E.R. Olson E.N. Richardson J.A. Yang Q. Humphries C. Shelton J.M. Wu W. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 6.Liu J. Farmer J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3634) Google Scholar), although the specificity among the fast MHC isoforms was not investigated. Moreover, this is challenged by a previous report showing that the expression of MHC isoforms was not affected by clinically relevant doses of CsA in rat in vivo (7.Biring M.S. Fournier M. Ross D.J. Lewis M.I. J. Appl. Physiol. 1998; 84: 1967-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and by a recent study in mice, leading to the conclusion that the calcineurin pathway is involved only in conditions of increased activity (8.Dunn S.E. Burns J.L. Michel R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21908-21912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Additional studies are thus needed to determine the impact of calcineurin inhibition on the expression of each of the four major MHC isoforms identified to date in adult rat muscles. The metabolic and contractile properties of muscles should be coordinately regulated during myofiber conversion to adapt to the functional requirements imposed on the muscle. Thus, if the calcineurin transduction pathway is involved in phenotype transition, other functional components such as enzymes of energy metabolism, proteins involved in sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ handling and the capillarity should also be responsive to calcineurin inhibition. Ca2+ release and uptake are faster in fast twitch than in slow twitch muscles (9.Briggs F.N. Poland J.L. Solaro R.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1977; 266: 587-594Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For example, fast twitch muscles predominantly express the fast isoform of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ATPase (SERCA1), whereas SERCA2a is mainly expressed in slow twitch muscles (10.Wu K.D. Lee W.S. Wey J. Bungard D. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C775-C784Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the expression of SERCA isoforms is sensitive to changes in loading conditions and/or muscle activity, in parallel with alterations in the myosin phenotype (2.Pette D. Vrbova G. Muscle Nerve. 1999; 22: 666-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 11.Schulte L.M. Navarro J. Kandarian S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C1308-C1315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,12.Kandarian S.C. Peters D.G. Taylor J.A. Williams J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1190-C1197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among fast fibers, type IIa fibers exhibit a higher oxidative metabolism than slow oxidative fibers, whereas IIx and IIb fibers have lower oxidative potential (13.Smith D. Green H. Thomson J. Sharratt M. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: C661-C668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, either an increase or a decrease in oxidative enzymes is expected with a slow to fast transition, depending on the extent of the transition. We recently reported that oxidative capacity of in situ mitochondria of soleus and plantaris muscle fibers was not altered by CsA itself but by its vehicle (14.Sanchez H. Bigard X. Veksler V. Mettauer B. Lampert E. Lonsdorfer J. Ventura-Clapier R. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2000; 32: 323-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), whereas effects of CsA per se on the activity of specific mitochondrial markers have not been investigated so far. Furthermore, other enzymes such as creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), two important families of metabolic enzymes, exist as multiple isoforms contributing to the molecular diversity of muscle fibers. M-CK and M-LDH activities are elevated in fast fibers, whereas the sarcomeric mitochondrial CK (mi-CK) and H-LDH are high in oxidative fibers. As the mi-CK gene possesses the NFAT recognition sequence in its 5′-end, this renders it a possible candidate for regulation by calcineurin, although no data are yet available (4.Chin E.R. Olson E.N. Richardson J.A. Yang Q. Humphries C. Shelton J.M. Wu W. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). A correlation between the LDH and CK isozyme profiles and the anaerobic/aerobic glycolysis capacity of muscle has been shown during muscle unloading (15.Bigard A.X. Boehm E. Veksler V. Mateo P. Anflous K. Ventura-Clapier R. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 2391-2401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) suggesting a possible regulation by calcineurin. Finally, the capillary bed provides the final pathway for delivery of oxygen and substrates to muscle fibers. A relationship between capillary length and mitochondrial volume density was found in several species (16.Hoppeler H. Kayar S.R. News Physiol. Sci. 1988; 3: 113-116Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by the parallel increase in capillary network and oxidative capacity with electrical stimulation (17.Skorjanc D. Jaschinski F. Heine G. Pette D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 43: C810-C818Crossref Google Scholar) and decreased capillarity with deconditioning (18.Desplanches D. Favier R. Sempore B. Hoppeler H. J. Appl. Physiol. 1991; 71: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A decrease in the capillary bed has been observed in a fast twitch muscle in rats treated with low doses of CsA (7.Biring M.S. Fournier M. Ross D.J. Lewis M.I. J. Appl. Physiol. 1998; 84: 1967-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present study was thus to investigate whether the calcineurin pathway is active in vivo to maintain slow fiber phenotype and whether it is involved in the fiber type transition from fast IIb ⇒ IIx ⇒ IIa ⇒ slow I or is restricted to a given stage of phenotype. Moreover, as the generation of functional and highly specialized myofibers requires the coordinated regulation of different proteins during fiber type transitions, we tested whether calcineurin inhibition by CsA treatment mimics the effects of decreased motor nerve activity on morphological, metabolic, and contractile characteristics of slow muscle. The purpose of the present study was thus to investigate the effects of in vivo inhibition of the calcineurin pathway by CsA treatment in both a slow twitch (soleus, SOL) and a fast twitch (plantaris, PLA) skeletal muscle on 1) the expression of all MHC isoforms identified so far; 2) the expression of SERCA isoforms in single fibers; 3) the activity and isoenzyme pattern of CK and LDH, two essential enzymatic systems in energy metabolism; 4) the activity of the citrate synthase (CS), a marker of muscle oxidative capacity; and 5) the capillary network. Male Wistar rats initially weighing 180 g were purchased from IFFA Credo (L'Arbresle, France). Animals were housed 4/cage in a thermoneutral environment (22 ± 2 °C) on a 12:12 h photoperiod and were provided with food and water ad libitum. This investigation was carried out in accordance with the Helsinki Accords for Humane Treatment of Animals during Experimentation. After 3 days acclimatization to the animal room, rats were randomly assigned to one of four experimental groups. The animals received orally either a daily dose of 10 (n = 7) or 25 (CsA group, n = 8) mg/kg CsA as Sandimmun® diluted in 0.5 ml of olive oil, a daily dose of 0.5 ml of the vehicle (Vh, n = 8), or a daily dose of 0.5 ml of water to have a control of the gavage procedure (C,n = 7). The complete vehicle of Sandimmun®was reconstituted from two-thirds Cremophor® EL (BASF, Germany) and one-third alcohol diluted in olive oil. Vh animals received a volume of vehicle equivalent to that of a daily dose of 25 mg/kg CsA. Doses of Sandimmun® and vehicle were adjusted according to weight gain. Following three weeks of treatment, animals were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (90 mg/kg body weight) administered intraperitoneally. SOL and PLA muscles were excised, cleaned of adipose and connective tissue, and weighed. Muscles of the right hindlimb were mounted in an embedding medium (TEK O.C.T. compound) and frozen in isopentane cooled to the freezing point (−160 °C) by liquid nitrogen, whereas muscles of the left hindlimb were weighed and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for biochemical determinations. Both dorsal and epididymal fat pads were excised, cleaned, and weighed. The tibia length was measured in the right leg after dissection. All samples were stored at −80 °C until histochemical and biochemical analyses were performed. Serial transverse sections (10 μm thick) were cut from the mid-belly portion of SOL and PLA in a cryostat maintained at −20 °C. Some sections were labeled with mouse monoclonal antibodies against myosin reacting either with 1) slow type 1 (Novocastra, reference NCL-MHCS, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK), 2) all adult fast and developmentally regulated epitopes but not with slow myosin (MY-32, Sigma), 3) fast type 2A (SC-71), 4) slow and fast type 2A and type 2B but not with type 2X MHC (BF-35), or 5) fast type 2B MHC isoforms (BF-F3). Other sections were labeled with the SERCA1-specific antibody (clone VE12 G9, Novocastra Laboratories, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK), or the SERCA2a-specific antibody (clone IID8, Novocastra Laboratories, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK). The catalytic subunit of calcineurin, designated PP2B-A, was localized in SOL and PLA muscles after incubation with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (SC9070, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). This antibody was applied to tissue sections for 12 h at +4 °C. The avidin-biotin immunohistochemical procedure was used for the localization of the antigen-antibody binding (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Negative control slides with omission of the primary antibodies were randomly included in the immunostaining procedure. A sample of ∼400 fibers was randomly selected from fields equally distributed over the biopsy for single fiber MHC composition. Fibers were classified according to their staining profile with the aid of a microscope linked to a computer-based image analysis system (Visiolab 200, Nikon-France). Moreover, some sections were stained with hematoxylin eosin to evidence the nuclei (19.Dubowitz V. Muscle Biopsy. A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. Baillière Tindal, London1985: 28-29Google Scholar). Muscles were subjected to the analysis of MHC isoforms as described previously (20.Talmadge R.J. Roy R.R. J. Appl. Physiol. 1993; 75: 2337-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Myosin was extracted and separated in acrylamide gel solution containing 30% glycerol, 8% acrylamide-bis (50:1), 0.2 m Tris, 0.1 mglycine, and 0.4% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Electrophoresis was performed using a Mini Protean II system (Bio-Rad). Gels were run at constant voltage (70 V) for ∼28 h and then stained with Coomassie Blue. The MHC protein isoform bands were scanned and quantified by using a densitometer system equipped with an integrator (GS-700, Bio-Rad). Frozen tissue samples were weighed and placed into an ice-cold homogenization buffer (30 mg wet weight/ml) containing: 5 mm Hepes (pH 8.7), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, and 0.1% Triton. Samples were homogenized using a micro-glass hand homogenizer and were incubated for 60 min at 0 °C to ensure complete enzyme extraction. The total adenylate kinase and CK activities were assayed as described previously (15.Bigard A.X. Boehm E. Veksler V. Mateo P. Anflous K. Ventura-Clapier R. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 2391-2401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). CK isoenzymes were separated using agarose (1%) gel electrophoresis performed at 200 V for 90 min. To avoid saturation of the various CK isoforms, three dilutions were used for each sample. Individual isoenzymes were resolved by incubating the gel with a paper soaked with staining solution containing: 22 mm MES (pH 7.4), 50 mmmagnesium acetate, 70 mm glucose, 120 mm n-acetyl cysteine, 9 mm ADP, 120 mm phosphocreatine, 9 mm NADP, 0.1 mm P1,P5-di(adenosine-5′)pentaphosphate (to inhibit adenylate kinase), 9 IU/ml hexokinase, and 6 IU/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Isoenzyme bands were visualized and quantified using an image analysis system (Bio-Rad). The LDH isoenzyme profile was determined using agarose gel electrophoresis (Sigma LDH reagent kit, Sigma) at 200 V for 90 min followed by image analysis. CS activity was determined according to Ref. 21.Srere P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 3-11Crossref Scopus (2038) Google Scholar. Capillaries were visualized using acidic adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) reaction (22.Sillau A.H. Banchero N. Pflügers Archiv. Eur. J. Physiol. 1977; 369: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and identified using a computer-based image analysis system (Visiolab 200, Nikon-France). Four to six areas were selected on each sample and they represented total area A. These areas were randomly determined on the expanse of the SOL and PLA muscles. The capillary bed was appraised according to the following parameters: 1) the capillary density (CD), which was calculated as the number of capillaries in the total area (A) divided by the area of A; and 2) the capillary to fiber ratio (C/F), which was determined as CD normalized by fiber density where fiber density represents the mean number of fibers/mm2 (half of the number of fibers on the border line of the area were counted) (22.Sillau A.H. Banchero N. Pflügers Archiv. Eur. J. Physiol. 1977; 369: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Blood samples were taken from the abdominal aorta of animals 20 h after the last dose of cyclosporin, at the time of sacrifice. Levels were assayed by using a whole blood fluorescence polymerization immunoassay (Behring Diagnostics Inc). All data are presented as mean ± S.E. One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine the global effect of treatment. When appropriate, differences between groups were tested with a Newman-Keuls post hoc test. Relationships between CsA levels in blood and parameters of interest were examined by computing the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient (r). Statistical significance was accepted atp < 0.05. Blood CsA levels have been measured in 7 rats treated with 10 mg/kg/day of CsA and 5 animals treated with 25 mg/kg/day. As expected, the mean cyclosporin level in blood was lower in the former than in the latter (742 ± 199 ng/ml and 1896 ± 311 ng/ml, respectively, p < 0.02). A large scattering of CsA levels was found reflecting the great variability in the bio-availability of the drug. This inter-individual variability was used to estimate the correlation between the blood level of CsA and parameters of interest, whereas mean values reported in the tables refer to the group treated with 25 mg/kg/day CsA (CsA group). Initial body weights did not significantly differ among groups. Three weeks of CsA treatment resulted in a lower body weight compared with the C and Vh groups (−33% and −23%, respectively, p < 0.01), whereas vehicle by itself was responsible for a 12% decrease in body weight (p < 0.01) (Table I). Following the three weeks treatment, the weight gain of the animals was inversely correlated with the blood level of cyclosporin (p < 0.0001, Fig.1 A). Both vehicle and CsA treatments slightly reduced the skeleton growth rate as tibia length was decreased by 3% and 5%, respectively (p < 0.01) (Table I). As a consequence, cyclosporin per se decreased the skeleton growth rate by 2% (p < 0.05).Table IMorphological data in C, Vh- and CsA-treated animalsC groupVh groupCsA groupANOVAFinal body weight, g324 ± 5285 ± 5**218 ± 8** ****p < 0.001Tibia length, cm3.86 ± 0.013.73 ± 0.03**3.66 ± 0.02** ***p < 0.001Absolute muscle weight, mg SOL126 ± 7107 ± 5*72 ± 4** ****p < 0.001 PLA271 ± 9221 ± 14**178 ± 8** ****p < 0.001Relative muscle weight, mg/cm Soleus32.7 ± 1.728.7 ± 1.219.7 ± 1.1** ****p < 0.001 Plantaris70.2 ± 2.259.1 ± 3.448.7 ± 1.9** ****p < 0.001Fat pad weight, g4.64 ± 0.364.04 ± 0.363.06 ± 0.29** ***p < 0.01Relative fat pad weight, g/cm1.20 ± 0.091.08 ± 0.090.84 ± 0.08*p < 0.05Values are mean ± S.E.

The absolute weights of SOL and PLA muscles were affected by both the vehicle (−15%, p < 0.05 and −18%,p < 0.01, respectively) and the cyclosporin per se (−33%, p < 0.01 and −20%,p < 0.01, respectively). When normalized to tibia length, the SOL and PLA muscle weights were only affected by CsA (−31% and −18%, respectively, in comparison with Vh group,p < 0.01) (Table I). Both the absolute and the normalized fat pad weights of the CsA group were reduced relative to the C and Vh groups (−34%, p < 0.01 and −30%,p < 0.05, respectively). Muscles and fat weights were inversely correlated with blood CsA (p < 0.01) (Fig.1, B and C). Myosin heavy chains are the hallmark of fiber type. CsA treatment specifically affected the MHC profile of SOL as measured using gel electrophoresis. The MHC-1 relative content was lower in SOL muscles of CsA treated than Vh and C rats (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). Meanwhile, the relative content of MHC-2A increased in the CsA group, compared with Vh and C animals (p < 0.05) (Table II). Interestingly, only three samples of the CsA group were shown to contain a small percentage of MHC-2X (range 1.2–4%). This isoform was lacking in all other groups. No significant change in the MHC isoform distribution was detected in the PLA (Table II).Table IIMHC distribution based on gel electrophoresis in soleus and plantaris muscles from C, Vh- and CsA-treated animalsC groupVh groupCsA groupANOVASoleus MHC-198.1 ± 0.996.6 ± 288.6 ± 2.5** ***p < 0.01 MHC-2A1.9 ± 0.93.4 ± 210.5 ± 2.6* ***p < 0.05 MHC-2XNDND0.9 ± 0.5* ***p < 0.05Plantaris MHC-13.5 ± 1.12.7 ± 0.71.8 ± 1.6NS MHC-2A8.8 ± 1.35.7 ± 1.15.4 ± 1.6NS MHC-2X25.2 ± 2.727.6 ± 3.423.1 ± 4.1NS MHC-2B62.4 ± 3.763.9 ± 3.469.8 ± 4.3NSValues are mean ± S.E. in percentage of total myosin.

CsA treatment induced a decrease in the percentage of type I fibers (p < 0.01) and a higher percentage of type IIa fibers (p < 0.01) in SOL, compared with both Vh and C rats (Fig. 2 and TableIII). Moreover, the percentage of hybrid fibers containing both type I and type IIa MHC was higher in CsA group compared with those in C and Vh groups (p < 0.01). No pure type IIx fibers were detected in the CsA group, and the antibody against MHC-2B, the fastest MHC isoform, gave undetectable staining in all groups. As blood CsA increased, the total number of fibers expressing MHC-2A increased (Fig.3 A).Table IIIFiber type composition of soleus and plantaris muscles from C, Vh- and CsA-treated animals and percentages of fibers expressing or coexpressing SERCA isoformsC groupVh groupCsA groupANOVASoleus Type I90.5 ± 2.587.8 ± 3.862.8 ± 4.3** ****p < 0.01 Type I/IIa2.9 ± 1.12.1 ± 1.510.7 ± 3.5** ****p < 0.001 Type IIa6.6 ± 0.610.2 ± 3.126.4 ± 4.1** ****p < 0.001 SERCA2a89.4 ± 2.992.1 ± 1.776.3 ± 3.6* ***p < 0.005 SERCA111.2 ± 1.88.20 ± 1.332.6 ± 2.8* ***p < 0.001Plantaris Type I10.5 ± 1.410.4 ± 1.68.5 ± 0.8NS Type IIa36.6 ± 1.634.7 ± 2.133.8 ± 2.4NS Type IIx34.4 ± 1.934.7 ± 1.323.4 ± 1.9** ****p < 0.001 Type IIb31.5 ± 230.4 ± 2.846 ± 2.8** ****p < 0.001Values are mean ± S.E. in percentage.

There was a significant decrease in the percentage of type IIx fibers in CsA rats, compared with those in C and Vh groups (p < 0.005). Moreover, CsA rats had a higher percentage of type IIb fibers than both C and Vh groups (p < 0.001 and p < 0.005, respectively). No effect of vehicle per se was observed on MHC expression or fiber type distribution. Because the cyclosporin-induced slow to fast transition in the MHC isoforms was mainly observed in SOL, the expression of specific SERCA isoforms in single fibers was only examined in this muscle. Vehicle did not affect SERCA expression (Table III). In normal SOL muscles, only 8% of fibers were stained with the SERCA1-specific antibody (Fig. 2). Fibers negative for SERCA1 stained for SERCA2a, and only few fibers expressed both isoforms. After 3 weeks of CsA administration, the percentage of SERCA1-positive fibers increased three times compared with both C and Vh groups (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2 and Table III). In SOL muscles of rats from the CsA group, the proportion of fibers expressing SERCA2a decreased to 71% compared with C and Vh groups (p < 0.05). A strong correlation was observed between the proportion of fibers expressing SERCA1 and blood CsA (Fig.3 B). Interestingly, a strong correlation was found between the percentage of fibers expressing MHC-2A and those expressing SERCA1 (p < 0.0001), as well as between the percentage of fibers expressing MHC-1 and those containing SERCA2a (p< 0.0001) isoforms in all SOL muscles (Fig.4, A and B). Moreover, fibers coexpressing SERCA1 and SERCA2a were also those coexpressing MHC-1 and MHC-2A (Fig. 2). CsA treatment resulted in a 28% increase in the total LDH activity in SOL muscles (p < 0.05, Table IV). Moreover, the LDH isoenzyme composition of SOL muscles was also affected by the treatment because both the percentage (+26%, p < 0.01) and the activity (+63%, p < 0.01) of the M subunit measured in CsA group increased, compared with both C and Vh rats, with no change in the H subunit. Again, no significant change was observed in PLA muscles.Table IVEnergy metabolism in soleus and plantaris muscles from C, Vh- and CsA-treated animalsSOLPLACVhCsAANOVACVhCsAANOVACS33.1 ± 4.537.6 ± 1.654.7 ± 1.6**p < 0.0139.1 ± 2.940.9 ± 2.735.2 ± 2.1NSAK298 ± 55250 ± 44307 ± 56NS905 ± 122792 ± 144628 ± 122NSTotal CK1397 ± 1251346 ± 381829 ± 89**p < 0.0053416 ± 623391 ± 743228 ± 135NS MM-CK1349 ± 1201300 ± 341769 ± 83**p < 0.0013387 ± 633465 ± 753207 ± 135NS mi-CK47.6 ± 7.146.7 ±"

Each subunit was overexpressed in insect cells and purified. Both must be present for the damaged DNA band shift characteristic of the HeLa heterodimer. However, overexpressed p48 peptides containing the mutations found in three Ddb− XPE strains are inactive, and wild type p48 restores DDB activity to extracts from a fourth XPE Ddb− strain, GM01389, in which compound heterozygous mutations in DDB2 (p48) lead to a L350P change from one allele and a Asn-349 deletion from the other. Although these results indicate that these mutations are each responsible for the loss of DDB activity, they do not affect nuclear localization of p48. In normal fibroblasts, a 4-fold increase in p48 mRNA amount was observed 38 h after UV irradiation, preceding a similar elevation in p48 protein and DDB activity at 48 h, implying that p48 limits DDB activity in vivo.

Based on fusion studies of cells from XP patients, seven NER-defective complementation groups (A through G) and a post-replication repair-deficient variant group (XPV) have been identified (1.Cleaver J.E.

However, recent NER reconstitution studies have reported that DDB is not required in vitro (14.Mu D. Park C.H. Matsunaga T. Hsu D.S. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol.

Nonetheless, microinjection of purified HeLa DDB heterodimer (p127, p48) into XPE cells restores in vivo DNA repair synthesis to normal levels in XPE Ddb− strains but not in XPE Ddb+ strains or in cells from other XP groups (17.Keeney S. Eker A.P.M. Brody T. Vermeulen W. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Linn S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4053-4056Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the cDNAs that encode the DDB heterodimer have identified single base mutations only in DDB2 (p48) of XPE Ddb− cells. In the Ddb− strains, XP2RO and XP3RO, a G → A transition at nucleotide +818 causes an R273H change in p48, whereas an A → G transition at nucleotide +730 causes a K244E change in XP82TO. Overexpression of wild type p48, but not of p127, in insect cells greatly increases DDB activity in extracts prepared from these cells, indicating that p48 is required for damage-specific DNA binding (18.Nichols A.F. Ong P. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24317-24320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).In the present study, we have reconstituted human DDB activity in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay by combining insect extracts containing individually overexpressed wild type p127 and p48. Both extracts were required for damage-specific DNA binding activity, but extracts containing mutant XP2RO- and XP82TO-p48 polypeptides were unable to complement p127, demonstrating that the mutations inactivate DDB activity in these XPE Ddb− strains. The wild type human p127 and p48, which were overexpressed in insect cells, were purified by monitoring the reconstitution of DDB, and purified wild type p48 was able to restore DDB activity to an extract prepared from a fourth XPE Ddb− cell strain, GM01389. Mutations were identified in the DDB2 gene in this strain. Because there are three potential nuclear localization signals in the p48 sequence, one of which is abolished by the mutation in XP82TO, fluorescence microscopy was used to determine the cellular localization of wild type and mutant p48. Finally, the relationships between DDB activity and p48 mRNA and protein levels in normal fibroblasts in response to UV damage were analyzed. The accompanying paper (19.Liu W. Nichols A.F. Graham J.A. Dualan R. Abbas A. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21429-21434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) investigates the cellular localization of p127 in both normal and XPE fibroblasts in response to UV damage.DISCUSSIONAlthough the proteins correlated with XPA, XPB, XPC, XPD, XPF, XPG, and XPV have been identified and studied, the XPE protein has remained elusive. One contributing factor is that XPE patients exhibit the mildest clinical signs of UV sensitivity and skin cancer of all the xeroderma pigmentosum groups. This is reflected biochemically in that cells from group E individuals have a relatively high level of nucleotide excision repair as determined by an unscheduled DNA synthesis level of 40–60%. Consequently, classification of XPE patients has been difficult, and functional complementation of XPE has not isolated the XPE gene.In 1988 Chu and Chang (3.Chu G. Chang E. Science. 1988; 242: 564-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) reported that a damage-specific DNA-binding protein was absent in cells from two XPE patients, XP2RO and XP3RO. However, further studies (4.Kataoka H. Fujiwara Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 1139-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 5.Keeney S. Wein H. Linn S. Mutat. Res. 1992; 273: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) discovered only one additional XPE strain, XP82TO, that lacked this binding activity, whereas cells from 13 other patients classified as XPE had normal levels of DDB activity. Three additional XPE Ddb− strains have since been reported (24.Otrin V.P. Kuraoka I. Nardo T. McLenigan M. Eker A.P.M. Stefanini M. Levine A.S. Wood R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3182-3190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the DDB activity is absent in only a subset of XPE patients, the relationship between XPE and the DDB protein is unclear. Is the DDB deficiency directly related to nucleotide excision repair? The fact that microinjection of the DDB heterodimer (p127, p48) purified from HeLa cells restored unscheduled DNA synthesis to Ddb− but not Ddb+ cells (17.Keeney S. Eker A.P.M. Brody T. Vermeulen W. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Linn S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4053-4056Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) suggested that DDB was indeed an “XPE factor.” In addition, the high affinity of DDB for many forms of DNA lesions implied that DDB was a damage recognition factor for NER.Cells from the XP2RO and XP3RO patients, who were second cousins, have a single base transition that gives rise to a R273H substitution in p48. A single base transition in XP82TO results in a K244E substitution. No DDB2 mutations were observed in the XPE Ddb+ strains, nor were any mutations found in theDDB1 (p127) gene in any of the XPE strains investigated (18.Nichols A.F. Ong P. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24317-24320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, it remained possible that these DDB2 mutations were not responsible for the Ddb− phenotype. For example. a third DDB subunit could be defective in all XPE strains.In this report we have used functional assays to demonstrate that the DDB2 mutations are directly responsible for the loss of DDB activity in the XP2RO, XP3RO, and XP82TO Ddb− strains. In addition, using human p48 overexpressed in and purified from insect cells we were able to restore DDB activity to extract prepared from a fourth XPE Ddb− strain, GM01389, which was recently reclassified by Otrin and coworkers (24.Otrin V.P. Kuraoka I. Nardo T. McLenigan M. Eker A.P.M. Stefanini M. Levine A.S. Wood R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3182-3190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, mutational analysis of cDNA and genomic sequences of the DDB2 gene in this strain identified compound heterozygous mutations: One allele has a L350P change, and the other allele has a deletion of Asn-349. No mutations were found in theDDB1 gene. Identification of DDB2 mutations in each of these four XPE Ddb− strains and the functional assays support the recommendation of Cleaver and colleagues (29.Cleaver J.E. Thompson L.H. Richardson A.S. States J.C. Hum. Mutat. 1999; 14: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) that XPE should be defined through molecular terms because of difficulties in assignment by complementation studies. By this definition, XPE would contain only those cell strains that have a mutation in DDB2.The question still remains as to the function(s) of DDB in the cell. The original proposal that DDB is a damage recognition factor in nucleotide excision repair has yet to be substantiated. DDB is not required in in vitro reconstitution DNA repair assays and can even inhibit excision of damage (16.Kazantsev A. Mu D. Nichols A.F. Zhao X. Linn S. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5014-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Possibly, the DDB heterodimer inhibits repair in vivo so as to modulate the rate of excision or allow damage bypass by a DNA polymerase. Because p48, but not p127, is induced by DNA-damaging agents (26.Vaisman A. Keeney S. Nichol A.F. Linn S. Chaney S.G. Oncol. Res. 1996; 9: 7-12Google Scholar), we analyzed the time response of p48 mRNA levels and DDB activity after UV irradiation of normal diploid fibroblasts. p48 mRNA levels peaked at 38 h, followed by a similar, almost 4-fold increase in DDB activity 48 h after UV irradiation. However, these peaks occur after a majority of DNA repair has been completed (25.Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1995: 285-288Google Scholar), suggesting an alternative role for DDB. (It is feasible, though unlikely, that this late induction could represent a replenishment of DDB once repair is complete and cell division resumes.)DDB p127 interacts with several viral transactivating proteins: protein X of hepatitis B virus (30.Lee T.-H. Elledge S.J. Butel J.S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Becker S.A. Lee T.-H. Butel J.S. Slagle B.L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 266-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the V proteins of paramyxovirus SV5, mumps virus, human parainfluenza virus 2, and measles virus (32.Lin G.Y. Paterson R.G. Richardson C.D. Lamb R.A Virology. 1998; 249: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). DDB can associate with the transcription factor, E2F1, and function as a transcriptional partner of E2F1, whereas XP2RO and XP82TO p48 mutant proteins are severely impaired in stimulating E2F1-activated transcription (28.Shiyanov P. Hayes S.A. Donepudi M. Nichols A.F. Linn S. Slagle B.L. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4935-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Watanabe and colleagues (33.Watanabe T. Sukegawa J. Sukegawa I. Tomita S. Iijima K. Oguchi S. Suzuki N.A.C. Greengard P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) reported that DDB p127 also binds to the cytoplasmic domain of the transmembrane protein, Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein (APP). They proposed that p127 may move between the cytosol and nucleus as part of a signal transduction process that regulates gene transcription in response to DNA damage. Because p48 transports p127 to the nucleus (28.Shiyanov P. Hayes S.A. Donepudi M. Nichols A.F. Linn S. Slagle B.L. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4935-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), a feasible model is that excess p127 is anchored in the cytoplasm by binding to APP. In response to damage, p48 mRNA levels increase, resulting in increased production of p48 protein. This de novo p48 may compete with APP for binding to p127 and transport it to the nucleus, as reflected by the observed increase in DDB activity after UV irradiation. XP2RO and XP82TO mutant p48 are defective in nuclear import of the large DDB subunit (28.Shiyanov P. Hayes S.A. Donepudi M. Nichols A.F. Linn S. Slagle B.L. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4935-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Hwang et al. (34.Hwang B.J. Toering S. Francke U. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4391-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) reported that the presence of p48 was not required for subsequent binding of p127 to DNA damage and that only a small fraction of DDB was a heterodimer either in solution or bound to DNA. Yet the DDB heterodimer is stable during purification (10.Keeney S. Chang G.J. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21293-21380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in this report we show elution characteristics during chromatography of human p127 overexpressed alone in insect cells that are very different from the heterodimer. Also DDB activity can be reconstituted only by mixing purified p127 and p48, and p48 acts stoichiometrically in binding to damaged DNA in vitro and apparently in vivo. However, although the heterodimer produces a distinct DNase I footprint on DNA substrates containing unique UV photoproducts (8.Reardon J.T. Nichols A.F. Keeney S. Smith C.A. Taylor J.-S. Linn S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21301-21308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the footprint for p127 alone indicates that both subunits need not be bound to damaged DNA. Hence, it is possible that, if bound to p48, and only after such binding, p127 can bind to DNA and remain bound even if p48 dissociates. However, the correlation of p48 and DDB induction by UV irradiation suggests that such a “catalytic” role for p48 may not normally exist in vivo. We have shown that the single base substitutions found in DDB2 of the XPE Ddb− strains XP2RO and XP82TO do not affect the nuclear localization of DDB p48. This observation, combined with the inability of these mutant p48 proteins to complement p127, suggests that the XPE Ddb−mutations affect the direct interaction of the two subunits that is required for both nuclear localization of the heterodimer and its subsequent binding to damaged DNA.The abundance of DDB (∼105 copies per cell: Ref 10.Keeney S. Chang G.J. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21293-21380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 5 D) implies that DDB plays an important role in the cell. Moreover, its specificity and high affinity for damaged DNA suggests it has a role in DNA damage responses, but its late induction after UV irradiation proposes alternative roles. The interacting subunits of DDB may couple transcription to DNA damage by sensing such damage, whereas the individual DDB subunits perform different functions in the cell. We expect that the purified individual DDB subunits will allow us to study the function(s) of both the heterodimer and the individual subunits in the multiple potential roles of DDB in transcription, DNA damage responses, and DNA repair. The rare human hereditary disease, xeroderma pigmentosum (XP),1 is characterized biochemically by defective nucleotide excision repair (NER), which manifests clinically as sensitivity to ultraviolet light and a high incidence of skin cancer. Based on fusion studies of cells from XP patients, seven NER-defective complementation groups (A through G) and a post-replication repair-deficient variant group (XPV) have been identified (1.Cleaver J.E.

Joysey V.C. Hum. Genet. 1989; 81: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Cell strains from a subset (Ddb−) of individuals carrying XP complementation group E (XPE) lack a damage-specific DNA binding (DDB) activity (3.Chu G. Chang E. Science. 1988; 242: 564-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 4.Kataoka H. Fujiwara Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Because DDB was reported to recognize many types of DNA lesions (6.Feldberg R.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 1133-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 7.Carew J.A. Feldberg R.S.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), DDB was originally expected to play a role in damage recognition prior to nucleotide excision repair. However, recent NER reconstitution studies have reported that DDB is not required in vitro (14.Mu D. Park C.H. Matsunaga T. Hsu D.S. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2415-2418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 15.Aboussekhra A. Biggerstaff M. Shivji M.K.K. Vilpo J.A. Moncollin V Podust V.N. Protic M. Hubscher U.

A. 1996; 93: 5014-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, microinjection of purified HeLa DDB heterodimer (p127, p48) into XPE cells restores in vivo DNA repair synthesis to normal levels in XPE Ddb− strains but not in XPE Ddb+ strains or in cells from other XP groups (17.Keeney S. Eker A.P.M. Brody T. Vermeulen W. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Linn S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4053-4056Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Sequencing of the cDNAs that encode the DDB heterodimer have identified single base mutations only in DDB2 (p48) of XPE Ddb− cells. In the Ddb− strains, XP2RO and XP3RO, a G → A transition at nucleotide +818 causes an R273H change in p48, whereas an A → G transition at nucleotide +730 causes a K244E change in XP82TO. Overexpression of wild type p48, but not of p127, in insect cells greatly increases DDB activity in extracts prepared from these cells, indicating that p48 is required for damage-specific DNA binding (18.Nichols A.F. Ong P. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24317-24320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have reconstituted human DDB activity in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay by combining insect extracts containing individually overexpressed wild type p127 and p48. Both extracts were required for damage-specific DNA binding activity, but extracts containing mutant XP2RO- and XP82TO-p48 polypeptides were unable to complement p127, demonstrating that the mutations inactivate DDB activity in these XPE Ddb− strains. The wild type human p127 and p48, which were overexpressed in insect cells, were purified by monitoring the reconstitution of DDB, and purified wild type p48 was able to restore DDB activity to an extract prepared from a fourth XPE Ddb− cell strain, GM01389. Mutations were identified in the DDB2 gene in this strain. Because there are three potential nuclear localization signals in the p48 sequence, one of which is abolished by the mutation in XP82TO, fluorescence microscopy was used to determine the cellular localization of wild type and mutant p48. Finally, the relationships between DDB activity and p48 mRNA and protein levels in normal fibroblasts in response to UV damage were analyzed. The accompanying paper (19.Liu W. Nichols A.F. Graham J.A. Dualan R. Abbas A. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21429-21434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) investigates the cellular localization of p127 in both normal and XPE fibroblasts in response to UV damage. DISCUSSIONAlthough the proteins correlated with XPA, XPB, XPC, XPD, XPF, XPG, and XPV have been identified and studied, the XPE protein has remained elusive. One contributing factor is that XPE patients exhibit the mildest clinical signs of UV sensitivity and skin cancer of all the xeroderma pigmentosum groups. This is reflected biochemically in that cells from group E individuals have a relatively high level of nucleotide excision repair as determined by an unscheduled DNA synthesis level of 40–60%. Consequently, classification of XPE patients has been difficult, and functional complementation of XPE has not isolated the XPE gene.In 1988 Chu and Chang (3.Chu G. Chang E. Science. 1988; 242: 564-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) reported that a damage-specific DNA-binding protein was absent in cells from two XPE patients, XP2RO and XP3RO. However, further studies (4.Kataoka H. Fujiwara Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 1139-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 5.Keeney S. Wein H. Linn S. Mutat. Res. 1992; 273: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) discovered only one additional XPE strain, XP82TO, that lacked this binding activity, whereas cells from 13 other patients classified as XPE had normal levels of DDB activity. Three additional XPE Ddb− strains have since been reported (24.Otrin V.P. Kuraoka I. Nardo T. McLenigan M. Eker A.P.M. Stefanini M. Levine A.S. Wood R.D. Mol. Cell.

No DDB2 mutations were observed in the XPE Ddb+ strains, nor were any mutations found in theDDB1 (p127) gene in any of the XPE strains investigated (18.Nichols A.F. Ong P. Linn S. J. Biol.

Moreover, mutational analysis of cDNA and genomic sequences of the DDB2 gene in this strain identified compound heterozygous mutations: One allele has a L350P change, and the other allele has a deletion of Asn-349.

However, further studies (4.Kataoka H. Fujiwara Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 1139-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 5.Keeney S. Wein H. Linn S. Mutat. Res. 1992; 273: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) discovered only one additional XPE strain, XP82TO, that lacked this binding activity, whereas cells from 13 other patients classified as XPE had normal levels of DDB activity. Three additional XPE Ddb− strains have since been reported (24.Otrin V.P. Kuraoka I. Nardo T. McLenigan M. Eker A.P.M. Stefanini M. Levine A.S. Wood R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3182-3190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the DDB activity is absent in only a subset of XPE patients, the relationship between XPE and the DDB protein is unclear. Is the DDB deficiency directly related to nucleotide excision repair? The fact that microinjection of the DDB heterodimer (p127, p48) purified from HeLa cells restored unscheduled DNA synthesis to Ddb− but not Ddb+ cells (17.Keeney S. Eker A.P.M. Brody T. Vermeulen W. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Linn S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4053-4056Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) suggested that DDB was indeed an “XPE factor.” In addition, the high affinity of DDB for many forms of DNA lesions implied that DDB was a damage recognition factor for NER. Cells from the XP2RO and XP3RO patients, who were second cousins, have a single base transition that gives rise to a R273H substitution in p48. A single base transition in XP82TO results in a K244E substitution. No DDB2 mutations were observed in the XPE Ddb+ strains, nor were any mutations found in theDDB1 (p127) gene in any of the XPE strains investigated (18.Nichols A.F. Ong P. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24317-24320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, it remained possible that these DDB2 mutations were not responsible for the Ddb− phenotype. For example. a third DDB subunit could be defective in all XPE strains. In this report we have used functional assays to demonstrate that the DDB2 mutations are directly responsible for the loss of DDB activity in the XP2RO, XP3RO, and XP82TO Ddb− strains. In addition, using human p48 overexpressed in and purified from insect cells we were able to restore DDB activity to extract prepared from a fourth XPE Ddb− strain, GM01389, which was recently reclassified by Otrin and coworkers (24.Otrin V.P. Kuraoka I. Nardo T. McLenigan M. Eker A.P.M. Stefanini M. Levine A.S. Wood R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3182-3190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, mutational analysis of cDNA and genomic sequences of the DDB2 gene in this strain identified compound heterozygous mutations: One allele has a L350P change, and the other allele has a deletion of Asn-349. No mutations were found in theDDB1 gene. Identification of DDB2 mutations in each of these four XPE Ddb− strains and the functional assays support the recommendation of Cleaver and colleagues (29.Cleaver J.E. Thompson L.H. Richardson A.S. States J.C. Hum. Mutat. 1999; 14: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) that XPE should be defined through molecular terms because of difficulties in assignment by complementation studies. By this definition, XPE would contain only those cell strains that have a mutation in DDB2. The question still remains as to the function(s) of DDB in the cell. The original proposal that DDB is a damage recognition factor in nucleotide excision repair has yet to be substantiated. DDB is not required in in vitro reconstitution DNA repair assays and can even inhibit excision of damage (16.Kazantsev A. Mu D. Nichols A.F. Zhao X. Linn S. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5014-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Possibly, the DDB heterodimer inhibits repair in vivo so as to modulate the rate of excision or allow damage bypass by a DNA polymerase. Because p48, but not p127, is induced by DNA-damaging agents (26.Vaisman A. Keeney S. Nichol A.F. Linn S. Chaney S.G. Oncol. Res. 1996; 9: 7-12Google Scholar), we analyzed the time response of p48 mRNA levels and DDB activity after UV irradiation of normal diploid fibroblasts. p48 mRNA levels peaked at 38 h, followed by a similar, almost 4-fold increase in DDB activity 48 h after UV irradiation. However, these peaks occur after a majority of DNA repair has been completed (25.Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1995: 285-288Google Scholar), suggesting an alternative role for DDB. (It is feasible, though unlikely, that this late induction could represent a replenishment of DDB once repair is complete and cell division resumes.) DDB p127 interacts with several viral transactivating proteins: protein X of hepatitis B virus (30.Lee T.-H. Elledge S.J. Butel J.S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Becker S.A. Lee T.-H. Butel J.S. Slagle B.L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 266-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the V proteins of paramyxovirus SV5, mumps virus, human parainfluenza virus 2, and measles virus (32.Lin G.Y. Paterson R.G. Richardson C.D. Lamb R.A Virology. 1998; 249: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). DDB can associate with the transcription factor, E2F1, and function as a transcriptional partner of E2F1, whereas XP2RO and XP82TO p48 mutant proteins are severely impaired in stimulating E2F1-activated transcription (28.Shiyanov P. Hayes S.A. Donepudi M. Nichols A.F. Linn S. Slagle B.L. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4935-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Watanabe and colleagues (33.Watanabe T. Sukegawa J. Sukegawa I. Tomita S. Iijima K. Oguchi S. Suzuki N.A.C. Greengard P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) reported that DDB p127 also binds to the cytoplasmic domain of the transmembrane protein, Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein (APP). They proposed that p127 may move between the cytosol and nucleus as part of a signal transduction process that regulates gene transcription in response to DNA damage. Because p48 transports p127 to the nucleus (28.Shiyanov P. Hayes S.A. Donepudi M. Nichols A.F. Linn S. Slagle B.L. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4935-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), a feasible model is that excess p127 is anchored in the cytoplasm by binding to APP. In response to damage, p48 mRNA levels increase, resulting in increased production of p48 protein. This de novo p48 may compete with APP for binding to p127 and transport it to the nucleus, as reflected by the observed increase in DDB activity after UV irradiation. XP2RO and XP82TO mutant p48 are defective in nuclear import of the large DDB subunit (28.Shiyanov P. Hayes S.A. Donepudi M. Nichols A.F. Linn S. Slagle B.L. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4935-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Hwang et al. (34.Hwang B.J. Toering S. Francke U. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4391-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) reported that the presence of p48 was not required for subsequent binding of p127 to DNA damage and that only a small fraction of DDB was a heterodimer either in solution or bound to DNA. Yet the DDB heterodimer is stable during purification (10.Keeney S. Chang G.J. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21293-21380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in this report we show elution characteristics during chromatography of human p127 overexpressed alone in insect cells that are very different from the heterodimer. Also DDB activity can be reconstituted only by mixing purified p127 and p48, and p48 acts stoichiometrically in binding to damaged DNA in vitro and apparently in vivo. However, although the heterodimer produces a distinct DNase I footprint on DNA substrates containing unique UV photoproducts (8.Reardon J.T. Nichols A.F. Keeney S. Smith C.A. Taylor J.-S. Linn S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21301-21308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the footprint for p127 alone indicates that both subunits need not be bound to damaged DNA. Hence, it is possible that, if bound to p48, and only after such binding, p127 can bind to DNA and remain bound even if p48 dissociates. However, the correlation of p48 and DDB induction by UV irradiation suggests that such a “catalytic” role for p48 may not normally exist in vivo. We have shown that the single base substitutions found in DDB2 of the XPE Ddb− strains XP2RO and XP82TO do not affect the nuclear localization of DDB p48. This observation, combined with the inability of these mutant p48 proteins to complement p127, suggests that the XPE Ddb−mutations affect the direct interaction of the two subunits that is required for both nuclear localization of the heterodimer and its subsequent binding to damaged DNA. The abundance of DDB (∼105 copies per cell: Ref 10.Keeney S. Chang G.J. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21293-21380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 5 D) implies that DDB plays an important role in the cell. Moreover, its specificity and high affinity for damaged DNA suggests it has a role in DNA damage responses, but its late induction after UV irradiation proposes alternative roles. The interacting subunits of DDB may couple transcription to DNA damage by sensing such damage, whereas the individual DDB subunits perform different functions in the cell. We expect that the purified individual DDB subunits will allow us to study the function(s) of both the heterodimer and the individual subunits in the multiple potential roles of DDB in transcription, DNA damage responses, and DNA repair.

Multiple amino acid sequence alignments suggest that PLDα and PLDβ both contain a Ca2+-dependent phospholipid-binding C2 domain near their N termini. In the present study, we expressed and characterized the putative C2 domains of PLDα and PLDβ, designated PLDα C2 and PLDβ C2, by CD spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry, and phospholipid binding assay. Both PLD C2 domains displayed CD spectra consistent with anticipated major β-sheet structures but underwent spectral changes upon binding Ca2+; the magnitude was larger for PLDβ C2. These conformational changes, not shown by any of the previously characterized C2 domains of animal origin, occurred at micromolar Ca2+ concentrations for PLDβ C2 but at millimolar levels of the cation for PLDα C2. PLDβ C2 exhibited three Ca2+-binding sites: one with a dissociation constant (K d) of 0.8 μm and the other two with a K d of 24 μm. In contrast, isothermal titration calorimetry data of PLDα C2 were consistent with 1–3 low affinity Ca2+-binding sites withK d in the range of 590–470 μm. The thermodynamics of Ca2+ binding markedly differed for the two C2 domains. Likewise, PLDβ C2 bound phosphatidylcholine (PC), the substrate of PLD, in the presence of submillimolar Ca2+concentrations, whereas PLDα C2 did so only in the presence of millimolar levels of the metal ion. Both C2 domains bound phosphatidylinoistol 4,5-bisphosphate, a regulator of PC hydrolysis by PLD. However, added Ca2+ displaced the bound phosphatidylinoistol 4,5-bisphosphate. Ca2+ and PC binding properties of PLDα C2 and PLDβ C2 follow a trend similar to the Ca2+ requirements of the whole enzymes, PLDα and PLDβ, for PC hydrolysis. Taken together, the results suggest that the C2 domains of PLDα and PLDβ have novel structural features and serve as handles by which Ca2+ differentially regulates the activities of the isoforms.

Activation of PLD in the cell generates signaling messengers and is involved in a wide range of cellular processes, including phytohormone action (1.Lu F. Zheng S.Q. Wang X.

Acta. 1999; 1439: 229-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The activity of PLD is tightly regulated, and its cellular regulation is often coordinated with the networks of cellular signaling machinery (6.Frohman M.A. Sung T.C. Morris A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 7.Wang X. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In plants, Ca2+ has been proposed to be an important regulator for PLD (7.Wang X. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). All PLDs cloned from plants require Ca2+ for activity. A positive correlation between increased cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels and increased PLD activity was indicated in plant tissues in which Ca2+ levels were perturbed, using various Ca2+-ATPase inhibitors and calmodulin antagonists (8.De Vrije T. Munnik T. J. Exp. Bot. 1997; 48: 1631-1637Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, plant PLDs display two distinct types of Ca2+dependence. PLDα represents the conventional PLD that requires Ca2+ in the millimolar range and can be active toward vesicles composed of phosphatidylcholine (PC) only (9.Qin W. Pappan K. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28267-28273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 10.Wang X. Xu L. Zheng L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20312-20317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This PLD has been purified, cloned, and characterized from several plant species (7.Wang X. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). PLDβ represents the newly identified PLD that is polyphosphoinositide-dependent and most active at micromolar ranges of Ca2+ (11.Pappan K. Zheng S. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7048-7054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 12.Pappan K. Qin W. Dyer J.H. Zheng L. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7055-7061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Little is known, however, about the mechanism by which Ca2+modulates PLD activity. Potentially, Ca2+ may associate directly with PLD, and such a binding could induce a conformational change in the enzyme to facilitate its binding to a membrane surface and/or its activation for catalysis. Alternatively, Ca2+may change the surface charge, potential, and/or shape of a membrane. In this case, a specific interaction between Ca2+ and PLD is not envisaged. Sequence analyses of several cloned plant PLDs have suggested possible ways by which Ca2+ can differentially control the activities of the isoforms. Each of the PLDs is inferred to have a Ca2+/phospholipid-binding C2 domain of approximately 130 amino acid residues near its N terminus (9.Qin W. Pappan K. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28267-28273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 13.Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). C2 domains have been identified in more than 100 proteins, most of which are involved in lipid metabolism, signal transduction, or membrane trafficking (13.Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J.

Alignment and molecular modeling of the N-terminal sequences of PLDα and PLDβ with known C2 structures (Figs. 1 and 2) suggest that PLDβ C2 has all the conserved Ca2+-binding residues, whereas PLDα C2 lacks at least two of these potential Ca2+ ligands due to substitution. This predicts a lower affinity toward Ca2+ for PLDα C2. Thus, the observed requirements of different levels of Ca2+ for catalysis by the whole enzymes, PLDα and PLDβ (9.Qin W. Pappan K. Wang X. J.

Furthermore, Ca2+ binding triggers unprecedented conformational changes in PLDα C2 and PLDβ C2, thus suggesting that these plant C2 domains are novel structural variants. The putative C2 domain of Arabidopsis PLDα corresponds to the amino acid sequence 8–151. A DNA fragment coding for this region was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (Perkin-Elmer Cetus) and inserted into vectors pET 15b (Novagen) and pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The pET vector was used for producing the C2 proteins with 6 histidine residues fused at the N terminus, and the pGEX vector was used for those fused with glutathioneS-transferase (GST) at the N terminus. For fragments inserted into the pET vector, an NdeI restriction site was added to the 5′-end, and a stop codon followed by a BamHI site was added to the 3′-end. To clone the DNA fragments into the pGEX vector, a BamHI site was incorporated into the 5′-end, and a stop codon followed by an EcoRI site was incorporated into the 3′-end. Similarly, the DNA region coding for ArabidopsisPLDβ C2 (amino acid residues 156–302) was generated by the polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pET and pGEX vectors. To increase the solubility of PLDβ C2, a loop region consisting of amino acid residues 173–190 was deleted from PLDβ C2 (Fig. 1), and the deletion was generated by a sequential polymerase chain reaction, as described previously (28.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley, New York1995: 8.51-8.59Google Scholar). The single cysteine residue, Cys-285, near the C-terminal end of the PLDβ C2 constructs was substituted with serine to minimize possible complications in solubility and refolding. The constructs were verified by DNA sequencing and transformed intoEscherichia coli BL21 or E. coli BL21 (DE3) for protein expression. The poly-His-fused C2 proteins were expressed inE. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen), and the GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21. The cells were grown at 37 °C to an absorbance of ∼1.0 at 600 nm and induced at 25 °C with isopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.2 mm for the GST fusion proteins and 1 mm for the poly-His fusion proteins. After overnight induction, the cells were harvested and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation, both the poly-His and GST fusion proteins were found in particulate fractions. To purify the His-tagged proteins, the particulate pellet isolated from 1 liter of culture was washed with a binding buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole at pH 8.0) and solubilized in the same binding buffer containing 8m urea. After centrifugation, the supernatant was passed through a 10-ml Ni2+-charged His-resin column equilibrated with the binding buffer. The column was thoroughly washed with a washing buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mNaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 8 m urea at pH 8.0. Proteins bound to the resin were eluted with a 1 mimidazole elution buffer. Urea in the denatured recombinant protein was diluted by adding the solution dropwise into a stirring buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) and 2.0 murea at 4 °C. The solution was kept at 4 °C for 1 h and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The protein solution was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, overnight at 4 °C and then concentrated by means of a negative pressure dialysis system (Spectrum). To remove the His tag, the solubilized protein was incubated with highly pure thrombin at a ratio of 1 unit of thrombin to 1 mg of fusion protein at room temperature for 8 h. To remove undigested fusion proteins, urea was added to the solution to a final concentration of 8m, and the solution was passed through a Ni2+-charged His-resin column. The C2 proteins without the tag did not bind to the resin and were refolded by passing through a Sephacryl S-100 gel filtration column (29.Ackers G.K. Adv. Protein Chem. 1970; 24: 342-343Google Scholar). The monomeric, refolded proteins were collected and concentrated by dialysis under a negative pressure. Purity of the proteins was tested by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (30.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) and reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The monomeric form of the proteins was confirmed by size-exclusion chromatography. The refolding of the fusion proteins and the isolated C2 domains was monitored by CD spectroscopy (31.Johnson W.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 7: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Protein molar concentrations were determined using ε280 values of 24,300 m−1cm−1 for PLDα C2 and 20,300m−1 cm−1for PLDβ C2, on the basis of their amino acid sequences and calculated molecular masses of 16,673 and 13,500 Da, respectively (32.Wada Y. Sobue K. Mastsuo T. Katakuse I. Kakiuchi S. Matsuda H. Hayshi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 832: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The GST fusion proteins were purified according to the procedure described previously (33.Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Bacteria were pelleted from a 50 ml culture, washed twice with a buffer (STE buffer: 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, pH 8.0) containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mmEDTA at pH 8.0, and suspended in 5 ml of STE buffer containing 200 μg/ml lysozyme. The suspension was incubated on ice for 30 min, and dithiothreitol and Sarkosyl (9% (w/v); Sigma) were added to the suspension to final concentrations of 5 mm and 1.5%, respectively. After mixing, the cell suspension was sonicated for 2 min and centrifuged at 27,200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Triton X-100 (20% v/v) was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 4%. The solution was then incubated with 600 μl of 50% (w/v) glutathione-agarose for 30 min at room temperature. The fusion protein-agarose beads in a column were washed with 20 volumes of STE buffer to remove unbound proteins, stored at 4 °C, and used within 2 weeks. CD spectra of PLDα C2 and PLDβ C2 were recorded with a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. Each sample was scanned 64 times to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. PLD C2 in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, was placed in a 1-cm cell, and Ca2+ or EGTA was added using a microsyringe (Hamilton). Reference CD spectra were recorded with the same series of Ca2+ solutions, but without the protein, and were subtracted from the corresponding protein spectra. The molar ellipticity was calculated using an analysis program supplied with the instrument. For Ca2+ titration, the molar ellipticity was determined at a specific UV wavelength as a function of the added metal ion concentration. Thermodynamic properties of Ca2+ binding by PLD C2 domains were measured by isothermal titration calorimetry using a MicroCal OMEGA calorimeter (34.Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2433) Google Scholar). PLDα C2 (0.05 mm) or PLDβ C2 (0.25 mm) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (Chelex-100 treated) was placed in a 1.38-ml sample cell. A syringe (100 or 250 μl) loaded with 10 mm standard CaCl2 solution (Fisher Scientific) was used for a series of automatic injections of 10 μl each into a protein solution. After each injection, a 5-min pause was allowed for reaching the baseline. Heat produced due to dilution was measured by injecting the Ca2+ solution into the sample cells from which PLD C2 proteins were omitted. For each titration step, the heat of dilution was subtracted from the corresponding Ca2+ binding data of the C2 domains. Data were fit to appropriate binding models and thermodynamic parameters determined from nonlinear least-squares fits, using the ORIGINTM software. A modified version of a previously described method (35.Davletov B.A. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26386-26390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was employed to determine the amounts of phospholipids bound to PLD C2 domains. A phospholipid mixture consisting of 250 μg of PC (egg yolk), 100 μg of phosphatidylserine (PS) (egg yolk), and 2 μCi of 3H-labeled PC (dipalmitoyl-glycero-3-P-[methyl-3H]choline, DuPont) in chloroform was dried under a stream of nitrogen. The dried lipids were resuspended in 1 ml of water by vigorous vortexing for 2 min, followed by sonication for 30 s on an ice bath. The lipid vesicles were centrifuged briefly to remove large aggregates. GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-agarose beads were suspended in 9 volumes of a binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, and the various concentrations of Ca2+to be tested. The buffered Ca2+ solutions were prepared by appropriate dilution of the standard Ca2+ solution with Chelex 100-treated buffer. Equal volumes of the agarose beads and PC/PS vesicles (50 μl each) were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 30 min with vigorous shaking. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with 1 ml of the binding buffer containing the test concentration of Ca2+. Lipids bound to the protein-agarose beads were quantitated by scintillation counts. GST bound to glutathione-agarose beads was used to determine background phospholipid binding. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Binding activity was expressed as cpm per unit of GST activity. A similar procedure was followed to determine phosphatidylinoistol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) binding by PLD C2domains as a function of Ca2+ concentration, using lipid vesicles made up of 400 μg of PIP2 mixed with 0.4 μCi of 3H-labeled PIP2(dipalmitoyl-glycero-3-P-[inositol-2-3H]inositol 4,5-bisphosphate, DuPont). The His-tagged PLDα C2 and PLDβ C2 were solubilized with urea, purified using a Ni2+-affinity column, refolded by step dilutions of urea, and subjected to size exclusion chromatography. PLDα C2 was found to exist as a monomer up to a concentration of 1 mg/ml. A workable concentration of refolded PLDβ C2 was difficult to attain, as the protein, in the absence of urea, precipitated at much lower concentrations (<100 μg/ml) than did PLDα C2. Addition of agents such as 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (Chaps), ammonium sulfate, and arginine did not increase solubility of the protein. In the presence of 4 m proline, which has been found to increase protein solubility (36.Sammuel D. Kumar T.K.S. Jayaraman G. Yang P.W. Yu C. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1997; 41: 235-242PubMed Google Scholar), PLDβ C2 remained in solution after urea concentration was decreased to 0.1 m by dilution with 6 m proline. However, PLDβ C2 aggregated when proline was removed by dialysis. Therefore, a deletion mutant, PLDβ C2Δ173–190, was constructed (Fig. 1) with the hope of improved solubility. Deletion of residues 173–190 made loop 1 of the mutant similar in length to that of cPLA2 C2 and was anticipated to have a minimal effect on the overall folding and function of PLDβ C2 on the basis of amino acid sequence alignment (Fig. 1) and molecular modeling (Fig. 2). Indeed, a dominant β-sheet structure of PLDβ C2Δ173–190 was indicated by CD spectroscopy (31.Johnson W.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 7: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that it was correctly refolded (Fig. 3). The deletion mutant possessed significantly improved solubility. PLDβ C2Δ173–190 was used in subsequent studies, as it remained a soluble monomer up to a concentration of 3 mg/ml. For brevity, the deletion mutant is referred to as PLDβ C2 throughout the text. The CD spectra of PLDα C2 and PLDβ C2 are consistent with proteins having dominant β-sheet structures (31.Johnson W.C. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 7: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Both PLDα C2 and PLDβ C2 exhibited spectral changes in response to titration of Ca2+ (Fig. 3). The CD-detected conformational changes occurred at millimolar levels of Ca2+ for PLDα C2 (Fig.3 A) but at micromolar levels of the metal ion for PLDβ C2 (Fig. 3 C). The negative peak in the 203–210 nm range and its shoulder in the 215–222 nm range both showed decreases in ellipticity with the addition of Ca2+, and the magnitude was greater for PLDβ C2. The CD spectral changes were specific to Ca2+, as Mg2+ had almost no effect (Fig. 3,A and C). The Ca2+-triggered conformational changes were reversible; addition of the chelator EGTA to Ca2+-bound PLDα C2 or PLDβ C2 reproduced the CD spectrum obtained of the Ca2+-free C2 domain (Fig. 3,B and D). These results suggest that the expressed PLDα C2 and PLDβ C2 are properly folded and undergo reversible conformational changes upon binding Ca2+. Irreversible spectral changes might imply trapping of metastable structures such as misfolded and/or partly folded conformer(s). Ca2+ binding by the two PLD C2s was monitored by measuring negative ellipticity at 208 nm for PLDα C2 and at 203 nm for PLDβ C2 as a function of the metal ion concentration (Fig.4). From the CD data, apparent dissociation constants of ∼1 mm and ∼80 μm are estimated for Ca2+ complexes with PLDα C2 and PLDβ C2, respectively. Thermodynamic properties of Ca2+ binding to PLDα C2 and PLDβ C2 were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry experiments (Fig. 5). In the case of PLDβ C2, the binding data (Fig. 5 A) are consistent with one high affinity site (K d = 0.8 μm) and two low affinity sites (K d = 24 μm). For PLDα C2, the microcalorimetric titration (Fig.5 B) could be carried out only with micromolar, rather than millimolar, protein solutions due to low solubility (1 mg/ml). The CD data yield an apparent dissociation constant of ∼1 mm for Ca2+-PLDα C2 complex (Fig. 4). Therefore, microcalorimetric titrations are best carried out with millimolar protein solutions in order to determine with certainty all the three binding parameters: number of binding sites (n), dissociation constants, and enthalpy change (34.Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2433) Google Scholar). In the present case, the titration data (Fig. 5 B) were fit to binding equations by assuming n = 1, 2, or 3. 2The following thermodynamic parameters were obtained from the least-squares fits of the experimental data with three different binding models: for n = 1,K d = 590 ± 10 μm; ΔH = 6.52 ± 0.07 kcal/mol; for n = 2,K d = 530 ± 10 μm; ΔH = 3.16 ± 0.04 kcal/mol; for n = 3,K d = 470 ± 20 μm; ΔH = 2.03 ± 0.04 kcal/mol. All the three cases appear equally feasible, with K d ranging from 580 μm for n = 1 to 470 μm forn = 3. Thus, it has not been possible to determine the number of binding sites on PLDα C2 unambiguously. However, the dissociation constants calculated are all in the millimolar range, irrespective of the number of binding sites assumed. This permits us to draw the valid conclusion that PLDα C2 has a lower affinity for Ca2+, relative to PLDβ C2. A striking difference was also observed between PLDα C2 and PLDβ C2 in the thermodynamics of Ca2+ binding (TableI). PLDβ C2 binds endothermically one Ca2"
https://openalex.org/W1989809800,"p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) is a histone acetyltransferase that plays an important role in the remodeling of chromatin and the regulation of gene expression. It has been shown to catalyze preferentially acetylation of the ε-amino group of lysine 14 in histone H3. In this study, the kinetic mechanism of PCAF was evaluated with a 20-amino acid peptide substrate derived from the amino terminus of histone H3 (H3-20) and recombinant bacterially expressed PCAF catalytic domain (PCAFcat). The enzymologic behavior of full-length PCAF and PCAFcat were shown to be similar. PCAF-catalyzed acetylation of the substrate H3-20 was shown to be specific for Lys-14, analogous to its behavior with the full-length histone H3 protein. Two-substrate kinetic analysis displayed an intersecting line pattern, consistent with a ternary complex mechanism for PCAF. The dead-end inhibitor analog desulfo-CoA was competitiveversus acetyl-CoA and noncompetitive versusH3-20. The dead-end analog inhibitor H3-20 K14A was competitiveversus H3-20 and uncompetitive versusacetyl-CoA. The potent bisubstrate analog inhibitor H3-CoA-20 was competitive versus acetyl-CoA and noncompetitiveversus H3-20. Taken together, these inhibition patterns support an ordered BiBi kinetic mechanism for PCAF in which acetyl-CoA binding precedes H3-20 binding. Viscosity experiments suggest that diffusional release of product is not rate-determining for PCAF catalysis. These results provide a mechanistic framework for understanding the detailed catalytic behavior of an important subset of the histone acetyltransferases and have significant implications for molecular regulation of and inhibitor design for these enzymes. p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) is a histone acetyltransferase that plays an important role in the remodeling of chromatin and the regulation of gene expression.

Histone acetyltransferases (HATs)1 appear to modulate gene expression by catalyzing targeted acetylation of the ε-amino group of lysine residues on histones and other proteins (1.Brown C.E.

Among the more exciting aspects of this emerging field is the recognition that protein substrates for HATs extend outside of the histone family and include such key transcription factors as p53 (4.Gu W.

Despite their importance, the molecular bases for substrate recognition and the catalytic mechanisms of the group of HAT enzymes have not been established. In this study we focus our attention on the histone acetyltransferase p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) (3.Schiltz R.L. Nakatani Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1470: M37-M53Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 12.Yang X.-J. Ogrryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). PCAF is a member of the GCN-5-related N-acetyltransferases (GNAT) superfamily that includes a variety of acetyltransferase enzymes such as serotonin N-acetyltransferase, gentamicinN-acetyltransferase, GCN-5, spermidineN-acetyltransferase, HAT 1, and approximately 150 other “motif A/B” acetyltransferases in the DNA sequence data base (13.Coon S.L.

Sci. 1997; 22: 154-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Of these superfamily members, the most well characterized mechanistically is serotonin N-acetyltransferase. It was shown to follow an ordered BiBi ternary complex mechanism where acetyl-CoA binds first, most likely with direct attack of the serotonin amine nitrogen on acetyl-CoA (17.DeAngelis J. Gastel J. Klein D.C. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3045-3050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 18.Khalil E. Cole P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6195-6196Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). By using viscosity experiments, the rate-determining step appears to be product release (19.Khalil E. De Angelis J. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30321-30327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Moreover, serotonin N-acetyltransferase appears to bind the substrate as the protonated (ammonium) species, and nucleophilicity of the amine seems to be important (19.Khalil E. De Angelis J. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30321-30327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The sequence homology among the superfamily members is relatively weak, and significant differences exist among their three-dimensional structures (13.Coon S.L. Roseboom P.H. Baler R. Weller J.L.

Sci. 1997; 22: 154-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Consequently, how related the serotonin N-acetyltransferase catalytic mechanism will be to that of other superfamily members is unclear. PCAF was discovered in 1996 as a histone acetyltransferase that interacts with the transcriptional coactivator p300, which is also a HAT (12.Yang X.-J. Ogrryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar, 20.Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y.

PCAF is a 90-kDa protein that contains several domains as outlined in Fig. 1. A high resolution x-ray structure of the PCAF HAT domain in a complex with acetyl-CoA shows the conserved structural features of the GNAT superfamily (22.Clements A. Rojas J.R. Trievel R.C. Wang L. Berger S.L. Marmorstein R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3521-3532Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Functions for the other PCAF domains including the bromodomain (23.Dhalluin C. Carlson J.E. Zeng L. He C. Aggarwal A.K. Zhou M.-M. Nature. 1999; 399: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar) are not yet understood, but they may mediate protein-protein interactions or alternatively allosterically regulate PCAF HAT activity. PCAF has been shown to catalyze highly selective acetylation of lysine 14 of histone H3 both in free histones and nucleosomes (24.Schiltz R.L. Mizzen C.A. Vassilev A. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. Nakatani Y.

In this report, we reveal several new aspects of the catalytic mechanism of and substrate recognition by PCAF using purified recombinant enzyme and a synthetic peptide substrate. We also describe a detailed analysis of the inhibition of PCAF by a potent and selective bisubstrate analog inhibitor (25.Lau O.D. Kundu T.K. Soccio R.E. Khalil E.M. Vassilev A. Nakatani Y.

Mass spectrometry experiments were performed on either a Perkin-Elmer Biosystems API150EX electrospray single quadrupole instrument or a Kratos Kompact MALDI4 (Manchester, UK) time-of-flight mass spectrometer. HPLC was done on Varian instruments with Varian reverse phase HPLC columns. The production of PCAFcat was carried out analogously to that described by Marmorstein and colleagues (22.Clements A.

Briefly, the human PCAF catalytic domain (amino acid residues 493–676) DNA was subcloned into a modified pET28a vector (confirmed by DNA sequencing), engineered so that the His6 tag could be cleaved by TEV protease (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the protein was overproduced in theEscherichia coli strain BL21DE3 (14.Wolf E.

A frozen permanent cell line was used to inoculate 2 × 30 ml of Luria broth in Erlenmeyer flasks containing kanamycin (25 μg/ml) and allowed to grow overnight at 37 °C in a floor shaker. This culture (10 ml) was used to inoculate each liter of Luria broth (total 6 liters) in flasks with kanamycin (25 μg/ml) and grown at 37 °C in a floor shaker until the A 595 = 0.5–0.6. The flasks were cooled to room temperature by standing at 4 °C for 15 min and then induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.2 mm final concentration). The culture was grown overnight in a floor shaker at 16 °C for approximately 20 h. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation (4 °C, 5000 × g, 5 min) and then resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer (50 mmNaHepes, pH 7.0, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The suspension was lysed by passage through a French pressure cell at 15,000 pounds/square inch. The insoluble protein and debris were removed by centrifugation (4 °C, 27,000 ×g, 30 min followed by 4 °C, 100,000 × g, 120 min), and the supernatant was quick frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The thawed solution was passed through 20 ml of chelating Sepharose resin (30 ml of suspension, washed with 60 ml of water, followed by 100 ml of 50 mm ZnSO4solution, and finally equilibrated by washing with 60 ml of IMAC 30 (20 mm NaHepes, pH 7.0, 1 m NaCl, 30 mmimidazole, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride)) in a 60-ml column packed with the aid of a peristaltic pump at a rate of 0.5–1 ml/min. The loaded resin was washed first with 80 ml of washing buffer A (20 mm NaHepes, pH 7.0, 1 m NaCl, 72.5 mm imidazole, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and then with 80 ml of washing buffer B (20 mmNaHepes, pH 7.0, 1 m NaCl, 98 mm imidazole, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Fractions of 10 ml were collected as the protein was eluted off with ∼60 ml of IMAC-EDTA buffer (20 mm NaHepes, pH 7.0, 1 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 200 mm imidazole, 100 mm EDTA). The PCAFcat-containing fractions (as determined by 12% SDS-PAGE) were combined and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C (M r 10,000 cut-off) against 1 liter of solution of 50 mm NaHepes, 250 mm NaCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. The dialyzed protein solution (volume = 65 ml) was treated with TEV protease (0.1 mg/ml final concentration) at 16 °C overnight. The excised His6 tag was removed by passing the protein solution through 20 ml of chelating Sepharose resin (loaded with 100 ml of 50 mmZnSO4) and washing the resin with 30 ml of IMAC-30 (20 mm NaHepes, pH 7.0, 1 m NaCl, 30 mmimidazole, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and then 50 ml of IMAC-200 (20 mm NaHepes, pH 7.0, 1 mNaCl, 200 mm imidazole, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The fractions containing the purified PCAFcat (>90% pure by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE) were combined and dialyzed against 1-liter solution of 25 mmNaHepes, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm dithiothreitol overnight at 4 °C. The solution was concentrated to a final volume of 20 ml (2.1 mg/ml as determined by Bradford assay) by Centricon ultrafiltration and then stored at −80 °C. Peptides were synthesized on an automated solid phase peptide synthesizer (Rainin, PS3) using the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) strategy and purified by preparative C-18 reversed phase HPLC (using a gradient of H2O:CH3CN:0.05% trifluoroacetic acid). H3-CoA-12 was prepared analogously to H3-CoA-20 according to previously described procedures (25.Lau O.D. Kundu T.K. Soccio R.E. Khalil E.M. Vassilev A. Nakatani Y. Roeder R.G. Cole P.A. Mol.

Briefly, substrate concentrations were 0.5–20 μmacetyl-CoA (NEN Life Science Products, 14C, 0.02 μCi/μl), 5–120 μm peptide, and buffer conditions included 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 50 μg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin. Reactions employed purified recombinant full-length PCAF or PCAFcat at concentrations of 0.1–100 nm as needed. Assays were carried out in 0.5-ml plastic tubes at 30 °C, and the reaction volumes were 30 μl. Reactions were initiated with enzyme or acetyl-CoA after allowing the other components to equilibrate at 30 °C, and reactions were quenched after 1–10 min with 6 μl of 6× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Mixtures were run out on 16% SDS Tris-Tricine polyacrylamide gels, dried, and radioactivity quantified by phosphorimage analysis (Molecular Dynamics) by comparing to known quantities of 14C-labeled bovine serum albumin standard (NEN Life Science Products). In all cases, background acetylation (in the absence of enzyme) was subtracted from the total signal. All assays were performed at least twice and duplicates generally agreed within 20%. Enzyme activities were demonstrated to be linear versus enzyme concentration and time in the ranges used. Rate measurements were based on initial conditions (less than 10% consumption of the limiting substrate). ForK m (apparent) measurements, a range of at least five substrate concentrations were employed at fixed concentration of the second substrate (10 μm acetyl-CoA or 100 μm H3-20). The data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten Equation 1, v=Vm·S/(Km+S)Equation 1 by using a non-linear least squares approach (Macintosh computer program-KaleidographTM), and the kinetic constants ± S.E. are reported in Table I.Table ISteady-state kinetic comparison of PCAF and PCAFcat HAT activity with H3-20 SubstrateEnzyme formAcetyl-CoAK m(app)H3-20K m(app)k cat(app)μmμms −1Full-length PCAF2.1 ± 0.610 ± 20.7 ± 0.1PCAFcat0.64 ± 0.1830 ± 32.8 ± 0.2Assays were carried out with fixed and near-saturating concentration of the second substrate, see “Materials and Methods” for details.

Choice of kinetic fit was based on a combination of visual inspection and comparison of standard errors and residuals for all three inhibition types applied to the data sets (26.Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar). The lines drawn through the data points in the figures are derived from the fitted equations above. Data for the dissociation rate constant (k diss) for the bisubstrate analog H3-CoA-20 were fitted to Equation 6, P=vs(t­{1−e−kdisst}/kdiss)Equation 6 where P is the concentration of acetylated product;v s is the steady-state velocity;k diss is the off rate for the inhibitor from the enzyme, and t is time (28.Morrison J.F.

PCAFcatacetylation of H3-20 was carried out on a preparative scale as follows: 300 μm H3-20, 300 μm acetyl-CoA, 1 μm PCAFcat, 5 mm phosphate (pH ∼7.5) mixed in 1 ml and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction mixture was injected immediately on to a preparative HPLC (C-18 reversed phase column) and separated using a H2O, CH3CN, 0.05% CF3CO2H gradient that showed predominantly one peak (>90%). The resultant product was lyophilized to dryness. The reaction product was analyzed by mass spectrometry. A peak consistent with the monoacetylated H3-20 peptide (+42 Da) was observed. Tryptic digestion of both the unmodified H3-20 and acetylated H3-20 peptide were examined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Tryptic digestions were performed by combining 2 μl of trypsin (1.0 μg/μl), 2 μl of peptide solution (control peptide, 100 pmol/μl; acetylated peptide, 25 μl of distilled water was added to dry sample) and 2 μl of buffer solution (25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8). The above reaction mixture (0.3 μl) was applied to the sample plate followed by 0.3 μl of the saturated α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix solution (1:1 (v/v) ethanol:water). The matrix was added in timed increments (1, 5, 10, and 60 min) and served to quench the enzymatic digestion. The mixture was allowed to air-dry (10 min) prior to introduction into the mass spectrometer. This product and an equivalent amount of unreacted H3-20 peptide were subjected to trypsin digestion followed by analysis using MALDI mass spectrometry (31.Zaluzec E.J. Gage D.A. Watson J.T. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 109-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Comparison of the tryptic fragments led to the unequivocal identification of Lys-14 as the site of acetylation. Previous work has shown that a bisubstrate analog based on the amino-terminal sequence of histone H3 is a potent inhibitor of full-length PCAF (25.Lau O.D. Kundu T.K. Soccio R.E. Khalil E.M. Vassilev A. Nakatani Y. Roeder R.G. Cole P.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In that study, it was observed that H3-CoA-20 (Fig. 2), a peptide CoA conjugate with the 20 amino-terminal residues of histone H3, was a potent PCAF inhibitor (IC50 ∼ 0.3 μm), whereas H3-CoA-7 was a comparatively weak inhibitor (IC50 > 50 μm) (25.Lau O.D. Kundu T.K. Soccio R.E. Khalil E.M. Vassilev A. Nakatani Y. Roeder R.G. Cole P.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 589-595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, an x-ray structure of the PCAF homolog was reported in which an 11-amino acid peptide co-crystallized with GCN-5 (32.Rojas J.R. Trievel R.C. Zhou J. Mo Y. Li X. Berger S.L. Allis C.D. Marmorstein R. Nature. 1999; 401: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Consequently, the 12-residue peptide-CoA conjugate (H3-CoA-12) was prepared, but this too was found to be only a weak PCAF inhibitor (IC50 ∼50 μm). From this finding, it was deduced that greater than 12 residues but less than or equal to 20 residues are likely necessary for high affinity binding. We thus investigated the corresponding unmodified H3-related peptide (H3-20) as a PCAF substrate. As with the previously described histone acetylation assay, [14C]acetyl-CoA was used as substrate, and radioactive 14C incorporation into the peptide product was determined. Separation and quantification was achieved using a 16% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE followed by phosphorimage analysis. In this way, it was found that H3-20 afforded a reasonably sharp band (data not shown) that was readily quantified. Furthermore it was found that, unlike with the case of histones, PCAF enzyme activity was linear with respect to both enzyme concentration (0.5–5 nm range) and time (up to 10 min). It was therefore possible to measurek cat (0.7 s−1) andK m values for acetyl-CoA (2.1 μm) and H3-20 (10 μm) (see TableI). Given the difficulty in obtaining large quantities of full-length PCAF from eukaryotic expression systems, we turned to the study of recombinant PCAF catalytic domain (PCAFcat) that was overproduced in E. coli (22.Clements A. Rojas J.R. Trievel R.C. Wang L. Berger S.L. Marmorstein R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3521-3532Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). PCAFcat was inhibited by H3-CoA-20 with a similar IC50 to full-length PCAF (data not shown). Steady-state kinetic studies showed that it had similar but non-identical parameters using H3-20 peptide as substrate. In particular for PCAFcat, the apparent kcatwas approximately 4-fold greater, the apparent K mfor H3-20 substrate was about 3-fold higher, and the apparentK m for acetyl-CoA was about 3-fold lower compared with full-length PCAF (see Table I). Because of the relatively small magnitude of the differences, we felt confident that mechanistic and substrate selectivity parameters determined for PCAFcat HAT activity would likely be relevant for f"

Thrombin converts TAFI to a carboxypeptidase B-like enzyme (TAFIa) by cleaving at Arg92 in a process accelerated by the cofactor, thrombomodulin. TAFIa attenuates fibrinolysis. TAFIa can be inactivated by both proteolysis by thrombin and spontaneous temperature-dependent loss of activity. The identity of the thrombin cleavage site responsible for loss of TAFIa activity was suggested to be Arg330, but site-directed mutagenesis of this residue did not prevent inactivation of TAFIa by thrombin. In this study we followed TAFI activation and TAFIa inactivation by thrombin/thrombomodulin in time and characterized the cleavage pattern of TAFI using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. Mass matching of the fragments revealed that TAFIa was cleaved at Arg302. Studies of a mutant R302Q-TAFI confirmed identification of this thrombin cleavage site and, furthermore, suggested that inactivation of TAFIa is based on its conformational instability rather than proteolytic cleavage at Arg302.

TAFIa down-regulates fibrinolysis presumably by removing C-terminal lysines from fibrin that is already partially degraded by plasmin. Those lysines act as ligands for the lysine-binding sites of plasminogen and tissue-type plasminogen activator (9.Suenson E. Lutzen O. Thorsen S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 140: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Removal of the lysines attenuates the fibrin cofactor function of tissue-type plasminogen activator mediated plasminogen activation, resulting in prevention of accelerated plasmin formation and subsequent down-regulation of fibrinolysis (10.Redlitz A. Tan A.K. Eaton D.L. Plow E.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2534-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of TAFI regulation has been studied extensively, its mechanism of inactivation is still poorly understood. TAFI shows ∼40% sequence homology to tissue procarboxypeptidases, that are activated as a result of a single-site cleavage by trypsin-like enzymes that release the activation peptides (11.Tan A.K. Eaton D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5811-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 12.Burgos F.J. Salvà M. Villegas V. Soriano F. Mendez E. Avilés F.X.

Upon incubation of TAFI with trypsin, TAFIa activity first increased and then decreased (2.Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in contrast to tissue carboxypeptidases which are not inactivated by trypsin. The trypsin-cleavage sites in TAFI were identified by SDS-PAGE and sequencing (2.Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TAFI was not only cleaved at Arg92 but also at Arg330. The latter cleavage yielded a 25-kDa inactive fragment and a C-terminal polypeptide of 71 amino acids. Similar cleavage patterns were found upon incubation of TAFI with either plasmin or thrombin (2.Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When 125I-TAFI was incubated with thrombin, the generation of a 35-kDa fragment became apparent. During the inactivation, this fragment was further proteolyzed into 25- and 14-kDa fragments (1.Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The N-terminal residue of the 25-kDa band was identified as Ala93. A TAFI mutant was generated in which Arg330 was changed into Gln and compared with both wild type recombinant TAFI and plasma-derived TAFI (16.Boffa, M., and Nesheim, M. E. (1997) Thromb. Haemostasis, Suppl. 596Google Scholar). Upon incubation with thrombin/thrombomodulin, the R330Q-TAFI mutant was activated and inactivated at similar rates as the two wild type forms. Besides by proteolysis by thrombin, TAFIa is also inactivated by spontaneous, temperature-dependent inactivation (3.Wang W. Hendriks D.F. Scharpé S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15937-15944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol.

The intrinsic fluorescence of TAFIa was quenched during incubation at 37 °C, suggesting that the decrease in activity is due to conformational changes of TAFIa (17.Boffa M.B. Wang W. Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2127-2135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We studied the mechanism of proteolytic activation of TAFI and inactivation of TAFIa by thrombin/thrombomodulin using HPLC in combination with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). Furthermore, we analyzed a mutant form of TAFI in which the putative thrombin cleavage site at Arg302 was altered. Fresh frozen plasma was obtained from the local blood bank. Bovine serum albumin, hippuryl-Arg, and cyanuric chloride were purchased from Sigma. CNBr-activated Sepharose, Protein G-Sepharose, Q-Sepharose, and PD-10 Sephadex G-25M columns were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Rabbit lung thrombomodulin was purchased from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT), HPLC grade acetonitrile from Fisher (Pittsburgh, PA), trifluoroacetic acid from Halocarbon (River Edge, NJ), 1,4-dioxane and 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid from Aldrich Chemicals Co. (Milwaukee, WI), and H-d-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethylketone (PPACK) from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). PefablocSC, restriction enzymes and DNA polymerase were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). Thrombin was a generous gift from Dr. W. Kisiel (University of New Mexico, Albequerque, NM). Dulbecco's modified medium/F-12 nutrients mixture, penicillin, streptomycin, and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Paisley, United Kingdom). Other chemicals used were the best grade available. The TAFI cDNA I.M.A.G.E. Consortium Clone ID 194171 (19.Lennon G.G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulos M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the forward primerTTTCTCGAGTCTAGA GCCACCATGAAGCTTTGCAGCCTTG (Kozak sequence underlined, XhoI and XbaI sites in italic) and the reverse primer CGGGGTACCTTAAACATTCCTAATGAC (KpnI site in italic). Polymerase chain reactions (100 μl) contained approximately 50 ng of each primer, 200 μmdNTPs, 2 ng of template DNA, and 5 units of Pwo polymerase. The polymerase chain reaction cycling conditions were as follows: 1 min 95 °C, 1 min 55 °C and 2 min 72 °C for 25 cycles. The polymerase chain reaction product was incubated with 2 units ofTaq polymerase and 200 μm dATPs at 72 °C for 30 min to generate 3′ A overhangs for cloning it into the PCRRII-TOPO vector according to the manufacturers recommendations. TAFI was excised from this vector usingXhoI and KpnI and ligated into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The Arg302 to Gln mutation (R302Q-TAFI) was generated according to the QuikChangeTM Site-directed mutagenesis kit protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), using the forward primer GTGTTTCCATATTCGTATACACAAAGTAAAAGCAAAGACC and the reverse primer GGTCTTTGCTTTTACTTTGTGTATACGAATATGGAAACAC (mutated base underlined). Both constructs were confirmed by sequencing, and were found to contain the Thr147 isoform of TAFI (20.Zhao L. Morser J. Bajzar L. Nesheim M. Nagashima M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Baby hamster kidney cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 nutrients mixture supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin, at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2. Transfections were performed as described previously (21.Meijers J.C. Davie E.W. Chung D.W. Blood. 1992; 79: 1435-1440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One day after transfection, G418 (1 mg/ml) was added as selecting agent. Ten days later, surviving clones were picked and TAFI expression was detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for TAFI (22.Mosnier L.O. Von dem Borne P.A. Meijers J.C. Bouma B.N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Stably expressing clones were cultured in 175-cm2 flasks. Once cells had grown to confluency, the medium was changed to UltraCHO (30 ml/flask, BioWhittaker, MD). The medium was refreshed twice a week for 3 weeks. The media were pooled, PefablocSC was added to 0.2 mm and stored at −20 °C until use. Fresh frozen citrated human plasma was obtained from the local blood bank. One unit of plasma (∼300 ml) was supplemented with 5 mm benzamidine-HCl, 3 mmEDTA, 0.05 mg/ml Polybrene, and 0.1 m ε-aminocaproic acid (ε-ACA) and applied to a PD-10 Sephadex G-25M column linked to a CNBr-activated Sepharose column to which a monoclonal antibody directed against TAFI (MoAb Nik-9H10 (22.Mosnier L.O. Von dem Borne P.A. Meijers J.C. Bouma B.N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), 1 mg/ml, 5 ml) was coupled. Both columns were equilibrated in TBS (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) supplemented with the protease inhibitors mentioned above. Unbound proteins were washed away with 10 bed volumes of 0.5 m NaCl in TBS with protease inhibitors. The protease inhibitors were removed by washing the column with 50 mmTris, pH 7.4. Bound protein was eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.7. The eluate was collected in 1/10 (v/v) 1 m Tris, pH 9.0. This procedure was repeated and elution fractions of two units of plasma with an A 280 > 0.1 were pooled, diluted 3 times in H2O, and applied to a protein G-Sepharose column to remove traces of IgG. The nonadherent material was applied to a Q-Sepharose column equilibrated in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Unbound protein was washed away with equilibration buffer until theA 280 < 0.01. Bound protein was eluted from the Q-Sepharose column with a linear gradient (0–250 mm NaCl in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4). Fractions containing TAFI, as determined with a TAFI enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (22.Mosnier L.O. Von dem Borne P.A. Meijers J.C. Bouma B.N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), were pooled and stored at −70 °C. rTAFI and R302Q-TAFI were purified by applying the pooled cell culture media to a PD-10 Sephadex G-25M column linked to the MoAb Nik-9H10 Sepharose column. Both columns were equilibrated in TBS and washed with 0.5 mNaCl in TBS. Bound protein was eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.7, and collected in 1/10 (v/v) 1 m Tris, pH 9.0. TAFI concentrations were determined with a TAFI enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (22.Mosnier L.O. Von dem Borne P.A. Meijers J.C. Bouma B.N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and with a BCA kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. A mixture of thrombin (20 nm), thrombomodulin (5 nm), CaCl2(5 mm), and purified TAFI (2.8 or 5.4 μm) was incubated at 37 °C and aliquots were removed at various time points and added to PPACK (30 μm) to inhibit thrombin activity. Experiments were performed in the presence and absence of 5 mm ε-ACA. To distinguish between proteolytic inactivation by thrombin and spontaneous inactivation of TAFIa, thrombin activity was inhibited after 10 min by the addition of 30 μmPPACK. At several time points aliquots were taken for measurement of TAFIa activity, SDS-PAGE, or mass spectrometral analysis. The TAFIa activity assay was performed essentially as described (22.Mosnier L.O. Von dem Borne P.A. Meijers J.C. Bouma B.N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 829-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Briefly, aliquots of the activation mixtures were diluted to a final concentration of 0.2 μmTAFI (0.4 μm R302Q-TAFI) in a mixture of PPACK (30 μm) and hippuryl-Arg (4 mm) in TBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin. After thorough mixing, substrate conversion was allowed for 10 min at room temperature, stopped by 1 m HCl (20 μl), and an equivalent volume of 1 m NaOH was added. Then 25 μl of 1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) and 30 μl of 6% cyanuric chloride dissolved in 1,4-dioxane were added. After the color was developed under extensive vortexing, samples were centrifuged (2 min, 14,000 rpm) to remove excess cyanuric chloride and denatured protein. One-hundred μl of the supernatant was transferred to a 96-well microtiter plate. Absorbance was measured at 405 nm in a multiscan photometer (V max reader, Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). TAFI (100 μl, 5.4 μm) was activated for 0, 10, 30, 60, or 120 min with thrombin, thrombomodulin, and CaCl2 as described above and applied to a C4 column (5 μm, 0.46 × 15 cm) connected to a Hewlett-Packard HPLC 1050 system equilibrated in H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. A linear gradient from 0 to 60% acetonitrile in H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (1 ml/min, 2%/min) was used to elute bound protein. Eluting peaks were collected separately and lyophilized. Lyophilized HPLC samples were dissolved in 5 μl of 45% acetonitrile in H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, extensively vortexed, and subjected to mass spectral analysis. MALDI-MS was performed on a Dynamo DY-100 mass spectrometer (Thermo BioAnalysis) using 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as a matrix. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was performed on an API-III triple quadrupole electrospray mass spectrometer (PE-Sciex). From the experimental mass to charge (m/z) ratios from all the observed protonation states of the protein, the mass was calculated using MacSpec software (Sciex). The mass found for TAFIa (35,808 Da fragment) was used to calibrate MALDI-MS spectra. Theoretical masses of proteins and protein fragments were calculated using MacProMass software (Beckman Research Institute, Duarte, CA) and Protein Analysis Worksheet Software, PAWS 6.0b2. Aliquots of the activation mixtures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15%) under reducing conditions. For N-terminal sequencing the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and sequenced according to the Edman degradation method on a Perkin-Elmer/Applied Biosystems type 476A. Sequencing was performed by the Utrecht Sequence center. To investigate the regulation of TAFIa activity, TAFI was incubated with thrombin, thrombomodulin, and CaCl2 at 37 °C. At various time points aliquots were taken from the activation mixture, thrombin activity was inhibited by the addition of PPACK and TAFIa activity toward the substrate hippuryl-Arg was measured. Under these conditions, maximal TAFIa activity was reached within 5 min, after which the activity decreased (Fig. 1). To identify the proteolytic fragments generated upon activation and inactivation by thrombin/thrombomodulin, we analyzed samples of the activation mixtures after 0, 10, 30, 60, and 120 min by HPLC (Fig.2 A) and MALDI-MS (Fig.2 B). At 0 min, one major peak on the HPLC spectrum was observed, with a molecular mass of 55.6 kDa on the MALDI spectrum. This corresponds with the molecular mass of TAFI of ±60 kDa as measured on SDS-PAGE (2.Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 55.6-kDa peak was broad, reflecting the heterogeneity of TAFI glycosylation. After 10 min activation, the HPLC spectrum revealed two additional peaks (peak 2 and 3) compared with the starting material. Peak 3 contained a fragment of 19.4 kDa. This fragment, like the 55.6-kDa protein, appeared as a broad peak on the MALDI spectrum, reflecting a heterogeneous glycosylated protein. TAFI has four potentialN-linked glycosylation sites located in its activation peptide, Asp22, Asp51, Asp63, and Asp86 (2.Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the 19.4-kDa fragment is most likely the N-terminal activation peptide (amino acid 1–92). Peak 2 yielded a mass of 35.8 kDa and a small amount of a 24.5-kDa fragment on MALDI-MS. The peaks on the MALDI spectrum were sharp, indicating that these fragments were homogenous and not glycosylated. The mass of the fragment in HPLC peak 2 was analyzed by ESI-MS and revealed a molecular mass of 35,808 ± 9 Da (Fig.3), which corresponds to the mass of TAFIa. This mass was used to calibrate the masses found by MALDI-MS, whenever the 35.8-kDa fragment was present in the sample. After 30 min, TAFIa activity was no longer detectable (Fig. 1). The HPLC spectrum showed the same peaks as after 10 min with one additional peak, peak 4, which appeared as a shoulder of peak 2. Peaks 2 and 4, analyzed together by MALDI-MS, contained 2 fragments of 35.8 and 24.5 kDa. The amount of the 24.5-kDa fragment had increased considerably compared with 10-min TAFI activation, whereas the 55.6-kDa TAFI peak had decreased. After 60 min peaks 2 and 4 containing the 24.5- and 35.8-kDa forms were the major peaks on HPLC and MALDI. After a 120-min incubation, the major fragment found was the 24.5-kDa fragment whereas minor amounts of the starting material and the 35.8-kDa form were still detected. Peak 5 was also analyzed, it contained a 11.1-kDa polypeptide. To identify the proteolytic fragments within the TAFI sequence, the experimentally obtained masses were matched to theoretical masses. In addition, the N-terminal sequences of the fragments were determined. The masses of the 55.6- and 19.4-kDa proteins could not be calculated due to the presence of glycosylated residues. The observed 55.6-kDa protein corresponded to the reported mass of TAFI (2.Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and started with TAFI's N-terminal sequence Phe-Gln-Ser-Gly-Gln, thus confirming its identity. The 19.4-kDa fragment most likely represented the activation peptide (Phe1-Arg92). The observed 35,808 ± 9 Da fragment (ESI-MS) matched to the calculated mass of TAFIa (Ala93-Val401, 35,813 Da), starting with the sequence Ala-Ser-Ala-Ser-Tyr-Tyr-Glu. The N terminus of the 24.5-kDa fragment was identical to that of the 35.8-Da fragment and its experimental mass (average mass of 4 measurements 24,494 Da) corresponded to the calculated mass of a fragment spanning from Ala93 to Thr301 (24,526 Da), rather than from Ala93 to Arg302 (24,682 Da). The observed 11.1-kDa fragment was matched to the fragment spanning from Ser303 to Val401 (theoretical mass 11,149 Da) and its N-terminal sequence, Ser303-Lys-Ala-Lys-Asp-His, was in agreement with this. The results suggest that thrombin proteolyzed TAFIa at Arg302, after which Arg302was cleaved off by the carboxypeptidase B activity of TAFIa itself. The results are summarized in Table I.Table IMass analysis and fragment identification of TAFI cleavage fragmentsFragmentTheoretical massExperimental massN-terminal sequenceDaPhe1-Val40145,99955.6 kDaPhe-Gln-Ser-Gly-GlnPhe1-Arg9210,20019.4 kDaNDaND, not determined.Ala93-Val40135,81335,808 DaAla-Ser-Ala-Ser-Tyr-Tyr-GluAla93-Thr30124,52624,494bAverage mass of 4 MALDI-MS measurements.

Open table in a new tab Theoretical masses of protein fragments based on average isotope composition were calculated and matched to experimental masses. For proteins containing the activation peptide (residues 1–92) masses are calculated without the carbohydrate content. The identity of the fragments was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing. Comparison of the appearance and disappearance of the activity with the generation of fragments indicated that the presence of TAFIa did not correlate very well with the presence of the 35.8-kDa form. The 35.8-kDa fragment was present for at least 60 min, whereas the activity was no longer detectable after 30 min. Analysis of the reaction mixture under reducing conditions on SDS-PAGE yielded similar molecular weight fragments as obtained under nonreducing conditions with MALDI-MS. This suggests that the 35.8-kDa form of TAFIa was inactivated spontaneously, without detectable proteolytic cleavage. To study the discrepancy between the presence of the 35.8-kDa fragment and TAFIa activity, TAFI was activated for 10 min by thrombin/thrombomodulin whereafter thrombin activity was inhibited by PPACK. In this way, proteolytic inactivation of TAFIa by thrombin was prevented, whereas spontaneous inactivation was allowed. TAFIa activity and fragment formation were analyzed in time by the activity assay (Fig. 4A) and SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4 B), respectively. In the absence of PPACK, proteolysis continued whereas in the presence of PPACK, no further proteolysis was observed (Fig. 4 B). Despite the absence of proteolytic fragmentation, the rate of TAFIa inactivation in the presence of PPACK was identical to the rate of TAFIa inactivation in the absence of PPACK (Fig. 4 A). Addition of ε-ACA, which was shown before to prevent spontaneous inactivation of TAFIa (11.Tan A.K. Eaton D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5811-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 17.Boffa M.B. Wang W. Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2127-2135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar,18.Nesheim M.E. Boffa M.B. Wang W. Fibrinolysis. 1996; 10: 126Google Scholar), resulted in reduced rates of inactivation both in the presence and absence of PPACK (Fig. 4 A). Presence of ε-ACA seemed to slow down proteolysis in the absence of PPACK (Fig. 4 B). These experiments suggest, in agreement with the results obtained with the MALDI-MS, that inactivation of TAFIa takes place in a process involving spontaneous inactivation rather then proteolysis. The role of proteolytic inactivation of TAFIa by thrombin was investigated by analysis of a mutant form of TAFI in which the putative cleavage site Arg302 was changed to Gln (R302Q-TAFI). R302Q-TAFI exhibited activity upon incubation with thrombin/thrombomodulin toward the substrate hippuryl-Arg (Fig.5 A), although its specific activity was approximately half that of either rTAFI or plasma-derived TAFI. SDS-PAGE analysis of the activation mixtures of R302Q-TAFI and rTAFI at the indicated time points (Fig. 5 B), showed that the 35.8-kDa fragment of R302Q-TAFIa was not proteolyzed by thrombin, even when 10 times higher concentrations of thrombin/thrombomodulin were used. This suggested that Arg302 is indeed the major cleavage site involved in proteolytic degradation of TAFIa by thrombin/thrombomodulin. Furthermore, this suggested that cleavage at Arg302 is not involved in TAFIa inactivation. As was observed for plasma-derived TAFI, the presence of ε-ACA stabilized R302Q-TAFIa and rTAFIa and resulted in the generation of more TAFIa activity. TAFI is activated by thrombin in a process that is stimulated by thrombomodulin. Inactivation of TAFIa was first reported to take place by proteolytic cleavage at Arg330 by thrombin, plasmin, and trypsin. However, a mutant form of TAFIa in which Arg330was replaced by Gln was still inactivated by thrombin/thrombomodulin, indicating that cleavage at Arg330 was not responsible for inactivation (16.Boffa, M., and Nesheim, M. E. (1997) Thromb. Haemostasis, Suppl. 596Google Scholar). Inactivation of TAFIa was also reported to take place in a spontaneous temperature-dependent reaction, that did not involve proteolysis (3.Wang W. Hendriks D.F. Scharpé S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15937-15944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol.

To study the process of inactivation of TAFIa we incubated TAFI with thrombin/thrombomodulin and correlated the formation of proteolytic fragments with the activation of TAFI and inactivation of TAFIa. The activation of TAFI was shown to result from cleavage at Arg92, releasing a 19.4-kDa polypeptide from the 55.6-kDa proenzyme. Activation of tissue procarboxypeptidases, which show homology to TAFI, is also achieved by trypsin cleavage of an activation peptide (11.Tan A.K. Eaton D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5811-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 12.Burgos F.J. Salvà M. Villegas V. Soriano F. Mendez E. Avilés F.X.

Sariano F. Mendez E. Avilés F.X. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Both the 55.6-kDa TAFI and 19.4-kDa activation peptide appeared heterogeneous on MALDI-MS spectra, in contrast to the homogeneous 35,808 Da fragment that was identified as TAFIa by ESI-MS and N-terminal amino acid analysis. This is in agreement with the presence of four potential Asn-linked glycosylation sites in the activation peptide, whereas no glycosylation sites are present in the 35.8-kDa TAFIa form. The 35.8-kDa form of TAFIa was further proteolyzed by thrombin into 24.5-kDa and 11.1-kDa polypeptides. The N terminus of the 24.5-kDa fragment was Ala93 and the N terminus of the 11.1-kDa fragment was Ser303, indicating that cleavage had taken place at Arg302. The 24.5-kDa fragment, however, matched the theoretical mass of a fragment spanning amino acids Ala93 to Thr301, rather than Ala93to Arg302. This apparent discrepancy is most likely a result of cleavage of the C-terminal Arg302 by the carboxypeptidase activity of TAFIa itself. Our results thus suggest that the major thrombin/thrombomodulin cleavage site in TAFIa, is Arg302. This was supported by a recombinant TAFI mutant in which Arg302 was replaced by Gln. R302Q-TAFIa was not proteolyzed by thrombin/thrombomodulin into the 24.5- and 11.1-kDa fragments indicating that Arg302 is indeed the major cleavage site of thrombin/thrombomodulin in TAFIa. This is in contrast to previous reports that identified Arg330 as the major cleavage site (2.Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, trypsin and plasmin were used in a part of those studies and it is possible that those enzymes cleaved TAFIa at different sites then Arg302. In addition, small differences in molecular weight might have been undetectable on SDS-PAGE, when plasmin, trypsin, and thrombin/thrombomodulin cleavage patterns were compared. It should be noted that thrombin/thrombomodulin contains both free thrombin and thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. There was a discrepancy between the time course for loss of TAFIa activity and the persistent presence of the 35.8-kDa polypeptide that is considered to be the activated form of TAFI. Notably, the fragment was still present at times that TAFIa activity was no longer detectable. This was previously reported (8.Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) and explained by intrinsic instability of TAFIa, suggesting that inactivation of TAFIa can take place by a process that does not involve proteolysis. In agreement with this, we found that R302Q-TAFIa, which cannot be cleaved at Arg302, was still inactivated. This strongly suggests that inactivation of TAFIa does not require any proteolytic cleavage but can be entirely caused by conformational instability of TAFIa. This hypothesis was further supported by experiments in which thrombin activity was inhibited by PPACK after activation of TAFI. Inactivation of TAFIa continued at the same rate as in the absence of PPACK, despite the fact that proteolysis by thrombin was prevented, suggesting that cleavage at Arg302 was not essential for inactivation. Furthermore, ε-ACA was shown to stabilize TAFIa, whereas proteolytic cleavage still continued at a slower rate. Our results indicate that inactivation of TAFIa is the result of the conformational instability of TAFIa and not a direct result of proteolysis of TAFIa. It is possible that the conformational changes that take place as a result of the conformational instability make the inactivated 35.8-kDa form more susceptible to proteolysis. The mechanism by which ε-ACA stabilizes TAFIa is unknown, but is likely to involve lysine-binding sites. C-terminal lysine residues of partially degraded fibrin may have a similar stabilizing effect on TAFIa.

The mechanisms by which parathyroid hormone and PTHrP bind to the PTH-1 receptor and induce receptor activation are poorly understood but appear to involve multiple sites of intermolecular interaction. Early studies of PTH fragment analogs assigned the major determinants of receptor-binding affinity and cAMP-stimulating potency to the COOH-terminal and NH2-terminal portions of the fully active PTH(1–34) peptide, respectively (5.Nussbaum S.R.

PTH(1–34)-based analogs with NH2-terminal deletions, such as PTH(3–34) and PTH(7–34), bind efficiently to the receptor and are severely defective in stimulating a cAMP response; such peptides thus function as PTH-1 receptor antagonists (7.Nutt R.F.

The dominant role that the NH2-terminal residues of PTH and PTHrP play in receptor activation is further reflected by their high level of evolutionary conservation. The anabolic effects of PTH on bone density (10.Dempster D.W. Cosman F. Parisien M. Shen V. Lindsay R. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14 (Erratum (1994) Endocr.

Recently PTH(1–28) was shown to be an effective agonist for cAMP production in cell-based assays, although potency was ∼10-fold reduced from that of PTH(1–34) (12.Takasu H. Gardella T. Luck M. Potts Jr., J. Bringhurst F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13453-13460Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 13.Neugebauer W. Barbier J.R. Sung W.L. Whitfield J.F. Willick G.E.

Recently we found that in COS-7 or LLC-PK1 cells transfected with high levels of rat or human PTH-1 receptors, a fragment as short as PTH(1–14) elicited ∼20-fold increases in cAMP formation levels (14.Luck M. Carter P. Gardella T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 670-680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the potency of PTH(1–14) in these transfected cells was weak compared with PTH(1–34) (EC50 = 1 nm and 100 μm, respectively), the response was sufficient for us to perform an initial structure-activity relationship analysis.

Other peptide hormones that bind family B receptors, such as calcitonin, secretin and glucagon, and are comparable in size to PTH(1–34) may utilize a similar topological arrangement in binding to their cognate receptors (20.Bergwitz C.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1050-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); however, small NH2-terminal activating peptides for these other family B receptors have thus far not been reported. In the current study, we use PTH(1–14) as a starting scaffold for investigating whether amino acid modifications can be identified that both enhance the signaling potency of PTH(1–14) and enable further reductions in agonist peptide length. The results show that the NH2-terminal residues of PTH can be optimized, in that greater agonist potency can be achieved in peptides as short as 11 amino acids. Such minimized peptides serve as useful probes of the receptor-interaction mechanism, as we show that the activity-enhancing effects of the ligand modifications are mediated through the portion of the receptor containing the seven transmembrane domains and extracellular loops. The Massachusetts General Hospital Biopolymer Synthesis Facility (Boston, MA) prepared all peptides used in this study. Each peptide contained a carboxyl-terminal amide and a free amino group at the amino terminus, except for the PTH(1–14) analogs desN-G and desN-A, which contained the position 1 modifications of desamino-Ala and desamino-Gly, respectively (Fig. 1). All analogs of rPTH(1–14)NH2 (rPTH(1–14)) and shorter length rPTH peptides were synthesized on a multiple peptide synthesizer (Advanced Chemtech model 396 MBS) using Fmoc protecting group chemistry and trifluoroacetic acid-mediated cleavage/deprotection; and were desalted by adsorption on a C18-containing cartridge. [Nle8,21,Tyr34]rPTH(1–34)NH2(rPTH(1–34)), [Tyr34]hPTH(1–34)NH2((hPTH(1–34)), [Tyr34]hPTH(3–34)NH2((hPTH(3–34)), and [Ala1,3,10,12,Arg11,Tyr34]hPTH(1–34)NH2were prepared on an Applied Biosystems model 431A peptide synthesizer using the same Fmoc chemistry and trifluoroacetic acid-mediated cleavage/deprotection; after C18 desalting, these peptides were purified further by HPLC. All peptides were reconstituted in 10 mm acetic acid and stored at −80 °C. The purity, identity, and stock concentration of each compound were secured by analytical HPLC, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, and amino acid analysis. LLC-PK1-derived and COS-7 cells were cultured at 37 °C in T-75 flasks (75 mm2) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%), penicillin G (20 units/ml), streptomycin sulfate (20 μg/ml), and amphotericin B (0.05 μg/ml) in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. ROS 17/2.8 cells were cultured as above except that Ham's F-12 medium was used instead of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal bovine serum was at 5%. Stock solutions of EGTA/trypsin and antibiotics were from Life Technologies, Inc.; fetal bovine serum was from HyClone Laboratories (Logan, UT). Cells were subcultured in 24-well plates and, when confluent, were treated with fresh media and shifted to 33 °C for 12–24 h prior to assay. This shift to 33 °C was included as a means to potentially maximize cell surface expression of the PTH receptors and thus optimize signal sensitivity, since we found previously that the reduced temperature incubation resulted in small (10–50%) increases in surface expression of wild-type and mutant PTH receptors (15.Bergwitz C.

Cells were rinsed with 0.5 ml of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 5% heat-inactivated horse serum, 0.5% fetal bovine serum, adjusted to pH 7.7 with HCl) and treated with 200 μl of cAMP assay buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 35 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4) and 100 μl of binding buffer containing varying amounts of peptide analog (final volume = 300 μl). The medium was removed after incubation for 1 h at room temperature, and the cells were frozen (−80 °C), lysed with 0.5 ml of 50 mm HCl, and refrozen (−80 °C). The cAMP content of the diluted lysate was determined by radioimmunoassay. Where possible, EC50 and corresponding maximum response values (E max) were calculated using nonlinear regression (see below). For inhibition studies, the hPTH(3–34) antagonist peptide was added to the rinsed cells in 100 μl of binding buffer immediately prior to the addition of 100 μl of cAMP assay buffer and 100 μl of cAMP assay buffer containing varying amounts of agonist peptide (final volume = 300 μl); the cells were then incubated for 60 min at room temperature and processed as described above. COS-7 cells transfected as above with hP1R-WT were treated with serum-free, inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and myo-[3H]inositol (NEN Life Science Products) (2 μCi/ml) for 16 h prior to assay. At the time of the assay, the cells were rinsed with binding buffer containing LiCl (30 mm) and treated with the same buffer with or without a PTH analog. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 40 min, after which the buffer was removed and replaced by 0.5 ml of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid solution. After 3 h on ice, the lysate was collected and extracted twice with ethyl ether. The lysate was then applied to an ion exchange column (0.5-ml resin bed) and the total inositol phosphates were eluted as described previously (30.Berridge M. Dawson R. Downes C. Heslop J. Irvine R. Biochem. J. 1983; 212: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar), and counted in liquid scintillation mixture. Calculations were performed using Microsoft Excel. Nonlinear regression analysis of cAMP stimulation data was performed using four parameters, defined as the minimum (Min), maximum (Max, E max), midpoint (EC50), and slope of the response curve. The predicted response (y p) for a given dose (x) of peptide was calculated using the following equation:y p = Min + [(Max − Min)/(1 + (EC50/x)slope)]. The initial parameter values were estimated from the primary data, and the Excel “solver function” was then used to vary the four parameters in order to minimize the differences between the predicted and actual responses (least-squares method) (31.Bowen W. Jerman J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 413-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). For each experiment, the maximum was constrained to within ±1 standard deviation of the maximum response observed in that experiment for rPTH(1–34) at a dose of 1 × 10−7m. The optimized equations were used to curve-fit the data shown in the graphs and to obtain the EC50 and corresponding maximum (E max(calc)) values reported in the tables. The observed maximum responses (E max(obs)) were those attained by each NH2-terminal fragment analog at a dose of 100 μm and by each PTH(1–34) analog at a dose of 100 nm, except for studies in cells expressing hP1R-delNT where the E max(obs) for rPTH(1–34) and hPTH(1–34) was determined at a dose of 10 μm and for [Ala1,3,10,12,Arg11,Tyr34]hPTH(1–34)NH2at dose of 20 μm. In some cases where the dose-response curves did not attain a true asymptotic maximum, as with native rPTH(1–14), the E max(calc) values are greater than the E max(obs) values. The statistical significance between two data sets was determined using a one-tailed Student's t test assuming unequal variances for the two sets. PTH(1–14) analogs having single substitutions (132 total) were tested for the ability to stimulate cAMP formation in HKRK-B7 cells. The substitutions were chosen such that at least one of each type of the 20 natural amino acids was introduced at each position, thus enabling a comparison of the effects of varied side chain chemistries (e.g. size, polarity, ionic charge, hydrophobicity, aromaticity, and proline) on receptor activation. The analogs and the control peptide (native rPTH(1–14)NH2) were tested at a single dose of 100 μm; rPTH(1–34) was tested at a maximum stimulatory dose (10−7m). In the assays shown in Fig. 1, native rPTH(1–14) and rPTH(1–34) stimulated 28- and 58-fold increases in cAMP formation, respectively, as compared with the cAMP level in unstimulated cells, which was less than 6 pmol/well. This response range ensured that both activity-enhancing and activity-impairing effects could be readily detected in the PTH(1–14) analogs. As shown in Fig. 1, most substitutions in the (1.Kronenberg H. Abou-Samra A Bringhurst F. Gardella T. Jüppner H. Segre G. Thakker R. Genetics of Endocrine and Metabolic disorders.

Raf-1 propagates its signal via activation of the serine/threonine kinase MEK,1which in turn, phosphorylates its substrate MAPK. MAPK then translocates to the nucleus, where it activates a variety of proteins including transcription factors (1.Moodie S.A. Wolfman A.

The amino terminus of Raf-1 contains two conserved regions (CR1 and CR2) that have been postulated to negatively regulate the carboxyl-terminal kinase domain (CR3) (reviewed in Refs. 1.Moodie S.A.

While CR2 (residues 255–268) is rich in serine and threonine residues that become phosphorylated during Raf-1 activation (4.Morrison D.K. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Copeland T.R. J. Biol.

Ras was initially believed to function by translocating Raf to the plasma membrane via interactions with RBS1 where other Ras-independent events, then led to Raf kinase activation. These Ras-independent activation events are thought to require modulation of both intra- and intermolecular interactions as well as Raf-1 phosphorylation (2.Morrison D.K. Cutler Jr., R.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 12.Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F.

Although details regarding Raf activation upon Ras-mediated membrane recruitment of Raf still remain elusive, it has become apparent that even the role of Ras in mediating Raf-1 activation is more complex than originally envisioned. In fact, recent evidence supports a dual role for Ras in both membrane localization and allosteric activation of Raf-1. While Ras interaction with the RBS1 has been shown to facilitate membrane recruitment, we and others have found that interactions between Ras and the Raf-CRD play an important role in allosteric activation of Raf-1 by Ras (9.Brtva T.R.

However, the recognition elements involved in binding of Ras to the Raf-CRD, and how this binding event is coupled to Raf kinase regulation is not clear. In this study, we have employed site-directed mutagenesis, binding analyses, in vivo Raf kinase assays, and NMR structural analyses to elucidate interactions important for Ras·Raf-CRD complex formation and the functional role these binding interactions play in regulation of Raf kinase activity. Multiple regions of Ras appear to be involved in promoting binding interactions with the Raf-1 amino terminus. The binding of GTP to Ras causes a conformational change in two regions, commonly referred to as switch I and switch II (16.Milburn M.V. Tong L. DeVos A.M. Brunger A. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. Kim S.-H. Science. 1990; 247: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 17.Pai E.F. Kabsch W. Krengel U. Holmes K.C. John J. Wittinghofer A.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2351-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). The GTP-dependent conformation of switch I is critical for high affinity interaction between Ras and RBS1 (19.Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). However, conflicting findings exist on whether the CRD can bind Ras in the absence of post-translational modification, and whether the interaction displays guanine nucleotide dependence (9.Brtva T.R.

Regions flanking switch I appear important for mediating, at least in part, Ras/Raf-CRD interactions (10.Hu C. Kariya K. Tamada M. Akasaka K. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30274-30277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 11.Drugan J.K. Khosravi-Far R. White M.A. Der C.J. Sung Y.-J. Huang Y.-W. Campbell S.L. J. Biol.

Other groups reported that post-translational modification of Ras was essential for stable association with the Raf-CRD as well as Ras-mediated activation of Raf-1, and that this interaction was independent of the nucleotide bound state of Ras (10.Hu C.

However, these conflicting reports were based on results obtained from distinct and non-quantitative binding assays, where the ability to detect an interaction depends on the binding kinetics and assays employed. To resolve this apparent discrepancy, we have employed a fluorescence-based quantitative assay to determine the apparent dissociation constant between lipid modified and non-modified GTP- and GDP-bound Ras with the Raf-CRD. Processed forms of both Ha-Ras and K-Ras appear necessary for in vitro and in vivo Ras-mediated activation of Raf-1 (14.Luo Z. Diaz B. Marshall M.S. Avruch J. Mol. Cell.

Carboxyl-terminal processing differs in Ha-, K-, and N-Ras, and involves multiple modifications, including farnesylation, palmitoylation, carboxyl-terminal cleavage, and carboxyl-methylation (24.Gelb M.H. Scholten J.D. Seblt-Leopold J.S. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). One common lipid modification, however, is farnesylation of the CAAX cysteine (20.Stokoe D. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2384-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 21.Kuroda S.

To assess whether farnesylation of Ras alone is required for stable association with the Raf-CRD, we prepared farnesylated Ha-Ras in vitro using purified bacterially expressed Ha-Ras-(1–189) and recombinant farnesyl transferase. We then compared the binding of farnesylated to non-farnesylated bacterial expressed full-length Ha-Ras. While unmodified Ras showed a weak but detectable binding interaction with the Raf-CRD, higher affinity association was observed with farnesylated Ras. We had previously observed a weak, preferential binding of GTP-bound Ras relative to GDP-bound Ras to the Raf-CRD, when Ras is not processed by ELISA (11.Drugan J.K. Khosravi-Far R.

Consistent with our previous observations, binding interactions between unprocessed Ras and the Raf-CRD do show a GTP dependence in our fluorescence-based assay. However, we observe little, if any, preference for GTP-bound Ras when Ras is farnesylated. This is in contrast to the strong GTP dependence observed for the Ras/Raf-RBS1 interaction (25.Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). While regions of Ras involved in Ras/RBS1 interactions have been characterized, relatively little is known about Raf-CRD residues important for associating with Ras. To elucidate residues of the Raf-CRD important for Ras binding, we made Raf-CRD mutations at conserved surface-exposed residues, based on our previously determined NMR solution structure of the Raf-CRD (26.Mott H.R.

Here we characterize a Raf-CRD variant, disrupted at a hydrophobic patch on the surface of the Raf-CRD that is selectively impaired in binding both farnesylated and non-farnesylated Ras. This mutant, in the context of full-length Raf-1, is defective in Ras-mediated Raf kinase activity in vivo, supporting earlier findings that Ras interactions with the Raf-CRD are essential for Ras mediated Raf-1 activation (11.Drugan J.K.

To characterize the regions of the Raf-CRD that interact with the unprocessed form of Ras, we employed NMR spectroscopy to identify residues perturbed upon binding to unprocessed Ras. Results from these structural studies are consistent with our mutagenesis results and indicate that residues within the hydrophobic patch, are important for Ras/Raf-CRD interactions. Full-length Ha-Ras-(C118S/C181S/C184S) and Ha-Ras-(1–166) were expressed and purified as described (29.Campbell-Burk S.L. Carpenter J.W.

Purified Ha-Ras-(C118S/C181S/C184S) (0.4 mg/ml) was incubated in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ZnSO4, 1 mm DTT, 30 μm nucleotide, 0.2% N-octyl glucopyranoside, 30 μm farnesylpyrophosphate (Biomol), 1 μmfarnesyl transferase (DNA construct was a gift from Dr. Pat Casey, Duke; protein purified as described previously (31.Chen W.-J. Moomaw J.F. Overton L. Kost T.A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9675-9680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) for 2 h at 37 °C. After incubation, FTase was removed by the addition of nickel-agarose and the extent of Ha-Ras farnesylation was assayed by SDS-PAGE. Farnesylated Ha-Ras was separated from non-farnesylated Ha-Ras based on differential binding to bind to a phenyl-Sepharose matrix. FTase-treated Ras was added to a 5-ml phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma) column that was previously equilibrated in 50 mmHEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 μmnucleotide, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1% N-octyl glucopyranoside. The column was then washed with 2 column volumes of the same buffer and farnesylated protein eluted with 50 mmHEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 μmnucleotide, 1 mm DTT, and 2.0% N-octyl glucopyranoside (Sigma). Mant-dGDP and mant-GMP-P(NH)P were synthesized as described previously (mant from Molecular Probes; dGDP and GMP-P(NH)P from Sigma) (32.Hiratsuka T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 496-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The reaction was usually >80% complete and mant-nucleotide was employed without further purification for incorporation into Ras. 250 μmHa-Ras (farnesylated or non-farnesylated) was incubated for 2 h with gentle shaking in 32 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 0.1% N-octyl glucopyranoside, and 2.5 mm nucleotide at 25 °C. When mant-GMP-P(NH)P labeling, 25 units of alkaline phosphatase linked to agarose (Sigma) were added per milligram of Ha-Ras. The labeling reaction was quenched by the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 20 mm. Ha-Ras was then exchanged into 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% N-octyl glucopyranoside. Fluorescence measurements were made using an SLM-Aminco 8100 fluorescence spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 365 nm and an emission wavelength of 440 nm. Samples were under continuous stirring and thermostatted at 20 °C. Titrations were performed by adding known amounts of purified Raf-CRD to 1 μm mant-dGDP or mant-GMP-P(NH)P-labeled Ha-Ras (farnesylated or non-farnesylated) in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 μmZnSO4, 1 mm DTT and monitoring the subsequent increase in mant fluorescence intensity at 440 nm. 200 pmol of the Raf-CRD fragment (Raf-1 residues 136–187) fused to GST was immobilized on GSH-agarose beads. The beads were then incubated with either 400 pmol of full-length farnesylated Ha-Ras-GDP or 400 pmol of processed K-Ras4B-GDP that had been purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells (a gift from Gideon Bollag and David Stokoe, Onyx, Richmond, CA). After gentle shaking to keep the beads suspended for 30 min in 100 μl of buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, 20 μm ZnSO4, 30 μm GDP, 1 mm DTT, and 0.2%n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside), the beads were washed once in 1 ml of the same buffer. The protein was quantitated by laser densitometry scanning of a Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE, and the ratios of Ras:GST-Raf were compared with the ratio of Ras:GST alone. Assays were performed at least twice in duplicate. Binding interactions between bacterially expressed Ha-Ras or 14-3-3 and the Raf-CRD were assessed by ELISA as described (9.Brtva T.R. Drugan J.K.

For 14-3-3/phosphatidylserine competition studies, 200 pmol of GST-Raf-CRD and corresponding amounts of GST were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 400 pmol of 14-3-3ζ in the presence and absence of 3 μg of dioleoyl phosphatidylserine (Avanti Polar-Lipids, Inc.) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.) in 100 μl of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 20 μm ZnSO4, 1 mm DTT, and 10 μl of GSH-coated agarose beads. The presence of 14-3-3ζ was detected by Western blotting using a 1:2500 dilution of a polyclonal 14-3-3ζ antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The amount of 14-3-3 bound was quantitated by laser densitometry. Assays were performed at least twice in duplicate. COS cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of mutant Raf and 1 μg of activated Ha-Ras, both in the vector pCGN using LipofectAMINE (33.Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). After 48 h, the cells were shifted to 1% serum and incubated overnight. The cells were then lysed (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors) and the Raf immunoprecipitated with C-12 polyclonal antisera (Santa Cruz). The isolated kinase mutants were then incubated with recombinant MEK (0.5 μg), MAP kinase (0.5 μg), and myelin basic protein (MBP) (1 mg) in kinase buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT) with [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS loading buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Incorporation of 32P into the MBP substrate was quantitated on a PhosphorImager. Expression of Ras and Raf mutants was examined by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody (BabCo). Uniformly 15N-enriched wild type Raf-CRD or Raf-CRD-(149/151) protein was obtained by growingEscherichia coli with 99.8% 15NH4Cl (Isotec) as the sole nitrogen source (26.Mott H.R. Carpenter J.W. Zhong S. Ghosh S. Bell R.M. Campbell S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8312-8317Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The purified protein was concentrated to 2 ml in 30 mm Tris acetate at pH 6.5, 75 mm Na2SO4, 10 μmZnCl2, 1 mm DTT and exchanged into NMR buffer (30 mm d 11-Tris-d 3-acetate (Isotec) at pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 μmZnCl2, 1 mm d 10-DTT, 10% D2O, 0.01% NaN3) using a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech PD-10 gel filtration column. The final Raf-CRD-(149/151) NMR sample contained 0.20 mm of uniformly15N-enriched Raf-CRD. The wild type Raf-CRD NMR sample contained 0.28 mm uniformly 15N-enriched Raf-CRD alone or mixed with wild-type unlabeled Ras at concentrations ranging from 0.30 to 0.77 mm. NMR experiments were recorded on a Bruker AMX 500 (500 MHz) spectrometer at 12 °C or a Varian Inova 600 (600 MHz) spectrometer at 25 °C. Two-dimensional1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy (HSQC) experiments were performed with pulsed field gradient and water flip-back methods described previously (34.Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). Data were acquired with 1024 × 256 complex data points and a spectral width of 7042.25 Hz for the 1H dimension and 1000 Hz for the 15N dimension on the Bruker AMX 500. HSQC experiments conducted on the Varian Inova 600 spectrometer were acquired with 1024 × 128 complex data points and a spectral width of 8000 Hz for the 1H dimension and 1700 Hz for the 15N dimension. NMR data were processed and analyzed using the program FELIX, version 97.2 (Biosym Technology, San Diego). Two-dimensional1H-15N HSQC data were acquired on the Raf-CRD-Ras complexes at 4 different molar ratios: 1:2.75, 1:1.65, 1:1.1, and 1:0. The final concentration of 15N-Raf-CRD was 0.28 mm and unlabeled Ras ranged from 0.77 to 0.30 mm. Samples containing the highest molar ratio (1:2.75) of the Raf-CRD-Ras complex (0.28:0.77 mm) and Raf-CRD alone (0.28 mm) were prepared first. To prevent changes in sample volume and buffer composition, the other two complexes were made by exchanging equal volumes (200 μl) of these two samples. Proton and15N resonance assignments of the Raf-CRD have been obtained previously in this laboratory (26.Mott H.R. Carpenter J.W. Zhong S. Ghosh S. Bell R.M. Campbell S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8312-8317Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Processed forms of either Ha-Ras or K-Ras have been reported to be important for stable binding interactions with the Raf-CRD and for Ras-mediated activation of Raf-1. Although Ha-Ras and K-Ras possess distinct carboxyl-terminal lipid modifications, they are both farnesylated at the CAAX cysteine (20.Stokoe D. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2384-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 21.Kuroda S. Shimizu K. Yamamori B. Matsuda S. Imazumi K. Kaibuchi K. Takai Y. J. Biol.

Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 975-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To assess whether farnesylation of Ras alone is required for stabilization of the Ras/Raf-CRD interaction, we prepared farnesylated Ha-Ras in vitro using purified bacterially expressed Ha-Ras-(1–189) and recombinant farnesyl transferase. Complex formation with the Raf-CRD can be detected with both farnesylated Ha-Ras and non-farnesylated Ras by ELISA (Fig. 1 A), while only interactions with farnesylated Ras are observed by a direct binding assay (Fig. 1 B). A likely explanation for the inability to detect non-farnesylated Ras association to the Raf-CRD in a direct binding assay is the assays relative insensitivity to weak binding interactions, particularly those with rapid rates of complex dissociation. Quantitation of the Ras/Raf-CRD interaction should aid in reconciling the apparent differences observed between the ELISA and direct binding assay. Hence, we have employed a binding assay based upon the fluorescence technique originally described by Wittinghofer and co-workers (25.Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Our method relies on an increase in apparent fluorescence intensity of mant-dGDP or mant-GMP-P(NH)P-labeled Ha-Ras upon Raf-CRD binding. Assuming a simple one-site binding model, we have calculated an apparent K d for the farnesylated Ha-Ras-GDP/Raf-CRD interaction of 33 ± 8.4 μm (Fig.2). In addition, we have observed an apparent K d for the farnesylated Ha-Ras-GMP-P(NH)P·Raf-CRD complex of 22 ± 6.2 μm(Fig. 2), but we cannot assert that these modest differences in binding affinity are statistically significant. This finding is consistent with previous reports from Hu et al. (10.Hu C. Kariya K. Tamada M. Akasaka K. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30274-30277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) that the Raf-CRD binds processed Ha-Ras in a nucleotide independent fashion (23.Rosales C. Juliano R. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2302-2305PubMed Google Scholar). More importantly, however, we have determined that fully processed K-Ras4B binds the Raf-CRD with similar affinity to that of Ha-Ras that has farnesylation as its only post-translational modification (data not shown). Due to technical difficulties stemming from solubility limitations of the Raf-CRD, we were unable to reach binding saturation and therefore not able to calculate reliable K dvalues for unprocessed Ras/Raf-CRD interactions.Figure 2Fluorescence-based quantitation of binding interactions between farnesylated and non-farnesylated Ha-Ras with the Raf-CRD.

BiP and other Hsp70 proteins consist of two domains: the 44-kDa N-terminal domain, which carries a weak ATPase activity (8.Chappell T.G. Konforti B.B. Schmid S.L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol.

Although a C-terminal regulatory motif has been identified as important for the activity of the cytosolic Hsp70 (12.Freeman B.C. Myers M.P. Schumacher R. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2281-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), the function of the C-terminal tail of other Hsp70 proteins is still unknown. Hsp70 proteins are regulated through the coupling of the ATPase activity of the N-terminal domain with the binding and release of unfolded polypeptides by the C-terminal domain (13.Bukau B.

The interaction between Sec63p and BiP/Kar2p is mediated by the conserved J domain, located near the N terminus of Sec63p (32.Corsi A.K. Schekman R. J.

Similarly, the mammalian cytosolic DnaJ-like protein auxilin, which plays an important role in the dissociation of clathrin vesicles (36.Ungewickell E. Ungewickell H. Holstein S.E.H. Lindner R. Prasad K. Barouch W. Martin B. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Nature. 1995; 378: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), stably interacts with the uncoating ATPase Hsc70 through its C-terminal J domain (37.Holstein S.E. Ungewickell H.

An interaction of mammalian BiP with an endoplasmic reticulum-resident DnaJ homologue has not been characterized yet. The murine protein MTJ1 has been identified as a putative membrane DnaJ-like protein enriched in the microsomal and nuclear fractions of murine cells (39.Brightman S.E. Blatch G.L. Zetter B.R. Gene. 1995; 153: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We investigated whether MTJ1 constitutes an accessory protein able to regulate murine BiP/GRP78 catalytic activity. We present here biochemical evidence that the J domain of MTJ1 (J-MTJ1)1 interacts with murine BiP/GRP78 and stimulates its ATPase activity, and that the interaction between BiP/GRP78 and MTJ1 is mediated by an invariant motif found in all DnaJ-like proteins. J-MTJ1 can also activate the activity of the E. coli DnaK, although at higher concentrations. However, the E. coli DnaJ does not interact with murine BiP/GRP78. pHis6-BiP was engineered from pT7B115 (21.Blond-Elguindi S. Fourie A.M. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12730-12735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence coding for mature mouse BiP was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the forward primer 5′-CCGCTCGAGGAGGAGGACAAGAAGGAG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′CCCAAGCTTTAATGCGGTAGTTTATC-3′. The PCR product was then digested with XhoI and HindIII enzymes (sites are underlined in the primers) and ligated into the pET15b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) with T4 DNA ligase (MBI Fermentas, Amherst, NY). This vector allows expression of a six-histidine tag followed by a thrombin cleavage site (LVP(R/G)S) at the N-terminal extremity of the protein. The plasmid pHis6-BiP.ent was obtained from pFLAG-BiP.ent (22.Chevalier M. King L. Wang C. Gething M.J. Elguindi E. Blond S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26827-26835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), by following the same strategy. The plasmid His10-BiP-ent-C19 encodes for a truncated form of BiP (residues 1–550) and will be described elsewhere. 2L. King, M-G. Berg, C. Wang, A. Carey, M. Chevalier, E. C. Elguindi, and S. Y. Blond, manuscript in preparation. The plasmid pHis6-J-MTJ1 encodes the lumenal domain of MTJ1, from the start of the J domain following the first transmembrane segment, to the beginning of the second potential transmembrane segment (residues 46–148). The sequence coding for MTJ1 was amplified from a cDNA clone kindly provided by Dr. B. Zetter (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). After PCR amplification with Pfu polymerase using the forward primer Nde-MTJ1, 5′-GGGAATTCCATATGAGCGGAGACCTGGAGTTGTTC-3′, and the reverse primer Bam-MTJ1, 5′-GCGGATCCCTAAGCATTGCTCATTTTTCTCACTC-3′, the PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI enzymes (sites are underlined in the primers) and subcloned into pET15b. The plasmid pHis6-Jo-MTJ1 codes for the J domain only of MTJ1 (residues 46–129). The coding sequence of the J domain was amplified using the forward primer Nde-MTJ1 described above and the reverse primer, 5′-CGGGATCCCTAAAGTCCATTGATCAGAAC-3′. The PCR product was then digested with NdeI and BamHI enzymes and ligated into pET15b. The coding sequence of DnaJ was amplified from the plasmid pRLM232 (40.Karzai A.W. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11236-11246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), a kind gift of Dr. R. McMacken (Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD), and subcloned into pET15b, in-frame with the hexahistidine N-terminal tag and the thrombin site. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using two rounds of PCR in a procedure adapted from Morrison and Desrosiers (41.Morrison H.G. Desrosiers R.C. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar). In the first set of reactions, the partial 5′ and 3′ fragments of J-MTJ1:H89Q were amplified from the pJ-MTJ1 plasmid with the Nde-MTJ1 and the Bam-MTJ1 outside primers, and the 5′-GCTTTCACTAACCTTACAACCAGACAAGAATAAAG-3′ and 5′-CTTTATTCTTGTCTGG T TGTAAGGTTAGTGAAAGC-3′ overlapping inside primers, which encode the H89Q mutation (underlined in the primers). The PCR products were gel-purified using low melting point agarose as described previously (42.Sambrook J.F. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), mixed in equimolar concentrations, and used as templates for the second round of PCR amplification, together with the Nde-MTJ1 and the Bam-MTJ1 outside primers described above. The final product was digested withNdeI and BamHI enzymes and ligated into pET15b. The presence of the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing by using the Fentomol kit (Promega, Madison, WI) or the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH). The recombinant proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. The cells were grown at 37 °C until A 600 ∼ 0.6, and synthesis of recombinant proteins was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Fischer Scientific, Hanover Park, IL) at 0.4 mm final concentration. Cells were harvested after 1-h induction for the different BiP proteins and after 2-h induction for J-MTJ1 or Jo-MTJ1 expressing cultures. Histidine-tagged proteins were purified on cobalt-chelating resin (Talon resin,CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). After binding to the resin in 20 mm Tris base, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl (buffer A), and a wash of nonspecific protein with 5 mmimidazole in buffer A, the bound proteins were eluted with 50 and 100 mm imidazole in buffer A. Eluted fractions were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in 20 mm Tris base, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2 and loaded onto a MonoQ 5/5 HR anion exchange column connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bound proteins were then eluted with a linear gradient of KCl (50–200 mm). Fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) as described (43.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206615) Google Scholar). Nucleotide-free BiP proteins were prepared as described (44.Ha J. McKay D.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14625-14635Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified BiP was mixed with activated charcoal (1 mg/ml) in 10 mm Na2EDTA, pH 8.0. After incubation for 4 h at 4 °C, the sample was centrifuged and the supernatant dialyzed exhaustively against 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 75 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2 (assay buffer). Contamination by nucleotides was evaluated spectrophotometrically. AnA 280/A 260 ratio of >1.5 indicated that the sample were free of nucleotides (45.Farr C.D. Slepenkov S.V. Witt S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9744-9748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For removal of the hexahistidine N-terminal tag, His6-J-MTJ1 or His6-DnaJ (30 μg) was incubated with 0.1 unit of thrombin (Sigma) at room temperature for 4 h. The cleaved proteins were then collected in the flow-through fraction of a Talon column. When necessary, the MTJ1-derived proteins were further purified by gel filtration on Superdex 75 (Pharmacia Amersham Biotech), equilibrated in assay buffer. All proteins were transferred into the assay buffer prior to analysis. Protein concentrations were estimated by the method of Bradford (46.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214409) Google Scholar) or spectrophotometrically measured by using the extinction coefficients at 280 nm calculated by the method of Gill and von Hippel (47.Gill S.C. Hippel P.H.v. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar), i.e. 26,860 m−1cm−1 and 13,730 m−1cm−1 for BiP and J-MTJ1, respectively. E. coliDnaK was expressed from the plasmid pRLM163, a kind gift of Dr. R. McMacken and purified as described (48.Russell R. Jordan R. McMacken R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 596-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were obtained on a spectrometer (model 710, Jasco, Easton, MD). Spectra of native BiP (10 μm) were obtained in assay buffer. Spectra of native J-MTJ1 (11 μm) and mutant J-MTJ1:H89Q (8 μm) were obtained in 10 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.0. Far-UV CD experiments were carried out at room temperature in the wavelength region of 250–190 nm with a 0.1-cm path length cell. Data were recorded at 0.5-nm intervals with a time constant of 1.0 s and a 1.0-nm constant spectral bandwidth. Data were averaged over five repetitive scans and fitted for protein concentration and optical path length. The mean residue ellipticity (θ) was calculated by using a mean residue weight of 110.9 and expressed in deg.cm2/dmol per residue. Data were analyzed by the spectral deconvolution method JFIT provided by Dr. B. Rupp (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Livermore, CA). Concentration-dependent assays were carried out as described (49.Chevalier M. King L. Blond S. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 384-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Time-dependent assays were done as follows: 70 μl of total assay buffer supplemented with 100 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 3000 mmol/Ci), and 0.2–0.3 μm BiP or DnaK was incubated at 37 °C with 0.4–0.6 μm J-MTJ1 protein. At various time points, 10 μl of the reaction mixtures was retrieved and quenched in SDS at 1% final concentration. The samples were then processed by thin layer chromatography or direct quantification of a phosphomolybdate complex as described (49.Chevalier M. King L. Blond S. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 384-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For assays in single turnover conditions, BiP (1 to 2 μm) was incubated with 10–30 nm ATP and 0.05 μCi of [α32P]ATP, in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, and 75 mm KCl or 50 mm NaCl. After incubation at 37 °C, 10-μl aliquots were quenched with 2 μl of 1 N HCl and put on ice. Conversion of ATP into ADP was determined by thin layer chromatography as described (49.Chevalier M. King L. Blond S. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 384-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). His6-BiP (10 μg) in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 75 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Tween 20, 2% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer B) was mixed with 20 μg of cleaved wild-type or mutant form of J-MTJ1, in the absence or presence of 1 mm ATP or ADP. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, 50 μl of the metal-chelating resin (50% suspension) was added and the samples were further incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, with gentle shaking. The resin was then washed five times with ice-cold buffer B, and the bound complexes were eluted by boiling after addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Following denaturation, the samples were loaded onto a 15% SDS gel. After electrophoretic migration, the gels were stained with Coomassie blue and the quantity of proteins was estimated by densitometry scanning of the gel (1D analysis, Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY). The data were then normalized to an equivalent background value. The in situ topology and cellular localization of MTJ1 has not been investigated yet. Using the most recent software available, we re-analyzed the primary sequence of MTJ1 and re-examined its putative topology (Figs.1 and 2). An N-terminal signal sequence containing a putative cleavage site between amino acids 43 and 44, and a KKXX-like retrieval signal present near the C terminus, could account for MTJ1 retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (50.Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 27-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The N-terminal portion of MTJ1 carries a conserved J domain of about 70 amino acids (residues 60–117) that displays 42% identity with the J domain of yeast Sec63p. The J domain would be followed by one (model one, preferred model) or two (model two) putative transmembrane domains, exposing the C-terminal domain to the cytosolic or the luminal side, respectively (Fig. 2). In both models, the J domain of MTJ1 would be exposed in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, similar to that of Sec63p (51.Feldheim D. Yoshimura K. Admon A. Schekman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), as proposed originally by Zetter and coworkers (39.Brightman S.E. Blatch G.L. Zetter B.R. Gene. 1995; 153: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Interestingly, another stretch of amino acids (residues 408–463) exhibits homology with Sec63p with 28% identity throughout this small region. This Sec63-homologous region is surrounded by two stretches of amino acids (residues 324–375 and residues 491–543) reminiscent of tryptophan-mediated repeats, also called the SANT domains, found in other DnaJ-like proteins such as MIDA-1, a murine protein involved in cell growth (52.Shoji W.

After purification on a metal-chelating affinity column, the N-terminal histidine tag was removed by digestion with thrombin. The cleavage was fast and efficient, with a yield superior to 95% after 4 h of proteolytic digestion (Fig.3, top panel). Cleaved J-MTJ1 was then submitted to far-UV CD spectroscopy (Fig. 3, bottom left panel). The spectra of wild-type J-MTJ1 presents the characteristic features of helical proteins: a high maximum at 195 nm followed by two minima at 208 and 222 nm. Deconvolution of the spectrum indicates that J-MTJ1 contains about 75% helical structures. These results demonstrate that wild-type MTJ1 is folded into a mostly helical domain, in agreement with the solution structure of the J domains of the E. coli DnaJ (61.Hill R.B. Flanagan J.M.

His6-BiP was purified by affinity chromatography followed by ion exchange chromatography on MonoQ HR 5/5 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). His6-BiP is fully active in ATPase assays, and the kinetic parameters obtained in steady-state conditions are of the same order of magnitude as values determined for BiP purified from other constructs (TableI). His6-BiP purified in these conditions was found to be mostly monomeric (data not shown), contrary to our previously described His10-BiP that has a high tendency to oligomerize (22.Chevalier M.

https://openalex.org/W2006143986,"Kalirin is a neuron-specific GDP/GTP exchange factor for Rho subfamily GTP-binding proteins. The major Kalirin transcripts in adult rat brain were identified. Most include a Sec14p-like putative lipid-binding motif followed by nine spectrin-like repeats and a Dbl homology/pleckstrin homology (DH-PH) domain. Kalirin proteins with four different NH2 termini are generated through the use of five different 5′-ends; three of the proteins differ only at the extreme NH2 terminus, and one is truncated because translation is initiated at a methionine in the 5th spectrin repeat. Four different 3′-ends yield Kalirin proteins with additional functional domains. Kalirin-7 (7-kilobase pair mRNA) terminates with a PDZ-binding motif, which in Kalirin-8 is replaced by an SH3 domain. Kalirin-9 contains another pair of DH-PH and SH3 domains. Kalirin-12 additionally encodes a putative Ser/Thr protein kinase. Antisera specific for different COOH termini established Kalirin-7 as the most abundant in cortex, with significant amounts of Kalirin-9 and Kalirin-12; Kalirin-7 was less prevalent in cerebellum and olfactory bulb. Kalirin proteins lacking the Sec14p-like domain and first four spectrin-like repeats were much less prevalent. Form-specific antisera demonstrated that different forms of Kalirin were localized to distinct subcellular regions of cultured neurons. Members of the family of Kalirin proteins may subserve different functions at these different locations."

We demonstrate that although ry+LAT1-mediated transport of [14C]l-leucine was accompanied by the cotransport of 22Na+, that of [14C]l-lysine was not.

Therefore, for the substrate recognition by ry+LAT1, the positive charge on basic amino acid side chains or that conferred by inorganic monovalent cations such as Na+ and H+, which are cotransported with neutral amino acids, is presumed to be required.

The amino acid permease family SLC7 consists of Na+-independent amino acid transporters composed of two subfamilies: the cationic amino acid transporter (CAT)1 family, which consists of classical system y+ basic amino acid transporters, and the recently identified l-type amino acid transporter (LAT) family, which includes transporters associated with type II membrane glycoproteins, such as 4F2 heavy chain (4F2hc) and rBAT (related to b0,+ amino acid transporter) (6.MacLeod C.L.

Among the members of the LAT family, the system y+L transporters, y+LAT1 and y+LAT2, are unique because of their peculiar Na+ dependence (13.Torrents D. Estevez R. Pineda M. Fernandez E. Lloberas J.

System y+L was originally identified as a transport system that transports both neutral and basic amino acids in the erythrocyte plasma membrane (18.Deves R. Chavez P. Boyd C.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 454: 491-501Crossref Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The transport of basic amino acids by this system was shown to be Na+-independent, whereas that of neutral amino acids, although not completely, was dependent on Na+(18.Deves R. Chavez P. Boyd C.A.

This characteristic Na+ dependence was confirmed for mouse and human y+LAT1 coexpressed with 4F2hc inXenopus oocytes (13.Torrents D. Estevez R. Pineda M. Fernandez E. Lloberas J. Shi Y.-B. Zorzano A. Palacin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32437-32445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 14.Pfeiffer R. Rossier G. Spindler B. Meier C. Kuhn L. Verrey F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In the case of erythrocyte system y+L-mediated transport, it was proposed that Na+ (and Li+) increases the affinity of neutral but not basic amino acids for the binding sites (19.Angelo S. Deves R. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 141: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanisms of substrate recognition and transport by system y+L transporters, we isolated a y+LAT1 cDNA from the rat kidney and expressed it in Xenopusoocytes. We report here that not only Na+ and Li+, but also H+, are capable of supporting the neutral amino acid transport and that these monovalent cations are, in fact, cotransported with the neutral amino acids. Because of the peculiar cation dependence, y+LAT1 mediates the exodus of basic amino acids through an obligatory exchange mechanism. The cDNA for an expressed sequence tag (GenBank™ EBI/DDBJ accession number R82979) corresponding to the human y+LAT1 was obtained from the Integrated and Molecular Analysis of Genomes and their Expression (IMAGE). A 0.3-kilobase EcoRI fragment was excised from the cDNA (IMAGE clone number 187050) and used as the probe for screening a rat kidney cDNA library (11.Segawa H. Fukasawa Y. Miyamoto K. Takeda E.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). cDNAs in positive λZipLox phages were rescued into plasmid pZL1 and sequenced as described previously. A cDNA clone was isolated, which contained an open reading frame encoding a 512-amino acid protein, designated as ry+LAT1 (rat y+LAT1: GenBank™ EBI/DDBJ accession number AB020520) with the amino acid sequence identity to y+LAT1 from humans (90%) and mice (94%) (13.Torrents D.

Rossier G. Spindler B. Meier C. Kuhn L. Verrey F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). cRNAs were obtained by in vitro transcription using SP6 RNA polymerase for ry+LAT1 (rat y+LAT1) in pZL1 linearized withRsrII and T7 RNA polymerase for rat 4F2hc in pBluescript II SK linearized with XbaI as described elsewhere (24.Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1992; 360: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). TheXenopus oocyte expression studies and uptake measurements were performed as described previously (22.Utsunomiya-Tate N. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14883-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 25.Kanai Y. Nussberger S. Romero M.F. Boron W.F. Hebert S.C. Hediger M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16561-16568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The uptake of14C-labeled amino acids was measured 3 days after injection of the cRNA. For the coexpression experiments, 12.9 ng of ry+LAT1 cRNA and 12.1 ng of 4F2hc cRNA at the molar ratio of 1:1 were mixed and injected into each oocyte. To express ry+LAT1 or 4F2hc singly in Xenopus oocytes, 12.9 and 12.1 ng of ry+LAT1 or 4F2hc cRNA was injected, respectively. Groups of six to eight oocytes were incubated in 500 μl of standard uptake solution (containing 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm Tris; pH 7.4) or Na+-free uptake solution, which was similar in composition to the standard uptake solution except that NaCl was replaced by choline chloride, containing 0.5–3.0 μCi of radiolabeled compounds (22.Utsunomiya-Tate N. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14883-14890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). For the high K+ uptake solution, NaCl in the standard uptake solution was replaced by KCl. For the Li+ uptake solution, NaCl in the standard uptake solution was replaced by LiCl. To prepare uptake solutions at pH 5.5, MES was used instead of HEPES for the buffer system (11.Segawa H. Fukasawa Y. Miyamoto K. Takeda E. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19745-19751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments to determine the time course of [14C]l-leucine (50 μm) uptake by oocytes expressing ry+LAT1 and 4F2hc indicated that the uptake was linearly dependent on the incubation time up to 60 min (data not shown); hence, in all the following experiments, the uptakes were measured for 30 min and the values were expressed as picomoles/oocyte/min. The K m and V max values for amino acid substrates were determined using the Eadie-Hofstee equation based on the ry+LAT1-mediated amino acid uptakes (11.Segawa H. Fukasawa Y. Miyamoto K. Takeda E. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19745-19751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The ry+LAT1-mediated amino acid uptakes were calculated as differences between the mean uptakes by oocytes injected with ry+LAT1 and 4F2hc cRNAs and those by water-injected control oocytes. In the experiments to investigate whether the amino acid transports were trans-stimulated by the intracellular amino acids, the oocytes were loaded with amino acids by microinjecting them with 100 nl of 100 mm nonradiolabeled amino acids. The individual oocytes were incubated in the standard uptake solution for 30 min after the injection of the amino acids, to allow recovery from the injury caused by the microinjection, and then transferred to a standard uptake solution containing 100 μm[14C]l-leucine; the uptake was measured for 30 min. Groups of six to eight oocytes were preincubated for 30 min in the 22Na+ uptake solution (containing 40 mm NaCl, 60 mm choline chloride, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ouabain, 0.1 mm amiloride, 0.1 mm bumetanide, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm Tris; pH 7.4) (25.Kanai Y.

Chem. 1995; 270: 16561-16568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).22Na+ uptake was measured for 30 min in a22Na+ uptake solution containing 20 μCi of22Na+ with or without 200 μml-leucine or l-lysine. Concurrently, the uptakes of 200 μm[14C]l-leucine and [14C]l-lysine by the same batch of oocytes coexpressing ry+LAT1 and 4F2hc were measured under the same conditions. In separate experiments, to determine the Na+:amino acid stoichiometry, the dependence of22Na+ uptake and [14C]l-leucine uptake by the same batch of oocytes on the concentration of leucine in the22Na+ uptake solution was compared. 100 nl (∼3 nCi) of [14C]amino acids (100 μm) were injected into the oocytes (12.Fukasawa Y. Segawa H. Kim J.Y. Chairoungdua A. Kim D.K. Matsuo H. Cha S.H. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9690-9698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). After the injection, the individual oocytes were incubated for 30 min in the standard uptake solution and then transferred to a standard uptake solution with or without 100 μm nonradiolabeled amino acids. The radioactivity in the medium and the remaining radioactivity in the oocytes were measured. The efflux of preloaded [14C]l-lysine was linearly dependent on the incubation time up to 45 min, when 100 μml-leucine was applied extracellularly to the oocytes expressing ry+LAT1 and 4F2hc; hence, in all the following experiments, the efflux was measured for 30 min. The values were expressed as percentage of radioactivity (radioactivity in the medium or oocytes/(radioactivity in the medium + radioactivity in the oocytes) × 100%). For the measurements of the uptake and the efflux of the radiolabeled amino acids or 22Na+ in the present study, six to eight oocytes were used for each data point. Each data point in the figures represents the mean ± S.E. of the uptake by six to eight oocytes. To confirm the reproducibility of the results, experiments were performed in triplicate for each measurement using different batches of oocytes and cRNA transcribed in vitro. Representative results from the experiments are shown in the figures. ry+LAT1 and rat 4F2hc cDNAs were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) and cotransfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by electroporation (16.Chairoungdua A. Segawa H. Kim J.Y. Miyamoto K. Haga H. Fukui Y. Mizoguchi K. Ito H. Takeda E. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28845-28848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In brief, the cell suspension (800 μl, 2.4 × 106 cells/ml) was mixed with ry+LAT1 plasmid and 4F2hc plasmid (10 μg for each). The mixture was electroporated at 250 V, 960 μF in a 0.4-cm cuvette in a Gene Pulsar (Bio-Rad). The cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 3 days. They were then examined using an Ultima-z confocal laser scanning system (Meridian, Okemos, MI) connected to a Zeiss Epifluorescence microscope. The cells were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with Na+-containing medium (containing 137 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm MgSO4, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 0.34 mmK2HPO4, 4.2 mm NaHCO3, 5.5 mm glucose; pH 7.4) containing 5 μm3′-O-acetyl-2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-4(or 5)-carboxyfluorescein, diacetoxymethyl ester (26.Weinlich M. Heydasch U. Starlinger M. Kinne R.K.H. Z. Gastroenterol. (Verh.). 1997; 35: 263-270PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Weinlich M. Theib C. Lin C.-T. Kinne R.K.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 57-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dye-loaded cells were washed three times with Na+-containing medium or Na+-free medium, which was similar in composition to the Na+-containing medium except that NaCl was replaced by choline chloride, and then further incubated in the Na+-containing medium or Na+-free medium for fluorescence measurements. To examine the behavior of 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-4(or 5)-carboxyfluorescein in the dual-excitation mode, two laser sources were mounted on the confocal laser scanning system (26.Weinlich M. Heydasch U. Starlinger M. Kinne R.K.H. Z. Gastroenterol. (Verh.). 1997; 35: 263-270PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Weinlich M. Theib C. Lin C.-T. Kinne R.K.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 57-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The excitation light at 488 nm (pH-dependent wavelength) was provided by an argon ion laser. A He-Cd laser was used to adapt the confocal laser scanning microscope for excitation at 442 nm (pH-independent wavelength). The intensity of the fluorescence signal was measured with a photomultiplier and visualized on a personal computer. As reported for human and mouse y+LAT1 (13.Torrents D. Estevez R. Pineda M. Fernandez E. Lloberas J. Shi Y.-B. Zorzano A. Palacin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32437-32445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 14.Pfeiffer R. Rossier G. Spindler B. Meier C. Kuhn L. Verrey F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), ry+LAT1 required 4F2hc for its functional expression inXenopus oocytes (Fig.1 a). All the following experiments were therefore performed by coexpressing ry+LAT1 and 4F2hc. The uptake of 50 μm[14C]l-leucine or [14C]l-lysine was measured in the presence or absence of Na+. As shown in Fig. 1 b, leucine transport was dependent on the extracellular Na+, whereas lysine transport was not affected by the removal of Na+from the extracellular medium. It is noticeable that the low level of leucine transport still remained in the absence of Na+(Fig. 1 b). To determine which monovalent cations can take the place of Na+ to support leucine transport, the uptake of [14C]l-leucine (200 μm) was measured in Li+ uptake solution, high K+ uptake solution, and low pH uptake solution (Na+-free uptake solution with a pH of 5.5). The values were compared with that in Na+-free uptake solution, pH 7.5. As shown in Fig.2, Li+ was able to take the place of Na+ to support leucine transport. Leucine transport was increased by lowering the pH, whereas it was not affected by increased K+ concentration of the uptake solution (Fig.2). To determine the role of Na+ in ry+LAT1-mediated transport, the concentration dependence ofl-leucine transport and l-lysine transport was determined by measuring it in standard uptake solution (100 mm Na+) and in Na+-free uptake solution (0 mm Na+). Although theK m value for leucine transport into oocytes coexpressing ry+LAT1 and 4F2hc was dramatically increased in Na+-free uptake solution, theV max value was less affected (K m = 44 μm,V max = 6.7 pmol/oocyte/min in standard uptake solution containing Na+ 100 mm, andK m = 423 μm,V max = 4.8 pmol/oocyte/min in Na+-free uptake solution, both determined in the same batch of oocytes) (Fig. 3 a). On the other hand, neither the K m nor theV max value for lysine transport was affected by changing Na+ concentration (K m = 68 μm, V max = 9.0 pmol/oocyte/min in standard uptake solution containing Na+ 100 mm, and K m = 50 μm,V max = 7.8 pmol/oocyte/min in Na+-free uptake solution, both determined in the same batch of oocytes) (data not shown). The effect of pH on ry+LAT1-mediated transport was further examined by comparing the uptakes of 14C-labeled leucine and lysine at pH 7.5 and 5.5. Although the K m value for leucine transport was markedly altered with a change of pH of the uptake solution, the V max value was less affected (K m = 383 μm,V max = 5.7 pmol/oocyte/min in Na+-free uptake solution, pH 7.5, and K m= 119 μm, V max = 6.5 pmol/oocyte/min in Na+-free uptake solution, pH 5.5, both determined in the same batch of oocytes) (Fig. 3 b). On the other hand, neither the K m nor theV max value for lysine transport was affected with a change of pH (K m = 74 μm,V max = 7.6 pmol/oocyte/min in Na+-free uptake solution, pH 7.5, and K m= 81 μm, V max = 6.7 pmol/oocyte/min in Na+-free uptake solution, pH 5.5, both determined in the same batch of oocytes) (data not shown). The concentration dependence profiles of neither leucine nor lysine uptake measured in the standard uptake solution (100 mmNa+) were affected by the pH of the solution (data not shown). The uptake of 22Na+ was measured in the presence or absence of amino acids (200 μml-leucine or l-lysine) in the presence of 40 mm Na+ in the uptake medium containing ouabain, amiloride, and bumetanide to inhibit endogenous Na+ transport in the oocytes. In the oocytes coexpressing ry+LAT1 and 4F2hc, marked 22Na+uptake was detected in the presence of leucine in the medium, whereas no significant 22Na+ uptake was detected in the absence of leucine (Fig. 4 a). Lysine, however, did not induce 22Na+ uptake (Fig. 4 a). In the same batch of oocytes, the uptakes of 200 μm [14C]l-leucine and [14C]l-lysine were measured under the same conditions as for the 22Na+ uptake measurements to verify that the uptakes of [14C]l-leucine and [14C]l-lysine were almost identical (Fig.4 b). Leucine-induced 22Na+ uptake was calculated as the difference between the22Na+ uptakes measured in the presence and absence of leucine, and was compared with ry+LAT1-mediated [14C]l-leucine uptake. The ratio of the fluxes of 22Na+ and [14C]l-leucine was 1:0.88 (13.9 ± 2.6 pmol/oocyte/min for 22Na+ fluxversus 12.3 ± 1.0 pmol/oocyte/min for [14C]l-leucine flux, both determined in the same batch of oocytes, Fig. 4, a and b). To confirm the Na+:leucine stoichiometry, the dependence of leucine-induced 22Na+ uptake on the leucine concentration was compared with the concentration dependence of [14C]l-leucine uptake measured under the same conditions in the same batch of oocytes. 22Na+uptake and the [14C]l-leucine uptake exhibited almost identical dependence on the leucine concentration (K m = 71.8 μm andV max = 12.7 pmol/oocyte/min for22Na+ uptake; K m = 105.9 μm and V max = 14.8 pmol/oocyte/min for [14C]l-leucine uptake), indicating that the Na+ flux and leucine flux were well correlated (data not shown). The ratio of the V max values for22Na+ uptake and [14C]l-leucine uptake was calculated to be 1:1.17. 22Na+ uptake was further measured in a medium containing only trace levels of Na+ (0.28 μm). Addition of leucine (200 mm) to the medium increased the 22Na+ uptake, however, the level of uptake was still much lower than that of [14C]l-leucine uptake measured under the same conditions in the same batch of oocytes under the Na+ to leucine coupling ratio of 0.00015:1 (data not shown). Cotransport of H+ with amino acids was examined by measuring the intracellular pH changes induced by extracellularly applied amino acids in CHO cells cotransfected with ry+LAT1 and 4F2hc. As shown in Fig. 5, extracellularly applied leucine (1 mm) induced intracellular acidification in the Na+-free medium, whereas in a Na+-containing medium (141 mmNa+) extracellularly applied leucine had no effect on the intracellular pH. In contrast, extracellularly applied lysine (1 mm) did not induce intracellular pH changes regardless of the presence or absence of Na+ in the medium. No pH change was detected in the control mock-transfected CHO cells with the addition of amino acids to the medium (data not shown). Trans-stimulation of [14C]l-leucine uptake by intracellularly loaded amino acids was examined by microinjecting high concentrations of nonlabeled amino acids into the oocytes. As shown in Fig.6 a, the uptake of [14C]l-leucine measured in the standard uptake solution was stimulated by the intracellular injection ofl-lysine, whereas no such stimulatory effects on the uptake were observed following intracellular injection of neutral amino acids such as leucine. l-Arginine, l-ornithine, andl-histidine also trans-stimulated [14C]l-leucine uptake (data not shown). The effect of extracellularly applied l-leucine was examined on oocytes loaded with [14C]l-lysine. As shown in Fig.6 b, l-leucine applied extracellularly to the oocytes induced the marked efflux of preloaded [14C]l-lysine from the oocytes coexpressing ry+LAT1 and 4F2hc, indicating that ry+LAT1 is an amino acid exchanger. Na+ dependence of extracellularly applied amino acids to induce efflux of preloaded [14C]l-lysine was examined. As shown in Fig. 7, the efflux induced by l-leucine was dependent on extracellular Na+, whereas that induced by l-lysine was not affected by the removal of Na+ from the extracellular medium. In addition, the efflux induced by other neutral amino acids such as l-isoleucine, l-glutamine, andl-methionine was also reduced by the removal of Na+ (data not shown). The efflux induced byl-arginine and l-ornithine was not affected by the removal of Na+ (data not shown). To determine which intracellular amino acids were effectively exchanged via ry+LAT1, the efflux of preloaded [14C]l-amino acids was measured in the standard uptake solution (Na+ 100 mm) containing 100 μml-leucine. A high level of efflux of intracellularly injected 14C-labeled basic amino acids such as l-lysine, l-arginine, andl-ornithine was induced by extracellularly appliedl-leucine (Fig. 8). A lower level induction of the efflux of 14C-labeledl-leucine, l-methionine, andl-histidine was detected (Fig. 8). ry+LAT1-mediated l-lysine transport was not Na+dependent, whereas thel-leucine transport was, although not completely, dependent on Na+ (Fig. 1 b), consistent with previous observations on human and mouse y+LAT1s (13.Torrents D.

Rossier G. Spindler B. Meier C. Kuhn L. Verrey F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). As reported for the erythrocyte system y+L (20.Angelo S. Irarrazabal C. Deves R. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 153: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 21.Deves R. Boyd C.A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 487-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 28.Deves R. Angelo S. Boyd C.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 468: 753-766Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar), Na+ decreased the K m value forl-leucine uptake while not affecting that ofl-lysine uptake (Fig. 3 a), suggesting that Na+ increases the apparent affinity of neutral amino acid substrates for the substrate-binding site of ry+LAT1. Based on the observation that ry+LAT1 can still accept neutral amino acid substrates in the absence of Na+, it is suggested that some other monovalent cations may also support the binding of neutral amino acids in the absence of Na+ (Fig.1 b). As shown in Fig. 3 b, theK m value for l-leucine transport at pH 5.5 was lower than that at pH 7.5. Apparently, this is not due to the conformational changes of the transporter protein with the change of pH of the uptake solution, because l-lysine transport was not altered by the change of pH. It is proposed that H+ takes the place of Na+ in the absence of Na+ to support leucine transport. Besides Na+ and Li+, H+ is also capable of supporting the binding of neutral amino acid substrates to the substrate-binding site of ry+LAT1 (Fig.9 b). ry+LAT1 not only requires Na+ for the binding of neutral amino acids to its substrate-binding site, but it also translocates the Na+ along with neutral amino acids. As shown in Fig. 4, although l-leucine transport was accompanied by 22Na+ uptake, the transport ofl-lysine was not coupled with 22Na+transport, consistent with the observation that l-leucine transport was Na+-dependent, whereas that ofl-lysine was not dependent on Na+ (Fig.1 b). The Na+:l-leucine coupling ratio was 1:1 when measured in the presence of 40 mmNa+. In the presence of trace concentrations of Na+, however, the number of Na+ coupled with l-leucine was markedly reduced. Considering the pH dependence of [14C]l-leucine uptake in the absence of Na+, it is supposed that H+ instead of Na+ is cotransported with l-leucine in the presence of trace concentrations of Na+. In fact, as shown in Fig. 5, l-leucine induced intracellular acidification in CHO cells cotransfected with ry+LAT1 and 4F2hc cDNAs in the absence of extracellular Na+, lending support to the assumption of H+ cotransport. H+ was cotransported with l-leucine in the absence or presence of a low concentration of Na+ but not withl-lysine. Considering the low Na+:l-leucine coupling ratio (0.00015:1, see “Results”) in the presence of 0.28 μm Na+at pH 7.4 (0.04 μm H+), the affinity for H+ seems to be higher than that for Na+, provided that most of the leucine is cotransported with H+under this condition. In agreement with this observation, the affinity of the Na+/glucose cotransporter, which also accepts H+ in the absence of Na+, is also much higher for H+ than that for Na+ (29.Hirayama B.A. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21407-21410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As indicated above, Na+, H+, or Li+ is required for neutral amino acids to be accepted by ry+LAT1. Therefore, the positive charge on the side chains of basic amino acids or that conferred by inorganic monovalent cations is presumed to be required for the recognition of amino acid side chains by the substrate-binding site of ry+LAT1 (Fig. 9, a andb). It should be noted that ry+LAT1 is structurally related to the system y+ basic amino acid transporters CAT1, CAT2, CAT3, and CAT4 (∼30% identity at the amino acid level) (1.Palacin M. Estevez R. Bertran J. Zorzano A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 969-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 6.MacLeod C.L. Finley K.D. Kakuda D.K. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 109-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Deves R. Boyd C.A. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 487-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The substrate-binding sites of CATs bind specifically with basic amino acids. There is, however, an interesting exception: neutral amino acids, in particular l-homoserine, are accepted with low affinity by CAT1 in the presence of Na+ (30.Wang H. Kavanaugh M.P. North R.A. Kabat D. Nature. 1991; 352: 729-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), indicating that CAT1 behaves like a system y+L transporter, particulary for l-homoserine. It is, therefore, suggested that the binding sites of ry+LAT1 and CAT1 recognize the positive charges on the side chains of substrate amino acids by a similar mechanism, consistent with the structural similarity between the two proteins. Considering the requirement of positive charges for substrate binding, it is reasonable to assume that the binding sites of ry+LAT1 and possibly those of the other system y+L transporters (KIAA0245/y+LAT2 from humans (13.Torrents D. Estevez R. Pineda M. Fernandez E. Lloberas J. Shi Y.-B. Zorzano A. Palacin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32437-32445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) and SPRM-1 from Schistosoma mansoni (9.Mastroberardino L. Spindler B. Pfeiffer R. Skelly P.J. Loffing J. Shoemaker C.B. Verrey F. Nature. 1998; 395: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar)) contain negatively charged amino acid residues to accept the positive charges of the basic amino acid side chains or of the inorganic cations with neutral amino acid side chains (Fig. 9, a and b). The positive charge recognition site is probably located at a certain distance from the α-carbon recognition site. Therefore, for neutral amino acids to be the substrates of ry+LAT1, the length of the side chains must be within a limited range, so that the side chains accompanied with inorganic cations can fit well into the binding site of ry+LAT1. l-Leucine,l-isoleucine, l-methionine, andl-glutamine, which are accepted by ry+LAT1, are predicted to meet this requirement. The positive charge recognition site of ry+LAT1 accepts inorganic cations with the following proposed order of affinity: H+ > Li+ > Na+ ≫ K+. Some of the Na+-binding sites of Na+-dependent transporters accept not only Na+ but also other inorganic monovalent cations such as H+ and Li+. As already mentioned, the Na+/glucose cotransporter accepts H+ in the absence of Na+ (29.Hirayama B.A. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21407-21410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In glutamate transporters, it is proposed that one of the three Na+-binding sites is specific for Na+, whereas the other two are less specific and also accept Li+ (31.Grunewald M. Kanner B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17017-17024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The broad cation selectivity of the positive charge recognition site of ry+LAT1 is reminiscent of the less specific Na+-binding sites of Na+-dependent transporters. The positive charge recognition site of the system y+L transporters may be a primitive form of Na+-binding sites; hence, system y+L transporters might be the evolutionary link between Na+-independent transporters and Na+-dependent transporters. Consistent with theXenopus oocyte endogenous system y+L activity stimulated by the injection of 4F2hc cRNA and the mouse y+LAT1 coexpressed with 4F2hc in Xenopus oocytes (14.Pfeiffer R. Rossier G. Spindler B. Meier C. Kuhn L. Verrey F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 32.Chillaron J. Estevez R. Mora C. Wagner C.A. Suessbrich H. Lang F. Lluis Gelpi J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17761-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), ry+LAT1 mediated amino acid exchange (Fig.6 b). ry+LAT1-mediated uptake was trans-stimulated by substrate amino acids (Fig. 6 a). In addition, the extracellular substrate selectivity and Na+dependence for the efflux of preloaded [14C]l-lysine were basically identical to those of the uptakes of [14C]amino acids (Fig. 7). These results indicate that the amino acid efflux is tightly coupled to amino acid uptake, suggesting that ry+LAT1 mediates an obligatory exchange of substrate amino acids. The efflux of intracellularly injected 14C-labeled basic amino acids such as l-lysine, l-arginine, andl-ornithine was efficiently induced by extracellularly applied amino acid substrates (Fig. 8). In contrast, the efflux of14C-labeled neutral amino acids such as glutamine, leucine, isoleucine, and methionine was low, although they are also substrates of y+LAT1 in the standard uptake solution. This is understandable when considering the low intracellular concentration of Na+. It is assumed that a sufficient concentration of Na+ is required for neutral amino acid substrates to bind not only to the extracellular binding sites but also to the intracellular binding sites. It has been proposed that, in the renal proximal tubules and small intestine, basic amino acids are absorbed from the luminal fluid via system b0,+ transporter situated on the apical membrane of the epithelial cells and pass through the basolateral membrane via system y+L transporter into the extracellular fluid and blood stream (32.Chillaron J. Estevez R. Mora C. Wagner C.A. Suessbrich H. Lang F. Lluis Gelpi J. Testar X. Busch A.E. Zorzano A. Palacin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17761-17770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The results of our present investigation indicate that ry+LAT1 can fulfill this task once it exists on the basolateral membrane of the epithelial cells along with 4F2hc, which has already been shown to be localized on the basolateral membrane (33.Nakamura E. Sato M. Yang H. Miyagawa F. Harasaki M. Tomita K. Matsuoka S. Noma A. Iwai K. Minato N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3009-3016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 8, intracellularly loaded basic amino acids, but not neutral amino acids, in fact, efficiently moved out of the cells via ry+LAT1 through the amino acid exchange mechanism, probably because the intracellular substrate-binding site prefers basic amino acids to neutral amino acids due to the low intracellular concentrations of Na+. Thus, ry+LAT1 appears to be well suited as an exit path for basic amino acids. We are grateful to Hisako Ohba and Michi Takahashi for their technical assistance."

Western blot analysis with antibodies against recombinant TFS demonstrated that this protein is not a subunit of the RNA polymerase. In vitro transcription experiments with paused elongation complexes at position +25 showed that TFS is able to induce cleavage activity in the archaeal RNA polymerase in a similar manner to TFIIS. In the presence of TFS, the cleavage activity of the RNA polymerase truncates the RNA back to position +15 by releasing mainly dinucleotides from the 3′-end of the nascent RNA. Furthermore, TFS reduces the amount of non-chaseable elongation complexes at position +25 as well as position +45.

It seems to be clear now that initiation of transcription in Archaea is mediated by two basal transcription factors, archaeal TATA box-binding protein (aTBP)1 and TFB, which are orthologous to the eukaryotic TATA box-binding protein and TFIIB (reviewed in Refs. 1.Thomm M.

These two factors together with RNA polymerase are necessary and sufficient for initiation of in vitro transcription at some promoters (4.Hausner W. Wettach J. Hethke C. Thomm M. J. Biol.

Analysis of the genomes of Methanococcus jannaschii, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum,Pyrococcus horikoshii, and Archaeoglobus fulgidusindicated that there are, with the exception of a putative α-subunit of TFIIE, no further eukaryote-like initiation factors corresponding to TFIIA, TFIIF, or TFIIH (6.Bult C.J.

Interestingly the genome sequences revealed the presence of a putative transcription factor, which could be involved in the elongation of transcription. The sequence of this protein was first identified in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius and was suggested to be a homologue to the eukaryotic elongation factor TFIIS (10.Langer D. Zillig W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Identification of an additional candidate in Thermococcus celer and a detailed analysis of the sequence similarity of these proteins to eukaryotic counterparts revealed that the archaeal TFIIS-like protein is much more likely to be a subunit of the archaeal RNA polymerase than a transcription factor with a similar function to eukaryotic TFIIS (3.Bell S.D. Jackson S.P. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 222-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar,11.Kaine B.P. Mehr I.J. Woese C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Several lines of evidence support this suggestion. First, the archaeal genes code for proteins that are ∼120 amino acids in size, whereas the eukaryotic TFIIS proteins are much larger (∼300 amino acids). Second, the archaeal proteins contain two putative zinc-binding domains instead of the single domain found in eukaryotic TFIIS proteins. Third, eukaryotic RNA pol I, II, and III contain related subunits (A12.6, B12.2, and C11) of similar size and two zinc-binding motifs. Fourth, owing to the close evolutionary relationship of the archaeal and eukaryotic RNA polymerases, one would expect to find a homologous subunit in the archaeal RNA polymerase. Since there are no biochemical data available at this time about the role of these proteins in Archaea, we have analyzed the function of the archaeal TFIIS/RPSU (RNA polymerasesubunit) homologue in a Methanococcus thermolithotrophicus cell-free transcription system. We show here that this protein is not associated with the RNA polymerase, but is able to induce RNA cleavage in the archaeal RNA polymerase similar to eukaryotic TFIIS. [γ-32P]ATP and [α-32P]UTP were purchased from Hartmann Bioanalytics (Braunschweig, Germany). Restriction endonucleases and other DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from Fermentas or New England Biolabs Inc. The plasmid pIC-31/30PRO-C25 used in this study is based on the tRNAValpromoter of Methanococcus vannielii (15.Hausner W. Frey G. Thomm M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 495-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The cytosine residues in the region from positions +2 to +25 were substituted by other bases (see Fig. 3 A) using PCR and the plasmid pIC-31/30 as template. The forward primer was complementary to sequences ∼120 bp upstream of the transcription start site, and the reverse primer was partly complementary to sequences from positions −4 to +41. After hydrolyzing the amplified fragment withHindIII, a 90-bp fragment containing the promoter and the mutated region downstream of the transcription start site of the tRNAVal gene was isolated and cloned between theHindIII and SmaI (compatible to the blunt ends on one site of the fragment produced by PCR amplification) restriction sites of the vector pIC-20H. The resulting plasmid, pIC-31/30PRO-C25, allowing transcription in the absence of CTP until position +25, was used to generate an ∼500-bp transcription template by PCR amplification. Oligonucleotides complementary to sequences ∼380 bp upstream of the start site and ∼120 bp downstream were used as primers. The upstream primer was labeled with biotin, and the resulting fragment was attached to streptavidin magnetic beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The immobilized DNA templates were used in all transcription experiments except that presented in Fig. 1.Figure 1The TFIIS/RPSU homologue is not necessary forin vitro transcription.

The cytosine residues in the region from positions +26 to +45 were mutated by using the primer 5′-TGAATTCGAGCTCGGTAACCCCATTATTCAAATTTACTTACATT-3′ and a reverse primer complementary to sequences ∼380 bp upstream of the start site. The amplified insert was hydrolyzed with SapI andEcoRI and inserted between the SapI andEcoRI restriction sites of plasmid pIC-31/30PRO-C25 to generate pIC-31/30PRO-C45. RNA polymerase fromMc. thermolithotrophicus was purified as described previously (16.Hausner W. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24047-24052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The coding region of aTBP (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AJ271331) was subcloned using PCR amplification to generate the coding region with an NdeI restriction site at the 5′-end of the sequence and a BamHI site at the 3′-end. The amplified insert was then cloned between the NdeI and BamHI restriction sites of the pET14b expression vector to generate pTBPMth.14, allowing expression of aTBP with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. BL21(DE3) pLysS cells containing the pTBPMth.14 plasmid were grown to A 600 = 0.8 at 25 °C. Expression of the proteins was induced by addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation 3 h after induction, resuspended in buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, and 20% glycerol), and disrupted by passage through a French press cell. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C (100,000 ×g for 20 min), and aTBP was purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (QIAGEN Inc.), MonoQ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and Superdex 200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) chromatography. The purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stored at −70 °C. The coding region of TFB (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AJ271467) was subcloned using PCR amplification to generate the coding region with anNdeI restriction site at the 5′-end of the sequence. The amplified insert was then cloned between the NdeI andEcoRV restriction sites of the pET17b expression vector to generate pTFBMth.17. BL21(DE3) cells containing the pTFBMth.17 plasmid were grown to A 600 = 0.8 at 37 °C. Protein expression and preparation of crude extract with buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 300 mm NaCl) were done as described for aTBP. TFB was purified by HiTrap heparin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and Superdex 200 chromatography. Construction of the expression clones pTFSMth.14 and pTFSMth.17 (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AJ271332) was done as described above, the first one allowing expression of TFIIS/RPSU with an N-terminal hexahistidine tag and the second one without N-terminal fusion. Protein expression and preparation of crude extract with buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mmNaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) were also done as described before. After heat treatment (85 °C, 15 min) followed by centrifugation, the recombinant TFIIS/RPSU homologue remained in the supernatant and was further purified by MonoQ (pTFSMth.17) or Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (pTFSMth.14) and Superdex 200 (both) chromatography. The Purified untagged TFIIS/RPSU homologue (500 μg) was used for immunization of a rabbit. Immunization was performed by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium) following a standard immunization protocol. The anti-TFIIS/RPSU IgG fractions were isolated from the serum by affinity chromatography on protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The anti-TFIIS/RPSU IgG fraction was further purified by affinity chromatography on a column with the covalently fixed recombinant TFIIS/RPSU homologue. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (17.Hausner W. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17649-17651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In vitrotranscription experiments were formed in 25-μl reaction mixtures that contained 190 fmol of template, 0.8 pmol of purified RNA polymerase, 1.7 pmol of recombinant aTBP, 1.7 pmol of recombinant TFB, 40 μm ATP/GTP/CTP, and 4 μm[α-32P]UTP (370 Bq/pmol) in transcription buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.5 at 20 °C, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 40 mm KCl, and 3 mm dithiothreitol) for 30 min at 55 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 12.5 μl of loading buffer (98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol). Analysis of transcripts and nonspecific transcription were performed as described previously (16.Hausner W. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24047-24052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ternary complexes stalled at position +25 (see Fig. 3) were formed in 250-μl reaction mixtures that contained 1 pmol of template pIC-31/30PRO-C25 bound to magnetic beads, 8 pmol of purified RNA polymerase, 17 pmol of recombinant aTBP, and 17 pmol of recombinant TFB in transcription buffer. After a 60-min preincubation at 21 °C, the reaction was started by addition of 40 μm ATP/GTP and 4 μm[α-32P]UTP (370 Bq/pmol). After 20 min at 55 °C, the supernatant was separated from the magnetic beads; and the beads were washed twice with WAC buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 40 mm KCl, 3 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1% N-lauroylsarcosine), resuspended in 200 μl of 1.25-fold transcription buffer, distributed in 20-μl fractions, and supplemented with the components indicated on top of each figure in a total volume of 25 μl to achieve 1-fold transcription buffer. After further incubation for cleavage, the reactions were terminated as described before. In some cases, aliquots of the reactions were chased before termination by addition of 40 μm unlabeled nucleotides and further incubation for 10 min at 55 °C. RNA size markers were formed by in vitrotranscription in the presence of 3′-dATP (100 μm). UpG (250 μm) was labeled at 37 °C for 30 min in a volume of 20 μl with T4 polynucleotide kinase (0.5 unit/μl) and [γ-32P]ATP (9000 Bq/μl) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mmdithiothreitol. The reactions were diluted in transcription and loading buffers. To investigate the function of the archaeal TFIIS/RPSU homologue, we first cloned and sequenced the corresponding gene from Mc. thermolithotrophicus. This gene was then expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant proteins with (lane 1) and without (lane 2) an N-terminal histidine tag are shown in Fig.1 A. To address the question of whether this protein is a component of the Methanococcus in vitro transcription system (18.Frey G. Thomm M. Brudigam B. Gohl H.P. Hausner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1361-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), all components of the cell-free system were challenged with antibodies raised against the recombinant TFIIS/RPSU homologue. Western blot analysis showed that the antibody against the recombinant TFIIS/RPSU homologue bound to a polypeptide in the crude extract of the same size as the recombinant protein (Fig.1 B, lanes 4 and 5), demonstrating that this protein is expressed in Methanococcus. No binding of the antibodies was observed in the samples containing the purified RNA polymerase or, as expected, recombinant transcription factor aTBP or TFB (lanes 1–3). Since these three components are sufficient for in vitro transcription of the tRNAVal gene (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1–4), this protein is not an essential component for standard in vitro transcription. Addition of this protein to in vitro transcription reactions slightly decreased RNA synthesis (compare lanes 5–8 with 1–4). The RNA polymerase used for in vitrotranscription is purified by four chromatographic steps (16.Hausner W. Thomm M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24047-24052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the archaeal TFIIS/RPSU homologue was lost during the purification procedure. To exclude this possibility, we chromatographed crude cell-free extract on a gel filtration column and analyzed the different fractions for RNA polymerase activity and for the presence of the archaeal TFIIS/RPSU homologue. The bulk of the RNA polymerase with a molecular mass of >400 kDa was eluted in fractions 23–27, as analyzed by a nonspecific transcription assay (Fig.2 A). Western blot analysis of fractions 21–39 using an antibody against the largest subunit of the RNA polymerase confirmed the profile of the nonspecific RNA polymerase assay (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, the bulk of the TFIIS/RPSU homologue eluted in fractions 33–37, as shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 7–9 with the lane containing the recombinant TFIIS/RPSU homologue). An additional protein that was also recognized by the anti-TFIIS/RPSU antibody in the crude extract is labeled with a question mark. Since the RNA polymerase and the homologue eluted in different fractions, we assume that this protein is not a subunit of the RNA polymerase. The function of eukaryotic TFIIS has been analyzed by incubating stalled elongation complexes with TFIIS in the absence of nucleotides. For similar analysis of the archaeal TFIIS/RPSU homologue, we have set up a system allowing stalling of the elongation complex on the tRNAValpromoter at position +25. The template was immobilized on magnetic beads using a streptavidin-biotin linkage; transcription of this template in the absence of CTP positioned the elongation complex at position +25 (Fig. 3 B,lane 1). Besides the expected G25 RNA product (the transcript and the corresponding stalled complex is termed G25 according to the type and the position of the last incorporated nucleotide), several smaller abortive RNA products were generated, which were removed by repeated washing of the elongation complex (lane 2), indicating that these products were already released from the ternary complex. The washed elongation complexes were still active since, after addition of unlabeled nucleotides, the stalled transcript disappeared almost completely, and the 121-nt runoff transcript was formed (lane 3). To analyze the function of the TFIIS/RPSU homologue, we incubated washed G25 elongation complexes with (Fig.4, lane 13) or without (lane 3) the TFIIS/RPSU homologue. Addition of the TFIIS/RPSU homologue dramatically increased truncation of the nascent transcript (compare lanes 3 and 13). The truncation required Mg2+ (compare lanes 1 and3 as well as lanes 11 and 13), which could be substituted by Mn2+ (compare lanes 3and 5). Shortened RNAs remained in active ternary complexes, as nearly all of them could be elongated when unlabeled NTPs were added (lanes 4 and 14). To address the question of whether truncation of the RNA in the absence of the TFIIS/RPSU homologue is mainly driven by pyrophosphorolysis due to low levels of endogenous pyrophosphate still bound to the washed elongation complexes, we added pyrophosphate in low concentrations (according to the low nucleotide concentrations used in the in vitro transcription reactions) to the G25 ternary complexes (Fig. 4, lane 9). Since addition of pyrophosphate had only a moderate influence on cleavage stimulation in the absence of the TFIIS/RPSU homologue (compare lanes 3 and 9), we assume that the RNA polymerase itself is able to drive the cleavage reaction. To investigate the mechanism of the archaeal TFIIS/RPSU-induced cleavage in more detail and to get more information about RNA cleavage of the RNA polymerase itself, we have studied the time course of RNA truncation either in the absence or presence of the TFIIS/RPSU homologue. After a 1- or 2-min incubation of the washed elongation complexes in the presence of the TFIIS/RPSU homologue, the RNA in the G25 ternary complex was shortened in part to position −21 or −19, whereas the 15-nt elongation complex was barely detectable (Fig. 5, lanes 8 and9). After a 15-min incubation, the RNA was completely truncated to position +15 (lane 11), whereas further incubation for 30 or 45 min did not result in further retraction of the RNA (lanes 12 and 13). Therefore, the time dependence of the cleavage pattern indicated that the TFIIS/RPSU homologue induced stepwise truncation of the RNA up to position +15. These 15-nt ternary complexes seem to be very stable since further truncation of the RNA did not occur. Cleavage activity in the absence of the TFIIS/RPSU homologue was dramatically reduced and was combined with the formation of some intermediate cleavage products and a slow accumulation of a 10-nt RNA (lanes 1–6). Addition of unlabeled nucleotides to the truncated RNAs revealed that all of these ternary complexes can continue elongation, except the 10-nt RNA accumulated in the absence of the TFIIS/RPSU homologue (lanes 7 and 14). The results obtained so far indicate that the archaeal TFIIS/RPSU homologue seems to have a function in archaeal transcription similar to that of TFIIS in eukaryotic pol II transcription. An additional feature of TFIIS-induced cleavage on stalled elongation complexes is the release of predominantly dinucleotides (19.Izban M.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12864-12873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we have investigated the cleavage products released from retracted archaeal elongation complexes. For this analysis, washed G25 complexes were incubated for 45 min either in the absence or presence of the TFIIS/RPSU homologue. In the presence of the archaeal TFIIS/RPSU homologue, truncation of G25 ternary complexes was correlated with the release of dinucleotides (Fig. 6, lane 5). The 10-nt truncation of the 25- to the 15-nt RNA from the 3′-end in perfect dinucleotide increments should result in the release of the following five dinucleotides from the 3′-end: pApG,pUpA, pUpG, pApA, andpUpU (the labeled phosphates are underlined; see also Fig. 3 A for the sequence). Using labeled pUpG and pApU as markers, we could demonstrate that the G25 complex liberates, in the presence of the TFIIS/RPSU homologue, the dinucleotides pUpG, pUpA, and most likely pUpU. Please note that the relative mobility of the dinucleotide pUpU is known to be slightly increased compared with that of pUpA in this gel system (19.Izban M.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12864-12873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Bobkova E.V. Hall B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22832-22839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we assume that each of the bands corresponding to the expected pUpG and pUpA dinucleotides represents a mixture of pUpG/pGpU and pUpA/pApU, respectively. This assumption seems to be confirmed by the results of the calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase procedure (lane 7). Further treatment of the reaction including the 45-min incubation in the presence of the TFIIS/RPSU homologue was combined with a reduced electrophoretic mobility of the released dinucleotides, which indicates that the released dinucleotides contained a 5′-phosphate. Furthermore, we found, according to the distribution of the radioactive label and according to the behavior on the gel (20.Bobkova E.V. Hall B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22832-22839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), most probably the three different dinucleotides GpU, ApU, and UpU instead of the predicted UpU, if retraction occurs in perfect dinucleotide increments. The most possible explanation for this finding is that the TFIIS/RPSU-induced truncation occurs in dinucleotide as well as mononucleotide increments because the removal of mononucleotides during the truncation process converted the predicted pUpG and pUpA dinucleotides into pGpU and pApU. The large amount of probably GpU could be caused most likely by a preference for releasing pGpU instead of pUpG. Beside the dinucleotides, the G25 complexes also released a “non-chaseable” 10-nt RNA, which is the major product in the absence and a minor product in the presence of the archaeal TFIIS/RPSU homologue (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and 5; see also Fig.5, lanes 7 and 14, for the chase experiment). Separation of bound and released RNAs revealed that the 10-nt RNA was released from the elongation complex (Fig. 6, lanes 1–3). Furthermore, ribonuclease T1 treatment increased the electrophoretic mobility, but did not change the amount of incorporated radioactivity. This indicates that the 10-nt RNA represents the sequence from the 3′-end and not from the 5′-end (Fig. 6, lane 4; see Fig.3 A sequence for details). Since one major function of eukaryotic TFIIS is to aid RNA pol II at arrest sites, we have addressed the question of whether the archaeal TFIIS/RPSU homologue is able to prevent the RNA polymerase from going into arrest or to rescue arrested elongation complexes. For this analysis, we chased washed G25 elongation complexes (Fig. 7, lane 1) into a 424-nt runoff transcript either in the presence or absence of the archaeal TFIIS/RPSU homologue (lanes 2 and 3). In agreement with Fig. 3, most of the G25 elongation complexes could continue elongation after addition of nucleotides, but there were some elongation complexes that could not resume elongation. The amount of these complexes was very low; but most important, in the presence of the TFIIS/RPSU homologue, the amount of these non-chaseable complexes was reduced to about one-half (Fig. 7, compare lanes 2 and3). We assume that most of these complexes that could not continue transcription were arrested because they were not released from the elongation complexes (data not shown). Since longer incubation of the washed elongation complexes for 2 or 24 h at 0 °C or 2 h at 55 °C before the chase reaction did not increase the amount of arrested complexes (Fig. 7, lanes 5 and 6; and data not shown), we have analyzed pIC-31/30PRO-C45 as another template. This template is based on the promoter of pIC-31/30PRO-C25 with the difference that transcription in the absence of CTP positions the elongation complex at position +45 instead of +25. Washed A45 elongation complexes were prepared as described above and chased into the runoff transcript in the presence and absence of the TFIIS/RPSU homologue. As for the G25 complexes, the amount of arrested complexes was still very low, but in the presence of the TFIIS/RPSU homologue, the formation of arrested elongation complexes at position +45 was completely abolished (lanes 8 and 9). Please note that, in the presence of the TFIIS/RPSU homologue, the amount of runoff transcripts was also slightly increased in each case. Taken together, the reduction of the amount of arrested complexes at position +25 and the elimination of arrested complexes at position +45 are strong indications that the archaeal TFIIS/RPSU homologue is able to prevent or to rescue arrested elongation complexes and therefore is able to catalyze a similar function like TFIIS.

J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1981; 13: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This lipid consists of a hydrophobic isoprenoid tail and a quinone head group. The tail varies in length depending on the organism studied, but its purpose is to anchor Q to the membrane. The quinone head group is responsible for the activity of Q in the respiratory chain. It undergoes reversible redox cycling between the quinone (Q), semiquinone, and hydroquinone (QH2) forms. In eukaryotes, Q acts in the inner mitochondrial membrane to shuttle electrons from Complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) or Complex II (succinate dehydrogenase) to Complex III (the cytochrome bc 1 complex). It is thought that extramitochondrial ubiquinone acts as a lipid-soluble antioxidant, capable of scavenging lipid peroxyl radicals directly (2.Ernster L. Forsmark-Andree P. Clin. Invest. 1993; 71: s60-s65Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) or indirectly by reducing α-tocopherol radicals (3.Kagan V. Serbinova E. Packer L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Q is used widely as a dietary supplement and in various clinical therapies, although the mechanisms of its uptake, distribution to tissues, and modes of action remain obscure. In young rats, Q supplementation increases levels of Q in only the blood and liver but does not produce elevated levels in other tissues (11.Zhang Y. Turunen M. Appelkvist E.L. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 2089-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, there is a growing body of evidence that Q supplementation in aged rats and mice increases Q levels in mitochondria of other tissues as well (12.Matthews R.T. Yang L. Browne S. Baik M.

Q is the only lipid-soluble antioxidant that can be synthesized by mammalian cells, and it plays critical roles in the defense mechanisms of the cell. Given the diverse beneficial effects of Q, it is important to identify and functionally characterize human genes involved in the Q biosynthetic pathway. The proposed biosynthetic pathway of Q was elucidated by the characterization of accumulating Q biosynthetic intermediates inEscherichia coli and S. cerevisiae Q-deficient mutants (16.Meganathan G. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E.

Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,19.Jonassen T. Clarke C.F. Kagan V.E. Quinn P.J. Coenzyme Q: From Molecular Mechanisms to Nutrition and Health. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2000Google Scholar). Such mutants are respiratory-deficient and are therefore unable to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources such as glycerol. TheCOQ3 gene product was originally identified as theO-methyltransferase responsible for converting 3,4-dihydroxy-5-hexaprenylbenzoic acid (Fig.1, compound 1) to 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-5-hexaprenylbenzoic acid (compound 2) (20.Clarke C.F. Williams W. Teruya J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16636-16644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This was confirmed both by amino acid sequence analysis, which showed that Coq3p contains four conserved motifs identified for the family of AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases (21.Kagan R.M. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), andin vitro methyltransferase assays (22.Shepherd J.A. Poon W.W. Myles D.C. Clarke C.F. Tetrahedron Lett. 1996; 37: 2395-2398Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar), in which the farnesylated analogue of compound 1 required functional Coq3p to be methylated to form farnesylated compound 2. Recent evidence indicates that Coq3p is a promiscuous methyltransferase; it is responsible not only for the firstO-methyltransferase step, but the final one as well, converting demethyl-QH2 (compound 3) to QH2 (compound 4) (23.Poon W.W. Barkovich R.J. Hsu A.Y. Frankel A. Lee P.T. Shepherd J.N. Myles D.C. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21665-21672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This is analogous to theE. coli system in which the UbiGp is required for both the first and last O-methylation steps (24.Hsu A.Y. Poon W.W. Shepherd J.A. Myles D.C. Clarke C.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9797-9806Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Similar in vitro studies show that this O-methyltransferase activity is conserved between rat and yeast. Yeast mitochondria isolated from yeast coq3 null mutants rescued with the ratCoq3 cDNA are capable of methylating these farnesylated analogues as well (23.Poon W.W. Barkovich R.J. Hsu A.Y. Frankel A.

This study describes the isolation and characterization of the human homologue of COQ3. This homologue was obtained by screening a human heart cDNA library with the rat Coq3 gene. The ability of this human homologue to restore Q synthesis in a yeastcoq3 null mutant is described in terms of growth on glycerol, Q levels, and methyltransferase activity. The S. cerevisiaestrain used in this study was JM45Δcoq3 (MATa,leu2–3, -112, ura3–52, trp1–289, his4–580, coq3::LEU2) (20.Clarke C.F. Williams W. Teruya J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16636-16644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Growth media for yeast were prepared as described (25.Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1990: 177-180Google Scholar) and included YPG (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 3% glycerol), SDC (0.18% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% dextrose, 0.14% NaH2PO4, 0.5% (NH4)2SO4, and complete amino acid supplement), and SD-Ura (SDC, but the amino acid supplement lacks uracil). The supplement was modified so that the final concentrations of the components were as follows: 80 mg/liter adenine sulfate, uracil, tryptophan, histidine, methionine, and cysteine; 40 mg/liter arginine and tyrosine; 120 mg/liter leucine; 60 mg/liter isoleucine, lysine, and phenylalanine; 100 mg/liter glutamic acid and aspartic acid; 150 mg/liter valine; 200 mg/liter threonine; and 400 mg/liter serine. Yeast were grown at 30 °C with shaking. The rat Coq3homologue was used to screen a Lambda ZAP II human heart cDNA library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A DNA segment containing part of the rat Coq3 cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with primers pCC-1 (5′-GGAAGCTTCGCTTTCTCAGGGAACCAGCTCAC-3′) and pCC-2 (5′-CCCTCGAGCCCCCTTTCAAGCAGACTCAGCAG-3′) with pAB-3 (26.Marbois B.N. Hsu A. Pillai R. Colicelli J. Clarke C.F. Gene. 1994; 138: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) as template DNA. The resulting polymerase chain reaction product, containing 70 nucleotides of 5′ untranslated sequence and extending through amino acid 257 of the rat Coq3 coding region, was digested with HinDIII and XhoI and subcloned into the HinDIII and XhoI sites of pYES2 (Invitrogen) to create pCCAB3–4. The rat Coq3 probe was prepared by digesting pCCAB3–4 (Table I) withHinDIII and XhoI to release the 937-base pair insert. The insert was then size selected on an agarose gel and labeled with [α32-P]dCTP (specific activity, 3000 Ci/mmol, ICN Biochemicals, Costa Mesa, CA) with an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech oligolabeling kit. A Stratagene NucTrap push column was used to separate unincorporated nucleotides from the radiolabeled ratCoq3 probe. The primary library screen was done on approximately 1 × 106 plaque-forming units grown on XL1-Blue MRF′ (5 × 104 plaque-forming units/plate, 20 plates). The nitrocellulose filters were hybridized overnight at 57 °C with approximately 1 ng of 32P-labeled probe/ml of hybridization buffer. The filters were washed two times for 30 min each at 57 °C with 2× SSC-0.1% SDS and two times in 0.5× SSC-0.1% SDS at 50 °C (once for 1.5 h and once for 30 min). 1× SSC is 0.15m sodium chloride, 0.015 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0. The filters were placed under x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) with double intensifying screens and placed at −80 °C. The primary screen resulted in only one potential positive. The phagemid, phCOQ3, was recovered with the ExAssist/SOLR system (Stratagene), and restriction enzyme digests with SstI and KpnI revealed an approximately 1.3-kilobase pair insert.Table IDescriptions and sources of clonesCloneDescriptionSourcePCCAB3–4Rat Coq3 in pYES2This studyphCOQ3HumanCoq3 in pBluescriptThis studypscQ3–1HumanCoq3 in pAH01 (single copy)This studypmcQ3–1Human Coq3 in pCH1 (multicopy)This studypRS12A2-SmaYeast COQ3 in pRS316 (single copy)Ref. 20.Clarke C.F.

JM45Δcoq3 harboring either pRS12A2-Sma, pscQ3–1, or pmcQ3–1 was grown to saturation in SD-Ura. Those strains capable of growing on YPG, namely those harboring pRS12A2-Sma or pmcQ3–1, were also cultured in YPG. Cells were collected by centrifugation (10 min at 624 × g and 4 °C), resuspended in 10 ml of H2O, and transferred to 50-ml preweighed glass tubes. Cells were collected by centrifugation as before and resuspended in 12 ml of H2O. Three 1-ml aliquots were taken of each sample, and the cell pellet wet weights were determined. The cell pellets were dried for 48 h at 37 °C, and the dry cell weight determined. The ratio of dry to wet weight of the 1-ml aliquots was used to calculate the dry weight of the remaining sample. The remaining cell suspensions (9 ml) were again centrifuged, and the total wet weight of the cell pellet was determined. Glass beads (10 times the cell pellet wet weight) and H2O (3.5 times the pellet wet weight) were added, and 4 μl of Q9 (1.38 μg/μl) was also added as an internal standard. The tubes were then flooded with argon, capped, covered with foil, and kept on ice. Cells were lysed by vortexing for 2 min. Lipids were extracted by adding 9 ml of methanol and 6 ml of petroleum ether and vortexing for 30 s. The phases were separated by centrifugation (10 min at 624 × g and 4 °C). The upper petroleum ether layer was transferred to a 10-ml glass tube. 4 ml of petroleum ether was added to the glass bead-aqueous phase, and the samples were vortexed for 30 s. The petroleum ether layers from a total of three extractions were pooled and dried under nitrogen. The lipids were resuspended in 1 ml of 9:1 MeOH/EtOH. Q6H2, Q6, and Q9 were separated by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography with a C18 column (Alltech Econosphere 5-μm, 4.6 × 250-mm column) and quantitated with an ESA Coulochem II electrochemical detector (E1, –450 mV; E2, 500 mV). The mobile phase was used at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and consisted of methanol/ethanol/2-propanol (88/24/10) and 13.4 mm lithium perchlorate. Q6H2, Q6, and Q9 were quantitated directly from the electrical chemical defector results using external standards of Q6 and Q9, and Q6H2(extinction coefficients, EM275 nm: Q6, 14,900 m−1 cm−1; Q9, 14,700 m−1 cm−1; EM290 nm: Q6H2, 4921m−1 cm−1 (31.Hatefi Y.

The synthesis of 3,4-dihydroxy-5-farnesylbenzoic acid (compound 1), demethyl-ubiquinone-3 (compound 3), and 2-farnesyl-6-hydroxyphenol (compound 5) have been described previously (22.Shepherd J.A.

The background level of radioactivity was determined by averaging the counts found in the fractions representing the expected product peak for the vector control. This value was considered background and was subtracted from all samples. Approximately 1 × 106 plaque-forming units from a Lambda ZAP II human heart cDNA library were transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were then hybridized with 32P-labeled rat Coq3 cDNA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” One potential positive was discovered in this primary screen. Two subsequent screenings of this candidate verified that it in fact had homology to the ratCoq3 cDNA. The phagemid was isolated and designated phCOQ3. Fig.2 shows the nucleotide and the resulting amino acid sequences of the 1.3-kilobase pair insert of phCOQ3. The cDNA contained a 933-nucleotide open reading frame encoding a 311-amino acid polypeptide. The amino-terminal region contains many basic and hydroxylated residues; there are no acidic amino acids until position 34. These features are consistent with a classic mitochondrial targeting sequence (33.Hartl F.-U. Pfanner N. Nicholson D.W. Neupert W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 1-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). In fact, the yeast Coq3p has been shown to reside within the mitochondrial matrix (23.Poon W.W. Barkovich R.J. Hsu A.Y. Frankel A. Lee P.T. Shepherd J.N. Myles D.C. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21665-21672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The predicted amino acid sequence also contains four regions that are conserved among methyltransferase enzymes that utilize S-adenosylmethionine as a methyl donor (21.Kagan R.M. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). These regions are underlined in Fig. 2. Regions I, post-I, II, and III are amino acids 91–99, 112–116, 155–162, and 182–191, respectively. Fig. 3 displays an alignment between the COQ3 homologues in human, rat,Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans,S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, Candida albicans, E. coli, and Rickettsia prowazekii. As can be seen, there is a great deal of sequence homology across the species, from human to the intracellular parasitic bacterium R. prowazekii. Each homologue contains the four motifs found in S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferases, as designated by the bars in Fig. 3.Figure 3Alignment of the predicted Coq3 amino acid sequences of the human, rat, A. thaliana, C. elegans, S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, C. albicans, E. coli, and R. prowazekii(GenBankTM accession numbers AF193016, L20427,Y15055, Z99281, P27680, AL023860, AL033391, P17993, and AJ235272, respectively).

The isolated human Coq3 cDNA was placed behind the constitutive yeast promotor CYC1 in single- and multicopy vectors. These constructs were each transformed into acoq3Δ strain (JM45Δcoq3). The transformants were tested for their ability to grow on liquid medium containing glycerol as the sole carbon source (Fig. 4). The data indicate that human Coq3, when expressed from a multicopy plasmid, can rescue the yeast coq3 mutant, albeit growth occurs at a slower rate than the yeast homologue. However, it cannot rescue growth on YPG when expressed from a single copy plasmid. Such rescue of a coq3Δ mutant has also been seen with the rat and Arabidopsis homologues (26.Marbois B.N. Hsu A. Pillai R. Colicelli J. Clarke C.F. Gene. 1994; 138: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 34.Avelange-Macherel M.-H. Joyard J. Plant J. 1998; 14: 203-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Together these results show that human Coq3 serves the same function as the yeast 3,4-dihydroxy-5-hexaprenylbenzoic acid methyltransferase. The ability of higher eukaryotic polypeptides to function in the synthesis of coenzyme Q in yeast is not uncommon. The human, rat, and C. elegans homologues of Coq7p are all able to restore Q biosynthesis in coq7 null mutants of S. cerevisiae(35.Vajo Z. King L.M. Jonassen T. Wilkin D.J. Ho N. Munnich A. Clarke C.F. Francomano C.A. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 1000-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 36.Jonassen T. Marbois B.N. Kim L. Chin A. Xia Y.-R. Lusis A.J. Clarke C.F. Arch. Biochem.

Science. 1997; 275: 980-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The actual Q levels produced in each of the strains were determined using a reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography system coupled to electrochemical detection. Strains grown on both glucose and glycerol are compared (Fig.5 A). Neither the strains harboring the single-copy human construct nor the delete control show any detectable Q. In contrast, yeast harboring human Coq3 on a multicopy-plasmid produce significant amounts of Q, although the levels are lower than those of the wild type yeast. When grown in glycerol, yeast containing the yeast COQ3 produce approximately 38 ng of Q per mg of dry weight, whereas yeast with the multicopy human plasmid make only about 7 ng of Q per mg of dry weight. In dextrose, the levels are about 26 and 9 ng of Q per mg for the yeast and human forms, respectively. In all cases, the Q that is produced is mostly in the reduced state, ranging from about 67 to 97% reduced Q (Fig. 5 B). Three substrate analogues were used to directly testO-methyltransferase activity, namely 3,4-dihydroxy-5-farnesylbenzoic acid (compound 1; Fig.6 A), demethyl-Q3(compound 3; Fig. 6 B), and 2-farnesyl-6-hydroxyphenol (compound 5; Fig. 6 C). Essentially no activity was detected with mitochondria isolated from yeast harboring the single copy human construct using any of the three substrates; however, mitochondrial extracts from the yeast bearing the multicopy human construct were capable of methylating all three substrates, albeit at lower levels than that of the yeast form. This activity is not detected in mitochondria from a coq3 null mutant. The human enzyme showed similar activities in methylating substrates 1 and 3, indicating that methylation occurs at sites both meta and para relative to the polyisoprenoid tail substituent. It is interesting to note that yeast Coq3p shows an approximately 30-fold higher activity with the substrate 3 compared with substrate 1, suggesting that the favored methylation site for the yeast enzyme is the hydroxyl group para to the polyisoprenoid tail. Both enzymes show a lower methylating activity with 5, the prokaryotic substrate. Compounds that are methylated ortho to the tail have not been observed (24.Hsu A.Y. Poon W.W. Shepherd J.A. Myles D.C. Clarke C.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9797-9806Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It is clear that the Coq3O-methyltransferase has a wide substrate specificity; theE. coli, yeast, rat, and human enzymes each methylate both eukaryotic substrates and the distinct prokaryotic substrate. The results presented here indicate that yeast provides an excellent model for characterizing Q biosynthesis in higher eukaryotes. This type of promiscuous substrate recognition and the ability to O-methylate at both meta andpara ring positions are features of COMT. COMT has numerous relevant physiological substrates, including catecholic steroids, the catecholamine neurotransmitters (dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine), and the biosynthetic precursors of dopamine (3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-l-alanine (l-DOPA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid) (38.Mannisto P.T. Ulmanen I. Lundstrom K. Taskinen J. Tenhunen J. Tilgmann C. Kaakkola S. Prog. Drug Res. 1992; 39: 291-350PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Vidgren J. Ovaska M. Tenhunen J. Tilgmann C. Lotta T. Mannisto P.T. Cheng X. Blumenthal R.M. S-Adenosylmethionine-dependent Methyltransferases; Structures and Functions. World Scientific Publishing, River Edge, NJ1999: 55-91Crossref Google Scholar). The determination of the structure of the rat COMT has allowed the amino acid residues making contacts with AdoMet, Mg2+, and the catechol substrate to be identified (40.Vidgren J. Svensson L.A. Liljas A. Nature. 1994; 368: 354-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). These residues are located within or are immediately adjacent to four conserved motifs found in a large family of AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases, including COMT, eukaryotic Coq3, and the E. coli UbiG polypeptides (Fig.7) (21.Kagan R.M. Clarke S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Based on the conservation of amino acids within these motifs and the similarity of the catechol-containing substrates, it seems likely that theO-methylation steps in Q biosynthesis may be similar to the mechanism described for COMT (41.Lotta T. Vidgren J. Tilgmann C. Ulmanen I. Melen K. Julkunen L. Taskinen J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4202-4210Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). The comparison of the amino acid sequences outside of these motifs fails to reveal other regions of homology. Dinitrocatechol-based inhibitors of COMT (such as tolcapone) are being used in combination with l-DOPA as a therapy for Parkinson's disease (42.Kaakkola S. Gordin A. Mannisto P.T. Gen. Pharmacol. 1994; 25: 813-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The rationale behind such therapy is that provision of l-DOPA replenishes stores of dopamine, whereas inhibition of COMT slows down the metabolism of both dopamine andl-DOPA. The extent to which these drugs might inhibit the human Coq3 O-methyltransferase (and the synthesis of Q) has not been investigated. This is a potentially important point because levels of Q are reported to be lower in blood platelets of Parkinson's disease patients (43.Shults C.W. Haas R.H. Passov D. Beal M.F. Ann. Neurol. 1997; 42: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), and supplementation with Q appears to have neuroprotective effects in mice treated with the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, an animal model of Parkinson's disease (44.Beal M.F. Matthews R.T. Tieleman A. Shults C.W. Brain Res. 1998; 783: 109-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Indeed, a clinical trial testing the therapeutic efficacy of Q supplementation in human Parkinson's disease patients is currently under way (45.Shults C.W. Haas R.H. Beal M.F. BioFactors. 1999; 9: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The extent to which the humanO-methyltransferase steps of Q biosynthesis are affected by drug therapies of Parkinson's disease warrants investigation. The ability to use a well defined yeast model system in these types of studies is very valuable and should enable the effects of potential drugs on the activity of human Coq3p to be assessed. In humans, Q10 deficiency has been documented in several individuals. Severe Q10 deficiencies (3–5% of normal) were noted in two sisters who displayed muscle weakness, fatigability, learning disabilities, decreased stature, and central nervous system dysfunction (46.Ogasahara S. Engel A.G. Frens D. Mack D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2379-2382Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). A young boy with muscle weakness, seizures, and elevated levels of lactate in the cerebrospinal fluid contained Q10 levels in muscle mitochondria that were 6% of normal (47.Boitier E. Degoul F. Desguerre I. Charpentier C. Francois D. Ponsot G. Diry M. Rustin P. Marsac C. J. Neurol. Sci. 1998; 156: 41-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A less severe Q10 deficiency (25% of normal) was described in an adult female with seizures, muscle weakness, and premature exertional fatigue (48.Sobreira C. Hirano M. Shanske S. Keller R.K. Haller R.G. Davidson E. Santorelli F.M. Miranda A.F. Bonilla E. Mojon D.S. Barreira A.A. King M.P. DiMauro S. Neurology. 1997; 48: 1238-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Such Q depletion was tissue-specific because normal levels of Q were observed in cultured fibroblasts or in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from the patients (46.Ogasahara S. Engel A.G. Frens D. Mack D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2379-2382Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 47.Boitier E. Degoul F. Desguerre I. Charpentier C. Francois D. Ponsot G. Diry M. Rustin P.

Dietary supplementation with Q10 produced significant improvement in physical performance of each of these patients (46.Ogasahara S. Engel A.G. Frens D. Mack D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2379-2382Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 47.Boitier E. Degoul F. Desguerre I. Charpentier C. Francois D. Ponsot G. Diry M. Rustin P. Marsac C. J. Neurol.

The studies of these Q-deficient human patients indicate that there may be tissue-specific expression of one or more Q biosynthetic enzymes. The human COQ3 homologue identified here and the other COQ human homologues identified so far (35.Vajo Z. King L.M. Jonassen T. Wilkin D.J. Ho N. Munnich A. Clarke C.F. Francomano C.A. Mamm.

Genomics. 1999; 58: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) are important candidate genes for studying human Q deficiencies. In studies of aging, there are thought to be two general classes of genes affecting longevity: those that affect repair processes and those that affect metabolism (50.Wood W.B. Cell. 1998; 95: 147-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It is intriguing that Q functionally bridges both categories, through its action as a crucial primary and secondary antioxidant and as an essential component in oxidative energy metabolism. OneCOQ gene has already been implicated in life span determination in the nematode C. elegans, namelyCOQ7/Clk-1 (37.Ewbank J.J. Barnes T.M. Lakowski B. Lussier M. Bussey H. Hekimi S. Science. 1997; 275: 980-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Specific mutations in the C. elegans clk-1 gene result in delayed embryonic and postembryonic development, a slowing of adult behaviors, increased resistance to UV- and heat-induced stress, and an extended life span (37.Ewbank J.J. Barnes T.M. Lakowski B. Lussier M. Bussey H. Hekimi S. Science. 1997; 275: 980-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 51.Murakami S. Johnson T.E.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1783-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). It seems likely that the mutations in clk-1 result in a change in Q levels and/or a relocation of Q within the cells (19.Jonassen T. Clarke C.F. Kagan V.E. Quinn P.J. Coenzyme Q: From Molecular Mechanisms to Nutrition and Health. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2000Google Scholar, 54.Jonassen T. Proft M. Randez-Gil F. Schultz J.R. Marbois B.N. Entian K.-D. Clarke C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3351-3357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The function of Clk-1/COQ7 in Q biosynthesis is conserved from yeast to humans (35.Vajo Z. King L.M. Jonassen T. Wilkin D.J. Ho N. Munnich A. Clarke C.F. Francomano C.A. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 1000-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The recent identification of a gene regulating both stress response and life span in mammals (p66 shc) supports the idea that genes affecting longevity function in pathways that are conserved across species (55.Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolfi P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1999; 402: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar). It will be very important to assess the potential role ofCOQ7, COQ3, and other COQ genes in the aging process. The studies presented here show that the yeast system can be exploited to answer fundamental questions concerning humanCOQ gene function. We thank P. T. Lee for constructing the plasmids pscQ3–1 and pmcQ3–1 and all of the members of the Clarke laboratory for their suggestions and support."

Although p48 remained in the nucleus after UV irradiation, a dynamic nuclear accumulation of p127 from the cytoplasm was found after 24 h.

XP3RO cells showed delayed but similar kinetics with less transport, whereas XP95TO cells appeared to have different kinetics, suggesting that these cells exhibit different defects in p127 translocation.

Chem. 2000; 275: 21422-21428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that DDB has a DNA repair function, possibly acting in damage recognition prior to nucleotide excision repair (NER). However, NER reconstitution studies in vitro using purified protein components exhibit no requirement for DDB (13.Aboussekha A. Biggerstaff M. Shivji M.K.K. Vilpo J.A. Moncollin V. Podust V.N.

Graham J.A. Liu W. Yamaizumi M. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21422-21428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Therefore the exact in vivo biological function(s) of DDB still remain unknown. cDNA sequence analysis indicates that the lack of DDB activity in XPE Ddb− cells is due to mutations in DDB2 (p48) in strains XP2RO, XP3RO, XP82TO, and GM03189 (12.Nichols A.F.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24317-24320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). No mutations in DDB1 (p127) have been found in XPE or any other cells. In an in vitro DDB activity assay, purified recombinant wild type p48 from insect cells was able to complement p127 to restore DDB activity to extracts from Ddb− cells (12.Nichols A.F. Itoh T. Graham J.A. Liu W. Yamaizumi M. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21422-21428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). DDB p127 has been shown to be in excess of p48 in unirradiated HeLa cells (17.Shiyanov P. Nag A. Raychaudhuri P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35309-35312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In normal diploid IMR-90 fibroblasts, the p48 mRNA copy number increases about 4-fold 38 h post-UV irradiation. A similar rise in p48 protein amount and DDB activity was also observed 48 h after irradiation (12.Nichols A.F. Itoh T. Graham J.A. Liu W. Yamaizumi M. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21422-21428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This change in DDB activity as a result of increased p48 protein is in agreement with the fact that there is excess p127 protein compared with p48 in uninduced cells. Fluorescence microscopy using fusions of p48 and enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) indicated that p48 is localized in the nucleus in wild type, XPE Ddb+, and Ddb− cells (12.Nichols A.F. Itoh T. Graham J.A. Liu W. Yamaizumi M. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21422-21428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). DDB p127 has been found to redistribute into a tight association with chromatin shortly after UV irradiation, causing a decrease of extractable DDB activity (18.Otrin V.R. McLenigan M. Takao M. Levine A.S. Protic M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1159-1168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have also observed the inhibition of DDB activity shortly after UV irradiation in our accompanying paper (12.Nichols A.F. Itoh T. Graham J.A. Liu W. Yamaizumi M. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21422-21428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined the effect of UV irradiation on the localizations of DDB subunits in both wild type and XPE cells as a function of time. The results of these experiments imply that p48 might act as the mediator of nuclear accumulation of p127. Human normal diploid lung fibroblast strain IMR-90 and two XPE fibroblast strains, XP3RO (Ddb−) and XP95TO (Ddb+), were cultured as described previously (4.Keeney S. Wein H. Linn S. Mutat. Res. 1992; 273: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 16.Nichols A.F. Ong P. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24317-24320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Partially purified HeLa DDB (40–100 units) was resolved by electrophoresis on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a Protran BA85 nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell). The filter was probed with a biotinylated lectin kit (Vector) according to the manufacturer's directions. Lectins used were peanut agglutinin (PNA),Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA), soybean agglutinin (SBA), Ulex europaeus agglutinin (UEA), concanavalin A (ConA), wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), and Ricinus communisagglutinin (RCA). The membranes were incubated with 5 μg of biotinylated lectin per ml of TBST buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) with gentle rocking at room temperature for 30 min. After three 15-min washes with TBST, the membranes were incubated for 30 min with 0.2 μl of avidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (diluted 1:5000) per ml of TBST buffer, followed by three 15-min TBST washes. The membranes were soaked for 1 min in NEN Renaissance chemiluminescent solution and then exposed to x-ray film (Kodak) for 15–60 s, after which the autoradiographs were scanned with a Umax Astra 2400S scanner. Mammalian expression vector pEGFP-N3, coding the mammalian codon-optimized, enhanced GFP, was obtained from CLONTECH. Full-length p127 cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction as two segments using native pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) with two sets of primers: 5′-GCTGGATCCGCCACCATGTCGTACAACTACGTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCTGATCTGCCGGAGCTCCTG-3′ (reverse) for cDNA nucleotides +1 to +1590, and 5′-ATCCATCCTCAGGAGCTCCGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGCCCTGGATCCATGGATTATAGTTAGCTC-3′ (reverse) for cDNA nucleotides +1560 to +3420, respectively. The two cDNA segments were digested with BamHI and SacI and cloned into pEGFP-N3 at the BamHI site by a three-way ligation at 4 °C overnight to form pEGFP-p127. The GFP protein was consequently expressed as a fusion to the C terminus of p127. Full-length p48 cDNA was amplified in the same way as that of p127 with a primer set 5′-ACAGGATCCGCCACCATGGCTCCCAAGAAACGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGTGGATCCCTTCCGTGTCCTGGCTTCC-3′ (reverse), corresponding to cDNA nucleotides −15 to +18 and +1263 to +1290, respectively, and cloned in at the BamHI site of pEGFP-N3 to form the pEGFP-p48 recombinant vector for the expression of the p48-pGFP fusion protein. Cell growth, transfection, UV irradiation, and fluorescence microscopy of IMR-90 and XPE cells were performed essentially as described in the accompanying paper (12.Nichols A.F. Itoh T. Graham J.A. Liu W. Yamaizumi M. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21422-21428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy was performed on a Zeiss 510 system. At each time point, 9 to 30 cells were randomly examined and photographed. Slides were coded, and the cellular localization was evaluated by seven independent scorers. Classifications included primarily cytoplasmic and weakly nuclear, equal distribution to both cytoplasmic and nuclear, primarily nuclear and weakly cytoplasmic, and strictly nuclear localization. The electrophoretic mobility shift DDB activity assay was performed essentially as described in the accompanying paper (12.Nichols A.F. Itoh T. Graham J.A. Liu W. Yamaizumi M. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21422-21428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In one approach to infer the cellular localization of the DDB subunits, HeLa DDB was probed with biotinylated lectins specific for various sugar modifications (Fig.1 and TableI). A sample of partially purified DDB (Fig. 1 C, lane 1) provided additional non-DDB protein bands in the sample to serve as positive controls for the lectins and to rule out potential nonspecific binding of the lectins. Because no signal was detected with the RCA and wheat germ agglutinin lectins with this fraction (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 and3), a less pure fraction (Fig. 1 C, lane 2) was also probed (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and4). Specific, non-DDB bands were detected in this fraction, demonstrating that the lectins were active but did not bind to either DDB p127 or p48. Interaction visualized with the other lectins (Fig.1 A) indicated that p48 contains α- and β-linkedN-acetylgalactosamine, α-linked fucose, and α-linked mannose, whereas p127 contains β-linkedN-acetylgalactosamine, α-linked fucose, and α-linked mannose. The glycosylation patterns are consistent with a nuclear or nuclear matrix localization (19.Hart G.W. Haltiwanger R.S. Holt G.D. Kelly W.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 841-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) and suggest that, when isolated as an active heterodimer, both DDB subunits have nuclear localizations. It also agrees with the initial discovery of DDB as a nuclear factor with specific affinity for UV-damaged DNA (2.Chu G. Chang E. Science. 1988; 242: 564-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectroscopy studies using a p48-pGFP fusion protein, as well as pSORT program prediction (20.Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar) (version 6.4), have also demonstrated that p48 is localized in the nucleus (12.Nichols A.F. Itoh T. Graham J.A. Liu W. Yamaizumi M. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21422-21428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, the pSORT program did not identify any potential nuclear localization signals on p127 and in fact predicted by a small marginal certainty that p127 would be localized in the cytoplasm.Table ILectin affinity assay of DDB subunitsLectinSugar specificityBinding site aCh&N, chromatin and nuclear matrix; Nm, nuclear membrane; Cy, cytoplasmic.Reactivityp48p127UEAα-Linked fucoseCh&N++SBAα- or β-linked N-acetylgalactosamine or galactose (weaker binding)Ch&N++PNAβ-LinkedN-acetylgalactosamineCh&N++ConAα-Linked mannoseNm, Ch&N, Cy++DBAα-LinkedN-acetylgalactosamineCh&N+−WGATerminalN-acetylglucosamine, sialic acidsNm, Ch&N, Cy−−RCAGalactoseNm, Ch&N, Cy−−Purified HeLa DDB was probed with biotinylated lectins as described in Fig. 1, and the immunoreactivity of p48 and p127 bands were scored as positive (+) or negative (−).

Sugar specificity and binding site preference data were from Hart et al. (20.Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). Because GFP protein alone does not show any preference for subcellular compartments, the fusion protein p127-pGFP can be used to study the localization of p127. Plasmids pEGFPN3 coding the GFP and pEGFP-p127 coding the p127-pGFP fusion protein were transfected into IMR-90 cells, and the localization of fluorescence signals was subsequently studied. In IMR-90 cells, GFP alone has a uniform whole cell distribution (Fig. 2 A), whereas p127-pGFP has a primarily cytoplasmic, but weakly nuclear localization (Fig. 2 B). Although previous studies reported that p127 is strictly localized to the cytoplasm of human osteoblastoma U2OS cells that have a low level of DDB (21.Shiyanov P. Hayes S.A. Donepudi M. Nichols A.F. Linn S. Slagle B.L. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4935-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), these data indicate that p127 is present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm in normal diploid fibroblasts. The GFP signal from the nucleus is not due to an overlaying signal from the cytoplasm because confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscopy essentially observed the same p127 localization pattern across different planes of the viewing field (Fig. 2 C). The primarily cytoplasmic localization of p127 has also been demonstrated by the immunostaining of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of mouse PC-12 cells, as well as by immunofluorescence of p127 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (22.Watanabe T. Sukegawa J. Sukegawa I. Tomita S. Iijima K. Oguchi S. Suzuki N.A.C. Greengard P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Occasionally we observed p127-pGFP signals as a uniform whole cell distribution in a small fraction of cells (Fig.3 A). This observation could be due to the weaker expression of p127-pGFP in these particular cells.Figure 3Nuclear accumulation of DDB p127 after UV irradiation. Experimental conditions are the same as those of Fig.2. Localization of p127 is categorized as primarily cytoplasmic and weakly nuclear (open bar), equal distribution to both cytoplasmic and nuclear (hatched bar), primarily nuclear and weakly cytoplasmic (striped bar), and strictly nuclear localization (solid bar). At each time point, 9 to 30 cells were randomly examined and photographed. The pattern in each category is represented as a percentage of total cells examined.

The localization of fluorescence was then examined 24, 48, and 72 h post-UV irradiation (Fig. 3 A). As expected, GFP protein alone had a uniform whole cell distribution, and UV irradiation had no effect on this pattern. Moreover, the p48 nuclear localization was unchanged by UV irradiation at all time points examined (data not shown). On the other hand, a dynamic nuclear transportation of p127 was observed after UV irradiation. Before irradiation, p127-pGFP fluorescence was primarily cytoplasmic, with some cells (22% of all cells examined) showing a uniform distribution. However, 24 h after irradiation, the p127 localization pattern was reversed: 41% of the cells examined displayed primarily nuclear but weak cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 2 D) whereas 14% of the cells showed strictly nuclear localization (Fig. 2 E), and the rest (45%) exhibited a uniform distribution of p127-pGFP. Forty-eight h after UV irradiation, 70% of the cells had either primarily or strictly nuclear localization of p127-pGFP, with only 30% of the cells showing uniform distribution, and no primarily cytoplasmic localization of p127-pGFP was found. Seventy-two h after irradiation, all of the cells examined exhibited either primarily or strictly nuclear localization of p127-pGFP. The result of p127 subcellular translocation upon UV irradiation of normal IMR-90 fibroblasts is summarized in Fig.3 A. Interestingly, the occurrence of the translocation process correlated with the time course of increased p48 mRNA copy number, p48 protein amount, and DDB activity after UV irradiation described in the accompanying paper (12.Nichols A.F. Itoh T. Graham J.A. Liu W. Yamaizumi M. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21422-21428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The cellular localization of each DDB subunit in Ddb+ XP95TO and Ddb− XP3RO strains was also examined. Cells were transiently transfected with either control vector pEGFPN3 or the pEGFP-p48 or pEGFP-p127 recombinant constructs and then irradiated with 254 nm UV light at 10 J/m2. In both strains, GFP protein alone had a uniform distribution and p48 had a strictly nuclear localization, and as in normal IMR-90 cells, UV irradiation did not change these localization patterns (data not shown). We also observed that p127 had a primarily cytoplasmic and weak nuclear localization in the XPE cells, and as we had observed in IMR-90 cells, there were also a small number of cells (Fig. 3, Band C) that showed a uniform distribution of p127-pGFP in both strains, which again could be due to weaker expression of the fusion protein in these particular cells. A nuclear accumulation of DDB p127 after UV irradiation was also observed in the XPE cells, but XP95TO and XP3RO had different kinetics of p127 nuclear transportation, and the transportation process was compromised in both strains as compared with that in IMR-90 cells (Fig.3). For the XP95TO Ddb+ strain, cells exhibiting either primarily or strictly nuclear localization of p127 increased steadily from 11% of all cells examined after 24 h to 30% after 48 h to 75% after 72 h. But for the XP3RO Ddb− strain, it increased from 30% after 24 h, peaked at 50% after 48 h, and dropped to 36% after 72 h. These results suggest that there could be different defects in the nuclear transportation of DDB p127 in these two XPE strains. Because XP95TO cells have normal DDB activity, we also examined the induction of DDB activity after UV irradiation by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) (12.Nichols A.F. Itoh T. Graham J.A. Liu W. Yamaizumi M. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21422-21428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Compared with IMR-90 cells, the XP95TO cells showed a similar induction pattern of DDB activity after irradiation but possibly to a slightly lower extent (Fig.4). Watanabeet al. (22.Watanabe T. Sukegawa J. Sukegawa I. Tomita S. Iijima K. Oguchi S. Suzuki N.A.C. Greengard P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) demonstrated that DDB p127 can bind tightly to the cytoplasmic domain of the Alzheimer's amyloid precursor protein (APPC) as judged by affinity co-purification studies: glutathione S-transferase-50 amino acid APPCfusion peptide bound to DDB p127 from the cytoplasmic fraction of rat PC-12 cells. Such binding not only confirmed the cytosolic localization of DDB p127 but also suggested that APPC might act to anchor p127 at the cytosolic side of the membrane. However, our confocal laser scanning fluorescence studies did not reveal a typical “ring” or “rim” pattern signal for membrane localization of p127-pGFP (Fig. 2 C). Therefore, the p127-APPCinteraction would not appear to reflect an anchoring function, although it might have other yet unidentified functions for p127 or APPC action. However, it is feasible that most of the APPC is complexed with endogenous nonfluorescent p127 and that there is not additional APPC available to bind a majority of the overexpressed p127-pGFP. Consequently, a rim pattern would not be observed. DDB has a strong affinity for binding various DNA damages (1.Feldberg R.S.

Toxicol. 1989; 2: 255-270PubMed Google Scholar), and shortly after UV treatment, p127 has been reported to redistribute into a tight association with chromatin in mammalian cells (18.Otrin V.R. McLenigan M. Takao M. Levine A.S. Protic M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1159-1168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such tight association with chromatin, which also occurs for nucleotide excision repair (NER) proteins such as RP-A and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, has been attributed to the binding specificity of DDB for damaged DNA and its possible role in damaged DNA recognition during initial steps of NER. In the present work we have demonstrated that the nuclear enrichment of DDB p127 occurs at times subsequent to DNA repair whereas p48 was observed to have a strict nuclear localization that was not affected by UV irradiation. These observations suggest possible roles for DDB protein and/or its individual subunits in addition to recognizing damaged DNA. Human DDB can be purified from HeLa cells as a heterodimer of p48 and p127 subunits (5.Keeney S. Chang G.J. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21293-21380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is a molar excess of p127 over p48 in unirradiated HeLa cells (17.Shiyanov P. Nag A. Raychaudhuri P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35309-35312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Previous experiments also indicated that the constitutive DDB activity in primate cells was induced to higher levels in UV-irradiated primate cells (8.Hirschfeld S. Levine A.S. Ozato K. Protic M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2041-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The increase in DDB activity was then demonstrated to be due to an elevation in the amount of p48 protein because both subunits are needed for the binding to damaged DNA (12.Nichols A.F. Itoh T. Graham J.A. Liu W. Yamaizumi M. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21422-21428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In log-phase normal diploid fibroblast IMR-90 cells, UV irradiation at 12 J/m2 caused a roughly 4-fold increase of DDB p48 mRNA level at 38 h after UV irradiation, followed by a similar rise in p48 protein amount and DDB activity after 48 h (12.Nichols A.F. Itoh T. Graham J.A. Liu W. Yamaizumi M. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21422-21428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This time course correlates with the dynamic nuclear translocation of p127 upon UV irradiation; while the majority of p127 is located in the cytoplasm in undamaged cells, the nuclear accumulation of p127 peaks between 24 and 48 h after UV irradiation. Such a correlation suggests that DDB p48 may also function as the transporter for p127 nuclear localization. This proposal agrees with observations of Shiyanov et al. (21.Shiyanov P. Hayes S.A. Donepudi M. Nichols A.F. Linn S. Slagle B.L. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4935-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) that in human osteoblastoma U2OS cells that have very low constitutive levels of DDB transient overexpression of p48 caused increased nuclear accumulation of p127 (21.Shiyanov P. Hayes S.A. Donepudi M. Nichols A.F. Linn S. Slagle B.L. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4935-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It also provides an explanation of their observation that DDB p127 was localized only to the cytoplasm in U2OS cells, because the low DDB level in those cells could be due to a small amount or a lack of DDB p48 protein or the presence of a mutant form of p48 that is inefficient or incapable of transporting p127. In normal diploid IMR-90 cells, however, the constitutively expressed level of p48 would be capable of escorting a significant fraction of the available p127 to the nucleus. In unirradiated XP95TO and XP3RO cells, DDB p127 also presents a primarily cytosolic but weakly nuclear localization pattern as seen in IMR-90 cells. In XP95TO Ddb+ cells, this pattern is consistent with the presence of the wild type p48 (12.Nichols A.F. Itoh T. Graham J.A. Liu W. Yamaizumi M. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21422-21428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) that is capable of transporting p127 into the nucleus. In XP3RO Ddb− cells, we expect that the roughly normal level of nuclear localization of p127 before irradiation could be due to the weak interaction of mutant p48 with p127, which was not stable enough for in vitro DDB activity assays (12.Nichols A.F. Itoh T. Graham J.A. Liu W. Yamaizumi M. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21422-21428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) orin vitro immunoaffinity purifications (21.Shiyanov P. Hayes S.A. Donepudi M. Nichols A.F. Linn S. Slagle B.L. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4935-4943Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) but is sufficient for escorting the nuclear entry of p127. This weaker interaction might also account for the fewer number of cells having a uniform distribution of p127 in XP3RO (13% of total cells examined) compared with those of XP95TO (17%) or IMR-90 (23%) cells. While the in vitro activity assay showed that DDB activity was also induced in irradiated XP95TO cells as in IMR-90 cells (Fig.4), the nuclear accumulation of p127 in XP95TO cells had different kinetics from that in IMR-90 cells: instead of reaching a plateau between 24 and 48 h after irradiation, the fraction of cells that showed either primarily or strictly nuclear localization of p127 increased steadily over time. These observations could suggest that, although p48 is normal in these cells, a possible third factor that is required for the efficient nuclear entry of p127 is defective. XP3RO cells, on the other hand, had similar but delayed kinetics of p127 nuclear accumulation compared with IMR-90 cells: the fraction of cells that displayed either primarily or strictly nuclear localization of p127 plateaued at 48 h after irradiation, although to a lower extent (50%) as compared with IMR-90 cells (70%). This delayed and inefficient nuclear entry of p127 in XP3RO could again be attributed to the mutation in the p48 subunit. Therefore, these data suggest that there may be different mutations that account for the inefficient nuclear accumulation of p127 after UV irradiation in Ddb+ versus Ddb− XPE strains. DDB p48 has been shown to interact with the transcription factor E2F1, and such interaction can overcome the retinoblastoma protein (Rb)-mediated inhibition of E2F1-activated transcription (23.Hayes S. Shiyanov P. Chen X. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 240-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The association of p48 with CUL-4A (17.Shiyanov P. Nag A. Raychaudhuri P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35309-35312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) suggests an additional role in cell cycle regulation by DDB because the cullin family of proteins is believed to regulate the cell cycle by destroying cell cycle regulators via ubiquitination (24.Kipreos E.T.

Virol. 1995; 69: 1107-1114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The up-regulation of only p48 expression after UV irradiation correlates with the fact that there is a molar excess of p127 compared with p48 in the cell. This excess of p127 found mainly in the cytoplasm as we have shown herein might have other yet unidentified distinct cytoplasmic functions. Such functions could, for example, possibly act in conjunction with the amyloid precursor protein (APPC), although we have been unable to confirm a docking function of APPC for DDB p127. We have used a yeast two-hybrid system to identify other candidates for human proteins that interact with DDB p127. Preliminary studies isolated positive clones that encode segments of four different proteins: the BRCA1-associated protein 2, BRAP2 (26.Li S. Ku C.-Y. Farmer A.A. Cong Y.-S. Chen C.-F. Lee W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6183-6189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar); a human homolog of the 26-kDa Xenopus RP-A interacting protein, XRIPα (27.Jullien D. Gorlich D. Laemmli U.K. Adachi Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4348-4358Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); EBNA2 protein of the human Epstein-Barr virus (28.Sample J. Hummel M. Braun D. Birkenbach M. Kieff E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5096-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar); and subunit 3 of the COP9 signal transduction complex, Sgn3 (29.Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K.

The C-terminal portion of BRAP2, which interacts with DDB p127 in the screen, has typical leucine heptad repeats for protein-protein interaction. BRAP2 is mainly cytoplasmic and binds to nuclear localization signal motifs in BRCA1, SV40 large T antigen, and mitosin. Because BRAP2 does not cycle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, it has been proposed to be a cytoplasmic retention protein that plays a role in regulating nuclear transport of its interacting proteins (26.Li S. Ku C.-Y. Farmer A.A. Cong Y.-S. Chen C.-F. Lee W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6183-6189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Therefore, DDB p127 could possibly be retained in the cytoplasm by BRAP2 until the up-regulation of p48. The association of DDB with chromatin and RP-A shortly after UV irradiation (18.Otrin V.R. McLenigan M. Takao M. Levine A.S. Protic M. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1159-1168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) presumably reflects its role in recognizing damaged DNA. The human homolog of the Xenopus RP-A interacting protein that we identified in the screen might be involved in this association through its interaction with DDB p127 and RP-A. However, the delayed response to UV irradiation of up-regulating p48 expression and the nuclear accumulation of p127 indicate additional functions of newly transported DDB protein. Such functions could be the regulation of transcription and the cell cycle. In addition to the EBNA2 protein of the human Epstein-Barr virus, DDB p127 has been shown to interact with a variety of other viral transcription proteins, such as the X protein of the human hepatitis B virus (30.Mathias N. Johnson S.J. Winey M. Adams A.E.M. Goetsch L. Pringle J.R. Byers B. Goebl M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6634-6643Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), the V protein of the simian paramyxovirus SV5, the mumps virus, the human parainfluenza virus 2, and the measles virus (31.Lin G.Y. Paterson R.G. Richardson C.D. Lamb R.A. Virology. 1998; 249: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Furthermore, p127 has been reported to be structurally and immunologically highly related to the human lipoprotein B gene regulatory factor-2 (BRF-2) (32.Krishnamoorthy R.R. Lee T.-H. Butel J.S. Das H.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 960-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The possible interaction of DDB p127 with subunit 3 of the COP9 signal transduction complex, which is involved in cell cycle regulation, again suggests an additional role for DDB. Therefore, DDB may, in conjunction with other proteins, regulate cellular transcription process and control cell cycle progression after sensing extensive DNA damage.

However, while MCL1 phosphorylation induced by the protein kinase C activator, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), did not affect its electrophoretic mobility, microtubule-damaging agents, such as taxol, induced MCL1 phosphorylation associated with a band shift to decreased mobility.

The role of this post-translational modification has been well defined for the proapoptotic family member, BAD, where phosphorylation promotes association with a 14-3-3 protein instead of BCLX, thereby freeing BCLX to exert its antiapoptotic activity (1.Gajewski T.F.

BCL2 phosphorylation is induced by several types of agents. These include growth factors and protein kinase C activators, such as erythropoietin, interleukin-3, and bryostatin-1 (7.May W.S.

Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). BCL2 phosphorylation has been associated with viability promotion in some cases and with cell death in others (8.Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 18.Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). These varying results could relate to the fact that BCL2 phosphorylation has been studied by several investigators using different agents in varied cell lines.Our studies focus on myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1),1 an antiapoptotic BCL2 family member identified by its rapid up-regulation during 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced differentiation of myeloid ML-1 cells (19.Kozopas K.M. Yang T. Buchan H.L. Zhou P. Craig R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3516-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Previous studies on MCL1 regulation indicated that TPA increases MCL1 expression within 3 h through an extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)-dependent signal transduction pathway, which activates a serum response factor-Elk-1 transcription factor complex (20.Townsend K.J. Trusty J.L. Traupman M.A. Eastman A. Craig R.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 21.Townsend K.J. Zhou P. Qian L. Bieszczad C.K. Lowrey C.H. Yen A. Craig R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1802-1813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Microtubule-disrupting agents such as nocodazole and vinblastine similarly increase ERK activation and MCL1 expression within 3 h, as does okadaic acid (20.Townsend K.J. Trusty J.L. Traupman M.A. Eastman A. Craig R.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 22.Yang T. Buchan H.L. Townsend K.J. Craig R.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). MCL1 may also be regulated at the level of mRNA and protein turnover, since both can be rapidly degraded (t 12 = 1–3 h) (22.Yang T. Buchan H.L. Townsend K.J. Craig R.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 23.Yang T. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar).In the work described here, we investigated whether MCL1 is phosphorylated, as are BCL2 and BCLX. We approached this question by using various agents that induce BCL2 phosphorylation and testing for a similar effect on MCL1. We first tested for MCL1 phosphorylation in the presence of TPA as an activator of protein kinase C and ERK (20.Townsend K.J. Trusty J.L. Traupman M.A. Eastman A. Craig R.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We then examined the effects of microtubule damaging agents and protein phosphatase 1/2A inhibitors. Our results show that, along with rapid ERK activation, TPA stimulates MCL1 phosphorylation without changing its electrophoretic mobility. In contrast, microtubule-damaging agents that produce a G2/M cell cycle arrest (e.g.taxol) and protein phosphatase 1/2A inhibitors (e.g. okadaic acid) induce ERK-independent MCL1 phosphorylation associated with a band shift to reduced electrophoretic mobility. Thus, the viability-promoting BCL2 family member, MCL1, can undergo two distinct types of phosphorylation; one is associated with ERK activation and does not change its electrophoretic mobility, while the other results in an ERK-independent MCL1 band shift and is induced by G2/M events or protein phosphatase 1/2A inhibitors.DISCUSSIONStudies of the BCL2 family member BAD have uniformly demonstrated inhibition of proapoptotic activity upon phosphorylation (1.Gajewski T.F.

Biol. 2000; 20: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). However, studies of BCL2 and BCLX have not yielded unequivocal results upon examination of different phosphorylation-stimulating agents in different systems. The studies reported here examined the phosphorylation of MCL1, a viability-promoting member of the BCL2 family that is similar to BCL2 and BCLX (but not BCLW or A1) in that it contains an upstream loop region in addition to the BCL2 homology domains (44.Craig R.W. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 45.Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.L.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 968-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In our experiments, we used a cell line that endogenously expresses abundant MCL1 and tested the effects of a variety of agents known to influence BCL2 phosphorylation. Our results revealed differences in MCL1 phosphorylation as induced by various types of agents. TPA stimulated MCL1 phosphorylation without changing its electrophoretic mobility, while microtubule-damaging agents, such as taxol, produced an MCL1 band shift that represented phosphorylation. Various signaling pathways appeared to be involved in the differing manifestations of MCL1 phosphorylation, since the TPA-induced phosphorylation was associated with ERK activation, while the phosphorylation/band shift seen with taxol was associated with G2/M accumulation. In summary, MCL1 appeared to be subject to at least two distinct types of phosphorylation stimulated through different pathways, one associated with ERK activation and no MCL1 band shift and the other associated with events in G2/M and an MCL1 band shift.Both TPA-induced ERK activation and MCL1 phosphorylation without a band shift occurred with similar rapid time courses and similar dose-response kinetics. MEK inhibitors blocked the ERK activation as expected (20.Townsend K.J. Trusty J.L. Traupman M.A. Eastman A. Craig R.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 32.Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

Immunol. 1998; 160: 4175-4181PubMed Google Scholar) and also inhibited the increase in MCL1 phosphorylation. Thus, the effect of TPA on ERK activation correlated with its effect on MCL1 phosphorylation. However, the present studies did not address the question of whether ERK activation has a causative role in MCL1 phosphorylation. For example, while ERK is a highly specific target for MEK (29.Force T. Bonventre J.V. Hypertension. 2000; 31: 152-161Crossref Google Scholar, 30.Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar, 31.Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we cannot rule out the possibility that MEK itself induces MCL1 phosphorylation or that another as yet uncharacterized MEK-induced pathway plays a role. If ERK is involved, further work will be required to determine whether ERK directly phosphorylates MCL1, as recently reported for BCL2 Ser70(51.Deng X. Ruvolo P. Carr B. May W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1578-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), or whether it regulates additional kinases/phosphorylation cascades that lead to MCL1 phosphorylation. Finally, activation of the ERK pathway has not only been linked to phosphorylation, as shown here, but has also previously been shown in MCL1-inducible ML-1 cells to influence the levels of MCL1 mRNA and protein (20.Townsend K.J. Trusty J.L. Traupman M.A. Eastman A. Craig R.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 22.Yang T. Buchan H.L. Townsend K.J. Craig R.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 23.Yang T. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanisms by which ERK affects MCL1 remain to be determined, these observations suggest that the ERK pathway may influence MCL1 at multiple levels.The MCL1 phosphorylation/band shift induced by microtubule-damaging agents occurred with an extended time course in association with G2/M arrest and was blocked when cells were prevented from entering G2/M with aphidicolin. ERK was not involved, since taxol and nocodazole did not activate this pathway in BL41-3 cells (although nocodazole caused rapid ERK activation in ML-1 cells) (20.Townsend K.J. Trusty J.L. Traupman M.A. Eastman A. Craig R.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and the band shift induced by these agents was not blocked by U0126 or PD98059, similar to a recent report on the BCL2 band shift (52.Huang Y. Sheikh M.S. Fornace A.J. Holbrook N.J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3431-3439Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). An MCL1 band shift was also seen in populations enriched for cells in G2/M by cell sorting or cell synchronization. Taken together, our results suggest that the MCL1 phosphorylation/band shift occurs in cycling cells at a point in late G2/M and that increasing the number of cells at this point results in an increase in the shifted MCL1 band. In other words, events in late G2/M, rather than ERK activation, appear to underlie the effects of the microtubule-damaging agents on the MCL1 phosphorylation/band shift.Okadaic acid, like the microtubule-damaging agents, induced an MCL1 band shift. However, the band shift induced by okadaic acid occurred more rapidly than that induced by microtubule-damaging agents and was not dependent on cells accumulating in G2/M. We speculate that okadaic acid might induce the MCL1 band shift by activating the pathway that produces the band shift without requiring G2/M accumulation, by activating other pathways, or by inhibiting the dephosphorylation of MCL1. This may relate to the observation that, with okadaic acid, both bands of the MCL1 doublet shift, while with taxol, primarily one shifted band was detected. The rapid action of okadaic acid may have stimulated a shift of both MCL1 bands, while the gradual accumulation of cells in G2/M with taxol allowed the occurrence of other events that differentially affected the two bands of the doublet (e.g. differential formation or degradation of the bands).The present results on MCL1 phosphorylation invite a comparison with previous findings on the various agents that increase MCL1 expression in cell lines where the gene is inducible. As discussed above, stimulation of the ERK pathway appears to be linked to both MCL1 expression and the phosphorylation without band shift. Some microtubule-damaging agents can also affect both MCL1 expression and the phosphorylation with band shift, although these occur through different mechanisms; MCL1 expression is rapidly increased by microtubule-disrupting but not microtubule-stabilizing agents, while the phosphorylation/band shift is produced by both types of agents. The increase in MCL1 expression is associated with ERK activation and occurs rapidly (20.Townsend K.J. Trusty J.L. Traupman M.A. Eastman A. Craig R.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), while the phosphorylation/band shift is instead associated with the eventual accumulation of cells in G2/M. This difference in timing is readily apparent upon application of microtubule-disrupting agents to ML-1 cells, where the increase in MCL1 protein levels occurs well before the band shift. In summary, ERK activation is associated with the stimulation of MCL1 expression and phosphorylation without a band shift, while events in G2/M underlie the ERK-independent MCL1 phosphorylation/band shift. The parallels between agents that induce MCL1 phosphorylation and those previously found to increase MCL1 levels suggest a coordination between MCL1 protein expression and its phosphorylation.It remains to be determined how these findings with MCL1 relate to previous observations with BCL2. Interestingly, MCL1 phosphorylation induced by TPA is reminiscent of that seen with BCL2 in the presence of growth factors and protein kinase C activators, while the MCL1 phosphorylation/band shift seen with microtubule-damaging agents mirrors that seen with these agents in the case of BCL2. BCL2 undergoes phosphorylation at Ser70 with both growth factors and microtubule-damaging agents, and recent findings show that microtubule-damaging agents induce the phosphorylation of additional residues (e.g. BCL2 Ser87 and Thr69) (8.Ito T.

Oncol. 1998; 13: 659-664PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it may be that certain agents stimulate phosphorylation at BCL2 Ser70 alone, while others also stimulate phosphorylation at additional sites. Differing patterns of BCL2 phosphorylation might then translate into differences in terms of BCL2 function, which might account for the fact that phosphorylation has been associated with either viability promotion or cell death (8.Ito T.

We do not know whether the two types of MCL1 phosphorylation observed here differ in their effects, although the phosphorylation without band shift induced by TPA was associated with the maintenance of cell viability, while the phosphorylation/band shift induced by taxol was followed by cell death. Our future work is aimed at addressing this question by further characterizing MCL1 phosphorylation, starting with the identification of the sites involved with the different types of agents. Thus, just as the proapoptotic family member, BAD, is phosphorylated by various kinases, the same may be true for antiapoptotic family members such as MCL1, where the present studies have shown that MCL1 is phosphorylated through two distinct pathways. Both anti- and proapoptotic BCL2 family members undergo phosphorylation, as is seen with BCL2, BCLX, and BAD. The role of this post-translational modification has been well defined for the proapoptotic family member, BAD, where phosphorylation promotes association with a 14-3-3 protein instead of BCLX, thereby freeing BCLX to exert its antiapoptotic activity (1.Gajewski T.F.

BCL2 phosphorylation is induced by several types of agents. These include growth factors and protein kinase C activators, such as erythropoietin, interleukin-3, and bryostatin-1 (7.May W.S.

BCL2 phosphorylation has been associated with viability promotion in some cases and with cell death in others (8.Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11671-11673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 18.Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). These varying results could relate to the fact that BCL2 phosphorylation has been studied by several investigators using different agents in varied cell lines. Our studies focus on myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1),1 an antiapoptotic BCL2 family member identified by its rapid up-regulation during 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced differentiation of myeloid ML-1 cells (19.Kozopas K.M. Yang T. Buchan H.L. Zhou P. Craig R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3516-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Previous studies on MCL1 regulation indicated that TPA increases MCL1 expression within 3 h through an extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)-dependent signal transduction pathway, which activates a serum response factor-Elk-1 transcription factor complex (20.Townsend K.J. Trusty J.L. Traupman M.A. Eastman A. Craig R.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 21.Townsend K.J. Zhou P. Qian L. Bieszczad C.K. Lowrey C.H. Yen A. Craig R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1802-1813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Microtubule-disrupting agents such as nocodazole and vinblastine similarly increase ERK activation and MCL1 expression within 3 h, as does okadaic acid (20.Townsend K.J. Trusty J.L. Traupman M.A. Eastman A. Craig R.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 22.Yang T. Buchan H.L. Townsend K.J. Craig R.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). MCL1 may also be regulated at the level of mRNA and protein turnover, since both can be rapidly degraded (t 12 = 1–3 h) (22.Yang T. Buchan H.L. Townsend K.J. Craig R.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 523-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 23.Yang T. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In the work described here, we investigated whether MCL1 is phosphorylated, as are BCL2 and BCLX. We approached this question by using various agents that induce BCL2 phosphorylation and testing for a similar effect on MCL1. We first tested for MCL1 phosphorylation in the presence of TPA as an activator of protein kinase C and ERK (20.Townsend K.J. Trusty J.L. Traupman M.A. Eastman A. Craig R.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We then examined the effects of microtubule damaging agents and protein phosphatase 1/2A inhibitors. Our results show that, along with rapid ERK activation, TPA stimulates MCL1 phosphorylation without changing its electrophoretic mobility. In contrast, microtubule-damaging agents that produce a G2/M cell cycle arrest (e.g.taxol) and protein phosphatase 1/2A inhibitors (e.g. okadaic acid) induce ERK-independent MCL1 phosphorylation associated with a band shift to reduced electrophoretic mobility. Thus, the viability-promoting BCL2 family member, MCL1, can undergo two distinct types of phosphorylation; one is associated with ERK activation and does not change its electrophoretic mobility, while the other results in an ERK-independent MCL1 band shift and is induced by G2/M events or protein phosphatase 1/2A inhibitors. DISCUSSIONStudies of the BCL2 family member BAD have uniformly demonstrated inhibition of proapoptotic activity upon phosphorylation (1.Gajewski T.F. Thompson C.B.

Protein kinase C (PKC)ζ, an atypical PKC isoform mainly expressed in rat heart, has been shown to act as an upstream kinase of MAPK during ischemic hypoxia and reoxygenation by analyses with PKC inhibitors, antisense DNA, a dominant negative kinase defective mutant, and constitutively active mutants of PKCζ. Immunocytochemical observations show PKCζ staining in the nucleus during ischemic hypoxia and reoxygenation when phosphorylated MAPK is also detected in the nucleus. This nuclear localization of PKCζ is inhibited by treatment with wortmannin, a phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor that also inhibits MAPK activation in a dose-dependent manner. This is supported by the inhibition of MAPK phosphorylation by another blocker of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, LY294002. An upstream kinase of MAPK, MEK1/2, is significantly phosphorylated 15 min after reoxygenation and observed mainly in the nucleus, whereas it is present in the cytoplasm in serum stimulation. The phosphorylation of MEK is blocked by PKC inhibitors and phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors, as observed in the case of MAPK phosphorylation.

In the heart, prolonged ischemia causes necrosis and contractile dysfunction, but the heart can recover from injury following brief ischemia. Many genes are expressed in the heart during recovery from ischemia. In particular, the expression of immediate early genes (e.g. c-fos, c-jun, and Egr-1) is rapidly up-regulated during post-ischemic reperfusion (1.Brand T. Sharma H.S. Fleischmann K.E. Duncker D.J.

Among transcription factors, the induction of c-fos is regulated by a serum response element in the promoter. Transcription factors p67SRF and p62TCF bind to the serum response element, the activity of which is regulated by the phosphorylation of p62TCF by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1 (5.Gille H.

MAPK is a serine/threonine protein kinase whose activity is up-regulated by MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinases (MEKs)-catalyzed phosphorylation on tyrosine and threonine residues (6.Crews C.

Furthermore, cycles of brief ischemia and reperfusion (designated preconditioning) protect the myocardium against infarction caused by subsequent sustained ischemia.

In preceding studies, we demonstrated that PKCα, δ, ε, and ζ isoforms translocate to distinct fractions during ischemia (29.Yoshida K. Hirata T. Akita Y. Mizukami Y. Yamaguchi K. Sorimachi Y.

In particularly, PKCζ, which is expressed mainly in rat heart, translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during ischemia (30.Mizukami Y. Hirata T. Yoshida K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, the nuclear proteins nucleolin and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein are PKCζ substrates, suggesting that PKCζ may play a role in nuclear signal transmission (32.Municio M.M.

However, the role of PKCζ in the ischemic heart is presently unknown.We have demonstrated that ischemia induces the nuclear translocation of MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1, both of which are activated during post-ischemic reperfusion, suggesting that a MAPK activation pathway may be present in nuclei in ischemic heart (4.Mizukami Y.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, the upstream pathway for MAPK activation during ischemia and reperfusion remain unknown. The present study uses an ischemia and reperfusion cell model to examine the upstream kinases of MAPK activation. The results obtained here indicate that during reoxygenation after ischemic hypoxia, an atypical PKC, PKCζ, that is activated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) participates in the activation of MAPK through MEK in the nucleus.DISCUSSIONp42MAPK was preferentially activated during reoxygenation after ischemic hypoxia as compared with p44MAPK, implying that the activating pathway of MAPK may be different than that induced by serum or PMA stimulation since both p42MAPK and p44MAPK are activated by treatment with serum and PMA. The inhibition of PKCζ expression and the activity significantly suppresses the phosphorylation of MAPK during reoxygenation, demonstrating that PKCζ is involved in MAPK activation. In cells expressing the CA mutant of PKCζ, MAPK phosphorylation was undetectable in unstimulated cells. The activation of MAPK may require that PKCζ translocates from the cytosol to other organelle where the MAPK pathway is present during ischemic hypoxia. This activation pathway might exist in the nucleus based on the following reasons. First, during ischemic hypoxia and reoxygenation, PKCζ localizes mainly in the nucleus where phosphorylated MAPK is also detected. Second, the nuclear localization of PKCζ is blocked during ischemic hypoxia and reoxygenation in wortmannin-treated cells. Consistent with the localization of PKCζ in the cytoplasm, the phosphorylation of MAPK during reoxygenation is also suppressed by wortmannin. We also observed the nuclear translocation of MEK, an upstream kinase for MAPK, during ischemic hypoxia, 2Y. Mizukami, K. Mogami, N. Todoroki-Ikeda, and S. Kobayashi, unpublished observations. and reoxygenation for 15 min after ischemic hypoxia led to phosphorylation of MEK only in the nucleus although the active form of MEK remained in the cytoplasm for 15 min after serum stimulation. The phosphorylation of MEK during reoxygenation was blocked by PKC inhibitors and PI3K inhibitors as shown in this study. These observations indicate that nuclear PKCζ activates the MEK/MAPK pathway. It was initially thought that MEK is always localized in the cytoplasm, but Tolwinski et al.recently demonstrated that MEK also translocates to the nucleus in mammalian cells in a regulatable manner during mitosis (45.Tolwinski N.S. Shapiro P.S. Goueli S. Ahn N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6168-6174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). How does MEK uptake into the nucleus during ischemic hypoxia occur? One possibility is that a decrease in intracellular ATP by depletion of molecular oxygen and glucose during ischemic hypoxia may lead to the nuclear accumulation of MEK by inhibiting nuclear export via a nuclear export signal that is known to be dependent on intracellular ATP (46.Wen W.

Consistent with this idea, the inhibitions of the PKCζ/MAPK pathway induces apoptoic cell death during reoxygenation.3Cardiomyocyte-specific proteins and functions were conserved in the H9c2 cells used in this study, and the pathway of apoptotic inhibition might also be observed in a primary cardiac cell system. In cardiac myocytes that have lost their mitogenic activity, the preservation of cell viability by inhibition of apoptotic cell death may be critical for the maintenance of normal cardiac function. Further investigations are required to elucidate the role of the PKCζ/MAPK pathway in pathogenic processes. Various pathways in mammalian cells are induced in response to ischemia and reperfusion leading to cell death and organ dysfunction. In the heart, prolonged ischemia causes necrosis and contractile dysfunction, but the heart can recover from injury following brief ischemia. Many genes are expressed in the heart during recovery from ischemia. In particular, the expression of immediate early genes (e.g. c-fos, c-jun, and Egr-1) is rapidly up-regulated during post-ischemic reperfusion (1.Brand T. Sharma H.S. Fleischmann K.E. Duncker D.J.

Among transcription factors, the induction of c-fos is regulated by a serum response element in the promoter. Transcription factors p67SRF and p62TCF bind to the serum response element, the activity of which is regulated by the phosphorylation of p62TCF by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1 (5.Gille H. Sharrocks A.D. Shaw P.E. Nature. 1992; 358: 414-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). This indicates that MAPK serves as an important regulator of nuclear transcriptional activity. MAPK is a serine/threonine protein kinase whose activity is up-regulated by MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinases (MEKs)-catalyzed phosphorylation on tyrosine and threonine residues (6.Crews C.

It has been reported that ischemia-reperfusion injures the myocardium by Ca2+ influx through a Na+/H+-exchanger whose activity appears to be regulated by PKC (21.Ikeda U. Arisaka H. Takayasu T.

Furthermore, cycles of brief ischemia and reperfusion (designated preconditioning) protect the myocardium against infarction caused by subsequent sustained ischemia. This preconditioning effect might be mediated by PKC isoforms (24.Parrat J.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 19-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 25.Yoshida K.

In preceding studies, we demonstrated that PKCα, δ, ε, and ζ isoforms translocate to distinct fractions during ischemia (29.Yoshida K. Hirata T. Akita Y. Mizukami Y. Yamaguchi K. Sorimachi Y. Ishihara T. Kawashima S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1317: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 30.Mizukami Y. Hirata T. Yoshida K.

In particularly, PKCζ, which is expressed mainly in rat heart, translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during ischemia (30.Mizukami Y. Hirata T. Yoshida K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, the nuclear proteins nucleolin and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein are PKCζ substrates, suggesting that PKCζ may play a role in nuclear signal transmission (32.Municio M.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 31130-31137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, the role of PKCζ in the ischemic heart is presently unknown. We have demonstrated that ischemia induces the nuclear translocation of MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1, both of which are activated during post-ischemic reperfusion, suggesting that a MAPK activation pathway may be present in nuclei in ischemic heart (4.Mizukami Y. Yoshioka K. Morimoto S. Yoshida K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16657-16662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 34.Mizukami Y. Yoshida K. Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, the upstream pathway for MAPK activation during ischemia and reperfusion remain unknown. The present study uses an ischemia and reperfusion cell model to examine the upstream kinases of MAPK activation. The results obtained here indicate that during reoxygenation after ischemic hypoxia, an atypical PKC, PKCζ, that is activated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) participates in the activation of MAPK through MEK in the nucleus. DISCUSSIONp42MAPK was preferentially activated during reoxygenation after ischemic hypoxia as compared with p44MAPK, implying that the activating pathway of MAPK may be different than that induced by serum or PMA stimulation since both p42MAPK and p44MAPK are activated by treatment with serum and PMA. The inhibition of PKCζ expression and the activity significantly suppresses the phosphorylation of MAPK during reoxygenation, demonstrating that PKCζ is involved in MAPK activation. In cells expressing the CA mutant of PKCζ, MAPK phosphorylation was undetectable in unstimulated cells. The activation of MAPK may require that PKCζ translocates from the cytosol to other organelle where the MAPK pathway is present during ischemic hypoxia. This activation pathway might exist in the nucleus based on the following reasons. First, during ischemic hypoxia and reoxygenation, PKCζ localizes mainly in the nucleus where phosphorylated MAPK is also detected. Second, the nuclear localization of PKCζ is blocked during ischemic hypoxia and reoxygenation in wortmannin-treated cells. Consistent with the localization of PKCζ in the cytoplasm, the phosphorylation of MAPK during reoxygenation is also suppressed by wortmannin. We also observed the nuclear translocation of MEK, an upstream kinase for MAPK, during ischemic hypoxia, 2Y. Mizukami, K. Mogami, N. Todoroki-Ikeda, and S. Kobayashi, unpublished observations. and reoxygenation for 15 min after ischemic hypoxia led to phosphorylation of MEK only in the nucleus although the active form of MEK remained in the cytoplasm for 15 min after serum stimulation. The phosphorylation of MEK during reoxygenation was blocked by PKC inhibitors and PI3K inhibitors as shown in this study. These observations indicate that nuclear PKCζ activates the MEK/MAPK pathway. It was initially thought that MEK is always localized in the cytoplasm, but Tolwinski et al.recently demonstrated that MEK also translocates to the nucleus in mammalian cells in a regulatable manner during mitosis (45.Tolwinski N.S. Shapiro P.S. Goueli S. Ahn N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6168-6174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). How does MEK uptake into the nucleus during ischemic hypoxia occur? One possibility is that a decrease in intracellular ATP by depletion of molecular oxygen and glucose during ischemic hypoxia may lead to the nuclear accumulation of MEK by inhibiting nuclear export via a nuclear export signal that is known to be dependent on intracellular ATP (46.Wen W.

Further investigations are required to elucidate the role of the PKCζ/MAPK pathway in pathogenic processes. p42MAPK was preferentially activated during reoxygenation after ischemic hypoxia as compared with p44MAPK, implying that the activating pathway of MAPK may be different than that induced by serum or PMA stimulation since both p42MAPK and p44MAPK are activated by treatment with serum and PMA. The inhibition of PKCζ expression and the activity significantly suppresses the phosphorylation of MAPK during reoxygenation, demonstrating that PKCζ is involved in MAPK activation. In cells expressing the CA mutant of PKCζ, MAPK phosphorylation was undetectable in unstimulated cells. The activation of MAPK may require that PKCζ translocates from the cytosol to other organelle where the MAPK pathway is present during ischemic hypoxia. This activation pathway might exist in the nucleus based on the following reasons. First, during ischemic hypoxia and reoxygenation, PKCζ localizes mainly in the nucleus where phosphorylated MAPK is also detected. Second, the nuclear localization of PKCζ is blocked during ischemic hypoxia and reoxygenation in wortmannin-treated cells. Consistent with the localization of PKCζ in the cytoplasm, the phosphorylation of MAPK during reoxygenation is also suppressed by wortmannin. We also observed the nuclear translocation of MEK, an upstream kinase for MAPK, during ischemic hypoxia, 2Y. Mizukami, K. Mogami, N. Todoroki-Ikeda, and S. Kobayashi, unpublished observations. and reoxygenation for 15 min after ischemic hypoxia led to phosphorylation of MEK only in the nucleus although the active form of MEK remained in the cytoplasm for 15 min after serum stimulation. The phosphorylation of MEK during reoxygenation was blocked by PKC inhibitors and PI3K inhibitors as shown in this study. These observations indicate that nuclear PKCζ activates the MEK/MAPK pathway. It was initially thought that MEK is always localized in the cytoplasm, but Tolwinski et al.recently demonstrated that MEK also translocates to the nucleus in mammalian cells in a regulatable manner during mitosis (45.Tolwinski N.S. Shapiro P.S. Goueli S. Ahn N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6168-6174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). How does MEK uptake into the nucleus during ischemic hypoxia occur? One possibility is that a decrease in intracellular ATP by depletion of molecular oxygen and glucose during ischemic hypoxia may lead to the nuclear accumulation of MEK by inhibiting nuclear export via a nuclear export signal that is known to be dependent on intracellular ATP (46.Wen W.

Another possibility is that the interaction of MEK to CRM1/exportin in the nuclear membrane (49.Stade K. Ford C.S. Guthrie C. Weis K.

The nuclear MEK/MAPK pathway will be able to induce gene expression rapidly under pathophysiological conditions. PKCζ, working as an upstream kinase of MAPK during reoxygenation after ischemic hypoxia, is activated by PI3K in response to various stimuli including ischemic hypoxia as indicated in this study (20.Takeda H.

Our recent studies have, however, suggested that an alternative route to GPCR phosphorylation may be an operation involving casein kinase 1α (CK1α). In the current study we investigate the involvement of CK1α in the phosphorylation of the human m3-muscarinic receptor in intact cells. We show that expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of CK1α, designed to act in a dominant negative manner, inhibits agonist-mediated receptor phosphorylation by ∼40% in COS-7 and HEK-293 cells. Furthermore, we present evidence that a peptide corresponding to the third intracellular loop of the m3-muscarinic receptor (Ser345-Leu463) is an inhibitor of CK1α due to its ability to both act as a pseudo-substrate for CK1α and form a high affinity complex with CK1α. Expression of this peptide was able to reduce both basal and agonist-mediated m3-muscarinic receptor phosphorylation in intact cells. These results support the notion that CK1α is able to mediate GPCR phosphorylation in an agonist-dependent manner and that this may provide a novel mechanism for GPCR phosphorylation. The functional role of phosphorylation was investigated using a mutant of the m3-muscarinic receptor that showed an ∼80% reduction in agonist-mediated phosphorylation. Surprisingly, this mutant underwent agonist-mediated desensitization suggesting that, unlike many GPCRs, desensitization of the m3-muscarinic receptor is not mediated by receptor phosphorylation. The inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate response did, however, appear to be dramatically potentiated in the phosphorylation-deficient mutant indicating that phosphorylation may instead control the magnitude of the initial inositol phosphate response.

The receptor-specific kinases involved are generally considered to belong to the G-protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) family which are characterized by their sequence homology to rhodopsin kinase (GRK-1) and that include the extensively studied β-adrenergic receptor kinases 1 and 2 (GRK-2 and -3, respectively) (2.Pitcher J.A.

These studies, and others, have led to the proposal that the GRKs, and in particular GRK-2, have a broad receptor substrate specificity and are able to phosphorylate and regulate GPCRs coupled to both adenylyl cyclase via Gs/i and those coupled to the phospholipase C pathway via Gq/11. In contrast to this model of GRK-mediated phosphorylation of GPCRs, our studies on the Gq/11-coupled m3-muscarinic receptor have suggested that there may be an alternative mechanism mediating agonist-dependent receptor phosphorylation. This receptor is rapidly phosphorylated on serine following agonist addition (20.Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9817-9823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with a time course that closely correlates with receptor desensitization as measured by diminished inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) and intracellular calcium responses (21.Tobin A.B. Lambert D.G. Nahorski S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 1042-1048PubMed Google Scholar). Initial characterization of the kinase involved in this phosphorylation event eliminated a role for protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (20.Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9817-9823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crude membranes prepared from CHO cells expressing recombinant m3-muscarinic receptor were also found to contain receptor kinase activity and that this activity was insensitive to inhibition by heparin and zinc at concentrations that were known to inhibit GRK-2 activity (22.Tobin A.B. Keys B. Nahorski S.R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These were the first data suggesting that the m3-muscarinic receptor was phosphorylated by a kinase that was distinct from GRK-2. By using a bacterial fusion protein of the third intracellular loop of the m3-muscarinic receptor as a pseudo-substrate for the “putative” muscarinic receptor kinase, we were able to purify, from porcine cerebellum, a 40-kDa protein kinase that in membrane reconstitution experiments was able to phosphorylate the m3-muscarinic receptor in an agonist-dependent manner (23.Tobin A.B. Keys B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3907-3916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence analysis identified this protein kinase as casein kinase 1α (CK1α) (24.Tobin A.B. Totty N.F. Sterlin A.E. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20844-20849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Importantly, the ability of CK1α to drive receptor phosphorylation was not restricted to the m3-muscarinic receptor since both rhodopsin and the m1-muscarinic receptor were also shown to be in vitro substrates that were phosphorylated in a stimulus-dependent manner (24.Tobin A.B.

Tobin A.B. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 338: 175-183Crossref Google Scholar). These in vitro studies suggested that CK1α may act as a cellular kinase for specific GPCRs, thereby offering an alternative and distinct route to GPCR phosphorylation from that of the GRKs. In the present study we explore this hypothesis further by using a catalytically inactive mutant of CK1α and a peptide corresponding to the third intracellular loop of the m3-muscarinic receptor to inhibit endogenous CK1α activity. These experiments provide evidence for a cellular role of CK1α in the phosphorylation and regulation of the m3-muscarinic receptor. COS-7, HEK-293, and CHO cells were grown in medium consisting of α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 μg/ml fungizone. Cells were grown in a 5% CO2, 95% air, humidified incubator at 37 °C. Wild type bovine casein kinase 1α that had been tagged at the N terminus with the FLAG epitope (F-CK1α) and cloned into pcDNA-3 (Invitrogen, see Ref. 24.Tobin A.B. Totty N.F. Sterlin A.E.

The mutagenesis primer used was GAGGAGGTGGCAGTGCGACTAGAATCCCAGAAGGCGAGGCATCCCCAGTTG. This created a Lys-Arg change at position 46 in the amino acid sequence of CK1α. The resulting construct F-CK1αK46R was contained in pcDNA-3 and also possessed a FLAG epitope tag on the N terminus. The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The sequence encoding amino acids Ser345–Leu463 from the third intracellular loop of the m3-muscarinic receptor was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction primers, 5′ primer, GGGGGTACCGCCACCATGTCCCTGGAGAACTCCGCCTCCTCCGAC, and 3′ primer, GGGTCTAGACTACAGAGTGGCTTCCTTGAAGGACAGAGG, and cloned intoKpnI and XbaI sites in pcDNA-3. The resulting construct was then used in transient transfections of HEK-293 cells or COS-7 cells or used to make stably expressing CHO cell lines. The m3-muscarinic receptor coding sequence contained in pcDNA-3 was digested with HindIII and then religated. This removed the coding sequence for amino acids Lys370–Ser425inclusive but maintained the reading frame of the remaining cDNA. Generation of the GST bacterial fusion proteins used in this study have been described previously (23.Tobin A.B. Keys B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3907-3916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Production and characterization of the m3-muscarinic receptor specific antiserum raised against residues Ser345–Leu463 in the third intracellular loop of the m3-muscarinic receptor has been previously described (20.Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9817-9823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pan-M antiserum was raised against a peptide (DRYFSVTRPLSYRAKRTPRC) corresponding to amino acids Asp122–Arg140 of the m1-muscarinic receptor. This sequence is conserved in the muscarinic receptor family, and the resulting antiserum would be expected to cross-react with all of the muscarinic receptor subtypes. The peptide was conjugated to Keyhole Limpet hemocyanin and injected into New Zealand White rabbits using standard protocols. Characterization of the antiserum using Western blots showed that the pan-M antiserum cross-reacted with the m1 and m3 muscarinic receptors. This antibody was used in immunoprecipitations where the phosphorylation of the Lys370–Ser425 deletion mutant was investigated. The CK1α-specific antiserum was raised against a peptide corresponding to the N terminus of bovine CK1α (MASSSGSKAEFIVGGKYKLC). Characterization of the antiserum using Western blots showed that it was able to cross-react with purified recombinant bovine CK1α and endogenous CK1α present in CHO, HEK-293, COS-7 cells, and rat brain. Cells were plated onto 12-well dishes 24 h before transfection (cells were 40–60% confluent at the start of transfection). Cells were transfected with m3-muscarinic receptor cDNA (contained in pcDNA-3) or co-transfected with m3-muscarinic receptor plus F-CK1αK46R or 3i loop peptide constructs. The transfection reagent used was Fugene (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using a total DNA concentration of 0.5 μg/well. In experiments to determine inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate levels, HEK-293 cells were plated onto 24-well dishes, and each well was transfected with 0.25 μg of DNA. Cells were used 48–72 h after transfection. CHO-K1 cells were transfected with the 3i loop peptide construct (described above) using the Fugene method. Clones expressing the peptide were selected in G418 (200 μg/ml) and screened for expression by Western blot using the m3-muscarinic receptor antiserum that was raised against this peptide (20.Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9817-9823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting stably transfected clones were then used in experiments where the m3-muscarinic receptor was transiently transfected. Cells plated onto 12-well dishes were washed in phosphate-free Krebs/HEPES buffer (10 mmHEPES, 118 mm NaCl, 4.3 mm KCl, 1.17 mm MgSO4·7H2O, 1.3 mmCaCl2, 25.0 mm NaHCO3, 11.7 mm glucose, pH 7.4) and incubated in phosphate-free Krebs/HEPES supplemented with [32P]orthophosphate (50 μCi/ml) for 1–2 h at 37 °C. Either vehicle or the cholinergic agonist, carbachol (0.1 mm), was added, and incubations were continued for a further 5 min. Reactions were terminated by rapid aspiration of the drug-containing media and application of 1 ml of ice-cold solubilization buffer (10 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, pH 7.4). Samples were left on ice for 15 min and then cleared by microcentrifugation. Antiserum (0.2 μg) was added, and the samples were left on ice for 60–90 min. Immune complexes were isolated on protein A-Sepharose beads, and the beads were washed three times with TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). In the case of receptor immunoprecipitations, the protein A-Sepharose pellet was then resuspended in 1 ml of TE, and an aliquot of the protein A slurry was removed corresponding to a known quantity of receptors as determined by radioreceptor assay (see below). This ensured that for each experiment the same number of receptors from each transfection was run on the gel. Isolated immune complexes were then resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE gels in the case of muscarinic receptors or 15% gels for the 3i loop peptide. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography, and the level of phosphorylation was assessed with a Bio-Rad model GS 670 densitometer. m3-Muscarinic receptor expression for each transfection was determined by incubating cells plated down onto 12-well dishes with 0.5 ml of Krebs/HEPES buffer (as above but containing KH2PO4 1.17 mm) containing a saturating concentration of muscarinic receptor antagonist [3H]N-methylscopolamine (∼0.5 nm) for 60 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed with ice-cold Krebs/HEPES buffer (3 times), and bound [3H]N-methylscopolamine was determined by liquid scintillation counting of cell extracts solubilized in solubilization buffer. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm atropine and was <3% of the total binding. Cells grown in 24-well dishes were washed with Krebs/HEPES buffer and challenged with agonist for the appropriate times. Incubations were terminated by rapid aspiration, addition of ice-cold 0.5 m trichloroacetic acid, and transfer to an ice bath. After 15 min the supernatant was removed and neutralized by addition of EDTA and Freon/tri-N-octylamine as described previously (21.Tobin A.B. Lambert D.G. Nahorski S.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 1042-1048PubMed Google Scholar). Extracts were brought to pH 7 by addition of NaHCO3 and stored at 4 °C until analysis. Ins(1,4,5)P3 mass measurements were performed using a radioreceptor assay described previously (26.Challiss R.A.J. Batty I.H. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The hippocampus and cerebral cortex from one rat was homogenized in 15 ml of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) by a 5-s pulse in a Polytron (maximum setting). A soluble brain fraction was prepared by centrifugation at 50,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was taken and used in the pull down experiment. GST-m3-muscarinic receptor fusion proteins (5 μg) were incubated with soluble rat brain extract (50 μg) for 1 h at 4 °C. GST fusion protein complexes were isolated on glutathione-Sepharose beads and washed three times in TE buffer. Beads were resuspended in Laemmli buffer and resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. The presence of CK1α was then determined by Western blot using the casein kinase 1α-specific antibody. HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with either recombinant bovine FLAG-tagged F-CK1α, FLAG-tagged F-CK1αK46R, or vehicle. 72 h after transfection cells were lysed with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mmEDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 2 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.6). The lysate was centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and the pellet discarded. To the lysate was added mouse M2 anti-FLAG antibody (0.1 μg) for 1 h at 4 °C followed by rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1 μg) for 20 min at 4 °C. The immune complexes isolated on protein A-Sepharose beads and washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mmMgCl2, pH 7.4). The immune complex was then used in a kinase assay by resuspending the protein A beads in kinase buffer containing 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP (2.5 μCi/nmol), 5 μg of α-casein (total volume = 30 μl). The reactions were allowed to proceed for 15 min at 37 °C and were terminated by the addition of Laemmli buffer (10 μl). Samples were resolved on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel which were then stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize α-casein, and an autoradiograph was obtained. To investigate whether the cellular kinase responsible for m3-muscarinic receptor phosphorylation was CK1α, we tested the ability of a catalytically inactive form of CK1α to inhibit agonist-mediated m3-muscarinic receptor phosphorylation. Lysine 46 in bovine CK1α corresponds to the conserved lysine found at the ATP-binding site of all protein kinases (27.Carrera A.C. Alexandrov K. Roberts T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 442-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). By point mutagenesis we constructed a lysine to arginine mutation at position 46 (called F-CK1αK46R) that would be predicted to result in a catalytically inactive kinase. Expression of F-CK1αK46R was confirmed in transiently transfected HEK-293 cells by Western blotting for the FLAG epitope that was engineered at the N terminus (Fig.1 A). Due to the epitope tag the recombinant mutant ran at a slightly higher molecular mass than the endogenous CK1α. Hence by Western blotting with a polyclonal CK1α antiserum that detected both endogenous CK1α and recombinant mutant kinase, we estimated that F-CK1αK46R and endogenous CK1α were expressed at approximately equivalent levels (Fig. 1 B). Similar results were obtained for F-CK1αK46R expressed in COS-7 cells (data not shown). In order to determine enzymatic activity, HEK-293 cells were transiently transfected with recombinant bovine F-CK1α or F-CK1αK46R, both of which were tagged at the N terminus with the FLAG epitope. In vitro kinases assays on FLAG antiserum immunoprecipitates revealed that the F-CK1αK46R had no detectable kinase activity (Fig. 1 C). Human m3-muscarinic receptors transfected into HEK-293 or COS-7 cells were phosphorylated in an agonist-dependent manner by endogenous protein kinase(s) (Fig. 2). Co-transfection of the m3-muscarinic receptor with F-CK1αK46R resulted in a decrease in agonist-mediated receptor phosphorylation by 40.1 ± 2.0% (n = 3, ±S.E.) and 43.1 ± 3.5% (n = 3, ±S.E.) in HEK-293 cells and COS-7 cells, respectively (Fig. 2). In these experiments cells were stimulated with a maximum concentration of agonist (carbachol; 100 μm) for 5 min, conditions that we have previously reported results in maximum phosphorylation of the receptor (20.Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9817-9823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In each experiment receptor expression was determined, and the amount of receptor applied to the gel was adjusted so that equal receptor numbers were run on the gel. Co-expression of the F-CK1αK46R with the receptor did not influence the level of m3-muscarinic receptor expression. Any differences we observed in the level of receptor expression between control and co-transfected cells (usually <30%) were probably due to experimental variations in transfection efficiencies. Earlier studies from our laboratory demonstrated that a bacterial fusion protein containing a portion of the third intracellular loop of the m3-muscarinic receptor (Ser345–Leu463) was able to inhibit CK1α-mediated muscarinic receptor phosphorylation in membranes (Ref. 23.Tobin A.B. Keys B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3907-3916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar; also see “Discussion”). Here we tested the ability of this peptide to inhibit m3-muscarinic receptor phosphorylation in intact cells. Expression of the transfected peptide, of ∼12.5 kDa, corresponding to amino acids Ser345–Leu463 (3i loop peptide) of the m3-muscarinic receptor was detected by Western blotting using an m3-muscarinic receptor antiserum that was raised against this peptide (20.Tobin A.B. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9817-9823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Transient co-expression of m3-muscarinic receptors with the 3i loop peptide in COS-7 cells resulted in a decrease in agonist-mediated m3-muscarinic receptor phosphorylation by 72.0 ± 5.9% (n = 3, ±S.E.) (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the basal phosphorylation seen in COS-7 cells was also reduced (∼60%) by the 3i loop peptide (Fig. 4). In HEK-293 cells m3-muscarinic receptor phosphorylation was also inhibited by expression of the 3i loop peptide, in this case by 45.9 ± 2.9% (n = 3, ±S.E.) (Fig. 4).Figure 4Expression of the 3i loop peptide reduces basal and agonist-mediated phosphorylation of the m3-muscarinic receptor. Cells expressing the m3-muscarinic receptor alone (CNT) or co-transfected with the 3i loop peptide (3i-P) were prelabeled with [32P]orthophosphate and stimulated with 0.1 mm carbachol (CCh) for 5 min. m3-muscarinic receptor phosphorylation was then determined by immunoprecipitation using an m3-muscarinic receptor antiserum. An equal number of muscarinic receptors was then applied to an 8% SDS-PAGE gel, and an autoradiograph was obtained. A, a representative gel from an experiment using transiently transfected COS-7 cells. In this example m3-muscarinic receptor levels were ∼1.7 pmol/mg protein.B, a representative gel from an experiment using transiently transfected HEK-293 cells. In this example m3-muscarinic receptor levels were ∼1.2 pmol/mg protein. C, a representative gel from an experiment where native CHO-K1 cells (CNT) or cells that were stably expressing the 3i loop peptide (3i-P) were transiently transfected with the m3-muscarinic receptor. In the experiment shown m3-muscarinic receptor levels were ∼0.5 pmol/mg protein. The data shown are representative of at least three experiments. The position of molecular mass markers are shown in kilodaltons.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also developed a stable CHO cell line that expressed the 3i loop peptide constitutively. This cell line was transiently transfected with the m3-muscarinic receptor and receptor phosphorylation compared with native CHO-K1 cells transiently transfected with the receptor. In these experiments expression of the 3i loop peptide reduced agonist-mediated phosphorylation of the m3-muscarinic receptor by 75.2 ± 3.4% (n = 4, ±S.E.). Furthermore, basal phosphorylation was also reduced in the presence of the 3i loop peptide (by ∼50%). The 3i loop peptide expressed in CHO cells was itself phosphorylated, but this phosphorylation was not altered by m3-muscarinic receptor stimulation (Fig. 5). The same results were obtained in COS-7 and HEK-293 cells (data not shown). CK1α contained in a crude soluble rat brain fraction specifically associated with the muscarinic receptor portion of a glutathione S-transferase (GST) bacterial fusion protein that contains the third intracellular loop sequence Ser345–Leu463, designated Ex-m3 (Fig.6). This interaction appeared particularly strong since washes in salt (KCl) up to a concentration of 2 m was not sufficient to disrupt binding of CK1α (data not shown). Deletion mutants of Ex-m3 were used to map the binding site of CK1α (Fig. 7 A). Truncation at the N- and C-terminals of Ex-m3 did not affect the ability of the fusion protein to interact with CK1α present in rat brain supernatant (Fig. 7 B) or recombinant bovine CK1α partially purified from infected sf-9 cells (data not shown). However, deletion of the region Lys370–Ser425(ΔLys370–Ser425) resulted in no detectable binding of CK1α (Fig. 7 B). A smaller deletion of 18 amino acids (His374–Val391) also resulted in a fusion protein that was unable to associate with CK1α (Fig.7 B). (Note, the identity of the doublet in the Ex-m3 pull down (lane 2, Fig. 7 C) is likely to be CK1α running at its correct molecular mass (the lower band) and CK1α that is still associated with Ex-m3 (upper band). The doublet in lane 5 (Fig. 7 C) is likely to be CK1α (the upper band) and an unknown protein that cross-reacts with the CK1α antiserum (lower band).)Figure 7Determination of the site of interaction between CK1α and the third intracellular loop of the m3-muscarinic receptor.

The PDGF B-chain (c-sisproto-oncogene) homodimer (PDGF BB) and v-sis, its viral counterpart, activate both α- and β-receptor subunits (α-PDGFR and β-PDGFR) and mediate anchorage-independent growth in NIH3T3 cells. In contrast, the PDGF A chain homodimer (PDGF AA) activates α-PDGFR only and fails to induce phenotypic transformation. In the present study, we investigated α- and β-PDGFR specific signaling pathways that are responsible for the differences between the transforming ability of PDGF AA and BB. To study PDGF BB activation of β-PDGFR, we established NIH3T3 clones in which α-PDGFR signaling is inhibited by a dominant-negative α-PDGFR, or an antisense construct of α-PDGFR. Here, we demonstrate that β-PDGFR activation alone is sufficient for PDGF BB-mediated anchorage-independent cell growth. More importantly, inhibition of α-PDGFR signaling enhanced PDGF BB-mediated phenotypic transformation, suggesting that α-PDGFR antagonizes β-PDGFR-induced transformation.

NIH 3T3 cells have been widely used as a model to study PDGF-induced phenotypic transformation, including anchorage-independent cell growth. In contrast to PDGF BB, PDGF AA fails to induce transformation of NIH 3T3 cells, although PDGF AA and BB are equally potent mitogens (7.Beckmann M.P. Betsholtz C. Heldin C.H. Westermark B.

Dimerization and autophosphorylation of PDGFR occur upon receptor-ligand interaction. Differential binding of initial signaling molecules to phosphorylated PDGFRs is thought to mediate overlapping but distinct α- and β-PDGFRs-induced signaling pathways. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members are among the most critical signaling molecules for PDGF responses. PDGF activates extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), members of the MAPK family. ERKs are essential for growth factor-mediated mitogenic responses in various cell types (13.Mallat A.

At present, it is unclear how tyrosine kinase receptor-mediated signaling regulates different cellular responses such as cell proliferation, transformation, growth arrest, and apoptosis. Since PDGF BB activates both α- and β-PDGFRs and PDGF AA activates only α-PDGFR, we have raised two important questions aimed at understanding the difference between the transforming ability of PDGF AA and BB. First, is β-PDGFR alone sufficient for PDGF BB-mediated anchorage-independent cell growth, or is activation of both receptors required? Second, what signaling molecules are differentially regulated by α- and β-PDGFRs that cause distinct α- and β-PDGFRs-induced cellular responses? To address these questions, we have established NIH3T3 clones in which α-PDGFR activation is inhibited by its dominant-negative mutant, or α-PDGFR expression is down-regulated using an antisense construct. Using these clones, PDGF BB activation of β-PDGFR was investigated. PDGF AA activation of α-PDGFR and PDGF BB activation of both receptors was studied in control NIH 3T3 cells. NIH3T3 cells were cultured in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 nutrient media containing 10% bovine calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 250 μg/ml amphotericin B, and 205 μ g/ml sodium deoxycholate (Life Technologies, Inc.). Anti-active MAPK (ERK) and anti-active JNK antibodies were from Promega (Madison, WI). Anti-Erk2 antibody was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), anti-β-actin antibody from Sigma, and anti-phosphotyrosine antibody from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA). Monoclonal Ab against α- or β-PDGFR was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal Ab against α-PDGFR was prepared as described previously (27.Bejcek B.E. Voravud N. Deuel T.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A dominant negative mutant of α-PDGFR was constructed as follows. The murine α-PDGFR cDNA (HBXK construct provided by Dr. Eisenbach) was digested withBamHI, and the 1.9-kb fragment was ligated into theBamHI site of pcDNAI/Neo expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The orientation was determined by DNA sequencing. The construct utilized an in-frame TAG in the pcDNAI/Neo polylinker as a translation stop codon. Antisense α-PDGFR was constructed with the same 1.9-kb BamHI fragment inserted inversely into theBamHI site of pcDNAI/Neo. These constructs were then transfected into NIH 3T3 cells using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfectants were selected on the basis of neomycin-resistant phenotype in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), and individual clones were isolated. Cells were lysed in SDS lysis buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS), and protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay kit from Pierce. Equal amounts of protein in each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were subjected to 1 h of blocking with 5% nonfat milk in TTBS (0.02% Tween 20, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl), followed by incubation with primary antibodies in TTBS for 1 h. After three washes with TTBS, the blot was incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The antigen was detected using the ECL detection system (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (RIPA buffer: 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate acid, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μ g/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Protein concentrations were determined with BCA protein assay kit. The lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 12,000 × g to remove debris, and immunoprecipitated using anti-PDGF receptor Ab, and protein G-agarose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Immunoprecipitates were washed five times with RIPA buffer and resolved by reducing SDS-PAGE. Tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGFRs were detected by immunoblotting using the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Soft agar assay was performed as described previously (9.Kim H.R. Upadhyay S. Korsmeyer S. Deuel T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30604-30608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in six-well plates using a 3-ml basal layer of 0.6% agarose in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium supplemented as described above. Five thousand cells in 0.35% agarose containing various concentration of PDGF AA or BB were plated on top of the basal agarose layer in each well. Fresh top agarose containing PDGF was overlaid every other day. After 1–3 weeks, positive colonies were photographed under 400× magnification. All of the colonies were stained using Giemsa solution (Sigma). Colonies bigger than 0.2 or 0.5 mm were counted. In order to examine the effect of β-PDGFR activation alone in PDGF-mediated anchorage-independent cell growth, we established NIH3T3 cell clones in which α-PDGFR signaling is inhibited. One approach was to prevent autoactivation of α-PDGFR using a dominant-negative mutant of α-PDGFR (DN α-PDGFR) that contains the extracellular and transmembrane domains, but lacks the cytoplasmic kinase domains (Fig.1). The DN α-PDGFR protein was expected to dimerize with wild-type α-PDGFR upon PDGF AA binding, but be unable to autophosphorylate the wild-type α-PDGFR, and therefore prevent α-PDGFR-mediated signal transduction. We selected DN α-PDGFR-transfected NIH3T3 clones (DN clones) that express truncated α-PDGFR mRNA (∼2 kb) by Northern blot analysis (data not shown). To identify the DN clones in which α-PDGFR autoactivation is inhibited, the α-PDGFR protein was immunoprecipitated with an anti-α-PDGFR Ab and the active form was detected by immunoblot analysis using an anti-phosphotyrosine Ab. While α-PDGFR was autophosphorylated in the control cells following PDGF AA treatment, the active form of α-PDGFR was undetectable in DN clones 9 and 16 (Fig. 2). This showed that DN α-PDGFR successfully prevented PDGF AA-mediated dimerization and activation of wild-type α-PDGFR in DN9 and DN16. Of note, the truncated DN α-PDGFR protein was not detected by immunoblot analysis, since anti-α-PDGFR Ab recognized the COOH terminus of α-PDGFR. The second approach to inhibit the α-PDGFR signaling was to down-regulate α-PDGFR expression using an antisense construct of α-PDGFR (AS α-PDGFR) (Fig. 1). The level of α-PDGFR expression was significantly down-regulated in AS clones 4 and 6, as determined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2). Hereafter, we present data obtained mostly using DN16 and AS6 to avoid redundancy.Figure 2Screening of dominant negative and antisense clones. A, 3 million cells grown in 100-mm culture dish were serum-starved for 48 h. After treatment with 50 ng/ml PDGF AA for 5 min, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer. Lysates (250 μg/lane) of the control NIH3T3 and dominant negative clones (DN7, DN9, and DN16) were immunoprecipitated with an anti-α-PDGFR polyclonal Ab and protein G-Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by reducing SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblot analysis with an anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (top panel).B, to confirm the amount of immunoprecipitated α-PDGFR protein in each sample, the same blot was reprobed with the anti-α-PDGFR mAb (bottom panel). C, 3 million cells grown in 100-mm culture dish were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer. Lysates (200 μg/lane) of the control NIH3T3 and antisense clones (AS4, AS6, AS7, and AS8) were immunoprecipitated with an anti-α-PDGFR polyclonal Ab and protein G-Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by reducing SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblot analysis with an anti-α-PDGFR mAb.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that α-PDGFR signaling is inhibited in DN and AS clones, PDGF AA-activation of ERK was examined. As shown in Fig.3, active ERK-2 was readily detected in the control NIH3T3 cells 7 min after exposure to 5 ng/ml PDGF AA. In contrast, PDGF AA-induced ERK-2 activation was significantly inhibited in DN and AS clones, showing that α-PDGFR signaling is down-regulated in these cells (Fig. 3). To ensure that β-PDGFR signaling is not significantly altered in DN and AS clones, the expression level and activation of β-PDGFR was examined. While PDGF AA induces α-PDGFR homodimerization only, PDGF BB induces homodimerization of αα- and ββ-PDGFRs and heterodimerization of αβ-PDGFR. Thus, if DN α-PDGFR levels are too high, β-PDGFR activation can also be disturbed by DN α-PDGFR. The efficiency of PDGF BB-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of β-PDGFR in DN and AS clones was similar to that in control NIH3T3 cells (Fig.4 A). In contrast, PDGF BB-induced α-PDGFR phosphorylation occurred only in the control NIH3T3 cells, but not in DN or AS cells (Fig. 4 B). This showed that DN α-PDGFR inhibited dimerization and activation of α-PDGFR without significant alteration of β-PDGFR activation. An antisense α-PDGFR construct contained cDNA encoding extracellular, transmembrane, and juxtamembrane domains of α-PDGFR in reverse orientation. Although α- and β-PDGFRs are closely related molecules, the antisense transcript of α-PDGFR should not interfere with β-PDGFR expression, since the nucleotide sequence homology is relatively low, especially in the extracellular domain. Indeed, Fig.4 A showed that β-PDGFR expression was not altered by AS α-PDGFR. The β-PDGFR protein and activation levels were comparable in the control NIH3T3, DN, and AS clones as determined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4 A). To further ensure that β-PDGFR signaling is intact in DN and AS clones, PDGF BB activation of ERK-2 was examined. As shown in Fig. 4 C, 5 ng/ml PDGF BB activated ERK-2 in DN and AS clones as efficiently as in the control NIH3T3 cells. We examined whether PDGF BB-mediated anchorage-independent cell growth requires activation of both α- and β-PDGFR, or if β-PDGFR alone is sufficient. Soft agar assay was performed to compare the efficiencies of PDGF BB-induced colony formation among the control NIH 3T3, DN, and AS cells. PDGF BB activation of β-PDGFR alone in DN and AS cells was sufficient to induce anchorage-independent cell growth (Fig.5 A). Surprisingly, the efficiency of PDGF BB-induced colony formation was significantly higher in DN and AS cells than in the control NIH3T3 cells (Fig.5 B), suggesting that inhibition of α-PDGFR signaling further enhanced PDGF BB-induced phenotypic transformation. This suggests that α-PDGFR may antagonize PDGF BB-induced transforming activity. Accumulating evidence implies that the balance between mitogenic (such as ERKs) and stress-induced (such as JNKs) signaling molecules downstream of Ras are critical for growth factor-induced cellular responses (28.Spiegel S.

ERK, a MAPK family member known to be critical for cell proliferation, was activated either by α- or β-PDGFR (Figs. 3 and 4 C), in agreement with the previous observation that PDGF AA and BB are equally potent mitogens (7.Beckmann M.P.

In contrast to ERK, JNK activity is associated with cell cycle arrest or cell death following the loss of cell anchorage (33.Cardone M.H. Salvesen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G. Frisch S.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 34.Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Kelaita D. Sicks S. J.

Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Recent studies showed that JNK activates caspases (cysteine proteases that initiate apoptotic cell death) and caspases further activate JNK, suggesting a positive feedback loop between JNK and caspases leading to cell death (33.Cardone M.H. Salvesen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G. Frisch S.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 34.Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Kelaita D. Sicks S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1377-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). We next asked if the ability of α-PDGFR to antagonize anchorage-independent cell growth is associated with its ability to activate the JNK pathway. To this end, we examined α- and β-PDGFR-induced activation of JNKs. Both PDGF AA and BB effectively activated JNK-1 in the control NIH3T3 cells, while they had little effect on JNK-2 (data not shown). The kinetics and dose responses of PDGF AA- or BB-induced JNK-1 activation were similar. Maximal JNK-1 induction occurred within 30 min with 50 ng/ml PDGF AA or BB (data not shown). PDGF AA-mediated JNK-1 activation was significantly inhibited in DN and AS clones as expected (Fig.6 A). Importantly, PDGF BB-induced JNK-1 activation was also drastically inhibited in these clones. This showed that β-PDGFR alone is not sufficient, and α-PDGFR signaling is critical for maximum induction of JNK-1 activity by PDGF. To ensure that lack of PDGF-induced JNK-1 activity was not due to intrinsic incapability to activate JNK-1 in these DN and AS clones, bFGF-activated JNK-1 was examined. As shown in Fig. 6 B, active JNK-1 was readily detectable in DN and AS clones following bFGF treatment, as in the control cells. To investigate the role of JNK-1 in PDGF BB-induced transformation, we introduced a dominant negative JNK-1 mutant (JNK1-APF, kindly provided by Dr. R. Davis, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA) into NIH 3T3 cells. JNK-1 is activated upon phosphorylation of Thr183 and Tyr185. JNK1-APF, a catalytically inactive JNK-1 mutant, was constructed by replacing Thr183 and Tyr185 with Ala and Phe, respectively (36.Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). The expression level of JNK-1 protein (sum of endogenous and mutant JNK-1) was significantly higher in JNK-APF-transfected NIH 3T3 cells than in the control vector-transfected cells (Fig.7 A). When PDGF activation of JNK-1 was examined, both PDGF AA and BB failed to activate JNK-1 in JNK1-APF-transfected NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 7 B), demonstrating a dominant negative activity of mutant JNK as reported previously (36.Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). PDGF BB-induced phenotypic transformation was markedly enhanced in JNK1-APF-transfected cells compared with the control cells (Fig.8), indicating that JNK-1 negatively regulates PDGF BB-induced transformation. To further confirm this, we next examined the effect of enhanced JNK-1 activity on PDGF BB-induced phenotypic transformation. To this end, we introduced wild-type JNK-1 (provided by Dr. R. Davis) into NIH 3T3 cells, and JNK-1 overexpression in these cells was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig.9 A). PDGF BB activation of JNK-1 was significantly enhanced in JNK-1-transfected cells (Fig.9 B), and the efficiency for PDGF BB-induced anchorage-independent cell growth was significantly reduced when JNK-1 activity was enhanced (Fig. 9 C). Taken together, the present study demonstrated that JNK-1 plays a critical role for PDGF regulation of cell transformation, and lack of JNK-1 activation in the absence of α-PDGFR enhances PDGF BB-induced phenotypic transformation in NIH3T3 cells.Figure 8Inhibition of JNK-1 enhances PDGF BB-induced transformation. A, control and JNK-1-APF-transfected NIH 3T3 cells were assayed for their ability to grow in soft agar in the presence of 25 ng/ml PDGF BB.

However, embryonic mortality of these knock-out mice does not allow studies of PDGF isoforms and their receptors in physiological and pathological processes in adults. Such processes include wound healing, inflammation, and proliferative diseases such as atherosclerosis, fibrosis, and tumorigenesis (reviewed in Refs. 1.Deuel T.F. Annu. Rev.

In vitro, primarily PDGF BB has been used to study PDGF-induced signaling pathways, which binds both α- and β-receptors (reviewed in Ref. 2.Rosenkranz S. Kazlauskas A. Growth Factors. 1999; 16: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The α- or β-PDGFR specific signaling pathway was investigated by introducing each receptor subunit into cells lacking endogenous PDGFRs (10.Claesson-Welsh L. Eriksson A. Moren A. Severinsson L. Ek B.

These variations are most likely due to innate differences in available signaling molecules, making it critical to investigate PDGFR-mediated pathways in cell types that express PDGFRs and contain the requisite signaling molecules for diverse PDGF-induced cellular responses. Using NIH3T3 cells that are highly responsive to PDGF, we studied the differential roles of α- and β-PDGFRs in PDGF BB-induced anchorage-independent cell growth and activation of signaling molecules. Here, we report a transformation-suppressing activity of α-PDGFR in PDGF BB-induced transformation through JNK-1 induction. Both PDGF AA and BB activated JNK-1 in NIH 3T3 cells without noticeable JNK-2 activation. JNKs are often constitutively activated in apoptotic cells (34.Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Kelaita D. Sicks S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1377-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and also during transformation processes induced by growth factors, virus, or oncogene products (50.Galley Y. Hagens G.

The JNK-2 isoform mediates EGF-induced transformation of human A549 lung carcinoma cells (53.Bost F. McKay R. Bost M. Potapova O. Dean N.M. Mercola D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1938-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In contrast to the transforming activity of JNK-2, suppression of JNK-1 activity by dominant negative JNK-1 (JNK1-APF) enhanced arsenite-induced cell transformation of mouse epithelium (54.Huang C. Ma W.Y. Li J. Goranson A. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14595-14601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), suggesting that JNK-1 transduces transformation-suppressing activity. JNK-1-mediated negative regulation of cell growth/survival was also suggested in another study (34.Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Kelaita D. Sicks S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1377-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Following loss of cell-substrata interactions, JNK activity increases, followed by cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (34.Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Kelaita D. Sicks S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1377-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Consistently, we found that JNK-1 down-regulation by either inhibition of α-PDGFR signaling or using a dominant negative JNK-1 mutant drastically increased anchorage-independent growth efficiency in NIH 3T3 cells in response to PDGF BB. PDGF activation of α-PDGFR does not induce phenotypic transformation in murine fibroblasts (9.Kim H.R. Upadhyay S. Korsmeyer S. Deuel T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30604-30608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, we previously showed that PDGF AA induces anchorage-independent cell growth of normal rat kidney (NRK) fibroblast cells that overexpress Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic gene product (9.Kim H.R. Upadhyay S. Korsmeyer S. Deuel T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30604-30608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bcl-2 was shown to inhibit JNK-1 activation and to prevent cell death following loss of cell anchorage (34.Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Kelaita D. Sicks S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1377-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). These studies (9.Kim H.R. Upadhyay S. Korsmeyer S. Deuel T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30604-30608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Kelaita D. Sicks S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1377-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), together with our present results, provided the basis for our working model for PDGF regulation of transformation pathway as diagrammed in Fig. 10. Activation of α-PDGFR may transduce both positive and negative signaling for cell transformation, while β-PDGFR mainly induces positive signaling for cell transformation. PDGF BB activation of both receptors shifts the balance of signaling to favor the transformation pathway, while PDGF AA activation of α-PDGFR alone does not. When α-PDGFR-mediated negative signaling is inhibited (e.g. by Bcl-2), α-PDGFR activation can result in phenotypic transformation. The present study clearly demonstrated that β-PDGFR activation alone is sufficient to induce phenotypic transformation of murine fibroblasts, and that α-PDGFR signaling down-regulates β-PDGFR-induced transformation through JNK-1 activation. However, it should be noted that PDGF BB activates JNK-1 as effectively as PDGF AA, and that PDGF BB induces phenotypic transformation in the presence of active JNK-1. In our working model (Fig. 10), we hypothesize that α-PDGFR, through activation of JNK-1, serves as a negative regulator for PDGF BB-induced phenotypic transformation. At present, it is unclear how α- and β-PDGFRs differentially activate JNK-1, a member of MAPK family. Tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors activate a protein kinase cascade that leads to MAPK activation by a complex mechanism involving the SH2/3 proteins, Grb2, Sos, and Ras (55.Vojtek A.B. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19925-19928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Several MAPK kinase kinases have been identified including c-Raf, c-Mos, and MEKK (56.Davis R.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Among them, MEKK-1 was shown to activate the JNK pathway (33.Cardone M.H. Salvesen G.S. Widmann C. Johnson G. Frisch S.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 315-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 57.Gibson S. Widmann C. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10916-10922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). While active Ras is sufficient for ERKs activation, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Rac1 are apparently required for maximum induction of JNK activity (58.Fritz G. Kaina B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1768-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 59.Page K. Li J. Hershenson M.B. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

Commun. 1997; 232: 273-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Both α- and β-PDGFRs can activate Ras and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways, yet the level and duration of the activation may differ between α- and β-PDGFR. This is suggested by the observation that the GTPase-activating protein of Ras, a negative regulator of Ras, preferentially binds to the β-PDGFR (61.Bazenet C.E. Kazlauskas A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 517-525PubMed Google Scholar, 62.Heidaran M.A. Beeler J.F., Yu, J.C. Ishibashi T. LaRochelle W.J. Pierce J.H. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol.

The subtle differences in the activities of the initial signaling molecules are likely to trigger different biochemical cascades leading to different cellular responses. Consistently, it was shown that prolonged activation of ERK induces PC12 cell differentiation (63.Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar) and constitutive activation of Raf-1 at the cytoplasmic membrane induces apoptotic cell death (64.Wang H.G. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C.

https://openalex.org/W2103038967,"The oxygenase component of biphenyl dioxygenase (BPDO) from Comamonas testosteroni B-356 dihydroxylates biphenyl and some polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), thereby initiating their degradation. Overexpressed, anaerobically purified BPDO had a specific activity of 4.9 units/mg, and its oxygenase component appeared to contain a full complement of Fe2S2 center and catalytic iron. Oxygenase crystals in space group R3 were obtained under anaerobic conditions using polyethylene glycol as the precipitant. X-ray diffraction was measured to 1.6 Å. Steady-state kinetics assays demonstrated that BPDO had an apparentk cat/K m for biphenyl of (1.2 ± 0.1) × 106m−1s−1 in air-saturated buffer. Moreover, BPDO transformed dichlorobiphenyls (diClBs) in the following order of apparent specificities: 3,3′- > 2,2′- > 4,4′-diClB. Strikingly, the ability of BPDO to utilize O2 depended strongly on the biphenyl substrate:k cat/K m(O2)= (3.6 ± 0.3), (0.06 ± 0.02), and (0.4 ± 0.07) × 105m−1 s−1 in the presence of biphenyl and 2,2′- and 3,3′-diClBs, respectively. Moreover, biphenyl/O2 consumed was 0.97, 0.44, 0.63, and 0.48 in the presence of biphenyl and 2,2′-, 3,3′-, and 4,4′-diClBs, respectively. Within experimental error, the balance of consumed O2 was detected as H2O2. Thus, PCB congeners such as 2,2′-diClB exact a high energetic cost, produce a cytotoxic compound (H2O2), and can inhibit degradation of other congeners. Each of these effects would be predicted to inhibit the aerobic microbial catabolism of PCBs.

These activities are of considerable practical interest due to their potential to destroy toxic, persistent pollutants, a strategy known as bioremediation (1.Timmis K.N. Steffan R.J. Unterman R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 525-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In the case of highly chlorinated, structurally diverse xenobiotics such as PCBs,1 the development of a practical bioremediation technology has been limited in part by the failure of existing microbial catabolic activities to effectively degrade these compounds (1.Timmis K.N. Steffan R.J. Unterman R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 525-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 2.Focht D.D. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1995; 6: 341-346Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This failure may arise because these activities have not yet evolved to degrade compounds that have only recently been introduced into the biosphere. An important aspect of the adaptation of catabolic activities for bioremediation is the study of the structure and function of key catabolic enzymes. Such studies provide insight into the molecular basis of an important biological process, thereby facilitating the modification of enzyme specificity and the design of novel metabolic pathways. BPDO catalyzes the initial reaction in the aerobic degradation of biphenyl and some PCBs. BPDO is a typical aromatic ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase, utilizing O2 and electrons originating from NADH to transform biphenyl tocis-(2R,3S)-dihydroxy-1-phenylcyclohexa-4,6-diene (Fig. 1) (3.Hurtubise Y. Barriault D. Powlowski J. Sylvestre M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6610-6618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Haddock J.D. Gibson D.T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5834-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This dihydroxylation prepares the ring for subsequent degradation by ring cleavage enzymes. The enzyme comprises an FAD-containing reductase (BphG), a Rieske-type ferredoxin (BphF), and a two-subunit oxygenase of α3β3 constitution that contains a Rieske-type Fe2S2 cluster and a mononuclear iron center. Accordingly, BPDO has been classified as a group IIB aromatic ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase together with benzene and toluene dioxygenases (5.Butler C.S. Mason J.R. Adv. Microbiol. Physiol. 1997; 38: 47-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Structural and spectroscopic studies of related dioxygenases indicate that the mononuclear iron center orchestrates substrate transformation (reviewed in Ref. 6.Que Jr., L. Ho R.Y.N Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2607-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). BphG, BphF, and the oxygenase Fe2S2 cluster function to transfer electrons from NADH to this center. BPDO is a major determinant of the PCB-catabolizing capabilities of biphenyl-degrading strains, and the enzymes from different strains possess significantly different congener-transforming abilities. For example, BPDOLB400 from Burkholderia cepaciaLB400 transforms a much broader range of congeners than BPDOKF707 from Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenesKF707, even though they share over 95% sequence identity. Interestingly, BPDOKF707 transforms 4,4′-diClB much more effectively than BPDOLB400 (7.Gibson D.T. Cruden D.L. Haddock J. Zylstra G.J. Brand J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4561-4564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BPDOB-356 fromComamonas testosteroni B-356, which shares 70% sequence identity with BPDOLB400 and BPDOKF707, transforms a more limited range of congeners than BPDOLB400, but also transforms 4,4′-diClB poorly (8.Barriault D. Pelletier C. Hurtubise Y. Sylvestre M. Int. Biodeterior. Biodegrad. 1997; 39: 311-316Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Moreover, BPDOB-356 and BPDOKF707 exclusively catalyze the 2,3-dihydroxylation of biphenyl substrates (7.Gibson D.T. Cruden D.L. Haddock J. Zylstra G.J. Brand J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4561-4564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Hurtubise Y. Barriault D. Sylvestre M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5828-5835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the LB400 homologue catalyzes the 3,4-dihydroxylation of certain PCB congeners (10.Haddock J. Horton J.R. Gibson D.T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 20-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, BPDOLB400 has been shown to catalyze the dehalogenation of certain ortho-chlorinated congeners (10.Haddock J. Horton J.R. Gibson D.T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 20-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Significantly, no BPDO has been found to effectively transform highly chlorinated biphenyls. Several investigators have attempted to elucidate the structural determinants of congener preference in BPDO with the ultimate objective of enhancing this enzyme's PCB-transforming ability. Studies of variant BPDOLB400 and BPDOKF707 implicate a relatively small number of residues in the carboxyl terminus of the oxygenase α-subunit in determining congener preference (11.Mondello F.J. Turcich M.P. Lobos J.H. Erickson B.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 3096-3103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Kimura N. Nishi A. Goto M. Furukawa K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3936-3943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, chimeric oxygenases obtained by shuffling the genes encoding BPDOLB400 and BPDOKF707 possess enhanced PCB-degrading abilities with respect to the parental enzymes (13.Kumamaru T. Suenaga H. Mitsuoka M. Watanabe T. Furukawa K. Nature Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 14.Brühlmann F. Chen W. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1999; 63: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This is consistent with studies of related enzymes, such as naphthalene dioxygenase, in which the determinants of substrate specificity appear to reside in the carboxyl terminus of the α-subunit (15.Parales R.E. Emig M.D. Lynch N.A. Gibson D.T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2337-2344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the substrate preferences of hybrid oxygenases in which the α- and β-subunits originate from more divergent enzymes, such as BPDOLB400, BPDOB-356, and BPDOP6, clearly indicate that the β-subunit contributes to determining substrate preference (9.Hurtubise Y. Barriault D. Sylvestre M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5828-5835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Chebrou H. Hurtubise Y. Barriault D. Sylvestre M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4805-4811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Detailed structural and biochemical information on BPDO would greatly facilitate ongoing efforts to enhance this enzyme's PCB-degrading capabilities and contribute to our understanding of ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases. The ability to obtain such information has been limited by the propensity of the BPDO oxygenase to form inclusion bodies inEscherichia coli, its O2 lability, and the lack of a continuous activity assay. We report here the improved expression and purification of recombinant BPDOB-356. An oxygraph assay was established to investigate the specificity of the enzyme and its steady-state utilization of O2 in the presence of different biphenyls. Conditions for crystallization of the BPDO oxygenase were established, and analysis of preliminary x-ray diffraction data from these crystals is reported. Biphenyl was purchased from Aldrich (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) and Anachemia (Quebec, Canada). Catechol was purchased from Fisher (Quebec). 2,3-Dihydroxybiphenyl was a kind gift from Professor Victor Snieckus. 2,2′-diClB was purchased from Analabs, Inc. (North Haven, CT). 3,3′- and 4,4′-diClBs were purchased from ULTRA Scientific (North Kingstown, RI). Restriction enzymes andPfuI polymerase were purchased from Promega and Stratagene, respectively. Synthetic oligonucleotides with the sequences 5′-CCGGATTAATTAGAGCTCCCGACACGTGC-3′ and 5′-CAGGTGAAGGCCTTTGCGTTGCCA-3′ were purchased from the Sheldon Biotechnology Center (McGill University, Montreal, Canada). TheSacI restriction site introduced by the former is underlined. Kits used to screen for potential crystallization conditions were from Hampton Research (Laguna Niguel, CA), and PEGs used in crystallization protocols were from Fluka (Milwaukee, WI). Ferene S was purchased from ICN Biomedicals Inc. (Aurora, OH). All other chemicals were of analytical or HPLC grade. Strains used for protein expression or DNA propagation included E. coli DH5α (17.Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8216) Google Scholar),E. coli JM109 (18.Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar), and Pseudomonas putida KT2442 (19.Herrero M. de Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6557-6567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). E. coli and P. putida were grown at 37 and 30 °C, respectively. Plasmids used were pVLT31 (20.Lorenzo V.D. Eltis L. Kessler B. Timmis K.N. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) and pUCBPHA-C, a derivative of pUC18 that contains a 6.3-kilobase pairSmaI-SmaI fragment of C. testosteroniB-356 DNA that includes bphAEXFBC (21.Bergeron J. Ahmad D. Barriault D. Larose A. Sylvestre M. Can. J. Microbiol. 1994; 40: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Strains harboring pVLT31 and its derivatives were grown in the presence of tetracycline (10 μg/ml). For BPDO expression, strains were grown in Luria-Bertani broth containing a phosphate buffer originally described for Terrific Broth (22.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997Google Scholar) and supplemented (10 ml/liter) with an HCl-solubilized solution of minerals (23.Vaillancourt F.H. Han S. Fortin P.D. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34887-34895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). One liter of medium in a 2.8-liter Fernbach flask was inoculated with 9 ml of an overnight culture. When theA 600 of the culture reached 0.7, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the culture was incubated for an additional 18 h before harvesting by centrifugation. The harvested cell pellet was washed twice with 500 ml of 25 mmHEPES (pH 7.3) containing 10% glycerol and frozen until use. DNA was purified using the Wizard Plus Minipreps kit (Promega). DNA was digested, ligated, and transformed into E. coli using standard protocols (24.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA was amplified using polymerase chain reactions containing 0.3 μg of the template DNA, 2.5 units of Pfu polymerase, 0.4 mm each dNTP, and 20 pmol of each oligonucleotide primer in a final volume of 25 μl. Twenty temperature cycles were performed using a DNA thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer) as follows: 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 45 s. Plasmids were introduced into P. putida KT2442 by electroporation using the Pulse Controller and Gene Pulser from Bio-Rad (Ontario) with 1-mm cuvettes (BTX, Inc., San Diego, CA) (25.Cho J.H. Kim E.K. So J.S. Biotechnol. Tech. 1995; 9: 41-44Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was performed at the Sheldon Biotechnology Center using a Perkin-Elmer 373A sequencer and the ABI sequencing strategy. Chromatography was performed on anÄKTA Explorer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Quebec). This system was installed next to a Labmaster Model 100 glove box (M. Braun, Inc. Peabody, MA) so that anaerobic buffers could be delivered to the former and the column eluate could be directed to a fraction collector in the glove box (23.Vaillancourt F.H. Han S. Fortin P.D. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34887-34895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Buffers were prepared using water purified on a Barnstead NANOpure UV apparatus to a resistivity of > 17.5 megaohms-cm. Buffer A contained 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mmferrous ammonium sulfate. Buffer B was buffer A containing 1m NaCl, and buffer PS was buffer A containing 5% saturated ammonium sulfate. Buffers HA and HB contained 5 and 400 mmsodium phosphate (pH 6.3), respectively, 10% glycerol, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Warmed buffers were degassed with N2 and equilibrated in the glove box for 24 h before adding dithiothreitol and ferrous ammonium sulfate. The washed cell pellet from 10 liters of culture was resuspended in 80 ml of 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.3) and 10% glycerol containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mg/ml DNase I, 1 mm MgCl2, and 2 mmCaCl2. Cell suspensions were sonicated in 45-ml batches using a Virsonic 475 apparatus with 10 × 12-s pulses at level 6. The cell debris was removed by ultracentrifugation for 60 min at 300,000 × g. The clear supernatant was carefully decanted, passed through a 0.45-μm filter, and diluted with 80 ml of buffer A. This fraction, identified as crude extract, was degassed. All subsequent procedures were performed under an inert atmosphere unless otherwise specified. The crude extract was divided into five portions, each of which was loaded onto a Source 15Q anion-exchange column (2 × 9 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was operated at a flow rate of 15 ml/min. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 0.15 m over 10 column volumes. Fractions with absorbances at 323 and 455 nm, characteristic of the Rieske-type Fe2S2 center, and that contained the expected polypeptides, as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were concentrated to 20 ml by ultrafiltration using a stirred cell equipped with a YM-30 membrane (Amicon, Ontario) and filtered. The preparation was brought to 5% saturation with ammonium sulfate, divided into two equal portions, filtered, and loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose column (1 × 9 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with buffer PS. The column was operated at a flow rate of 0.75 ml/min. The oxygenase eluted at 0% saturated ammonium sulfate in a decreasing ammonium sulfate concentration gradient (5 to 0% over 2 column volumes). Reddish-colored fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration and equilibrated with buffer HA by gel filtration on a 0.7 × 12.5-cm column of Bio-Gel P6 DG (Bio-Rad). The sample was then loaded onto a hydroxylapatite type II resin column (2 × 5 cm, 20-μm diameter; Bio-Rad), and the protein was eluted with a linear gradient from 60 to 120 mmsodium phosphate over 3 column volumes. Fractions of characteristic absorbance were concentrated to 15–20 mg/ml by ultrafiltration and flash-frozen as beads in liquid N2. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a 12% resolving gel was performed using a Bio-Rad MiniPROTEAN II apparatus, and gels were stained with Coomassie Blue according to established procedures (26.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were estimated using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent kit (Pierce) after removal of interfering substances (27.Brown R.E. Jarvis K.L. Hyland K.J. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 180: 136-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin was used as a standard. Iron content was determined colorimetrically using Ferene S (28.Haigler B.E. Gibson D.T. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 457-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sulfur content was determined colorimetrically withN,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine and Na2S as a standard (29.Chen J.S. Mortenson L.E. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 79: 157-165Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Concentrations of recombinant BphFLB400 and BphGB-356 were determined spectrophotometrically using ε326 = 9 mm−1cm−1 2 and ε450 = 11.8 mm−1cm−1, 3R. Aumont, personal communication.respectively. 2,3-Dihydroxybiphenyl dioxygenase (DHBD) and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase were prepared as described previously (23.Vaillancourt F.H. Han S. Fortin P.D.

Enzyme activity was measured by following O2 consumption using a computer-interfaced Clark-type polarographic O2 electrode (YSI Model 5301) (23.Vaillancourt F.H. Han S. Fortin P.D. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34887-34895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) or a Hansatech DW1 O2 electrode with a similar interface. Data were recorded every 0.1 s. Initial velocities were determined from progress curves by analyzing the data using Microsoft Excel. The slope of the progress curve and the correlation coefficient of the slope were calculated for all consecutive 6-s intervals using the full set of 61 data points (23.Vaillancourt F.H. Han S. Fortin P.D. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34887-34895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The standard activity assay contained 70 μmFe(SO4)2(NH4)2, 288 μm biphenyl, 123 μm NADH, 1.2 μm BphGB-356, 2.8 μmBphFLB400, and 0.36 μm oxygenase. The reaction was initiated by adding oxygenase after equilibrating the assay with all other components for 20 s. The assay was performed in a total volume of 1.3 ml of air-saturated 50 mm MES (I = 0.05 m; pH 6.0) at 25.0 ± 0.1 °C. Buffers and stock solutions were prepared fresh daily. Stock solutions and protein samples were prepared anaerobically, stored under argon on ice, and withdrawn using a gas-tight syringe. The O2 electrode was zeroed and calibrated on each day kinetic assays were performed using either DHBD or, at O2concentrations lower than 75 μm, catechol 2,3-dioxygenase as described previously (23.Vaillancourt F.H. Han S. Fortin P.D. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34887-34895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Activity determinations were corrected for the O2 consumption observed in the presence of NADH, biphenyl, reductase, and ferredoxin only. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the quantity of enzyme required to consume 1 μmol of O2/min under the standard assay conditions. Apparent steady-state kinetic parameters for biphenyls were determined by measuring rates of oxygen uptake in the presence of quantities of biphenyls up to and exceeding their respective solubility limits. In this respect, the solubilities of biphenyl and 2,2′-, 3,3′-, and 4,4′-diClBs were taken to be 45, 4.5, 1.6, and 0.27 μm, respectively (32.Mackay D. Shiu W.Y. Ma K.C. Illustrated Handbook of Physical-Chemical Properties and Environmental Fate for Organic Chemicals. Lewis Publishers, Inc., Chelsea, MI1992Google Scholar). These values, reported in water, are similar to those in 50 mm MES (pH 6.0) at 25 °C as determined by titrating buffer with stock solutions of biphenyls in ethanol and monitoring UV-visible spectra for the appearance of turbidity at 400 nm as well as the absorbance of the biphenyl at 250 nm. For reactions performed using dissolved O2 concentrations other than that of air-saturated buffer, reaction buffers were bubbled with appropriate mixtures of humidified O2 and N2 gases for 15–30 min prior to the experiment as described previously (23.Vaillancourt F.H. Han S. Fortin P.D. Bolin J.T. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34887-34895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The equilibrated buffer was transferred to the reaction chamber using a gas-tight syringe, and the stopper was inserted into the reaction chamber. The reaction chamber was flushed continuously with the humidified gas mixture during this operation as well as during the assay. For reactions performed using O2concentrations lower than 2.5%, the reaction chamber was blanketed with argon. Standard curves were established for the ranges 0–5, 5–20, and 20–100% O2. Initial velocities determined at different substrate concentrations were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the least-squares fitting and dynamic weighting options of LEONORA (33.Cornish-Bowden A. Analysis of Enzyme Kinetic Data. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar). Coupling experiments were carried out in 50 mm MES (pH 6.0) at 25.0 ± 0.1 °C using excess biphenyl substrate, 350 μm NADH, and the same concentrations of BPDO components that were used in the standard activity assay. Reactions were initiated by adding oxygenase and were quenched 1–3 min later by diluting 300 μl of reaction mixture with 600 μl of methanol. Oxygen consumption was monitored using the O2 electrode. The consumption of biphenyl substrate was determined by HPLC measurements using a Hewlett-Packard 1050 Series system equipped with a C18 reverse-phase column (0.46 × 15 cm; Higgins Analytical, Inc., Mountain View, CA). The instrument was operated with solvents under a constant helium purge and at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Biphenyl was eluted with a 20-ml gradient of 50% H2O and 50% acetonitrile to 10% H2O and 90% acetonitrile. Samples of 100 μl were injected, and the amount of biphenyl was determined from the area of the absorbance peak at 203 nm using a standard curve. Standard curves with correlation factors >0.95 were established by determining the peak areas of known amounts of biphenyls. Samples for the standard curve were treated in the same way as reaction mixtures to account for any losses of biphenyl incurred during sample manipulation. The amount of hydrogen peroxide produced during biphenyl transformation was estimated using catalase, 650 units of which was added to the reaction mixture at the time corresponding to the methanol quench. The amount of O2 that was detected upon the addition of catalase was taken to represent 50% of the hydrogen peroxide produced during biphenyl transformation. All crystallization experiments were performed under anaerobic conditions in a N2 atmosphere glove box (Innovative Technologies, Newburyport, MA) maintained at ≤2 ppm O2. Samples of BPDO were prepared and stored under liquid N2 as described above. A typical sample contained 20 mg/ml enzyme, 80 mmsodium phosphate (pH 6.3), 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 2 mmdithiothreitol. The sitting-drop vapor-diffusion technique was used for all experiments. At initial conditions, the sitting drop had a volume of 4 μl and contained the protein sample and the well solution in a 1:1 ratio. The well volume was 1 ml. The sparse matrix method (34.Jancarik J. Kim S.H. J. Appl.

Improvement of promising conditions was pursued by variation of two parameters over a 24-cell grid. Crystals used in the diffraction experiments described below grew at 20 °C. The well solution initially contained 100 mm sodium citrate (pH 5.8), 10% (v/v) 2-propanol, and 24% (w/v) PEG 4000. All diffraction patterns were recorded from frozen crystals by the rotation/oscillation method. The patterns were analyzed and reduced to average intensities by the use of the HKL program suite (35.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar); intensities were converted to structure factor amplitudes using programs from the CCP4 package (36.The Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Crystals were prepared for diffraction experiments by soaking them for 1 min in 400 μl of a solution containing 100 mm sodium citrate (pH 5.8), 10% (v/v) 2-propanol, 24% (w/v) PEG 4000, and 20% (v/v) glycerol before flash-freezing by direct immersion in liquid N2. Initial, partial diffraction patterns were obtained by the use of CuKα radiation from a Rigaku rotating anode x-ray generator operated at ∼50 kV and 100 mA and equipped with focusing mirror optics and an R-axis IV imaging plate area detector (Molecular Structures Corp.). A cryogenic crystal-cooling device (Oxford Cryosystems, Oxford, United Kingdom) was used to maintain a nominal sample temperature of 110 K. Crystals were recovered after the initial experiments and stored under liquid N2 until diffraction studies were resumed at the Advanced Photon Source synchrotron using BioCARS beam line BM14D. At BM14D, diffraction patterns were measured at a nominal sample temperature of 108 K (Cryojet cooling device, Oxford Instruments USA, Boston, MA) using monochromatic x-rays of 1-Å wavelength, a crystal-to-detector distance of 74 mm, and a Quantum-1 CCD detector (Area Detector Systems Corp., Poway, CA). Digestion of pUCBPHA-C (21.Bergeron J. Ahmad D. Barriault D. Larose A. Sylvestre M. Can. J. Microbiol. 1994; 40: 743-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with KpnI yielded a 3178-bp fragment that, according to the sequence (37.Sylvestre M. Sirois M. Hurtubise Y. Bergeron J. Ahmad D. Shareck F. Barriault D. Guillemette I. Juteau J.M. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 174: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), contains the genes encoding BPDOB-356 oxygenase (bphAE) together with 1 kilobase pair of flanking upstream DNA. This fragment was purified and ligated with KpnI-digested and dephosphorylated pVLT31, a broad host range expression vector (20.Lorenzo V.D. Eltis L. Kessler B. Timmis K.N. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 123: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The construct containing the cloned fragment in the correct orientation, as verified by restriction digestion using SmaI, was designated pVLT31AE7. P. putida KT2442 containing pVLT31AE7 failed to express significant levels of BPDO when induced (data not shown). A second construct (designated pVLT31AE7-3) was derived from pVLT31AE7 by removing ∼1 kilobase pair between the Ptac promoter of pVLT31 and the ribosome-binding site of bphA. Briefly, a 411-bp fragment of DNA containing the 5′-end of bphA and its ribosome-binding site was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the oligonucleotides described under “Experimental Procedures,” purified from an agarose gel, and digested with SacI andSacII. This fragment was ligated into pVLT31AE7 digested with SacI and SacII, thereby replacing the 1400-bp SacI-SacII fragment of pVLT31AE7 with a 351-bp SacI-SacII fragment. In pVLT31AE7-3, the Ptac promoter is located 71 bp upstream of the ATG start codon of bphA. This construct was partially sequenc"

In a previous study, we showed that the activation of cPLA2 by OZ is tyrosine kinase-dependent. The present study demonstrates that the signals initiated by OZ involve activation of tyrosine kinase Pyk2 but not the formation of the adhesion protein complex, Shc-Grb2-Sos. Stimulation of cPLA2 activity by OZ is mediated by Fc γ receptors (FcγRs) and not by complement receptors for the C3b protein. Cross-linking of FcγRIIA or FcγRIIIB induces p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation. The kinetics of cPLA2 activity stimulated by either of the FcγRs or by both is similar to that of p38 MAP kinase and was detected as early as 15 s after stimulation, maintained a plateau for 10 min, and decreased thereafter. ERK activation was detected also within 15 s but decreased significantly 5 min after stimulation. The MEK inhibitor, PD-098059, or the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, SB-203580, caused a partial inhibition during the time course of cPLA2 activity, whereas their combination caused a total inhibition. Thus, although ERK activation is significantly shorter than that of p38 MAP kinase, it is equally required for activation and maintenance of cPLA2 activity by occupancy of a single receptor, FcγRIIA or FcγRIIIB.

Fc γ receptors cytosolic phospholipase A2 extracellular regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein opsonized zymosan dithiothreitol Hanks' balanced salt solution inactivated OZ phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride Immune complexes are recognized by specific receptors present on the plasma membrane of phagocytes: Fc γ receptors (FcγRs)1 and receptors for complement protein C3b. The binding of immune complexes by polymorphonuclear neutrophil receptors induces essential host defense and inflammatory responses such as adhesion, phagocytosis of antibody-coated microorganisms, degranulation, and respiratory burst (1.Smith J.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 56: 672-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Three different classes of FcγRs have been identified: FcγRI (CD-64), FcγRII (CD-32), and FcγRIII (CD-16), all of which differ in relative affinity for IgG, cellular distribution, and molecular composition. Neutrophils are unique in that they express not only the transmembrane FcγRIIA but also the only known nontransmembrane FcγR, the glycan phosphatidylinositol-linked FcγRIIIB. FcγRIIA is a 47-kDa integral glycoprotein, and FcγRIIIB is a heavily glycosylated protein with an apparent molecular mass of 50–80 kDa linked by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor to the outer plasma membrane (2.Daeron M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 203-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Additionally, neutrophils express two kinds of complement receptors, CR1 and CR3, both of which recognize surface C3b and C3bi, respectively (3.Ross G.D. Lambris J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1982; 155: 96-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 4.Fearon D.T. J. Exp. Med. 1980; 152: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of the transmembrane FcγRIIA initiates a tyrosine kinase cascade-dependent upon the cytoplasmic tail of this receptor, which contains one copy of an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif, a substrate for phosphorylation by members of the Src tyrosine kinase family (5.Hamada F. Aoki M. Akiyama T. Toyoshima K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6305-6309Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif can bind to and activate Syk-tyrosine kinase, which subsequently activates a number of effector pathways (6.Kiefer F. Brumell J. Al-Alawi N. Latour S. Cheng A. Veillette A. Grinstein S. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4209-4220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,7.Ghazizadeh S. Fleit H.B. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 30-41PubMed Google Scholar). FcγRIIA aggregation has been shown to be associated with enhanced activity of PI-3-kinase and of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II in human neutrophils (8.Liang L. Huang C.K. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 9.Vossebeld P.J. Homburg C.H. Roos D. Verhoeven A.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 465-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of human FcγRII on monocytes results in stimulation of several signal transduction events, including inositol phosphate metabolism (10.Liao F. Shin H.S. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3659-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), an increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration (11.Odin J.A. Edberg J.C. Painter C.J. Kimberly R.P. Unkeless J.C.

J. 1995; 305: 669-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The role of FcγRIIIB in triggering neutrophil function is controversial because it has no intracytoplasmic domain for direct association with the cytosolic signal transduction cascade. Some studies have suggested the inability of FcγRIIIB to independently transduce signals (15.Huizinga T.W. van Kemenade F. Koenderman L. Dolman K.M. von dem Borne A.E. Tetteroo P.A. Roos D. J.

On the other hand, others have suggested that cross-linking of FcγRIIIB by itself is able to mediate various functions, such as calcium mobilization (20.Edberg J.C. Salmon J.E. Kimberly R.P. Immunol.

Immunol. 1992; 22: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Despite all this accumulated data, the precise transduction pathway initiated by FcγRs leading to activation of p85 cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) remains obscure. We have previously shown the involvement of the MAP kinase, ERK1/2, in activating cPLA2 and superoxide production in human neutrophils stimulated with opsonized zymosan (OZ) as a model for the immune complex (28.Hazan I. Dana R. Granot Y. Levy R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The MAP kinase family includes the 42–44-kDa ERK, the stress-activated protein kinases: 38-kDa MAP kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and big MAP kinase (BMK, ERK5) (29.Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3209) Google Scholar). In various systems, both ERK and p38 MAP kinase have been shown to phosphorylate p85 cPLA2 on serine residue (505) and thus render it active (30.Lin L.L. Wartmann M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar, 31.Borsch-Haubold A.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We also provided evidence for the essential requirement of arachidonic acid signals generated by p85 cPLA2 in activation of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase (32.Dana R. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. Levy R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 441-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). ERK, cPLA2, and NADPH oxidase activities stimulated by OZ were all shown to be tyrosine kinase-dependent (28.Hazan I. Dana R. Granot Y. Levy R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To present, the specific tyrosine kinase-dependent pathways leading to activation of MAP kinases by FcγRs have not been identified. The regulation of some of the elements upstream to ERK1/2 have been elucidated and are best understood for tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor signaling (33.McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 363: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Receptor activation initiates a cascade of events leading to ERK1/2 activation and involves protein-protein interactions between the adaptor proteins Grb2 and Shc. The proline-rich tyrosine kinase (Pyk2) and focal adhesion kinase constitute a distinct family of nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases (34.Neet K. Hunter T. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 147-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In hematopoietic cells, Pyk2 is activated by a variety of extracellular stimuli such as the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α, T and B lymphocyte antigen receptor, CD-28 ligation, interleukin-2 receptor, FcεRI, and chemokine receptors (35.Fuortes M. Melchior M. Han H. Lyon G.J. Nathan C. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 36.Tokiwa G. Dikic I. Lev S. Schlessinger J.

The present study was designed first to evaluate the relative role of p38 MAP kinase and ERK in cPLA2 activation by OZ. Because this agent binds to FcγRIIA, FcγRIIIB, and C3bR, the role of each receptor was defined. Second, the involvement of tyrosine kinase-dependent elements in these signaling pathways was studied. Zymosan A, p-nitrophenylphosphate, cytochrome c, PMSF, leupeptin, benzamidine, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol, ATP, and DTT were obtained from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase and ECL detection kit for immunoblotting were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The myelin basic protein peptide (MBP) was synthesized at the Weizmann Institute (Rehovot, Israel). The MEK inhibitor PD-098509 was purchased from Biomol and the p38 inhibitor SB-203580 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-MAP kinase (sc-154 and sc-153) and anti-Pyk2 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-p38 MAP kinase, anti-active p38 MAP kinase and anti-active ERK were from Sigma. Anti-Sos 1/2 antibodies were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody, 4G10, was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. The F(ab′)2fragment goat anti-mouse was obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Anti-FcγRII mAb IV.3 Fab and anti-FcγRIII mAb 3G8 F(ab′)2 were obtained from Medarex Inc. (Annandale, NJ). The anti-Grb2 and anti-Shc polyclonal antibodies were provided by Dr. J. Schlessinger (New York University Medical Center). Rabbit anti-cPLA2 antibodies raised against a glutathione S-transferase fusion with cPLA2 as described earlier (28.Hazan I. Dana R. Granot Y. Levy R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Neutrophils were separated by Ficoll/Hypaque centrifugation, dextran sedimentation, and hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes (45.Boyum A. Scand. J. Immunol. 1976; 5 (suppl.): 9-15Crossref Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). The production of superoxide anion (O⨪2) by intact cells was measured as the superoxide dismutase inhabitable reduction of ferricytochrome c (46.Levy R. Malech H.L. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3066-3071PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were suspended (5 × 105 cells/well) in 100 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 150 μmferricytochrome c and stimulated by the addition of the appropriate stimulus. The reduction of ferricytochrome c was followed by a change of absorbance at 550 nm every 2 min over a 20-min time course on a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Melno Park, CA). The maximal rates of superoxide generation were determined using extinction coefficient E 550 = 21 mm−1 cm−1. Neutrophils were incubated with OZ or inactivated OZ (iOZ) for the indicated time at 37 °C. OZ was prepared as follows: 20 mg of zymosan was incubated with 1 ml of pooled human serum (LPS-free) for 1 h at 37 °C and washed three times with HBSS buffer. iOZ was prepared in the same way except that the serum was preheated to 56 °C for 30 min to inactivate the complement proteins. Alternatively, neutrophils were placed (5 × 106 cells/ml) on ice for 30 min with 1 μg/ml F(ab′)2 of anti-FcγRIIA or anti-FcγRIIIB. Excess antibodies were removed by centrifugation, and the cells were resuspended in HBSS buffer, prewarmed to 37 °C. Cross-linking of antibodies was performed with goat anti-mouse F(ab′)2fragments (10 μg/ml). Adding ice-cold HBSS buffer followed by centrifugation terminated the reaction. Negative control samples were incubated without primary antibody. The cells were resuspended at 108 cells/ml in iced buffered sucrose solution (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm sucrose, 0.5 mm ETDA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmbenzamidine, 2 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm NaF) (47.Syrbu S.I. Waterman W.H. Molski T.F. Nagarkatti D. Hajjar J.J. Sha'afi R.I. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2334-2340PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were disrupted by sonication and then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The cytosolic fraction protein was measured, adjusted, and used for immunoprecipitation of Pyk2 or immunoblotting of Pyk2 and cPLA2. Neutrophils (5 × 106 cells/ml) in HBSS buffer were stimulated at 37 °C with 1 mg/ml OZ; the reaction was stopped by 10-fold dilution with cold HBSS and immediate centrifugation at 4 °C. In every experiment 100-μl aliquots were taken from each reaction mixture to measure superoxide production on a microtiter plate. Neutrophils were lysed immediately with lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm ETDA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmbenzamidine, 1 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm NaF) and centrifuged (1 min at 15,600 ×g) to remove granules, nuclei and unbroken cells. Immunoprecipitation was conducted at 4 °C for 2 h using 300 μg of neutrophil protein lysate plus 30 μl of 50% protein A-Sepharose bound to 10 μl of anti-ERK antibody or 1.5 μl of polyclonal anti-p38 MAP kinase at a final volume of 300 μl. The beads were then washed once with RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 2 mm ETDA, 20 mmleupeptin, 1 mm PMSF) and once with 500 mmLiCl2 in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and twice with buffer A (50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, pH 7.3, 1 mm ETDA, 1.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm PMSF, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mmNa3VO4). The beads were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, pH 7.3, 1.25 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm ATP, and 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP using 2 mg/ml MBP peptide as a substrate. Reaction duration time was 20 min at 30 °C and was terminated by addition of 20 μl of Laemmli buffer. After boiling for 5 min, proteins were separated by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose by electroblotting. Phosphorylated proteins were visualized utilizing an autoradiography technique and quantified by a FUJIX BAS 1000 phosphoimager. Neutrophils (5 × 106 cells/ml) in HBSS buffer were stimulated for the indicated time at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by 10-fold dilution with cold HBSS and immediate centrifugation at 4 °C. PLA2 activity was performed immediately after lysate separation using sonicated dispersions of 1-stearoyl-2-[14C]arachidonyl phosphatidyl choline (30 μm, 50,000 dpm/assay) cosonicated withsn-1,2-dioleoylglycerol at a molar ratio of 2:1 in a assay mixture containing 5 mm DTT with some modifications, as described earlier (28.Hazan I. Dana R. Granot Y. Levy R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay mixture contained the phospholipid substrate in 80 mm KCl, 5 mmCaCl2, 5 mm DTT, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (48.Wijkander J. O'Flaherty J.T. Nixon A.B. Wykle R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26543-26549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The reaction was started by the addition of 100 μg of neutrophil lysate (within the linear protein range of the reaction) and incubated at 37 °C in a shaking water bath for 30 min. The radiolabeled fatty acids were counted (Packard spectrometry 1900CA), and the specific activity of cPLA2 was calculated. Equal amounts of neutrophil lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 20 μl of rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Grb2 or Shc cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) with dimethylpimelimidade (Pierce) (49.Dikic I. Dikic I. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14301-14308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For Pyk2 immunoprecipitation, 40 μl of anti-Pyk2 antibodies (Santa Cruz) were added to 1 mg of soluble fraction. Immunoprecipitation was conducted at a final volume of 1 ml for 4 h at 4 °C with shaking. The beads were then washed six times with lysis buffer (for Grb2 or Shc immunoprecipitation) or three times with sucrose buffer for Pyk2 immunoprecipitation. 20 μl of 2× sample buffer was added to the beads, and the mixture was boiled for 5 min. Lysates were solubilized in 5× sample buffer and analyzed by electrophoresis on 7.5 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The amount of protein in each sample was quantified with the Pierce BCA proteins assay using bovine serum albumin standards. The resolved proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose, which was stained with Ponsue red to detect protein banding, and then blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin in TBS (10 mm Tris, 135 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). The blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies. After four washings with TBS-T (TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20) the membranes were incubated with the second antibody, peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, or anti-mouse (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at room temperature and developed using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Changes in ERK or p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation were quantified by densitometry. The quantitative measurements are adequate to determine the changes in the same immunoblot. To reprobe the blots they were incubate in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) at 58 °C for 25 min, washed extensively with TBS, reblocked as described above, and reblotted with appropriate antibodies. The differences in means were analyzed by Student's t test. The plots were drawn as least squares regression lines and tested by analysis of variance. In a previous paper (28.Hazan I. Dana R. Granot Y. Levy R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that OZ stimulates ERK1 and ERK2 activity in human neutrophils and that ERK is involved in activation of cPLA2. A number of recent studies have shown stimulation of more than one member of the MAP kinase family by the same agent in phagocyte cells (50.Rane M.J. Carrithers S.L. Arthur J.M. Klein J.B. McLeish K.R. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 5070-5078PubMed Google Scholar, 51.Sanghera J.S. Weinstein S.L. Aluwalia M. Girn J. Pelech S.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4457-4465PubMed Google Scholar, 52.Nick J.A.

To evaluate whether OZ also activates p38 MAP kinase, human neutrophils were stimulated with 1 mg/ml OZ, and both p38 MAP kinase and ERK activities were determined. As presented in Fig. 1 A, stimulation of the cells with 1 mg/ml OZ for 2 min caused a significant increase in p38 MAP kinase activity, as detected by an in vitro kinase assay. This activity was totally inhibited by the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB-203580 in its optimal concentration (5 μm) to the basal levels that were detected in unstimulated cells. In contrast, p38 MAP kinase activity was not affected by 100 μm of the MEK inhibitor PD-098059. This PD-098059 concentration was found to be optimal for inhibition of ERK activity in human neutrophils stimulated by OZ (data not shown; see Ref. 28.Hazan I. Dana R. Granot Y. Levy R. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Activation of ERK was determined using phospho-specific antibodies against the phosphorylated form. Stimulation of neutrophils with 1 mg/ml OZ for 2 min caused a significant increase in ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 1 B). ERK phosphorylation was inhibited by 100 μm PD-098059 but was not affected by 5 μm SB-203580. Because both ERK and p38 MAP kinase are capable of phosphorylating and activating cPLA2 (30.Lin L.L. Wartmann M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar, 31.Borsch-Haubold A.G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), we utilized the MEK and the p38 MAP kinase inhibitors (whose specificity is demonstrated in Fig. 1) to evaluate the relative role of these two MAP kinases in cPLA2 activation. As demonstrated in Fig.2, preincubation of neutrophils with 100 μm PD-098059, which caused total inhibition of ERK activity, caused partial inhibition of cPLA2 activity following stimulation with OZ for 2 min (0.13 ± 0.041 pmol/μg/30 min compared with 0.31 ± 0.068 pmol/μg/30 min induced by OZ). Similarly, preincubation of neutrophils with 5 μm SB-203580, which caused total inhibition of p38 MAP kinase activity, caused partial inhibition of cPLA2activity following stimulation by OZ for 2 min (0.15 ± 0.04 pmol/μg/30 min compared with 0.31 ± 0.068 pmol/μg/30 min induced by OZ). Pretreatment of the cells with both inhibitors resulted in total inhibition of cPLA2 activity induced by OZ. These results clearly indicate that both ERK and p38 MAP kinase are required to induce complete activation of cPLA2 by OZ in human neutrophils. To differentiate between the role of these two types of MAP kinases in activation of cPLA2, the time course activation of each isotype by OZ was determined and compared with that of cPLA2. As shown in Fig.3 A, stimulation of neutrophils with 1 mg/ml OZ caused a temporary and transient phosphorylation of ERK1/2, reaching a maximal level at 1–2 min and decreasing thereafter. ERK1/2 phosphorylation could not be detected 10 min after stimulation. This blot also illustrates, by electrophoretic mobility shift, the same pattern of ERK activation that is demonstrated in Fig. 3 A. Phosphorylated ERK2 with reduced electrophoretic mobility was detectable as early as 15 s after stimulation and showed a maximum activation at 1–2 min. Phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase induced by 1 mg/ml OZ was detected 15 s after stimulation, peaked 2–5 min later, stayed elevated for 10 min, and slightly decreased at 20 min (Fig. 3 C). Western blot analysis with anti-ERK2 or anti-p38 MAP kinase antibody confirmed the presence of an equal amount the MAP kinase in each sample (Fig. 3, B and D). The different temporal patterns of activation of ERK and p38 MAP kinase by OZ would seem to indicate a distinct role for each of these MAP kinases in cPLA2 activation. Therefore, the time course of cPLA2 activity induced by OZ was determined by measuring arachidonic acid release from radiolabeled arachidonyl-phosphatidylcholine vesicles and was compared with the time course activation of each MAP kinase isotype. cPLA2activity was detected as early as 15 s after stimulation, maintained a plateau for 5 min, and decreased thereafter (Fig.4). 10 min after stimulation, cPLA2 activity was still elevated, similar to that of p38 MAP kinase, whereas ERK activity could not be detected. We also demonstrated cPLA2 activity after 2 min of activation by the retardation in the electrophoretic mobility shift detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 4, inset). The parallel kinetics of p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation and cPLA2 activity could imply that this type of MAP kinase is necessary for maintaining cPLA2 activity. If this were the case, 10 min after activation of cPLA2 (when both cPLA2 and p38 MAP kinase activities are still elevated), the presence of SB-203580 would reduce most of the cPLA2 activity, whereas the presence of PD-098059 would cause a lesser effect. However, the results analyzed 10 min after stimulation (Fig.5) demonstrated that either 5 μm SB-203580 or 100 μm PD-098059 caused about 50% inhibition of cPLA2, similar to their effect after 2 min of activation by OZ (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained during the whole time course of stimulation (data not shown). These results clearly indicate that p38 MAP kinase does not play a major role in maintaining c"
https://openalex.org/W2089815055,"Receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) α belongs to the large family of receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatases containing two tandem phosphatase domains. Most of the catalytic activity is retained in the first, membrane-proximal domain (RPTPα-D1), and little is known about the function of the second, membrane-distal domain (RPTPα-D2). We investigated whether proteins bound to RPTPα using the two-hybrid system and found that the second domain of RPTPς interacted with the juxtamembrane domain of RPTPα. We confirmed this interaction by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Furthermore, RPTPα not only interacted with RPTPς-D2 but also with RPTPα-D2, LAR-D2, RPTPδ-D2, and RPTPμ-D2, members of various RPTP subfamilies, although with different affinities. In the yeast two-hybrid system and in glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays, we show that the RPTP-D2s interacted directly with the wedge structure of RPTPα-D1 that has been demonstrated to be involved in inactivation of the RPTPα-D1/RPTPα-D1 homodimer. The interaction was specific because the equivalent wedge structure in LAR was unable to interact with RPTPα-D2 or LAR-D2. In vivo,we show that other interaction sites exist as well, including the C terminus of RPTPα-D2. The observation that RPTPα, but not LAR, bound to multiple RPTP-D2s with varying affinities suggests a specific mechanism of cross-talk between RPTPs that may regulate their biological function.

Protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs)1 regulate the level of phosphotyrosine in cellular proteins issued from the action of protein-tyrosine kinase. The PTP family is composed of more than 100 different known members, but this number is constantly growing, and the last estimation is that there are 500 PTPs (1.Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). The PTP group is subdivided in two between the cytosolic and the receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatases (RPTP). The RPTPs are distinguished by their extracellular domains, which can be very large, containing domains such as fibronectin type III-like domains and Immunoglobulin-like repeats in the case of for instance LAR, or very short (e.g. RPTPε) and heavily glycosylated such as RPTPα (2.den Hertog J. Mech. Dev. 1999; 85: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 3.Van Vactor D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). RPTPα is a widely but dynamically expressed RPTP that dephosphorylates Tyr527 of c-Src in vitro and that increases c-Src kinase activity when overexpressed in vivo (4.den Hertog J. Pals C.E. Peppelenbosch M.P. Tertoolen L.G. de Laat S.W. Kruijer W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3789-3798Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 5.Zheng X.M. Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 336-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cells derived from RPTPα knock-out mice have reduced Src and Fyn activity, indicating that RPTPα activates Fyn as well as Src in vivo (6.Ponniah S. Wang D.Z. Lim K.L. Pallen C.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 535-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 7.Su J. Muranjan M. Sap J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 505-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). RPTPα is also involved in m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-dependent regulation of Kv1.2 channel activity. Presumably, RPTPα directly dephosphorylates Kv1.2, leading to desuppression of its K+channel activity (8.Tsai W. Morielli A.D. Cachero T.G. Peralta E.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). RPTPα is itself phosphorylated on Tyr789, a GRB2-SH2 consensus binding site. Both the SH2 and the C-terminal SH3 domain of GRB2 cooperate for tight binding to RPTPα. Although it is clear that RPTPα interacts with GRB2 in vivo, the function of the binding remains elusive because it is exclusive of Sos, another partner for the SH3 domain of GRB2 (9.den Hertog J. Tracy S. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3020-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 10.den Hertog J. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3016-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 11.Su J.

Although it is now established that receptor protein-tyrosine kinases are activated by ligand induced dimerization, little is known about the regulation of RPTPs. One of the few examples of modulation of RPTP activity is activation of RPTPα by serine phosphorylation in response to phorbol ester-mediated activation of protein kinase C (13.den Hertog J. Sap J. Pals C.E. Schlessinger J. Kruijer W. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 303-307PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Tracy S. van der Geer P. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10587-10594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although ligands have been found for some RPTPs that induced cellular changes, neither changes in activity of the RPTPs nor changes in phosphorylation state of a direct substrate were reported (15.Burden-Gulley S.M. Brady-Kalnay S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1323-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 16.O'Grady P. Thai T.C. Saito H. J.

Increasing structural (18.Bilwes A.M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and functional (19.Desai D.M. Sap J. Schlessinger J.

In the RPTPα dimer, a helix-loop-helix so-called “wedge” structure interacted directly with and occluded the catalytic site of the opposing monomer. The inhibition is reciprocal in that the wedge of the second monomer interacts with the catalytic site of the first monomer (18.Bilwes A.M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Mutations that destabilized the wedge structure abolished the inactivation (20.Jiang G. den Hertog J. Su J. Noel J. Sap J.

Furthermore, we have used fluorescence resonance energy transfer between RPTPα fusion proteins, fused to two derivatives of green fluorescent protein mutants, cyan and yellow fluorescent protein to show that RPTPα formed homodimers in living cells. 2L. G. J. Tertoolen, C. Blanchetot, G. Jiang, J. Overvoorde, T. W. J. Gadella, Jr., T. Hunter, and J. den Hertog, submitted. All these results indicate that RPTPs, as opposed to the receptor protein-tyrosine kinases, would be inactivated by dimerization in which a key component of the inactivation is the interaction between the wedge of one monomer and the catalytic site of the other monomer in RPTP-D1 dimers. However, dimerization may not be a general regulatory mechanism because the crystal structures of RPTPμ-D1 (22.Hoffmann K.M.V. Tonks N.K. Barford D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27505-27508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and of the tandem phosphatase domains of RPTP LAR (23.Nam H.J. Poy F. Krueger N.X. Saito H. Frederick C.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) did not show dimers despite the presence of wedges in both structures. A striking feature of the RPTPs is the high conservation of a second PTP domain, distal to the membrane (D2), that contains no or very low catalytic activity. The second domains of LAR (23.Nam H.J. Poy F. Krueger N.X. Saito H. Frederick C.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and RPTPα 3A. Bilwes and J. Noel, personal communication. have the conserved PTP structure. For both RPTPs, the lack of activity in D2 resides in two amino acids that are highly conserved in active PTPs but not in RPTP-D2s: the Tyr in the KNRY motif and the Asp in the WPD loop. PTP activity was restored in D2 by mutating these key residues into their wild type D1 counterpart (23.Nam H.J. Poy F. Krueger N.X. Saito H. Frederick C.A. Cell. 1999; 97: 449-457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 24.Buist A. Zhang Y.L. Keng Y.F. Wu L. Zhang Z.Y. den Hertog J.

The conservation of an inactive PTP domain (D2) in the RPTP family raised questions about the biological function of D2. We used the yeast two-hybrid system to screen for proteins that interacted with RPTPα, in search of possible effector proteins of RPTPα. We found that the D2 of RPTPς interacted with RPTPα. The observation was extended to other D2s, including RPTPα-D2, LAR-D2, RPTPδ-D2, and RPTPμ-D2 in vitro and in vivo. Using the two-hybrid system as well as GST pull-downs, we show for the first time that the wedge in RPTPα-D1, but not the equivalent wedge of LAR-D1, is involved in the interaction with D2s, indicating that these interactions are specific. In vivo binding of RPTPα to RPTP-D2s was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, the affinity of binding between RPTPα and the different D2s appeared to be in the following order: RPTPδ-D2 > RPTPς-D2/LAR-D2 > RPTPα-D2/RPTPμ-D2. Our results suggest a role for RPTP-D2s in the regulation of RPTPα because the wedge is involved in the interaction between RPTPα-D1 and RPTPα-D1 as well as between RPTPα-D1 and RPTP-D2s. Furthermore, our results suggest cross-talk between different nonrelated RPTPs that might regulate their biological function. Polymerase chain reaction fragments encompassing different RPTP domains were cloned in pGBT8 or pGAD for the two-hybrid binding assay, in pCS2+MT to make Myc-tagged fusion protein, or in pGEX-KG to make GST fusion proteins. The different RPTP domains encompassed the following residues: the juxtamembrane domain of mRPTPα (aa 175–240, numbering according to Sap et al.(26.Sap J. D'Eustachio P. Givol D. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6112-6116Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar)), or hLAR (aa 1278–1358, accession number Y00815); the first domain of mRPTPα (aa 202–501); the second domain of mRPTPα (aa 537–793), mRPTPς (aa 1648–1904, accession number D28530), hLAR (aa 1642–1897), hRPTPμ (aa 1200–1452, accession number X58288), mRPTPδ (aa 1037–1292, accession number D13903), or the PTP domain of zfPTP1B (aa 1–302) (27.van der Sar A.M. de Fockert J. Betist M. Zivkovic D. den Hertog J. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 43: 785-794PubMed Google Scholar). Point mutations and deletions were made by site-directed mutagenesis and verified by sequencing. pCS2+MT-RPTPα-D2ΔC-t was made by cloning of anNcoI-EcoRI fragment in pCS2+ thus deleting residues 774–792 and the endogenous stop codon, which led to replacement of the RPTPα sequence by some vector sequence, leaving the overall size of the protein the same. For the library screening, the reporter strain YGH-1 transformed with pGBT8-RPTPα-JXT was retransformed as described (28.Spaargaren M. Bischoff J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12609-12613Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) with a reamplified mouse brain cDNA library cloned in pGAD and plated on synthetic medium lacking leucine, tryptophane, and histidine (SC−LTH). The number of transformants was approximately 1 × 107. After 4 days 150 colonies were recovered after selection and replated on new SC−LTH plates for analysis of β-galactosidase activity, using a filter lift assay. The plasmid DNA from the His and 32 β-galactosidase positives colonies was isolated from liquid cultures, transformed into bacteria, and retested in yeast for specificity. For interaction assays, 3 μg of relevant plasmids and 40 μg of carrier DNA were introduced in yeast using the lithium-acetate protocol and plated on medium lacking leucine and tryptophane (SC−LT) or SC−LTH. After 3–4 days, independent colonies from both kind of plate (SC−LT and SC−LTH), were replated and tested for β-galactosidase activity using a filter lift assay. 293 and COS cells were routinely grown in DF medium (a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's minimum essential medium and Ham's F12 medium) supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected using the standard calcium-phosphate method (10.den Hertog J. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3016-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10-cm dishes were transfected with a total of 20 μg of DNA. The next day, the medium was refreshed and left another 16 h before harvesting. Subconfluent transfected cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with cell lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors, including benzamidine, aprotinin, and leupeptin) for 20 min on ice, harvested, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min to remove the insoluble fraction. The supernatant was added to 12CA5 antibodies that had been covalently linked to protein A-Sepharose beads, using dimethylpimelimidate. After 2 h of incubation, the beads were washed four times with HNTG buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol), mixed with 2× Laemmli buffer and loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane using a semidry transfer system. After Coomassie staining, the membrane was blocked for 1 h with 5% milk in TBS-Tween (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20) at room temperature, incubated with the first antibody for 1.5 h, washed four times with TBS-Tween, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti mouse antibody (Transduction Laboratories) for 1 h, washed with TBS-Tween, and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence. All the constructs in pGEX-KG were transformed into BL21 bacteria. GST fusion proteins were purified essentially as described (29.Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). Briefly, fresh colonies were allowed to grow until they reached an optical density of 0.6–0.8 and were then diluted 10 times. After 1 h, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added up to 100 μm to induce synthesis of the fusion proteins overnight at 28–30 °C. The cells were lysed by addition of lysozyme and further by sonication in TBS (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) containing Triton X-100 (1%) and protease inhibitors at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 14,000 ×g, the GST fusion proteins were collected using Sepharose-GSH beads and eluted with 10 mm reduced glutatione in TBS. The supernatant containing pure GST fusion protein was further dialyzed against a solution of TBS containing 10% glycerol. To find proteins interacting with RPTPα we used the yeast two-hybrid system. Different fragments of RPTPα containing the full intracellular domain or the individual PTP domains fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain were used to screen a mouse brain cDNA library as well as an 11.5-day-old mouse embryo cDNA library without success. The presence of RPTPα-D1 appeared to be detrimental in the two-hybrid system. Possibly, the PTP activity of RPTPα was toxic to the yeast or RPTPα-D1 homodimerization inhibited further binding of proteins. The juxtamembrane domain of RPTPα (RPTPα-JXT, aa 175–240, encompassing the region just C-terminal to the transmembrane domain and a small part of RPTPα-D1) was used to screen a mouse brain cDNA library. Three clones out of 107transformants were found to bind strongly and specifically to RPTPα and were sequenced. All three clones were identical and encoded the second domain of RPTPς-D2. To investigate whether other RPTP-D2s might interact with the juxtamembrane domain of RPTPα as well, we generated a construct of the GAL4 activation domain fused to RPTPα-D2 and found that RPTPα-D2, like RPTPς-D2, interacted with the juxtamembrane domain of RPTPα (TableI). To validate the latter interaction, the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and GAL4 activation domain were switched, and again, a strong interaction was detected suggesting a specific interaction (Table I). To further investigate the interaction of RPTPα with other RPTP-D2s, we introduced LAR-D2, RPTPδ-D2, and RPTPμ-D2 in the two-hybrid vectors and tested for specific interaction with RPTPα-JXT. As depicted in Table I, all D2s that we tested interacted with the juxtamembrane domain of RPTPα, with RPTPδ-D2 apparently binding better. The interactions were not nonspecific because the RPTP-D2s did not interact with the empty vectors nor with each other. In conclusion, we show that the juxtamembrane domain of RPTPα interacted specifically with many RPTP-D2s in the two-hybrid system.Table IBinding of RPTPD2s to the juxtamembrane domain of RPTPα in the yeast two-hybrid systemGAL4 DNA-binding domainGAL4 activation domain−RPTPς-D2RPTPα-D2RPTPα-JXTRPTPα-JXT−++++−RPTPα-D2−−−++LAR-D2−−−++RPTPδ-D2−−−+++RPTPμ-D2−−−++Fragments of RPTPs were fused to the GAL4 activation domain in the PGAD vector and cotransfected in YGH-1 yeast with different fragments of RPTPs, fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in PGBT8 as indicated.

The RPTP domains used are the juxtamembrane domain of RPTPα (RPTPα-JXT) and the membrane-distal domain (D2) of RPTPς, RPTPα, LAR, RPTPδ, and RPTPμ. The interactions were scored as positive (++), strongly positive (+++), or negative (−) based on the yeast growth on medium lacking histidine and β-galactosidase expression. The juxtamembrane domain of RPTPα that was used in the two-hybrid system contains the helix-loop-helix, so-called wedge, structure that interacted with the other monomer in the RPTPα-D1 homodimers of the crystal structure (18.Bilwes A.M. den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structure, we speculated that the wedge would also be important for the interaction between RPTPα-D1 and RPTP-D2s. We assessed which residues in the juxtamembrane domain of RPTPα were responsible for the interaction with D2s and substituted residues in the wedge that form contacts in the crystal structure with the other monomer with Ala. Single amino acid substitutions in the wedge, K230A or E234A, were sufficient to abolish binding in the yeast two-hybrid system, demonstrating that the wedge is important for the interaction (TableII). Moreover, the RPTP-D2s bound specifically to RPTPα-JXT, because none of the RPTP-D2s tested bound to the equivalent juxtamembrane domain of LAR, indicating an intrinsic difference between these two RPTPs (TableIII). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the juxtamembrane domain of RPTPα, but not of LAR, specifically bound to RPTP-D2s and that the interactions were dependent on the wedge.Table IIBinding of RPTPα-D2 to the juxtamembrane domain of RPTPα is dependent on the wedgeGAL4 DNA-binding domainGAL4 activation domain−RPTPα-D2RPTPα-JXT−++RPTPα-JXT-K230A−−RPTPα-JXT-E234A−−YGH-1 yeast were cotransfected with pGBT8 (GAL4 DNA-binding domain) RPTPα-JXT without or with a mutation in the wedge structure (RPTPα-JXT-K230A or RPTPα-JXT-E234A) and with pGAD vector (GAL4 activation domain) alone (−) or containing RPTPα-D2.

The interactions were scored as in Table I: positive (++) or negative (−) based on the yeast growth on medium lacking histidine and β-galactosidase expression. The interaction of RPTPα-D1 (containing the wedge) with RPTPα-D2 was investigated in a GST pull-down assay. Bacterially expressed GST-RPTPα-D2 was incubated with lysate of cells transfected with a Myc-tagged juxtamembrane domain of RPTPα (wild type), and binding proteins were detected by immuno-blotting. GST-RPTPα-D2, but not GST, bound MtRPTPα-JXT (Fig.1 A). In accordance with the yeast two-hybrid experiments (Table II), mutation of Lys230in the wedge (K/A) abolished binding (Fig. 1 A). In a more relevant context, a Myc-tagged RPTPα-D1 (Mtα-D1, aa 202–501), containing part of the juxtamembrane region and the wedge as well as a complete first domain, was pulled down by bacterially purified GST-RPTPα-D2 but not by GST alone (Fig. 1 B). Reciprocally, Myc-tagged RPTPα-D2 (Mt-αD2) was pulled down by GST-RPTPα-D1, but not by mutant GST-RPTPα-D1 containing mutations in the wedge, GST-RPTPα-D1K230A (Fig. 1 C), or GST-RPTPα-D1E234A (data not shown). As a control, binding of Mt-αD2 to GST-RPTPα-D2 was assessed, and we found that RPTPα-D2 did not homodimerize (Fig.1 C). In conclusion, the GST pull-down assays reproduced the two-hybrid experiments clearly. RPTPα-D1 interacted with RPTPα-D2, and the integrity of the wedge was required for the interaction. We further investigated the interaction detected in the two-hybrid system and in GST pull-downs between RPTPα and different RPTP-D2s in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation. 293 cells were cotransfected with full-length HA-RPTPα and MtRPTPα-D2. MtRPTPα-D2 only coimmunoprecipitated with HA-RPTPα, and no MtRPTPα-D2 was detected when HA-RPTPα was not cotransfected (Fig.2, left and middle lanes). Interestingly, full-length HA-RPTPα was a less potent partner for MtRPTPα-D2 than HA-RPTPα-ΔD2, a construct lacking RPTPα-D2, although both constructs were expressed equally (Fig. 2,middle and right lanes). These results suggest that endogenous RPTPα-D2 and cytosolic MtRPTPα-D2 may compete for the same site in RPTPα-D1 in vivo because less MtRPTPα-D2 bound when endogenous RPTPα-D2 was present. We next investigated in vivo binding of RPTPα to other RPTP-D2s. All the Myc-tagged versions of the RPTP-D2s used in the two-hybrid system coimmunoprecipitated with RPTPα (Fig.3). Furthermore, the increase in binding to RPTPα-ΔD2, as compared with full-length HA-RPTPα, was observed with Myc-tagged LAR-D2, RPTPς-D2, and RPTPμ-D2 (Fig. 3), as well as RPTPδ-D2 (data not shown), which might indicate a similar way of interaction between RPTPα and the different RPTP-D2s. The binding was specific for RPTP-D2s because Myc-tagged PTP1B, a cytosolic protein-tyrosine phosphatase, was not able to bind to full-length HA-RPTPα nor to HA-RPTPα-ΔD2 (Fig. 3 B). As expected from the two-hybrid experiments, although difficult to see in Fig. 3, the binding affinities were not the same for all RPTP-D2s. As depicted clearly in Fig. 4, RPTPδ-D2 bound much better to RPTPα than RPTPα-D2, whereas LAR-D2 bound intermediately. From several independent experiments, we deduced that the affinity of RPTPα for in vivo binding to RPTP-D2s was RPTPδ-D2 > LAR-D2/RPTPς-D2 > RPTPα-D2/RPTPμ-D2. In conclusion, we show that RPTPα interacts with RPTP-D2s from various RPTP subfamilies in living cells with different affinities.Figure 3Binding of different RPTP-D2s to RPTP α in vivo. HA-tagged RPTPα full-length (HA-RPTPα) or a deletion mutant (RPTPα-ΔD2) was transiently cotransfected in 293 cells with different Myc-tagged RPTP-D2s (RPTPα-D2, RPTPς-D2, LAR-D2, or RPTPμ-D2) or as a control Myc-tagged zfPTP1B (B).

Relatively similar amounts of MtRPTPα-D2 coimmunoprecipitated with HA-RPTPα or with the single mutants E227A, K230A, E231A, or E234A (data not shown). Similarly, single mutations in the wedge of HA-RPTPα-ΔD2 had no effect on MtRPTP-αD2 binding (data not shown). However, single mutations might be too subtle to induce changes in in vivo binding. Therefore, we deleted the wedge completely from residues 207 to 238. This deletion was based on the crystal structure to minimize any possible conformational perturbation of the PTP domain. In the HA-RPTPα-ΔD2 context, complete deletion of the wedge (HA-RPTPα-ΔD2Δ207/238) led to a reproducible reduction in binding but not a complete loss (Fig. 5,second and"

In this study, we report the identification of two previously uncharacterized genes,PSR1 and PSR2, that perform an essential function under conditions of sodium ion stress in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae. Psr1p and Psr2p are highly homologous and were identified through their homology with the endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein Nem1p. Localization and biochemical fractionation studies show that Psr1p is associated with the plasma membrane via a short amino-terminal sequence also present in Psr2p. Growth of the psr1psr2 mutant is severely inhibited under conditions of sodium but not potassium ion or sorbitol stress. This growth defect is due to the inability of the psr1psr2mutant to properly induce transcription of ENA1/PMR2, the major sodium extrusion pump of yeast cells. We provide genetic evidence that this regulation is independent of the phosphatase calcineurin, previously implicated in the sodium stress response in yeast. We show that Psr1p contains a DXDX(T/V) phosphatase motif essential for its function in vivo and that a Psr1p-PtA fusion purified from yeast extracts exhibits phosphatase activity.

Because of the knowledge of its sequenced genome and the availability of powerful genetic approaches, budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiaehas been a particularly valuable model system for studying such responses. Of particular significance for this unicellular eukaryote is the response to changes in osmolarity of the medium. Yeast cells are able to detect and respond to changes in osmolarity by two independent osmosensors, Sln1p and Sho1p (1.Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, 2.Ota I.M. Varshavsky A. Science. 1993; 262: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). These membrane-bound proteins activate the so-called high osmolarity glycerol (HOG)1 mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade (1.Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar, 3.Posas F. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Maeda T. Witten E.A. Thai T.C. Saito H. Cell. 1996; 86: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), which in turn mediates the transcriptional activation of several genes required for adaptation to high osmolarity mostly through the stress response elements. These include several general osmotic stress genes, like GPD1(glycerol-phosphate dehydrogenase) required for prevention of water loss, heat shock proteins like HSP12, or CTT1(cytosolic catalase) among others (4.Albertyn J. Hohmann S. Thevelein J.M. Prior B.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4135-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 5.Varela J.C. Praekelt U.M. Meacock P.A. Planta R.J. Mager W.H. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4382-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The HOG pathway is also responsible for transmitting stress signals emerging from high concentrations of certain ions, such as lithium or sodium (7.Marquez J.A. Serrano R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). High salinity media can be toxic for yeast cells because they lead to loss of turgor pressure and block several metabolic reactions. In this case, an essential event required for the survival of yeast cells is the transcriptional activation of theENA1/PMR2 gene. ENA1/PMR2 encodes for a P-type ATPase required for the efflux of sodium ions (8.Rudolph H.K. Antebi A. Fink G.R. Buckley C.M. Dorman T.E. LeVitre J. Davidow L.S. Mao J.I. Moir D.T.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Although yeast cells contain a tandem array of nearly identical genes encoding ion pumps involved in sodium tolerance, only the first of them,ENA1/PMR2, is strongly induced and therefore required during sodium ion stress (10.Wieland J. Nitsche A.M. Strayle J. Steiner H. Rudolph H.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3870-3882Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Apart from the HOG-dependent induction during sodium ion stress, PMR2 transcription is also induced by another independent pathway mediated by the calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (11.Nakamura T. Liu Y. Hirata D. Namba H. Harada S. Hirokawa T. Miyakawa T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4063-4071Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar,12.Mendoza I. Rubio F. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Pardo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8792-8796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calcineurin function is exerted through the dephosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation of the transcription factor Crz1p (13.Stathopoulos A.M. Cyert M.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3432-3444Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar,14.Stathopoulos-Gerontides A. Guo J.J. Cyert M.S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 798-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Finally, basal and sodium induced levels of PMR2 can be regulated by the Ser/Thr phosphatase Ppz1p and its regulatory subunitHAL3 (15.Posas F. Camps M. Arino J. J. Biol.

In the present work, we show that two previously uncharacterized plasma membrane proteins, Psr1p and Psr2p, are essential for an efficient sodium ion stress response through transcriptional activation of the major sodium extrusion pump of yeast cells, PMR2. Our data suggest that Psr1p/Psr2p regulate PMR2 transcription through a pathway that is independent of the one mediated by calcineurin. Psr1p and Psr2p contain a DXDX(T/V) motif within their conserved COOH-terminal domain that has been recently identified in several phosphohydrolases and in Fcp1p, the essential phosphatase of RNA polymerase II (19.Collet J.F.

We demonstrate here that the DXDX(T/V) motif of Psr1p is essential for its function in sodium stress response and that native Psr1p exhibits phosphatase activity in vitro. Finally we suggest that the function of the Psr1p/Nem1p homology domain may not be restricted to the DXDX(T/V) motif-dependent phosphatase activity.

Thepsr1::HIS3 and psr2::TRP1alleles, each containing 5′ and 3′ noncoding flanking regions required for homologous recombination, were transformed into a haploid RS453 wild type strain. In both cases, correct integration of the disrupted gene copy at the homologous gene locus was verified by PCR analysis. To construct the psr1 psr2 double deletion mutant, apsr1::HIS3 strain carrying the p-URA3-PSR1 plasmid was transformed with apsr2::TRP1 allele. Correct transformants grew as wild type on plates containing 5-fluoro-orotic acid, showing that thepsr1 psr2 mutant does not exhibit any growth defects at standard growth conditions. 8 μl of serial dilutions of saturated yeast cultures were spotted onto the indicated medium (YPD or YPD containing 1 m sorbitol, 1 m NaCl, 1m KCl and containing, where indicated, 1 μg/ml FK506). Plates were incubated at 30 °C, for 2 (YPD medium) or 5 (YPD containing 1 m NaCl) days. To epitope-tag PSR1, a unique BamHI site was introduced just before the stop codon by PCR ( … ATA GGA TCC TAA … ). A BamHI fragment encoding either two IgG binding domains from Staphylococcus aureus protein A (380 base pairs) or the S65T/V163A variant of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) (720 base pairs) was inserted in frame into theBamHI site generated at the stop codon of PSR1. All fusion proteins were expressed under the control of thePSR1 promoter from centromeric vectors (YCplac111-LEU2-PSR1-PtA, YCplac111-LEU2-PSR1-GFP) or 2μ vectors (YEplac181-LEU2-PSR1-GFP, YEplac181-LEU2-PSR1-PtA). PtA and GFP fusion proteins were functional because they could complement the growth defect of psr1psr2 cells in medium supplemented with 1m NaCl (not shown). To construct a fusion protein between the 28 amino-terminal residues ofPSR1 and GFP, two PCR fragments, one coding for the promoter and the 28 NH2-terminal residues of Psr1p (M (1.Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar) to S (28.McCabe J.B. Berthiaume L.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3771-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar)) followed by a BamHI site and a second one coding for aBamHI site followed by the PSR1 stop codon and its 3′-untranslated region, were digested withSphI/BamHI and BamHI/EcoRI, respectively, and ligated into aSphI/EcoRI-digested YCplac111 vector. ABamHI GFP fragment was inserted in-frame at the uniqueBamHI site preceding the PSR1 stop codon. To construct the D263E and D265E mutants of Psr1p, a silent mutation inserting a unique XbaI site in the codon preceding the two aspartic acids at positions 263 and 265 (underlined) of PSR1 was generated ( … ATT CTA GAC CTGGAT GAA … ). Oligonucleotide primers containing the D263E ( … ATT CTA GAA CTG GAT GAA … ) or the D265E ( … ATT CTAGAC CTG GAA GAA … ) mutations were used to amplify the region corresponding to the COOH terminus of PSR1, with a reverse primer introducing a BamHI site just before the stop codon (see above). XbaI/BamHI-digested PCR fragments were ligated into a XbaI/BamHI-cut YEplac181-LEU2 vector carrying the PSR1 gene with the BamHI site before the stop codon. For the deletion of the conserved COOH-terminal domain of Psr1p, two PCR fragments, one coding for the promoter and amino-terminal portion of Psr1p until Glu226 followed by aBamHI site and a second one coding for a BamHI site followed by the PSR1 stop codon and its 3′-untranslated region, were digested with SphI/BamHI andBamHI/EcoRI, respectively, and ligated into aSphI/EcoRI-digested YEplac181 vector. In all cases, the protein A tag was inserted in frame at the uniqueBamHI site preceding the PSR1 stop codon. To construct the G2A and the C9G,C10G mutants of Psr1p, a silent mutation inserting a EcoRI site 16 codons downstream of the ATG was generated ( … TCG AAT TCC … ). Oligonucleotide reverse primers containing the G2A ( … GAAAGC CAT … ) or the C9G,C10G ( … AGA GCC GCC CAG … ) mutations and a forward primer priming 600 nucleotides upstream of the ATG were used to amplify the promoter and the 19 amino-terminal residues of PSR1. A second PCR product was generated with a forward primer introducing the EcoRI site and a reverse oligo priming 700 nucleotides downstream of the ATG. The two PCR fragments were digested, respectively, bySphI/EcoRI and EcoRI/PstI and ligated into a Ycplac111-PSR1-PtA construct. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. For affinity purification of the Psr1p-PtA fusions, yeast strains expressing the corresponding PtA fusion proteins (TableI) were grown and spheroplasted as described previously (26.Siniossoglou S. Santos-Rosa H. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6449-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). 1 g of frozen spheroplast pellet was lysed in 22 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (150 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The extract was centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 rpm (SS-34 rotor, Sorvall), and the supernatant was first precleared by incubation with Sepharose Fast flow beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then loaded onto a column packed with 100 μl IgG-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was washed with 40 ml of lysis buffer, 8 ml of wash buffer (1 m NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2) and finally with 10 ml of phosphatase buffer (10 mm KOAc, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol). The beads were then transferred to a 1-ml Mobicol column (MoBiTec) and washed for 15 min with 1 ml of phosphatase buffer at 30 °C. 30 μl of beads were then incubated with 200 μl of phosphatase buffer containing 10 mg/mlp-nitrophenylphosphate (Sigma) for 30 min at 30 °C. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation, and its absorbance was measured at 410 nm. To determine whether Psr1p is a membrane associated protein, spheroplasts were prepared from early log phase cultures of a PSR1-PtA (CEN) strain (Table I). 1 g of spheroplasts was lysed with a Dounce homogenizer in 16 ml of extraction buffer (150 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2) and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C with a Beckman TLA 120.2 rotor. The insoluble pellet was resuspended either in 16 ml of extraction buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 or 1 m NaCl or in 16 ml of 0.1m sodium carbonate, pH 11.5. Extracts were incubated for 15 min on ice and then separated into a soluble and pellet fraction by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Equivalent amounts from all fractions were dissolved in SDS sample buffer, heated at 95 °C for 3 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-PtA (1:3000, DAKO) or anti-Dpm1p (1:1000, Molecular Probes) antibodies. Lysis of the protein A-tagged G2A and C9G,C10G mutants of PSR1 was performed as described above, except that extracts were centrifuged at 70,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis were performed according to Ref. 21.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar. All extractions were performed at 4 °C in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For β-galactosidase assays, cells growing in synthetic medium were diluted into YPD with or without 1 m NaCl and grown for 6 h at 30 °C. 0.5A 600 of cells were spun down, permeabilized with chloroform and SDS, and glass-bead lysed. 10 μl of the extracts were assayed as described previously (27.Reynolds A. Lundblad V. Dorris D. Keaveney M. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 13.6.1-13.6.6Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activities were normalized to the protein concentration of each sample as measured using the Bio-Rad Bradford kit. Absolute values of β-galactosidase activity varied depending on the culture density. In each experiment, cells were grown to equivalent densities. Psr1p and Psr2p belong to a large family of uncharacterized proteins from different species that share a high degree of homology in a domain of 200 amino acid residues. This family includes Nem1p, an ER membrane protein which is required for nuclear/ER membrane morphogenesis in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae (26.Siniossoglou S. Santos-Rosa H. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6449-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). BLAST searches with Nem1p identified three uncharacterized yeast genes corresponding to open reading frames YLL010c, YLR019w, and YPL063w that share 36% identity over their entire 200-residue-long COOH termini with the corresponding domain of Nem1p. Interestingly, YLL010c and YLR019w are closely related to each other, and each contains a putative lipid attachment sequence at the NH2 terminus, suggesting that, like Nem1p, they are also membrane associated (Fig.1). To gain further insight into the function of the Nem1p family of proteins, we analyzed this pair of genes, designated PSR1 (YLL010c) and PSR2(YLR019w; see below) in more detail. PSR1 and PSR2 encode acidic proteins of 427 (predicted molecular mass, 47.9 kDa; pI, 4.9) and 397 (molecular mass, 44.7 kDa; pI, 4.6) amino acid residues, respectively. Alignment of the two sequences shows that the proteins are almost identical over their conserved COOH-terminal portions (83% identity, 89% similarity) and more distantly related over their respective amino-terminal halfs (29% identity and 45% similarity over their 175 NH2-terminal residues) (Fig. 1 B). To determine its subcellular localization, Psr1p was tagged with the GFP in its COOH terminus. The fusion protein, expressed under the control of the authentic PSR1 promoter was functional (see below). When psr1 cells expressing the Psr1p-GFP fusion were observed in the fluorescence microscope, a clear and distinct plasma membrane labeling was seen (Fig. 2). No intracellular staining was detected, suggesting that under steady state conditions Psr1p localizes mostly to the plasma membrane. Hydropathy plot analysis indicated that, unlike their ER-related counterpart Nem1p, Psr1p and Psr2p do not contain any putative membrane-spanning sequence (Fig.3 A). However, the 12 very amino-terminal residues of both Psr1p and Psr2p exhibit a high value of hydrophobicity on Kyte-Doolittle plots. Interestingly, this short stretch, which is highly conserved in both proteins, contains a glycine immediately after the starting methionine and two cysteines in positions 9 and 10, suggesting that Psr1p and Psr2p might be target of a lipid modification, possibly myristoylation, and/or palmitoylation. To further investigate how Psr1p is associated with the plasma membrane, we used a strain expressing a Psr1p-Protein A (Psr1p-PtA) fusion from a centromeric plasmid under the control of thePSR1 promoter (see “Experimental Procedures”). When spheroplasts from cells expressing Psr1p-PtA were lysed in a buffer lacking detergent, the Psr1p fusion was found mostly in the insoluble pellet (P100). Further fractionation of this insoluble Psr1p-PtA pool demonstrated that it can be efficiently solubilized in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 but not in 1 m NaCl (Fig. 3 B) or 0.1 m carbonate, pH 11.5 (not shown). Very similar behavior was exhibited by the membrane protein Dpm1p (Fig.3 B). Therefore, although lacking a typical transmembrane domain sequence, Psr1p behaves as an integral membrane protein. Interestingly, a minor amount of a faster migrating Psr1p-PtA species (probably a breakdown product) appears to be enriched in the soluble fraction (Fig. 3 B). To directly test whether the conserved NH2 terminus of Psr1p mediates its membrane binding, we constructed two mutants, PSR1-G2A and PSR1-C9G,C10G, where the residues that could mediate the covalent attachment of myristoyl- and palmitoyl-groups, respectively, have been mutated. As seen in Fig. 3 C, the G2A mutation does not affect the membrane association of Psr1p because, in the absence of detergent, most of the mutant protein is still found in the pellet. However, the two cysteines at positions 9 and 10 are essential for the membrane binding of Psr1p, because the C9G,C10G mutant is found almost exclusively in the soluble fraction (Fig. 3 C). This result strongly suggests that palmitoylation of cysteines 9 and 10 is responsible for the plasma membrane association Psr1p. Because lipid-modified sequences have been shown often to target proteins to the plasma membrane (28.McCabe J.B. Berthiaume L.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3771-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), the first 28 residues of Psr1p were fused to GFP and expressed in yeast. Indeed, we found that it was localized to the plasma membrane in a way that is indistinguishable to that of the full-length Psr1p-GFP (compare plasma membrane staining in Figs. 2 and 3 D). We therefore conclude that Psr1p is targeted to and associated with the plasma membrane via a conserved amino-terminal sequence that is also present in Psr2p. The complex migration of Psr1p-PtA on SDS-PAGE suggests that, apart from the lipid attachment, Psr1p may be target of additional post-translational modifications. Indeed, Psr1p appears to be phosphorylated in its NH2-terminal portion, because when affinity-purified Psr1p-PtA is treated with alkaline phosphatase, the doublet of each one of the two Psr1p forms along with its smeary appearance disappears and instead, a single low and high molecular mass form appear (Fig. 3 E). Since the Psr1ΔCp-PtA mutant exhibits a similar shift in its molecular mass forms, at least some of the putative phosphorylation site(s) must be located within the NH2-terminal half of the protein. To investigate the function of Psr1p and Pr2p, we deleted the PSR1 and PSR2 genes. Cells lacking either gene alone were viable and able to grow normally at both 16 and 37 °C (data not shown). Because the two proteins exhibit such a high homology over their COOH-terminal domains, cells in which both genes were deleted were also generated. Although no growth defects were observed under standard medium, the growth of the double, but not single, mutant was severely inhibited in medium containing 1m NaCl (Fig. 4) or 0.3m LiCl (data not shown). This phenotype did not appear to be due to a general osmotic defect, as, unlike the bona fideosmosensitive mutant hog1, no growth inhibition was observed when the psr1psr2 mutant was grown in the presence of 1m sorbitol or 1 m KCl (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the psr1psr2 mutant grew as wild type on plates containing 0.4 m CaCl2, 0.5 mg/ml calcofluor white, 5 mm caffeine, or 20 μg/ml geneticin (data not shown). To confirm the specificity of the growth defect on high salinity medium, a single psr1psr2 double deletion mutant was transformed either with two empty centromeric vectors or with the same vectors carrying PSR1, PSR2, or both genes. Cells lacking any of the PSR genes did not grow on YPD plates containing 1m NaCl, whereas PSR1 or PSR2 cells did (not shown). Based on these data, we conclude that Psr1p and Psr2p perform a redundant function that is essential under conditions of sodium ion stress. We therefore named the corresponding genesPSR1 and PSR2 (for plasma membranesodium response 1 and2). Because many mutants with a primary defect in secretion and/or cytoskeletal organization are also osmotically sensitive and because Nem1p, the only characterized member of the Psr family, shows severe defects in the nuclear/ER membrane organization (26.Siniossoglou S. Santos-Rosa H. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6449-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), we first analyzed whether the psr1psr2 mutant exhibits other defects that could indirectly cause sodium sensitivity. The morphology of the psr1psr2 mutant was indistinguishable from that of the isogenic wild type control when observed at the ultrastructural level by thin section electron microscopy (data not shown). Furthermore, the psr1psr2 mutant does not show any defect in cell wall integrity (calcofluor staining), actin cytoskeleton (phalloidin staining), or endocytosis (uptake of FM4–64) (data not shown). These data suggest that the psr1psr2 mutant might be specifically involved in a sodium stress response pathway. Different signal transduction pathways responsible for adaptation of yeast to high sodium and lithium concentrations converge to the transcriptional activation of ENA1/PMR2, the major sodium/lithium extrusion pump of yeast cells. We therefore tested whether constitutive expression of PMR2 can rescue the growth defect of the psr1psr2 mutant during salt stress. Indeed, we found that overexpression of PMR2 from thePGK1 promoter suppresses the sodium-induced growth defect of the psr1psr2 mutant (Fig.5 A). These data suggest that the growth defect of the psr1psr2 mutant on high salinity medium is due to its inability to properly induce transcription ofPMR2. To address this possibility directly, we used a PMR2promoter-lacZ reporter (7.Marquez J.A. Serrano R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 24.Garciadeblas B. Rubio F. Quintero F.J. Banuelos M.A. Haro R. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) to follow PMR2 expression levels during sodium stress. The psr1psr2 mutant or the isogenic wild type control (PSR1PSR2) was transformed with the pmr2::LacZ reporter gene and grown in medium supplemented with 1 m NaCl for 6 h (Fig. 5 B). As previously reported, wild type cells that were challenged with 1m NaCl induced PMR2 expression. However, in thepsr1psr2 mutant, sodium-dependent induction of the pmr2::LacZ reporter"
https://openalex.org/W2024758879,"Uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) is an essential enzyme for maintaining genomic integrity. Here we describe a UDG from the extreme thermophile Archaeoglobus fulgidus. The enzyme is a member of a new class of enzymes found in prokaryotes that is distinct from the UDG enzyme found in Escherichia coli, eukaryotes, and DNA-containing viruses. The A. fulgidus UDG is extremely thermostable, maintaining full activity after heating for 1.5 h at 95 degrees C. The protein is capable of removing uracil from double-stranded DNA containing either a U/A or U/G base pair as well as from single-stranded DNA. This enzyme is product-inhibited by both uracil and apurinic/apyrimidinic sites. The A. fulgidus UDG has a high degree of similarity at the primary amino acid sequence level to the enzyme found in Thermotoga maritima, a thermophilic eubacteria, and suggests a conserved mechanism of UDG-initiated base excision repair in archaea and thermophilic eubacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2024835252,"CD38 is a bifunctional ectoenzyme predominantly expressed on hematopoietic cells where its expression correlates with differentiation and proliferation. The two enzyme activities displayed by CD38 are an ADP-ribosyl cyclase and a cyclic adenosine diphosphate ribose (cADPR) hydrolase that catalyzes the synthesis and hydrolysis of cADPR. T lymphocytes can be induced to express CD38 when activated with antibodies against specific antigen receptors. If the activated T cells are then exposed with NAD, cell death by apoptosis occurs. During the exposure of activated T cells to NAD, the CD38 is modified by ecto-mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases (ecto-mono-ADPRTs) specific for cysteine and arginine residues. Arginine-ADP-ribosylation results in inactivation of both cyclase and hydrolase activities of CD38, whereas cysteine-ADP-ribosylation results only in the inhibition of the hydrolase activity. The arginine-ADP-ribosylation causes a decrease in intracellular cADPR and a subsequent decrease in Ca2+influx, resulting in apoptosis of the activated T cells. Our results suggest that the interaction of two classes of ecto-ADP-ribose transfer enzymes plays an important role in immune regulation by the selective induction of apoptosis in activated T cells and that cADPR mediated signaling is essential for the survival of activated T cells.

Thus, this enzyme possesses both ADP-ribosyl cyclase and cADPR hydrolase, the net reaction of which is identical to that catalyzed by NADase. cADPR is a potent Ca2+ mobilizing agent believed to be involved in Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release in a variety of cells from plants to humans (7.Lee H.C.

Although the physiological ligand for CD38 has yet to be identified, CD38 was reported to undergo internalization through non-clathrin-coated endocytic vesicles upon incubating cells with thiol compounds or NAD (11.Zocchi E. Furano L. Guida L. Piccino D. Taccheti C. De Flora A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 369: 327-332Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which endocytic vesicles can generate cADPR was suggested by the demonstration that the CD38-catalyzed conversion of NAD to cADPR can be achieved by the influx of cytosolic NAD into the endocytic vesicles and the cADPR into the cytosol for subsequent Ca2+ signaling (12.Zocchi E.

Lymphocyte surface molecules are known to play an important regulatory role by modulation of their expression, binding activity, and/or signal transduction. The ecto-enzymes expressed on the lymphocyte surface also regulate the functions of lymphocytes. ADP-ribosylation of surface proteins on T cells by an ecto-mono-ADP-ribosyl transferase (ADPRT) results in the inhibition of cytotoxic T cell functions such as cell proliferation, cytotoxicity, and cytokine secretion (13.Wang J. Nemoto E. Kots A.Y. Kaslow H.R. Dennert G. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4048-4058PubMed Google Scholar), and the suppression of cytotoxic T cell function is closely correlated with the expression of the mono-ADPRT (14.Okamoto S. Azhipa O., Yu, Y. Russo E. Dennert G. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4190-4198PubMed Google Scholar). Most ecto-NADases are known to be inhibited in the presence of their substrate, NAD (15.Liberman I. J. Biol.

Recently, we described the NAD-dependent inactivation of 65-kDa NADase from rabbit erythrocytes by auto-ADP-ribosylation (17.Han M.-K. Lee J.-Y. Cho Y.-S. Song Y.-M. An N.-H. Kim H.-R. Kim U.-H. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the study described here, we have explored whether CD38 is also inactivated in the presence of NAD. Our results show that ADP-ribosylation of CD38 by mono-ADPRT in activated T cells results in apoptosis as well as CD38 inactivation, suggesting that ADP-ribosylation of CD38 plays an important role in immune regulation and that cADPR-mediated signaling is essential for the survival of activated T cells. A single cell suspension of splenocytes was prepared from normal Balb/c 6–8-week-old mice as described previously (18.Yim C.-Y. Hibbs J.B. McGregor J.R. Galinsky R.F. Samlowski W.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5796-5805PubMed Google Scholar). The T cells were purified by negative selection using goat anti-mouse IgG-coated Immulan beads (Biotecx Laboratories). The T cells were activated by incubation for 12 h with anti-CD3 antibody (1 μg/ml; Chemicon) and interleukin-2 (100 units/ml; Perkin-Elmer Cetus). B cells were prepared by eluting cells which were bound to goat anti-mouse IgG-coated Immulan beads. Activated T cells were harvested at the indicated times and washed with Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) (2 mm CaCl2, 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mmd-glucose, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3). ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity was measured by fluorometric assay with nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide as a substrate (19.Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Fryxell K. Branton W.D. Lee H.C. J. Biol.

Activated T cells were washed with HBSS and incubated with 10 μm[adenylate-32P]NAD. The cells were lysed on ice in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 15% glycerol, and 5 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin (10 μg ml−1), pepstatin (10 μg/ml), and leupeptin (10 μg/ml)) and the postnuclear fractions were prepared by spinning the lysates at 13,000 × g for 10 min. CD38 was immunoprecipitated from 2 × 106 cell equivalents using anti-CD38 antibody (5 μg, Pharmingen). Subsequently, the immune complexes were collected by the addition of anti-rat IgG-agarose (Sigma), fractionated by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide), and subjected to autoradiography. To identify the ADP-ribosylated amino acid residues in CD38, [32P]ADP-ribosylated CD38 was separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride filter. The filter was incubated in water, 1 m neutralized NH2OH, or 10 mm HgCl2 at 45 °C for 3 h and subjected to autoradiography (17.Han M.-K. Lee J.-Y. Cho Y.-S. Song Y.-M. An N.-H. Kim H.-R. Kim U.-H. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 903-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A full-length human CD38 cDNA was cloned by RT-PCR using oligonucleotide primers (5′-GGAAGCTTATGGCCAACTGCGAG-3′, 5′-ACGTGTAGACTCTAGACTCGAGATCTCG-3′) (21.Jackson D.G. Bell J.I. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2811-2817PubMed Google Scholar). The total RNA was isolated from human lymphocytes and the first strand cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT)12–18. The cDNA was amplified by PCR using the above primers, and the amplified 928-base pair DNA was cloned into pCRTM 3.1 vector (Invitrogen). The sequence of the cloned CD38 cDNA was confirmed. The plasmid DNA was purified and linearized by digestion with PvuI. CD38−Jurkat cells were prepared by passing cells in anti-CD38-coated Immulan bead column. CD38− Jurkat or HeLa cells (107 cells/ml) were transfected with the linearized DNA (10 μg) by electroporation using an Electro square porator T820 (BTX) at 342 V and a pulse length of 99 μs with 5 repeat pulses. Stable transfectants were selected for resistance to G418 (200 μg/ml) and positive clones were repetitively selected with anti-CD38 antibody-coated Immulan beads. The total RNA was isolated from mouse T and B cells and reverse transcribed into cDNA with oligo(dT)12–18 and amplified using the following primers: CD38, 5′-GGAAGCTTATGGCTAACTATG-3′, 5′-GATCTAGATCCTTCACGTTAAG-3′ for the first PCR and probe preparation, and 5′-CAGGTGTCTGGGGACAGAC-3′, 5′-GGGTTCTTCACACACTGAAG-3′ for the second PCR; ADPRT (22.Moss J.

Thirty cycles of amplification were carried out as follows: 1 min at 94 °C; 1 min at 60 °C for CD38 (55 °C for ADPRT); 1 min 30 s at 72 °C followed by 10 min elongation at 72 °C. The amplified products were separated on 1% agarose gels, blotted, and hybridized with 32P-labeled specific probes; the bound radioactivity was autoradiographed. HeLa cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. After washing with ice-cold PBS, the cells were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The frozen cells were added to an 8% trichloroacetic acid solution to extract cADPR. The cADPR content was measured by a specific radioimmunoassay described elsewhere (23.Takahashi K. Kukimoto I. Tokita K. Inageda K. Inoue S. Kontani K. Hoshino S. Nishina H. Kanaho Y. Katada T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 204-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were incubated with Fura-2 AM (4 μm) in RPMI 1640 medium containing 3% fetal bovine serum for 60 min at 37 °C. The Fura-2-loaded cells were then washed twice with HBSS. For the fluorometric measurement of Ca2+, 1 × 107cells were placed in a quartz cuvette in a thermostatically controlled cell holder at 37 °C and the cell suspension was stirred continuously. Fluorescence ratios were taken with an alternative wavelength time scanning method (dual excitation at 340 and 380 nm; emission at 510 nm) using a PTI fluorometer. Calibration of the fluorescent signal in terms of Ca2+ was performed as described previously (24.Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Splenocytes (109 cells) were incubated with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (1 μg/ml) purified from Bacillus cereus as described (25.Volwerk J.J. Wetherwax P.B. Evans L.M. Kuppe A. Griffith O.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 39: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) in a total volume of 10 ml for 30 min at 37 °C to solubilize the ADPRTs. For purification of arginine-specific ADPRT, the supernatant was dialyzed in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 1 mm benzamide, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm EGTA and applied to an aminobenzamide-agarose column (Sigma). The elution was performed with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 1 mmaminobenzamide, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm EGTA. The active fractions of arginine-ADPRT were directly applied to a concanavalin A-agarose column (3 ml bed volume) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Chaps, 0.2m NaCl and washed with the same buffer. The bound proteins was eluted with 0.3 mmethyl-α-d-mannopyranoside. Activity fractions were concentrated and dialyzed in PBS. The arginine-specific ADPRT activity was measured as described (26.Klebl B.M. Pette D. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 239: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). One unit of the enzyme was expressed as nanomole/min. Specific activity was 6,300 units/mg and the yield of purified enzyme was 58 μg. For purification of cysteine-specific ADPRT, the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C-treated supernatant from splenocytes (109 cells) was dialyzed in buffer A (50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 30% ethylene glycol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm benzamide). The sample was applied slowly to cysteine-Sepharose column (bed volume 10 ml) at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. Unbound proteins were washed off the column with buffer A and bound proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 0.1 m NaCl and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol. Cysteine-specific ADPRT activity fractions were collected and concentrated with Amicon 10. After adding 1.7 m ammonium sulfate, the concentrate was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column (bed volume 10 ml) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The separation was performed on a 1.7 to 0m ammonium sulfate gradient at 4 °C using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Waters). The active fractions of cysteine-ADPRT were directly applied to a concanavalin A-agarose column (3 ml bed volume) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Chaps, 0.2 m NaCl and washed with the same buffer. The bound proteins was eluted with 0.3 mmethyl-α-d-mannopyranoside. Activity fractions were concentrated and dialyzed in PBS. The concentrate was applied to a high performance liquid chromatography gel filtration column and eluted with PBS. Cysteine-specific ADPRT activity was measured as described (27.Saxty B.A. van Heyningen S. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 931-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). One unit of the enzyme was expressed as nanomole/min. Specific activity was 2,500 units/mg and the yield of purified enzyme was 2 μg. Site-directed mutagenesis of CD38 was performed using Mutan-KTM mutagenesis kit (Takara, Japan). The following oligonucleotides were used for the mutagenesis: 5′-GTCCTGGCGGGATGCGTCAAG-3′ (R66G), 5′-GAAATTCATCCTGAGATGGGACATG (R78G), 5′-TTGAATATTCCCTTTGCTTAT-3′ (R269G), 5′-TTGAATATTCTTTTTGCTTAT-3′ (R269K), 5′-CTTGTCAGGTCCGTAGATATTG-3′ (R280G), for human CD38, where underlined nucleotides were altered. The right mutant clones were selected by sequencing. A pRc/CMV vector carrying either the wild type or mutant human CD38 cDNA was introduced and expressed in HeLa cells. Most ecto-NADases are known to be inactivated in the presence of NAD (15.Liberman I. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 225: 883-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Green S. Dobrjansky A. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2496-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We tested whether T lymphocyte CD38 is also inactivated in the presence of NAD. We induced the expression of CD38 on T cells from Balb/c mice by activation with anti-CD3 antibodies, since CD38 on murine T cells prepared from splenocytes was not induced by other stimuli, such as concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin, or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and inonomycin (Fig. 1). When the activated T cells were incubated with various concentrations of NAD for 1 h, the ADP-ribosyl cyclase and cADPR hydrolase activities of CD38 decreased in a dose-dependent manner with increasing concentrations of NAD (Fig.2 A). CD38 seemed to be the only enzyme responsible for the activities of both ADP-ribosyl cyclase and cADPR hydrolase, since most of these enzyme activities in the activated T cells were recovered by immunoprecipitation with anti-CD38 antibodies and inactivated by the addition of NAD as in the intact T cells (Fig. 2 A, inset).Figure 2Inactivation of CD38 activities by ADPRT-mediated ADP-ribosylation. A, effect of NAD on enzyme activities of CD38. Activated T cells (1 × 105cells/ml) were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence of various concentrations of NAD and the enzyme activities were measured.Inset, activated T cells (1 × 105cells/ml) were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence of various concentrations of NAD, CD38 was immunoprecipitated and the enzyme activities were measured. The data shown are the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. B, effect of PI-PLC on the ADP-ribosylation of CD38. Cells that had been incubated for 1 h with 1 μg/ml B. cereusphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC) or vehicle (control) in the presence of 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin were further incubated with 10 μm [32P]NAD for 1 h. CD38 was immunoprecipitated, separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and subjected to autoradiography (top), or the intact cells were biotinylated, immunoprecipitated with anti-CD38 mAb, and blotted with avidin-alkaline phosphatase (bottom). C, specificity of the ADPR-CD38 bond. The [32P]ADP-ribosylated CD38 was treated with water (lane 1), hydroxylamine (lane 2), or mercuric chloride (lane 3), or hydroxylamine plus mercuric chloride (lane 4). The ratio of densities of each lane was measured with image analyzer as 1:0.47:0.53:0. The data are representatives of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) This result indicates that both of the enzyme activities of CD38 are affected by the addition of NAD. To study the mechanisms responsible for the NAD-dependent inhibition of CD38 enzyme activities, we examined the transfer of ADPR from NAD to the CD38 molecule. We incubated the activated T cells with [adenylate-32P]NAD and immunoprecipitated with anti-CD38 antibodies. We found that the precipitate contained32P radioactivity (Fig. 2 B, control lane). These results suggest that ADPR from NAD was transferred to CD38 and that the modification of CD38 is NAD-dependent. Next, we tested whether CD38 was inactivated by mono-ADPRT-mediated ADP-ribosylation or by automodification by CD38. As it has been reported that mono-ADPRT is anchored on the cell membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linkage (14.Okamoto S. Azhipa O., Yu, Y. Russo E. Dennert G. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4190-4198PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Zolkiewska A. Nightingale M.S. Moss J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11352-11356Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), we examined whether the treatment of T cells with PI-PLC would block the ADP-ribosylation of CD38. Pretreatment of T cells with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C prevented NAD-dependent ADP-ribosylation of CD38 (Fig. 2 B), but did not affect the amount of membrane-associated CD38 and the activities of CD38. Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C treatment might not damage the T cells because there was no significant ATP release from the cells and no changes of the cell viability. This result indicates that the ADP-ribosylation of CD38 was not due to automodification but was mediated by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell surface mono-ADPRT. Mammalian cells contain at least two types of mono-ADPRTs that are either arginine- or cysteine-specific (29.Ueda K. Hayaishi O. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 73-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar); thus, we determined the ADPR acceptor site(s) on CD38. We treated [32P]ADP-ribosylated CD38 with water (control), hydroxylamine (which specifically cleaves arginine-linked ADPR), or mercuric chloride (which specifically cleaves cysteine-linked ADPR) and found that the [32P]ADPR on CD38 was removed completely only by treatment with a both hydroxylamine and mercuric chloride. Treatment with either hydroxylamine or mercuric chloride alone led to only partial release (Fig. 2 C). This suggests that both arginine- and cysteine-specific mono-ADPRTs are involved in the ADP-ribosylation of CD38. When the activated T cells were incubated with NAD, the percentage of viable T cells was significantly decreased as compared with control T cells that were incubated under the same conditions except that NAD was omitted (Fig.3 A). To determine whether the reduction of viable T cells was a result of apoptosis, we examined annexin V binding, a method for the early detection of apoptosis (30.Martin S.J. Reutelingsperger C.P. McGahon A.J. Rader J.A. van Schie R.C. LaFace D.M. Green D.R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (2570) Google Scholar), in activated T cells incubated in the presence or absence of NAD. The percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly increased in the activated T cells by the treatment with NAD (Fig. 3 B). To determine if ADP-ribosylation of CD38 plays an important role in inducing apoptosis in T cells, we examined whether ADP-ribosylation of CD38 could induce apoptosis in two cells lines. First CD38-transfected Jurkat cells, a cloned human T cell leukemia cell line that does not normally express CD38 but has both arginine- and cysteine-specific mono-ADPRTs, was examined. When the CD38-transfected and non-transfected Jurkat cells were exposed to NAD, we found that only the CD38-transfected Jurkat cells underwent apoptosis (Fig.3 C). Next, HeLa, a human epithelial cell line that does not normally express either CD38 or mono-ADPRT activity was examined. The CD38-transfected cells also could be induced to undergo apoptosis in the presence of NAD, but only when supplemented with partially purified mono-ADPRTs from murine splenocytes (Fig. 3 C). These results strongly suggest that CD38 is indeed a target molecule for ADP-ribosylation by mono-ADPRTs leading to programmed cell death and that the ADP-ribosylation of CD38 can induce apoptosis in CD38-expressing cells, regardless of the cell type. The results of NAD-dependent apoptosis of activated T cells and CD38-transfected cells still raise the argument that NAD metabolites might affect lymphocytes. To exclude the possibility, we tested the effects of the metabolites such as adenosine, AMP, ADP, ADP-ribose, and cADPR on the apoptosis of activated T cells, but no significant changes were found in these cells (data not shown). Since CD38 is expressed on both T and B lymphocytes, we determined whether B cells also undergo apoptosis through ADP-ribosylation of CD38. We incubated B cells with NAD and apoptosis was tested by annexin V binding. We found that B cells showed no detectable apoptosis (Fig.4 A), although CD38 was ADP-ribosylated. To determine whether there are differences between the ADP-ribosylation of CD38 in T cells and B cells, we examined the ADP-ribosylation sites on the CD38 of B cells and found that the ADPR on CD38 in the B cells was completely removed by treatment with mercuric chloride alone and unaffected by treatment with hydroxylamine (data not shown), indicating that the ADP-ribosylation of CD38 in B cells occurs only on the cysteine residue. We further examined the expression of arginine-specific mono-ADPRT activity in B cells and T cells by RT-PCR and Southern blot. We found that B cells did not express arginine-specific mono-ADPRT, whereas T cells did express this enzyme (Fig. 4 B). We then asked whether there are differences between arginine- and cysteine-ADP-ribosylation on the enzyme activity of CD38. We immunoprecipitated CD38 from B cells with anti-CD38 antibodies, incubated the immune complex with 100 μm NAD and either arginine- or cysteine-specific mono-ADPRTs purified from T cells, and examined the ADP-ribosyl cyclase and cADPR hydrolase activities. We found that arginine-ADP-ribosylation of CD38 resulted in the inactivation of both the cyclase and hydrolase activities of CD38, while cysteine-ADP-ribosylation resulted in the inactivation of hydrolase activity but did not affect the cyclase activity (Fig.4 C). Therefore, we asked whether arginine-specific ADRPT plays an essential role in the induction of apoptosis. When B cells were incubated with NAD and arginine-specific mono-ADPRT purified from splenocytes, the cells underwent apoptosis similar to T cells after incubation with NAD (Fig. 4 A and 3 B). This result suggests that the ADP-ribosylation of an arginine residue(s) on CD38 plays a critical role in the induction of apoptosis, and that this may be due to reduced cyclase activity, which presumably results in a reduced intracellular cADPR concentration ([cADPR]i). Thus, we examined the effect of CD38 ADP-ribosylation on [cADPR]i. As predicted, prior incubation of T cells with NAD significantly reduced [cADPR]i, compared with cells that were not treated with NAD (Fig. 4 D). Taken together, these results suggest that the inhibition of the cyclase activity of CD38 through ADP-ribosylation by arginine-mono-ADPRT blocks intracellular cADPR production, which subsequently results in decreases in intracellular free Ca2+ in activated T cells and culminating in apoptosis. We further determined which arginine residue of CD38 is ADP-ribosylated to inactivate the cyclase activity. We converted residues Arg-66 to Gly-66 (R66G), Arg-78 to Gly-78 (R78G), Arg-269 to Gly-269 (R269G), and Arg-280 to Gly-280 (R280G) by site-specific mutagenesis and transfected HeLa cells with the mutated cDNAs (R66G, R78G, R269G, or R280G). The transfected cells were incubated with NAD and arginine-mono-ADPRT and the ADP-ribosylation of CD38 was examined. We found that Arg-269 was the only acceptor of ADPR (Fig.5 A). We then asked whether R269G mutant-transfected cells are resistant to NAD-induced apoptosis because this CD38 mutant would not be ADP-ribosylated upon addition of NAD. Indeed, R269G mutant-transfected HeLa cells did not undergo apoptosis by NAD treatment. With regard to Arg mutant that retains WT levels of ADP-ribosyl cyclase but cannot serve as a substrate for the Arg-ADPRT, we generated a R269K mutant and its transfectant cell line. These cells had 70% ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity of the control WT, and the cells' CD38 could not serve as a substrate for the Arg-ADPRT, therefore these cells did not undergo any apoptosis by NAD treatment (data not shown). This result also indicates that ADP-ribosylation of CD38 is an important signal that can lead to apoptosis. The ligation of CD38 by agonistic CD38 antibodies has earlier been shown to elicit cellular responses, including elevation in cytoplasmic Ca2+ due to Ca2+ influx (1.Lund F. Solvason N. Grimaldi J.C. Parkhouse R.M.E. Howard M. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 469-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 31.Santos-Argumedo L. Teixeira C. Preece G. Kirkham P.A. Parkhouse R.M.E. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 3119-3130PubMed Google Scholar). Also, Guseet al. (32.Guse A.H. da Silva C.P. Berg I. Skapenko A.L. Weber K. Heyer P. Hohenegger M. Ashamu G.A. Schulze-Koops H. Potter B.V.L. Mayr G.W. Nature. 1999; 398: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated sustained increases in [cADPR]i and Ca2+ entry by the stimulation of TCR·CD3 complex in T lymphocytes. The mechanism by which cADPR regulated Ca2+ entry was suggested to be similar to that of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate in the capacitative Ca2+model, because cADPR mediated depletion of the Ca2+ pool by releasing Ca2+ from its target storage (32.Guse A.H. da Silva C.P. Berg I. Skapenko A.L. Weber K. Heyer P. Hohenegger M. Ashamu G.A. Schulze-Koops H. Potter B.V.L. Mayr G.W. Nature. 1999; 398: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Therefore, in order to examine the effect of ADP-ribosylation on CD38 ligation-induced signaling in control WT- and R269K mutant-transfected cells, we measured the [cADPR]i and intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), following CD38 ligation in cells pretreated with or without NAD. A prior incubation of WT-transfected HeLa cells with NAD completely abolished CD38 ligation-induced increase of cADPR production (Fig.5 B) and [Ca2+]i (Fig. 5 C), whereas cells without NAD treatment had increased [cADPR]iand [Ca2+]i. The increase in [Ca2+]i by CD38 ligation was most likely due to Ca2+ influx, since the increase was completely abrogated by EGTA, a Ca2+ chelator (data not shown). In contrast, prior treatment of mutant-transfected cells with NAD could not counteract the CD38 ligation-induced increases in cADPR production (Fig.5 B) and Ca2+ influx (Fig. 5 C). These findings were also observed in the WT- and R269K mutant-transfected Jurkat T lymphocytes (data not shown). Taken together, this result indicates that ADP-ribosylation of CD38 blocks intracellular cADPR production, which subsequently results in decreases in intracellular free Ca2+ and leads to apoptosis. The results described in the present study provide evidence for the interaction of two classes of ADP-ribose transfer enzymes in T cell signaling pathways that can lead to apoptosis. The first requirement for this pathway is likely CD38 expression (possessing cyclase activity) and the second requirement is ADP-ribosylation of CD38 (inactivation of cyclase). The present studies using mutant enzymes can be extrapolated to activated T cells by assuming that CD38 expression (cyclase activity) can accelerate cell cycling necessary for proliferation (12.Zocchi E. Usai C. Guida L. Furanco L. Bruzzone S. Passalacqua M. De Flora A. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In activated T cells, CD38 may be essential for the proliferation via Ca2+ influx by the action of cADPR which is generated by the ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity of CD38. However, ADP-ribosylation of CD38 results not only in cessation of cell proliferation but also in apoptosis of the cells. Thus, the mechanism by which apoptosis is induced by ADP-ribosylation of CD38 may be related to the cell cycle, because actively proliferating cells are sensitive to the apoptotic insults such as stoppage of Ca2+supply. For our ex vivo observations to have direct physiologic relevance, NAD, an intracellular metabolite, should be available extracellularly to support the ADP-ribosylation of CD38. Extracellular NAD concentrations have been reported to be submicromolar in the plasma of mammals including mice (33.Kim U.-H. Kim M.-K. Kim J.-S. Han M.-K. Park B.-H. Kim H.-R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 305: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), whereas micromolar NAD concentrations are likely to be needed for effective ADP-ribosylation of CD38 in the extracellular compartment (Fig. 2 A). However, a recent finding by Zocchi et al. (12.Zocchi E. Usai C. Guida L. Furanco L. Bruzzone S. Passalacqua M. De Flora A. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) that NAD is steadily released from fibroblast and epithelial cells supports the physiologic relevance of our observations as they suggest that micromolar NAD concentrations, especially in the vicinity of the outer surface, can be reached. Furthermore, conditions, such as massive cell lysis during inflammatory immune reactions may also lead to an increase in the concentration of NAD in the plasma, consequently enhancing the ADP-ribosylation of CD38.

The active site structures of a small number of enzymes within the α-KG-dependent dioxygenase superfamily have been characterized and shown to have a similar HXDX 50–70HX 10RXS arrangement of residues that make up the binding sites for Fe(II) and α-KG. TfdA does not have obvious homology to the dioxygenases containing the above motif but is related in sequence to eight other enzymes in the superfamily that form a distinct consensus sequence (HX(D/E)X 138–207 HX 10R/K). Variants of TfdA were created to examine the roles of putative metal-binding residues and the functions of the other seven histidines in this protein. The H167A, H200A, H213A, H245A, and H262A forms of TfdA formed inclusion bodies when overproduced in Escherichia coli DH5α; however, these proteins were soluble when fused to the maltose-binding protein (MBP). MBP-TfdA exhibited kinetic parameters similar to the native enzyme. The H8A and H235A variants were catalytically similar to wild-type TfdA. MBP-H213A and H216A TfdA have elevated K m values for 2,4-D, and the former showed a decreased k cat, suggesting these residues may affect substrate binding or catalysis. The H113A, D115A, MBP-H167A, MBP-H200A, MBP-H245A and MBP-H262A variants of TfdA were inactive. Gel filtration analysis revealed that the latter two proteins were highly aggregated. The remaining four inactive variants were examined in their Cu(II)-substituted forms by EPR and electron spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopic methods. Changes in EPR spectra upon addition of substrates indicated that copper was present at the active site in the H113A and D115A variants. ESEEM analysis revealed that two histidines are bound equatorially to the copper in the D115A and MBP-H167A TfdA variants. The experimental data and sequence analysis lead us to conclude that His-113, Asp-115, and His-262 are likely metal ligands in TfdA and that His-213 may aid in catalysis or binding of 2,4-D. 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)/α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) dioxygenase (TfdA) is an Fe(II)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the first step in degradation of the herbicide 2,4-D.

The experimental data and sequence analysis lead us to conclude that His-113, Asp-115, and His-262 are likely metal ligands in TfdA and that His-213 may aid in catalysis or binding of 2,4-D. 4-D, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid α-ketoglutarate 2,4-D/α-KG dioxygenase taurine/α-KG dioxygenase continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance electron spin echo envelope modulation isopenicillin N synthase deacetoxycephalosporin synthase maltose-binding protein Fourier transform 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)1/α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) dioxygenase (TfdA) is an Fe(II)- and α-KG-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the first step in degradation of the herbicide 2,4-D. This enzyme couples the oxidative decarboxylation of α-KG to the hydroxylation of a side chain carbon atom. The resultant hemiacetal spontaneously decomposes to form 2,4-dichlorophenol and glyoxalate (1.Fukumori F. Hausinger R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2083-2086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mechanistically, TfdA resembles numerous other α-KG-dependent dioxygenases from plants, animals, fungi, and bacteria that catalyze similar hydroxylation reactions at unactivated carbon centers (2.De Carolis E.

Members of the α-KG-dependent dioxygenase superfamily are not closely related by their sequences but rather appear to fall into one of three groups of related enzymes or fall into a fourth group of unrelated sequences (4.Hogan D.A.

TfdA is not closely related in sequence to the Group I α-KG-dependent dioxygenases described above but is clearly homologous (25–30% identity) toEscherichia coli taurine/α-KG dioxygenase (TauD) (18.Eichhorn E. van der Ploeg J.R.

Alignment of these Group II sequences indicates the conservation of two histidines and one aspartate (His-113, His-262, and Asp 115 in TfdA) as well as an invariant arginine that may be analogous to the α-KG-binding arginine in DAOCS and related enzymes (TableI). A third set of enzyme sequences (Group III) from members of the α-KG-dependent dioxygenase superfamily, including phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase and proline hydroxylase, exhibit the presence of a third related motif despite the lack of overall sequence similarity to Group I or Group II enzymes.Table IConsensus motifs for subgroups within the α-KG-dependent dioxygenase superfamilyGroup I (IPNS, DAOCS, and related enzymes)HXDX 50–70HX 10(R/K)XSGroup II (TfdA, TauD, clavaminate synthase and related enzymes)HX(D/E)X 138–207HX 10–13RGroup III (Phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase, proline hydroxylase and related enzymes)HXDX 72–101HX 10(R/K)XS Open table in a new tab In this study, we used site-directed mutagenesis methods to examine the roles of potential metal-binding residues in the above motif (His-113, His-262, and Asp-115) and the remaining seven histidines in TfdA. Previously published work showed that TfdA was inactivated by diethylpyrocarbonate, a histidine-selective reagent, and provided evidence consistent with the presence of multiple histidines in the active site (21.Fukumori F. Hausinger R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24311-24317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Spectroscopic studies of TfdA showed the presence of two equatorially bound imidazole nitrogens as ligands to the active site metal and indicated that one imidazole ligand may be displaced or shifted to an axial position upon substrate binding (22.Cosper N.J.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16714-16726Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Based on analyses of different TfdA variants, we identify several likely metal ligands and provide evidence that another one or two histidines may aid in substrate binding. All plasmids were constructed from pUS311 (21.Fukumori F. Hausinger R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24311-24317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a pUC19 derivative that contains the Ralstonia eutropha JMP134 tfdA gene (Fig.1). The H8A, D115A, H213A, H216A, H235A, H245A, and H262A TfdA variants were created by direct mutation oftfdA in pUS311 by the Stratagene Quickchange System (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All mutagenic primers are listed in TableII. Two alternative approaches were used to construct the three remaining variants. Plasmids encoding H113A and H167A TfdA variants were created by CLONTECHmutagenesis of pXHtfdA, a pUC19 plasmid containing the 5′-XbaI-HindII fragment of the tfdAgene (Fig. 1). To create the complete gene containing the indicated mutations, the XbaI-HindII fragment was cloned into pHKtfdA, which contains the 3′ end of the tfdA gene. pHKtfdA was constructed in two steps. First, the 1.4-kilobase pairXbaI-SalI fragment from pUS311, containing the complete tfdA gene, was cloned into pBC KS−(Stratagene) cut with XbaI and XhoI to create pBCtfdA. This step had the benefit of eliminating a HindII site that interfered with further cloning steps. The 727-base pairHindII-KpnI fragment of pBCtfdA was subcloned into pBC KS− cut with the same enzymes to give pHKtfdA. Similarly, the gene encoding H200A TfdA was made by mutagenesis of pXXtfdA, a pUC19 plasmid containing the 5′-XbaI-XhoI fragment of tfdA. The altered XbaI-XhoI fragment was then inserted into pHKtfdA cut with XbaI and XhoI to give the complete H200A tfdA gene. The identity of all final constructs was confirmed by sequence analysis. To insert the genes encoding H167A and H262A variants of TfdA into a plasmid that would allow for isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-controlled expression, the XbaI-SalI fragments from the corresponding plasmids described above were cloned into pET23a (Novagen) prepared with the same enzymes.Table IISequences of mutagenic primers used to create altered tfdA genesMutantPrimer sequenceaThe reverse primer used for the creation of all mutants was the complement of the forward primer.H8A5′-CGC AAA TCC CCT TGC TCC TCT TTT CGC C-3′H113A5′-GTC GCT GGC CCA AGC TGG-3′D115A5′-GCA CAG CGC CAG CTC CTT TCA-3′H167A5′-GCG TGC CGA GCA GTA CGC ACT G-3′H200A5′-GGT TCG AAC CGC CGC CGG CTC-3′H213A5′-GCT CGC GGC CGC GCC GAT-3′H216A5′-CCT TCG ACG GCG CTC GCG-3′H235A5′-GCT TCT CGA GGC GAC ACA G-3′H245A5′-GTG TAC CGG GCT CGC TGG AAC-3′H262A5′-CGT TCT TGC ACG CGG ACG CAG-3′Tfda-MBPF5′-TCT CTA GAG TGA GCG TCG TCG CAA ATC C-3′Tfda-MBPR5′-GTC AAG CTT GGT TGC GTA CAT CTT GTG G-3′a The reverse primer used for the creation of all mutants was the complement of the forward primer. Open table in a new tab To create the maltose-binding protein (MBP)-TfdA fusion proteins, the wild-type tfdA gene was amplified from pUS311 with TfdA-MBPF and TfdA-MBPR primers (Table II) to create an XbaI site directly upstream of the GTG start codon of the tfdA gene and a HindIII restriction site 54 base pairs downstream of the stop codon. The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned directly into the pGEM-T vector according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). TheXbaI-HindIII fragment was isolated from the resulting plasmid and cloned into the pMAL-c2 vector that had been digested with the same enzymes. The identity of the newly createdmalE-tfdA gene fusion was confirmed by sequencing. Substitution of the mutation-containing internalNruI fragment for the same fragment of the wild-typemalE-tfdA gene created MBP-fusion forms of altered TfdAs. First, pMAL-tfdA was digested withNruI, and the vector fragment was purified and religated to create pMAL-tfdAΔNruI. The resultant plasmid was linearized with NruI and dephosphorylated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase prior to ligation with theNruI fragments isolated from the previously described mutant genes. Constructs were confirmed by restriction analysis. H8A, H113A, D115A, H216A, H235A, and wild-type TfdA proteins were purified from E. coli DH5α cells carrying pUS311 and its mutated derivatives according to a previously described protocol (21.Fukumori F. Hausinger R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24311-24317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the non-mutated enzyme and the TfdA variants H167A, H200A, H213A, H245A, and H262A were purified as MBP-TfdA fusion proteins from E. coli DH5α by the protocol described in the pMAL Protein Fusion and Purification System Manual (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Specific activities of the wild-type and variant TfdA proteins were determined by a previously described spectrophotometric assay (21.Fukumori F. Hausinger R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24311-24317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The typical assay mixture contained 1 mm 2,4-D, 1 mm α-KG, 100 μm(NH4)2Fe(SO4)2, and 100 μm ascorbic acid in 10 mm MOPS buffer (pH 6.75) at 30 °C. The reactions were quenched by the addition of EDTA to a concentration of 5 mm. 2,4-Dichlorophenol was quantified by reaction with 4-aminoantipyrene followed by measurement of the absorbance at 510 nm. One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to produce 1 μmol of dichlorophenol·min−1. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. For calculation of the k cat values, the TfdA variants were assumed to have M r = 31,600 and the MBP-TfdA variants were assignedM r = 74,500. The low K m values for α-KG (∼2–5 μm for the wild-type enzyme) precluded use of the 4-aminoantipyrene assay for accurate determination of this value. The alternative method used to measure the K m values for α-KG quantified the amount of 14CO2 liberated from α-[1-14C]KG during the course of the reaction (21.Fukumori F. Hausinger R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24311-24317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Size exclusion chromatography was used to estimate the native molecular weights of TfdA, MBP-TfdA, and mutant proteins. The proteins were chromatographed on a Superose 6 gel filtration column (1.0 × 30 cm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 200 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 0.2 ml·min−1. The elution volumes were compared with those for gel filtration standards (Bio-Rad) including thyroglobulin, 670 kDa; bovine gamma globulin, 158 kDa; chicken ovalbumin, 44 kDa; myoglobin, 17 kDa; and vitamin B12, 1350 Da. Proteins for electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopic analyses were exchanged into 25 mm MOPS (pH 6.75) by repeated concentration and dilution in Centricon 30 (Amicon) centrifugal concentrators. The final subunit concentration was 0.5 mm for the non-fusion forms of TfdA and 0.4 mmfor the MBP-TfdA proteins. CuCl2 was added to a concentration of 450 and 350 μm, respectively. Buffered solutions of α-KG and 2,4-D were added to final concentrations of 5 mm. Glycerol was present at 40% in all samples. X-band EPR spectra were obtained at 77 K on a Bruker ESP-300E spectrometer. ESEEM data were collected on a home-built spectrometer; the microwave bridge of this instrument has been previously described in detail (25.McCracken J. Shin D.-H. Dye J.L. Appl. Mag. Res. 1992; 3: 305-316Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Data collection and analyses were controlled by a Power Computing model 200 Power PC using software written with LabView version 5.01 (National Instruments). Electron spin echoes were digitized, averaged, and integrated by a Tektronix model 620B digital oscilloscope interfaced to the spectrometer computer via an IEEE-488 bus. Two four-channel delay and gate generators (Stanford Research Systems model DG535), a Bruker BH-15 magnetic field controller, and a Hewlett-Packard model 8656B radiofrequency synthesizer were also interfaced using IEEE-488 protocol. Data were collected using a reflection cavity that employed a folded microstrip resonator (26.Lin C.P. Bowman M.K. Norris J.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 369-374Google Scholar). A three-pulse stimulated echo sequence (90-τ-90°-T-90°) was used. ESEEM spectra were generated by Fourier transformation of the time domain data using dead time reconstruction (27.Mims W.B. J. Magn. Reson. 1984; 59: 291-306Google Scholar). Simulations of the experimental data were performed on a Sun SparcII work station. Simulation programs were written in FORTRAN and based on the density matrix formalism developed by Mims (28.Mims W.B. Phys. Rev. B: Solid State. 1972; 5: 2409-2419Crossref Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Software for the frequency analysis of the experimental and simulated data was written in Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA). Related sequences were initially detected by BLAST (29.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) and PSI-BLAST (20.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) analyses. Alignments were generated with the CLUSTAL algorithm (30.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar), and the figure was prepared using Genedoc (31.Nicholas Jr., K.B. Nicholas Jr., H.B. Deerfield D.W., II EMB News. 1997; 4: 14Google Scholar). Initially, all of the mutant genes were expressed from their pUC19-based plasmids except for those encoding H113A, H167A, and H200A TfdA, which were in pBC KS−-derived plasmids. By using the standard protocol to produce soluble, wild-type TfdA (growth at 30 °C to early stationary phase), only the H8A, H113A, D115A, H216A, and H235A variants existed as soluble proteins. All of the other TfdA variants were present as inclusion bodies even when grown at lower temperatures (22 °C), in M9 minimal medium, or in LB broth containing 660 mmsorbitol and 2.5 mm betaine (32.Blackwell J.R. Horgan R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 295: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In addition, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-controlled production of H167A and H262A proteins from mutant genes cloned into pET23a did not yield soluble samples even when the harvested cell pellets were suspended in buffer containing 20% glycerol to limit protein aggregation. To overcome the solubility problems for the five TfdA variants, MBP-TfdA fusion proteins were created. Wild-type TfdA and the MBP-TfdA fusion protein had essentially identical k catand very similar K m values for α-KG and 2,4-D (Table III). A slight increase in the apparent K D for Fe(II) may reflect some metal binding capacity of MBP. Since the presence of the fusion protein did not appear to greatly affect the kinetic parameters of wild-type enzyme, similar fusion proteins were created for the H167A, H200A, H213A, H245A, and H262A TfdA variants.Table IIISummary of the kinetic parameters for active TfdA variantsTfdA samplek catK mαKGK m 2,4-DK D Fe(II)min −1μmμmμmWild type442 ± 334.9 ± 0.7319.3 ± 3.72.0 ± 0.5MBP fusion411 ± 239.9 ± 1.833.7 ± 2.515.2 ± 5.4H8AaMore than 75% of the protein was present as the degradation product.

The k cat was estimated from the active, full-length fraction. Open table in a new tab Results from kinetic analyses of the four active mutant proteins are summarized in TableIII. H8A TfdA was soluble and active but was rapidly proteolyzed to an inactive form. By electrophoretic comparisons, the cleavage site appeared to be the same as in wild-type TfdA (between Arg-77 and Phe-78) (21.Fukumori F. Hausinger R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24311-24317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of proteolysis of H8A TfdA was enhanced compared with that seen for the wild-type enzyme despite the presence of EDTA and protease inhibitors in the purification buffer. Because purified H8A TfdA was more than 75% degraded, the catalytic rate constant was calculated with the estimated amount of intact enzyme. These calculations indicate rates and K m values similar to those for the wild-type enzyme. Similarly, the kinetic parameters for H235A TfdA were comparable to the native enzyme. In contrast, two variants exhibited differences from wild-type enzyme in their kinetic parameters. The H213A MBP-TfdA variant exhibited a 20-fold reduction ink cat and a 10-fold increase inK m for 2,4-D. In addition, H216A TfdA had a modest (2.5-fold) increase in the K m for 2,4-D and no change in catalytic rate. The other kinetic parameters for H213A MBP-TfdA and H216A TfdA (K m for α-KG andK D for ferrous ion) did not differ significantly from the wild-type values. Six soluble TfdA variants (H113A, D115A, MBP-H167A, MBP-H200A, MBP-H245A, and MBP-H262A) exhibited no activity even when assayed with elevated substrate and cofactor concentrations (10 mm α-KG, 5 mm 2,4-D, and 250 μm Fe(II)). To assess whether the inactive mutant proteins assumed conformations similar to the wild-type enzyme, their apparent molecular weights were estimated by gel filtration analysis. The observed size of wild-type TfdA was found to be 51 kDa by comparison to protein standards, suggesting that TfdA forms a compact dimer or an elongated monomer. The elution volume for both H113A and D115A corresponded exactly to wild-type TfdA indicating that these proteins are not significantly altered in their quaternary structure. MBP-TfdA eluted both in the void volume (approximately 25% of the protein) and at a position corresponding to 216 kDa (roughly 75% of the protein), suggesting that MBP-TfdA forms at least a dimer. Because each MBP-TfdA subunit is comprised of two domains separated by a 13-amino acid linker, the resultant protein may migrate with a larger apparent molecular weight. MBP-H167A and MBP-H200A samples demonstrated the same two-peak profile as MBP-TfdA but with larger proportions eluting in the void volume. MBP-H245A and MBP-H262A proteins were soluble; however, gel filtration analysis indicated the presence of only highly aggregated material eluting in the void volume. Because these mutant proteins exhibited aberrations in their folding properties, the catalytic role of His-245 and His-262, if any, could not be assessed. The metallocenter properties for selected TfdA variants were probed by EPR spectroscopy. To circumvent the problems that arise in EPR measurements of integer spin paramagnetic centers, Fe(II) was substituted with cupric ion. Although the Cu(II) form of TfdA is inactive, Cu(II) binds competitively with respect to Fe(II) (K i = 1–3 μm), and copper-substituted TfdA has been used previously to study the metal coordination environment of this enzyme in the presence and absence of substrates (22.Cosper N.J.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16714-16726Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Spectral parameters of wild-type Cu(II)-TfdA, Cu(II)-TfdA + α-KG, and Cu(II)-TfdA + α-KG + 2,4-D (Fig.2 A and TableIV), agreed well with those reported previously (23.Whiting A.K. Que Jr., L.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16714-16726Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Earlier studies of copper-substituted wild-type TfdA indicated that the metal is bound in a type 2 environment with a mixture of O and N ligands in the equatorial plane. Upon addition of α-KG and 2,4-D to the enzyme, the spectral parameters are altered to a more rhombic signal with accompanying resolution of ligand hyperfine coupling (Fig. 2 A). These results suggest that binding of the co-substrates to the enzyme leads to a better defined copper site with α-KG binding directly to the metallocenter (23.Whiting A.K. Que Jr., L. Saari R.E.

We have now studied the effects and mechanisms of action of NO on endocytosis, investigated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran using human monocyte-derived DC, both immature and after treatment with TNFα. Exposure of DC to NO, released by either bystander phagocytes or NO donors, reversed the inhibition of endocytosis induced by TNFα. The intracellular accumulation of ceramide induced by TNFα was also inhibited by NO. In addition, NO was found to exert an inhibitory effect downstream of the TNFα-triggered ceramide accumulation, because NO donors reversed the inhibition of endocytosis induced by the cell-permeant C2-ceramide. These effects of NO were mimicked by the membrane-permeant cyclic GMP analogue, 8-Br cyclic GMP, and prevented by inhibition of the soluble guanylyl cyclase. At variance with rodents, the inducible isoform of the NO synthase was expressed neither in immature human DC nor after cell treatment with TNFα, interferon-γ, and lipopolysaccharide, suggesting that regulation of these cells depends on exogenous NO. NO, working through cyclic GMP, might therefore prolong the ability of human DC to internalize antigens at the site of inflammation and thus modulate the initial steps leading to antigen-specific immune responses.

Steinman R.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (12349) Google Scholar). Immature DC capture antigens at the site of inflammation and process and present them to T cells in secondary lymphoid organs where DC prime the immune response (1.Banchereau J. Steinman R.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (12349) Google Scholar). These events are accompanied by a process of DC maturation, which includes down-regulation of endocytosis, and is orchestrated by pro-inflammatory signals generated at the site of infection (1.Banchereau J. Steinman R.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (12349) Google Scholar). Among these signals, an important role might be played by NO, a gaseous messenger known to modulate specific functions of cell populations involved in the immune responses (2.MacMicking J. Xie Q. Nathan C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3501) Google Scholar, 3.Clancy R.M. Amin A.R. Abramson S.B. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 1141-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). NO is generated intracellularly by both constitutive NO synthases (NOSs), as in the case of B and T lymphocytes (4.Reiling N. Kroncke R. Ulmer A.J. Gerdes J. Flad H.D. Hauschildt S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), or by the inducible isoform of the enzyme (iNOS), expressed by macrophages after their activation with cytokines and bacterial products (5.Moncada S. Higgs E.A. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1319-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). NO may act either in an autocrine or paracrine fashion on neighboring cells, thus contributing to a co-ordinate action against pathogens (5.Moncada S. Higgs E.A. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1319-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 6.Gross S.S. Wolin M.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 737-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar, 7.Liew F.Y. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 396-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Mice with a targeted iNOS deletion are more susceptible to infections (8.Wei X.-Q. Charles I.G. Smith A. Ure J. Feng G. Huang F. Xu D. Muller W. Moncada S. Liew F.Y. Nature. 1995; 375: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar) and show enhanced T cell activity, characterized by strong cell-mediated immune responses and tissue damage (9.McLean A. Wei X.Q. Huang F.P. Al-Alem U.A. Chan W.L. Liew F.Y. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 825-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Indeed, the sustained generation of NO by iNOS endows activated macrophages and microglial cells with anti-microbial and cytotoxic activity and enhances the function of bystander T cells (2.MacMicking J. Xie Q. Nathan C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3501) Google Scholar, 10.Sciorati C. Rovere P. Ferrarini M. Paolucci C. Heltai S. Vaiani R. Clementi E. Manfredi A.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1570-1576PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, NO regulates the generation of cytokines and chemokines at the site of infection (discussed in Ref. 11.Huang F.P. Niedbala W. Wei X.Q. Xu D. Feng G.J. Robinson J.H. Lam C. Liew F.Y. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 4062-4070Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Evidence obtained in the murine system indicates that NO may also modulate DC function. In particular NO, either exogenous or produced by iNOS in DC themselves, appears to inhibit their antigen presentation function (12.Holt P.G. Oliver J. Bilyk N. McMenamin C. McMenamin P.G. Kraal G. Thepen T. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 13.Lu L. Bonham C.A. Chambers F.G. Watkins S.C. Hoffman R.A. Simmons R.L. Thomson A.W. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3577-3586PubMed Google Scholar). So far, however, the mechanism of action by NO in the maturation process of DC has not been studied, nor have the intracellular targets of NO been identified. In this study we have investigated the regulation by NO of the ability of human DC to endocytose extracellular antigens. We have used a well characterized model of DC maturation, i.e. human monocyte-derived DC exposed to tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). This cytokine, working via its type I p55 receptor, triggers the maturation process of DC in vitro, with inhibition of their ability to endocytose soluble antigens (14.Sallusto F. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (4522) Google Scholar, 15.Sallusto F. Cella M. Danieli C. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp.

FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2021-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Our results show that NO, generated either by bystander phagocytes expressing iNOS or by NO donors, prevents in a cyclic GMP (cGMP)-dependent way the down-regulation of endocytosis induced in DC by exposure to TNFα. This effect of NO is due to inhibition of TNFα-induced accumulation of ceramide, a lipid messenger known to play a key role in both antigen uptake and presentation by DC (17.Sallusto F. Nicolò C. De Maria R. Corinti S. Testi R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2411-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), as well as to additional effect(s) exerted downstream of ceramide accumulation.

(Milan, Italy). The reagents for tissue culture were from Life Technologies, Inc. except for fetal calf serum (clone III), obtained from Hyclone-Celbio, (Milan, Italy). All other reagents were from Sigma. The N9 murine microglial cells were kindly provided by Paola Ricciardi-Castagnoli (Milan, Italy). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from the blood of healthy donors (kindly provided by the blood transfusion department of our institution) with a density Fycoll-Paque gradient as described (14.Sallusto F. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (4522) Google Scholar). Mononuclear cells were resuspended in RPMI, 10% fetal calf serum, and allowed to adhere to 6-well plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA). After 2 h at 37 °C nonadherent cells were removed. Monocytes were then cultured for 7 days in RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, human GM-CSF (50 ng/ml), and IL-4 (1000 units/ml) to derive immature DC. Mature DC cells were obtained from immature DC by a 48-h incubation in RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin in the presence of human TNFα (0.2–200 ng/ml). Similar conditions were used in the experiments in which C2-ceramide (80 μm) was used. When the 48-h incubation with either TNFα or C2-ceramide was carried out in the presence of DETA-NO (100 μm), SNAP (200 μm), 8-Br-cGMP (3 mm), or ODQ (3 μm), the compounds were added in various combinations 10 min before and were maintained throughout the incubation time. Control experiments in which DC were incubated with the various compounds in the absence of TNFα and C2-ceramide were carried out in parallel. In the experiments in which cells were exposed to DETA-NO and SNAP, they were dissolved immediately before addition to the cells. SNAP and DETA-NO prepared 7 days before the experiments were used in control experiments. Under these conditions they do not release any NO, as measured using a NO detecting electrode with a sensitivity of 1 nm (Mark-2 ISO NO, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). In the experiments in which DC were incubated with TNFα, maturation was routinely assessed by flow cytometry, measuring the exposure on the plasma membrane of specific antigens known to be expressed by immature or mature DC, namely CD1a, a marker of human myeloid DC; MHC class I and class II molecules; CD80, CD86, and CD40, involved in T cell co-stimulation (14.Sallusto F. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (4522) Google Scholar, 18.Chen B.-G. Shi Y. Smith J.D. Choi D. Geiger J.D. Mulé J.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 4652-4661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of these antigens was analyzed after staining with appropriate FITC-labeled Abs as described (18.Chen B.-G. Shi Y. Smith J.D. Choi D. Geiger J.D. Mulé J.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 4652-4661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACStar Plus, Becton Dickinson, Sunnyvale, CA). Fig.1 shows results from a typical analysis: GM-CSF, IL-4- treated (immature) DC express CD1a, MHC class I and class II, CD80, CD86, and CD40. TNFα-treated (mature) DC show a significant up-regulation of MHC class I and class II, CD1a, CD80, CD86, and CD40. Expression of the macrophage marker CD14 was never observed. Viability and apoptosis in the various samples was assessed at different times by propidium iodide/annexin V staining exactly as described (19.Rovere P. Clementi E. Ferrarini M. Heltai S. Sciorati C. Sabbadini M.G. Rugarli C. Manfredi A.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4631-4637PubMed Google Scholar). Exposure of DC to a continuous flux of NO was achieved in vitro using the scavenger murine microglial brain N9 clone cells derived from embryonic mouse, which express iNOS upon activation (20.Betz-Corradin S. Mauel J. Denis-Donini S. Quattrocchi E. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Glia. 1993; 7: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). N9 cells were cultured in Iscove's modified DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine. Induction of iNOS by these cells requires IFNγ together with a second signal (20.Betz-Corradin S. Mauel J. Denis-Donini S. Quattrocchi E. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Glia. 1993; 7: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). To induce iNOS expression, N9 cells (2 × 105 cells/ml) were incubated for 24 h in the presence of polybed polystirene microspheres (microsphere/cell ratio = 5) and mouse IFNγ (10 units/ml) with or without the NOS inhibitors aminoguanidine (1 mm) andN ω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME; 1 mm). NO production by N9 cells was measured by determining the nitrite accumulation in the culture medium using the Griess reaction (21.Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogouski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tarmenbeum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10881) Google Scholar). Standard curves with increasing concentrations of sodium nitrite were run in parallel. The co-colture of DC and N9 cells was carried out using a double chamber system (Costar, Cambridge, MA). A semi-permeable polycarbonate membrane with a cut-off of 0.4 μm separated the lower chamber, containing immature DC, from the upper chamber. DC were incubated for 48 h in the lower chamber at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well either in the presence or absence of human TNFα (200 ng/ml). Activated, iNOS-expressing N9 cells were seeded in the upper chamber at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/well at the beginning of the incubation with TNFα. DC were then collected, and endocytosis of FITC-dextran was measured as described below. DC, exposed to the various treatments described in the paragraphs above, were washed and resuspended in RPMI containing 10% fetal calf serum. 2 × 105 cell samples were incubated at either 37 or 4 °C with FITC-dextran (1 mg/ml). Uptake of the fluorescent dye was stopped at the indicated time points by the addition of ice-cold phsophate-buffered saline containing 1% fetal calf serum. Samples were then washed three times in the same buffer at 4 °C and analyzed by flow cytometry using propidium iodide to exclude dead cells as described (22.Lutz M.B. Rovere P. Kleijneer M.J. Rescigno M. Aβmann C.U. Oorschot V.M.J. Geuze H.J. Trucy J. Demandolx D. Davoust J. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3707-3716PubMed Google Scholar). FITC-dextran, reconstituted in RPMI and stored at 4 °C, was centrifuged to remove aggregates before addition to the cells. Immature DC (1 × 106 cells/sample), incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor hydroxy buthyl methyl xanthine (0.6 mm), were incubated for an additional 15 min in the presence or absence of DETA-NO (100 μm) with or without ODQ (3 μm). The reaction was terminated by addition of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (final concentration, 7.5%). After ether extraction, cGMP levels were measured using a radioimmunoassay kit and normalized on cellular proteins, determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay procedure (BCA protein assay; Pierce). Immature DC cells (1 × 106 cells/sample) were incubated in 80 μl of phosphate-buffered saline with human TNFα (200 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of either DETA-NO (100 μm), SNAP (200 μm), or 8-Br-cGMP (3 mm) with or without ODQ (3 μm) and then quickly shifted at 37 °C. At the time points indicated, incubation was stopped by the addition of 300 μl of ice-cold CH3OH/CHCl3 (2/1, v/v). Samples were then supplemented with 100 μl of CHCl3 and 100 μl of NaCl (1 m). The extracted phospholipids were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 100 microunits diacylglycerol kinase in the presence of 5 mg/ml cardiolipin, 7.5% glucopyranoside, 1 mm diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/ml) as described (23.Cifone M.G. Roncaioli P. De Maria R. Camarda G. Santoni A. Ruberti G. Testi R. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1547-1552Google Scholar). Under these conditions, diacylglycerol kinase is not rate-limiting, and full conversion of ceramide to ceramide phosphate is thus to be expected (24.Perry D.K. Hannun Y.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 226-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The ceramide phosphates produced were separated by thin layer chromatography (Silca gel 60, Merck, Milan, Italy) using CHCl3/CH3OH/CH3COOH (65/15/5, v/v/v) as solvent. To determine the concentration of ceramide per sample, known amounts of ceramide standard were processed and loaded in parallel. The relevant spots were identified by autoradiography, and their radioactivity was estimated by microdensitometry using a Molecular Dynamics Imagequant apparatus (Buckinghamshire, UK). DC were incubated for 24 h in the culture medium with or without human TNFα (200 ng/ml), IL-4 (1000 units/ml), GM-CSF (50 ng/ml), IFNγ (100 units/ml), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 μg/ml). Cells were then collected, washed twice with cold buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na2P2O6, 30 mm NaF, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), and lysed for 30 min in the same buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm phenylmethyl sulfonylfluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Protein content in the lysates was assayed by the bicinchoninic acid procedure. After addition of SDS and β-mercaptoethanol the samples were boiled, and 50 μg of protein/lane were loaded into the slots of 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described (25.Sciorati C. Rovere P. Ferrarini M. Heltai S. Manfredi A.A. Clementi E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23211-23215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). High efficiency transfer of proteins onto nitrocellulose membranes was obtained at 200 mA for 18 h in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% CH3OH, pH 8.3. After transfer, both the gels and the blots were stained with Ponceau red. For Western blotting, the nitrocellulose sheets were processed at room temperature, first for 1 h with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin and then for 2 h with the anti-iNOS Ab in the same buffer, followed by five times washing for 5 min with 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.05% Tween-20, 5% powdered milk, pH 7.4. The secondary Ab was then added for 30 min, after which the membranes were washed several times in the same buffer, and the signals were revealed with Enhanced ChemiLuminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions. The results are expressed as the means ± standard error of the mean; n represents the number of individual experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test for unpaired variables (two-tailed). The marks *, **, and *** or +, ++, and +++ in the figures refer to statistical probabilities (p) of <0.05, <0.01, and <0.001, respectively, measured in the various experimental conditions as detailed in the legends to figures. Human monocyte-derived DC retain their ability to uptake antigens. This ability is progressively lost when DC are treated with TNFα (14.Sallusto F. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (4522) Google Scholar). We have investigated the role of NO in the modulation of the endocytic function of DC using the well characterized fluorochrome-labeled FITC-dextran as a marker of endocytosis. Two different sources of the gaseous messenger were used: the NO donors DETA-NO and SNAP and the N9 murine microglial cells activated with polystirene microspheres and IFNγ, a treatment that induces expression of iNOS and continuous generation of bioactive NO (10.Sciorati C. Rovere P. Ferrarini M. Paolucci C. Heltai S. Vaiani R. Clementi E. Manfredi A.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1570-1576PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Betz-Corradin S. Mauel J. Denis-Donini S. Quattrocchi E. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Glia. 1993; 7: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In the first experimental approach, immature DC were incubated in a double chamber system with or without TNFα (200 ng/ml, 48 h) in the presence or absence of activated N9 cells. DC were then resuspended in cytokine-free medium and incubated with FITC-dextran, and the internalization of the latter was measured by flow cytometry. In the TNFα-untreated, immature DC incubated at 37 °C, uptake of FITC-dextran was found to proceed linearly for 15 min and then to level off progressively. In contrast, at 4 °C no uptake was detected (Fig.2 A). Treatment of DC with TNFα resulted in a statistically significant inhibition of endocytosis of FITC-dextran, which was prolonged throughout the period analyzed (1 h, Fig. 2 A). This effect of TNFα was not due to cytotoxicity because cell viability was 94 ± 3.8% after 48 h of treatment with the cytokine (n = 5). Incubation with activated N9 cells prevented the inhibition of endocytosis induced by TNFα at all time points investigated (Fig.2 A), an effect suppressed when incubation of DC with activated N9 cells was carried out in the presence of the NOS inhibitors aminoguanidine (1 mm) or l-NAME (1 mm) (Fig. 2 B, upper panel). The effect of these inhibitors was proportional to their ability to reduce NO release by the N9 cells, measured as nitrite accumulation in the culture medium (Fig. 2 B, lower panel). In the second experimental approach, immature DC cells were incubated with TNFα (0.2–200 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of DETA-NO (100 μm) or SNAP (200 μm). TNFα induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of endocytosis (Fig.3 A) that was reversed by both NO donors (Fig. 3). Decomposed DETA-NO and SNAP, which are unable to release NO as measured by a NO-sensitive electrode, did not have any significant effect on endocytosis (Fig. 3 B). Moreover, NO donors or activated N9 cells failed to induce any significant effect on endocytosis of DC that were not treated with TNFα (not shown). NO donors did not induce cytotoxicity (viability versusuntreated controls was 95 ± 5.0 and 93 ± 4.3% after the 48-h incubation time with DETA-NO and SNAP, respectively, n = 3). NO effects are known to be mediated through both cGMP-dependent and -independent signaling pathways (5.Moncada S. Higgs E.A. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1319-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). cGMP generation in immature DC was increased by DETA-NO with respect to untreated controls (values were 2.39 ± 0.23 and 0.35 ± 0.05 pmol/mg/min, respectively), an effect that disappeared in the presence of the guanylyl cyclase inhibitor ODQ (3 μm) (values were 0.42 ± 0.07 pmol/mg/min) (n = 3). Immature DC were treated with TNFα (48 h) in the presence or absence of NO donors, either alone or in the presence of ODQ or of the membrane-permeant cGMP analogue 8-Br-cGMP (3 mm). As shown in Fig. 4, DETA-NO and SNAP prevented the effect of TNFα on endocytosis of FITC-dextran. This action of the NO donors was inhibited by ODQ and mimicked by 8-Br-cGMP. These results indicate that NO controls endocytosis regulated by TNFα through the activation of cGMP-dependent pathway(s). Ceramide, a second messenger generated by the activation of the p55 receptor for TNFα, has been shown to mediate some of the effects of the cytokine in DC (17.Sallusto F. Nicolò C. De Maria R. Corinti S. Testi R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2411-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The kinetics of ceramide generation by DC treated with TNFα are shown in Fig.5 A. The cytokine induced a progressive accumulation of the lipid messenger, which reached a plateau after about 6 h and remained constant thereafter. No significant ceramide accumulation was observed in cells not exposed to TNFα (Fig. 5 A). When DC were incubated with the cytokine in the presence of activated N9 cells, a negative correlation was found between the amount of NO generated, measured as the concentration of nitrite released in the medium, and the intracellular accumulation of ceramide (Fig. 5 B). A similar inhibition of ceramide accumulation by TNFα was observed in cells incubated with DETA-NO or SNAP (Fig. 5 C). This effect of NO appeared to be cGMP-dependent inasmuch as it was prevented by incubation with the NO donors in the presence of ODQ and was mimicked by 8-Br-cGMP. Incubation of DC with exogenous C2 ceramide (80 μm, 48 h) resulted in a statistically significant, persistent inhibition of FITC-dextran endocytosis with respect to that observed in untreated, control cells (Fig.6 A). When DC were incubated with exogenous C2 ceramide in the presence of DETA-NO (Fig.6) or SNAP (Fig. 6 B), the inhibition of endocytosis by the lipid metabolite was reduced. This effect of the NO donors was prevented by incubation with ODQ and mimicked by 8-Br-cGMP (Fig.6 B). These results indicate that the action of NO is exerted not only via the inhibition of ceramide generation by TNFα but also via a mechanism(s) active downstream of it. This other effect of NO appears to be also dependent on cGMP generation. Expression of iNOS and generation of NO by DC has been reported in rodents in vivo (26.Downing J.E. Virag L. Jones I.W. Immunology. 1998; 95: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and in purified DC after treatment with IFNγ and LPS (13.Lu L. Bonham C.A. Chambers F.G. Watkins S.C. Hoffman R.A. Simmons R.L. Thomson A.W. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3577-3586PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Xiao B.G. Huang Y.M. Xu L.Y. Ishikawa M. Link H. J. Neuroimmunol. 1999; 97: 25-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We investigated whether exposure of human-derived DC to cytokines and LPS also induces expression of iNOS and generation of NO. Immature DC were treated for 48 h in the presence or absence of human TNFα, human IFNγ (100 units/ml), and LPS (10 μg/ml), alone or combined as detailed in the legend to Fig. 7. NO generation was measured in the culture medium as nitrite formation, and the expression of iNOS was analyzed by Western blotting of DC lysates. Neither before nor after any of the treatments applied was any iNOS expression in DC or nitrite accumulation in the medium detected (Fig. 7 and not shown). We have investigated in DC the effects of NO and the mechanism of its action in the regulation of endocytosis. We have used immature human monocyte-derived DC that efficiently endocytose antigens in vitro (14.Sallusto F. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (4522) Google Scholar). These cells were exposed to TNFα, which triggered anin vitro maturation process, as confirmed by the concentration-dependent reduction of endocytic ability and by the up-regulation of molecules involved in T cell activation (1.Banchereau J. Steinman R.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (12349) Google Scholar,14.Sallusto F. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (4522) Google Scholar). The kinetics of endocytosis was studied by cell exposure to FITC-dextran. In immature DC, NO, generated either by activated N9 phagocytes or by two NO donors, DETA-NO and SNAP, did not modify endocytosis per se. In the presence of TNFα, however, NO reversed the inhibitory effect of the cytokine, i.e. it maintained the ability of DC to internalize FITC-dextran. Because this effect of NO was prevented by ODQ, an inhibitor of the soluble guanylyl cyclase, and mimicked by the membrane permeant analogue of cGMP, 8-Br-cGMP, we conclude that NO acts via a cGMP-dependent mechanism. The maturation process of DC is triggered by TNFα via activation of its p55 receptor (15.Sallusto F. Cella M. Danieli C. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (2191) Google Scholar), which in many cell types induces sphingomyelin breakdown with resulting accumulation of the lipid messenger ceramide (28.Kolesnick R.N. Kršnke M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 643-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 29.Perry D.K. Hannun Y.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The involvement of latter in the inhibition of endocytosis was documented by previous studies with immature DC, where ceramide inhibited endocytosis of various substrates, namely lucifer yellow, horseradish peroxidase, and FITC-dextran, suggesting its role as the messenger by which TNFα down-regulates this process (17.Sallusto F. Nicolò C. De Maria R. Corinti S. Testi R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2411-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). We thus investigated whether the maintenance by NO of the endocytic ability in TNFα-treated DC was due to inhibition of ceramide accumulation. Consistent with this possibility, we found that TNFα induced a time-dependent accumulation of ceramide, which was inhibited by both NO donors and NO released by activated N9 cells. cGMP generation accounted for this effect of NO, as demonstrated by experiments with ODQ and 8-Br-cGMP. To analyze whether inhibition of ceramide accumulation by NO was the only event responsible for its ability to reverse the effect of TNFα on the endocytic ability of DC, experiments were carried out with the membrane permeant C2-ceramide. This lipid inhibited endocytosis of FITC-dextran in a persistent way, yet NO (but not NO plus ODQ) and 8-Br-cGMP were still able to reverse this effect. This finding indicates that the action of NO on endocytosis can be explained not only by its cGMP-dependent inhibition of ceramide accumulation but also by additional effects on the signal transduction pathway activated by TNFα/ceramide, also mediated through cGMP. The molecular target(s) of this further action by NO/cGMP remain(s) to be established. These results indicate that the inhibition by NO, via cGMP, of the TNFα-induced down-regulation of endocytosis is exerted at multiple levels along the signal transduction cascade triggered by this cytokine. NO and cGMP function therefore as wide inhibitors of the action of TNFα on endocytosis rather than as selective regulators of one single transductional event. NO generation in peripheral tissues occurs as a consequence of various stimuli (2.MacMicking J. Xie Q. Nathan C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 323-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3501) Google Scholar, 5.Moncada S. Higgs E.A. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1319-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 6.Gross S.S. Wolin M.S. Annu.

Huang F.P. Al-Alem U.A. Chan W.L. Liew F.Y. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 825-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The events we describe, i.e. the regulation of endocytosis by NO through cGMP, might enable DC to prolong their antigen uptake function at the site of inflammation and therefore modify the ensuing immune responses in the lymphoid organs. So far, the role of NO in the maturation process of DC has been investigated in vitro in the murine system by measuring antigen presentation as well as the ensuing T cell proliferation after cell exposure to cytokines, which results in expression of iNOS (seee.g. 13). Both these functions were found to be impaired by the generation of NO by DC themselves, suggesting an overall inhibitory role for the messenger on DC maturation (see Ref. 30.Bonham C.A. Lu L. Hoffman R.A. Simmons R.L. Thompson A.W. Transplant. Proc. 1997; 29: 1116-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar for review). These data appear consistent with the mechanism of action by NO elucidated here for human DC, because maintenance of endocytosis, characteristic of an immature phenotype, is expected to be revealed in vitro as a reduced ability to stimulate preprimed T cells. Regulation by NO of human DC function might, however, be different. To our knowledge, iNOS expression and NO generation by these cells have not been reported, except in primary biliary cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (31.Yamamoto K. Akbar S.M. Masumoto T. Onji M. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1998; 114: 94-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 32.Ninomiya T. Akbar S.M. Masumoto T. Horiike N. Onji M. J. Hepatol. 1999; 31 (331): 323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Consistently, we could detect neither expression of iNOS nor NO generation by human DC exposed to various combinations of cytokines and LPS. Regulation of human DC might therefore depend on exogenous NO, generated at the site of infection by macrophages as a result of their activation by cytokine during the inflammatory response (33.McInnes I.B. Leung B.P. Field M. Wei X.Q. Huang F.P. Sturrock R.D. Kinninmonth A. Weidner J. Mumford R. Liew F.Y. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1519-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Because the functional effects of TNFα on human DC appear to be reversible and reinducible (16.Nelson E.L. Strobl S. Subleski J. Prieto D. Kopp W.C. Nelson P.J. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2021-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), NO might maintain endocytosis of antigens as long as DC are confined to the inflammation site, tuning their response to this cytokine and possibly also to other maturative stimuli. After egress from the inflammation site, DC would no longer be exposed to NO and could therefore down-regulate their endocytic ability to prevent any interference by irrelevant self-antigens captured during migration to lymphoid organs (1.Banchereau J. Steinman R.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (12349) Google Scholar). In conclusion, NO, acting on human DC in a paracrine fashion, may contribute to enhance immune responses, whereas disregulation of its homeostasis, with its generation under severe pathological conditions in DC (31.Yamamoto K. Akbar S.M. Masumoto T. Onji M. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1998; 114: 94-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 32.Ninomiya T. Akbar S.M. Masumoto T. Horiike N. Onji M. J.

Phosphatidylinositol kinase and phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (PIPK)1 in particular are thought to be important for the spatiotemporal production of each phosphoinositide that directly controls a variety of functions. The lipid kinases, which commit at the final step in the synthetic pathway of PI(4,5)P2, PIPKs have been identified and characterized. From their biochemical characteristics, they have been divided into two subtypes (type I and type II) (8.Bazenet C., E. Ruano A.R. Brockman J.L. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18012-18022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Primary sequences of type I and II PIPK revealed that these lipid kinases are conserved from yeast to mammal and form a family distinct from other lipid kinases (9.Boronenkov I.V. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2881-2884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 10.Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Kizuki N. Katagiri H. Yazaki Y. Asano T. Oka Y. J. Biol.

Ikonomov O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In data bases, sequences that seem to belong to this lipid kinase family are found also in fission yeast, nematode, and fruit fly, as well as in higher plants. A comparison of the primary sequences of types I and II PIPK revealed that these two subtypes are not so closely related (28–33%), whereas isoforms of the same subtype are highly homologous to each other (66–78%). In addition, type II PIPK shows relatively low enzymatic activity for PIP isolated from natural phospholipids as a substrate. A recent study has succeeded in explaining these differences between types I and II PIPKs. Ramehet al. (18.Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) showed that type II PIPK is a PI5P 4-kinase (PIP4K), and type I isoform is exactly a PI4P 5-kinase (PIP5K). They also proved the existence of PI5P in vivo, a novel phosphoinositide that had not been identified because of its trace amount in the cell and of its close elution time with PI4P in a separation system by high pressure liquid chromatography (18.Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a broad substrate specificity of PIPK in vitrohas also been reported. Type II PIP4K is able to phosphorylate PI3P to produce PI(3,4)P2. Type I PIP5K produces both PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,5)P2 from PI3P and PI(3,4,5)P3 from PI(3,4)P2 (18.Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C.

Moreover, type I PIP5K is also shown to phosphorylate PI at the d-5 position to produce PI5P (20.Tolias K.F. Rameh L.E. Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Chen J. Prestwich G.D. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18040-18046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), suggesting that type I PIP5K is a candidate for the kinase that produces PI5P in vivo. It is already known that there are three classes of PI3K, each of which differs in substrate specificity (5.Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Class I PI3Ks has a broad substrate specificity and is able to phosphorylate PI, PI4P, and PI(4,5)P2 at the D-3 position, whereas class II PI3Ks phosphorylate PI and PI4P but not PI(4,5)P2. Class III PI3Ks consisting of yeast VPS34p and its mammalian homolog phosphorylate only PI and thus produce only PI3P. Furthermore, PI3Ks are known to have a Mn2+-dependent protein kinase activity. One class I PI3K, p110α, phosphorylates p85α regulatory subunit at Ser-608 in the presence of Mn2+ (21.Carpenter C.L. Auger K.R. Duckworth B.C. Hou W.M. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell.

In the case of p110γ and -δ, autophosphorylation of the catalytic subunit occurs most predominantly (23.Stoyanova S. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Kirsch C. Hanck T. Klinger R. Wetzker R. Wymann M.P. Biochem.

Upon treatment with wortmannin or a point mutation within p110 which diminishes its lipid kinase activity, the protein kinase activity is also lost, suggesting the latter activity is based on almost the same mechanism as the former (22.Dhand R.

Upon autophosphorylation, lipid kinase activities of p110α and p110δ were strongly suppressed, indicating a mechanism for down-regulation through phosphorylation (21.Carpenter C.L. Auger K.R.

The lipid kinase activity of VPS34p is not affected by autophosphorylation (23.Stoyanova S. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Kirsch C. Hanck T. Klinger R. Wetzker R. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 25.Stack J.H. Emr S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31552-31562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence has been presented for the protein phosphorylation of the PIPK family. In platelets, PIP4KIIα has been shown to be phosphorylated, and a relationship between its phosphorylation state and lipid kinase activity has been suggested (26.Hinchliffe K.A. Irvine R.F. Divecha N. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that translocation of PIP4KIIα to the cytoskeletal fraction of platelets in response to thrombin is inhibited by treatment with okadaic acid, suggesting that protein dephosphorylation is involved in this process (27.Hinchliffe K.A. Irvine R.F. Divecha N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6516-6524Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). PIP4KIIγ has been shown to be phosphorylated in vivo, resulting in a shift of electrophoretic mobility (16.Itoh T. Ijuin T. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20292-20299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The level of phosphorylation is elevated in response to mitogenic stimulation such as that by serum, epidermal growth factor, or platelet-derived growth factor (16.Itoh T. Ijuin T. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20292-20299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, type II PI4K and type I PIP5K activities are co-immunoprecipitated with protein kinase Cμ in COS-7 cells (28.Nishikawa K. Toker A. Wong K. Marignani P.A. Johannes F.J. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23126-23133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The association is dependent on the protein kinase activity of protein kinase Cμ. These results show a close relationship between both subtypes of PIPK and the protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation event and also suggest that protein phosphorylation controls the intracellular localization of PIPK as well as its lipid kinase activity. Here, we show that PIP5KI has a protein kinase activity. PIP5KI isoforms expressed both in COS-7 cells and in Escherichia coli autophosphorylate in vitro. The autophosphorylation level is enhanced specifically in the presence of PI. Lipid kinase activity of PIP5KI is strongly suppressed after the autophosphorylation in the presence of PI. These results suggest that the enzymatic activity of PIP5KI is regulated by its intrinsic protein kinase activity. PIP and PIP2 were purified from bovine spinal cord as described (29.Schacht J. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 1063-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were used as >99% pure PI4P and PI(4,5)P2, respectively. PA, PI, PC, and PS were purchased from Doosan Serdary Research Laboratories. PI3P was purchased from Matreya, Inc. Synthetic PI5P, PI(3,4)P2, and PI(3,4,5)P3 were generously donated by Dr. Watanabe (Ehime University). [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. The polyvinylidene difluoride membranes used for Western blot analysis were from Nihon Eido. Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was from Qiagen. The thin layer chromatography silica plates and cellulose plates were from Merck. Phosphoamino acid standards (Ser(P), Thr(P), and Tyr(P)) were from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-Myc antibody and anti-penta-His antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Qiagen, respectively. His-tagged forms of mouse PIP5KIβ and rat PIP4KIIα were constructed by insertion of each cDNA intoSalI-BamHI site of pQE32 andSalI-PstI site of pQE31 vector, respectively. GST fusion proteins of mouse PIP5KIα and PIP5KIα(K138A) were constructed by insertion of each cDNA intoXhoI-NotI site of pGEX4T-3 vector. Myc-tagged forms of mouse PIP5KIα, -β, -γ, and rat PIP4KIIα were constructed by insertion into SalI-BamHI site of pCMV-Myc. Myc-PIP4KIIβ and -γ were constructed as described (16.Itoh T. Ijuin T. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20292-20299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Expression of recombinant proteins in E. coli and purification in the native condition were as described previously (15.Castellino A.M. Parker G.J. Boronenkov I.V. Anderson R.A. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5861-5870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Transfection into COS-7 cells and immunoprecipitation of overexpressed proteins were also described previously (16.Itoh T. Ijuin T. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20292-20299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Purified proteins expressed inE. coli or immunoprecipitated proteins from cell lysate were incubated in a reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) at room temperature for 30 min. When the effect of the phospholipids on the protein kinase activity of PIPKs was studied, 50 μm (final concentration) of each phospholipid was added to the reaction mixture. After the incubation, the reaction mixture was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the protein phosphorylation was observed by autoradiography or quantified by an image analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji). Myc-PIP5KIs were transfected into COS-7 cells and cultured for 24 h. Then the culture medium was changed to phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and cells were cultured for 30 min. [32P]Orthophosphate (0.2 mCi/ml) was then added, and the cells were labeled for 24 h. Labeled cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and Myc-PIP5KIs were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The bands corresponding to Myc-PIP5KIs were cut out and hydrolyzed in 6n HCl for 1 h at 110 °C. The resulting amino acids, together with standard phosphoamino acids, were spotted on TLC plates and separated by electrophoresis in pH 1.9 buffer (2.2% formic acid, 7.8% acetic acid) for the first dimension and pH 3.5 buffer (5% acetic acid, 0.5% pyridine) for the second dimension. The labeled phosphoamino acids were detected by autoradiography. The positions of the standard phosphoamino acids were detected by ninhydrin staining. The lipid kinase reaction and detection of phosphorylated products were described previously (16.Itoh T. Ijuin T. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20292-20299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, PIPKs and substrate lipids (50 μm) were incubated in a kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) at room temperature. After the lipids had been extracted by addition of 1 n HCl and chloroform/methanol (2:1), phosphorylated lipids were separated by TLC and observed by autoradiography. Myc-tagged form of PIPKIα was immunoprecipitated from the lysate of overexpressing COS-7 cells. The immunoprecipitates were washed first with lysis buffer and then with alkaline phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), after which 2 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (CIAP) (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.) or storage buffer for CIAP (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, 50% glycerol) was added. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 60 min. To evaluate the effect of CIAP treatment on lipid kinase activity of Myc-PIPKIα, the immunoprecipitates were washed five times with kinase buffer before lipid kinase assay. To establish whether PIPK has any protein kinase activity, we carried out anin vitro kinase assay using each isoform of the PIPK members. Myc-tagged PIP5KIα, -β, and -γ or PIP4KIIα, -β, and -γ were transfected in COS-7 cells, respectively, immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody, and incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of Mg2+. All of the PIPK isoforms tested were phosphorylated, whereas no other phosphorylated protein was detected (Fig. 1). Furthermore, this phosphorylation was also observed when His-tagged PIP5KIα, -β, and -γ expressed in E. coli were used as enzyme sources (Fig.2 A), showing that no other co-immunoprecipitated protein kinase is involved. From these results, we concluded that type I isoforms of PIPK possess a protein kinase activity and autophosphorylate by themselves. On the other hand, we did not detect any phosphorylation when His-tagged type II PIP4Ks (PIP4KIIα, -β, and -γ) expressed in E. coli were used (data not shown). Thus we conclude that the phosphorylation of PIP4KIIs observed in Fig. 1 is due to some co-immunoprecipitated protein kinase present in amounts below the detectable limit. Thus, the autophosphorylating activity seems to be a unique characteristic of the type I PIPK isoform.Figure 2Autophosphorylation of PIP5KI is specifically stimulated by PI. A, His-PIP5KIβ was subjected to anin vitro kinase reaction in the absence (control) or presence of 50 μm of PA, PC, PI, and PS. B,the same analysis was carried out in the absence (control) or presence of various phosphoinositides including PI, PIP (PI3P , PI4P), PIP2 (PI (3,4)P2, PI (4,5)P2), and PIP3 (PI (3,4,5)P3) at 50 μm. A typical result corresponding to three independent assays is shown.C, a dose-response curve for the PI-dependent autophosphorylation of His-PIP5KIβ. In vitro kinase reaction was carried out at various concentrations of PI. The level of phosphorylation is indicated in an arbitrary unit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As the lipid kinase activity of PIP5KI is known to be activated by PA (30.Jenkins G.H. Fisette P.L. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11547-11554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we next examined the possibility that the protein kinase activity of PIP5KI is also modified by any phospholipid. The His-tagged form of PIP5KIβ was subjected to anin vitro kinase assay in the absence or presence of 50 μm PA, PC, PI and PS, respectively. PI strongly stimulated the activity for autophosphorylation (Fig. 2 A), whereas the other phospholipids including PA had no effect. Furthermore, this activation of autophosphorylation is highly specific to PI as phosphatidylinositol phosphates such as PI3P, PI4P, PI5P (not shown), PI(3,4)P2, PI(4,5)P2, and PI(3,4,5)P3 did not have such an effect (Fig.2 B). Finally, we found that the autophosphorylation was stimulated by PI in a dose-dependent manner, most effectively at 10 μm PI (Fig. 2 C). These results show that PIP5KI has a PI-dependent protein kinase activity, a quite unique dependence on phospholipid different from that of any other protein kinase. We next tried to determine whether the PI-dependent activation of autophosphorylation is a common characteristic of all PIP5KI isoforms. Myc-tagged forms of PIP5KIα, -β, and -γ were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody and then subjected to an in vitro kinase reaction in the presence or absence of 50 μm PI. As shown in Fig.3, all type I isoforms were revealed to have PI dependence for their autophosphorylating activity. This result indicates that PI-dependent protein kinase activity is a specific characteristic common to all PIP5KI isoforms. PI 3-kinases have also been reported to possess a protein kinase activity (21.Carpenter C.L. Auger K.R. Duckworth B.C. Hou W.M. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1657-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 22.Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M.

Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1292-1302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these cases, substitutions of the amino acids essential for the lipid kinase activity diminish the protein kinase activity as well. To test whether the catalytic residue of PIP5KI is also involved in the protein kinase activity, a lipid kinase-negative mutant (K138A) of PIP5KIα was tested. Lys-138 in PIP5KIα is a conserved amino acid corresponding to the Lys that binds the α-phosphate of ATP in protein kinases such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase. A substitution of this residue with Ala results in complete loss of lipid kinase activity (14.Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Kizuki N. Wada T. Yazaki Y. Asano T. Oka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8741-8748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). GST fusion protein of wild type and the mutant (K138A) PIP5KIα were expressed in E. coli and purified by glutathione-Sepharose and then subjected to in vitro kinase assay. GST-PIP5KIα (K138A) lost almost all its lipid kinase activity (both PI 5- and PIP 5-kinase) (Fig. 4 A, and Ref.14.Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Kizuki N. Wada T. Yazaki Y. Asano T. Oka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8741-8748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). At the same time, the lipid kinase-negative mutant also lost PI-dependent protein kinase activity (Fig. 4 B). This indicates that the lipid kinase and the protein kinase activity of PIP5KI are based on the same structural mechanism for catalysis. We next studied the divalent cation dependence of the PI-dependent autophosphorylation of PIP5KI. An in vitro kinase reaction was started in the presence of various divalent cations. As shown in Fig.5 A, PIP5KI preferred Mg2+ most, but it also utilized Mn2+ for autophosphorylation (Fig. 5 A). Under the same conditions, lipid kinase activities were also measured. The PIP 5-kinase activity of PIP5KI for PI(4,5)P2 production was exclusively dependent on Mg2+, whereas the PI 5-kinase activity for PI5P production was dependent on both Mg2+ and Mn2+ (Fig. 5 B). The same cation dependence of PI 5-kinase and PI-dependent autophosphorylation may indicate that both activities are based on a similar catalytic mechanism. We further investigated the effect of PI-dependent autophosphorylation on lipid kinase activity of PIP5KI. His-PIP5KIβ, which was immobilized on beads by an immunoprecipitation with anti-penta-His antibody, was subjected to in vitro kinase reaction with or without PI/PIP. After the reaction, the excess of ATP and PI/PIP was washed away, and lipid kinase activities (PI 5- and PIP 5-kinase activities) were measured. Fig.6 A shows that both lipid kinase activities were almost completely lost after autophosphorylation induced by PI. In contrast, the in vitro kinase reaction with ATP and PIP, which failed to enhance the autophosphorylation of PIP5KI, resulted in no change in the lipid kinase activities (Fig. 6,A and B). This indicates that the marked decrease in lipid kinase activity is not due to any denaturation of PIP5KI enzymatic activity during the lipid kinase reaction. Finally, the time course experiment showed that there is a negative relationship between the lipid kinase activity and the degree of PI-dependent autophosphorylation (Fig. 6 C). These results suggest that the PI-dependent autophosphorylation strongly down-regulates the lipid kinase activities of PIP5KI. To characterize further the protein kinase activity of PIP5KI, we carried out a phosphoamino acid analysis using Myc-PIP5KIα. We examined whether PIP5KI is phosphorylated in vivo by a metabolic 32P labeling of COS-7 cells that were transfected with Myc-PIP5KIα. Myc-PIP5KIα was immunoprecipitated and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 7 A). The result showed that PIP5KIα is a phosphoprotein in vivo. Myc-PIP5KIβ and Iγ were also revealed to be phosphorylated in vivo by the same experiment (not shown). We also found treatment with alkaline phosphatase restored the lipid kinase activity of PIP5KIα (Fig. 7 B). This together with the data in Fig. 6suggest that a portion of PIP5KIα is phosphorylated and down-regulated in vivo through autophosphorylation. Next, we cut out the phosphorylated band in Fig. 7 A and performed a phosphoamino acid analysis for Myc-PIP5KIα. Fig. 7 C shows that the phosphorylation in vivo occurred mainly on serine residues. The same assay after PI-dependent autophosphorylation of Myc-PIP5KIα in vitro revealed that the phosphorylation occurred on serine and, to a lesser extent, on threonine residues but not on tyrosine residues (Fig. 7 C). These results suggest that PIP5KI possesses a serine/threonine protein kinase activity in vitro, and its phosphorylation in vivo may be explained partly by the autophosphorylation of PIP5KI. The PIP kinase family has been reported to have a broad substrate specificity in vitro. PIP5KI is able to phosphorylate the D-5 position on not only PI4P but also PI, PI3P, and PI(3,4)P2 to produce PI5P, PI(3,4)P2, PI(3,5)P2, and PI(3,4,5)P3 (19.Zhang X. Loijens J.C. Boronenkov I.V. Parker G.J. Norris F.A. Chen J. Thum O. Prestwich G.D. Majerus P.W. Anderson R.A. J. Biol.

J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18040-18046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The broad substrate specificity of PIP5KI is similar to that of class I PI 3-kinases that also phosphorylate the D-3 position on PI, PI4P, PI5P, and PI(4,5)P2. Moreover, PI 3-kinase, including the class I subfamily, has been reported to possess a Mn2+-dependent protein kinase activity (21.Carpenter C.L. Auger K.R. Duckworth B.C. Hou W.M. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1657-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 22.Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K.

Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1292-1302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we tried to elucidate whether PIP5KI also possesses protein kinase activity. As we have demonstrated in this study, type I PIP5K transfected to COS-7 cells or produced by the E. coliexpression system was autophosphorylated in vitro, showing a protein kinase activity in addition to lipid kinase activity. These findings expand the paradigm of dual-specific kinases capable of phosphorylating both protein and lipid. In addition to the case with PI 3-kinase and PIP kinase in this study, there are some reports showing that the dual specificity toward protein and lipid substrates could be applicable to phosphatases as well. PTEN/MMAC1 is a putative tumor suppressor gene product homologous to protein tyrosine phosphatases such as CDC14, PTP-IV1, and CPTPH (31.Li J. Yen C. Liaw D. Podsypanina K. Bose S. Wang S.I. Puc J. Miliaresis C. Rodgers L. McCombie R. Bigner S.H. Giovanella B.C. Ittmann M. Tycko B. Hibshoosh H. Wigler M.H. Parsons R. Science. 1997; 275: 1943-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (4313) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been reported that PTEN/MMAC1 dephosphorylates the D-3 position of PI(3,4,5)P3 (32.Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2614) Google Scholar) as well as tyrosine-phosphorylated protein. These results indicate a close evolutionary relationship between protein- and lipid-kinases/phosphatases. However, there is no evidence that other lipid kinases, such as PI 4-kinase or diacylglycerol kinase, have protein kinase activity. Unlike PI 3-kinase or PTEN/MMAC1, the PIP kinases are dissimilar to any known protein kinase in primary structure. This still does not rule out the possibility that the PIP kinases are related to some protein kinase family members. Future work may reveal a close relationship between PIPK and other protein kinases in their tertiary structure. Furthermore, we observed that the autophosphorylation of PIP5KI was stimulated strongly and specifically by PI. The stimulation by PI was highly specific, and other polyphosphoinositides such as PIP, PIP2, and PIP3 did not have such an effect. Although the structural mechanism for PI-dependent autophosphorylation is unclear, the mechanism behind the down-regulation may be anticipated from the crystal structure of PIP4KIIβ reported by Hurley and co-workers (33.Rao V.D. Misra S. Boronenkov I.V. Anderson R.A. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1998; 94: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). PIP4KIIβ forms a flattened surface for interaction with PI5P in the lipid bilayer, and certain positively charged amino acids seem to be involved in the interaction with the phosphate group of the substrate phospholipid. When PI-induced autophosphorylation occurs at serine/threonine adjacent to those positively charged residues, the interaction between PIP5KI and phosphoinositides is interrupted, down-regulating the lipid kinase reaction. The protein kinase activity is only detected as an autophosphorylation of PIP5KI, and none of the protein substrates for this activity are currently unknown. By using His-PIP5KIβ, we did not observe any significant phosphorylation of protein substrate such as myelin basic protein or histone H1 (not shown). Recently, it was reported that the protein kinase activity of p110γ PI3-kinase is involved in the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (34.Bondeva T. Pirola L. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Rubio I. Wetzker R. Wymann M.P. Science. 1998; 282: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). This shows that the protein kinase activity of PI 3-kinase has roles for not only down-regulation of lipid kinase activity but also phosphorylation of any downstream target protein to transduce signals. Future work will answer the question about the existence of protein substrates for PIP5KI. We have shown that PIP5KI is phosphorylated (Fig. 7 A) and down-regulated (Fig. 7 B) in vivo in the resting cells. This phosphorylation is possibly caused by endogenous PI. Therefore, some phosphatases may be activated in response to extracellular stimuli and then dephosphorylate PIP5KIs. Indeed, we found that PIP5KI is dephosphorylated in response to lysophosphatidic acid, a typical agonist that induces inositol phospholipid turnover. 2S. J. Park, T. Itoh and T. Takenawa, manuscript in preparation. Subsequently, PIP5KI activities are increased, resulting in the synthesis of PI(4,5)P2. This down- and up-regulatory mechanism possibly functions in vivo. In summary, we found that type I PIPKs have protein kinase activities and autophosphorylate in a PI-dependent manner, and this phosphorylation down-regulates the lipid kinase activity of type I PIPK. These results show the general physiological mechanism by which lipid kinase is regulated through protein phosphorylation. At the same time, our results also show a possible regulation of type I PIPK activity that plays critical roles in inositol lipid-signaling systems."

The activase (nrdG gene) together withS-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) give rise to a glycyl radical in the NrdD component. A semi-reduced [4Fe-4S]+ cluster with an axially symmetric EPR signal was produced upon photochemical reduction of the activase. Air exposure of the reduced enzyme gave a [3Fe-4S]+ cluster. The Fe3S4 cluster was convertible to the EPR-active [4Fe-4S]+ cluster by renewed treatment with reducing agents, demonstrating a reversible [3Fe-4S]+- to-[4Fe-4S]+ cluster conversion without exogenous addition of iron or sulfide. Anaerobic reduction of the activase by a moderate concentration of dithionite also resulted in a semi-reduced [4Fe-4S]+cluster. Prolonged reduction gave an EPR-silent fully reduced state, which was enzymatically inactive. Both reduced states gave the [3Fe-4S]+ EPR signal after air exposure. The iron-sulfur cluster interconversion was also studied in the presence of AdoMet. The EPR signal of semi-reduced activase-AdoMet had rhombic symmetry and was independent of which reductant was applied, whereas the EPR signal of the [3Fe-4S]+ cluster after air exposure was unchanged. The results indicate that an AdoMet-mediated [4Fe-4S]+center is the native active species that induces the formation of a glycyl radical in the NrdD component.

These enzymes, coded by thenrdDG genes (7.Sun X. Harder J. Krook M. Jörnvall H. Sjöberg B.-M. Reichard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 8.Young P. Öhman M. Sjöberg B.-M. J. Biol.

Up to now, the activating protein (designated activase with an iron-sulfur cluster) of anaerobic RNR from Gram-negative Escherichia coli is the only nrdG gene product that has been investigated at a pure protein level. The activase of anaerobic RNR from Gram-positive Lactococcus lactis (10.Leenhouts K. Buist G. Bolhuis A. ten Berge A. Kiel J. Mierau I. Dabrowska M. Venema G. Kok J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) is a new activating enzyme that has recently been isolated (11.Torrents E. Buist G. Liu A. Eliasson R. Kok J. Gibert I. Gräslund A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2463-2471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The goal of this investigation of the activase from L. lactis in comparison with the activase from Gram-negative E. coli was to gain insight into the mechanism of the formation of a catalytically active glycyl radical in anaerobic ribonucleotide reductases. The two bacteria L. lactis and E. coli are extremely distantly related in evolution and are believed to have a common ancestor >2 billion years ago (cf. Ref. 11.Torrents E. Buist G. Liu A. Eliasson R. Kok J. Gibert I. Gräslund A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2463-2471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Comparison of the functional features of their anaerobic ribonucleotide reductases gives an interesting insight into how evolution has kept the principal features of the iron-sulfur/free radical chemistry more or less intact for such an enormous length of time. The nrdD and nrdG genes form an operon that codes for an active anaerobic RNR. The large NrdD component carries the catalytic and allosteric sites. The small NrdG component is an iron-sulfur protein that participates in the formation of the glycyl radical (12.Sun X. Eliasson R. Pontis E. Andersson J. Buist G. Sjöberg B.-M. Reichard P. J. Biol.

The molecular mass of the activase from L. lactis RNR is 23.3 kDa (199 amino acids)/polypeptide, whereas the molecular masses of the activating enzymes from anaerobic E. coli and bacteriophage T4 are 17.5 and 18 kDa, 2The amino acid sequence of anaerobic RNR activase from L. lactis can be accessed in the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank under accession number U73336. The molecular mass of the activase (NrdG) from bacteriophage T4 was predicted from the amino acid sequence deposited in the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank. The gene product of NrdD (but not that of nrdG) from bacteriophage T4 has been purified to homogeneity and investigated at a pure protein level. respectively. A protein-linked glycyl free radical responsible for initiation of physiological catalysis is located in the metal-free NrdD component (6.Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8383-8386Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The glycyl radical is formed by a complicated activation reaction requiring activase, AdoMet, NADPH, and an auxiliary reducing enzyme system (14.Harder J. Eliasson R. Pontis E. Ballinger M.D. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25548-25552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been found that photochemically reduced deazaflavin can successfully substitute for the reducing enzyme system and NADPH (15.Mulliez E. Fontecave M. Gaillard J. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2296-2299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, AdoMet is exclusively required for the purified activase to function (16.Eliasson R. Fontecave M. Jörnvall H. Krook M. Pontis E. Reichard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Anaerobic RNR thus falls into a super-group of AdoMet-dependent enzymes (17.Frey P.A. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), some of which carry protein-bound glycyl free radicals (18.Wagner A.F.V. Frey M. Neugebauer F.A. Schafer W. Knappe J. Proc. Natl.

It has been shown that homolytic cleavage of AdoMet is associated with an iron-sulfur complex in the activase from E. coli RNR and leads to formation of 5′-deoxyadenosine and methionine concomitant with the activation of the NrdD component for catalysis (14.Harder J. Eliasson R. Pontis E. Ballinger M.D. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25548-25552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies on anaerobic RNR from E. coli have implied that an Fe4S4 cluster is crucial for radical formation to occur (22.Ollagnier S. Mulliez E. Schmidt P.P. Eliasson R. Gaillard J.

The activase from E. coli is a mixture of monomer and dimer in the absence of NrdD (23.Tamarit J. Mulliez E. Meier C. Trautwein A. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31291-31296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It forms a tight α2β2-complex with NrdD, whereas such a tightly bound complex is not found in L. lactis anaerobic reductase (11.Torrents E. Buist G. Liu A. Eliasson R. Kok J. Gibert I. Gräslund A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2463-2471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). L. lactis anaerobic RNR contains a glycyl radical when activated (11.Torrents E.

The activase is virtually an apoprotein when purified to homogeneity. After incorporation of exogenous ferrous iron and sulfide, the activase is inactive and EPR-silent under O2-free conditions. Direct exposure of this iron-containing protein to air leads to a small fraction of EPR-observable species, due to a cuboidal [3Fe-4S]+ cluster that is associated with a minor fraction of iron in the protein. The majority of the iron-sulfur species remains EPR-silent. In previous work, we found that when the activase is photochemically reduced, it shows an EPR-observable [4Fe-4S]+ center (11.Torrents E.

Here we report that chemically reduced activase can exist in at least two different oxidation states. An interconversion between [3Fe-4S]+ and [4Fe-4S]+ clusters induced without adding exogenous iron has been followed by EPR spectroscopy in the presence and absence of AdoMet.

Reichard (Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden). In a typical experiment, cells were grown aerobically in Luria-Bertani medium containing kanamycin (75 μg/ml) at 30 °C and induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 0.4∼0.5A 600. Protein purification was carried out at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 50 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The packed cells were thawed together with lysozyme from egg white (1 mg/ml; Sigma) and the above buffer. Prior to streptomycin sulfate (3%) and ammonium sulfate (80% saturation) precipitation, the lysate was frozen three times in liquid nitrogen. After a 20-min centrifugation at 18,000 ×g, the pellet was resuspended and dialyzed in 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 50 mm KCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The sample was diluted to 5 mg/ml and then applied to a DEAE-cellulose column (DE52, Whatman). The column was rinsed with 1 column volume of the same buffer containing 50 mm KCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The active fractions were pooled with the elution buffer containing 0.2m KCl and further chromatographed on a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The activase-containing fractions were concentrated and dialyzed in an Amicon concentrator with a YM-3 membrane. All further steps were carried out anaerobically. The activase fraction from the Superdex column was incubated with Na2S and (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2·6H2O for 6 h in an ice bath under argon protection in a glove box continuously purged with argon (95%) and hydrogen (5%). Anaerobic desalting by a Sephadex G-25 column (30 ml, superfine; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and dialysis were carried out to remove unbound inorganic ions. The final solvent was 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 50 mm KCl and 1 mmdithiothreitol. The iron and sulfur assays have been described elsewhere (15.Mulliez E. Fontecave M. Gaillard J. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2296-2299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activase samples prepared by this method, after reconstitution with iron and sulfide, contained 4∼5 iron and 1.4∼2 sulfide ions/polypeptide. Activase concentrations are given per polypeptide dimer, unless otherwise indicated. The reconstituted NrdG component served as starting material for the biophysical studies. The enzyme assay has been described elsewhere (11.Torrents E. Buist G. Liu A. Eliasson R. Kok J. Gibert I. Gräslund A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2463-2471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Iron-sulfur determinations and enzyme assays were carried out by P. Reichard and R. Eliasson as described (11.Torrents E. Buist G. Liu A. Eliasson R. Kok J. Gibert I. Gräslund A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2463-2471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Reduction of the activase protein was accomplished by additions of aliquots of argon-saturated stock solution of sodium dithionite (10∼100 mm) using gas-tight Hamilton syringes and a manifold. Activase was made anaerobic by multiple rounds of gentle degassing and flushing with argon while on ice. Chemical reduction was allowed to proceed under a strictly argon-protected atmosphere at 22 ± 1 °C. The EPR tubes were frozen in liquid nitrogen for measurements by EPR spectroscopy. A deazaflavin derivative (dFl), 10-methyl-10H-pyrimido[4,5-b]quinoline-2,4-dione, was generously provided by Dr. J. Coves (University Joseph Fourier, Grenoble, France). 100 μm dFl was introduced into activase samples (50∼200 μm) in the dark. The samples were anaerobically irradiated by either a daylight lamp at 20 ± 1 °C or a halogen lamp from a Royal AF slide projector (ZETT, Germany) at 0 °C (ice bath) on a time scale from 0 to 80 min. X-band EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ESP 300 or Elexsys E-500 spectrometer, both equipped with continuous flow liquid helium cryostats (Oxford Instruments). A dual-mode resonator (ER4116DM) was used in the low temperature measurements. The microwave source operated in dual modes (9.45 and 9.62 GHz, corresponding to parallel and perpendicular mode EPR, respectively). A calibrated frequency counter and a Bruker ER035M NMR gaussmeter were used for the g-value determinations. Quantitation of the EPR signals was performed by double integration of the spectra recorded under nonsaturating conditions and by comparison of the double integrals with that of a standard sample of 1 mm CuCl2 and 10 mm EDTA. Microwave power saturation experiments were carried out by measuring the amplitude of the central component of the EPR signals at 10 K. Saturation curves were evaluated to yield a P 12parameter as described previously (24.Sahlin M. Gräslund A. Ehrenberg A. J. Magn. Reson. 1986; 67: 135-137Google Scholar). EPR powder simulations were achieved using the program SimFonia (Version 1.25, Bruker). This program allows interactive fitting of the simulated resonance pattern to an experimental one. It is based on the perturbation theory, assuming that the electronic Zeeman interaction is the largest, followed by zero-field splitting, the hyperfine interaction, and the nuclear quadrupole interaction. The nuclear hyperfine interaction is the smallest among the five considered interactions. L. lactis RNR activase, after reconstitution with iron and sulfide under strictly anaerobic conditions, is essentially EPR-silent (11.Torrents E. Buist G. Liu A. Eliasson R. Kok J. Gibert I. Gräslund A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2463-2471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). When the reconstituted activase was irradiated by light in the presence of dFl (pH 8.0), it gave an S = 1/2 EPR signal (Fig.1 A, upper trace) detectable up to ∼38 K. The signal had fast relaxation properties and axial symmetry with g ∥ = 2.040 andg ⊥ = 1.935 (TableI). All of these EPR properties are typical of a [4Fe-4S]+ cluster (25.Cammack R. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1992; 38: 281-322Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 26.Guigliarelli B. Bertrand P. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 47: 421-497Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The spinS = 1/2 ground state of the [4Fe-4S]+cluster arises from an Fe2+-Fe2+ pair and a localized or delocalized (27.Beinert H. Holm R.H. Münck E. Science. 1997; 277: 653-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar) mixed-valence Fe2+-Fe3+ pair. Strong light from a commercial projector was found to be more effective than that of daylight lamps for generation of the EPR signal. After the signal intensity reached a maximum, further illumination did not bring more signal intensity (Fig.1 B). We observed up to 1.1 mmclusters/mm activase protein (polypeptide dimer). Since these samples had a total of 4∼5 iron and 1.4∼2 sulfide ions/polypeptide, this corresponds to about the maximal amount that could be formed in this reduced form (the number varied slightly between different preparations).Table IEPR properties of the iron-sulfur centers of anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase activase in L. lactisIron-sulfur speciesSpin state (S)gvalueP 12 at 10 KSpectrum widthaFrom the maximum of the low-field peak to the minimum of the high-field peak.TemperatureMaximum yield (per activase)g xxg yyg zzOptimalMaximummWmilliteslasK[3Fe-4S]+, [3Fe-4S]+-AdoMet1/22.0042.0152.0330.134.85∼10<300.8[3Fe-4S]+ (E. coli)bFrom Refs. 13, 22, 23, and 45.

Open table in a new tab Exposure of the photochemically reduced activase to air resulted in the EPR signal shown in Fig. 1 C, observable only below 30 K (Table I). The EPR signal is very similar to those of the extensively studied [3Fe-4S]+ clusters in c-aconitase (28.Kennedy M.C. Mende-Mueller L. Blondin G.A. Beinert H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11730-11734Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar,29.Beinert H. Kennedy M.C. Stout C.D. Chem.

This signal is characteristic of an oxidized [3Fe-4S]+ cluster and accounts for >0.8 mm clusters in 1 mm activase. Therefore, the reduced [4Fe-4S]+ cluster almost quantitatively converted to the [3Fe-4S]+ cluster. In addition, a weakg = 4.3 signal attributed to adventitious ferric ions was also observed (data not shown). In comparison, the oxidizedE. coli anaerobic RNR contains a [3Fe-4S]+cluster with a similar but not identical EPR signal (22.Ollagnier S. Mulliez E. Schmidt P.P. Eliasson R. Gaillard J. Deronzier C.

Rev. 1996; 96: 2335-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The reduced [4Fe-4S]+ EPR signal reappeared after photochemical reduction in the absence of exogenous iron and sulfide. A second exposure of the reduced sample to air again gave the [3Fe-4S]+ cluster, but with a lower yield than the first exposure (60∼80% yield retained in different experiments). These results demonstrate that the 3-iron cluster must be able to easily pick up an endogenous iron ion upon reduction and assemble a [4Fe-4S]+ cluster in exceptionally high yield. After anaerobic incubation of the reconstituted pure enzyme with a 100-fold excess of dithionite (10 mm, pH 8.0) for 1 h, there was no EPR-detectable species in the L. lactis activase in either perpendicular or parallel mode EPR. Under similar reduction conditions, the activase from the E. coli anaerobic enzyme has been shown to have an S= 1/2 EPR-visible [4Fe-4S]+ center (22.Ollagnier S. Mulliez E. Schmidt P.P. Eliasson R. Gaillard J. Deronzier C. Bergman T. Gräslund A. Reichard P. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24216-24223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To explore possible reasons for this apparent deviation between the two activases, a lower concentration of dithionite (1 mm, 10-fold excess) was incubated with the reconstituted L. lactis activase. The mixture was frozen in liquid N2 after various reaction times for the EPR measurements. This series of experiments gave EPR-observable results below 32 K (Fig. 1 B). A representative spectrum (g ∥ = 2.024 andg ⊥ = 1.934) is shown in Fig. 1 A(lower trace). The EPR signal originates from anS = 1/2 ground state species that has fast relaxing characteristics. The optimum temperature for the EPR signal is ∼12 K (Table I). It was broadened at high temperatures, typical of a [4Fe-4S]+ cluster (25.Cammack R. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1992; 38: 281-322Crossref Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 26.Guigliarelli B. Bertrand P. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1999; 47: 421-497Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The EPR signal was observed at a maximum of 0.25 clusters/activase. The signal intensity decayed with continued reduction (Fig. 1 B), indicating the existence of a further, fully reduced form of the activase. This fully reduced form should be the one formed also in the 100-fold excess reduction, where it was reached much more rapidly. We hypothesized that the short-lived semi-reduced form had probably been quickly bypassed under high dithionite concentration (10 mm). In contrast to the case for the E. colianaerobic RNR enzyme, a relatively low concentration of dithionite and short reaction time must therefore be applied to obtain the EPR-active [4Fe-4S]+ cluster-containing form of L. lactisRNR activase. This indicates a considerable difference of redox potentials between the two activating enzymes. Exposure of the semi-reduced activase (0.25 clusters/activase) to air rapidly led to a large EPR signal (∼0.7–0.8 spins/activase), identical to the spectrum shown in Fig.1 C, and so did the fully reduced form. The characteristicg = 2.015 EPR signal has been assigned to a [3Fe-4S]+ cluster. The different signal intensities of the two successively formed EPR-active [4Fe-4S]+ and [3Fe-4S]+ clusters (0.25 and 0.7∼0.8 mmclusters/mm protein, respectively) suggest that both the semi-reduced and fully reduced forms of the activase can be oxidized by air and produce the g = 2.015 EPR signal characteristic of the [3Fe-4S]+ cluster. In contrast, the reconstituted activase (the starting material before the reduction) gave EPR signals corresponding to <0.1 cluster/activase for [3Fe-4S]+ upon admission of air (11.Torrents E. Buist G. Liu A. Eliasson R. Kok J. Gibert I. Gräslund A. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2463-2471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A direct conclusion is that the majority of the FeS clusters in the dithionite-reduced sample differ distinctly from those of the reconstituted protein, despite the fact that both are EPR-silent. After returning to the anaerobic status, the dithionite-reduced and subsequently air-oxidized sample was incubated with 10-fold excess dithionite for a second time. Again, the semi-reduced S= 1/2 signal ([4Fe-4S]+ cluster) and the fully reduced EPR-silent state were reproduced in succession. The second exposure of the activase to air again restored the EPR-active [3Fe-4S]+ cluster, but with lower yield than the first exposure (60∼80% yield retained). Concomitant with the appearance of less [3Fe-4S]+, we observed an enlarged g= 4.3 EPR signal. A striking observation is that no extra iron or sulfide was required for the [3Fe-4S]+-to-[4Fe-4S]+ cluster interconversion to proceed. Addition of equimolar exogenous Fe2+ resulted in precipitation of the samples. Scheme FS1 summarizes the relationship between different redox forms that have been observed in L. lactis activase and, in particular, their reversibility. The [4Fe-4S]+-containing activase had a significant activating activity together with AdoMet in terms of making the essential glycyl radical in the NrdD protein, whereas the fully reduced activase had no such activity (data not shown). The fully reduced form, derived from prolonged dithionite treatment, is therefore an inactive state of the L. lactis enzyme. A completely new EPR signal with rhombic symmetry was observed in the activase reduced by a moderate concentration of dithionite or dFl plus light in the presence of equimolar AdoMet (Fig.2, traces B and D). Surprisingly, in the absence of AdoMet, an identical EPR signal could be produced by dithionite reduction in the presence of 30% glycerol (Fig. 2, trace E). Similar to the EPR signals in the absence of AdoMet in the reduced activase, the new rhombic signal started to broaden at high temperatures and was best observed around 10 K (TableI). The accumulation of the new signals in the presence of AdoMet was relatively slower (Fig. 3) compared with the data in Fig. 1 B in the absence of AdoMet and glycerol under otherwise identical conditions. The new rhombic EPR signal obtained in the presence of AdoMet or glycerol had relatively slow relaxation properties at 10 K with P 12 ≈ 0.4 mW compared with P 12 > 10 mW for the axial signals seen with only reductants present. The signal is assigned to a [4Fe-4S]+ moiety. The spectra in Fig. 2 (traces A and B) were reproduced by simulation, usingS 1 = S 2 =S 3 = 2 and S 4 = 5/2 for the individual nuclear spins of the iron ions in conjunctio"

Sequence analysis of the genome of this pathogen failed to identify open reading frames potentially coding for proteins with a 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase activity. The putative product of the HP602 open reading frame, reported as an endonuclease III, shares extensive amino acid sequence homology with some bacterial members of this family and has the canonic active site helix-hairpin-helix-GPD motif. Surprisingly, this predicted H. pylori endonuclease III encodes a 25,220-Da protein able to release 3-methyladenine, but not oxidized bases, from modified DNA. MagIII has no abasic site lyase activity and displays the substrate specificity of the 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase type I of Escherichia coli (Tag) because it is not able to recognize 7-methylguanine or hypoxanthine as substrates. The expression of the magIII open reading frame in null 3-methyladenine glycosylase E. coli (tag alkA) restores to this mutant partial resistance to alkylating agents. MagIII-deficient H. pylori cells show an alkylation-sensitive phenotype. H. pylori wild type cells exposed to alkylating agents present an adaptive response by inducing the expression of magIII. MagIII is thus a novel bacterial member of the endonuclease III family, which displays biochemical properties not described for any of the members of this group until now.

DNA, the repository of this information in all cells, is constantly exposed to chemical challenges (1.Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4378) Google Scholar). A variety of reactive intracellular and environmental compounds can induce modifications in the DNA bases. If left uncorrected, these lesions may cause mutations or impair DNA replication. In the case of alkylating agents, such as the cellular methyl donorS-adenosylmethionine or genotoxic compounds such as dimethylsulfate (DMS),1methylmethanesulfonate (MMS), orN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), they can react nonenzymatically with DNA to produce 7-methylguanine (7-MeG) and 3-methyladenine (3-MeA) among other alkylated bases (2.Rydberg B. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In particular, 3-MeA posses a serious problem to the cell because it blocks DNA synthesis (3.Karran P. Lindahl T. Ofsteng I. Evensen G.B. Seeberg E. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 140: 101-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 4.Boiteux S. Huisman O. Laval J. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2569-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 5.Larson K. Sahm J. Shenkar R. Strauss B. Mutat. Res. 1985; 150: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 6.O'Connor T.R. Boiteux S. Laval J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 5879-5894Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To eliminate this kind of modified base, most cells possess monofunctional DNA glycosylases that specifically recognize and excise the methylated bases from DNA by cleavage of the C1′-N glycosylic bond. This first step of base excision repair is followed by the repair of the resulting abasic (AP) site by excision/replacement DNA synthesis. At least four different classes of 3-MeA glycosylases have been described, based on their sequence and substrate specificities (7.Seeberg E. Berdal K.G. Hickson I.D. Base Excision Repair of DNA Damage. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX1997: 151-168Google Scholar). All of these are low molecular weight enzymes, and no associated AP lyase activity has been attributed to any of them. In Escherichia coli, the two first classes are represented. Class I is defined by the product of the tag gene that codes for a constitutive 3-MeA DNA glycosylase (8.Riazuddin S. Lindahl T. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2110-2118Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 9.Thomas L. Yang C.H. Goldthwait D.A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1162-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Tag is quite specific for the removal of 3-MeA, although 3-MeG would also be excised with a much lower efficiency in vitro (10.Bjelland S. Bjoras M. Seeberg E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2045-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Class II is typified by the AlkA enzyme of E. coli. There is no amino acid sequence similarity between class I and II 3-MeA DNA glycosylases. AlkA has a much broader substrate specificity, being able to release not only 3-MeA but also 7-MeG, 3-MeG, 7-MeA, andO 2-methylpyrimidines (11.McCarthy T.V. Karran P. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In the last few years, it has been found that AlkA has the ability to act on a variety of modified bases other than the classical alkylation damaged. Among those, the alkA product can release oxidized bases from DNA (12.Bjelland S. Birkeland N.K. Benneche T. Volden G. Seeberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30489-30495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as well as deamination products of adenine such as hypoxanthine (13.Saparbaev M. Laval J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5873-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) or ethenopurines (14.Matijasevic Z. Stering A. Niu T.Q. Austin-Ritchie P. Ludlum D.B. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2249-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 15.Saparbaev M. Kleibl K. Laval J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3750-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Berdal et al. (16.Berdal K.G. Johansen R.F. Seeberg E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) have shown that AlkA is even able to release normal bases from DNA. Another difference with Tag resides in the fact that alkA is induced by treatment of the cells with alkylating agents (7.Seeberg E. Berdal K.G. Hickson I.D. Base Excision Repair of DNA Damage. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX1997: 151-168Google Scholar). This induction occurs through activation of the alkA promoter by the Ada protein. Class III is typified by the mammalian methylpurine DNA glycosylases. These enzymes are biochemically quite similar to AlkA but differ markedly in their primary sequence. The recent determination of the crystal structures for the human 3-MeA glycosylase AAG (17.Lau A.Y. Scharer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1998; 95: 249-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and the bacterial AlkA (18.Labahn J. Scharer O.D. Long A. Ezaz-Nikpay K. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T.E. Cell. 1996; 86: 321-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 19.Yamagata Y. Kato M. Odawara K. Tokuno Y. Nakashima Y. Matsushima N. Yasumura K. Tomita K. Ihara K. Fujii Y. Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. Fujii S. Cell. 1996; 86: 311-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) confirmed that class II and class III enzymes are structurally unrelated, despite the fact that they share a broad substrate specificity. Indeed, for its structure, AlkA belongs to the superfamily of DNA glycosylases, the archetype of which is the EndoIII from E. coli, an N-glycosylase that excises oxidized pyrimidines from DNA (18.Labahn J. Scharer O.D. Long A. Ezaz-Nikpay K. Verdine G.L. Ellenberger T.E. Cell. 1996; 86: 321-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This structural correspondence is striking in view of the limited homology between the members of this family, restricted to the helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) motif present opposite a catalytic aspartic acid in the active site. A fourth class of 3-MeA glycosylases has been proposed after the identification of the MpgII enzyme from Thermotoga maritima (20.Begley T.J. Haas B.J. Noel J. Shekhtman A. Williams W.A. Cunningham R.P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 653-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This enzyme, as in the case of AlkA, belongs to the superfamily of the EndoIII, as defined by the HhH aspartic motif (21.Kuo C.F. McRee D.E. Fisher C.L. O'Handley S.F. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. Science. 1992; 258: 434-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 22.Thayer M.M. Ahern H. Xing D. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4108-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), is able to release not only 3-MeA but also 7-MeG fromN-methyl-N-nitrosourea-treated DNA; and lacks an AP endonuclease activity. Despite those similarities, the lack of sequence homology to AlkA, other than the HhH aspartic motif, has prompted the authors to define the class IV of 3-MeA DNA glycosylases (20.Begley T.J. Haas B.J. Noel J. Shekhtman A. Williams W.A. Cunningham R.P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 653-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In our search for new members of the EndoIII family inHelicobacter pylori, we identified an open reading frame (ORF), HP602, that although labeled as EndoIII (23.Alm R.A. Ling L.S. Moir D.T. King B.L. Brown E.D. Doig P.C. Smith D.R. Noonan B. Guild B.C. deJonge B.L. Carmel G. Tummino P.J. Caruso A. Uria-Nickelsen M. Mills D.M. Ives C. Gibson R. Merberg D. Mills S.D. Jiang Q. Taylor D.E.

Adams M.D. Venter J.C. et al.Nature. 1997; 388: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (3028) Google Scholar), codes for an enzyme that does not recognize oxidized bases or AP sites as substrates. The lack of potential methylpurine DNA glycosylase-encoding genes in the genomic sequence of this pathogen, together with the fact that the protein coded by this ORF has the HhH aspartic motif but lacks the lysine at the active site and the canonical 4Fe-4S cluster characteristic of endonuclease III, prompted us to investigate the possibility that ORF HP602 could be the gene for a methylpurine DNA glycosylase. We present here data showing that the enzyme coded by ORF HP602 is a functional 3-MeA DNA glycosylase, MagIII, inducible at the transcriptional level by MNNG. During the preparation of this manuscript and based on its sequence, the product of this ORF was attributed to the MpgII group (20.Begley T.J. Haas B.J. Noel J. Shekhtman A. Williams W.A. Cunningham R.P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 653-656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although it presents predicted structural similarities with members of the HhH aspartic motif superfamily also displayed by AlkA and has an overall sequence similarity to the members of the MpgII class, this 3-MeA DNA glycosylase has a more restricted substrate specificity, comparable to the one characteristic of Tag. These characteristics suggest that this enzyme from H. pylori defines a novel class of 3-MeA DNA glycosylases. Strains used in this study are listed in Table I.E. coli strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or agar supplemented with ampicillin (200 μg/ml) or kanamycin (30 μg/ml); Minimal A salts were prepared as described by Miller (25.Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar).H. pylori strains were grown on blood brucella agar plates at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 and 95% humidity atmosphere. Disruption mutant H. pylori strains were cultured with 20 μg/ml kanamycin. pGEX-4T-1 and pET29a(+) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and Novagen, respectively.Table IBacterial strains used in this workStrainRelevant genotypeSource or referenceE. coli BL21F ompT hsdSB(rB − mB −) gal dcmNovagen GC4801AB 1157, X::Tn54.Boiteux S.

[32P]ATP (3000Ci/mmol), [3H]dimethyl sulfate (3.8 Ci/mmol), and Nensorb-20 nucleic acid purification cartridges were from New England Nuclear. T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA ligase, and restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. The magIIIgene with its own start codon was synthetized by PCR from two independent H. pylori isolates (13/5 and ADM1 strains) by using oligonucleotide primers deduced from the HP602 ORF. The amplified DNA was cloned in pGEX-4T-1 previously digested with restriction enzymes BamHI and PstI. The resulting plasmids, termed pGHP602-I and pGHP602-V, were expressed in E. coli as a fusion protein consisting of MagIII with glutathioneS-transferase (GST) at its N terminus. In each case, the nucleotide sequences of the cloned genes were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Plasmids pGHP602-I and pGHP602-V and the vector were independently introduced by electroporation into E. coli GC4803 (4.Boiteux S. Huisman O. Laval J. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2569-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the proteins coded by the plasmids after induction with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Survival curves were made with individual transformants. Independent transformants and the wild type strain GC4801 were incubated for 3 h with IPTG to allow gene expression. They were subsequently challenged with 0, 5, 10, 25, or 50 mm MMS in minimal A salts for 20 min at 37 °C and spread, after appropriate dilution, on LB plates to calculate cell viability. For H. pylori strains, evaluation of the resistance to the cytotoxic effect of the MMS was conducted by determining the survival rate of the wild type and mutant strains following a 20-min exposure in liquid to different concentrations of MMS (10–100 mm), spreading on blood agar plates, and colony counting. Both alleles of magIII gene (GIG and GVG) were subcloned from pGHP602-I or pGHP602-V into pET29a+ (Novagen, Inc.) using BamHI and PstI restriction sites. The resulting plasmids were named pSHP602-I and pSHP602-V, respectively.E. coli BL21 cells were electrotransformed with plasmids pSHP602I, pSHP602V, and pET29a+. The expression of the S-tag-MagIII fusions in E. coli was confirmed by S-tag Western blot according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were used to inoculate 500 ml of LB medium supplemented with kanamycin and were incubated at 37 °C with shacking until theA 600 reached 1. IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and growth was continued overnight at 18 °C with shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g, and MagIII was purified following the instructions of the S-tag thrombin kit (Novagen, Inc.) except that 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol were added to all buffers. The thrombin eluted fractions were concentrated by Centricon-30 (Amicon) and loaded onto a fast protein liquid chromatography HR10/30 Superdex 75 gel filtration/size exclusion column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol. The column was eluted with 30 ml of the same buffer (0.7 ml/min), and 500-μl fractions were collected. Protein elution profile was followed with a UV monitor. Under these conditions, purified MagIII eluted at 12 min. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford protein assay method (26.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The 34-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotides used in this study have the following sequence: 5′-GGCTTCATCGTTGTCXCAGACCTGGTGGATACCG-3′, where Xrepresents uracil, hypoxanthine (Hx), or dihyrothymine residue. Except for the latter, a kind gift from Dr. J. Cadet (Commissariat àl'Energie Atomique, Grenoble, France), these oligonucleotides and their complements with each of the four bases opposite the lesion in the duplex were purchased from Oligo Express (Grenoble, France). To generate AP sites, the uracil-containing duplex was incubated in the presence of uracil DNA glycosylase (27.Girard P.M. Guibourt N. Boiteux S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3204-3211Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The [3H]DMS-poly(dG-dC)·poly(dG-dC) and [H3]DMS-DNA were prepared as described (28.Boiteux S. Belleney J. Roques B.P. Laval J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 5429-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 29.Laval J. Nature. 1977; 269: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For the cleavage of lesion-containing DNA duplexes, the oligonucleotide carrying the modified base was 32P-labeled at the 5′-end and annealed to its complementary strand as described (27.Girard P.M. Guibourt N. Boiteux S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3204-3211Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In a standard reaction (final volume, 10 μl), 50 fmol of labeled duplex were incubated in the reaction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm Na2EDTA, 50 mm NaCl) with the indicated protein fraction at 37 °C. For Hx- and dihydrothymine-containing oligos, reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.2 n NaOH. In the case of oligos harboring an AP site, 10 mm NaBH4 was added to stabilize the substrate. After addition of 6 μl of formamide dye, the products were separated by 7 m urea 20% PAGE. Gels were analyzed by autoradiography. 3-Methylpurine DNA glycosylase activities were determined by the method of Karran et al. (30.Karran P. Hjelmgren T. Lindahl T. Nature. 1982; 296: 770-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 100 mm KCl, and 2000 or 15,000 cpm of [3H]DMS-DNA or [3H]DMS-poly(dG-dC)·poly(dG-dC) (2000 cpm/pmol). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and then 75 μl of stop solution containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mg/ml salmon testes DNA, and 0.5 m NaCl were added, followed by the addition of 500 μl of cold ethanol. The reactions were kept at −20 °C for 15 min and centrifuged, and the supernatants were taken (ethanol soluble fraction). The radioactivity in the soluble fraction was determined in a liquid scintillation counter. To analyze the products, the reaction mixtures were separated using high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) (4.Boiteux S. Huisman O. Laval J. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2569-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 6.O'Connor T.R. Boiteux S. Laval J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 5879-5894Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The internal nonradioactive markers 3-MeA and 7-MeG were added to the samples and detected by their UV absorbance. The radioactivity in the fractions was determined in a liquid scintillation counter. The HP602 ORF was amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA from strain 26695 (24.Tomb J.F. White O. Kerlavage A.R. Clayton R.A. Sutton G.G. Fleischmann R.D. Ketchum K.A. Klenk H.P. Gill S.

The 650-base pair DNA product was cloned in the pILL570 derivative plasmid (3.6 kilobase) following a treatment with Uracil DNA Glycosylase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), producing 3′-protruding ends on both the amplicon and the vector (31.Rashtchian A. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1995; 6: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The cloned ORF was disrupted in E. coli by insertion of a transposable element (MiniTn3-Km) (32.Labigne A. Clayton C.L. Mobley H.L.T. Methods in Molecular Medicine: Helicobacter pylori Protocols. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 153-163Google Scholar) into the recombinant plasmid. Twenty-four independent disruptions of the pILL570-HP602 plasmid were pooled and purified using MIDI columns (Qiagen). The pooled plasmids were introduced by natural transformation (33.Wang Y. Roos K.P. Taylor D.E. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 39: 2485-2493Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar) into H. pyloristrain HAS141 (34.Janvier B. Grignon B. Audibert C. Pezennec L. Fauchere J.L. FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. 1999; 24: 27-33Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA from six individual kanamycin resistant transformants were purified (QIAamp tissue kit, Qiagen) and used as template for PCR using the 602-F primer together with Km-1 (5′-CGGTATAATCTTACCTATCACCTCA) or Km-2 (5′-TTTGACTTACTGGGGATCAAGCCTG), two divergent primers flanking the kanamycin resistance gene of the kanamycin cassette (35.Trieu-Cuot P. Gerbaud G. Lambert T. Courvalin P. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3583-3587Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Each PCR fragment was directly sequenced with primer Km-3 (5′-GATCCTTTTTGATAATCTCATGACC, complementary to the end of the MiniTn3-Km), allowing us to determine the orientation of the transposon as well as the precise site of insertion of the transposable element within the HP602 ORF. One mutant with an insertion at nucleotide +272 of the HP602 ORF was further characterized (mutant designated through the manuscript as HAS141magIII). Two-day-oldH. pylori plates were independently challenged with 50 μg/ml MNNG, 5 μg/ml MMS, or 0.5 μg/ml DMS. After 0 min, 20 min, 1 h, 2 h, or 4 h, the cells were harvested, rinsed twice, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The cell pellets were stored at −70 °C. RNA extraction from frozen H. pylori HAS141 was performed with guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol chloroform (Trizol, Life Technologies, Inc.). Total RNA was dissolved in 20 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with 1 unit/μl RNase-free DNase (Promega). DNA absence was confirmed by PCR. cDNA was synthetized with 2 pmol of reverse specific primers for 16 S RNA and magIII, added to 1 μg of each RNA sample. The mixtures were incubated at 70 °C for 10 min, placed on ice for 2 min, and incubated with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Reverse primers were as follows: for 16 S RNA, 5′-CTGGAGAGACTAAGCCCTCC-3′; for magIII,5′-TTTTTTCTGCAGAAGTTTTAAT-3′. Relative quantification of mRNA levels was performed in the exponential phase of amplification as described previously (36.Murphy L.D. Herzog C.E. Rudick J.B. Fojo A.T. Bates S.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10351-10356Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Briefly, PCR amplification of target template and of 16 S RNA as external control were run in parallel. DNA amplification was carried out in 1× PCR buffer supplemented with 200 μm dNTPs, 2 μm each of 5′- and 3′-specific primers, 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a final volume of 50 μl. The exponential phase of amplification was determined by carrying out the reaction for 16–38 cycles using a fixed quantity of cDNA. The number of cycles was set for magIII to 26 sequential cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 48 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 40 s, and for 16 S RNA to 20 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 30 s. In this phase of amplification, the amounts of the amplicons are proportional to the initial amounts of templates. The cDNA was serially diluted in water from 1:5 (10 ng of RNA) to 1:15625 (3.2 pg of RNA). 20 μl ofmagIII and 16 S RNA PCR products amplified in parallel from the same serial dilutions were loaded on agarose gel (1% agarose, 0.05% ethidium bromide). A negative control in which cDNA was omitted was run in parallel with each experiment. The availability of the complete genomic sequence of H. pylori allowed us to identify several putative members of the EndoIII family of DNA glycosylases involved in the repair of modified bases. Two open reading frames were annotated as homologs of the EndoIII from E. coli, HP602 and HP585 (24.Tomb J.F. White O. Kerlavage A.R. Clayton R.A. Sutton G.G. Fleischmann R.D. Ketchum K.A. Klenk H.P.

Adams M.D. Venter J.C. et al.Nature. 1997; 388: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (3028) Google Scholar). To analyze whether these two ORFs coded for bona fidehomologs of the EndoIII and whether they corresponded to redundant activities, the putative coding sequences from two independently isolated strains (13/5 and ADM1) were amplified by PCR and cloned inE. coli vectors that allow their expression as fusions to the C terminus of the GST protein. For HP585 the purification of the GST fusion protein confirmed that this ORF codes for an active EndoIII-like enzyme (data not shown). Sequencing of the plasmids harboring the HP602 ORFs established that the sequences differed between the two isolates (Fig. 1). Comparison of the coded proteins and those of the two strains of which the genomes are completely sequenced shows that for any pair, there are four or five amino acid differences among the 218 residues. In particular, for the two newly sequenced ORFs, a polymorphism was found, GIG versus GVG, at what has been determined to be the active site for the members of this family (22.Thayer M.M. Ahern H. Xing D. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4108-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) (HhH motif, Fig. 1). As a consequence, the analysis of both clones (herein denominated 602-I and 602-V) was carried out in parallel. HP602 also presented regions (Fig.1) structurally homologous to the EndoIII. The three-dimensional PSSM web server was searched for HP602 structurally related proteins. The strongest structural similarities were found with respect to EndoIII (E value, 2.7 × 10−3) and AlkA (E value, 2.8 × 10−2) crystals (37.Kelley L.A. Maccallum R. Sternberg M.J.E. Sorin I.

Proteins. 1999; Suppl 3: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In the predicted secondary structure of the HP602 product it is possible to define, with a high level of confidence (≥50%) the helices αC to αM of EndoIII and AlkA, which constitute the regions at which fold and topology are shared by both enzymes (18.Labahn J.

Moreover, identical amino acids are clustered over these conserved secondary structures. However, HP602 product lacks the pattern of cysteines giving rise to the iron-sulfur cluster present in EndoIII and MpgII proteins. No activity was detected on DNA substrates containing dihydrothymine for the product of the GST fused to either of the HP602 ORF variants (data not shown). Furthermore, neither of these constructs was able to complement the mutator phenotype of an E. colistrain deficient in both EndoIII and EndoVIII DNA glycosylases (data not shown). We therefore examined whether these ORFs could code for a function related to the other member of the EndoIII family, AlkA, which also shares a similar overall folding pattern with EndoIII, as well as the HhH aspartic motif (Fig. 1). To examine whether H. pylori HP602 can substitute for E. coli AlkA and/or Tag in the repair of damaged DNA, HP602/GIG or HP602/GVG f"

DNase I footprint analysis identified a nuclear protein binding site from −282 to −264 nucleotides upstream of the translation initiation codon of the CD155 gene, which we have called foot print IV (FPIV). Linker scanning mutagenesis revealed that a tandem repeat motif, GCGCAGGCGCAG, located within FPIV was essential for the basal activity of the CD155 core promoter. The results of the electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments suggested that identical FPIV binding activities were present in a variety of nuclear extracts and that the tandem repeat was essential for binding. A one-hybrid screen was then carried out using FPIV as bait to clone the cDNA of the FPIV binding factor. The sequences of the cDNAs that were cloned from the screen were identical to NRF-1, a result that was confirmed by further electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments. Overexpression of full-length NRF-1 and a dominant-negative form of NRF-1 modulated reporter gene expression driven by the core promoter. Remarkably, CD155 is the first gene shown to be regulated by NRF-1 that possesses an expression profile during embryogenesis correlating with this factor's proposed role in the development of the vertebrate optic system. We propose that NRF-1, which has been shown by others to be expressed during embryogenesis in animal systems, may be involved in regulating the expression of CD155 at specific stages of central nervous system development.

CD155 was originally cloned based on its ability to serve as the cellular receptor for polio virus (1.Mendelsohn C.L. Wimmer E. Racaniello V.R. Cell. 1989; 56: 855-865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Refs. 6.Solecki D. Gromeier M. Harber J. Bernhardt G. Wimmer E. J. Mol.

CD155 belongs to a subgroup of genes within the immunoglobulin superfamily; these genes share a V-C2-C2 domain structure as well as primary sequence identity. Thus far, cDNAs have been cloned that encode two new human molecules related to CD155, named PRR1 and PRR2 (polio virus receptor related) (8.Lopez M. Eberle F. Mattei M.G. Gabert J. Birg F. Bardin F.

Gene (Amst.). 1995; 159: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Other CD155-related proteins possessing the V-C2-C2 immunoglobulin domain structure appear to be relatively conserved during evolution (10.Koike S. Ise I. Sato Y. Yonekawa H. Gotoh O. Nomoto A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7059-7066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Koike et al. (10.Koike S. Ise I. Sato Y. Yonekawa H. Gotoh O. Nomoto A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7059-7066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that African green monkeys possess polio virus receptors encoded by two related but distinct genes AGMα1 andAGMα2 (African Green Monkey receptor). Two genes,mPRR2, also known as MPH (mouse polio virus receptor homologue), and Tage4 that are related to CD155, also exist in the mouse (11.Morrison M.E. Racaniello V.R. J.

Members of the new CD155 gene family have emerged as cellular receptors for animal viruses. As pointed out earlier, CD155 is the receptor for all three serotypes of the polio virus. There is no available evidence for an alternative receptor except, perhaps, for mouse-adapted polio viruses (14.Gromeier M. Lu H.H. Wimmer E. Microb. Pathog. 1995; 18: 253-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). hPRR1 has recently been identified as a receptor for the α-herpes viruses (15.Cocchi F. Menotti L. Mirandola P. Lopez M. Campadelli-Fiume G. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9992-10002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Geraghty R.J. Krummenacher C. Cohen G.H. Eisenberg R.J. Spear P.G.

Racaniello V.R. Spear P.G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4493-4497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biological importance of CD155 and its relatives has slowly begun to be elucidated. CD155, as well as mPRR2, are expressed during embryogenesis. 1M. Gromeier, D. Solecki, and E. Wimmer, submitted for publication.1M. Gromeier, D. Solecki, and E. Wimmer, submitted for publication. Recently, immunohistochemistry was used to determine that CD155 is expressed in regions of the developing human central nervous system, such as the notochord, floor plate, neural tube and the optic system.1Surprisingly, in situ hybridization analysis of mPRR2 mRNA indicated that this gene was also expressed in these structures of embryonic mice. 2M. Gromeier and E. Wimmer, unpublished results.2M. Gromeier and E. Wimmer, unpublished results. Many cell adhesion molecules belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily important for the development of the CNS3 are expressed during embryogenesis in the floor plate and optic system (19.Burns F.R. von Kannen S.

Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 235: 374-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and hPRR2 (23.Lopez M. Aoubala M. Jordier F. Isnardon D. Gomez S. Dubreuil P. Blood. 1998; 92: 4602-4611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) possess activity as homotypic adhesion molecules. In addition, cell adhesion activity has also has been demonstrated for hPRR1 (24.Takahashi K. Nakanishi H. Miyahara M. Mandai K. Satoh K. Satoh A. Nishioka H. Aoki J. Nomoto A. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). This may suggest that some of the members of the CD155 gene family may be adhesion molecules involved in the development of the CNS. We have cloned the promoter region of the CD155 gene (25.Solecki D. Wimmer E. Lipp M. Bernhardt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1791-1800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Our initial analyses have mapped a 280-bp core promoter fragment that is high in GC nucleotide content, lacks TATA and CAAT boxes, harbors a region of multiple transcriptional start sites, and appears to contain determinants required for cell type-specific promoter activity (25.Solecki D. Wimmer E. Lipp M. Bernhardt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1791-1800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar,26.Solecki D. Schwarz S. Wimmer E. Lipp M. Bernhardt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5579-5586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have used a transgenic mouse system to determine that the 3.0-kilobase CD155 promoter is capable of directing reporter gene expression to the appropriate anatomical structures where CD155 is expressed during embryogenesis.1 We have been interested in identifying the cis-acting elements andtrans-acting factors that could potentially play a role in the tissue-specific activity of the CD155 promoter. Moreover, we have hoped that our studies would identify target elements or factors that could be involved in orchestrating the activity of theCD155 promoter during embryonic development. We have recently reported the presence of three cis-acting elements within the CD155 core promoter region referred to as FPI, FPII, and FPIII (25.Solecki D. Wimmer E. Lipp M. Bernhardt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1791-1800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Members of the activator protein-2 (AP-2) transcription factor have been found to bind to FPI and FPII and are able to activate reporter gene expression driven by theCD155 core promoter. Here, we report the characterization of a fourth cis-acting element (FPIV) within theCD155 core promoter that is essential for basal promoter activity. This element is bound by a nuclear protein that is present in the nuclear extracts prepared from murine embryos of gestational stages where the CD155 promoter is active in vivo. We have determined that the transcription factor is nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1). NRF-1, a regulatory protein present in the nuclear extracts of murine embryos and many established cell lines, binds to FPIV and functions as a potent transcriptional activator of theCD155 core promoter. Interestingly, NRF-1 belongs to a family of developmentally expressed transcription factors (27.Virbasius C.A. Virbasius J.V. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2431-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). In view of these observations, we will discuss the potential significance of the NRF-1/FPIV interaction relative to the in vivo activity of the CD155 promoter. The HeLa (cervical carcinoma), HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma), HEK293 (embryonic kidney), SK-N-MC (neuroblastoma), HTB15 (glioblastoma), and Ntera-2/clone D1 (teratocarcinoma) cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum. Mouse embryonic nuclear extracts were prepared using a modification of the method of Tamura et al. (28.Tamura T. Konishi Y. Makino Y. Mikoshiba K. Methods (Orlando). 1996; 10: 312-319Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Briefly, embryos of defined gestational age were harvested and homogenized in a solution containing 10 mm Hepes, 15 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.2 m sucrose, and 5% glycerol. The homogenate was layered over a solution containing 10 mmHepes, 15 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.0 msucrose, and 10% glycerol and centrifuged at 24,000 rpm for 1 h. The resulting pellet of nuclei was harvested and resuspended in a solution containing 10 mm Hepes, 550 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 3 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol to lyse the nuclei and strip the chromatin of DNA-binding proteins. After the chromatin was pelleted by centrifugation at 40,000 rpm for 1 h, the supernatant containing the nuclear proteins was harvested and concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. Nuclear extracts from human cell lines for use in EMSA experiments were prepared according to the procedure by Schreiber et al.(29.Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar). DNase I footprinting was performed as described previously (25.Solecki D. Wimmer E. Lipp M. Bernhardt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1791-1800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, end-labeled DNA probes were generated via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using an oligonucleotide primer carrying a 5′-terminal [γ-32P]ATP label. PCR was performed under standard conditions using 10 ng of pGL2-H template, 25 pmol of labeled and unlabeled primers, and 1.2 units Taq polymerase. Radiolabeled PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis on a 10% native polyacrylamide gel; the bands were visualized by autoradiography, and a selected band was excised from the gel and passively eluted. DNase I protection assays were performed using 100,000 cpm of labeled probe which was incubated in a 50 μl binding reaction containing 2 μg of poly[d(I-C)] and nuclear protein. After a 30-min incubation on ice, 50 μl of a solution (room temperature) of 5 mm CaCl2 and 10 mmMgCl2 was added to each reaction and incubated for 1 min at room temperature. One μl of DNase I (100 ng/ml) was then added and incubated another minute at room temperature. The reactions were then terminated by the addition of 90 μl of stop solution (0.2m NaCl, 0.03 m EDTA, 1% SDS, and linear polyacrylamide as a carrier for ethanol precipitation); the mixture was then phenol/chloroform extracted twice, and the DNA was ethanol-precipitated. The samples were then electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide sequencing gels with a sequencing reaction as a marker. Site-directed mutagenesis of the BE CD155 promoter fragment, the CD155 core promoter spanning nucleotides −343 to −58 upstream of the CD155 translation initiating ATG codon (Fig.1 A; (26.Solecki D. Schwarz S. Wimmer E. Lipp M. Bernhardt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5579-5586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar)), was carried out using the megaprimer mutagenesis technique of Picard et al. (30.Picard V. Ersdal-Badju E. Aiqin L. Bock S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). To generate a megaprimer for each mutant construct, 100 ng of pGL2-BE plasmid was amplified in a reaction containing 50 pmol of the 4532 flanking primer, 50 pmol of mutagenic primer, 5 μl of 10x buffer, 2 μl of 10 mmdNTP mix, and 0.5 μl of Taq-polymerase (2.5 unit, Stratagene) in a total reaction volume of 50 μl. PCR amplification conditions were 94 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 45 s; 72 °C, 45 s; for 35 cycles. All megaprimers were then gel-purified. To extend a megaprimer to generate to a full-length 280-bp BE fragment, 100 ng of pGL2-BE plasmid was amplified in a reaction containing 50 pmol of either 4529 flanking primer, 1–2 μg of megaprimer, 5 μl of 10x buffer, 2 μl of 10 mm dNTP mix, and 0.5 μl ofPfu-polymerase (2.5 unit, Stratagene). The primers used for megaprimer PCR reactions were: 4532, 5′-GGCGCTAGCGCCGCCTCTTCTAGTG-3′; 4529, 5′-GCCAGATCTGCTCGCTCTGCCGCGG-3′; IV (1.Mendelsohn C.L. Wimmer E. Racaniello V.R.

All cell lines were transfected by the calcium phosphate procedure. Each transfection mixture for the linker scan series of constructs was composed of 18 μg of wild type or mutant BE reporter constructs and 1 μg of pRL-TK (standard to the measure of efficiency of transfection). The compositions of the co-transfection experiments was 9.0 μg of the BE or BE ΔTR, mixed with up to 1.5 μg of pcDNA3(NRF-1). Co-transfections were supplemented with empty pcDNA3 to keep the amount of backbone plasmid constant for each experiment. 50 μl of 2.5 m CaCl2 was added to the DNA mixtures that were subsequently diluted to a total volume of 500 μl with Tris/EDTA buffer. These solutions were then separately combined dropwise with 500 μl of ice-cold 2x HBSS and incubated ten minutes at room temperature. Half of the precipitates were then added to a separate 6-cm plate of tissue culture cells (∼105cells), and the plates were incubated at 37 °C. 4 h later the medium was removed, and a solution of 20% glycerol in HBSS added. Following a 3-min incubation at 37 °C, 3 ml of medium was added, and the supernatant was removed again and replaced by fresh medium with serum. All transfected cells were harvested 18 h post-transfection, and cell extracts (usually 200–400 μl) were made using the reporter lysis buffer from Promega. The oligodeoxynucleotides used for EMSA were: FPIVs, 5′-GAGAGACCTGCGCAGGCGCAGCG-3′; FPIVas, 5′-GCGCGCTGCGCCTGCGCAGGTCT-3′; IV (3.Zibert A. Selinka H.C. Elroy-Stein O. Moss B. Wimmer E. Virology. 1991; 182: 250-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar)s, 5′-GAGAGACCTGCGACTAGTAGCG-3′; and IV (3.Zibert A. Selinka H.C. Elroy-Stein O. Moss B. Wimmer E. Virology. 1991; 182: 250-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar)as, 5′-GCGCGCTGACTAGTCGCAGGTCT-3′. One nmol of each the coding and noncoding oligodeoxynucleotide were reassociated in a volume of 50 μl using a thermocycler. Settings were 5 min at 95 °C and 1 h each at 65 °C, 60 °C, 55 °C, 50 °C, 45 °C, and 40 °C. The oligodeoxynucleotides were designed to possess a G as the 5′-protruding nucleotide. Ten pmol of reassociated oligodeoxynucleotide was end-labeled by a fill in reaction using CombiPol Polymerase (InViTek). In a volume of 20 μl, the buffer, 0.5 μl of enzyme, 50 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP, 1 μl of 25 mmMgCl2, and the oligodeoxynucleotide were incubated at 40 °C for 10 min, 45 °C for 10 min, and 50 °C for 20 min. The labeled oligodeoxynucleotide was purified by Sephadex G50 chromatography (Nick columns, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Usually more than 50% of label were found to be incorporated into the oligodeoxynucleotide. A binding reaction containing 1 μl of 10× incubation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 25% glycerol), 1.5 μg of poly(dI-dC)(dI-dC), various concentrations of competitor or antibody (goat anti-NRF-1 antiserum was the kind gift of Richard Scarpulla), and 4 μl of cell extract was prepared and preincubated for 10 min at room temperature. After preincubation 1 μl of labeled oligodeoxynucleotide corresponding to 100 fmol were added, and the incubation continued for another 20 min. Samples were loaded onto a 6% 1/2× TBE polyacrylamide gel. After the electrophoresis (200 V) the gel was fixed in 10% acetic acid/30% methanol for 30 min and dried. The Matchmaker one-hybrid system kit (CLONTECH) was used to screen an E9/E10.5 mouse embryo library for the cDNAs of FPIV-binding proteins. Oligonucleotides consisting of four tandem repeats of the FPIV sequence were associated and then were cloned into pcDNA3. The identity of the cloned insert was verified by sequence analysis. The four tandem repeats were then subcloned into the yeast integration vectors pHISi-1 and pLacZi. These resulting vectors, p4xFPIV-HISi-1 and p4xFPIV-LacZi, were then linearized, transformed sequentially into the YM4271 yeast strain, and grown on the proper medium to select for colonies harboring the plasmids that had recombined in their proper genetic loci. The resulting doubly integrated yeast strain, YM4271(His, LacZ 4xFPIV), was found to possess very low background expression of the integrated HIS3 and LacZ reporter genes and was suitable for use in a library screen (data not shown). Library Screen—Competent YM4271(His, LacZ 4xFPIV) cells were transformed with 20 μg of an E9/E10.5 mouse embryo library using the procedure outlined by the Matchmaker one-hybrid system protocol (CLONTECH). The cells that were transformed with the library were then plated onto SD/-His/-Leu/+15 mm 3-aminotriazole selection plates and incubated at 30°C for 3 days. Colonies that grew under these selection conditions were then streaked onto fresh SD/-His/-Leu/+15 mm3-aminotriazole selection plates and were then subjected to colony to assay the expression of the LacZ reporter gene. Colonies that were His and LacZ positive were candidates for expressing library clones that encoded proteins that could bind to the 4xFPIV-target element. Therefore, the library plasmids from the His+ and LacZ+ colonies obtained from the library screen were isolated from the yeast, transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α cells, and subjected to sequence analysis. Total cellular RNA for use in RT-PCR was isolated from 3 × 107 SK-N-MC or HeLa cells according to the TRIzol protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Reverse transcription was done with Superscript reverse transcriptase from Life Technologies, Inc. using 10 μg of RNA as template and 1 pmol of gene-specific 3′-primer (NRF RT) in a reaction volume of 12 μl. The mixture was heated to 80 °C for 5 min and then allowed to cool to 42 °C. 4 μl of 5× reaction buffer, 2 μl of 0.1 m DTT, 1 μl of 10 mmdNTP mixture, 1 μl of RNAsin (25 unit), and 1 μl of reverse transcriptase were added and the reaction incubated for 90 min. at 42 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 20 μl of 0.4m NaOH. Following 10 min at 42 °C, 20 μl of 1m TrisHCl pH 7.5 were added and the RT stocks frozen at −20 °C. The oligodeoxynucleotides used were: NRF RT, 5′-CATTTGATTGCACCTCTGCAAACG-3′; NRF 5′-NTR, 5′-GGATATTTGTTTAATGAATGTGGTATGC-3′; NRF ATG, 5′-TAGAAGCTTATGGAGGAACACGGAGTGACCC-3′; NRF TGA, 5′-GGCTCTAGATCACTGTTCCAATGTCACCACC-3′; ΔNRF, 5′-CTGTCTAGATCACTGTGATGGTACAAGATGAGCTATACTATG-3′. The full-length NRF-1 cDNA was amplified by nested PCR. For the first PCR reaction, 1 μl of RT stock was taken as template and mixed with 2 μl of 10 mm dNTP, 0.5 μl of primers each (50 pmol of NRF 5′-NTR and NRF TGA), 5 μl of 10× buffer, 10 μl of 5× optimizer buffer, 1 μl of CombiPol Polymerase (InViTek), and water to a total volume of 50 μl. Following a denaturation step at 94 °C, 2 min, 35 cycles were done at 94 °C, 45 s; 55 °C, 45 s; and 72 °C, 90 s. For the second PCR reaction, 1 μl of the first PCR reaction was amplified with 50 pmol each of the NRF ATG and NRF TGA primers with the above amplification conditions. Products were separated on a 1.0% agarose gel. The full-length product was observed when both HeLa and SK-N-MC total RNA were used as template for RT. The SK-N-MC full-length product was cut out and gel-purified. Following digestion withHindIII and XbaI restriction enzymes, the fragment was cloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector. The full-length insert was sequenced and found to be identical to the published open reading frame. A putative dominant-negative form of NRF-1 was cloned by amplifying the full-length cDNA with the NRF ATG and ΔNRF primers. The resulting product encoding the first 304 amino acids of NRF-1 was cloned into the HindIII andXbaI sites of pcDNA3. In vitro translation of the NRF-1 cDNA was carried out using the TNT-coupled rabbit reticulocyte system as per the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Our previous studies identified three functional cis-acting elements (FPI–III) within the CD155 core promoter (for schematic locations see Fig. 1 A) (25.Solecki D. Wimmer E. Lipp M. Bernhardt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1791-1800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). All three of these cis-acting elements are located within a 280-bp genomic DNA fragment, named BE (see the borders of the BE fragment, Fig. 1 A), that harbors full ability to direct the expression of a reporter gene when transfected into tissue culture cell lines that naturally express CD155 (25.Solecki D.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5579-5586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Serial deletion analysis of theCD155 promoter was used in our original experiments to map the functional boundaries of the BE fragment (26.Solecki D. Schwarz S. Wimmer E. Lipp M. Bernhardt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5579-5586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The exact 5′-borders of two of the serial deletion constructs, named B and C, are shown in Fig. 1, A and B. The promoter activity of the C construct has been found to be greatly reduced when compared with that of B (26.Solecki D. Schwarz S. Wimmer E. Lipp M. Bernhardt G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5579-5586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), an observation suggesting the existence of a fourthcis-acting element within this area of the CD155promoter. To investigate this possibility further, we utilized twoBssHII restriction sites that flank the B–C region to generate a fine scale deletion within this area (for location of theBssHII restriction sites see Fig. 1 B). The ΔBssHII construct was transiently transfected into the HeLa and HEp-2 cell lines, and its ability to direct the expression of the luciferase reporter gene was determined. Strikingly, an 80% reduction of promoter activity was observed when the 50 bp in the vicinity the C construct border were removed (Fig. 1 C) or replaced in an inverted orientation (data not shown). These results suggest that a strong cis-element resides within this area. To map the location of any potential nuclear protein binding sites we subjected the 5′-portion of the CD155 core promoter to DNase I footprint analysis. The choice of the nuclear extract was guided by the following observation. Analysis of the CD155promoter/LacZ transgene indicated that murine embryos of the E10.5–E14.5 post conception stages express the LacZ reporter gene in a cell type-specific manner within the developing CNS.1Therefore, nuclear extracts of embryos from the E10.5–E14.5 gestational stages could conceivably contain the full complement oftrans-acting factors required to produce this expression pattern. Because our main aim was to identify transcription factors that could potentially contribute toward the in vivoactivity of the CD155 promoter, we used nuclear extracts prepared from E10.5 murine embryos for DNase I footprint experiments. When footprint analysis was performed with 75 μg of extract, a single protected region, called FPIV, was observed that was located from −282 to −264 base pairs upstream of the initiator ATG of theCD155 gene (see Fig. 2, for relative locations see Fig. 1, A and B). Interestingly, FPIV is located within the boundaries of theBssHII restriction fragment that we had discovered to be essential for core promoter activity. When footprinting experiments were carried out using nuclear extracts prepared from human cell lines, a partial footprint was also observed overlapping with that produced from E10.5 extract (data not shown). These results suggest that a nuclear protein binding site exists within the 5′ of theCD155 core promoter. Several data base searches for transcription factor binding motifs using the FPIV region yielded no significant homology to known transcription factor binding sites. However, a 12-base pair tandem repeat sequence, GCGCAGGCGCAG, showed significant homology to identical motifs found in a variety of other human promoters (data not shown). The DNase I footprint experiment (Fig. 2) identified a segment of theCD155 upstream sequence that is likely to harbor acis-element required for promoter function. To more precisely map this element, a series of linker scan mutations was generated throughout this protected sequence. Each mutant promoter construct contained 6 base pairs of wild type CD155 promoter sequ"

Binding of the agonist all-trans-retinoic acid to the RAR results in increased interaction with coactivator molecules as well as a decreased interaction with corepressor molecules. Thus, an all-trans-retinoic acid antagonist might function either by preventing agonist induction of such events or, additionally, by actively increasing repression via corepressor recruitment. We demonstrate that the repression of the transcriptional activity of a constitutively active RARγ-VP-16 chimeric receptor by the inverse agonist AGN193109 requires a functional Co-R box and that binding of this ligand to RARγ leads to an increased interaction with the corepressor N-CoR both in glutathione S-transferase pull-down and yeast two-hybrid analyses. Detection of nuclear receptor corepressor (N-CoR) association with RARγ was greatly facilitated by inclusion of a RARE oligonucleotide in coimmunoprecipitation analyses, a result of an increase in association of the ternary complex consisting of RAR, RXR, and DNA. Similarly, this DNA-dependent increase in heterodimer formation likewise resulted in an increase in agonist-mediated recruitment efficiency of the coactivator SRC-1. Under conditions which favor ternary complex formation, a RAR neutral antagonist is distinguished from an inverse agonist with respect to corepressor recruitment as is a RAR partial agonist distinguished from an agonist with respect to coactivator recruitment. These results indicate that it is possible to design RAR ligands with distinct recruitment capabilities for coregulators, both coactivators as well as corepressors. In addition, using this recruitment assay, we show that SRC-1 and the related coactivator molecule ACTR associate with the ternary complex via utilization of different helical motifs within their conserved receptor interaction domains.

In the absence of hormone, RARα has been shown to be associated with corepressor molecules such as N-CoR and SMRT (1.Chen J.D. Evans R.M.

Models for ligand-mediated receptor transactivation have thus consisted of transcriptionally repressed receptors in the absence of hormone, due to corepressor association, followed by derepression and activation upon hormone addition. Alternatively, maximum corepressor interaction may not occur in the unliganded state. If so, the binding of certain ligands such as antagonists could lead to corepressor recruitment. Furthermore, RAR antagonists could conceivably vary in their mechanism of action ranging from simple competitive displacement of agonist to a more active process involving recruitment of nuclear corepressor. Inverse agonists have been described for β-adrenergic receptors (11.Bond R.A. Leff P. Johnson T.D. Milano C.A. Rockman H.A. McMinn T.R. Apparsundaram S. Hyek M.F. Kenakin T.P. Allen L.F.

These active antagonists have the ability to lower the constitutive activity, in the opposite direction exerted by agonist, of these receptors which occurs either naturally or results from overexpression or mutation. For G-protein-coupled receptors, inverse agonists have been proposed to stabilize a receptor conformation which has decreased affinity for G-protein. The existence of corepressor molecules offers a potential mechanism to account for inverse agonism observed for nuclear receptors. Thus, in a manner analogous to agonist-mediated coactivator recruitment, binding of an antagonist to a nuclear receptor may lead to an increase in the association with a corepressor. We have recently identified novel synthetic RAR ligands which function as antagonists of ATRA (16.Klein E.S. Pino M.E. Johnson A.T. Davies P.J.A. Nagpal S. Thacher S. Krasinski G. Chandraratna R.A.S.

One of these antagonists, AGN193109, exhibits inverse agonist activity as evidenced by its repression of the basal activity of a chimeric RARγ-VP-16 in the absence of added agonist (16.Klein E.S. Pino M.E. Johnson A.T. Davies P.J.A. Nagpal S. Thacher S. Krasinski G. Chandraratna R.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22692-22696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In this report we demonstrate that interaction between the nuclear corepressor N-CoR and the RAR can be increased by RAR antagonists. In the course of these experiments, we developed a method which facilitates ternary complex formation by RAR, RXR, and DNA. The association of coregulator molecules with the ternary complex is greatly facilitated relative to RARs in isolation. This increased association allowed us detect ligand-mediated recruitment of N-CoR to the three different RAR isoforms and distinguish RAR antagonists in regard to their respective corepressor recruitment capabilities. Similarly, this method allowed for RAR agonist, partial agonist, and antagonist to be distinguished in respect to coactivator recruitment. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coactivators SRC-1 and ACTR utilize different motifs within their receptor interaction domains for association with the ternary complex. Our results support the hypothesis that the target for these nuclear receptor ligands is the RAR·RXR·DNA ternary complex. The plasmids pRS-RXRα (19.Mangelsdorf D.J. Ong E.S. Dyck J.A. Evans R.M.

The plasmids pGEM3Z-hRARαΔ5′, pGEM-hRARβΔ5′, and pGEM3Z-hRARγΔ5′, containing full-length cDNAs, were kindly provided by Dr. Bill Lamph, Ligand Pharmaceuticals. pcDNA3.1-hRARα-V5, was constructed by replacing the RARα stop codon with a XbaI site in the plasmid pGEM3Z-hRARαΔ5′ using PCR, followed by insertion of theEcoRI-XbaI fragment into the plasmid pcDNA3.1-V5/HisA (Invitrogen). The plasmid pcDNA3.1-RARβ-V5 was constructed by replacing the RARβ stop codon with aXbaI site in the plasmid pGEM-hRARβΔ5′ using PCR, followed by insertion of the SacI-XbaI fragment into the EcoRV and XbaI sites of the plasmid pcDNA3.1-V5/HisA. pcDNA3.1-hRARγ-V5 was constructed via insertion of the KpnI-ApaI fragment of the plasmid pGEM3Z-hRARγΔ5′ into the plasmid pcDNA3.1-V5/HisB (Invitrogen), followed by insertion of the C-terminal portion of the RARγ cDNA via the incorporation of an ApaI site at the RARγ stop codon using PCR. For RARγ-VP-16(AHT), amino acids 223, 224, and 227 (Ala, His, and Thr) of RARγ were converted to Gly, Gly, and Ala, respectively, by PCR mutagenesis within the SacI and EcoRV sites. After substitution of this fragment into RARγ-VP-16, the VP16 and RARγ N-terminal domains were reintroduced using the SacI fragment of RARγ-VP-16. For pAS-N-CoR, PCR mediated introduction of EcoRI sites into the N-CoR cDNA, adjacent to the initiator methionine codon and theApaI site located at nucleotide position 403 (GenBank accession number U35312), allowed insertion of the N-CoR N termini in-frame with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) in plasmid pAS2-1 (CLONTECH Laboratories). The C-terminal encoding portion of N-CoR cDNA was inserted using the internalApaI site and the SalI site located in the polylinker of pAS2-1. pAS-RXRβ was made via insertion ofEcoRI sites into the mouse RXRβ cDNA by PCR and insertion of this fragment, encoding the ligand-binding domain (amino acids 147–410), in-frame with the Gal4 DBD of the plasmid pAS2-1 (CLONTECH). pACT-RARγ was constructed via PCR mediated introduction of BamHI sites next to the start and stop codons of the human RARγ cDNA followed by insertion into theBamHI site of the plasmid pACT2 (CLONTECH). pACT-RARγ (AHT) was derived from pACT-RARγ via the substitution of the relevant SacI andEcoRV cDNA fragment from RARγ-VP16-AHT. Vectors for bacterial expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-RARγ (amino acids 1–454) and -RXRα (amino acids 1–462) fusion proteins were generated via PCR mediated introduction ofNotI and BamHI (RARγ) or NotI andSmaI (RXRα) restriction sites into receptor cDNAs and insertion in-frame with the GST moiety of the plasmid pGEX-KN (20.Hakes D.J. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Limited proteolytic digestion of RARs was carried out as described previously (21.Keidel S. LeMotte P. Apgel C. Mol. Cell.

After incubating on ice for 1 h, 1 μl of trypsin (250, 500, or 1000 μg/ml) was added and the lysates were incubated for 10 min at room temperature.

One hour after addition of ligand (1 μm final) a 32P-labeled βRARE (5′-agctttcaggtcaccaggaggtcagaa-3′) was added. After 30 min, samples were run on a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5 × TBE and subjected to autoradiography. Analysis of ligand regulation of RARγ-VP-16 and RARγ-VP-16(AHT) was performed as described previously (16.Klein E.S. Pino M.E. Johnson A.T. Davies P.J.A. Nagpal S. Thacher S. Krasinski G.

For whole cell extracts, CV-1 cells were cultured with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% activated charcoal-extracted fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products) before transfection. At a density of 40∼60% (15-cm plate, Falcon), cells were transiently transfected with 15 μl of FuGene 6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with 0.5 μg of pRS-RXRα, and 5 μg of pcDNA3.1-hRARα-V5, pcDNA3.1-hRARβ-V5, or pcDNA3.1-hRARγ-V5 per plate. After 2 days, cells were rinsed twice with PBS and lysed in cold NET buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) containing protease inhibitors, homogenized by QIAshredder (Qiagen), and clarified by centrifugation. Expression and purification of GST fusion proteins was performed in BL-21 bacteria as described previously (27.Ausebel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1987Google Scholar). 35S-Radiolabeled N-CoR-C′ (amino acids 1629–2453) and RARγ were produced using the T-N-T-coupled transcription-translation system (Promega) programmed with pBKS-N-CoR-C′ and pGEM3Z-hRARγΔ5′, respectively. After binding to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma), GST fusion proteins were resuspended in 50 μl of CHAPS buffer (8 mm Tris phosphate, pH 7.4, 120 mm KCl, 8% glycerol, 4 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% CHAPS (Calbiochem)) to which 2 μl of retinoid in vehicle or vehicle alone (1 μm final), 2 μl of 10% bovine serum albumin, and 145 μl of CHAPS buffer was added. After incubation on ice for 30 min, 1 μl of in vitro translated35S-N-CoR-C′ was added and tubes were incubated for 20 min at 20, 30, or 37 °C. After washing 3 times with 1 ml of cold CHAPS buffer, bound proteins were eluted in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer, electrophoresed through a 8% polyacrylamide gel, and visualized by autoradiography. Quantitation of bound proteins was performed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. pAS2-1 and pACT2 based vectors (CLONTECH) were transformed into Y190 yeast using the instructions provided by the manufacturer. β-Galactosidase activity was measured, usingo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) as a substrate (28.Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar), in freeze-fractured extracts of yeast grown overnight at 30 °C in the presence or absence of the indicated retinoids (1 μm final). 1 mg of transfected CV-1 whole cell extract was used for each immunoprecipitation. Cell lysates were incubated with retinoids on ice for 1 h. Where indicated, annealed double-strand oligonucleotides (DR-5 RARE: 5′-agctttcaggtcaccaggaggtcagaa-3′; G-5-G mutant RARE: 5′-agcttagagaacaccgaaagaacacta-3′) were added prior to ligand addition and incubated on ice for 30 min. After 1-h incubation on ice with primary antibody (mouse anti-V5, Invitrogen), Protein G-agarose (Sigma) was added and samples were rocked overnight at 4 °C. After washing with ice-cold NET buffer, immunoprecipitants were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (4–12%) followed by Western blotting. Membranes were probed with the indicated antibodies in PBS-T buffer (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk, and washed in PBS-T buffer. Primary antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotech (number SC553, rabbit anti-RXRα; number SC1609, goat anti-N-CoR) Upstate Biotechnology (number 05-490, mouse anti-ACTR) and Affinity BioReagents (number MA1–840, mouse anti-SRC1). Where indicated, ACTR peptides (LXD1, LESKGHKKLLQLLTCSSDDRGH; LXD2, LLQEKHRILHKLLQNGNSPAEV; LXD3, KKKENNALLRYLLDRDDPSDAL) or SRC-1 peptides (LXD1, KYSQTSHKLVQLLTTTAEQQLR; LXD2, SLTERHKILHRLLQEGSPSDIT; LXD3, KESKDHQLLRYLLDKDEKDLRS) were added before the addition of retinoids to a final concentration between 20 and 40 μm. AGN193840 and AGN193109 are potent antagonists of ATRA at RARγ (16.Klein E.S. Pino M.E. Johnson A.T. Davies P.J.A. Nagpal S. Thacher S. Krasinski G. Chandraratna R.A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22692-22696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Differing from AGN193840 only by the substitution of a methyl substituent for a fluorine on the phenyl ring (see Fig.1 A), AGN193109 is distinguished by its ability to repress the elevated basal activity of a chimeric receptor, RARγ-VP-16, containing the transactivation domain of the herpes simplex viral protein VP-16 (16.Klein E.S. Pino M.E. Johnson A.T. Davies P.J.A. Nagpal S. Thacher S. Krasinski G. Chandraratna R.A.S. J. Biol.

Pino M.E. Johnson A.T. Davies P.J.A. Nagpal S. Thacher S. Krasinski G. Chandraratna R.A.S. J. Biol.

Antagonists for various nuclear receptor family members have been shown to induce receptor conformations distinct from those induced by agonist using limited protease digestion (21.Keidel S. LeMotte P. Apgel C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 30.Allan G.F. Leng X. Tsai S.Y. Weigel N.L. Edwards D.P. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 659-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As has been previously demonstrated, binding of the RARα selective antagonist Ro-41-5253 (21.Keidel S. LeMotte P. Apgel C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) to in vitro translated RARα followed by trypsin digestion results in a protected fragment 26 kDa in size compared with a 30-kDa species conferred by the natural hormone ATRA (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, binding of the inverse agonist AGN193109 to all three RARs results in a proteolytic protection pattern equivalent to that produced by ATRA (Fig. 1 B). Similar analyses using the neutral antagonist AGN193840 gave identical results as AGN193109 (data not shown). However, the RAR conformations induced by AGN193109 and ATRA must be distinct due to the inability of AGN193109 to trans-activate RARs (17.Johnson A.T. Klein E.S. Gillett S.J. Wang L. Song T.K. Pino M.E. Chandraratna R.A.S. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 4764-4767Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) or to mediate coactivator interaction with the RAR in yeast two-hybrid studies (data not shown) or in co-immunoprecipitations from cellular extracts (see below). Dimerization of the RAR with its heterodimeric partner RXR is required for efficient DNA binding and transactivation (32.Yu V. Delsert C. Andersen B. Holloway J.M. Devary O.V. Naar A.M. Kim S. Boutin J. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 1991; 67: 1251-1266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). Addition of either AGN193840 or AGN193109 did not inhibit RAR/RXR binding to a βRARE using EMSA (Fig. 2 A). To further address this question we analyzed RAR-RXR heterodimerization in a yeast two-hybrid system consisting of a Gal4 (DBD)-RARγ fusion protein and a Gal4 activation domain (AD)-RXRβ fusion protein. β-Galactosidase activity in yeast containing both of these expression plasmids is increased over that in yeast having only the Gal4(DBD)-RARγ plasmid, demonstrating the heterodimerization between the RAR and RXR moieties. Neither agonist (TTNPB), AGN193109, nor AGN193840 addition altered this degree of RAR-RXR interaction (Fig.2B). Thus, binding of these retinoids to the RAR does not disrupt heterodimer formation or DNA binding. The existence of corepressor molecules (1.Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 277: 454-457Crossref Scopus (1715) Google Scholar, 2.Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamie Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 277: 397-404Crossref Scopus (1714) Google Scholar) which interact with the RAR, and other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, offer a possible explanation of the inverse agonism seen for ligands such as AGN193109. To confirm that the trans-repressive effect of an inverse agonist upon the activity of RARγ-VP-16 is due to recruitment of a corepressor to the RAR, we mutated the corepressor (CoR) box in the RARγ-VP-16 context. Mutations in this domain, located in the hinge region immediately C-terminal to the DNA-binding domain, result in loss of functional N-CoR binding to RARα (2.Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamie Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 277: 397-404Crossref Scopus (1714) Google Scholar). While AGN193109 treatment leads to a dose-dependent trans-repression of RARγ-VP-16 activity, mutation of the CoR box in RARγ-VP16-AHT results in basal activity which is refractory to this inverse agonist (Fig.3 A). This requirement of a functional CoR box for inverse agonist activity is consistent with recruitment of corepressor to the RAR upon binding AGN193109. In order to analyze ligand modulation of RAR-N-CoR interaction,in vitro translated N-CoR was incubated with a GST-RARγ fusion protein immobilized to glutathione-agarose (Fig.3 B). When incubations were performed at 20 or 30 °C, TTNPB treatment led to decreased interaction between N-CoR and GST-RARγ relative to vehicle alone. In contrast AGN193109 treatment resulted in an increased interaction at both incubation temperatures. When incubations were performed at 37 °C, the detectable interaction in the absence of added ligand was considerably reduced. However, the addition of AGN193109 led to a robust increase in the interaction between N-CoR and GST-RARγ. Similar analysis using the neutral antagonist AGN193840 did not indicate it to be different than AGN193109 in its ability to increase RARγ-N-CoR interaction (data not shown). Consistent with these findings, treatment of yeast expressing full-length Gal4(DBD)-N-CoR and Gal4(AD)-RARγ fusion proteins with AGN193109 resulted in an increase in β-galactosidase activity (Fig.3 C). Mutation of the CoR box in Gal4(AD)-RARγ(AHT) abrogated this effect. Therefore, binding of this RAR inverse agonist to RARγ leads to a receptor conformation which has an increased affinity for the corepressor. Similar to our observations in GST pull-down studies (above), the neutral antagonist AGN193840 was essentially equivalent to AGN193109 in its ability to increase the interaction between RARγ and N-CoR in the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 3 C). We wished to compare the ability of AGN193840 and AGN193109 to modulate N-CoR interaction with RARγ in the context of the RAR/RXR heterodimer. While initial studies demonstrated a transfected V5-epitope-tagged RARγ to be well expressed in CV-1 cells, we were unable to detect co-immunoprecipitated endogenous N-CoR in the presence or absence of AGN193109 (data not shown). This was also the case for cells co-transfected with both RARγ-V5 and RXRα (Fig.4 B, lane 1). In contrast, addition of TTNPB to lysates prepared from CV-1 cells transfected with RARγ-V5 alone (data not shown) or together with RXRα (Fig.4 A) resulted in co-immunoprecipitation of the coactivator SRC-1. However, this agonist mediated SRC-1-RARγ interaction was further increased by the inclusion of a synthetic double stranded oligonucleotide containing a DR-5 RARE in the immunoprecipitation. This RARE mediated increase was concentration dependent (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2–5) and was specific for the DR-5 RARE; a mutated DR-5 in which the RARE half-sites has been modified to that of a glucocorticoid receptor half-site, G-5-G, did not result in an increase in SRC-1 co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4 A, lane 7).

The physiological functions of pICln remain to be established. To address this question, we disrupted theICln gene in embryonic stem cells. We found that murine embryos lacking ICln die early in gestation (between stages E3.5 and E7.5). Furthermore, we found that ICln is essential for embryonic stem cell viability. Previously, we showed that pICln interacts directly with a homolog of a yeast protein that binds a PAK-like kinase and participates in the regulation of cell morphology and cell cycling. pICln also forms a complex with several core spliceosomal proteins, and this interaction may play a role in the regulation of spliceosomal biogenesis.

No protein with known function has homology to the predicted amino acid sequence of pICln, and the predicted secondary structure lacks typical membrane-spanning domains. pICln is a soluble protein that is present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (4.Krapivinsky G.B.

A small fraction of total cellular pICln also associates with cytoskeletal elements (4.Krapivinsky G.B. Ackerman M.J. Gordon E.A. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E.

Pflugers Arch. 1998; 436: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The physiological function of pICln has not been established. Although pICln was proposed initially to encode a chloride channel because overexpression of pICln in Xenopus oocytes led to the induction of a chloride conductance (6.Paulmichl M. Li Y. Wickman K. Peralta E. Clapham D. Nature. 1992; 356: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), the structure and localization of pICln suggest that it is not a channel (4.Krapivinsky G.B.

Physiol. 1998; 274: C1545-C1551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of the chloride conductance may be unrelated to the physiological function of pICln, because an identical endogenous chloride conductance is present in some uninjected oocytes (8.Ackerman M.J. Wickman K.D. Clapham D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 153-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and can be induced by overexpression of structurally unrelated proteins (9.Buyse G. Voets T. Tytgat J. Degreef C. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Eggermont J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3615-3621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To determine the physiological function of pICln, we purified and microsequenced several proteins that form stable, soluble complexes with pICln. We have found that pICln interacts directly with IBP72, a protein that is homologous to yeast Skb1 (10.Krapivinsky G. Pu W. Wickman K. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10811-10814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Skb1 binds to a yeast p21-activated kinase (PAK)1homolog, and this interaction has been implicated in the regulation of cell morphology and cell cycling (11.Gilbreth M. Yang P. Bartholomeusz G.

Cobb M.H. Marcus S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13802-13807Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We have also found that pICln interacts directly with several core spliceosomal (Sm) proteins (13.Pu W.T. Krapivinsky G.B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4113-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Overexpression of pICln in Xenopus oocytes interfered with spliceosomal biogenesis by inhibiting the interaction of Sm proteins with spliceosomal RNAs. Binding of pICln to core spliceosomal proteins also prevented Sm proteins from interacting with SMN (10.Krapivinsky G. Pu W. Wickman K. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10811-10814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the protein that is mutated in spinal muscular atrophy (14.Lefebvre S. Burglen L. Reboullet S.

SMN interaction with Sm proteins facilitates the assembly of Sm proteins on spliceosomal RNAs (13.Pu W.T. Krapivinsky G.B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4113-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar); disruption of this interaction may account, at least in part, for the inhibitory effect of pICln on spliceosomal biogenesis. The high degree of pICln sequence conservation between distant species, the ubiquitous pattern of pICln expression, and the interaction of pICln with proteins that are active in critical cellular pathways suggest that pICln is important for fundamental cellular processes. We used gene targeting in embryonic stem cells to ask whether pICln is essential for viability. Cloning and mapping of the 129Sv/J mouse genomic DNA fragment containing the two ICln coding sequence exons was described previously (3.Wickman K. Seldin M.F. James M.R. Gendler S.J. Clapham D.E. Genomics. 1997; 40: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In the targeting vector IClnKO-TV, the first coding exon was replaced by a neomycin resistance gene driven by the mouse phosphoglycerate kinase promoter (pgk-neo). The targeting vector Flox-neo-ICln is composed of a 10-kb fragment of ICln genomic DNA that has been modified by the insertion of a loxP site upstream of the first IClncoding exon. A pgk-neo cassette flanked by directly repeated loxP sites (21.Gorman J.R. van der Stoep N. Monroe R. Cogne M. Davidson L. Alt F.W. Immunity. 1996; 5: 241-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) was inserted downstream of the first IClncoding exon. Both targeting vectors also included a diphtheria toxin negative selection cassette. 129Sv/J ES cells (Genome Systems) were cultured on a monolayer of mitomycin-treated murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), transfected with linearized targeting construct, and selected for G418 resistance using standard protocols (Genome Systems). Drug-resistant colonies were screened by a PCR-based assay to identify homologous recombinants. Clones identified as homologous recombinants by PCR were amplified and tested by Southern analysis as described previously (22.Wickman K. Nemec J. Gendler S.J. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) using both internal and 3′ flanking probes. Where indicated, recombination between loxP sites was performed by transiently transfecting ES cells with a Cre expression vector (23.Gu H. Zou Y.R. Rajewsky K. Cell. 1993; 73: 1155-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Single colonies were picked in duplicate into 96-well dishes. Cells in one dish were grown in the presence of neomycin. Neomycin-sensitive colonies were amplified and genotyped by Southern blotting. Colonies containing the ICln Δ2 allele were subjected to a second round of purification by plating at low density and screening the resultant colonies for the proper genotype by Southern blotting. Chimeric mice were generated by injection of 8–20 ICln KO (+/−) ES cells into C57BL6/J blastocysts as described previously (22.Wickman K. Nemec J. Gendler S.J. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Male chimeric mice were back-crossed with C57Bl6/J females to obtain germline transmission of the targeted ICln allele. Timed matings were established between mice heterozygous for the ICln null allele, and embryos were isolated 3, 7, and 9 days following detection of a vaginal plug. DNA from tail samples as well as embryos was prepared as described (24.Spicer A.P. Rowse G.J. Lidner T.K. Gendler S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30093-30101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and genotyped by PCR. DNA from isolated blastocysts was prepared by freezing in 50 μl of 0.1× phosphate-buffered saline, heating to 95 °C for 8 min, incubating at 55 °C for 30 min in the presence of 10 μg of proteinase K, and then reheating at 95 °C for 8 min to destroy the enzyme. Total RNA was recovered from ES cells or NIH3T3 cells using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.). ES cells were grown in the absence of MEF feeder cells on gelatin-coated tissue culture dishes. 1 μg of total RNA was transcribed with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) using oligo(dT) primers. Serial dilutions of the reverse transcription reaction were then used as templates for PCR amplification. Twenty cycles of amplification were performed using primers that hybridize in separate exons. Products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized to a radiolabeled probe that anneals between the 5′ and 3′ primers. To investigate the requirement for pICln function in the mouse, we disrupted theICln gene in ES cells. Using a genomic DNA clone that contains a portion of the ICln gene (3.Wickman K. Seldin M.F. James M.R. Gendler S.J. Clapham D.E. Genomics. 1997; 40: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), we constructed a targeting vector (IClnKO-TV) that would eliminate the first coding exon (allele ICln KO ; Fig.1 a). ES cells were transfected with the targeting vector, and neomycin-resistant colonies were screened for homologous recombination. Of 192 neomycin resistant colonies tested, homologous recombination occurred in 16 (8%; Fig.1 b). When injected into blastocysts, two of these ES cell lines yielded highly chimeric mice that gave germline transmission of the ICln KO allele. Although ICln (+/−) ES cells show a 50% reduction in cellular pICln content as demonstrated by quantitative immunoblotting (data not shown), heterozygous animals showed no overt phenotype. No mice homozygous for the ICln null allele were born from heterozygous intercrosses from either mouse line. To determine the developmental stage at which homozygous embryos die, embryos from timed matings between ICln (+/−) mice were genotyped using PCR (Table I). In embryos obtained 3.5 days post-coitus, homozygous null embryos were present in the expected Mendelian ratio. In contrast, in embryos obtained 7.5 days post-coitus, no homozygous null embryos were present (n= 47), demonstrating that ICln is necessary early in gestation for embryonic viability.Table IGenotypes of embryos derived from timed matings between ICln (+/−) miceStageGenotype+/++/−−/−3.5 dpcadpc, days post-coitus.15 (17%)48 (55%)25 (28%)7.5 dpc13 (28%)34 (72%)0 (0%)9.5 dpc10 (43%)13 (57%)0 (0%)Post-natal66 (35%)124 (65%)0 (0%)a dpc, days post-coitus. Open table in a new tab We next asked whether ICln is essential for cellular viability. We used two sequential gene targeting steps to attempt to disrupt bothICln alleles in ES cells (Fig.2 a). In the first step, we used a targeting vector in which the first coding exon and a neomycin resistance marker were flanked by loxP sites. Of 96 neomycin resistant colonies, 3 (3%) were properly targeted, as determined by Southern blotting (Fig. 2 b). One properly targeted ES cell line was transiently transfected with a Cre recombinase expression plasmid. The resultant colonies were screened for the desired recombination event, which yielded neomycin-sensitive ES cell lines in which oneICln allele was disrupted (alleleICln Δ2 ; Fig. 2 b). One such ES cell line was transfected with the targeting vectorICln KO -TV, and neomycin-resistant colonies were selected. Of 480 neomycin resistant colonies screened by PCR, 22 (5%) were found to have undergone homologous recombination with the targeting vector. These were genotyped by Southern blotting (Fig.3 a). All homologous recombinants recovered contained the wild-type ICln allele, and none contained the IClnΔ 2 allele, indicating that in every case homologous recombination occurred between the targeting vector and the ICln Δ2 allele. Assuming that the second targeting vector recombined with theICln Δ2 and wild-type alleles with equal efficiency, the absence of homozygous null ES cells is highly significant (p < 10−7). This result strongly suggests that the ICln gene is essential for ES cell viability. ICln mRNA and protein are present in all of the adult tissues that we examined (1.Abe T. Takeuchi K. Ishii K.

Gendler S.J. Clapham D.E. Genomics. 1997; 40: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, the expression of pICln has not previously been demonstrated in undifferentiated cells. Consistent with our finding that a functional ICln allele is essential for ES cell viability, we found that ICln was expressed in wild-type embryonic stem cells (Fig. 3 b). A relatively small number of genes has been shown to be essential for embryonic viability prior to embryonic day 7.5 (TableII). These genes can be divided into those that are crucial for embryonic development, but not for cellular viability, and those that are essential for fundamental cellular processes such as RNA metabolism, intracellular vesicle transport, cell cycling, and DNA repair. Despite the requirement of the latter class of genes for cellular viability, embryos deficient in these genes often survive until stage E3.5–E7.5. The survival of these embryos to this point has generally been attributed to maternal stores of RNA and/or protein or to the functional redundancy of genes early in embryonic development (15.Copp A.J.

We have shown that embryos deficient in ICln degenerate between stages E3.5 and E7.5 and that ICln is essential for cellular viability. These findings demonstrate that pICln has an essential role in one or more of the basic cellular processes, consistent with the ubiquitous expression pattern of pICln and its high degree of conservation through evolution. By characterizing pICln interacting proteins, we have identified at least two candidate processes in which pICln may be active. pICln interacts with a homolog of yeast Skb1 (10.Krapivinsky G. Pu W.

MI130 translocates actin filaments in vitro in a Ca2+-regulated manner. A decrease in motility observed at higher Ca2+ concentrations has been attributed to calmodulin dissociation. To investigate mammalian myosin I regulation, we have coexpressed in baculovirus calmodulin and an epitope-tagged 85-kDa fragment representing the amino-terminal catalytic “motor” domain and the first calmodulin-binding IQ domain of ratmyr-1; we refer to this truncated molecule here as MI1IQ. Association of calmodulin to MI1IQ is Ca2+-insensitive. MI1IQ translocates actin filaments in vitro at a rate resembling MI130, but unlike MI130, does not exhibit sensitivity to 0.1–100 μm Ca2+. In addition to demonstrating successful expression of a functional truncated mammalian myosin Iin vitro, these results indicate that: 1) Ca2+-induced calmodulin dissociation from MI130in the presence of actin is not from the first IQ domain, 2) velocity is not affected by the length of the IQ region, and 3) the Ca2+ sensitivity of actin translocation exhibited by MI130 involves 1 or more of the other 5 IQ domains and/or the carboxyl tail.

Multiple myosin I isoforms have been identified in organisms as diverse as yeast and humans. At least four class I myosins, designated by their genes asmyr1–4, are widely expressed in higher eukaryotic cells (see Ref. 1.Coluccio L.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C347-C359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The myr-1 gene, which includes a motor domain followed by 6 calmodulin-binding, so-called IQ domains, and a carboxyl-terminal tail region (2.Ruppert C. Kroschewski R. Bähler M. J.

Quantitation of the amount of calmodulin associated with the purified 130-kDa myosin I heavy chain has indicated that the heavy chain copurifies with 6 molecules of calmodulin (4.Coluccio L.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2279-2284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although isoforms corresponding to the 5 IQ and 4 IQ variants are also expressed in liver (2.Ruppert C. Kroschewski R. Bähler M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). myr-1 is most closely related in sequence to brush border myosin I (BBMI), which in microvilli cross-links the core bundle of actin filaments to the membrane (6.Coluccio L.M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 495-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 7.Matsudaira P.T. Burgess D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 83: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Although expression of BBMI is essentially confined to intestine (8.Garcia A. Coudrier E. Carboni J. Anderson J. Vandekerkhove J. Mooseker M. Louvard D. Arpin M. J.

Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In NRK cells, MYR-1 is associated with the plasma membrane and in cell protrusions such as lamellipodia and membrane ruffles (10.Ruppert C. Godel J. Müller R.T. Kroschewski R. Reinhard J. Bähler M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3775-3786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some 130-kDa myosin I is found in association with several subcellular fractions from rat liver, but the majority of this isoform in liver cells is most likely cytoskeleton-associated (11.Balish M.F. Moeller III, E.F. Coluccio L.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 370: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These localization studies, together with recent kinetic analyses indicating among other things that the ATP-induced dissociation of actin-MI130 is slow, are consistent with a role for MYR-1 in maintenance of tension of the cytoskeleton (5.Coluccio L.M. Geeves M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21575-21580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The purified native 130-kDa myosin I translocates actin filaments in a Ca2+-regulated manner. Motility is highest atpCa 7–8, and then decreases with increasing Ca2+ concentration. At free Ca2+ concentrations above 0.1 μm, motility can be restored by the addition of exogenous calmodulin (12.Williams R. Coluccio L.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1994; 27: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). One interpretation supported by in vitro actin binding assays is that calmodulin dissociates in the presence of Ca2+ and that addition of excess calmodulin favors reassociation and therefore reestablishment of motility. To assist in the molecular characterization of the 130-kDa myosin I, we have expressed in insect cells using the baculovirus expression system, a truncated myosin I heavy chain of 85 kDa representing the amino-terminal 728 amino acids of MYR-1, which includes the motor domain and the first of the 6 IQ domains that comprise the so-called neck region. This truncated myosin I heavy chain was co-expressed with calmodulin. The purified truncated myosin I heavy chain and its associated calmodulin are referred to here as MI1IQ. Biochemical analyses of this truncated myosin I have permitted evaluation of properties conferred on the parent 130-kDa myosin I molecule by the motor domain and the association of calmodulin to the first of 6 IQ domains. MI1IQ exhibits steady state ATPase activities resembling the parent molecule. Our results also indicate that binding of calmodulin to the first IQ domain in MYR-1 is insensitive to Ca2+. Furthermore, we show that the truncated myosin I translocates actin filaments in vitro at a rate resembling that of the parent molecule, although unlike the parent molecule, the truncated form shows no sensitivity to Ca2+ in the range of 0.1–100 μm. These results are discussed in view of the current lever arm model relating velocity to the length of the IQ region. cDNA encoding the entire open reading frame ofmyr-1b, the kind gift of Drs. Martin Bähler and Christian Ruppert (Adolf-Butenandt-Institut, Zellbiologie, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, München, Germany), was used as a template for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with two mutagenic oligonucleotide primers. The forward primer flanked the start codon and incorporated an XbaI restriction enzyme site (5′-TATGACTAGAATTCTAGAATGGCCAAGAAGGAG-3′). The reverse primer (5′-TACATGCATTCTAGATCACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTG TAGTCTTTCATGAGCAGAAA-3′) was designed to incorporate a FLAG tag (amino acids DYKDDDDK) to aid in purification, followed by a stop codon and an XbaI site. The resulting construct coded for a truncated MYR-1 polypeptide chain terminating at lysine 728 followed by a COOH-terminal FLAG tag (Fig. 1). Human calmodulin cDNA (13.Tan R.Y. Mabuchi Y. Grabarek Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7479-7483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 14.Wawrzynczak E.J. Perham R.N. Biochem. Int. 1984; 9: 177-185PubMed Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR under standard conditions using a forward primer (5′-CAACTG ACTACGCTCGAGATGGCTGATCAG-3′) and a reverse primer (5′-TAAATCAAGTACATGCATTCATTTTGCAGT-3′) to produce a product that included the entire open reading frame and a 5′ XhoI cloning site and 3′ NsiI cloning site. Both the myr-1 and calmodulin PCR products were purified using the Wizard PCR Preps DNA purification system (Promega, Madison, WI). Constructs were digested with their respective enzymes, repurified, and ligated into the pFastBacDUAL transfer vector (Life Technologies, Inc.). The construct representing the truncated MYR-1 heavy chain was inserted downstream of the polyhedrin promoter, and the calmodulin construct was inserted into the p10 promoter cloning site. For the truncated heavy chain construct, the vector was dephosphorylated using calf alkaline phosphatase to prevent self-ligation, gel-purified, and the insert orientation was checked by digestion with BamHI. Both inserts were sequenced entirely with internal and vector-specific oligonucleotides using automated sequencing (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA) or done manually using the Sequenase kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom). All oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Expedite nucleic acid synthesizer (PerSpective Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The recombinant donor plasmid was transformed into DH10BacEscherichia coli cells (Life Technologies, Inc.) for transposition into the bacmid. Recombinant bacmid DNA was isolated by potassium acetate precipitation as described by the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression systems instruction manual supplied by Life Technologies, Inc. Virus was produced by transfecting the recombinant bacmid DNA into Spodoptera frugiperda 9 (Sf9) insect cells with Cellfectin reagent, followed by 3–4 days of growth. Subsequently, amplified virus was collected after 7 days and used to infect Sf9+ cells in suspension. Infection was allowed to proceed for 3 days, after which time cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min. Pellets were either used immediately for protein isolation or frozen in liquid N2and stored at −80 °C for future use. Cell pellets were gently homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 m KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm DTT, 0. 3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 5 mm ATP, 2.5 ml/ml packed cells), rocked for 1 h at 4 °C, and then centrifuged for 15 min at 23,000 × g. The supernatant was collected, and proteins precipitating between 35% and 70% ammonium sulfate were resuspended in TBS (10 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 0.15 mNaCl) and dialyzed against the same buffer overnight at 4 °C with one change of buffer. The sample was clarified at 100,000 ×g for 30 min and loaded three times onto an anti-FLAG affinity column (Sigma). After washing, MI1IQ was eluted with addition of FLAG peptide at 40–120 μg/ml. Fractions containing the recombinant protein were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 30–100 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT or as indicated. Protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Before use in the motility assays described below, MI1IQmolecules unable to bind actin in an ATP-reversible manner were removed by incubation for 30 min with 1.2 μm F-actin in the presence of 10 mm ATP, followed by centrifugation at 75,000 rpm for 20 min using a TLA100 rotor in a Beckman tabletop ultracentrifuge; the supernatant was recovered. SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to Laemmli (15.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) on 7.5%/15% polyacrylamide split mini-gels (16.Coluccio L.M.

Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase were obtained from Sigma. Detection was performed using the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Molecular weight markers included myosin II heavy chain, 200,000 Da; phosphorylase b, 93,000 Da; bovine serum albumin, 63,000 Da; ovalbumin, 43,000 Da; carbonic anhydrase, 31,000 Da; and soybean trypsin inhibitor, 21,000 Da. MI1IQ or the parent molecule, MI130, was applied to mica and rotary-shadowed as described previously (18.Mabuchi K. J. Struct. Biol. 1991; 107: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Electron micrographs were taken with a Phillips 300 electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 60 kV. ATPase assays were performed as described by Pollard (19.Pollard T.D. Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 24: 333-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-ATPase activity of myosin I was measured in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm CaCl2, and KCl concentrations as noted. The K+-ATPase activity was measured in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, and 2 mm EDTA. The actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity was performed in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmMgCl2, and the proper ratio of 2 mm EGTA and 2 mm CaEGTA to effect the indicated pCa (20.Ashley C.C. Moisescu D.G. J. Physiol. 1977; 270: 627-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 21.Moisescu D.G. Thieleczek R. J. Physiol. 1978; 275: 241-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The concentration of F-actin was varied from 0 to 30 μm. All reactions were done at 37 °C. Samples lacking either MI130/MI1IQ or actin served as controls. Standard curves were generated with known amounts of phosphate. For actin-activated ATPases, the reported values were corrected for activity due to the presence of actin. Rabbit skeletal muscle actin filaments (22.Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at 2 μm were incubated on ice in 10 mmTris, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm DTT, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and either 1 mm EGTA or CaCl2 from 0.1 to 1.0 mm with 0. 3 μm MI1IQ for 30 min. The samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min in a Beckman TLA-100 ultracentrifuge. Supernatants were separated from pellets. Pellets were resuspended in 1 m Tris base and prepared for SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After precipitation in 10% trichloroacetic acid, supernatant proteins were collected by microcentrifugation (15,000 × g for 2 min) and resuspended in 1 m Tris base followed by preparation for SDS-PAGE. Equivalent amounts of supernatants and pellets were analyzed by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Binding of calmodulin to the truncated heavy chain was examined by incubating 200 μl of MI1IQ at 50 μg/ml in 1 mm EGTA or 0.2 mmCa2+ with 30 μl of anti-FLAG-Sepharose beads. After 30 min on ice, the beads were collected by microcentrifugation and heated in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The supernatants were collected, precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, dissolved in 1m Tris base, then heated in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Equivalent amounts of supernatants and pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by densitometric analyses with NIH Image software. The ability of MI130 and MI1IQ to translocate actin filaments was determinedin vitro using the sliding filament assay adapted from Toyoshima et al. (23.Toyoshima Y.Y. Kron S.J. McNally E.M. Niebling K.R. Toyoshima C. Spudich J.A. Nature. 1987; 328: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Coverslips were coated with 0.1% nitrocellulose in amyl acetate, and flow chambers were constructed by attaching the nitrocellulose-coated coverslips face down to a glass slide using double-sided sticky tape. Ten microliters of the myosin solution at ∼150 μg/ml was infused and incubated for 2 min and then washed with 50 μl buffer M (10 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, 20 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT) containing 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 2 min. Ten microliters of 0.024 μmrabbit skeletal muscle F-actin labeled with rhodamine phalloidin (prepared as suggested by Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was infused and allowed to bind for 1 min. The chamber was washed with 50 μl of buffer M containing 5 mg/ml BSA prior to initiation of motility with the addition of buffer M with 3 mm ATP, 0.5% methyl cellulose, 50 mm DTT, 3 mg/ml glucose, 0.2 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 0.1 mg/ml catalase, and CaCl2 and EGTA to effect final free Ca2+ concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 μm as previously determined (12.Williams R. Coluccio L.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1994; 27: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Slides were examined with a Nikon fluorescence microscope using a 100× oil immersion lens (Nikon Inc., Melville, NY) equipped with a heat stage to maintain temperature in the specimen chamber at 37 °C. Images were recorded digitally using a Scion LG-3 capture board (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD) and IPLab Scientific Image Processing software (Scanalytics, Inc., Fairfax, VA). The distance moved by numerous filaments over a fixed time was determined. Data are presented as average ± standard error (number). Images of blots and polyacrylamide gels were captured with a U-Max SuperVista X-12 scanner and prepared for publication with Adobe Photoshop. Native MI130 was prepared from rat liver by gel filtration, cation, and anion exchange chromatography as described previously (3.Coluccio L.M. Conaty C. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1993; 24: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Actin was prepared according to Ref.22.Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Addition of increasing amounts of FLAG peptide from 40 to 120 μg/ml resulted in elution of polypeptides of 85 and 17 kDa from an anti-FLAG affinity column loaded with extracts of Sf9 cells designed to co-express both a truncated myosin I and calmodulin (Fig.2). The smaller polypeptide comigrated with calmodulin in samples containing native rat liver 130-kDa myosin I (Figs. 2 (lanes 9, 10, and12) and 3A(lanes 1 and 2)). The 85 kDa polypeptide was recognized in immunoblots with anti-myr-1 (Tü30; Fig. 3 B) and anti-FLAG (M2; Fig. 3 C). The yield was approximately 200 μg/liter of insect cells.Figure 3Immunoblot of MI1IQ with anti-myosin I, Tü30 (panel B) and anti-FLAG (panel C). Panel A, Coomassie Blue-stained gel.

Molecules of native rat liver MI130 were shaped like tadpoles, i.e. they have a globular head and elongated tail (Fig. 4, top panel). On the other hand, the expressed truncated myosin I molecules appeared globular (Fig. 4, bottom panel). This is consistent with the expected morphology since the expressed myosin I has an abbreviated calmodulin-binding region and lacks altogether the carboxyl-terminal tail. The ATPase activity of the expressed truncated myosin I was assessed beginning with the dependence on KCl in the presence of EDTA and compared with the native parent molecule (Fig.5 A). The ATPase activity of both the parent molecule and the truncated fragment decreased with increasing amounts of KCl from 30 to 500 mm. These results are in contrast to those observed in 5 mmCaCl2, conditions in which the ATPase activity of both the parent molecule (0.44 s−1) and the expressed truncated form (0.40 s−1) were relatively unaffected by changes in KCl concentration (Fig. 5 B). In the absence of actin, the Mg2+-ATPase activity was low (0.015 s−1) and independent of the calcium ion concentration. The ATPase activity was activated by increasing amounts of F-actin as a function of the free Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 6 A). At 20 μm actin, the ATPase was activated 3.5-fold atpCa 8.9 and 12.5-fold at pCa 4.6. Similar results were observed for the native molecule (Fig. 6 B) with a small decrease in the [Ca2+] required for activation. Note that, for both proteins, Ca2+ acts as a modulator of actin activation and not as an on/off switch. Some reduction in actin activation was apparent at pCa > 4.6, and this may explain the variability in the Ca2+ dependence of the actin-activated ATPases reported previously. Co-sedimentation assays indicated that myosin I fragment sediments in an actin-dependent manner (Fig. 7). More MI1IQconsistently pelleted with actin in buffers containing Ca2+ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 mm than in 1 mm EGTA. Quantitation of the amount of MI1IQ binding to 2 μm actin indicates that 70% of the heavy chain pelleted with EGTA versus 90% in 0.1 mm or 100% in 1 mm CaCl2. The behavior of calmodulin in regard to its association with actin mimics the heavy chain. Little or no change in the amount of calmodulin associating with the heavy chain was observed as a consequence of increasing CaCl2 concentration from 0.1 to 1.0 mm. The effect of CaCl2 on the association of calmodulin with MI1IQ was examined using immunoabsorption on anti-FLAG-Sepharose beads followed by separation of supernatants and pellets (Fig. 8). In buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and either 1 mmEGTA (−Ca2+) or 0.2 mm CaCl2(+Ca2+), all of the myosin I fragment (10 μg) bound to the Sepharose beads. Similarly, the majority of the calmodulin in either 1 mm EGTA or 0.2 mm Ca2+remained associated with the heavy chain and appeared in the pellets. Although some calmodulin appears in both supernatants, presumably as a consequence of the treatment, no difference in the percentage is observed ±Ca2+ (22% versus 23% as determined by densitometry). As a control, we first confirmed that purified rat liver 130-kDa myosin I translocates actin filaments in a Ca2+-regulated manner over a pCa range of 4–7. Conditions were chosen so that no movement of the actin filaments was observed without the addition of ATP. With ATP and at pCa 7, the average rate of translocation by MI130 was 0.077 ± 0.007 μm/s. At pCa 4, in the presence of ATP, very few filaments moved, and the rate of those that did move was considerably slower (data not shown). Next, we investigated whether MI1IQ translocates actin filaments in vitro. Our results indicate that rhodamine phalloidin-labeled actin filaments bind to a surface to which MI1IQ is attached. No movement was observed in the absence of ATP. Upon addition of ATP, most of the actin filaments in each field moved. At 0.1 μm Ca2+, the average velocity was 0.048 ± 0.002 μm/s (Fig. 9). With increasing free Ca2+ concentration to 100 μm, little change in the percentage of filaments moving or their average velocity was observed (Fig. 9). To duplicate samples, bacterially expressed calmodulin was added to a final concentration of 1 μm. An approximately 20% increase in the rate was observed at each calcium ion condition. These studies indicate that coexpression in baculovirus of a truncated myosin I representing the motor domain and a partial neck region consisting of one calmodulin-binding domain together with calmodulin results in a functional molecule in terms of its ability to bind and translocate actin filaments. Furthermore, baculovirus expression of this two-subunit enzyme does not result in detectable denaturation or proteolysis. Other reports of successful expression in baculovirus of any of the many known myosins include truncated forms of nonmuscle (24.Pato M.D. Sellers J.R. Preston Y.A. Harvey E.V. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2689-2695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and smooth muscle myosin II (25.Trybus K.M. Waller G.S. Chatman T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and the mammalian myosin I, MMIβ (26.Zhu T. Sata M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 27.Zhu T. Beckingham K. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20481-20486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As observed with the intact 130-kDa myosin I 2L. Coluccio, unpublished results. and BBMI (16.Coluccio L.M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), binding of the truncated myosin I to actin is sensitive to the Ca2+concentration with more heavy chain binding in the presence of Ca2+ than in its absence. Unlike most calmodulin-dependent enzymes, binding of calmodulin to myosin I does not require Ca2+. Accordingly, isolation of MI1IQ is performed in the presence of EGTA without loss of calmodulin. Furthermore, we have demonstrated by immunoabsorption with anti-FLAG that calmodulin binding to the truncated MYR-1 is insensitive to Ca2+. Some calmodulin is released into the supernatant in the presence of Ca2+ and actin when sedimentation assays are done with the parent molecule, indicating that calmodulin binding to at least one of the IQ domains in the parent molecule is Ca2+-sensitive. Similar assays done with BBMI also result in release of some of the calmodulin from the complex in the presence of actin in CaCl2-containing buffers (16.Coluccio L.M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We have observed that in the presence of actin filaments, calmodulin remains associated with the MI1IQ heavy chain in buffers containing Ca2+, indicating that binding of calmodulin to the first IQ domain is not Ca2+-sensitive. These results illustrate the disparity in behavior among IQ domains. We have determined that MI1IQ translocates actin filamentsin vitro. The overall rate of movement was 0.048 ± .002 μm/s versus 0.077 ± .007 μm/s observed in this study and 0.03–0.05 μm/s observed previously for the parent molecule under the same conditions of 0.1 μm free Ca2+ (12.Williams R. Coluccio L.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1994; 27: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The present study benefits from advancements made in the analysis of the motility data, which might be responsible for the small discrepancy between the two values obtained for the parent molecule. The velocity of Dictyostelium myosin II mutants was found to be linearly related to the length of the neck region (28.Uyeda T.Q. Abramson P.D. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4459-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), which supports the hypothesis that the neck region of myosin functions as a lever arm, which can amplify small changes originating in the motor domain in order to produce larger conformational changes resulting in movement (i.e. steps; see Refs. 29.Spudich J.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar and 30.Holmes K.C. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R112-R118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results do not support this model for myosin I since the velocity observed for the truncated molecule with 1 IQ domain is only slightly lower than that observed for the purified parent molecule, which contains at least 4 and up to 6 calmodulins (2.Ruppert C. Kroschewski R. Bähler M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 4.Coluccio L.M. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2279-2284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Velocity in the motility assay is related to the duty cycle and step size (31.Warshaw D.M. News Physiol. Sci. 1996; 11: 1-7Google Scholar). Recent studies with an optical laser trap have indicated that MI130 produces movement in two distinct steps for an overall motion of 11 nm (32.Veigel C. Coluccio L.M. Jontes J.D. Sparrow J.C. Milligan R.A. Molloy J.E. Nature. 1999; 398: 530-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Future laser trap studies will reveal whether the step size exhibited by MI1IQ by virtue of its truncated neck region is smaller. No change in the ability of truncated MYR-1 to translocate actin filaments is observed in buffers containing increasing amounts of free Ca2+ from 0.1 to 100 μm. This is in direct contrast to results obtained with either the parent molecule or BBMI, where increasing Ca2+ concentrations inhibit the ability of MI130 (12.Williams R. Coluccio L.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1994; 27: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and BBMI (33.Collins K. Sellers J.R. Matsudaira P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110 (L. M.): 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) to support motility. Since addition of exogenous calmodulin permits actin filament translocation by these myosins I at the higher Ca2+ concentrations, it has been supposed that calmodulin dissociation is in part responsible for the attenuation of activity seen at higher Ca2+concentrations. Since we do not see a change in the rate of actin translocation by MI1IQ as a function of Ca2+concentration, our results indicate that the decrease in motor activity observed with MI130 in buffers containing Ca2+cannot be due to a Ca2+-induced change in or dissociation of calmodulin from the first IQ domain. In the presence of exogenous calmodulin, there is an approximate 20% increase in the rate of movement of actin filaments by MI1IQ at all thepCa conditions tested. We attribute this to the possibility that some of the calmodulin associated with the expressed protein is dissociating at the very low protein concentrations at which the motility assays are performed, but this effect is not a function of Ca2+ concentration. Recently, Zhu et al. (27.Zhu T. Beckingham K. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20481-20486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) coexpressed the myr-2/MM1β heavy chain along with calmodulins mutant in their ability to bind Ca2+ and concluded that the decrease in motility of MMIβ observed with increasing Ca2+ concentration is due to Ca2+binding to calmodulin, which occurs at lower Ca2+concentrations than required for calmodulin dissociation. The actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activities of MI1IQ and MI130 exhibit a Ca2+-sensitivity; however, translocation of actin filamentsin vitro by either MI1IQ or MI130does not increase in buffers containing increasing amounts of Ca2+. These results indicate that the Ca2+sensitivity of the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity is not directly coupled to motility. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear; however, it is understood that translating motor activity as measured by ATPase activity into movement as measured by the ability to translocate F-actin relies on a number of factors, not the least of which is the orientation which the motor molecule assumes on the substrate (23.Toyoshima Y.Y. Kron S.J. McNally E.M. Niebling K.R. Toyoshima C. Spudich J.A. Nature. 1987; 328: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). As described in the accompanying article (34.Geeves M.A. Perreault-Micale C. Coluccio L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21624-21630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we have also observed that MI1IQ exhibits transient kinetic properties indistinguishable from the parent molecule. In addition, our results indicate that in equilibrium, actin-myosin I exists in two forms, one of which is unable to bind ATP. The ability to express myosin I constructs in baculovirus enables the design of future studies using mutational analyses to investigate the importance of specific regions of the molecules in various biochemical properties including motility. We are indebted to Dr. Alex Toker for instruction and assistance with the baculovirus expression system. The studies benefited from the thoughtful comments of Drs. Andrew Szent-Györgyi (Brandeis University, Waltham, MA) and Michael A. Geeves (University of Kent, Canterbury, United Kingdom). We thank Dr. Martin Bähler for gifts of both cDNA and myosin I antibodies. We thank Erick Moeller for assistance in setting up the motility assays, Jessica Jaime for technical assistance, and Dr. Katsuhide Mabuchi for preparation of the rotary shadowed samples. The kind support shown to C. P.-M. from Dr. James P. Morgan (Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital, Boston, MA), during the course of this work is appreciated."

In addition to phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylinositol phosphate, and their corresponding lyso-derivatives, we found that two novel lipids underwent phosphorylation in envelopes, particularly in the presence of carrier-free [γ-32P]ATP. These two lipids incorporated radioactive phosphate in chloroplasts in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP or [32P]Pi and light. Interestingly, these two lipids were preferentially phosphorylated in envelope membranes in the presence [γ-32P]CTP, as the phosphoryl donor, or [γ-32P]ATP, when supplemented with CDP and nucleoside diphosphate kinase II. The lipid kinase activity involved in this reaction was specifically inhibited in the presence of cytosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) (CTPγS) and sensitive to CTP chase, thereby showing that both lipids are phosphorylated by an envelope CTP-dependent lipid kinase. The lipids were identified as phosphorylated galactolipids by using an acid hydrolysis procedure that generated galactose 6-phosphate. CTPγS did not affect the import of the small ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase subunit into chloroplasts, the possible physiological role of this novel CTP-dependent galactolipid kinase activity in the chloroplast envelope is discussed.

One of the main functions assigned to the chloroplast is its ability to assimilate CO2 under illumination. This key activity must be separated from the rest of the cell by a selective membrane barrier, namely the envelope, which is one of the three main plastid compartments in addition to thylakoids and the stroma. The envelope is constituted of two membranes, the inner and the outer envelopes, each having its own specific characteristic and property (1.Joyard J. Teyssier E. Miège C. Berny-Seigneurin D.

Lipid phosphorylation occurs in chloroplast envelope membranes (2.Siegenthaler P.A. Müller M.O. Bovet L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The first identified lipids incorporating phosphate from [γ-32P]ATP in isolated envelope vesicles were lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), 1The abbreviations are: LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; PA, phosphatidic acid; PIP, phosphatidylinositol phosphate; LPIP, lysophosphatidylinositol phosphate; Chl, chlorophyll; DAG, diacylglycerol; DGDG, digalactosyl diacylglycerol; DGpDG, digalactosylphosphate diacylglycerol; LMGpDG, lysomonogalactosylphosphate diacylglycerol; MGDG, monogalactosyl diacylglycerol; MGpDG, monogalactosylphosphate diacylglycerol; NDPK, nucleoside diphosphate kinase; PEI, polyethyleneimine; PLA2, phospholipase A2; pSSu, precursor protein of the ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase small subunit; TLC, thin layer chromatography; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; Tricine,N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); CTPγS, cytosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP), and lysophosphatidylinositol phosphate (LPIP). At the present time, the functions of these phospholipids are not known in chloroplasts, but: (i) they might produce substrates for lipid biosynthesis pathways; for instance, PIP can serve as substrate for a phosphatidylinositol-4,5-phosphate kinase and eventually can be hydrolyzed in second messengers like inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and DAG (3.Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar); (ii) they could directly interact with intracellular proteins to affect their location and/or activity; (iii) they might also change the local topology of other lipids, thereby modifying electrostatic interactions of membrane components. Indeed, in mammalian systems, LPA and PA, as minor cell lipids, are likely to act as potent activators of plasma membrane tyrosine kinase via G protein activation and intracellular protein kinases (4.English D. Cell Signal. 1996; 8: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 5.Corven E.J. Rijswijk A. Jalink K. Bend R.L. Blitterswijk W.J. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). PA is the product ofsn-diacylglycerol phosphorylation catalyzed by a diacylglycerol kinase (6.Blitterswijk W.J. Houssa B. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In plant signaling pathways, PA is also derived from PC via phospholipase D (7.Munnick T. Irvine R.F. Musgrave A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1389: 222-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) and from diacylglycerol pyrophosphate (8.Riedel B. Morr M. Wu W.I. Carman G.M. Wissing J.B. Plant Sci. 1998; 128: 1-10Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The production of LPA usually occurs after a first rapid accumulation of DAG, followed by phosphorylation, and activation of a PA-specific phospholipase A2 within the plasma membrane (9.Nietgen G.W. Durieux M.E. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1998; 5: 221-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In plants, a diacylglycerol kinase from Arabidopsis thaliana (10.Katagiri T. Mizoguchi T. Shinozaki K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 647-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and LPA, a product of inducible PLA2(11.Scherer G.F. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1994; 48: 229-242PubMed Google Scholar), have been identified, but their specific role as second messengers has still not been confirmed. The presence of PIP and its lysoderivative has also been reported in plant plasma membranes (12.Boss W.F. Boss W.F. Morré D.J. Second Messengers in Plant Growth and Development. 6. Alan R. Liss, Inc., New York1989: 29-56Google Scholar). Although PIP is likely to be a substrate for PIP kinase (13.Drobak B.K. Dewey R.E. Boss W.F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1999; 189: 95-130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and LPIP is possibly generated by an endo-phospholipase A2, their respective roles have not yet been elucidated in plants. The presence of lipid kinase activities in chloroplast envelope membranes suggests that signal transduction pathways and/or membrane protein regulation occur in envelopes. This possibility is supported by the fact that small G proteins are present in envelope membranes (14.Sasaki Y. Sekiguchi K. Nagano Y. Matsuno R. FEBS Lett. 1991; 293: 124-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), as well as specific protein kinase activities (15.Bovet L. Müller M.O. Siegenthaler P.A. Planta. 1995; 195: 563-569Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Such response pathways should therefore occur for cross-talk between stroma and cytosol. Envelopes are also known to be a major site for lipid biogenesis, translocation of nuclear encoded proteins and metabolites, and coordination of the expression of nuclear and plastid genomes (1.Joyard J. Teyssier E. Miège C. Berny-Seigneurin D. Maréchal E. Block M.A. Dorne A.J. Rolland N. Ajlani G. Douce R. Plant Physiol. 1999; 118: 715-723Crossref Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Therefore, all these activities have to be controlled by fine tuning such as membrane topology and posttranslational modification that may involve lipid phosphorylation activities. Interestingly, other envelope membrane lipids such as galactolipids (MGDG, DGDG, and trigalactosyl diacylglycerol) and phosphatidylglycerol molecular species (16.Maréchal E. Block M.A. Dorne A.J. Douce R. Joyard J. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 65-77Crossref Google Scholar, 17.Xu Y. Siegenthaler P.A. Lipids. 1996; 31: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) are also putative substrates for phosphorylation, because both lipid classes have at least one free hydroxyl group that is able to receive phosphate from a phosphodiester high energy bond. The present report documents for the first time a CTP-dependent galactolipid kinase activity in chloroplast envelope membranes. Spinach plasma membranes were a kind gift of Dr. C. Larsson (Department of Plant Biochemistry, Lund University, Lund, Sweden). Spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) leaves were purchased from the local market and intact chloroplasts purified according to Mourioux and Douce (18.Mourioux G. Douce R. Plant Physiol. 1981; 67: 470-473Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thylakoid membranes were exempted from envelope membrane contamination by using a 5% Percoll gradient as described previously (19.Rawyler A. Meylan M. Siegenthaler P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 1104: 331-341Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Envelope membranes were isolated from intact chloroplasts according to the method of Douce and Joyard (20.Douce R. Joyard J. Edman M. Hallick R.B. Chua N.H. Methods in Chloroplast Molecular Biology. Elsevier Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1982: 239-259Google Scholar). Inner and outer envelope membranes were prepared according to the method of Keegstra and Youssif (21.Keegstra K. Youssif A.E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 316-325Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar), modified by Siegenthaler and Dumont (22.Siegenthaler P.A. Dumont N. Plant Cell Physiol. 1990; 31: 1101-1108Google Scholar). The protein concentrations of plasma and envelope membranes were determined using the methods described previously (23.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar, 24.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randal R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Envelope membranes (200 μg) were incubated in the presence of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), 5 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm Mops (pH 7.6) at 25 °C for 5 min in a final volume of 200 μl. The lipid kinase reaction was stopped by mixing the samples with 1.5 ml of cold chloroform/methanol (1:2). After adding the chloroform/methanol to phosphorylated envelopes, 100 nmol of PA (Sigma), 100 nmol of LPA (Sigma), and 600 nmol of a phospholipid mixture containing PIP2, PIP, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylserine (Sigma) were added as carriers. Lipid extraction was carried out by immediately adding 0.8 ml of HCl/EDTA-Na2 (1.25 N:0.5 mm) and 0.5 ml of cold chloroform and vortexing thoroughly. The two-phase separation was achieved by centrifugation at 3000 ×g for 2 min. The lower phase containing the lipids was first washed with 1 ml of cold methanol/HCl (1:1) and then with 1 ml of cold methanol/H2O/25% NH3 (10:8:2). The lower phase was finally dried under nitrogen and dissolved in 100 μl of chloroform/methanol (3:1). The samples were spotted on silica gel plates, preactivated with a solution of potassium oxalate and heated at 110 °C for 20 min just before use (25.Heim S. Wagner K.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 134: 1175-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The plates were developed with chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (40:15:13:12:8) at room temperature for 45 min. The lipids were visualized under UV light after spraying a solution of acetone/water (60:40) containing 0.01% primuline (w/v). The 32P-labeled lipids were detected using Kodak X-Omat AR films (2.Siegenthaler P.A. Müller M.O. Bovet L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). [γ-32P]CTP was synthesized enzymatically using recombinant NDPK-II (0.1 μg) as the phosphotransferase in a final volume of 20 μl containing 10 mm Mops-NaOH (pH 7.6), 0.01 mm CDP, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.01 mm CDP, and 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 5 min at 25 °C (26.Bovet L. Meylan-Bettex M. Eggmann T. Martinoia E. Siegenthaler P.A. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1999; 37: 1-9Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The reaction was blocked by adding 50 mm EDTA-Na2. For its purification, [γ-32P]CTP was resolved on preparative TLC using PEI-cellulose plate (Merck) and 0.75 mKH2PO4-H3PO4 (pH 3.65) as solvent. After autoradiography of the plate using Biomax MR films (Eastman Kodak Co.), [γ-32P]CTP was scrapped and eluted in 50 μl of Mops-NaOH (pH 7.6). The removal of PEI-cellulose was achieved by filtration on a Bio-Spin column (Bio-Rad) and sedimentation at 16,000 × g for 30 s. The activity of [γ-32P]CTP was quantified by Cerenkov counting. The compound was synthesized enzymatically following the method outlined previously (27.Goody R.S. Eckstein F. Schirmer R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 276: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and 0.5 mm MgCl2 (10 ml, total volume) with 50 mg of CDP (from Sigma), 25 mg of ATPγS (from Fluka) and 500 units of nucleoside diphosphate kinase from yeast (Sigma) at 20 °C for 3.5 h. The reaction mixture was dried on a rotary evaporator and the residue dissolved in 2 ml of water. An analytical reverse phase HPLC, using a Waters Millipore Model 510 instrument (column size: 250 × 4 mm with Hypersil ODS, 5 μ), with a linear gradient of 50 mm triethylammonium acetate from 0% to 10.5% acetonitrile during 20 min showed four prominent peaks. The solution was subjected to purification by preparative reverse phase HPLC on a DuPont 850 liquid chromatograph (column size: 250 × 10 mm with Hypersil ODS, 5 μ) by multiple injections with a linear gradient of 100 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate (pH 7.5) from 0% to 7% acetonitrile for 30 min. UV absorption was monitored at 260 nm. The elution profile showed seven peaks, of which the fourth was collected. The material of all injections was combined, evaporated to dryness, and subjected to an analytical HPLC as above. Fractions containing the desired compound as monitored by the UV spectrum and a retention time slower than that of CTP were combined (181 A 272 units). This material was treated with alkaline phosphatase (80 units in a 1.2-ml total volume) for 2 h to degrade all material devoid of a terminal phosphorothioate. Dithiothreitol was added (final concentration 6 mm) to reduce the dimeric CTPγS resulting from oxidation. The solution was subjected to a second preparative HPLC purification, where the major peak was collected. Analytical HPLC showed a major peak at 9.12 min (CTPγS) and a minor one (13%) of (CTPγS)2. The characteristics of the system were as follows: yield, 13 micromol; UV absorption, λmax 272 nm. 31P NMR (δ values): 34.39, d (γP); −10.27, d (αP); −21.80 and −22.00, 2 d (bP). This spectrum is consistent with CTPγS (28.Eckstein F. Goody R.S. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1685-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Retention times on analytical HPLC were as follows: CTPγS, 9.12 min; (CTPγS)2, 15.20 min; CTP, 7.42 min; CDP, 5.21 min; ATPγS, 16.29 min; ADP, 12.51 min. After TLC analysis, silica gel plate zones containing lipids X and Y were carefully scrapped and extracted in 4 ml of chloroform/methanol (53:37 v/v) previously mixed with 2 ml of 500 mm KCl. The phase containing lipids was evaporated under N2 and subjected to acid hydrolysis in the presence of 0.1 m HCl at 90 °C for 2 h. The mixture was dried using a Rotavap (Büchi, Switzerland) and resuspended in 20 μl of ethanol/H2O (1:1) supplemented with 2 mg of Dowex 50 W × 4 (H+ form). Aliquots (2 μl) of both hydrolysis products were separated either on Silica 60 TLC or cellulose plates (0.1 μm) using as solvents methanol/H2O (40:10) containing 26 mm HCOOH, 1 mmEDTA-Na2 or methanol/formic acid/H2O (85:15:5). As markers, glucose-6-32P and galactose-6-32P were prepared by incubating 100 mm glucose or 100 mm galactose in the presence of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 50 mm Mops-NaOH (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2 and 1 unit of yeast hexokinase (EC2.7.1.1, Sigma) at 25 °C for 10 min and spotted on plates. 35S-Met-labeled pSSu was synthesized from pSSu/pET8c using the TNT quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Chloroplasts were isolated from spinach leaves and used for the import of the labeled translation products under standard conditions (29.Pain D. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3288-3292Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The quantitative determination of chlorophylls was performed according to Ref. 30.Bruinsma J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1961; 53: 576-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar. Chloroplast preparations were adjusted to 1 mg ml−1chlorophyll before import experiments. Aliquots (25 μg of Chl) were removed from the mixture after different times of incubation at 26 °C under dim light and the chloroplasts re-isolated through 40% (v/v) percoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In parallel an identical series of chloroplasts was incubated with thermolysin (0.2 mg ml−1) at 4 °C for 15 min, before re-isolation of the chloroplasts onto Percoll. Proteins were finally resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and35S-labeled bands visualized by autoradiography using Biomax MR films (Kodak) after gel drying. The chloroplasts (1 mg of Chl/ml) were incubated in 330 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tricine-NaOH (pH 7.8), 1 mmCaCl2, 200 μg/ml thermolysin for 1 h at 4 °C as described in Ref. 31.Dorne A.J. Block M.A. Joyard J. Douce R. FEBS Lett. 1982; 145: 30-34Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar. The protease activity was blocked by adding 10 mm EGTA to the medium. In this case, “non-treated” with thermolysin means that enzyme was added but inhibited by 1 mm EGTA-Na2, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, and 2 mm ε-aminocaproic acid during the 1-h incubation. Repurification of the chloroplasts was done after loading onto 40% Percoll, 330 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tricine-NaOH (pH 7.8) supplemented with the following protease inhibitors (5 mm ε-aminocaproic acid, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 20 min. Chloroplasts were finally washed twice before envelope membrane isolation in the same medium free of Percoll. Envelope membranes were then phosphorylated and lipids extracted under standard procedure. We have previously identified four phosphorylated lipids in envelope membranes, namely PA, LPA, PIP, and LPIP (2.Siegenthaler P.A. Müller M.O. Bovet L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). They were originally found after 32P labeling of envelope membranes using a mixture of carrier-free [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of 0.05 mm ATP (Fig.1 A, lane 2). As shown in Fig. 1 A (lane 1), the labeling of these four lipids was also found in the presence of carrier-free [γ-32P]ATP alone, but to a lesser extent for PA, LPA and PIP. Interestingly, three other lipids underwent strong labeling under this phosphorylation condition, namely X, Y, and Z. The lipid Z comigrates with the LPIP marker, but there is still no conclusive proof that this lipid corresponds to LPIP (Fig.1 A, compare lanes 1 and 2). As shown in Fig. 1 B, the lipid phosphorylation took place in envelope membranes exclusively. Nevertheless, a slight labeling in PA and LPA was found in thylakoid membranes which likely resulted from a small contamination with envelope membranes (19.Rawyler A. Meylan M. Siegenthaler P.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 1104: 331-341Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In chloroplasts, the labeling of lipids occurred in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and was not dependent on the plastid integrity (Fig. 1 C). Indeed, the disruption of envelope membranes by osmotic shock had no effect on lipid phosphorylation. This observation is partially and indirectly confirmed by comparing lipid phosphorylation patterns after incubation of intact chloroplasts with [32P]Pi and light (Fig. 1 D,left) or with [γ-32P]ATP (Fig.1 D, right). Indeed, under both conditions, PA, LPA, X, and Y were labeled, therefore indicating that both chloroplastic and exogenous sources of ATP can generate phosphorylated lipids. In contrast, labeled phosphatidylinositol derivatives comigrating with LPIP, PIP, and PIP2 used [γ-32P]ATP, exclusively. Recent experiments have shown that the main nucleotides formed after incubation of intact chloroplasts with [γ-32P]ATP as well as with a ribonucleoside diphosphate mixture were [γ-32P]CTP and [γ-32P]UTP (26.Bovet L. Meylan-Bettex M. Eggmann T. Martinoia E. Siegenthaler P.A. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1999; 37: 1-9Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). To determine whether CDP and UDP were labeled in intact chloroplasts in the absence of exogenous NDPs, the experiments were repeated using intact chloroplasts incubated in the presence of [32P]Pi and light or [γ-32P]ATP (Fig.2 A, right andleft). The data show that, in both cases, [γ-32P]CTP was formed. Apparently, no exogenous CDP is required to synthesize labeled CTP in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. In addition, Fig. 2 A(right) shows that the chloroplastic ATP rapidly and continuously phosphorylated GDP and CDP, but added [γ-32P]ATP had a preference for CDP (left). In lysed chloroplasts (data not shown), the synthesis of [γ-32P]CTP was strongly reduced compared with intact organelles, suggesting that the integrity of the plastid is necessary for this nucleotide phosphotransferase activity. These experiments and the knowledge that CTP is also a specific substrate for farnesol and dolichol phosphorylation (32.Szopinska A. Nowak L. Swiezewska E. Palamarczyk G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 266: 124-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 33.Thai L. Rush J.S. Maul J.E. Devarenne T. Rodgers D.L. Chappell J. Waechter C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13080-13085Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) encouraged us to investigate whether CTP also plays a role in the envelope lipid phosphorylation. The incubation of envelope membranes in the presence of purified NDPK-II (34.Bovet L. Siegenthaler P.A. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1997; 128: 169-180Google Scholar) (as the phosphotransferase), [γ-32P]ATP, and CDP was performed (Fig. 2 B). The data show that the presence of NDPK-II itself did not significantly modify the lipid phosphorylation pattern compared with control conditions (compare lanes 1 and 2). However, the addition of NDPK-II in the presence of CDP markedly stimulated the specific incorporation of labeled phosphate into X and Y (lane 4). This observation suggests that [γ-32P]CTP, resulting from the phosphotransfer of the terminal phosphate of [γ-32P]ATP to CDP, is the preferential substrate for the lipid kinase(s) in this phosphorylation process. The addition of CDP alone also stimulated, although to a lesser extent, the labeling of X and Y (lane 3), thus indicating that phosphotransferase activities are present in envelope membranes. In the next step, we wished to demonstrate that lipids X and Y specifically incorporated [32P] from [γ-32P]CTP. As [γ-32P]CTP is not commercially available, it was enzymatically produced by phosphotransfer from [γ-32P]ATP to CDP in the presence of NDPK-II (26.Bovet L. Meylan-Bettex M. Eggmann T. Martinoia E. Siegenthaler P.A. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1999; 37: 1-9Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). After separation on PEI-cellulose TLC (Fig.3 A), [γ-32P]CTP was scrapped from the plate and the TLC matrix carefully removed by filtration and sedimentation. [γ-32P]CTP was then used as potential phosphorylation substrate for envelope lipids (Fig. 3 B). Minute amounts (corresponding to 3 nCi, about 1 fmol) of carrier-free [γ-32P]CTP (lane 1) and [γ-32P]ATP (lane 2) were used as labeled nucleotides. The data show that labeling in X and Y was stronger with the pyrimidine nucleotide than with the purine one. The CTP-dependent lipid kinase is apparently localized exclusively in envelope membranes, because X and Y were not found to be labeled when plasma membrane preparations (compare Fig. 3 C,lanes 1 and 2) were subjected to phosphorylation with [γ-32P]CTP. These results indicate that the unlabeled membrane lipid molecules leading to X and Y were phosphorylated by an envelope lipid kinase(s) specific for [γ-32P]CTP. As far as we know, although some phosphotransferase activities can utilize CTP as the phosphate donor (35.Westfall D. Aboushadi N. Shackelford J.E. Krisans S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 36.Szkopinska A. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1990; 37: 81-84PubMed Google Scholar), plant lipid phosphorylation activities using CTP as the preferential substrate have not yet been reported in the literature. In order to have a further confirmation that CTP is indeed the substrate, we have enzymatically synthesized CTPγS from ATPγS, CDP, and NDPK in vitro (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). To demonstrate the specificity of CTP for the lipid kinase(s) involved in the emergence of labeled lipids X and Y, we analyzed the inhibitory effect of CTPγS compared with ATPγS on the lipid phosphorylation in the presence of [γ-32P]CTP (Fig. 4). The results show that 10 μm CTPγS reduced the phosphorylation to 20% of the control activity and 0.1 mmCTPγS almost completely inhibited the labeling of X and Y. Interestingly, identical concentrations of ATPγS did not prevent the labeling but even had a stimulatory effect in both lipids. A quantitative analysis revealed that this induction resulted in an approximately 25% labeling increase of the total incorporation observed under control conditions. A small stimulatory effect was also observed in the presence of very low concentration of CTPγS, such as 1 and 0.1 μm CTPγS for X and Y, respectively. The effect of an addition of CTP following envelope labeling in the presence of [γ-32P]CTP is presented in Fig.5. After 5 min of incubation, the addition of 1 mm CTP to the phosphorylation medium induced a time-dependent chase in the labeling of X, while displaying a rapid [32P]incorporation pulse in Y. It should be noted that PA and LPA labeling were only weakly affected by the addition of CTP, thereby supporting the data presented in Figs.2 B and 3 B, showing that 32P incorporation in PA and LPA was ATP-dependent, but not CTP-dependent. An identical pulse-chase experiment, using [γ-32P]ATP as the phosphoryl donor and 1 mmATP as the chase nucleotide, did not show any similar inverse relationship in the labeling of X and Y (data not shown), confirming that labeling of X and Y is closely related to CTP. The identification of the phosphorylated lipids X and Y was performed using acid hydrolysis. The hydrolysis products (labeled heads) were separated either on silica (Fig. 6 A) or on cellulose (Fig. 6 B) plates. Under both different migration systems, X and Y hydrolysis products (Fig. 6, A (lanes 2 and 1) and B (lanes 2 and 4)) comigrated with galactose-6-P, but not with glucose-6-P (Fig. 6, A (right) andB (lanes 1 and 3)), galactose-1-P, and glucose-1-P (data not shown). The second smaller labeled spot on lane 3 of Fig. 6 Arevealed that some glucose molecules were present in the galactose preparation (Sigma). These data strongly suggest that labeled lipids X and Y are galactolipids phosphorylated at the C6-OH position. To confirm that galactolipids are indeed a site of lipid phosphorylation in chloroplast envelopes, some additional biochemical experiments were performed. Fig.7 A shows that labeling of X was strongly increased when MGDG was added to envelope membranes solubilized with 0.06% Triton X-100 (compare lanes − and +). This observation was not found in the absence of detergent (data not shown), indicating that solubilization of lipids is necessary for enzyme-substrate interactions. Minor new lipid products were also found to be phosphorylated (including Y) in the presence of MGDG (see Fig. 7 A, lane +). Another experiment shows that32P incorporation in X and Y was strongly reduced in the presence of increasing amounts of galatose (Fig. 7 B). This competitive inhibitory effect is likely to be very specific for X and Y compared with the constant phosphorylation profile of PA and LPA (Fig.7 B). Protease activities are known to affect the balance of galactolipids within the chloroplast envelope (16.Maréchal E. Block M.A. Dorne A.J. Douce R. Joyard J. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 65-77Crossref Google Scholar). Indeed, galactosyltransferase, generating DGDG and DAG from 2 molecules of MGDG, can be removed from outer envelope membranes by a thermolysin treatment, thereby increasing the ratio of MGDG versus DGDG in thermolysin-treated chloroplasts (37.Heemskerk J.W.M. Stortz T.H. Schmidt R.R. Heinz E. Plant Physiol. 1990; 93: 1286-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Fig. 7 C shows that isolated envelope membranes from intact chloroplasts treated with thermolysin (MGDG-enriched envelope membranes) and untreated membranes underwent a quantitatively different lipid phosphorylation pattern. Interestingly, the labeling of X and Y was largely stimulated in treated envelopes. Increased phosphorylation was not observed for PA and LPA, but their labeling"

The 12-bp sequence is located in the 5′ upstream region of the light down-regulated gene pra2, which encodes a small GTPase belonging to the YPT/rab family. Here we examined gain-of-function analyses using synthetic promoter-luciferase constructs in a transient assay and found that the 12-bp element alone was sufficient to confer dark induction, as well as light down-regulation on the minimal promoter. We named this dark inducible element DE1. Effects of various light conditions on the reporter gene activity showed that DE1 received signals from phytochrome A, phytochrome B, and blue light photoreceptors. Using phytochrome-deficient mutants, we showed that the pra2 protein level in seedlings was also regulated by these photoreceptors. The changes in the immunoblotting pattern of the pra2 protein in these mutants were correlated with the changes in epicotyl elongation. Results from transient assays using these mutants showed that the DE1 received signals from phytochromes A and B, demonstrating that this element is indeed a light-responsive element. To our knowledge, this is the first cis-element that by itself confers light responsiveness to a minimal promoter.

To our knowledge, this is the first cis-element that by itself confers light responsiveness to a minimal promoter. Plants use light not only as an energy source for photosynthesis but also as an environmental signal. Light signals received by photoreceptors control many aspects of plant development. There are several photoreceptors including the blue/UV-A receptor called phototropin, the blue/UV-A light receiving cryptochromes that control processes such as cotyledon expansion and hypocotyl inhibition (1.Chory J. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1225-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 2.Briggs W.R. Huala E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 33-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), and the red/far-red absorbing phytochromes that control processes such as seed germination, hypocotyl growth, leaf expansion, and floral induction (1.Chory J. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1225-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Many of these developmental changes are accompanied by changes in gene expression. The mechanism of light-regulated transcription has been widely investigated, but the accumulated evidence has shown that the mechanism is very complex. For example, whereas cis-elements for up-regulation have been reported, there is no report of a cis-element that is sufficient to confer light responsiveness by itself to a minimal promoter (3.Terzaghi W.B. Cashmore A.R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 445-474Crossref Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Compared with up-regulation, the mechanism for light down-regulation of transcription is even less clear. Some genes down-regulated by light have been identified such as AS1 (4.Ngai N. Tsai F.-Y. Coruzzi G. Plant J. 1997; 12: 1021-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), ATHB-2 (5.Carabelli M. Morelli G. Whitelam G. Ruberti I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6636-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thepra2 gene is mainly expressed in the growing zone of etiolated epicotyls, and its expression is repressed when the plant is illuminated (10.Inaba T. Nagano Y. Sakakibara T. Sasaki Y.

A. 1995; 92: 6314-6318Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Because small GTPases are molecular switches that are turned on by GTP and off by the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, and members of YPT/rab family play important roles during intracellular transport, we propose that pra2 protein may participate in vesicle transport during stem elongation of etiolated seedlings (13.Nagano Y. Okada Y. Narita H. Asaka Y. Sasaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6314-6318Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We were interested in the down-regulation of the pra2 gene, and we surveyed cis-elements located in the 5′ upstream region using a reporter gene in a transient assay (10.Inaba T. Nagano Y. Sakakibara T. Sasaki Y. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We found that a 12-bp 1bp, base pair; HIR, high irradiance response; LUC, luciferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; LED(s), light-emitting diodes; LFR, low fluence response; GUS, β-glucuronidase. 1bp, base pair; HIR, high irradiance response; LUC, luciferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; LED(s), light-emitting diodes; LFR, low fluence response; GUS, β-glucuronidase. sequence in the 5′ upstream region of this gene was important for the light down-regulation of the reporter gene and that this response was mediated by phytochrome B. However, we do not know whether the 12-bp element alone confers light down-regulation to a minimal promoter and whether the 12-bp element receives signals from photoreceptors other than phytochrome B. To answer these questions, we have examined the role of the 12-bp element by gain-of-function analysis in a transient assay to determine the effect of light conditions on the reporter gene. We found that the 12-bp element was sufficient to confer light down-regulation to a minimal promoter and capable of receiving signals from various photoreceptors. We named this dark inducibleelement DE1. Because the DE1 has a capacity to respond to various light signals, there is a possibility that expression of the pra2 gene is indeed regulated by various light signals. Previously we had only shown the involvement of phytochrome B (10.Inaba T. Nagano Y. Sakakibara T. Sasaki Y. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Here we used mutants to examine the involvement of other photoreceptors in the regulation ofpra2 expression. In Arabidopsis, 5 phytochrome genes (PHYA–PHYE) have been isolated, and it has been revealed that each phytochrome has distinct but at times overlapping functions (14.Smith H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 289-315Crossref Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Many photomorphogenic mutants have been isolated (15.Chory J. Development. 1992; 115: 337-354Crossref Google Scholar, 16.von Arnim A. Deng X.-W. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 215-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) and shown to be powerful tools for investigating light-regulated expression (17.Reed J.W. Nagatani A. Elich T.D. Fagan M. Chory J. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 1139-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 18.Chattopadhyay S. Puente P. Deng X.-W. Wei N. Plant J. 1998; 15: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In pea, several phytochrome mutants has been isolated. The pcd1 and pcd2mutations block steps leading to the formation of the phytochrome chromophore, phytochromobilin (19.Weller J.L. Terry M.J. Rameau C. Reid J.B. Kendrick R.E. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 20.Weller J.L. Terry M.J. Reid J.B. Kendrick R.E. Plant J. 1997; 11: 1177-1186Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar), whereas the fun1 andlv mutants are deficient in phytochrome A and phytochrome B apoproteins, respectively (21.Weller J.L. Nagatani A. Kendrick R.E. Murfet I.C. Reid J.B. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 22.Weller J.L. Murfet I.C. Reid J.B. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 1225-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We have used these mutants to investigate whether photoreceptors, in addition to phytochrome B, are involved in the expression of the pra2 protein and whether DE1 confers light down-regulation as expected. In this paper, we show that the DE1 is indeed a single light-responsive element and actually received signals from various photoreceptors. For the protein level measurements, pea seeds (Pisum sativum L.) were soaked in water and sown on irrigated rock wool. Seedlings were grown in the dark for 5 days at 25 °C. Before light treatment, the epicotyl between 0 and 1 cm from the apical hook was marked by pen under a dim green safe light. Plants were then irradiated with brief red (2 min) or far-red (5 min) light, returned to darkness, and kept for 12 h. In the experiments to examine the high irradiance response (HIR), plants were continuously irradiated with the appropriate light for 12 h. After irradiation, the stem length was measured. Proteins were extracted from the upper 1-cm portion of the epicotyl. For the transient expression assay, pea seeds were imbibed and sown individually in plastic pots. Seedlings were grown in the dark for 5 or 6 days at 25 °C. Seedlings were then placed horizontally in the bombardment device (Model GIE-III, Tanaka Co. Ltd.). The bombardment procedure was as described by Inaba et al. (10.Inaba T. Nagano Y. Sakakibara T. Sasaki Y. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The gold particles were coated with a mixture of two kinds of plasmids, a plasmid containing one of the synthetic promoter-luciferase (LUC) constructs and a plasmid containing a 35 S-GUS construct as the internal standard. All steps during bombardments were performed in a darkroom under a dim green safe light. After bombardment, the seedlings were illuminated by the appropriate light conditions. The 35S46-LUC vector was created by inserting the 35S46 promoter into the promoterless pBI221-LUC+ vector. The 35S46 promoter was created by PCR. The oligonucleotide, 5′-TGAGGATTTTACAGTAATTGAGGATTTTACAGTAATTGAGGATTTTACAGTAAT-3′ (WT1), containing three copies of the 18-bp sequence, 5′-TGAGGATTTTACAGTAAT-3′, was synthesized, phosphorylated, and ligated. The 18-bp oligonucleotide contained the 12-bp cis-regulatory element with neighboring 3 bp at both ends. Then, the complementary oligonucleotide, 5′-ATTACTGTAAAATCCTCAATTACTGTAAAATCCTCAATTACTGTAAAATCCTCA (WT2), was annealed and subcloned into the EcoRV site of the pZErO-2 plasmid (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). A plasmid containing nine tandem repeats of the 18-bp sequence was obtained. Its sequence was confirmed. To remove the sequence derived from the pZErO-2 vector, the nine tandem repeats were amplified by PCR using two primers that contained BamHI and EcoRV restriction sites. PCR products were purified by a QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN) and then digested by EcoRV andBamHI. The purified DNA fragment was subcloned intoBamHI-EcoRV-digested 35S46-LUC vector. To make the 3 single-base pair mutated construct, the two oligonucleotides used were as follows: 5′-TGAGGCTTTTCCCGTAATTGAGGCTTTTCCCGTAATTGAGGCTTTTCCCGTAAT-3′ (MT1) and 5′-ATTACGGGAAAAGCCTCAATTACGGGAAAAGCCTCAATTACGGGAAAAGCCTCA-3′ (MT2). The mutated construct was prepared by the same method. We used light-emitting diodes (LEDs) as the light sources for continuous irradiation. LEDs used in the experiments were as follows: Red, STICK-mR LED (λmax = 660 nm at 30 μmol m−2 s−1; TOKYO RIKA Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan); Far-red, STICK-mFR (λmax = 735 nm at 25 μmol m−2 s−1); Blue, STICK-mB LED (λmax = 470 nm at 25 μmol m−2s−1). Equipment for the red/far-red reversible experiments was the same as described previously (10.Inaba T. Nagano Y. Sakakibara T. Sasaki Y. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 12.Yoshida K. Nagano Y. Murai N. Sasaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6636-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The length of exposure to red was 2 min at 30.5 μmol m−2 sec−1, and far-red was 5 min at 36.5 μmol m−2sec−1. Total protein for immunoblotting was extracted by grinding tissue in a mortar and pestle on ice with sand together with 0.3 ml of buffer and 3 stem pieces (between 0 and 1 cm below the apical hook). The buffer contained 125 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 6% SDS, and 20% glycerol. The mixture was heated at 100 °C for 3 min and centrifuged. The supernatant protein was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane, probed with monoclonal IgG against pra2 protein (13.Nagano Y. Okada Y. Narita H. Asaka Y. Sasaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6314-6318Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to peroxidase (Bio-Rad), and developed with an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The stem of the bombarded pea seedling (between 0 and 1 cm below the apical hook) was ground in liquid nitrogen using a chilled mortar and pestle. The powder was dispensed into a microcentrifuge tube and mixed with 300 μl of the buffer, which consists of 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.8), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm EDTA and then centrifuged at 15,000 g at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was frozen at −80 °C until the enzyme assay was conducted. Luciferase assays were performed as described by Miller et al. (23.Miller A.J. Short S.R. Hiratsuka K. Chua N.-H. Kay S.A. Plant Mol. Biol. Reptr. 1992; 10: 324-337Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar) using the Pica Gene luciferase assay kit (Wako, Osaka, Japan). Photon emission derived from LUC activity was counted by AUTO LUMAT LB953 (Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). GUS assays were conducted using the method of Jeffersonet al. (24.Jefferson R.A. Kavanaugh T.A. Bevan M.W. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3901-3907Crossref PubMed Scopus (8260) Google Scholar), with some modification (25.Kosugi S. Ohashi Y. Nakajima K. Arai Y. Plant Sci. 1990; 70: 133-140Crossref Scopus (356) Google Scholar). 4-Methylumbelliferone solutions dissolved in 0.2 mNa2CO3 were used as standards. All LUC values were normalized to the corresponding GUS values. Samples of at least 6 bombardments were independently assayed for each construct. Previously, we identified acis-element, a 12-bp sequence, GGATTTTACAGT, involved in phytochrome down-regulated expression of the pra2 gene of pea (10.Inaba T. Nagano Y. Sakakibara T. Sasaki Y. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Gain-of-function analysis showed that the 93-bp sequence containing the 12-bp element could confer light down-regulation when fused to a heterologous, CaMV 35S90 promoter (cauliflowermosaic virus 35Spromoter of 90 bp from the transcriptional start site). The CaMV 35S90 promoter has the as-1 element, which interacts with the fused element and complicates interpretation of the results (3.Terzaghi W.B. Cashmore A.R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 445-474Crossref Scopus (460) Google Scholar). It is necessary to confirm the role of the 12-bp element in light responsiveness using a minimal promoter, CaMV 35S46, that has 46 bp from the transcriptional start site and is a smaller version of CaMV 35S90. We constructed the reporter plasmid, pGF9, containing a nine-tandem repeat of the cis-element, CaMV 35S46, and the luciferase gene (Fig. 1). Using the plasmid pGF9 in a transient assay, we tested whether the 12-bp element was sufficient to confer light down-regulation of the minimal promoter in a red/far-red reversible manner. After bombardment, we placed the plants under a range of light conditions, before incubating them for 12 h in darkness, prior to measurement of their luciferase activity (Fig. 2 A, pGF9). The expression of the reporter gene was highest in darkness (lane D). The brief red light treatment repressed the expression (lane R), and subsequent far-red light immediately after red light treatment reversed the effect (lane R/F). The 3 single-base pair mutated construct, pGF9M, in which the adenines in the 12-bp element were changed to cytosines, decreased to 20% of the level observed in the case of pGF9 in darkness and abolished the red/far-red reversible response. These results indicate that the 12-bp element is dark-inducible and sufficient to confer red/far-red reversible light down-regulation to the minimal promoter. When the nine tandem copies of the cis-element were fused to CaMV 35S46 promoter in the reverse direction, we could also observe red/far-red reversible response, indicating that the function of this element is independent of its direction (data not shown). We named this dark inducible element DE1.Figure 2Effect of light on reporter enzyme activity in wild type plants. Synthetic promoter-luciferase constructs (pGF9 or pGF9M) were introduced into the growing region of etiolated pea epicotyl by particle bombardment with the 35 S-GUS construct as the internal standard.

Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 289-315Crossref Scopus (433) Google Scholar). There is a possibility that DE1 also responds to light signals received by photoreceptors other than phytochrome B. To examine this possibility, we determined the effects of various continuous light irradiations on the expression of the reporter gene as shown in Fig. 2 B. A response to continuous irradiation is termed an HIR, and red-HIR and far-red-HIR are thought to be mediated by phytochrome B and phytochrome A, respectively (14.Smith H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 289-315Crossref Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Responses to blue light may be mediated by phytochrome A and blue light photoreceptors (1.Chory J. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 1225-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We exposed plants to continuous red (lane Rc), far-red (lane Fc), or blue light (lane Bc) irradiation for 12 h and measured the reporter gene activity (Fig. 2 B). Each treatment repressed the expression of the reporter gene (pGF9), compared with that of darkness (lane D), and the 3 single-base pair mutations abolished dark induction, as well as the HIR (pGF9M). These results suggest that the DE1 receives signals not only from phytochrome B, but also from phytochrome A and blue-light photoreceptors. It seems probable that the various photoreceptors transduce the light signal via the DE1. To examine whether the expression of the pra2 gene is indeed regulated by various photoreceptors, we investigated pra2expression using photoreceptor mutants. In pea there are several mutants deficient in various phytochromes. We used thefun1–1 and lv-5 mutants and thepcd1pcd2 double mutant. The pcd1pcd2 double mutant is blocked at two steps in chromophore biosynthesis (19.Weller J.L. Terry M.J. Rameau C. Reid J.B. Kendrick R.E. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 20.Weller J.L. Terry M.J. Reid J.B. Kendrick R.E. Plant J. 1997; 11: 1177-1186Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The fun1–1 and lv-5 mutants are deficient in phytochromes A and B, respectively (21.Weller J.L. Nagatani A. Kendrick R.E. Murfet I.C. Reid J.B. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 22.Weller J.L. Murfet I.C. Reid J.B. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 1225-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We exposed these mutants to various light conditions and examined the pra2 protein level by immunoblotting (Fig. 3). When grown in complete darkness, all plants expressed the pra2 protein (lane D). Red/far-red light reversible down-regulation was observed in wild type and fun1–1 plants, but not in the lv-5and pcd1pcd2 plants (Fig. 3, upper row). These results indicate that this LFR is not mediated by phytochrome A but is mediated by phytochrome B. The results from pcd1pcd2 plants show that chromophore biosynthesis is required for functional phytochrome B activity. This result is in agreement with expectations from our previous results (12.Yoshida K. Nagano Y. Murai N. Sasaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6636-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 13.Nagano Y. Okada Y. Narita H. Asaka Y. Sasaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6314-6318Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To examine whether photoreceptors other than phytochrome B are involved in pra2 expression, the effects of continuous irradiation were also examined in these mutants (Fig. 3, lower row). The effect of continuous red irradiation on pcd1pcd2 plants was different from that of wild type (lane Rc), indicating that phytochromes mediate this red-HIR as expected. Red-HIR is usually mediated by phytochrome B but not by phytochrome A (14.Smith H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 289-315Crossref Scopus (433) Google Scholar), and the result from the phytochrome A-deficient fun1–1 plants was in agreement with this suggestion. However, there was some down-regulation in the phytochrome B-deficient lv-5 mutant, suggesting some other phytochrome(s) may also play a role in the red-HIR. The effect of continuous far-red on mutant lv5 was similar to that on wild type. The expression by fun 1–1 or pcd1pcd2plants was reduced in comparison to wild type plants implicating phytochrome A in the far-red-HIR. The effect of continuous blue light on all three mutants was similar to that of wild type (lane Bc), indicating that phytochromes are not involved in this response. Presumably blue light photoreceptors are involved in this response. Thus, the mutant studies indicate that light received by phytochrome A, phytochrome B, and blue-light receptors affected the expression of the pra2 protein. Previously we observed that the pra2 protein level was correlated with stem elongation in etiolated pea seedlings (13.Nagano Y. Okada Y. Narita H. Asaka Y. Sasaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6314-6318Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To test this observation for the mutants, we measured the epicotyl elongation (Fig.4) and compared it with the pra2 protein level represented in Fig. 3 (lower row). Changes in stem elongation were correlated with the pra2 expression pattern, consistent with the proposition that the pra2 protein may be involved in stem elongation. It is important to demonstrate that the DE1 is capable of receiving signals from photoreceptors using the above-characterized mutants. We examined the effect of light on the reporter gene expression by the transient assay using the plasmid pGF9. If the DE1 actually receives signals from a photoreceptor, deficiency of the photoreceptor should reduce the specific response mediated by it. In Fig. 3, we showed that a phytochrome A-deficient mutant,fun1–1, is deficient in the far-red-HIR, and a phytochrome B-deficient mutant, lv-5, is deficient in the LFR forpra2 expression. Here, we tested the effect of continuous far-red light or brief red light on the reporter gene expression offun1–1 and lv-5 plants. We used the activities in darkness as the induction control and activities in continuous blue light as the repression control, because both activities in the two mutants were similar to those of wild type plants (Fig. 3). In both mutants, the activities of the reporter gene were highest in darkness and repressed by blue light (Fig. 5,lanes D and Bc). In the phytochrome A-deficient mutant fun1–1, response to continuous far-red light (lane Fc) was somewhat attenuated, whereas a significant response to brief red light (lane R) was retained. In the phytochrome B-deficient mutant lv-5, the response to brief red light (lane R) was attenuated, whereas response to continuous far-red light (lane Fc) was retained. Thus, the deficiency of each photoreceptor diminished the specific response mediated by it. These results are consistent with the results in Figs.2 and 3 and indicate that the DE1 element actually receives signals from phytochromes A and B. In this report, we have shown that a 12-bp element, DE1, could confer light responsiveness to a minimal promoter, CaMV 35S46, using a reporter gene in a transient assay and that the element received the signal from phytochrome A, phytochrome B, and blue light receptors (Fig. 2). These findings were confirmed by the use of phytochrome-deficient mutants, because the DE1 lost the ability to confer light responsiveness only for the specific light conditions relevant to that photoreceptor (Fig. 5). It seems probable that various photoreceptors transduce the light signals to the DE1. To date there are some reports for gain-of-function analysis of variouscis-elements. Most experiments have been done using the CaMV 35S90 promoter that has the as-1 element. The GT-1 tetramer can confer light responsiveness to the CaMV 35S90 promoter, but not to the CaMV 35S46 promoter, probably because the as-1 element is needed to build a light-responsive module with the GT-1-binding site (3.Terzaghi W.B. Cashmore A.R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 445-474Crossref Scopus (460) Google Scholar). In case of light down-regulation, the RE3 could confer light responsiveness to the modified CaMV 35S46 promoter, probably interacting with the B domain of the 35 S promoter (9.Neuhaus G. Bowler C. Hiratsuka K. Yamagata H. Chua N.-H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2554-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, combinatorial interaction of light-responsive elements determines the response characteristics of light-regulated promoters (18.Chattopadhyay S. Puente P. Deng X.-W. Wei N. Plant J. 1998; 15: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 26.Puente P. Wei N. Deng X.-W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3732-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The smallest sequence unit sufficient to confer light responsiveness to the CaMV 35S46 promoter has been a 52-bp element of the CHS unit I (3.Terzaghi W.B. Cashmore A.R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 445-474Crossref Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 27.Weisshaar B. Armstrong G.A. Block A. da Costa e Silva O. Hahlbrock K. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1777-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). This 52-bp element is long compared with the DE1. To our knowledge, DE1 is the first small cis-element reported that, by itself, confers light responsiveness to a minimal promoter, 35S46. We propose that the cis-elements for light down-regulation should be divided into two groups. One is the repressor-binding site under light, and the other is the activator-binding site in darkness. Previously, we proposed that the 12-bp element regulates induction in darkness rather than repression by light (10.Inaba T. Nagano Y. Sakakibara T. Sasaki Y. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The present data show that introduction of the pGF9 construct resulted in dark induction of the reporter gene and that the 3 single-base pair mutations abolished dark induction rather than light-repressed expression (Fig. 2), supporting the hypothesis that the DE1 is an activator-binding site in darkness. Previous gel mobility shift assays also suggested the possibility that DE1 is an activator-binding site in darkness (10.Inaba T. Nagano Y. Sakakibara T. Sasaki Y. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Moreover, pra2 expression itself shows a dark-inducible pattern. When etiolated plants were illuminated for one day and then returned to darkness, pra2 expression was restored (13.Nagano Y. Okada Y. Narita H. Asaka Y. Sasaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6314-6318Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, these data support the view that DE1 is an activator-binding site in darkness. The RE1 element on the PHYA promoter and the RE3 element on the AS1 promoter have been identified ascis-elements involved in phytochrome downregulation, but these two elements are thought to be binding sites for transcriptional repressors (8.Bruce W.B. Deng X.-W. Quail P.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3015-3024Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 9.Neuhaus G. Bowler C. Hiratsuka K. Yamagata H. Chua N.-H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2554-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). By contrast, DE1 may be responsible for dark induction rather than light down-regulation. The pra2 protein level was regulated by phytochrome A, phytochrome B, and blue-light photoreceptors (Fig. 3). DE1 received signals from these photoreceptors, suggesting that DE1 is likely to regulate pra2 expression mediated by various photoreceptors. In lv-5plants, the pra2 protein level did show a red-HIR, whereas the expression did not show an LFR. In general, both red-HIR and LFR are mediated by phytochrome B. However, our data suggest that the red-HIR of the pra2 gene is not mediated solely by phytochrome B. Because the various phytochromes have overlapping functions, it is not surprising that the red-HIR was regulated by other phytochromes. For example, the Arabidopsis phyB mutant retained an LFR forCAB gene expression, which is generally mediated by phytochrome B (17.Reed J.W. Nagatani A. Elich T.D. Fagan M. Chory J. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 1139-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). In lv-5 plants, other phytochromes are likely to regulate the red-HIR for pra2 expression, as well as phytochrome B. The observed correlation between pra2 gene expression and epicotyl elongation observed in the mutants is consistent with our previous hypothesis that the pra2 protein may be involved with epicotyl elongation in etiolated pea seedlings. One possibility is that the pra2 protein is induced in darkness and leads to stem elongation. Upon illumination, various photoreceptors send a signal to the DE1 and repress pra2 expression, which then results in reduced elongation. This hypothesis requires detailed testing, and the interaction of pra2 expression with the hormones involved with elongation deserves examination. In conclusion we have shown that a 12-bp cis-regulatory element, DE1, confers dark induction to a minimal promoter. Introduction of the DE1 into other species should reveal whether this element is functionally conserved between species We thank Drs. Winslow R.

https://openalex.org/W2046161984,"The physiological role of TFIIA was investigated by analyzing transcription in a yeast strain that contains a TATA-binding protein (TBP) mutant (N2–1) defective for interacting with TFIIA. In cells containing N2–1, transcription from a set of artificial his3 promoters dependent on different activators is generally reduced by a similar extent, indicating that TFIIA function is largely nonselective for activators. In addition, TATA element utilization, a core promoter function, is altered athis3 promoters dependent on weak activators. Genomic expression analysis reveals that 3% of the genes are preferentially affected by a factor of 4 or more. Chimeras of affected promoters indicate that the sensitivity to the TFIIA-TBP interaction can map either to the upstream or core promoter region. Unlike wild-type TBP or TFIIA, the N2–1 derivative does not activate transcription when artificially recruited to the promoter via a heterologous DNA binding domain, indicating that TFIIA is important for transcription even in the absence of an activation domain. Taken together, these results suggest that TFIIA plays an important role in both activator-dependent and core promoter functions in vivo. Further, they suggest that TFIIA function may not be strictly related to the recruitment of TBP to promoters but may also involve a step after TBP recruitment. The physiological role of TFIIA was investigated by analyzing transcription in a yeast strain that contains a TATA-binding protein (TBP) mutant (N2–1) defective for interacting with TFIIA. In cells containing N2–1, transcription from a set of artificial his3 promoters dependent on different activators is generally reduced by a similar extent, indicating that TFIIA function is largely nonselective for activators. In addition, TATA element utilization, a core promoter function, is altered athis3 promoters dependent on weak activators. Genomic expression analysis reveals that 3% of the genes are preferentially affected by a factor of 4 or more. Chimeras of affected promoters indicate that the sensitivity to the TFIIA-TBP interaction can map either to the upstream or core promoter region. Unlike wild-type TBP or TFIIA, the N2–1 derivative does not activate transcription when artificially recruited to the promoter via a heterologous DNA binding domain, indicating that TFIIA is important for transcription even in the absence of an activation domain. Taken together, these results suggest that TFIIA plays an important role in both activator-dependent and core promoter functions in vivo. Further, they suggest that TFIIA function may not be strictly related to the recruitment of TBP to promoters but may also involve a step after TBP recruitment. polymerase TATA-binding protein green fluorescent protein Initiation of RNA polymerase (pol)1 II transcription requires the assembly of a large complex of proteins that must interact at the promoter in a productive manner (1.Roeder R.G.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Formation of this complex is accelerated by activators that bind to the promoter and aid in recruitment of the components in the complex. The first step in promoter recognition is binding of TFIID to the TATA element. TFIID is a multiprotein complex containing TATA-binding protein (TBP) and TBP-associated factors (3.Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 769-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). TFIIA stabilizes the TBP-TATA interaction (4.Buratowski S. Hahn S. Guarente L. Sharp P.A.

TFIIA also counteracts several negative regulators of transcription that specifically target TBP. It inhibits the abilities of Mot1 and NC2 to dissociate TBP from the TATA element (10.Auble D.T.

Swanson M.J. Nishikawa J.I. Hinnebusch A.G. Nakatani Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus, there are several mechanisms by which TFIIA functions at core promoters in vitro. Although TFIIA is not required for in vitro transcription using highly purified components, activated transcription is often stimulated by TFIIA. This is in accord with the observations that TFIIA can interact directly with activation domains in vitro(15.Ozer J. Moore P.A. Bolden A.H. Lee A. Rosen C.A. Lieberman P.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2324-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 16.Kobayashi N. Boyer T.G. Berk A.J. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1996; 16: 4656-4664Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and that TFIIA is required for activator-dependent stabilization of the TFIID·TATA complex (16.Kobayashi N. Boyer T.G. Berk A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6465-6473Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 18.Lieberman P.M. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 995-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 19.Damania B.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). A simple model is that the activator-dependent TFIID·TFIIA complex is formed rapidly and stably on the TATA element, thereby serving as an efficient scaffold for the remainder of the initiation complex. Alternatively, TFIIA could act as a coactivator, conveying information between the activator and TBP. In this regard, in vitrocross-linking of an activator to TBP bound at a promoter is inhibited by TFIIA (21.Emili A. Ingles C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13674-13680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggesting that TFIIA is positioned between the activator and TBP. However, other biochemical experiments suggest that simple recruitment of the TFIID·TFIIA complex is not sufficient for activated transcription (22.Shykind B.M. Kim J. Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1354-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 23.Chi T. Carey M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2540-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). TFIIA may alter the conformation of TFIID such that either TFIID or the TFIIA·TFIID complex is a target for the remainder of the initiation machinery. It should be noted that the functional interaction between an activator and TFIIA need not be direct, and biochemical studies have identified coactivator proteins that interact with the activator and TFIIA (24.Ge H. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1994; 78: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of these observations and implied mechanisms remains to be established. Several studies have addressed the role of TFIIA in vivo, but the results do not establish whether the functions of TFIIAin vivo are related to the activator, the core promoter, or both. Previously, we showed that a yeast TBP mutant (termed N2–1) defective for interacting with TFIIA impairs the response to acidic activators but does not generally affect pol II transcription (25.Stargell L.A. Struhl K. Science. 1995; 269: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, human TBP mutants severely defective for interacting with TFIIA are generally incompetent for transcription in transiently transfected mammalian cells (26.Bryant G.O. Martel L.S. Burley S.K. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2491-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). On the other hand, mutants of the Toa2 subunit of yeast TFIIA that weaken TFIIA-TBP·TATA complex formation confer selective transcriptional effects (27.Ozer J. Lezina L.E. Ewing J. Audi S. Lieberman P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2559-2570Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Interpretation of these results is complicated because the various mutations might differentially affect the quality of the TFIIA-TBP interaction and because potential functions of TFIIA that are unrelated to interactions with TBP are not addressed. In complementary experiments, reduction of intracellular TFIIA levels caused a broad, but quantitatively modest, effect on transcription (7.Kang J.J. Auble D.T. Ranish J.A. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1234-1243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but these results were limited by the partial nature of the TFIIA depletion and the lack of experiments involving activator-dependent transcription. In this report, we extend our analysis of the N2–1 derivative of TBP by systematically examining its ability to respond to a large number of activators, by determining the regions of promoters that are responsible for altered transcription in the N2–1 strain, and by performing artificial recruitment experiments. Our results indicate that TFIIA plays an important role in both activator-dependent and core promoter functions in vivo, and they suggest that TFIIA functions, at least in part, in a step after TBP is recruited to the promoter. To analyze transcriptional stimulation by different yeast activators, we started with a set of 13 strains described previously (28.Iyer V. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7059-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) that contain derivatives of the his3 promoter in which the natural enhancer region located upstream of the noncanonical (TC) and canonical (TR)his3 TATA elements is replaced with a specific activator binding site. After transformation of these 13 strains with aURA3 centromeric plasmid expressing wild-type TBP, the chromosomal TBP locus was replaced by a derivative in which the TBP protein coding sequence was replaced by the LEU2 gene. Finally, derivatives of these strains expressing wild-type TBP or the N2–1 derivative as the sole source of TBP (on TRP1centromeric plasmids) were generated by plasmid shuffling. To analyze the ability of TBP and the N2–1 derivative to mediate the response to the various activators, cells were grown under appropriate conditions for the various activators, exactly as described previously (28.Iyer V. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7059-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Levels of his3 transcription were determined by quantitative S1 analyses using hybridization reactions containing 20–40 μg of RNA and his3 and ded1 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probes as described previously (29.Iyer V. Struhl K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5208-5212Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Yeast strains MMY101 and MMY102 (generated and kindly provided by Mario Mencia) were derived from ZMY117 (30.Moqtaderi Z. Keaveney M. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 675-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) by LEU2 disruption of the genomic copy of TBP in the presence of wild-type TBP on a URA3centromeric plasmid. TRP1 centromeric plasmids expressing wild-type TBP (for MMY101) or N2–1 (for MMY102) were introduced into this background by plasmid shuffling. Cells of each strain were cultured in synthetic medium at 30 °C to anA 600 of 1, collected by centrifugation, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total cellular RNA was isolated by hot acid phenol extraction (29.Iyer V. Struhl K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5208-5212Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and poly(A)-containing RNA was purified using Qiagen oligotex resin. Oligo(dT)-primed double-stranded cDNA was derived from this poly(A)-containing RNA, and 1 μg of the product was transcribed in vitro to generate internally biotin-labeled complementary RNA (31.Wodicka L. Dong H. Mittman M. Ho M.H. Lockhart D.J. Nature Biotech. 1997; 15: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). The biotin-labeled RNA probes were fragmented, hybridized to half a set of Affymetrix yeast gene chip arrays (chips C and D, representing ∼3200 open reading frames from chromosomes IX to XVI), fluorescently labeled, and analyzed on a Molecular Dynamics confocal scanner (31.Wodicka L. Dong H. Mittman M. Ho M.H. Lockhart D.J. Nature Biotech. 1997; 15: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). The results for the two strains were analyzed and compared using Affymetrix GeneChip software. For the comparison of expression results from the two strains, the data were normalized by two different methods: in the first, the overall hybridization intensity of the N2–1 sample was set equal to that of the wild-type sample for a given chip; and in the second, the data were normalized to set the hybridization intensities of both samples to the actin open reading frame (present on both C and D chips) at parity. The two methods of normalization yielded similar results, although there were minor variations in the fold change, and thus the rank order, of the open reading frames exhibiting changed expression. The genome microarray results for several representative RNAs were confirmed by quantitative S1 nuclease protection assays. Based on the results of genome-wide analysis of transcription in the N2–1 strain, four genes were selected for analysis of their promoter sequences:CTR1 and PUT1, which are down-regulated in the N2–1 background, and ERG3 and CYC1, which are up-regulated in the N2–1 strain. All promoter fragments were produced by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotide primers that contain a restriction site at the 5′-end of the primer (an artificialBamHI site, which adds 6 base pairs to each promoter between the upstream and core promoter regions). Upstream promoter fragments are 750 base pairs in length, and the core promoter regions span from the distal end of the TATA box to the +7 site relative to the A of the start codon. The hybrid promoter constructs were cloned in frame with the gene encoding a modified version of green fluorescent protein (GFP, a gift from Pam Silver). The resulting chimeras were linearized withEcoRV and integrated at the ura3-52 locus of the TBP or N2–1 strains used for the genome microarray analysis. Quantitative S1 nuclease protection assays were performed as described (29.Iyer V. Struhl K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5208-5212Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) on RNA harvested from each strain. The sequence of the 55 base GFP probe is CCGTATGTTGCATCACCTTCACCCTCTCCACTGACAGAAAATTTGTGCCCTAATT, and S1 nuclease digestion of the hybrid between yeast RNA and this probe yields a product of 50 bases. LexA fusion constructs were tested in strain FT4, which contains a LexA operator 45 base pairs upstream of the his3 TATA element and structural gene (32.Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Nature. 1994; 369: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). To generate molecules expressing LexA-TBP derivatives, the region encoding Cyc8 of YCp91-LexA-CYC8 (32.Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Nature. 1994; 369: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) was replaced with the structural gene of wild-type TBP and the N2–1 derivative. The resulting molecule contains a 1.5-kilobase fragment of theADH promoter driving expression of a hybrid protein consisting of the 202 amino acid coding sequence for LexA, the HA1 epitope, the SV40 nuclear localization signal, and the TBP derivative. YCp22 (the TRP1 vector) and molecules expressing LexA and the LexA-TBP derivatives were transformed into strain FT4, andhis3 expression was monitored by spotting 104cells on plates lacking histidine, containing either 0 or 20 mm aminotriazole, a competitive inhibitor ofhis3. LexA-TBP fusions were detected by immunoblot analyses of 100 μg of whole cell extracts using a polyclonal antibody to LexA and chemiluminescent detection. Gal4 fusion constructs were tested in the strain MAV103, which contains the Gal4 UAS fused to the his3 TATA element and structural gene (33.Vidal M. Brachmann R.K. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Boeke J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10315-10320Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the open reading frames of Toa1 and TBP, and these were cloned into pPC97, which contains the Gal4 DNA binding domain (residues 1–147) on a CEN,TRP1-marked plasmid (33.Vidal M. Brachmann R.K. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Boeke J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10315-10320Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Molecules expressing these Gal4 derivatives were transformed into strain MAV103, and his3expression was monitored by spotting 104 cells on plates lacking histidine, containing either 0 or 20 mmaminotriazole. In yeast and other eukaryotic cells, core promoters containing TATA and initiator elements are essentially inactive, indicating that transcription of essentially all genes requires activator proteins (34.Struhl K. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 1051-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 35.Struhl K. Cell. 1999; 98: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that the N2–1 derivative of TBP was defective for transcription of genes responding to three different acidic activators, Gal4, Gcn4, and Ace1, and was defective in vitro for interaction with TFIIA (25.Stargell L.A. Struhl K. Science. 1995; 269: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The growth and transcriptional phenotypes conferred by N2–1, but not by other TBP mutants, were suppressed by fusion to the Toa2 subunit of TFIIA, demonstrating that the defective TFIIA-TBP interaction is responsible for the phenotypes in vivo (25.Stargell L.A. Struhl K. Science. 1995; 269: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 36.Stargell L.A. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4456-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Although it is impossible to exclude the possibility that the N2–1 derivative might have other defects aside from its inability to interact with TFIIA, such additional defects do not account for the growth and transcriptional phenotypes. Interestingly, transcription of a number of other genes appeared unaffected in the N2–1 strain. This suggests that activators responsible for transcription of the unaffected genes should function normally in the N2–1 strain. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the role of the TFIIA-TBP interaction in 13 strains, each of which possesses a binding site for a different activator located upstream of the his3 TATA and initiator elements (28.Iyer V. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7059-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These sites include those recognized by acidic activators or by activators with unclassified activation domains, as well as a poly(dA·dT) element that stimulates transcription via its inherent effect on chromatin structure (37.Iyer V. Struhl K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2570-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, in almost all cases, his3 transcription is lower in the N2–1 strain than in the corresponding strain expressing wild-type TBP (Fig.1). In the exceptional case of the activator Ppr1, transcriptional output is unaffected or slightly enhanced in the N2–1 strain. Thus, most of the activators tested are unable to support maximal levels of his3 transcription in the N2–1 strain. Interestingly, the transcriptional defect is quantitatively similar (2–3-fold) in essentially all cases examined, indicating that the TFIIA-TBP interaction is largely nonselective for activator function. The his3 promoter contains a noncanonical TATA-like element (TC) that is responsible for initiation at the +1 position and a consensus TATA element (TR) that is responsible for initiation at +13 (28.Iyer V. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7059-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 38.Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3847-3853Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 39.Chen W.

Biol. 1990; 10: 4447-4455Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In accord with previous results (28.Iyer V. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7059-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), strains containing wild-type TBP show a clear pattern of his3 TATA utilization depending on the quality of activator (Fig. 1 and TableI). Specifically, as defined by the ratio of +13 to +1 transcripts, weak activators stimulate transcription predominantly through TC , moderate activators stimulate transcription equally from TC andTR , and strong activators preferentially stimulate transcription through TR . This pattern was interpreted in terms of functional saturation ofTC (and other weak TATA elements) at low to moderate levels of transcriptional stimulation (28.Iyer V. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7059-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).Table IDifferential usage of the two qualitatively distinct TATA elementsActivatorRatio of +13/+1 TranscriptionaThe ratio of +13 transcription to +1 transcription, which reflects utilization of T R orT C, respectively.

Open table in a new tab As the wild-type pattern of his3 TATA utilization is governed specifically by the core promoter region and not the activator (28.Iyer V. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7059-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), factors that alter this pattern do so by affecting core promoter function (30.Moqtaderi Z. Keaveney M. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 675-682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 41.Collart M.A. Struhl K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 42.Collart M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6668-6676Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 43.Moqtaderi Z. Bai Y. Poon D. Weil P.A. Struhl K. Nature. 1996; 382: 188-191Crossref Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In this regard, the corresponding strains containing the N2–1 derivative display a different pattern ofhis3 TATA element utilization (Table I). In promoters dependent on weak activators, a larger percentage of the total transcription is driven from TR , producing a +13 to +1 ratio of nearly 1 or greater. A similarly increased preference for TR and +13 initiation is also observed for moderate activators, including Ppr1. Importantly, increased utilization of TR in strains containing N2–1 is observed even though the overall level of transcription is lower; this contrasts with the situation in wild-type cells where increasedTR utilization is associated with an overall increase in his3 transcription levels (28.Iyer V. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7059-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that TC is saturating at a lower level of transcription in the N2–1 strain as compared with wild type strain and that noncanonical TATA elements depend on the TFIIA-TBP interaction to achieve maximal levels of transcription. Differential preference of his3 TATA elements is not observed for potent activators (Gcn4, Ace1, and Gal4), suggesting that a strong activator can bypass at least part of the defect associated with a defective TFIIA-TBP interaction. The observation that the N2–1 derivative alters the wild-type rules of his3 TATA element utilization provides evidence that TFIIA performs a function at core promoters. The modest defect in Gal4-dependent activation (Fig. 1) appears to conflict with our previous observation (25.Stargell L.A. Struhl K. Science. 1995; 269: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) that the N2–1 derivative was completely unable to mediate activation by Gal4. This apparent discrepancy was resolved by analyzing the kinetics of Gal4-dependent activation of GAL1 transcription. The TBP-containing strain achieves maximal levels of activation by 30–60 min, with an increase in GAL1 RNA observed after only 10 min in galactose (Fig.2 A; data not shown). In contrast, the N2–1 strain requires 6 h for detectable induction and 12 h to reach maximum output. Although there is a substantial growth difference between the TBP and N2–1 strains (doubling times 85 min and 6 h, respectively), the slow induction of GAL1transcription is not explained simply by the altered growth rates. For example, at a time corresponding to half a generation (45 min and 3 h, respectively), GAL1 transcription is maximal in the strain containing wild-type TBP, whereas it is not detectable in the N2–1 strain. In the previously published experiment, which involved a different strain background, the doubling time for the N2–1 strain was 10 h, galactose induction was performed for 18 h, and GAL1 transcription was not detected. However, when the original strain is cultured for longer times, a slight Gal4-dependent response is observed at 24 h, and a response corresponding to 20–30% of the wild-type level is observed at 72 h (Fig. 2 B). Thus, in both the original and current strain backgrounds, the N2–1 derivative delays the induction of Gal4-dependent activation but only causes a mild (3–5 fold) defect in the maximal level of GAL1 transcription. To examine the global implications of an impaired TFIIA-TBP interaction, we compared the pattern of gene expression of N2–1 and wild-type cells using microarray technology (44.Lockhart D.J. Dong H. Byrne M.C. Follettie M.T. Gallo M.V. Chee M.S. Mittmann M. Wang C. Kobayashi M. Horton H. Brown E.L. Nature Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1675-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (2796) Google Scholar). Analysis of ∼3200 genes reveals that 42 (1.3%) are expressed at least 4-fold higher in the N2–1 strain than in the wild-type strain and that 47 (1.5%) are expressed at levels at least 4-fold lower in the N2–1 strain (Table II). If changes of at least 2-fold are considered, 9% of genes are expressed at higher levels in the N2–1 strain, and 8% are expressed at lower levels in the N2–1 strain relative to the strain containing wild-type TBP. This percentage of genes preferentially affected by at least 2-fold in the N2–1 strain is comparable to or higher than that caused by mutations in GCN5 (5% affected), SRB5 (16% affected), andSWI2 (6% affected) (45.Holstege F.C.

With the exception of increased expression of several ribosomal protein genes in the N2–1 strain, we detected no obvious patterns in the genes with changed expression levels. The wide range and apparent unrelated nature of genes preferentially affected by the N2–1 mutation are consistent with the relative lack of activator specificity observed with the modifiedhis3 promoters.Table IIGenes that exhibit altered levels of expression in the N2–1 strainFold differenceLower in N2–1Higher in N2–1>10YNL157wYNL144cYNL195cTIS11YPR008wPUT16–7YMR316c-bRPL6B ex 1MSK1YMR318cYPL136wYNL057wYNR075wYPL142cYJL118w5YPT53YKL086wCTR1YLR435wYOR071cYLR376cYMR320wRPS33BYLR126cYPR064wYLR349wYPL205cYMR040wYPL148cBEM4YPL238cYPL278cYPL049cYPL200wYPR003c4YLR267wYMR269wYJR149wCIN5YAP3YMR303cYNL173cYPR044cCYC2YNR042wYOR019wYOR246cYKL165cRP23 cx 1YOR137cYMR294wYOR387cZDS1MLS1YLR265cYNL194cYLL012wMPD1DYN1YOR343cYLR068wYNL054wSPR40YOL031cYKR077wARE2YJL222wYMR313cCTK1YOR264wYKR024cYNL148cRPA12YPL222wERG3YMR085wYKL082cYLR231cCYC1YML132wYML023cYOR070cYJL148WYOR220wERG5YLR073CLTV1YMR095CYLR455w Open table in a new tab An important consideration in interpreting these genome-wide expression results is that equal amounts of wild-type and N2–1 mRNA samples were analyzed.

The protein, inactivated at a high temperature in a TDnaKJ-GrpE set, recovered its activity during subsequent incubation withTClpB at moderate temperature (Motohashi, K., Watanabe, Y., Yohda, M., and Yoshida, M. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 96, 7184–7189). Here, we report that the addition of chaperonin (Tcpn) at moderate temperature improves the yield of the TDnaKJ-GrpE-ClpB-dependent reactivation. The trap-Tcpn, which binds substrate protein but does not release it, inhibits reactivation severely. Maximum recovery is gained at sub-stoichiometric amounts of each component ofTDnaKJ, TGrpE, and TClpB relative to the substrate monomer. These observations indicate that, driven by ATP hydrolysis, TDnaKJ-GrpE-ClpB chaperones catalytically cooperate and release heat-inactivated protein as a non-native, chaperonin-recognizable folding intermediate.

Formation of Hb F in vitro following incubation of equimolar mixtures of γ and α chains was about 4 × 105-fold slower than assembly of α and β chains to form Hb A in vitro. Results of assembly for γ116Ile→His and γ112Thr→Asp chains with α chains were similar to that of β chains, whereas assembly of γ112Thr→Cys and α chains was similar to wild type γ chains, indicating that amino acid differences at α1β1 and α1γ1 interaction sites between γ116 Ile and β116 His are responsible for the different assembly rates in vitro in the formation of Hb F and Hb A. Homoassembly in vitro of individual γ chains as assessed by size-exclusion chromatography shows that γ and γ112Thr→Cys chains form stable dimers like αβ and αγ that do not dissociate readily into monomers like β chains. In contrast, γ116Ile→His chains form monomers and dimers upon dilution. These results are consistent with the slower assembly rate in vitro of γ and γ112Thr→Cys with α chains, whereas the faster rate of assembly of γ116Ile→His and γ112Thr→Asp chains with α chains, like β chains, may be caused by dissociation to monomers. These results suggest that dissociation of γ2 dimers to monomers limits formation of Hb F in vitro. However, yields of soluble Hb F expressed in bacteria were similar to Hb A, and no unassembled α and γ chains were detected. These results indicate that γ chains assemble in vivo with α chains prior to forming stable γ2 dimers, possibly binding to α chains as partially folded nascent γ-globin chains prior to release from polyribosomes.

These results suggest that dissociation of γ2 dimers to monomers limits formation of Hb F in vitro. However, yields of soluble Hb F expressed in bacteria were similar to Hb A, and no unassembled α and γ chains were detected. These results indicate that γ chains assemble in vivo with α chains prior to forming stable γ2 dimers, possibly binding to α chains as partially folded nascent γ-globin chains prior to release from polyribosomes. methionine aminopeptidase base pair polymerase chain reaction ribosome binding site isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol dithiothreitol polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis electrospray ionization mass spectrometry Elevated levels of Hb F (α2γ2) in red blood cells can inhibit Hb S polymerization in sickle cell disease, and increased expression of γ-globin chains can supplement for lack of β chains in β thalassemia. However, our present knowledge of the mechanism of formation of Hb F, as well as Hb A, in vivo is far from complete. Despite intensive experimental scrutiny, the mechanism of stable αγ assembly to form Hb F in vitroand in vivo is not well understood. In addition, elucidation of this mechanism may be critical in the design of optimal γ-chain Hb variants with anti-polymerization properties that assemble efficiently with α chains to form Hb F heterotetramers. The primary structure of the γ chain of human Hb F is highly homologous to that of the β chain, differing in 39 of 146 residues. Twenty-two of these residues are on the external surface of the molecule. The internal substitutions are conservative, involving amino acids of similar polarity. Four substitutions occur at the α1β1 (α1γ1) interface and probably account for the increased stability of Hb F and its decreased dissociation into α- and γ-chain monomers. In contrast, only one difference occurs at the α1β2 (α1γ2) interface (Glu versus Asp at position 43 of the β and γ chain, respectively), which may not affect interactions with α chains, because this interface is important for subunit cooperativity and oxygen affinity (1.Bunn H.F. Forget B.G. Hemoglobin: Molecular, Genetic and Clinical Aspects. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1986: 13-140Google Scholar). Thus, the structural differences between γ and β chains would not be expected to cause any gross functional perturbations. However, levels of Hb F could be affected by differences in assembly with α chains compared with β chains (1.Bunn H.F. Forget B.G. Hemoglobin: Molecular, Genetic and Clinical Aspects. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1986: 13-140Google Scholar). Because there are four amino acid differences at the α1β1and α1γ1 interface in β and γ subunits, respectively, relative rates of binding of γ chains with α subunits might be expected to differ from β chains. Furthermore, differences between Thr at γ112 at the α1γ1interaction site instead of Cys at β112 make it difficult to isolate individual native, heme-intact γ chains from native α2γ2 tetramers usingp-mercuribenzoate, which is used to isolate α and β chains from Hb A (2.Huehns E.R. Dance N. Jacobs M. Beaven G.H. Shooter E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Assembly in vitro of human hemoglobin subunits (α and β or γ chains) into stable heterotetramers (α2β2 or α2γ2) has been explored and proposed to occur by a three-step mechanism (3.Bucci E. Fronticelli C. Chiancone E. Wyman J. Antonini E. Rossi-Fanelli A. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 4.Antonini E. Bucci E. Fronticelli C. Chiancone E.

The α chains are in monomer/dimer equilibrium and favor formation of monomers, whereas β or γ chains are in monomer/tetramer equilibrium favoring formation of tetramers. It is generally assumed that dissociation of these oligomeric subunits into monomers must occur before these two different chains can combine to form αβ or αγ dimers (3.Bucci E. Fronticelli C. Chiancone E. Wyman J. Antonini E. Rossi-Fanelli A. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The slow assembly in vitroof isolated γ- with α-globin chains was reported previously (9.Hueens E. Beaven G.H. Stevens B.L. Biochem. J. 1964; 92: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar,10.Kawamura-Konishi Y. Suzuki H. Biochem. Int. 1989; 19: 469-476PubMed Google Scholar). However, reasons for the apparent slow assembly in vitro with α chains comparing γ versus β chains is not clear. In this study we produced soluble normal and variant γ chains, as well as Hb F, in bacteria and compared assembly rates to further understand reasons for slow assembly in vitro of γ compared with β chains with α chains. In addition, a possible mechanism for assembly in vivo of α and non-α chains is discussed based on our findings in vitro. The original pHE2 plasmid was constructed to coexpress α- and β-globin chains in bacteria with methionine aminopeptidase (MAP)1 under transcriptional control of a tac promoter to obtain soluble authentic human Hb A lacking the chain-initiating N-terminal methionines (11.Shen T. Ho N.T. Simplaceanu V. Zou M. Green B.N. Tam M.F. Ho C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8108-8112Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Using this system we previously expressed individual β-globin chains after removing the α-globin cDNA fragment (12.Yamaguchi T. Pang J. Reddy K.S. Witkowska H.E. Surrey S. Adachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26677-26683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To achieve expression of individual Gγ-globin chains and Hb F, the human γ-globin cDNA (441 bp) was obtained by PCR from pGS 389γ, which we previously used as a yeast expression vector and which contains α- and γ-globin cDNAs (13.Adachi K. Pang J. Konitzer P. Surrey S. Blood. 1996; 15: 1617-1624Crossref Google Scholar). Two primers, #1 (5′-TACCGTTCTGACTTCGAAATA-3′ linked to a 5′ sequence that contains aPstI site and is complementary to a ribosome binding site (RBS) present in pHE2) and #2 (5′-TGTGAAATGACCCATATGTTATTCCTCCT-3′, which contains a 3′-end sequence corresponding to the RBS in pHE2 followed by a 24-bp complementary overlap to primer #3 (see below)), were used to generate PCR fragment 1. Fragment 1 therefore contains aPstI site linked to an RBS. Two other primers, #3 (5′-GAATAACATATGGGTCATTTCACAGAGGA-3′, which is complementary to the RBS and the 5′-untranslated region of γ-globin cDNA in pGS 389γ) and #4 (5′-GACCGC-TTCTGCGTTCGTA-3′, which contains an NheI site followed by a 3′-end γ-cDNA sequence), were used to generate PCR fragment 2. We then created a third PCR product, which contains PCR fragments 1 and 2 by overlap PCR using primers #1 and #4. Annealing of PCR fragments 1 and 2 was facilitated by sequence complementarity of primers #2 and #3 originally used to generate PCR fragments 1 and 2, respectively. The resultant PCR fragment 3 contains a 5′PstI site linked to an RBS followed by full-length human γ-globin cDNA linked to a 3′ NheI site. PCR fragment 3 was isolated, digested with PstI and NheI, and then exchanged for β-globin cDNA in the vector pHE2 afterPstI and NheI digestion to remove the β-globin cDNA insert. The resulting vector pHE2αγ contains both α- and γ-globin cDNA for expressing Hb F in bacteria. The α-globin cDNA insert was removed following digestion with XbaI, and the remaining fragment was isolated and religated to generate pHE2γ, which was used for expression of individual γ chains in bacteria. A diagram of the γ-globin-expressing plasmid, pHE2γ, is shown in Fig. 1. γ112-globin-chain variants (e.g. γ112Thr→Cys and γ112Thr→Asp) and γ116Ile→His were constructed by oligonucleotide mutagenesis using pHE2γ. The basic strategy for generation of these variants by site-specific mutagenesis of the normal γ chain involves recombination/PCR as described previously (14.Adachi K. Konitzer P. Kim J. Welch N. Surrey S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21650-21656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clones were subjected to DNA sequence analysis of the entire γ-globin cDNA region using site-specific primers and fluorescently tagged terminators in a cycle sequencing reaction in which extension products were analyzed on an automated DNA sequencer. The same conditions were used for expression of the γ-chain variants as those to express β chains except human γ-globin cDNA was not modified to contain triplet codons preferred for translation inE. coli. The plasmids were transfected into E. coli (JM 109) (Promega Co., Madison, WI), and bacteria were grown at 30 °C with shaking at 225 rpm in a liter of Terrific broth containing 10 μm ampicillin to a density of about 3 × 1010 bacteria/ml. Expression of γ-globin chains or Hb F (α2γ2) was induced for 1 h at 30 °C by addition of 0.2 mm IPTG (Fisher), and cultures were then supplemented with 30 μm hemin (Aldrich) and 1% glucose (w/v). After 1 h of induction and before cell lysis, bacterial cultures were saturated with CO gas to convert expressed γ-globin chains and Hb F to the CO form. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation at 2,300 × g for 20 min, resuspended in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, lysed by sonication at 4 °C, and then centrifuged at 4 °C for 45 min at 27,000 × g. Soluble γ-globin chains and Hb F were purified as described below at 4 °C, and CO gas was introduced at each purification step to maintain γ globin or Hb F in the CO form. The supernatant containing γ-globin chains was applied to a Q Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, the column was washed with 5 column volumes of buffer, and the γ-globin fraction was eluted with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.3. The partially purified γ-globin fraction was rechromatographed on a SOURCE 15S column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 40 mm BisTris/HCl buffer, pH 5.8, and γ globin was eluted following a linear gradient to 40 mmBisTris/HCl buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl, pH 6.3. The purified soluble γ globin was then concentrated by Centriprep 10 (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA) and stored at −70 °C. The supernatant containing Hb F was applied to a CM 52 cellulose column (Whatman) equilibrated with 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and then fractions were eluted with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.5. The partially purified Hb F fraction was rechromatographed on a SOURCE 15S column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 40 mm BisTris buffer, pH 5.8, and Hb F was eluted following a linear gradient of 40 mm BisTris buffer, pH 5.8, to 40 mm BisTris buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl, pH 6.3. The purified soluble Hb F was then concentrated by Centriprep 10 and stored at −70 °C. Authentic human α-globin chains were purified from tetrameric Hb A isolated from erythrocyte lysates according to previously described methods (15.Ascoli F. Rossi-Fanelli M.R. Antonini E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 72-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Removal of p-mercuribenzoate was accomplished using 20 mm DTT, and globin chains were isolated by gel filtration on a Superose 12 column. Assembled tetramers were characterized after separation from excess free globin chains by fast protein liquid chromatography using a SOURCE 15S column. Formation of α2γ2 tetramers was also monitored by high protein liquid chromatography using a POROS HQ/H 4.6 mm/100 column (PerSeptive Biosystems, Inc., Framingham, MA) (12.Yamaguchi T. Pang J. Reddy K.S. Witkowska H.E. Surrey S. Adachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26677-26683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and by cellulose acetate electrophoresis on Titan III membranes at pH 8.6 with Super-Heme buffer (Tris-EDTA, boric acid, pH 8.2–8.6) (Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, TX). Sample purity and molecular weights were assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (16.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ES-MS) was performed on a VG Quatt Ro II triple quadrapole mass spectrometer (Micromass, Altrincham, Cheshire, UK) (17.Shackleton C.H. Witkowska H.E. Desideria D.M. Mass Spectrometry: Clinical and Biomedical Applications. 2. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1994: 135-199Crossref Google Scholar) for determination of mass of purified γ chains and Hb F, as well as to evaluate N-terminal methionine cleavage from γ-globin chains. The multiply charged ions derived from human γ globin (M r 15,995.3) and α globin (M r 15,126.4) served as an internal or external standard for mass scale calibration when analyzing Hb F and recombinant γ-globin proteins, respectively. Data analysis was performed using the MassLynx® software package (Micromass, Altrincham, Cheshire, UK). Purified γ-globin chains including variants and in vitro-assembled α2γ2 heterotetramers were also analyzed by cellulose acetate electrophoresis, and mobilities were compared with those of authentic human Hb F. Characterization of homoassembly of γ globins was achieved by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superose 12 column in 0.1 mTris-HCl, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, at room temperature (22 °C) (18.Yamaguchi T. Pang J. Reddy K.S. Surrey S. Adachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14179-14185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Absorption spectra of the purified γ-globin chains in the CO form were recorded using a Hitachi U-3010 spectrophotometer (Hitachi Instruments, Inc., Danbury, CT). Globin concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using a millimolar extinction coefficient of 13.4 at 540 nm for carbonmonoxy hemoglobin (19.Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reaction with Ligands. 21. North-Holland, Amsterdam1971: 9Google Scholar). Soluble human γ-globin was expressed in E. coli and purified by a combination of two ion-exchange chromatography steps using Q Sepharose and SOURCE 15S columns. Approximate yield of soluble purified γ globin was 4 mg/liter of culture after a 1-h induction period, which was similar to that of expressed soluble β chains and about 50% of that when α and β chains are coexpressed to form soluble tetrameric Hb A under the same conditions (12.Yamaguchi T. Pang J. Reddy K.S. Witkowska H.E. Surrey S. Adachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26677-26683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The γ-globin fraction eluted as a single peak from SOURCE 15S chromatography, and SDS-PAGE showed one major band of 16 kDa with a minor 32-kDa band, which was converted to 16 kDa following DTT treatment (Fig. 2). These results suggest that a small fraction of γ chains can participate in disulfide bond formation. In contrast, expressed soluble β-globin exists predominantly as homodimers (12.Yamaguchi T. Pang J. Reddy K.S. Witkowska H.E. Surrey S. Adachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26677-26683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), presumably because Cys is present at β112 instead of Thr, which is present at γ112. We also expressed two γ112-chain variants (e.g. γ112Thr→Cysand γ112Thr→Asp) and γ116Ile→His chains and compared their migration on SDS-PAGE to normal γ-globin chains (data not shown). Electrospray mass spectrometry of purified γ-globin chains revealed a major species at 15,997.9 Da (Fig. 3,left panel), which corresponds to the expected mass of the human γ-globin chain. This result also indicates complete cleavage of the N-terminal, chain-initiating methionine from γ-globin chains in bacteria by the coexpressed MAP. We also used pHE2αγ to express Hb F using the same conditions to express γ chains, and yields of Hb F were similar to that of Hb A. Electrospray mass analysis of purified Hb F showed two major peaks, 15,126.28 and 15,996.4 Da, corresponding to α and γ globins, respectively (Fig. 3, right panel). Furthermore, mass spectral analysis of the two γ112-chain variants (e.g. γ112Thr→Cys and γ112Thr→Asp) and γ116Ile→His chains by ES-MS showed expected results of 15,997.2, 16,009.8, and 16,019.3, respectively. The purified soluble γ-globin chains (CO form) showed a typical absorption spectra with peaks at 568, 538, 419, 342, and 270 nm, which were similar to β chains but not exactly the same. The ultraviolet spectra of the γ-globin chains differed from those of β chains (Fig.4), specifically in the 290-nm region, no doubt caused by the increased absorption of 3 instead of 2 tryptophans comparing γ-globin versus β-globin chains (10.Kawamura-Konishi Y. Suzuki H. Biochem. Int. 1989; 19: 469-476PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Dance N. Huehns E.R. Beaven G.H. Biochem. J. 1983; 87: 240-248Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To investigate the formation in vitro of Hb F from isolated native α and recombinant γ chains, equimolar mixtures of these chains in the CO form were incubated in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at room temperature (22 °C). We confirmed that Hb F formation in mixtures of γ and α chains is very slow as reported previously (9.Hueens E. Beaven G.H. Stevens B.L. Biochem. J. 1964; 92: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 10.Kawamura-Konishi Y. Suzuki H. Biochem. Int. 1989; 19: 469-476PubMed Google Scholar). Cellulose acetate electrophoresis of a mixture of equal amounts of α and γ chains shows about 10% Hb F formation relative to total γ chains in addition to unreacted γ and α chains after a 2-day incubation. These results were not affected by addition of DTT, indicating little cross-linked dimer formation by γ93 Cys. Furthermore, assembly rates of these unliganded chains were similar whether γ- and α-globin chains were in the deoxy or CO form. These results are in contrast to assembly in vitro of α and β chains, which leads to Hb A formation in less than 10 min under the same conditions (6.McDonald M.J. Turci S.M. Mrabet N.T. Himelstein B.P. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5951-5956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Joshi A.A. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8549-8553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6487-6490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The time course for Hb F formation expressed as relative amounts of γ chain incorporated into Hb F compared with total γ chain is shown in Fig.5. Hb F formation exhibited a first-order rate constant of 1 × 10−3 h−1, which is consistent with previously reported results using γ chains separated from human Hb F (10.Kawamura-Konishi Y. Suzuki H. Biochem. Int. 1989; 19: 469-476PubMed Google Scholar), which indicates a 3.6 × 105-fold slower rate of assembly than Hb A formation with α and β chains (10.Kawamura-Konishi Y. Suzuki H. Biochem. Int. 1989; 19: 469-476PubMed Google Scholar). With higher concentrations of β chains (>25 μm), the kinetics of assembly of β chains with α chains follow a first-order reaction, which is dependent on dissociation of oligomeric β chains to monomers. However, at lower concentrations (<10 μm) the kinetics of assembly is second-order with a rate constant of 2 × 105m−1 s−1 (22.McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6487-6490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, at lower γ-chain concentrations (<10 μm) the assembly rate of γ with α chains was not significantly changed. These results suggest that either 1) dissociation of oligomeric or dimeric γ chains to monomers follows a first-order reaction with a slow rate; and/or 2) assembly of γ- and α-chain monomers is very slow. Amino acids at the α1β1 interface in Hb A differ from those at the α1γ1 interface in Hb F at four positions (e.g. β51 Pro, β112 Cys, β116 His, and β125 Pro versus γ51 Ala, γ112 Thr, γ116 Ile, and γ125 Glu, respectively) (1.Bunn H.F. Forget B.G. Hemoglobin: Molecular, Genetic and Clinical Aspects. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1986: 13-140Google Scholar). Thr at γ112 instead of Cys, which is present at β112, is one of four differences between the β- and γ-chain interaction sites with α chains, and γ112 Thr is expected to promote stability of αγ dimers (1.Bunn H.F. Forget B.G. Hemoglobin: Molecular, Genetic and Clinical Aspects. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1986: 13-140Google Scholar). We, however, previously reported that assembly of β112Cys→Thr chains with α chains was only slightly inhibited (18.Yamaguchi T. Pang J. Reddy K.S. Surrey S. Adachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14179-14185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), indicating that the slower assembly rate in vitro of γ with α chains is not simply because of the difference between Thr and Cys at the 112 position in the γ and β chains, respectively. We also previously reported that β112Cys→Asp chains readily dissociate to monomers, which facilitates association with α chains (18.Yamaguchi T. Pang J. Reddy K.S. Surrey S. Adachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14179-14185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Therefore, we evaluated the hypothesis that assembly rates of two γ112-chain variants (γ112Thr→Cys and γ112Thr→Asp) with α chains should differ, because the γ112 Thr→Asp change should promote γ-chain monomer formation and facilitate α- and γ-chain assembly to form Hb F. At Hb concentration of 75 μm the rate of assembly of γ112Thr→Cyswith α chains was similar to that of wild type γ chains, whereas assembly of γ112Thr→Asp with α chains was similar to β chains (Fig. 5). These results are consistent with our previously reported results of assembly of β112 variants (18.Yamaguchi T. Pang J. Reddy K.S. Surrey S. Adachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14179-14185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), indicating that differences between β112 Cys and γ112 Thr do not contribute to differences in heterotetramer formation rates in vitro of Hb A and Hb F. Furthermore, our results with γ112Thr→Aspchains suggest that amino acid changes that promote γ-chain monomer formation facilitate assembly with α chains. We also evaluated assembly of the γ116Ile→His variant, because this position is located at an αγ/αβ interaction site, and γ and β differ at this position (e.g. γ116Ile versus β116His). Assembly of γ116Ile→His with α chains was similar to that of β chains (Fig. 5), indicating that this amino acid difference between β and γ plays a critical role in the observed differences in γversus β assembly in vitro with α chains. In addition, as expected, equimolar mixtures of γ, βA (or βS), and α chains showed only formation of Hb A (or Hb S) and no Hb F, suggesting that γ chains do not compete with βA or βS in assembly in vitrowith limiting amounts of α chains. Because results described above showed that formation of γ-chain monomers was rate-limiting for assembly in vitrowith α chains to form Hb F, we next characterized homoassembly of individual γ chains using size-exclusion chromatography at different γ-chain concentrations and compared those results to self-assembly of normal β and β112 variant chains (Fig.6) (18.Yamaguchi T. Pang J. Reddy K.S. Surrey S. Adachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14179-14185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We previously showed that β112Cys→Asp chains form only monomers below 150 μm (25-μl sample application to column) (18.Yamaguchi T. Pang J. Reddy K.S. Surrey S. Adachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14179-14185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The position of β-chain elution peaks depends on concentration; the higher the concentration, the shorter the retention time, because β chains are in self-equilibrium as tetramers, dimers, and monomers (Fig.7). At lower concentrations the monomeric form predominates, but at higher concentrations the tetrameric form predominates. Homoassembly of β chains could be explained by a monomer-tetramer equilibrium (23.Valdes R. Ackers G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 74-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Results with γ112Thr→Asp chains were similar to those of β chains, although the curve defining the relationship between concentration and retention time is shifted left of that of the β chains, indicating less dissociation to monomers. In contrast, the retention time of normal γ chains was not concentration-dependent like that of β chains, and stable dimer formation may be favored at lower γ-chain concentrations, which is similar to the dimer-tetramer equilibrium of liganded α2β2heterotetramers (1.Bunn H.F. Forget B.G. Hemoglobin: Molecular, Genetic and Clinical Aspects. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1986: 13-140Google Scholar, 18.Yamaguchi T. Pang J. Reddy K.S. Surrey S. Adachi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14179-14185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Results for the γ112Thr→Cysvariant were similar to those of γ chains. However, this variant formed stable dimers more readily than normal γ chains. Results for the γ116Ile→His variant differed from those of the γ112Thr→Cys variant. Elution profile for γ116Ile→His chains showed a major peak with a slower eluting shoulder when applied to the column at <25 μm, and upon dilution the slower eluting peak increased (Fig. 7). The faster and slower elution peaks correspond to γ-chain dimers and monomers, respectively. At higher concentrations the elution profile contained a single tetramer chain peak like normal β and γ chains. These results suggest that substitution of His for Ile at γ116 promotes dissociation of γ4 tetramers to dimers and monomers and that the dimers are relatively stable compared with β chains.Figure 7Size-exclusion chromatography profile of γ-chain variants. Purified γ, γ112Thr→Cys, γ112Thr→Asp, and γ116Ile→His chains were mixed with internal marker (vitamin B12 for total bed volume (Vt) of 150 μl in 0.1 m Tris-HCL, 0.1M NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) and applied to a Superose 12 column at room temperature.

Surprisingly, when the reciprocal mutations, Lys-214 → Ala (TM5), Ile-277 → Val/His-278 → Gln/Ile-279 → Val (TM6), and Ile-304 → Thr (TM7), are introduced in the δ receptor, neither the individual mutations nor their various combinations significantly reduce the binding affinities of opioid alkaloids tested. However, these mutations cause profound alterations in the functional characteristics of the mutant receptors as measured in guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate binding assays. Some agonists become antagonists at some constructs as they lose their ability to activate them. Some alkaloid antagonists are transformed into agonists at other constructs, but their agonistic effects can still be blocked by the peptide antagonist TIPP. Even the δ inverse agonist 7-benzylidenenaltrexone becomes an agonist at the mutant containing both the Ile-277 → Val/His-278 → Gln/Ile-279 → Val and Ile-304 → Thr mutations. Thus, although the mutated residues are thought to be part of the binding pocket, they are critically involved in the control of the δ receptor activation process. These findings shed light on some of the structural bases of ligand efficacy. They are also compatible with the hypothesis that a ligand may achieve high affinity binding in several different ways, each having different effects on receptor activation.

In the opioid field, a study conducted soon after the cloning of opioid receptors showed that the Asp residue in the TM21 of the δ receptor was responsible for high affinity agonist binding (13.Kong H. Raynor K. Yasuda K. Moe S.T. Portoghese P.S. Bell G.I. Reisine T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23055-23058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Agonist and antagonist were suggested to bind to different domains of the κ receptor (14.Kong H. Raynor K. Yano H. Takeda J. Bell G.I. Reisine T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8042-8046Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). A study focused on the charged residues in the μ receptor revealed that His to Asn or Gln mutations increased the intrinsic activity of the μ receptor, and antagonists such as naloxone, naltrexone, and diprenorphine activated those mutants in oocyte K+ channel modulation assays (15.Surratt C.K. Johnson P.S. Moriwaki A. Seidleck B.K. Blaschak C.J. Wang J.B. Uhl G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20548-20553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Serendipitously, opioid antagonists were found to behave like agonists on the μ and the δ receptors with a mutation at a conserved Ser residue in TM4. The mutated receptors were not constitutively active, suggesting that Ser plays a specific role in the ligand-induced receptor activation process (16.Claude P.A. Wotta D.R. Zhang X.H. Prather P.L. McGinn T.M. Erickson L.J. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5715-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A partial agonist to antagonist conversion was also observed in the δ receptor with the TM2 Asp mutation (17.Bot G. Blake A.D. Li S. Reisine T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 283-290PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, there were two reports about the creation of constitutively active δ receptors through mutagenesis. One study demonstrated that the replacement of the Asp residue in TM3 with Ala, His, or Lys would endow the mutated receptors with constitutive activity. Whereas naltrindole was still an antagonist at the Asp to Ala mutant, it became an agonist at the receptor with the Ala to Lys mutation (18.Cavalli A. Babey A.M. Loh H.H. Neuroscience. 1999; 93: 1025-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Another study mutated the same Asp residue in TM3, the Tyr residue immediately below Asp in TM3, and a Tyr residue in TM7. All these receptor mutants exhibited constitutive activity, suggesting that the wild type δ receptor uses these residues to maintain its inactive state in the absence of agonists (19.Befort K. Zilliox C. Filliol D. Yue S. Kieffer B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18574-18581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although these studies greatly advance our understanding of the opioid receptor activation process, many important questions, such as what factors determine a ligand to be an agonist or an antagonist and how the binding mechanism is related to the activation process, remain to be answered. Agonist binding is the first step in ligand-induced receptor activation. Sometimes the same ligand can exhibit similar affinities but very different pharmacological properties on homologous receptors in the same gene family. Yet many other ligands will show the same agonist/antagonist properties across those homologous receptors. For example, (−)-ethylketocyclazocine and (−)-bremazocine are generally considered as agonists on the κ receptor but antagonists on the μ and the δ receptors, although their binding affinities toward the cloned opioid receptor subtypes are literally identical and the opioid receptors share many agonists and antagonists in different structural families. Such instances suggest that even if their binding affinities do not change on structurally and functionally similar receptors, ligands such as ethylketocyclazocine and bremazocine may functionally interact with different subtypes of opioid receptors in different ways. Conceptually, different receptor subtypes may share the same binding pocket for the non-selective ligands but have subtle differences in their activation “trigger.” It is also possible that the same ligand may interact with overlapping but different sets of structural elements in different opioid receptor subtypes. As a result, the same ligand may differentially influence the functional state of different receptor subtypes through different mechanisms. Since many opioid ligands share the morphine backbone structure, it has been proposed for a long time that there is a “common opioid binding pocket” in different opioid receptor subtypes. It would be interesting to learn whether the hypothetical pocket really utilizes the same structural elements in different opioid receptors and to investigate how the same ligand exerts different effects on receptor activation. In a previous study (20.Meng F. Ueda Y. Hoversten M.T. Taylor L.P. Reinscheid R.K. Monsma F.J. Watson S.J. Civelli O. Akil H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we used a “gain-of-function” combinatorial mutagenesis approach to delineate the common opioid binding pocket shared by the μ, δ, and the κ opioid receptors (21.Schwyzer R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 6335-6342Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 22.Metzger T.G. Ferguson D.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Two other groups also reported similar results (23.Mollereau C. Moisand C. Butour J.L. Parmentier M. Meunier J.C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 24.Seki T. Minami M. Kimura C. Uehara T. Nakagawa T. Satoh M. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 77: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In our hands, the OFQ receptor was successfully converted to a functional “opioid” receptor by replacing five of its residues with the corresponding residues conserved in the opioid receptors (Ala-213 → Lys (TM5), Val-276 → Ile/Gln-277 → His/Val-278 → Ile (TM6), and Thr-302 → Ile (TM7)) (20.Meng F. Ueda Y. Hoversten M.T. Taylor L.P. Reinscheid R.K. Monsma F.J. Watson S.J. Civelli O. Akil H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The OFQ receptor mutant bearing five conserved opioid receptor residues can bind opioid alkaloids such as(−)-bremazocine, naltrindole, naltrexone, and nor-binaltorphimine 2–3 orders of magnitude better than the wild type OFQ receptor. It can be activated by the opioid agonist etorphine and inhibited by the opioid antagonist naltrindole and naltrexone. In addition, that receptor also exhibits the same stereospecificity as the wild type opioid receptors. Such evidence strongly suggests that these five conserved residues are key elements of the common opioid binding pocket in the wild type opioid receptors. The goal for this study was to investigate further the properties of the common opioid binding pocket by conducting reciprocal mutations in the opioid receptors. All individual and combinatorial reciprocal mutations of those five residues were introduced into the wild type δ receptor. The properties of these mutants as well as the wild type δ receptor were analyzed side by side in both ligand and GTPγS binding assays. Our results were completely unexpected, and they might lead to a new way of understanding ligand-receptor interaction. The rat δ opioid receptor (25.Meng F. Ueda Y. Hoversten M.T. Thompson R.C. Taylor L. Watson S.J. Akil H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 311: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and the rat OFQ receptor (GenBankTM accession number U05239) used in this study were cloned in our laboratory. The δ opioid receptor mutants were made using a double-stranded mutagenesis protocol (26.Nickoloff J.A. Deng W.P. Miller E.M. Ray F.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 58: 455-468PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of intended mutations in the δ opioid receptor cDNAs was verified by sequencing the targeted regions. The wild type and mutant δ opioid receptor cDNAs were subcloned into a pCMV-neo expression vector, courtesy of Dr. M. D. Uhler (27.Huggenvik J.I. Collard M.W. Stofko R.E. Seasholtz A.F. Uhler M.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For ligand binding assays, the standard calcium-phosphate transfection method (28.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4815) Google Scholar) was used to express various receptor constructs in COS-1 cells. Each 10-cm plate of COS-1 cells was transfected with 25 μg of plasmid, and the transfected cells were harvested 48 h after washing away the calcium phosphate-DNA precipitates. Receptor binding assay was performed according to Goldstein and Naidu (29.Goldstein A. Naidu A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 265-272PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane preparations derived from the transfected cells were incubated with about 2 nm[3H]bremazocine at room temperature for 1 h, and the free ligand and the receptor-bound ligand were separated using a 24-head Brandel cell harvester (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD). All competition assays were conducted with nine different competing ligand concentrations at 1:5 dilution in duplicate. All data points represent the mean of three or four independent assays as indicated by the table legend. Binding data were analyzed with the Prism program (GraphPad Software Inc.). For GTPγS binding assays, the transfection reagent FuGene 6 was used to transfect COS-1 cells in 10-cm plates according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Transfected cells were harvested 48 h later by scraping them off the plate in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cell pellets were collected by spinning at 5,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. They were then resuspended in an ice-cold lysis buffer containing 5 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.0, 5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and homogenized. The cell homogenate was spun at 2,500 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. It was centrifuged again at 40,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet generated by the second spin was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.32m sucrose and frozen at −80 °C if not used immediately. The protein concentration of the membrane preparation was measured by Bio-Rad protein assay. [35S]GTPγS binding was conducted according to Tianet al. (30.Tian W.N. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. Deth R.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 524-531PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. For each assay, 10 μg of membrane proteins were incubated in a final volume of 100 μl with various concentrations of opioid ligands and a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 6 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.035% CHAPS, 30 μm GDP, and 0.1 nm [35S]GTPγS. Basal stimulation level was assayed in the absence of ligand, whereas nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 20 μm GTPγS. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, membrane-bound GTPγS was separated from free GTPγS using a Brandel harvester by washing the membrane mixture 3 times with 4 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm NaCl through GF/B filters under vacuum. The ligand-stimulated GTPγS binding for all receptor constructs presented in each figure was measured side by side, and each assay was repeated for at least three independently transfected cell preparations. Bound radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. EC50 values were determined using the Prism software. Results from our laboratory as well as from other groups strongly suggested that the Lys residue at the top of TM5, the Ile-His-Ile residues in the middle of TM6, and the Ile residue in the upper half of TM7 were critically involved in the binding of opioid alkaloids (20.Meng F. Ueda Y. Hoversten M.T. Taylor L.P. Reinscheid R.K. Monsma F.J. Watson S.J. Civelli O. Akil H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar,23.Mollereau C. Moisand C. Butour J.L. Parmentier M. Meunier J.C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 24.Seki T. Minami M. Kimura C. Uehara T. Nakagawa T. Satoh M. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 77: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In the context of the OFQ receptor, the effects of these mutated residues are largely additive. The OFQ receptor carrying the full complement of mutations has the stereospecificity of the wild type opioid receptors, and it can stimulate GTPγS binding in the presence of opioid agonist etorphine. At that stage, we hypothesized that these five residues are critical components of the common opioid binding pocket, and we expected that the reciprocal mutations in the opioid receptors would greatly reduce their affinities toward the opioid ligands. However, initial characterization with the reciprocal Lys-214 → Ala mutation in both the δ and the κ receptor indicated that this mutation did not decrease the affinity of opioid alkaloids as expected, despite the fact that the Ala-213 → Lys mutation in the OFQ receptor increased the affinity of (−)-bremazocine, naltrindole, and naltrexone by around 100-fold. In order to analyze further this unexpected result, individual Lys-214 → Ala, Ile-277 → Val/His-278 → Gln/Ile-279 → Val, and Ile-304 → Thr mutations as well as all their permutations were introduced into the wild type δ opioid receptor, and these receptor mutants were subjected to both binding and functional assays. The competition binding results are summarized in TableI. It can be seen clearly that the affinity of the tested ligands toward various receptors is highly related to their structures. For the alkaloid ligands that possess an aromatic phenol ring, e.g. (−)-bremazocine, naltrindole, naltrexone, and etorphine, none of the mutants showed an affinity that deviated more than 5-fold from the wild type δ receptor. Even in the δ mutant that contains all five OFQ receptor residue replacements, none of the alkaloids mentioned above showed a more than 3-fold decrease in binding affinity. This is in sharp contrast to its reciprocal OFQ receptor mutant, in which the affinity of the same opioid alkaloids was increased by 100–1000-fold. In fact, data in Table I would not support the idea that the five critical opioid receptor-specific residues identified through the OFQ receptor mutagenesis study have anything to do with the binding of opioid alkaloids. By contrast, SNC80, a very potent δ selective agonist with a very different structure (31.Knapp R.J. Santoro G. De Leon I.A. Lee K.B. Edsall S.A. Waite S. Malatynska E. Varga E. Calderon S.N.

Open table in a new tab TIPP binding assay was conducted in GTPγS binding buffer, and the rest were in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4. The binding affinities of several other ligands were reduced by 5-fold or more in some of the mutants. The binding affinities of several δ peptide agonists, Leu-enkephalin, [d-Pen2,5]enkephalin, and deltorphin II, were reduced significantly by some of the individual mutations, and the combination of individual mutations frequently lead to even worse binding affinities. Such results suggest that the presence of all five opioid receptor-specific residues is important for the binding ofpeptide agonists. However, TIPP, a δ-selectivepeptide antagonist, exhibits a pattern that is different from that of the δ peptide agonists. Individual mutations at most decreased its affinity by 8-fold, and the combination of all the mutations did not lead to any further deterioration in affinity. The intriguing nature of the alkaloid binding data prompted us to study the functional properties of these mutants in a GTPγS binding assay. Fig. 1 summarizes the effect of the non-selective opioid agonist etorphine and the δ-selective agonist SNC80 on GTPγS binding. Several tendencies are evident from the agonist stimulation data presented in this figure. First, the mutants with the Lys-214 → Ala mutation alone show greatly reduced maximum stimulation levels. Furthermore, the presence of the Lys-214 → Ala mutation also reduces the activation of all mutants that contain it,i.e. Lys-214 → Ala + Ile-277 → Val/His-278 → Gln/Ile-279 → Val and Lys-214 → Ala + Ile-304 → Thr. Second, the Ile-277 → Val/His-278 → Gln/Ile-279 → Val and Ile-304 → Thr mutations alone do not decrease and may possibly even increase the maximum stimulation level. Third, the combination of the Ile-277 → Val/His-278 → Gln/Ile-279 → Val and Ile-304 → Thr mutation seems to increase the maximum stimulation level of the mutant receptor over that of the wild type δ receptor. The high maximum stimulation level shown by the Lys-214 → Ala + Ile-277 → Val/His-278 → Gln/Ile-279 → Val + Ile-304 → Thr mutant may result from the dominance of Ile-277 → Val/His-278 → Gln/Ile-279 → Val + Ile-304 → Thrs beneficial effect over the Lys-214 → Ala detrimental effect on agonist-stimulated GTPγS binding. Finally, the EC50values for these receptors are very similar to each other. This is understandable given the fact that the binding affinity of these receptors toward etorphine and SNC80 are not significantly altered. Whereas the maximum stimulation levels of these receptors suggest differences in the activation properties of various mutants, the results need to be interpreted cautiously due the transiently transfected cells used in these assays. However, more striking qualitative differences were discovered when we studied the effect of classical opioid alkaloid antagonists on these receptors. It can be seen clearly from Fig. 2, Aand B, that (−)-bremazocine and naltrindole, both of which are antagonists at the δ receptor, could significantly stimulate GTPγS binding at receptors bearing the Ile-277 → Val/His-278 → Gln/Ile-279 → Val and/or Ile-304 → Thr mutations. Furthermore, their stimulatory effects could be blocked by TIPP, a δ-selective peptide antagonist. In fact, (−)-bremazocine and naltrindole behaved in a manner fully comparable to the effect of the agonist etorphine on GTPγS binding assays. Such antagonist-to-agonist change on the Ile-277 → Val/His-278 → Gln/Ile-279 → Val + Ile-304 → Thr and the Lys-214 → Ala + Ile-277 → Val/His-278 → Gln/Ile-279 → Val + Ile-304 → Thr δ mutants was completely unexpected from their wild type-like alkaloid binding profiles. Since the Lys-214 → Ala mutant could not be significantly stimulated by any of the ligands tested, we were interested in finding out whether this receptor could couple to G protein. Since high potassium buffer will elevate the basal activity of a G protein-coupled receptor (32.Szekeres P.G. Traynor J.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 283: 1276-1284PubMed Google Scholar), we tested the response of the Lys-214 → Ala mutant to δ inverse agonist in the presence of 100 mm KCl. It can be seen from Fig. 3 that the presence of the classical δ inverse agonist ICI174863 and BNTX could further reduce the GTPγS binding level of the Lys-214 → Ala mutant. The δ peptide antagonist TIPP could block the inverse agonist effects of both ligands. These data indicate that the Lys-214 → Ala mutant can still couple to G protein, and the mutation we created selectively impaired its agonist-induced activation but not its ability to couple to G protein(s). We also tested the Ile-277 → Val/His-278 → Gln/Ile-279 → Val + Ile-304 → Thr mutant as well as the wild type δ receptor in the high potassium buffer. All ligands tested showed the expected properties on the wild type δ receptor (Fig. 3). However, the Ile-277 → Val/His-278 → Gln/Ile-279 → Val + Ile-304 → Thr mutant demonstrated another unusual property; instead of reducing the basal GTPγS binding level as it did on the wild type δ receptor, BNTX stimulated GTPγS binding. In other words, the δ inverse agonist BNTX now becomes an agonist at this mutant. The structure of BNTX is very similar to naltrindole and since naltrindole is an agonist on the Ile-277 → Val/His-278 → Gln/Ile-279 → Val + Ile-304 → Thr mutant, it seems to be reasonable that BNTX is also an agonist at this receptor. Data presented in Fig. 3 also indicate that such inverse agonist to agonist change was highly related to ligand structure since the classical peptidergic δ inverse agonist ICI173864 still decreased the basal GTPγS binding on the Ile-277 → Val/His-278 → Gln/Ile-279 → Val + Ile-304 → Thr mutant. In the present study, we mutated several residues within the δ opioid receptor, converting them to the equivalent residues found in the OFQ receptor, with the working hypothesis that these residues are part of a common opioid binding pocket and that these mutations would therefore interfere with ligand binding. Our results demonstrate the following. 1) Contrary to expectations, the binding of opiatealkaloid ligands was not significantly altered by either the individual mutations or by various combinations. 2) By contrast, the binding of the more selective opioid peptide agonists was significantly reduced in receptors with multiple mutations. 3) The mutant receptors exhibited significantly altered activation properties, even by ligands that had unchanged binding affinities, indicating that the chosen sites were critical in determining ligandefficacy. 4) More specifically, the Lys-214 → Ala mutant could hardly be activated by opioid agonists although it could still couple to G protein(s) since inverse agonists were still active at this receptor. This fact pinpoints this site as a key structural element for agonist-induced G protein activation. 5) In the mutants with simultaneous Ile-277 → Val/His-278 → Gln/Ile-279 → Val and Ile-304 → Thr mutations, alkaloid antagonists (−)-bremazocine and naltrindole became agonists. Even the δ inverse agonist BNTX was transformed into an agonist on the Ile-277 → Val/His-278 → Gln/Ile-279 → Val + Ile-304 → Thr receptor mutant. Taken together, these findings lead us to expand our view of a common opioid binding pocket in the opioid receptors. They also begin to pinpoint specific sites that play a critical role in determining the efficacy of opiate ligands. At first glance, the results with alkaloid binding appear puzzling. After all, other groups and we (20.Meng F. Ueda Y. Hoversten M.T. Taylor L.P. Reinscheid R.K. Monsma F.J. Watson S.J. Civelli O. Akil H. Mol.

Pharmacol. 1998; 77: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) had made the reciprocal mutations in the context of the OFQ receptor and endowed this receptor with the ability to bind opiate alkaloids. Given the high degree of sequence homology between the OFQ and the opioid receptors, given that the chosen residues were conserved across all opioid receptors and divergent in the OFQ receptor which does not bind opioids, and given that changing these residues to their opioid equivalents was sufficient to endow the OFQ receptor with the ability to bind opioid alkaloids, it was logical to suppose that these sites were critical to the binding of these alkaloids to their own receptors and that they represented part of the common opioid binding pocket. The present results force us to revise this view and reconsider the very concept of a single common binding pocket. Yet, the results also show that these sites are far from irrelevant. They are important to the binding of the more selective peptide ligands, and more interestingly, they play an unexpected role in receptor activation and the determination of agonist/antagonist properties of various ligands. If one believes that the OFQ receptor gain-of-function data is not coincidental, the earlier work together with the body of current data strongly suggest that there are multiple ways of generating what appears to be a common opioid binding pocket even in the same receptor. In other words, those small opioid alkaloid ligands that are non-selective and work well in the context of all three opioid receptors may be doing so because each of these receptors may be able to accommodate them in a variety of different ways. There are presumably a large number of residues that are critical in forming the opiate binding cavity. When we introduced a subset of these critical residues into a homologous receptor, the OFQ receptor, we introduced one of many possible configurations that can accommodate the opioid alkaloids, hence the gain of opioid alkaloid binding in those constructs. However, when we alter these very sites within the opioid receptors, we are altering only one of a set of possible high affinity binding pockets, and this cannot be detected with our ligand binding techniques. This model of a more complex range of ligand-receptor interactions provides a way to understand the observed significant functional change in the absence of binding affinity change. Different ways of receptor interaction for the same ligand may have different effects on receptor activation. Therefore the agonist/antagonist property of a ligand can be viewed as the statistical average of the effects produced by different ways of interaction at a given receptor. How can such multiple ways of interaction with the same ligand coexist in one receptor? One way of achieving it is through the adoption of different receptor conformations. It has been proposed for a long time that a receptor may exist in multiple functional states, each with a different conformation (6.Schwartz T.W. Ijzerman A.P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1998; 19: 433-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 33.Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Pardo L. Campillo M. Giraldo J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 335: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 35.Seifert R. Gether U. Wenzel-Seifert K. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 348-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Depending on their size and structure, ligands may fit one or more of these conformations and may stabilize primarily those that either can drive G protein coupling (agonists), or fail to drive it (antagonists), or prevent G protein coupling (inverse agonists). Our results would suggest that the residues we have identified participate in biasing the receptors into conformations that either favor agonism or antagonism. Thus, the constructs containing the Ala-213 → Lys mutation appear less likely to adopt a structure that can be driven to an activated conformation when bound by certain ligands typically classified as agonists. By contrast, the constructs with the simultaneous Ile-277 → Val/His-278 → Gln/Ile-279 → Val and Ile-304 → Thr mutations greatly favor agonist conformations after alkaloid ligand binding even when activated by alkaloid ligands that typically produce antagonism. For ligands such as TIPP and ICI174863, either they cannot drive their conformation to an agonistic state or they will selectively bind to a receptor conformation for antagonist and/or inverse agonist that is not significantly altered by the mutations introduced. Thus, our mutations seem to have biased the likely conformational patterns of the constructs for specific ligands either toward agonism or toward antagonism. Alternatively, there is the possibility that even one particular conformational state of a receptor may contain multiple binding pockets for a given ligand. These binding pockets are most likely overlapping and therefore mutually exclusive. Each binding pocket may trigger the activation process differently. Upon ligand binding, some of these pockets may promote the coupling of G protein, some may inhibit G protein coupling, and yet others may have no effect on G protein coupling. A ligand will interact with different binding pockets dynamically, and the amount of time that a ligand spends in a given binding pocket will be proportional to its affinity toward that pocket. Therefore the apparent agonist/antagonist property of a ligand on a receptor will be the average of the properties of different binding pockets, weighted by their corresponding affinity value for that ligand. The elimination of an antagonistic binding pocket will increase the efficacy of the concerned ligand. Similarly, the deletion of an agonistic binding pocket will decrease the efficacy of a ligand. As a result, the observed ligand-specific qualitative change in agonist/antagonist property becomes very easy to understand. Most likely, the residues we mutated are critical elements for a high affinity antagonistic alkaloid binding pocket in the wild type δ receptor. At the same time, there must also be agonistic binding pocket(s) with equal or somewhat lower affinity that survives our mutation in the δ receptor. This can be the reason that classical alkaloid antagonists, even an alkaloid inverse agonist, become agonists at the δ receptor containing Ile-277 → Val/His-278 → Gln/Ile-279 → Val and Ile-304 → Thr mutations. This view is consistent with our previous OFQ receptor mutation results where alkaloid antagonists showed the most significant affinity increase (20.Meng F. Ueda Y. Hoversten M.T. Taylor L.P. Reinscheid R.K. Monsma F.J. Watson S.J. Civelli O. Akil H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Furthermore, since the peptide antagonist TIPP and the peptide inverse antagonist ICI174863 most likely use binding pocket(s) that are very different from those used by alkaloids, it is easy to understand that their antagonistic/inverse antagonistic properties remain unchanged on our δ receptor mutants. This is in contrast to the situation reported for the TM4 Ser mutant where all tested δ antagonists, whether alkaloid or peptide, became agonists (16.Claude P.A. Wotta D.R. Zhang X.H. Prather P.L. McGinn T.M. Erickson L.J. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5715-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Therefore the residues uncovered in this study are most likely associated with the binding pocket(s) and thus are more close to the trigger(s) of receptor activation, whereas the TM4 Ser may be a key residue relatively downstream in the receptor activation process. This view that a given ligand can fit into a receptor in multiple ways suggests that the term common opioid binding pocket may only be used in the context of binding affinity. Because the structural elements in the common opioid binding pocket may be shared across opioid receptor subtypes, the opioid binding pockets are not identical even in the same receptor. Such an hypothesis can help interpret a number of previous findings. For example, our own work with the dopamine D2 receptor binding pocket has suggested that a flexible ligand, N-0417, can form hydrogen bonding interactions at either of two different, equidistant sites. Thus, if one mutates one of these sites at a time, no alteration in binding is seen. When they are mutated simultaneously, no binding can take place (36.Mansour A. Meng F. Meador-Woodruff J.H. Taylor L.P. Civelli O. Akil H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 227: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This lack of additivity between the single mutations and the dual mutations and the chemical structure of the ligands strongly point to alternative receptor-ligand interactions. Similarly, this view explains why certain non-selective opiate alkaloids such as bremazocine are generally so resistant to the effects of mutagenesis. Extensive studies from our laboratory and others have produced opioid receptor constructs with dramatically altered binding profiles, wherein numerous peptide and selective ligands showed dramatic losses in affinity, whereas ligands such as bremazocine and ethylketocyclazocine continue to bind with nanomolar affinities. With the above model, we would argue that these non-selective alkaloid ligands could continue to interact with the remaining available sites for binding within the receptor cavity. It may well be the case that the larger peptidergic ligands that tend to be more selective than alkaloids toward a given opioid receptor need to come into contact with many more of the critical residues at once. As a result, mutagenesis of the residues we have chosen would affect their binding even though it does not affect the binding of the smaller, less selective alkaloids. This is in fact the case in the present study, where the selective peptides showed significant losses in affinity, especially in the constructs with a combination of mutations. Thus, although the differential effect of the mutations on alkaloids and peptides is correlated with degree of selectivity, we do not think of the residues we mutated as directly involved in producing δ receptor selectivity, especially that these residues are conserved across all three opioid receptors. Rather, we see these results as reflecting greater constraints on the binding of the peptidergic ligands, allowing for less alternative ways of fitting in the cavity, with this being reflected as a loss in affinity. This view is further supported by the results of our gain-of-function study wherein the altered OFQ constructs could bind a range of alkaloids of various selectivity but, with the exception of the dynorphins, could not bind the opioid peptides. In summary, our results expand our view of how ligands of various classes interact within the δ opioid receptor in particular and this family of G protein-coupled receptors in general. They support a more complex view of the opioid binding pocket and identify a set of specific residues as representing key components of that pocket, capable of endowing a related receptor with alkaloid binding and responsible for biasing the state of efficacy of the opioid receptor.
