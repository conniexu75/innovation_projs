https://openalex.org/W2026745039,"At the surface of the Indian Ocean along the equator a narrow, jet-like current flows eastward at high speed during both transition periods between the two monsoons. The formation of the jet is accompanied by thermocline uplifting at the western origin of the jet and by sinking at its eastern terminus. This demonstrates that a time-variable current can have profound effects in changing the mass structure in the ocean."
https://openalex.org/W2048554937,Large-scale variations in the obliquity of the planet Mars are produced by a coupling between the motion of its orbit plane due to the gravitational perturbations of the other planets and the precession of its spin axis which results from the solar torque exerted on the equatorial bulge of the planet. The obliquity oscillates on a time scale of approximately 1.2 x 10(5) years. The amplitude of this oscillation itself varies periodically on a time scale of 1.2 X 10(6) years. The present-day obliquity is approximately 25.1 degrees. The maximum possible variation is from about 14.9 to 35.5 degrees. Signtificant climatic effects must be associated with the phenomenon.

According to this model, these deposits were produced as a result of the migration of salt-saturated aqueous solutions to Io's surface from a warm or hot interior followed by loss of the water to space. This model satisfies cosmochemical constraints based on Io's initial composition, current density, and thermal history. Salt-rich assemblages are easily derivable from the leaching of carbonaceous chondritic material; the chemical and optical properties of such deposits, after modification by irradiation, can be used to explain Io's overall albedo and spectral reflectance, its dark reddish poles, and the observed sodium emission as well as or better than other currently suggested materials."
https://openalex.org/W2044865712,"Water vapor that condenses on a metal surface at 10 degrees K forms a noncrystalline phase of estimated density 1.2 grams per cubic centimeter. X-ray diffraction data of high precision and resolution have been analyzed to yield oxygen atom pair correlation functions. The positional correlation in amorphous solid water extends over only a few molecular radii, and the radial distribution of nearneighbor oxygen atoms in amorphous solid water is qualitatively different from that found in the low-pressure ice modifications. Amorphous solid water is a useful material for liquid water models because it can be studied under conditions such that the effects of static disorder and thermal excitation can be separated."
https://openalex.org/W1990029296,"Nine separate very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) experiments, carried out in 1972 and 1973 with radio telescopes 3900 kilometers apart, yielded values for the baseline length with a root-mean-square deviation about the mean of less than 20 centitneters. The corresponding fractional spread is about five parts in 10(8). Changes in universal time and in polar motion were also detertnined accurately from these data; the root-mean-square scatter of these results with respect to those based on optical methods were 2.9 milliseconds and 1.3 meters, respectively. Solid-earth tides were apparently detected, but no useful estimate of their amplituide was extracted."
https://openalex.org/W2020061003,"The cadmium content of 23 Illinois coals ranges from less than 0.3 to 28 parts per million. The higher cadmium contents are found in coals that also have a relatively high zinc content. Cadmium occurs in these coals in solid solution, replacing zinc in the mineral sphalerite (ZnS). The ratios of zinc to cadmium in sphalerites are similar to the ratios of zinc to cadmium in the whole coals from which the sphalerites were separated."

Results are presented to illustrate how the magnitude of changes in the length, thickness, and velocity of surging glaciers can be simulated by the model."

Improvements in food production in nearby relatively favorable areas could alleviate the present situation whereby a disastrous food shortage must become ""newsworthy"" throughout the world before the ponderous machinery of international assistance and very expensive intercontinental staple grain shipments are made. Such planning would allow man to be far less at the mercy of the annual whims of seasonal weather for his food supply."

https://openalex.org/W1972828486,A kinetic model based on allosteric mechanisms of cooperativity fits the experimentally observed phosphate dependence of hemoglobin reactions. Subunit inequivalence is found to be important in analyzing hemoglobin kinetics. The observed increase in the rate of deoxygenation in the presence of organic phosphates is primarily related to the increased rate of dissociation of the second oxygen molecule.

https://openalex.org/W1993911260,"This summer, in cooperation with the Mexican government's National Council of Science and Technology, the AAAS marked its 125th anniversary with a special meeting in Mexico City, the association's first in Latin America. For the occasion, News and Comment asked Edward Edelson, a science writer for the New York Daily News who has covered previous AAAS meetings, to review the Mexico City gathering from a reporter's point of view. A second article by Robert Gillette of the News and Comment staff will elaborate on the objectives of the meeting and on the difficulties of organizing a major international conference."
