https://openalex.org/W2411861063,"We developed a computational method to infer the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences of tumor-infiltrating T cells in 9,142 RNA-seq samples across 29 cancer types. We identified over 600,000 CDR3 sequences, including 15% that were full length. CDR3 sequence length distribution and amino acid conservation, as well as variable gene usage, for infiltrating T cells in many tumors, except in brain and kidney cancers, resembled those for peripheral blood cells from healthy donors. We observed a strong association between T cell diversity and tumor mutation load, and we predicted SPAG5 and TSSK6 as putative immunogenic cancer/testis antigens in multiple cancers. Finally, we identified three potential immunogenic somatic mutations on the basis of their co-occurrence with CDR3 sequences. One of them, a PRAMEF4 mutation encoding p.Phe300Val, was predicted to result in peptide binding strongly to both MHC class I and class II molecules, with matched HLA types in its carriers. Our analyses have the potential to simultaneously identify immunogenic neoantigens and tumor-reactive T cell clonotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2415046030,"Orange-red fluorescent proteins (FPs) are widely used in biomedical research for multiplexed epifluorescence microscopy with GFP-based probes, but their different excitation requirements make multiplexing with new advanced microscopy methods difficult. Separately, orange-red FPs are useful for deep-tissue imaging in mammals owing to the relative tissue transmissibility of orange-red light, but their dependence on illumination limits their sensitivity as reporters in deep tissues. Here we describe CyOFP1, a bright, engineered, orange-red FP that is excitable by cyan light. We show that CyOFP1 enables single-excitation multiplexed imaging with GFP-based probes in single-photon and two-photon microscopy, including time-lapse imaging in light-sheet systems. CyOFP1 also serves as an efficient acceptor for resonance energy transfer from the highly catalytic blue-emitting luciferase NanoLuc. An optimized fusion of CyOFP1 and NanoLuc, called Antares, functions as a highly sensitive bioluminescent reporter in vivo, producing substantially brighter signals from deep tissues than firefly luciferase and other bioluminescent proteins."

A recombinant vaccine containing Aventis Pasteur's canarypox vector (ALVAC)–HIV and gp120 alum decreased the risk of HIV acquisition in the RV144 vaccine trial. The substitution of alum with the more immunogenic MF59 adjuvant is under consideration for the next efficacy human trial. We found here that an ALVAC–simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and gp120 alum (ALVAC–SIV + gp120) equivalent vaccine, but not an ALVAC–SIV + gp120 MF59 vaccine, was efficacious in delaying the onset of SIVmac251 in rhesus macaques, despite the higher immunogenicity of the latter adjuvant. Vaccine efficacy was associated with alum-induced, but not with MF59-induced, envelope (Env)-dependent mucosal innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) that produce interleukin (IL)-17, as well as with mucosal IgG to the gp120 variable region 2 (V2) and the expression of 12 genes, ten of which are part of the RAS pathway. The association between RAS activation and vaccine efficacy was also observed in an independent efficacious SIV-vaccine approach. Whether RAS activation, mucosal ILCs and antibodies to V2 are also important hallmarks of HIV-vaccine efficacy in humans will require further studies."

A promising therapeutic strategy for diverse genetic disorders involves transplantation of autologous stem cells that have been genetically corrected ex vivo. A major challenge in such approaches is a loss of stem cell potency during culture. Here we describe an artificial niche for maintaining muscle stem cells (MuSCs) in vitro in a potent, quiescent state. Using a machine learning method, we identified a molecular signature of quiescence and used it to screen for factors that could maintain mouse MuSC quiescence, thus defining a quiescence medium (QM). We also engineered muscle fibers that mimic the native myofiber of the MuSC niche. Mouse MuSCs maintained in QM on engineered fibers showed enhanced potential for engraftment, tissue regeneration and self-renewal after transplantation in mice. An artificial niche adapted to human cells similarly extended the quiescence of human MuSCs in vitro and enhanced their potency in vivo. Our approach for maintaining quiescence may be applicable to stem cells isolated from other tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2408906775,"Exposures to cocaine and morphine produce similar adaptations in nucleus accumbens (NAc)-based behaviors, yet produce very different adaptations at NAc excitatory synapses. In an effort to explain this paradox, we found that both drugs induced NMDA receptor-containing, AMPA receptor-silent excitatory synapses, albeit in distinct cell types through opposing cellular mechanisms. Cocaine selectively induced silent synapses in D1-type neurons, likely via a synaptogenesis process, whereas morphine induced silent synapses in D2-type neurons via internalization of AMPA receptors from pre-existing synapses. After drug withdrawal, cocaine-generated silent synapses became 'unsilenced' by recruiting AMPA receptors to strengthen excitatory inputs to D1-type neurons, whereas morphine-generated silent synapses were likely eliminated to weaken excitatory inputs to D2-type neurons. Thus, these cell type-specific, opposing mechanisms produced the same net shift of the balance between excitatory inputs to D1- and D2-type NAc neurons, which may underlie certain common alterations in NAc-based behaviors induced by both classes of drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2413994622,"Intercellular protein-protein interactions (PPIs) enable communication between cells in diverse biological processes, including cell proliferation, immune responses, infection, and synaptic transmission, but they are challenging to visualize because existing techniques have insufficient sensitivity and/or specificity. Here we report a split horseradish peroxidase (sHRP) as a sensitive and specific tool for the detection of intercellular PPIs. The two sHRP fragments, engineered through screening of 17 cut sites in HRP followed by directed evolution, reconstitute into an active form when driven together by an intercellular PPI, producing bright fluorescence or contrast for electron microscopy. Fusing the sHRP fragments to the proteins neurexin (NRX) and neuroligin (NLG), which bind each other across the synaptic cleft, enabled sensitive visualization of synapses between specific sets of neurons, including two classes of synapses in the mouse visual system. sHRP should be widely applicable to studying mechanisms of communication between a variety of cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2415553457,"A screening approach involving ten larval zebrafish behavior assays and the similarity search tool, phenoBlast, for compounds that phenocopy the antipsychotic haloperidol identifies finazines that may work partially through the sigma-1 (σ1) receptor. Many psychiatric drugs act on multiple targets and therefore require screening assays that encompass a wide target space. With sufficiently rich phenotyping and a large sampling of compounds, it should be possible to identify compounds with desired mechanisms of action on the basis of behavioral profiles alone. Although zebrafish (Danio rerio) behavior has been used to rapidly identify neuroactive compounds, it is not clear what types of behavioral assays would be necessary to identify multitarget compounds such as antipsychotics. Here we developed a battery of behavioral assays in larval zebrafish to determine whether behavioral profiles can provide sufficient phenotypic resolution to identify and classify psychiatric drugs. Using the antipsychotic drug haloperidol as a test case, we found that behavioral profiles of haloperidol-treated zebrafish could be used to identify previously uncharacterized compounds with desired antipsychotic-like activities and multitarget mechanisms of action."

Yet, very little is known about how VP neuron responses contribute to behavioral responses to incentive cues. Here, we recorded activity of VP neurons in a cue-driven reward-seeking task previously shown to require neural activity in the NAc. We find that VP neurons encode both learned cue value and subsequent reward seeking and that activity in VP neurons is required for robust cue-elicited reward seeking. Surprisingly, the onset of VP neuron responses occurs at a shorter latency than cue-elicited responses in NAc neurons. This suggests that this VP encoding is not a passive response to signals generated in the NAc and that VP neurons integrate sensory and motivation-related information received directly from other mesocorticolimbic inputs.

The ventral pallidum (VP) is a critical output structure of the ventral basal ganglia (Heimer et al., 1982Heimer L. Switzer R.D. Van Hoesen G.W.

The canonical view of VP is that it is a relay for NAc “indirect” pathway signals (Gittis et al., 2014Gittis A.H. Berke J.D. Bevan M.D. Chan C.S. Mallet N. Morrow M.M. Schmidt R.

Dynamic computation of incentive salience: “wanting” what was never “liked”.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 12220-12228Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), the relationship between VP cue responses and cue-induced reward seeking actions has not been studied. Here, we report that, like NAc neurons (Ambroggi et al., 2011Ambroggi F. Ghazizadeh A. Nicola S.M. Fields H.L. Roles of nucleus accumbens core and shell in incentive-cue responding and behavioral inhibition.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 6820-6830Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, Yun et al., 2004Yun I.A.

Neurosci. 2004; 20: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), VP neurons are required for optimal performance of a DS task. We then investigated how VP neurons encode a DS, how this compares to NAc responses, and whether VP neuron responses predict the vigor of subsequent reward seeking actions. Rats were trained to perform a DS task, in which presses on the “active” lever during the DS (an auditory cue lasting up to 10 s) resulted in delivery of liquid sucrose (10%). Presses made in the absence of the DS or during presentations of an alternative auditory cue (the non-rewarded stimulus [NS]) had no programmed consequences (Figure 1A). First, we investigated whether activity in VP neurons is necessary for performance of the task, by infusing a low-dose mixture of the GABAA agonist muscimol and the GABAB agonist baclofen into the VP of rats trained to respond to at least 60% of DS presentations. Inactivation reduced the probability of a response to the DS (t(6) = 3.087, p = 0.0215; Figure 1C) but had no effect on total active lever presses (t(6) = 0.9702, p = 0.36; Figure 1E) or on active presses during the intertrial interval (t(5) = 0.095, p = 0.92) or during the NS (t(6) = 0.6689, p = 0.5284; Figure 1D). VP inactivation slightly but significantly enhanced the low number of inactive lever presses (t(6) = 2.542, p = 0.044; Figure 1F). Because 3/7 rats made zero DS responses following VP inhibition, the effect on latency could not be reliably assessed. Overall, these results establish a role for VP activity in performance in the DS task, but not what information about the DS is encoded by VP neuronal activity. To address this question, we recorded the activity of VP neurons during performance of the task. Rats were trained until they made active lever presses on >80% of DS trials and <20% of NS trials and were implanted with drivable multielectrode arrays aimed at VP. Following retraining, we recorded from 577 neurons throughout the rostrocaudal extent of VP (6 rats, 45 sessions; Figures 1G and S1A). Basal firing rates ranged from 0.2 to 18.7 Hz (interquartile range: 2.9–6.7; median = 4.7) and were not correlated with the magnitude of cue responses, or their encoding of behavioral responses. While many VP neurons responded to multiple task events (Figures 1H and S2), we focused our primary analysis on explicit cue responses. Using our first response detection method, searching for post-cue bins in which firing rate is outside the 99% confidence interval of the baseline firing rate (10 s pre-cue), we found that the majority of VP neurons are excited by the DS (426/577, 73.8%; Figures 1H and 1I), whereas a smaller proportion are inhibited (62/577, 10.7%) and/or exhibit both response types (23/577, 4%). This large proportion of DS responsive neurons in the VP (more than 70%) was surprising, given the much smaller proportion observed in the NAc (15%–20% excited, 10%–15% inhibited; Ambroggi et al., 2011Ambroggi F. Ghazizadeh A. Nicola S.M. Fields H.L. Roles of nucleus accumbens core and shell in incentive-cue responding and behavioral inhibition.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 6820-6830Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We expected the onset of VP responses to the DS to reflect upstream responses in NAc and thus to occur at longer latency. However, we observed VP DS excitations at short latencies (Figure 1K), similar to those we previously reported for DS excitations in NAc (Figure 1J). To compare the latencies of DS-evoked responses in the VP and NAc, we reanalyzed previous NAc recordings from rats performing the identical task (Ambroggi et al., 2011Ambroggi F. Ghazizadeh A. Nicola S.M. Fields H.L. Roles of nucleus accumbens core and shell in incentive-cue responding and behavioral inhibition.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 6820-6830Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), using the same onset detection criteria. Rats in both cohorts received identical training, in the same operant boxes, and were trained to identical criteria. VP excitations to the DS had a shorter onset latency (median = 90 ms) than either NAc excitations (median = 110 ms; t(642) = 7.06, p < 0.0001) or inhibitions (median = 200 ms; t(533) = 14.5, p < 0.0001; Figure 1L). This suggests that short latency DS-evoked excitations in VP neurons are not driven by phasic NAc responses to the cue. In contrast, VP inhibitions to the DS (median = 170 ms; Figure 1M) are detected after NAc excitations (t(295) = 4.708, p < 0.0001) and at a similar latency to NAc inhibitions (t(186) = 0.051, p = 0.96). We next assessed whether the changes in VP neuron firing, which predominantly precede those observed “upstream” in the NAc, occurred differentially to the DS versus the NS. Because the onset of inhibitions occurred at a longer latency (Figure 1M), we conducted this analysis on firing during time windows based on these onsets (90–300 ms for excitations, 200–300 ms for inhibitions). While the majority of neurons recorded in VP were significantly excited by the DS (392/577, 73.5%; Figure 2A), about half of these neurons were also excited by the NS (214/392, 54.9%; Figure 2A). The magnitude of NS responses was significantly smaller than to the DS (t(391) = 29.26, p < 0.001) and the majority of individual neurons were more excited by the DS than the NS (Figures 2B–2D; 54% of total neurons). To assess the predictive ability of VP neuron firing rates, we ran receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis (Figures 2E and 2F) to assess detection of the DS (versus baseline), the NS, and cue identity (DS versus NS), calculating the area under the ROC curve (auROC) for each neuron for each time window. We found that the population auROC distribution was significantly different from a control distribution (mean control auROC = 0.497) for the detection of the DS (t(576) = 12.1026, p < 0.001), and identification of the DS versus the NS (t(576) = 20.58, p < 0.001; Figure 2E), but not for detection of the NS (t(576) = 1.3297, p = 0.18). This provides additional evidence that firing in the VP neural population is predictive of the occurrence of the DS and of the identity of the DS versus the NS. In comparison to the DS-excited population, a small proportion of VP neurons were inhibited by the DS (85/577, 14.7%). A slightly larger proportion of neurons were inhibited by the NS (108/577, 18.7%; x2 = 7.299, p < 0.001; Figure 2G), many of which were excited by the DS (76/108 neurons, 70%), and exhibited a brief excitation to the NS prior to the inhibition (53/108, 90–300 ms post-DS; Figures 2I and 2J). Inhibitions selective to the DS were generally not preceded by excitations (Figures 2I and 2J). We hypothesize that these NS inhibitions contribute to inhibiting inappropriate responding. Beyond representing the predictive value of the DS, VP neurons responded differentially depending on the speed and likelihood of a subsequent reward-seeking response. This suggests that VP neurons not only encode the incentive value of the DS but promote responding to it. We analyzed DS trials based on whether they were followed by an active lever press or not (Figure 3A) and found that, as a group, DS-excited neurons are significantly more excited when the DS is followed by reward seeking (t(333) = 17.27, p < 0.001; Figures 3B and 3E). Further, of the 334 DS-excited neurons from sessions with >10 omitted trials, more than half (188/334, 56.3%) had significantly greater DS excitations on trials with a lever press, though even on omitted trials VP responses to the DS are still greater than responses to the NS (t(331) = −3.57, p < 0.001). In contrast to the excitations, the DS inhibitions were not significantly different in magnitude based on behavioral response (Figures 3B and 3F; t(49) = −0.49, p = 0.63), suggesting that inhibitions encode something more static than incentive motivation. Consistent with this, inhibitions to the DS were stronger than to the NS, even when the DS was not followed by a response (t(49) = −6.97, p < 0.0001). While DS inhibitions do not encode response likelihood, it is possible that DS inhibitions in a subset of VP neurons are necessary for DS-induced reward seeking. We also assessed firing to the DS on trials with and without a lever press using ROC curve analysis and found that the auROC distribution was significantly greater than the control distribution (Figure 3C; t(576) = 19.49, p < 0.001) and that the majority of VP neurons had auROCs greater than 95% of control auROCs (333 neurons, 57.7%), further suggesting that VP neuron excitations encode the likelihood of reward seeking. Finally, we examined whether the DS response on a given trial is related to the latency of the animal to respond on that trial, by running Spearman rank correlations on individual neurons (Figures 3G, 3H, and S3). The firing rate of 156 (27%) neurons following the DS significantly predicted the animal’s latency to make a lever press. In most of these neurons (n = 144), the DS-evoked firing rate was inversely correlated with latency to lever press. Even when we restricted our analysis to the inhibition analysis window, few neurons had positive correlations (200–300 ms post-DS; 12/577 neurons, 2.08%; Figure S3C). These findings indicate that VP neuron DS excitations encode the motivational strength of the reward predictive cue and may play a causal role in the vigor of approach to the lever after the cue. Based on our electrophysiological data, we hypothesized that inhibition of VP during the cue period would slow and/or reduce the likelihood of DS-induced responses. We targeted expression of ArchT3.0-eYFP or eYFP alone to VP, implanted an optic fiber over VP (Figures 4A–4C), and trained rats in the DS task until they responded on >80% of DS trials and <20% of NS trials. On the test day, we illuminated VP with green light (∼15 mW) for the full duration of the DS during 50% of DS presentations (Figure S4A). We found that bilateral photoinhibition of VP during the DS significantly increased latency to lever press (Figures 4D and 4E; laser X virus: F(1,11) = 10.615, p = 0.008). Additionally, photoinhibition of VP increased the number of omissions (Figures 4G and 4H; laser X virus: F(1,11) = 6.672, p = 0.025). That inhibition of VP during the DS acutely increases both latency to respond to the DS, as well as the likelihood of a response omission indicates that VP activity during the cue actively promotes DS-elicited reward seeking behavior. Here, we demonstrate that the majority of VP neurons are robustly excited by a cue signaling the availability of reward. The onsets of DS-evoked excitations are detected at a shorter latency than either excitations or inhibitions of NAc neurons in the same task, suggesting that VP DS excitations are driven primarily by inputs other than NAc MSNs. That these VP neuron excitations promote reward seeking is supported by three lines of evidence: first, DS excitations are greater when followed by a reward-seeking response. Second, the firing rate of many neurons following the DS is significantly inversely correlated with the animal’s latency to respond. Finally, optogenetic inhibition of VP neurons during DS presentations increases the latency of reward-seeking actions following the DS, as well as the probability of omissions. Together, these findings demonstrate that activity in VP neurons is a critical mechanism by which incentive stimuli generate reward-seeking behavior. Much interest in the role of VP in reward seeking stems from its proposed role as a major downstream target of the NAc. Previous work has demonstrated that NAc neurons encode cue value (Ambroggi et al., 2008Ambroggi F. Ishikawa A. Fields H.L. Nicola S.M.

Neurophysiol. 2004; 91: 1840-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and we had expected that VP activity would reflect upstream encoding in NAc. However, our data are not consistent with this idea. First, we find that reward-predictive cues are more widely represented in the VP than in the NAc, which could be driven by NAc neurons if they had an extensive axonal arborization within the VP. Yet, anatomical data suggest that this is not the case (Tripathi et al., 2010Tripathi A. Prensa L. Cebrián C. Mengual E. Axonal branching patterns of nucleus accumbens neurons in the rat.J. Comp. Neurol. 2010; 518: 4649-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Second, the onset latencies of most VP excitations to the DS are too short to be evoked by cue-evoked phasic inhibitions or phasic excitations in the NAc. Therefore, the earliest components of the excitatory DS responses in many VP neurons, which predict the latency to initiate a reward-seeking response, are not driven or gated by transient changes in NAc neuron firing. NAc inputs to VP may play an important role in cue-elicited reward seeking that is independent of the timing of cue-evoked responses in NAc neurons, as suggested by work using either tonic inhibition or “disconnection” of this pathway (Leung and Balleine, 2013Leung B.K.

Inputs from NAc to VP may also be important for inhibitions observed following both the DS and the NS, which occur at a sufficient latency (Hakan et al., 1992Hakan R.L. Berg G.I. Henriksen S.J.

Approximately 17% of NAc core neurons and 12% of NAc shell neurons are excited by the DS (Ambroggi et al., 2011Ambroggi F. Ghazizadeh A. Nicola S.M. Fields H.L. Roles of nucleus accumbens core and shell in incentive-cue responding and behavioral inhibition.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 6820-6830Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar); these neurons could mediate the inhibitions observed downstream in VP. Yet, the magnitude of VP neuron inhibitions evoked by the DS does not differ depending on whether the animal makes a subsequent lever press. Overall, our results are not consistent with the hypothesis that phasic encoding of the incentive strength of the DS by VP neurons is driven by upstream phasic encoding in NAc. Given this, what is the origin of the phasic signals to the VP that drive, or that could be integrated to drive, VP encoding of DS response vigor? VP neurons receive inputs from a variety of “limbic” areas including the prefrontal, insular, and orbital cortices, and basolateral amygdala (Kelley et al., 1982Kelley A.E.E. Domesick V.B.B.

Knockdown and overexpression experiments in utero showed that Ash2l and Mef2c regulate nicotine-mediated dendritic remodeling and changes in passive avoidance behavior. Developmental nicotine exposure causes persistent changes in cortical neuron morphology and in behavior. We used microarray screening to identify master transcriptional or epigenetic regulators mediating these effects of nicotine and discovered increases in Ash2l mRNA, encoding a component of a histone methyltransferase complex. We therefore examined genome-wide changes in trimethylation of histone H3 on Lys4 (H3K4me3), a mark induced by the Ash2l complex associated with increased gene transcription. A large proportion of regulated promoter sites were involved in synapse maintenance. We found that Mef2c interacts with Ash2l and mediates changes in H3K4me3. Knockdown of Ash2l or Mef2c abolished nicotine-mediated alterations of dendritic complexity in vitro and in vivo, and attenuated nicotine-dependent changes in passive avoidance behavior. In contrast, overexpression mimicked nicotine-mediated alterations of neuronal structure and passive avoidance behavior. These studies identify Ash2l as a target induced by nicotinic stimulation that couples developmental nicotine exposure to changes in brain epigenetic marks, neuronal structure and behavior."

https://openalex.org/W2403508573,"Phosphatase and tensin homologue (Pten) suppresses neoplastic growth by negatively regulating PI(3)K signalling through its phosphatase activity. To gain insight into the actions of non-catalytic Pten domains in normal physiological processes and tumorigenesis, we engineered mice lacking the PDZ-binding domain (PDZ-BD). Here, we show that the PDZ-BD regulates centrosome movement and that its heterozygous or homozygous deletion promotes aneuploidy and tumour formation. We found that Pten is recruited to pre-mitotic centrosomes in a Plk1-dependent fashion to create a docking site for protein complexes containing the PDZ-domain-containing protein Dlg1 (also known as Sap97) and Eg5 (also known as Kif11), a kinesin essential for centrosome movement and bipolar spindle formation. Docking of Dlg1-Eg5 complexes to Pten depended on Eg5 phosphorylation by the Nek9-Nek6 mitotic kinase cascade and Cdk1. PDZ-BD deletion or Dlg1 ablation impaired loading of Eg5 onto centrosomes and spindle pole motility, yielding asymmetrical spindles that are prone to chromosome missegregation. Collectively, these data demonstrate that Pten, through the Dlg1-binding ability of its PDZ-BD, accumulates phosphorylated Eg5 at duplicated centrosomes to establish symmetrical bipolar spindles that properly segregate chromosomes, and suggest that this function contributes to tumour suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2500790641,"Objective To examine how palliative medicine doctors engage patients in end-of-life (hereon, EoL) talk. To examine whether the practice of “eliciting and responding to cues”, which has been widely advocated in the EoL care literature, promotes EoL talk. Design Conversation analysis of video- and audio-recorded consultations. Participants Unselected terminally ill patients and their companions in consultation with experienced palliative medicine doctors. Setting Outpatient clinic, day therapy clinic, and inpatient unit of a single English hospice. Results Doctors most commonly promoted EoL talk through open elaboration solicitations; these created opportunities for patients to introduce–then later further articulate–EoL considerations in such a way that doctors did not overtly ask about EoL matters. Importantly, the wording of elaboration solicitations avoided assuming that patients had EoL concerns. If a patient responded to open elaboration solicitations without introducing EoL considerations, doctors sometimes pursued EoL talk by switching to a less participatory and more presumptive type of solicitation, which suggested the patient might have EoL concerns. These more overt solicitations were used only later in consultations, which indicates that doctors give precedence to patients volunteering EoL considerations, and offer them opportunities to take the lead in initiating EoL talk. There is evidence that doctors treat elaboration of patients’ talk as a resource for engaging them in EoL conversations. However, there are limitations associated with labelling that talk as “cues” as is common in EoL communication contexts. We examine these limitations and propose “possible EoL considerations” as a descriptively more accurate term. Conclusions Through communicating–via open elaboration solicitations–in ways that create opportunities for patients to volunteer EoL considerations, doctors navigate a core dilemma in promoting EoL talk: giving patients opportunities to choose whether to engage in conversations about EoL whilst being sensitive to their communication needs, preferences and state of readiness for such dialogue."
https://openalex.org/W2418270937,"This study examines the relationships between neuroticism (higher-order vulnerability factor), the cognitive styles of worry, brooding and reflection (second-order vulnerability factors) and symptoms of anxiety and depression in three groups of patients: patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and with Mixed Anxiety-Depressive Disorder (MADD). One hundred and thirty four patients completed a battery of questionnaires including measures of neuroticism, worry, rumination (brooding and reflection), anxiety and depression. Multiple mediation analyses indicate that worry may act as a mediating mechanism linking neuroticism and anxiety symptoms in the three diagnostic groups, whereas brooding-rumination may play a mediating role between neuroticism and depressive symptoms in patients with MDD and MADD and, with less certainty, in patients with GAD. Overall, our findings suggest that neuroticism may increase the risk of anxious and depressive symptoms via specific links involving either worry or brooding, respectively, and that both worry and brooding may operate in the three groups examined, irrespectively of whether anxiety or depression are the main emotions or whether they coexist without any clear predominance; consequently, we hypothesize the existence of ""specific transdiagnostic"" mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2498832613,"Temporal and spatial patterns of cetacean diversity and distribution were investigated through eight ship-based surveys carried out during spring and autumn between 2009 and 2014 on the outer continental shelf (~150m) and slope (1500m) off southeastern and southern Brazil (~23°S to ~34°S). The survey area was divided into southeast and south areas according to their oceanographic characteristics. Twenty-one species were observed in 503 sightings. The overall number of species was similar between the two areas, though it was higher in the spring in the south area. Five species were dominant and diversity varied more seasonally than spatially. ANOVA and kernel analyses showed that overall cetacean densities were higher in spring compared to autumn. Physeter macrocephalus, the most frequent species, concentrated throughout the south area at depths over 1000m in both seasons. Despite the overlapped occurrence at a broader scale, small delphinids presented latitudinal and in-offshore gradients as well as seasonal variation in distribution patterns, which could indicate habitat partitioning between some species. Delphinus delphis was only recorded in the south and its density decreased in areas where the presence of Stenella frontalis increased, mainly beyond the 250m isobath. Densities of S. longirostris and S. attenuata increased in lower latitudes and beyond the shelf break. The large delphinids Tursiops truncatus and Globicephala melas formed mixed groups in many occasions and were observed along the study area around depths of 500m. Grampus griseus was twice as frequent in the south area and densities increased in waters deeper than 600m. As expected, densities of both small and large migratory whales were higher during spring, over the continental slope, in the southeast area. The results presented here provided strong evidence on the importance of the outer continental shelf and slope to a diverse community of cetaceans occurring in the subtropical Southwestern Atlantic."
https://openalex.org/W2413179252,"Background The effect of chronic exercise activity on brown adipose tissue (BAT) is not clear, with some studies showing positive and others showing negative associations. Chronic exercise is associated with increased resting energy expenditure (REE) secondary to increased lean mass and a probable increase in BAT. Many athletes are in a state of relative energy deficit suggested by lower fat mass and hypothalamic amenorrhea. States of severe energy deficit such as anorexia nervosa are associated with reduced BAT. There are no data regarding the impact of chronic exercise activity on BAT volume or activity in young women and it is unclear whether relative energy deficiency modifies the effects of exercise on BAT. Purpose We assessed cold induced BAT volume and activity in young female athletes compared with non-athletes, and further evaluated associations of BAT with measures of REE, body composition and menstrual status. Methods The protocol was approved by our Institutional Review Board. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to study initiation. This was a cross-sectional study of 24 women (16 athletes and8 non-athletes) between 18–25 years of age. Athletes were either oligo-amenorrheic (n = 8) or eumenorrheic (n = 8).We used PET/CT scans to determine cold induced BAT activity, VMAX Encore 29 metabolic cart to obtain measures of REE, and DXA for body composition. Results Athletes and non-athletes did not differ for age or BMI. Compared with non-athletes, athletes had lower percent body fat (p = 0.002), higher percent lean mass (p = 0.01) and trended higher in REE (p = 0.09). BAT volume and activity in athletes trended lower than in non-athletes (p = 0.06; p = 0.07, respectively). We found negative associations of BAT activity with duration of amenorrhea (r = -0.46, p = 0.02).BAT volume correlated inversely with lean mass (r = -0.46, p = 0.02), and positively with percent body fat, irisin and thyroid hormones. Conclusions Our study shows a trend for lower BAT in young female athletes compared with non-athletes, and shows associations of brown fat with menstrual status and body composition. Brown fat may undergo adaptive reductions with increasing energy deficit."
https://openalex.org/W2293199886,"Small molecules identified in two high-throughput screens modulate a strobe-light-induced fear response in zebrafish larvae described as ‘innate freezing’. Some compounds cause escape-like behavior, including several that target the sigma-1 (σ1) receptor. Humans and many animals show 'freezing' behavior in response to threatening stimuli. In humans, inappropriate threat responses are fundamental characteristics of several mental illnesses. To identify small molecules that modulate threat responses, we developed a high-throughput behavioral assay in zebrafish (Danio rerio) and evaluated 10,000 compounds for their effects on freezing behavior. We found three classes of compounds that switch the threat response from freezing to escape-like behavior. We then screened these for binding activity across 45 candidate targets. Using target profile clustering, we identified the sigma-1 (σ1) receptor as having a role in the mechanism of behavioral switching and confirmed that known σ1 ligands also disrupt freezing behavior. Furthermore, mutation of the gene encoding σ1 prevented the behavioral effect of escape-inducing compounds. One compound, which we call finazine, potently bound mammalian σ1 and altered threat-response behavior in mice. Thus, pharmacological and genetic interrogation of the freezing response revealed σ1 as a mediator of threat responses in vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2414175118,"Transcription factor mediated lineage reprogramming of human pancreatic exocrine tissue could conceivably provide an unlimited supply of islets for transplantation in the treatment of diabetes. Exocrine tissue can be efficiently reprogrammed to islet-like cells using a cocktail of transcription factors: Pdx1, Ngn3, MafA and Pax4 in combination with growth factors. We show here that overexpression of exogenous Pax4 in combination with suppression of the endogenous transcription factor ARX considerably enhances the production of functional insulin-secreting β-like cells with concomitant suppression of α-cells. The efficiency was further increased by culture on laminin-coated plates in media containing low glucose concentrations. Immunocytochemistry revealed that reprogrammed cultures were composed of ~45% islet-like clusters comprising >80% monohormonal insulin+ cells. The resultant β-like cells expressed insulin protein levels at ~15–30% of that in adult human islets, efficiently processed proinsulin and packaged insulin into secretory granules, exhibited glucose responsive insulin secretion, and had an immediate and prolonged effect in normalising blood glucose levels upon transplantation into diabetic mice. We estimate that approximately 3 billion of these cells would have an immediate therapeutic effect following engraftment in type 1 diabetes patients and that one pancreas would provide sufficient tissue for numerous transplants."

Our results reveal that the 4-MUs exhibit excellent radical scavenging activities. The antioxidant mechanisms of the 4-MUs were also studied. Density Function Theory (DFT)-based quantum chemical studies were performed with the basis set at 3-21G. Molecular models of the synthesized compounds were studied to understand the antioxidant activity. The electron levels, namely HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital), for these synthesized antioxidants were also studied."
https://openalex.org/W2397579563,"Inhibitory neurons are heterogeneous in the mature brain. It is unclear when and how inhibitory neurons express distinct structural and functional profiles. Using in vivo time-lapse imaging of tectal neuron structure and visually evoked Ca(2+) responses in tadpoles, we found that inhibitory neurons cluster into two groups with opposite valence of plasticity after 4 hr of dark and visual stimulation. Half decreased dendritic arbor size and Ca(2+) responses after dark and increased them after visual stimulation, matching plasticity in excitatory neurons. Half increased dendrite arbor size and Ca(2+) responses following dark and decreased them after stimulation. At the circuit level, visually evoked excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs were potentiated by visual experience and E/I remained constant. Our results indicate that developing inhibitory neurons fall into distinct functional groups with opposite experience-dependent plasticity and as such, are well positioned to foster experience-dependent synaptic plasticity and maintain circuit stability during labile periods of circuit development."
https://openalex.org/W2412430703,"A brain-computer interface (BCI) based on code modulated visual evoked potentials (c-VEP) is among the fastest BCIs that have ever been reported, but it has not yet been given a thorough study. In this study, a pseudorandom binary M sequence and its time lag sequences are utilized for modulation of different stimuli and template matching is adopted as the method for target recognition. Five experiments were devised to investigate the effect of stimulus specificity on target recognition and we made an effort to find the optimal stimulus parameters for size, color and proximity of the stimuli, length of modulation sequence and its lag between two adjacent stimuli. By changing the values of these parameters and measuring classification accuracy of the c-VEP BCI, an optimal value of each parameter can be attained. Experimental results of ten subjects showed that stimulus size of visual angle 3.8°, white, spatial proximity of visual angle 4.8° center to center apart, modulation sequence of length 63 bits and the lag of 4 bits between adjacent stimuli yield individually superior performance. These findings provide a basis for determining stimulus presentation of a high-performance c-VEP based BCI system."
https://openalex.org/W2411703870,"The iron-sulfur cluster containing protein mitoNEET is known to modulate the oxidative capacity of cardiac mitochondria but its function during myocardial reperfusion injury after transient ischemia is unknown. The purpose of this study was to analyze the impact of mitoNEET on oxidative stress induced cell death and its relation to the glutathione-redox system in cardiomyocytes in an in vitro model of hypoxia and reoxygenation (H/R). Our results show that siRNA knockdown (KD) of mitoNEET caused an 1.9-fold increase in H/R induced apoptosis compared to H/R control while overexpression of mitoNEET caused a 53% decrease in apoptosis. Necrosis was not affected. Apoptosis of both, mitoNEET-KD and control cells was diminished to comparable levels by using the antioxidants Tiron and glutathione compound glutathione reduced ethyl ester (GSH-MEE), indicating that mitoNEET-dependent apoptosis is mediated by oxidative stress. The interplay between mitoNEET and glutathione redox system was assessed by treating cardiomyocytes with 2-acetylamino-3-[4-(2-acetylamino-2-carboxyethylsulfanylthio-carbonylamino) phenylthiocarbamoylsulfanyl] propionic acid (2-AAPA), known to effectively inhibit glutathione reductase (GSR) and to decrease the GSH/GSSG ratio. Surprisingly, inhibition of GSR-activity to 20% by 2-AAPA decreased apoptosis of control and mitoNEET-KD cells to 23% and 25% respectively, while at the same time mitoNEET-protein was increased 4-fold. This effect on mitoNEET-protein was not accessible by mitoNEET-KD but was reversed by GSH-MEE. In conclusion we show that mitoNEET protects cardiomyocytes from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis during H/R. Inhibition of GSH-recycling, GSR-activity by 2-AAPA increased mitoNEET-protein, accompanied by reduced apoptosis. Addition of GSH reversed these effects suggesting that mitoNEET can in part compensate for imbalances in the antioxidative glutathione-system and therefore could serve as a potential therapeutic approach for the oxidatively stressed myocardium."

Cows were assigned to treatments in a randomized completed block design, receiving an daily oral bolus with INO or organic trace minerals (AAC) Zn, Mn, Cu, and Co to achieve 75, 65, 11, and 1 ppm supplemental, respectively, in the diet DM. Liver tissue and blood samples were collected throughout the experiment. The lower glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase concentration after 15 days in milk in AAC cows indicate lower hepatic cell damage. The concentration of cholesterol and albumin increased, while IL-6 decreased over time in AAC cows compared with INO indicating a lower degree of inflammation and better liver function. Although the acute-phase protein ceruloplasmin tended to be lower in AAC cows and corresponded with the reduction in the inflammatory status, the tendency for greater serum amyloid A concentration in AAC indicated an inconsistent response on acute-phase proteins. Oxygen radical absorbance capacity increased over time in AAC cows. Furthermore, the concentrations of nitric oxide, nitrite, nitrate, and the ferric reducing ability of plasma decreased with AAC indicating a lower oxidative stress status. The expression of IL10 and ALB in liver tissue was greater overall in AAC cows reinforcing the anti-inflammatory response detected in plasma. The greater overall expression of PCK1 in AAC cows indicated a greater gluconeogenic capacity, and partly explained the greater milk production response over time. Overall, feeding organic trace minerals as complexed with amino acids during the transition period improved liver function and decreased inflammation and oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2417323569,"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a disease caused by Leishmania infantum, which is transmitted by phlebotomine sandflies. Dogs are the main urban reservoir of this parasite and the disease presents similar characteristics in both humans and dogs. In this paper, we investigated the potential pathways involved in plasma cell replacement of normal cell populations in the spleen, with respect to disease severity in dogs from an endemic area for visceral leishmaniasis. To this end, canine spleen samples were grouped into three categories: TYPE1SC- (non-infected dogs or without active infection with organized white pulp), TYPE1SC+ (infected dogs with organized white pulp) or TYPE3SC+ (infected animals with disorganized white pulp). We analyzed the distribution of different plasma cell isotypes (IgA, IgG and IgM) in the spleen. The expression of cytokines and chemokines involved in plasma cell homing and survival were assessed by real time RT-PCR. Polyclonal B cell activation and hypergammaglobulinemia were also evaluated. The proportion of animals with moderate or intense plasmacytosis was higher in the TYPE3SC+ group than in the other groups (Fisher test, P<0.05). This was mainly due to a higher density of IgG+ plasma cells in the red pulp of this group. The albumin/globulin ratio was lower in the TYPE3SC+ animals than in the TYPE1SC- or TYPE1SC+ animals, which evidences VL-associated dysproteinemia. Interestingly, TYPE3SC+ animals showed increased expression of the BAFF and APRIL cytokines, as well as chemokine CXCL12. Aberrant expression of BAFF, APRIL and CXCL12, together with amplified extrafollicular B cell activation, lead to plasma cell homing and the extended survival of these cells in the splenic red pulp compartment. These changes in the distribution of immunocompetent cells in the spleen may contribute to the progression of VL, and impair the spleen's ability to protect against blood borne pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2417523918,"The study of cholinergic signaling in the mammalian CNS has been greatly facilitated by the advent of mouse lines that permit the expression of reporter proteins, such as opsins, in cholinergic neurons. However, the expression of opsins could potentially perturb the physiology of opsin-expressing cholinergic neurons or mouse behavior. Indeed, the published literature includes examples of cellular and behavioral perturbations in preparations designed to drive expression of opsins in cholinergic neurons. Here we investigate expression of opsins, cellular physiology of cholinergic neurons and behavior in two mouse lines, in which channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and archaerhodopsin (Arch) are expressed in cholinergic neurons using the Cre-lox system. The two mouse lines were generated by crossing ChAT-Cre mice with Cre-dependent reporter lines Ai32(ChR2-YFP) and Ai35(Arch-GFP). In most mice from these crosses, we observed expression of ChR2 and Arch in only cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain and in other putative cholinergic neurons in the forebrain. In small numbers of mice, off-target expression occurred, in which fluorescence did not appear limited to cholinergic neurons. Whole-cell recordings from fluorescently-labeled basal forebrain neurons revealed that both proteins were functional, driving depolarization (ChR2) or hyperpolarization (Arch) upon illumination, with little effect on passive membrane properties, spiking pattern or spike waveform. Finally, performance on a behavioral discrimination task was comparable to that of wild-type mice. Our results indicate that ChAT-Cre x reporter line crosses provide a simple, effective resource for driving indicator and opsin expression in cholinergic neurons with few adverse consequences and are therefore an valuable resource for studying the cholinergic system."
https://openalex.org/W2414269343,"Urban grasslands, landscapes dominated by turfgrasses for aesthetic or recreational groundcovers, are rapidly expanding in the United States and globally. These managed ecosystems are often less diverse than the natural or agricultural lands they replace, leading to potential losses in ecosystem functioning. Research in non-urban systems has provided evidence for increases in multiple ecosystem functions associated with greater plant diversity. To test if biodiversity-ecosystem function findings are applicable to urban grasslands, we examined the effect of plant species and genotypic diversity on three ecosystem functions, using grassland assemblages of increasing diversity that were grown within a controlled environment facility. We found positive effects of plant diversity on reduced nitrate leaching and plant productivity. Soil microbial diversity (Mean Shannon Diversity, H’) of bacteria and fungi were also enhanced in multi-species plantings, suggesting that moderate increments in plant diversity influence the composition of soil biota. The results from this study indicate that plant diversity impacts multiple functions that are important in urban ecosystems; therefore, further tests of urban grassland biodiversity should be examined in situ to determine the feasibility of manipulating plant diversity as an explicit landscape design and function trait."
https://openalex.org/W2415120971,"Microsatellite or simple sequence repeat (SSR) is one of the most widely distributed molecular markers that have been widely utilized to assess genetic diversity and genetic mapping for important traits in plants. However, the understanding of microsatellite characteristics in Arachis species and the currently available amount of high-quality SSR markers remain limited. In this study, we identified 16,435 genome survey sequences SSRs (GSS-SSRs) and 40,199 expressed sequence tag SSRs (EST-SSRs) in Arachis hypogaea and its wild relative species using the publicly available sequence data. The GSS-SSRs had a density of 159.9–239.8 SSRs/Mb for wild Arachis and 1,015.8 SSR/Mb for cultivated Arachis, whereas the EST-SSRs had the density of 173.5–384.4 SSR/Mb and 250.9 SSRs/Mb for wild and cultivated Arachis, respectively. The trinucleotide SSRs were predominant across Arachis species, except that the dinucleotide accounted for most in A. hypogaea GSSs. From Arachis GSS-SSR and EST-SSR sequences, we developed 2,589 novel SSR markers that showed a high polymorphism in six diverse A. hypogaea accessions. A genetic linkage map that contained 540 novel SSR loci and 105 anchor SSR loci was constructed by case of a recombinant inbred lines F6 population. A subset of 82 randomly selected SSR markers were used to screen 39 wild and 22 cultivated Arachis accessions, which revealed a high transferability of the novel SSRs across Arachis species. Our results provided informative clues to investigate microsatellite patterns across A. hypogaea and its wild relative species and potentially facilitate the germplasm evaluation and gene mapping in Arachis species."
https://openalex.org/W2412212745,"Crinoids, members of the phylum Echinodermata, are passive suspension feeders and catch plankton without producing an active feeding current. Today, the stalked forms are known only from deep water habitats, where flow conditions are rather constant and feeding velocities relatively low. For feeding, they form a characteristic parabolic filtration fan with their arms recurved backwards into the current. The fossil record, in contrast, provides a large number of stalked crinoids that lived in shallow water settings, with more rapidly changing flow velocities and directions compared to the deep sea habitat of extant crinoids. In addition, some of the fossil representatives were possibly not as flexible as today’s crinoids and for those forms alternative feeding positions were assumed. One of these fossil crinoids is Encrinus liliiformis, which lived during the middle Triassic Muschelkalk in Central Europe. The presented project investigates different feeding postures using Computational Fluid Dynamics to analyze flow patterns forming around the crown of E. liliiformis, including experimental validation by Particle Image Velocimetry. The study comprises the analysis of different flow directions, velocities, as well as crown orientations. Results show that inflow from lateral and oral leads to direct transport of plankton particles into the crown and onto the oral surface. With current coming from the “rear” (aboral) side of the crinoid, the conical opening of the crown produces a backward oriented flow in its wake that transports particles into the crown. The results suggest that a conical feeding position may have been less dependent on stable flow conditions compared to the parabolic filtration fan. It is thus assumed that the conical feeding posture of E. liliiformis was suitable for feeding under dynamically changing flow conditions typical for the shallow marine setting of the Upper Muschelkalk."
https://openalex.org/W2417710963,"Farmers' perceptions of birds' interactions with agricultural production systems are fundamental to species conservation efforts. In the present study, we evaluated the perceptions of birds held by farmers who engage in conventional and non-conventional agricultural production processes and the implications of potential differences in these perceptions on species conservation. To accomplish this, data were collected using questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, and other complementary sources of information gathered from 191 farmers in northeastern Brazil. Although some similarities were identified among the farmers in their perceptions and local ecological knowledge (LEK) of birds, differences existed between the conventional and non-conventional farmers in their attitudes toward, conflicts with, and usage of bird species. Compared to the conventional farmers, the non-conventional farmers could identify more bird species, possessed more favorable attitudes toward birds, and engaged in practices more beneficial to the conservation of avifauna. The perceptions that were identified were related to the type of agriculture practiced, and such perceptions may affect the conservation of bird species. Therefore, the adoption of certain agricultural practices has important implications for conservation. Our results indicate the need for investment in public policies, programs and actions that account for farmers' knowledge and perceptions. Such investments will contribute to the development and adoption of practices supporting wild bird conservation in agricultural areas."
https://openalex.org/W2412849976,"The use of biocompatible materials, including bulk metallic glasses (BMGs), for tissue regeneration and transplantation is increasing. The good mechanical and corrosion properties of Ti40Zr10Cu38Pd12 BMG and its previously described biocompatibility makes it a potential candidate for medical applications. However, it is known that surface properties like topography might play an important role in regulating cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation. Thus, in the present study, Ti40Zr10Cu38Pd12 BMG and Ti6-Al-4V alloy were surface-modified electrochemically (nanomesh) or physically (microscratched) to investigate the effect of material topography on human osteoblasts cells (Saos-2) adhesion, proliferation and differentiation. For comparative purposes, the effect of mirror-like polished surfaces was also studied. Electrochemical treatments led to a highly interconnected hierarchical porous structure rich in oxides, which have been described to improve corrosion resistance, whereas microscratched surfaces showed a groove pattern with parallel trenches. Cell viability was higher than 96% for the three topographies tested and for both alloy compositions. In all cases, cells were able to adhere, proliferate and differentiate on the alloys, hence indicating that surface topography plays a minor role on these processes, although a clear cell orientation was observed on microscratched surfaces. Overall, our results provide further evidence that Ti40Zr10Cu38Pd12 BMG is an excellent candidate, in the present two topographies, for bone repair purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2411876106,"Concepcion Bank is the largest seamount in the Canary Islands Seamount Province (CISP), an oceanic area off NW Africa including 16 main seamounts, the Canaries archipelago and the Selvagens subarchipelago. The Bank is located 90 km northeast of Lanzarote Island and has been identified as a candidate Marine Protected Area (MPA) to be included in the Natura 2000 network. A compilation of complementary datasets consisting of multibeam bathymetry, TOPAS seismic reflection profiles, side scan sonar sonographs, Remotely Operated Vehicle video records and seafloor samples allowed describing in detail and ground truthing the submarine landforms and bioconstructions exhibited by the bank. The Concepcion Bank presently rises up to 2,433 m above the adjacent seafloor and exhibits two main domains: an extensive summit plateau and steep flanks. The sub-round summit plateau is 50km by 45 km and ranges from 158 to 1,485 m depth. The steep flanks that bound it descend to depths ranging between 1,700 and 2,500 m and define a seamount base that is 66km by 53 km. This morphology is the result of constructive and erosive processes involving different time scales, volumes of material and rates of change. The volcanic emplacement phase probably lasted 25–30 million years and was likely responsible for most of the 2,730 km3 of material that presently form the seamount. Subsequently, marine abrasion and, possibly, subaerial erosion modulated by global sea level oscillations, levelled the formerly emerging seamount summit plateau, in particular its shallower (<400 m), flatter (<0.5°) eastern half. Subsidence associated to the crustal cooling that followed the emplacement phase further contributed the current depth range of the seamount. The deeper and steeper (2.3°) western half of Concepcion Bank may result from tectonic tilting normal to a NNE-SSW fracture line. This fracture may still be expressed on the seafloor surface at some scarps detected on the seamount’s summit. Sediment waves and cold-water coral (CWC) mounds on the bank summit plateau are the youngest features contributing to its final shaping, and may be indicative of internal wave effects. Numerous submarine canyons generally less than 10 km in length are incised on the bank’s flanks. The most developed, hierarchized canyon system runs southwest of the bank, where it merges with other canyons coming from the southern bulges attached to some sections of the seamount flanks. These bulges are postulated as having an intrusive origin, as no major headwall landslide scars have been detected and their role as deposition areas for the submarine canyons seems to be minor. The results presented document how geological processes in the past and recent to subrecent oceanographic conditions and associated active processes determined the current physiography, morphology and sedimentary patterns of Concepcion Bank, including the development and decline of CWC mounds The setting of the seamount in the regional crustal structure is also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2412261675,"Signal transduction through the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathways is evolutionarily highly conserved. Many cells use these pathways to interpret changes to their environment and respond accordingly. The pathways are central to triggering diverse cellular responses such as survival, apoptosis, differentiation and proliferation. Though the interactions between the different MAPK pathways are complex, nevertheless, they maintain a high level of fidelity and specificity to the original signal. There are numerous theories explaining how fidelity and specificity arise within this complex context; spatio-temporal regulation of the pathways and feedback loops are thought to be very important. This paper presents an agent based computational model addressing multi-compartmentalisation and how this influences the dynamics of MAPK cascade activation. The model suggests that multi-compartmentalisation coupled with periodic MAPK kinase (MAPKK) activation may be critical factors for the emergence of oscillation and ultrasensitivity in the system. Finally, the model also establishes a link between the spatial arrangements of the cascade components and temporal activation mechanisms, and how both contribute to fidelity and specificity of MAPK mediated signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2416288350,"Active site preorganization helps native enzymes electrostatically stabilize the transition state better than the ground state for their primary substrates and achieve significant rate enhancement. In this report, we hypothesize that a complex active site model for active site preorganization modeling should help to create preorganized active site design and afford higher starting activities towards target reactions. Our matching algorithm ProdaMatch was improved by invoking effective pruning strategies and the native active sites for ten scaffolds in a benchmark test set were reproduced. The root-mean squared deviations between the matched transition states and those in the crystal structures were < 1.0 A for the ten scaffolds, and the repacking calculation results showed that 91% of the hydrogen bonds within the active sites are recovered, indicating that the active sites can be preorganized based on the predicted positions of transition states. The application of the complex active site model for de novo enzyme design was evaluated by scaffold selection using a classic catalytic triad motif for the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate. Eighty scaffolds were identified from a scaffold library with 1,491 proteins and four scaffolds were native esterase. Furthermore, enzyme design for complicated substrates was investigated for the hydrolysis of cephalexin using scaffold selection based on two different catalytic motifs. Only three scaffolds were identified from the scaffold library by virtue of the classic catalytic triad-based motif. In contrast, 40 scaffolds were identified using a more flexible, but still preorganized catalytic motif, where one scaffold corresponded to the α-amino acid ester hydrolase that catalyzes the hydrolysis and synthesis of cephalexin. Thus, the complex active site modeling approach for de novo enzyme design with the aid of the improved ProdaMatch program is a promising approach for the creation of active sites with high catalytic efficiencies towards target reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2418376088,"This is the first in-situ study of feeding behaviors exhibited by bluntnose sixgill sharks. Bait was placed beneath the Seattle Aquarium pier situated on the waterfront in Elliott Bay, Puget Sound, Washington at 20m of water depth. Cameras and lights were placed around the bait box to record sixgill shark presence and behavior while feeding. Analysis of feeding behavior revealed that sixgills utilize a bite comparable to many other elasmobranchs and aquatic vertebrates, have the ability to protrude their upper jaw, change their feeding behavior based on the situation, and employ sawing and lateral tearing during manipulation. The versatility of their feeding mechanism and the ability of sixgills to change their capture and food manipulation behaviors may have contributed to the species' worldwide distribution and evolutionary success."
https://openalex.org/W2418836499,"In social insects, the evolutionary stability of cooperation depends on the privileged relationships between individuals of the social group, which is facilitated by the recognition of relatives. Nestmate recognition is based on genetically determined cues and/or environmentally derived chemical components present on the cuticle of individuals. Here, we studied nestmate recognition in the ant Pheidole pallidula, a species where both single-queen (monogyne) and multiple-queen (polygyne) colonies co-occur in the same population. We combined geographical, genetic and chemical analyses to disentangle the factors influencing the level of intraspecific aggressiveness. We show that encounters between workers from neighbouring colonies (i.e., nests less than 5 m away) are on average less aggressive than those between workers from more distant colonies. Aggressive behaviour is associated with the level of genetic difference: workers from monogyne colonies are more aggressive than workers from polygyne colonies, and the intensity of aggressiveness is positively associated with the genetic distance between colonies. Since the genetic distance is correlated with the spatial distance between pairs of colonies, the lower level of aggression toward neighbours may result from their higher relatedness. In contrast, the analysis of overall cuticular hydrocarbon profiles shows that aggressive behaviour is associated neither with the chemical diversity of colonies, nor with the chemical distances between them. When considering methyl-branched alkanes only, however, chemical distances differed between monogyne and polygyne colonies and were significantly associated with aggressiveness. Altogether, these results show that the social structure of colonies and the genetic distances between colonies are two major factors influencing the intensity of agonistic behaviours in the ant P. pallidula."
https://openalex.org/W2419480295,"This study aimed to evaluate the relative mRNA expression of Fas receptor (FAS), Fas ligand (FASL), and forkhead box protein 3 (FOXP3) in liver biopsy specimens obtained from patients with viral and non-viral chronic hepatitis and correlate their expression with the fibrosis stage. A total of 51 liver biopsy specimens obtained from HBV (n = 6), HCV (n = 28), and non-viral hepatic disease (NVHD) (n = 9) patients and from individuals with normal liver histology (n = 8) (control-CT) were analyzed. Quantifications of the target genes were assessed using qPCR, and liver biopsies according to the METAVIR classification. The mRNA expression levels of FAS and FASL were lower in the CT group compared to the groups of patients. The increase in the mRNA expression of FAS and FASL was correlated with higher levels of inflammation and disease progression, followed by a decline in tissues with cirrhosis, and it was also associated with increased levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Higher mRNA expression of FOXP3 was observed in the HCV and NVHD groups, with the peak observed among patients with cirrhosis. The increased FOXP3 mRNA expression was positively correlated with increased FAS and FASL mRNA expression and the AST and ALT levels in all patients.These results suggest that regardless of the cause, the course of chronic liver disease may be modulated by the analyzed genes and correlated with an increase in regulatory T cells during the liver damage followed by hepatocyte destruction by Fas/FasL system and subsequent non specific lymphocytic infiltrate accumulation."
https://openalex.org/W2419528765,"Water is a limiting factor for plant growth and vegetation dynamics in alpine sandy land of the Tibetan Plateau, especially with the increasing frequency of extreme precipitation events and drought caused by climate change. Therefore, a relatively stable water source from either deeper soil profiles or ground water is necessary for plant growth. Understanding the water use strategy of dominant species in the alpine sandy land ecosystem is important for vegetative rehabilitation and ecological restoration. The stable isotope methodology of δD, δ18O, and δ13C was used to determine main water source and long-term water use efficiency of Salix psammophila and S. cheilophila, two dominant shrubs on interdune of alpine sandy land in northeastern Tibetan Plateau. The root systems of two Salix shrubs were investigated to determine their distribution pattern. The results showed that S. psammophila and S. cheilophila absorbed soil water at different soil depths or ground water in different seasons, depending on water availability and water use strategy. Salix psammophila used ground water during the growing season and relied on shallow soil water recharged by rain in summer. Salix cheilophila used ground water in spring and summer, but relied on shallow soil water recharged by rain in spring and deep soil water recharged by ground water in fall. The two shrubs had dimorphic root systems, which is coincident with their water use strategy. Higher biomass of fine roots in S. psammophila and longer fine roots in S. cheilophila facilitated to absorb water in deeper soil layers. The long-term water use efficiency of two Salix shrubs increased during the dry season in spring. The long-term water use efficiency was higher in S. psammophila than in S. cheilophila, as the former species is better adapted to semiarid climate of alpine sandy land."
https://openalex.org/W2413759803,"The anterior hypothalamic area (AHA) is an important integrative relay structure for a variety of autonomic, endocrine, and behavioral responses including feeding behavior and response to stress. However, changes in the activity of the AHA neurons during stress and feeding in freely moving rats are not clear. The present study investigated the firing rate and burst activity of neurons in the central nucleus of the AHA (cAHA) during sucrose intake in non-stressful conditions and after acute stress in freely behaving rats. Rats were implanted with micro-electrodes into the cAHA, and extracellular multi-unit activity was recorded during 1-h access to 10% sucrose in non-stressful conditions or after acute foot shock stress. Acute stress significantly reduced sucrose intake, total sucrose lick number, and lick frequency in licking clusters, and increased inter-lick intervals. At the cluster start (CS) of sucrose licking, the cAHA neurons increased (CS-excited, 20% of the recorded neurons), decreased (CS-inhibited, 42% of the neurons) or did not change (CS-nonresponsive, 38% of the neurons) their firing rate. Stress resulted in a significant increase in the firing rate of the CS-inhibited neurons by decreasing inter-spike intervals within the burst firing of these neurons. This increase in the stress-induced firing rate of the CS-inhibited neurons was accompanied by a disruption of the correlation between the firing rate of CS-inhibited and CS-nonresponsive neurons that was observed in non-stressful conditions. Stress did not affect the firing rate of the CS-excited and CS-nonresponsive neurons. However, stress changed the pattern of burst firing of the CS-excited and CS-nonresponsive neurons by decreasing and increasing the burst number in the CS-excited and CS-nonresponsive neurons, respectively. These results suggest that the cAHA neurons integrate the signals related to stress and intake of palatable food and play a role in the stress- and eating-related circuitry."
https://openalex.org/W2417044394,"Background Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is a new pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in immune response and inflammatory disease. The main source of IL-17 is a subset of CD4+ T-helper cells, but is also secreted by non-immune cells. The present study analyzes expression of IL-17 in the time course of acute anti-thy1 glomerulonephritis and the role of IL-17 as a potential link between inflammation and fibrosis. Methods Anti-thy1 glomerulonephritis was induced into male Wistar rats by OX-7 antibody injection. After that, samples were taken on days 1, 5, 10 (matrix expansion phase), 15 and 20 (resolution phase). PBS-injected animals served as controls. Proteinuria and histological matrixes score served as the main markers for disease severity. In in vitro experiments, NRK-52E cells were used. For cytokine expressions, mRNA and protein levels were analyzed by utilizing RT-PCR, in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence. Results Highest IL-17 mRNA-expression (6.50-fold vs. con; p<0.05) was found on day 5 after induction of anti-thy1 glomerulonephritis along the maximum levels of proteinuria (113 ± 13 mg/d; p<0.001), histological glomerular-matrix accumulation (82%; p<0.001) and TGF-β1 (2.2-fold; p<0.05), IL-6 mRNA expression (36-fold; p<0.05). IL-17 protein expression co-localized with the endothelial cell marker PECAM in immunofluorescence. In NRK-52E cells, co-administration of TGF-β1 and IL-6 synergistically up-regulated IL-17 mRNA 4986-fold (p<0.001). Conclusions The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17 is up-regulated in endothelial cells during the time course of acute anti-thy1 glomerulonephritis. In vitro, NRK-52E cells secrete IL-17 under pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory conditions."

In the current West African EVD outbreak, these solutions (manufactured from calcium hypochlorite (HTH), sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC), and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl)) have been widely used in both Ebola Treatment Unit and community settings. To ensure solution quality, testing is necessary, however test method appropriateness for these Ebola-relevant concentrations has not previously been evaluated. We identified fourteen commercially-available methods to test Ebola-relevant chlorine solution concentrations, including two titration methods, four DPD dilution methods, and six test strips. We assessed these methods by: 1) determining accuracy and precision by measuring in quintuplicate five different 0.05% and 0.5% chlorine solutions manufactured from NaDCC, HTH, and NaOCl; 2) conducting volunteer testing to assess ease-of-use; and, 3) determining costs. Accuracy was greatest in titration methods (reference-12.4% error compared to reference method), then DPD dilution methods (2.4-19% error), then test strips (5.2-48% error); precision followed this same trend. Two methods had an accuracy of <10% error across all five chlorine solutions with good precision: Hach digital titration for 0.05% and 0.5% solutions (recommended for contexts with trained personnel and financial resources), and Serim test strips for 0.05% solutions (recommended for contexts where rapid, inexpensive, and low-training burden testing is needed). Measurement error from test methods not including pH adjustment varied significantly across the five chlorine solutions, which had pH values 5-11. Volunteers found test strip easiest and titration hardest; costs per 100 tests were $14-37 for test strips and $33-609 for titration. Given the ease-of-use and cost benefits of test strips, we recommend further development of test strips robust to pH variation and appropriate for Ebola-relevant chlorine solution concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2418568258,"Bacillus possesses the peptide toxin Sporulation-Delaying Protein (SDP), which can kill cells within a biofilm to support continued growth, thereby delaying the onset of biofilm sporulation. The four-component transporter YknWXYZ acts as a major SDP efflux pump to protect cells against the endogenous SDP toxin, for which YknYZ is a non-canonical ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-type transporter. YknYZ consists of the following two components: (1) an individual protein (YknY) and (2) a respective permease (YknZ). To date, the crystal structure, molecular function, and mechanism of action of the integral membrane protein YknZ remain to be elucidated. In this study, to characterize the structural and biochemical roles of YknZ in the functional assembly of YknWXYZ, we predicted and overexpressed the YknZ extracellular domain. We determined the crystal structure of B. amyloliquefaciens YknZ at a resolution of 2.0 Å. The structure revealed that the YknZ extracellular region exhibits significant structural similarity with the MacB periplasmic domain, which is a non-canonical ABC-type transporter in the tripartite macrolide-specific efflux pump in Gram-negative bacteria. We also found that the YknZ extracellular domain can directly bind to an extracellular component of YknX. This structural and biochemical study provides insights into the assembly of YknWXYZ, which may be relevant to understanding cannibalistic peptide toxin resistance in Bacillus and controlling bacterial growth."

https://openalex.org/W2411267444,"To document the biochemical and pathologic features of vitamin D intoxication in lynx and to characterize mineral metabolism in healthy lynx, blood samples were obtained from 40 captive lynx that had been receiving excessive (approximately 30 times the recommended dose) vitamin D3 in the diet, and from 29 healthy free ranging lynx. Tissue samples (kidney, stomach, lung, heart and aorta) were collected from 13 captive lynx that died as a result of renal disease and from 3 controls. Vitamin D intoxication resulted in renal failure in most lynx (n = 28), and widespread extraskeletal calcification was most severe in the kidneys and less prominent in cardiovascular tissues. Blood minerals and calciotropic hormones in healthy lynx were similar to values reported in domestic cats except for calcitriol which was higher in healthy lynx. Changes in mineral metabolism after vitamin D intoxication included hypercalcemia (12.0 ± 0.3 mg/dL), hyperphosphatemia (6.3 ± 0.4 mg/dL), increased plasma calcidiol (381.5 ± 28.2 ng/mL) and decreased plasma parathyroid hormone (1.2 ± 0.7 pg/mL). Hypercalcemia and, particularly, hyperphosphatemia were of lower magnitude that what has been previously reported in the course of vitamin D intoxication in other species. However, extraskeletal calcifications were severe. The data suggest that lynx are sensitive to excessive vitamin D and extreme care should be taken when supplementing this vitamin in captive lynx diets."

Males of the broad-nosed pipefish (Syngnathus typhle) care for the offspring by brooding embryos in a brood pouch. Brooding males can absorb nutrients that emanate from embryos, and there is often a reduction in offspring number over the brooding period. In this study, using two experimentally determined brood sizes (partially and fully filled brood pouches), we found that full broods resulted in larger number of developing offspring, despite significantly higher absolute and relative embryo mortality, compared to partial broods. Male survival was also affected by brood size, with males caring for full broods having poorer survival, an effect that together with the reduced embryo survival was found to negate the benefit of large broods. We found that embryo mortality was lower when the brooding males were in good initial condition, that embryos in broods with low embryo mortality weighed more, and surprisingly, that males in higher initial condition had embryos of lower weight. Brood size, however, did not affect embryo weight. Male final condition, but not initial condition, correlated with higher male survival. Taken together, our results show costs and benefits of caring for large brood sizes, where the numerical benefits come with costs in terms of both embryo survival and survival of the brooding father, effects that are often mediated via male condition."

Methods Cross-sectional and retrospective surveys were conducted in this study. A questionnaire and a scale were used to measure the acceptability score for physical and functional characteristics of hypothetical rectal microbicides. We also evaluated the involvement of other factors such as sexual behaviors, social context, etc. Results MSMs we interviewed showed a high acceptability to rectal microbicides, indicated by the mean acceptability score of 2.92 (SD, 0.54, scale of 1–4). The results also suggested that microbicides were preferred in a cream form that can moisten and lubricate the rectum, prevent HIV infection and go unnoticed by their partners. Multivariate analysis showed that the microbicides acceptability varied significantly by education level (β = 0.135; P = 0.028), having casual partners (β = 0.174; P = 0.007), frequency of lubricant use (β = 0.134; P = 0.031), history of HIV test (β = 0.129; P = 0.036), willingness to use lubricant (β = 0.126; P = 0.045), locus of control by partners regarding STI infection (β = 0.168; P = 0.009). Conclusions A positive response to rectal microbicides among MSMs was found in our study, suggesting that rectal microbicides might have a potential market in MSMs and they might play an important role in HIV/STIs prevention as a supplement. Further studies may be considered to combine the acceptability study with clinical research together to understand the true feelings of MSMs when they use the products."
https://openalex.org/W2410543334,"The purposes of this study were to optimize a proton computed tomography system (pCT) for proton range verification and to confirm the pCT image reconstruction algorithm based on projection images generated with optimized parameters. For this purpose, we developed a new pCT scanner using the Geometry and Tracking (GEANT) 4.9.6 simulation toolkit. GEANT4 simulations were performed to optimize the geometric parameters representing the detector thickness and the distance between the detectors for pCT. The system consisted of four silicon strip detectors for particle tracking and a calorimeter to measure the residual energies of the individual protons. The optimized pCT system design was then adjusted to ensure that the solution to a CS-based convex optimization problem would converge to yield the desired pCT images after a reasonable number of iterative corrections. In particular, we used a total variation-based formulation that has been useful in exploiting prior knowledge about the minimal variations of proton attenuation characteristics in the human body. Examinations performed using our CS algorithm showed that high-quality pCT images could be reconstructed using sets of 72 projections within 20 iterations and without any streaks or noise, which can be caused by under-sampling and proton starvation. Moreover, the images yielded by this CS algorithm were found to be of higher quality than those obtained using other reconstruction algorithms. The optimized pCT scanner system demonstrated the potential to perform high-quality pCT during on-line image-guided proton therapy, without increasing the imaging dose, by applying our CS based proton CT reconstruction algorithm. Further, we make our optimized detector system and CS-based proton CT reconstruction algorithm potentially useful in on-line proton therapy."
