https://openalex.org/W1583068153,"In vertebrates, symmetricversus asymmetric cleavage of β-carotene in the biosynthesis of vitamin A and its derivatives has been controversially discussed. Recently we have been able to identify a cDNA encoding a metazoan β,β-carotene-15,15′-dioxygenase from the fruit flyDrosophila melanogaster. This enzyme catalyzes the key step in vitamin A biosynthesis, symmetrically cleaving β-carotene to give two molecules of retinal. Mutations in the corresponding gene are known to lead to a blind, vitamin A-deficient phenotype. Orthologs of this enzyme have very recently been found also in vertebrates and molecularly characterized. Here we report the identification of a cDNA from mouse encoding a second type of carotene dioxygenase catalyzing exclusively the asymmetric oxidative cleavage of β-carotene at the 9′,10′ double bond of β-carotene and resulting in the formation of β-apo-10′-carotenal and β-ionone, a substance known as a floral scent from roses, for example. Besides β-carotene, lycopene is also oxidatively cleaved by the enzyme. The deduced amino acid sequence shares significant sequence identity with the β,β-carotene-15,15′-dioxygenases, and the two enzyme types have several conserved motifs. To establish its occurrence in different vertebrates, we then attempted and succeeded in cloning cDNAs encoding this new type of carotene dioxygenase from human and zebrafish as well. As regards their possible role, the apocarotenals formed by this enzyme may be the precursors for the biosynthesis of retinoic acid or exert unknown physiological effects. Thus, in contrast toDrosophila, in vertebrates both symmetric and asymmetric cleavage pathways exist for carotenes, revealing a greater complexity of carotene metabolism."

The precise function of MUC1 overexpression in tumorigenesis is unknown, although various domains of MUC1 have been implicated in cell adhesion, cell signaling, and immunoregulation. Stimulation of the MDA-MB-468 breast cancer line as well as mouse mammary glands with epidermal growth factor results in the co-immunoprecipitation of MUC1 with a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of ∼180 kDa. We have generated transgenic lines overexpressing full-length (MMF), cytoplasmic tail deleted (ΔCT), or tandem repeat deleted (ΔTR)-human MUC1 under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus promoter to further examine the role of MUC1 in signaling and tumorigenesis. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that full-length transgenic MUC1 physically associates with all four erbB receptors, and co-localizes with erbB1 in the lactating gland. Furthermore, we detected a sharp increase in ERK1/2 activation in MUC1 transgenic mammary glands compared with Muc1 null and wild-type animals. These results point to a novel function of increased MUC1 expression, potentiation of erbB signaling through the activation of mitogenic MAP kinase pathways.

The transmembrane mucin MUC1 (DF3, CD227, episialin, PEM) is a heavily O-glycosylated protein expressed on most secretory epithelium, including the mammary gland as well as some hematopoetic cells. MUC1 is expressed abundantly in the lactating mammary gland in addition to being overexpressed in greater than 90% of human breast carcinomas and metastases (1Zotter S. Hageman P.C. Lossnitzer A. Mooi W.J. Hilgers J. Cancer Rev. 1988; 11–12: 55-101Google Scholar). In the normal mammary gland, MUC1 is expressed mainly on the apical surface of glandular epithelium and is believed to play a role in anti-adhesion and immune protection (2Hilkens J. Vos H.L.

Mice lacking Muc1 demonstrate no overt phenotypic developmental abnormalities in the mammary gland, but when crossed with the tumorigenic MMTV 1The abbreviations used are:MMTV mouse mammary turmor virusEGFR, epidermal growth factor receptorTRtamdem repeatCTcytoplasmic tailPCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenHRPhorseradish peroxidasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisGSTglutathione S-transferaseMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseERCTEGFR cytoplasmic tailMMFMMTV-MUC1FLA6NRGneuregulin-mTag transgenic line (5Guy C.T.

Additionally, these Muc1-null/MMTV-mTag transgenics demonstrated a trend toward decreased metastasis, showing that the absence of Muc1 results in both reduced tumor growth and spread (6Spicer A.P. Rowse G.J. Lidner T.K. Gendler S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30093-30101Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar).MUC1 is transcribed as a large precursor gene product, which, upon translation, is cleaved in the endoplasmic reticulum, yielding two separate proteins that form a heterodimeric complex, bound together by noncovalent interactions (7Ligtenberg M.J.L.

The larger of the two components (the “mucin-like” subunit) contains most of the extracellular domain, including the signal sequence, tandem repeats, as well as some degenerate repeats. The tandem repeats consist of 30 to 90 repeat sequences of 20 amino acids, rich in serine and threonine residues. Approximately 50–90% of the mass of MUC1 is derived fromO-glycosylation that occurs on these amino acids (8Gendler S.J. Lancaster C.A. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. Duhig T. Peat N. Burchell J. Pemberton L. Lalani E.N. Wilson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15286-15293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The second component of the heterodimer consists of an extracellular stem (where the two protein products are joined), the hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a short, 72-amino acid cytoplasmic domain. The cytoplasmic domain contains potential docking sites for Src homology domain 2 containing proteins, as well as a variety of putative kinase recognition sites and is tyrosine-phosphorylatedin vitro (9Zrihan-Licht S. Baruch A. Elroy-Stein O. Keydar I. Wreschner D.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 10Spicer A.P. Duhig T. Chilton B.S. Gendler S.J. Mamm. Genome. 1995; 6: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). There are 7 tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail, which are highly conserved across species (10Spicer A.P. Duhig T. Chilton B.S. Gendler S.J. Mamm. Genome. 1995; 6: 885-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).MUC1 interacts with a number of proteins implicated in neoplasia through both its tandem repeat and cytoplasmic domains. The tandem repeat region can act as a ligand for intercellular adhesion molecule 1 on human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers, indicating a potential role in metastatic intravasation (11Regimbald L.H. Pilarski L.M. Longenecker B.M. Reddish M.A. Zimmermann G. Hugh J.C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4244-4249PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kam J.L. Regimbald L.H. Hilgers J.H. Hoffman P. Krantz M.J. Longenecker B.M. Hugh J.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5577-5581PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, MUC1 binds β-catenin and GSK3β, through motifs in the cytoplasmic tail similar to those found in the adenomatous polyposis coli protein, leading to a reduction in the binding of β-catenin to E-cadherin in ZR-75-1 breast carcinoma cells (13Li Y. Bharti A. Chen D. Gong J. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7216-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 14Yamamoto M. Bharti A. Li Y. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12492-12494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). This could potentially subvert E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion in epithelial cells, promoting cell migration (13Li Y. Bharti A. Chen D. Gong J. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7216-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Additionally, studies in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells demonstrated that upon phosphorylation, MUC1 can bind Grb2/SOS (15Pandey P. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4000-4003PubMed Google Scholar), signaling mediators of a number of receptor tyrosine kinases.One family of transmembrane tyrosine kinases, erbB receptors (including erbB1 or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), erbB2, erbB3, and erbB 4) are expressed dynamically during mammary gland development (16Schroeder J.A. Lee D.C. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 451-464PubMed Google Scholar) and are commonly implicated in breast cancer initiation and progression in both humans and rodents (17Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Schroeder J.A. Lee D.C. J. Mamm. Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1997; 2: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Overexpression of either the receptors or ligands in this family generally occurs in advanced, metastatic disease, resulting in poor overall patient outcomes (17Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ligands of the epidermal growth factor family (including EGF-like members and neuregulin family members) induce dimerization of these receptors, leading to the activation of a variety of effector proteins including Src, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Shc, phospholipase Cγ, STAT, Grb2/SOS, and others (19Alroy I. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 20Carpenter G.

Chem. 1999; 274: 17209-17218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The activation of many of these proteins results in the phosphorylation of nuclear translocating kinases, including SAPK/JNK and the MAP kinases, p38 and ERK1/2 (23Pinkas-Kramarski R. Soussan L. Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Klapper L. Lavi S. Seger R. Ratzkin B.J. Sela M. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2452-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 24Amundadottir L.T. Leder P.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3440-3451Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). One mechanism of MAP kinase activation is through the recruitment of the Grb2·SOS complex to the phosphorylated receptor, resulting in Ras activation and phosphorylation of Raf, MEK, and ERK1/2. Upon activation, ERK1/2 can translocate to the nucleus and induce transcription of a variety of genes involved in mitogenesis, differentiation, apoptosis, and quiescence (17Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Alroy I. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 26Campbell S.L.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar).To explore signaling roles of MUC1 in the mammary gland, we have generated a number of transgenic animals overexpressing full-length and deletion constructs of human MUC1 in the mouse mammary gland using the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter. We have demonstrated that treatment with exogenous betacellulin, in addition to other EGFR ligands, can induce tyrosine phosphorylation of MUC1 in culture. Immunoprecipitation and co-localization experiments have revealed a physical interaction between MUC1 and EGFR that occurs through the cytoplasmic tail of MUC1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that EGF-dependent activation of ERK1/2 MAPK is strongly induced in the presence of high levels of MUC1 in the mouse mammary gland.DISCUSSIONIn an effort to recapitulate the overexpression of MUC1 observed in human breast cancer, we have generated transgenic animals that overexpress both full-length and domain-deleted human MUC1 in the mouse mammary gland. The mammary glands of these transgenics appear developmentally and functionally normal, and transgene expression is localized to the apical border of both ducts and alveoli of the mammary gland. We have demonstrated that MUC1 co-localizes with and physically interacts with members of the erbB receptor kinase family. Finally, we have demonstrated a strong activation of dual-phosphorylated p42/44 ERK in the presence of transgenic, full-length MUC1 in the lactating mammary gland.The interaction between transmembrane mucins and members of the erbB family has been demonstrated previously. Caraway et al. (34Carraway 3rd, K.L. Rossi E.A. Komatsu M. Price-Schiavi S.A. Huang D. Guy P.M. Carvajal M.E. Fregien N. Carraway C.A. Carraway K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5263-5266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) demonstrated a co-immunoprecipitation between erbB2 and MUC4 (ASGP1 and -2) in both the metastatic ascites 13762 rat mammary carcinoma cell line as well the pregnant rat. Unlike MUC1 and EGFR, this interaction occurs in the extracellular domain of the proteins. Furthermore, increased proliferation rates and a potentiation of NRG signaling correlates with MUC4 expression. Interestingly, they have recently shown that regulation of MUC4 expression is dependent upon activation of the ERK pathway in 13762 cells (35Zhu X. Price-Schiavi S.A. Carraway K.L. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4354-4361Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). MUC4 is also a transmembrane member of the mucin family, with a processed protein core that is heavily O-glycosylated, similar to MUC1 (36Carraway K.L. Price-Schiavi S.A. Komatsu M. Idris N. Perez A. Li P. Jepson S. Zhu X. Carvajal M.E. Carraway C.A. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: D95-D107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike MUC1, MUC4 contains EGF-like repeats in the extracellular portion of its membrane-spanning domain, which appear to be responsible for its interactions with erbB2. While MUC4 appears to interact only with erbB2, MUC1-erbB associations appear to be much more permissive, although modulation of Grb2/SOS interactions with the erbBs is restricted only to EGFR (see below). Interestingly, ligand-independent activation of EGFR and subsequent downstream MAPK activation has been recently described by Pece and Gutkind (37Pece S. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41227-41233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) through interactions with E-cadherin. This is further evidence that the activity of erbB family of transmembrane receptors can be modulated by unique mechanisms in addition to activation by cognate ligands.It is important to note that while MUC1 could be detected in erbB immunoprecipitations by a variety of MUC1 antibodies, the erbB receptors could not be identified in MUC1 immunoprecipitations. This may be due to the extremely high levels of MUC1 being expressed and released into the alveolar lumen compared with the relatively modest levels of the erbB receptors present in the apical epithelium. Proportionately, only a very small fraction of the total MUC1 being expressed may be complexing with the erbB receptors while the opposite may be true for the erbBs at that cellular location. Additionally, as the pp180 that is identified in immunoprecipitates appears to be multiple bands of the approximate same size (Fig. 2D), it is possible that the phosphotyrosine immunoblot is in fact detecting all four erbB receptors complexing with MUC1. If this is the case, the detection of a single erbB from the complex becomes increasingly difficult.Pandey et al. (15Pandey P. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4000-4003PubMed Google Scholar) report interactions between MUC1 (DF3) and Grb2/SOS in MCF7 breast carcinoma cell lines through the Src homology domain 2 domain of Grb2, although no downstream signaling was reported. We were able to observe MUC1 directly interacting with Grb2 and SOS in mammary glands from both the full-length and tandem repeat-deleted MUC1 transgenic. As MUC1 has no intrinsic kinase domain, a possible interpretation of these data is that EGFR phosphorylation of MUC1 allows recruitment of Grb2 into a complex that includes both EGFR and MUC1. Preliminary experiments have shown a significant increase in EGFR binding to SOS in the presence of full-length MUC1, but not the cytoplasmic tail-deleted transgenic mammary glands. Interestingly, when the remaining erbB receptors were examined for changes in SOS-binding, no modulation was observed in relation to the presence or absence of MUC1, indicating a specific relation between EGFR and MUC1. The presence of MUC1 in immunoprecipitations of erbB2, erbB3, and erbB4 is likely due to heterodimerization complexes between the four erbB receptors and MUC1. It has been previously demonstrated that all erbB receptors are capable of being transphosphorylated by EGF in the lactating mammary gland, indicating that these complexes do form during this stage of development (16Schroeder J.A. Lee D.C. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 451-464PubMed Google Scholar).EGFR and MUC1 have previously been localized in the mammary epithelium in the pregnant and lactating mammary gland, MUC1 to the apical side and EGFR throughout the cell. We have co-localized EGFR and MUC1 mainly to apical-lateral regions between cells, leading us to ask if these proteins may be interacting at tight junctions. To investigate this observation, we stained sections for MUC1 and ZO-1 (zona occludens 1), a cytoplasmic protein found in the tight junctions of polarized epithelial cells (38Denker B.M. Nigam S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments, we observed co-localization of these two proteins at the apical-lateral region of the epithelium of lactating epithelium through confocal microscopy, indicating that MUC1 is indeed found at the tight junctions, and is not merely an apically localized protein. Interestingly, Chen et al. (39Chen Y. Lu Q. Schneeberger E.E. Goodenough D.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 849-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that increased MAPK activity negatively regulates tight junction formation. As MUC1 overexpression (as is seen in the neoplastic state as well as these transgenics) increases MAPK activity and decreases cellular adhesion in vitro (2Hilkens J. Vos H.L. Wesseling J. Boer M. Storm J. van der Valk S. Calafat J. Patriarca C. Cancer Lett. 1995; 90: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 3Wesseling J. van der Valk S.W. Vos H.L. Sonnenberg A. Hilkens J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), we might speculate a role for normal (wild-type expression levels) MUC1/EGFR signaling in the preservation of the tight junction complex.There are numerous potential consequences for activation of the p42/p44 MAP kinase proteins including induction of proliferation, quiescence, apoptosis, and differentiation (40Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1845) Google Scholar, 41Woods D. Parry D. Cherwinski H. Bosch E. Lees E. McMahon M. Mol. Cell.

We have investigated levels of PCNA in transgenic animals, and found no increase that would correlate to increased mitogenesis. Alternately, we have examined the possibility of driving the cells into a state of Go arrest by activating p21. This would potentially provide a population of cells that do not apoptose in response to the postlactational stimuli, and remain in the gland as potential targets of transformation (26Campbell S.L.

While we have been unable to detect increased levels of p21 in preliminary experiments, we have observed a trend toward delayed regression in the postapoptotic glands of some MMF transgenic animals (data not shown). These possibilities are being explored in subsequent experiments.It is tempting to speculate that the modulation of EGFR signaling and MAP kinase activation are a component of the mechanism of MUC1-associated tumorigenesis. While aberrant MUC1 expression has been linked with a high percentage of breast carcinomas, the role of this overexpression is undefined. This novel data points to a potential mechanism, that of potentiating the signaling of the tyrosine kinase receptor EGFR, a protein whose increased expression is correlated to aggressive breast cancer (46Lundy J. Schuss A. Stanick D. McCormack E.S. Kramer S. Sorvillo J.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 1527-1534PubMed Google Scholar, 47Fabian C.J. Kamel S. Zalles C. Kimler B.F. J. Cell.

MUC1 interacts with a number of proteins implicated in neoplasia through both its tandem repeat and cytoplasmic domains. The tandem repeat region can act as a ligand for intercellular adhesion molecule 1 on human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers, indicating a potential role in metastatic intravasation (11Regimbald L.H.

Longenecker B.M. Hugh J.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5577-5581PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, MUC1 binds β-catenin and GSK3β, through motifs in the cytoplasmic tail similar to those found in the adenomatous polyposis coli protein, leading to a reduction in the binding of β-catenin to E-cadherin in ZR-75-1 breast carcinoma cells (13Li Y.

This could potentially subvert E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion in epithelial cells, promoting cell migration (13Li Y. Bharti A. Chen D. Gong J. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7216-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Additionally, studies in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells demonstrated that upon phosphorylation, MUC1 can bind Grb2/SOS (15Pandey P. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4000-4003PubMed Google Scholar), signaling mediators of a number of receptor tyrosine kinases. One family of transmembrane tyrosine kinases, erbB receptors (including erbB1 or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), erbB2, erbB3, and erbB 4) are expressed dynamically during mammary gland development (16Schroeder J.A. Lee D.C. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 451-464PubMed Google Scholar) and are commonly implicated in breast cancer initiation and progression in both humans and rodents (17Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M.

Overexpression of either the receptors or ligands in this family generally occurs in advanced, metastatic disease, resulting in poor overall patient outcomes (17Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ligands of the epidermal growth factor family (including EGF-like members and neuregulin family members) induce dimerization of these receptors, leading to the activation of a variety of effector proteins including Src, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Shc, phospholipase Cγ, STAT, Grb2/SOS, and others (19Alroy I.

https://openalex.org/W2000976163,"Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a peptide hormone with potent vasoconstrictor properties which is synthesized and secreted predominantly by vascular endothelial cells. Its production is regulated by numerous stimuli including ischemia and hypoxia, and the enhanced levels that occur during myocardial ischemia may contribute to the progression of heart failure. We reported previously a preliminary characterization of a hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) binding site in the human ET-1 promoter which contributed to the activation of ET-1 expression in endothelial cells. We report here that the HIF-1 binding site alone is not sufficient for the response to hypoxia but requires an additional 50 base pairs of flanking sequence that includes binding sites for the factors activator protein-1 (AP-1), GATA-2, and CAAT-binding factor (NF-1). Mutation of any one of these sites or the HIF-1 site eliminated induction by hypoxia. Mutations of the AP-1 and GATA-2 sites, but not the HIF-1 site, were complemented by overexpressing AP-1, GATA-2, HIF-1α, or the activator protein p300/CBP, restoring the response to hypoxia. Binding studies in vitro confirmed physical associations among GATA-2, AP-1, and HIF-1 factors. Overexpression or depletion of p300/CBP modulated the level of ET-1 promoter expression as well as the endogenous ET-1 transcript but did not change the fold induction by hypoxia in either case. Regulation of the ET-1 promoter by hypoxia in non-endothelial cells required overexpression of GATA-2 and HIF-1α. The results support essential roles for AP-1, GATA-2, and NF-1 in stabilizing the binding of HIF-1 and promoting recruitment of p300/CBP to the ET-1 hypoxia response complex.

It is a member of a family of structurally related peptide hormones and is the most potent endogenously produced vasoconstrictor known (for review, see Ref. 1Rubanyi G.M. Polokoff M.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 325-415PubMed Google Scholar). The enhanced secretion of ET-1 during myocardial ischemia has been linked with enhanced contractility in the failing heart (2Sakai S. Miyauchi T. Sakurai T. Kasuya Y. Ihara M. Yamaguchi I. Goto K. Sugishita Y. Circulation. 1996; 93: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) as well as with the progression of heart failure (3Sakai S. Miyauchi T. Kobayashi M. Yamaguchi I. Goto K. Sugishita Y. Nature. 1996; 384: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The combined actions of ET-1 and the endothelial cell relaxing factor nitric oxide may be important in regulating vascular tone and blood pressure (1Rubanyi G.M. Polokoff M.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 325-415PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its vasomodulating activity, ET-1 has been shown to modulate multiple cell functions including proliferation, proto-oncogene and protein kinase activity (1Rubanyi G.M. Polokoff M.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 325-415PubMed Google Scholar), induction of inotropy and hypertrophy in cardiac muscle, and activation of cardiac specific genes (4Hu J.R. Von Harsdorf R.

At least two cell surface receptors for the endothelins are present on multiple cell types, and most of the actions of the peptides are probably relayed through these receptors (for review, see Ref. 6Sokolovsky M.

Chem. 1989; 264: 14954-14959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The promoter region contains activator protein-1 (AP-1), GATA-2, nuclear factor-1 (NF-1), and acute phase regulatory element sites upstream from classical CAAT and TATAA boxes. The AP-1 sites have been shown to mediate transcriptional induction by Fos and Jun proteins (22Lee M.-E. Dhadly M.S. Temizer D.H. Clifford J.A. Yoshizumi M. Quertermous T. J. Biol.

Clifford J.A. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10446-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the 5′-elements, the ET-1 gene also contains two AUUUA sequences in the 3′-untranslated region which probably determine the short (15–20 min) half-life of the ET-1 message and its induction by protein synthesis inhibitors (21Inoue A. Yanagisawa M. Takuwa Y. Mitsui Y. Kobayashi M. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14954-14959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hypoxia is one of the most potent inducers of ET-1 gene expression in endothelial cells and may be the primary cause of the increased production of ET-1 during myocardial ischemia (24Watanabe T. Suzuki N. Shimamoto N. Fujino M. Imada A. Nature. 1990; 334: 114Crossref Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 25Winkles J.A. Alberts G.F. Brogi E. Libby P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Hypoxia induces the synthesis and secretion of ET-1 in isolated endothelial cells by a mechanism that is antagonized by nitric oxide and carbon monoxide and mimicked by transition metals (15Kourembanas S. McQuillan L.P. Leung G.K. Faller D.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 16Hieda H.S. Gomez-Sanchez C.E.

Invest. 1991; 88: 1054-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). The ET-1 promoter contains an inverted hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) binding site at position −118 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site which binds the factors HIF-1α and ARNT (HIF-1β) and is essential for the promoter response to hypoxia (20Minchenko A. Caro J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 208: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 28Hu J. Discher D.J. Bishopric N.H. Webster K.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 894-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Here we report that this response also requires three adjacent transcription factor binding sites to form a functional hypoxia-responsive complex. The response is endothelial cell-specific and is modulated but not necessarily dependent on interactions with the activator protein p300/CBP. Human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVECs) were prepared from the umbilical cords of multiple donors as described previously (28Hu J. Discher D.J. Bishopric N.H. Webster K.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 894-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Briefly, umbilical cord veins were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and filled with 0.1% collagenase in phosphate-buffered saline containing Ca2+and Mg2+. After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, gentle flushing of the vein released a suspension of isolated cells. These were seeded onto gelatin-coated culture dishes, and the adherent ECs were cultured in M199 medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, l-glutamine, and 10% human serum. In some experiments HUVECs were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) and cultured as described previously (19Bodi I. Bishopric N.H. Discher D.J. Wu X. Webster K.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 1995; 30: 975-984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa, HepG2, and human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells were also cultured as described previously (29Webster K.A. Muscat G.E.O. Kedes L. Nature. 1988; 332: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Our conditions for hypoxic incubations have been described in detail previously (19Bodi I. Bishopric N.H. Discher D.J. Wu X.

Briefly, cells were incubated in a temperature- and humidity-controlled environmental chamber in an atmosphere containing 0.5% O2, 5% CO2, balance N2. Oxygen tension inside the chamber was monitored continuously with an oxygen-sensitive electrode (Kathaerobe Controls, Philadelphia). All cell manipulations including media changes and harvesting took place under hypoxia to avoid transitory reoxygenation. ET-1 promoter deletions have been described previously (13Oliver F.J.

Discher D.J. Bishopric N.H. Webster K.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 894-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Mutations of the AP-1, GATA-2, and NF-1 binding sites in the −176 truncations were introduced by the same polymerase chain reaction-based procedures. The primers were GATA-2: 5′-CCGACTCCGGCTGCACGTTGCCTGTTGGTGACTAATA AC-3′; AP-1: 5′-GACACCTAATAACACAATAACATTGTCTGGGGCTGG-3′, with the appropriate opposite strand primers; and NF1: 5′-AACAACATTGTCTGGGGCTGGAAT3-′ and 5′-ACCTTATTAGTCACCAACAGGCAACGT-3′. These reactions replaced the bases TTAT, GTGA, and CAAT in the consensus GATA-2, AP-1, and NF-1 sites with CCGA, ACAC, and TACC, respectively. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Other vectors used in transfection and infection analyses including E1A clones, p300, pGL3HREEpo, pRSV-luciferase, pEnoHRE, and adenoviral vectors expressing E1A have been described previously (32Bishopric N.H.

Spacer DNA sequences containing 50 base pairs were inserted in between GATA-2 and HIF-1, and HIF-1 and AP-1, respectively, by polymerase chain reaction-based insertional mutagenesis using the same methods described above for site directed mutagenesis with the foreign sequence overhanging 5′- and 3′-primers of 36 and 30 base pairs each complementary to the respective site for insertion. The sequence of the inserted DNA was 5′-ATGCTAGGCGTCATGAGTACGAGGTCGGAGCTACGTACTGCCGTTGTACG-3′. All new constructs were confirmed by sequencing. RNA transcript levels were measured by Northern blots as described previously (19Bodi I. Bishopric N.H. Discher D.J. Wu X. Webster K.A. Cardiovasc.

Briefly, total RNA was isolated by solubilizing cells on the plate in 4 mguanidinium thiocyanate (0.25 ml/106 cells) and pelleting through cesium chloride. Agarose gels, blotting, and hybridizations were all as described previously (19Bodi I. Bishopric N.H. Discher D.J. Wu X. Webster K.A. Cardiovasc.

Nature. 1988; 332: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) were labeled by random priming (Prime-It kit, Stratagene) to 108cpm/μg DNA. RNA bands on the autoradiographs were quantitated using a UMAX Powerlook II scanner, Power Macintosh 8500/150, and Adobe software. RNA loading on gels was monitored by ethidium staining and by probing with β-actin as the control. HUVEC, HeLa, HepG2, and HEK-293 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method as described previously (19Bodi I. Bishopric N.H. Discher D.J. Wu X. Webster K.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 1995; 30: 975-984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HUVECs were transfected at 80% confluence; other cell lines were transfected at 30–40% confluence; cells were exposed to 0.5 ml of calcium phosphate precipitate containing 8–10 μg of plasmid DNA including an internal control (Renilla luciferase from PromegaBiotechnology) for 8–12 h. Transfected cultures were exposed to hypoxia after a further 24–48 h. Expression of luciferase activity, normalized to the internal control, was determined as described previously (19Bodi I. Bishopric N.H. Discher D.J. Wu X. Webster K.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 1995; 30: 975-984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from confluent plates of HUVECs, C2C12 myoblasts, or HeLa cells grown under a normal aerobic environment, treated with 100 μmCoCl2, or exposed to hypoxia as described previously (19Bodi I.

Site mutations within the ET-1HRE(WT) oligonucleotide were the same as those described for the ET-1HIF-1(M) oligonucleotide. Gel-purified double-stranded oligonucleotides were end labeled with [32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products). Equal amounts of radioactive probe (1.5–2.5 × 104cpm) were added to binding reactions that contained 8 μg of nuclear extract protein in 20 μl of a buffer containing 4 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 12 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 30 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Antibodies against c-Jun, GATA-2, Sp1, c-Fos, and p300 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-HIF-1α antibody was from Lab Vision Corp. (Freemont, CA). Reactions were incubated for 15 min at 22 °C before separating on nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels at 4 °C (34Wu X. Bishopric N.H. Discher D.J. Murphy B.J. Webster K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1035-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Full-length cDNAs were obtained encoding c-Jun, c-Fos (both generous gifts of Tom Curran, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis), GATA-1 and GATA-2 (generous gifts from S. Orkin, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston) HIF-1α (generous gift from F. Bunn, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston MA), HIF-1β (ARNT) (generous gift from Darren Richard, Institute of Signaling, Developmental Biology and Cancer Research, CNRS, Nice Cedux 2, France). All cDNAs were subcloned into pBlueScript SK(−) by standard cloning procedures. The corresponding proteins were transcribed and translated in vitro using rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega). Double-stranded probes biotinylated at the 5′-ends were from Life Technologies, Inc. These included the wild type ET-1 HRE described above and individual mutations in the wild type sequence including GATA-2(M): TTAT to CCGA; HIF-1(M): CGT to TAC; and AP-1(M): GTGA to ACAC. Probes were also synthesized containing double mutations of AP-1 and GATA-2, and triple mutation of all three sites. The probes were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and equal amounts of complementary strands were annealed. Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin (Dynal, Inc., Lake Success, NY) were prepared by washing three times in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and two times with Tris-EDTA containing 1m NaCl. Between each wash, beads were pulled down with a Dynal magnetic particle concentrator. Double-stranded, biotinylated oligonucleotides were added to the washed beads, and the mix was rotated for 20–30 min at 21 °C. Equal cpm of proteins translatedin vitro were made to 1 × with binding buffer and mixed with ∼100 μg of Dynabeads containing 10 pmol of the individual oligonucleotide probe in a final volume of 250 μl. The mixture was rotated at room temperature for 20 min, and proteins bound to the beads were separated from unbound proteins by successive washes, three times with 0.5 × binding buffer and once with 1 × binding buffer. Higher stringency wash included two washes with 2 × binding buffer. Beads and bound proteins were pulled down with a magnetic concentrator, suspended in 1 × sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (10%) as described for immunoprecipitation reactions. The same procedures were used to pull down p300 from nuclear extracts. In this case the protein eluted from the beads was electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Blots were stained with Ponceau Red to monitor the transfer of proteins. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% nonfat milk in TBS (25 mmTris, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl) containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with anti-p300 antibody for 2–4 h in the same buffer. After washing, the blots were incubated for 1 h with a 1:7,500 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Fig.1 A shows the sequence of the HRE in the ET-1 promoter between base pairs −91 and −142 upstream of the transcription start site, including the positions of transcription factor binding sites. The base changes shown were introduced individually and in pairs into pET1−176-Luc as described under “Materials and Methods.” The expression of the wild type promoter and each mutation in endothelial cells cultured under aerobic or hypoxic conditions is shown in Fig. 1 A. The AP-1 and GATA-2 mutations reduced basal expression to < 20% of the wild type. In agreement with previous reports expression of the wild type promoter was induced by 2.3-fold (± 0.3, n = 12;p < 0.001) under hypoxia (28Hu J. Discher D.J. Bishopric N.H. Webster K.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 894-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). This response was eliminated in all constructs containing site mutations. Therefore activation of the ET-1 promoter by hypoxia in ECs requires intact GATA-2, HIF-1, AP-1, and NF-1 binding sites. It was reported previously that the decreased basal expression of AP-1 and GATA-2 site mutations in the ET-1 promoter were complemented by overexpressing the corresponding factor (23Lee M.-E. Bloch K.D. Clifford J.A. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10446-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test for complementation of the response to hypoxia, wild type and mutated promoter constructs were cotransfected with HIF-1α, c-Jun, or GATA-2 expression vectors. These results are shown in Fig. 1 B. Expression of the wild type promoter was augmented by c-Jun (1.3-fold) and GATA-2 (2.3-fold) cotransfections but not by HIF-1α, (allp < 0.02; n = 4). The fold activation of the wild type promoter by hypoxia was not significantly effected in either case. Expression of the HIF-1 site mutation was not significantly affected by cotransfection of c-Jun, GATA-2, or HIF-1α, and there was no hypoxia-mediated induction of this construct under any condition. The basal expression of the AP-1 and GATA-2 site mutations was fully complemented by either c-Jun or GATA-2 cotransfection, in agreement with a previous report (23Lee M.-E. Bloch K.D. Clifford J.A. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10446-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the response to hypoxia was fully restored to both mutations by cotransfection of c-Jun, GATA-2, or HIF-1α. Cotransfection of cDNA encoding Sp1 did not restore the hypoxia response of these mutations (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the HIF-1α binding site is essential but not sufficient for activation of the ET-1 promoter by hypoxia. Homologous complementation of the AP-1 and GATA-2 site mutations and cross-complementation by the heterologous factors suggest that each of these factors can be recruited to the HIF-1 complex without directly binding DNA. Complementation of either AP-1 or GATA-2 site mutations by HIF-1α further suggests that these sites may modulate the DNA binding affinity of HIF-1α (see “Discussion”). Gel mobility shift assays were carried out to determine whether hypoxia changed the binding activities of the HIF-1 site flanking proteins. As shown in Fig. 2, shifts corresponding to the binding of AP-1, GATA-2, and HIF-1 complexes were observed, confirming previous reports from this and other laboratories (23Lee M.-E. Bloch K.D. Clifford J.A. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10446-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Hu J. Discher D.J. Bishopric N.H. Webster K.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 894-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Thearrows in the upper panels indicate the positions of specific AP-1-, GATA-2-, and HIF-1-shifted bands, respectively. Using individual site sequences or the whole ET-1 HRE as the probe, hypoxia did not effect the apparent abundance or binding activity of either AP-1 or GATA-2. This is in contrast to some other cell types where AP-1 binding is strongly activated by hypoxia (36Millhorn D.E. Raymond R. Conforti L. Zhu W. Beltner-Johnson D. Filisko T. Genter M.B. Kobayashi S. Peng M. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 527-535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In thetop right panel, extracts from normoxic or hypoxic EC or HeLa cells were reacted with the ET-1 HIF-1 probe (firstthrough fourth and seventh and eighth lanes) or with a probe containing the erythropoietin (Epo)-HIF-1α consensus (fifth, sixth, andninth lanes). The ET-1-specific HIF-1 probe generated markedly weaker interactions than the corresponding Epo-HIF-1 probe (compare second, fourth, and sixth lanes), suggesting that the ET-1 site is a low affinity HIF-1 binding site. Binding studies with a probe containing the complete ET-1 HRE-region (−91 to −141) are shown in the lower panels. Shifts representing AP-1 and HIF-1 were confirmed by supershifts with specific antibodies (left panel, fourth andsixth lanes). A weak supershift was observed with an antibody directed against p300/CBP (fifth lane), confirming the presence of p300 in these complexes. The third arrow on the left indicates the probable position of the GATA-2 band shift; this band was always weak, and the anti-GATA-2 antibody did not generate a supershift (not shown). Mutation of the GATA-2 site in the ET-1-HRE probe (lower right panel) did not affect the binding of AP-1 or HIF-1 factors. Therefore, a functionally disruptive mutation (that prevented the promoter activation by hypoxia) did not disrupt HIF-1 binding in vitro. Interestingly, the supershift caused by the anti-c-Jun antibody also eliminated the HIF-1-specific band (both bottom panels). These results show that the ET-1 HRE binds the HIF-1 complex weakly, the binding of AP-1 GATA-2 is not affected by hypoxia, and there is no evidence for cooperative binding in vitro. A biotinylated DNA pull-down assay was used to analyze protein-protein interactions in the ET-1 HRE complex. This technique was used"

We have previously identified a 135-kDa molecule (CD9P-1) as a major molecular partner of CD9 in cancer cell lines. This molecule was identified, after immunoaffinity purification and mass spectrometry analysis, as the protein encoded by theKIAA1436 gene and the human ortholog of a rat protein known as FPRP. Cross-linking experiments detected a complex of the size of CD9 plus CD9P-1, showing that these glycoproteins directly associate with each other, probably in the absence of any other molecule. The use of chimeric CD9/CD82 molecules revealed the role of the second half of CD9, comprising the large extracellular loop and the fourth transmembrane domain. CD9P-1 was also shown to form separate complexes with CD81 and with an unidentified 175-kDa molecule. It also associated with other tetraspanins under conditions maintaining tetraspanin/tetraspanin interactions. The identification of a protein strongly linked to the tetraspanin web and the production of a specific monoclonal antibody will help to further characterize the role of this “web” under physiological and pathological conditions.

The identification of a protein strongly linked to the tetraspanin web and the production of a specific monoclonal antibody will help to further characterize the role of this “web” under physiological and pathological conditions. The tetraspanins (also called tetraspans or TM4SF molecules) are molecules with four transmembrane regions found in all cells but erythrocytes. They have been implicated in many cellular functions such as adhesion, migration, co-stimulation, signal transduction, and differentiation (1Maecker H.T. Todd S.C. Levy S. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 428-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). These various effects may be explained by the organization by tetraspanins of a network of molecular interactions, the tetraspanin web (previously called the tetraspan web) (2Rubinstein E.

J. 1999; 340: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Among the molecules participating in this “web” are a subset of β1 integrins in most cell types, CD4, CD8, major histocompatibility complex molecules, and CD19 in lymphoid cells (1Maecker H.T. Todd S.C. Levy S. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 428-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar,5Hemler M.E. Mannion B.A. Berditchevski F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 67-71PubMed Google Scholar). The effect of tetraspanins on cell function may partly reflect the engagement of associated molecules. Increasing evidence shows the importance of tetraspanins in physiological and pathological situations. Recently, a relation between mutations of Talla-1/TM4SF2 and certain cases of X-linked mental retardation was demonstrated (6Zemni R. Bienvenu T. Vinet M.C. Sefiani A. Carrie A. Billuart P. McDonell N. Couvert P. Francis F. Chafey P. Fauchereau F. Friocourt G. Portes V. Cardona A. Frints S. Meindl A. Brandau O. Ronce N. Moraine C. Bokhoven H. Ropers H.H. Sudbrak R. Kahn A. Fryns J.P. Beldjord C. Chelly J. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Moreover, the crucial role of CD9 in sperm-egg fusion has been shown (7Le Naour F. Rubinstein E. Jasmin C. Prenant M. Boucheix C. Science. 2000; 287: 319-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 8Miyado K. Yamada G. Yamada S. Hasuwa H. Nakamura Y. Ryu F. Suzuki K. Kosai K. Inoue K.

Genet. 2000; 24: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Importantly, CD9, like CD82, acts as a suppressor of metastasis since its transfection in melanoma cells was found to reduce their metastatic potential (10Ikeyama S. Koyama M. Yamaoko M. Sasada R. Miyake M. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1231-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). An inverse correlation between the expression of CD9 in the primary tumor and the appearance of metastases in melanomas, colon, lung, and breast cancers has been reported (11Si Z. Hersey P. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 54: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 12Miyake M. Nakano K. Ieki Y. Adachi M. Huang C.L. Itoi S. Koh T. Taki T.

Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 1507-1510PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of CD9 and CD82 is also frequently lower in metastatic cells compared with the primary tumor (12Miyake M. Nakano K. Ieki Y. Adachi M. Huang C.L. Itoi S. Koh T. Taki T. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4127-4131PubMed Google Scholar, 15Uchida S. Shimada Y. Watanabe G. Li Z.G. Hong T. Miyake M. Imamura M. Br. J.

Another tetraspanin that might play a role in cancer is CD81, which is a possible receptor for hepatitis C virus, a major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (17Pileri P. Uematsu Y. Campagnoli S. Galli G. Falugi F. Petracca R. Weiner A.J. Houghton M. Rosa D. Grandi G. Abrignani S. Science. 1998; 282: 938-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (1786) Google Scholar). The tetraspanin web model raises the question of the identification of web-associated molecules participating in the function of CD9. The implication in cell migration and metastasis is often proposed to be a consequence of its association with integrins (5Hemler M.E. Mannion B.A. Berditchevski F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 67-71PubMed Google Scholar, 18Rubinstein E. Le Naour F. Billard M. Prenant M. Boucheix C. Eur. J.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 833-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent data suggest that CD9 most likely interacts only indirectly with integrins, possibly through tetraspanin/tetraspanin interactions (4Serru V. Le Naour F. Billard M. Azorsa D.O. Lanza F. Boucheix C. Rubinstein E. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 22Yauch R.L. Berditchevski F. Harler M.B. Reichner J. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2751-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Molecules interacting directly with CD9 may be more relevant with respect to CD9 function. We have recently shown that inside the tetraspanin web, specific tetraspanin·partner complexes could be identified based on the resistance of these complexes to digitonin treatment (4Serru V. Le Naour F. Billard M. Azorsa D.O. Lanza F. Boucheix C. Rubinstein E. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and we reasoned that these primary complexes would actually correspond to direct interactions inside the tetraspanin web. In this previous study, the major molecular partner of CD9 in carcinoma cells was a 135-kDa molecule that we call CD9P-1 (CD9 partner 1). We now report on the production of an anti-CD9P-1 mAb1 that was used to purify and identify CD9P-1 and to characterize its association with several tetraspanins. The previously described anti-tetraspanin mAbs used in this study were SYB-1 and ALB-6 (CD9) (2Rubinstein E. Le Naour F. Lagaudrière C. Billard M. Conjeaud H. Boucheix C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2657-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar,18Rubinstein E. Le Naour F. Billard M. Prenant M. Boucheix C. Eur. J.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 833-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The new anti-tetraspanin mAbs TS63 (IgG1, CD63), TS81 (IgG2a, CD81), TS82 and TS82b (both IgG1, CD82), and TS151 (IgG1, CD151; this is an unrestricted anti-CD151 mAb, different from the previously described TS151r mAb (4Serru V. Le Naour F. Billard M. Azorsa D.O. Lanza F. Boucheix C. Rubinstein E. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar)) as well as the anti-β1 integrin mAb β1-vjf have been produced in our laboratory. These new mAbs were used in most experiments except for immunoblotting, for which SYB-1, 11B1G4, and Z81 were used. Also, among the anti-CD82 mAbs, TS82 was used for immunoprecipitation and TS82b for immunoblotting. The anti-CD55 mAb 12A12 has been previously described (24Lozahic S. Christiansen D. Manie S. Gerlier D. Billard M. Boucheix C. Rubinstein E. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 900-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). BALB/c mice were injected intraperitoneally twice with 107 HeLa cells, and a final boost was performed 3 weeks later with CD9-containing complexes collected from a Brij 97 lysate of ∼109 HeLa cells. Spleen cells were fused with P3x63AG8 mouse myeloma cells (5 × 107 and 3 × 107 cells, respectively) according to standard techniques and distributed into 96-well tissue culture plates. After 2 weeks, hybridoma culture supernatants were harvested and tested for staining of HeLa cells by indirect immunofluorescence using a microplate fluorescence reader (Cytofluor II, PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) and a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Positive supernatants were then further characterized by immunoprecipitation. The anti-CD9P-1 mAb 1F11 is of the IgG1 subclass. The two chimeric molecules CD81x9 and CD9x81 have been previously described (25Rubinstein E. Poindessous-Jazat V. Le Naour F. Billard M. Boucheix C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1919-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The KIAA1436cDNA (26Nagase T. Kikuno R. Ishikawa K.I. Hirosawa M. Ohara O. DNA Res. 2000; 7: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) was obtained from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute (Chiba, Japan) and was subcloned in the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). For expression of the KIAA1436gene product, CHO cells (5 × 106 cells in 0.4 ml of RPMI 1640 medium) were electroporated at room temperature with 10 μg of cDNA using the Gene Pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad, Ivry, France). The conditions were 300 V and 500 microfarads. To obtain cells stably expressing CD9P-1, G418 (Life Technologies, Inc., Cergy-Pontoise, France) was added 2 days later at 0.25 mg/ml. After 2 weeks, positive cells were selected by the immunomagnetic bead technique as recommended by the manufacturer (MACS, Miltenyi Biotec, Bergish Gladbach, Germany) using a combination of mAb 1F11 and anti-mouse antibody coupled to submicroscopic magnetic beads. Surface labeling of cells with EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) was performed as previously described (2Rubinstein E. Le Naour F. Lagaudrière C. Billard M. Conjeaud H. Boucheix C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2657-2665Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 4Serru V. Le Naour F. Billard M. Azorsa D.O. Lanza F. Boucheix C. Rubinstein E. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), except that the concentration of the labeling reagent was raised to 0.5 mg/ml to increase sensitivity. Briefly, cells were washed three times in Hanks' buffered saline and incubated in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 0.2 mmMgCl2 containing 0.5 mg/ml EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin. After a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, the cells were washed three times in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 0.2 mmMgCl2 to remove free biotin and to inhibit the reactive group. Cells labeled or not were lysed directly in the tissue culture flask (2 ml for a 75-cm2 flask) in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and: 10 kallikrein-inactivating units/ml aprotinin) containing 1% detergent Brij 97 (Sigma), Triton X-100 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Meylan, France), or digitonin (high purity, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). When cells were lysed with Brij 97, this buffer was supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2. Digitonin was first dissolved in methanol at 10% (w/v) and then diluted 10 times in lysis buffer. After a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g, and the cell lysate was precleared overnight by addition of 0.005 volume of heat-inactivated goat serum and 0.025 volume of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Rainham, United Kingdom). Proteins were then immunoprecipitated by adding 1 μl of ascites fluid and 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads to 200–400 μl of the lysate. After a 5-h incubation at 4 °C under constant agitation, the beads were washed five times in lysis buffer. For reprecipitation, the molecules coprecipitated with tetraspanins were eluted in lysis buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and 0.2% SDS and reprecipitated using specific antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were separated by 5–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Western blotting on immunoprecipitates was performed using biotinylated mAbs and a streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which was revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Stock solutions of 50 and 10 mm DSP (Pierce) in Me2SO (Sigma) were prepared and diluted 100 times in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 0.2 mm MgCl2 immediately before use, yielding final DSP concentrations of 0.5 and 0.1 mm and a final Me2SO concentration of 1%. A control solution containing the same concentration of Me2SO was also prepared. The cell monolayers (a 75-cm2 tissue culture flask was for each condition) were incubated with these solutions for 30 min at 4 °C; washed three times in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 0.2 mm MgCl2; and lysed in 1% Triton X-100 and 0.2% SDS at 4 °C for 30 min. Immunoprecipitations and Western blot analysis of the complexes were performed as described above, except that mAbs coupled to Sepharose beads were used for immunoprecipitations. The cells were surface-labeled with biotin before lysis in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.2% SDS. After immunoprecipitation, the beads were washed three times in the same buffer and then once with lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. The beads were boiled in 0.1% SDS for 2 min and diluted 10-fold in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 1% Triton X-100. After addition of 0.5 units ofN-glycanase (peptide-N 4-(N-acetyl-β-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase (EC 3.5.1.52), recombinant), 2.5 milliunits ofO-glycanase (glycopeptide α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.97) fromDiplococcus pneumoniae), or 5 milliunits of sialidase (exo-α-sialidase (EC 3.2.1.18) from Clostridium perfringens), the samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. All glycosidases were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. For purification of CD9P-1, ∼1.2 × 109 cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100 in the presence of protease inhibitors. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min, and the lysates were successively precleared with Sepharose 4B beads coupled to bovine serum albumin and to control IgG1. After another centrifugation, the lysates was incubated overnight in batch with Sepharose 4B beads coupled to mAb 1F11. The beads were washed three times in wash buffer and poured into a column. The beads were further washed with 5 volumes of 10 mm Tris (pH 8), 140 mm NaCl, 0.025% NaN3, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.5% deoxycholate; 5 bead volumes of 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 500 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100; and 5 volumes of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.3) containing 500 mm NaCl and 0.1% Triton X-100 before elution with 50 mm glycine HCl (pH 2.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100. The fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and SYPRO ruby staining as described by the manufacturer (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). For identification, the purified protein was concentrated using a Microcon YM-50 (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5% gel) under nonreducing conditions. The gels were silver-stained by successive incubations in 0.02% sodium thiosulfate for 2 min and in 0.1% silver nitrate for 40 min. The coloration was apparent following incubation of the gels in 0.014% formaldehyde and 2% sodium carbonate and was then stopped by addition of 5% acetic acid. The protein of interest was excised from the gels and destained for 5 min in 15 mm potassium ferricyanide and 50 mm sodium thiosulfate as described (27Gharahdaghi F. Weinberg C.R. Meagher D.A. Imai B.S. Mische S.M. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). After three washes in water, the gel pieces were incubated in 50% acetonitrile and 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.9) for 10 min, followed by addition of 2.7 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h and then by addition of 6 mm iodoacetamide for 30 min. The gel pieces were dried in a vacuum centrifuge. Trypsin digestion (cutting after arginine and lysine) was performed by addition of 100 ng of trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.9). Following enzymatic digestion overnight at 37 °C, the resultant peptides were extracted twice with 50 μl of 60% acetonitrile and 1% trifluoroacetic acid (Sigma). After removal of acetonitrile by centrifugation in a vacuum centrifuge, the peptides were concentrated using pipette tips (C18, Millipore Corp.). Analyses were performed using a PerSeptive Biosystems matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) Voyager-DE mass spectrometer operated in the delayed extraction mode. Peptide mixtures were analyzed using a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) in acetone containing 1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were selected in the mass range of 800–4000 Da. Spectra were calibrated using Calibration Mixture 2 of the Sequazyme peptide mass standards kit (PerSeptive Biosystems). The search program MS-Fit, developed by the University of California at San Francisco, was used for searching the NCBI Protein Database. Typical search parameters were as follows: maximum allowed peptide mass error 800 ppm, consideration of one incomplete cleavage per peptide, and full molecular mass and pH range. Serial sections (4 μm thick) of frozen samples from a human tissue bank maintained at −80 °C were prepared at −30 °C in a temperature-controlled microtome. They were incubated with mAb to either CD9 or CD9P-1 for 1 h at room temperature in a moist chamber, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and further incubated for 30 min with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibodies (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) diluted 1:1000 in phosphate-buffered saline. After three washes, the sections were mounted in phosphate-buffered saline/glycerol (3:7) and examined within 4 h with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BH-2). Our definition of a tetraspanin partner is a molecule remaining associated with a tetraspanin under conditions disrupting tetraspanin/tetraspanin interactions (digitonin, Triton X-100). We use the name CD9P-1 for the 135-kDa partner of CD9. To produce mAb directed to CD9P-1, we immunized mice twice with HeLa cells. The final boost was an injection of CD9-containing complexes collected from a Brij 97 lysate of ∼109 HeLa cells. Hybridomas were produced using standard protocols and initially selected by indirect immunofluorescence for their ability to stain HeLa cells, and anti-CD9 mAbs were identified on the basis of their reactivity toward CD9-transfected cells. Out of ∼50 supernatants staining HeLa cells, ∼10 were directed to CD9, and only one (1F11) immunoprecipitated a molecule comigrating with the 135-kDa CD9 partner from Triton/SDS lysates. During the initial screening, the 1F11 antigen was found to be a partner of CD9. Like the 135-kDa CD9 partner (4Serru V. Le Naour F. Billard M. Azorsa D.O. Lanza F. Boucheix C. Rubinstein E. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), the molecular mass of the 1F11 antigen is 125 kDa under nonreducing conditions and 135 kDa under reducing conditions (data not shown). Removal of N-glycans with N-glycanase reduced the molecular mass of the 1F11 antigen to ∼106 kDa (under reducing conditions), whereas removal of sialic acid by sialidase reduced its molecular mass to ∼125 kDa (Fig.1). Digestion in the presence of both sialidase and O-glycanase did not further reduce the molecular mass of CD9P-1. We utilized 1F11-coated Sepharose beads to purify CD9P-1 from HeLa cells. After concentration, electrophoresis, and silver staining, the major 125-kDa band (under nonreducing condition) was cut out from the gels and digested with trypsin for MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis. The spectra were used for protein identification in the NCBI Protein Database by the MS-Fit search program. The peptide masses were consistent with those of peptides derived from the KIAA1436 protein (NCBI accession number 7243270). Altogether, the peptides obtained after the enzymatic digestion matched 21% (195 out of 924) of the KIAA1436 gene product (TableI).Table IAssignment of peptide masses to the human KIAA1436 sequencem/z submittedMH+matchedΔResiduesPeptide sequenceppm888.6470888.0613659.5183400–406SYHLLVR888.6470889.0572−461.3891918–924LMSMEMD*923.2821922.9733334.6116678–684VQEDEFR977.4097977.0653352.5191206–213EGEPFELR1068.78641068.1351609.7344282–291ALSADQGSYR1083.52541083.2371266.1538240–249SVLALTHEGR1098.31341098.3391−23.3657132–140LQRGEILLR1122.92831122.2727584.1798488–495FTVSWYYR1167.94541167.2271615.3742538–546EHTDTFNFR1533.81591532.7212714.2014687–699MYQTQVSDAGLYR1549.87251548.7206743.8055687–699MYQTQVSDAGLYR**1667.09181665.8089770.1550351–364ADDVRPEVTWSFSR1746.77351746.9924−125.2936556–569GNYYCVVSAWTKQR1913.54611912.0325791.6164260–276YHSGDVRLDTVGSDAYR1929.50791928.1222718.6655382–399DSLVHSSPHVALSHVDAR2172.21692170.5289777.7036185–205VLADSLHVGPSARPPPSLSLR2314.21542315.4827−547.3253164–184CSTPSTDATVQGNYEDTVQVK2314.21542312.5593716.1136379–399LDRDSLVHSSPHVALSHVDARAnalysis was by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of the peptide masses, followed by searching the NCBI Protein Database.

Flow cytometry analysis of CHO cells transfected with theKIAA1436 cDNA indicated that 1F11 specifically recognized this gene product (Fig.2 A). To definitively prove that the protein encoded by the KIAA1436 gene is a CD9 partner, CHO cells were transfected with a CD9 cDNA with or without KIAA1436 cDNA, and we examined whether the two molecules could interact in digitonin. As shown in Fig.2 B, CD9 co-immunoprecipitated with the KIAA1436 protein from cells transfected with both cDNAs and reciprocally. Due to their association, the patterns of surface proteins that co-immunoprecipitate with the different tetraspanins from Brij 97 or CHAPS extracts are identical in a given cell line (2Rubinstein E.

Immunogenetics. 1994; 39: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) (exemplified by CD9 in Fig. 3 A). A similar pattern, although with quantitative differences, was observed for CD9P-1 (Fig.3 A), which is concordant with the strong interaction of this molecule with CD9. In digitonin, the tetraspanin/tetraspanin interactions were no longer observed, and accordingly, the patterns of molecules that co-immunoprecipitated with different tetraspanins were distinct (4Serru V. Le Naour F. Billard M. Azorsa D.O. Lanza F. Boucheix C. Rubinstein E. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, CD9P-1 clearly co-immunoprecipitated with CD9 and a lower fraction of CD81. Several molecules, particularly one at 63 kDa (under nonreducing conditions), present in both the CD9 and CD81 immunoprecipitates were absent from the CD9P-1 immunoprecipitate (Fig. 3 A). If these molecules were barely detectable in our previous study, they are now clearly visible because the sensitivity of the experiments has been increased. A 175-kDa molecule (under nonreducing conditions) was present in the CD9P-1 immunoprecipitate, but not in the CD9 or CD81 immunoprecipitates. Molecules comigrating with CD9P-1 were clearly present in the CD9, CD81, and CD151 immunoprecipitates from digitonin lysates (Fig. 3 and our previous study (4Serru V. Le Naour F. Billard M. Azorsa D.O. Lanza F. Boucheix C. Rubinstein E. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar)). To determine the relationship between these molecules and the KIAA1436 protein, cells were surface-labeled with biotin before lysis with digitonin and immunoprecipitation with anti-tetraspanins mAbs. After elution, the co-immunoprecipitated proteins were identified by a second round of immunoprecipitations using mAb 1F11 or an anti-β1 mAb (Fig. 3 B). CD9P-1 was present in both the CD9 and CD81 immunoprecipitates, but not in the CD151 immunoprecipitate. As previously described (4Serru V. Le Naour F. Billard M. Azorsa D.O. Lanza F. Boucheix C. Rubinstein E. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), the 135-kDa molecule (125 kDa under nonreducing conditions) present in the CD151 immunoprecipitate is the β1 integrin subunit, which is not present in the CD9 or CD81 immunoprecipitates. To study the interaction of CD9P-1 with additional tetraspanins and to confirm the preceding data, Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitates was performed (Fig. 4 A). After lysis of HeLa cells in Brij 97, a fraction of CD9P-1 was found to associate with CD63, CD82, and CD151 in addition to CD9 and CD81. The association of CD151 with CD9P-1 in Brij 97 extracts was confirmed by two-step immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3 C). No tetraspanin other than CD9 and CD81 remained associated with CD9P-1 in digitonin. With the exception of the association of integrin α3β1 with CD151, the majority of surface proteins described to associate with tetraspanins are loosely linked to these molecules, and the association can be seen only in mild detergents. In contrast, a fraction of CD9P-1 still remained associated with CD9 or CD81 after lysis in Triton X-100 (Fig. 4 B). Surprisingly, although more CD9P-1 associated with CD9 than with CD81 in Brij 97 and digitonin extracts, the CD81/CD9P-1 association was more stable since it was still observed in the presence of Triton X-100 + 0.2% SDS in both A431 (Fig. 4 B) and HeLa (data not shown) cells. No CD151/CD9P-1 association could be detec"
https://openalex.org/W2081937147,"The major neuronal post-translational modification of tubulin, polyglutamylation, can act as a molecular potentiometer to modulate microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) binding as a function of the polyglutamyl chain length. The relative affinity of Tau, MAP2, and kinesin has been shown to be optimal for tubulin modified by ∼3 glutamyl units. Using blot overlay assays, we have tested the ability of polyglutamylation to modulate the interaction of two other structural MAPs, MAP1A and MAP1B, with tubulin. MAP1A and MAP2 display distinct behavior in terms of tubulin binding; they do not compete with each other, even when the polyglutamyl chains of tubulin are removed, indicating that they have distinct binding sites on tubulin. Binding of MAP1A and MAP1B to tubulin is also controlled by polyglutamylation and, although the modulation of MAP1B binding resembles that of MAP2, we found that polyglutamylation can exert a different mode of regulation toward MAP1A. Interestingly, although the affinity of the other MAPs tested so far decreases sharply for tubulins carrying long polyglutamyl chains, the affinity of MAP1A for these tubulins is maintained at a significant level. This differential regulation exerted by polyglutamylation toward different MAPs might facilitate their selective recruitment into distinct microtubule populations, hence modulating their functional properties.

They are made up of α- and β-tubulin heterodimers, the two related subunits displaying a large isoform polymorphism due to the expression of multiple genes whose products are substrates for several post-translational modifications (for review, see Refs. 1MacRae T.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 244: 265-278Google Scholar and 2Luduena R.F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 178: 207-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MTs are polymerized under the control of MT-associated proteins (MAPs), which also shape the MT networks and confer on them distinct functional properties. For instance, changes in MAP expression and/or activity when cells enter mitosis is accompanied by drastic changes in dynamic, structural, and functional properties of spindle MTs, as compared with interphasic MTs. Additional differences can also be observed in the binding of structural or motor MAPs to the various MT subpopulations—astral, polar, and kinetochore MTs—of the mitotic spindle (for review, see Refs. 3Cassimeris L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar and 4Sharp D.J. Rogers G.C. Scholey J.M.

MAPs generally regulate their binding affinity for MTs by phosphorylation (see for instance Refs. 5Brugg B. Matus A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 6Nislow C. Lombillo V.A. Kuriyama R. McIntosh J.R.

Cell. 1995; 83: 1159-1169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). However, observations that one motor binds to only one MT in Chlamydomonas axoneme (9Bernstein M. Beech P.L. Katz S.G. Rosenbaum J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1313-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) or to only one MT subset in lobster axon (10Miller R.H. Lasek R.J. Katz M.J. Science. 1987; 235: 220-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) or in the mitotic spindle (4Sharp D.J. Rogers G.C. Scholey J.M. Nature. 2000; 407: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) clearly imply that MTs must also control their interactions with MAPs and somehow deliver information to permit or restrict MAPs from binding. The molecular basis for such control might be found in the tubulin polymorphism. Indeed, tubulin diversity can generate MT diversity by conferring to MTs heterogeneous interacting surfaces instead of a monotonous succession of identical subunits all along the polymers. In this context, post-translational modifications of tubulin represent interesting potential means to play such a role: They can be easily added to or removed from the MT surface through the intervention of specific modifying enzymes that exhibit net substrate preferences for either free or polymerized tubulin (for review see Refs. 1MacRae T.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 244: 265-278Google Scholar, 2Luduena R.F. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 178: 207-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dealing with the genetic diversity of the diverse tubulin isotypes would require active, time-consuming transcription and translation and would not be as efficient as the rapid post-translational events, in particular in the axonal compartment, where no protein synthesis occurs, or in mitotic cells where transcription and translation are turned off. Among the multiple post-translational modifications of tubulin, polyglutamylation was the first oligomeric modification discovered (11Eddé B. Rossier J. Le Caer J.-P. Desbruyères E. Gros F. Denoulet P. Science. 1990; 247: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Functionally, and in a close parallel with its oligomeric structure, polyglutamylation was further shown to behave as a molecular potentiometer that modulates the binding of MAPs as a function of the polyglutamyl chain length (12Boucher D. Larcher J.C. Gros F. Denoulet P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12471-12477Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 13Larcher J.C. Boucher D. Lazereg S. Gros F. Denoulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22117-22124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). For instance, Tau, MAP2, and kinesin motors have been shown to undergo the same mode of binding regulation by polyglutamylation: The relative affinity of these proteins first increases progressively for tubulin modified by 1 to 3 glutamyl units then progressively decreases when the chain lengthens further, up to 6 units. This effect is likely to be achieved by conformational changes of the C-terminal domain of tubulin, driven by the growth of the polyglutamyl chain (12Boucher D. Larcher J.C. Gros F. Denoulet P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12471-12477Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 13Larcher J.C. Boucher D. Lazereg S. Gros F. Denoulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22117-22124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Thus, polyglutamylation could control the targeted binding of a particular MAP to MTs at a given level of glutamylation, without altering the binding of other MAPs. However, if polyglutamylation acts as a general regulator of MAP binding, it is difficult to imagine the manner in which it could distinguish between the different MAPs. Consequently, we have sought to determine the binding behavior of other MAPs, namely MAP1A and MAP1B, toward glutamylated tubulin and compared it to that of another high molecular weight MAP, MAP2. We report that polyglutamylation regulates the binding of MAP1A and MAP1B in a chain length-dependent manner, MAP1B behaving like MAP2. On the other hand, we found that the binding of MAP1A was differentially regulated by polyglutamylation. In contrast to the other MAPs tested so far, which all display an optimal affinity for tubulins modified by around 3 glutamyl units, MAP1A has the selective property to maintain a high affinity for highly glutamylated α- and β-tubulins. A model for a transition between MAPs along axonal processes is presented. The general anti-α-tubulin and anti-β-tubulin monoclonal antibodies DM1A (working dilution, 1:1000) and DM1B (1:500) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and monoclonal anti-MAP1B (anti-MAP5, 1:3000) and monoclonal anti-MAP2 (1:2000) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. The anti-MAP1A (1A-1, 14) monoclonal antibody (1:20,000) was a generous gift of Dr. R. B. Vallee (University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA). Peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG serum (1:10,000) was from Byosis (France). Tubulin was prepared from a 150,000 × g supernatant of adult mouse brain by one cycle of assembly-disassembly (15Shelanski M.L. Gaskin F. Cantor C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar) in MEM buffer (50 mmMES, pH 6.7, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (10 μg.ml−1aprotinin, 10 μg.ml−1 leupeptin, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride). Tubulin was further purified by phosphocellulose cation-exchange chromatography (P11, Whatman) in PEM buffer (75 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2). Tubulin aliquots were stored in PEM buffer containing 1 mm Mg-GTP in liquid nitrogen. MAP1A was purified from twice-cycled MTs prepared from whole bovine brain according to Pedrotti and Islam (16Pedrotti B. Islam K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12463-12470Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The protocol is based on a differential binding of MAPs to MTs depending on the sulfonate buffer used (17Pedrotti B. Soffientini A. Islam K. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1993; 25: 234-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, twice-cycled MT proteins were assembled in MEM buffer in the presence of 20 μm taxol. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in warm PEM buffer containing 20 μm taxol and incubated 20 min at 37 °C prior to centrifugation. Most of MAP1A was released into the supernatant, with some other components, and the purification was achieved by a Mono-Q anion-exchange chromatography. MAP1B was prepared from whole calf brain by two ion-exchange chromatographies (18Pedrotti B. Islam K. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1995; 30: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). After pelleting assembled MTs, the supernatant was submitted to a Mono-Q anion-exchange chromatography in MEM buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl. Fractions eluted at 0.4m NaCl were pooled, dialyzed against MEM buffer, and loaded on a Mono-S anion-exchange chromatographic column. MAP1B, eluted at 0.33 m NaCl, was finally dialyzed against MEM buffer, rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. MAP2 was purified by the heat treatment method according to Herzog and Weber (19Herzog W. Weber K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 92: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Briefly, MAP2 was prepared from two-cycled calf brain MTs, which were depolymerized at 4 °C, cleared by centrifugation, brought to 0.75 m NaCl and boiled for 5 min. The supernatant was collected and submitted to a 50% (w/v) ammonium sulfate precipitation. MAP2 and Tau were then separated by phosphocellulose cation-exchange chromatography followed by a Sepharose 4B exclusion chromatography. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid method (Micro BCA protein assay reagent kit, Pierce), with bovine serum albumin being used as standard. Phosphocellulose-purified tubulin from mouse brain was digested by subtilisin (Sigma) in a molar ratio of 240/1 at room temperature for increasing times (0–150 min) in 10 mm MES, pH 6.7, 0.1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mm GTP. 10 μm EDTA and 50 μmdithiothreitol were added to the digestion buffer to inhibit contaminating proteases. Aliquots were drawn at increasing times and analyzed by one-dimensional PAGE to follow the kinetics of proteolysis. Protein separation by one-dimensional (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar) or two-dimensional PAGE (21O'Farell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was carried out as described previously (13Larcher J.C. Boucher D. Lazereg S. Gros F. Denoulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22117-22124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Transfer of proteins onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond C, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was performed essentially as described (22Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44893) Google Scholar), and the blots were saturated in TBS-T (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 136.8 mm NaCl, 0.1% v/v Tween 20) containing 2% (w/v) low fat milk. Antibodies were incubated in TBS-T overnight at room temperature, and their binding was revealed by the chemiluminescence system ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Signals were quantified by densitometric scanning using an integrating densitometer (Vernon) and the MultiAnalyst System (Bio-Rad). Binding of MAPs to high speed supernatant proteins or tubulin, separated by one-dimensional or two-dimensional PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond C, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was performed essentially as described previously (12Boucher D. Larcher J.C. Gros F. Denoulet P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12471-12477Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Briefly, precise locations of blotted tubulin subunits after one-dimensional PAGE or blotted tubulin isoforms after two-dimensional PAGE were registered with pencil marks on the membranes after Ponceau red staining following electrotransfer. Strips corresponding to lanes of one-dimensional gels, or rectangles corresponding to tubulin regions of the two-dimensional gels, were cut from the blots and placed into the grooves of a hand-made, Plexiglas incubation device adjusted to the size of the nitrocellulose pieces. Membranes were blocked overnight in overlay (OV) buffer (MEM buffer containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% v/v Tween 20, and 0.1% w/v gelatin), incubated 1 h at room temperature with the overlaying protein fraction (1 ml) then washed 5 × 5 min with OV buffer. Protein interactions were stabilized with 0.5% (v/v) formaldehyde in OV buffer. Blots were then equilibrated in TBS-T buffer and processed for MAP immunodetection as described. Signals were scanned and processed by the MultiAnalyst System (Bio-Rad). Two-dimensional overlay experiments with the different MAPs were done independently several times (6 with MAP1A, 2 with MAP1B, and 5 with MAP2). After MAP overlays, each blot was reincubated with anti-α- and anti-β-tubulin antibodies (post-control immunoblots) to ensure a perfect positioning of the MAP signals onto the different tubulins immobilized on the membrane. For each overlay experiment and for each α- and β-tubulin subunit, signals from overlays and from control immunoblots were scanned (MultiAnalyst System, Bio-Rad), giving one value for each 40 μm. Data were exported and processed using Kaleidagraph (Abelbeck Software). Using marks prepositioned on the membranes and on the autoradiographic films, overlay signals were carefully aligned with those from the corresponding control immunoblots. Control immunoblots were then aligned together. Background was subtracted, and data were expressed as fractions of the maximal value taken as 1.0. Aligned scans were then divided into 12 sections, each one encompassing 75- to 90-point values and representing 3–3.6 mm of a tubulin two-dimensional spot in the pI dimension. For each section, the 75–90 values were added and the sums were exported into Excel files. Files corresponding to repeated experiments with a given MAP were used to calculate mean values and standard deviations (per tubulin subunit and per overlaid MAP for each of the 12 sections). These final values were used to create the graphics in Fig. 4(curves and histograms). The mean values were also used for a statistical comparative test (Student's ttest) between MAP1A and MAP1B, MAP1A and MAP2, and MAP1B and MAP2. From this test, p values were calculated for each section. The specificity of the interactions between purified MAP1A, MAP1B, or MAP2 and tubulin was tested by blot overlay experiments. In a first step, proteins from whole mouse brain, high speed supernatant fraction (So) were separated by one-dimensional PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose. Increasing concentrations of each MAP were separately overlaid onto identical duplicate membranes, and MAPs bound to their protein targets were detected using specific antibodies. Fig.1 A shows that, under the experimental conditions used and among the large number of soluble brain proteins present on the membrane, α- and β-tubulin represent by far the main protein targets for each of the three MAP tested. Few other unidentified proteins that bound MAPs were also detected albeit at much lower level. In a second step, increasing concentrations of each MAP were overlaid onto a constant amount of phosphocellulose-purified tubulin separated by one-dimensional PAGE and immobilized onto nitrocellulose. Fig. 1(B–D) shows that the saturation curves of the α- and the β-tubulin subunits with the different MAPs are completely superimposed, indicating that MAP1A, MAP1B, and MAP2 each have the same intrinsic capacity to bind to either tubulin subunit. In these experimental overlay conditions, the half-saturation values were found to be similar (20–30 nm) for the different MAPs. The protein-protein interactions between nitrocellulose-bound tubulin and soluble MAP1A or MAP2 in the presence of increasing concentrations of salt or urea were also tested by blot overlay. Binding of MAP1A and MAP2 to tubulin was differentially affected by these treatments (Fig. 2). Interaction of MAP1A appeared to be significantly more sensitive to salt when compared with MAP2 (Fig. 2, A and B). For example, addition of 50 mm NaCl resulted in a 50% decrease in MAP1A binding (Fig. 2 A), whereas the presence of up to 75 mm NaCl did not affect the binding of MAP2 (Fig.2 B). However, neither MAP exhibited a detectable difference in its interaction with the α- or β-tubulin subunit. In the presence of increasing concentrations of urea, the binding of MAP2 appeared to be highly sensitive to the presence of this chaotropic agent and decreased linearly as a function of urea concentration (Fig.2 D). A concentration of 1 m urea was sufficient to reduce MAP2 binding by 50%, and no interaction could be detected above 2 m urea. Once again, no difference could be observed between the two tubulin subunits. By contrast, MAP1A in the presence of urea exhibited important differences in binding to the α- and β-tubulin subunit (Fig. 2 C). As noted above with MAP2, a 50% decrease in the binding of MAP1A to tubulin was observed in the presence of 1 m urea. However, as the urea concentration was raised further, binding of MAP1A to β-tubulin decreased rapidly but the binding to α-tubulin appeared to remain largely and reproducibly unaffected. These results suggest that interaction of MAP1A with tubulin mainly depends on ionic bonds, to a larger extent than for MAP2, and that binding of MAP2 depends, to a larger extent than for MAP1A, on the protein conformation through the implication of critical hydrogen bonds. Additionally, MAP1A appears to interact differently with the two tubulin subunits implying that, although MAP1A binds to both subunits, the binding occurs at nonhomologous domains. Taken together, these results suggest that different amino acid residues of tubulin are involved in the interaction with MAP1A and MAP2. A possible effect of calcium ions (from 1 to 10 mm) on the binding of MAP1A was also investigated, but no qualitative or quantitative modification in the binding of MAP was observed (data not shown). We previously reported that polyglutamylation of tubulin can regulate the binding of Tau, MAP2, and different kinesin motors as a function of the polyglutamyl chain length through progressive conformational changes of the C-terminal domain of tubulin, the post-translational polyglutamyl chain acting as a molecular potentiometer (12Boucher D. Larcher J.C. Gros F. Denoulet P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12471-12477Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 13Larcher J.C. Boucher D. Lazereg S. Gros F. Denoulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22117-22124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Because Tau and MAP2, on one hand, and kinesin motors, on the other hand, are thought to interact at separate but close sites within the C-terminal domain of tubulin (13Larcher J.C. Boucher D. Lazereg S. Gros F. Denoulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22117-22124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), we observed logically a similar effect of polyglutamylation on the modulation of binding of these three different proteins. In view of the observations that the putative tubulin binding sites present on MAP1A and MAP1B are quite different from those described for Tau or MAP2 (see “Discussion”), we asked whether MAP1A and MAP1B binding could also be affected by tubulin polyglutamylation. Consequently, we tested their binding to tubulins carrying glutamyl chains of various lengths (from 0 to 6 or 7 glutamyl units). Because polyglutamylation is, by far, the major post-translational modification of both α- and β-tubulin in adult brain (11Eddé B. Rossier J. Le Caer J.-P. Desbruyères E. Gros F. Denoulet P. Science. 1990; 247: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 23Eddé B. Rossier J. Le Caer J.-P. Berwald-Netter Y. Koulakoff A. Gros F. Denoulet P. J. Cell.

Cell. 1993; 4: 615-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), an electrophoretic separation of brain tubulin by two-dimensional PAGE allowed us to differentiate between the various glutamylated forms of both subunits toward the acidic portion of the gel, proportionally to the number of the additional acidic charges of the glutamyl units, in other words, proportionally to the polyglutamyl chain length. After two-dimensional PAGE, the separated glutamylated isoforms of tubulin were immobilized by electrotransfer onto a nitrocellulose membrane where they could be easily located and probed for their capacity to interact with a given MAP. Fig. 3 A shows a typical two-dimensional pattern of adult brain tubulin after immunodetection with anti-α- and anti-β-tubulin antibodies. The unmodified primary translation products are present at the extreme basic side of the different tubulin spots (25Denoulet P. Eddé B. Gros F. Gene. 1986; 50: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 26Denoulet P. Eddé B. Pinto-Henrique D. Koulakoff A. Berwald-Netter Y. Gros F. Struct. Funct. Cytoskeleton. 1988; 171: 231-237Google Scholar), and the glutamylated derivatives are spread toward the acidic sides of the spots (24Audebert S. Desbruyères E. Gruszczynski C. Koulakoff A. Gros F. Denoulet P. Eddé B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 615-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 27Wolff A. de Néchaud B. Chillet D. Mazarguil H. Desbruyères E. Audebert S. Eddé B. Gros F. Denoulet P. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 425-432PubMed Google Scholar), as a function of the number of glutamyl units oligomerized into the post-translational chains. The extreme acidic sides of the spots correspond to α- or β-tubulins carrying polyglutamylated chains 6–7 units in length. Nitrocellulose membranes, identical to those shown in Fig.3 A, were overlaid with purified MAP1A, MAP1B, or MAP2. Fig.3 (B–D) shows the immunodetection of MAP1A, MAP1B, and MAP2, respectively, that bound to α- and β-tubulin isoforms. Compared with Fig. 3 A, which displays the whole repertoire of tubulin isoforms present on the membrane and available for MAP interaction, MAP1A, MAP1B, and MAP2 did not obviously bind to all of the tubulins with the same intensity but rather bound to a restricted subpopulation of mid-glutamylated tubulin isoforms. This observation strongly suggests that, as already reported for Tau, MAP2, or kinesin (12Boucher D. Larcher J.C. Gros F. Denoulet P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12471-12477Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 13Larcher J.C. Boucher D. Lazereg S. Gros F. Denoulet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22117-22124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), the length of the polyglutamyl chains linked to α- and β-tubulin can also regulate the binding of MAP1A and MAP1B. A closer examination of the positions of the MAPs bound onto tubulin in Fig. 3 (B–D) shows that each MAP displays a distinct tubulin pattern of preferential binding. Compared with MAP2 (Fig.3 D), MAP1B appears to bind roughly to the same moderately glutamylated tubulin isoforms (Fig. 3 C). MAP1A, however, seems to bind to additional more acidic α- and β-tubulin isoforms, i.e. those carrying longer polyglutamyl chains (Fig. 3 B). To analyze more precisely the binding preference of the diverse MAPs, signals obtained from control immunoblots and from overlays (such as those shown in Fig. 3, A–D) were integrated by densitometric scanning. Several independent experiments with different MAPs were processed and submitted to statistical analysis to confirm or invalidate the differences observed in the binding of distinct MAPs to a given subset of tubulin isoforms. To compare the relative affinities of the three MAPs for tubulins at different levels of glutamylation, scans were divided into 12 regions of identical size along the pI dimension from the basic to the acidic side of the tubulin two-dimensional spots, that is, from unglutamylated to highly glutamylated tubulin isoforms, respectively. Results for both tubulin subunits are shown in Fig. 4. In theupper panels are represented the mean distribution of the different α- and β-tubulin isoforms present on the membrane and the mean relative amounts of MAP1A, MAP1B, and MAP2 bound to the tubulin isoforms as a function of pI. These mean scans from control immunoblots and overlay experiments were accurately aligned one to the other relative to the pI on the x axis (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The lower panels show the comparison of the binding capacities of MAP1A versus MAP1B, MAP1A versus MAP2, and MAP1B versus MAP2 toward the different tubulin isoforms as a function of their degree of glutamylation. Asterisks positioned in sections indicate that the differences observed in the binding behavior of two MAPs toward a given isotubulin subset can be considered as significant according to Student t test calculations (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 4 shows that the relative affinity of MAP2 for α- and β-tubulin increases with the polyglutamyl chain length, as reported previously (12Boucher D. Larcher J.C. Gros F. Denoulet P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12471-12477Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), reaching an optimum for a length of about 3 units then gradually decreasing for longer chains. Similarly, the tubulin isoform binding range of MAP1B is also centered around triglutamylated tubulins and does not differ significantly from that of MAP2. By contrast, the tubulin isoform binding range of MAP1A is much broader and clearly comprises more acidic isoforms from both tubulin subunits. Compared with MAP2 or MAP1B, the optimal preference of MAP1A is shifted toward tubulins with longer polyglutamyl chains. All of these differences were confirmed to be statistically significant. From data shown in Fig. 4, it can be calculated that tubulins with short (<3 units) polyglutamyl chains can bind MAP1B or MAP2 ∼2 times more efficiently than MAP1A. This ratio is reversed for tubulins carrying long polyglutamyl chains (>4 units). Although the relative affinity of MAP1B or MAP2 for tubulins comprising more than four glutamates shows a drastic 70% decrease, MAP1A shows a unique capacity to significantly maintain a high affinity for these highly glutamylated tubulins (80–90% of the optimal value for α-tubulins; 75–120% for β-tubulins). In conclusion, it appears that polyglutamylation of tubulin has the"

Here, we have employed a newly emerging technology, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), used to study protein-protein interactions in living cells, to demonstrate that the thyrotropin-releasing hormone receptor (TRHR) forms constitutive homo-oligomers. This formation of TRHR homo-oligomers in the absence of ligand was shown by demonstration of an energy transfer between TRHR molecules fused to either donor, Renilla luciferase (Rluc) or acceptor, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) molecules. This interaction was shown to be specific, since energy transfer was not detected between co-expressed tagged TRHRs and either complementary tagged gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) or β2-adrenergic receptors. Furthermore, generation of a BRET signal between the TRHRs could only be inhibited by co-expression of the wild-type TRHR and not by other GPCRs. Agonist stimulation led to a time- and dose-dependent increase in the amount of energy transfer. Inhibition of receptor internalization by co-expression of dynamin mutant K44A did not affect the interaction between TRHRs, suggesting that clustering of receptors within clathrin-coated pits is not sufficient for energy transfer to occur. BRET also provided evidence for the agonist-induced oligomerization of another GPCR, the GnRH receptor (GnRHR), and the presence of an agonist-induced interaction of the adaptor protein, β-arrestin, with TRHR and the absence of an interaction of β-arrestin with GnRHR.

TRH functions via binding to its receptor subtype that belongs to the large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the first of which identified (1Zhao D. Yang J. Jones K.E. Gerald C.

Traditionally, GPCRs were thought to function as monomeric units, coupling to their cognate G-proteins in a 1:1 stoichiometry upon agonist activation. However, a growing body of biochemical and functional evidence supports the existence of homo- and heterodimers and oligomers and thus a critical role for GPCR-GPCR interactions in receptor function. Early functional evidence for GPCR dimerization came from the observation that the co-expression of two defective receptors can restore receptor activity by trans-complementation between mutant or chimeric receptors (12Maggio R.

In order to assess whether homo- and hetero-oligomerization exists among GPCRs in living cells, newly developed biophysical methods have been utilized to provide convincing evidence for the formation of receptor complexes. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) has been used to show homodimerization/homo-oligomerization of somatostatin receptors (26Rocheville M. Lange D.C. Kumar U. Sasi R. Patel R.C. Patel Y.C. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 7862-7869Google Scholar) and GnRHRs (36Cornea A. Janovick J.A. Maya-Núñez G. Conn P.M. J. Biol. Chem... 2001; 276: 2153-2158Google Scholar) and heterodimerization between somatostatin receptor, somatostatin receptor 5, and the dopamine D2 receptor (29Rocheville M. Lange D.C. Kumar U. Patel S.C. Patel R.C. Patel Y.C. Science.. 2000; 288: 154-157Google Scholar). Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) represents a novel derivation of the FRET technique (37Xu Y. Piston D.W. Johnson C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1999; 96: 151-156Google Scholar). This approach involves the transfer of energy resulting from the degradation of coelenterazine by Renilla luciferase (Rluc) to green fluorescent protein or a red-shifted variant, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP), which in turn emits fluorescence. BRET is strictly dependent on the molecular proximity between the energy donor (Rluc) and acceptor (EYFP), making it ideal for studying protein-protein interactions. Furthermore, it has advantages over FRET in that it avoids the need for fluorescence excitation and thus possible cell damage and photobleaching (37Xu Y. Piston D.W. Johnson C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1999; 96: 151-156Google Scholar). BRET was initially used to detect interactions between the cyanobacteria clock protein KaiB inEscherichia coli (37Xu Y. Piston D.W. Johnson C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1999; 96: 151-156Google Scholar). More recently, BRET has been used to demonstrate that the β2-adrenergic receptor exists as functional dimers in living cells and also the agonist-induced interaction between the receptor and adaptor protein β-arrestin 2 (38Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2000; 97: 3684-3689Google Scholar). Here we have taken advantage of this newly developed biophysical technique to investigate whether the TRHR could exist as oligomers in living mammalian cells. We have shown that in the unbound state, the TRHR exists as preformed homo-oligomeric complexes and that this interaction is modulated by agonist activation of the receptor. BRET was also used to examine the agonist-promoted interaction between TRHR and GnRHRs with the intracellular adaptor protein β-arrestin to demonstrate a direct real time interaction in intact cells. The TRHR/Rluc construct was generated by amplification of the rat TRHR coding sequence (39Sellar R.E. Taylor P.L. Lamb R.F. Zabavnik J. Anderson L. Eidne K.A. J. Mol. Endocrinol... 1993; 10: 199-206Google Scholar) without its stop codon using sense and antisense primers containingBamHI and NotI sites, respectively. The fragment was then cloned in frame into the pRluc vector constructed by insertion of the Rluc coding region into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Similarly, the TRHR/EYFP fusion construct was created by insertion of theBamHI/NotI fragment in frame into the EYFP vector constructed by insertion of the EYFP coding region into pcDNA3. The GnRHR/Rluc and GnRHR/EYFP constructs were generated by amplification of the rat GnRHR +1 stop codon mutant coding region (40Heding A. Vrecl M. Bogerd J. McGregor A. Sellar R. Taylor P.L. Eidne K.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 11472-11477Google Scholar) without its stop codon using sense and antisense primers containingEcoRV and NotI sites, respectively. This generated a 10-amino acid C-terminal extension to the GnRHR onto which the Rluc or EYFP coding sequence could be added. This GnRHREcoRV/NotI fragment was then cloned into the pcDNA3 vector containing either Rluc or EYFP as described above. The Rluc/EYFP fusion construct was generated by amplification of the Rluc coding region without its stop codon containing HindIII and EcoRV sites and insertion of thisHindIII/EcoRV fragment in frame into theHindIII/EcoRV sites of the EYFP vector. The rat GnRHR and rat GnRHR/TRHR carboxyl-terminal tail chimera (GnRHR/TRHR tail) have been previously described (40Heding A. Vrecl M. Bogerd J. McGregor A. Sellar R. Taylor P.L. Eidne K.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 11472-11477Google Scholar). The cDNA for human protease-activated receptor 1 was provided by L. Brass (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). The dynamin dominant negative mutant (K44A) construct was provided by S. Schmid (University of California, San Francisco, CA). The β2-adrenergic/Rluc (β2-AR/Rluc) and β2-adrenergic/EYFP (β2-AR/EYFP) fusion constructs were provided by M. Bouvier (University of Montreal) and were previously described (38Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2000; 97: 3684-3689Google Scholar). HEK 293 and COS 1 cells (ATCC) maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, glutamine (0.3 mg/ml), and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml) (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 or 1 × 106 cells/ml per 60- or 100-mm dish, respectively. Transient transfections were performed the following day with 5 or 10 μg of total DNA using Superfect (Qiagen), and cells were used 48 h post-transfection. Iodinated [d-Trp6,Pro9,N-Et]GnRH (Sigma) was prepared using the lactoperoxidase method and purified by chromatography on a Sephadex G-25 column in 0.01 m acetic acid/0.1% bovine serum albumin. The specific activity was 42 μCi/μg and was calculated as described previously (41Bramley T.A. McPhie C.A. Menzies G.S. Placenta.. 1992; 13: 555-581Google Scholar). Transfected HEK 293 cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated eight-well chamber slides 24 h after transfection. Treatments were carried out 48 h post-transfection, and then cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, mounted in Fluoroguard (Bio-Rad), and sealed with a coverslip. Cells were excited with a 488-nm laser light and examined using a Bio-Rad confocal laser microscope under an oil immersion × 60 objective with light filtered in the green channel from 500 to 550 nm. Dose displacement receptor binding assays were performed on COS 1 cells transiently transfected with untagged and tagged TRHR or GnRHR expression constructs in 24-well plates. Briefly, cells were incubated for 120 min at 4 °C in assay buffer (HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin) with125I-labeled [d-Trp6,Pro9,N-Et]GnRH or [3H][Me-His2]TRH (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with or without unlabeled agonist. The concentration of unlabeled agonist used ranged from 10−6 to 10−11m. The cells were then washed and solubilized in 0.2 m NaOH, 1% SDS, and the radioactivity was counted, with receptor binding expressed as a percentage of maximum specific binding. Receptor internalization assays were performed in HEK 293 cells as previously described (42Vrecl M. Anderson L. Hanyaloglu A. McGregor A.M. Groarke A.D. Milligan G. Taylor P.L. Eidne K.A. Mol. Endocrinol... 1998; 12: 1818-1829Google Scholar). Briefly, transiently transfected cells in 24-well plates were incubated with 125I-labeled [d-Trp6,Pro9,N-Et]GnRH or [3H][Me-His2]TRH at 37 °C for 5–120 min. Surface bound radioactivity was then removed by washing with acid solution for 12 min. Internalized radioactivity was determined after solubilizing cells in 0.2 m NaOH, 1% SDS. Nonspecific binding for each time point was determined under the same conditions in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled GnRH agonist (leuprolide) or TRH. After subtraction of nonspecific radioactivity, internalized radioactivity was expressed as a percentage of the total binding. All time points were performed in duplicate in at least three separate experiments. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, COS 1 cells were detached with phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.05% trypsin and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline. Approximately 50,000 cells/well were distributed in a 96-well plate and incubated in the presence or absence of TRH (Sigma), GnRH agonist, leuprolide (Abbott Australasia), or GnRH antagonist, Antide (Sigma) (all 10−6m final concentration) for the specified time period at 37 °C. The coelenterazine (h form) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was added to a final concentration of 5 μm, and readings were collected immediately following this addition. Repeated readings were taken for at least 5–10 min using a custom designed BRET instrument (Berthold, Australia) which allows sequential integration of the signals detected in the 440–500 and 510–590 nm windows. Data are represented as a normalized BRET ratio, which is defined as the BRET ratio for the co-expression of the Rluc and EYFP constructs normalized against the BRET ratio for the Rluc expression construct alone (38Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2000; 97: 3684-3689Google Scholar). The BRET ratio is defined as ((emission at 510–590 nm) − (emission at 440–500 nm) ×cf)/(emission at 440–500 nm), where cfcorresponds to (emission at 510–590 nm/emission at 440–500 nm) for the Rluc construct expressed alone in the same experiment. TRHR fusion proteins with either Rluc or EYFP added to the C terminus were validated to ensure they displayed functional characteristics similar to untagged, wild-type receptors. Confocal microscopy was used to demonstrate that the TRHR/EYFP fusion protein was expressed on the plasma membrane (Fig.1 A, I). Radioligand binding and internalization assays were used as an additional means to measure receptor expression at the cell surface as well as receptor function compared with wild type. Both TRHR/Rluc and TRHR/EYFP were shown to express at the cell surface, and dose displacement binding assays revealed similar IC50 values compared with wild-type (Table I). Furthermore, the rate of TRHR/Rluc fusion receptor internalization was not significantly altered in comparison with untagged receptor in response to TRH (Fig.1 B). The TRHR/EYFP fusion receptor, however, showed 10% less ligand-induced internalization when compared with wild-type TRHRs.Table IIC50 values for wild-type and BRET fusion receptorsReceptorIC50nmTRHR1.38 ± 0.88TRHR/Rluc1.1 ± 0.57TRHR/EYFP5.75 ± 1.77GnRHR1.5 ± 0.71GnRHR/Rluc1.75 ± 1.06GnRHR/EYFP2.25 ± 1.06Whole cell binding assays were carried out in COS 1 cells expressing either wild-type or receptor fusion proteins with increasing amounts of unlabeled agonist (10−11 to 10−6m).

Open table in a new tab Whole cell binding assays were carried out in COS 1 cells expressing either wild-type or receptor fusion proteins with increasing amounts of unlabeled agonist (10−11 to 10−6m). TRHR and GnRHR displacement binding assays were performed using [3H][Me-His2]TRH and [125I][d-Trp6,Pro9,N-Et]GnRH, respectively. Results shown are the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. In order to determine specificity of the interaction observed between TRHRs, EYFP and Rluc fusion constructs of another GPCR, the GnRHR, were generated and validated as described above. A stop codon mutant encoding a GnRHR with a 10-amino acid C-terminal linker described elsewhere (40Heding A. Vrecl M. Bogerd J. McGregor A. Sellar R. Taylor P.L. Eidne K.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 11472-11477Google Scholar) was used. Similar to the TRHR/EYFP, the GnRHR/EYFP was expressed on the plasma membrane, as demonstrated by confocal microscopy, although some cytoplasmic fluorescence was observed, suggesting the presence of an intracellular pool of receptors (Fig.1 A, II). Receptor binding assays and internalization assays in cells expressing each of the GnRHR fusion constructs further illustrated the expression of both GnRHR/EYFP and GnRHR/Rluc at the cell surface. The GnRHR has previously been shown to internalize at a slower rate compared with the TRHR in both HEK 293 and COS cells (42Vrecl M. Anderson L. Hanyaloglu A. McGregor A.M. Groarke A.D. Milligan G. Taylor P.L. Eidne K.A. Mol. Endocrinol... 1998; 12: 1818-1829Google Scholar). Neither the binding (Table I) nor the internalization (Fig. 1 B) characteristics of either of the Rluc- and EYFP-tagged forms of the GnRHR were affected compared with wild-type receptor. To determine whether constitutive interaction occurred between TRHRs in living cells, BRET was measured in COS 1 cells co-expressing either TRHR/Rluc and pcDNA3 vector or TRHR/Rluc and TRHR/EYFP fusion proteins. The ratio of TRHR/Rluc:TRHR/EYFP plasmid concentration used for transfection was 1:4. An excess of fluorescent acceptor molecule expression over donor is thought to favor more efficient energy transfer, and initial experiments using a range of ratios of TRHR/Rluc to TRHR/EYFP DNA showed that the 1:4 ratio resulted in an optimal BRET ratio (data not shown). Following the addition of the cell-permeableRenilla luciferase substrate, coelenterazine, a bioluminescent signal was emitted in both the 440–500- and 510–590-nm filter windows in cells co-expressing TRHR/Rluc and vector. To quantitate the BRET signal, the ratio of light emitted in the 510–590-nm window over that emitted in the 440–510-nm window was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells expressing both TRHR/Rluc and TRHR/EYFP showed an increase in the relative amount of light emitted in the 510–590-nm window (corresponding to the emission peak wavelength of EYFP) and thus an increase in the BRET ratio of 0.12 relative to the BRET ratio obtained for TRHR/Rluc only (Fig. 2). To rule out the possibility that BRET was occurring between different transfected cells that were expressing either one of the TRHR fusion constructs, but not both in the same cell, monotransfectants expressing either TRHR/Rluc or TRHR/EYFP were combined. BRET ratios from these combined cells (data not shown) were compared with cells expressing either TRHR/Rluc alone or co-expressing both tagged constructs. Co-transfection of both TRHR/Rluc and TRHR/EYFP in the same cells was necessary for BRET to occur (Fig. 2), thus providing strong evidence that an actual interaction was occurring in the same cell. Given that the evidence indicated the existence of TRHR complexes, we next wanted to investigate whether agonist activation affected the nature or extent of TRHR aggregation. Following agonist treatment of COS 1 cells co-expressing TRHR/Rluc and TRHR/EYFP, an additional increase (∼65%) in the BRET signal was observed in comparison with untreated co-transfectants (Fig. 2). No increase in the BRET signal was observed when either vehicle or GnRH agonist was used. The effect of receptor activation on TRHR/Rluc and TRHR/EYFP energy transfer increased with time of exposure to agonist, reaching a maximum following a 20-min incubation (Fig.3 A). In addition, a dose-dependent increase in agonist promoted the BRET ratio (Fig. 3 B), with an ED50 of 8.75 ± 1.76 nm, in a similar range to that observed for ligand binding (Table I). To examine the relationship between receptor expression and BRET levels, increasing concentrations of TRHR/Rluc and TRHR/EYFP at a 1:4 ratio were transfected into COS 1 cells. BRET was shown to increase with increasing concentrations of plasmid DNA, reaching a plateau at the concentration of 0.5 μg of TRHR/Rluc with 2.0 μg of TRHR/EYFP (Fig. 4). Levels of receptor expression measured by binding correlated with BRET.Figure 4Effects of TRH receptor expression levels on BRET ratios. COS 1 cells were co-transfected with increasing amounts of plasmid DNA for TRHR/Rluc and TRHR/EYFP, as shown. The BRET ratio (black bars) was measured immediately following the addition of coelenterazine. The same batches of transfected cells were also used in whole cell binding assays (white bars). Results are expressed as the percentage of maximum binding/BRET ratio for each plasmid concentration. Assays were carried out at least three times, and results shown are mean ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The BRET observed between the TRHR/Rluc and TRHR/EYFP did not result from nonspecific interaction between the Rluc and EYFP moieties of the fusion proteins. No increase in the signal was detected when Rluc and EYFP were co-expressed as nonfusion proteins, compared with Rluc expressed alone (data not shown). This is in contrast to the BRET signal generated by a fusion construct of Rluc covalently linked to EYFP used as a positive control, which produced an increased BRET ratio over that of Rluc alone (data not shown). The small increase in the basal levels of the BRET ratio (∼0.03) observed upon co-expression of any Rluc and EYFP fusions or nonfusions is possibly due to a small degree of nonspecific interaction/proximity of Rluc and EYFP moieties as a result of overexpression. GnRHR/Rluc, GnRHR/EYFP, and β2-AR/EYFP fusion constructs were co-expressed with the TRHR fusion proteins, in order to control for the specificity of the TRHR/Rluc and TRHR/EYFP interaction and to rule out the possibility that it is not due to receptor overexpression at the membrane. Co-expression of the TRHR/Rluc and GnRHR/EYFP did not lead to an energy transfer in either untreated cells or in cells treated with either TRH or GnRH agonist alone or both together (Fig.5 A). A similar finding was observed for cells co-expressing the combination of either the TRHR/EYFP with the GnRHR/Rluc or TRHR/Rluc with the β2-AR/EYFP (Fig. 5 A). The low level of BRET observed in COS 1 cells co-expressing both the GnRHR/Rluc and GnRHR/EYFP compared with either GnRHR/Rluc with TRHR/EYFP, GnRHR/EYFP with TRHR/Rluc, or GnRHR/Rluc alone (Fig.5 A) suggests that the GnRHR may not form oligomers in the absence of ligand. However, following the addition of GnRH agonist, an increase in the BRET ratio was observed (Fig. 5 A), indicating that an interaction between GnRHR/Rluc and GnRHR/EYFP does occur. The addition of a GnRH antagonist (Antide; 10−6m), had no effect on BRET (results not shown). To further demonstrate the specificity of the TRHR interaction, untagged TRHR was transfected into COS 1 cells in addition to TRHR/Rluc and TRHR/EYFP. Expression of untagged TRHR was found to markedly reduce the BRET signal generated between the TRHR/Rluc and TRHR/EYFP fusions (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, expression of other untagged GPCRs including the GnRHR, GnRHR/TRHR chimera and protease-activated receptor 1, did not significantly inhibit the BRET signal observed between the two tagged TRH receptors (Fig. 5 B). Untagged receptor expression was confirmed by ligand binding assays (data not shown). Interestingly, no reduction in BRET was observed when the GnRHR/TRHR tail chimera was used, indicating that the TRHR C-terminal tail is not involved in the complex formation of this receptor. This suggests that the ligand-independent BRET observed between TRHR/Rluc and TRHR/EYFP is due to a specific interaction between at least two TRHR monomers and gives evidence for the existence of preformed or constitutive receptor oligomers. Agonist stimulation is known to cause clustering and internalization of the TRHR (10Yu R. Hinkle P.M. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 15745-15750Google Scholar, 42Vrecl M. Anderson L. Hanyaloglu A.

These eicosanoids also cause calcium mobilization and chemotaxis through BLT2, again in contrast to BLT1. These findings suggest that BLT2 functions as a low affinity receptor, with broader ligand specificity for various eicosanoids, and mediates distinct biological and pathophysiological roles from BLT1.

Leukotriene B4((5S,12R)-dihydroxy-6,14-cis-8,10-trans-eicosatetraenoic acid (LTB4))1 is a metabolite of arachidonic acid and is one of the most potent activators of granulocytes and macrophages (1Samuelsson B.

BLT, the LTB4-specific G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), is a target for anti-inflammatory drugs, and many BLT antagonists have been developed and are being evaluated. No BLT antagonists are yet approved available for clinical use; their lack of efficacy may be due in part to the presence of the other LTB4 receptors. We cloned BLT1, a high affinity LTB4 receptor (4Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar), and BLT2, a low affinity LTB4 receptor (5Yokomizo T. Kato K. Terawaki K. Izumi T. Shimizu T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), and showed that BLT1 is expressed almost exclusively in peripheral leukocytes, whereas BLT2 is expressed ubiquitously with the highest expression in spleen. The structural similarities of these receptors (45% amino acid identity) and the low homologies of BLTs to other known GPCRs suggest that these BLTs comprise a novel receptor family. BLT1 and BLT2 form a gene cluster both in human and mouse genomes. The human BLT2 open reading frame overlaps the promoter region of BLT1 (6Kato K. Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Shimizu T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), suggesting the expression of these two LTB4 receptors is tightly intertwined. Human granulocytes, eosinophils, and mononuclear cells express both BLT1 and BLT2 (7Kamohara M. Takasaki J. Matsumoto M. Saito T. Ohishi T. Ishii H. Furuichi K. J. Biol.

In this paper, we report the inhibitory effects of various BLT antagonists and eicosanoids on LTB4 binding using CHO cells stably expressing either human BLT1 or BLT2.

CHO cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged human BLT1 (CHO-FLAG-BLT1) or hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged human BLT2 (CHO-HA-BLT2) were established as described previously (5Yokomizo T. Kato K. Terawaki K. Izumi T. Shimizu T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar,13Noiri E. Yokomizo T. Nakao A. Izumi T. Fujita T. Kimura S. Shimizu T. Proc. Natl. Aca. Sci. U. S.

The cells were cloned by limiting dilution and their expression of the receptors confirmed by staining the cells with antibodies against the epitope added to the amino terminus of the receptors. The cells were fixed with PBS(−) containing 0.5% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 5 min on ice and blocked with PBS(−) containing 2% goat serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were incubated with 30 μg/ml anti-FLAG antibody (clone M5, Eastman Kodak), 10 μg/ml anti-HA antibody (clone CA12-5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), or 30 μg/ml control mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in PBS(−) containing 2% oat serum for 30 min at room temperature, followed by staining with 500 × fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Beckman Coulter, CA) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed twice with PBS(−), and analyzed with flow cytometry, Epics XL (Beckman-Coulter). Cells expressing each receptor were maintained in Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma), 0.3 mg/ml G418 (Sigma), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were harvested and sonicated in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25m sucrose, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA-Na2, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μm pepstatin A. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the remaining supernatants were further centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 60 min. The resulting pellets were used for the binding assay as membrane fractions. The concentrations of the protein were determined by the method of Bradford using a Bio-Rad protein assay. The membrane fractions of CHO cells were examined for [3H]LTB4 binding. The binding mixture (100 μl) contained membrane fractions (20 μg of protein) and 5 nm [3H]LTB4 (34.78 KBq/ml) with/without various concentrations of antagonists or eicosanoids in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, and 0.05% BSA). For determination of the nonspecific binding, unlabeled LTB4was added to the binding mixture to a final concentration of 10 μm. The mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 60 min with gentle agitation followed by rapid filtration through GF/C filters (Packard) and washing with 3 ml of binding buffer. The radioactivity levels of the filters were determined with a Top Count scintillation counter (Packard). CHO cells were loaded with 3 μm Fura-2′AM (Dojin, Kumamoto, Japan) in a modified Hepes-Tyrode's BSA buffer (25 mmHepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 12 mmNaHCO3, 5.6 mmd-glucose, 0.37 mm NaH2PO4, 0.49 mmMgCl2, 0.01% (w/v) cremophore, and 0.1% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA (Fraction V, Bayer)) at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were washed twice and resuspended in Hepes-Tyrode's BSA buffer (without cremophore) at a density of 1 × 106cells/ml. 0.5 ml of the cell suspension was applied to a CAF-100 system (Jasco), and 5 μl of ligand solution was added. The ligands were dissolved in Hepes-Tyrode's BSA buffer after evaporation of the stock solution in ethanol under nitrogen stream and used immediately. Intracellular Ca2+ concentration was measured by the ratio of emission fluorescence of 500 nm by excitation at 340 and 380 nm. CHO cells expressing hBLT1 or hBLT2 were examined for their chemotactic responses as described previously (4Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Briefly, 8 × 104 cells were left to migrate toward the ligands for 4 h through fibronectin-coated filters in a 96-well Boyden chamber. After migration, the cells on the upper side of the filter were wiped off and stained with Diff-Quik reagent, and the migrated cells were quantified by measuring theA 595 nm using a microplate reader. All figures shown contain representative data from at least two independent experiments with similar results. In the light of our knowledge the actions of BLT antagonists that have been developed as anti-inflammatory drugs has to be re-evaluated. Most were characterized using human peripheral leukocytes before the identification of two kinds of LTB4 receptors, BLT1 and BLT2, and their coexpression in peripheral leukocytes (5Yokomizo T. Kato K. Terawaki K. Izumi T. Shimizu T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), monocytes, and eosinophils (7Kamohara M. Takasaki J. Matsumoto M. Saito T. Ohishi T. Ishii H. Furuichi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27000-27004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To distinguish the effects of BLT antagonists on these two receptors, we examined their inhibitory effects on [3H]LTB4 binding to the membrane fractions of CHO cells stably expressing either human BLT1 or BLT2. CHO cells are useful for this purpose because they do not express any intrinsic receptors for LTB4, as revealed by [3H]LTB4 binding and calcium mobilization assays (data not shown). Receptors tagged with FLAG or HA sequences at their amino termini were introduced into the cells, and several clones stably expressing each receptor were isolated. The proper expression of the receptors on the cell surface was confirmed by staining the cells with antibodies specific to the tag, which was followed by flow cytometry (Fig. 1). The membrane fractions of these cells (20 μg of membrane protein) were examined for their binding with 5 nm[3H]LTB4. Fig.2 shows the competition of 5 nm [3H]LTB4 binding by various BLT antagonists. LTB4 binding to BLT1 was inhibited by CP 105696, ZK 158252, CP 195543, and U75302 in a dose-dependent manner but not by 10 μm LY 255283 or LY 223982. In contrast, LTB4 binding to BLT2 was inhibited by ZK 158252, LY 255283, and CP 195543 but not by 10 μm U75302, CP105695 or LY 223982. We also examined their agonistic activities on these receptors by calcium mobilization and found that 1 and 10 μm U75302 acts as a weak agonist on human BLT1, and 1 and 10 μm CP 195543 acts as a weak agonist on human BLT2 (data not shown).Figure 2Inhibition of [3H] LTB4 binding to BLT1 or BLT2 by BLT antagonists. 5 nm [3H]LTB4binding to the membrane preparations (20 μg of membrane protein) from CHO-FLAG-BLT1 (A) and CHO-HA-BLT2 (B) cells was competed with various concentrations of BLT antagonists. Data are represented as % inhibition compared with 10 μmLTB4 as 100%. In CHO-FLAG-BLT1 cells, total binding and nonspecific binding were 62424 ± 563 and 1818 ± 72 dpm, respectively. In CHO-HA-BLT2 cells, total binding and nonspecific binding were 5070 ± 236 and 1374 ± 123 dpm, respectively (n = 3, average ± S.D.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The membrane fraction of HEK 293 cells transfected with human BLT2 cDNA exhibited a specific and saturable binding for [3H]LTB4 with a K d value of 23 nm, which is higher than that for human BLT1 by 20-fold (5Yokomizo T. Kato K. Terawaki K. Izumi T. Shimizu T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Thus, at that time we concluded that BLT2 is a low affinity receptor for LTB4. In the present study, we examined the inhibition by various eicosanoids of [3H]LTB4 binding to the membrane fractions of CHO cells stably expressing BLT1 or BLT2. Fig.3 shows the inhibition of 5 nm [3H]LTB4 binding by various eicosanoids at a concentration of 5 μm. LTB4binding to BLT1 is very specific, because only LTB4, 20-hydroxy-LTB4, and 12-epi-LTB4showed significant competitions at this concentration (Fig.3 A). These results are consistent with our previous results using the membrane fractions of COS-7 cells transiently transfected with BLT1 (4Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the binding of LTB4 to BLT2 was inhibited by various eicosanoids (Fig. 3 B). 12(R)- and 12(S)-HETE, 12(S)-HPETE, 15(S)-HETE, and 15(S)-HPETE in addition to LTB4, 20-hydroxy LTB4, and 12-epi-LTB4 showed significant inhibition (>50%) of 5 nm [3H]LTB4binding. Next, we tested various concentrations of LTB4, 20-hydroxy-LTB4, 12(S)-HPETE, 12(S)-HETE, 12(R)-HETE, and 15(S)-HETE in the competition with [3H]LTB4 binding to BLT1 and BLT2. Only LTB4 and 20-hydroxy LTB4showed dose-dependent inhibitions of LTB4binding to BLT1 (Fig. 4 A). In the case of BLT2, however, all of the eicosanoids tested exhibited dose-dependent inhibition of LTB4, with a rank order of LTB4 > 12(S)-HETE > 12(S)-HPETE > 12(R)-HETE > 15(S)-HETE > 20-hydroxy LTB4 (Fig.4 B). These results clearly show that the recognition of the ligands by BLT1 and BLT2 differs, with more promiscuity in BLT2.Figure 4Inhibition of [3H] LTB4 binding to BLT1 or BLT2 by eicosanoids. 5 nm [3H]LTB4binding to the membrane preparations (20 μg of membrane protein) from CHO-FLAG-BLT1 (A) and CHO-HA-BLT2 (B) cells was competed with various concentrations of eicosanoids (n= 3, average ± S.D.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next examined whether these eicosanoids could activate intracellular signaling through these two receptors. We used a calcium mobilization assay, because it is a very sensitive and quantitative method for detecting LTB4-BLT interaction. In CHO-FLAG-BLT1 cells, only LTB4 exhibited a robust increase in intracellular calcium concentrations (Fig.5 A). The one exception was seen in case of 12(S)-HPETE, where there was a very slight signal seen at 10 μm (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, all of the ligands that were able to bind to BLT2 (Fig. 4 B) exhibited significant increases in intracellular calcium concentrations in CHO-HA-BLT2 cells, showing that these eicosanoids are active on BLT2 (Fig. 5, A and B). Fig. 5, C andD, shows dose-response curves of increase in calcium concentrations on CHO-FLAG-BLT1 and CHO-HA-BLT2 cells, respectively. 12(S)-HETE and 15(S)-HETE up to a concentration of 10 μm did not induce measurable changes in intracellular calcium through BLT1 (Fig. 5 C). On the other hand, these eicosanoids exhibited dose-dependent increases in calcium concentrations in CHO-HA-BLT2 cells (Fig. 5 D). 12-epi-LTB4, a 12(S) epimer of LTB4, acts as a full agonist for BLT1 and BLT2 (Fig. 5,B and C), but a higher concentration of 12-epi-LTB4 is required. These results clearly show that BLT2 is able to bind to various eicosanoids and to transduce intracellular signaling. As LTB4 is a potent chemoattractant for granulocytes, eosinophils, and macrophages, and CHO cells expressing BLT1 or BLT2 migrate to LTB4 in vitro (4Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 5Yokomizo T. Kato K. Terawaki K. Izumi T. Shimizu T. J. Exp.

Chem. 2000; 275: 27000-27004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we asked whether other eicosanoids could evoke chemotactic responses through BLT1 and BLT2. CHO cells expressing BLT1 showed clear chemotactic activities toward very low concentration of LTB4 and high concentration (>10 μm) of 12(R)-HETE and 12(S)-HETE, as shown in Fig.6 A. In the case of BLT2, the optimum concentrations of LTB4 and 12(S)-HETE are close, and the 12(S)-HETE is more effective than 12(R)-HETE (Fig. 6 B). The dose-response curves of LTB4 and 12(S)-HETE in CHO-BLT2 cells are bell-shaped as expected in in vitro chemotaxis assays. 12-epi-LTB4 also induced chemotaxis both in CHO-BLT1 and CHO-BLT2 cells, with higher optimum concentrations than LTB4. CHO cells transfected with an empty vector, pcDNA3, as a control did not show any chemotaxis toward LTB4, 12(S)-HETE, 12(R)-HETE, or 12-epi-LTB4 (Fig. 6 C). LTB4 is biologically important for the clearance of microorganisms or foreign bodies by activating and recruiting granulocytes to the inflamed lesions (14Ford-Hutchinson A. Doig M.V. Shipley M.E. Smith M.J. Nature. 1980; 286: 264-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). Overproduction of LTB4, however, is also involved in various inflammatory diseases including psoriasis (15Iversen L. Kragballe K. Ziboh V.A. Skin Pharmacol. 1997; 10: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), bronchial asthma (16Turner C.R. Breslow R. Conklyn M.J. Andresen C.J. Patterson D.K. Lopez A.A. Owens B. Lee P.

Attempts to understand the biological functions of LTB4 and to develop potent and selective BLT antagonists would be assisted by the molecular identification of LTB4 receptors. Several groups including ours have cloned and characterized two distinct LTB4 receptors, BLT1 and BLT2. BLT1 (4Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T.

Very recently, BLT2, with a structural similarity to BLT1, was identified as a low affinity receptor for LTB4 (5Yokomizo T. Kato K. Terawaki K. Izumi T. Shimizu T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 7Kamohara M. Takasaki J. Matsumoto M. Saito T. Ohishi T. Ishii H. Furuichi K. J. Biol.

Kotarsky K. Olde B. Owman C. J. Biol. Chem.. 2000; Google Scholar), but the clear explanations for this discrepancy are not available. TheBLT2 gene is localized very close to theBLT1 gene both in human and mouse, suggesting that these two receptors are linked genetically (6Kato K. Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Shimizu T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 27Nilsson N.E. Tryselius Y. Owman C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). BLT2 shows a relatively ubiquitous expression with the highest level in the spleen, followed by the liver, ovary, and peripheral leukocytes (5Yokomizo T. Kato K. Terawaki K. Izumi T. Shimizu T. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 421-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 7Kamohara M. Takasaki J. Matsumoto M. Saito T. Ohishi T. Ishii H. Furuichi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27000-27004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis, BLT1 and BLT2 have been shown to be coexpressed in human granulocytes, mononuclear cells, and eosinophils (7Kamohara M. Takasaki J. Matsumoto M. Saito T. Ohishi T. Ishii H. Furuichi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27000-27004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A number of papers have reported the inhibitory effects of various BLT antagonists on LTB4 binding and various LTB4-induced phenomena, but most of the results were obtained using leukocytes that intrinsically express both BLT1 and BLT2. To correctly understand the pharmacological characters of BLT1 and BLT2, we introduced the expression vectors for these receptors into CHO cells, which do not express any intrinsic LTB4 receptors, and compared the effects of various BLT antagonists and eicosanoids. These receptors are properly expressed on the cell surface as revealed by flow cytometry (Fig. 1). Binding assays using the fractionated cell membrane revealed clear differences in pharmacological profiles of various BLT antagonists on BLT1 and BLT2. CP 105696 and U75302 effectively inhibited [3H]LTB4 binding to BLT1, but they did not inhibit LTB4 binding to BLT2 (Fig. 2), showing that these compounds are specific to BLT1. In addition, U75302 acts as a weak agonist on BLT1, because it increased intracellular calcium in CHO-BLT1 cells (data not shown). On the other hand, LY 255283 inhibited [3H]LTB4 binding to BLT2 but not to BLT1. CP 195543 and ZK 158252 inhibited [3H]LTB4binding to both receptors, but CP 195543 at 1 μmincreased intracellular calcium in CHO-BLT2 cells (data not shown). Thus, CP 195543 acts as an antagonist for BLT1 but a weak agonist for BLT2. Various BLT antagonists have been developed and examined for their effects on inflammatory animal models, but no compounds are available for clinical use. If the expression/function of these two receptors are intertwined, as would be predicted based on their juxtaposition in the genome, a clinically important effect may lie in a compound that has independent effects on each receptor as well as one that blocks both. Our studies point to the need to re-evaluate past studies in light of the independent actions of the compound on each receptor and to find a way to screen future candidate compounds. We next examined the ligand specificity for BLT1 and BLT2. From initial screenings of various eicosanoids on ligand binding assays (Fig. 3), we selected several hydroxy- or hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids to examine carefully the dose-dependent inhibition of [3H]LTB4 binding to BLT1 and BLT2. To our surprise, some of these eicosanoids effectively inhibited LTB4 binding to BLT2 (Fig. 4). The rank order of potency in binding to BLT2 is LTB4 > 12(S)-HETE > 12(S)-HPETE > 12(R)-HETE > 15(S)-HETE > 20-hydroxy LTB4 (Fig.4 B), which is different from the order of potency in binding to BLT1 (LTB4 > 20-hydroxy-LTB4≫12(R)-HETE, Fig. 4 A (4Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar)). We next examined the agonistic activities of these eicosanoids using a calcium mobilization assay and found that some of them act as agonists on BLT2 (Fig. 5). Although high concentrations of the ligands are required, CHO-BLT2 cells exhibited clear calcium responses toward 1 μm 12(S)-HETE or 15(S)-HETE. 12(S)-HETE and 12(R)-HETE also induced significant cell migration in CHO-BLT2 cells at lower concentrations than for CHO-BLT1 cells (Fig. 6), suggesting that BLT2 recognizes these eicosanoids and transduces intracellular signaling at physiological concentrations. Despite the broad interests in leukotriene receptors, limited information is available on receptors for HETE and HPETE. Among these receptors, 12(S)-HETE binding sites have been well characterized in human epidermal and carcinoma cells (28Arenberger P. Kemeny L. Ruzicka T. Epithelial Cell Biol. 1993; 2: 1-6PubMed Google Scholar, 29Arenberger P. Kemeny L. Rupec R. Bieber T. Ruzicka T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 2469-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 30Arenberger P. Ruzicka T. Kemeny L. Skin Pharmacol. 1991; 4: 272-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). High affinity 12(S)-HETE binding sites in human skin were reported, and K d values for 12(S)-HETE were in the nm range. The rank order of potency in inhibition of [3H]12(S)-HETE binding is 12(S)-HETE > 12(R)-HETE ≥ LTB4, which is similar to that of BLT2. In murine B16 melanoma cells, 12(S)-HETE-dependent activation of protein kinase C is mediated by a GPCR and dependent on Gi-like G-protein (31Liu B. Khan W.A. Hannun Y.A. Timar J. Taylor J.D. Lundy S. Butovich I. Honn K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9323-9327Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). 12(S)-HETE-binding protein in the cytosolic and nuclear fractions of Lewis lung carcinoma cells was characterized and shown to interact as a heterodimer with steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) in the presence of 12(S)-HETE (32Kurahashi Y. Herbertsson H. Soderstrom M. Rosenfeld M.G. Hammarstrom S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5779-5783Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) was also reported to interact with 12(S)-HETE (33Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1870) Google Scholar). These results suggest that 12(S)-HETE may possess a dual receptor system, cell surface GPCRs, and intranuclear transcriptional factors. BLT2 can interact with high concentrations of 12(S)-HETE, but theK d of BLT2 for 12(S)-HETE is higher than the reported high affinity 12(S)-HETE receptor(s) in keratinocytes and melanocytes. The selectivity of BLT2 in the recognition of 12(S)-HETE and 15(S)-HETE and the structural information of BLT2 may be helpful for the identification of the high affinity GPCR for HETEs. We also showed by calcium mobilization and chemotaxis assays that 12-epi-LTB4 is active both on BLT1 and BLT2. There are no published reports on the in vivo occurrence or biological functions of 12-epi-LTB4, but it is clear that it acts as an agonist for BLT1 and BLT2 in heterologously expressed systems. Further study is required on the biosynthesis and functions of 12-epi-LTB4. In summary, we have revealed the specificity of various BLT antagonists on two LTB4 receptors and identified the novel activation of BLT2 by various HETEs and HPETEs. These findings will lead to the development of novel BLT antagonists that may be more specific and therefore more potent as anti-inflammatory drugs, also raising the possibility of the identification of other as yet unknown eicosanoid receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2148281583,"Although a number of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptor subtypes have been cloned, limited studies have been performed to elucidate subtypes that subserve specific actions of this eicosanoid, in part because of a paucity of selective receptor antagonists. Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antisense oligonucleotides, we examined which prostaglandin E2receptor (EP receptor) subtypes are expressed in sensory neurons and which mediate the PGE2-induced increase in cAMP production and augmentation of peptide release. Reverse transcription-PCR of cDNA isolated from rat sensory neurons grown in culture revealed PCR products for the EP1, EP2, EP3C, and EP4 receptor subtypes but not the EP3A or EP3B. Preexposing neuronal cultures for 48 h to antisense oligonucleotides of EP3C and EP4 mRNA diminished expression of the respective receptors by ∼80%, abolished the PGE2-stimulated production of cAMP, and blocked the ability of PGE2 to augment release of immunoreactive substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide. Pretreating with individual antisense against the EP2, EP3C, or EP4 receptors or combinations of missense oligonucleotides had no effect on PGE2-induced activity. Treatment with antisense to EP3C and EP4 receptor subtypes did not alter the ability of forskolin to increase cAMP or enhance peptide release. These results demonstrate that sensory neurons are capable of expressing multiple EP receptor subtypes but that only the EP3C and EP4 receptors mediate PGE2-induced sensitization of sensory neurons.

Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 205-229PubMed Google Scholar, 2Narumiya S. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1193-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). These receptors are G-protein-coupled, and binding of agonists results in activation of various transduction cascades depending on the receptor subtype activated and the cells being studied. Activation of the EP1 receptor in kidney tubule cells increases the concentration of intracellular calcium, phosphoinositol turnover, and PKC activity (3Hebert R.L. Jacobson H.R. Breyer M.D. Am. J.

The EP3 receptor undergoes post-transcriptional RNA splicing to produce multiple EP3 isoforms, and activation of these splice variants can increase calcium mobilization or either stimulate or inhibit cAMP production (9Namba T.

Because subtypes of the EP receptor can be linked to different transduction cascades in different types of cells, it is critical to determine which receptors and receptor-associated signal transduction pathways are responsible for specific physiological actions of E-series prostaglandins. Although PGE2 has a number of diverse physiological actions (12Coleman R.A. Kennedy I. Humphrey P.P.A. Bunce K. Lumley P. Emmett J.C. Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry. 3. Pergamon Press, Oxford1990: 643-714Google Scholar), its role in pain and inflammation is of primary importance. Indeed, both the analgesic and the anti-inflammatory actions of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are attributed to their ability to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis (13Vane J.R. Nature. 1971; 231: 232-235Crossref Scopus (7240) Google Scholar). In addition, PGE2 is produced at sites of tissue injury (14Hamberg M. Jonsson C.E. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1973; 87: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and administration of prostaglandins produces vasodilation and edema and augments pain perception in animals and in humans (15Campbell W.B. Halushka P.V. Hardman J.G. Limbird L.E. Molinoff P.B. Ruddon R.W. Gilman A.G. Goodman and Gilman's the Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1996: 601-616Google Scholar). The proinflammatory actions of PGE2 result, in part, from a direct action of this eicosanoid on sensory neurons. In in situ preparations, E-series prostaglandins augment the firing of sensory neurons in response to noxious stimuli (16Martin H.A. Basbaum A.I. Kwait G.C. Goetzl E.J. Levine J.D. Neuroscience. 1987; 22: 651-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 17Kumazawa T. Mizumura K. Koda H. Fukusako H. J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 75: 2361-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Furthermore, exposing sensory neurons in culture to PGE2 increases cAMP content (18Hingtgen C.M. Waite K.J. Vasko M.R. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5411-5419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), increases the number of action potentials elicited by a depolarizing stimulus (19Nicol G.D. Cui M. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1994; 480: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and augments the evoked release of the neuropeptides (18Hingtgen C.M. Waite K.J. Vasko M.R. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5411-5419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Vasko M.R. Campbell W.B. Waite K.J. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4987-4997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the fact that PGE2-induced sensitization of sensory neurons has been extensively studied, the EP receptors expressed on sensory neurons and which subtypes mediate sensitization remain unknown. Consequently, we used RT-PCR to ascertain which receptor subtype mRNAs are expressed in sensory neurons. We also used antisense oligonucleotides to selectively reduce expression of EP receptor subtypes and examine whether this “knockdown” alters PGE2-induced increases in cAMP and augmentation of release of immunoreactive substance P (iSP) and immunoreactive calcitonin gene-related peptide (iCGRP). We choose to use antisense, because EP receptor subtypes have highly conserved structures with ligands often activating multiple receptor subtypes (1Coleman R.A. Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 205-229PubMed Google Scholar, 2Narumiya S. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1193-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), and thus there are limited pharmacological tools to distinguish subtypes. Our data provide novel evidence that activation of the EP3C and EP4 receptors mediates the PGE2-induced sensitization of sensory neurons, suggesting that multiple receptor subtypes can subserve the same function. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium,l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, Hanks' balanced salt solution, and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Nerve growth factor was purchased from Harlan Bioproducts for Science, Inc. (Indianapolis, IN). Prostaglandin E2, butaprost, 1-OH-PGE1, and sulprostone were obtained from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). Peptides were obtained from Peninsula Laboratory (Belmont, CA). Capsaicin, forskolin, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), and other routine chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Capsaicin and prostaglandins were initially dissolved in 1-methyl, 2-pyrrolidione (Sigma) to a concentration of 10 mm and then diluted to appropriate concentration in perfusion buffer. In no instances does this vehicle at the dilutions used alter cAMP or neuropeptide release. Substance P antiserum was raised in our laboratory (21Pang I.H. Vasko M.R. Brain Res. 1986; 376: 268-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), whereas the CGRP antiserum; the EP1, EP3A, and EP4 antiserum; the EP2 antiserum; the IP antiserum; and the EP3 antiserum, which recognizes a conserved region of EP3 receptors, were generous gifts from Michael J. Iadarola (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), Hitoshi Shichi (Wayne State University), John Regan (University of Arizona), Micah Doty (Cayman Chemicals), and Hsin-Hsiung Tai (University of Kentucky), respectively. Rat kidney cDNA was a gift from H. R. Besch, Jr. (Indiana University). Actin antibody was purchased from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Cultures of embryonic rat sensory neurons were prepared using a modification of previously described methods (20Vasko M.R. Campbell W.B. Waite K.J. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4987-4997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, sensory neurons were dissociated from the dorsal root ganglion of 15–17-day rat embryos using trypsin and mechanical agitation. Sensory neurons were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 250 ng/ml nerve growth factor, 50 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin, and the mitotic inhibitors, 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine (50 μm) and uridine (150 μm). Cells were plated in 24-well poly-d-lysine (100 μg/ml)-coated culture plates at ∼150,000 cells/well. The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 9–11 days, and growth medium was changed every second day. Cultures of adult dorsal root ganglia cells were prepared using a modification of the method of Lindsay (22Lindsay R.M. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2394-2405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 150–250 g were sacrificed with CO2. The dorsal root ganglias from each rat were collected in sterile calcium- and magnesium-free modified Hanks' balanced salt solution. The dorsal root ganglias were digested with 0.125% collagenase in growth medium consisting of F-12 supplemented with 10% horse serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin, and the mitotic inhibitors 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridine (50 μm) and uridine (150 μm) at 37 °C for 2 h. Cells were dissociated by mechanical agitation and plated in 24-well culture plates coated with poly-d-lysine and laminin at ∼15,000 cells/well. The cultures were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 3% CO2 for 7 days in the presence of 250 ng/ml nerve growth factor. The Animal Care and Use Committee (Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN) approved all procedures used in these studies. For the release experiments, cells were washed twice with HEPES buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, 135 mmNaCl, 3.5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 3.3 mmd-glucose, 0.1 mm ascorbic acid, 1 μm phosphoramidon, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4. The cells then were exposed to HEPES buffer or HEPES plus 100 nm PGE2 or 1 μm forskolin for 10 min prior to and throughout the first and second incubations (i.e. basal and stimulated). The doses and times of exposure for PGE2 and forskolin were based on our previous work with prostanoids (18Hingtgen C.M. Waite K.J. Vasko M.R. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5411-5419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Vasko M.R. Campbell W.B. Waite K.J. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4987-4997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide release was evoked during the second 10-min incubation by exposing cultures to 30 nm capsaicin. Following the 10-min stimulation period, basal release was reestablished by exposing the cells to HEPES buffer for 10 min. The supernatants were collected following each incubation, and iSP and iCGRP were quantitated using radioimmunoassay as previously described (20Vasko M.R. Campbell W.B. Waite K.J. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4987-4997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For cAMP experiments, cells were washed twice with 0.5 ml of HEPES buffer containing the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, IBMX. Following a 20-min incubation in 0.5 ml of HEPES buffer containing 2 mmIBMX in the presence or absence of forskolin, PGE2, or other prostanoid agonists, the cells were collected in 0.5 ml of 0.1m HCl, boiled for 3 min, and pelleted. The supernatant was decanted, frozen, and lyophilized. The content of the immunoreactive cAMP (icAMP) was assayed by radioimmunoassay (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the nonacetylated protocol. Analysis of variance was used to compare the effects of different treatments on the neuropeptide release and cAMP production, and if a significant difference was observed, the Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc test was performed. The significance level for all tests was set atp < 0.05. Cells were washed twice in sterile phosphate-buffered saline and disrupted by freezing in 100–200 μl of lysis buffer containing 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% bromphenol blue. Equivalent amounts of protein from cell lysates, as determined by using the Bio-Rad protein detection kit, were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.2% Tween 20 overnight and incubated for 24 h at 4 °C with polyclonal antibody to the EP1, EP2, EP3A, EP3, EP4, and IP receptor subtypes or to actin followed by incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. Immunoreactive bands were developed by an ECL kit and visualized by exposure to Eastman Kodak Co. LS X-Omat film. Quantification of the immunoreactive bands was analyzed using NIH-Image software. Student's t test was used to compare effects of antisense or missense treatment on receptor expression. Total RNA was isolated from sensory neurons in culture using a QuickPrep Total RNA Extraction Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Messenger RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Superscript II RNase H Reverse Transcriptase Kit; Life Technologies). Total RNA (∼1–5 μg) and 0.5 μg of oligo(dT)12–18 primer were heated to 70 °C for 10 min and briefly chilled on ice. After primer annealing, the following were added: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm dNTP, and 40 units of RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor. The reaction incubated for 50 min at 42 °C and then for 15 min at 70 °C. An aliquot of each reaction was subsequently used as template for a PCR. The primers were designed to be selective for the PGE2 and PGI2receptors, and the sequences used were as follows: EP1 (336 base pairs (bp)), 5′-CGCAGGGTTCACGCACACGA-3′ (nucleotides 865–884) and 5′-CACTGTGCCGGGAACTACGC-3′ (nucleotides 1182–1201) (23Arakawa T.

The PCR primers for the EP3C receptor are based on primers for an EP receptor originally classified as EP3B (25Takeuchi K. Takahashi N. Abe T. Abe K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); however, the receptor is identical to the mouse EP3C receptor (11Irie A. Segi E. Sugimoto Y. Namba T. Harazono A. Honda A. Watabe A. Negishi M. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The PCR mixture contained a cDNA template derived from total RNA, 1 unit of recombinantTaq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.), 50 pmol each of 5′- and 3′-primers (Life Technologies), 0.2 mm dNTP, in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgSO4 in a volume of 50 μl. The PCR was performed using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Thermocycler (model 2400) as follows: 94 °C for 120 s and then 37 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 120 s followed by 74 °C for 10 min. Samples were applied on 1% agarose gel prestained with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Antisense oligonucleotides were designed to be complementary to the PGE2 receptor subtypes EP2, EP3C, and EP4. Missense control oligonucleotides were also synthesized to correspond to antisense sequences except for pairs of bases that have been switched. Oligonucleotide sequences were as follows: EP2, antisense 5′-GCCTGGAGTCATTGA-3′ (bases 56–70) and missense 5′-CGCGTGAGTCTATGA-3′; EP3C, antisense 5′-GATGGCCTGCCCTTT-3′ (bases 1101–1125) and missense 5′-TAGGGCGCTCCTCCTT-3′; EP4, antisense 5-GACTCCGGGGATGGA-3′ (bases 4–18) and missense 5′-GACCTCGGGAGTGAG-3′. Oligonucleotides were synthesized (Life Technologies Custom Primers) with phosphorothioate linkages to prevent nuclease degradation. Sensory neurons in culture were exposed to 1 μm antisense or missense oligonucleotide in growth medium or growth medium alone for 48 h with a change of medium and oligonucleotide at 24 h. To ascertain which PGE2 receptor subtype mRNAs were found in sensory neurons, total RNA from cultured embryonic or adult sensory neurons was reverse-transcribed and subjected to PCR in the presence of primers for the PGE2receptor subtypes EP1, EP2, EP3A, EP3B, EP3C, EP4, the PGI2receptor, IP, or histone protein H3.3. Fig.1, A and B, depicts the PCR products from embryonic and adult neurons, corresponding to the EP1, EP2, EP3C, EP4, and IP receptors that were detected in the gel at the expected sizes of 336, 369, 413, 423, and 431 bp, respectively. PCR products for the EP3A and EP3B receptor from sensory neurons were not detected. To confirm that this lack of PCR products to the EP3A and EP3B receptor subtypes was not secondary to amplification problems, we performed RT-PCR under identical conditions using total RNA isolated from the rat kidney, since EP3A and EP3B receptors are highly expressed in this tissue (24Takeuchi K. Abe T. Takahashi N. Abe K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 27Schmid A. Thierauch K.H. Schleuning W.D. Dinter H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 1 C, EP3A and EP3B receptor PCR products were detected with approximate sizes of 309 and 453 bp, respectively. As the external control, replicate samples of histone H3.3 PCR product were detected in sensory neurons with an expected size of 231 bp. The expression of PGE2 receptor proteins in sensory neurons also were examined using antibodies that recognize the EP1, EP2, EP3, EP4, and IP receptors. Immunoblots with molecular masses of ∼65, 67, 60, 63, and 66 kDa were detected when protein isolated from embryonic sensory neurons was separated by gel electrophoresis (Fig.1 D). These molecular masses correspond to the sizes of the EP1, EP2, EP3, EP4, and IP receptors (28Huang C. Tai H.H. Biochem.

No immunoreactive band for the EP3A receptor was expressed by sensory neurons (data not shown), further supporting the RT-PCR finding that the EP3A receptor was not expressed by sensory neurons. We used antisense oligonucleotides that inhibit formation of specific EP receptor subtypes to determine which receptors mediate PGE2-induced increases in the production of cAMP. Sensory neurons in culture were exposed for 48 h to medium alone or to medium containing 1 μm antisense or missense oligonucleotide to the EP2, EP3C, and/or EP4, and then the PGE2-stimulated production of cAMP was measured. We focused on these receptor subtypes because cloned rat or mouse EP2, EP3C, and EP4 receptors have been shown to increase cAMP production (5Boie Y. Stocco R. Sawyer N. Slipetz D.M.

In untreated neuronal cultures, exposure to 100 nm PGE2 and 2 mm IBMX for 20 min significantly increased the content of icAMP 2.5-fold over cells treated only with IBMX (Fig.2, A and B). In cultures treated with individual antisense oligonucleotides directed toward mRNA for EP2, EP3C, or EP4 receptor subtypes or to missense oligonucleotides, 100 nm PGE2 also significantly increased cAMP production (Fig. 2 A), suggesting that reducing expression of individual receptor subtypes had no effect on the PGE2-stimulated production of cAMP. Consequently, we further examined whether simultaneously decreasing expression of multiple receptor subtypes would attenuate the actions of PGE2. When neuronal cultures were pretreated for 48 h with 1 μm of each antisense directed at mRNA for the EP2, EP3C, and EP4 receptors, the effects of 100 nmPGE2 were completely abolished in that icAMP levels were 3.1 ± 0.5 pmol/well (n = 17; Fig. 2 B). In a similar manner, when sensory neurons were exposed to antisense oligonucleotides directed toward mRNA for only the EP3C and EP4 receptor subtypes, exposure to 100 nm PGE2 did not increase the content of icAMP (3.1 ± 0.5 pmol/well,n = 13). In contrast, antisense oligonucleotides directed toward the EP2 and EP4 receptor subtypes did not significantly attenuate the effect of the prostanoid, since in these cultures icAMP was elevated to 5.8 ± 0.5 pmol/well (n = 9). Exposing sensory neurons to any combination of missense oligonucleotides had no effect on the PGE2-stimulated production of icAMP. These results suggest that simultaneous loss of the EP3C and EP4 receptor subtypes is necessary to prevent PGE2 from increasing the formation of cAMP in sensory neurons. Because it is possible that the inhibitory effect of the combination of antisense oligonucleotides could reflect a lack of specificity or toxicity (31Brysch W. Schlingensiepen K.H. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1994; 14: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we examined whether cultures exposed to EP3C and EP4 antisense oligonucleotides were capable of producing cAMP by treating cells with forskolin, a direct activator of adenylyl cyclase. In untreated neuronal cultures, a 20-min exposure to 1 μmforskolin in the presence of 2 mm IBMX increased the content of icAMP from 2.2 ± 0.3 pmol/well (n = 20) to 30.2 ± 1.9 pmol/well (n = 20; Fig.3). In neuronal cultures pretreated for 48 h with antisense oligonucleotides to the EP3C and EP4 subtype mRNA or missenses, 1 μm forskolin increased the content of icAMP to 29.3 ± 3.3 pmol/well (n = 17) and to 35.1 ± 3.8 pmol/well (n = 12), respectively. Thus, treating cells with antisense or missense oligonucleotides did not block the ability of the sensory neurons to produce cAMP. Since our antisense experiments suggested that activation of either the EP3C or EP4 receptor results in the enhanced production of cAMP, we addressed whether the potential activation of these receptors with the putative EP receptor agonists, butaprost, 1-OH-PGE1, or sulprostone, would similarly enhance cAMP production in sensory neurons. As in the above experiments, treating cells with 100 nm PGE2 significantly increased icAMP content 1.4-fold from 4.0 ± 0.2 pmol/well (n = 8) to 5.9 ± 0.6 (n = 8). In contrast, exposure to a 100 nm concentration of the putative EP1/EP3 agonist, sulprostone, or either a 100 nm or 1 μmconcentration of the EP2/EP4 agonist, 1-OH-PGE1, had no effect on basal icAMP production; icAMP content was 2.7 ± 0.5 pmol/well (n = 8), 3.4 ± 0.2 pmol/well (n = 8), or 4.2 ± 0.4 pmol/well (n = 8), respectively. Exposure to a 100 nmconcentration of the EP2 agonist, butaprost, did not increase icAMP production (4.8 ± 0.4 pmol/well, n = 8), whereas exposure to 1 μm butaprost significantly enhanced icAMP levels to 10.6 ± 1.0 pmol/well (n = 8). Since micromolar concentrations of butaprost can bind to prostaglandin receptor subtypes other than EP2 (57Kiriyama M. Ushikubi F. Kobayashi T. Hirata M. Sugimoto Y. Narumiya S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), we addressed whether the increase in cAMP content stimulated by 1 μm butaprost was secondary to actions at the EP2, EP3C, or EP4 receptor subtype. Pretreating neuronal cultures for 48 h with 1 μmantisense directed at the EP2 receptor or at the EP3C and EP4 receptors in combination significantly reduced the butaprost-induced increase in icAMP content. Exposure to antisense directed toward the EP2 receptor decreased the 1 μm butaprost-stimulated icAMP content from 9.2 ± 0.8 pmol/well (n = 11) in untreated cells to 5.2 ± 0.3 pmol/well (n = 8), and exposure to antisense toward the EP3C and EP4 receptors also reduced the icAMP content to 6.4 ± 1.1 pmol/well (n = 9). Although the butaprost-induced increase in cAMP content was reduced by either treatment, the agonist still significantly increased the levels of the second messenger above control.

In this study the role of the HBx protein in activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) was investigated as a possible cause of anti-apoptosis in liver cells. HBx relieved serum deprivation-induced and pro-apoptic stimuli-induced apoptosis in Chang liver (CHL) cells. Treatment with 1-d-3-deoxy-3-fluoro-myo-inositol, an antagonist to PI3K, which blocks the formation of 3′-phosphorylated phosphatidyl inositol in CHL cells transformed by HBx(CHL-X) but not normal Chang liver (CHL) cells, showed a marked loss of viability with evidence of apoptosis. Similarly, treatment with wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3K, stimulated apoptosis inHBx-transformed CHL cells but not in normal cells, confirming that HBx blocks apoptosis through the PI3K pathway. The serine 47 threonine kinase, Akt, one of the downstream effectors of PI3K-dependent survival signaling was 2-fold higher inHBx-transformed CHL (CHL-X) cells than CHL cells. Phosphorylation of Akt at serine 473 and Bad at serine 136 were induced by HBx, which were specifically blocked by wortmannin and dominant negative mutants of Akt and Bad, respectively. We also demonstrated that HBx inhibits caspase 3 activity and HBx down-regulation of caspase 3 activity was blocked by the PI3K inhibitor. Regions required for PI3K phosphorylation on the HBx protein overlap with the known transactivation domains. HBx blocks apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal in CHL cells in a p53-independent manner. The results indicate that, unlike other DNA tumor viruses that block apoptosis by inactivating p53, the hepatitis B virus achieves protection from apoptotic death through a HBx-PI3K-Akt-Bad pathway and by inactivating caspase 3 activity that is at least partially p53-independent in liver cells. Moreover, these data suggest that modulation of the PI3K activity may represent a potential therapeutic strategy to counteract the occurrence of apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma.

Several viral gene products affect apoptosis by interacting directly with components of the highly conserved biochemical pathways, which regulate cell death. Most viruses have evolved strategies to block or induce apoptosis depending upon the cellular environment (2Shen V. Shenk T.E. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)1 is recruited and activated during the intracellular signal transduction of many growth factor receptors and has been implicated in the signaling of survival factors (10Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Altered phosphorylation and turnover of phosphatidylinositol (PI) has also been demonstrated in cells transformed by DNA and RNA tumor viruses (11Jackowski S. Voelker D.R. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16830-16836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PI3K phosphorylates inositol lipids that act as second messengers for several targets, including the serine-threonine Akt kinase (12Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A.

Akt was initially described as an oncogene and is activated by serum and a variety of growth factors sharing the ability to activate the PI3K, such as platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, bovine fibroblast growth factor, insulin (12Franke T.F.

Cell. 1993; 73: 629-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Activation of Akt is known to deliver a survival signal that inhibits apoptosis induced by growth factor withdrawal (20Kauffmann-Zeh A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Ulrich E. Gilbert C. Coffer P. Downward J. Evan G. Nature. 1997; 385: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). Akt phosphorylates Bad, thereby blocking it from binding and inactivating Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, two antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members (21Ahmed N.N. Grimes H.L. Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3627-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), which eventually suppress apoptosis of transformed cells. Activation of Akt ultimately leads to inhibition of the caspase activity and protection from apoptotic cell death (21Ahmed N.N. Grimes H.L. Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3627-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). In cardiac muscle cells, the activation of PI3K has been identified to suppress caspase 3 activation and inhibit the occurrence of apoptosis (22Wu W. Lee W.L. Wu Y.Y. Chen D. Lin T. Jang A. Sharma P.H. Wang P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40113-40119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). HBx is a causative agent of hepatocellular carcinoma, and during tumorigenesis, the HBx gene product is known to play an important role in the alteration of gene expression, sensitizing cells to apoptotic killing and deregulating cell growth arrest (23Su F. Schneider R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8744-8749Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 24Benn J. Schneider R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11215-11219Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). HBx has been shown to complex with p53, inhibiting sequence-specific DNA binding in vitro and p53-mediated transcriptional activationin vivo (25Wang Y. Okan I. Pokrovskaja K. Wiman K.G. Oncogene. 1995; 12: 2731-2735Google Scholar), which eventually inhibits p53-dependent apoptosis. HBx was also shown to block apoptosis (26Wang X.W. Gibson M.K. Vermeulen W.Y.H. Forrester K. Stuzbecher H.W. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6012-6016PubMed Google Scholar) and induce transformation in NIH3T3 cells (27Shirakata Y. Kawada M. Fujiki Y. Sano H. Oda M. Yaginuma K. Kobayashi M. Koike K. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1989; 50: 517-621Google Scholar). Besides the anti-apoptotic effect, HBx has also been shown to induce apoptosis in hepatoma cells (28Kim H. Lee H. Yun Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 381-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Therefore, the fate of infected cells expressing HBx is likely to be determined by the balance between apoptotic and anti-apoptotic signals of viral, cellular, and environmental origin. The ability of HBx to modulate cell survival is potentially relevant for both viral pathogenicity in acute and chronic HBV infection as well as for the late development of hepatocellular carcinoma. In the long term, it is the anti-apoptotic function of HBx that is likely to be the major determinant for manifestation of the transformed phenotype. From this perspective, it is of central importance to define the molecular mechanisms underlying HBx-induced dysregulation of the cell death program. In this study we show that HBx activates PI3K and activated PI3K can lead to phosphorylation of Akt and Bad in CHL cells in a p53-independent manner. We also demonstrate that HBx suppressed the activation of caspase 3, through PI3K signaling, and suppresses apoptosis in CHL cells. In conclusion, we demonstrate that HBx acts as an anti-apoptosis agent through the HBx-PI3K-Akt-Bad pathway and inactivates caspase 3 activity in a PI3K-dependent manner that is at least partially p53 independent.DISCUSSIONPhosphatidylinositol 3-kinase has been shown to mediate signaling induced by numerous growth factors and tumor antigens (47Auger K.R. Serunian L.A. Saltoff S.P. Libby P. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 167-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 48Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). PI3K is a heterodimeric complex consisting of an 85-kDa regulatory subunit, p85, and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit, p110 (48Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar, 49Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. Bioassays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The p85 subunit contains two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, which bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors after stimulation of cells with growth factors and, in this manner, recruit the p85·p110 complex to the cell membrane. PI3K appears to induce a variety of cellular responses. These responses include the regulation of gene expression (50Beretta L. Gingras A.C. Svitkin Y.V. Hall M.N. Sorenberg N.

Recently, it was demonstrated that PI3K regulates cell survival in response to various apoptotic stimuli (58Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Much evidence suggests that activation of PI3K may lead to suppress caspase 3 activity and DNA fragmentation in a variety of cells. Most of the evidence derived from studies using pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K (LY294002 and wortmannin) shows that inhibition of PI3K with these compounds leads to cell apoptosis or loss of the anti-apoptotic effect of growth factors (59Crowder R.J. Freeman R.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 60Kulik G. Weber M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6711-6718Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 61Ryu B.R. Ko H.W. Jou I. Noh J.S. Gwag B.J. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 39: 536-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Several other studies using dominant negative constructs of PI3K to inhibit PI3K signaling confirmed that PI3K is essential in maintaining cell survival (61Ryu B.R. Ko H.W. Jou I. Noh J.S. Gwag B.J. J. Neurobiol. 1999; 39: 536-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 62Buerke M. Murohara T. Skurk C. Nuss C. Tomascelli K. Lefer A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

By using either in vivo or cell free systems, it was shown that the phospholipids produced by PI3K mediate PI3K signaling (53Klippel A. Reinhard C. Kavanagh M. Apell G. Escobedo M.A. Williams L.T.

Virol. 2000; 74: 10838-10845Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), was able to induce the kinase activity of the PI3K effector Akt (protein kinase B)in vitro ∼10-fold (39Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar, 58Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Signaling intermediates, which bind phospholipids via domains homologous to pleckstrin such as G-protein exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins, are also candidates for regulation by the products of PI3K (66Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller U.M. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 67Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Among these, the downstream target of PI3K that mediates the anti-apoptotic action of PI3K is Akt. The Akt pathway modulates sequential steps of apoptotic signaling. Activation of Akt may lead to phosphorylation of Bad (68Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4915) Google Scholar), induction of Bcl-2 family of proteins (69Matsuzaki H. Tamatani M. Mitsuda N. Nanmikawa K. Kiyama H. Miyake S. Tohyama M. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2037-2046PubMed Google Scholar), inhibition of cytochrome c release from mitochondria (70Kennedy S.G. Kandel E.S. Cross T.K. Hay N. Mol. Cell.

Biophy. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, some of these observations are dependent on the experimental system used. It appears that survival signaling may employ different antagonistic mechanisms in different cells. In cardiomyocytes the survival signals induced by insulin-like growth factor-I did not induce Bad phosphorylation, although they stimulated PI3K and Akt. In this case insulin-like growth factor-I induces anti-apoptosis in cardiomyocytes through PI3K/Akt signaling, which is independent of Bad (22Wu W. Lee W.L. Wu Y.Y. Chen D. Lin T. Jang A. Sharma P.H. Wang P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40113-40119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In this study 1-d-3-deoxy-3-fluoro-myo-inositol, a potent antagonist of cells exhibiting constitutively activated PI3K (72Freuned R. Dawe C.J. Carroll J.P. Benjamin T.L. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 141: 1409-1425PubMed Google Scholar), and the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin was used. Apoptosis in CHL cells transformed by HBx is shown to be enhanced when PI3K activity is inhibited by either growth of cells with 1-d-3-deoxy-3-fluoro-myo-inositol or after treatment with wortmannin, indicating involvement of PI3K in blocking apoptosis. In contrast, normal CHL cells are much less dependent on PI3K for survival, as indicated by their resistance to death induced by the inositol analogue and by wortmannin. These results suggest that signal transduction via HBx through PI3K is important for survival and protection from apoptosis. HBx also activates and phosphorylates Akt and Bad through PI3K, because PI3K inhibitors block HBx activation and phosphorylation of Akt and Bad. These results suggest that HBx utilizes the PI3K/Akt/Bad survival pathway in the CHL cell line. Caspase 3 plays a pivotal role in execution of apoptosis; ES cells deficient in caspase 3 were resistant to apoptotic induction (73Colussi P.A. Kumar S. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In human cardiomyopathy, apoptosis of cardiac muscle cells is associated with release of cytochrome c and activation of caspase 3 (74Narula J. Pandey P. Arbustini E. Haider N. Narula N. Kolodgie F.D. Dal Bello B. Semigran M.J. Bielsa-Masdeu A. Dec G.W. Israels S. Ballester M. Virmani R. Saxena S. Kharbanda S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8144-8149Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Using inhibitors of caspases, Bialik et al.(75Bialik S. Cryns V.L. Drincic A. Miyata S. Wollowick A.L. Srinivasan A. Kitsis R.U. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) showed that cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced by serum and glucose withdrawal can be attenuated. Our data show that HBx blocks caspase 3 activation during serum deprivation and caspase 3 activity is activated by the PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin, and LY294002 as shown in Fig. 6. These results imply that activation of caspase 3 during serum-deprived apoptosis is attenuated by HBx through the PI3K signaling pathway. The ability of a virus to delay host cell death is essential for viral growth (76Razvi E.S. Welsh R.M. Adv. Virus Res. 1995; 45: 1-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Some DNA viruses, such as the adenovirus and SV40, inhibit programmed cell death by inactivating p53. On the other hand, other DNA tumor viruses like the polyoma virus that has no known direct interaction with p53 (16Doherty J. Frenun R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1923-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) acts through PI3K and Akt and blocks apoptosis through the middle T-antigen (16Doherty J. Frenun R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1923-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Interestingly, viruses that handle p53 directly by inactivation or degradation (i.e. adenovirus, SV40, and papilloma virus) lack direct mechanisms for activating PI3K. It has been proposed that a pro-apoptotic effect facilitates viral spread and allows for evasion of host-cell-mediated immunity (65Lau J.Y.N. Xie X Lai M.M.C. Wu P.C. Semin. Liver Dis. 1998; 18: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). On the contrary, the inhibition of apoptosis would have the effect of allowing for the accumulation of potentially transforming mutations (65Lau J.Y.N. Xie X Lai M.M.C. Wu P.C. Semin. Liver Dis. 1998; 18: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The apparent discrepancy between the effects of HBx on apoptosis could reflect opposing concentration-dependent effects at different stages of natural HBV infection. A possibility is that HBx inhibits apoptosis during early hepatocyte infection and later on activates apoptosis to facilitate HBV replication and spread. Either stimulation or inhibition of apoptosis could lead to malignant transformation of hepatocytes. In HBV, the interactions between the HBx protein and p53 have been examined extensively (26Wang X.W. Gibson M.K. Vermeulen W.Y.H. Forrester K. Stuzbecher H.W. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Harris C.C. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 6012-6016PubMed Google Scholar), although the activation of PI3K by HBx protein has not been reported. In this study, we identified that the activation of PI3K and subsequently of Akt and Bad by the HBx protein eventually causes anti-apoptosis in CHL cells. The PI3K activation domains in the HBx protein are similar to the promoter transactivation domains as showed in our previous study (45Kim Y.H. Kang S.K. Lee Y.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 894-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). CHL cells showed marked serum dependence for survival. In CHL cells expressing HBx proteins, significant protection against apoptosis upon serum withdrawal was identified. After transfection with p53val135, this protection was temperature-independent, implying that HBx-induced anti-apoptosis is p53-independent. Consistent with our findings, p53 independence of anti-apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal has also been observed in other cell types (47Auger K.R. Serunian L.A. Saltoff S.P. Libby P. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 167-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Although some experimental evidence showed HBx inactivation of p53 in hepatocytes, the p53 independence of anti-apoptosis by the HBx protein through the PI3K-Akt-Bad pathway and inactivation of caspase 3 implies that HBx functions through a p53-independent pathway in inducing an anti-apoptosis phenomena in CHL cells. Apoptosis is an active process of self-destruction that is important in both the development and maintenance of multicellular organisms (1Clem R.J. Fechheimer M. Miller L.K. Science. 1991; 254: 1388-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Several viral gene products affect apoptosis by interacting directly with components of the highly conserved biochemical pathways, which regulate cell death. Most viruses have evolved strategies to block or induce apoptosis depending upon the cellular environment (2Shen V. Shenk T.E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 3Teodoro J.G. Branton P.E. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1739-1746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)1 is recruited and activated during the intracellular signal transduction of many growth factor receptors and has been implicated in the signaling of survival factors (10Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Altered phosphorylation and turnover of phosphatidylinositol (PI) has also been demonstrated in cells transformed by DNA and RNA tumor viruses (11Jackowski S. Voelker D.R. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16830-16836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PI3K phosphorylates inositol lipids that act as second messengers for several targets, including the serine-threonine Akt kinase (12Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A.

Akt was initially described as an oncogene and is activated by serum and a variety of growth factors sharing the ability to activate the PI3K, such as platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, bovine fibroblast growth factor, insulin (12Franke T.F.

Cell. 1993; 73: 629-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Activation of Akt is known to deliver a survival signal that inhibits apoptosis induced by growth factor withdrawal (20Kauffmann-Zeh A. Rodriguez-Viciana P. Ulrich E. Gilbert C. Coffer P. Downward J.

https://openalex.org/W2035798975,"To maintain Ca2+ entry during T lymphocyte activation, a balancing efflux of cations is necessary. Using three approaches, we demonstrate that this cation efflux is mediated by Ca2+-activated K+ (KCa) channels, hSKCa2 in the human leukemic T cell line Jurkat and hIKCa1 in mitogen-activated human T cells. First, several recently developed, selective and potent pharmacological inhibitors of KCa channels but not KV channels reduce Ca2+ entry in Jurkat and in mitogen-activated human T cells. Second, dominant-negative suppression of the native KCa channel in Jurkat T cells by overexpression of a truncated fragment of the cloned hSKCa2 channel decreases Ca2+ influx. Finally, introduction of the hIKCa1 channel into Jurkat T cells maintains rapid Ca2+ entry despite pharmacological inhibition of the native small conductance KCa channel. Thus, KCachannels play a vital role in T cell Ca2+ signaling. To maintain Ca2+ entry during T lymphocyte activation, a balancing efflux of cations is necessary.

Thus, KCachannels play a vital role in T cell Ca2+ signaling. The human leukemic T cell line Jurkat is widely used as a model system to study intracellular signaling cascades during lymphocyte activation. These studies have revealed the critical requirement for two signaling pathways to complete lymphocyte activation. In the first pathway, activation of protein kinase C, particularly protein kinase Cθ, leads to the phosphorylation of several cytoplasmic proteins and the triggering of transcription via the assembly of the Fos/Jun transcription factor complex on AP1 elements in several genes (1Flanagan W.M. Corthésy B. Bram R.J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1991; 352: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 2Northrop J.P. Ullman K.S. Crabtree G.R. J. Biol.

In the second cascade, the sustained entry of Ca2+ from the external milieu raises the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration, leading to gene transcription mediated by the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) 1The abbreviations used are: NF-ATnuclear factor of activated T cellsILinterleukinChTXcharybdotoxinCRACCa2+ release-activated Ca2+Dapdiaminopropionic acidGFPgreen fluorescent proteinIKCaintermediate conductance KCaKVvoltage-gated K+KCaCa2+-activated K+SKCasmall conductance KCaTgthapsigargin (5Rao A.

Cell. 1999; 96: 611-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Production of the key T cell cytokine IL-2 requires the simultaneous activation of both pathways, with Ca2+ being absolutely required for the process.In human T lymphocytes and in Jurkat T cells, Ca2+ influx is mediated by the opening of voltage-independent Ca2+release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels (7Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6295-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 8Partiseti M. Le Deist F. Hivroz C. Fischer A. Korn H. Choquet D. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1435-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Movement of ions through open channels in the plasma membrane is driven by an electrochemical gradient. Upon T cell stimulation and opening of CRAC channels, the electrochemical gradient supporting Ca2+entry is large, resulting in significant Ca2+ influx. However, Ca2+ entry could result in depolarization of the plasma membrane, limiting further influx. Therefore, to maintain Ca2+ entry over the time scale required for gene transcription, a balancing cation efflux is necessary. Efflux of K+ ions through K+ channels is thought to provide the electrochemical driving force for Ca2+ entry via regulation of membrane potential (10Lewis R.S. Cahalan M.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 623-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). We have directly tested this idea and identified the functionally important K+ channel subtypes in Jurkat T cells and activated normal human T cells.Jurkat T cells express two distinct K+ channels. The first is a voltage-gated K+ (KV) channel encoded by the Kv1.3 gene, and the second is a small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (KCa) channel recently shown to be encoded by the hSKCa2 gene (11Grissmer S.

Human T cells possess a different KCa channel encoded by hIKCa1, in addition to Kv1.3, but do not expressSKCa2 (15Grissmer S. Nguyen A.N. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen.

Earlier work investigating the roles of K+ channels in lymphocyte activation was hampered by the lack of sufficiently specific blockers, leading to conflicting results and divergent interpretations (see, for example, Refs. 19Gelfand E.W. Or R. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3452-3458PubMed Google Scholar and 20Freedman B.D. Price M.A. Deutsch C.J. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3784-3794PubMed Google Scholar). Expression levels of KV and KCa channels are similar in Jurkat and in mitogen-activated human T cells, although the molecular identity of the KCa channel differs in these two cell types (15Grissmer S. Nguyen A.N. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 601-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This difference in expression pattern, the advent of new and highly specific blockers of all three channels, and the potential for genetic manipulation of functional expression levels provide an opportunity to examine the contributions of K+channels in regulating membrane potential and Ca2+signaling in lymphocytes. Our results emphasize the importance of KCa channels in the modulation of Ca2+signaling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and ChemicalsJurkat E6–1 and COS-7 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Jurkat E6–1 cells were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 10 mm HEPES at densities of 1–9 × 105 in a 37 °C humidified incubator with 5% CO2. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine and split twice weekly. Human T cells were isolated and cultured as described (21Hess S.D. Oortgiesen M. Cahalan M.D. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2620-2633PubMed Google Scholar). T cells were preactivated by addition of 4 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin or phorbol myristate acetate (33 nm) + ionomycin (1 μm) (Calbiochem) for 18–72 h prior to use.

UCL 1684 is very stable in aqueous solution, showing no significant degradation after 24 h in culture medium at 37 °C (data not shown). The stability of other drugs was not tested over long periods of time. ShK-Dap22 and ChTX-Glu32 were obtained from BACHEM (King of Prussia, PA).Transfection of Constructs into Mammalian CellsIn each electroporation cuvette (gap of 0.4 cm), 107 Jurkat cells and 10 μg of the DNA of interest were electroporated at 960 μF, 250 V, and then resuspended in 15 ml of fresh culture medium and returned to the incubator for 36–60 h prior to use. COS-7 cells (5 × 105 cells/chamber) were plated in culture chambers and transiently transfected using the Lipofectin transfection reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) with the DNA of interest following the manufacturer's recommended protocol in OptiMEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Following an 8–12-h transfection, the cells were placed in fresh growth medium in the incubator for 48 h. Typical transfection efficiencies using this protocol were 18–33%. The DNA vectors used for transfection were prepared using the Qiagen (Valencia, CA) endotoxin-free plasmid maxi-prep kit.DNA ConstructsThe N-terminal GFP fusion protein of human IKCa1 (GFP-IKCa1) was a gift from J. Aiyar (AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, Wilmington, DE) and was generated by subcloning hIKCa1 into the pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) as aBamHI/BglII-Xho fragment. This cloning strategy introduced 12 extra amino acids between GFP and the initiation codon ofIKCa1. The expressed sequence tag clone IMAGE: 2248 (GenBankTM accession number AI810558), corresponding to nucleotides 491–2193 of the SKCa2 sequenceAF239613, was isolated from the pT7T3 Pac Vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using NotI and EcoRI restriction sites and subcloned into pBluescript and from there into theSacI restriction site of the pGFP-C1 expression vector. The truncated hSKCa2 dominant negative construct was generated by removing a 1.24-kilobase pair BclI fragment from the GFP-SKCa2 construct, leaving a 564-base pair insert encoding the hSKCa2 N-terminal proximal region terminating in the S3 transmembrane domain. The human SKCa3 clone (GenBankTM accession number AJ251016) containing 19 polyglutamines in the N terminus was cloned in frame to GFP in the GFP vector as an EcoRI/BamI fragment. HEK-293 cells expressing the skeletal muscle sodium channel hSKM1 (SCN4A) were a gift from Dr. F. Lehmann-Horn (University of Ulm, Germany) (26Peter W. Mitrovic N. Schiebe M. Lehmann-Horn F.

In KVexperiments, whole-cell recordings were made with a holding potential of –80 mV and an internal solution identical except that it contained 2.28 mm CaCl2, resulting in a calculated free [Ca2+] of ∼50 nm. KVexperiments also used a leak subtraction regimen in which the leak pulse was applied after each voltage pulse. External solutions consisted of normal Ringer solution (155 mm NaCl, 4.5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mmd-glucose, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4), K+ Ringer solution (with identical ingredients except that all NaCl was substituted by KCl, resulting in a final KCl concentration of 159.5 mm), or 40 mm K+ Ringer solution, in which these two solutions were mixed to yield a final Na+ concentration of 119.5 mm and a final K+ concentration of 40 mm. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed using the equipment and techniques described previously, and all data were corrected for a liquid junction potential of −13mV for aspartate-based solutions (29Fanger C.M.

Cytokine production was assayed using the OptEIA enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (BD-Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) and a fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) to quantify production of IL-2 and IL-8.Confocal MicroscopyConfocal fluorescence images were taken with a Bio-Rad MRC-600 equipped with an argon laser (488 nm) and a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set (500–530 nm). All images were acquired under a 63× oil objective on a Zeiss Axiovert 35 microscope. Z-series sections were captured at 0.5-μm intervals, and optical section thickness was estimated to be ∼0.45-μm.Ca2+ Imaging and Membrane Potential MeasurementsCells were loaded in 1 μm fura-2/AM ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 21–24 °C for 30 min, washed, and stored in the dark until use (within 3 h). Intracellular Ca2+ concentrations were estimated, and experiments were performed utilizing a complete video microscopic, ratiometric Ca2+ imaging system (Videoprobe, ETM Systems), as previously described (30Fanger C.M.

Store depletion in the presence of Tg required perfusion with a 0-Ca2+ version of normal Ringer solution in which CaCl2 was replaced by additional MgCl2 to keep divalent concentrations constant and in which 1 mm EGTA was used to chelate residual Ca2+. During measurements on transfected cells, individual GFP-positive, and thus successfully transfected, cells were identified and marked for analysis using a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set consisting of a 480 ± 20 nm exciter, 505 nm dichroic mirror, and 520 nm long-pass emission filter. By comparing Ca2+ responses of GFP-hSKCa2Δ-expressing or GFP-hIKCa1-expressing cells with GFP-expressing vector control cells, we eliminated the risk of inaccurate quantification due to small amounts of contamination of the fura-2 signal by GFP fluorescence bleed-through. Data processing and statistical analysis were carried out using IgorPRO (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR) and Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) software. The bis-oxonol dye bis-(1, 3-dibutylbarbituric acid)trimethine oxonol (DiBAC4(3), Molecular Probes) was used as an indicator of membrane potential in imaging experiments using the same software and hardware described for Ca2+ imaging, and using the fluorescein, filter set described above. Cells were preequilibrated with 125 nmDiBAC4(3) for 5–10 min prior to the start of each experiment, and dye concentration was maintained in all external solutions throughout the experiment.RESULTSSpecific K+ Channel Blockers Define the Role of KV and KCa Channels in Jurkat Ca2+SignalingUsing the patch clamp technique, we characterized highly potent and specific KCa and KV channel blockers in Jurkat T cells and activated human T lymphocytes. In Jurkat cells, whole-cell recording with Ca2+ maintained at a low concentration inside the pipette revealed only KV currents (Fig. 1 A). These currents inactivated during repetitive pulsing and were blocked by ShK-Dap22, a sea anemone peptide modified to gain specificity for the Kv1.3 channel (IC50 = ∼25 pm) (31Kalman K. Pennington M.W. Lanigan M.D. Nguyen A. Rauer H. Mahnir V. Paschetto K. Kem W.R. Grissmer S. Gutman G.A. Christian E.P. Cahalan M.D. Norton R.S. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32697-32707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Application of 10 nmShK-Dap22 blocked ∼97% of the KV current. The voltage dependence, inactivation kinetics, and pharmacological properties of Jurkat KV currents are consistent withKv1.3 encoding this channel, as reported previously (32Grissmer S. Dethlefs B. Wasmuth J.J. Goldin A.L. Gutman G.A. Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9411-9415Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar).Elevation of [Ca2+] inside the pipette to 1 μm activated an additional small, voltage-independent current. By increasing extracellular K+ concentrations to 40 mm, the inward component of this current could be observed. The current reversed near the predicted Nernst potential for a K+-selective current in 40 mm K+extracellular solution (Fig. 1 B). Application of 10 nm apamin, a peptide from bee venom, completely and irreversibly blocked this KCa current (data not shown), in agreement with a previous study (11Grissmer S. Lewis R.S. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 99: 63-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), whereas Kv1.3 blockers ShK-Dap22 (250 nm, Fig. 1 B) and charybdotoxin (10 nm, data not shown) had little or no effect. Recently, a group of bis-quinolinium derivatives developed by the group of C. R. Ganellin and D. H. Jenkinson at University College London were found to block with high affinity the apamin-sensitive small conductance KCa channel in rat superior cervical ganglion cells (33Campos Rosa J. Galanakis D. Ganellin C.R. Dunn P.M. Jenkinson D.H. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 2-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). We tested these same compounds on the apamin-sensitive KCa current in Jurkat T cells. The bis-quinolinium cyclophane UCL 1684 (see under “Experimental Procedures” for full name) at a concentration of 10 nmblocked 95 ± 5% of the KCa current but had no effect on the KV current even at 250 nm (Fig. 1,A and B). Blocking was rapid (usually complete within 1 min) and, in contrast to apamin, rapidly reversible. The dose-response curve in Fig. 1 D shows that UCL 1684 blocks the Jurkat KCa channel with subnanomolar affinity (IC50 = 180 pm), making it the most potent inhibitor of this channel yet described. The molecular identity of the KCa channel in Jurkat T cells was verified by measuring the efficacy of UCL 1684 in blocking current through the cloned humanSKCa2 and SKCa3 channels expressed in COS-7 cells (IC50 values of 280 pm and 9.5 nm, respectively). UCL 1684 selectively blocks Jurkat KCachannels and SKCa2 channels over the closely relatedSKCa3 channel and several other more distantly related channels (Fig. 1 D; Table I). Other bis-quinolinium cyclophanes (UCL 2079, UCL 1848, and UCL 1530; see under “Experimental Procedures” for full names) also blocked Jurkat KCa currents with high affinity (Fig.1 C). Table I summarizes the selectivity of all compounds and demonstrates that UCL 1684, UCL 1848, and UCL 2079 are all ∼104-fold more effective at blocking SKCa currents than any other channels tested. Because these drugs are highly specific for the KCa channel found in Jurkat T cells and appear equally potent in blocking the expressed human SKCa2channel, our results provide a confirmation that the SKCa2gene encodes the KCa channel in Jurkat T cells (13Jäger H.

Open table in a new tab We used a pharmacological approach to discern the contributions ofKv1.3 and SKCa2 channels to calcium signaling in Jurkat T-cells. Ca2+ signaling can be induced by thapsigargin (Tg), a specific inhibitor of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase that enables study of Ca2+ entry independent of Ca2+ release from internal stores (34Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2466-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (2986) Google Scholar). Depletion of intracellular Ca2+stores with Tg in the absence of extracellular Ca2+activates CRAC channels in the plasma membrane, permitting Ca2+ entry upon reintroduction (35Fanger C.M. Hoth M. Crabtree G.R. Lewis R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 655-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In Jurkat T cells, the KCa channel inhibitor UCL 1684 reduced Ca2+influx, but not the Tg-induced release of intracellular Ca2+ stores (Fig.2 A), in a dose-dependent manner that closely paralleled the dose-dependent block of the native KCa current (Fig. 2 B). Maximal inhibition of the [Ca2+]i plateau was achieved at 10 nmUCL 1684, a dosage that blocked 95 ± 5% of Jurkat KCa channels. This dosage of UCL 1684 had no effect on IL-2 production in Jurkat cells but inhibited IL-8 production by 30% (data not shown). In contrast, application of the Kv1.3 blocker ShK-Dap22 (up to 10 nm) did not affect the Ca2+ response or cytokine production (Fig. 2 Aand data not shown). These results demonstrate that KCachannels but not KV channels help maintain Jurkat cell Ca2+ entry.Figure 2KCa (SKCa2) but not KV block reduces Ca2+ influx in Jurkat T cells. In Ca2+ imaging experiments, fura-2-loaded Jurkat cells and human T cells were stimulated with 1 μmTg in 0-Ca2+ Ringer solution (see bars above panels) in the presence or absence of UCL 1684 or ShK-Dap22. After ∼8 min, normal Ringer solution (2 mm Ca2+) was reintroduced, causing a rapid, sustained Ca2+ influx. A, Ca2+responses of Jurkat cells stimulated with Tg in the presence of varying doses of UCL 1684 (numbers), of 10 nmShK-Dap22, or no drug (control). Eachtrace represents the average response of ∼100 cells from a typical experiment. Combined addition of ShK-Dap22 and UCL 1684 had little or no added effect. B, comparison of the dose-response curve from patch clamp experiments shown in Fig.1 C (solid line) with the plateau Ca2+values from A (filled circles). C,membrane potential was monitored during stimulation in the presence (dotted trace, 64 cells) or in the absence (solid trace, 45 cells) of UCL 1684 (10 nm). Increasing DiBAC4(3) fluorescence intensity indicates depolarization of the membrane potential. Tg (1 μm) was used in a stimulation protocol identical to that used in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The most likely mechanism by which UCL 1684 inhibits Ca2+entry is depolarization of the membrane potential resulting from Ca2+ entry through CRAC channels in the absence of KCa channel function. To test this possibility, the membrane potential of Jurkat T cells was monitored using a voltage-sensitive dye during the same Tg stimulation protocol used in Fig. 2 A. Treatment with Tg in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ caused a moderate depolarization of most cells, followed by a marked hyperpolarization upon Ca2+ readdition (Fig. 2 C, solid line). This hyperpolarization must be caused by the opening of SKCa2 channels because cells treated with UCL 1684 instead showed profound membrane depolarization following Ca2+ reintroduction (Fig. 2 C, dotted line). Similar results were observed in perforated-patch current clamp recordings (data not shown). These results demonstrate the tight link between KCa channel opening, modulation of membrane potential, and regulation of Ca2+ entry.The Role of KCa Channels in Activated Normal Human T CellsActivated human T cells present an excellent system to further test the role of KCa channels in Ca2+regulation. Mitogen-activated human T cells and Jurkat cells express similar numbers of KV and KCa channels, suggesting that they may regulate calcium signaling in a similar manner. The KV channel in human lymphocytes and in Jurkat T cells is encoded by the Kv1.3 gene (32Grissmer S. Dethlefs B. Wasmuth J.J. Goldin A.L. Gutman G.A. Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

However, the KCa channel in human T cells is the product of theIKCa1 gene that is phylogenetically related to theSKCa2 gene found in Jurkat cells. Both KCachannels share a common calmodulin-dependent mechanism for calcium-dependent gating (29Fanger C.M. Ghanshani S. Logsdon N.J. Rauer H. Kalman K. Zhou J. Beckingham K. Chandy K.G.

As shown in Fig. 3 A, IKCa1 channels are blocked by ChTX-Glu32(IC50 = ∼30 nm) (28Rauer H. Lanigan M.D. Pennington M.W. Aiyar J. Ghanshani S. Cahalan M.D. Norton R.S. Chandy K.G. J. Biol.

In this study, we found that substitution of a highly conserved tryptophan at position 1246 with cysteine (W1246C-MRP1) in the putative last transmembrane segment (TM17) of MRP1 eliminated 17β-estradiol 17-(β-d-glucuronide) (E217βG) transport by membrane vesicles prepared from transiently transfected human embryonic kidney cells while leaving the capacity for leukotriene C4- and verapamil-stimulated glutathione transport intact. In addition, in contrast to wild-type MRP1, leukotriene C4transport by the W1246C-MRP1 protein was no longer inhibitable by E217βG, indicating that the mutant protein had lost the ability to bind the glucuronide. A similar phenotype was observed when Trp1246 was replaced with Ala, Phe, and Tyr. Confocal microscopy of cells expressing Trp1246 mutant MRP1 molecules fused at the C terminus with green fluorescent protein showed that they were correctly routed to the plasma membrane. In addition to the loss of E217βG transport, HeLa cells stably transfected with W1246C-MRP1 cDNA were not resistant to theVinca alkaloid vincristine and accumulated levels of [3H]vincristine comparable to those in vector control-transfected cells.

In contrast, resistance to sodium arsenite was only partially diminished, and resistance to potassium antimony tartrate remained comparable to that of cells expressing wild-type MRP1. This suggests that the structural determinants required for transport of heavy metal oxyanions differ from those for chemotherapeutic agents.

When overexpressed in tumor cells, MRP1 (gene symbol ABCC1) confers resistance to anticancer drugs and other xenobiotics of remarkably diverse structures and charge. Thus, the resistance spectrum associated with MRP1 expression extends from cationic and neutral natural product drugs (e.g. vincristine, doxorubicin, and VP-16) to the antimetabolite methotrexate to arsenical and antimonial oxyanions (4Cole S.P.C. Sparks K.E. Fraser K. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Wilson G.M. Deeley R.G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5902-5910PubMed Google Scholar). MRP1 is also a primary active transporter of conjugated organic anions that include GSH-, glucuronide-, and sulfate-conjugated derivatives of both endo- and xenobiotics, suggesting a role for MRP1 in the disposition and elimination of these compounds (2Hipfner D.R. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 359-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The ability of MRP1 to confer drug resistance and transport conjugated organic anions is shared by at least two other proteins belonging to the ABCC subfamily, MRP2 (ABCC2) and MRP3 (ABCC3) (5Konig J. Nies A.T. Cui Y. Leier I. Keppler D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 377-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 6Kool M. van der Linden M. de Haas M. Scheffer G.L. de Vree J.M.L.

These three proteins share a common five-domain structure that distinguishes them from most other ABC transporters, which more typically have four structural domains. Thus, MRP1, -2, and -3 have a third membrane-spanning domain (MSD) with an extracytosolic N terminus that precedes a core structure consisting of two tandemly arranged units containing an MSD and a nucleotide-binding domain (see Fig.1 A) (7Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Leslie E.M. Gerlach J.H. Grant C.E. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23623-23630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 8Cui Y. Konig J.

Kuwano M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4124-4129PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, MRP3 is a relatively poor transporter of GSH-conjugated organic anions compared with MRP1 and MRP2 (9Hirohashi T. Suzuki H. Sugiyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15181-15185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Such differences in substrate specificity are not unexpected given that the amino acid sequences of MRP2 and MRP3 are only 48 and 58% identical, respectively, to that of MRP1. Two of the best characterized substrates of MRP1 are the GSH-conjugated arachidonic acid derivative leukotriene C4(LTC4) and the glucuronidated estrogen 17β-estradiol 17-(β-d-glucuronide) (E217βG) (5Konig J.

Conversely, transport of GSH itself by MRP1 is markedly stimulated by a variety of structurally diverse heterocyclic molecules that may or may not be cotransported with this tripeptide (16Loe D.W. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5130-5136PubMed Google Scholar, 17Loe D.W. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 530-538PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which MRP1-mediated transport and/or cotransport of its conjugated and unconjugated substrates occurs is presently unclear. Nevertheless, it has been proposed that MRP1 contains a bipartite binding site(s) that can accommodate the structural and physical diversity of its substrates (3Borst P. Evers R. Kool M. Wijnholds J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 13Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The specific amino acids involved in the recognition, binding, and transport of MRP1 substrates are largely unknown. In previous studies, the differing abilities of human MRP1 and its murine ortholog to confer resistance to anthracycline drugs have allowed us to identify a nonconserved glutamic acid residue at position 1089 in putative transmembrane segment 14 (TM14) in the third C-proximal MSD (MSD3) of human MRP1 that is essential for its ability to confer resistance to this class of drugs (19Zhang D. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13231-13239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Anthracyclines such as doxorubicin and daunorubicin exist predominantly as cations at physiological pH, and consequently, it seems reasonable for a negatively charged membrane-embedded amino acid to be involved in conferring resistance to these drugs (20Zheleznova E.E.

In this study, we have identified a highly conserved tryptophan residue in predicted TM17, the last TM segment in MSD3, that is critical not only for enabling the transport of the conjugated organic anion E217βG, but also for the ability of MRP1 to confer resistance to both cationic and electroneutral natural product drugs. [6,7-3H]E217βG (55 Ci/mmol) and [glycine-2-3H]GSH (40–44.8 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [3H]Vincristine (44.8 Ci/mmol) and [14,15-3H]LTC4 (115.3 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). LTC4 was purchased from Calbiochem, and nucleotides, GSH, verapamil, 2-mercaptoethanol, acivicin, E217βG, and dithiothreitol were purchased from Sigma. Drugs and heavy metal oxyanions used in chemosensitivity assays were obtained as described previously (4Cole S.P.C. Sparks K.E. Fraser K. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Wilson G.M. Deeley R.G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5902-5910PubMed Google Scholar). The MRP1 expression vector pcDNA3.1(−)-MRP1K was constructed by cloning the EagI/KpnI fragment from pMRP-fc-AT engineered with a perfect Kozak sequence into theNotI/KpnI site of the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) (21Grant C.E. Valdimarsson G. Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 357-361PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations of Trp1246 in MRP1 were generated using the TransformerTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The template for mutagenesis was prepared by cloning a 2-kb XmaI fragment from pcDNA3.1(−)-MRP1K (containing nucleotides 2532–4518 of the MRP1 sequence encoding amino acids 843–1506) into pGEM-3Z® (Promega, Madison, WI). Mutagenesis was then performed according to the manufacturer's instructions with the following sense mutagenic primers (substituted nucleotides are underlined): W1246C, 5′-CCACGTACTTGAACTGCCTGGTTCGGATGTC-3′; W1246A, 5′-CCACGTACTTGAACGCGCTGGTTCGGATGTC-3′; W1246F, 5′-CCACGTACTTGAACTTCCTGGTTCGGATGTC-3′; and W1246Y, 5′-CCACGTACTTGAACTATCTGGTTCGGATGTC-3′. After confirming all mutations by sequencing or diagnostic restriction enzyme digests, a 1.3-kb BsmBI/EcoRI fragment was subcloned back into pcDNA3.1(−)-MRP1K, and the fragments in the full-length constructs were sequenced once again. The 238-amino acid coding sequence of jellyfish GFP with S65T was cloned in-frame to the 3′-end of MRP1 to generate a wild-type MRP1-GFP construct as follows. First, the TGA stop codon of MRP1 was eliminated using polymerase chain reaction to generate a 0.55-kb fragment encoding MRP1 amino acids 1353–1531 (nucleotides 4058–4593) withClaI and SacII restriction sites engineered at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, with pcDNA3.1(−)-MRP1K as template, primers 5′-GCCCatcgatGGCATCAACATCGCCAAGATC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CATAATAATCCccgcggTTTCACCAAGCCGGCGTCTTTG-3′ (reverse) (substituted nucleotides are underlined; letters in italics indicate restriction enzyme recognition sequences), and clonedPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene). Next, a 0.7-kb polymerase chain reaction product encoding GFP with SacII andAflII restriction sites engineered at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, was prepared using the pECE-GFP(S65T) plasmid as template (gift from Dr. P. Greer, Queen's University) and primers 5′-CATCCccgcggATGAGTAAAGGAGAAGAAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGGCGGcttaagGTTATTTGTATAGTTCATCCATG-3′ (reverse). Finally, the two fragments were digested withClaI/SacII and SacII/AflII, respectively, and ligated together with T4 DNA ligase, and then the single 1.26-kb fragment was cloned into theClaI/AflIII sites of pcDNA3.1(−)-MRP1K to generate a vector designated pcDNA3.1(−)-MRP1K-GFP. All cloning boundaries of the final product were confirmed by sequencing. Mutant MRP1-GFP fusion proteins were generated by replacing the 1.3-kbBsmBI/EcoRI fragment in the pcDNA3.1(−)-MRP1K-GFP construct with the comparable fragment containing either the W1246C or W1246A mutation generated above and designated pcDNA-3.1(−)-W1246C-MRP1-GFP and pcDNA3.1(−)-W1246A-MRP1-GFP, respectively. For transient transfections, wild-type and mutant pcDNA3.1(−)-MRP1 expression vectors were transfected into SV40-transformed human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T). Briefly, ∼3.9 × 106 cells were seeded in 175-cm2flasks, and 24 h later, DNA (16 μg) was added using FuGENETM-6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Laval, Quebec, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48–60 h, the HEK293T cells were harvested, and inside-out membrane vesicles were prepared as described previously (13Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9675-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Empty vector and vector containing the wild-type cDNAs were included as controls in all experiments. Levels of wild-type and mutant MRP1 proteins were determined by immunoblotting as described below. For stable transfections, ∼1.5 × 105 HeLa cells were seeded in each well of a 6-well plate, and 24 h later, DNA (1 μg) was added with FuGENETM-6. After 48 h, the cells were subcultured 1:12, and the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing G418 (1000 μg/ml; Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.). After ∼14 days, cell colonies were removed individually using cloning cylinders and subcultured in 600 μg/ml G418. Levels of MRP1 protein in G418-resistant cell populations were then determined by immunodot blotting, and the proportion of cells expressing MRP1 was determined by flow cytometry, followed by cloning by limiting dilution as described below. The levels of wild-type and mutant MRP1 proteins were determined by immunoblot analysis of membrane protein fractions from transfected cells essentially as described (22Hipfner D.R. Mao Q. Qiu W. Leslie E.M. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15420-15426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved on a 6–7% polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred to a nylon membrane. Blots were blocked with 4% (w/v) skim milk powder for 1 h, followed by incubation with primary antibody. Wild-type and mutant MRP1 proteins were detected with the human MRP1-specific murine mAb QCRL-1 (diluted 1:10,000), which recognizes a linear epitope consisting of amino acids 918–924 (23Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Stride B.D. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3307-3314PubMed Google Scholar). After washing, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Pierce, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada), followed by application of Renaissance®chemiluminescence blotting substrate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Relative levels of protein expression were estimated by densitometric analysis using a ChemiImagerTM 4000 (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). HEK293T cells were seeded at 3.5 × 105 cells/well in a 6-well plate on coverslips coated with 0.1% gelatin in 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and transiently transfected with the MRP1-GFP cDNA constructs (1 μg of DNA/well) using FuGENETM-6. Forty-eight hours later, the coverslips were washed once with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were permeabilized by adding 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. The coverslips were then incubated in RNase A (10 μg/ml in 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 60 min at room temperature. The coverslips were washed again, and cell nuclei were stained with 1 ml of propidium iodide (2 μg/ml in PBS) for 45 min in the dark. Finally, the coverslips were placed on slides containing 1 drop of Antifade solution (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), and cells were examined using a Meridian InSight Plus confocal microscope equipped with an air-cooled argon laser. Images obtained at 488 nm excitation were pseudo-colored and overlaid using Maxim DL software. To determine the proportion of stably transfected cells expressing MRP1, populations of HeLa cells selected in G418 for >3 weeks were analyzed by flow cytometry with the MRP1-specific mAb QCRL-3, which recognizes a conformation-dependent epitope within the first nucleotide-binding domain of MRP1 (22Hipfner D.R.

Briefly, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing with blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS), cells were incubated with mAb QCRL-3 (diluted 1:100) for 1 h. The cells were washed twice with blocking solution and incubated for 30 min with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) F(ab′)2 fragment (Pierce) diluted 1:100 in blocking solution. After two washes with blocking solution, cells were resuspended in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS and analyzed on a Coulter Epic flow cytometer. Several populations containing the highest level of MRP1 with the largest proportion of MRP1-positive cells were cloned by limiting dilution and expanded to obtain stable cell lines with >90% of the cells expressing wild-type or mutant MRP1. Inside-out membrane vesicles were prepared from transiently transfected HEK293T cells or stably transfected HeLa cells, and ATP-dependent transport of 3H-labeled substrates by the membrane vesicles was measured using a rapid filtration technique as described previously (13Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9675-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Briefly, LTC4 transport assays were performed at 23 °C in a 50-μl reaction containing 50 nm LTC4 (40 nCi), 4 mm AMP or ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 100 μg/ml creatine kinase, and 2–4 μg of vesicle protein in transport buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, 250 mm sucrose, pH 7.4). Uptake was stopped at selected times by rapid dilution in ice-cold buffer, and then the reaction was filtered through glass-fiber filters (type A/E) that had been presoaked in transport buffer. Radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. All data were corrected for the amount of [3H]LTC4 that remained bound to the filter, which was usually <10% of the total radioactivity. Transport in the presence of AMP was subtracted from transport in the presence of ATP to determine ATP-dependent LTC4 uptake. All transport assays were carried out in triplicate, and results are expressed as means ± S.D. Uptake of [3H]E217βG was measured in a similar fashion, except that membrane vesicles (2–4 μg of protein) were incubated at 37 °C in a total reaction volume of 50 μl containing E217βG (400 nm, 40 nCi) and the components as described for LTC4 transport. [3H]GSH uptake was also measured by rapid filtration with membrane vesicles (20 μg of protein) incubated at 37 °C in a 60-μl reaction volume with 100 μm [3H]GSH (300 nCi/reaction) (17Loe D.W. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 530-538PubMed Google Scholar). To minimize GSH catabolism by γ-glutamyltranspeptidase during transport, membranes were preincubated in 0.5 mm acivicin for 10 min at 37 °C prior to measuring [3H]GSH uptake in the presence of verapamil (100 μm) (16Loe D.W. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5130-5136PubMed Google Scholar). The relative drug resistance of the HeLa cell lines stably transfected with wild-type and mutant MRP1 cDNAs was determined using a tetrazolium-based microtiter plate assay (24Cole S.P.C. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1990; 26: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (1 × 104 cells/well), incubated at 37 °C for 24 h before the addition of drug, and then incubated for a further 72 h before the addition of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (2 mg/ml of PBS). After 3 h at 37 °C, isopropyl alcohol and 1n HCl (24:1) were added to solubilize the formazan crystals, and the absorbance at 570 nm was determined using an ELX800 microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.). IC50 values were obtained from the dose-response curves using GraphPAD Prism® software. All assays were carried out in quadruplicate and reported as means ± S.D. Relative resistance was calculated as the IC50 of the wild-type or mutant MRP1-transfected HeLa cell line divided by the IC50of the HeLa cell line transfected with empty pcDNA3.1(−) vector alone. [3H]Vincristine accumulation in intact cells was measured as described previously (25Cole S.P.C. Chanda E.R. Dicke F.P. Gerlach J.H. Mirski S.E.L. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3345-3352PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells (1.25 × 106/ml) were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 1 μm [3H]vincristine (1 μCi/ml) in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 10 mm glucose, and 5% fetal bovine serum. Aliquots of suspended cells were removed at 0 and 60 min, and accumulation of [3H]vincristine was stopped by rapid dilution into ice-cold PBS. Cells were washed twice with PBS, and the cell pellets were solubilized in 1% SDS. Cell-associated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. During the course of a mutational analysis of proline residues in MRP1, we generated an MRP1 mutant in which proline at position 196 was replaced with alanine (P196A). When stably expressed in HeLa cells, the ability of this mutant to transport organic anions was reduced, and it no longer conferred resistance to natural product drugs. In contrast, a second independently derived P196A mutant HeLa cell line displayed a phenotype similar to that of cells expressing wild-type MRP1. 2K. Ito, R. G. Deeley, and S. P. C. Cole, unpublished observations. Using three sets of overlapping primers, the integrated MRP1-transfected cDNAs of the wild-type MRP1 and the first P196A mutant cell lines were amplified by polymerase chain reaction. The DNA fragments obtained were of the size expected, and when sequenced, it was discovered that, in addition to the P196A mutation, the transfected copies of MRP1 cDNA in the first cell mutant line with an altered phenotype contained a G → C nucleotide mutation, resulting in substitution of cysteine for tryptophan at position 1246. This finding, together with the highly conserved nature of Trp1246 among ABC transporters belonging to the ABCC subfamily (Fig.1 B), prompted us to initiate a more extensive analysis of the structural and functional importance of this amino acid. As a first step to confirming the importance of Trp1246, this amino acid was substituted with cysteine in pcDNA3.1(−)-MRP1K by site-directed mutagenesis, and the resulting construct was then transiently transfected into HEK293T cells. Control transfections with the wild-type construct and the empty pcDNA3.1(−) vector were carried out at the same time. Membrane vesicles were prepared, and protein expression levels were determined by immunoblotting. For the experiments shown in Fig. 2, the levels of W1246C-MRP1 in the transient transfectants were ∼70% those of wild-type MRP1 (Fig. 2 A). A time course of LTC4uptake was performed, and the levels of uptake by the W1246C-MRP1 mutant relative to wild-type MRP1 were observed to be essentially proportional to their relative levels of expression (Fig.2 B). Subsequent kinetic analyses of LTC4transport by the W1246C-MRP1 mutant indicated that its affinity for this substrate was reduced compared with wild-type MRP1 (Km = 189 nm versus 79 nm), but the Vmax values for the two proteins were similar (40.6 versus 35.1 pmol/mg/min). 3K. Ito, R. G. Deeley, and S. P. C. Cole, manuscript in preparation. These results indicate that substitution of Trp1246 with Cys reduces the affinity of MRP1 for this substrate, but that the transport capacities of the mutant and wild-type proteins are comparable. In contrast, uptake of E217βG by the W1246C-MRP1 mutant was dramatically reduced and was comparable to that of the vector-transfected controls (Fig. 2 C). We have previously shown that E217βG is a competitive inhibitor of MRP1-mediated LTC4 transport, with Ki∼ 25 μm (26Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9683-9689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of E217βG to inhibit LTC4 transport by the W1246C-MRP1 mutant was examined, and the results are shown in Fig. 2 D. E217βG (25 μm) inhibited LTC4transport by wild-type MRP1 by 54%, as expected. In contrast, E217βG had no effect on LTC4 transport by W1246C-MRP1, indicating that the loss of E217βG transport by the mutant protein is associated with a loss of binding of this substrate. To determine whether the loss of E217βG transport activity was related specifically to a Cys substitution at position 1246, several different amino acids were introduced in place of Trp1246. These included substitution with a nonpolar non-aromatic amino acid (Ala; W1246A-MRP1) as well as conservative substitutions with polar (Tyr; W1246Y-MRP1) and nonpolar (Phe; W1246F-MRP1) aromatic amino acids. Membrane vesicles were prepared from HEK293T cells transiently transfected with these constructs, and the ATP-dependent transport of LTC4 and E217βG was determined (Fig.3). As shown in Fig. 3 A, the levels of expression of the mutant proteins were comparable or slightly higher than those of wild-type MRP1. The LTC4 transport levels of the W1246A-MRP1 mutant (Fig. 3 B) and the W1246Y-MRP1 and W1246F-MRP1 mutants (Fig. 3 C) were similar to those of wild-type MRP1 and the W1246C-MRP1 mutant. In contrast, like the W1246C mutant, the W1246A mutant did not transport E217βG (Fig. 3 D). E217βG transport by the W1246Y and W1246F mutants was also extremely low (∼10% of wild-type MRP1) (Fig. 3 E). To determine whether the Trp1246 substitution might affect the transport of other MRP1 substrates, GSH uptake was measured in membrane vesicles prepared from HEK293T cells transfected with wild-type and Trp1246mutant MRP1 cDNAs. We have shown previously that MRP1 mediates low level ATP-dependent"
https://openalex.org/W2061196579,"Ferritin is a multimeric iron storage protein composed of 24 subunits. Ferritin purified from dried soybean seed resolves into two peptides of 26.5 and 28 kDa. To date, the 26.5-kDa subunit has been supposed to be generated from the 28-kDa subunit by cleavage of the N-terminal region. We performed amino acid sequence analysis of the 28-kDa subunit and found that it had a different sequence from the 26.5-kDa subunit, thus rendering it novel among known soybean ferritins. We cloned a cDNA encoding this novel subunit from 10-day-old seedlings, each of which contained developed bifoliates, an epicotyl and a terminal bud. The 26.5-kDa subunit was found to be identical to that identified previously lacking the C-terminal 16 residues that correspond to the E helix of mammalian ferritin. However, the corresponding region in the 28-kDa soybean ferritin subunit identified in this study was not susceptible to cleavage. We present evidence that the two different ferritin subunits in soybean dry seeds show differential sensitivity to protease digestions and that the novel, uncleaved 28-kDa ferritin subunit appears to stabilize the ferritin shell by co-existing with the cleaved 26.5-kDa subunit. These data demonstrate that soybean ferritin is composed of at least two different subunits, which have cooperative functional roles in soybean seeds.

Ferritin has 24 subunits that are assembled into a spherical shell characterized by 4-, 3-, and 2-fold symmetry (432 symmetry). Up to 4500 Fe(III) atoms can be stored as an inorganic complex in the inner cavity of assembled ferritin, rendering these atoms nontoxic and biologically available (1Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim.

Structural analyses of vertebrate and bacterial ferritins indicate that each subunit consists of a four-helix bundle (helices A, B, C, and D) and a fifth short helix (E helix). The E helix exists around the 4-fold intersubunit symmetry axes of the protein shell and forms a hydrophobic pore (1Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys.

Cowpea has at least four different ferritin genes, one that encodes a protein with 97% sequence identity to soybean ferritin (11Lescure A.M. Proudhon D. Pesey H. Ragland M. Theil E.C. Briat J.F.

Chem. 1990; 265: 18339-18344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The peptides encoded by the other cowpea genes in the ferritin family are more divergent. Despite the evidence that multiple ferritin genes exist in plants, it is not clear whether the products of these different genes are functionally divergent. This is in contrast to the situation reported in pigs, frogs and salmon, where two functional H-type subunits showing different tissue specificity are found (20Collawn Jr., J.F. Fish W.W. Comp. Biol. Physiol. B. 1984; 78: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 21Dickey L.F. Sreedharan S. Theil E.C. Didsbury J.R. Wang Y.H. Kaufman R.E. J. Biol.

Biotechnol. 1995; 4: 164-170PubMed Google Scholar). The ferritin subunits of soybean and many other legumes are synthesized as 32-kDa precursor proteins (23van der Mark F. Van den Briel F. Huisman H.G. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), which contain a unique two-domain N-terminal sequence (19Ragland M. Briat J.F. Gagnon J. Laulhère J.P. Massenet O. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18339-18344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These N-terminal domains are not present in mammalian or other ferritins. The first domain, which consists of 40–50 residues and is known as the “transit peptide” (TP),1 is presumed to facilitate transport of the ferritin precursor to plastids (14Briat J.F. Labouré A.M. Laulhère J.P. Lescure A.M. Lobréaux S. Pesey H. Proudhon D. Wuytswinkel O. Abadı́a J. Iron Nutrition in Soils and Plants. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1995: 265-276Crossref Google Scholar). The function of the second domain, which is a part of the mature protein and is termed extension peptide (EP), is currently unclear. The ferritin subunit purified from soybean seed is 28 kDa, but it is apparently converted in significant amounts to a 26.5-kDa subunit (19Ragland M. Briat J.F. Gagnon J. Laulhère J.P. Massenet O. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18339-18344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,24Laulhère J.P. Labouré A.M. Briat J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3629-3635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In 1990, Ragland et al. (19Ragland M. Briat J.F. Gagnon J. Laulhère J.P. Massenet O. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18339-18344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that such truncation occurs by cleavage of the EP during germination or free radical damage. They considered the 28-kDa subunit to be an iron-containing form and the 26.5-kDa subunit to be an iron releasing form (23van der Mark F. Van den Briel F. Huisman H.G. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 25van Wuytswinkel O. Savino G. Briat J.F. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This proposal has yet to be unsubstantiated by experimental evidence. Here we report evidence that the iron conversion mechanism of soybean seed ferritin involves two distinct subunits. One of these is novel and presented here for the first time, while the other is identical to that previously identified. These data about soybean ferritin maturation allow us to hypothesize a novel mechanism by which iron is released from the assembled ferritin molecule. 500 g of soybean dry seeds (Glycine max Merrill cv.Kita-no-shiki) were crushed into flour by a mill. The soybean seed flour was suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA and 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, homogenized, and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant was fractionated using 20% saturation of ammonium sulfate. An amber-colored precipitant was collected by centrifugation and dialyzed against 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer. The dialyzed sample was applied to a DEAE-Toyopearl (TOSOH, Tokyo, Japan) column previously equilibrated by 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA. The column was washed with a buffer containing 0.15 msodium chloride, and amber-colored ferritin was eluted. The eluate was again fractionated with 20% saturated ammonium sulfate. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation, applied to a butyl-Toyopearl (TOSOH) column and eluted with a linear gradient of 20 to 0% saturated ammonium sulfate. Fractions containing soybean ferritin were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA and applied to Q-Sepharose columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of sodium chloride from 0 to 0.7 m. Fractions containing soybean ferritin were pooled and concentrated and finally loaded to Superdex 75-pg gel filtration columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated before use in 10 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.15 m NaCl. Apoferritin was obtained using methods described by Chasteen and Theil (26Chasteen N.D. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 257: 7672-7677Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Purified ferritin was dialyzed against 50 mmHEPES/NaOH buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1% thioglycolic acid, followed by successive changes of HEPES buffer with (0.1%) or without thioglycolic acid. Protein was then dialyzed against HEPES buffer containing 13 g/liter of Chelex-100 (Bio-Rad) and 0.2 mNaCl and finally dialyzed against deionized water. The concentration of purified proteins was determined using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) and densitometer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Soybean ferritin subunits were separated electrophoretically using a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was stained with 0.1% Ponceau S (Sigma) in 2% (v/v) acetic acid, and two distinctive bands of 28.0 and 26.5 kDa were independently cut from the membrane. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis was performed by automatic Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems model 477A pulse-liquid sequencer system. C-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the 26.5-kDa subunit was performed using p-phenylene diisothiocyanate controlled pore glass (Sigma) (27Nokihara K. Morita N. Yamamoto R. Kondo J. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 26.5-kDa subunit was digested with lysyl endopeptidase, and the resulting peptide fragments were covalently bound to p-phenylene diisothiocyanate controlled pore glass. Only the C-terminal fragment, which contained no lysyl residue, was detached by cleavage of the first residue with trifluoroacetic acid (27Nokihara K. Morita N. Yamamoto R. Kondo J. J. Biochem. 1995; 118: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The sequence of the C-terminal fragment was determined by automatic Edman degradation, as described above. Primers for amplification of the subunit containing a novel N-terminal amino acid sequence were designed using the expressed sequence tag sequences (AW185525, AI966037, AW397605, AI443722,AI900240) of soybean registered in GenBankTM. 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and 3′-RACE was carried out using a SMART RACE cDNA Amplification kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions; total RNA extracted from 10-day-old seedlings contained developed bifoliates, an epicotyl and a terminal bud was used as a template. About 10 candidate sequences of a target sequence coding the novel subunit were determined. DNA sequences encoding the mature region of soybean ferritin, previously reported by Lescure et al. (11Lescure A.M. Proudhon D. Pesey H. Ragland M. Theil E.C. Briat J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8222-8226Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the primers -TP (5′-GCGCATATGTCAACGGTGCCTCTCAC-3′) and C (5′-GCGGGATCCTAATCAAGAAGTCTTTG-3′). -TP and C contained NdeI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively. The resulting fragments, which were missing the TP sequence, were ligated to theNdeI and BamHI sites on the expression vector pET3a (Novagen) to generate pESF. The expression plasmid pESF was transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLys. An E. coli strain harboring the expression plasmid was cultured in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C. Bacterial growth was monitored with a spectrophotometer at 600 nm. When an absorbance of 0.6 was reached, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and proteins were extracted using BugBuster protein extraction reagent (Novagen). Recombinant ferritin was purified using the same methods described above for native ferritin. Soluble protein was extracted from 200 mg of soybean leaves by homogenization with 1 ml of extraction buffer (50 mm K2PO4, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sarcosine) and sea sand followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm. The supernatant was used for degradation experiments of soybean ferritin. Recombinant ferritin or native soybean ferritin (150 ng each) were added to 20 μl of the leaf extract and incubated at room temperature for 0, 1, 10, 30, 60, and 120 min, respectively. After SDS-PAGE and electroblotting to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, protein immunodetection was performed. Antiserum was raised against the soybean ferritin as previously described (28Goto F. Yoshihara T. Saiki H. Transgenic Res. 1998; 7: 173-180Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Probing of blots with soybean ferritin antibody was carried out using anti-rabbit IgG sheep immunoglobulin coupled with biotinylated horseradish peroxidase (Vectastain ABC kit; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Immunostain HRP-1000 (Konica, Tokyo, Japan) was used for visualizing the signal (28Goto F. Yoshihara T. Saiki H. Transgenic Res. 1998; 7: 173-180Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar,29Goto F. Yoshihara T. Shigemoto N. Toki S. Takaiwa F. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Reactions examining iron uptake by native soybean and recombinant ferritin were performed in 100 mm HEPES/NaOH buffer (pH 7.0) with a Fe2+/ferritin molar ratio of 1000:1 (0.1 mmferrous sulfate and 0.1 μm ferritin) at room temperature. Iron incorporation by each type of ferritin was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 310 nm (30Levi S. Luzzago A. Cesareni G. Cozzi A. Franceschinelli F. Albertini A. Arosio P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18086-18092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Paques E.P. Paques A. Crichton R.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) using a UV spectrophotometer (U3000; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). For iron release experiments, native soybean and recombinant apoferritins (2 μm each) were mineralized using freshly prepared ferrous sulfate (1 mm) in 0.1 m MOPS containing 0.2 m NaCl (15Laulhère J.P. Briat J.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 33Mertz J.R. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11719-11726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 2 h at room temperature and then overnight at 4 °C. The excess iron that was not incorporated into the ferritin shell was precipitated by the centrifugation and separated from the mineralization mixture. External iron was then removed using Econo-Pac 10 DG (Bio-Rad). Iron release was initiated by the addition of 1 mm sodium ascorbate and 4 mm ferrozine (15Laulhère J.P. Briat J.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); the former was previously reported to enhance the reductive release of iron from the ferritin shell (15Laulhère J.P. Briat J.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 693-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 34Laulhère J.P. Barcelo F. Fontecave M. Biometals. 1995; 9: 303-309Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Exogenous Fe2+ was measured by the absorbance of the Fe2+-ferrozine complex at 560 nm using the same spectrophotometer described above. The data of iron uptake and release were obtained from three different preparations. The levels of reductive iron release by the two subunits were compared statistically using t tests (p = 0.05). Soybean ferritin was extracted from dry seeds and isolated using the following sequential chromatographic purification steps: anion exchange, hydrophobicity, and gel filtration. Soybean ferritin was eluted in a single peak after each chromatographic step. Purified ferritin subunits were separated as two peptides (28 and 26.5 kDa) by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1 A). Densitometric analysis indicated that the 28- and 26.5-kDa subunits are present in purified native ferritin in nearly equivalent amounts (28versus 26.5 kDa = 1:1.09). Nondenaturing gel electrophoresis (native PAGE) resolved purified soybean ferritin as a single complex, estimated to be about 550–560 kDa (Fig.1 B). Comparisons between the N-terminal sequences of the 28-kDa subunit (Ala-Ser-Asn-Ala-Pro-Ala) and the 26.5-kDa subunit (Ala-Ser-Thr-Val-Pro-Leu) revealed that the 28-kDa subunit was different from any previously reported. Further determination for the N-terminal sequence verified that the 28-kDa subunit was a novel subunit (Fig. 2). The N-terminal sequence of the 26.5-kDa subunit was identical to that of the EP region of the sequence reported by Lescure et al. (11Lescure A.M. Proudhon D. Pesey H. Ragland M. Theil E.C. Briat J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8222-8226Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Our analyses revealed that the transit peptide is cleaved at the carboxyl side of the 48th cysteine in the 26.5-kDa subunit, which contrasts with the previously reported cleavage site at position 49 (alanine) (Fig. 2) (11Lescure A.M. Proudhon D. Pesey H. Ragland M. Theil E.C. Briat J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8222-8226Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 23van der Mark F. Van den Briel F. Huisman H.G. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To detect the site of cleavage for hypothesized conversion of the 28-kDa subunit to the 26.5-kDa subunit (11Lescure A.M. Proudhon D. Pesey H. Ragland M. Theil E.C. Briat J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8222-8226Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 13Wei J. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17488-17493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the C-terminal amino acid sequence of the 26.5-kDa subunit was determined. The sequence of the peptide fragment containing the C-terminal residue was Ser-Glu-Tyr-Val-Ala-Gln-Leu-Arg-Arg (Fig. 2), which was the same as that previously reported (11Lescure A.M. Proudhon D. Pesey H. Ragland M. Theil E.C. Briat J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8222-8226Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The C-terminal residue was determined to be the 234th arginine, which is situated 17 residues upstream from the C terminus. These data demonstrated that the 26.5-kDa subunit in the soybean seed ferritin is generated as a result of proteolytic cleavage of the C-terminal 16 residues of the previously described subunit. A cDNA encoding a newly identified subunit (28 kDa) of soybean ferritin was cloned using a polymerase chain reaction-based strategy. The predicted amino acid sequence was compared with the previously reported sequence of ferritin subunit (11Lescure A.M. Proudhon D. Pesey H. Ragland M. Theil E.C. Briat J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8222-8226Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and several differences were found (Fig. 2). Based on the conservation of several residues, thought to comprise the ferroxidase site (6Lawson D.M. Treffry A. Artymiuk P.J. Harrison P.M. Yewdall S.J. Luzzago A. Cesareni G. Levi S. Arosio P. FEBS Lett. 1989; 254: 207-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 7Lawson D.M. Artymiuk P.J. Yewdall S.J. Smith J.M.A. Livingstone J.C. Treffry A. Luzzago A. Levi S. Arosio P. Cesareni G. Thomas C.D. Shaw W.V. Harrison P.M. Nature. 1991; 349: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), we defined the 26.5- and the 28-kDa subunits as H-1 and H-2, respectively. The mature region of the H-2 subunit, in which the TP is detached from the precursor, is composed of 209 residues. It is seven residues longer than the H-1 subunit (202 residues). The amino acid sequence of the mature region of the H-2 subunit has 82% identity with that of the H-1 subunit. In contrast to a high identity in the mature regions, low sequence identity between the TP sequences of H-1 and H-2 is found (41%). In the sequence of the mature region, the deduced helical regions (A to E helices) (4Frolow F. Kalb A.J. Yariv J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) are highly conserved between the H-1 and H-2 subunits, while the loop region between the B and C helices and the EP region are relatively variable. Specifically, the amino acid sequence identities of the helical, loop, and EP regions are 90, 81, and 63%, respectively (Table I). The H-2 subunit has C-terminal extension consisting of five residues (four of them charged). A comparison between the C-terminal cleavage site of H-1 (α-amino side of position 234) with the putatively homologous position in H-2 (position 235) revealed the presence of an arginine in H-1 and a leucine in H-2 (Fig. 2). The unsusceptibility of the H-2 subunit to C-terminal cleavage is probably due to the presence of leucine instead of arginine at this position.Table IThe partial amino acid sequence identity between the H-1 and H-2 subunitsRegionIdentity%TP41EP63Helix A90Helix B86Helix C94Helix D88Helix E91BC loop81Total82The amino acid sequences of both subunits were compared with each other in eight parts. Open table in a new tab The amino acid sequences of both subunits were compared with each other in eight parts. The full mature region of the soybean ferritin H-1 subunit was expressed inE. coli. Native PAGE (Fig. 1 B) and gel filtration (data not shown) analysis showed that the recombinant soybean ferritin subunit assembles into a 24-mer, presumably in a similar fashion to native ferritin. We abbreviate the recombinant H-1 subunit as “rH-1” and native soybean ferritin purified from seeds as “seed H-1/H-2.” The rH-1 was composed of only the H-1 subunit in the original, uncleaved form (28 kDa), while the seed H-1/H-2 included both the H-2 and cleaved H-1 (26.5 kDa) subunits in nearly equal amounts (Fig. 1 A). The rH-1 was incubated with soybean leaf extract (Fig. 3). Prior to the incubation with the soybean leaf extract, the rH-1 subunit remained in its 28-kDa form; however, it was degraded quickly following the addition of leaf extract. About half the amount of the rH-1 subunit was degraded to the cleaved form (26.5 kDa) in 10 min, and after 1 h of incubation, the original 28-kDa form had completely disappeared; only a small amount of the cleaved 26.5-kDa form was detected. Subsequently, the cleaved form degraded completely after 2 h of incubation. In contrast, the seed H-1/H-2 was still detectable after 2 h of incubation, although the 28-kDa form was not present. Since we used an antiserum raised against the H-1 subunit, specific detection of the H-2 subunit in seed H-1/H-2 was not expected to occur; this may explain the absence of a 28-kDa band in Fig. 3. To investigate the effects of C-terminal cleavage in H-1 on the multimeric complex, we compared iron uptake and release activities between seed H-1/H-2 and rH-1. A recombinant form of the cleaved H-1 subunit (whose C terminus was deleted) did not assemble into a 24-mer (data not shown). Both rH-1 and seed H-1/H-2 showed iron uptake activity (Fig.4 A). Progression plots indicated that the uptake rate of the seed H-1/H-2 was slower than that of the rH-1, despite the presence in all of the subunits of ferroxidase sites. Both the uptake rates were faster than that of Fe(II) autoxidation (control). The rate of reductive release of iron from seed H-1/H-2 and rH-1 was assessed (Fig. 4 B). The level of ferrous atoms released from the ferritin shell was calculated via absorbance measurement of the Fe(II)-ferrozine complex. At every assessed time, the amounts of the Fe(II)-ferrozine complex were significantly larger with seed H-1/H-2 than with rH-1. This result suggested that cleavage of C-terminal 16 residues accelerated iron release from the protein shell. In this study, we demonstrated that two polypeptide chains with different sequences are found in soybean ferritin purified from seeds. Previously, it was hypothesized that only one type of polypeptide chain, which was in either a cleaved or uncleaved form, was present in the multimer (11Lescure A.M. Proudhon D. Pesey H. Ragland M. Theil E.C. Briat J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8222-8226Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We found that the two different subunits exist in nearly equal amounts in the ferritin of soybean seeds. Two kinds of subunits with different amino acid sequences were also detected previously in clover seed (35Barcelo F. Miralles F. Otero Arean C. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1997; 66: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), although one of them existed only at very low levels, and its amino acid sequence was not unambiguously identified. From amino acid sequence and cDNA analysis, we designated the two soybean ferritin subunits as H-1 and H-2. H-1 had a sequence identical to that previously described (11Lescure A.M. Proudhon D. Pesey H. Ragland M. Theil E.C. Briat J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8222-8226Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and experiments involving rH-1 and leaf extracts revealed that this 28-kDa subunit could be readily converted to 26.5-kDa by cleavage of the 16 residues at the C terminus. In the amino acid sequence profiles, no contaminating peaks were detectable, indicating that the H-1 subunit was perfectly converted to the cleaved 26.5-kDa form. The H-2 subunit had a novel amino acid sequence and, unlike H-1, appeared unsusceptible to cleavage, remaining in its 28-kDa mature form. These data are in conflict with the previous hypothesis that the 26.5-kDa subunit is generated by cleavage of the N-terminal EP of the 28-kDa subunit and that the 28- and 26.5-kDa subunits are identical apart from this cleavage (23van der Mark F. Van den Briel F. Huisman H.G. Biochem. J. 1983; 214: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In degradation experiments using the extract of soybean leaves, the homo-24-mer of rH-1 was unstable compared with the seed H-1/H-2 (Fig.3). The instability of the H-1 multimer is probably due to cleavage of the C-terminal 16 residues in each subunit. In support of this hypothesis, a mutant recombinant form of H-1, which lacked the C-terminal 16 residues, could not assemble into a native ferritin-like complex. Luzzago and Cesareni (37Luzzago A. Cesareni G. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 569-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and Levi et al. (36Levi S. Luzzago A. Franceschinelli F. Santambrogio P. Cesareni G. Arosio P. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) also remarked on the importance of the C-terminal region for shell stability in human H-chain ferritin. Notably, the H-2 subunit was not susceptible to cleavage of the C-terminal region and was stable during incubation with the leaf extraction. These data indicate that the H-2 subunit stabilizes the native ferritin 24-multimer in soybean seeds. In vertebrate ferritins, the three-dimensional structures of the single subunit and assembled 24-mer have been analyzed in detail (2Trikha J. Waldo G.S. Lewandowski F.A. Ha Y. Theil E.C. Weber P.C.

There are narrow channels around the 3-fold and the 4-fold symmetry axes (1Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2193) Google Scholar). Residues around the 3-fold channels are mainly hydrophilic, and the channels are proposed as the main entrance for iron atoms (38Stefanini S. Dasideri A. Vecchini P. Drakenberg T. Chiancone E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 39Yablonski M.J. Theil E.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9680-9684Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 40Treffry A.

In contrast, four subunits are tightly packed around the 4-fold channels, with hydrophobic interactions occurring among the nonpolar residues in the E helices (1Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim.

Biol. 1997; 268: 424-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that conversion of the H-1 subunit from 28 to 26.5 kDa is due to the cleavage of the C-terminal 16 amino acid residues. From amino acid sequence alignment data and the deduced three-dimensional structure of plant ferritin subunits (41Lobréaux S. Yewdall S.J. Briat J.F. Harrison P.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the cleaved 16 residues correspond to the E helix of vertebrate ferritin, which is a short helix forming the narrow channels around the 4-fold intersubunit interaction axes. In the case of amphibian red cell L-chain ferritin, it was reported that the diameter of this channel is about 1.5 Å, while that of the 3-fold channel is about 3.7 Å at its narrowest point (2Trikha J. Waldo G.S. Lewandowski F.A. Ha Y. Theil E.C. Weber P.C. Allewell N.M. Proteins. 1994; 18: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, the channel around the 4-fold axes does not appear to have enough pore size to allow ions to move freely (2Trikha J. Waldo G.S. Lewandowski F.A. Ha Y. Theil E.C. Weber P.C. Allewell N.M. Proteins. 1994; 18: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). What might the functional significance of cleavage of the E-helices in soybean ferritin be? It is likely that the pore size of the channel around the 4-fold axes would be expanded drastically. Although half of the subunits (H-2) in soybean ferritin are not susceptible to proteolysis, the pore generated by cleavage of the H-1 E-helices is expected to be large enough to allow iron atoms to pass freely. Indeed, the rate of iron release from seed H-1/H-2 was faster than that from the rH-1 (uncleaved 28-kDa form) (Fig.4 B). These data suggest that the rate of iron release is accelerated by cleavage of the E helix. In contrast to the case of iron entrance in mammalian ferritin, few studies have been performed on iron release pathways in either plant or animal ferritin (42Takagi H. Shi D. Ha Y. Allewell N.M. Theil E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18685-18688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Therefore, the large pore generated by the cleavage of the E helix provides a novel hypothesis for iron release from ferritin. Conversely, the iron uptake activity of seed H-1/H-2 was relatively low compared with the rH-1, despite the fact that both the H-1 and H-2 subunits possess the predicted ferroxidase center. The apparent difference in the rate of iron uptake is probably due to the C-terminal cleavage in H-1, which facilitates reductive release of incorporated iron from native ferritin. C-terminal mutation in the human H-chain ferritin has also been reported to affect iron incorporation and ferroxidase activity (36Levi S. Luzzago A. Franceschinelli F. Santambrogio P. Cesareni G. Arosio P. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In plant ferritin, some functional genes have already been identified (16Lobréaux S. Massenet O. Briat J.F. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 19: 563-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 17Wicks R.E. Entsch B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 813-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 18Wardrop A.J. Wicks R.E. Entsch B. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Here, we have identified a novel soybean ferritin subunit (H-2), whose maturation process is different from that of the originally described subunit (H-1). The novel subunit proved to be one of the major subunits of soybean seed ferritin. The primary structure of the novel ferritin subunit was closely related to that of the known (11Lescure A.M. Proudhon D. Pesey H. Ragland M. Theil E.C. Briat J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8222-8226Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) subunit (82% identity). However, the difference in the maturation process of H-2 appears to promote the novel function of “iron release.” The 28-kDa (presumably H-2-like) and partially cleaved 26.5-kDa (presumably H-1-like) subunits are also found in pea and other legume ferritins (22Andersen O. Dehli A. Standal H. Giskegjerde T.A. Karstensen R. Rorvik K.A. Mol. Mar. Biol. Biotechnol. 1995; 4: 164-170PubMed Google Scholar, 23van der Mark F. Van den Briel F. Huisman H.G. Biochem.

Notably, a leucine is found at a similar position in one of the cowpea ferritin subunits to that of the leucine at position 235 in H-2 (Fig. 2) (18Wardrop A.J. Wicks R.E. Entsch B. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, like the case of soybean, it is possible that the different sized subunits observed in many legume ferritins derive from different genes and play cooperative roles in the storage and release of iron atoms. In agreement with the results of Lobréaux and Briat (43Lobréaux S. Briat J.F. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 601-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), concentration of ferritin subunits in soybean cotyledon decreased gradually during germination and finally disappeared after about 10 days (data not shown). To date, many studies have examined expression of plant ferritin in legume plants and maize. While ferritin accumulates in developing nodules, cotyledons, and embryo axes (43Lobréaux S. Briat J.F. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 601-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 44Ragland M. Theil E.C. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 21: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 45Kimata Y. Theil E.C. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) of soybean and pea, it has not been detected in green leaves in bean (43Lobréaux S. Briat J.F. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 601-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In conflict with the latter result, van der Mark and colleagues reported that ferritin was detectable in normal green leaves of bean (46van der Mark F. de Lange T. Bienfait H.F. Planta. 1981; 153: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 47van der Mark F. van den Briel M.L. van Oers J.W.A.M. Bienfait H.F. Planta. 1982; 156: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these authors provided preliminary evidence for the existence of multiple subunits of ferritin in bean (32van der Mark F. van den Briel W. Plant Sci. 1985; 39: 55-60Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A consensus on patterns of ferritin expression in plants has not yet been reached, and we suggest that a contributing factor to this has been the exclusive study of the H-1 gene and its product during analysis. We are currently analyzing the expression and tissue distribution of the newly identified H-2 subunit, as well as the H-1 subunit, in order to elucidate their respective functions and to obtain information on the significance of the multigene family of soybean ferritin.

The heparan sulfate chains have markedly heterogeneous structures in which distinct sequences of sulfate groups determine specific binding properties. Sulfation at each different position of heparan sulfate is catalyzed by distinct enzymes, sulfotransferases. In this study, we identified and characterized Drosophila heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase (dHS6ST). The deduced primary structure of dHS6ST exhibited several common features found in those of mammalian HS6STs. We confirmed that, when the protein encoded by the cDNA was expressed in COS-7 cells, it showed HS6ST activity. Whole mount in situ hybridization revealed highly specific expression of dHS6ST mRNA in embryonic tracheal cells. The spatial and temporal pattern of dHS6ST expression in these cells clearly resembles that of the Drosophilafibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor, breathless(btl). RNA interference experiments demonstrated that reduced dHS6ST activity caused embryonic lethality and disruption of the primary branching of the tracheal system. These phenotypes were reminiscent of the defects observed in mutants of FGF signaling components. We also show that FGF-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase activation is significantly reduced indHS6ST double-stranded RNA-injected embryos. These findings indicate that dHS6ST is required for tracheal development in Drosophila and suggest the evolutionally conserved roles of 6-O-sulfated heparan sulfate in FGF signaling.

These diverse mechanisms of action are achieved by interactions between the specific structures of heparan sulfate and the binding proteins. The backbone of heparan sulfate is a polysaccharide chain composed of alternatingd-glucuronic acid (GlcA) andN-acetyl-d-glucosamine units, and some GlcA residues are converted into l-iduronic acids. The microheterogeneity of the heparan sulfate structures is mainly produced by the nonrandom introduction of N-, 2-O-, 6-O-, and 3-O-sulfate groups (1David G. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 2Salmivirta M. Lidholt K. Lindahl U. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Thus, the biological functions of heparan sulfate proteoglycans are controlled by biosynthetic events, which define the fine structures of heparan sulfate. For many years, functional studies of structurally complex heparan sulfate have focused on vertebrate tissues and cultured cells. Recent studies, however, have shown that heparan sulfate is also found in simple model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster andCaenorhabditis elegans (3Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Selleck S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2269-2275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The structural features of heparan sulfate in Drosophila are similar to those found in vertebrates. In addition, the analyses of heparan sulfate inDrosophila mutants have shown that the biosynthesis apparatus is also conserved in this organism (4Toyoda H. Kinoshita-Toyoda A. Fox B. Selleck S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21856-21861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Therefore, on the basis of their homology to vertebrate heparan sulfate-modifying genes, it is now possible to analyze the function of modified heparan sulfatein vivo using these genetically tractable organisms. Recently, genetic studies on mutants for heparan sulfate sulfotransferases indicated that the regulated synthesis of heparan sulfate affects morphogenesis during development. Bullock et al. (5Bullock S.L. Fletcher J.M. Beddington R.S. Wilson V.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1894-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) reported that heparan sulfate 2-O-sulfotransferase (HS2ST)1 knock-out mice showed renal agenesis as well as defects in eyes and skeleton. InDrosophila, pipe encodes a protein that is structurally similar to HS2ST, and the ventral expression ofpipe in the somatic cells of ovary is required for the formation of embryonic dorsoventral polarity (6Sen J. Goltz J.S. Stevens L. Stein D. Cell. 1998; 95: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Mutations insulfateless (sfl), which encodes a heparan sulfate N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase, affect Wingless, FGF, and Hedgehog signaling pathways during development (7Lin X. Perrimon N. Nature. 1999; 400: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 8Lin X. Buff E.M. Perrimon N. Michelson A.M. Development. 1999; 126: 3715-3723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9The I. Bellaiche Y. Perrimon N. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 633-639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). These findings have shown that differentially modified heparan sulfate can regulate growth factor signaling. It is well established that heparan sulfate binds to bFGF and is required for the activation of the signal transduction pathway. However, the mechanism by which heparan sulfate promotes bFGF action is not clearly understood. It has been variously proposed that heparan sulfate induces a conformational change in bFGF (10Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar), serves as a bridge between bFGF and FGFR (11Kan M. Wang F. Xu J. Crabb J.W. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar), or promotes dimerization of FGFRs (12Plotnikov A.N. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Mohammadi M. Cell. 1999; 98: 641-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). It has been reported that specific fine structures of heparan sulfate have a critical role for binding to bFGF. Biochemical studies have shown that N- and 2-O-sulfation is required for binding of bFGF to heparan sulfate (13Faham S. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Rees D.C. Science. 1996; 271: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). On the other hand, studies using biological assays have shown that, in addition to 2-O-sulfation, 6-O-sulfation is responsible for the activation of bFGF signaling (14Guimond S. Maccarana M. Olwin B.B. Lindahl U. Rapraeger A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23906-23914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Pye D.A. Vives R.R. Turnbull J.E. Hyde P. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22936-22942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). This may reflect the fact that heparan sulfate interacts with not only FGFs but also their receptors. Recent crystallographic analysis also supported the idea that 6-O-sulfation promotes the dimerization of FGFRs (16Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K. Yayon A. Linhardt R.J. Mohammadi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 743-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, one FGF ligand, Branchless (Bnl), and two FGFRs, Heartless (Htl) and Breathless (Btl) have been identified and characterized (17Beiman M. Shilo B.Z. Volk T.

In this study, we examined the structure and function ofDrosophila 6-O-sulfotransferase (dHS6ST). We present here the cDNA and deduced amino acid sequences of dHS6ST and the characterization of its enzymatic activity. In situhybridization of dHS6ST mRNA revealed thatdHS6ST is expressed in specific patterns in several tissues. During embryogenesis, dHS6ST mRNA was detected in developing tracheal precursor cells that also express aDrosophila FGF receptor, btl. Blocking thedHS6ST activity by double-stranded RNA interference caused embryonic lethality and defects in the migration of the tracheal cells. In addition, Btl-dependent activation of MAPK, which is seen normally in tracheal cells, is significantly decreased in these embryos. These results suggested the possible involvement of 6-O-sulfated heparan sulfate in the modulation of FGF signaling during tracheogenesis in Drosophila. Oregon-R was used as a wild type of Drosophila melanogaster. 1-eve-1 is an enhancer trap line at the trachealess (trh) locus (30Perrimon N. Noll E. McCall K. Brand A. Dev.

Unlabeled PAPS was from Sigma, Hiload Superdex 30 HR 16/60 and a fast desalting column were from Whatman (Clifton, NJ), and a pack polyamine column was from YMC (Kyoto, Japan).

DeacetylatedN-sulfated heparosan (NS-heparosan) was prepared by chemical deacetylation and N-sulfation of N-acetyl heparosan, which was prepared from Escherichia coli K5 by Dr. T.Saito (Kanagawa University). Chondroitin (squid skin) was prepared as described previously (32Habuchi O. Miyata K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 616: 208-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Hybond N+ was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Tokyo, Japan). The genomic sequence for a putativeDrosophila 6-O-sulfotransferase (dHS6ST) was identified in the Drosophila genome data base of the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP). Based on the sequence, the 938-base pairs PCR-amplified genomic DNA was prepared using the 5′-primer (TCTGCCCATCCAAAAAGACG) and the 3′-primer (CTGAAAGAGCAAAGTCTTGG). Approximately 2 × 105 plaques from a Drosophila larval cDNA library were screened using the above PCR product from dHS6ST genomic DNA as a probe. Hybridization was carried out as described by Sambrook et al. (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Four positive clones were isolated, and the inserted cDNAs were sequenced using the BigDye™ Thermal Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit and the ABI PRISM 310 analyzer. Nucleotide and amino acid sequences were analyzed using a DNASIS program version 3.5 (Hitachi). To express dHS6ST in tissue culture cells, pFLAG-CMV2-dHS6ST was constructed by insertion of the PCR product containing the open reading frame of 1374 base pairs from positions 589–1962 for dHS6ST into theHindIII/ClaI site of the pFLAG-CMV2 expression vector (Eastman Kodak Co.). COS-7 cells (5.5 × 105) precultured for 48 h in a 60-mm culture dish were transfected with 5 μg of pFLAG-CMV2-dHS6ST or pFLAG-CMV2 alone. The transfection was performed using a liposome-mediated method according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol (TransFast, Promega). The enzyme activities of HS6ST and HS2ST in the cell extract were determined using CDSNS-heparin as a substrate. In this experiment, HS2ST activity was specifically determined in the presence of 10 mm dithiothreitol as described previously (34Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4172-4179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Dithiothreitol at this concentration had little effect on HS2ST activity, whereas HS6ST activity was substantially decreased. FLAG fusion proteins in the cell extract were isolated by anti-FLAG M2 (Kodak) affinity chromatography according to the method described by the manufacturer, and the activities of purified dHS6ST in the FLAG-bound fractions were measured using 25 nmol (as hexosamine, 0.5 mm) of acceptor glycosaminoglycans in the 50-μl reaction mixture as described previously (35Habuchi H. Tanaka M. Habuchi O. Yoshida K. Suzuki H. Ban K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2859-2868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The amounts of enzymes added to the reaction mixture were chosen to obtain the linear incorporation of [35S]sulfate into CDSNS-heparin, which was 0.028 pmol/min (35Habuchi H. Tanaka M. Habuchi O.

We measured 35S incorporation activities into various glycosaminoglycans of the purified dHS6ST under those condition. Analysis of the reaction products derived from CDSNS-heparin and heparan sulfate (from a mouse EHS tumor) by expressed enzymes was performed as described previously (35Habuchi H. Tanaka M. Habuchi O.

Yoshida K. Kimata K. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Fixation and pretreatment of embryos were performed as described by Tautz and Pfeifle (37Tautz D. Pfeifle C. Chromosoma. 1989; 98: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2090) Google Scholar). RNA probes were prepared as follows. dHS6ST cDNA was inserted into pBluescript, and purified plasmid DNA was linearized by appropriate restriction enzymes. Sense and antisense RNA probes were prepared by in vitro transcription from linearized cDNA templates using digoxigenin-11-UTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and T7 or T3 RNA polymerase. After fragmentation into an average size of 400 nucleotides by heating at 60 °C in a buffer containing 40 mm NaHCO3, 60 mmNa2CO3, and 50 mm dithiothreitol, labeled RNAs were used as probes for hybridization. Hybridization and detection of hybridized probes were carried out as described by Hauptmann and Gerster (38Hauptmann G. Gerster T. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) and Tautz and Pfeifle (37Tautz D. Pfeifle C. Chromosoma. 1989; 98: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2090) Google Scholar), respectively. RNA interference was performed as previously described (39Kennerdell J.R. Carthew R.W. Cell. 1998; 95: 1017-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). RNAs were synthesized using T3 or T7 RNA polymerase and linearized plasmids as templates. For the annealing reaction, equimolar quantities of sense and antisense RNAs were mixed to a final concentration of 5 μm each and incubated at 67 °C for 10 min, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. RNA aliquots were ethanol-precipitated and dissolved in an injection buffer (40Rubin G.M. Spradling A.C. Science. 1982; 218: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2340) Google Scholar) to a final concentration of 5 μm. The average injection volume was 85 pl, ranging from 65 to 110 pl, as determined by measuring the diameter of droplets injected into halocarbon oil. Early embryos of 1-eve-1, the trachealess(trh)-lacZ line, were collected within 2 h of egg laying and injected with dHS6ST double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or a buffer only. Injected embryos were allowed to develop at 25 °C for 11 h to observe tracheal phenotypes or for 7 h to detect MAPK activation, and subjected to the staining procedure. β-Galactosidase expressed in1-eve-1 enhancer trap embryos was detected using rabbit polyclonal antiserum (Cappel) at a 1:500 dilution in PBT (5% goat serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline). Anti-dpMAPK (Sigma), which recognizes activated diphospho-MAPK was used at 1: 200. After repeated washes with PBT, the primary antibody was visualized using the Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) and horseradish peroxidase immunochemistry following the protocol recommended by the manufactures. Embryos were mounted in 80% glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline and photographed using Olympus BX50 microscopy. A genomic sequence, AE003728, which has been mapped to 92C on the third chromosome (BDGP), was identified as a clone bearing sequences with significant homology to mouse heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 (mHS6ST-1) (35Habuchi H. Tanaka M. Habuchi O. Yoshida K. Suzuki H. Ban K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2859-2868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We named this gene presumptive Drosophila heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase (dHS6ST). To isolate adHS6ST cDNA, a Drosophila larval cDNA library was screened with the PCR-amplified genomic fragment as a probe. From ∼2 × 105 plaques, four independent positive clones were obtained and sequenced. Comparison of the dHS6ST cDNA and the AE003728 genomic sequences revealed that dHS6ST spans 79.0 kilobase pairs of the genome and contains six exons separated by five introns, with the second intron being more than 67 kilobase pairs in size (Fig.1 A). Around the genomic region corresponding to the 5′ end of the cloned dHS6ST cDNA, we identified the sequence TCAGTT, which matches theDrosophila consensus sequence for an initiator “TCA(G/T)T(T/C)” (+1 site is underlined, Fig.1 B) (41Hultmark D. Klemenz R. Gehring W.J. Cell. 1986; 44: 429-438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 42Purnell B.A. Emanuel P.A. Gilmour D.S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 830-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 43Arkhipova I.R. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1359-1369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although a typical TATA box was not found in this region, the sequence GGACGTT is highly similar to the downstream promoter element (DPE), which is contained in many TATA-less promoters in Drosophila, at a typical position from the initiator sequence (+28 to +34 in Fig. 1 B) (44Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3020-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The occurrence of these sequences predicted the transcription start site as the A residue shown by +1 in Fig. 1 B. The cDNA clone that we have sequenced therefore appears to be nearly full-length. Northern blot analysis showed that dHS6ST encodes a single major transcript of ∼3.1 kilobase pairs (data not shown). BDGP suggested the existence of several genes around thedHS6ST locus (Fig. 1 A). miranda, which encodes a cytoskeletal structural protein affecting the asymmetric division of neuroblasts, was contained within in the fifth intron ofdHS6ST (45Ikeshima-Kataoka H. Skeath J.B. Nabeshima Y. Doe C.Q. Matsuzaki F. Nature. 1997; 390: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 46Shen C.P. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cell. 1997; 90: 449-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). An EST clone, GH26202, derived from an adult head cDNA library, was mapped to the second intron of thedHS6ST gene. Furthermore, the 5′ sequence of an EST clone, LD07688, was found to start at 499 base pairs upstream of the 5′ end ofdHS6ST in a reverse direction. The complete cDNA and predicted amino acid sequences for dHS6ST are presented in Fig. 2 A. The amino-terminal sequence contains three in-frame ATG codons. Out of three ATGs, the third one appears to be the most likely initiation codon, judging from the Drosophila consensus translation initiation sequence (47Cavener D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). The pattern of the hydropathy plot for the amino acid sequence started from the third ATG also matches those for mammalian homologues of dHS6ST (Fig. 2 B) (35Habuchi H. Tanaka M. Habuchi O. Yoshida K. Suzuki H. Ban K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2859-2868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 48Habuchi H. Kobayashi M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9208-9213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The predicted protein was composed of 432 amino acid residues with two putativeN-linked glycosylation sites. A hydropathy plot of dHS6ST showed the type II transmembrane structure of a Golgi resident protein with one prominent hydrophobic segment in the amino-terminal region that extends from amino acid residue 9 to 20. A comparison of the primary structures of mammalian andDrosophila HS6STs revealed that the amino acid sequence of dHS6ST is 53%, 54%, 46%, and 53% identical to the sequences of human HS6ST (hHS6ST), mouse HS6ST-1, -2, and -3 (mHS6STs), respectively. Although relatively low levels of similarity were observed in both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions among HS6STs, the amino acid sequences of the central region are highly conserved (Fig. 3). Putative PAPS binding sites were present in these regions of all these proteins (49Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 50Sueyoshi T. Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.C. Wall F.E. Pedersen L.G. Negishi M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, all HS6STs bear two N-glycosylation sites at conserved positions. The predicted amino acid sequence of dHS6ST therefore shows all the structural features of HS6STs reported previously. To determine whether the isolated dHS6STcDNA encodes a protein with HS6ST activity, we examined the activity of dHS6ST expressed in tissue culture cells. dHS6STcDNA was inserted in a mammalian expression vector, pFLAG-CMV2, and COS-7 cells were transfected with this construct or with pFLAG-CMV2 alone as a control. HS6ST activity in the cells transfected withdHS6ST was approximately twice as high as that with the control vector, whereas the dHS6ST cDNA insert did not increase the HS2ST activity (Table I). These results confirmed that recombinant dHS6ST produces HS6ST activity.Table IOverexpression of dHS6ST in COS-7 cellsPlasmidsSulfotransferase activitiesHS6STHS2STpmol/min/mg proteinpFLAG-CMV21.8 ± 0.24.6 ± 0.5pFLAG-CMV2-dHS6ST3.6 ± 0.83.8 ± 0.1COS-7 cells were transfected with a vector alone or a plasmid containing dHS6ST, and the enzyme activities of HS6ST and HS2ST in the cell extract were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values represent means ± S.D. of triplicate independent experiments. The activities in the absence of exogenous CDSNS-heparin were usually less than 0.1 pmol/min/mg of protein. Open table in a new tab COS-7 cells were transfected with a vector alone or a plasmid containing dHS6ST, and the enzyme activities of HS6ST and HS2ST in the cell extract were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values represent means ± S.D. of triplicate independent experiments. The activities in the absence of exogenous CDSNS-heparin were usually less than 0.1 pmol/min/mg of protein. To further analyze this enzyme, we purified the epitope-tagged dHS6ST protein and examined the sulfotransferase activity using several heparin derivatives, heparan sulfates, and chondroitin as substrates (Table II). The dHS6ST was able to transfer sulfate to CDSNS-heparin, NS-heparosan, heparin, and heparan sulfate but was marginally active using CDSNAc-heparin and chondroitin as substrates. The ratio of the activity of dHS6ST toward NS-heparosan to that toward CDSNS-heparin was 0.36. Since NS-heparosan contains only glucuronic acid and not its epimer iduronic acid, this result suggests a preference of dHS6ST for iduronic acid adjacent to the targetedN-sulfoglucosamine.Table IIAcceptor substrate specificities of the recombinant dHS6ST purified by anti-FLAG antibody affinity column chromatographySubstratesRelative sulfotransferase activity of dHS6ST%CDSNS-heparin100CDSNAc-heparin2.2NS-heparosan"

In this report, the Tc85–11 domain for cell binding and its corresponding receptor on epithelial cell LLC-MK2are described. Using synthetic peptides corresponding to the Tc85–11 carboxyl-terminal segment, we show that the mammalian cell-binding domain colocalizes to the most conserved motif of the trypanosome gp85/trans-sialidase supergene family (VTVXNVFLYNR). Even though Tc85–11 binds to laminin, the 19-residue cell-binding peptide (peptide J) does not contain the laminin-binding site, because it does not bind to laminin or inhibit cell binding to this glycoprotein. The host cell receptor for the peptide was characterized as cytokeratin 18. Addition of anti-cytokeratin antibodies to the culture medium significantly inhibited the infection of epithelial cells byT. cruzi. Tc85–11 is a multiadhesive glycoprotein, encoding at least two different binding sites, one for laminin and one for cytokeratin 18, that allow the parasite to overcome the barriers imposed by cell membranes, extracellular matrices, and basal laminae to reach the definitive host cell.

Chagas' disease is a chronic and incapacitating illness, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi when infective trypomastigotes invade host cells (1Colli W. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1257-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The protozoan is transmitted to humans by wound contamination with insect feces during blood sucking. A particularly important portal of entry is the ocular conjunctiva that is put in contact with contaminated insect feces by involuntary scratching from nearby bites on a sleeping person's face, leading to a periorbital swelling known as Romaña's sign. Other forms of transmission such as blood transfusion, congenital transmission, and breast feeding are also important, particularly in northern hemisphere regions that received intense migratory currents from Ibero-American countries. In recent years, 85–90-kDa parasite surface proteins have been implicated in host cell invasion by different investigators (2Burleigh B.A. Andrews N.W. Annu. Rev.

These proteins, collectively denominated Tc85, form a population of heterogeneous glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored surface glycoproteins with similar molecular masses but different electric charges (7Abuin G. Colli W. Souza W. Alves M.J.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 35: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 8Katzin A.M. Colli W. Biochim. Biophys.

Tc85 proteins belong to the gp85/trans-sialidase gene superfamily (12Cross G.A.M. Takle G.B. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 385-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and share common motifs with bacterial neuraminidases (1Colli W. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1257-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 12Cross G.A.M. Takle G.B. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 385-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 13Schenkman S.

Interestingly, all members of the superfamily contain a conserved sequence (VTVXNVFLYNR) (12Cross G.A.M. Takle G.B. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 385-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) upstream from the carboxyl terminus and absent in bacterial neuraminidases. The involvement of at least one member of the Tc85 family in parasite-host cell interactions is indicated by the observation that the monoclonal antibody H1A10, which specifically recognizes Tc85 glycoproteins, inhibits host cell invasion by the parasite in vitro by 50–90% (6Alves M.J.M. Abuin G. Kuwajima V.J. Colli W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 21: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 7Abuin G. Colli W. Souza W. Alves M.J.M. Mol. Biochem.

An acidic 786-amino acid member of the Tc85 family (Tc85–11) and a recombinant fusion protein of the monoclonal antibody H1A10 epitope-containing carboxyl-terminal segment of Tc85–11 (Tc85–1) both showed adhesive properties to isolated laminin and to entire cells (10Giordano R.

The high plasticity of the cytoskeleton is often exploited by pathogens to enter non-phagocytic cells. Increasing evidence has been provided for the expression of cytoskeletal proteins on cell surfaces that serve as receptors for different ligands. For example, intermediate filament proteins belonging to the cytokeratin family are expressed on the cell surface and act as receptors for bacteria as well as for plasminogen and tissue plasminogen activator, high molecular weight kininogen, and thrombin-antithrombin complexes (14Hembrough T.A.

The present work demonstrates that the conserved common sequence VTVXNVFLYNR of the gp85 glycoprotein/trans-sialidase supergene family is a mammalian cell-binding domain. Its host cell receptor for this motif was purified and characterized as cytokeratin 18 (CK18)1 present on the surface of LLC-MK2 cells (monkey kidney epithelial cells). Because Tc85 also binds to laminin (10Giordano R. Fouts D.L. Tewari D. Colli W. Manning J.E. Alves M.J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3461-3468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), the results presented herein suggest that the Tc85 family is composed of multiadhesive glycoproteins that bind to different receptor molecules either located on the cell surface or belonging to components of the extracellular matrix. T. cruzi strain Y was used throughout. Culture conditions for parasites and mammalian cells are described elsewhere (21Andrews N.W. Colli W. J. Protozool. 1982; 14: 447-451Google Scholar). Peptides were synthesized in an automated bench top simultaneous multiple solid phase peptide synthesizer (PSSM 8 system from Shimadzu) using the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) procedure. The synthesized peptides were deprotected and purified by semipreparative HPLC using an Econosil C-18 column (10 μm, 22.5 × 250 mm) and a two-solvent system: (A) trifluoroacetic acid/H2O (1:1000) and (B) trifluoroacetic acid/MeCN/H2O (1:900:100). The peptides were separated at a flow rate of 5 ml/min and a gradient from 10 (or 30) to 50 (or 60)% of solvent B. Analytical HPLC was performed using a binary HPLC system (Shimadzu) with an SPD-10AV Shimadzu UV-visible detector and a Shimadzu RF-535 fluorescence detector, coupled to an Ultrasphere C-18 column (5 μm, 4.6 × 150 mm), which was eluted with solvent systems A1 (H3PO4/H2O, 1:1000) and B1 (MeCN/H2O/H3PO4, 900:100:1) at a flow rate of 1.7 ml/min and a 10–80% gradient of B1 over 15 min. The HPLC column eluates were monitored by their absorbance at 220 nm and by fluorescence emission at 420 nm following excitation at 320 nm. The purity of obtained peptides was checked by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) spectroscopy in the reflectron mode (TofSpec-E from Micromass, Manchester, UK) and by amino acid sequencing, performed with a Shimadzu sequencer, model PPSQ-23 (22Kates S.A. Alberecio F. Solidphase Synthesis: A Practical Guide. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York2000Google Scholar). In a 24-well plate, 40 μg of each peptide in 200 μl of 10% Me2SO were dried overnight at 37 °C with agitation, washed with PBS (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.3), and incubated for 2 h with 1% BSA/PBS. LLC-MK2 cells were cultured as described (6Alves M.J.M. Abuin G. Kuwajima V.J. Colli W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 21: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) in a 75-cm2 bottle, removed by trypsin, and resuspended in 5 ml of DME medium supplemented with 10% FCS. The cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 50-ml polyethylene tubes (Corning) and washed twice with DME medium to remove FCS. Then, 1 × 105 cells in 0.5 ml of DME medium were added to the peptide-coated wells and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The wells were washed three times with DME medium and analyzed using an inverted microscope. In binding competition assays, LLC-MK2 cells were preincubated for 15 min with the peptide acting as a competitor and added to peptide-coated wells. After incubation and washing as described, the number of bound cells was quantified following staining with crystal violet (23Morla A. Zhang Z. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1994; 367: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Peptide J was radiolabeled with 125I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the chloramine-T method (24Roth J. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 37: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and purified by reverse-phase HPLC, resulting in a specific activity of 2 × 107 cpm μg−1. LLC-MK2 cells were collected as described above, and 6 × 105 cells were incubated for 2 h on ice in the presence of increasing concentrations of the radiolabeled peptide. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled peptide J. The reaction mixtures were washed three times to remove unbound radiolabeled ligand, and cells were lysed in 1% SDS for 10 min and directly assayed for radioactivity by scintillation counting. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. LLC-MK2 and K562 cells were collected as described, washed three times with PBS, and biotinylated with the EZ-Link-Sulfo-NHS-biotinylation kit (Pierce) as recommended by the manufacturer. Plasma membranes were prepared (25Borrow P. Oldstone M.B.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7270-7281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and solubilized in 100 mm β-d-n-octyl glucoside for 2 h at 4 °C. Peptide J was synthesized with an additional cysteine at the amino terminus. One mg of peptide J was coupled to a solid matrix (UltraLinkTM iodoacetyl, Pierce) and used for affinity chromatography experiments. The supernatants from solubilizations in β-d-n-octyl glucoside were incubated overnight with the peptide J affinity gel at 4 °C with agitation. The gel was loaded into a column, and the column was washed with 40 volumes of 25 mm β-d-n-octyl glucoside in incubation buffer. The gel was then washed with 1 m NaCl, followed by agitation for 1 h at room temperature. The column was washed again with 40 column volumes of PBS and then incubated with 8m urea as above. The collected fractions were dialyzed, concentrated, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) in 9% gels. Following analysis by SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to a supported nitrocellulose membrane using 25 mm Tris, 150 mm glycine, and 20% methanol (pH 8.3) as transfer buffer. The blots were blocked with 3% BSA in TBSTT (Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.03% Triton X-100) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with ExtrAvidin-peroxidase (Sigma) or anti-PAN-cytokeratin antibody (Sigma), as recommended by the manufacturer. The latter recognizes cytokeratins 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 13, and 18. The membrane was washed with TBSTT and, when necessary, incubated with the secondary antibody conjugated to peroxidase. The reaction was developed with the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membrane fractions from LLC-MK2 and K562 cells were prepared as described (25Borrow P. Oldstone M.B.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7270-7281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and incubated for 2 h on ice with 125I-peptide J in the presence and absence of a 100-fold excess of unlabeled peptide. The receptor-ligand complexes were separated from unbound ligands by centrifugation and washed once with PBS, 0.01% Triton X-100. Chemical cross-linking was initiated by addition of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, 100 mm final concentration (Sigma). After 30 min of incubation on ice the reaction was stopped with 150 mmglycine, pH 6.8. Samples were then washed twice with PBS and solubilized for 2 h at 4 °C in PBS containing 100 mm β-d-n-octyl glucoside, 1 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm N-α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and 125I-peptide J-protein complexes were detected by autoradiography. Trypomastigotes were washed twice with DME medium and purified by centrifugation over a Lymphoprep gradient (Nycomed Pharma AS) to eliminate contaminating host cells and cell debris. CK18 (Research Diagnostics) was radioiodinated using the chloramine-T method (24Roth J. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 37: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and purified on a G-25 Sepharose column. Purified trypomastigotes (9 × 106) in a total volume of 200 μl were incubated with 1 × 106 cpm of 125I-CK18 (8.6 × 105 cpm μg−1) in the presence and absence of a 20-fold excess of unlabeled CK18 for 2 h on ice. The incubation mixtures were separated by filtration over nitrocellulose filters previously saturated with 0.1% BSA, and the filter-bound radioactivity was quantified using scintillation counting. T. cruzi trypomastigotes were cultured as described (6Alves M.J.M. Abuin G. Kuwajima V.J. Colli W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 21: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). LLC-MK2 cells grown in an 8-well dish were washed three times with DME medium, and each well was incubated for 15 min in DME medium supplemented with 2% FCS containing 200 μmalanine-substituted peptide (peptide J-Ala), 100 or 200 μm peptide J, 10 μm Tc85–11, mouse IgG (Sigma), or a 1:20 dilution of an anti-CK18 antibody (Research Diagnostics). These cells were infected with trypomastigotes in a 1:100 ratio for 2 h at 37 °C and washed twice with PBS. The nonadherent parasites were removed by addition of Lymphoprep to the cell layers, followed by two washes with PBS. The cells were incubated with DME medium supplemented with 2% FCS for 48 h at 37 °C, fixed with 100% methanol, and stained with chromomycin A (Molecular Probes). All experiments were performed in triplicate, and 12 photos of each replicate were made using a digital video-imaging fluorescence microscope, enabling the counting of infected and non-infected cells in samples containing 200 cells each. The data were compared for statistical significance using the unpaired Student's ttest. LLC-MK2 cells were adhered to peptide J or FCS-coated 30-mm glass coverslips as described above and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with either anti-PAN-cytokeratin antibody (Sigma) or specific anti-CK18 antibody (Research Diagnostics), diluted as recommended by the manufacturers, washed five times with PBS, and then incubated under the same conditions with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (1:30 dilution) and rinsed five times. In experiments where K562 cells, which do not bind to peptide J, were used, cells were washed by centrifugation at 1,000 × g. The same protocol was used for saponin-treated cells, except that 0.05% saponin was added during incubation with the antibodies. Fractions of the affinity column-purified and biotinylated 45 kDa-protein from LLC-MK2 cells were determined to be cytokeratin 18 by mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides at the HHMI Biopolymer Laboratory and W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University (New Haven, CT). To define the Tc85–1 cell-binding site, we synthesized 11 peptides with five amino acid overlaps that spanned the carboxyl-terminal segment of the recombinant Tc85–11 protein. These peptides were used to coat the surface of 24-well plates and mediate LLC-MK2 cell adhesion. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the cells only adhered significantly to the well coated with peptide J (19 amino acids) that contained the VTVTNVFLYNR motif. This motif is highly conserved and present in all members of the gp85/trans-sialidase superfamily. This observation implicates the importance of that common sequence in the binding of members of the gp85/trans-sialidase supergene family to their host cell receptors (Fig. 1 B). Other cell lines that are invaded by T. cruzi were tested for their affinity for peptide J. In addition to LLC-MK2 cells, tumor cells (B16F10), human umbilical cord endothelial cells (ECV), macrophage-like cells (J774), mouse fibroblast cells (3T3), and mouse pheochromocytoma cells (PC-12) bound to peptide J (data not shown). Consistent with a crucial function of peptide J in cell invasion, mouse erythrocytes and K562 erythroleukemia cells (27Ruiz R.C. Favoreto Jr., S. Dorta M.L. Oshiro M.E. Ferreira A.T. Manque P.M. Yoshida N. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) that are not invaded by T. cruzi did not bind to peptide J. Additional evidence for the physiological relevance of peptide J binding to mammalian cells is that a 10 μm concentration of this peptide inhibited the binding of the recombinant Tc85–11 protein to the host cell. As opposed to Tc85–11, peptide J does not bind to laminin; nor does it inhibit cell binding to laminin. Furthermore, it was established that peptide J does not bind to cells at the same receptor used by laminin or to laminin on its cell-binding domain, because different concentrations of this glycoprotein did not affect LLC-MK2 adhesion to peptide J. The combined data strongly suggest that the Tc85–11 recombinant protein is a molecule with multiple adhesion sites, specific for different ligands of the vertebrate host cell. Radioiodinated peptide J binds to LLC-MK2 cells in a specific, saturable manner, as shown by nonlinear saturation analysis (Fig. 2). The data suggest 1.66 ± 0.16 × 106 binding sites with aK D of 175 ± 56 nm. The number of binding sites is comparable with that determined for plasminogen binding to CK8 (15Hembrough T.A. Li L. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25684-25691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cytokeratin 8 associates with CK18 to form an intermediate filament heteropolymer in several cell types. To identify the minimal sequence that is relevant for the binding of peptide J to the host cell, truncated peptides were constructed spanning the whole sequence of peptide J. Cells were layered on peptide J-coated plates, and truncated peptides were checked for their competing ability for cell adhesion. The minimal inhibitory sequence was VTNVFLYNRPL (data not shown). To identify the residues responsible for this binding, each amino acid of the minimal inhibitory sequence was consecutively substituted by alanine, and the modified sequences were tested for their inhibitory effects in adhesion assays of peptide J to cells. It was observed that substitution in some positions resulted in the loss of the inhibitory effect on the binding of cells to peptide J (Fig.3). These experiments strongly indicate that the amino acid sequence VTXVFLYXR, conserved in most members of the 85-kDa trypomastigote surface glycoprotein family, is essential for parasite-cell interaction. In 40 analyzed sequences (Fig. 1 B), LYXR was present in all members of the family, whereas the first Val residue that is found in 80% of the sequences was substituted in the remaining sequences by Leu or Ala, which are also apolar amino acids. Threonine, at position 2, showed a smaller degree of conservation (38%), most often being replaced by other polar residues: Ser (15%), Asn (20%), and Lys (15%). The valine at position 4 is again highly conserved (95%), and Leu substitutes Phe at position 5 in 38% of the molecules. To characterize the host cell receptor for peptide J, the peptide was coupled to an affinity matrix and used for purification of the receptor, employing chromatographic methods. The affinity matrix was incubated with solubilized membranes from biotinylated LLC-MK2 cells. The 8 m urea eluates of the LLC-MK2 cell extracts revealed a biotinylated 45-kDa molecule that was detected by Western blot (Fig.4). To obtain further evidence that the 45-kDa molecule is the host cell receptor, radioiodinated peptide J was chemically cross-linked with LLC-MK2 cells. For a negative control, we also performed the experiment using K562 cells, which were neither infected byT. cruzi nor adhered to surfaces coated with peptide J. As an additional control, an alanine-substituted peptide, peptide J-Ala (VTNVFAYNRPL), that does not inhibit cell binding to peptide J was radiolabeled and cross-linked to LLC-MK2 cells. Following solubilization and separation of plasma membrane proteins by SDS-PAGE, a protein migrating with a molecular mass of 45 KDa was detected only in the LLC-MK2 cell extract (Fig.5). The labeling of the 45-kDa protein was specific, because it could be inhibited by a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled peptide. As expected, no specific labeling of K562 cells by 125I-peptide J was observed, and the peptide J-Ala did not bind to LLC-MK2 cells. These results strongly suggest that a 45-kDa molecule present on LLC-MK2 cells is involved in adhesion of the parasite to these cells. Purified 45-kDa biotinylated protein fractions, as described in Fig. 4, were digested with trypsin, and the peptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry. The identified peptides from three independent experiments indicated that the 45-kDa molecule was biotinylated CK18. In agreement with the mass spectrometry analysis, the isolated protein comigrated with authentic cytokeratin 18 with an apparent molecular mass of 45 kDa and a pI of 5.4 in a two-dimensional SDS-PAGE (data not shown). To further confirm these results, LLC-MK2 and K562 plasma membrane extracts were incubated with the peptide J affinity column, and after elution with 1m NaCl and 8 m urea, the eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and tested by Western blot with anti-PAN-cytokeratin antibody. As shown in Fig.6 A, a cytokeratin molecule of 45 kDa is present only in 8 m eluates of LLC-MK2 cells. As expected, no K562 cytokeratin could be eluted from the peptide J column. Furthermore, 125I-CK18 bound to the peptide J affinity column and showed the same elution pattern as CK18 from LLC-MK2 cells (Fig. 6 B). Control BSA columns did not bind CK18. The fact that the anti-PAN-cytokeratin antibody, which recognized many proteins in the cell extract, was able to recognize only CK18 in the column eluate suggests a highly specific binding. Intact LLC-MK2 and K562 cells were tested for the presence of cytokeratin by immunofluorescence microscopy with fluorescent anti-CK18-specific antibody (Fig. 7). Whereas CK18 is present in the cytoplasm of both cell lines, only LLC-MK2cells express cytokeratin on the surface. Moreover,125I-labeled CK18 binds in a specific manner to trypomastigotes (Fig. 8) but not to epimastigotes, the non-invasive developmental form of T. cruzi (data not shown).Figure 8125 I-CK18 binds to T. cruzi trypomastigote cells. 9 × 106purified trypomastigotes were incubated with 1 × 106cpm of 125I-CK18 in the presence (black bar) and absence (white bar) of a 20-fold excess of unlabeled CK18. The incubation mixtures were separated by filtration over nitrocellulose filters that were previously saturated with 0.1% BSA, and the filter-bound radioactivity was quantified using scintillation counting. The data show the average of triplicate determinations ± S.D. of two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown in Fig. 9, previous incubation of peptide J-coated wells with CK18 (100 μg/ml) completely inhibited cell adhesion to the wells. Furthermore, previous incubation of LLC-MK2 cells with anti-CK18 antibody inhibited cell adhesion to peptide J by 75%. Addition of 100 μm peptide J completely inhibited the binding, whereas 100 μmpeptide J-Ala had no effect. The effects of peptide J, Tc85–11, and CK18 on the invasion of LLC-MK2 cells by trypomastigote forms were analyzed by invasion assays in the presence of these molecules. The data show statistically significant (p < 0.05) differences among the number of infected cells in the absence and presence of peptide J, recombinant Tc85–11, and anti-CK18 antibody and when both peptide J and anti-CK18 antibodies were added simultaneously (Fig. 10). Thus previous incubation of LLC-MK2 cells with peptide J and Tc85–11 increases cell invasion by T. cruzi, whereas the anti-CK antibody inhibits invasion by more than 60%. The effect of peptide J on cell invasion depends on the concentration used, suggesting a role for the conserved sequence in Tc-85 as a signaling molecule that will prepare the epithelial host cell for parasite invasion. When host cells were previously incubated with anti-CK18 antibody, the increase in infection promoted by peptide J could not be observed (Fig. 10). As controls, invasion assays were performed in the presence of mouse IgG and peptide J-Ala, both of which had no effect on invasion. T. cruzi invades non-phagocytic cells in an energy-dependent manner (28Schenkman S. Robbins E.S. Nussenzweig V. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 645-654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by a mechanism different from phagocytosis.

In the rat P2X2 receptor, we mutated amino acids in this segment and adjoining flanking regions (Asp15 through Thr60) individually to cysteine and expressed the constructs in human embryonic kidney cells. Whole-cell recordings were used to measure membrane currents evoked by brief (2-s) applications of ATP (0.3–100 μm). Currents were normal except for Y16C, R34C, Y43C, Y55C, and Q56C (no currents but normal membrane expression by immunohistochemistry), Q37C (small currents), and F44C (normal current but increased sensitivity to ATP, as well as αβ-methylene-ATP). We used methanethiosulfonates of positive, negative, or no charge to test the accessibility of the substituted cysteines. D15C, P19C, V23C, V24C, G30C, Q37C, F44C, and V48C were strongly inhibited by neutral, membrane-permeant methanethiosulfonates. Only V48C was also inhibited by positively and negatively charged methanethiosulfonates, consistent with an extracellular position; however, accessibility of V48C was increased by channel opening. V48C could disulfide with I328C, as shown by the large increase in ATP-evoked current caused by reducing agents. The results suggest that Val48 at the outer end of the first hydrophobic segment takes part in the gating movement of channel opening.

Hydrophobicity plots for P2X receptors suggest that two parts of the protein are sufficiently long and hydrophobic to cross the plasma membrane (1North R.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 474-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These are the regions, in the P2X2 receptor, of Leu29 to Val51 and of Ile331 to Leu353. Considerable experimental evidence now supports the view that the N and the C termini are intracellular, and the region between Val51 and Ile331 faces the extracellular aspect. First, antibodies against N- and C-terminal epitopes work only in permeabilized cells (2Torres G.E. Egan T.M. Voigt M.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Second, the proteins can be glycosylated at both natural and artificially introduced consensus sequences (NX(S/T)) at several positions in the extracellular domain from Pro62 to Lys324 (in the P2X2 receptor), though not at such positions in the N terminus (positions 9, 16, or 26) (2Torres G.E. Egan T.M. Voigt M.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 3Newbolt A. Stoop R. Virginio C. Surprenant A. North R.A. Buell G. Rassendren F. J. Biol.

Third, concatenated cDNAs in which the C terminus of one construct is joined to the N terminus of a second form functional channels (5Stoop R. Thomas S. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. Buell G. Surprenant A. North R.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). There is now biochemical evidence that the P2X receptors form channels as trimers (6Nicke A. Baumert H.G. Rettinger J. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3016-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 7Nicke A. Rettinger J. Buttner C. Eichele A. Lambrecht G. Schmalzing G. Prog. Brain Res. 1999; 120: 61-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the parts of the individual subunits that contribute to different functions of the receptor are little understood. Mutations of several positively charged residues have been shown to decrease the effectiveness of ATP as an agonist at the P2X1 (8Ennion S. Hagan S. Evans R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29361-29367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) and P2X2 (9Jiang L.-H. Rassendren F. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34190-34196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) receptors, and these residues occupy corresponding positions (e.g. Lys69, Lys71, Lys188, Arg290, Arg304, and Lys308 in rat P2X2 numbering). The region around Lys69 and Lys71 is of particular interest with regard to a possible ATP binding site. The P2X2 receptor functions normally when Ile67 is mutated to cysteine (I67C). However, the attachment of a negatively charged methanethiosulfonate ((2-sulfonatoethyl) methanethiosulfonate; MTSES1) led to a parallel rightward shift in the ATP concentration-response curve that was not seen with neutral (methyl methanethiosulfonate; MTSM) or positively charged methanethiosulfonate ([2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate; MTSET). Point mutations that introduced a negative charge (I67E and I67D), but not those that introduced a positive charge (I67R and I67K), also caused inhibition of the current that could be overcome by increasing the ATP concentration. Together these results provide strong evidence that this region of the receptor contributes to the ATP binding site (9Jiang L.-H. Rassendren F. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34190-34196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). When ATP binds to the P2X receptor the protein undergoes a conformational change that results in the opening of a cation-permeable channel. The substituted cysteine accessibility method has also been used to implicate residues in and around the second transmembrane domain in the formation of the ion-conducting pathway (10Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3446-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 11Egan T.M. Haines W.R. Voigt M.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2350-2359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, P2X2-T336C is almost completely blocked by exposure for 8 min to MTSET and MTSES; both negatively and positively charged MTS reagents were effective, suggesting that Thr336is located outside the membrane electric field, but the finding that outward currents were blocked more rapidly than inward currents indicates that the attached side chain might directly interfere with permeation (10Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3446-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Another residue within the second hydrophobic segment (Asp349) showed prominent block by MTSEA, but not by MTSET and MTSES. This block did not occur if the MTSEA was applied without opening, and in view of the fact that MTSEA is quite permeable through the P2X2 receptor channel, this suggests that Asp349 is situated internal to the “gate” of the channel (10Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3446-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present experiments was to ascertain whether residues in and around the first hydrophobic segment might also contribute to the ATP binding site or to the permeation pathway. P2X receptors are not well conserved in the regions corresponding to the first 14 amino acids of the P2X2 receptor, and we therefore began our cysteine substitutions at Asp15. We have recently reported the effects of MTS compounds on the region Asp57to Lys71 (9Jiang L.-H. Rassendren F. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34190-34196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar); in the present experiments we ended the cysteine substitutions at Thr60 (see Fig. 1). As a first approach we used MTSM, a small, neutral methanethiosulfonate, in conjunction with point mutations to cysteine. We reasoned that this might provide a picture of cysteines accessible to the aqueous environment on both the intracellular and extracellular aspects of the receptor. We followed this with tests of positively and negatively charged methanethiosulfonates for those positions at which MTSM caused a large inhibition. In an effort to understand further the mechanism of the inhibition we studied the effect on the ATP concentration-response curve and asked whether the inhibition required channel opening. Finally, we sought to determine whether substituted cysteines in the two transmembrane domains were sufficiently close to form disulfide bonds. A P2X2 subunit cDNA carrying a C terminus epitope was used; its source and the methods used for introducing point mutations were as described previously (10Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3446-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). All mutants were sequenced on both strands. Transient transfection of human embryonic kidney 293 cells using Lipofectin or LipofectAMINE 2000 was as described previously (10Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A.

Internal solution contained (in mm): 145 NaF, 10 EGTA, and 10 HEPES; external solution was (in mm): 147 NaCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 13 glucose, and 10 HEPES. Current-voltage relations were obtained by ramp voltages (1-s duration) from −120 to 40 mV. The following MTS reagents used were obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals (Ontario, Canada): MTSEA, MTSET, MTSES, MTSM, and butyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSB). MTSM and MTSB were used from a 1 m stock solution that was made in Me2SO and kept as frozen aliquots; stock solutions (100 mm) for the other MTS compounds were made daily by dissolving the solid in control external solution kept at 4 °C. All MTS compounds were diluted to 1 mm immediately prior (2–5 min) to their application. Numerical estimates of EC50 values were made for individual cells by least squares curve fitting as previously described (9Jiang L.-H. Rassendren F. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34190-34196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), using the function I/Imax = [ATP]n/(EC50n + [ATP]n), where I is the current as a fraction of the maximum current (Imax). The figures show this function fitted to the mean for all cells tested. Results are shown as means ± S.E. Tests of significance between paired observations were by Student's t test or non-parametric Mann-Whitney test; the effect of MTSM at many different positions was compared with that on the wild-type channel by analysis of variance, followed by Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test (InStat software; GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Results were considered significant for p< 0.05. Immunohistochemical methods were as described previously (10Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3446-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The mouse monoclonal anti-EYMPME antibody (used at 1:1000 dilution) was obtained from BabCo (Richmond, CA), and secondary antibody was tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:100 dilution; Sigma). We introduced cysteine into each position individually and studied the actions of ATP on human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing the mutated receptors. ATP (30 μm) elicited currents not distinguishable from those in cells expressing wild-type receptors (1–8 nA) for all the mutated receptors except Y16C, R34C, Q37C, Y43C, F44C, Y55C, and Q56C. Cells expressing Y16C, R34C, Y43C, Y55C, and Q56C showed no responses to ATP (up to 3 or 10 mm); immunohistochemistry showed staining of the plasma membrane in these cells. For Q37C, ATP-evoked currents were smaller (0.3 to 2 nA), and the EC50 was about three times higher than for the wild-type receptor (29 ± 5.7 μm; n = 4). Cells expressing two further mutations (T18C and L29C) responded well to an initial application of ATP, but the current declined steeply with repeated applications, and they could therefore not be usefully studied. At T18C, the current also declined during the ATP application more rapidly than seen at wild-type channels; at the end of a 2-s application (30 μm) the current was 43 ± 7% (n = 5) of its peak for T18C and 89 ± 2.8% (n = 8) for the wild-type receptor. This is similar to the finding of Boué-Grabot et al. (16Boué-Grabot E. Archambault V. Séguéla P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10190-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) for T18A. At F44C, cysteine substitution caused three distinct changes in the properties of the receptor. First, ATP-evoked currents returned back to the baseline level more slowly than normal after a brief (2-s) application. The times required to return to half the peak current at the end of ATP application were 0.44 ± 0.04 s (n= 15) for wild-type receptors (30 μm ATP) and 1.2 ± 0.8 (n = 9; 3 μm ATP) or 1.6 ± 0.05 s (n = 29; 30 μm ATP) for F44C. Second, there was 10-fold increase in sensitivity to ATP (EC50 0.72 ± 0.1 μm; n= 4). Third, there was a remarkable increase in effectiveness of αβmeATP. The wild-type P2X2 receptor is essentially insensitive to αβmeATP (13Evans R.J. Lewis C. Buell G. North R.A. Surprenant A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 178-183PubMed Google Scholar); indeed, we found that 100 and 300 μm αβmeATP evoked currents in cells expressing wild-type P2X2 receptors were, respectively, 1.1 ± 0.2 and 8.1 ± 1.3% (n = 5) of the currents evoked by 100 μm ATP. In contrast, at F44C receptors αβmeATP activated currents with an EC50 value of 10.8 ± 0.5 μm (n = 4), and the maximum current evoked by αβmeATP (100 μm) (1.7 ± 0.2 nA; n = 5) was similar to that evoked by a maximal concentration of ATP (3 μm) (1.2 ± 0.2 nA;n = 5). There was no difference in the holding current between cells expressing F44C and wild-type receptors. We used MTSM for an initial screen of this segment of the receptor; it is small and uncharged, and we expected that it would cross the membrane readily and react with accessible residues on either the cytoplasmic or the extracellular part of the receptor protein. Fig. 1illustrates representative ATP-evoked currents prior to and during an 8-min application of MTSM at 1 mm and after washing for 4 min. The effects of MTSM are summarized in Fig.2. There was no significant effect on ATP-evoked currents at wild-type receptors. We included T336C as a control mutation, and found that the inhibition (>80%) was similar to that previously reported for MTSEA, MTSET, and MTSES (10Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3446-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). At 8 of the 39 cysteine-substituted receptors that responded to ATP, MTSM caused a large (≥ 60%) inhibition of the current that was significantly different from the wild-type (p < 0.001); these were D15C, P19C, V23C, V24C, G30C, Q37C, F44C, and V48C (Fig.3). This inhibition did not reverse on washing out the MTSM for up to 10 min (Fig. 1). These effects of MTSM were mimicked closely by another neutral MTS derivative, MTSB. At 1 mm (for 8 min), the inhibitions by MTSB were as follows: V15C, 90 ± 3% (n = 3); P19C, 89 ± 7.8% (n = 4); V23C, 82 ± 4.1% (n = 3); and V24C, 97 ± 1.1% (n = 4). The inhibition of the current by MTSM was not obviously dependent on membrane potential as judged from ramp current-voltage plots.Figure 3Effects of charged MTS compounds at cysteine-substituted P2X2 receptors. At each position, the effects of MTSES (1 mm) and MTSET (1 mm) were examined following a similar protocol to that used for MTSM. The four columns indicate the inhibition observed at 2, 4, 6, and 8 min (n = 3–10 cells for each case).n.d. indicates not determined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous studies on the second transmembrane domain found no effects by MTSEA, MTSET, and MTSES on the positions on the C-terminal side of D349C (W350C, I351C, L352C, L353C, and T354C). These positions are clearly at the inner aspect of the second transmembrane domain, and we re-examined them using MTSM. We found that MTSM (1 mm, 8 min) gave rise to significant inhibition (p < 0.001) at I351C (76.5 ± 6.2%; n = 3) and L352 (69.8 ± 5.1%; n = 3). Val24 and Gly30 are believed to be on the intracellular aspect of the receptor. The speed of the reaction of MTSM at V24C (time constant < 2 min; see Fig. 3) and G30C (≪ 2 min; see Fig. 3) indicates that MTSM crosses the cell membrane rapidly. This implies that the slower rates of reaction observed for some other positions such as P19C indicate a slower forward reaction rate rather than slower access to the intracellular soluble compartment. MTSET is not expected to cross the membrane, although it can permeate the open P2X receptor channel (10Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3446-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). It is therefore a useful probe of residues accessible to the extracellular aspect or intracellular residues if ATP has been applied to open the channel while MTSET is in the extracellular solution (see Ref. 10Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3446-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). MTSES, being negatively charged, is not expected to enter the cell whether the channel is open or not. Fig. 3 compares the effects of MTSM with MTSES and MTSET on ATP-evoked currents in cells expressing these eight mutated receptors. Val48 is believed to be on the extracellular aspect of the receptor (see the Introduction). Both MTSET and MTSES caused large inhibition of the current at V48C but had much lesser effect at any other position; MTSEA (1 mm; 8 min) also caused inhibition by 88.8 ± 7.4% (n = 4). The inhibition at V48C by all four MTS reagents was relatively slow (time constant about 3 min at 1 mm MTSET; see Fig. 4). After treatment with MTSET or MTSEA, the ATP-evoked currents did not return completely to initial holding current. The residual holding current was 483 ± 80 pA (n = 3) for MTSEA (1 mm) and 411 ± 127 pA (n = 3) for MTSET (1 mm) when measured 15 s after the first application of ATP (30 μm; 2 s) in the presence of methanethiosulfonate. This was in marked contrast to the effect of MTSM or MTSES, where the currents declined quickly and completely to the baseline level. It suggests that channel closure is impaired when a positively charged methanethiosulfonate attaches at Val48. Taken together, the results with MTSM, MTSES, and MTSET are consistent with the topology currently proposed for the P2X2 receptor. Introduction of cysteine at positions Asp15, Pro19, Val23, Val24, and Gly30 (before the first hydrophobic segment) and Ile351 and Leu352 (end of the second hydrophobic segment) led to significant inhibition by the membrane permeant MTSM but little or no inhibition by charged MTS derivatives. Conversely, cysteine substitution at Val48 (at the outer edge of the first hydrophobic segment) resulted in strong inhibition by MTSM, MTSES, and MTSET as we have previously described for three residues (Ile328, Asn333, and Thr336) at the beginning of the second hydrophobic domain (10Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3446-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The shape of the concentration-response curve for ATP might provide information on the mechanism by which the current is inhibited (9Jiang L.-H. Rassendren F. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34190-34196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 15Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 924-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Before treatment with MTSM, the EC50 values for D15C, P19C, V23C, V24C, and V48C were 3.1 ± 0.4 (n = 3), 6.9 ± 0.2 (n = 3), 7.3 ± 0.8 (n = 4), 10.6 ± 1.0 (n = 6), and 3.4 ± 0.2 μm(n = 3), respectively (Fig. 4). After treatment they were not different (4.8 ± 0.4, n = 3; 9.3 ± 1.1, n = 3; 10 ± 1.3, n = 4; 9.4 ± 1.4, n = 6; and 4.0 ± 0.4 μm, n = 3, respectively). These values are close to those for the wild-type receptor (7.9 ± 1.1 μm; n = 8). In other words, MTSM modification at these positions results in a simple depression of the maximum current evoked by ATP, with little change in the EC50. This is similar to the result observed with T336C (see Fig. 4 and Refs. 9Jiang L.-H. Rassendren F. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34190-34196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar and 10Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3446-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). V24C was rapidly and completely inhibited by MTSM (Figs. 1, 3, and 5). This inhibition was essentially the same even when ATP applications were discontinued during the presence of the MTSM (Fig.5 A, left). On the other hand, Fig. 5 B (left) shows that the positively charged MTSET produced little or no inhibition of the currents at V24C unless ATP was repeatedly applied. We interpret this to indicate that Val24 is situated on the intracellular aspect of the receptor, but it can be accessed by MTSET entering through the open channel. This is the same result, and the same conclusion, as we made previously for inhibition at D349C by MTSEA (10Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3446-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In the case of V48C, inhibition was observed with MTSM, MTSET, and MTSES (Fig. 3). However, the effectiveness of MTSM and MTSET was considerably greater when the ATP was repeatedly applied than when it was not applied during the presence of the MTS derivative (Fig. 5,A and B, right). This result implies that conformational changes associated with ATP binding and channel opening moves V48C into a position in which it is much more readily accessible to reaction with MTS derivatives. In other words, Val48 moves as a result of channel opening, and by moving it becomes more accessible to MTS derivatives. We have previously presented evidence that T336C is located in the outer vestibule of the ionic channel; the evidence for this was that outward currents were inhibited more rapidly than inward currents as the MTSET reacted with the cysteine. The present work indicates that Val48 is situated at the outer edge of the membrane, and we therefore asked whether these residues were sufficiently close to form disulfides that altered the properties of the channel. We expressed the double mutants V48C/I328C, V48C/N333C, and V48C/T336. The current elicited by ATP (30 μm) at the V48C/I328C receptor was much smaller (243 ± 70 pA; n = 11) than wild-type, V48C, or I328C receptors (Fig. 6). We also observed relatively large inward currents when the cells were held at −60 mV; it normally required less than −50 pA to hold a human embryonic kidney 293 cell at −60 mV, but for V48C/I328C this was −235 ± 52 pA (n = 8). This suggested that the P2X2receptor channel was constitutively open in this mutated receptor. Dithiothreitol (10 mm) greatly increased the amplitude of the current evoked by ATP (about 6-fold) over 20 min and progressively reduced the sustained holding current in the absence of ATP (Fig. 6,A and C). The ATP-evoked current increased exponentially with time constant (τ) of 5.9 ± 0.8 min (n = 8) with 10 mm dithiothreitol, whereas the sustained inward holding current declined rather more slowly (τ = 19.3 ± 7.4 min; n = 6) and had reached −76 ± 41 pA at 20 min. A further reducing agent, bismercaptoethanol (5 mm), also potentiated the ATP-evoked currents (Fig. 6, B and C). Its action was somewhat more rapid than that of dithiothreitol (τ = 1.2 ± 0.5 min; n = 4). Bismercaptoethanol also reduced the inward holding current from −299 ± 115 to −48 ± 17 pA (n = 4) during a 20-min application (τ = 4.3 ± 1.6 min; n = 3). ATP-evoked currents for V48C/N333C and V48C/T336C were similar to those observed for single cysteine mutants V48C, N333C, or T336C (range 1–8 nA), and application of dithiothreitol at 10 mm for 20 min had no effect on the currents (see Fig. 6 C). The rat P2X2receptor was tolerant of cysteine introduced in all but 5 of the 46 positions examined between Asp15 and Thr60(Figs. 2 and 7). Y16C, Y43C, Y55C, and Q56C were non-functional; these residues are completely conserved among all mammalian P2X receptors. R34C also did not express channels; arginine is found in all subunits except P2X7, where it is replaced by tryptophan. In four positions the introduction of cysteine led to an obviously altered phenotype. In the case of T18C and L29C, the response to ATP declined markedly when ATP was applied more than once. Thr18 in the P2X2 receptor has been shown by Boué-Grabot et al. (16Boué-Grabot E. Archambault V. Séguéla P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10190-10195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) to be phosphorylated by protein kinase C, and this alters the desensitization kinetics. Leu29 has not previously been mutated, but we note that it lies very close to the inner edge of the first hydrophobic domain. Q37C expressed more poorly (smaller maximum currents) than the other mutations and was less sensitive to ATP than wild-type receptors. The effect of mutating Phe44 to cysteine was surprising in that it resulted in a 10-fold increase in sensitivity to ATP and an even larger increase in sensitivity to αβmeATP. Insensitivity to αβmeATP has come to be regarded as a major distinguishing feature among the different subtypes of P2X receptor, with those containing P2X1 and P2X3 subunits sensitive (P2X1 and P2X3 homomers and P2X2/3and P2X1/5 heteromers) and those not containing these subunits several hundred-fold less sensitive (17North R.A. Surprenant A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 563-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). There have not been previous reports of point mutations conferring sensitivity to αβmeATP in P2X receptors of the insensitive subclasses (P2X2, P2X4, P2X5, and P2X7). Phenylalanine is found in this position in the P2X2 and P2X3 subunits, but in the others the residue is leucine, valine, or isoleucine. One interpretation of the increased effectiveness is that this position contributes to the ATP binding site. This seems somewhat unlikely in view of the fact that it is situated well within the first hydrophobic domain. A more likely explanation might be that αβmeATP normally can bind to the P2X receptor in much the same way as ATP but that it has very low efficacy to induce the conformational change leading to channel opening. From the results for the wild-type channel, the EC50 for αβmeATP can be very crudely estimated as around 1 mm, but this is difficult to verify experimentally because of doubts that the αβmeATP might contain small amounts of ATP. In F44C, the EC50 value for ATP shifted about 10-fold (from 8 to 0.7 μm); the EC50 value for αβmeATP must then have shifted about 100-fold (from about 1000 to 10 μm). A direct effect of this mutation on channel gating was also indicated by the observation that the currents evoked by ATP took longer to decline to the baseline in F44C than in wild-type channels; this is consistent with slowed channel closing. Further analysis of this position with other substitutions, and single channel recordings, is likely to provide insight into the mechanisms of gating. One corollary of this interpretation is that αβmeATP should act as a competitive antagonist of ATP at wild-type P2X2 receptors. Although this has not been reported, there is evidence that αβmeATP is an antagonist of ATP action at P2X receptors in sympathetic neurons (18Khakh B.S. Humphrey P.P. Surprenant A. J. Physiol. 1995; 484: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). We used principally the methyl, ethyltrimethylammonium, and ethylsulfonate derivatives of methanethiosulfonates. After modification of a cysteine these would result in a neutral [-CH2-S-S-CH3], positive [-CH2-S-S-CH2-CH2-N+(CH3)3], or negative [-CH2-S-S-CH2-CH2-SO3−] side chain on the receptor protein. MTSM had no significant effect on the wild-type P2X2 receptors but gave strong inhibition of ATP-evoked currents in eight of the cysteine-substituted receptors (Figs. 2 and 7). Where MTSM has no effect, we cannot say whether the cysteine is not accessible to an aqueous solution or whether the cysteine is modified, but this modification does not change the channel properties in any way that we have studied. The rapid rate at which MTSM reacted with some cysteines at intracellular locations (e.g. G30C and V24C) indicates that there is little obstacle to its passage across the plasma membrane. Other methanethiosulfonates did not have significant effects on cysteines at intracellular positions in the N-terminal region of the receptor, except for V24C. In this case, the action of MTSET was dependent on ATP application, suggesting that it entered the cell through the open channel. We have shown previously that MTSET is about 16% as permeable as sodium through P2X2 receptors (10Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3446-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar); we have not used MTSEA, because we (10Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3446-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and others (19Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) have found that it can enter the cell quite readily, presumably in its uncharged state. Cysteine substitutions at positions at the inner end of the second transmembrane domain (Trp350 to Thr355) have previously been shown to be unreactive to MTSET; the present work showed that two of them were accessible to MTSM, and this is consistent with an intracellular location. In general, the results with MTSM and MTSET are as would be expected on the basis of the topological models currently proposed for the receptor (Fig. 7). For all the modified cysteines, the reduction in the ATP-evoked current occurred without change in the EC50 value. In other words, increasing the ATP concentration could not overcome the inhibition of the current resulting from methanethiosulfonate application. One can distinguish broadly between a reduced affinity of the closed channel for ATP (i.e. binding), an impaired ability of the channel to open and stay open when ATP is bound (gating), and a reduced current through the open channel (permeation) (14Evans R.J. Lewis C. Virginio C. Lundstrom K. Buell G. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Physiol. 1996; 497: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Impairment of binding or gating would usually produce a rightward parallel shift in the concentration-response curve before the maximum is reduced, whereas reduction in open channel current would not. It is conceivable that mutations P19C, V23C, V24C, F44C, and V48C (Fig. 4) all directly affect permeation, but independent direct measurements would be required to show this. In no cases was there, for example, any obvious effect on the rectification of the whole-cell current after cysteine modification. The inhibition of current observed in V48C closely resembled that which we have previously found for I328C, N333C, and T336C (10Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3446-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), all of which are located close to the outer end of the second transmembrane domain. The finding that all three methanethiosulfonates (positive, neutral, and negative) cause strong inhibition indicates that this position is situated outside the membrane electric field. We were surprised therefore to observe that the reaction at V48C occurred much more rapidly when ATP was repeatedly applied than when it was not applied (Fig. 5). This result implies that the cysteine in the position of Val48 moves to become more accessible when the channel is opened. A second unique feature of V48C was the finding that MTSET treatment caused an inward current to persist following the ATP application. This was not observed for the uncharged reagent MTSM, even though that caused similar inhibition of the current. We interpret this to indicate that channel closing is inhibited by the attachment of a positively charged moiety in this position; a similar observation was made previously for T336C (10Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3446-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In that earlier work, there were three positions at the outer edge of the second transmembrane domain that were reactive with MTSET (Ile328, Asn333, and Thr336). Because Val48 is situated at the outer edge of the first membrane-spanning domain, we hypothesized that they were sufficiently close to form a disulfide bond. This was tested directly by expressing the doubly mutated receptors V48C/I328C, V48C/N333C, and V48C/T336C. The latter two combinations resulted in currents that were not different from wild-type receptors, but the currents in cells expressing the V48C/I328C combination were very much reduced in amplitude (Fig. 6). At the same time, these cells exhibited large steady inward currents at −60 mV. Application of either dithiothreitol or bismercaptoethanol greatly increased the ATP-induced current and concomitantly decreased the persistent inward current. Taken together, these observations suggest that a disulfide formed between V48C and I328C results in a channel that is constitutively open and cannot be opened by applying ATP. The small currents that we observed prior to adding the reducing agent might indicate that the disulfide bond had not formed in all the channels or that the channels could operate, though poorly, with the disulfide bond in place. The impairment of channel opening by the V48C/I328C disulfide is quite consistent with the conclusion reached above that Val48moves during channel opening. Moreover, the finding that the V48C channel does not open when this position is “tethered” to I328C suggests that the movement of Val48 is not “fortuitous” at some incidental part of the protein, but is a necessary component of the gating mechanism. It is not possible to conclude from the present work whether the disulfide is formed between V48C and I328C on the same receptor subunit or on different receptor subunits that contribute to the multimeric channel. However, the results do put constraints on models for the channel. In Fig. 7 the two membrane-spanning domains are depicted as α-helices. There is no evidence for this, except to say that it is strongly favored by secondary structure prediction algorithms (20Brake A.J. Wagenbach M.J. Julius D. Nature. 1994; 371: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 21North R.A. Ciba Found. Symp. 1996; 198: 91-104PubMed Google Scholar). The accessible residues in the first transmembrane domain are located at one side of the helix. The proximity of Val48 and Ile328 indicated by the present results is fully consistent with this structure. For both transmembrane segments virtually all of the accessible residues mapped by cysteine scanning can be aligned along one face of an α-helix (Fig. 7). Key residues involved in gating the mechanosensitive channel of Escherichia coli (which also has two membrane-spanning domains per subunit) have a similar relative orientation (22Ou X. Blount P. Hoffman R.J. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11471-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The proposed model suggests several opportunities for future experiments to increase our understanding of the modus operandi of P2X receptors.

The PKA holoenzyme consists of four subunits, two catalytic and two regulatory. The regulatory subunits form dimers through an interaction at the N terminus whereas the C terminus contains two tandem repeat sequences, which form the cAMP binding sites. Binding of cAMP to the regulatory subunits promotes the dissociation and activation of the catalytic subunits. A second function of the regulatory subunits is to target or anchor PKA to specific subcellular locations within the cell. A major advance in signal transduction research in recent years is the understanding that the actions of many signaling molecules are spatially restricted and coordinated through cell- and function-specific targeting of these enzymes and their substrates (1Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). PKA is anchored to specific cellular compartments through the interaction of the regulatory subunit with a family of proteins referred to as A-kinase anchoringproteins (AKAPs) (reviewed in Refs. 2Dell'Acqua M.L.

Several AKAPs have been shown to simultaneously bind to PKA and other signal transduction molecules such as calmodulin, protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), calcineurin (PP2B), and protein kinase C (5Coghlan V.M.

This has led to a model in which AKAPs act as scaffolding molecules that coordinate the actions of several kinases and phosphatases all located within one cellular compartment. The structural feature of AKAPs that promotes interaction with PKA has been known for some time (10Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D. Bishop S.M. Acott T.S. Brennan R.G. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14188-14192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AKAPs contain an amphipathic helix region and bind to the type II regulatory subunit of PKA via the hydrophobic face. The identification of this binding domain has facilitated the design of reagents that have been used to determine experimentally the physiological consequences of the interaction of PKA with AKAPs. Synthetic peptides encompassing the amphipathic helix binding domain are potent competitive inhibitors of PKA·AKAP interaction (11Carr D.W. Hausken Z.E. Fraser I.D. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13376-13382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore are referred to as anchoring inhibitor peptides (AIPs). Addition of AIPs to a variety of somatic cells inhibits PKA modulation of cellular events. For example, microinjection of AIPs into hippocampal neurons causes a time-dependent decrease in AMPA/kainate-responsive currents whereas control peptides had no effect on channel activity, suggesting that PKA anchoring is required for PKA modulation of the AMPA/kainate channels (12Rosenmund C. Carr D.W. Bergeson S.E. Nilaver G. Scott J.D. Westbrook G.L. Nature. 1994; 368: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Since this initial finding, several laboratories have used AIPs to demonstrate that anchoring is required for PKA modulation of l-type Ca2+ channels (13Johnson B.D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11492-11496Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), calcium-activated potassium channels (14Wang Z.W. Kotlikoff M.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: L100-L105PubMed Google Scholar), insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells (15Lester L.B. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14942-14947Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and phosphatidylinositide turnover in myometrial cells (16Dodge K.L. Carr D.W. Yue C. Sanborn B.M. Mol.

In all of the above examples, the action of AIPs is mimicked by the addition of reagents that inhibit the catalytic activity of PKA. These data support a model where AKAPs interact with the PKA regulatory subunit to anchor or target the catalytic subunit to relevant physiological substrates. Several sperm AKAPs have been identified and characterized (18Carrera A. Gerton G.L. Moss S.B. Dev. Biol. 1994; 165: 272-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 19Erlichman J.

Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 705-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The most prominent AKAP detected by RII overlay assay of bovine, human, mouse, and monkey spermatozoa is AKAP110 (20Horowitz J.A. Wasco W. Leiser M. Orr G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2098-2104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lin R.Y. Moss S.B. Rubin C.S. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 705-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Northern analysis suggests that AKAP110 is expressed only in spermatozoa, and immunofluorescence studies detecting AKAP110 in the flagella suggest that this protein may be involved in regulating motility. Addition of S-Ht31 (stearated-Ht31 is a cell permeable AIP) to bovine caudal epididymal spermatozoa inhibits motility in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (26Vijayaraghavan S. Goueli S.A. Davey M.P. Carr D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4747-4752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). A control peptide, S-Ht31-P, identical to S-Ht31 except for an isoleucine to proline substitution that prevents amphipathic helix formation, had no effect on motility. Surprisingly, inhibition of PKA catalytic activity by addition of H-89 or S-PKI had little effect on basal motility or motility stimulated by agents previously thought to work via PKA activation (26Vijayaraghavan S. Goueli S.A. Davey M.P. Carr D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4747-4752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). These data suggest that proteins interacting with sperm AKAPs regulate motility in a manner that is independent of PKA catalytic activity. These results have been confirmed by a different approach. McKnight and colleagues (28Burton K.A. Treash-Osio B. Muller C.H. Dunphy E.L. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24131-24136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), using mutant mice lacking RIIα, have shown that the catalytic subunit is no longer located along the flagellum but instead is concentrated in the cytoplasmic droplet, yet the spermatozoa are motile and the mice are fertile. These data suggest that neither RIIα nor RIIα-dependent localization of PKA catalytic subunit is necessary to support motility. Thus, it appears that AIPs may be exerting an effect on spermatozoa that is independent of AKAP·RIIα interaction. One hypothesis consistent with the above data is that sperm AKAPs are interacting with proteins other than RII via the amphipathic helix domain. This would explain how AIPs could be regulating motility in a manner independent of both the regulatory and catalytic subunits of PKA. Using the yeast two-hybrid system to screen a human testis library, we have now identified several sperm-specific proteins that bind to fragments of AKAP110 containing the amphipathic helix domain. Binding studies demonstrate that these proteins bind to AKAP110 in a manner homologous with RII. Based on these data, we propose a model for the function of AKAPs in spermatozoa that is very different than the model for AKAPs in somatic cells. The yeast strain EGY48(p2op-lacZ) containing constructs of pLexA human AKAP110, truncated hAKAP110-(1–350), and human ropporin was transformed with a pB42AD-fused human testis cDNA library following protocols for the Matchmaker LexA Two-Hybrid System (CLONTECH). Approximately 2 × 108 transformants were screened with each construct on 150-mm plates containing 5 × 104 clones with SD/Gal/Raf/-His/-Trp/-Ura/-Leu/+Xgal + BU salts. Blue colonies, positive for β-galactosidase activity, were re-streaked on SD/-His/-Trp/-Ura plates, then replated on SD/Gal/Raf/-His/-Trp/-Ura/-Leu/+X-gal + BU salts to re-test for activation of both the lacZ and LEU2 reporter genes. Double positives were then plated on master plates containing SD/-His/-Trp/-Ura and used for yeast PCR and sequence analysis. Ropporin and mutant ropporin (L18A) were expressed as pET30a N-terminal His6-tagged fusion proteins in Escherichia coli(BL21(DE3)) and were purified by fast protein liquid chromatography using Hi-Trap chelating Sepharose columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). One liter of LB broth + 30 μg/ml kanamycin was inoculated and grown to mid-logarithm phase before adding 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to induce protein expression at 37 °C for 2 h. The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 20 min, sonicated in buffer A on ice (20 mm HEPES, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride, pH 7.4), and clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the resultant supernatant was passed through a 0.45-μm filter. The supernatant was then applied to the Ni2+-charged Hi-Trap chelating column. Bound proteins were eluted with a stepwise gradient of imidazole (0–0.5 m) in buffer A. Fractions containing purified protein were identified by Coomassie Blue staining of 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels. pET11d-RIIα and mutant RIIα (L14A) were expressed in E. coli (BL21(DE3)) and purified by cAMP-agarose affinity column as previously described (10Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D. Bishop S.M. Acott T.S. Brennan R.G. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14188-14192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids for expression of recombinant hAKAP110, hAKAP110-(1–350), mRIIα, h-ropporin, hASP, hSP17, and hFSII in a yeast two-hybrid system, as histidine-tagged or GST fusion proteins inE. coli were prepared as follows. The pET30a hAKAP110 full-length construct and its truncated form hAKAP110-(1–350) (27Vijayaraghavan S. Liberty G.A. Mohan J. Winfrey V.P. Olson G.E. Carr D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 705-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) were digested with EcoRI and XhoI, gel-purified, and ligated into pLexA, pB42AD (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), and pGEX5x-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) vectors cut with the same restriction enzymes. PCR was performed on pET11d RIIα with forward primer 5′-CCGGAATTCATGAGCCACATCCAGATCCCG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCGCTCGAGCACACTGAGAAGGCTCCAAGATTC-3′, respectively, containing anEcoRI and XhoI restriction site. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI/XhoI, gel-purified, and ligated into pLexA and pB42AD. Full-length PCR products of ropporin, SP17, and FSII were obtained by 5′-RACE of a Marathon Ready Human Testis cDNA library (CLONTECH). Ropporin forward primer 5′-GGATTCATGGCTCAGACAGATAAGCCAACATG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCCTCGAGAATTGTGCTGTTACTCCAGCCAAACC-3′, SP17 forward primer 5′-AGATCCATGTCGATCCATTCTCCAACACCCA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ATTTGCGGCCGCTGGAGGTAAAACCAGTGTCCTCACTTG-3′, FSII forward primer 5′-AGATCCATGTCGATCCATTCTCCAACACCCAC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ATTTGCGGCCGCTGGAGGTAAAACCAGTCTCCTCACTTG-3′. Ropporin hadEcoRI/XhoI restriction sites added to the primers, SP17 and FSII primers had BamHI/NotI restriction sites added. Ropporin was digested and ligated into pET30a, pLexA, and pB42AD; SP17 and FSII were subcloned into pLexA. ASP was obtained using the yeast two-hybrid system and Human Testis Matchmaker LexA cDNA (CLONTECH),EcoRI/XhoI-digested, and ligated into pLexA and pET30a. A Mouse Multiple Tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH), containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA per lane, was screened using the full-length ASP fragment generated in the plasmids section. The probe was32P-labeled using the High Prime DNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Hybridization of the probe was carried out at 42 °C for 18 h in Ullrich's buffer/2% SDS. The blot was washed at room temperature 2× in SSC, 2× in SSC/2% SDS at 65 °C and finally in 0.1% SSC at room temperature. An exposure of the blot was then made on x-ray film for 72 h. E. coli transformed with pGEX-5X-1 plasmid encoding human AKAP110-(1–350) or AKAP110-P (containing a proline substitution for leucine 131) were grown to mid-logarithm phase at 37 °C in 1 liter of LB medium. They were cultured for an additional 2 h at 37 °C in the presence of 0.2 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to induce synthesis of the fusion protein. Crude extracts were prepared by sonicating the bacteria in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mmNaCl, and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride. 2% Tween 20 (v/v) was added to the extract and rotated at room temperature for 1 h. The extract was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min before passing the supernatant through a 0.45-μm filter. The supernatant was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 3 ml of glutathione-Sepharose before extensive washing in phosphate-buffered saline to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. Prior to the addition of purified proteins, 200 μl of the GST-hAKAP110-(1–350) was incubated with 750 μl of Blotto and 10 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at room temperature. 1 μg of RIIα, RIIα (L14A), 3 μg of ropporin and 4 μg of ropporin (L18A) were added to separate tubes containing the Blotto/AKAP110 mix and rotated at room temperature for 2 h. After washing extensively with phosphate-buffered saline and 10 mm dithiothreitol, proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS gel-loading buffer and separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Regulatory subunit RIIα was detected by Western blotting using rabbit antisera against RIIα (6825) and secondary anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO). Ropporin was detected by conjugated horseradish peroxidase-Anti-S-Protein (Novagen, Madison, WI). PCR was done directly on diethyl pyrocarbonate-H2O suspensions of yeast cell positives using vector-specific primers flanking the multiple cloning site of the pB42AD vector (29Ling M. Merante F. Robinson B.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4924-4925Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 30Sathe G.M. O'Brien S. McLaughlin M.M. Watson F. Livi G.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4775Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The resulting PCR products were gel-purified, and sequence analysis was performed using the Big-Dye Terminator Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and the same vector specific primers. The Y-Der yeast DNA extraction kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL) was used to recover plasmid DNA from positives that wouldn't amplify using the above method. Analysis of sequence data, sequence comparison, and alignments was performed using the MacVector ClustalW program (Oxford Molecular Group) and the BLAST program (31Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) provided by the NCBI server at the National Library of Medicine/National Institutes of Health. The 5′-RACE was performed using a Marathon cDNA amplification kit and Human Testis Marathon-Ready cDNA (CLONTECH) as described with the accompanying procedures. The primers used to obtain full-length PCR products were previously stated in the plasmids section. Plasmid constructs pET30a mouse ropporin, pET11d mouse RIIα, and pGEX5x-1 containing hAKAP110-(1–350) were used as PCR templates for the QuikChange 1-day site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Aligned leucines (see Fig. 4 A below) at positions 18 and 14 of ropporin and RIIα, respectively, were mutated to alanines using the following primers: Ropporin (L18A), forward primer 5′-TGCCGGAATTGGCAAAGCAGTTTAC-3′, reverse primer 5′-GTAAACTGCTTTGCCAATTCCGGCA-3′; RIIα (L14A), forward primer 5′-TCACGGAGCTGGCACAGGGCTACA-3′, reverse primer 5′-TGTAGCCCTGTGCCAGCTCCGTGA-3′. Leucine 131 within the amphipathic helix region of hAKAP110 was mutated to proline using the following primers: forward primer 5′-ATGCTAACCGCCCAACGAATCTAG-3′, reverse primer 5′-CTAGATTCGTTGGGCGGTTAGCAT-3′. The resulting mutated DNA was transformed into E. coli Super Competent JM109 cells (Promega, Madison, WI) and grown on antibiotic-resistant LB Agar plates. The mutations were verified by sequence analysis using vector-specific primers. Adult male mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation, and a sperm suspension was obtained by mincing the cauda epididymides in buffered saline (145 mmNaCl and 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). Sperm were then fixed 30 min in 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4), attached to coverslips, permeabilized in absolute acetone for 10 min at −20 °C and air-dried. For immunostaining, cells were first incubated 1 h in blocking buffer of Tris-saline (TN = 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 2.5% bovine serum albumin and 5% goat serum and then successively incubated in primary and secondary antibodies also diluted in blocking solution. Between all incubation steps, coverslips were washed three times in TN containing 1% goat serum. Primary antibodies, prepared in rabbits, included affinity-purified IgG to AKAP110 and ropporin. Control samples substituted identical levels of affinity-purified non-immune rabbit IgG for immune IgG. Cy3-conjugated affinity-purified secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). AKAP110 is a sperm-specific AKAP that binds to the type II regulatory subunit of PKA via an amphipathic helix-binding motif located at amino acid position 124–143 (27Vijayaraghavan S. Liberty G.A. Mohan J. Winfrey V.P. Olson G.E. Carr D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 705-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). To determine if other proteins also bind to AKAP110 via the amphipathic helix binding domain, a human testis cDNA library was screened using an N-terminal fragment of AKAP110-(1–350) as bait in a yeast two-hybrid procedure. Positives were then co-transformed in the two-hybrid system with another fragment of AKAP110-(349–660) that does not contain an amphipathic helix domain. Three positives were identified that bound to the amphipathic helix-containing fragment (1) but not to the other fragment (349) (Fig. 1). The pB42AD plasmids were recovered from these clones, and the cDNA inserts (1.4, 1.3, and 1.1 kb in size) were sequenced. Sequence analysis demonstrated that the 1.4-kb insert encodes for the human type II regulatory subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, RIIα (GenBank™ accession number NM004147). The first base of the insert lines up with base 142 of the deposited sequence, which lists the coding region as 190–1404. Thus, the 1.4-kb insert contains the full-length coding region for PKA RIIα protein plus an additional 16 amino acids from the 5′-untranslated region. Although this additional region would normally not be translated, there are no stop codons within this segment, and thus these additional amino acids functioned as a bridge between the pB42AD fusion partner and RIIα. The sequence obtained from the 1.3-kb insert is 94% identical to the amino acid sequence of the murine protein ropporin (GenBank™ accession number AF178531), which we previously isolated as a binding partner of a Rho effector, rhophilin (32Fujita A. Nakamura K. Kato T. Watanabe N. Ishizaki T. Kimura K. Mizoguchi A. Narumiya S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 103-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The human ropporin (h-ropporin) sequence has been submitted to the GenBank™ data base (accession number AF231410). Ropporin is a sperm-specific protein localized in the principal piece and the end piece of sperm flagella (32Fujita A. Nakamura K. Kato T. Watanabe N. Ishizaki T. Kimura K. Mizoguchi A. Narumiya S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 103-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ropporin forms homodimers and binds to rhophilin, and both proteins have been shown to co-precipitate in vitro with Rho (32Fujita A. Nakamura K. Kato T. Watanabe N. Ishizaki T. Kimura K. Mizoguchi A. Narumiya S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 103-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once again, in addition to sequence that was homologous to the coding region for m-ropporin, the pB42AD insert contained sequence upstream (165 bases) of the ropporin start site, adding 55 amino acids of 5′-untranslated repeat as a bridge between the pB42AD fusion protein and the h-ropporin. The sequence obtained from the 1.1-kb insert is a novel protein. It is 39% identical to h-ropporin but does not match any other protein in the GenBank™ data base and will hereafter be referred to asAKAP-associated sperm protein or ASP. ASP also contains a 5′-untranslated repeat bridge (57 bases, 19 amino acids) between the vector and the start site. This sequence has been submitted to the GenBank™ data base (accession number AF239723). The optimal alignment (MacVector ClustalW Alignment Program) of m-ropporin, h-ropporin, and ASP is shown in Fig.2. ASP is highly homologous with the N-terminal 80 residues of ropporin and only moderately homologous with the rest of the molecule, suggesting the N terminus contains a conserved domain that may have an important function in spermatozoa. We have previously shown that m-ropporin is detected only in the testis and then only in the most inner part of the seminiferous tubules region, suggesting this protein is expressed in developing spermatozoa (32Fujita A. Nakamura K. Kato T. Watanabe N. Ishizaki T. Kimura K. Mizoguchi A. Narumiya S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 103-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the tissue distribution of ASP, Northern blots containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from eight different adult mouse tissues were probed with 32P-labeled ASP cDNA. A single message was detected only in the testis (Fig. 3), suggesting this protein is testis-specific and possibly sperm-specific. Using a linear regression analysis of a plot of the log10 versus the RF of the molecular weight markers, the ASP mRNA was calculated to be ∼1.05 kb. This was bigger than expected based on the insert size (850 bases) from the yeast vector. To determine if the insert represented full-length cDNA for ASP, 5′-RACE was performed using Human Testis Marathon-Ready cDNA (CLONTECH) as template. An additional 144 bases were identified using this technique, bringing the total number of bases to 994 or approximately the same size as the calculated mRNA. Although this new region contains an open reading frame continuous with the rest of the protein, it does not contain an alternate start site. At the time of submission of this manuscript, a BLAST search of the human genome data base does not detect either human ropporin or ASP. As mentioned above, the N-terminal regions of ropporin and ASP are the most conserved. The sequence in this region is also similar to the N terminus of the type II regulatory subunit of PKA and two other sperm-specific proteins, SP-17 (GenBankTM accession number Q15506) (33Kong M. Richardson R.T. Widgren E.E. O'Rand M.G. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 53: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar,34Lea I.A. Richardson R.T. Widgren E.E. O'Rand M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1307: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and fibrousheathin II (FSII) (GenBankTM accession number NM_012189). 2A. Mandal, M. J. Wolkowicz, S. Naaby-Hansen, and J. C. Herr, unpublished data. Optimal alignment (MacVector ClustalW alignment program) of RIIα and RIIβ (residues 1–46 or 45, respectively, of both human and mouse) with the corresponding regions of ropporin, ASP, SP17, and FSII is shown in Fig.4 A. The dark gray shading indicates sequence identity, and the light gray shading indicates sequence similarity. Although these sperm proteins share high sequence similarity with the N-terminal region of RII, they have little or no homology with other regions of RII such as the nucleotide binding domains. The only other protein identifiable by sequence homology, sharing the characteristics of having an AKAP binding domain but not a cyclic-nucleotide binding domain, is a hypothetical protein from Caenorhabditis elegans F39H12.3. The location of this protein in C. elegans is still undetermined. The N-terminal 44 amino acids of RII contain the domains responsible for homodimerization and binding to AKAPs (Fig. 4 B). The sequence identity of h-RIIβ, h-ropporin, hASP, hSP17, hFSII, and hRIα with hRIIα (1–44) is 70, 30, 32, 45, 34, and 18%, respectively. It is interesting to note that a"

Conditional mutants in both genes show rapid changes in the transcription of over 5% of yeast genes, with a similar number of genes being repressed and activated. Both Rvb1p and Rvb2p are required for maintaining the induced state of many inducible promoters. ATP binding and hydrolysis by Rvb1p and Rvb2p is individually essentialin vivo, and the two proteins are associated with each other in a high molecular weight complex that shows ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activity in vitro. Our findings show that Rvb1p and Rvb2p are essential components of a chromatin remodeling complex and determine genes regulated by the complex.

Recent discoveries have emphasized the complexity of the apparatus that governs transcription in eukaryotic cells (reviewed in Refs. 1Perez-Martin J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 23: 503-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar and 2Muchardt C. Yaniv M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic RNA polymerase II holoenzyme, responsible for the transcription of protein-encoding genes, is a megadalton complex containing over 50 components. This large complex must access the template genes on chromosomes packed into chromatin, which restricts access to the DNA. Packaging of genes into chromatin represses basal transcription allowing several multisubunit complexes to regulate gene expression by modulating the topology of the constituent nucleosomes in a number of ways. Histone tails can be modified by either phosphorylation or acetylation (3Luger K. Richmond T.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1998; 8: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), and these modifications are correlated with increased transcriptional activity. Another mechanism involves ATP-driven molecular machines that destabilize or remodel nucleosomes directly. These chromatin remodeling factors are all large complexes and all include at least one helicase-like subunit with DNA-dependent ATPase activity (4Eisen J.A. Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). The prototype chromatin remodeling complex is the yeast Swi/Snf complex (5Cairns B.R. Kim Y.J. Sayre M.H.

Science. 1994; 265: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), but genetic and biochemical studies have revealed a number of other chromatin remodeling complexes. Inspection of the yeast genome reveals at least 17 ORFs1 with homology to the Swi/Snf helicase-like ATPase subunit (Snf2p) suggesting that chromatin remodeling complexes are numerous and may each be involved in specific cellular pathways (2Muchardt C.

Although Snf2p and its homologs, such as Sth1p, a component of the RSC chromatin remodeling complex (8Du J. Nasir I. Benton B.K. Kladde M.P. Laurent B.C. Genetics. 1998; 150: 987-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the recently described Ino80p (Ari1p) transcription factor (9Ebbert R. Birkmann A. Schuller H.J. Mol.

Nature. 2000; 406: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) all belong to the DEAD/H class of proteins and contain sequence motifs typical of helicases, none of them has been shown to possess intrinsic helicase activity when purified. The bacterial RuvB protein belongs to the class of hexameric helicases. Hexameric helicases are members of a larger family of proteins known as the AAA+ class Chaperone-like ATPases (11Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that all contain a number of sequence motifs, including Walker A (P-loop) and Walker B boxes that represent active sites for ATP (or dNTP) binding and hydrolysis, respectively. The functional unit of most of these enzymes is a circular hexamer. Recent work in structural biology has shed light on how proteins of this class can translate allosteric changes produced upon ATP hydrolysis into circular movement and vice versa (see Refs. 12Sawaya M.R.

We first identified the human RVB1 ortholog in a two-hybrid interaction screen with the 14-kDa subunit of the DNA replication and repair factor RPA, and we subsequently identified yeastRVB1 in data base searches (14Qiu X.B.

The protein was named RuvBL1 (RuvB-like) because of its similarity to bacterial RuvB.RVB2 (RuvBL2) was subsequently identified as a closely related family member present in the yeast genome, with conserved orthologs in human, fly, and worm. The high degree of sequence conservation in the Rvb1p and Rvb2p proteins immediately suggested that they have important functions in vivo, and subsequent genetic studies in yeast showed that both genes are essential for mitotic growth (14Qiu X.B.

At the outset of this study, little was known about the function of the Rvb proteins, but in light of the findings that they interacted with TATA-binding protein (15Kanemaki M. Kurokawa Y.

However, a different role was implied by the activities of the closest homolog with a known function, eubacterial RuvB, which is involved in the movement of Holliday junctions (branched four-way structures that form upon homologous recombination of DNA). The association with RP-A, a protein involved in DNA replication and repair, implied yet a third possible function for Rvb1p and Rvb2p (14Qiu X.B. Lin Y.L. Thome K.C. Pian P. Schlegel B.P.

Recent publications add to the list of activities attributed to Rvbp. Human Rvb1p and Rvb2p were reported to act independently as helicases of opposite polarity (15Kanemaki M. Kurokawa Y.

More recently a study (23Lim C.R. Kimata Y. Ohdate H. Kokubo T. Kikuchi N. Horigome T. Kohno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22409-22417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) of a temperature-sensitive mutant strain showed the involvement of Rvb2p in the transcriptional regulation of CLN2 and genes encoding four ribosomal subunits, and a separate study (10Shen X. Mizuguchi G. Hamiche A. Wu C. Nature. 2000; 406: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) showed that yeast Rvb1p and Rvb2p copurify with the Ino80p ATPase as a complex that has the ability to remodel chromatin in vitro. The mammalian Rvb orthologs have been implicated in cell transformation by c-Myc (20Wood M.A. McMahon S.B. Cole M.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), and the human Rvb proteins were also found to associate with the TIP60 histone acetylase complex and to play a role in repair of DNA damage (22Ikura T.

Finally, a recent study found that the respective Drosophila homologs act antagonistically in the control of Wingless signaling through %-catenin-mediated transactivation (19Bauer A. Chauvet S. Huber O. Usseglio F. Rothbacher U. Aragnol D. Kemler R. Pradel J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6121-6130Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we report a global analysis of yeast genes affected by removal of Rvb1p or Rvb2p. We used targeted degradation of the Rvb proteins in combination with whole genome high density oligonucleotide arrays (24Wodicka L. Dong H. Mittmann M. Ho M.H. Lockhart D.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar) to characterize the in vivo functions of these proteins. We find that Rvb1p and Rvb2p cooperate, directly or indirectly, in transcriptional regulation of over 5% of yeast genes. In addition, we demonstrate that ATP binding and hydrolysis by the Rvb proteins is essential for their function in vivo and that both proteins are components of an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex in vitro. Plasmids used to generate the rvb1-td andrvb2-td alleles were constructed by replacing the CDC28 fragment in pPW66R (25Dohmen R.J. Wu P. Varshavsky A. Science. 1994; 263: 1273-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) with polymerase chain reaction-generated fragments from the N termini of RVB1 or RVB2. The plasmid pKL54 (26Labib K.

Propidium iodide staining and analysis was performed as described in Ref. 29Nash R. Tokiwa G. Anand S. Erickson K. Futcher A.B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4335-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar. Samples of 4 × 107 cells were harvested for each time point and flash-frozen on dry ice. Total RNA was isolated by phenol extraction and precipitation with lithium acetate. Yields were quantified by absorbance at 280 nm, and the samples were subsequently diluted to equal concentration. 5 μg of total RNA were loaded onto each lane on formaldehyde gels following standard protocol (30Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Nolan C. Ferguson M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates and Wiley-Interscience, New York1987: 7.37-7.52Google Scholar). Probes were generated by random 32P labeling using ORFs obtained from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL) as template. Transcript profiling with the Affymetrix GeneChips was performed using whole genome high density oligonucleotide arrays (24Wodicka L. Dong H. Mittmann M. Ho M.H. Lockhart D.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar) according to Affymetrix protocol. Briefly, 8 μg of total RNA were reverse-transcribed using a primer consisting of oligo(dT) coupled to a T7 RNA polymerase-binding site. The cDNA was made double-stranded and biotinylated cRNA synthesized using T7 polymerase. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed, and cRNA was quantitated by UV absorbance. For each sample 25 μl of cRNA were randomly sheared to an approximate length of 50 nucleotides and hybridized (16 h) to the Affymetrix GeneChips. External standards were included in each hybridization to control for hybridization efficiency, to test for sensitivity, and to assist in the comparisons between data sets from different experiments. These external standards were cRNA transcribed from cloned bacterial genes (bio b, bio c, bio d, and cre). The first hybridization was against a Test II Chip, to determine the quality of the cRNA mixture. Hybridized biotinylated cRNA was detected by incubation with phycoerythrin-streptavidin and was quantitated by scanning using the Hewlett-Packard GeneArray laser scanner. Following positive analysis of the Test Chip, the same hybridization mixture was added to the expression chip, and the chips were hybridized, reacted with phycoerythrin-streptavidin, washed, and then incubated with a polyclonal anti-streptavidin antibody coupled to phycoerythrin as an amplification step to aid in the detection of lower abundance transcripts. Following further washing, the expression chips were scanned as above. Analysis of the scanned data was performed using GeneChip software (version 3.3), Microsoft Access and Microsoft Excel. Affymetrix GeneChip software was used to calculate average difference (AvgDiff) and fold change (FC) values. For the analysis reported in Table II and in Fig. 4, the 0-h time point for each strain was used as base for the 4-h time point calculations. Analysis was limited to chromosomal ORFs, and non- or marginally expressed genes were discarded based on absent/present calls and a cut-off AvgDiff value of 200 across all six chips. Exceptions were made when a gene was present with an AvgDiff value of >1000 for at least one data set. For genes where negative AvgDiff values remained, a factor increasing the lowest number to 5 was added across the arrays. To select genes that are deregulated in thervb-td strains relative to the wild type strain, ratios of the values for the 0- and 4-h time points for each gene were calculated for the three strains and transformed to linearity by applying a base 2 logarithm, and then the log2 ratios for the wild type strain were subtracted from the corresponding log2 ratios for the two rvb-td strains. A difference in log2ratios greater than 1 corresponds to a more than 2-fold difference in response between rvb-td and wild type and was set as cut-off for further analysis. Finally we removed ORFs where confidence in the level of expression at base line was low because of excessive variation in AvgDiff values in the three yeast strains at 23 °C as well as non-annotated ORFs and Ty elements. 326 ORFs passed these criteria and were included in the analysis presented in Fig. 4.Table IIGenes most affected by removal of Rvb1p or Rvb2pORF nameNameFunctionCorrected fold change difference2-aA negative value denotes a fold decrease in transcription compared to the wild type strain and a positive value an increase in transcription at the 4-h time point.

For details see “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab The “corrected fold change difference” values reported in Table IIwere calculated based on GeneChip FC values that incorporate corrections for background noise in the experiments. To calculate differences between a pair of FC values we first reversed scaling applied by the GeneChip software to obtain raw expression ratios according to the formula (‖FC‖ − 1)×(FC/‖FC‖). The corrected fold change difference (FCdiff) was then calculated for a given gene by subtracting the raw expression ratio of the wild type strain from that of the rvb-td strain. For comparison of the effects of rvb1-td withrvb2-td and to the effects of swi1/snf2deletion (Fig. 5), a less stringent approach was used so as to compare our results with those of Sudarsanam et al. (31Sudarsanam P. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Winston F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3364-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Only the values obtained at the non-permissive temperature were used. AvgDiff values were calculated using the wild type strain as base. Non- or low expressing genes were removed based on absent calls and AvgDiff values as above, but with a cut-off at 400. Only genes present in both our data set and the swi1/snf2 data set were included, thus leaving 3991 ORFs for comparison. For immunoprecipitation experiments, 2-liter cultures of the strains YRA2 (RVB1-3Myc) and YKG3 were grown in YPD at 30 °C to anA600 of 1.0.

Pellets were resuspended at 2 ml/g in buffer A0.3 with protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin) and extracted on dry ice with a coffee grinder. 20,000 units of DNase I were added to 25 ml of lysate followed by incubation for 15 min on ice, 15 min at room temperature, and 1 h of gentle rocking at 4 °C. After ultracentrifugation for 90 min at 36,000 rpm in a Sorval SW41-Ti rotor, the extracts were pre-cleared with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C with gentle mixing, incubated with 75 μl of α-Myc (9E10) antibody-coupled protein A-Sepharose beads for 90 min at 4 °C, washed 1× with buffer A with 0.1m KCl (A0.1), and incubated in 500 μl of A0.1 with protease inhibitors and 1000 units of DNase I for 45 min at 22 °C. Beads were then washed 3× with buffer A0.3, 2× with A0.5, once in A0.1, and eluted by two sequential 30-min incubations at room temperature in 100 μl of A0.1 with 5 mg/ml Myc peptide (EQKLISEEDL). Proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining. Bands were excised, destained in-gel, digested with sequencing grade trypsin (Promega), and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Ten-μl reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 20 μm [α-32P]ATP (33 Ci/mmol) without or with 250 ng of M13mp18 single-stranded DNA, double-stranded plasmid DNA, or chromatinized linear double-stranded DNA. Rvb1p/Rvb2p complex (∼50 ng) or equal volumes of mock immunoprecipitate or buffer were added as indicated. Reactions were quenched by adding 1 μl of 0.5 m EDTA on ice. 2.5 μl of each reaction were separated by TLC on PEI-cellulose in 1 mformic acid with 0.5 m LiCl, and visualized by phosphorimaging. Chromatinized DNA (gift from J. Parvin) was prepared with histones purified from chromatin pellet of BJABS cells by gradient dialysis. End-labeled nucleosomal array 5S-G5E4 (32Neely K.E. Hassan A.H.

Biol. 2000; 20: 6380-6389Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Remodeling was carried out at 30 °C in 60 mm KCl, 7% glycerol, 4 mm MgCl2 ± 2 mm ATP·Mg, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Reactions were initiated by addition of 4 μl of end-labeled array to a final volume of 20 μl. The final concentration of array was ∼1 nm in mononucleosomes with ∼1.5 ng/μl of Rvb complex. At various times, 3-μl aliquots were removed and quenched in 4.5 μl of 2% SDS and 100 mm EDTA. The aliquots were deproteinized using 1 mg/ml proteinase K. Cut and uncut arrays were separated on 1% 1xTBE agarose gel and quantified by phosphorimaging. To determine the functions of Rvb1p and Rbv2pin vivo, a modification of the N-degron system for temperature-dependent protein degradation was used (25Dohmen R.J. Wu P. Varshavsky A. Science. 1994; 263: 1273-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar,26Labib K. Tercero J.A. Diffley J.F. Science. 2000; 288: 1643-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Briefly, the chromosomal copies of the RVB genes were replaced by a fusion consisting of ubiquitin (Ub), the N terminus of mutant DHFR (DHFR-ts), an HA epitope, and finally the respective RVB gene (Fig.1 A). Proteolytic removal of Ub results in a fusion protein with an arginine N terminus. At 23 °C the N-terminal arginine of DHFR-ts in not recognized by the polyubiquitination/proteasome pathway (25Dohmen R.J. Wu P. Varshavsky A. Science. 1994; 263: 1273-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), but upon shift to the non-permissive temperature (38 °C), the N terminus is exposed, and the protein is targeted for processive degradation. To increase the efficiency of degradation, the UBR1 gene is placed under control of a GAL1 promoter and tagged with a Myc epitope to facilitate detection (26Labib K. Tercero J.A. Diffley J.F. Science. 2000; 288: 1643-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). After preinduction of Ubr1 with galactose, cultures were shifted to 38 °C, and the degradation of Rvb proteins was monitored by immunoblotting (Fig. 1 C). The results show that degradation of Rvb1p and Rvb2p is virtually complete within 2 h of temperature shift. Concurrently, growth of the yeast slows down and eventually stops (Fig. 1 B). Because of the interaction with RP-A, and the essential nature of the yeast RVB genes, we considered that these proteins might have a unique role in S-phase. The morphology of the cells, however, indicated that loss of Rvb1p or Rvb2p resulted in cells ceasing growth in all stages of the cell cycle (not shown). This was confirmed by FACS analysis of propidium iodide-stained cells (Fig. 1 D). Thus Rvb1p and Rvb2p do not uniquely affect a metabolic process specific for S-phase. The stage in which the majority of cells arrested was highly dependent on conditions, such as the composition of the growth medium, indicating that growth arrest is not dependent on a single check point. For example, in rich medium the cells accumulated predominantly with a 1C DNA content (corresponding to G1), whereas in minimal medium the cells accumulated mostly with 2C (corresponding to G2). Such differential effects of Rvb1p and Rvb2p on the cell cycle, depending on whether growth was in rich or minimal media, were reminiscent of the differential effects on transcription caused by the Swi/Snf chromatin remodeling complex (31Sudarsanam P.

https://openalex.org/W2126750542,"Previous work from our laboratory demonstrates that the α4β1 integrin is an adhesion receptor for OPN and that α4β1 binding site(s) are present in the N-terminal thrombin fragment of osteopontin (OPN) (Bayless, K. J., Meininger, G. A., Scholtz, J. M., and Davis, G. E. (1998) J. Cell Sci. 111, 1165–1174). The work presented here identifies two α4β1 binding sites within a recombinantly produced N-terminal thrombin fragment of human OPN. Initial experiments, using wild-type OPN containing an RGD sequence or an OPN-RGE mutant, showed identical α4β1-dependent cell adhesive activity. A strategy to localize α4β1binding sites within the thrombin fragment of osteopontin involved performing a series of truncation analyses. Removal of the last 39 amino acids (130) completely eliminated adhesion, indicating all binding activity was present within that portion of the molecule. Combined mutation and deletion analyses of this region revealed the involvement of dual α4β1 binding sites. Synthetic peptides for both regions in OPN, ELVTDFPTDLPAT (131) and SVVYGLR (162), were found to block α4β1-dependent adhesion. The first peptide when coupled to Sepharose bound the α4β1 integrin directly whereas a mutated ELVTEFPTELPAT peptide showed a dramatically reduced ability to bind. These data collectively demonstrate that dual α4β1 integrin binding sites are present in a 38 amino acid domain within the N-terminal thrombin fragment of OPN.

Integrins are a family of transmembrane heterodimeric cell adhesion receptors (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar). The α4β1 integrin (VLA-4) is predominantly expressed on leukocytes (2Lobb R.R. Hemler M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1722-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 3Carlos T.M. Harlan J.M.

Cell. 1994; 77: 335-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Collectively, the α4β1 integrin appears to play a pathogenic role in inflammation, wound repair and tumor progression. Osteopontin (OPN)1 is an extracellular matrix protein originally isolated from bone (28Franzen A. Heinegard D. Biochem. J. 1985; 215: 715-724Crossref Scopus (435) Google Scholar), and much evidence has accumulated as to its role in bone physiology (29Butler W.T. Ritchie H. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 39: 169-179PubMed Google Scholar). OPN is also secreted by many epithelial surfaces (30Brown L.F. Berse B. Van de Water L. Papadopoulos-Sergiou A. Peruzzi C.A. Manseau E.J. Dvorak H.F. Senger D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1169-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), and one early study supported a role for OPN in host-response to bacterial infection (31Patarca R.

OPN has previously been found to be up-regulated in a variety of inflammatory, cardiovascular, and infectious diseases (32Giachelli C.M. Liaw L. Murry C.E. Schwartz S.M. Almeida M. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Other studies have suggested OPN may facilitate tumor cell metastasis (46Tuck A.B. Arsenault D.M. O'Malley F.P. Hota J. Ling M.C. Wilson S.M. Chambers A.F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4237-4246Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and decrease complement-mediated tumor cell destruction (47Fedarko N.S. Fohr B. Robey P.G. Young M.F. Fisher L.W. J. Biol.

Based on these data, the presence of OPN in the wound environment likely plays an important role in regulating disease progression in inflammatory and other conditions. The molecular domains in OPN that mediate its effects in these phenomena remain to be defined. The parallels between expression of the α4β1 leukocyte integrin and expression of OPN in wounds prompted a previous study by our laboratory to define osteopontin as a ligand for the α4β1integrin (14Bayless K.J. Meininger G.A. Scholtz J.M. Davis G.E. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we define two binding sites for the α4β1 integrin in the recombinant N-terminal thrombin fragment of human OPN using deletion and mutation analyses. A full-length cDNA clone of the human osteopontin gene was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) (48Kiefer M.C. Bauer D.M. Barr P.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3306Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and the sequence is shown in Fig.1 A. Sequences encoding the wild-type N-terminal thrombin fragment of osteopontin (rOPN-(17–168)) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the primers 5′-TAGGATCCATACCAGTTAAACAGGCTGATTCTGGAAG-3′ and 5′-GTAAGCTTTTACCTCAGTCCATAAACCACACTATCACCTCGGCCA-3′(Genosys, The Woodlands, TX). Sequences encoding a mutated N-terminal fragment ([Glu161]rOPN-(17–168)) in which the single RGD sequence at residues 159–161 was changed to RGE were obtained by substituting 5′-TAAAGCTTTTACCTCAGTCCATAAACCACACTTTCACCTCGGCCA-3′ for the downstream primer used to generate the wild-type fragment. Restriction digests of the polymerase chain reaction products and the pQE30 vector (Qiagen) were carried out overnight withBamHI and HindIII (Life Technologies, Inc.). Digested vector and insert were purified, quantitated, and ligated at an insert/vector ratio of 4.5:1 overnight at 14 °C (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). These constructs encode a modified version of rOPN-(17–168) and [Glu161]rOPN-(17–168) where the sequence RGSHHHHHHS replaces MRIAVICFCLLGITCA at the N terminus of wild-type osteopontin. All positive clones were confirmed by sequence analysis at Lone Star Labs (Houston, TX). All subsequent constructs studied contained the RGE mutation at amino acid 161. Additional recombinant constructs of OPN (Fig.1 B) were produced using the following primer sets: rOPN-(55–168), 5′-TAAAGCTTTTACCTCAGTCCATAAACCACACTTTCACCTCGGCCA-3′ and 5′-AGGGATCCCTAGCCCCACAGAATGCTGTGTCC-3′. The remaining constructs were constructed with a common upstream primer, 5′-TAGGATCCATACCAGTTAAACAGGCTGATTCTGGAAG-3′ and different downstream primers: rOPN-(17–164), 5′-AGAAGCTTTTAAACCACACTTTCACC-3′; rOPN-(17–129), 5′-AGAAGCTTTTAAGATTCATCAGAATGGTGAGAC-3′; rOPN-(17–135), 5′-CGAAGCTTTTAATCAGTGACCAGTTCATCAG-3′; rOPN-(17–138), 5′-AGAAGCTTTTACGTGGGAAAATCAGTGACC-3′; [Glu135]rOPN-(17–138), 5′-AGAAGCTTTTACGTGGGAAACTCAGTGACCAGTTC3′; rOPN-(17–142), 5′-AGAAGCTTTTATGCTGGCAGGTCCGTGGGAAAATC-3′; [Glu139]rOPN-(17–142), 5′-AGAAGCTTTTATGCTGGCAGCTCCGTGGGAAAATC-3′; rOPN-(17–150), 5′-AGAAGCTTTTAGACAACTGGAGTGAAAACTTCGGTTGC-3′. Cloning experiments were performed as described above, and positive clones were confirmed by sequence analysis at Lone Star Labs (Houston, TX). Escherichia coli strain RY2840 [MC4100 lacIQ1 lac+ slyD Kmr] (49Roof W.D. Horne S.M. Young K.D. Young R. J. Biol.

Cultures were grown to anA600 of 1.0 (∼2.5 h) before induction with 0.5 mm isopropylthiol-β-d-galactoside (IPTG-Life Technologies, Inc.). Cultures were allowed to incubate for 3.5–4 h at 37 °C in a shaking incubator before being placed on ice for 15 min. Bacteria were pelleted, supernatants removed, and pellets frozen at −80 °C. Pellets were thawed at 25 °C for 10 min, resuspended on ice in 20 ml Hepes buffered saline, pH 8.1 containing 25 mmHepes, 150 mm NaCl and 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzene sulfonylfluoride, HCl (CalBiochem). Bacteria were lysed and debris pelleted (20,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min) before adding supernatants to 2 ml of TALON metal ion affinity column (CLONTECH) equilibrated with Hepes buffer. Columns were incubated for a minimum of 20 min at 4 °C before washing with 20-column volumes of Hepes buffer. His-tagged proteins eluted with 0.2 m imidazole (Sigma) in Hepes buffer, and fractions were dialyzed (Mr cutoff 7,500) against 8 liters of phosphate-buffered saline. The purity of recombinant proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Protein concentration was estimated according to the method of Pace et al. (50Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Prot. Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar). Yields were ∼6 mg per 200 ml of culture. Cell adhesion assays were performed to determine the ability of OPN to promote leukocyte adhesion. Polystyrene microwells (Corning-Costar, Cambridge, MA) were coated with 50 μl of bovine OPN purified as previously described (51Bayless K.J. Davis G.E. Meininger G.A. Prot. Expression and Purif. 1997; 9: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) or recombinant fragments of OPN at a concentration of 20 μg/ml in TBS overnight at 4 °C. After blocking with 100 μl of 10 mg/ml BSA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in TBS, wells were rinsed with PSA (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY). HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells and Ramos cells (ATCC) were grown in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 10% fetal calf serum. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were grown in M199 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with heparin (Sigma), bovine brain extract (52Maciag T. Cerundolo J. Ilsley S. Kelley P.R. Forand R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 76: 5674-5678Crossref Scopus (577) Google Scholar), and 20% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Leukocytes were rinsed and resuspended in PSA at a density of 100,000 cells/well and endothelial cells at 35,000 cells per well. Media for adhesion in all leukocyte experiments contained a final concentration of 100 μg/ml BSA with physiological doses of CaCl2 (2 mm) and MgCl2 (1 mm). HL-60 cells were activated with the β1-activating antibody, 8A2 (53Kovach N.L. Carlos T.M. Yee E. Harlan J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) at a concentration of 1 μg/ml and a phorbol ester, 12–0-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate at a concentration of 50 ng/ml. Endothelial cells were allowed to attach in the presence of 100 μg/ml BSA with 1.5 mm CaCl2 and 1.5 mmMgCl2. After plating, cells were allowed to adhere for 30–60 min at which time they were rinsed and fixed with formalin. Plates were stained with 0.1% Amido Black for 5 min and rinsed and solubilized with 2 N NaOH to obtain an absorbance reading at 595 nm, which corresponds directly to the number of cells stained in each well (54Davis G.E. Camarillo C.W. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 7138-7150PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm the findings of the truncation studies, the SVVYGLR peptide (corresponding to C-terminal amino acids 162–168) was synthesized (Sigma-Genosys). Also generated were the wild-type peptide ELVTDFPTDLPATK and aspartate mutant ELVTEFPTELPATK, representing amino acids 131–143. The molecular weight of each peptide was confirmed by mass-spectral analysis (Sigma-Genosys). The synthetic peptides SVVYGLR, ELVTDFPTDLPATK, and ELVTEFPTELPATK were preincubated with cells at 250, 500, and 500 μg/ml, respectively under activating conditions in the presence of divalent cations for 15 min. Following the incubation period, cells were seeded, and the assay was performed as described above. To illustrate the integrin-binding capacity of osteopontin, the synthetic peptides ELVTDFPTDLPATK and ELVTEFPTELPATK were coupled to cyanogen-bromide 4B (Sigma) at 5 mg/ml according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ramos cells (ATCC) were surface biotinylated as described (55Davis G.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 242-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and a 50-μl pellet of cells was extracted with 1 ml of TBS containing 3% octylglucoside (ICN, Irvine, CA) in 1.5 mmMg2+, 1.5 mm Mn2+, and 10−3m phenylmethane sulfonic acid. The HL-60 cell extracts were agitated at 5–10 min intervals with Sepharose columns (0.5 ml) over a 2-h period at 0 °C. The columns were washed with 5 ml of TBS containing 3% octylglucoside, 1.5 mmMg2+, and 1.5 mm Mn2+. This was followed with a 15-ml wash in TBS containing 1% octylglucoside, 1.5 mm Mg2+, and 1.5 mmMn2+. Integrins were eluted with 2 ml of TBS with 1% octylglucoside + 10 mm EDTA (0.25-ml fractions). 40 μl of each fraction were loaded and run under nonreducing conditions on a 7% acrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was blocked overnight at 4 °C with 5% milk in 0.1% Tween 20 saline containing 2.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Blots were washed and streptavidin alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) was added (1:1000) to 1% BSA in Tween 20 saline and incubated for 30 min followed by a 30-min wash in Tween 20 saline. The alkaline phosphatase activity was developed using alkaline phosphatase development kit (Bio-Rad) and stopped with water. Integrins that bound to the OPN-Sepharose column were identified using immunoprecipitation. Sepharose beads conjugated with goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) were rinsed and suspended 1:1 with 0.5% Triton X-100 in TBS. In 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, 200 μl of the bead mixture was added to 5 μg of monoclonal antibodies against several human integrin subunits including α4 (HP2/1, Immunotech) (56Sanchez-Madrid F. De Landazuri M.O. Morago G. Cebrian M. Acevedo A. Bernabeu C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1986; 16: 1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), β1(mAb13, Becton-Dickinson) (57Akiyama S.K. Yamada S.S. Chen W.T. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), and α5 (IIA1, PharMingen) (58Van Nhieu G.T. Isberg R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24367-24375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These mixtures were then combined with 280 μl of pooled EDTA eluate from OPN-Sepharose and 700 μl of 0.5% Triton X-100 in TBS. This mixture was rotated continuously at 4 °C overnight after which time tubes were centrifuged and rinsed six times with 1 ml of 0.5% Triton X-100 in TBS. 75 μl of 2× sample buffer was added to the beads, and this mixture was boiled for 5 min. 30-μl samples were run on 7% SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, and blots were developed as described above. To rule out the involvement of the RGD site in α4β1-dependent adhesion to OPN, the wild-type, RGD-containing N-terminal thrombin fragment (rOPN-(17–168)) and an RGE mutant ([Glu161]rOPN-(17–168)), where Asp161was mutated to Glu161, were produced. Each clone is described as rOPN followed by the amino acids coded for in the construct (e.g. 17–168) and finally the mutation incorporated into the clone (e.g. Glu161 for Asp161 mutated to Glu161). Clones were sequenced to confirm successful mutation, and recombinant proteins (>95% purity) were analyzed using SDS-PAGE (not shown). Western blotting experiments using a monoclonal antibody directed to the N-terminal histidine tag revealed a pattern exactly matching staining results (not shown). Proteins were tested for their ability to promote αvβ3-dependent attachment (Fig.2 A). Wild-type rOPN-(17–168) promoted endothelial cell attachment dose dependently, whereas no attachment occurred to the RGE mutant. This confirmed successful functional mutation of the RGD site in OPN. The ability of both recombinant OPN constructs to promote α4β1-dependent adhesion was compared using the HL-60 promyelocytic cell line in the presence of physiologic divalent cations (2 mm Ca2+, 1 mm Mg2+). As shown in Fig. 2 B, no differences were observed in the ability of either construct to promote HL-60 cell attachment. Additionally, both rOPN-(17–168) and [Glu161]rOPN-(17–168) were comparable with bovine OPN with respect to their ability to promote α4β1-dependent cell attachment (Fig. 2 C). Adhesion to both native OPN and recombinant constructs was completely inhibited by the α4β1-specific LDV peptide. The control peptide, LEV, had lesser effects compared with control (no peptide). Minimal adhesion was observed to the BSA substrate. Collectively, these data indicate that the RGD site in the N terminus of OPN is not involved in α4β1-dependent adhesion to recombinant OPN, as rOPN-(17–168) and [Glu161]rOPN-(17–168). Consequently, subsequent constructs described contain the RGE mutation (Glu161) to rule out any influence from the RGD site in OPN, although the presence of this mutation is not reflected to simplify nomenclature. Various deletions of the OPN molecule were introduced in an attempt to localize α4β1 binding sites. SDS-PAGE analysis of the recombinant proteins revealed ∼95% purity as visualized by Coomassie Blue staining, and all proteins contained an N-terminal histidine tag by Western blot analysis (data not shown). The rOPN-(55–168), rOPN-(17–129), rOPN-(17–138), rOPN-(17–142), rOPN-(17–164), and rOPN-(17–168) constructs were tested for the ability to promote α4β1-dependent attachment of HL-60 cells (Fig. 3). These experiments revealed that removal of the first 39 amino acids (rOPN-(55–168)) did not reduce cell binding compared with the entire thrombin fragment, rOPN-(17–168). All binding activity was removed by truncation of amino acids 130–168 (rOPN-(17–129)), with partial activity returning in the presence of amino acid residues 130–142 (rOPN-(17–138) and rOPN-(17–142)). In addition, decreased adhesion occurred by deletion of the last 4 amino acids (rOPN-(17–164)), which was previously shown to eliminate the α9β1integrin binding site in OPN (59Yokosaki Y. Matsuura N. Sasaki T. Murakami I. Schneider H. Higashiyama S. Saitoh Y. Yamakido M. Taooka Y. Sheppard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36328-36334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). A more detailed analysis of binding activity was conducted with the constructs shown in Fig. 1 B. Dose-response curves illustrating the ability of constructs to promote HL-60 cell attachment are shown in Fig. 4. No binding was observed with truncation of the last 38 amino acids (rOPN-(17–129)), and identical results were observed with the rOPN-(17–135) construct. Partial activity was restored with the addition of amino acids 130–138 (rOPN-(17–138)) indicating the presence of a potential binding site. Activity remained at similar levels with the addition of amino acids 139–164 (rOPN-(17–142), rOPN-(17–150), rOPN-(17–164)). Only in the presence of the last 4 amino acids did full activity return (rOPN-(17–168)). Thus, deletion of the last 4 amino acids on the C terminus of the thrombin fragment of OPN partially eliminated the ability of α4β1-dependent cell attachment to occur. The remainder of binding activity was completely removed with further truncation of the molecule by ending at amino acid residue 129. These data strongly support the concept that two binding sites exist within residues 130–168. To examine in more detail whether the Asp135 and Asp139 residues located within the upstream binding region identified were important in α4β1-dependent cell attachment, additional constructs incorporating mutations were generated (Fig. 4). The [Glu135]rOPN-(17–138) exhibited reduced adhesion compared with rOPN-(17–138). The same was true for [Glu139]rOPN-(17–142) versusrOPN-(17–142). Interestingly, neither of the mutations completely abolished adhesion, indicating that the conservative substitution of glutamate for aspartate did not remove all activity. Collectively, these data indicate that there are dual α4β1 binding sites in the N-terminal thrombin fragment of OPN. To confirm both sequences in osteopontin were capable of binding the α4β1 integrin, the synthetic ELVTDFPTDLPATK and SVVYGLR peptides, corresponding to amino acids 131–143 (with a C-terminal lysine residue added) and 162–168, respectively, were tested for their ability to block α4β1-dependent attachment (Fig.5). Also, the synthetic peptide ELVTEFPTELPATK was created containing two conservative Asp to Glu mutations to further examine whether the aspartate residues were involved in binding to α4β1. In the presence of both the ELVTDFPTDLPATK and SVVYGLR peptides, α4β1-dependent adhesion was inhibited significantly compared with control (p < 0.001). The ELVTEFPTELPATK peptide consistently had smaller effects compared with control, similar to that observed with the LEV peptide (see Fig. 2 C). As further evidence for direct interaction of amino acids 131–143 in OPN with the α4β1 integrin, affinity chromatography experiments were performed using surface-labeled Ramos cell extracts (Fig. 6 A).

By Ser → Ala mutational and deletion analysis, we have identified two regions in this domain: 1) a C-terminal region (amino acids 540–588), which is required for basal activity; and 2) the 422–540 region, which responds to external stimuli as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α or phorbol myristate acetate plus ionomycin. Ser from 454 to 473 were shown to be required for TNFα-induced activation, whereas Ser between 492 and 519 were required for phorbol myristate acetate plus ionomycin activation. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase C (PKC) ζ were identified as downstream signaling molecules of TNFα-activation of c-Rel transactivating activity. Interestingly, dominant negative forms of PI3K inhibited PKCζ activation and dominant negative PKCζ inhibited PI3K-mediated activation of c-Rel transactivating activity, indicating a cross-talk between both enzymes. We have identified the critical role of different Ser for PKCζ- and PI3K-mediated responses. Interestingly, those c-Rel mutants not only did not respond to TNFα but also acted as dominant negative forms of nuclear factor κB activation.

Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5588) Google Scholar). The NF-κB family of transcription factors is composed of homo- and heterodimers of a family of proteins, which include the Dorsal gene ofDrosophila and the mammalian genesnfκb1, nfκb2, c-rel, relA (p65), and relB (for review, see Ref. 2Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4625) Google Scholar). All members share a conserved 300-amino acid region in their N terminus that includes the dimerization, nuclear localization, and DNA binding regions. c-Rel, RelB, and RelA also have C-terminal transactivation domains, which strongly activate transcription from NF-κB sites. NF-κB is rapidly activated by the T cell receptor complex, but, at later phases of T cell activation, autocrine or paracrine secreted TNFα takes control of NF-κB activation (3Pimentel-Muiños F.X. Mazana J. Fresno M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α is a pleiotropic cytokine with biological effects ranging from promoting growth and differentiation to induction of apoptosis. Those effects rely, at least in part, in the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB (for review, see Ref. 4Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Boldin M.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 331-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). In T cells, the initial phase of NF-κB activation after T cell receptor triggering mainly relies on p65 translocation, whereas the later phase is controlled by c-Rel. We have previously shown that autocrine or paracrine TNFα secretion controls the c-Rel levels in T cells (3Pimentel-Muiños F.X. Mazana J. Fresno M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, c-Rel activation emerges as a key point for the later phase of T lymphocyte activation, a fact that is supported by the functional unresponsiveness of T lymphocytes from the c-Rel knock out mice (5Gerondakis S. Strasser A. Metcalf D. Grigoriadis G. Scheerlinck J.Y. Grumont R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3405-3409Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 6Liou H.C. Jin Z. Tumang J. Andjelic S. Smith K.A. Liuo M.L. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). NF-κB activity is regulated, at least in part, by its subcellular localization. Thus, functional NF-κB complexes are held in the cytoplasm of resting T cells in an inactive state complexed with members of the IκB family. In response to different activators, which include T cell receptor and TNFα, IκB is phosphorylated by IκB kinases (IKKs), and subsequently degraded, liberating the active NF-κB complex, which translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription (for review, see Ref. 7May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Recently, a second level of regulation of NF-κB activity independent of IκB, which relies in the activation of the transcriptional activity of p65, has been described (8Schmitz M.L. dos Santos Silva M.A. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15576-15584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 9Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10Wang D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Thus, the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A was shown to be bound to inactive NF-κB complexes, and upon IκB degradation this catalytic subunit phosphorylated p65, resulting in an enhanced transcription promoting activity (11Zhong H. Voll R.E. Ghosh S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 661-671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). Moreover, TNFα treatment of cells results in phosphorylation of Ser529 in the transactivation domain of p65, resulting in the activation of the transcriptional activity of the protein (10Wang D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29411-29416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The small GTP-binding protein Ras enhanced p65/RelA transcriptional activity through a pathway that required the stress-activated protein kinase p38 or a related kinase (12Norris J.L. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13841-16846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), although it was not demonstrated whether this kinase was directly involved in activating NF-κB or instead a transcriptional co-activator. The activity of Ras as well as the atypical protein kinase C ζ (PKCζ) has been also shown to be essential for the transcriptional activity of p65/RelA in endothelial cells (13Anrather J. Csizmadia V. Soares M.P. Winkler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13594-13603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). This activation relies in the phosphorylation of the N-terminal Rel homology domain and not on the C-terminal transactivation domain. PKCζ was able to phosphorylate and activate IKK2 (14Lallena M.J. Dı́az-Meco M.T. Bren G. Pay C.V. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2180-2188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus demonstrating its direct implication in the NF-κB activation process by participating in IκB degradation. A recently identified 62-kDa protein (named p62) might function as a bridge between PKCζ and the TNF receptor-associated protein RIP (15Sanz L. Sánchez P. Lallena M.J. Dı́az-Meco M.T. Moscat J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3044-3053Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PI3K activity seems to be required for interleukin-1- and TNFα-induced NF-κB activity (16Sizemore N. Leung S. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Reddy S.A. Huang J.H. Liao W.S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The PI3Ks are a family of lipid kinases that catalyze the addition of a phosphate group to the 3′-OH position of the inositol ring of phosphoinositides. The 3-phosphoinositides are second messengers that exert specific regulatory functions inside the cells (18Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). PI3K is composed of two different subunits, a regulatory subunit (p85) and a catalytic subunit, termed p110. Upon stimulation, p85 becomes associated to the cytosolic portion of tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors via its SH2 domains, which in turn promotes its association with the catalytic subunit p110 and its subsequent activation. The activation of PI3K triggers a signaling cascade that leads to the specific phosphorylation of p65/RelA subunit. This phosphorylation enhances p65-mediated transcription without affecting IκB degradation, nuclear translocation of NF-κB, or the ability of NF-κB to bind to DNA (16Sizemore N. Leung S. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the transactivation domain of p65 by CD and NMR spectroscopy revealed no defined structure (19Schmitz M.L. dos Santos Silva M.A. Altmann H. Czisch M. Holak T.A. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25613-25620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two differentiated acidic regions (termed TA1 and TA2) were identified as essential for its transcription promoting activity. Only TA2, however, was responsible for the activation by phorbol ester stimulation by a mechanism that involved phosphorylation of Ser residues (8Schmitz M.L. dos Santos Silva M.A. Baeuerle P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15576-15584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Moreover, the high Ser content of the transactivation domain of the avian c-Rel-related oncogene v-rel has been demonstrated to be essential for its transforming capabilities (20Chen C. Agnës F. Gèlinas C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the mutation of the Ser residue 471 in the human c-Rel transactivation domain abrogated TNFα-induced NF-κB activity in a Jurkat T cell clone (21Martı́n A.G. Fresno M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24383-24391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Taken together, all these works point to a key functional role of the regulation of the transactivation domain of c-Rel family proteins for NF-κB function. In this work we have characterized the regulation of c-Rel transactivation domain. This domain seems to belong to the family of the phosphorylation-dependent Ser-rich acidic transactivation domains. We have revealed the critical role of several Ser residues for TNFα-dependent activation. Interestingly, mutations of those Ser residues not only abrogated c-Rel transactivating activity, but also acted as dominant negative forms of NF-κB activation, further stressing the importance of this regulation in the activity of NF-κB. Additionally, we have identified PI3K and PKCζ as enzymes participating in the signaling route that leads to c-Rel activation by TNFα. Jurkat cells and COS-7 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Life Technologies, Inc.) and containing 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, 2 mml-glutamine, plus nonessential amino acids, at 37 °C in a 7% CO2-in-air atmosphere saturated with water vapor incubator. Recombinant human tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) was purchased from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA). Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), calcium ionophore A23187 and HA1004, andl-1-chloro-3-[4-tosylamido]-4-phenyl-2-butanone (TPCK) were purchased from Sigma. Cyclosporin A, cypermethrin, and LY294002 were purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). The inhibitors wortmannin and D609 were obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). The inhibitor SB203580 was a kind gift of Dr. J. M. Redondo (Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, Madrid, Spain). The lipid phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) was obtained from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Sera from rabbits hyperimmunized with peptides derived from human c-Rel (no. 265), kindly provided by Dr. Nancy Rice (NCI-FCRDC, Frederick, MD) were used to detect the corresponding protein on Western blots, used at a dilution of 1:10,000. Monoclonal anti-epitope HA antibody used for immunoprecipitation studies was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). The pNF3TK Luc reporter plasmid contains a trimer of the NF-κB-binding motif of the H-2k gene upstream of the TK minimal promoter and the luciferase reporter gene (22Yano O. Kanellopoulos J. Kieran M. Le Bail O. Israel A. Kourilsky P. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3317-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The reporter Gal4 Luc contains five tandem repeats of the Gal4 element upstream from the luciferase reporter gene (kindly provided by Dr. J. M. Redondo). Expression plasmids encoding either wild-type or dominant-negative mutant of PKCζ were kindly provided by Dr. J. Moscat (Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, Madrid, Spain). Δp85 expresses deletion mutant of p85 subunit of human PI3K enzyme incapable of binding to catalytic subunit p110, rendering a dominant-negative form of the enzyme (kindly provided by Dr. J. Downward, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, United Kingdom). Gal4 c-Rel-(309–588) wild type was made by cloning the corresponding c-Rel PCR fragment into the XhoI-BglII site of the Gal4 c-Jun-(1–166) plasmid, thus removing the c-Jun fragment. The template for PCR reactions was pRc-hc-Rel, which consists of pRcCMV with c-Rel cDNA inserted in the HindIII-XbaI site. Gal4 DNA binding domain (DBD) fusions with different c-Rel transactivation domain deletion mutants were made using the same approach as Gal4 c-Rel-(309–588). The fragments fused to Gal4 DBD were:Gal4-(309–318), Gal4-(309–372), Gal4-(309–421), Gal4-(309–455), Gal4-(309–497), Gal4-(309–540), Gal4-(422–588), Gal4-(456–588), Gal4-(498–588), Gal4-(541–588), Gal4-(498–540), Gal4-(456–497), and Gal4-(422–455). Substitutions Ser→Ala were made with the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), using as template for mutation the Gal4-c-Rel deletion mutant Δ7-(422–588). Mutation was confirmed by sequencing in each case. Substitutions were as follows: A1 = Ser426; A2 = Ser443, Ser444, Ser447; A3 = Ser454; A4 = Ser460; A5 = Ser463; A6 = Ser470, Ser471, Ser473; A7 = Ser484; A8 = Ser491, Ser494; A9 = Ser508, Ser509, Ser510, Ser511, Ser513; A10 = Ser518; A11 = Ser525, Ser527; A12 = Ser533, Ser536; A13 = Ser541; A14 = Ser546, Ser549, Ser551; A15 = Ser563, Ser566; A16 = Ser577, Ser579. Similar substitutions were made using pRc-hc-Rel as template. Jurkat T cells or COS-7 cells were washed once and resuspended at 106 cells/ml in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were transfected with the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) preparing the LipofectAMINE Plus-plasmid mixtures in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C in a 7% CO2 incubator for 3 h before washing with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 5% FBS, and incubated for another 18 h. The cells were then washed once with, and resuspended at the same concentration in, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 5% FBS. Culture medium with or without stimuli, as indicated in text (10 ng/ml TNFα or PMA (10 ng/ml) + calcium ionophore (1 μm)) was added to duplicate wells containing 0.5 ml of these cell suspensions, which were then incubated under the same conditions for 6 h. The cells were lysed with Passive Cell Culture Lysis Reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) and microcentrifuged at full speed for 5 min at 4 °C, and 20 μl of each supernatant was used to determine firefly luciferase activity in a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). The results were expressed as -fold increase in luminescence relative to the value obtained with the non-stimulated control after normalization with respect to protein concentration, determined by the bicinchoninic acid spectrophotometric method (Pierce). For normalization of transfection efficiency, cells were co-transfected with the reporter plasmid pTK Renilla(Promega) and luciferase activity recorded using the Dual Luciferase assay (Promega). Results are always expressed as values normalized toRenilla activity. Whole cell extracts (WCE) were made using TNT buffer as lysis buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm benzamidine, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and phosphatase inhibitors (5 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO). For immunoprecipitation, WCE were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 1 μg of anti-HA antibody. Precipitates were collected on protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden), separated in a 10% SDS-PAGE, and subsequently transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were analyzed by Western blot. For Western blot, WCE were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Rabbit anti-human c-Rel was used as first antibody, and goat anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase as secondary antibody. The enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) developing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to identify the relevant band(s). c-Rel transactivation domain constructs from position 422–588 or 422–540 (using as template pRc-hc-Rel wild type) were cloned into theBamHI-EcoRI site of plasmid pGEX2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in order to express recombinant GST-c-Rel fusion protein. These recombinant proteins were purified from E. coli induced cultures according to the manufacturer's instructions. 25 μl of GSH-agarose-GST-c-Rel were used as substrate of an in vitro phosphorylation reaction in which whole cell extracts from non-stimulated or stimulated Jurkat cells were assayed. WCE were made from 106 Jurkat cells in 25 μl, as described above. The reaction mixture (kinase buffer) contained 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 μm ATP, and 1 μCi of [32P]ATP (specific activity, 3,000 Ci/mol). After 20 min at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by washing with TNT buffer. Phosphorylated protein was boiled in 25 μl of Laemmli sample buffer and resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. For PKCζ phosphorylation assay, anti-HA precipitates from WCE from transfected COS-7 cells were incubated in the kinase buffer described before, containing 1 μg of soluble recombinant GST c-Rel-(422–588). Mouse c-Rel transactivation domain has been previously localized in the C-terminal region of the protein, between positions 403 and 568 (23Bull P. Morley K.L. Hoekstra M.F. Hunter T. Verma I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5473-5485Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In order to delineate the transcriptionally active region of human c-Rel we constructed several fusion plasmids between the Gal4 DBD and c-Rel, providing a system where transcriptional activity of this protein could be assayed without interference of IκB association and/or degradation. The fragment of c-Rel from position 309 to 588 was fused to Gal4 DBD, and several deletion mutants of this region were generated (Fig. 1). These constructs were transfected into Jurkat T cells along with a 5xGal4 Luc reporter plasmid and luciferase activity was recorded. As a negative control, a construction which covered only the c-Rel fragment from position 309 to 318 fused to Gal4 DBD was used. Constructions spanning the c-Rel region from 309 to 421 had no basal transcriptional activity, as the control construction Gal4-(309–318) (Fig. 1, right). A minimal transcriptional activation was observed when Gal4-(309–455) was transfected. By contrast, Gal4-(422–588) induced an activity of the Gal4 reporter that was 236% of the wild-type fusion, indicating that this region possessed all the transcriptionally active sequences of c-Rel and even behaved as a better autonomous transactivation domain that the whole c-Rel C-terminal region (from position 309 to 588). Progressive deletions toward the C terminus were introduced in this region (Gal4-(456–588), Gal4-(498–588), and Gal4-(541–588)), which increasingly reduced the transcriptional activity. However, the smallest construction Gal4-(541–588) still evidenced a significant transcription promoting activity. That opened the possibility of the co-existence of several subdomains within region 422–588. To test this, smaller fragments covering this region were fused to Gal4 DBD (Gal4-(498–540), Gal4-(456–497), and Gal4-(422–455)). As shown in Fig. 1, none of them were transcriptionally active, indicating that region 422–588 behaved as a single transcription activation domain. We used the Gal4 DBD fusion plasmids described in the preceding section to map the region responsible for the transcriptional activation of c-Rel by TNFα and compared it with the activation produced by PMA + ionophore. Table Ilists the TNFα and PMA + ionophore inducibility of the different constructions. The region responsive to activation mapped between positions 422 and 540. Although region 540–588 showed a strong basal transcription activity (Fig. 1), it did not respond to stimulation, suggesting that this C-terminal region was necessary for the basal transcriptional activity of c-Rel but was not involved in TNFα or PMA + ionophore stimulation.Table IStimulation of the transactivating activity of Gal4 DBD-c-Rel wild-type and deletion mutant fusionsc-Rel fragmentTNFα 1-aFold activation above corresponding unstimulated construction: ++, >3; +, 2–3; +/−, >2; −, >1.PMA + ionophore1-aFold activation above corresponding unstimulated construction: ++, >3; +, 2–3; +/−, >2; −, >1.Wild-type+++309–318−−309–372−−309–421−−309–455−+/−309–497++++309–540+++422–588++456–588++++498–588++541–588−+/−498–540−−456–497−−422–455−−1-a Fold activation above corresponding unstimulated construction: ++, >3; +, 2–3; +/−, >2; −, >1. Open table in a new tab The above results indicate the region 422–588 includes the transcription promoting region of c-Rel, whereas the region 422–540 was responsible for integrating signals derived from activation by TNFα and PMA + ionophore. This region contains 33 Ser residues (20%), 20 acidic residues (12%), and 8 Pro residues (5%), suggesting that it could be an acidic transcription activation domain, despite not having any significant homology to conventional acidic and Pro-rich transactivation domains (24Hahn S. Cell. 1993; 72: 481-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The existence of 20% Ser residues could confer it with the properties of a transcription activation domain regulated by phosphorylation. Those Ser residues are strongly conserved between the human and murine proteins, suggesting the relevance of those residues for function. In order to study their functional relevance, we introduced Ser → Ala mutations into the Gal4-c-Rel-(422–588) (Fig.2 A) fusion. We subsequently assayed for the basal and the TNFα- or PMA/ionophore-induced transcriptional activity of the substitution mutants transfected into Jurkat T cells. However, we did not observe significant differences in the basal activity in any of the Ser → Ala substitutions (Fig.2 B), indicating that none of them is absolutely necessary for the basal transcriptional activity of c-Rel. Interestingly, when we assayed for activation by TNFα or PMA + ionophore, we observed that mutants A3, A4, A5, and A6 failed to respond to TNFα stimulation by increasing its transactivating activity, whereas mutants A8, A9, and A10 showed a reduced response to either PMA + ionophore or TNFα. Mutants A13-A16, included within the constitutively active region 541–588, showed a reduced response, as well. This results identified one region essential for the activation of c-Rel transcriptional capabilities by TNFα, which includes the Ser residues 454, 460, 463, 470, 471, and 473. Substitution of those residues abrogated the activation of c-Rel by TNFα. A second region including Ser residues 491, 494, 508, 509, 510, 511, 513, and 518 was identified to be involved in c-Rel activation, although it was not essential (TableII).Table IIStimulation of the transactivating activity of Gal4 DBD-c-Rel wild-type and Ser → Ala mutantsc-Rel mutantTNFα2-aFold activation above corresponding unstimulated construction: ++, >3; +, 2–3; +/−, >2; −, >1.PMA + ionophore2-aFold activation above corresponding unstimulated construction: ++, >3; +, 2–3; +/−, >2; −, >1.Wild-type+++A1+++A2+++A3−++A4−++A5−++A6−++A7+++A8+/−+/−A9+/−+/−A10+/−+/−A11+++A12++A13+/−+A14+/−+A15+/−+A16+/−+/−2-a Fold activation above corresponding unstimulated construction: ++, >3; +, 2–3; +/−, >2; −, >1. Open table in a new tab We used several commercial inhibitors of putative signaling enzymes to define the route leading to c-Rel activation by TNFα. We first transfected Jurkat T cells with a NF-κB reporter plasmid and tested the effect of different inhibitors in TNFα-stimulated NF-κB activity. As a control, the proteasome inhibitor TPCK was used as a generic inhibitor of NF-κB activity since it interferes with the degradation of IκB. Of the different inhibitors used, only the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin significantly inhibited TNFα stimulation of NF-κB activity (Fig.3 A). To corroborate the effect of wortmannin, another inhibitor of PI3K, LY294002, structurally unrelated to wortmannin, produced similar inhibition of NF-κB activity (Fig. 3 B). Neither LY294002 was wortmannin affected cell viability (data not shown). However, NF-κB activity results from the combined effect of IκB degradation and c-Rel and p65 activation. Thus, in order to study exclusively the implication of PI3K on c-Rel transactivating activity, we transfected Jurkat cells with the Gal4 c-Rel-(309–588) construct and tested the effect of the PI3K inhibitors. Both PI3K inhibitors prevented the transcription activity of c-Rel stimulated by TNFα (Fig. 3 C). PKCζ has been recently found to be involved in the process of NF-κB activation by TNFα stimulation (25Domı́nguez I. Sanz L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Dı́az-Meco M.T. Virelizier J.L. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1290-1295Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), so we studied the effect of this kinase on c-Rel activation. Jurkat T cells were co-transfected with the NF-κB reporter along with a plasmid that expressed either a wild-type or a dominant-negative mutant form of PKCζ. Co-transfection of wild-type PKCζ induced a strong increase in NF-κB-driven reporter activity, compared with cells co-transfected with an empty plasmid (Fig. 4). Furthermore, co-transfection of the PKCζ dominant-negative mutant inhibited the activation of NF-κB transcriptional activity by TNFα (Fig. 4 A). Parallel experiments were carried out assaying the activity of the Gal4 reporter driven by Gal4 c-Rel-(309–588) construct. Co-transfection of PKCζ induced a strong activity of the Gal4 reporter, in a similar way as it did with the NF-κB reporter, and TNFα stimulation induced a still higher activation of the reporter (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, co-transfection of a PKCζ dominant-negative mutant completely inhibited TNFα activation. Taken together, those results suggested the involvement of PKCζ in the activation of the c-Rel transactivation domain by TNFα and subsequently in NF-κB activation. The above results indicated that PI3K and PKCζ were involved in the activation of the c-Rel transactivation domain by TNFα. On the other hand, the products of PI3K activity, PIP2 and PIP3, have been described to activate PKCζ (26Standaert M.L. Galloway L. Karnam P. Bandyopadhyay G. Moscat J. Farese R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30075-30082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Thus, these enzymes could be participating in the same signaling pathway leading to c-Rel activation by TNFα. To investigate this, Jurkat cells were transfected with a dominant-negative mutant of PI3K (termed Δp85), resulting in the inhibition of both the NF-κB- and Gal4 c-Rel-driven activity induced by co-transfection of active PKCζ (Fig. 4). Additionally, the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 inhibited the activation of NF-κB-dependent reporter activity (Fig.5 A), as well as activation of Gal4 c-Rel-driven activity (Fig. 5 B) induced by transfection of wild-type PKCζ. On the other hand, PIP3, the product of PI3K activity, was able to induce the activity of Gal4 reporter driven by Gal4 c-Rel when added exogenou"

To investigate the role of the IGF-IR in protection from UV-mimetic-induced DNA damage, 4-nitroquinolineN-oxide (4-NQO) was used. In this study we show that the activation of the IGF-IR is capable of rescuing NWTb3 cells overexpressing normal IGF-IRs from 4-NQO-induced DNA damage as demonstrated by cellular proliferation assays. This action was specific for the IGF-IR since cells expressing dominant negative IGF-IRs were not rescued from 4-NQO UV-mimetic treatment. DNA damage induced by 4-NQO in NWTb3 cells was significantly decreased after IGF-IR activation as measured by comet assay. IGF-I was also able to overcome the cell cycle arrest, observed after 4-NQO treatment, thereby enhancing the ability of NWTb3 cells to enter S phase. Interestingly, the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway was shown to represent the main signaling pathway involved in the IGF-IR-mediated rescue of UV-like damaged cells. The ability of the IGF-IR to induce DNA repair was also demonstrated by infecting NWTb3 cells with UV-irradiated adenovirus. Activation of the IGF-IR resulted in enhanced β-galactosidase reporter gene activity demonstrating repair of the damaged DNA.

The IGFs, their receptors, and IGF-binding proteins constitute a family of cellular modulators that play essential roles in the regulation of growth and development. The actions of IGFs are believed to result primarily from the activation of the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) (1Butler A.A. Yakar S. Gewolb I.H. Karas M. Okubo Y. LeRoith D. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 121: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The IGF-IR resembles the insulin receptor in structural as well as functional aspects (2LeRoith D. Werner H. Beitner-Johnson D. Roberts Jr., C.T. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 143-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). This heterotetrameric transmembrane glycoprotein consists of 2 α- and 2 β-subunits. The tyrosine kinase catalytic site and the ATP-binding site are located in the cytoplasmic portion of the β-subunit. The β-subunit of the IGF-IR has intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity that is stimulated when IGF-I binds to the α-subunit. The receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylates intracellular substrates such as the insulin receptor substrates IRS-1, IRS-2, and Shc. Two different major pathways then emerge; one pathway involves ERK1/2 through Ras/Raf/MEK and the other pathway proceeds through PI3K (see for review Ref. 1Butler A.A. Yakar S. Gewolb I.H. Karas M. Okubo Y. LeRoith D. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 121: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Thus, the IGF-IR activated by its ligands plays an important role in the growth of cells inducing mitogenesis, transformation, and protection of cells from a variety of apoptotic injuries (3Baserga R. Hongo A. Rubini M. Prisco M. Valentinis B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F105-F126Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). The IGF-IR was also shown to be involved in mitogenesis through the IRS molecules (4Qu B.H. Karas M. Koval A. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31179-31184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and IGF-I can also protect fibroblasts from apoptosis induced by UV-B light through the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway (5Kulik G. Klippel A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). Moreover, the MAPK pathway may play a role in cell survival independent of PI3K/Akt as was demonstrated in fibroblasts overexpressing the IGF-IR (6Kulik G. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6711-6718Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 7Parrizas M. Saltiel A.R. LeRoith D. J. Biol.

IGF-I can also stimulate the proliferation of hematopoietic cells in combination with other hematopoietic growth factors (8Okajima Y. Matsumura I. Nishiura T. Hashimoto K. Yoshida H. Ishikawa J.

The viability of most cells is dependent on the presence of growth factors; recently, IGF-IR-mediated neuroprotection was shown to be mediated via induction of NF-κB that is dependent upon activation of the PI3K pathway (11Heck S. Lezoualc'h F. Engert S. Behl C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9828-9835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Keratinocytes are more susceptible to UVB-induced apoptosis if the growth medium is depleted of exogenous growth factors; the activation of the IGF-IR was shown to promote the survival of human keratinocytes following UVB irradiation (12Kuhn C. Hurwitz S.A. Kumar M.G. Cotton J. Spandau D.F. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To investigate further the mechanisms involved in IGF-IR activation on rescuing cells against UV-like DNA damage, different cell lines were damaged with 4-NQO, an UV-like mimetic agent. We used NWTb3 cells, a NIH-3T3-derived cell line overexpressing the normal human IGF-IR (13Blakesley V.A. Kato H. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2764-2769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To compare cell rescue of NWTb3 cells, parental NIH-3T3 and NIH-3T3-derived cell lines expressing dominant negative IGF-IRs (NKA8 and NKR1) were used (14Kato H. Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2655-2661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated the effect of IGF-IR stimulation on the cellular proliferation of cells after DNA damage, and we determined which signaling pathways are involved in this cell rescue. With the use of an UV-damaged adenoviral vector, we also show the direct effect of IGF-IR activation on DNA repair. 4-Nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO) and PI3-kinase-specific inhibitor LY 294002 were purchased from Sigma, and recombinant human IGF-I (rhIGF-I) was a gift of Genentech (San Francisco, CA).

The stock solutions of pharmacological inhibitors such as LY 294002, U 0126, and SB 202190 were all prepared in Me2SO at a concentration of 1000-fold so that when they were added to the culture medium, the concentration of Me2SO was below 0.1%. The antibodies used for Western blotting were purchased from New England Biolabs Inc.

The NWTb3 cell line established in this laboratory expresses the normal human IGF-IR at a level of ∼4 × 105receptors/cell (13Blakesley V.A. Kato H. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2764-2769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The NKA8 and NKR1 cell lines, where the Lys-1003 residue at the ATP-binding site was substituted by Ala (NKA8 mutant) or Arg (NKR1 mutant), respectively (14Kato H. Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2655-2661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), express the dominant negative human IGF-IR (∼3–7 × 105 receptors/cell). The parental NIH-3T3 cell line was routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 300 μg/ml l-glutamine in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 (37 °C). NWTb3, NKA8, and NKR1 cells were cultured in the same medium with the addition of 0.5 g/liter G418 (Geneticin). NWTb3 cells were cultured in 100-mm dishes (1 × 106 cell/dish) in the medium described under the cell culture method. The day after seeding, cells were starved overnight in FBS-free medium. After incubation (1 h at 37 °C) with inhibitors (appropriate dilutions) and stimulation with 50 nm IGF-I (10 min at 37 °C), the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, and total cell lysates were prepared on ice with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 0.3 mm NaMo, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 0.5 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride). The cell lysates were centrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was separated. The total protein concentration was measured using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Phosphorylated Akt, ERK1/2, and p38 as well as Akt, ERK1/2, and p38 protein were detected in 15 μg of protein cell lysate by Western blotting using antibodies against phospho-Akt, phospho-ERK1/2, and phospho-p38 as well as against total Akt, ERK1/2, and p38 protein, respectively. All antibodies used were diluted 1:1000 in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 0.1% plus 5% bovine serum albumin. The UV-mimetic drug 4-NQO was dissolved in absolute ethanol at a concentration of 2 mm, whereupon a 100 μm stock solution was prepared by diluting the concentrated solution in serum-free medium and stored at −20 °C for use throughout the study. All 4-NQO treatments were performed with a final concentration of 2.5 μm 4-NQO in serum-free medium for 30 min at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Following 4-NQO treatment, cultures were rinsed with pre-warmed (37 °C) 5% FBS/DMEM and then incubated in the same medium containing different compounds (IGF-I and specific pathway inhibitors) for various times as indicated in the cell proliferation method. The cell proliferation assay was performed using the CyQUANT Cell Proliferation kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and an HTS 7000 BioAssay reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The NWTb3 overexpressing IGF-IR and the other cell lines were cultured in 75-cm2 flasks. When flasks were 90% confluent, cells were counted using a hemocytometer. Cells were seeded on 96-well Costar Cluster plates (Corning Glass) in 200 μl of DMEM with 10% FBS. For the standard curve, the cell number at base line ranged from 1,000 to 40,000 per well. After 15 h of incubation, the medium was changed to 1% FBS/DMEM for an overnight starvation. 2.5 μm 4-NQO was added to the medium during 30 min at 37 °C, and cells were then washed and cultured in 5% FBS/DMEM with or without 50 nm IGF-I, in the absence or in the presence of different inhibitors (see figure for the concentrations used). Cells were then incubated for 5 days. The same experiment was performed on NWTb3 cells transiently transfected with a dominant negative p38 construct (pCMV5-p38AGF). The transfection was performed the day after seeding the cells, and cell proliferation assay was performed as described, with 4-NQO and IGF-I treatments. At the indicated times, the medium from plates was aspirated, and the plate was stored at −70 °C until all plates had been processed. The cells were then lysed using the lysis buffer from the CyQUANT kit. The fluorescence intensity of the DNA binding dye was measured using an HTS 7000 microplate reader with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 535 nm. NWTb3 cells were seeded the day before the transfection. Cells were then transiently transfected using the FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions with 3.6 μg of a p38 dominant negative construct (16Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar) or vector alone (p38 dn(+) or vector alone -(−)). In order to determine the transfection efficiency under the conditions used in this experiment, 3.6 μg of DNA from pSV-β-galactosidase control vector (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to transiently transfect NWTb3 cells. 24 h after transfection, in situβ-galactosidase staining for enzyme expression was performed, and transfected cells (blue staining) were counted over the total cell number. To check p38 phosphorylation in NWTb3 cells transfected with the p38 dn construct and compare with cells transfected with vector alone, cells were starved overnight 24 h after transfection and stimulated with 50 nm IGF-I (10 min at 37 °C). Protein extracts were prepared as described previously, and Western blot analyses were performed with anti-phospho-p38 antibody to detect p38 phosphorylation induced by IGF-I stimulation as well as with a p38 antibody to detect both endogenous and transfected p38 proteins (transfection efficiency). A single cell gel electrophoresis assay (17Ostling O. Johanson K.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 123: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar) was performed using the Trevigen Comet assay kit (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's conditions. This comet assay provides an effective method for evaluating DNA damage into cells. The principle of this assay is based upon the ability of denatured and cleaved DNA fragments to migrate out of the cell under the influence of an electric potential, whereas undamaged and supercoiled DNA stays in the cell when a current is applied. NWTb3 cells (190,000cell/well) were plated in 6-well plates in 10% FBS/DMEM. After seeding (15 h), the medium was replaced by 1% FBS/DMEM for overnight starvation. Cells were treated or not with 2.5 μm 4-NQO during 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed and incubated with or without 50 nm IGF-I in DMEM, 5% FBS for the indicated times. Untreated cells (negative controls) and cells treated with 100 μm H2O2(positive controls) were included in the assay. At every 24 h time point, cells were scraped and counted. After washing once with ice-cold PBS, a dilution of 1 × 105cell/ml was used to perform the assay. Cells were mixed with molten agarose (ratio 1:10), and 50 μl were pipetted onto Comet Slides. Slides were immersed in lysis solution and incubated on ice for 30 min, followed by an immersion in an alkali buffer for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Slides were rinsed in TBE 1× before electrophoresis (1 V/cm for 10 min). Samples were stained with the supplied SYBR Green dye, and slides were viewed using an inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a FITC filter (AXIOVERT 100S, Zeiss). The presence of a tail, so called “comet,” reflects DNA damage (single- and double-strand breaks, alkali-labile sites). For each condition, “comet cells” were counted in a total of 200 cells. Every 48 h following treatment with 2.5 μm 4-NQO (in control experiments 4-NQO was omitted) and incubation with or without 50 nm IGF-I in the presence of 5% FBS/DMEM, cells were collected and washed twice in PBS. Cell pellets were then resuspended in 100 μl of PBS, fixed in 1 ml of 70% ethanol, 30% saline buffer, and stored at −20 °C until analysis. Cells were washed twice with PBS followed by an incubation for 40 min in 0.5 ml of PBS containing 0.1% Triton and 50 μg of RNase at room temperature. 20 μg of propidium iodide (Sigma) was added, and the suspension was incubated in the dark at room temperature for 15 min. DNA content staining was finally determined by flow cytometry. All analyses were carried out on a FACSCalibur using CellQuest Software (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). The recombinant adenovirus AdCA35lacZ used in this study was constructed as described previously (15Addison C.L. Hitt M. Kunsken D. Graham F.L. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 1653-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In this vector, theEscherichia coli lacZ reporter gene is under the control of a 1.4-kilobase pair MCMV immediate early promoter. The virus was propagated in human 293 cells grown in modified Eagle's medium enriched with l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), and 10% heat-inactivated FBS. AdCA35lacZ was amplified and purified as described previously (18Graham F.L. Eb A.J.V.D. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified adenovirus was obtained from a crude viral lysate by purification on a CsCl gradient resulting in a titer of 4 × 109 plaque-forming units (pfu)/ml. 100-μl aliquots of the adenovirus were frozen at −70 °C and kept until use. UV irradiation of the virus has been described previously (19Bennett C.B. Rainbow A.J. Mutagenesis. 1988; 3: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, 40 pfu/cell of viral suspension, diluted in 1% FBS/DMEM, was irradiated in a 35-mm dish on ice with continuous stirring using an EL UV lamp (model UVLS-26, 254 nm) and a UVX radiometer (both from UVP, Inc., Upland, CA) at an incident fluence rate of 2 watts/m2. For the host cell reactivation curve (HCR), the UV dose rates used were 0, 100, 200, 300, 500, 800, and 1000 J/m2. Aliquots of 200 μl were removed for each exposure to the virus and diluted appropriately with 1% FBS/DMEM. NWTb3 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 190,000 cells/well. 20 h after seeding, the medium was aspirated, and cells were infected with either UV-irradiated or non-irradiated AdCA35lacZ in a volume of 300 μl at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i) of 40 pfu/cell. Following viral adsorption for 90 min at 37 °C, the cells were washed twice with medium and re-fed with 2 ml of warmed 1% FBS medium. For the IGF-I experiments on the damaged virus DNA, a 90-min infection of the cells with the adenovirus was followed by washing the cells to remove any trace of virus, and cells were then re-fed with 1% FBS/DMEM with or without 50 nmIGF-I. Infected cells were harvested 48 h after infection, and cells were resuspended in 400 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Transgene activity was measured using the β-galactosidase assay kit (Promega). Results were normalized, and β-galactosidase activity of the cells infected with non-irradiated virus (J/m2) was set at a level of 1. Similar values were obtained when cell number was used for normalization. Given the importance of IGF-I and IGF-IR pathway in cell proliferation (4Qu B.H. Karas M. Koval A. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31179-31184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 20Blakesley V.A. Koval A.P. Stannard B.S. Scrimgeour A. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18411-18422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of IGF-IR activation on the cellular proliferation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts upon an UV-mimetic treatment using 4-NQO. Cell proliferation assays were performed on NWTb3 cells overexpressing normal human IGF-IR (13Blakesley V.A. Kato H. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2764-2769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). NWTb3 cells were treated with 4-NQO for 30 min at a concentration of 2.5 μm that was determined to induce cell growth arrest. 4-NQO was removed after the treatment, and the cells were washed twice and then stimulated with IGF-I at a physiological concentration (50 nm). As expected, IGF-I induced the stimulation of NWTb3 cell proliferation with an increasing cell number that reached a plateau after 4 and 5 days when cells became confluent (Fig.1 A). Moreover after 4-NQO treatment, IGF-IR activation resulted in an enhanced cellular proliferation of NWTb3, i.e. IGF-I was able to rescue the cells, whereas no growth was observed in the absence of IGF-I. This effect of IGF-I could be detected as early as 3 days after the 4-NQO treatment and was significant at 4 and 5 days (p < 0.001). Not only was IGF-I capable of maintaining the survival of these cells, but in addition an obvious enhancement of the cellular proliferation could be observed 4 and 5 days after 4-NQO treatment. The same experiment was performed with NIH-3T3 parental cells (Fig.1 B) and two cell lines expressing the dominant negative human IGF-IR, NKA8 and NKR1 cells ADDIN ENRfu (14Kato H. Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2655-2661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as shown in Fig. 1,C and D, respectively. It has been shown previously that NIH-3T3 cells express ∼16,000 IGF-IR/cell as compared with the NWTb3 cells (∼4 × 105 IGF-IR/cell). The IGF-I rescue was observed only in NWTb3 cells overexpressing normal IGF-IRs as compared with parental NIH-3T3, NKA8, and NKR1 cell lines. Thus, these data demonstrate that IGF-IR activation can overcome the inhibition of the cellular proliferation induced by 4-NQO, an UV-mimetic drug. In order to determine the role of 4-NQO in inhibiting cellular proliferation and the effect of IGF-I in overcoming this inhibition, we carried out fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. We examined the DNA content of cells treated (or not) with 2.5 μm 4-NQO and stimulated (or not) immediately after the 4-NQO with 50 nmIGF-I. 4-NQO induced cell cycle arrest of NWTb3 cells in G0–G1 since the percentage of cells in S phase was low and most of the cells were present in G0–G1 (Table I). No sub-2N (apoptotic) cells were detected in the presence of 4-NQO. IGF-I treatment was capable of rescuing the cells from growth arrest induced by 4-NQO as shown by an increase in S phase from 9 to 15% at day 2 and from 6 to 23% at day 4 after 4-NQO treatment (Table I). As a control experiment, DNA content analysis was performed on NWTb3 cells not treated with 4-NQO 2 and 4 days after the addition, or not, of IGF-I. As shown in the Table I (see numbers in parentheses), IGF-I was not able to increase significantly the number of cells in S phase (10–12% on day 4 after IGF-I treatment). These findings support the results obtained from the cellular proliferation assay of NWTb3 cells in the presence of 4-NQO and IGF-I.Table IDNA content analysis by FACS, cell cycle arrest by 4-NQO and rescue by IGF-ITime 1-aThe time after 2.5 μm 4-NQO treatment (30 min at 37 °C) of NWTb3 cells is indicated in days.IGF-I 1-bPost-treatment with 5 nm IGF-I.Cells in cell cycleG0–G1SG2–M%0−661519+6517182−79(59)9(18)12(23)+69(54)15(20)16(26)4−85(72)6(10)9(18)+61(68)23(12)16(20)Numbers in parentheses represent a control experiment with no 4-NQO treatment (n = 2).The results are shown at day-2 and day-4 time points after the addition (−/+) of IGF-I.

This table shows a representative experiment of DNA content analysis (n = 3). NWTb3 cells were exposed to the DNA-damaging agent 4-NQO with the aim of determining whether DNA damage occurring upon 4-NQO treatment could be restored by IGF-IR activation. Cell DNA damage was detected using a “comet assay” (also called single cell gel electrophoresis). To perform such an assay, NWTb3 cells were treated with 2.5 μm 4-NQO as described under “Experimental Procedures” and incubated with medium, with or without 50 nm of IGF-I, up to 5 days after the 4-NQO treatment. The cells exhibiting DNA damage, named comet cells were counted randomly for a total of 200 cells. As shown in Fig. 2, about 35% of the cells were shown to be damaged (comet cells) when the experiment was performed 4 days after the 4-NQO treatment, and 40% of the cells were comet cells 5 days after the same treatment. At each time point, IGF-I was able to decrease the percentage of comet cells from 35 (day 4) or 40% (day 5) to 5%. As shown in the figure, the level of DNA-damaged cells following the addition of IGF-I reaches the level of undamaged cells (negative control). Thus, it appears that these results correlate with those obtained with the cell proliferation assay; IGF-I is involved in rescuing NWTb3 cells from DNA damage, leading to normal cellular proliferation. In order to study the signaling pathways involved in the effect of IGF-I to rescue NWTb3 cells damaged following 4-NQO treatment, PI3K-, ERK1/2-, and p38-specific inhibitors were used. NWTb3 cells were treated with 2.5 μm 4-NQO and incubated during the indicated periods in the absence or in the presence of 50 nm IGF-I to induce rescue. Fig.3 indicates that in the presence of the PI3K pathway inhibitor LY 294002 (Fig. 3 A) or in the presence of the ERK1/2 inhibitor U 0126 (Fig. 3 B), no effect of these inhibitors was observed on the IGF-I rescue. In order to ensure that the inhibitors were active on protein phosphorylation induced by IGF-I stimulation, NWTb3 cells were treated for 1 h with inhibitors prior to the IGF-I stimulation (10 min). Western blotting analysis (Fig. 4) revealed the dose-dependent inhibition of LY 294002 (PI3K pathway), U 0126 (ERK1/2 pathway), and SB 202190 (p38 pathway), respectively, on the IGF-I-induced Akt, ERK1/2, and p38 phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 4 A, 10 μm LY 294002 was able to inhibit Akt phosphorylation induced by IGF-I stimulation and in the same manner; 2 μm U 0126 and 50 μm SB 202190 inhibited ERK1/2 (Fig. 4 B) and p38 (Fig. 4 C) phosphorylation, respectively. Western blot analyses, performed to detect all forms of Akt, ERK1/2, and p38 kinases, revealed that protein levels were similar among the samples.Figure 4Western blot analysis. Inhibition of IGF-I-induced Akt (A), ERK1/2 (B), and p38 (C) phosphorylation, respectively, by the PI3K inhibitor LY 294002, the MEK1/2 inhibitor U 0126, and the p38 inhibitor SB 202190. NWTb3 cells were plated in 100-mm dishes (1 × 106cell/dish).

Akt, ERK1/2, and p38 phosphorylation was immunodetected with phospho-antibodies as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the membranes were re-blotted with antibodies that detected the total proteins as a control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDown"

While the lipid-dependent PI3K downstream signaling is well characterized, little is known about PI3K protein kinase signaling and structural determinants of lipid substrate specificity across the various PI3K classes. Here we show that sequences C-terminal to the PI3K ATP-binding site determine the lipid substrate specificity of the class IA PI3Kα (p85/p110α). Transfer of such activation loop sequences from class II PI3Ks, class III PI3Ks, and a related mammalian target of rapamycin (FRAP) into p110α turns the lipid substrate specificity of the resulting hybrid protein into that of the donor protein, while leaving the protein kinase activity unaffected. All resulting hybrids lacked the ability to produce phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate in intact cells. Amino acid substitutions and structure modeling showed that two conserved positively charged (Lys and Arg) residues in the activation loop are crucial for the functionality of class I PI3Ks as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate kinases. By transient transfecion of 293 cells, we show that p110α hybrids, although unable to support lipid-dependent PI3K signaling, such as activation of protein kinase B/Akt and p70S6k, retain the capability to associate with and phosphorylate insulin receptor substrate-1, with the same specificity and higher efficacy than wild type PI3Kα.

Production of 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides is dependent on the activity of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) (5Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). According to their substrate specificity and mode of activation, PI3Ks are divided into three classes (6Domin J. Waterfield M.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Class I PI3Ks phosphorylate, in vitro, PtdIns, PtdIns 4-P, and PtdIns(4,5)P2 and are placed into two subclasses depending on their coupling to cell surface receptors. Class IA heterodimeric PI3Ks, to which the prototypic PI3Kα (p85α/p110α) belongs, are composed of an adaptor subunit of 50–85 kDa containing two SH2 domains and a tightly bound 110-kDa catalytic subunit of either the p110α, p110β, or p110δ Type. Upon receptor tyrosine kinase activation, the SH2 domains of the adaptor bring the heterodimer to the cell surface, thereby allowing the p110 catalytic subunit to phosphorylate its lipid substrate(s). The class IB PI3Kγ is associated to a p101 adapter, which was proposed to mediate activation via Gβγ subunits of trimeric G proteins (7Stephens L.R. Eguinoa A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Cooke F.

Besides, several PI3K-related enzymes exist that do not have demonstrated lipid kinase activity but are functional as protein kinases. These include enzymes involved in DNA repair such as the target of rapamycin (mTOR/FRAP), the catalytic subunit of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNAPK), and others (for a review, see Ref. 13Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In addition to their function as lipid kinases, PI3Ks have an intrinsic protein kinase activity, of which the physiological significance is less well characterized. Initial studies showed that p110α-mediated phosphorylation on the p85α adapter reduces the lipid kinase activity of the heterodimer (14Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Courtneidge S.A. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Likewise, a shut-off of activity has been observed in p110δ upon phosphorylation on serine 1039 (15Vanhaesebroeck B. Higashi K. Raven C. Welham M. Anderson S. Brennan P. Ward S.G. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1292-1302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has also been shown that the protein kinase activity of the class IB PI3Kγ is sufficient to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase Erk-2, thus overcoming the requirement for 3′-phosphorylated lipids in this pathway (16Bondeva T. Pirola L. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Rubio I. Wetzker R. Wymann M.P. Science. 1998; 282: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). An involvement for protein autophosphorylation in the activation of the class III PI3K has also been described, via an intrinsic serine/threonine kinase activity of Vps34 (17Stack J.H. Emr S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31552-31562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The function of the different PI3Ks is thus determined by their class-specific lipid substrate specificity and protein kinase activities. The lipid substrate specificity of PI3Ks, as well as of other members of the phosphoinositide kinases superfamily, appears to be dependent on activation loop sequences as determined by the following approaches: (a) sequence swapping on PI3Kγ (16Bondeva T. Pirola L. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Rubio I. Wetzker R. Wymann M.P. Science. 1998; 282: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), (b) activation loop swapping between type 1 and type 2 phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases (18Kunz J. Wilson M.P. Kisseleva M. Hurley J.H. Majerus P.W. Anderson R.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), and (c) molecular modeling studies on the x-ray-solved structure of PI3Kγ (19Walker E.H. Perisic O. Ried C. Stephens L. Williams R.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The activation loop of phosphoinositide kinases is located C-terminally to the conserved DFG motif of the catalytic domain and can be viewed as the topological counterpart of the activation loop of protein kinases (20Rao V.D. Misra S. Boronenkov I.V. Anderson R.A. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1998; 94: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that swapping of foreign sequences into the activation loop of p110α permits us to switch its lipid substrate specificity into that of class II or class III PI3Ks or even to fully abolish its lipid kinase activity, while leaving the protein kinase functionality unaltered. We then use the manipulated p110α to dissect the functionalities of the PI3Kα heterodimer as a lipid kinase and as a protein kinase. Further, we identify by site-directed mutagenesis key residues of class I PI3K required for phosphorylation of PtdIns(4, 5)P2. Our biochemical data provide a better understanding of the PI3K substrate specificity, and the chimeric construct described here should provide a powerful tool to distinguish lipid kinaseversus protein kinase functions of PI3K in signaling. To generate hybrid PI3Ks, silent PflMI and KpnI restriction sites were introduced by the unique site elimination method (21Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) into wild type p110α (22Hiles I.D. Otsu M. Volinia S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Dhand R. Panayotou G. Ruiz-Larrea F. Thompson A.

Oligonucleotide cassettes coding for selected amino acid sequences of class I, II, and III PI3Ks and FRAP as depicted in Fig. 1 were then ligated into thePflMI/KpnI-digested plasmids. All insertions were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Microsynth, Balgach, Switzerland) and transferred as PstI–HindIII fragments to cytomegalovirus promoter-driven expression vectors pSCT1 (23Wymann M.P.

Mutated regions were equally inserted into a p110α with an N-terminal Myc tag and an extension for a C-terminal isoprenylation sequence from Ha-Ras (Myc-p110α-CAAX in pSG5; see Ref. 25Khwaja A.

The pMT2-based expression vector for the p85α regulatory subunit was described before (23Wymann M.P. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Zvelebil M.J. Pirola L. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. Mol.

The expression plasmids Myc-p70S6k in pRK5 and Myc-iSH2 in pCMV6 were previously described (27Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A.

Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS; Life Technologies, Inc.). HEK 293 cells were seeded (2 × 106/10-cm dish) 24 h prior to transfection by the calcium phosphate method (typically with 1 μg of p85α and 10 μg of p110α expression vectors or 10 μg of GST-PI3Kγ expression vector). A medium change 12 h later was followed by cell lysis at 48 h (23Wymann M.P. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Zvelebil M.J. Pirola L. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1722-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells (3 × 105/6-cm dish) were seeded 24 h before transfection by the DEAE-dextran method. One microgram of expression vector was added to 10 μl of 20 mg/ml DEAE-dextran (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the volume was brought to 600 μl with PBS. Cells were incubated with the resulting mixture for 30 min, and then 3 ml of DMEM supplemented with 171 μm chloroquine was added. After 3 h, the medium was exchanged with DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS (v/v). Cells were lysed or metabolically labeled 48–60 h later. Heterodimers of p85α/p110α were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with anti-p85α antibodies and immobilized on protein A-Sepharose (CL-4B; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Alternatively, glutathione-Sepharose (4B; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to isolate GST-p110α·p85α complexes and GST-PI3Kγs. Sepharose beads were washed twice with lysis buffer (20 mmTris·HCl, 138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, pH 8.0, supplemented with 5% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmsodium-o-vanadate, 20 μm leupeptin, 18 μm pepstatin, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, and 20 mm NaF), twice with 0.1 m Tris-HCl plus 0.5 m LiCl (pH 7.4), and twice with the respective reaction buffers (see below). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against wortmannin, p110α, and p85α were used as previously described (23Wymann M.P. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Zvelebil M.J. Pirola L. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1722-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-Myc antibodies (9E10) were from Babco, rabbit anti-IRS-1 antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., and rabbit anti-phospho-PKB Ser473antibodies were from New England Biolabs. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were raised from hybridoma cells (clone PY72). Proteins were separated on standard SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore Corp.) according to Ref. 30Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar. Primary antibodies were detected with species-specific goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Pierce). Lipid kinase assays were basically carried out as previously described (31Kaplan D.R. Whitman M. Schaffhausen B. Pallas D.C. White M. Cantley L. Roberts T.M. Cell. 1987; 50: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Immobilized proteins were suspended in a presonicated mixture of 10 μg of phosphatidylserine and 10 μg of PtdIns, PtdIns 4-P, or PtdIns(4,5)P2 in 40 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4). Sodium cholate (2.3%, w/v) was included in mixtures containing PtdIns(4,5)P2. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of 50 μm ATP supplemented with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Hartmann Analytic) and kept at 30 °C for 10 min. Reactions were stopped by adding 50 μl of 1m HCl and 200 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v). Extracted lipids were separated on oxalate-treated silica 60 TLC plates (Merck) with chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (80:30:26:24:14, v/v/v/v/v). Phosphorylated lipids were detected by autoradiography on Kodak X-Omat films or phosphorimaging (GS-525 from Bio-Rad). The identity of lipid spots was verified by deacylation and HPLC analysis on a Partisphere SAX column as described by Arcaro and Wymann (32Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Protein serine kinase activity of PI3K was assayed as in Ref. 14Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F.

The activities of Myc-PKB and Myc-p70S6k were determined by using 30 μmCrosstide peptide as substrate as described (33Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar). Transiently transfected COS-7 were starved overnight in DMEM without FCS and then rinsed with phosphate-free DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc). Subsequently, cells were incubated with 250 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate (Hartmann Analytic) in 1.8 ml of phosphate-free DMEM per 6-cm dish for 3 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Total lipids were extracted according to Ref. 34Traynor-Kaplan A.E. Thompson B.L. Harris A.L. Taylor P. Omann G.M. Sklar L.A. J. Biol.

Glutathione-Sepharose with immobilized GST-p110α·p85 complexes was washed twice with PBS supplemented with 0.5% Triton X-100 and suspended in PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100. Wortmannin (1000× stock in Me2SO) was added to a final concentration of 200 nm and incubated for 15 min on ice. For substrate competition experiments, immobilized PI3Ks were incubated with 1 mm ATP or 0.1 mg/ml presonicated PtdIns(4,5)P2 for 15 min at 37 °C before the sample was put on ice and exposed to wortmannin. Excess inhibitor was removed by two PBS plus 0.5% Triton X-100 washes. SDS-PAGE and immunodetection of covalently bound wortmannin was carried out as in Ref. 23Wymann M.P. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Zvelebil M.J. Pirola L. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1722-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar. Wortmannin sensitivity of PI3K hybrids was assayed by measuring lipid or protein serine kinase activity of glutathione Sepharose-bound GST-p110α·p85 after a 15-min incubation with the indicated concentrations of wortmannin at 37 °C. PI3Kα·IRS-1 immune complexes subjected to a PI3K protein kinase assay were separated on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE. After separation, the gel was thoroughly rinsed with water and exposed overnight to a Kodak X-Omat film. The portion of the gel containing the radioactive IRS-1 band was excised and digested for 36 h with trypsin as described (35Gual P. Baron V. Lequoy V. Van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 884-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Tryptic digests (>3000 cpm) were spotted on a cellulose plate and the two-dimensional separation of the phosphopeptides consisted of a high voltage electrophoresis (900 V, 2.5 h in 30% formic acid) followed by a TLC separation with water/2-butanol/acetic acid/pyridine (48:60:12:40, v/v/v/v). For phosphoaminoacid analysis, the radioactively labeled IRS-1 was separated as above; HCl hydrolysis and phosphoaminoacid separation were performed as described (36Nguyen T.T. Scimeca J.C. Filloux C. Peraldi P. Carpentier J.L. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9803-9810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The model of p110α was generated using QUANTA™ with the x-ray structure of PI3Kγ (19Walker E.H. Perisic O. Ried C. Stephens L. Williams R.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) as the template. The location and orientation of ATP was directly transferred from the PI3Kγ structure to the model of p110α. The activation loop (not resolved in the PI3Kγ structure) was modeled by searching through a proprietary high resolution data base of fragments. The loop was then energetically minimized locally to alleviate steric hindrances. This was followed by Steepest Descent global minimization until the energy leveled out. PtdIns(4,5)P2 was modeled and docked manually using the SURFACE and GAPS programs of Laskowski (75Laskowski R.A. J. Mol. Graph. 1995; 13: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). Each orientation was examined subsequently for putative hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and bad contacts. Once a satisfactory initial orientation was obtained, the orientation of the activation loop was modeled to allow for contacts to be formed with the PtdIns(4,5)P2. This required only minor changes in Φ and Ψ angles and an adjustment of the Arg949 side chain. The new model was then subjected to a steepest descent minimization. Differences in accessibility were calculated using the program NACCESS (76Hubbard S.J. Campbell S.F. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 507-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) and where calculated for all residues within 15 Å from the PtdIns(4,5)P2 ligand accessed with a 1.4-Å probe. While the ATP-binding site of PI3Kα was biochemically localized by the identification of Lys802 as the residue taking part in the phosphate transfer reaction (23Wymann M.P. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Zvelebil M.J. Pirola L. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Panayotou G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1722-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) and most recently confirmed by crystallographic studies (19Walker E.H. Perisic O. Ried C. Stephens L. Williams R.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), little is known about the productive interaction of PI3Ks with phosphoinositides. We have shown previously that wortmannin covalently binds to Lys802 in PI3Kα and that this binding can be prevented by preincubation of PI3Ks with PtdIns(4,5)P2. This suggests a spatial overlap of the wortmannin and the PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding site. Putative PI-interacting residues were found C-terminal to the highly conserved DFG motif within homology region 1. In p110α, this region contains a polybasic stretch, 941KKKKFGYKRER951, characterized by two basic boxes, 941KKKK and947KRER; class II PI3Ks retain a KRDR box, similar to the 947KRER of p110α, but do not display homology to the 941KKKK box; class III members and PI3K-related proteins (FRAP/mTOR, DNAPK, ATM, and RAD 3 (13Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar)) possess, in the same region, sequences unrelated to the sequences observed in the PI3K classes I and II; and, inside the PI3K-related protein group, these sequences are also unrelated to each other. To establish whether the DFG C-terminal region plays a role in directing the substrate specificity of the various PI3K classes, we produced p110α hybrids in which the p110α amino acid sequence comprised between 933DFGHF and the conserved Leu956 was exchanged with corresponding sequences from class II p170/Cpk (8Molz L.

Domin J. Panaretou C. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3339-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), and the PI3K-related protein kinase FRAP (38Brown E.J. Albers M.W. Shin T.B. Ichikawa K. Keith C.T. Lane W.S. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1994; 369: 756-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (1673) Google Scholar). We hereby refer to these p110α hybrids as cII, cIII, and cIV upon insertion of p170/Cpk, Vps34, and FRAP sequences, respectively (Fig. 1). Since the alignment between p110α and Vps34 presents a 5-amino acid gap and the Vps34 region is rich in prolines, which may have disrupting effects on the secondary structure of the protein, several cIII hybrids were constructed; the entire region between 933DFGHFL and Leu956 was replaced by the sequence from Vps34 (cIII.2) or shorter pieces (cIII.1 and cIII.3), and arbitrary amino acids (AVAAV or AV; cIII.4 and cIII.5, respectively) were added to fill the 5-amino acid gap of the sequence alignment. Due to the absence of significant gaps among p110α, p170/Cpk, and FRAP and from the information gained in preliminary experiments with the cIII hybrids, a single cII and cIV hybrid was constructed (Fig. 1 B). The p110α hybrids were transiently expressed in 293 cells as PI3Kα heterodimers; p110α was either expressed untagged or as a GST fusion. The integrity of the heterodimer was not affected by the insertion of sequences from other PI3K classes, and the intact heterodimer was recovered either by immunoprecipitation with anti-p85α antibodies (see Fig.5 A) or glutathione beads fishing of GST-p110α (data not shown). We first used PtdIns as a substrate to evaluate the lipid kinase activity of the p110α hybrids, since it is an in vitro substrate common to the three PI3K classes (5Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 39Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). The lipid kinase activity of cIII.1, cIII.4, and cIII.5 p110α hybrids was 40% with respect to the control p110α WT, suggesting a minor affinity for the substrate of the Vps34 sequences inserted. Insertion of the whole Vps34 region comprised in the 933DFGHFL/Leu956 stretch, although corresponding to the best matched alignment, gave rise to a protein almost unable to support PtdIns phosphorylation, equal to for the hybrid carrying a 2-amino acid deletion (cIII.2 and cIII.3, respectively). The higher activities were thus observed in the hybrids maintaining the p110α VPFV sequence N-terminal to Leu956, as in the cIII.1 hybrid, regardless of further insertion of the AVAAV or AV sequences (cIII.4 and cIII.5 hybrids). Based on these results and on the lost specificity toward PtdIns 4-P and PtdIns(4,5)P2phosphorylation (see below), it appears that the minimal Vps34 amino acid sequence required to transform p110α into a class III-like lipid kinase is the 8-amino acid stretch GRDPKPLP (Fig. 1 B). The cII hybrid was more active toward PtdIns phosphorylation (143 ± 38% of the PtdIns (Fig. 2 A), and the cIV hybrid was lipid kinase-inactive. Insertion of the short region from FRAP (a PI3K-related protein with no lipid kinase activity assigned thus far), rendering p110α unable to behave as a lipid kinase, confirms the idea that the swapped region is involved in lipid substrate recognition and phosphorylation (Fig. 2). To assess whether the insertion of sequences from different PI3K classes affects the substrate specificity of the p110α hybrids,in vitro lipid kinase assays were performed using the three substrates accepted by class I PI3Kα. As previously shown (22Hiles I.D. Otsu M. Volinia S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Dhand R. Panayotou G. Ruiz-Larrea F. Thompson A. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. Courtneidge S.A. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D."
https://openalex.org/W2023679862,"In contrast to the knowledge regarding the function of chimeric Ewing sarcoma (EWS) fusion proteins that arise from chromosomal translocation, the cellular function of the RNA binding EWS protein is poorly characterized. EWS protein had been found mainly in the nucleus. In this report we show that EWS protein is not only found in the nucleus and cytosol but also on cell surfaces. After cell-surface biotinylation, isoelectric focusing of membrane fraction, avidin-agarose extraction of biotinylated proteins, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, EWS protein was identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization and nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry of in-gel-digested peptides. These analyses revealed that the protein, having repeated RGG motifs, is extensively asymmetrically dimethylated on arginine residues, the sites of which have been mapped by mass spectrometric methods. Out of a total of 30 Arg-Gly sequences, 29 arginines were found to be at least partially methylated. The Arg-Gly-Gly sequence was present in 21 of the 29 methylation sites, and in contrast to other methylated proteins, only 11 (38%) methylated arginine residues were found in the Gly-Arg-Gly sequence. The presence of Gly on the C-terminal side of the arginine residue seems to be a prerequisite for recognition by a protein-arginine N-methyltransferase (PRMT) catalyzing this asymmetric dimethylation reaction. One monomethylarginine and no symmetrically methylated arginine residue was found. The present findings imply that RNA-binding EWS protein shuttles from the nucleus to the cell surface in a methylated form, the role of which is discussed.

The presence of Gly on the C-terminal side of the arginine residue seems to be a prerequisite for recognition by a protein-arginine N-methyltransferase (PRMT) catalyzing this asymmetric dimethylation reaction. One monomethylarginine and no symmetrically methylated arginine residue was found. The present findings imply that RNA-binding EWS protein shuttles from the nucleus to the cell surface in a methylated form, the role of which is discussed. cyclophilin Ewing sarcoma protein-arginineN-methyltransferase phosphate-buffered saline 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry tandem mass spectrometry polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis peripheral blood mononuclear cells erythroblastosis virus-transforming sequence heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear protein While investigating a 90-kDa anti-cyclophilin (anti-CyP)1 immunoreactive band we noticed that anti-CyP antibodies recognized the RNA-binding Ewing sarcoma (EWS) protein and not a cyclophilin.

The EWS gene of Ewing sarcoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumor is translocated to one of different members of the ETS (erythroblastosis virus-transforming sequence) family that contains the highly conserved DNA binding ETS domain. Often the ETS domain is derived from FLI-1 (Friend leukemia integration-1) and in rare cases from ERG (ETS-related gene), ETV-1 (ETS translocation variant-1), E1AF (E1A factor), or FEV (fifth Ewing variant). In malignant melanoma of soft parts, EWS is fused to ATF-1, in intra-abdominal desmoplasmic small round-cell tumor to WT-1, in myxoid liposarcoma to CHOP, and in myxoid chrondrosarcoma to CHN (8de Alava E. Gerald W.L. J. Clin. Oncol. 2000; 18: 204-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The cellular role of wild-type EWS protein remains less clear. The EWS protein is a nuclear protein with unknown function containing a C-terminal RNA binding motif and a N-terminal activation domain (9Lessnick S.L. Braun B.S. Denny C.T. May W.A.

EWS protein interacts with an SH3 domain of Bruton's tyrosine kinase and has been identified in B cells as a phosphotyrosine-containing protein (13Guinamard R. Fougereau M. Seckinger P. Scand. J.

Global alignment of the EWS protein sequence either with human CyPA or CyPB using the program LALIGN revealed a low degree of identity (8.8%) in both cases, and some of the identity seems to be due to numerous glycines present in the proteins. The cross-reactivity led us, however, to the finding that the EWS protein is not only exposed on the cell surface of different cells but also that its arginine residues are extensively and asymmetrically dimethylated. These properties of the EWS protein shed a new light on the functionality of this unusual multidomain protein.The previously reported localization of EWS protein in the nucleus (20Bertolotti A.

A similar behavior was reported for nucleolin. This major nucleolar protein shuttles between the cytosol and the nucleus and has also been detected on the cell surface of different cells. The C-terminal domain of nucleolin is, as in the EWS protein, rich in glycine residues and interspersed with dimethylarginines. It was suggested as a potential receptor in the human immunodeficiency virus binding processes by interaction with the V3 loop of gp120 (21Srivastava M. Pollard H.B. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1911-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). So far we found cell-surface-exposed EWS protein in all investigated cells, i.e. Jurkat, H9, C816645 T cell lines, and PBM cells, but also NIH/3T3 fibroblasts (not shown). Remarkably, tumor cell lines showed a higher level of EWS protein expression on the cell surface (∼4-fold) than PBM cells and fibroblasts.Recognition Sequence of Asymmetric Methylation SitesArginine methylation is a post-translational modification found mainly in nuclear proteins that interact with RNA (22Gary J.D Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This modification is catalyzed by protein-arginine N-methyltransferases (PRMTs), utilizing S-adenosyl-l-methionine as the donor of methyl groups (23Lee H.W. Kim S. Paik W.K. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Type I protein-arginineN-methyltransferases (EC 2.1.1.23) catalyze the formation of N G-monomethylarginine and asymmetric ω-N G,N G-dimethylarginine residues, whereas Type II enzymes catalyze the formation ofN G-monomethylarginine and symmetric ω-N G,N′G-dimethylarginine residues (22Gary J.D Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Type III enzyme found in yeast catalyzes the monomethylation of the internal δ-guanidino nitrogen atom of arginine residues (24Zobel-Thropp P. Gary J.D. Clarke S. J. Biol.

PRMT1, a predominantly nuclear protein, methylates arginine residues of many proteins, among them RNA-binding proteins (22Gary J.D Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

In this study, the arginine dimethylation sites of the EWS protein from the cell surface of Jurkat and H9 cell lines were elucidated by mass spectrometric peptide mapping and sequencing. We found up to the present the EWS protein to be the most extensively methylated protein in vivo in higher eukaryotes. From sequences of known sites of asymmetric arginine methylation, a preferred recognition motif (G/F)GGRGG(G/F) had been proposed (Refs. 22Gary J.D Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 29Kim S. Merrill B.M. Rajpurohit R. Kumar A. Stone K.L. Papov V.V. Schneiders J.M. Szer W. Wilson S.H. Paik W.K. Williams K.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5185-5192Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar; TableII). The shorter sequence GRG had also been suggested as a specificity determinant for arginine methylation by a Type I enzyme, although the Gly at position −1 could be replaced by a few amino acids other than glycine (31Hyun Y.L. Lew D.B. Park S.H. Kim C.W. Paik W.K. Kim S. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 573-578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only the Gly +1 C-terminal of the arginine was found to be completely conserved. In the present study, all 29 identified dimethylarginines are indeed followed by a glycine (Table II). Conversely, all arginines in Arg-Gly sequences mapped by mass spectrometry (29 out of a total of 30 Arg-Gly sequences) were at least partially methylated. The sequence Arg-Gly-Gly is present in 21 of the 29 methylation sites; however, only 11 (38%) methylated arginine residues were found in a Gly-Arg-Gly sequence. The prevalence of Gly at positions −2 and −3 in EWS protein is even higher than at position −1. Obvious deviations from the suggested consensus sequence are the small number of phenylalanines at position −3 and +3 and of glycines at position +3. Thus, the suggested recognition sequence for asymmetric arginine dimethylation is only partially consistent with the sequences identified in this study. Only the presence of the Gly +1 C-terminal of the arginine residue is a strict requirement for asymmetric dimethylation but not the Gly N-terminal of the arginine. The found differences may be attributed to an insufficiently defined consensus sequence based on only 20 in vivo arginine methylation sites or to different Type I PRMTs with similar specificity that are involved in methylation of the arginine residues in EWS protein. Arginine methylation sites very distinct from those found in EWS protein and the other sites listed in Table II were observed in poly(A)-binding protein II. In this protein, almost all of the asymmetrically dimethylated and monomethylated arginines were found in Arg-Xaa-Arg cluster (28Smith J.J. Rucknagel K.P. Schierhorn A. Tang J. Nemeth A. Linder M.

Open table in a new tab Role of Methylation of EWS ProteinEWS protein belongs to a large family of RNA-binding proteins that includes heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, mRNA poly(A)-binding proteins (32Weighardt F. Biamonti G. Riva S. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 747-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and alternative splicing factors (33Krainer A.R. Mayeda A. Kozak D. Binns G. Cell. 1991; 66: 383-394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 34Zamore P.D. Patton J.G. Green M.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 609-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The methylation state of RNA-binding proteins (Table II) is likely to have an important effect on their function. One type of methylated RNA binding domain consists of RGG boxes, defined as closely repeated RGG tripeptides interrupted by other amino acids. The RNA binding of EWS protein is localized in the C-terminal domain, which contains RGG boxes (Ref. 10Ohno T. Ouchida M. Lee L. Gatalica Z. Rao V.N. Reddy E.S. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3087-3097PubMed Google Scholar; Fig. 2, residues 288–656). Considering the RNA binding properties of these proteins, arginine methylation in the RNA binding domain may regulate the RNA-EWS protein interaction most likely by preventing hydrogen bonding, by short range ionic interactions, and/or by introducing steric constraints and therefore diminishes otherwise strong interactions between unmodified arginine residues and RNA (35Calnan B.J. Tidor B. Biancalana S. Hudson D. Frankel A.D. Science. 1991; 252: 1167-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The methylated form of one of the well studied shuttling heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, A1, showed decreased affinity for single-stranded DNA compared with the unmethylated form (36Rajpurohit R. Paik W.K Kim S. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 903-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).The changes in the physico-chemical properties, e.g.increased hydrophobicity, loss of hydrogen bonding, and ionic interactions resulting from arginine methylation of nuclear as well as of cell-surface-localized EWS protein, might favor crossing the various cellular membranes or its embedding in the plasma membrane. Arginine methylation was found to facilitate export of certain heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins out of the nucleus, especially of proteins that bind mRNA (37Shen E.C. Henry M.F. Weiss V.H. Valentini S.R. Silver P.A. Lee M.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 679-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that methylation of EWS protein may play a role in its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and that it acts as a carrier for export of RNA constituents to the cytosol due to its RNA binding properties.Asymmetric methylation might also play a role in signal transduction. Stimulation of pre-B cells with lipopolysaccharide resulted in increased methylation of membrane proteins (22Gary J.D Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EWS protein, which is as the present results show extensively methylated on arginine residues, was found to interact with cellular kinases, suggesting its participation in cell signaling and proliferation. Under conditions leading to Bruton's tyrosine kinase activation, EWS protein was phosphorylated on tyrosines in mitotically arrested B cells (13Guinamard R. Fougereau M. Seckinger P. Scand. J. Immunol. 1997; 45: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and interacted with Pyk2 in an activation-dependent manner (14Felsch J.S. Lane W.S. Peralta E.G. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 485-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).The presence of asymmetrically arginine-dimethylated EWS protein as well as of nucleolin on the cell surface raises the question as to the significance of this localization. The present findings,i.e. the shuttling properties, together with the discussed properties of the EWS protein allow one to speculate that EWS protein or putative splicing products thereof can function as binding proteins or receptors for various ligands on the cell surface, e.g.nucleic acids, be it alone or in a complex with other proteins and, thus, might mediate, in an alternative regulation mechanism, between extracellular and nuclear events. While investigating a 90-kDa anti-cyclophilin (anti-CyP)1 immunoreactive band we noticed that anti-CyP antibodies recognized the RNA-binding Ewing sarcoma (EWS) protein and not a cyclophilin.

A similar behavior was reported for nucleolin. This major nucleolar protein shuttles between the cytosol and the nucleus and has also been detected on the cell surface of different cells. The C-terminal domain of nucleolin is, as in the EWS protein, rich in glycine residues and interspersed with dimethylarginines. It was suggested as a potential receptor in the human immunodeficiency virus binding processes by interaction with the V3 loop of gp120 (21Srivastava M. Pollard H.B. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1911-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). So far we found cell-surface-exposed EWS protein in all investigated cells, i.e. Jurkat, H9, C816645 T cell lines, and PBM cells, but also NIH/3T3 fibroblasts (not shown). Remarkably, tumor cell lines showed a higher level of EWS protein expression on the cell surface (∼4-fold) than PBM cells and fibroblasts.Recognition Sequence of Asymmetric Methylation SitesArginine methylation is a post-translational modification found mainly in nuclear proteins that interact with RNA (22Gary J.D Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This modification is catalyzed by protein-arginine N-methyltransferases (PRMTs), utilizing S-adenosyl-l-methionine as the donor of methyl groups (23Lee H.W. Kim S. Paik W.K. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Type I protein-arginineN-methyltransferases (EC 2.1.1.23) catalyze the formation of N G-monomethylarginine and asymmetric ω-N G,N G-dimethylarginine residues, whereas Type II enzymes catalyze the formation ofN G-monomethylarginin"
https://openalex.org/W2150531185,"The kinetics of promoter binding and open complex formation in bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase was investigated using 2-aminopurine (2-AP) modified promoters. 2-AP serves as an ideal probe to measure the kinetics of open complex formation because its fluorescence is sensitive to both base-unpairing and base-unstacking and to the nature of the neighboring bases. All four 2-AP bases in the TATA box showed an increase in fluorescence with similar kinetics upon binding to the T7 RNA polymerase, indicating that the TATA sequence becomes unpaired in a concerted manner. The 2-AP at −4 showed a peculiarly large increase in fluorescence upon binding to the T7 RNA polymerase. Based on the recent crystal structure of the T7 RNA polymerase-DNA complex, we propose that the large fluorescence increase is due to unstacking of the 2-AP base at −4 from the guanine at −5, during open complex formation. The unstacking may be a critical event in directing and placing the template strand correctly in the T7 RNA polymerase active site upon promoter melting for template directed RNA synthesis. Based on equilibrium fluorescence and stopped-flow kinetic studies, we propose that a fast form of T7 RNA polymerase binds promoter double-stranded DNA by a three-step mechanism. The initial collision complex or a closed complex, EDc is formed with a Kd of 1.8 μm. This complex isomerizes to an open complex, EDo1, in an energetically unfavorable reaction with an equilibrium constant of 0.12. The EDo1 further isomerizes to a more stable open complex, EDo2, with a rate constant around 300 s−1. Thus, in the absence of the initiating nucleotide, GTP, the overall equilibrium constant for closed to open complex conversion is 0.5 and the net rate of open complex formation is nearly 150 s−1.

The bacteriophage RNA polymerases, such as the T7 RNA polymerase, are single subunit enzymes capable of catalyzing all the processes such as initiation, elongation, and termination of transcription. The structural simplicity and the template specificity of the phage RNA polymerases make them attractive for exploring the mechanism of transcription and for understanding transcription regulation at the level of protein-DNA interactions. Various crystal structures of T7 RNA polymerase as a complex with the promoter DNA and initiating nucleotides are available, and these inspire detailed studies to understand the dynamics of the transcription initiation and elongation mechanisms (1Cheetham G.M.T. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature.. 1999; 399: 80-83Google Scholar, 2Cheetham G.M.T. Steitz T.A. Science.. 1999; 286: 2305-2309Google Scholar).The initiation of transcription is a multistep process that directs the polymerase to the promoter region, where RNA synthesis is initiated. After the RNA polymerase recognizes a consensus DNA sequence, the specific binding energy is used to melt a region of the promoter, part of which serves as a template for the initiation of RNA synthesis (3Cheetham G.M. Steitz T.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol... 2000; 10: 117-123Google Scholar). Several studies including the crystal structures show that T7 RNA polymerase recognizes a consensus sequence that extends from −17 to +4 relative to the transcription start site. In the absence of the initiating nucleotide, GTP, T7 RNA polymerase melts −4 to +2 region, which includes the TATA sequence, and in the presence of GTP, the unpaired region extends from −4 to +4 (4Muller D.K. Martin C.T. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry.. 1989; 28: 3306-3313Google Scholar). Our goal in these studies was to determine the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters that govern the formation of the closed and open complexes. These studies provide the framework to understand how the efficiency of initiation can be regulated by protein-DNA interactions during initiation.Previously, we have used the fluorescent adenine analog 2-AP,1 which was incorporated in the promoter DNAs, to monitor the dynamics of T7 RNA polymerase interactions with the T7 promoters (5Jia Y. Kumar A. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 30451-30458Google Scholar). These studies were carried out with the promoter DNAs in which all five adenines in the −4 to +4 region were substituted with 2-AP. These previous studies had indicated that T7 RNA polymerase exists in two forms (5Jia Y. Kumar A. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 30451-30458Google Scholar). The fast form binds dsDNA at close to a diffusion-limited rate and melts the promoter at a fast rate (5Jia Y. Kumar A. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 30451-30458Google Scholar). The slow form is observed only under excess DNA concentrations, and the kinetics of open complex formation are limited by the conversion of the slow form to the fast form. At that time, two other studies reported the kinetics of open complex formation in T7 RNA polymerase using 2-AP fluorescence (6Sastry S.S. Ross B.M. Biochemistry.. 1996; 35: 15715-15725Google Scholar, 7Ujvari A. Martin C.T. Biochemistry.. 1996; 35: 14574-14582Google Scholar). Our conclusions were similar to one study in the literature (7Ujvari A. Martin C.T. Biochemistry.. 1996; 35: 14574-14582Google Scholar), and it was proposed that open complex formation occurred very rapidly, but a second study indicated much slower rates of open complex formation (6Sastry S.S. Ross B.M. Biochemistry.. 1996; 35: 15715-15725Google Scholar). In the present paper, we have systematically substituted each of the adenines in the −4 to +4 region with 2-AP, and measured the kinetics of the fast form of the T7 RNA polymerase with these DNAs. The fluorescence stopped-flow studies have provided important structural insights and a more detailed multistep mechanism of the initiation process, including the rate constant and equilibrium constant of promoter opening and the associated conformational changes.DISCUSSIONThe transient-state fluorescence measurements have provided the detailed kinetics of the T7 RNA polymerase-promoter interactions. The interactions were measured by following the fluorescence of the 2-AP base, an analog of adenine that can be incorporated at specific positions in the promoter DNA. The normal bases in the DNA have very short decay times, typically few picoseconds, and as a result a very weak intrinsic fluorescence of DNA (11Millar D.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol... 1996; 6: 637-642Google Scholar, 12Millar D.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol... 1996; 6: 322-326Google Scholar). This hampers the use of normal DNA for studying DNA-protein interactions to monitor real-time changes in the DNA within the confines of the protein-DNA complex. However, substitution of a normal base by its modified structural analog with fluorescent properties, without significantly altering the native structure of DNA, provides an important handle to study real time changes in the DNA. The 2-AP is a structural analog of adenine that forms a stable Watson-Crick type base pair with thymine. The 2-AP:T base pair is only marginally weaker (0.5 kcal/mol) than a normal A:T pair as reported for a decamer (13Law S.M. Eritja R. Goodman M.F. Breslauer K.J. Biochemistry.. 1996; 35: 12329-12337Google Scholar). The 2-AP substitution does not destroy the B-helical structure of the dsDNA, and does not affect the specific recognition by proteins, in most cases (14McLaughlin L.W. Benseler F. Graeser E. Piel N. Scholtissek S. Biochemistry.. 1987; 26: 7238-7245Google Scholar, 15Nordlund T.M. Andersson S. Nilsson L. Rigler R. Graslund A. McLaughlin L.W. Biochemistry.. 1989; 28: 9095-9103Google Scholar, 16Xu D. Evans K.O. Nordlund T.M. Biochemistry.. 1994; 33: 9592-9599Google Scholar). The 2-AP can be selectively excited at longer wavelengths (310–320 nm), in the presence of tryptophan and tyrosine protein residues, and the 2-AP fluorescence is highly sensitive to the structure of the DNA.We have substituted four adenines in the TATA box preceding the initiation site of the T7 φ10 promoter and one adenine in the coding region individually to 2-AP. The absorption and fluorescence emission studies indicated that, although the 2-AP at all positions absorbed equally, their fluorescence intensity was dependent on the neighboring bases in the DNA sequence. The fluorescence intensity was the minimum when the 2-AP was flanked by guanines. The 2-AP fluorescence quenching by guanine has been reported (17Kelley S.O. Barton J.K. Science.. 1999; 283: 375-381Google Scholar). The results in the literature showed that the guanine caused static quenching of 2-AP fluorescence, when it was immediately adjacent to 2-AP, and the quenching was reduced when the guanine was placed at longer distances from 2-AP. Most effective quenching occurred through strong π-stacking when G was located on the same strand and adjacent to 2-AP. These results are in agreement with our observations that the 2-AP fluorescence in the DNA is dependent on the neighboring G residue. The fluorescence of 2-AP was also sensitive to the structure of the DNA. The fluorescence of H-bonded 2-AP at t(−4) position, for example, in the dsDNA promoter was less than one-tenth the fluorescence in the ssDNA (Fig. 1). Therefore, 2-AP can serve as a sensitive and site-specific probe to monitor local melting of the dsDNA. In fact, 2-AP has been employed successfully to monitor local melting of DNA bound to the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (18Hochstrasser R.A. Carver T.E. Sowers L.C. Millar D.P. Biochemistry.. 1994; 33: 11971-11979Google Scholar) and T7 RNA polymerase (6Sastry S.S. Ross B.M. Biochemistry.. 1996; 35: 15715-15725Google Scholar, 7Ujvari A. Martin C.T. Biochemistry.. 1996; 35: 14574-14582Google Scholar) and base-flipping/unstacking in EcoRI DNA methyltransferases (19Allan B.W. Beechem J.M. Lindstrom W.M. Reich N.O. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 2368-2373Google Scholar), and bacteriophage T4 DNA polymerase (20Otto M.R. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Beechem J.M. Biochemistry.. 1998; 37: 10156-10163Google Scholar).Peculiar Increase of 2-AP Fluorescence at t(−4)The fluorescence of all the 2-AP bases in the TATA box increased when the dsDNA promoter formed a complex with T7 RNA polymerase. The 2-AP at t(−4), however, showed a large increase in fluorescence that was 4-fold higher than the free ssDNA. This unusually large fluorescence increase of 2-AP at t(−4) was noted previously (7Ujvari A. Martin C.T. Biochemistry.. 1996; 35: 14574-14582Google Scholar), but the recent crystal structure of the T7 RNA polymerase-DNA complex provides a rationale for the large fluorescence increase specifically at position t(−4) (1Cheetham G.M.T. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature.. 1999; 399: 80-83Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the T7 RNA polymerase-DNA open complex shows that adenine at t(−4) is in a unique conformation relative to other adenines. As shown in Fig.6, the adenine at t(−4) is completely unstacked from the neighboring guanine at t(−5), and such unstacking is expected to cause a drastic increase in 2-AP fluorescence when placed at this position. This proposal is also supported by the fact that the t(−4) 2-AP shows an increase in fluorescence even in the p-dsDNA promoter. Since the 2-AP in the p-dsDNA promoter is premelted, the fluorescence increase most likely arises from base-unstacking. We rule out the possibility that specific interactions with the T7 RNA polymerase such as hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic interactions increase the fluorescence of 2-AP at t(−4), because such interactions are predicted to decrease the 2-AP fluorescence (21Ward D.C. Reich E. Stryer L. J. Biol. Chem... 1969; 244: 1228-1237Google Scholar).Three-step Mechanism of T7 RNA Polymerase Binding to Promoter DNAEach of the 2-AP bases in the TATA box showed an increase in fluorescence upon binding to the T7 RNA polymerase with similar kinetics indicating that the bases in the TATA region melt in a concerted manner during open complex formation. The simplest model that explained the stopped-flow kinetic data was the two-step mechanism. In this mechanism, the initial encounter of the T7 RNA polymerase with the DNA occurs at close to a diffusion-limited rate to form a closed complex EDc, which is in rapid equilibrium with free E and D. The EDc isomerizes at an observed rate close to 150 s−1 to form an open complex. It was interesting that the kinetics of the p-dsDNA promoter, which is premelted from −4 onward, showed a two-step DNA binding mechanism. The initial T7 RNA polymerase-p-dsDNA complex was formed similar to the dsDNA, but the subsequent isomerization step (∼ 300 s−1) was 2-fold faster in the p-dsDNA.Comparison of the fluorescence values of the p-dsDNA and dsDNA in the polymerase-DNA complex under conditions where the polymerase was in excess of the DNA suggested that only 29–36% of the complex dsDNA promoter was open. We therefore incorporated a third step after EDc formation in the dsDNA binding mechanism. The kinetic data at various polymerase concentrations were globally fit to the three-step mechanism, and the intrinsic rate constants are listed in Table I. The kinetic constants indicate that the EDccomplex resulting from the initial encounter of the T7 RNA polymerase with the dsDNA promoter has a Kd of 1.8 μm. This complex isomerizes to EDo1 with an unfavorable equilibrium constant of 0.12, and subsequently to EDo2 with a rate constant close to 322 s−1. A schematic representation of the promoter binding and open-complex formation steps is depicted in Fig.7. We postulate that, during the formation of EDc, the T7 RNA polymerase makes specific interactions with the conserved promoter recognition region from −17 to −5 sequence. The EDc complex then isomerizes to EDo1, in which the promoter is melted from −4 to −1, but the interactions of the template strand with the T7 RNA polymerase are not extensive to stabilize the complex. The EDo1 is therefore in equilibrium with the closed complex EDc. The EDo1 then isomerizes to EDo2, in which the template strand is directed within the active site of T7 RNA polymerase, making more extensive interactions, as seen in the recent crystal structure of the ED complex (1Cheetham G.M.T. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature.. 1999; 399: 80-83Google Scholar). The EDo2 is therefore a preinitiation complex, in which the template bases up to +2 are melted to pair with the incoming initiating GTPs for RNA synthesis. The three-step mechanism predicts an overall Kd for dsDNA equal to Kd1/(1 +K2 +K2*K3) = 0.98 μm (where numbers in subscript refers to step), which is in agreement with the Kd determined from fluorimetric titrations and nitrocellulose DNA binding experiments (data not shown). Similarly, the overall Kd for p-dsDNA is Kd1/(1 +K2) = 0.2 nm, which is similar to the Kd of 0.3 nm measured by equilibrium methods reported in our earlier paper (5Jia Y. Kumar A. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 30451-30458Google Scholar).In summary, the present studies have demonstrated a unique fluorescence change arising from unstacking of the 2-AP base at the junction of binding and melting regions of the promoter template strand, between bases −4A and −5G. This unstacking may be a critical event in directing and placing the template strand correctly in the T7 RNA polymerase active site upon promoter melting for template directed RNA synthesis. However, to keep the complexed promoter open in the absence of the transcription reaction appears to be energetically unfavorable, as seen from the incomplete conversion of the closed to the open complex. Nevertheless, the observed rate of open complex formation (∼150 s−1) is not rate-limiting during transcription initiation. The bacteriophage RNA polymerases, such as the T7 RNA polymerase, are single subunit enzymes capable of catalyzing all the processes such as initiation, elongation, and termination of transcription. The structural simplicity and the template specificity of the phage RNA polymerases make them attractive for exploring the mechanism of transcription and for understanding transcription regulation at the level of protein-DNA interactions.

In this mechanism, the initial encounter of the T7 RNA polymerase with the DNA occurs at close to a diffusion-limited rate to form a closed complex EDc, which is in rapid equilibrium with free E and D. The EDc isomerizes at an observed rate close to 150 s−1 to form an open complex. It was interesting that the kinetics of the p-dsDNA promoter, which is premelted from −4 onward, showed a two-step DNA binding mechanism. The initial T7 RNA polymerase-p-dsDNA complex was formed similar to the dsDNA, but the subsequent isomerization step (∼ 300 s−1) was 2-fold faster in the p-dsDNA.Comparison of the fluorescence values of the p-dsDNA and dsDNA in the polymerase-DNA complex under conditions where the polymerase was in excess of the DNA suggested that only 29–36% of the complex dsDNA promoter was open. We therefore incorporated a third step after EDc formation in the dsDNA binding mechanism. The kinetic data at various polymerase concentrations were globally fit to the three-step mechanism, and the intrinsic rate constants are listed in Table I. The kinetic constants indicate that the EDccomplex resulting from the initial encounter of the T7 RNA polymerase with the dsDNA promoter has a Kd of 1.8 μm. This complex isomerizes to EDo1 with an unfavorable equilibrium constant of 0.12, and subsequently to EDo2 with a rate constant close to 322 s−1. A schematic representation of the promoter binding and open-complex formation steps is depicted in Fig.7. We postulate that, during the formation of EDc, the T7 RNA polymerase makes specific interactions with the conserved promoter recognition region from −17 to −5 sequence. The EDc complex then isomerizes to EDo1, in which the promoter is melted from −4 to −1, but the interactions of the template strand with the T7 RNA polymerase are not extensive to stabilize the complex. The EDo1 is therefore in equilibrium with the closed complex EDc. The EDo1 then isomerizes to EDo2, in which the template strand is directed within the active site of T7 RNA polymerase, making more extensive interactions, as seen in the recent crystal structure of the ED complex (1Cheetham G.M.T. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature.. 1999; 399: 80-83Google Scholar). The EDo2 is therefore a preinitiation complex, in which the template bases up to +2 are melted to pair with the incoming initiating GTPs for RNA synthesis. The three-step mechanism predicts an overall Kd for dsDNA equal to Kd1/(1"

These components are essential for dynein assembly and participate in specific motor-cargo interactions. To further address the role of these light chains in dynein activity, the structural and biochemical properties of several members of this polypeptide class were examined. Gel filtration chromatography and native gel electrophoresis indicate that recombinantChlamydomonas flagellar Tctex1 exists as a dimer in solution. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid analysis suggests that this association also occurs in vivo. In contrast, both murine and Chlamydomonas Tctex2 are monomeric. To investigate protein-protein interactions involving these light chains, outer arm dynein from Chlamydomonas flagella was cross-linked using dimethylpimelimidate. Immunoblot analysis of the resulting products revealed the interaction of LC2 (Tctex2) with LC6, which is closely related to the highly conserved LC8 protein found in many enzyme systems, including dynein. Northern dot blot analysis demonstrated that Tctex1/Tctex2 family light chains are differentially expressed both in a tissue-specific and developmentally regulated manner in humans. These data provide further support for the existence of functionally distinct populations of cytoplasmic dynein with differing light chain content.

These data provide further support for the existence of functionally distinct populations of cytoplasmic dynein with differing light chain content. Dyneins are molecular motors that translocate toward the minus-end of microtubules. These enzymes provide the motive force to power eukaryotic cilia and flagella and occur in the cytoplasm where they are involved in a wide variety of motile activities that are of fundamental importance to the cell. For these molecular motors to generate useful work, both microtubule motor and cargo-binding activities must be subject to precise temporal and spatial regulation. For flagellar dyneins, the ultimate cargo is another axonemal microtubule, and thus control for this process can be built directly into the flagellar- or ciliary-specific enzyme. The situation for cytoplasmic dynein is more complex, because there are many different cargoes that must be transported within a single cell. Indeed, the mechanisms by which individual cellular cargoes are attached to particular cytoplasmic dynein motors and whether this attachment is an integral property of specific enzyme subsets are of major importance for understanding motor-driven transport. In general, dyneins are constructed around ∼520 kDa heavy chains that consist of multiple AAA1(ATPases associated with cellularactivities) domains (see Ref. 1King S.M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2521-2526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for recent review). AAA proteins represent an ancient and diverse family of ATPases ranging from bacterial metal chelatases to eukaryotic microtubule-severing proteins. The dynein HCs exhibit both ATPase and microtubule motor activities. These proteins comprise the globular head and microtubule-binding stalk domains of the complex (2Gee M.A. Heuser J.E. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1997; 390: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 3Koonce M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19714-19718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition, the N-terminal ∼160 kDa of each HC forms a stem that interacts both with additional HCs and an intermediate chain/light chain complex to form the basal cargo-binding domain of the enzyme (4Sakakibara H. Takada S. King S.M. Witman G.B. Kamiya R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 5Witman G.B. King S.M. Moss A.G. Wilkerson C.G. Baccetti B.

Each IC consists of a C-terminal region comprised of multiple WD-repeats (a motif of ∼40 residues containing an invariant Trp-Asp dipeptide) and a gene-specific N-terminal region (8Mitchell D.R. Kang Y. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 835-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 9Wilkerson C.G. King S.M. Koutoulis A. Pazour G.J. Witman G.B. J.

Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1133-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In flagellar dyneins, the ICs show little homology with each other in the gene-specific regions and likely play very different roles in the function of this enzyme. For example, in the Chlamydomonas outer arm, IC1 (previously termed IC78) has been shown to interact with α-tubulin in situ (11King S.M. Wilkerson C.G. Witman G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8401-8407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This raised the possibility that ICs are responsible for direct cargo binding, although it is now clear that, at least in the flagellum, additional components are required to specify the precise attachment site (12Takada S. Kamiya R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In contrast, Chlamydomonas IC2 (previously IC69 or IC70) apparently mediates regulatory processes that impinge on motor function (13Mitchell D.R. Kang Y. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1069-1078PubMed Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic dynein has a single class of IC (IC74) that interacts directly with the dynactin activator of dynein-based vesicular transport (14Karki S. Holzbaur E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28806-28811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In mammals there are several IC74 genes, and evidence for both alternative splicing of IC74 transcripts and differential phosphorylation of the resulting proteins has been obtained (10Paschal B.M. Mikami A. Pfister K.K. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1133-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 15Pfister K.K. Salata M.W. Dillman 3rd, J.F. Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. Torre E. Lye R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1687-1694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The clear similarities between flagellar and cytoplasmic dyneins raised the possibility that the various IC74 isoforms bind specific intracellular cargoes. However, considering the large number of different proteins, organelles, and other complexes that must be transported at various times during the cell cycle, it does not seem reasonable that IC74 isoforms alone can provide sufficient specificity for cargo attachment. Cytoplasmic dynein contains two light intermediate chains that are phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner (16Niclas J. Allan V.J. Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). One of these polypeptides mediates the interaction of dynein with pericentrin (17Tynan S.H. Purohit A. Doxsey S.J. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32763-32768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, light intermediate chains also are involved in cargo-binding activities. Two general classes of LCs (<∼25 kDa) have been identified in dynein (18King S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 60-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The first comprises a diverse series of proteins that associate directly with individual HCs. These polypeptides are thought to be involved in the control of motor functions in response to various regulatory inputs. Thus far, they have been identified only in flagellar dyneins (see Ref. 18King S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 60-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar for review). The second LC class includes three distinct protein families (designated LC8, LC7/roadblock and Tctex1/Tctex2) that associate with the ICs at the base of the soluble dynein particle. Members of these protein families are found in both cytoplasmic and flagellar dyneins. The LC8 protein is highly conserved fromChlamydomonas to humans (19King S.M. Patel-King R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11445-11452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar); it is not dynein-specific and is found in many other multimeric enzymes such as neuronal nitric oxide synthase (20Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Science. 1996; 274: 774-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) and myosin V (21Espindola F.S. Suter D.M. Partata L.B.E. Cao T. Wolenski J.S. Cheney R.E. King S.M. Mooseker M.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskelet. 2000; 47: 269-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This protein exists as a dimer (22Benashski S.E. Harrison A. Patel-King R.S. King S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20929-20935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and exposes two identical surfaces that appear to bind a variety of proteins (23Liang J. Jaffrey S.R. Guo W. Snyder S.H. Clardy J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), including dynein ICs and specific cellular cargoes such as the proapoptotic factor Bim (24Puthalakath H. Huang D.C. O'Reilly L.A. King S.M. Strasser A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar) and Drosophila Swallow (25Schnorrer F. Bohmann K. Nusslein-Volhard C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In multicellular organisms, complete loss of LC8 function results in embryonic lethality (26Dick T. Ray K. Salz H.K. Chia W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1966-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, in Chlamydomonas, LC8-null mutants grow normally but are unable to make flagella due to disruption of intraflagellar transport (27Pazour G.J. Wilkerson C.G. Witman G.B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 979-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Multiple LC8 variants have been identified in a variety of organisms, includingDrosophila, schistosomes (28Yang W. Jones M.K. Fan J. Hughes-Stamm S.R. McManus D.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and mammals. InChlamydomonas, flagellar outer arm dynein contains both LC8 and a homologue (LC6) that share ∼40% sequence identity (19King S.M. Patel-King R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11445-11452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The second LC family (LC7/roadblock) is essential for both flagellar and cytoplasmic dynein function (29Bowman A.B. Patel-King R.S. Benashski S.E. McCaffery J.M. Goldstein L.S. King S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Although the precise role played by these proteins remains obscure, expression of at least one member of this class is down-regulated in response to light within rat visual cortex (30Ye F. Zangenehpour S. Chaudhuri A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27172-27176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Tctex1 and Tctex2 proteins were originally identified in mouse testis as candidates for involvement in the non-Mendelian transmission of variant forms of mouse chromosome 17 known as the thaplotypes (31Lader E. Ha H.S. O'Neill M. Artzt K. Bennett D. Cell. 1989; 58: 969-979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 32Huw L.Y. Goldsborough A.S. Willison K. Artzt K. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a Tctex2 homologue was found within the Chlamydomonas outer dynein arm (33Patel-King R.S. Benashski S.E. Harrison A. King S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1081-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and Tctex1 was identified in both cytoplasmic dynein and flagellar inner arm I1 (34King S.M. Dillman 3rd, J.F. Benashski S.E. Lye R.J. Patel-King R.S. Pfister K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32281-32287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar,35Harrison A. Olds-Clarke P. King S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1137-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Several independent studies have implicated Tctex1 in the attachment of specific cargoes to the dynein motor (36Tai A.W. Chuang J.Z. Bode C. Wolfrum U. Sung C.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 877-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 37Mou T. Kraas J.R. Fung E.T. Swope S.L. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 38Kai N. Mishina M. Yagi T. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 48: 407-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 39Nagano F. Orita S. Sasaki T. Naito A. Sakaguchi G. Maeda M. Watanabe T. Kominami E. Uchiyama Y. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30065-30068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For example, in the vertebrate photoreceptor Tctex1 binds directly to the C-terminal tail of rhodopsin whereas the related LC rp3 does not (36Tai A.W. Chuang J.Z. Bode C. Wolfrum U. Sung C.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 877-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Disruption of this interaction due to mutations in rhodopsin leads to retinitis pigmentosa, because rhodopsin-bearing vesicles can no longer be transported to the base of the connecting cilium for insertion into the membrane stacks. In humans, the Tctex1 gene maps at or close to the retinal cone dystrophy-1 locus (40Watanabe T.K. Fujiwara T. Shimizu F. Okuno S. Suzuki M. Takahashi E. Nakamura Y. Hirai Y. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1996; 73: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, several reports suggest that Tctex1 and its close homologue rp3 (41Roux A.-F. Rommens J. McDowell C. Anson-Cartwright L. Bell S. Schappert K. Fishman G.A. Musarella M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) are differentially expressed in fetal and adult brain (38Kai N. Mishina M. Yagi T. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 48: 407-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 41Roux A.-F. Rommens J. McDowell C. Anson-Cartwright L. Bell S. Schappert K. Fishman G.A. Musarella M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, regulation of cellular LC content might provide one mechanism to control dynein-cargo interactions. To further understand the role played by the Tctex1/Tctex2 family proteins in dynein function, we have investigated the properties of these LCs both in mammals and Chlamydomonas, because the two systems provide complementary information. In this report, we describe the identification of additional members of the Tctex1/Tctex2 LC family and detail an analysis of LC expression patterns in various human tissues during development. Using specific antibodies, we demonstrate that Tctex2, like Tctex1, is present in both flagellar and cytoplasmic dyneins. We also show that Tctex1, but not Tctex2, is dimeric in solution and furthermore, that members of this LC class interact directly with LC8 family proteins in the Chlamydomonas outer arm. Wild-typeChlamydomonas were deflagellated using dibucaine and isolated by standard methods (42Witman G.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 280-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Membranes were removed with 1% Nonidet P-40. Dynein was extracted from the resulting axonemes by treatment with 0.6 m NaCl. Subsequently, the αβ subparticle of the outer arm was purified by centrifugation through a 5–20% sucrose density gradient (43King S.M. Otter T. Witman G.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 291-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic dynein was obtained from rat brain, liver, kidney, spleen, and testis homogenates by immunoprecipitation using monoclonal antibody 74-1, which reacts specifically with IC74 (44Dillman 3rd, J.F. Pfister K.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1671-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). These samples were kindly provided by Drs. M. Salata and K. Pfister (University of Virginia). Protein·protein interactions within Chlamydomonas axonemes and purified dynein were detected by cross-linking with dimethylpimelimidate (DMP) (45Benashski S.E. King S.M. Methods. 2000; 22: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Samples were exchanged into 100 mm triethanolamine, pH 8.2, and treated with 0–10 mm DMP for 60 min at room temperature. The cross-linker was dissolved in methanol and added directly to the sample to achieve a final solvent concentration of 10% (v/v). Reactions were terminated by addition of gel sample buffer. The entire coding region for murine Tctex2 was cloned into the pMal-c2 vector, expressed as a C-terminal fusion with maltose-binding protein (MBP) and purified by amylose affinity chromatography. The LC and fusion partner were separated by digestion with Factor Xa. The entire fusion protein was used as the immunogen for preparation of rabbit polyclonal antibody R7714. The serum was blot-purified against the isolated LC (46Olmsted J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and the resulting antibody preparation was used at a dilution of 1/50 for immunoblot analysis. The ChlamydomonasLC6 fusion protein and corresponding rabbit antibody R4928 were prepared in a similar manner. Purification of rp3, Tctex1, andChlamydomonas LC2 fusion proteins and the preparation of antibodies R5205 and R5391 that recognize Tctex1 and LC2, respectively, have been described previously (33Patel-King R.S.

A dot blot arrayed with poly(A)+ RNA from 76 distinct human adult and fetal tissues was obtained from CLONTECH Laboratories Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). The blot was probed sequentially with cDNAs encoding human rp3 (specific activity = 2.7 × 108 cpm.μg−1), Tctex1 (1.0 × 108 cpm.μg−1), and Tctex2 (7.7 × 108 cpm.μg−1), and then with ESTs encoding two Tctex2 homologues derived from human glioblastoma (AI421187; 8.8 × 108 cpm.μg−1) and B-lymphocyte (AI492091; 4.2 × 107 cpm.μg−1) libraries. Denatured proteins were separated using 8 and 12.5% acrylamide slab gels and 5–15% acrylamide gradient gels containing SDS. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue or were blotted to nitrocellulose in 10 mm NaHCO3, 3 mm Na2CO3, 0.01% SDS, 20% methanol. Blots were probed with affinity-purified antibodies, and reactivity was assessed using a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and a chemiluminescent detection system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Native gel electrophoresis was used to determine the solution molecular weight of recombinant polypeptides (22Benashski S.E. Harrison A. Patel-King R.S. King S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20929-20935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 48Hedrick J.L. Smith A.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 126: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). Proteins were electrophoresed in gels of different acrylamide concentration and the negative slope of 100 (log [RF × 100]) used to determine the retardation coefficient (KR). Standard proteins used were jack bean urease (545-kDa hexamer and 272-kDa trimer), bovine serum albumin (132-kDa dimer and 66-kDa monomer), ovalbumin (45 kDa), bovine carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and α-lactalbumin (14.2 kDa). A plot of log KR versus log Mr for these proteins yielded a standard curve from which the native mass of the test samples was determined. The native molecular weight of recombinant Tctex1 also was assessed by gel filtration chromatography in 20 mm Tris.Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 150 mm KCl on a Superose 6 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a Bio-Rad Biologics chromatography workstation. Molecular mass standards used were: thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa). RecombinantChlamydomonas Tctex1 was prepared at 47.8 μm. The circular dichroism spectrum was measured in the far UV range between 190 and 280 nm using a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter. The signal at 222 nm was converted to mean residue ellipticity [θ]222 in mdeg.cm2.dmol−1using [θ]222 = 100 × CD signal/n(number of residues) × l (path length = 0.1 cm) × C ([protein] in mm). The approximate helical content of Tctex1 was determined using a value of [θ]222 = −32,600 mdeg.cm2.dmol−1 for a completely helical protein (49Chen Y.-H. Yang J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 44: 1285-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The full-length murine Tctex1 cDNA was cloned into the pAS2–1 vector resulting in the in-frame fusion of Tctex1 with the DNA-binding domain of the yeast GAL4 protein. A mouse brain cDNA library (9- to 12-week male BALB/c) containing 3.5 × 106 independent clones (CLONTECH Laboratories Inc.) was cloned into pACT2 to produce fusions between the encoded proteins and the DNA activation domain of GAL4. The yeast strain (Y190) used for the screening assay contained both HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes under control of a GAL4-responsive upstream activation site. Lack of autonomous activation by the Tctex1/DNA-binding domain fusion was demonstrated by plating cells transformed with the bait plasmid alone on media lacking histidine. For the assay, bait and library plasmids were transformed simultaneously into yeast and positive interactions initially identified by growth of His+ cells on media lacking histidine. Putative positives were then further tested by assaying colonies for β-galactosidase activity. Following confirmation of the specificity of the interaction, the Tctex1-binding partners were identified by sequence analysis. Members of the Tctex1/Tctex2 protein family were identified in the nonredundant and EST data bases at NCBI using BLAST. Multiple sequence alignment was prepared using CLUSTALW, and the output was processed using BOXSHADE. The phylogenetic analysis was performed using the Phylip suite of programs. Specifically, distances were calculated with PROTDIST and FITCH, and the unrooted tree was drawn using DRAWTREE. Secondary structure was predicted using PHD. Previously, we identified several dynein components belonging to the Tctex1/Tctex2 light chain family. These included Tctex1 (in cytoplasmic dynein and flagellar inner arm I1 (35Harrison A.

King S.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1081-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar)). Recent analysis of the nonredundant and EST data bases at NCBI using BLAST has allowed us to identify several additional members of this class of dynein component of both mammalian and nematode origin. A ClustalW sequence comparison of the currently identified members of this family is shown in Fig.1 a. These proteins share most identity in the C-terminal regions and have gene-specific N-terminal sections that show varying degrees of similarity with each other. The phylogenetic relationships within this class of polypeptide were calculated using the Phylip suite of programs and are shown in Fig.1 b. This analysis demonstrates that the Tctex1 and Tctex2 light chains define two major subgroups of this dynein LC class and reveals that Tctex2-related proteins derive from many sources other than testis, suggesting that they may not be flagella-specific. To further address the role played by these proteins in both flagellar and cytoplasmic dynein function, the structural and solution properties of the Tctex1/Tctex2 LC class were examined. A secondary structure analysis of Chlamydomonas Tctex1 using PHD (50Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2656) Google Scholar) indicates that the N-terminal half of the protein is likely formed from two α helices both of which are predicted with high reliability values. The C-terminal section of Tctex1 appears to consist of several β strands, although the prediction of the precise boundaries of these elements is significantly less reliable. 2The proposed arrangement of secondary structural elements within Tctex1 is also supported by NMR spectroscopic studies (H. Wu, M. W. Maciejewski, S. E. Benashski, G. P. Mullen, and S. M. King, (2001) J. Biomol. NMR, in press. To assess the general validity of this structure prediction, the circular dichroism spectrum of Tctex1 in the far UV was measured. The spectrum shows clear evidence for a mixture of helix and sheet structures as predicted by the program PHD. From the signal at 222 nm, the mean residue ellipticity [θ]222 was calculated. Assuming [θ]222 = −32,600 mdeg.cm2.dmol−1 for a completely helical protein (49Chen Y.-H. Yang J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 44: 1285-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), 25.6% of residues within Tctex1 are in a helical conformation. This value agrees very well with the secondary structure prediction of 29.8%. Following denaturing electrophoresis, most recombinant Tctex1 migrates withMr = 13,000, which is completely consistent with the calculated molecular mass of 12,805 Da (includes a single additional N-terminal His residue) (Fig.2, right inset). However, an extra band at Mr ∼ 27,000 also is evident. This band is recognized by antibody R5205 and therefore likely represents a Tctex1 dimer. To test whether native Tctex1 is indeed dimeric, the solution molecular weight of the recombinant protein was determined by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 2). The major Tctex1 peak has a mass of ∼31.5 kDa, strongly suggesting that this protein is dimeric in solution. No peak corresponding to the Tctex1 monomer was observed under native conditions even at high dilution, suggesting a very high affinity between monomers. To confirm that Tctex1 is dimeric, the molecular mass was also determined by native gel electrophoresis using the method of Hedrick and Smith (22Benashski S.E. Harrison A. Patel-King R.S. King S.M.

Biophys. 1968; 126: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). This analysis yielded an estimate of 22 kDa, supporting the dimeric nature of this protein (TableI). To assess whether other members of this protein family exist as oligomers, the solution molecular weight of MBP/Tctex2 and MBP/LC2 fusion proteins also were determined (TableI). The native molecular weight of the control protein MBP/lacZ was very close to the calculated value, indicating that MBP itself does not dimerize (see also Ref. 22Benashski S.E. Harrison A.

The overall goal of this screen was to identify potential dynein-cargo interactions mediated by Tctex1. A number of novel interactions between Tctex1 and other proteins were identified. Intriguingly, ∼10% of the confirmed clones recovered from the screen were found to encode Tctex1 itself, suggesting that the Tctex1-Tctex1 interaction can occur in vivo.

In contrast, inhibition of the 12/15-LO activity, or utilization of genetically engineered macrophages in which the 12/15-LO gene has been disrupted, greatly reduced actin polymerization in phagocytosing macrophages. Lysates of 12/15-LO-deficient macrophages had significantly lower ability to promote in vitro actin polymerization than the lysates of wild type macrophages.

The exact role of these enzymes in biological processes has remained elusive, but increasingly evidence has accumulated that they play important roles in specific cellular functions. For example, 15-LO activity in reticulocytes at the stage of organelle degradation may contribute to membrane destabilization and contribute to pore formation in intracellular membranes (1Kühn H. Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1454-1458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2van Leyen K. Duvoisin R.M. Engelhardt H. Wiedmann M. Nature. 1998; 395: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Fatty acid products of 12/15-LO are powerful agonists for the nuclear receptor PPAR-γ, which helps regulate glucose metabolism and adipocyte and macrophage differentiation and function (3Huang J.T. Welch J.S. Ricote M. Binder C.J. Willson T.M. Kelly C. Witztum J.L. Funk C.D. Conrad D. Glass C.K. Nature. 1999; 400: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). A remarkable feature of 12/15-LO is that its expression is not constant during the cell life span but rather turns on at certain points during cell development. While circulating human monocytes do not express 15-LO, monocyte-derived macrophages exposed to interleukin-4 or interleukin-13 express 15-LO (4Conrad D.J. Kühn H. Mulkins M. Highland E. Sigal E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 5Nassar G.M. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J. Lakkis F.G. Badr K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27631-27634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, mouse macrophages residing for a long time in the peritoneum (resident macrophages) also highly express the mouse homologue, 12/15-LO, although the pathway leading to 12/15-LO expression may differ somewhat from that which occurs with human monocytes (6Sendobry S.M. Cornicelli J.A. Welch K. Grusby M.J. Daugherty A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1477-1482PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophages of atherosclerotic lesions express high levels of 15-LO (7Ylä-Herttuala S. Rosenfeld M.E. Parthasarathy S. Glass C.K. Sigal E. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6959-6963Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), and recent evidence utilizing apoE−/−mice in which the 12/15-LO gene was disrupted demonstrated its importance in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (8Cyrus T. Witztum J.L. Rader D.J. Tangirala R. Fazio S. Linton M.F. Funk C.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1597-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Another characteristic of atherosclerotic tissue but not of normal vascular wall is the high abundance of apoptotic cells (9Kockx M.M. Herman A.G. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 45: 736-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). This fact might reflect either an increased rate of formation of such cells, a decreased rate of clearance, for example by arterial macrophages, or both. In either case, phagocytosis and the degradation and metabolism of the ingested contents of dying cells are crucial for preventing the release of toxic cellular compounds and consequent inflammation. Inhibition of efficient phagocytosis would presumably lead to the accumulation of pro-inflammatory necrotic debris, plaque instability, and thrombogenesis. During the complex process of phagocytosis, major changes in the cytoskeleton of the cell occur leading to the formation of filopodia surrounding an apoptotic cell or a microorganism to be engulfed. Changes in actin polymerization play a vital role in this process. Remarkably, 12-LO products are found in many tumor cells and have been suggested to have effects on actin polymerization (10Rice R.L. Tang D.G. Haddad M. Honn K.V. Taylor J.D. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and cytoskeleton reorganization during cell transformation (10Rice R.L. Tang D.G. Haddad M. Honn K.V. Taylor J.D. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 11Tang D.G. Honn K.V. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 400: 349-361Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was tempting to propose that the activity of 12/15-LO in non-malignant cells, such as macrophages, was also related to a cytoskeleton function and to phagocytosis. Indeed, we now demonstrate that upon exposure to apoptotic cells, 12/15-LO translocates from the cytosol to sites of apoptotic cell binding and furthermore that actin polymerization itself is dependent on activity of 12/15-LO. Peritoneal macrophages were harvested from 8- to 10-week-old female mice, either Swiss Webster or C57BL/6 strains. The latter were strain-, age-, and sex-matched to 12/15-LO knockout mice. Resident or thioglycollate-elicited macrophages were plated in RPMI 1640 (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Omega Scientific). Murine fibroblast cell lines overexpressing either human 15-LO (clone 12) or β-galactosidase (LacZ) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker) with 10% FBS and 0.2 mg/ml G418 (Calbiochem) to maintain selection (12Benz D.J. Mol M. Ezaki M. Mori-Ito N. Zelaan I. Miyanohara A. Friedmann T. Parthasarathy S. Steinberg D. Witztum J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5191-5197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Thymocytes were harvested from the thymuses of 4-week-old mice of the same strain as used for macrophage isolation and treated with 1 μm dexamethasone in 10% FBS/RPMI 1640 for 4 h to induce apoptosis (13Chang M.K. Bergmark C. Laurila A. Hörkkö S. Han K.H. Friedman P. Dennis E.A. Witztum J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6353-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The appearance of condensed nuclei was a marker for apoptosis. We previously demonstrated that concentrations up to 20 μm of the specific lipoxygenase inhibitor PD 146176 (a gift from J. Cornicelli of Parke-Davis) were non-toxic for macrophages (14Scheidegger K.J. Butler S. Witztum J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21609-21615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Cytochalasin D was from Sigma, and latrunculin A was from Molecular Probes. 13(S)-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid (13(S)-HODE), 15(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15(S)-HETE), 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12(S)-HETE), and linoleic acid were from Cayman Chemical. Cells were lysed on the plate with 5% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline. Protein content was determined with a BCA kit (Pierce), and 15–100 μg of the cell lysate was run on a pre-cast 4–12% gradient polyacrylamide gel (Novex) and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore). The membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat milk and incubated with a protein A-purified polyclonal guinea pig anti-rabbit 15-LO antibody (7Ylä-Herttuala S. Rosenfeld M.E. Parthasarathy S. Glass C.K. Sigal E. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6959-6963Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). This antibody cross-reacts not only with human 15-LO (7Ylä-Herttuala S. Rosenfeld M.E. Parthasarathy S. Glass C.K. Sigal E. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6959-6963Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) but also with mouse 12/15-LO; it stained the band of 75 kDa, typical for 12/15-LO. It did not yield any such band when lysates from 12/15-LO−/− mice were used. Guinea pig preimmune IgG produced no specific staining. Macrophages plated overnight on coverslips were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min, blocked with 0.8 μg/ml Fc block (PharMingen) in 5% non-fat milk, 0.2% Triton X-100, stained for 30 min with the guinea pig anti-rabbit 15-LO antibody and for another 30 min with a rhodamine red-X-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment donkey anti-guinea pig Ig G (H+L) antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Alternatively, a guinea pig anti-rabbit ApoA1 antibody was used as a negative control. Filamentous actin (F-actin) was stained by addition of 1.5 μm FITC-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) to the solution of the secondary antibody. Cytosol was labeled by incubation of live cells with 0.5 μm, 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate (CellTracker green CMFDA from Molecular Probes) in serum-free medium for 30 min followed by a 30-min incubation in the regular culture medium. This green staining remained in fixed cells. Cell nuclei were stained blue with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) for 15 min. The coverslips were mounted on microscopic glass slides with ProLong antifade medium (Molecular Probes). Images were captured by deconvolution microscopy (15Agard D.A. Hiraoka Y. Shaw P. Sedat J.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 30: 353-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) using a DeltaVision deconvolution microscopic system operated by SoftWorx software (Applied Precision). Pixel intensities were kept in the linear response range of the digital camera. Optical sections through the samples were taken with increments of 0.2–0.5 μm depending on magnification. The images were deconvolved and examined either section by section or volume views were generated by combining areas of maximal intensity of each optical section with SoftWorx programs. Data Inspector application was used to quantitatively analyze the images. Adobe Photoshop 6.0 software was used to design figures. The relative content of F-actin in macrophages activated by addition of apoptotic thymocytes was assessed by flow cytometry as described in Ref. 16Howard T.H. Meyer W.H. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1265-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar with some modification. In brief, at the end of incubation of the plated macrophages with apoptotic thymocytes, 1 volume of the solution containing 1.6 μm FITC-phalloidin, 18% paraformaldehyde, and 0.8% saponin (all from Sigma) was added to 3 volumes of the culture medium and incubated for an additional 10 min. Cells were then washed, scraped from the plate, filtered through a Nitex nylon mesh (Sefar America), and analyzed on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). To examine the expression of cell-specific CD markers, the cells attached to the plate were gently scraped, incubated in suspension for 30 min with either a FITC-conjugated anti-CD80 antibody, a FITC-conjugated anti-CD3 antibody, or a phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD19 antibody (all from PharMingen), washed, and analyzed on the FACScan. Assays were performed as described previously (17Higgs H.N. Blanchoin L. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15212-15222Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). This assay is based on the measurement of fluorescence intensity of pyrene covalently linked to actin, which increases when actin polymerizes. In brief, unlabeled and pyrene-labeled monomeric G-actin from rabbit muscle (kindly provided by K. Aman from the Salk Institute) at the ratio of 95:5 were diluted in G-buffer (2 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.1 mmCaCl2, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and then converted to Mg-actin by adding 0.1 volume of 10 mm EGTA and 1 mm MgCl2. Polymerization was initiated by addition of either macrophage lysates or 0.1 volume of 10× KMEI (500 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, and 100 mm imidazole, pH 7.0). Lysates were prepared from macrophages scraped from the plate in a lysis buffer (2 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitors mixture (Sigma)) by sonication and centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 30 min. Protein concentration was measured using a BCA kit from Pierce. Spectra and time courses of pyrene fluorescence were measured on an LS50B luminescence spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). When non-septic inflammation in mice is induced by intraperitoneal injection of thioglycollate, many monocytes are recruited into the peritoneum, where they differentiate into macrophages. Initially, these newly recruited, “elicited” macrophages express very little 12/15-LO. This was evident from Western blots of cell lysates made from elicited and resident macrophages. Relative to total cell protein, there was 10–15-fold less 12/15-LO expressed in the elicited macrophages as compared with the enzyme content in resident macrophages (data not shown). Immunocytochemical examination of the elicited macrophage population revealed two cell populations, either positive or negative for 12/15-LO staining (Fig.1 a). The 12/15-LO-positive cells (less than 10% of total) presumably originated from resident macrophages. The 12/15-LO-negative cells were probably newly recruited monocyte-macrophages that did not yet express the enzyme. This observation is in agreement with an earlier report on heterogeneity of elicited macrophages from immunodeficient mice (6Sendobry S.M. Cornicelli J.A. Welch K. Grusby M.J. Daugherty A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1477-1482PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure that the thioglycollate-elicited cells that attached to the plate overnight were indeed macrophages and not other cell types, these cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for the presence of cell-specific markers. Ninety eight percent of the attached cells were positive for the macrophage marker CD80 and negative for the T-cell marker CD3 and the B-cell marker CD19. (Splenocytes, a mixed population of all the three cell types, were used as positive controls.) Thus, the majority of the plate-attached cells harvested from peritoneum were macrophages, and the difference in the 12/15-LO expression is probably a function of the stage of macrophage differentiation. When apoptotic thymocytes were incubated with the elicited macrophage population, we noted a striking difference between 12/15-LO-positive and -negative cells in the ability to bind and engulf apoptotic thymocytes (Fig. 1 a). Counting multiple microscopic fields confirmed that following a 15-min incubation, the 12/15-LO-expressing macrophages bound 20 times more apoptotic cells than the 12/15-LO-negative cells (cross-hatched columns in Fig.1 b). This ability of the 12/15-LO-positive cells to bind apoptotic cells was significantly reduced when the elicited macrophages were pretreated with the specific 12/15-LO inhibitor PD 146176 (18Sendobry S.M. Cornicelli J.A. Welch K. Bocan T. Tait B. Trivedi B.K. Colbry N. Dyer R.D. Feinmark S.J. Daugherty A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 1199-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The effect of PD 146176 was dose-dependent. A statistically significant decrease in apoptotic cells binding to 12/15-LO-positive elicited macrophages was observed already at 0.5 μm PD 146176. This result corresponds well to the previously reported IC50 values of 0.8 μm for the PD 146176 inhibition of 15-LO activity in cell culture (19Bocan T.M. Rosebury W.S. Mueller S.B. Kuchera S. Welch K. Daugherty A. Cornicelli J.A. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 136: 203-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Following a 1-h incubation, when most of the apoptotic thymocytes were already engulfed by the macrophages, the same tendency was observed (black columns in Fig. 1 b). The correlation between the phagocytic function of elicited macrophages and the 12/15-LO activity suggests a role for 12/15-LO in phagocytosis. To explore further a potential relationship of 12/15-LO to phagocytosis, we examined the localization of 12/15-LO and F-actin in resident macrophages, resting or phagocytosing apoptotic thymocytes. Nearly all (more than 95%) resident macrophages expressed 12/15-LO. In resident macrophages not exposed to apoptotic cells (Fig.2 a, a volume view, Fig.2 b, a 2-fold magnified optical section), 12/15-LO protein (red) was evenly distributed throughout the cytosol and did not colocalize with F-actin (green) at the cell surface. The three-dimensional intensity graphs below Fig. 2 b document the very different distributions of 12/15-LO and F-actin in the highlighted area. In contrast, in resident macrophages exposed to apoptotic thymocytes, 12/15-LO concentrated on the cell surfaces in general, and this was greatly enhanced at the sites where apoptotic cells were bound (Fig. 2, c and d). To show that the translocation of 12/15-LO toward the bound apoptotic cell at the periphery of the macrophage was specific and not just following general movement of cytosol, we labeled cytosol green with CellTracker, a dye that evenly binds to thiol groups in the cell (20Poot M. Kavanagh T.J. Kang H.C. Haugland R.P. Rabinovitch P.S. Cytometry. 1991; 12: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The presence of 12/15-LO on the cell surface (red color) close to attached apoptotic thymocytes but the absence of the yellow color (that would have represented colocalization with CellTracker) suggest the specificity of the 12/15-LO translocation (Fig. 2, c andd). Accordingly, the intensity graphs below Fig.2 d show a different distribution of 12/15-LO and CellTracker in the highlighted area. Fig. 3 presents another example in which a resident macrophage is in close or partial contact with four different apoptotic cells simultaneously. Fig. 3 bdemonstrates staining for 12/15-LO (red) and Fig.3 c staining for F-actin (green). Fig.3 a is a merged view where the yellow color demonstrates 12/15-LO colocalization with the sites of actin polymerization. The yellow color is clearly more heavily concentrated in the vicinity of bound apoptotic cells. Quantification of the effect is provided by intensity maps of the whole cell (derived from the volume view) for each color. In general, the concentrations of 12/15-LO and F-actin on the surface of macrophages phagocytosing apoptotic cells were 3–6-fold higher than in resting macrophages (compare intensity scales in Figs. 2 and 3). This supports the generalized movement of both to the cell periphery. However, the intensity graph for 12/15-LO (below Fig. 3 b) also demonstrates increased 12/15-LO concentration at the sites of apoptotic cell binding, as compared with either cytosol or even other sites of the periphery of the cell. Specific 12/15-LO intensity in the areas of cell-cell contact was 3.11 ± 0.54/voxel as compared with 1.49 ± 0.73/voxel in all the rest of the cell perimeter (p < 0.001). The intensity maps derived from the highlighted area of a specific focal plane (below Fig. 3,e and f) show nearly identical patterns of 12/15-LO and F-actin distribution in the area of contact with an apoptotic cell, confirming their specific colocalization. We next examined the relationship between activity of 12/15-LO and F-actin function. To approach this question, we inhibited either the activity of 12/15-LO or the process of actin polymerization. Formation of F-actin was inhibited by treating macrophages with either cytochalasin D or latrunculin A, toxins that bind monomeric G-actin, thereby preventing formation of filamentous F-actin (21DeFife K.M. Jenney C.R. Colton E. Anderson J.M. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Couae M. Brenner S.L. Spector I. Korn E.D. FEBS Lett. 1987; 213: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). The images in Fig. 4, a–c show a non-treated resident macrophage caught in the process of phagocytosis of an apoptotic thymocyte. 12/15-LO has translocated to the surface where it appears to be interacting with the apoptotic cell. This same site has also been greatly enriched by F-actin (seeblack-white images in b and c, and intensity graphs below). Again, although there is clear translocation of the 12/15-LO to the periphery of the cell, a formal analysis of the intensity maps shows 12/15-LO-specific intensity of 5.40 ± 0.73/voxel at the site of apoptotic cell binding versus2.40 ± 1.16/voxel in the rest of cell perimeter (p < 0.001) providing additional evidence that 12/15-LO translocation is concentrated at sites of contact with apoptotic cells. The cytochalasin D treatment partially disrupted the actin polymerization (Fig. 4, d and f). Nevertheless, 12/15-LO translocation toward the bound apoptotic thymocyte did not seem to be impaired (Fig. 4, d and e). Latrunculin A treatment almost completely disrupted F-actin formation (Fig. 4, g and i), and even under these severe conditions 12/15-LO translocation to sites of apoptotic cell binding occurred (Fig. 4, g and h). These data suggest that actin polymerization is not a prerequisite for 12/15-LO translocation. Can 12/15-LO activity in turn affect the process of actin polymerization? In order to assess the level of polymerized actin in individual cells, we used a flow cytometry assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A shift of the cell distribution histogram to the area of higher fluorescence intensity (e.g.to the right) reflects an increase in the level of F-actin. Such a shift was observed in resident macrophages in response to incubation with apoptotic thymocytes (Fig. 5,a and c). It was not due to the F-actin of internalized apoptotic thymocytes because the latter did not show any F-actin signal by flow cytometry (green histograms barely seen in left bottom corners of Fig. 5, a andc), and no F-actin staining was observed microscopically in the apoptotic cells (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). The F-actin response usually reached its peak in 10–20 min and then disappeared 40–60 min after the start of incubation (data not shown). Macrophages harvested from Swiss Webster mice (Fig. 5 a) generally responded with a higher level of polymerized actin than macrophages from C57BL/6 mice (compare Fig. 5, a versus c). Treatment of the resident macrophages with the 12/15-LO inhibitor PD 146176 prior to addition of the apoptotic cells blocked actin polymerization in the macrophages (Fig. 5 b). Finally, in macrophages harvested from 12/15-LO knockout mice (12/15-LO−/−), no change in the F-actin content in response to addition of apoptotic cells was observed (Fig. 5 d). The next set of experiments directly examined the effect of the products of 12/15-LO on actin polymerization, using an in vitro polymerization assay in the presence or absence of cell lysates. In the first set of experiments, actin polymerization was initiated by addition of cell lysates (Fig. 6 a). Whole cell lysates prepared from the 12/15-LO knockout macrophages had a limited ability to promote in vitro polymerization of G-actin (Fig.6 a, dotted line). In contrast, lysates from wild type macrophage had much higher nucleating and elongating activities as seen by a shorter lag phase before the start of elongation and an increased rate of elongation (a 130 ± 27% increase, p < 0.001; Fig. 6 a, solid line). Remarkably, addition of 13(S)-HODE (the oxidation product of linoleic acid) to the 12/15-LO−/− lysates significantly increased the elongation rate but did not affect the lag phase, indicating that 13(S)-HODE does not have a nucleating activity (Fig.6 a, dashed line). The same positive effect of 13(S)-HODE on actin elongation but not nucleation was also observed in an in vitro assay conducted in the absence of cell lysates, when actin polymerization was initiated by addition of KMEI instead of cell lysate (a 50 ± 18% increase,p < 0.01; Fig. 6 b, solid line). Preincubation of G-actin with non-oxidized linoleic did not show any sizable difference from the ethanol vehicle (Fig. 6 b, dashedand dotted lines). Because light scattering from cell lysates could have interfered with fluorescence measurements, emission spectra were recorded at the beginning and the end of the time courses. A multipeak analysis of a difference spectrum (Fig. 6 a, inset) shows a peak of 405.5 nm, which is fairly close to the peak of pyrene emission (406.8 nm) from F-actin in lysate-free samples (Fig.6 b, inset). Similar results were also observed in experiments with the products of 12/15-LO oxidation of arachidonic acid, 15(S)-HETE and 12(S)-HETE, although the effects were not as pronounced (data not shown). To determine if the relationship between LO activity and F-actin formation could also be observed in another cell type, we also examined spreading of fibroblasts, another function dependent on actin polymerization. For these studies we used murine cell lines stably overexpressing either human 15-LO (clone 12) or β-galactosidase (LacZ, control cells) (12Benz D.J. Mol M. Ezaki M. Mori-Ito N. Zelaan I.

Plated clone 12 cells spread much faster than LacZ cells, and the presence of the 15-LO inhibitor PD 146176 in the medium delayed spreading of the clone 12 cells (Fig.7). These observations complement the hypothesis that 12/15-LO stimulates actin polymerization and that the functions of 12/15-LO may be more pleiotropic than only assisting macrophage phagocytic function. Many lines of evidence suggest an important role for 15-LO (and its 12/15-LO homologue in mice) in atherogenesis (7Ylä-Herttuala S. Rosenfeld M.E. Parthasarathy S. Glass C.K. Sigal E. Witztum J.L.

Analysis of regulatory regions in the promoter of the ctr4 + copper transporter gene in fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe reveals the identity of a conserved copper-signalingelement (CuSE), which is recognized by the transcription factor Cuf1. We demonstrate that CuSE is necessary for transcriptional activation in response to copper deprivation conditions. Interestingly, the CuSE element bears a strong sequence similarity to the recognition site, denoted MRE (metal regulatory element), which is recognized by a distinct class of copper sensors required for copper detoxification, including Ace1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Amt1 fromCandida glabrata. When a consensus MRE from S. cerevisiae is introduced into S. pombe, transcription is induced by copper deprivation in a Cuf1-dependent manner, similar to regulation by Mac1, the nuclear sensor for regulating the expression of genes encoding components involved in copper transport in S. cerevisiae. UV-cross-linking experiments show that the Cuf1 protein directly binds the CuSE. These results demonstrate that the Cuf1 nutritional copper-sensing factor possesses a module that functions similarly to domains found in the Ace1/Amt1 class of metalloregulatory factors, which allows the protein to act through a closely related MRE-like sequence to regulate copper transport gene expression in S. pombe.

Increased synthesis of these three proteins in response to copper is controlled at the transcriptional level by the Ace1 copper metalloregulatory transcription factor (MRTF)1 (13Thiele D.J. Mol.

Furthermore, the promoter element necessary for copper-inducible transcription of CUP1, CRS5, and SOD1is denoted metal regulatory element (MRE) and is defined by the consensus sequence, 5′-HTHNNGCTGD-3′ (D = A, G, or T; H = A, C, or T; N = any residue). The GCTG region is termed the core sequence, whereas the region 5′ to the core is known as the T-rich element (16Koch K.A. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell.

The core sequence of the MRE is recognized by Ace1 in the major groove, whereas the AT-rich 5′ region is contacted in the minor groove (16Koch K.A. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell.

The first subdomain (residues 1–40) (denoted Zn2+ module) of the DNA binding domain of Ace1 was found to bind a single Zn2+ atom (18Farrell R.A. Thorvaldsen J.L. Winge D.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1571-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The second subdomain of the DNA binding domain (residues 41–110), named copper-regulatory domain (17Winge D.R. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 165-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), harbors 9 Cys residues found as follows: one Cys-X2-Cys motif, three Cys-X-Cys motifs, and a single Cys residue. All of these Cys residues are necessary for copper response, except for the last, Cys105 (17Winge D.R. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 58: 165-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The arrangement of the Cys residues is predicted to coordinate four Cu1+ atoms through cysteine sulfur bonds (19Graden J.A. Posewitz M.C. Simon J.R. George G.N. Pickering I.J. Winge D.R.

Upon copper activation, it appears that the formation of a tetra-copper cluster within the copper regulatory domain via cysteinyl thiolates is critical to make an active detoxifying factor, thereby making the cupro-Ace1 able to interact to MREs in a copper and conformational changes-dependent manner (11Koch K.A.

A hallmark of these genes is the fact that they are transcriptionally expressed according to copper need; the transcription of FRE1, CTR1, andCTR3 is up-regulated under copper starvation conditions. This process is under the control of Mac1, another copper-sensing transcription factor harboring homology with the amino-terminal 40 amino acids found in the Ace1/Amt1 copper-activated metalloregulatory proteins but little homology outside of this region (30Jungmann J.

Therefore, both the Ctr4 copper transporter and the Cuf1 nuclear copper-sensing transcription factor are essential for fission yeast cells to use copper ions from the environment. Although the Cuf1 protein is required for S. pombe high affinity copper transport, Cuf1 displays at its amino terminus an extended homology (amino acid residues 1–61) to the amino-terminal 63 and 62 amino acids of the S. cerevisiae Ace1 and C. glabrata Amt1 class of transcription factors and much less similarity to Mac1, its functional ortholog (46Labbé S.

Cuf1 possesses a cysteine-rich domain at its carboxyl terminus containing five Cys and one His residue that is absent in Ace1/Amt1 but found duplicated in both Mac1 and Grisea ofPodospora anserina (43Borghouts C. Osiewacz H.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 260: 492-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 46Labbé S. Peña M.M.O. Fernandes A.R. Thiele D.J. J. Biol.

With respect to copper detoxification in S. pombe, the only known molecules for sequestering excess of copper ions are the phytochelatins, since the fission yeast lacks metallothioneins (42Perego P. Jimenez G. Howell S.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1080-1086PubMed Google Scholar). No precise molecular mechanism of how copper sequestration is regulated in S. pombe has yet been identified. In this study, we identify a cis-acting element found upstream of the copper transport genes in S. pombe termedcopper-signaling element (CuSE) that is necessary for activation in response to copper deprivation conditions. The CuSE sequence bears a strong sequence similarity to the MRE for the Ace1 and Amt1 copper metalloregulatory detoxifying transcription factors from the bakers' yeast (S. cerevisiae) and the yeast C. glabrata. When MREs fromS. cerevisiae are expressed in the fission yeast S. pombe, transcriptional regulation occurs in the opposite direction from that observed for the S. cerevisiae CUP1,SOD1, and CRS5 genes, which are activated in an MRE-dependent manner in response to copper. Moreover, the transcriptional copper starvation-mediated activation that is observed when MREs of S. cerevisiae are introduced in S. pombe depends on Cuf1. UV-cross-linking experiments using extracts derived from a heterologous system expressing a functionalcuf1 + gene reveal that the Cuf1 protein binds the CuSE element. Taken together, these results show that the S. pombe Cuf1 nutritional copper-sensing factor acts through a closely related MRE-like element to regulate expression of fission yeast genes encoding components of the high affinity copper transport machinery. The S. pombestrains used in this study were the wild-type FY254 (h − can1–1 leu1–32 ade6-M210 ura4-D18), the cuf1Δ disruption strain (h − can1–1 leu1–32 ade6-M210 ura4-D18 cuf1Δ::ura4 +), and thectr4Δ disruption strain (h − can1–1 leu1–32 ade6-M210 ura4-D18 ctr4Δ::ura4 +), which are described elsewhere in detail (46Labbé S. Peña M.M.O. Fernandes A.R. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36252-36260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). For ectopic expression of thecuf1 + gene in S. cerevisiae, theace1Δ strain, denoted DTY59 (MATα his6 leu2–3,-112 ura3–52 ace1-Δ225 CUP1R-3) (47Butler G. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 476-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), was utilized to ensure the presence of Cuf1 as sole protein with the ability of interacting with MREs. Under nonselective conditions,S. pombe cells were grown in yeast extract plus supplements (225 mg/liter adenine, histidine, leucine, uracil, and lysine). When plasmid maintenance was required, Edinburgh minimal medium was used as selective medium (48Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. McLeod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeasts: Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 1-186Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae strains were grown either in yeast extract/peptone/dextrose medium or in the appropriate drop-out synthetic media (49Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchell A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 1-234Google Scholar). To assess the role of Cuf1 in S. cerevisiae, the cells were grown in a modified minimal medium containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base minus copper and iron, 2% dextrose, 50 mm MES buffer (pH 6.1), and 10 μm NH4Fe(SO4)2 as described previously (32Labbé S. Zhu Z. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15951-15958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The plasmid pSP1ctr4 +-737 carries a 1607-bpXhoI-BamHI PCR-amplified fragment, which harbors the ctr4 + promoter region up to −737 from the start codon of the ctr4 + gene in addition to the gene itself. This pSP1 (52Cottarel G. Beach D. Deuschle U. Curr. Genet. 1993; 23: 547-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) derivative was digested withBamHI (accessible end) and SacI (protected end) to perform unidirectional nested 5′ deletions of thectr4 + promoter. The plasmid pSKctr4 + 213 containing nucleotides from position −737 to position −524 with respect to the A of the ATG codon of the ctr4 + ORF was created to introduce mutations in the CuSEs by site-directed mutagenesis. Precisely, the oligonucleotides 5′-−571CTGTCCCTAAAATTCATTCTCTTATCATGCACTAATACCTCGATTG−616-3′ and 5′-−702CAGTCGGAATCTCATATCCCAAACAGTGACATTTCC−737-3′ (letters that are underlined represent multiple point mutations in the CuSEs) were used either together or separately in conjunction with pSKctr4 + 213 and the Chameleon mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, CA). The DNA sequence for each mutant was confirmed by sequencing and then used to replace the equivalent fragment from either pSP1ctr4 +-737 or pCF83ctr4 +-CYC1-lacZ. This latter plasmid consists of the ctr4 + promoter region (position −737 to position −524) within which lie all three CuSEs (positions −721 to −712; positions −603 to −594; positions −592 to −583) followed by the minimal promoter of the CYC1gene fused to lacZ. To assess the ability of the CuSEs to regulate a heterologous reporter gene in a copper-dependent fashion, two versions of the ctr4 + promoter were tested, one containing 213 bp (positions −737 to −524) and the other harboring a shorter segment of 175 bp (positions −737 to −562). Both regions were PCR-amplified and inserted in their natural orientation into the SmaI and XhoI sites of aCYC1-lacZ fusion plasmid pCF83 (46Labbé S. Peña M.M.O. Fernandes A.R. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36252-36260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A similar approach was also used to create both the wild type and mutant pCF83ctr5 +-CYC1-lacZfusions. Furthermore, a DNA segment (positions −292 to −163) encompassing four MREs from the S. cerevisiae CUP1regulatory region was also amplified by PCR to obtain both wild type and MRE mutant elements. Both types of fragments were inserted into pCFLEU2 using the SmaI and XhoI sites. Plasmid pCFLEU2 was constructed by insertion of theHindIII LEU2 fragment isolated from pINV1-spc1 +-HA6His (50Iacovoni J.S. Rusell P. Gaits F. Gene. 1999; 232: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) into theHindIII sites of pCF83 (46Labbé S. Peña M.M.O. Fernandes A.R. Thiele D.J. J. Biol.

To conduct the RNase protection analyses as described previously (16Koch K.A. Thiele D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 724-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), three plasmids, denoted pSKctr4 +, pSKact1 + (46Labbé S. Peña M.M.O. Fernandes A.R. Thiele D.J. J. Biol.

Both the low and high copy plasmid versions of URA3-based GPDcuf1+ FLAG2 were created using two oligonucleotides, FLAG2up (5′-GGCCGAGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAAGGCGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAAGAC-3′) and FLAG2low (5′-GGCCGTCTTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGCCTTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCTC-3′), encoding two copies of the FLAG epitope. These purified oligonucleotides were annealed pairwise to form double-stranded DNA with EagI overhangs and then ligated into theNotI site of pSKcuf1 + NotI in which a NotI restriction site was previously engineered by PCR and placed in-frame just before the stop codon of thecuf1 + gene (46Labbé S. Peña M.M.O. Fernandes A.R. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36252-36260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Subsequently, thecuf1 + FLAG2 was isolated from this pSK derivative with EcoRI and BamHI and then cloned into the pGEM-7Zf(+) vector (Promega, WI). To release thecuf1 + FLAG2 gene from this pGEM derivative, both XbaI and BamHI were used, allowing unidirectional gene insertion into the SpeI (which produces compatible ends to that of XbaI) andBamHI sites of the p416GPD/p426GPDvector for ectopic expression in S. cerevisiae cells (51Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Gene. 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis, S. cerevisiae DTY59 cells were transformed with p416GPD (as control) and p416GPDcuf1 + FLAG2. Yeast cells were grown to A600 = 1.1 either with or without 10 μm copper chelator BCS and with or without 100 μm CuSO4. Total cell lysates were prepared by glass bead disruption in lysis buffer (20 mmHEPES (pH 7.9), 10% glycerol, 75 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin). The cells were lysed by vortexing for 1 min at top speed 5 times with 1–2-min intervals on ice. After centrifugation for 6 min at 4,800 rpm, the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by the Bradford assay. Equal amounts of each sample were used to detect the Cuf1FLAG2 protein using anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.) as described by the manufacturer. To carry out immunodetection of the 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, monoclonal anti-PGK antibody 22C5-D8 (Molecular Probes, OR) was used. When examined in S. pombe cuf1Δ cells, thecuf1 + FLAG2 fusion allele complements the cuf1Δ glycerol growth defect (data not shown). To accomplish this complementation assay, theNdeI-BamHIcuf1 + FLAG2 fragment was isolated from the p416GPDcuf1 + FLAG2 plasmid and then inserted into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pSP1cuf1 +S-B/4.2 plasmid (46Labbé S. Peña M.M.O. Fernandes A.R. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36252-36260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Cultures of DTY59 (ace1Δ), expressing either the p416/426GPD vector alone or p416/426GPDcuf1 + FLAG2, were grown to early log phase under conditions of low copper availability. Cell extracts were prepared as described above in the lysis buffer. This whole cell extract preparation was then separated into aliquots in the presence of binding buffer containing 12.5 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 4 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2.5 μm ZnSO4, 0.6 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 3% Ficoll, and 0.5 μg of random double-stranded DNA (pdN250) and incubated for 20 min at 25 °C in the presence of 1 ng of oligomer probe. Typically, the probe was prepared by hybridizing two oligomers denoted CuSE1up (5′-GTCACTGTTTGTGATGCTGGATTCCGACT-3′) and CuSE1lo (5′-ATCAGTCGGAATCCAGCA-3′) that are partially complementary to each other by 15 bp. Once annealed, the oligomers were made completely double-stranded by incubation with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I in the presence of the 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine triphosphate (BrdUrd) (7.7 mm, made up in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) and 280 mm NaOH) and [α32P]dCTP for 90 min at 25 °C, and then the reaction was chased with dATP, dGTP, and dTTP for an additional 90 min. The gel-purified BrdUrd and [α32P]dCTP oligomer probe that was used corresponds to the CuSE found at positions −721 to −712. After DNA protein binding, reaction mixtures were irradiated for 40 min at 4 °C with an average intensity of 600 microwatts/cm2. The reactions were stopped in Laemmli buffer and heated before SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We have demonstrated previously that in S. pombe, expression of the high affinity copper transporterctr4 + is dependent on the Cuf1 copper-sensing transcription factor (46Labbé S. Peña M.M.O.

https://openalex.org/W2090235518,"The novel phorbol ester receptor β2-chimaerin is a Rac-GAP protein possessing a single copy of the C1 domain, a 50-amino acid motif initially identified in protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes that is involved in phorbol ester and diacylglycerol binding. We have previously shown that, like PKCs, β2-chimaerin binds phorbol esters with high affinity in a phospholipid-dependent manner (Caloca, M. J., Fernandez, M. N., Lewin, N. E., Ching, D., Modali, R., Blumberg, P. M., and Kazanietz, M. G. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 26488–26496). In this paper we report that like PKC isozymes, β2-chimaerin is translocated by phorbol esters from the cytosolic to particulate fraction. Phorbol esters also induce translocation of α1 (n)- and β1-chimaerins, suggesting common regulatory mechanisms for all chimaerin isoforms. The subcellular redistribution of β2-chimaerin by phorbol esters is entirely dependent on the C1 domain, as revealed by deletional analysis and site-directed mutagenesis. Interestingly, β2-chimaerin translocates to the Golgi apparatus after phorbol ester treatment, as revealed by co-staining with the Golgi marker BODIPY-TR-ceramide. Structure relationship analysis of translocation using a series of PKC ligands revealed substantial differences between translocation of β2-chimaerin and PKCα. Strikingly, the mezerein analog thymeleatoxin is not able to translocate β2-chimaerin, although it very efficiently translocates PKCα. Phorbol esters also promote the association of β2-chimaerin with Rac in cells. These data suggest that chimaerins can be positionally regulated by phorbol esters and that each phorbol ester receptor class has distinct pharmacological properties and targeting mechanisms.

These natural compounds exert a variety of effects in cells, which have been largely attributed to the calcium-dependent classical PKCs (cPKCα, βI, βII, and γ) or calcium-independent novel PKCs (nPKCδ, ε, η, and θ). Unlike cPKCs and nPKCs, the third class of PKC isozymes or atypical PKCs (aPKCζ and PKCλ/ι) is phorbol ester-unresponsive. Phorbol esters also target PKCμ (PKD), a kinase related to PKC that has unique substrate specificity and regulation (1Nishizuka Y. FASEB. J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar, 2Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar, 3Newton A.C. Curr. Opin.

The heterogeneity in the phorbol ester responses is probably related to the multiple phorbol ester receptors present in each cell type. An additional level of complexity in the phorbol ester responses is conferred by the unique pharmacological profile of each phorbol ester analog. In fact, ligands for PKCs not only include the typical diterpene phorbol esters but also a large number of unrelated structural analogs such as nonphorbol ester diterpenes (e.g. mezereins, octahydromezerein, and thymeleatoxin), macrocyclic lactones (e.g. bryostatins), and indole alkaloids (e.g. indolactams and teleocidins). The differential effects of phorbol ester analogs in cellular models suggest unique modes of interaction with different phorbol ester receptor classes and may explain the heterogeneous properties of the ligands (4Ron D. Kazanietz M.G. FASEB. J. 1999; 13: 1658-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 5Blumberg P.M. Mol. Carcinog. 1991; 4: 339-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 6Kazanietz M.G.

Carcinog. 2000; 28: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).One of the important novel concepts that has emerged in the past few years is that PKC isozymes are not the only receptors for the phorbol esters and related derivatives. In fact three novel families of phorbol ester receptors unrelated to PKCs have been isolated. These novel phorbol ester receptors, which lack a kinase domain in their structure, include the chimaerin isoforms, Caenorhabditis elegansUnc-13 and its mammalian homologs (Munc13 isoforms), and RasGRP. These proteins have in common a single copy of the C1 domain, a 50/51-amino acid motif that is duplicated in tandem in cPKC and nPKCs, which is the binding site for the phorbol esters and diacylglycerol (DAG) in these PKCs (4Ron D.

It has recently been reported that chimaerins, Unc-13, and RasGRP bind phorbol esters and related analogs with high affinityin vitro, thereby suggesting that a single copy of the C1 domain is sufficient to confer binding responsiveness. In all cases phorbol ester binding is phospholipid-dependent, and acidic phospholipids are the most efficient cofactors for reconstitution of binding (8Caloca M.J. Fernandez M.N. Lewin N.E. Ching D.

The identification of these “nonkinase” phorbol ester receptors suggests that phorbol esters and related analogs may regulate cellular pathways independently of the activation of PKC isozymes.Chimaerins are a novel family of phorbol ester receptors with Rac GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity and therefore accelerate the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP leading to Rac inactivation. Chimaerins comprise at least four isozymes (α1- or n-, α2-, β1-, and β2-chimaerins) that are alternative spliced variants from the α- and β-chimaerin genes (14Hall C. Sin W.C. Teo M. Michael G.J.

The C1 domain in chimaerin isozymes has ∼40% homology with those of PKC isozymes. Using the radioligand [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, we have reported that β2-chimaerin is a high affinity receptor for phorbol esters in vitro (8Caloca M.J. Fernandez M.N. Lewin N.E. Ching D.

Competition assays revealed that different ligands have unique patterns of recognition for different phorbol ester receptors. In fact, although DAGs and indolactams have similar affinities for PKCs and β2-chimaerin, thymeleatoxin (a mezerein analog) has ∼60 times less affinity for β2-chimaerin (8Caloca M.J. Fernandez M.N.

Therefore, it is likely that specific residues within individual C1 domains are critical for conferring binding specificity. Limited information is available on the ligand binding properties of these novel phorbol ester receptors. The regulation, localization, and function of the chimaerins are largely unexplored.One of the hallmarks for the activation of cPKCs and nPKCs by phorbol esters is their change in subcellular localization or “translocation.” Translocation of PKC isozymes is a complex process that not only involves lipid-protein interactions mediated by the C1 domain and other motifs, but it is also dictated by protein-protein associations that may play a key role in determining function specificity for each PKC isozyme (12Jaken S. Parker P.J. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 13Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB. J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). The aim of this study is to investigate whether chimaerins are subject to subcellular redistribution or translocation by phorbol ester analogs. The results presented in this paper show that chimaerins are subject to subcellular translocation by phorbol ester derivatives. Using a series of deletion mutants of β2-chimaerin, we determined that translocation is entirely dependent on the ligand binding to the C1 domain. Interestingly, we found that upon stimulation with different analogs, β2-chimaerin translocates to the Golgi apparatus. These data indicate that the chimaerin family of phorbol ester receptors has unique ligand recognition properties and suggests that phorbol esters have the potential to regulate additional targets in addition to PKC isozymes.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have demonstrated that chimaerin isoforms, like cPKCs and nPKCs, are positionally regulated by phorbol esters. Translocation of chimaerins by phorbol esters is dependent on the chimaerin C1 domain and independent of PKC activation. We have previously demonstrated that these RacGAP proteins bind phorbol esters and DAG with low nanomolar affinity (8Caloca M.J. Fernandez M.N. Lewin N.E. Ching D. Modali R. Blumberg P.M.

Like PKCs, phorbol ester binding to chimaerins is dependent on phospholipids as cofactors, which suggests that association to membranes may be crucial for regulating its activity and/or association to targets. In that regard, it was previously shown that the GAP activity of α1-chimaerin is activated by acidic phospholipids such as phosphatidylserine (31Ahmed S. Lee J. Kozma R. Best A. Monfries C. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10709-10712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper we have observed a similar activation of β2-chimaerin by this acidic phospholipid. Therefore, as described for cPKCs and nPKCs, the association of β2-chimaerin to membrane phospholipids regulates its activity. In preliminary experiments we observed that phorbol esters do not promote RacGAP activity of β2-chimaerin in vitro and that they do not change the phosphatidylserine requirement for GAP activity.4 Although a small degree of activation of RacGAP activity by phorbol esters has been reported for α1-chimaerin (31Ahmed S. Lee J. Kozma R. Best A. Monfries C. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10709-10712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), our results suggest that phorbol esters are responsible for targeting β2-chimaerin to membranes rather than triggering its allosteric activation. Our observation that β2-chimaerin associates with Rac upon phorbol ester treatment suggests that translocation of β2-chimaerin may be a key event in the regulation of Rac activity. We have also observed that β2-chimaerin does not affect GTP hydrolysis from Cdc42 or RhoA, and in addition it inhibits Rac-GTP levels upon stimulation of the EGF receptor in COS-1 cells, an indication that β2-chimaerin has RacGAP activity not only in vitro but also in cells.4We have identified the C1 domain in chimaerins as the minimum domain required for phorbol ester binding and subcellular redistribution in cells. It is therefore clear that a single C1 domain is sufficient for binding of phorbol esters. These results support those from previous experiments using single C1 domains of PKCs, which show that this 50-amino acid domain is sufficient for ligand binding (30Kazanietz M.G. Wang S. Milne G.W.

Chem. 1994; 269: 2961-2970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, experiments using a single C1 domain of PKCγ fused to GFP have shown that this domain was capable of translocating to membranes (35Oancea E. Meyer T. Cell. 1998; 95: 307-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). The notion that a single C1 domain is sufficient to confer translocation is supported by studies showing that functional inactivation of a single C1 domain in PKCα or PKCδ renders mutant PKCs that are still able to translocate upon phorbol ester stimulation (36Szallasi Z. Bogi K. Gohari S. Biro T. Acs P. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18299-18301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 37Bogi K. Lorenzo P.S. Acs P. Szallasi Wagner G.S. Blumberg P.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, these mutants having a single functional C1 domain require higher phorbol ester concentration for translocation, as observed with β2-chimaerin. Therefore, two C1 domains may account for the full responsiveness for PKC translocation by phorbol esters. Our studies do not rule out the possibility that the reduced sensitivity of β2-chimaerin for translocation compared with PKCs is related to the absence of other domains present in PKC that are involved in protein-lipid and/or protein-protein interaction, such as the C2 domain.It is interesting that β2-chimaerin associates with a perinuclear compartment upon phorbol ester activation. Co-staining with a specific Golgi marker reveals a Golgi localization for β2-chimaerin. It has been previously reported that PKCδ and PKCε translocate to the Golgi network upon treatment with phorbol esters or DAGs (28Wang Q.J. Bhattacharyya D. Garfield S. Nacro K. Marquez V.E.

Interestingly, the novel phorbol ester receptor Munc13 also translocates from the cytosol to the Golgi apparatus after phorbol ester stimulation (42Song Y. Ailenberg M. Silverman M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1609-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In support of our localization studies, it was reported that α1-chimaerin regulates Golgi stability during interphase (43Alonso M. Muniz M. Hall C. Velasco A. Hidalgo J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Others have also described the requirement of a PKC-like molecule without phosphorylating activity for the production of post-Golgi vesicles (44Simon J.P. Ivanov I.E. Adesnik M. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 355-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Association of PKCs to other organelles including mitochondria, lysosomes, and endoplasmic reticulum has also been reported (45Goodnight J.A. Mischak H. Kolch W. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9991-10001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 46Li L. Lorenzo P.S. Bogi K. Blumberg P.M. Yuspa S.H. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1998; 18: 3069-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In analogy with the models proposed for PKC isozymes, translocation of chimaerins may involve protein-protein interaction mechanisms. In fact, we have recently isolated a chimaerin interacting protein (Tmp21 or p23) using the yeast two-hybrid system. 5H.-B. Wang and M. G. Kazanietz, submitted for publication. This protein is expressed in the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum. Remarkably, the association of β2-chimaerin and p23 in cells is markedly enhanced by phorbol ester treatment, suggesting that mechanisms of protein-protein interaction similar as those described for PKC isozymes can dictate the intracellular localization of chimaerins. It may be possible that, upon activation, a conformational change in β2-chimaerin occurs that exposes the protein-protein interacting sites, as also described for PKC isozymes. The domain in chimaerins interacting with p23 is in the N-terminal region,5 which may explain the constitutive association of the mutant β2-N-C1 to the perinuclear region. It is important to mention that a large pool of intracellular Rac, the target for chimaerins, is located in a perinuclear region and kept in an inactive state (48Kraynov V.S. Chamberlain C. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Slabaugh S. Hahn K.M. Science. 2000; 290: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). An attractive hypothesis is that chimaerins may play a role in the maintenance of this small GTP-binding protein in an inactive, GDP-bound state at the perinuclear compartment. These important issues are currently being investigated in our laboratory.Our experiments using different ligands show important differences in their potencies for translocating β2-chimaerin. We have previously reported that PKC ligands have a unique pattern for binding to this RacGAP protein (8Caloca M.J. Fernandez M.N. Lewin N.E. Ching D. Modali R. Blumberg P.M. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26488-26496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Remarkably, each receptor class (i.e.PKC isozymes, Unc-13, RasGRP, and chimaerins) interacts differently with phorbol esters and related analogs (6Kazanietz M.G. Caloca M.J. Eroles P. Fujii T.

Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 298-307PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly, specific residues within the individual C1 domains confer unique properties to each receptor class. This is not surprising, because marked differences in ligand selectivity have been shown for individual C1 domains. Potent ligands for one C1 domain may be either weak ligands or may not bind at all to other C1 domains, such as the C1 domains of PKCζ, Vav, or Raf (6Kazanietz M.G. Caloca M.J. Eroles P. Fujii T.

Chem. 1994; 269: 11590-11594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These striking differences have been reported even for the C1a and C1b domain of a single PKC isozyme, such as PKCα, PKCδ, or PKCμ, providing strong evidence that C1 domains are nonequivalent (6Kazanietz M.G. Caloca M.J. Eroles P. Fujii T. Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Reilly M. Wang H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1417-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Structural and biochemical studies with individual C1 domains have confirmed that these marked differences for ligand recognition exist, as described for unrelated ligands such as indolactams, DAGs, and certain phorbol ester analogs (17Caloca M.J. Garcı́a-Bermejo M.L. Blumberg P.M. Lewin N.L. Kremmer E. Mischak H. Wang S. Nacro K Bienfait B. Marquez V.E. Kazanietz M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 42: 3436-3446Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In fact, a detailed structure-activity analysis of β2-chimaerin revealed unique binding properties for this novel phorbol ester receptor. The 60-fold difference in binding affinity for thymeleatoxin between PKCα and β2-chimaerin is the highest reported so far for two individual phorbol ester receptors. Although mutagenesis studies within the β2-chimaerin C1 domain have yet to be done, our modeling analysis with thymeleatoxin has revealed distinct binding recognition for PKCα and β2-chimaerin. It is also remarkable that thymeleatoxin is very potent in translocating PKCα but poorly translocates chimaerin isoforms. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a selective ligand for phorbol ester receptors, a finding that will be valuable for dissecting the biological functions of each receptor class.In summary, the chimaerin isoforms represent a novel class of phorbol ester receptors that are subject to subcellular translocation by phorbol esters and related analogs through their C1 domain. The unique pharmacological properties and distinct localization of each receptor highlights the complexity of phorbol ester pharmacology and DAG signaling, as well as makes questionable the use of phorbol esters as specific ligands for PKC isozymes. The elucidation of the cellular functions of the novel chimaerin receptors will benefit from the rationale design of specific pharmacological agents. The phorbol ester tumor promoters are the most common tools for the activation of protein kinase C (PKC)1 in biological systems. These natural compounds exert a variety of effects in cells, which have been largely attributed to the calcium-dependent classical PKCs (cPKCα, βI, βII, and γ) or calcium-independent novel PKCs (nPKCδ, ε, η, and θ). Unlike cPKCs and nPKCs, the third class of PKC isozymes or atypical PKCs (aPKCζ and PKCλ/ι) is phorbol ester-unresponsive. Phorbol esters also target PKCμ (PKD), a kinase related to PKC that has unique substrate specificity and regulation (1Nishizuka Y. FASEB. J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2355) Google Scholar, 2Mellor H. Parker P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar, 3Newton A.C. Curr. Opin.

The heterogeneity in the phorbol ester responses is probably related to the multiple phorbol ester receptors present in each cell type. An additional level of complexity in the phorbol ester responses is conferred by the unique pharmacological profile of each phorbol ester analog. In fact, ligands for PKCs not only include the typical diterpene phorbol esters but also a large number of unrelated structural analogs such as nonphorbol ester diterpenes (e.g. mezereins, octahydromezerein, and thymeleatoxin), macrocyclic lactones (e.g. bryostatins), and indole alkaloids (e.g. indolactams and teleocidins). The differential effects of phorbol ester analogs in cellular models suggest unique modes of interaction with different phorbol ester receptor classes and may explain the heterogeneous properties of the ligands (4Ron D. Kazanietz M.G. FASEB. J. 1999; 13: 1658-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 5Blumberg P.M. Mol. Carcinog. 1991; 4: 339-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 6Kazanietz M.G.

Carcinog. 2000; 28: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). One of the important novel concepts that has emerged in the past few years is that PKC isozymes are not the only receptors for the phorbol esters and related derivatives. In fact three novel families of phorbol ester receptors unrelated to PKCs have been isolated. These novel phorbol ester receptors, which lack a kinase domain in their structure, include the chimaerin isoforms, Caenorhabditis elegansUnc-13 and its mammalian homologs (Munc13 isoforms), and RasGRP. These proteins have in common a single copy of the C1 domain, a 50/51-amino acid motif that is duplicated in tandem in cPKC and nPKCs, which is the binding site for the phorbol esters and diacylglycerol (DAG) in these PKCs (4Ron D. Kazanietz M.G. FASEB. J. 1999; 13: 1658-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 6Kazanietz M.G. Caloca M.J. Eroles P. Fujii T. Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Reilly M. Wang H. Biochem.

It has recently been reported that chimaerins, Unc-13, and RasGRP bind phorbol esters and related analogs with high affinityin vitro, thereby suggesting that a single copy of the C1 domain is sufficient to confer binding responsiveness. In all cases phorbol ester binding is phospholipid-dependent, and acidic phospholipids are the most efficient cofactors for reconstitution of binding (8Caloca M.J. Fernandez M.N. Lewin N.E. Ching D.

When incubated with NAD, CD38 predominantly hydrolyzes it to ADP-ribose (NAD glycohydrolase), but a trace amount of cADPR is also produced through cyclization of the substrate. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to investigate the amino acid important for controlling the hydrolysis and cyclization reactions. CD38 and its mutants were produced in yeast, purified, and characterized by immunoblot. Glu-146 is a conserved residue present in the active site of CD38. Its replacement with Phe greatly enhanced the cyclization activity to a level similar to that of the NAD hydrolysis activity. A series of additional replacements was made at the Glu-146 position including Ala, Asn, Gly, Asp, and Leu. All the mutants exhibited enhanced cyclase activity to various degrees, whereas the hydrolysis activity was inhibited greatly. E146A showed the highest cyclase activity, which was more than 3-fold higher than its hydrolysis activity. All mutants also cyclized nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide to produce cyclic GDP. This activity was enhanced likewise, with E146A showing more than 9-fold higher activity than the wild type. In addition to NAD, CD38 also hydrolyzed cADPR effectively, and this activity was correspondingly depressed in the mutants. When all the mutants were considered, the two cyclase activities and the two hydrolase activities were correlated linearly. The Glu-146 replacements, however, only minimally affected the base-exchange activity that is responsible for synthesizing NAADP. Homology modeling was used to assess possible structural changes at the active site of E146A.

Site-directed mutagenesis of CD38 identifies three critical residues, Glu-226, Trp-125, and Trp-189; all three cluster in the active site pocket. Of the three residues, Glu-226 is most likely the catalytic residue, because its replacement results in the loss of all enzymatic activities. The same residue is also ADP-ribosylated during catalysis, suggesting that a single covalent intermediate is involved (16Sauve A.A. Munshi C. Lee H.C. Schramm V.L.

In this study, we use site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the determinants important in controlling the multitude of enzymatic activities of CD38. The results identify another glutamate residue in the active site pocket of CD38 as crucial in determining the NAD cyclizing and hydrolytic activities. Replacement of the residue greatly stimulates the ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity of CD38 while inhibiting its hydrolytic activities. The Pichiaexpression vector pPICZαA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used, and the construct consisted of cloning the catalytic domain of either the wild-type or mutant human CD38 in frame with the yeast mating α-factor signal sequence as described previously (14Munshi C.

Immunol. 1990; 144: 2811-2815PubMed Google Scholar), were deleted, and the catalytic domain started at Arg-45. The expressed protein was soluble and was purified from the culture medium in a single step using a cation exchange column (SP5 PW, Waters, Milford, MA; Ref. 18Munshi C.B. Fryxell K.B. Lee H.C. Branton W.D. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 318-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). At least two separate cultures were made from each mutant, and each culture was purified separately. The purified proteins were divided into aliquots and stored at −20 °C. Repeated freeze/thaw cycles caused protein aggregation and decreased enzymatic activities. The wild-type or mutant CD38 (0.05–2 μg/ml) was incubated (1–40 min) at room temperature with various concentrations of specific substrates, 9 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8). The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS (0.05% final concentration). High pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses were performed using an AG MP-1 column (10 × 120 mm) as described previously (15Munshi C. Thiel D.J. Mathews I.I. Aarhus R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30770-30777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The NAD glycohydrolase (NADase) and the cADPR hydrolase activities were assayed with various concentrations of NAD (7–160 μm) or cADPR (62.5 μm-1 mm), respectively. The base-exchange reaction was similarly assayed at pH 4.5 in the presence of 50 mm nicotinic acid and various concentrations of NADP (10–160 μm). The GDP-ribosyl cyclase activity was measured with 25 μm NGD, and the production of cGDPR was recorded continuously at the emission wavelength of 410 nm (excitation at 300 nm). The rate of cGDPR production was calculated by differentiating the time course of the fluorescence change as previously described (20Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Fryxell K. Branton W.D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30260-30267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, GDP-ribosyl cyclase was also assayed using various [NGD] (10–160 μm), and the product, cGDPR, was measured using HPLC. Enzyme activities of the wild-type and mutant CD38 were measured using at least two different protein preparations. The results shown are mean ± S.E. of at least four determinations. The V max andK m values were obtained from double-reciprocal plots, and the results shown are mean ± S.E. of at least four determinations. Student's t test was used to compare kinetic constants of the mutants with the wild type. The mutations were carried out using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit obtained from Stratagene as previously described (14Munshi C. Aarhus R. Graeff R. Walseth T.F. Levitt D. Lee H.C. J.

Immunol. 1990; 144: 2811-2815PubMed Google Scholar) starting at Pro-53 was aligned first with the sequence of theAplysia cyclase (21Glick D.L. Hellmich M.R. Beushausen S. Tempst P. Bayley H. Strumwasser F. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The “Homology” feature in Insight II (Molecular Simulations, Inc.) was used, together with the crystal coordinates of the cyclase dimer that we have previously determined (15Munshi C. Thiel D.J.

This structure was then refined using the Powell relaxation routine in X-PLOR as described previously (14Munshi C. Aarhus R. Graeff R. Walseth T.F. Levitt D. Lee H.C. J. Biol.

Mutation of an individual residue was performed using the program Swiss-PDB Viewer (Glaxo Wellcome Experimental Research, Geneva, Switzerland). After replacing the selected residue with the best rotamer, a 200-cycle energy minimization was applied using the steepest descent algorithm. Only the α-carbons were subjected to a harmonic constraint. The resulting structure of the active sites of the wild type and mutants were rendered using the program MolMol (24Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated the validity and usefulness of the homology model in assessing structural features of CD38 (14Munshi C. Aarhus R. Graeff R. Walseth T.F. Levitt D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21566-21571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The model reveals that part of the active site pocket of CD38 is formed by a sequence (144TLEDTL), which is conserved totally among three species of CD38 and two species of ADP-ribosyl cyclases (reviewed in Refs. 8Lee H.C. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1999; 380: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 9Lee H.C. Munshi C. Graeff R. Mol. Cell.

In this study, the Glu-146 present in the conserved sequence was targeted for site-directed mutagenesis, and the effects of the mutation on the five enzymatic activities of CD38 were determined. The cyclization reaction was assayed using NAD or NGD as substrate, and the production of cADPR or cGDPR was monitored by HPLC or fluorometrically (20Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Fryxell K. Branton W.D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30260-30267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The exchange of the nicotinamide group of NADP with nicotinic acid was measured as NAADP production using HPLC (25Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. Dickey D.M. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30327-30333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The two hydrolytic reactions, NADase and cADPR hydrolase, were assayed as production of ADP-ribose from NAD and cADPR, respectively. CD38 and the mutant proteins were produced in transfected yeast. The proteins were purified by cation-exchange chromatography, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The preparations were judged pure because staining of the blots for protein revealed a single band of about 32 kDa in each case. All the mutant proteins were recognized by a monoclonal antibody, IB4, against the wild-type CD38 (data not shown). We have previously raised an antibody against the conserved sequence (144TLEDTL; Ref. 15Munshi C. Thiel D.J. Mathews I.I. Aarhus R. Walseth T.F. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30770-30777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). When the blot was probed with this antibody, none of the mutant proteins were recognized. The antibody recognized the wild-type CD38 readily, however. These immunoanalyses confirmed that the mutant proteins indeed harbored changes in the conserved sequence, which was verified further by DNA sequencing. Table I compares the enzymatic parameters of Glu-146 mutants with those of the wild type. CD38 had very high NADase activity, but its cyclase activity was not detectable by HPLC. In striking contrast, E146F, with a Phe substitution, had much depressed NADase activity as compared with the wild type. However, it possessed very high cyclase activity, which was as much as its NADase activity. More dramatic is another mutant, E146A. Its cyclase activity was more than 3 times higher than its NADase activity. In general, all mutant proteins possessed cyclase activity of various degrees. E146A had the highest activity, and E146L had the lowest. Even for E146L, its cyclase activity of 400 ± 24 nmol/mg/min (V max value) was readily detectable by the HPLC assay. The NADase activities of most mutants are similar to E146A except E146F, which has much higher activity. The concomitant stimulation of the cyclase activity and inhibition of the NADase activity suggest that Glu-146 controls both.Table IActivation of ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity by replacement of Glu-146ADP-ribosyl cyclaseNADaseCyclase/NADaseVmaxKmVmaxKmnmol/mg/minμmnmol/mg/minμmWTND—86,300 ± 5,60048 ± 4≈0E146L400 ± 2412 ± 21,600 ± 9 1-aValues significantly different from wild type by t test (p < 0.01).17 ± 2 1-aValues significantly different from wild type by t test (p < 0.01).0.3 ± 0.0E146F11,700 ± 30019 ± 214,500 ± 1,800 1-aValues significantly different from wild type by t test (p < 0.01).62 ± 130.9 ± 0.1E146D2,200 ± 2608 ± 11,600 ± 88 1-aValues significantly different from wild type by t test (p < 0.01).27 ± 2 1-aValues significantly different from wild type by t test (p < 0.01).1.3 ± 0.1E146G2,900 ± 2706 ± 11,400 ± 190 1-aValues significantly different from wild type by t test (p < 0.01).51 ± 172.2 ± 0.4E146N7,700 ± 60022 ± 23,300 ± 210 1-aValues significantly different from wild type by t test (p < 0.01).42 ± 72.4 ± 0.3E146A13,000 ± 28019 ± 14,100 ± 60 1-aValues significantly different from wild type by t test (p < 0.01).30 ± 1 1-aValues significantly different from wild type by t test (p < 0.01).3.2 ± 0.1Two different protein preparations were used for the wild type and each of the mutants.

WT, wild type; ND, not detectable by HPLC. It is more instructive to use the ratio of the cyclase and NADase activities as an index for assessing the stimulation of the cyclase in the mutants. As shown in Table I, the ratio for the wild type was essentially zero because it expressed low cyclase activity but high NADase activity. E146A had the highest ratio; its cyclase activity was more than 3-fold higher than its NADase activity. A common characteristic of the three mutants that had the highest ratios (E146A, E146N, and E146G) is that they all have small and uncharged side chains. The rest of the mutants (E146L, E146F, and E146D) have approximately equal cyclase and NADase activities and a ratio around unity. It thus seems that there is a specific structural requirement of small and uncharged side chain at the 146 position of the CD38 sequence for the enhanced cyclase activity. The fact that all mutant proteins possessed various enzymatic activities indicates that the single-residue replacements did not distort the active site grossly. Clearly they were fully capable of not only binding the substrates but also catalytically converting them to products. The structural changes induced by the substitution were thus subtle. In addition to the Glu-146 mutants, we have produced various substitutions of other residues in the active site of CD38 that included Glu-226, Asp-155, Trp-189, and Trp-125 (14Munshi C. Aarhus R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 21566-21571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) as well as two Cys residues, Cys-119 and Cys-201 (26Tohgo A. Takasawa S. Noguchi N. Koguma T. Nata K. Sugimoto T. Furuya Y. Yonekura H. Okamoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28555-28557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ‡Both authors contributed equally to this work. None of these substitutions enhanced the cyclase activity, indicating that Glu-146 is uniquely important in controlling it. As listed in Table I, substituting Ala for Glu-146 decreased the NADase activity by more than 21-fold. Even E146F, the least inhibited mutant, showed a 6-fold decrease in activity. In contrast, as listed in TableII, the substitutions had less dramatic effects on the base-exchange activity of the same mutants. This is especially the case for E146A, the exchange activity of which was essentially the same as the wild type. The effect of substituting Glu-146 with these selected amino acids on the enzyme activities of CD38 thus is selective for the specific reaction. Two of the mutants (E146D and E146G), however, did show more severe inhibition of the exchange activity.Table IIEffects of substitutions of Glu-146 on the base-exchange activityBase exchangeV maxK mnmol/mg/minμmWT76,100 ± 4,30020 ± 2E146A50,900 ± 5,40047 ± 5 2-aValues are significantly different from wild type by t test (p < 0.01).E146F33,700 ± 5,000 2-aValues are significantly different from wild type by t test (p < 0.01).160 ± 32 2-aValues are significantly different from wild type by t test (p < 0.01).E146N27,900 ± 5,900 2-aValues are significantly different from wild type by t test (p < 0.01).82 ± 18E146L11,100 ± 550 2-aValues are significantly different from wild type by t test (p < 0.01).113 ± 15 2-aValues are significantly different from wild type by t test (p < 0.01).E146G8,300 ± 800 2-aValues are significantly different from wild type by t test (p < 0.01).36 ± 3 2-aValues are significantly different from wild type by t test (p < 0.01).E146D2,200 ± 260 2-aValues are significantly different from wild type by t test (p < 0.01).8 ± 1 2-aValues are significantly different from wild type by t test (p < 0.01).Two different protein preparations were used for the wild type and each of the mutants.

Although CD38 produces only trace amounts of cADPR from NAD, it does have potent cyclization activity that can be readily shown by using NGD instead of NAD as substrate. The main product in this case is cGDPR (20Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Fryxell K. Branton W.D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30260-30267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Table III compares the GDP-ribosyl cyclase activity of the wild-type CD38 with its Glu-146 mutants. E146A and E146F, the two mutants that had the highest ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity, also had the highest GDP-ribosyl cyclase activity, which was 2- to 3-fold higher than that of the wild type.

Cyclization of NGD occurs at the N-7 position of the guanine ring instead of the N-1 position of the adenine ring of cADPR (27Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Hill H.K. Lee H.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and requires a rotation of the guanine ring around the N-9–ribose bond to an anti-orientation. The similar enhancement of these two very dissimilar cyclization reactions suggests that the residue Glu-146 is important in controlling both. This is illustrated in Fig.1 A by plotting one activity against the other, and an approximately linear relation is revealed with a regression coefficient of 0.77. Of the five enzymatic activities measured, the GDP-ribosyl cyclase of the mutants was the only one that had K m values significantly higher than those of the wild type, suggesting a reduction of substrate affinity by the substitutions. In addition to comparing the maximal cyclase activity at high substrate concentration (V max values), Table III also listsV max/K m ratios of the wild type and mutants. The Michaelis-Menten model predicts that at low substrate concentrations, the enzyme activity is proportional to the substrate concentration, and the proportionality constant is theV max/K m ratio. The ratios for all the mutants were less than those for the wild type, which can be attributed to their higher K m values. Thus, substitution of Glu-146 inhibited the GDP-ribosyl cyclase activity of all the mutants when assayed at low substrate concentrations, further indicating that Glu-146 is important in controlling the enzyme activity. Another major reaction catalyzed by CD38 is the hydrolysis of cADPR to ADP-ribose, which is responsible for terminating the signaling function of the Ca2+ messenger (reviewed in Ref. 28Lee H.C. Chem. Immunol. 2000; 75: 39-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In fact, CD38 is the only enzyme reported so far that is capable of hydrolyzing cADPR. Table IV compares the cADPR hydrolysis reaction of the mutants with that of the wild type. Similar to the NADase, the substitutions produced various degrees of inhibition of the cADPR hydrolase activity. Indeed, the two activities seem to be correlated. This correlation is shown in Fig. 1 B, in which the cADPR hydrolase activity of each mutant is plotted against its NADase activity. A roughly linear relationship with a regression coefficient of 0.68 is observed. Summarizing, substitution of Glu-146 with amino acids such as Ala and Phe inhibit the two hydrolase activities of CD38 while stimulating the V max of the two cyclase reactions. The base-exchange activity, on the other hand, seems minimally affected.Table IVEffects of substitutions of Glu-146 on cADPR hydrolase activitycADPR hydrolaseV maxK mnmol/mg/minμmWT2,700 ± 720420 ± 96E146F2,300 ± 260170 ± 17E146N1,300 ± 180210 ± 56E146L1,200 ± 490520 ± 87E146A800 ± 60140 ± 29E146G360 ± 90420 ± 110E146DND—Two to four different protein preparations were used for each of the mutants.

Glu-146 is a special residue. Not only is it conserved among several species of mammalian CD38 and Aplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclase (reviewed in Refs. 9Lee H.C. Munshi C. Graeff R. Mol. Cell.

This is illustrated in Fig. 2 A, which shows the three-dimensional surfaces of the active site of the wild-type CD38. Glu-146 is located directly opposite Glu-226, which is likely the catalytic residue because its substitution with even conservative residues abolishes all enzymatic activities of CD38 (14Munshi C. Aarhus R. Graeff R. Walseth T.F. Levitt D. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21566-21571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The distance between the two residues is 8.1 Å, which is about the width of a molecule of cADPR (29Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Levitt D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 143-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The homology model can be used also to assess the effect of substitution of Glu-146 on the structure of the active site. The six mutants produced in this study can be divided into two groups, those with a high cyclase/NADase ratio and those with a ratio near unity. The ratio of the cyclase and NADase activities can be viewed as normalization, minimizing the nonspecific effects of the substitution. Thus, effects such as changes in substrate affinity that affect both enzyme activities equally would be corrected by the procedure. It is thus a better measure of the cyclase activation than the specific activity alone. E146A, a representative of the group that had a high cyclase/NADase ratio, was analyzed first. After replacing Glu-146 with Ala, energy minimization was performed with harmonic constraints placed only on the α-carbons. The resulting structure is shown in Fig. 2 B. The side chain of alanine is smaller than glutamate. The distance between Ala-146 and Glu-226 is thus larger at 9.8 Å, making the opening of the active site pocket slightly wider. In addition, the region around the alanine (tinted yellow) appears more restricted as compared with the wild type. The net effect of these changes could be to allow the substrate to bind deeper into the pocket, occluding it and thereby restricting access of water into the active site. This could lead to concomitant enhancement of the cyclization reaction and depression of the hydrolysis reaction as we have previously suggested (8Lee H.C. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1999; 380: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 11Lee H.C. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1133-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 27Graeff R.M. Walseth T.F. Hill H.K. Lee H.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). According to our proposed mechanism of catalysis, binding of NAD to the active site is followed by the release of nicotinamide and the formation of an activated intermediate. Recent results indicate that the intermediate is likely to be covalent, because the catalytic residue Glu-226 is shown to be ADP-ribosylated during catalysis (17Sauve A.A. Deng H.T. Angeletti R.H. Schramm V.L. J. Am Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 7855-7859Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Intramolecular attack of the intermediate by N-1 of the adenine would result in cyclization and the formation of cADPR from NAD. On the other hand, nucleophilic attack of the intermediate by water would instead lead to hydrolysis and the formation of ADP-ribose from NAD. In the wild type, the highly hydrophilic Glu-146 allows ready access of water to the intermediate, and thus the NADase reaction is dominant. Replacement with a small and uncharged residue would lead to a more restrictive active site and reduce water access. This would increase the chance of intramolecular attack and stimulate cyclization as is observed in this study. Similar to E146A, E146G and E146N both have relatively small and uncharged side chains. Indeed, both mutants have a cyclase/NADase ratio similar to that of E146A, and the analysis described above is equally applicable as well. Fig. 2 C shows the energy-minimized model of the active site of E146F, a representative of the group of mutants having a lower cyclase/NADase ratio. The hydrophobic nature of the phenyl group tends to reduce water access to the active site and thus promote cyclization. The hydrophobic effect, however, is counter balanced to a certain extent by the bulkiness of the side chain, which reduces the size of the mouth of the active pocket. The distance between Glu-226 and Phe-146 is now only 7.5 Å, smaller than the width of a molecule of cADPR. This would require the substrate to tilt and insert sideways into the active side instead. The less-than-perfect fit could result in leakage of water into the site, accounting for the higher hydrolase activity of E146F than E146A. Water access as an important determinant of the cyclase activity represents a working hypothesis that is consistent with some of the structure-function features of the mutants described in this study. More quantitative understanding of the exact mechanism of the catalysis of CD38, however, must await crystallographic determination of the active site with a substrate bound.

https://openalex.org/W2063795933,"Scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) has recently been identified as a high density lipoprotein (HDL) receptor that mediates bidirectional flux of cholesterol across the plasma membrane. We have previously demonstrated that oxidized low density lipoprotein (OxLDL) will increase expression of another class B scavenger receptor, CD36 (Han, J., Hajjar, D. P., Febbraio, M., and Nicholson, A. C. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 21654–21659). In studies reported herein, we evaluated the effects of OxLDL on expression of SR-BI in macrophages to determine how exposure to this modified lipoprotein could alter SR-BI expression and cellular lipid flux. OxLDL decreased SR-BI expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Incubation with OxLDL had no effect on the membrane distribution of SB-BI, and it decreased expression of both cytosolic and membrane protein. Consistent with its effect on SR-BI protein expression, OxLDL decreased SR-BI mRNA in a dose-dependent manner. The ability of OxLDL to decrease SR-BI expression was dependent on the degree of LDL oxidation. OxLDL decreased both [14C]cholesteryl oleate/HDL uptake and efflux of [14C]cholesterol to HDL in a time-dependent manner. Incubation of macrophages with 7-ketocholesterol, but not free cholesterol, also inhibited expression of SR-BI. Finally, we demonstrate that the effect of OxLDL on SR-BI is dependent on the differentiation state of the monocyte/macrophage. These results imply that in addition to its effect in inducing foam cell formation in macrophages through increased uptake of oxidized lipids, OxLDL may also enhance foam cell formation by altering SR-BI-mediated lipid flux across the cell membrane.

In the present study, we evaluate expression of SR-BI in macrophages to determine how it is regulated in response to OxLDL. Raw264.7 cells, a murine macrophage cell line (ATCC, Mnaassas, VA), were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Cells were switched to serum-free medium for 3–5 h when the confluence was about 85%. Cells received treatments in serum-free medium. Human monocytes were isolated from the pooled blood of volunteer donors by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation. Monocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% human serum (Bioreclamation, Hicksville, NY), 50 μg/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. Nonadherent cells were removed by washing after 2 h of incubation. LDL (1.019–1.063 g/ml) and HDL (1.063–1.210 g/ml) were isolated from normal human plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation. They were dialyzed against PBS containing 0.3 mm EDTA, sterilized by filtration through a 0.22-μm filter, and stored under nitrogen gas at 4 °C. Protein content was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (26Lowry O. Rosebrough N. Farr A. Randall J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). OxLDL was prepared by dialysis of 500 μg/ml of LDL in PBS containing 5 μm CuSO4 for 12 h, (or other indicated times) at 37 °C, followed by dialysis in PBS containing 0.3 mm EDTA for 2 × 12 h. The purity and charge of both LDL and OxLDL were evaluated by examining electrophoretic migration in agarose gel. The degree of oxidation of LDL and OxLDL was determined by measuring the amount of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBAR). LDL had TBAR values of <1 nmol/mg. OxLDL had TBAR values of >10 and <30 nmol/mg. All lipoproteins were used for experiments within 3 weeks after preparation. Cells were lysed in RNAzolTM B (Tel-Test, Inc.) and chloroform-extracted, and total cellular RNA was precipitated in isopropyl alcohol. After washing with 80 and 100% ethanol, the dried pellet of total RNA was dissolved in distilled water and quantified. The poly(A+) RNA was purified from about 80 μg of total RNA by using the Poly(A)Ttract® mRNA Isolation System III (Promega, Madison, WI). Poly(A+) RNA was loaded on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel. After electrophoresis, poly(A+) RNA was transferred to a Zeta-probe® GT Genomic Tested Blotting Membrane (Bio-Rad) in 10× SSC by capillary force for overnight. The blot was UV cross-linked for 2 min and then prehybridized with HybrisolTM I (Oncor, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) for 30 min before the addition of32P-randomly primed labeling probe for mouse SR-BI or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. After overnight hybridization, the membrane was washed for 2 × 20 min with 2× SSC and 0.2% SDS and for 2 × 20 min with 0.2× SSC and 0.2% SDS at 55 °C. The blot was autoradiographed by exposure to an x-ray film (X-OmatTM AR, Eastman Kodak Co.). The semiquantitative assay of autoradiograms was assessed by densitometric scanning using a UMAX (Santa Clara, CA) UC630 flatbed scanner attached to a Macintosh IIci (Apple Computer, Cupertino, CA) running NIH Image software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The probe for mouse SR-BI was generated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction based on the published sequence. The sequences of 5′- and 3′-oligonucleotides used were TCGGCGTTGTCATGATCCTC (positions 121–141) and GGTTCATAAAAGCACGCTGG (positions 551–571), respectively (2Acton S. Attilio R. Landschulz K. Xu S. Hobbs H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1989) Google Scholar). After treatment, macrophages were washed twice with cold PBS and then scraped and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxychlorate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthvanadate, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, and 50 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysate was sonicated for 20 cycles and then microcentrifugated for 15 min at 4 °C, and supernatant was transferred to a new test tube. For the isolation of cytosolic protein, cells were lysed in the lysis buffer in the absence of detergent followed by sonication. To extract membrane protein, the pellet, after removal of cytosolic protein, was relysed in lysis buffer containing detergent and sonicated. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected as membrane fraction. Proteins were separated on a SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto nylon-enhanced nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked with a solution of 0.1% Tween 20/PBS (PBS-T) containing 5% fat-free milk for 1 h and then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-SR-BI (Novus Biological, Inc., Littleton, CO) for 2 h at room temperature followed by washing for 3 × 10 min with PBS-T buffer. The blot was reblocked with PBS-T containing 5% milk followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for another 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times for 10 min each with PBS-T, the membrane was incubated for 1 min in a mixture of equal volumes of Western blot chemiluminescence reagents 1 and 2. The membrane was then exposed to film before development. [14C]Cholesterol was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. For influx study, macrophages were cultured in 24-well plates until ∼85% confluence. After treatment, cells were washed with PBS and then incubated with a mixture of [14C]cholesteryl oleate (200 nCi/ml) and HDL (100 μg/ml) in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. At the indicated times, medium was removed, and cells were washed twice with PBS and then lysed by the addition of 0.1 n NaOH. Radioactivity and protein content in lysate were determined. To study the efflux, macrophages were cultured in 24-well plates in complete medium containing free [14C]cholesterol (80 nCi/ml) until ∼85% confluence. Cells then were switched into serum-free medium or medium containing 50 μg/ml OxLDL for 24 h. After washing twice with PBS, cells were incubated with 400 μg/ml HDL in serum-free RPMI medium. Free [14C]cholesterol (cholesterol efflux) was determined in the media collected at the indicated times. Methylated β-cyclodextrin (MeβCD), cholesterol and 7-ketocholesterol were purchased from Sigma. To prepare the complexes of MeβCD-cholesterol, cholesterol or 7-ketocholesterol was dissolved in a mixture of methanol and chloroform (1:1) at a concentration of 100 mm. An ∼0.5-ml solution of cholesterol or 7-ketocholesterol was dried under N2, and then 20 ml of 10 mm MeβCD solution was added. The dried cholesterol was suspended in solution by scraping off the wall of the tube. The suspension of cholesterol was sonicated for 5 min on ice and rotated in a 37 °C oven overnight. After adjusting the pH to 7.4, the mixture was filtered through a 0.22-μm filter. The concentration of cholesterol in the prepared solution was about 250–300 μg/ml as determined by a cholesterol assay kit (Sigma). To investigate the effects of various lipoproteins on SR-BI expression, macrophages were treated with OxLDL (10 and 50 μg/ml), LDL (50 μg/ml), or HDL (50 μg/ml) for 16 h. The protein was extracted in lysis buffer containing detergent and analyzed for changes of SR-BI protein expression. OxLDL, at both 10 and 50 μg/ml, significantly decreased SR-BI protein (Fig.1). LDL had no effect and HDL slightly increased SR-BI expression. Concentration and time course analyses showed that OxLDL decreased SR-BI expression in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2 A). Decreased expression of SR-BI by OxLDL occurred by 4 h after initiation of treatment (Fig.2 B) with a maximum inhibition occurring at 8 h. OxLDL had no effect on the membrane distribution of SB-BI and decreased expression of both membrane and cytosolic protein (Fig.3).Figure 2OxLDL decreases SR-BI expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner.

Consistent with its effect on SR-BI protein expression, OxLDL decreased SR-BI mRNA in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4). We next determined if the degree of LDL oxidation affected its ability to modulate SR-BI expression. The degree of LDL oxidation was increased with increasing times of dialysis in PBS containing 5 μmCuSO4. Oxidation was stopped by the addition of EDTA and dialysis in cold PBS containing EDTA. Oxidation was quantified by assessment of TBAR and migration in agarose gel (data not shown). The ability of OxLDL to decrease SR-BI expression increased with the length of time of LDL oxidation (Fig. 5). We next evaluated the functional consequences of decreased SB-BI expression in response to OxLDL. Both the efflux of free cholesterol and influx of cholesteryl ester were evaluated in macrophages following incubation with OxLDL. OxLDL decreased both [14C]cholesteryl oleate/HDL uptake (Fig.6 A) and efflux of [14C]cholesterol to HDL in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 6 B). The relatively small changes seen in both HDL-mediated influx and efflux in response to OxLDL do not parallel the degree of down-regulation of SR-BI expression in response to OxLDL. The reasons for this are not completely clear but may reflect alterations in both receptor- and nonreceptor-mediated effects of OxLDL on cholesterol trafficking. Without blocking SR-BI, it is not possible to directly attribute the effects of OxLDL on either influx or efflux of cholesterol to SR-BI. To investigate the mechanism(s) by which OxLDL inhibited SR-BI expression and to determine if changes in SR-BI could be mimicked by incubation of macrophages with cholesterol or an oxysterol, we evaluated SR-BI expression in cells incubated with these lipids. We have previously demonstrated that changes in cellular cholesterol levels following incubation of macrophages with β-Cyclodextrins can alter expression of CD36 (27Han J. Hajjar D.P. Tauras J.M. Nicholson A.C. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 830-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). β-Cyclodextrins are cyclic oligosaccharides that encapsulate insoluble hydrophobic compounds and allow them to become soluble in aqueous solutions (28Pitha J. Irie T. Sklar P. Nye J. Life Sci. 1988; 43: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Cyclodextrins are efficient at removing cholesterol from cells in culture (29Kilsdonk E. Yancey P.

Haynes M.P. Phillips M. Rothblat G. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2264-2272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We evaluated SR-BI expression following the addition of cholesterol or oxidized cholesterol complexed with β-cyclodextrin. Incubation of macrophages with 7-ketocholesterol-β-cyclodextrin for 16 h decreased expression of SR-BI, while cholesterol-β-cyclodextrin had no effect on SR-BI expression (Fig. 7). The mechanism by which this oxysterol inhibits SR-BI expression remains to be determined and is currently under investigation in our laboratory. To confirm our results in primary human cells, we evaluated the effect of OxLDL on SR-BI expression in human monocyte-derived macrophages. OxLDL increased SR-BI expression when added to monocyte/macrophages after three days in culture (Fig.8 A). OxLDL also increased expression of CD14, consistent with a differentiation-related event (25Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J. Chen H. Evans R. Cell. 1998; 93: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). However, when OxLDL was incubated with fully differentiated macrophages (10 days after isolation in culture), OxLDL had no effect on CD14 expression but decreased SR-BI expression (Fig. 8 B). We demonstrate that macrophage expression of SR-BI is inhibited in response to OxLDL, resulting in reduced HDL-cholesteryl ester uptake and HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux. Our data are consistent with previous data demonstrating that intracellular cholesterol levels regulate SR-BI expression and that there is an inverse relationship between SR-BI expression and cellular cholesterol pools (32Wang N. Weng W. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). This inverse relationship between cellular cholesterol content and SR-BI expression was also seen in an adrenal cell line (Y1-BS1) treated with β-cyclodextrin to deplete cellular cholesterol stores (33Sun Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1799-1805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As cellular cholesterol was reduced over time, SR-BI expression increased (33Sun Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1799-1805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using a similar technique, we demonstrated a direct effect (increased cellular cholesterol was associated with increased expression) of cholesterol levels on expression of the macrophage class B scavenger receptor, CD36 (27Han J. Hajjar D.P. Tauras J.M. Nicholson A.C. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 830-838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the present study, 7-ketocholesterol, but not cholesterol, reduced SR-BI expression. 7-Ketocholesterol is a prominent oxysterol formed during the oxidation of LDL (34Tanaka M. Kanamaru S. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1993; 16: 538-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) but is not a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ ligand (25Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J. Chen H. Evans R. Cell. 1998; 93: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to determine the specific mechanism by which this oxysterol inhibits SR-BI expression. The effects of cholesterol on SR-BI expression may be cell type-dependent. Rats given a 2-week high cholesterol diet had decreased SR-BI expression in hepatic parenchymal cells, while the expression in Kupffer cells was increased (35Fluiter K. van der Westhuijzen D.R. van Berkel T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8434-8438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In steroidogenic tissues (adrenal gland, testes), SR-BI expression is also hormonally regulated. Both adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and human chorionic gonadotropin increase SR-BI expression. In rats, estrogen treatment inhibits hepatic SR-BI expression (16Landschulz K.T. Pathak R.K. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 984-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The human SR-BI gene contains the consensus site for steroidogenic factor-1, an orphan member of the nuclear hormone receptor family involved in the regulation of steroidogenesis (36Cao G. Garcia C.K. Wyne K.L. Schultz R.A. Parker K.L. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33068-33076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). SR-BI is expressed in macrophage-rich areas in foam cells within atherosclerotic lesions of apoE-deficient mice (8Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. Moya M.L. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Swaney J.B.

Fruchart J.C. Tedgui A. Najib-Fruchart J. Staels B. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2411-2417Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) and in human atherosclerotic lesions (18Hirano K. Yamashita S. Nakagawa Y. Ohya T. Matsuura F. Tsukamoto K. Okamoto Y. Matsuyama A. Matsumoto K. Miyagawa J. Matsuzawa Y. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Several reports document the expression of SR-BI/CLA-1 in monocytes, macrophages, and monocytic cell lines; however, its function in lipid metabolism in these cells and in cholesterol accumulation or efflux in atherosclerotic lesions remains unclear. There is conflicting data addressing the regulation of SR-BI/CLA-1 in monocyte/macrophages. Murao et al. reported that CLA-1 mRNA is expressed in human monocytes and THP-1 cells, a human promonocytic leukemia cell line (19Murao K. Terpstra V. Green S.R. Kondratenko N. Steinberg D. Quehenberger O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17551-17557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Expression of CLA-1 was higher in freshly isolated monocytes than in macrophages, and expression in THP-1 cells decreased following differentiation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (19Murao K. Terpstra V. Green S.R. Kondratenko N. Steinberg D. Quehenberger O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17551-17557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Contrary to these findings, other groups find that expression of CLA-1 is low in freshly isolated human monocytes but increased upon differentiation of these cells in tissue culture (17Chinetti G. Gbaguidi F.G. Griglio S. Mallat Z. Antonucci M. Poulain P. Chapman J. Fruchart J.C. Tedgui A. Najib-Fruchart J. Staels B.

Commun. 1999; 262: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). CLA-1 was induced in monocytes treated with macrophage colony-stimulating factor and fetal calf serum (20Buechler C. Ritter M. Quoc C.D. Agildere A. Schmitz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and was inhibited in both monocytes and macrophages by treatment with interferon-γ, lipopolysaccharide, and tumor necrosis factor (20Buechler C. Ritter M. Quoc C.D. Agildere A. Schmitz G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In contrast to our data, Hirano et al. (18Hirano K. Yamashita S. Nakagawa Y. Ohya T. Matsuura F. Tsukamoto K. Okamoto Y. Matsuyama A. Matsumoto K. Miyagawa J. Matsuzawa Y. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) demonstrated that incubation of human monocyte-derived macrophages with either OxLDL or acetylated LDL increased SR-BI expression by 4-fold. The reason for this discrepancy with our data and with data demonstrating an inverse relationship between cellular cholesterol content and SR-BI expression (33Sun Y. Wang N. Tall A.R. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1799-1805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is undetermined, but it may relate to the preparation of the OxLDL or the time frame of cell treatment. In our experiments, macrophages were treated for 2–10 h, a time frame in which we do not observe significant lipid accumulation in our cells. Hirano et al. (18Hirano K. Yamashita S. Nakagawa Y. Ohya T. Matsuura F. Tsukamoto K. Okamoto Y. Matsuyama A. Matsumoto K. Miyagawa J. Matsuzawa Y. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) incubated macrophages with modified lipoproteins for 24–48 h. Thus, their results may be the result of lipid accumulation that may subsequently affect expression of this receptor by other mechanisms. More likely, these differences relate to the differentiation state of the monocyte/macrophage. Our data in human monocyte-derived macrophages demonstrate that the OxLDL is acting as a differentiating agent in monocyte/macrophages that are not fully differentiated. We and others have shown that OxLDL induces expression of a differentiation-linked surface antigen, CD14 (Fig. 8 A) (25Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J. Chen H. Evans R. Cell. 1998; 93: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1580) Google Scholar). At this early stage of macrophage differentiation, OxLDL up-regulates SR-BI expression (Fig. 8 A). However, in fully differentiated macrophages, a state more likely to reflect macrophages in atherosclerotic tissue, OxLDL inhibits SR-BI but has no effect on CD-14. It is clear from many lines of evidence that oxidation of low density lipoproteins is a critical early event in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (37Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T. Khoo J. Witztum J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 915-919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). OxLDL is present in human atheroma (38Haberland M. Fong D. Cheng L. Science. 1988; 241: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar) and is the proximal source of lipid that accumulates within cells of the atherosclerotic lesion (37Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T. Khoo J. Witztum J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 915-919Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two macrophage scavenger receptors, the type A scavenger receptor and CD36, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis based on their presence in human lesions (22Nakata A. Nakagawa Y. Nishida M. Nozaki S. Miyagawa J. Nakagawa T. Tamura R. Matsumoto K. Kameda-Takemura K. Yamashita S. Matsuzawa Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Kurihara Y. Takeya M. Kamada N. Kataoka M. Jishage K. Ueda O. Sakaguchi H. Higashi T. Suzuki T. Takashima Y. Kawabe Y. Cynshi O. Wada Y. Honda M. Kurihara H. Aburatani H. Doi T. Matsumota A. Azuma S.

Sharma K. Silverstein R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1049-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Insight into the role of SR-BI in atherosclerosis is provided by murine models of atherosclerosis. SR-BI protects against development of vascular lesions in atherosclerosis-prone mice; however, the mechanism by which it functions in this role remains unclear. Attenuation of SR-BI accelerated the development of atherosclerosis in ApoE knockout mice (15Trigatti B. Rayburn H. Vinals M. Braun A. Miettinen H. Penman M. Hertz M. Schrenzel M. Amigo L. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9322-9327Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Conversely, atherosclerotic lesion size is reduced in LDL receptor knockout mice overexpressing the SR-BI transgene (14Arai T. Wang N. Bezouevski M. Welch C. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2366-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that atherosclerosis in these murine models is either enhanced or repressed by altering HDL-mediated reverse cholesterol transport. However, since SR-BI can also act as a scavenger receptor, binding oxidized LDL, acetylated LDL, and anionic phospholipids (3Acton S. Scherer P. Lodish H. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Rigotti A. Acton S. Krieger M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17551-17557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), it is possible that alterations in SR-BI expression may alter circulating levels and/or binding of these proatherogenic lipids. In conclusion, our data showing that macrophage expression of SR-BI is inhibited in response to OxLDL have potential implications for atherosclerosis. We believe, based on our data, that oxidized LDL may play a duel role in macrophage lipid accumulation. Oxidized lipid probably accumulates in macrophages through scavenger receptor-mediated binding and uptake. However, our data also imply that OxLDL may inhibit SR-BI-mediated efflux, which would act in a synergistic manner to promote lipid retention within macrophages.

They secrete these chelators in the iron-deficient environments that they encounter in the wild and in the host. Because of its involvement in cellular processes, iron is essential to survival, and bacteria possess efficient systems to obtain it (3Braun V. FEMS Microbiol.

Bacteriocins and phages bind to siderophore receptors as an initial step in the penetration of the cell wall (7Guterman S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

However, LGP differ from other porins, because they bind the molecules they transport with high affinity and because they contain a globular N terminus that resides within their transmembrane channel (Fig. 1). When ligands adsorb to siderophore receptors, they trigger unknown events that induce their own transport into the cell (33Liu J. Rutz J.M. Klebba P.E. Feix J.B.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 70: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), whereas ferrichrome (Fc), a fungal product that E. coli also utilizes, passes through FhuA (44Wayne R. Neilands J.B. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 121: 497-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Does LGP specificity derive from residues in their surface loops or from amino acids in the N-domain, at the entrance to the membrane channel (Fig. 1)? Experiments on a FhuA mutant devoid of its N-terminal domain (45Braun M. Killmann H. Braun V. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1037-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) were relevant to this issue, as well as that of ligand transport. In those studies the N-domain of FhuA was not necessary for Fc, colicin, and bacteriophage uptake. The experiments we report herein duplicated and confirmed those findings on FhuA and characterized comparable constructions from FepA, which gave almost identical results. Furthermore, when we genetically exchanged the N termini of FepA and FhuA, both hybrid proteins still bound and transported their appropriate ligands. Bacteria harboring plasmids (Table I) carrying the genes of interest were cultured in LB broth or MOPS minimal media (46Newton S.M. Igo J.D. Scott D.C. Klebba P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1153-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It was impractical to create single-copy chromosomal derivatives of the numerous constructs we generated. Instead, we individually transferred all of the genes, including wild type fepA andfhuA, to the low-copy plasmid pHSG575, which exists inE. coli at a level of two to three copies/cell (47Hashimoto-Gotoh T.

Open table in a new tab We used PCR to join the FepA N terminus (residues 1–152) to the FhuA C terminus (residues 160–723), and the FhuA N terminus (residues 1–155) to the FepA C terminus (residues 149–724). We first cloned the N- and C-terminal domains offepA and fhuA and then ligated them together. For instance, for FepNFhuβ, we PCR-amplified the DNA encoding FepN, incorporating PstI and BamHI sites in the forward and reverse primers, respectively, and inserted the product into the low copy plasmid pHSG575 (47Hashimoto-Gotoh T. Franklin F.C. Nordheim A. Timmis K.N. Gene. 1981; 16: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We then PCR-amplified the DNA encoding Fhuβ, flanked by BamHI and SacI restriction sites, and ligated it to FepN DNA in pHSG575. Additionally, we employed oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene, San Diego, CA) to delete residues 17–150 of fepA (creating Fepβ), residues 3–150 of fepA (Fepβ2), and residues 5–160 of fhuA (Fhuβ). Except when noted, fepA,fhuA, and their derivatives were all analyzed on pHSG575, which was used for binding, nutrition, and transport experiments. The adsorption of [59Fe]Ent and [59Fe]Fc was measured with metabolically inactive KDF541 (46Newton S.M. Igo J.D. Scott D.C. Klebba P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1153-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) expressing FepA or FhuA, respectively. [59Fe]Ent and [59Fe]Fc were prepared at a specific activity of ∼200 cpm/pm and chromatographically purified. Binding manipulations were performed at 0 °C. A mid-log bacterial culture was chilled on ice for 1 h, and an aliquot (containing ∼5 × 107 cells) was pipetted into a 50-ml test tube and incubated on ice. 25-ml volumes of ice-cold MOPS minimal media, containing varying concentrations of [59Fe]-siderophore, were poured into the tubes to achieve rapid and thorough mixing. After 1 min the binding reactions, which were performed in triplicate, were filtered through 0.45-μm nitrocellulose, the filters were washed with 10 ml of 0.9% LiCl and counted in a Packard Cobra gamma counter. The initial adsorption reaction reached equilibrium within 5 s at physiological temperatures and within 1 min on ice. The FepA-deficient strain KDF541 was simultaneously tested as a negative control, and any nonspecific adsorption of [59Fe]siderophores by this strain was subtracted from the experimental samples. Whenever necessary because of low cpm bound, the assay samples were counted for an extended period of time (up to 30 min) to decrease standard error. Binding data were analyzed using the Bound versus Total equation of Grafit 4.013 (Erithacus Ltd., Middlesex, UK). Ferric siderophore uptake was qualitatively evaluated by nutrition tests (46Newton S.M. Igo J.D. Scott D.C. Klebba P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1153-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and the transport of [59Fe]Ent and [59Fe]Fc was quantitatively measured in live bacteria (46Newton S.M. Igo J.D. Scott D.C. Klebba P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1153-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For ferric siderophore acquisition (and general and specific porin-mediated transport as well (48Nikaido H. Vaara M. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 1-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), the outer membrane transport stage constitutes the rate-limiting step of the overall uptake process (4Klebba P.E. Newton S.M.

Therefore, our transport data describe the outer membrane components of the process, FepA, FhuA, and their mutant derivatives. Transport manipulations were performed at 37 °C. A volume of mid-log bacterial culture (50–100 μl containing ∼5 × 107cells) was pipetted into a 50-ml test tube and incubated in a 37 °C water bath. Without delay, 25 ml of prewarmed MOPS minimal media, containing glucose (0.2%), appropriate nutritional supplements, and varying concentrations of [59Fe]siderophores, were poured into the tube to achieve rapid and thorough mixing. The transport reactions were quenched by the addition of a 1000-fold excess of nonradioactive ferric siderophores, immediately filtered through 0.45-μm nitrocellulose, and the filters were washed with 10 ml of 0.9% LiCl and counted in a Packard Cobra gamma counter. Kinetic parameters were determined from the initial rates of uptake, which were calculated at each substrate concentration from two independent measurements made in triplicate at 5 and 15 s: cpm bound to the cells at 5 s were subtracted from the cpm associated with the cells at 15 s (10-s uptakes). For some mutants with low uptake rates (FepNFhuβ, FhuNFepβ, Fepβ) we extended the uptake period to 60 min (6Thulasiraman P. Newton S.M. Xu J. Raymond K.N. Mai C. Hall A. Montague M.A. Klebba P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6689-6696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In all transport experiments, the FepA-deficient strain KDF541 was simultaneously tested as a negative control, and any nonspecific adsorption of [59Fe]Ent by this strain was subtracted from the experimental samples. Transport results were analyzed according to the Michaelis-Menten equation, using Grafit 4.013. Serial dilutions of colicins B, D, or M, and bacteriophage T5 and φ80 were prepared in LB broth in microtiter plates, and 5-μl volumes of the dilutions were transferred to LB plates seeded with the strain of interest, using a Clonemaster (Immusine Corp., San Leandro, CA). The titer of the phage and colicins was expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution that cleared the bacterial lawn. Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE gels (52Murphy C.K. Kalve V.I. Klebba P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2736-2746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and either stained with Coomassie Blue or electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose paper. Western immunoblots were incubated with anti-FepA mAbs 26 or 45 (52), developed with 125I-protein A (49Cao Z. Qi Z. Sprencel C. Newton S.M. Klebba P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1306-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), quantitated by image analysis with a Packard Instant Imager, and visualized by exposure of x-ray films. The former antibody recognizes an epitope in the N-terminal globular domain of FepA (bounded by residues 27and 37 (52)); the latter binds in loop 4 of the C-terminal barrel domain, near residue 329 (49Cao Z. Qi Z. Sprencel C. Newton S.M. Klebba P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1306-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar,52Murphy C.K. Kalve V.I. Klebba P.E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2736-2746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For native gel electrophoresis, 50 μg of OM or 2 μg of purified protein was resuspended in LDS sample buffer and sonicated in an ice water bath for 5 min. After a 1-min centrifugation in a microcentrifuge, the samples were electrophoresed overnight at 5 mA and 4 °C on LDS-PAGE gels (53Liu J. Rutz J.M. Feix J.B. Klebba P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10653-10657Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The expression of FepA and its mutants was quantitated by Western immunoblots of whole cell lysates with anti-FepA monoclonal antibodies 26 and 45 and125I-protein A. Protein concentrations were determined by image analysis, relative to standards. The localization of the chimeric proteins was determined by fractionation of inner and outer membranes on sucrose gradients (54Smit J. Kamio Y. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 124: 942-958Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), followed by Western immunoblots of the fractions. Purified OM fragments or purified, denatured FepA, were suspended in 10 mm ammonium acetate, 10 mm ammonium carbonate, pH 8.3, at 10 and 0.5 μg/ml, respectively, dispensed into microtiter plates (Immulon), and incubated at 4 °C overnight. All further incubation steps were performed at 25 °C. In the morning, excess or unabsorbed antigen was removed by three washes with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4 (TBS-Tween), and the plates were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in TBS for 30 min. The plates were washed three times with TBS-Tween, and serial dilutions of anti-FepA mAbs in 50 μl of blocking buffer were added and incubated for 1 h. The blocking buffer was removed and 50 μl of a 1/100 dilution of goat-anti-mouse immunoglobulin-alkaline phosphatase (Sigma Chemical Co.) in blocking buffer was added to the plates. After incubation for 1 h at 25 °C, the plates were washed three times and developed with 50 μl of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (1 mg/ml, Sigma). After a 1-h incubation at 25 °C, 50 μl of 2n NaOH was added to stop the reaction and absorbance was measured at 405 nm with a microplate reader. Bacteria grown in MOPS minimal media or sucrose gradient-purified OM fractions were suspended at 109 cells/ml or 10 mg/ml, respectively, in 4 mmSulfoEGS, a water-soluble homobifunctional cross-linker (Mr 661 Da) that preferentially reacts with primary amines, for 2 h at 0 °C. The compound contains a 16-Å spacer arm, which is cleaved by reaction with hydroxylamine. After cross-linking, cells or OM proteins were solubilized in sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Blue. When indicated, 5 μm ferric enterobactin was added to the cells prior to cross-linking. Cross-linked bands were excised from the gels, cleaved with hydroxylamine, electroeluted, and re-electrophoresed: The identity of the cross-linked proteins was determined by sequence analysis of their N-terminal 15 residues (Protein and Nucleic Acid Sequence Facility, Medical College of Wisconsin). To understand the basis of ligand specificity in FepA and FhuA, we switched their N-terminal domains and biochemically characterized the resulting hybrid proteins. Although Braun et al. (45Braun M. Killmann H. Braun V. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 1037-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) reported the ability of an N-terminal deletion of FhuA to transport, they did not consider the affinity of the mutant for its ligands, nor the kinetic parameters of the uptake process. Our experiments duplicated their construction, created comparable deletion mutants of FepA, and created the two chimeric proteins that switched the N-domains of FepA and FhuA. In the latter case, the protein engineering conserved three structural features of FepA and FhuA: the globular N-domain, the β-barrel of the C-domain, and the β-turn that joins them (Fig.1). The resulting clones avoided the deletion or introduction of amino acids in the junction sequence: FepNFhuβ contained the N terminus and β-turn of FepA connected to the β-barrel of FhuA; FhuNFepβ contained the N terminus of FhuA linked to the β-turn and β-barrel of FepA. The hybrid proteins functioned with unexpected efficiency and selectivity, conferred by the β-barrels and their loops. The N-terminal domains did not affect the discrimination of ferric siderophores. FhuNFepβ bound FeEnt but not Fc, whereas FepNFhuβ bound Fc but not FeEnt. FepA adsorbs FeEnt with subnanomolar affinity, which persevered in the FhuNFepβ chimera: The Kdof its binding reaction with FeEnt was 0.2 nm (Fig.2, TableII). The reverse hybrid (FepNFhuβ) bound Fc with equivalent affinity to that of wild type FhuA: The Kd of its binding reaction with Fc was 0.6 nm (Fig. 2, TableII). So, despite their heterologous N termini, the chimeras maintained the selectivity of their β-barrels, with the affinity of wild type receptors.Table IIBiochemical properties of FepA and FepA mutantsStrain/plasmidFerric enterobactinProtein ligands2-aColicin and bacteriophage susceptibility was determined by measuring the killing of KDF541 expressing the wild type and mutant proteins by limiting dilutions of colicins B, D, and M, and phage T5 and φ80.

Generally, mitochondrial isoacceptor tRNAs all have the same genetic origin. One known exception to this rule is the group of tRNAGly isoacceptors in dicotyledonous plants. A mitochondrion-encoded tRNAGly and at least one nucleus-encoded tRNAGly coexist in the mitochondria of these plants, and both are required to allow translation of all four GGN glycine codons. We have taken advantage of this atypical situation to address the problem of tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase coevolution in plants. In this work, we show that two different nucleus-encoded glycyl-tRNA synthetases (GlyRSs) are imported into Arabidopsis thalianaand Phaseolus vulgaris mitochondria. The first one, GlyRS-1, is similar to human or yeast glycyl-tRNA synthetase, whereas the second, GlyRS-2, is similar to Escherichia coliglycyl-tRNA synthetase. Both enzymes are dual targeted, GlyRS-1 to mitochondria and to the cytosol and GlyRS-2 to mitochondria and chloroplasts.

In plants, protein synthesis occurs in three cellular compartments: the cytosol, the mitochondria, and the chloroplasts. All tRNAs and aaRSs necessary for mRNA translation have to be present in these three compartments. In photosynthetic plants, cytosolic tRNAs are all nucleus-encoded, and chloroplastic tRNAs are all chloroplast-encoded (1Maréchal-Drouard L. Weil J.H. Dietrich A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 13-32Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). By contrast, plant mitochondrial tRNAs have several genetic origins. Some are nucleus-encoded and imported from the cytosol. The others are mitochondrion-encoded and show 70–75% identity with their prokaryotic counterparts and less than 60% identity with their cytosolic counterparts. These mitochondrion-encoded tRNAs are of two types: the “native” tRNAs derived from authentic mitochondrial tRNA genes and the “chloroplast-like” tRNAs that are 97–100% identical to their chloroplast counterparts. The genes corresponding to the latter originated from the chloroplast and were inserted into the mitochondrial genome during evolution. The number of tRNAs in each category (imported, native, or chloroplast-like) and their identity can vary from one plant species to another (2Dietrich A. Small I. Cosset A. Weil J.H. Maréchal-Drouard L. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1996; 78: 518-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar,3Kumar R. Maréchal-Drouard L. Akama K. Small I. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Higher plant aaRSs are all encoded by the nuclear genome and post-translationally addressed to the different subcellular compartments. The fidelity of translation relies in part on the specificity of the aminoacylation reaction catalyzed by the aaRSs. Thus, strong coevolution is expected between the aaRSs and their cognate tRNAs (4Ribas de Pouplana L. Frugier M. Quinn C. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 5Doolittle R. Handy J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 630-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A few plant genes coding for mitochondrial aaRSs have been characterized, and it appears that the aaRSs used in mitochondrial translation have, in general, the same genetic origin as their substrate tRNAs. This is the case for tRNAsAla, tRNAsThr, and tRNAsVal and their cognate aaRSs in Arabidopsis thaliana. These tRNAs are most likely to be imported from the cytosol into mitochondria in A. thaliana, because the corresponding genes are absent from the mitochondrial genome (6Unseld M. Marienfeld J.R. Brandt P. Brennicke A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar), and they were shown to be imported into mitochondria in other plants such as potato (3Kumar R. Maréchal-Drouard L. Akama K. Small I. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Similarly, cytosolic alanyl-tRNA synthetase (7Mireau H. Lancelin D. Small I. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1027-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), threonyl-tRNA synthetase, and valyl-tRNA synthetase (8Souciet G. Menand B. Ovesna J. Cosset A. Dietrich A. Wintz H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) are also imported into mitochondria. In all three cases, the mitochondrial form and the cytosolic form of the enzyme are encoded by the same gene. Similarly, dual targeting to mitochondria and chloroplasts was observed for methionyl- (9Menand B. Maréchal-Drouard L. Sakamoto W. Dietrich A. Wintz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Maréchal-Drouard L. Cosset A. Dietrich A. Duchêne A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2037-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Coexistence of imported and organelle-encoded isoacceptor tRNAs in mitochondria has been reported only in a very few cases, i.e. tRNAsIle in higher plants (2Dietrich A. Small I. Cosset A. Weil J.H. Maréchal-Drouard L. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1996; 78: 518-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and tRNAsIle, tRNAsThr, and tRNAsVal inMarchantia polymorpha (15Akashi K. Tazkenaka M. Yamaoka S. Suyama Y. Fukuzama H. Ohyama K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2168-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The presence of isoacceptor tRNAs with different genetic origins in plant mitochondria raises the problem of the coevolution between tRNAs and aaRSs. In this work, we show that, along with the coexistence in the organelles of a cytosolic and a native mitochondrial tRNAGly, two different glycyl-tRNA synthetases are imported into mitochondria in dicotyledonous plants. Both are dual targeted proteins, one to the cytosol and mitochondria (called glycyl-tRNA synthetase-1 (GlyRS-1)) and the other to chloroplasts and mitochondria (called GlyRS-2). Unexpectedly, GlyRS-1 was shown to be active in the bean cytosol but not in mitochondria, whereas GlyRS-2 was able to aminoacylate either nuclearly or mitochondrially encoded tRNAsGly. A. thaliana total DNA was extracted from whole plants according to Dellaporta et al. (16Dellaporta S.L. Wood J. Hicks J.B. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1983; 1: 19-21Crossref Scopus (6378) Google Scholar), digested with BglII, self-ligated, and used as a template for PCR amplification (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with divergent oligonucleotides AM10 (5′-GCGGGATCCGGATCGGAGCGATGGAGATTGGG-3′; theBamHI site for cloning is underlined) and AM12 (5′-CGCTCTAGAGGCTTCCCGTGCAGCTAAACCAG-3′; theXbaI site for cloning is underlined) (see Fig.1 A). Total RNA was extracted from 3-week-oldA. thaliana plants (18Goodall G.J. Wiebauer K. Filipowicz W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 181: 148-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and poly(A+) RNA was prepared using a PolyATtract mRNA isolation system IV kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Primer extensions were performed with oligonucleotide AM16 (5′-GGATCGGAGCGATGGAGATTGGG-3′) (see Fig.1 A) and with 1 μg of poly(A+) RNA or 12 μg of total RNA (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Sequencing reactions were primed with oligonucleotide AM16 (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Predictions of intracellular targeting of proteins were made using ChloroP, MITOPROT, Predotar, PSORT, or TargetP. Isolation of organelles from A. thaliana plants gave a very poor yield, and extensive cytosolic contamination was observed. Organelles were therefore mainly isolated from bean, and to a lesser extent from wheat and potato. Mitochondria were extracted from 3-week-old A. thaliana plants, from 5-day-old etiolated bean hypocotyls or wheat plantlets, or from potato tubers in extraction buffers containing 0.6m mannitol, 0.3 m sucrose, or 0.3 mmannitol, respectively, as an osmoticum (19Maréchal-Drouard L. Guillemaut P. Cosset A. Arbogast M. Weber F. Weil J.H. Dietrich A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3689-3696Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and were purified on continuous polyvinylpyrrolidone/Percoll gradients (20Neuburger M. Journet E.P. Bligny R. Carde J.P. Douce R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 217: 312-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). ForA. thaliana mitochondria, a second, discontinuous polyvinylpyrrolidone/Percoll gradient was necessary to reduce cytosolic contamination (14Brubacher-Kauffmann S. Maréchal-Drouard L. Cosset A. Dietrich A. Duchêne A.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2037-2042Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Chloroplasts were extracted from leaves of 6-day-old bean plants (21Robinson C. Barnet L.K. Shaw C.H. Plant Molecular Biology: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1988: 67-78Google Scholar). For protease treatment, mitochondria were incubated in the presence of 100 μg/ml proteinase K for 5 min at room temperature and 10 min on ice. Upon addition of 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, organelles were recovered by centrifugation through a cushion of 27% (w/v) sucrose, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For subfractionation, mitochondria were resuspended in 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and incubated on ice for 20 min to disrupt the outer membrane. Gentle homogenizing with a plunger was applied several times during incubation to help release of the outer membrane. The suspension was subsequently loaded on a 15/32/45/52% sucrose step gradient in a 10 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 2 mm EDTA and 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and centrifuged for 20 min at 125,000 × g. The outer membrane fraction and the mitoplasts were recovered at the 15/32% interface and the 45/52% interface, respectively. Both were washed in 10 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.3 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 5 mmglycine and pelleted for 10 min at 175,000 × g. Mitoplasts were resuspended in the same buffer and disrupted by three freeze/thaw cycles and two sonication cycles of 10 s. The suspension was successively centrifuged for 5 min at 2500 ×g, to eliminate the remaining undisrupted material, and for 30 min at 175,000 × g, to separate the inner membrane fraction from the matrix. Denatured protein extracts for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were prepared in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.3% (w/v) SDS, 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. Enzymatic extracts for aminoacylation and chromatography were prepared according to Maréchal-Drouard et al. (22Maréchal-Drouard L. Small I. Weil J.H. Dietrich A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 310-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Aminoacylations (19Maréchal-Drouard L. Guillemaut P. Cosset A. Arbogast M. Weber F. Weil J.H. Dietrich A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3689-3696Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) were performed in the presence of 10−4m[3H]glycine and 3 μg/μl yeast or Escherichia coli total tRNA, 0.15 μg/μl bean total leaf, mitochondrial, or chloroplastic tRNA (22Maréchal-Drouard L. Small I. Weil J.H. Dietrich A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 310-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), or 0.04 μg/μl in vitrotranscribed tRNAGly. The sequence corresponding to the N terminus of GlyRS-1 (nucleotides 616–810 in Fig. 1 A) was amplified by PCR using the A. thaliana cDNA as a template and oligonucleotides SIGM.5 (5′-GATCTCTAGAAAAATGCGCATCTTCTCTACA-3′; theXbaI site is underlined) and SIGM.3 (5′-CATGCTCGAGAGTTACCCTGAGCTTCGAC-3′; the XhoI site is underlined). To fuse this sequence with the GFP gene, the PCR products were cloned into the SpeI/SalI sites of pOL-GFP-S65C (11Peeters N.M. Chapron A. Giritch A. Grandjean O. Lancelin D. Lhomme T. Vivrel A. Small I. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 50: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), generating pSYGM in which the first AUG of the GlyRS-1 sequence was in a favorable context for initiation of translation. The sequence corresponding to the N terminus of GlyRS-2 (GenBankTM accession number AJ003069, nucleotides 32–275) was amplified by PCR using A. thaliana total DNA as a template and oligonucleotides SIGO.5 (5′-GATCTCTAGAAAAATGGCCATCCTCCATT-3′; the XbaI site is underlined) and SIGO.3 (5′-CATGCTCGAGCCTGGAGGCGTTGAA-3′; the XhoI site is underlined). The PCR products were cloned into theSpeI/SalI sites of pOL-GFP-S65C, generating pSYGO. The complete expression cassette containing the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter, the GFP fusion, and the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S terminator was cut out of pSYGM and pSYGO withHindIII and cloned into the binary vector pGPTV-kan (23Becker D. Kemper E. Schell J. Masterson R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 20: 1195-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids, pNP7 and pNP8, respectively, were used to transform the Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404 strain (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transformation was performed by infiltration of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves (24Rubino L. Weber-Lotfi F. Dietrich A. Stussi-Garaud C. Russo M. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with a suspension of A. tumefaciens carrying pNP7 or pNP8. After 25–30 h, protoplats were prepared (25Nagy J.I. Maliga P. Z. Pflanzenphysiol. 1976; 78: 453-455Crossref Google Scholar) from the infiltrated leaves. Protoplasts were stained with a mitochondria-specific dye (MitoTrackerTM, CMTMRos, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and analyzed using an epifluorescence microscope (9Menand B. Maréchal-Drouard L. Sakamoto W. Dietrich A. Wintz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11014-11019Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The sequence corresponding to the N terminus of GlyRS-1 (nucleotides 616–742 in Fig. 1 A) was first amplified by PCR using the A. thaliana cDNA clone as a template and oligonucleotides AM26 (5′-CGCGCCATGGGCATCTTCTCTACATTCGTCTTTCATCGC-3′; theNcoI site is underlined) and AM36 (5′-CGCGGATCCTCGGCGTCAATCGGAATCTGGATC-3′; theBamHI site is underlined). This introduced a point mutation at position 735, replacing the second AUG codon with an AUU isoleucine codon. The PCR products were cloned into theNcoI/BamHI sites of pCK-GFP3 (9Menand B. Maréchal-Drouard L. Sakamoto W. Dietrich A. Wintz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11014-11019Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), yielding a GFP fusion. The obtained plasmid was named pAM160. TheEcoRI/HindIII fragments from pAM160 and pSYGO (see above), which contained the tobacco etch virus translation leader, the GlyRS-1 or GlyRS-2 N terminus, the GFP gene, and the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S terminator, were cloned into pBlueScript-KS (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). These constructs were used as templates forin vitro transcription/translation carried out with a TNTTM coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. Import of35S-labeled fusion proteins into purified potato mitochondria was performed according to Wischmann and Schuster (26Wischmann C. Schuster W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The sequence of the cytosolic form (690 amino acids) of GlyRS-1 was amplified by PCR using the A. thaliana cDNA as a template and oligonucleotides AM19 (5′-CGCGCCATGGACGCCACCGAGCAGTCTCTC-3′; theNcoI site is underlined) and AM20 (5′-GGCGGATCCGTCTGCAGCAGCAGAAGAATG-3′; the BamHI site is underlined) and cloned into pQE60 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The resulting plasmid, pAM147, was used to transform theE. coli TG2 strain (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Overexpression in E. coli was induced with 2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Protein extraction under denaturing conditions was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Extracts were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The polypeptide corresponding to GlyRS-1 was electroeluted from the gels (27Nguyen N.Y. Chrambach A. Hames B.D. Rickwood D. Gel Electrophoresis of Proteins. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1981: 150-151Google Scholar) and injected into rabbits to raise antibodies. Alternately, native enzymatic extracts (22Maréchal-Drouard L. Small I. Weil J.H. Dietrich A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 310-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) were prepared from the E. coli strain overexpressing GlyRS-1 and used for liquid chromatography fractionation. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electrotransferred onto ImmobilonTM-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and submitted to immunological detection following classical protocols (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Antisera were used at a 1/5000 dilution. Antibodies against mitochondrial superoxide dismutase were a gift from Dirk Inzé(Gent, Belgium), and antibodies against α-tubulin were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Antisera against bean chloroplastic leucyl-tRNA synthetase were obtained previously (28Souciet G. Dietrich A. Colas B. Razafimahatratra P. Weil J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9598-9604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of the primary antibodies was revealed by chemiluminescence using peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Enzymatic extracts were fractionated by medium pressure chromatography on a 1-ml POROS 20 PE hydrophobic column (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) driven by a BioLogic integrated system (Bio-Rad). The samples (1 mg of proteins) adjusted to 1.5 m ammonium sulfate were loaded at 1 ml/min on the column equilibrated with a 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1.5 m ammonium sulfate, 1 mmMgCl2, 5% (v/v) 1,2-propanediol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmdiisopropylfluorophosphate. After washing with the same buffer (5 ml), elution was performed at 1 ml/min with a linear ammonium sulfate gradient (10 ml, 1.5 to 0 m). Fractions of 0.33 ml were collected, and aliquots were submitted to aminoacylation assays and Western blot analyses. Enzymatic extracts were also fractionated on a 1.3-ml UNOTM-Q1 anion exchange column (Bio-Rad). The samples were loaded at 0.5 ml/min on the column equilibrated with a 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10 mmNaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5% (v/v) 1,2-propanediol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mmdiisopropylfluorophosphate. Elution was performed at 0.7 ml/min with a 15-ml linear gradient from 10 to 500 mm NaCl, followed by a 5-ml linear gradient from 500 to 1000 mm NaCl. Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. Constructs encoding tRNAsGly were amplified by PCR with the relevant primers (see below) so that the tRNA gene sequence was directly fused to the T7 RNA polymerase promoter at the 5′ terminus and to aBstNI site at the 3′ terminus. PCR products were cloned into the EcoRI or EcoRI/BamHI sites of pUC19. After BstNI digestion, in vitrotranscription of these constructs with T7 RNA polymerase yielded mature sized, unmodified tRNA transcripts with a 3′ CCA end (29Dietrich A. Maréchal-Drouard L. Carneiro V. Cosset A. Small I. Plant J. 1996; 10: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were used as primers (EcoRI andBamHI sites are underlined; the T7 RNA polymerase promoter or BstNI site is in italics): for mitochondrial native tRNAGly(GCC), 5′ AGCAAGAATTC GAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGCGGAAATAGCTTAATGGTAG 3′ and 5′ GTACA GAATTC CCTGGAGCGGAAGGAGGGACTTGAAC 3′; for cytosolic tRNAGly(GCC), 5′ AGCAAGAATTC GAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGCACCAGTGGTCTAGTGGTAG 3′ and 5′ GTACAGAATTC CCTGGTGCACCAGCCGGGAATCGAAC 3′; for cytosolic tRNAGly(UCC), 5′ GCAAGAATTC GAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGCGTCTGTAGTCCAACGGTTAG 3′ and 5′ CGCGGATCC TGGTGCGTCTGCCGGGAGTCGAAC 3′. By analysis of cDNAs and inverse PCR products, we characterized a eukaryotic-type GlyRS gene in A. thaliana(GenBankTM accession number AJ002062) (30Duchêne A.M. Dietrich A. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1730Google Scholar), and we termed this gene GlyRS-1. For this, an A. thaliana cDNA library (Strasbourg, France) was screened using as a probe an A. thaliana expressed sequence tag clone (GenBankTM accession number 117F7T7) (31Newman T. de Bruijn F. Keegstra K. Kende H. McIntosh L. Ohlrogge J. Raikhel N. Somerville S. Thomashow M. Retzel E. Somerville C. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 1241-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) showing similarity with known GlyRS genes. Several incomplete cDNAs, lacking the 5′ end, were recovered from this screening. The 5′ region of the gene (Fig.1 A) was cloned from A. thaliana genomic DNA by using inverse PCR. Southern blot analysis (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) of total A. thaliana DNA digested with PstI,BglII, or EcoRI suggested that theGlyRS-1 gene is a single copy gene (data not shown), which was confirmed with the availability of the complete A. thaliana genomic sequence ((32); see the ArabidopsisGenome Initiative web site). A second gene showing similarities with GlyRS-1 and other eukaryotic GlyRS sequences was previously identified in the A. thaliana genome (GenBankTM accession number AC002534). However, this second gene was considered to be a pseudogene, because the sequence is partial, it contains a number of frameshifts, and no corresponding expressed sequence tags could be detected. The full GlyRS-1 coding sequence is 729 amino acids long. It is similar to other known eukaryotic GlyRS sequences (more than 45% amino acid identity and 60% similarity with Homo sapiens, Bombyx mori, and Caenorhabditis elegans GlyRS sequences) and presents no obvious similarity with prokaryotic GlyRS sequences such as the E. coli GlyRS, suggesting a cytosolic localization. A multiple alignment of GlyRS sequences is available on our web site devoted to A. thaliana tRNAs and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (web site address available from the corresponding author). The high level of similarity between GlyRS-1 and eukaryotic GlyRSs suggests that the native enzyme probably has an α2 quaternary structure, like other eukaryotic GlyRSs. The presence of a mitochondrial targeting peptide at the N-terminal end of the coding sequence was predicted by computer analysis. MITOPROT, Predotar, PSORT, and TargetP gave a score of 0.88, 0.90, 0.76, and 0.91, respectively, for a mitochondrial localization. Alignment of the GlyRS-1 amino acid sequence with that of the other GlyRS sequences starts around the end of the potential targeting sequence. It should also be noticed that a dual localization in the cytosol and in mitochondria was proposed for two homologs of GlyRS-1, in humans (33Mudge S.J. Williams J.H. Eyre H.J. Suthereland G.R. Cowan P.J. Power D.A. Gene. 1998; 209: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 34Shiba K. Schimmel P. Motegi H. Noda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30049-30055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (35Turner R.J. Lovato M. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27681-27688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Expression of the GlyRS-1 gene was investigated by primer extension. The results shown in Fig. 1 B indicate that there are two major transcripts with different 5′ ends that map 22 nucleotides upstream and 15 nucleotides downstream, respectively, of the first putative AUG initiation codon. The sequence shows a second in-frame AUG, 40 codons downstream of the first initiator AUG. This second AUG maps near the position corresponding to the C-terminal end of the predicted mitochondrial targeting peptide. The 5′ end of the shortest mRNA is located upstream of the second in-frame AUG codon, which could thus be used to initiate translation on this transcript, leading to the synthesis of a short, cytosolic form of GlyRS-1 (690 amino acids, 76 kDa). Translation of the long transcript could generate a long protein (729 amino acids, 80 kDa) with a putative mitochondrial targeting peptide. An expressed GlyRS gene of prokaryotic-type (GenBankTMaccession number AJ003069) was characterized by Uwer et al.(36Uwer U. Willmitzer L. Altmann T. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1277-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) upon analysis of an A. thaliana embryo development mutant due to a unique insertion of a DsA transposable element. The corresponding protein, which is 1068 amino acids long, has no significant similarity with GlyRS-1 but presents regions similar to the α and β subunits of E. coli GlyRS (59% identity with the α subunit and 36% identity with the β subunit), so that a dimeric structure of GlyRS-2 would reflect the tetrameric α2β2 structure of E. coli GlyRS. An alignment of the GlyRS-2 sequence with other GlyRS sequences is also available on our web site. Prediction of the subcellular localization run with ChloroP, Predotar, and TargetP gave a score of 0.57, 0.98, and 0.82, respectively, for a chloroplastic localization of GlyRS-2, and this enzyme was indeed shown to be imported into chloroplasts (36Uwer U. Willmitzer L. Altmann T. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1277-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, the corresponding GlyRS mutant has an embryo lethal phenotype. Embryo growth was stopped between the globular and heart stages of embryonic development, and germination of mutant seeds was never observed. Such a phenotype was not expected for a plastid enzyme, and the function of this GlyRS during plastidic translation does not provide a direct hint to its role during embryogenesis (36Uwer U. Willmitzer L. Altm"

NE also activates calcium influx and calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II-dependent cytosolic phospholipase A2(cPLA2). Arachidonic acid (AA) released by cPLA2-catalyzed phospholipid hydrolysis is then metabolized into hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) through lipoxygenase and cytochrome P450 4A (CYP4A) pathways. HETEs, in turn, have been shown to stimulate Ras translocation and to increase MAPK activity in VSMC. This study was conducted to determine the contribution of cPLA2-derived AA and its metabolites (HETEs) to the activation of PLD. NE-induced PLD activation was reduced by two structurally distinct CaM antagonists, W-7 and calmidazolium, and by CaM-dependent protein kinase II inhibition. Blockade of cPLA2 activity or protein depletion with selective cPLA2 antisense oligonucleotides abolished NE-induced PLD activation. The increase in PLD activity elicited by NE was also blocked by inhibitors of lipoxygenases (baicalein) and CYP4A (17-octadecynoic acid), but not of cyclooxygenase (indomethacin). AA and its metabolites (12(S)-, 15(S)-, and 20-HETEs) increased PLD activity. PLD activation by AA and HETEs was reduced by inhibitors of Ras farnesyltransferase (farnesyl protein transferase III and BMS-191563) and MEK (U0126 and PD98059). These data suggest that HETEs are the mediators of cPLA2-dependent PLD activation by NE in VSMC. In addition to cPLA2, PLD was also found to contribute to AA release for prostacyclin production via the phosphatidate phosphohydrolase/diacylglycerol lipase pathway. Finally, a catalytically inactive PLD2 (but not PLD1) mutant inhibited NE-induced PLD activity, and PLD2 was tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to NE by a MAPK-dependent pathway. We conclude that NE stimulates cPLA2-dependent PLD2 through lipoxygenase- and CYP4A-derived HETEs via the Ras/ERK pathway by a mechanism involving tyrosine phosphorylation of PLD2 in rabbit VSMC.

Chem. 1996; 271: 30149-30157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In addition, Ca2+, calmodulin (CaM), and CaM-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) are required for NE-induced cPLA2 activation (4Nebigil C. Malik K.U. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 266: 1113-1124Google Scholar, 5Muthalif M.M. Benter I.F. Karzoun N. Fatima S. Harper J. Uddin M.R. Malik K.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12701-12706Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). AA, the product of cPLA2 activity, is metabolized by three distinct pathways: cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, and cytochrome P450. 12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) and 15-HETE (lipoxygenase metabolites) as well as 20-HETE (a cytochrome P450 4A (CYP4A) metabolite) are produced in VSMC (5Muthalif M.M. Benter I.F. Karzoun N. Fatima S. Harper J. Uddin M.R. Malik K.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12701-12706Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). NE also stimulates phospholipase D (PLD) activity in blood vessels (6Llahi S. Fain J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3679-3685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PLD catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine into phosphatidic acid and choline. Phosphatidic acid can be hydrolyzed by cPLA2 or sequentially metabolized by phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (PPH) and diacylglycerol (DAG) lipase to release additional AA (7Billah M.M. Anthes J.C.

NE has been reported to increase PLD activity in rat tail artery, cerebral cortex, and cardiac myocytes through stimulation of α-adrenergic receptors (6Llahi S. Fain J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3679-3685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ye H. Wolf R.A. Kurz T. Corr B.P. Cardiovasc.

Whether PLD activation contributes to AA release and prostaglandin synthesis elicited by NE is not known. Moreover, the mechanism by which NE stimulates PLD activity has not been established. Activation of PLD by hormones and growth factors has been implicated in a wide range of cellular responses, including cellular trafficking, inflammatory and immune responses, mitogenesis, cellular differentiation, and apoptosis (see Ref. 11Daniel L.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 1-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar for a review). To date, two PLD isoforms, PLD1 and PLD2, have been cloned and characterized. PLD1 has a low basal activity and is up-regulated by small G proteins (Arf, Rho, and Ral), protein kinase C, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in vitro. In contrast, PLD2 has a high basal activity, requires phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and is also up-regulated by ARF and protein kinase C (11Daniel L.W. Biochim. Biophys.

PLD activation by angiotensin II in rat VSMC and by α-adrenergic receptor stimulation in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells has been reported to be independent of protein kinase C (17Freeman E.J.

Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, it has recently been demonstrated that NE stimulates PLD activity in rabbit VSMC via activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway by a protein kinase C-independent mechanism (14Muthalif M.M. Parmentier J.-H. Benter I.F. Karzoun N. Ahmed A. Khandekar Z. Adl M.Z. Bourgoin S. Malik K.U. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 268-274PubMed Google Scholar). In VSMC as well as in other cell types, NE is able to activate simultaneously both cPLA2 and PLD (3Muthalif M.M. Benter I.F. Uddin M.R. Malik K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30149-30157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 14Muthalif M.M. Parmentier J.-H. Benter I.F. Karzoun N. Ahmed A. Khandekar Z. Adl M.Z. Bourgoin S. Malik K.U. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 268-274PubMed Google Scholar). Two recent reports demonstrate that activation of PLD by the calcium ionophoreA23187 is strictly dependent on PLA2 in leukocytes (19Kim J.H. Lee B.D. Kim Y. Lee S.D. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 5462-5470PubMed Google Scholar) and human embryonic kidney 293 cells (20Ueno N. Murakami M. Kudo I. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, the nature of the mediator(s) downstream of PLA2 involved in PLD activation is not known. In rabbit VSMC, 20-HETE and, to a lesser extent, 12(S)- and 15(S)-HETEs, metabolites of AA generated by NE-induced CaMKII-dependent cPLA2activation, are able to stimulate MAPK activity (5Muthalif M.M. Benter I.F. Karzoun N. Fatima S. Harper J. Uddin M.R. Malik K.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12701-12706Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that NE stimulates PLD activity through a Ras/MAPK pathway (14Muthalif M.M. Parmentier J.-H. Benter I.F. Karzoun N. Ahmed A. Khandekar Z. Adl M.Z. Bourgoin S. Malik K.U. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 268-274PubMed Google Scholar) and that inhibition of cPLA2 activity blocks AA release (3Muthalif M.M. Benter I.F. Uddin M.R. Malik K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30149-30157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and attenuates the increase in MAPK activity elicited by NE in VSMC (5Muthalif M.M. Benter I.F. Karzoun N. Fatima S. Harper J. Uddin M.R. Malik K.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12701-12706Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Therefore, activation of PLD by MAPK in response to NE may be mediated by metabolites of AA. Activation of PLD, in turn, may further release AA for prostaglandin synthesis via the PPH/DAG lipase pathway. To test this hypothesis, we have investigated the effect of interventions that interfere with CaM, CaMKII, cPLA2activity, and AA metabolism on NE-induced increases in PLD activity in VSMC. We have also examined the effect of inhibitors of the PLD/PPH/DAG lipase pathway on NE-induced AA release and prostacyclin synthesis in these cells. For the first time in a primary cell culture, with an endogenous receptor and without overexpression of a phospholipase, we demonstrate a novel mechanism for PLD activation by NE involving CaMKII-dependent cPLA2 stimulation and generation of the AA metabolites 12(S), 15(S)-, and 20-HETEs, which, in turn, activate the Ras/ERK pathway. Finally, we show that PLD2 is activated and tyrosine-phosphorylated through an ERK-dependent pathway by NE in rabbit VSMC. [3H]AA was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [3H]Oleic acid was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). NE, timolol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, AA sodium salt, and oleic acid sodium salt were from Sigma. Methylarachidonyl fluorophosphonate and 12(S)-, 15(S)-, and 20-HETEs were from Cayman Chemical Co., Inc. (Ann Arbor, MI). W-7, calmidazolium, phosphatidylethanol, RHC-80267, propranolol, baicalein, indomethacin, 17-ODYA, and PD98059 were from BIOMOL Research Labs Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). 5,8,11,14-Eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA), KN-92, KN-93, arachidonyltrifluoromethyl ketone, FPT III, and BMS-191563 were from Calbiochem. U0126 was from Promega (Madison, WI). Aortas were rapidly removed from male New Zealand White rabbits, and the VSMC were isolated and cultured as described (2Nebigil C. Malik K.U. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 263: 987-995PubMed Google Scholar). Cells between passages 4 and 8 were plated in 24-well or 100-mm plates and maintained under 5% CO2 in M199 medium containing penicillin, streptomycin, Fungizone, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells in 100-mm dishes were transfected with wild-type (HA-tagged pCGN-PLD plasmids) and catalytically inactive mutant (K898R PLD1 and K758R PLD2; gifts from Dr. Michael Frohman, State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY) (21Sung T.C.

Briefly, 10 μg of DNA was combined with 250 μmCaCl2 and mixed with Hepes-buffered saline buffer. After 20 min of incubation, the solution mixture was slowly added to the cells in the presence of serum-free M199 medium and incubated for 6 h. Cells were then washed twice with Hanks' balanced saline solution and allowed to recover with M199 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 24 h. Cells were arrested overnight in 0.5% fetal bovine serum before the assays. Transfection efficiencies were measured by Western blot analysis. For experiments involving inhibition of protein synthesis, VSMC were transfected with antisense or sense oligonucleotides designed from cPLA2 or sPLA2 cDNA sequences (3Muthalif M.M. Benter I.F. Uddin M.R. Malik K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30149-30157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (synthesized at the Molecular Resource Center, University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN) were complexed with LipofectAMINE Plus reagents (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The oligonucleotide mixture was added to the cells for 24 h, and the medium was replaced with fresh M199 medium for another 24 h before the PLD assay. Efficiency of transfection with oligonucleotides was measured by Western blot analysis. PLD activity was assayed as described with slight modifications (14Muthalif M.M. Parmentier J.-H. Benter I.F. Karzoun N. Ahmed A. Khandekar Z. Adl M.Z. Bourgoin S. Malik K.U. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 293: 268-274PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, nearly confluent rabbit VSMC were incubated with [3H]oleic acid (1 μCi/ml) for 16 h. Cells were then incubated with inhibitors and exposed to NE, AA, or 12(S)-, 15(S)-, or 20-HETE for an additional 10 min. VSMC were scraped into 2 ml of ice-cold methanol and 2 m HCl, and lipids were extracted with chloroform. The aqueous and insoluble fractions were saved for determination of transfection efficiencies, and a 40-μl aliquot was removed from the chloroform phase to estimate the content of radioactivity in the total lipid fraction. 0.8 ml from the chloroform phase was evaporated under nitrogen and resuspended in 50 μl of chloroform/methanol (9:1) containing phosphatidylethanol standard. Samples were spotted onto a silica gel thin-layer chromatography plate, and lipids were separated using the solvent system chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (50:20:12.5:10:7.5). Phosphatidylethanol was identified by the mobility of authentic standard visualized with iodine vapor. Lanes containing phosphatidylethanol were scraped, and radioactivity was measured by scintillation spectroscopy. Data are expressed as the ratio of [3H]phosphatidylethanol to total 3H-labeled lipids. VSMC were labeled with [3H]AA (1 μCi/ml) in 24-well clusters for 18 h as previously described (3Muthalif M.M. Benter I.F. Uddin M.R. Malik K.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30149-30157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with inhibitors for 1–4 h, washed three times with Hanks' balanced saline solution, and exposed to NE or vehicle for 10 min. The amount of free 3H released into the medium and the total radioactivity in the cells were counted by liquid scintillation spectroscopy. 3H released into the medium was calculated as a percent of the total cellular radioactivity and is referred to as fractional release of [3H]AA. The content of 6-keto-PGF1α (the stable hydrolysis product of prostacyclin) was measured as described previously (4Nebigil C. Malik K.U. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1992; 266: 1113-1124Google Scholar). The efficiency of transient transfection with both oligonucleotides and plasmids was determined by Western blot analysis. Briefly, VSMC treated with oligonucleotides were washed twice and scraped into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in boiling Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated with anti-cPLA2 antibody (1:200 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 2 h at room temperature. The immunoblots were subsequently washed, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies, rinsed, and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For transfection efficiencies with HA-tagged pCGN-PLD plasmids, the top aqueous layer and insoluble fraction from the PLD assay were precipitated with 4 volumes of ice-cold acetone, incubated for 1 h at −80 °C, pelleted, and dried under nitrogen. The pellet was resuspended in boiling Laemmli sample buffer and treated as described above. HA-PLD expression was detected with an HA probe (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). VSMC were incubated with 10 μm NE in the presence of U0126 (10 μm) or its vehicle for 5 or 10 min. VSMC were then washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mmNaCl, 1% Igepal, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate)/100-mm Petri dish for 10 min on ice. The lysates were sonicated twice for 10 s and incubated at 4 °C for 10 min before centrifugation at 3000 rpm. The supernatant was incubated for 3 h with 7 μl of anti-PLD2 antibody (antiserum 26, a generous gift of Dr. Bourgoin, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec, Quebec, Canada) and for 1 h with protein A-agarose beads (Life Technologies, Inc.). The immunocomplex was centrifuged, washed once with lysis buffer and twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors, and dissolved in 6× Laemmli buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; transferred to nitrocellulose membranes; and probed with phospho-specific antibodies: anti-Tyr(P) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), anti-Ser(P) (Calbiochem), or anti-Thr(P) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoreactivity was detected with an ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Each blot was reprobed with anti-PLD2 antibody (antiserum 27). For the in vitro phosphorylation experiment, PLD2 was immunoprecipitated as described above and incubated with 25 units of activated ERK2 in MAPK buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA) in the presence of 15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 100 μm ATP for 10 and 20 min. Reactions products were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8% gel), dried, and detected by autoradiography. A positive control with immunoprecipitated PLD1 (14Muthalif M.M.

Results are expressed as the means ± S.D. from different batches of cells for PLD activity or arachidonic acid release. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. Student's t test was applied to determine the difference between treatments and their respective control values. The Newman-Keuls multiple range test was applied for comparison of treatments among multiple groups. The null hypothesis was rejected atp < 0.05. Activation of PLD by NE is dependent on extracellular calcium in VSMC (14Muthalif M.M. Parmentier J.-H. Benter I.F. Karzoun N. Ahmed A. Khandekar Z. Adl M.Z. Bourgoin S. Malik K.U. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Therefore, we studied the possible involvement of CaM and CaMKII in NE-induced PLD activation. The CaM inhibitors W-7 (10 μm) and calmidazolium (10 μm) reduced PLD activity elicited by NE in VSMC (Fig. 1). The CaMKII inhibitor KN-93 (Fig. 1), which blocks NE-induced CaMKII activity in VSMC (3Muthalif M.M. Benter I.F. Uddin M.R. Malik K.U. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) suggested the possibility of an involvement of cPLA2 in NE-induced PLD activation in VSMC. Treatment of VSMC with a generic PLA2 inhibitor, methylarachidonyl fluorophosphonate (24Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), and arachidonyltrifluoromethyl ketone, a selective cPLA2inhibitor (25Kuwata H. Nakatani Y. Murakami M. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1733-1740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), blocked PLD activation by NE (Fig.2 A). In addition, the selective depletion of endogenous cPLA2 with 1 μm cPLA2 antisense oligonucleotide for 48 h inhibited NE-induced PLD activity (Fig. 2 B). cPLA2 sense and sPLA2 sense and antisense oligonucleotides did not significantly alter NE-induced PLD activation. Therefore, it appears that cPLA2 (but not sPLA2) is involved in NE-induced PLD activation in VSMC. AA, the product of phospholipid hydrolysis formed by activation of cPLA2, stimulated PLD activity in a concentration-dependent manner, reaching a peak at 25 μm (Fig. 3). Oleic acid, another unsaturated fatty acid, at similar or higher concentrations did not stimulate PLD activity, indicating a specific role of cPLA2-formed AA and/or its metabolites in PLD activation. 25 μm AA also stimulated PLD activity after depletion of cPLA2 with antisense oligonucleotides (data not shown). ETYA (5 μm), a non-hydrolyzable analog of AA that acts as a competitive inhibitor of AA in vivo or in vitro(26Ekokoski E. Tornquist K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1223: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), reduced PLD activity elicited by NE (Fig. 2 A). ETYA also inhibited AA-induced increases in PLD by 66% (22% increaseversus 65% with AA alone), indicating that AA metabolites (but not the enzyme cPLA2 per se or AA) are responsible for PLD activation.Figure 3Effect of AA and oleate on PLD activity.[3H]Oleic acid-labeled VSMC were treated with different concentrations of AA or 50 μm oleic acid for 10 min.

To gain more insight into the mechanism of cPLA2-mediated PLD activation, we tested the effect of metabolites of AA generated via lipoxygenase (12(S)- and 15(S)-HETEs) and CYP4A (20-HETE) in VSMC on PLD activity. As shown in Fig. 4 B, 12(S)-, 15(S)-, and 20-HETEs (0.5 μm each) stimulated PLD activity approximately to the same extent as NE and AA. A stereoisomer of 12(S)-HETE (12(R)-HETE) had no effect on PLD activity (data not shown). In addition, AA- and HETE-induced PLD activity was not altered in antisense-directed cPLA2-depleted cells, and AA-induced PLD activity was inhibited by baicalein and 17-ODYA (data not shown). Based on these observations, we suggest that NE-induced PLD activation is cPLA2-dependent and"
https://openalex.org/W2031145183,"A 450-kDa human epidermal autoantigen was originally identified as a protein that reacted with the serum from an individual with a subepidermal blistering disease. Molecular cloning of this protein has now shown that it contains 5065 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 552 kDa. As reported previously this protein, which we call epiplakin, belongs to the plakin family, but it has some very unusual features. Epiplakin has 13 domains that are homologous to the B domain in the COOH-terminal region of desmoplakin. The last five of these B domains, together with their associated linker regions, are particularly strongly conserved. However, epiplakin lacks a coiled-coil rod domain and an amino-terminal domain, both of which are found in all other known members of the plakin family. Furthermore, no dimerization motif was found in the sequence. Thus, it is likely that epiplakin exists in vivo as a single-chain structure. Epitope mapping experiments showed that the original patient's serum recognized a sequence unique to epiplakin, which was not found in plectin. Immunofluorescence staining revealed the presence of epiplakin in whole sheets of epidermis and esophagus, in glandular cells of eccrine sweat and parotid glands and in mucous epithelial cells in the stomach and colon.

Clarification of the basic structure of desmoplakin has been followed by the identification of many related proteins, such as BPAG1,1 plectin, envoplakin, and periplakin (1Green K.J. Parry D.A.D.

These proteins form a family known as the “plakin family” (8Uitto J. Pulkkinen L. Smith F.J.D. McLean W.H.I. Exp. Dermatol... 1996; 5: 237-246Google Scholar). Almost all members of this family have a common structure, with predicted globular amino-terminal and COOH-terminal domains that are separated by a central rod domain. Some homologous domain structures have been identified in both globular domains of many plakins, while the central domain is rich in heptad repeats and is believed to form a parallel α-helical coiled-coil structure with a dimerization partner (9Green K.J. Virata M.L.A. Elgart G.W. Stanley J. Parry D.A.D. Int. J. Biol. Macromol... 1992; 14: 145-153Google Scholar). As suggested by this model, it has been demonstrated that desmoplakin I can form homodimersin vitro (10O'Keefe E.J. Erickson H.P. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem... 1989; 264: 8310-8318Google Scholar). Early investigations revealed that the COOH-terminal domains of plakins are involved in binding to intermediate filaments (11Stappenbeck T.S. Bornslaeger E.A. Corcoran C.M. Luu H.H. Virata M.L.A.

Wiche G. J. Cell Biol... 1996; 134: 1455-1467Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domains of desmoplakin and of BPAG1 are believed to bind to desmosomes or hemidesmosomes. Furthermore, some splicing variants of plectin and BPAG1 have actin- or microtubule-binding domains at their amino termini, and it has been proposed that these domains form cross-links between microfilaments and/or microtubules and intermediate filaments (14Yang Y. Dowling J., Yu, Q.C. Kouklis P. Cleveland D.W. Fuchs E. Cell.. 1996; 86: 655-665Google Scholar, 15Yang Y. Bauer C. Strasser G. Wollman R. Julien J.P. Fuchs E.

Studies of a few inheritable diseases that appear to involve plectin or desmoplakin and of a BPAG1 null mouse have shown that each plakin plays a critical role in the tissue integrity in specific tissues (5McLean W.H.I.

Degenstein L. Dowling J., Yu, Q.C. Wollmann R. Perman B. Fuchs E. Cell.. 1995; 81: 233-243Google Scholar). Moreover, it seems likely that, in many autoimmune blistering diseases, plakins, located in the epidermis, might be target antigens, and these plakins are used for markers of specific diseases (2Tanaka T. Parry D.A.D. Klaus-Kovtun V. Steinert P.M. Stanley J. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 12555-12559Google Scholar, 20Oursler J.R. Labib R.S. Ariss-Abdo L. Burke T. O'Keefe E.J. Anhalt G.J. J. Clin.

Amagai M. J. Invest. Dermatol... 1999; 112: 153-156Google Scholar). However, their pathological roles remain to be clarified. Several years ago we described an individual with a subepidermal blistering disease that resembled bullous pemphigoid both clinically and pathologically (23Fujiwara S. Shinkai H. Takayasu S. Owaribe K. Tsukita S. Kageshita T. J. Dermatol... 1992; 19: 610-613Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis revealed that the patient's serum did not react with the 230-kDa (BPAG1) and 180-kDa bullous pemphigoid antigens, whereas it did recognize a 450-kDa epidermal polypeptide. This polypeptide was expressed in human keratinocytes and in some transformed cell lines that included HeLa, KB, and A431 cells (24Fujiwara S. Kohno K. Iwamatsu A. Shinkai H. Dermatology.. 1994; 189: 120-122Google Scholar). In a preliminary study, to determine the molecular structure of this antigen, we screened a human keratinocyte cDNA library with the patient's serum. We isolated two kinds of cDNA: one encoding a protein that was strongly homologous to rat plectin and another encoding a protein, with partial homology to plectin, which appeared to be a novel and previously unidentified protein (25Fujiwara S. Kohno K. Iwamatsu A. Naito I. Shinkai H. J. Invest. Dermatol... 1996; 106: 1125-1130Google Scholar). We report here the cloning of the cDNA and determination of the entire structure of the novel protein, which we compare with other members of the plakin family. We also demonstrate the tissue localization of this protein, as determined by Northern blotting and immunostaining. In our previous study, it was unclear whether the epitope that was recognized by our patient's serum was a sequence that is present within plectin itself. In this study, therefore, we also identified the major epitope of the protein. A cDNA library prepared from HeLa cells (CLONTECH) was screened with the inserts of clones pE450-C and pE450-D, which had been isolated by extension cloning, using the same library, after the immunoscreening described in a previous report (25Fujiwara S. Kohno K. Iwamatsu A. Naito I. Shinkai H. J. Invest. Dermatol... 1996; 106: 1125-1130Google Scholar). For isolation of the 3′ end repeats, we constructed a cDNA library from the poly(A)+ RNA of HeLa cells. cDNA was synthesized with a cDNA synthesis kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). We modified the procedure provided with the kit by adding trehalose to the reaction for first-strand synthesis (26Carninci P. Nishiyama Y. Westover A. Itoh M. Nagaoka S. Sasaki N. Okazaki Y. Muramatsu M. Hayashizaki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1998; 95: 520-524Google Scholar) and, as specific primers for first-strand synthesis, we used 5′-CCAGACACAACAAGTATGCC-3′ for clone Ep115 and 5′-TAGCGCTTGACCGAGTCCATC-3′ for clone Ep 4. The cDNAs were ligated to an EcoRI adapter and then inserted into the EcoRI site of pUC 18 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for construction of plasmid libraries. Each library was screened with the specific probe. To confirm the size of 3′ end repetitive region and cover a small gap of the message, genomic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using primers 5′-TCGAGAAGCAGGAAACCA-3′ and 5′-CCATATGACACATAGACGAC-3′. To obtain some 5′-upstream cDNA sequences, we performed 5′-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) using the RACE System (Life Technologies) and total RNA from HeLa cells or the Marathon-Ready cDNAs System with adaptor-ligated double-stranded cDNA prepared from poly(A)+ RNA from HeLa cells (CLONTECH). The products of RACE were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). Each cDNA clone and genomic clone of interest was sequenced by a double-strand strategy with an automatic DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Internal primers were constructed for analysis of internal sequences. We searched various protein data bases, including Swiss-Prot and PIR, using the BLAST routine available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (Bethesda, MD). Furthermore, we also made comparisons using the COMPARE and DOTPLOT programs available from the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (Madison, WI). We also used the MATCH routine to identify regions of sequence homology among proteins. Determinations of plausible secondary structure were made using several predictive techniques and results are presented here only in a preliminary form. Short regions of heptad substructure were delineated by hand rather than by direct computer analysis since the former method facilitated location of discontinuities in heptad phasing. Potential interchain ionic interactions between charged residues at positions 2d′-1g, 1g′-2e, 2a′-1g, 1g′-2a, 1e′-1d, and 1d′-1e were considered as a function of relative chain stagger and chain polarity (27McLachlan A.D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol... 1975; 98: 293-304Google Scholar, 28Parry D.A.D. Crewther W.G. Fraser R.D.B. MacRae T.P. J. Mol. Biol... 1977; 113: 449-454Google Scholar). The notation 2d′-1g means that the residue at position d of the second heptad of chain n′ interacts with that in position g of the first heptad of chain n. Overlapping peptides were synthesized on derivatized cellulose membranes with Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) amino acids according to the protocol from the manufacturer of the system (Auto spot robot ASP222; ABIMED Analysen-Technik GmbH, Langenfeld, Germany) (29Frank R. Overwin H. Methods Mol. Biol... 1996; 66: 49-169Google Scholar, 30Appel J.R. Pinilla C. Niman H. Houghten R.A. J. Immunol... 1990; 144: 976-983Google Scholar). The ASP222 software program was used to generate the amino acid sequences of decapeptides and the spotting schedule for each cycle of addition of an amino acid. Peptides spanning amino acid residues 2807–3337 of epiplakin were synthesized on cellulose membranes as a series of decapeptides with an overlap of eight amino acids. This region includes one of five highly conserved COOH-terminal repeats. The first cDNA clone that we obtained by immunoscreening encoded a part of this domain. To refine the definition of the epitope within the sequence LVPAKDQPGRQEKMSIYQAMWKGVLRPGT, we synthesized a series of decapeptides with an overlap of nine amino acids were synthesized on cellulose membranes. Enzyme immunoassays of the peptides on the cellulose membranes were performed with our patient's serum, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies against human IgG, and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium. All reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad. The target peptides, namely peptide A (MSIYQAMWKGVLC), peptide B (TKGFFDPNTHENC), and peptide C (VKRYLEGTSCIAGVLVP), were synthesized by a solid-phase method (31Hudson D. J. Org. Chem... 1988; 53: 617-624Google Scholar). Peptide chains were elongated using an automated peptide synthesizer (model 9050; Millipore/Biosearch, Marlborough, MA) according to the standard operating programs. Peptides were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography on a reverse-phase column (Delta PakC18; Waters) with a Multisolvent Delivery System (600E; Waters). Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient from water to acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The molecular mass and amino acid sequence of each purified peptide were confirmed by determinations of the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometer (Kompact MALDI II; Kratos-Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan) and a protein sequencer (491CLC; Applied Biosystems). Each synthetic peptide (2 mg) was conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA; 10 mg; Sigma) usingN-(4-maleimidobutyryloxy)succinimide (2 mg; Dojin, Kumamoto, Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The ELISA was performed with microplates and BSA-conjugated peptides A, B, and C. Wells of microtiter plates (Nunc A/S, Kamstrupvej, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with 50 ng of synthetic peptide that had been conjugated to BSA (0.5 μg/ml in PBS) with incubation at 4 °C overnight. After incubation with PBS that contained 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature to block nonspecific binding, samples of serum (diluted 1:200 or serial 2-fold dilutions in PBS-T that contained 1% BSA) were added to the wells. After a 1-h incubation with shaking at room temperature, the wells were washed three times with PBS-T, and 100 μl of a solution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies against human IgG antibody (Bio-Rad) that had been diluted to 1:1000 in PBS-T were added. After incubation for 1 h with shaking at room temperature, the wells were washed three times with PBS-T and twice with PBS. After a 1-h incubation with the substrate solution at room temperature, absorbance (405 nm) was determined with a SOFTMAX system (Molecular Devices Co., Sunnyvale, CA). The absorbance obtained with each synthetic peptide was corrected by subtraction of the value due to reaction of the antibodies with BSA by itself. Epidermal extracts were obtained as described previously (23Fujiwara S. Shinkai H. Takayasu S. Owaribe K. Tsukita S. Kageshita T. J. Dermatol... 1992; 19: 610-613Google Scholar). After addition of dithiothreitol at a final concentration of 0.01 m, the solubilized proteins were separated by electrophoresis on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (5% polyacrylamide) and transferred to an Immobilon™ polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), which was probed with the original patient's serum or polyclonal antibodies against the synthetic peptide (see below) before or after incubation with the synthetic peptide. The cDNA that encoded a specific region of epiplakin was amplified by PCR with specific primers and subcloned in pGEX 4T-1 as an EcoRI fragment. The expression of the GST recombinant protein in Escherichia coli JM 109 was induced by 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 32 °C in LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin. After culture for 3 h with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, bacterial cells were harvested and lysed by sonication in PBS, with subsequent centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were incubated with 40 μl/ml glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at 20 °C. The glutathione-Sepharose beads were washed with elution buffer that contained 15 mmglutathione to elute the GST recombinant proteins. The amino acid sequence of the protein was confirmed with the automated sequencer after Western blotting of proteins on Immobilon™ membranes. Antibodies against a recombinant protein were raised in rats. The purified GST recombinant protein was mixed with an equal volume of Freund's complete or incomplete adjuvant. Initial subcutaneous injections contained 100 μg of recombinant protein (plus complete Freund's adjuvant) per rat. Two booster injections, each consisting of the same amount of protein (plus Freund's incomplete adjuvant) were given 1 and 2 weeks after the initial injection. The rats were bled 3 weeks after the second booster injection. The inguinal lymph nodes were dissected out for production of monoclonal antibodies. Purified peptide A (MSIYQAMWKGVLC) was conjugated with keyhole limpet hemocyanin using N-(4-maleimidobutyryloxy)succinimide and rabbits were immunized with the conjugate plus Freund's complete adjuvant. Antibodies (peptide A-specific antibodies) were purified by immunoaffinity gel chromatography on a peptide-immobilized column with absorption in 1 m NaCl (pH 7.5) and subsequent elution with 0.17 m Gly-HCl (pH 2.3) at room temperature. An RNA Master Blot (PT3004-1) was purchased from CLONTECH and Northern dot blotting was performed according to the protocol fromCLONTECH. The product of PCR obtained with 5′-GGCGCCAGGACCTGCTGA-3′ and 5′-CACCTTGCTGAGCCGCTCCT-3′ as primers and Ep12 as template was labeled with 32P and used as the specific probe for epiplakin mRNA. The product of PCR obtained with 5′-CCACACCACGGTGGACGA-3′ and 5′-ACTCAGCAGCTGCCTCTG-3′ as primers and pE 450-B as template was used as the specific probe for plectin mRNA (25Fujiwara S. Kohno K. Iwamatsu A. Naito I. Shinkai H. J. Invest. Dermatol... 1996; 106: 1125-1130Google Scholar). Ubiquitin cDNA was used as a control probe. Human tissues were obtained at biopsy or autopsy, embedded into OCT compound (Sakura Fine Technical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen sections (5 μm) were air-dried and incubated in PBS for 5 min and then for 1 h at room temperature in PBS that contained 100-fold diluted specific antiserum or antiserum against GST. The sections were washed three times in PBS and then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated (FITC-conjugated) goat antibodies against rat (for peptide-specific antiserum) or against goat (for GST-specific antiserum) IgG for 1 h at room temperature, with three subsequent washes in PBS. Sections were mounted in immersion oil (Olympus) and examined under a fluorescence microscope (UFX-DX; Nikon). We first screened the HeLa cell λgt11 library of random-primed cDNA using the 5′ end of clone pE 450-D as probe (Fig. 1). The longest clone, designated clone Ep24, was isolated, and primers from the 5′ end of clone Ep24 were used for 5′-RACE to identify five overlapping clones (clones Ep28, Ep11, Ep2, Ep79, and Ep21). The original HeLa cell cDNA library was then screened again, and clones Ep1 and Ep5 were obtained. In clone Ep5, the putative initiation codon ATG was preceded by an in-frame termination codon. For downstream cloning, we screened the HeLa cell cDNA library using the 3′ end of clone pE 450-C (Fig. 1). We isolated several almost identical clones and a clone that included TGA (clone Ep12). From these results, we postulated that the 3′ side of the message had highly homologous repeats of 1602 bp. Clones pE 450-C and pE 450-D both overlapped with parts of the repetitive region. However, the corresponding position could not be identified in this region because of the presence of five strongly homologous repeats. We constructed a cDNA library using a specific primer from the 3′- terminal region of clone Ep12. The longest clone, Ep115, was 6.3 kilobases long and it was isolated together with several shorter clones, Ep150 and Ep104. We constructed another cDNA library using a specific primer from the repetitive region of the 1.6-kilobase pair repeat and isolated a single clone, designated Ep 4. We performed genomic PCR to amplify the repetitive region and obtained a clone that was slightly more than 9 kilobase pairs in length and contained no introns. The gap of 760 bases in the message that had resulted in a gap in the cDNA was, thus, covered by genomic sequence. It appeared that an open reading frame began at the second ATG triplet, which was preceded by an in-frame TGA triplet, because the first ATG triplet was not preceded by a consensus sequence that would favor the initiation of translation (32Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res... 1987; 15: 8125-8148Google Scholar). The total length of the ORF was 15,195 bp, and the predicted amino acid sequence (5065 amino acids) is shown in Fig.2. The theoretical relative molecular mass was calculated to be 552,467 Da and was in reasonable agreement with the molecular mass of 450 kDa determined previously by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The key feature of the protein was the presence of 13 B domains of the type first identified in the COOH-terminal domain of desmoplakin (1Green K.J. Parry D.A.D. Steinert P.M. Virata M.L.A. Wagner R.M. Angst B.D. Nilles L.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1990; 265: 2603-2612Google Scholar). This feature alone clearly identified epiplakin as a member of the plakin family, which includes desmoplakin, BPAG1, and plectin. However, several unusual features were also found, as follows. The B domains themselves could be divided into two groups: one group with ∼70% identity to the B domain in desmoplakin (domains 3, 6, and 8–13; indicated by B in Fig.1), and another group with ∼45–50% identity to the B domain in desmoplakin (domains 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7; indicated by B* in Fig. 1). However, all 13 repeats were more similar to the B domain rather than to the A or C domain that were also first recognized in the COOH-terminal domain of desmoplakin (TableI and Ref. 1Green K.J. Parry D.A.D. Steinert P.M. Virata M.L.A. Wagner R.M. Angst B.D. Nilles L.A. J. Biol. Chem... 1990; 265: 2603-2612Google Scholar). We found, moreover, that the linker regions (358 residues in length) that preceded domains 9–13 and followed these five B domains were almost perfectly identical (Fig.3 A). In addition, we identified three homologous segments within each of five strongly conserved linker regions (Fig. 3 B). For example, in the linker region (residues 2391–2748), two of the segments (residues 2391–2472 and 2473–2554) were 30% identical, with particularly high identity over the last 63 residues. After a glycine-proline-rich segment, a third homologous region (residues 2613–2675), which was shorter than the other two, similarly showed homology over the same region. We predicted that these quasi-repeats should contain two or three heptad-containing segments that are separated from one another by β-turns and/or short β-strands. The total potential number of heptad-containing segments was nine, and we postulated that these segments should be grouped in two or three bundles that contain antiparallel α-helices, a motif found in the structures of many other globular proteins. We failed to identify a coiled-coil rod domain and an amino-terminal domain, both of which are characteristic features of all other known members of the plakin family. Furthermore, no dimerization motif was found in the sequence, suggesting that epiplakin probably exists in vivo as a single-chain structure. A search for other functional protein motifs did not reveal any transmembrane sequences or any vimentin- or actin-binding domains (13Nikolic B. Nulty E.M. Mir B. Wiche G. J.

Each repeat consisted of the linker regions (358 residues in length) followed by B domains 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13 (176 residues in length). In total, 534 amino acids were almost perfectly identical. Amino acids that are identical in five repeats are shaded. Asterisk(*) indicates the different amino acids. B, comparison of the sequences of three homologous segments within one of five strongly conserved linker regions (residues 2391–2748). The sequences of three homologous segments are compared with each other. Two of these segments (residues 2391–2472 and 2473–2554) are 30% identical, with particularly homology over the last 63 residues. The third homologous region (residues 2613–2675) is shorter than the former two but, similarly, exhibits the homology over the same region. Amino acids that are identical in three segments are shaded.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) All 13 domains, with the exception of domains 1, 2 and 4, consisted of 176 amino acid residues. These other three domains consisted of 178 (domain 1), 171 (domain 2), and 173 (domain 4) residues, respectively. An asterisk indicated B domains of epiplakin that are approximately 46–49% homologous to the B domain in desmoplakin. To map the linear epitope in epiplakin accurately, we tested the original patient's serum, which had been used for cDNA screening, for reactivity against 264 consecutive cellulose-bound linear peptides of 10 amino acids in length with an 8-amino acid overlap in the region between amino acids residues 2807 and 3337 of epiplakin (Fig. 2). This region covers one of five strongly conserved COOH-terminal repeats and includes the sequence that was recognized by the patient's serum (25Fujiwara S. Kohno K. Iwamatsu A. Naito I. Shinkai H. J. Invest. Dermatol... 1996; 106: 1125-1130Google Scholar). The patient's serum reacted strongly with the amino acids sequence MSIYQAMWKGVL and weakly with amino acids TKGFFDPNTH. The former sequence is unique to epiplakin, but the latter is also found in plectin and is highly homologous, with the exception of glutamic acid at the last position instead of histidine (TKGFFDPNTE), to a peptide in desmoplakin. To confirm the reactivity of the serum, we performed an ELISA and found that the patient's serum reacted only with the former peptide (Fig.4 A). To refine the identification of the epitope, we exposed a series of decapeptides with nine overlapping amino acids derived from the sequence LVPAKDQPGRQEKMSIYQAMWKGVLRPGT (residues 2739–2767) to the patient's serum in another dot blot test. We detected four strongly positive spots, corresponding to sequences from KMSIYQAMWK to IYQAMWKGVL (Fig.4 B) and, thus, the major epitope recognized by the patient's serum was determined to be IYQAMWK (Fig. 4 C). Western blotting showed that the patient's serum, after absorption with the synthetic peptide MSIYQAMWKGVLC, no longer reacted with the 450-kDa epidermal autoantigen (Fig. 5,lanes 1 and 2). These data indicated that antibodies in the patient's serum recognized mainly the unique epitope in epiplakin.Figure 5Western blotting using several antisera against the 450-kDa epidermal antigen.

These measurements indicated that sequences regulating the sensitivity of αIIbβ3 to RGDS are located in the seven amino-terminal repeats of αIIb. Moreover, replacing the first three or four (but not the first two) repeats of rat αIIb with the corresponding human sequences enhanced sensitivity to RGDS, whereas replacing the first two or three repeats of human αIIb with the corresponding rat sequences had little or no effect. Nevertheless, RGDS bound to Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing αIIbβ3 regardless whether the αIIb in the heterodimers was human, rat, or a rat-human chimera. These results indicate that the sequences determining the sensitivity of αIIbβ3 to RGD-containing peptides are located in the third and fourth amino-terminal repeats of αIIb. Because RGDS binds to both human and rat αIIbβ3, the results suggest that differences in RGDS sensitivity result from differences in the allosteric changes induced in these repeats following RGDS binding.

Ligand binding to integrins initiates intracellular signals that are crucial for cellular growth and differentiation (1Hynes R.O. Cell.. 1987; 48: 549-554Google Scholar). Conversely, many cells regulate the ability of their integrins to recognize ligands. The prototypic example of integrin regulation is the platelet integrin αIIbβ3 (2Bennett J.S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med... 1996; 16: 31-36Google Scholar). In unstimulated platelets, αIIbβ3 is inactive; but following platelet stimulation by agonists such as ADP and thrombin, αIIbβ3 assumes a conformation in which it is able to bind macromolecular ligands such as fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor. Because ligand binding to αIIbβ3 is a prerequisite for platelet aggregation, regulating the affinity of αIIbβ3 for ligands assures that only stimulated platelets aggregate.The major ligand for αIIbβ3 in plasma is fibrinogen. Three portions of the fibrinogen molecule (the carboxyl terminus of the fibrinogen γ-chain (3Kloczewiak M. Timmons S. Hawiger J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1982; 107: 181-187Google Scholar) and two Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motifs located in the fibrinogen α-chain (4Gartner T.K. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1985; 260: 11891-11894Google Scholar)) have been proposed to be sites that mediate fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3. However, ultrastructural examination of fibrinogen bound to αIIbβ3(5Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Vilaire G. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1992; 267: 16637-16643Google Scholar) and measurements of fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 using fibrinogens containing mutated RGD or γ-chain sequences (6Farrell D.H. Thiagarajan P. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 226-231Google Scholar) indicate that it is the γ-chain sequences that mediate fibrinogen binding. Nonetheless, RGD-containing disintegrins and synthetic compounds based on the RGD motif are effective αIIbβ3 antagonists (7Lefkovits J. Plow E. Topol E. N. Engl. J. Med... 1995; 332: 1553-1559Google Scholar), implying that they either directly or indirectly affect the γ-chain-binding site when they bind to αIIbβ3.Ligands appear to bind to αIIbβ3 by interacting with the amino-terminal portion of β3 (8Puzon-McLaughlin W. Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 7795-7802Google Scholar), although the specific residues involved are not known. A region of β3 encoded by the fourth and fifth exons of the β3 gene that encompasses amino acids 95–223 has been implicated in ligand binding (9Lin E.C.K. Ratnikov B.I. Tsai P.M. Carron C.P. Myers D.M. Barbas III, C.F. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 23912-23920Google Scholar). Moreover, chemical cross-linking experiments have suggested that RGD-containing peptides bind to β3 in the vicinity of amino acids 109–171 (10D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Burke T.A. Lam S.C.-T. Plow E.F. Science.. 1988; 242: 91-93Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that this region of β3 contains an array of oxygenated residues whose three-dimensional structure may resemble that of the ligand-binding I domains that are present in several integrin α-subunits (11Tozer E.C. Liddington R.C. Sutcliffe M.J. Smeeton A.H. Loftus J.C. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 21978-21984Google Scholar). In addition, overlapping peptides corresponding to β3 amino acids 211–222 inhibit fibrinogen binding to purified αIIbβ3, suggesting that this stretch of residues represents a portion of the fibrinogen-binding site (12Charo I.F. Nannizzi L. Phillips D.R. Hsu M.A. Scarborough R.M. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 1415-1421Google Scholar, 13Steiner B. Trzeciak A. Pfenninger G. Kouns W. J. Biol. Chem... 1993; 268: 6870-6873Google Scholar). There is also evidence that more distal portions of β3 may be involved in fibrinogen binding because a naturally occurring Leu262 → Pro mutation prevents αIIbβ3 binding to immobilized fibrinogen (14Ward C.M. Kestin A.S. Newman P.J. Blood.. 2000; 96: 161-169Google Scholar).Ligand binding to αIIbβ3 also appears to involve the amino-terminal third of αIIb (15Loftus J.C. Halloran C.E. Ginsberg M.H. Feigen L.P. Zablocki J.A. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 2033-2039Google Scholar). Chemical cross-linking experiments suggest that the carboxyl terminus of the fibrinogen γ-chain binds to αIIb in the vicinity of amino acids 294–314 (16D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Burke T.A. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem... 1990; 265: 3440-3446Google Scholar), a suggestion supported by the ability of a peptide corresponding to αIIb residues 300–312 to inhibit platelet adhesion to fibrinogen (17Taylor D.B. Gartner T.K. J. Biol. Chem... 1992; 267: 11729-11733Google Scholar). In addition, there are a number of reports of naturally occurring and laboratory-induced mutations involving amino acids located between αIIbresidues 183 and 224 that impair αIIbβ3function, suggesting that this portion of αIIb binds to ligands as well (18Kamata T. Irie A. Tokuhira M. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 18610-18615Google Scholar, 19Grimaldi C.M. Chen F. Wu C. Weiss H.J. Coller B.S. French D.L. Blood.. 1998; 91: 1562-1571Google Scholar, 20Tozer E.C. Baker E.K. Ginsberg M.H. Loftus J.C. Blood.. 1999; 93: 918-924Google Scholar, 21Basani R.B. French D.L. Vilaire G. Brown D.L. Chen F. Coller B.S. Derrick J.M. Gartner T.K. Bennett J.S. Poncz M. Blood.. 2000; 95: 180-188Google Scholar).Although fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 on the platelets of all mammalian species is required for platelet aggregation, there are substantial differences in the ability of RGD-containing peptides to inhibit the process. For example, fibrinogen binding to rabbit and rat platelets is relatively insensitive to inhibition by RGD-containing peptides (22Harfenist E.J. Packham M.A. Mustard J.F. Blood.. 1988; 71: 132-136Google Scholar, 23Jennings L.K. White M.M. Mandrell T.D. Thromb. Haemostasis.. 1995; 74: 1551-1556Google Scholar). To gain an understanding of the molecular basis for the insensitivity of rat αIIbβ3 to RGD-containing peptides, we measured the effect of the tetrapeptide Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) on fibrinogen binding to chimeric αIIbβ3molecules composed of portions of the rat and human proteins. We found that the sequences determining the sensitivity or resistance of αIIbβ3 to inhibition by RGDS are located in the third and fourth repeats of the amino-terminal portion of αIIb. Moreover, because we also found that RGDS bound to αIIbβ3 regardless of whether the heterodimer contained human or rat subunits, our results imply that RGDS impairs fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3by inducing an allosteric change in the third and fourth repeats of αIIb. They also suggest that a conformational change in these repeats may be required for the fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 that occurs on agonist-stimulated platelets.DISCUSSIONAlthough fibrinogen appears to bind to αIIbβ3 exclusively via sequences located at the carboxyl-terminal end of the fibrinogen γ-chain (5Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Vilaire G. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1992; 267: 16637-16643Google Scholar, 6Farrell D.H. Thiagarajan P. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 226-231Google Scholar), peptides containing an RGD motif are competitive inhibitors of fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 (4Gartner T.K. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1985; 260: 11891-11894Google Scholar). Moreover, despite chemical cross-linking experiments suggesting that the γ-chain and RGD-containing peptides bind to different subunits of the αIIbβ3 heterodimer (16D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Burke T.A. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem... 1990; 265: 3440-3446Google Scholar, 38D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Lam S.C. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem... 1988; 263: 3943-3951Google Scholar), competitive binding measurements indicate that the peptides bind to αIIbβ3 in a mutually exclusive manner (39Bennett J.S. Shattil S.J. Power J.W. Gartner T.K. J. Biol. Chem... 1988; 263: 12948-12953Google Scholar), implying either that the peptides bind to same site or that the binding sites interact allosterically. Hu et al. (40Hu D.D. White C.A. Panzer-Knodle S. Page J.D. Nicholson N. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 4633-4639Google Scholar), using plasmon resonance spectroscopy to study the effect of RGD ligands on fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3, concluded that fibrinogen and RGD ligands bind to separate sites on αIIbβ3, but suggested that there is an allosteric relationship between the two. Using chimeras of RGD-insensitive rat αIIbβ3 and RGD-sensitive human αIIbβ3, we found that sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of the tetrapeptide RGDS was determined by the origin of the third and fourth amino-terminal repeats of αIIb. We also found little difference in the affinity of αIIbβ3 on human and rat platelets for fibrinogen. Thus, our data suggest that rather than directly affecting fibrinogen binding, species differences in the third and fourth αIIb repeats affect an allosteric change that regulates fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3.Ligand binding to αIIbβ3 is thought to involve regions located in the amino-terminal portions of both αIIb and β3 (8Puzon-McLaughlin W. Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 7795-7802Google Scholar), although much of this evidence is indirect. The β3 region encompasses amino acids 95–223 (9Lin E.C.K. Ratnikov B.I. Tsai P.M. Carron C.P. Myers D.M. Barbas III, C.F. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 23912-23920Google Scholar) and includes the RGD-cross-linking site located in the vicinity of amino acids 109–171 (38D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Lam S.C. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem... 1988; 263: 3943-3951Google Scholar) as well as an array of oxygenated residues whose fold may resemble that of the ligand-bindingmetal ion-dependentadhesion sites (MIDAS) present in integrin I domains (11Tozer E.C. Liddington R.C. Sutcliffe M.J. Smeeton A.H. Loftus J.C. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 21978-21984Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the deleterious effect of an Arg214 → Trp mutation, located in the midst of this sequence, can be reversed by exposing αIIbβ3 to DTT, suggesting that the presence of Trp at residue 214 does not prevent fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 directly, but rather obscures the fibrinogen-binding site (41Kouns W. Steiner B. Kunicki T. Moog S. Jutzi J. Jennings L. Cazenave J. Lanza F. Blood.. 1994; 84: 1015-1108Google Scholar).It is also noteworthy that the location of the binding site for RGD-containing peptides in integrins is uncertain, and there is evidence for binding sites in both α- and β-subunits. For example, proteins corresponding to the fourth through seventh amino-terminal repeats of α5 and αIIb bind to fibronectin III fragment-(8–10) and to fibrinogen, respectively, in an RGD- dependent manner (42Baneres J.L. Roquet F. Green M. LeCalvez H. Parello J. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 24744-24753Google Scholar, 43Gulino D. Boudignon C. Zhang L. Concord E. Rabiet M.-J. Marguerie G. J. Biol. Chem... 1992; 267: 1001-1007Google Scholar). Conversely, experiments using chemical and photoaffinity cross-linking, site-directed mutagenesis, synthetic integrin and RGD-containing peptides, and mAbs have identified regions in the amino-terminal portion of β1- and β3-subunits that recognize the RGD motif (11Tozer E.C. Liddington R.C. Sutcliffe M.J. Smeeton A.H. Loftus J.C. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 21978-21984Google Scholar, 38D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Lam S.C. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem... 1988; 263: 3943-3951Google Scholar,44Bitan G. Scheibler L. Greenberg Z. Rosenblatt M. Chorev M. Biochemistry.. 1999; 38: 3414-3420Google Scholar, 45Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Irie A. Takada Y. Mardon H.J. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 17283-17292Google Scholar, 46Humphries J.D. Askari J.A. Zhang X.P. Takada Y. Humphries M.J. Mould A.P. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 20337-20345Google Scholar). Based on these observations, one possible explanation for our results is simply that RGDS does not bind to either rat αIIb or rat β3. However, we found that first, the sensitivity of αIIbβ3 composed of human subunits or of a human α-subunit and rat β-subunit to RGDS was equivalent, and second, binding of mAb 10-758 to human β3 was induced by RGDS to an equal extent regardless of whether αIIb was human, rat, or a human-rat chimera. Thus, our data imply that RGDS binds to both human and rat αIIbβ3 and that differences in its inhibitory potency are due to differences in allosteric events that follow RGDS binding.The portion of αIIb implicated in ligand binding has also been localized to the amino-terminal third of the molecule (15Loftus J.C. Halloran C.E. Ginsberg M.H. Feigen L.P. Zablocki J.A. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 2033-2039Google Scholar) and includes the fibrinogen γ-chain peptide-cross-linking site at amino acids 294–314 (16D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Burke T.A. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem... 1990; 265: 3440-3446Google Scholar). In addition, a number of naturally occurring and laboratory-induced mutations involving amino acids 145, 183, 184, 189, 190, 191, 193, and 224 have been described that impair αIIbβ3 function, suggesting that these residues interact with αIIbβ3 ligands (18Kamata T. Irie A. Tokuhira M. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 18610-18615Google Scholar, 19Grimaldi C.M. Chen F. Wu C. Weiss H.J. Coller B.S. French D.L. Blood.. 1998; 91: 1562-1571Google Scholar, 20Tozer E.C. Baker E.K. Ginsberg M.H. Loftus J.C. Blood.. 1999; 93: 918-924Google Scholar). Of note, residues 183–224 are located in the third αIIb repeat (25Poncz M. Eisman R. Heidenreich R. Silver S.M. Vilaire G. Surrey S. Schwartz E. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1987; 262: 8476-8482Google Scholar). Because our data suggest that the third repeat is involved in the allosteric regulation of fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3, it is possible that mutation of the residues listed above interferes with this allosteric change, rather than directly perturbing the fibrinogen-binding site.The tertiary structure of integrins has yet to be determined. Based on computer modeling, Springer (31Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1997; 94: 65-72Google Scholar) proposed that the amino-terminal portion of integrin α-subunits folds into a seven-bladed β-propeller configuration, with each of the blades corresponding to a β-sheet formed from four anti-parallel β-strands located within each of the amino-terminal repeats. Loops connecting the β-strands would be located on either the upper or low surface of the proposed propeller such that residues in three loops in human αIIbbetween Arg147 and Tyr166, Val182and Leu195, and His215 and Gly233, connecting portions of the third and fourth propeller blades, would be juxtaposed in one quadrant of the upper surface of the propeller (21Basani R.B. French D.L. Vilaire G. Brown D.L. Chen F. Coller B.S. Derrick J.M. Gartner T.K. Bennett J.S. Poncz M. Blood.. 2000; 95: 180-188Google Scholar). Comparison of the amino acid sequence of the loops in human αIIb with that of the analogous portions of rat αIIb (47Thornton M.A. Poncz M. Blood.. 1999; 94: 3947-3950Google Scholar) indicates that the putative second loop is fully conserved, whereas the first and third loops would be only 50% homologous. Thus, it is possible that amino acid sequence differences between human and rat αIIb in the putative first and third loops could be responsible for the differences in sensitivity of human and rat αIIbβ3 to RGD-containing peptides.Alterations in the tertiary and/or quaternary structure of integrins regulate their affinity, and possibly their avidity, for ligands. Recent nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic and x-ray crystallographic studies of the I domain of αL emphasize the importance of changes in the conformation of the α-subunit amino terminus in integrin function (48Kallen J. Welzenbach K. Ramage P. Geyl D. Kriwacki R. Legge G. Cottens S. Weitz-Schmidt G. Hommel U. J. Mol. Biol... 1999; 292: 1-9Google Scholar, 49Huth J.R. Olejniczak E.T. Mendoza R. Liang H. Harris E.A. Lupher Jr., M.L. Wilson A.E. Fesik S.W. Staunton D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2000; 97: 5231-5236Google Scholar). I domains are present in nine integrin α-subunits, where they are inserted between the second and third amino-terminal repeats (49Huth J.R. Olejniczak E.T. Mendoza R. Liang H. Harris E.A. Lupher Jr., M.L. Wilson A.E. Fesik S.W. Staunton D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2000; 97: 5231-5236Google Scholar). In αL and αM, ligands such as ICAM-1–3 (intercellular adhesionmolecule) bind to a divalent cation-containing MIDAS motif on the upper I domain surface (50Lee J.O. Bankston L.A. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Structure.. 1995; 3: 1333-1340Google Scholar, 51Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1995; 92: 10277-10281Google Scholar, 52Liddington R. Bankston L.

In the I domain of αL, residues distal to the MIDAS motif, lining a cleft formed by the seventh α-helix and the central β-sheet, regulate ligand binding to αLβ2 allosterically (49Huth J.R. Olejniczak E.T. Mendoza R. Liang H. Harris E.A. Lupher Jr., M.L. Wilson A.E. Fesik S.W. Staunton D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hommel U. J. Mol. Biol... 1999; 292: 1-9Google Scholar). In addition, mutations in the amino- and carboxyl-terminal linker sequences that connect the I domain to the rest of αLeither activate or inactivate I domain function (49Huth J.R. Olejniczak E.T. Mendoza R. Liang H. Harris E.A. Lupher Jr., M.L. Wilson A.E. Fesik S.W. Staunton D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2000; 97: 5231-5236Google Scholar), implying that the changes in I domain conformation that regulate its function are transmitted from the amino-terminal portion of αL to the I domain via these sequences. In the case of αIIbβ3, agonist-induced changes in tertiary structure are essential for its function (2Bennett J.S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med... 1996; 16: 31-36Google Scholar). Our results indicate that an allosteric change in the third and fourth amino-terminal repeats of αIIb, a portion of αIIb located immediately downstream from the I domain insertion site in I domain-containing integrins, regulates ligand binding to αIIbβ3. Thus, by extrapolation, our data suggest that allosteric changes involving the third and fourth α-subunit repeats may be a general mechanism by which ligand binding to integrins is regulated. Ligand binding to integrins initiates intracellular signals that are crucial for cellular growth and differentiation (1Hynes R.O. Cell.. 1987; 48: 549-554Google Scholar). Conversely, many cells regulate the ability of their integrins to recognize ligands. The prototypic example of integrin regulation is the platelet integrin αIIbβ3 (2Bennett J.S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med... 1996; 16: 31-36Google Scholar). In unstimulated platelets, αIIbβ3 is inactive; but following platelet stimulation by agonists such as ADP and thrombin, αIIbβ3 assumes a conformation in which it is able to bind macromolecular ligands such as fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor. Because ligand binding to αIIbβ3 is a prerequisite for platelet aggregation, regulating the affinity of αIIbβ3 for ligands assures that only stimulated platelets aggregate. The major ligand for αIIbβ3 in plasma is fibrinogen. Three portions of the fibrinogen molecule (the carboxyl terminus of the fibrinogen γ-chain (3Kloczewiak M. Timmons S. Hawiger J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 1982; 107: 181-187Google Scholar) and two Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motifs located in the fibrinogen α-chain (4Gartner T.K. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1985; 260: 11891-11894Google Scholar)) have been proposed to be sites that mediate fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3. However, ultrastructural examination of fibrinogen bound to αIIbβ3(5Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Vilaire G. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1992; 267: 16637-16643Google Scholar) and measurements of fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 using fibrinogens containing mutated RGD or γ-chain sequences (6Farrell D.H. Thiagarajan P. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 226-231Google Scholar) indicate that it is the γ-chain sequences that mediate fibrinogen binding. Nonetheless, RGD-containing disintegrins and synthetic compounds based on the RGD motif are effective αIIbβ3 antagonists (7Lefkovits J. Plow E. Topol E. N. Engl. J. Med... 1995; 332: 1553-1559Google Scholar), implying that they either directly or indirectly affect the γ-chain-binding site when they bind to αIIbβ3. Ligands appear to bind to αIIbβ3 by interacting with the amino-terminal portion of β3 (8Puzon-McLaughlin W. Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 7795-7802Google Scholar), although the specific residues involved are not known. A region of β3 encoded by the fourth and fifth exons of the β3 gene that encompasses amino acids 95–223 has been implicated in ligand binding (9Lin E.C.K. Ratnikov B.I. Tsai P.M. Carron C.P. Myers D.M. Barbas III, C.F. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 23912-23920Google Scholar). Moreover, chemical cross-linking experiments have suggested that RGD-containing peptides bind to β3 in the vicinity of amino acids 109–171 (10D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Burke T.A. Lam S.C.-T. Plow E.F. Science.. 1988; 242: 91-93Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that this region of β3 contains an array of oxygenated residues whose three-dimensional structure may resemble that of the ligand-binding I domains that are present in several integrin α-subunits (11Tozer E.C. Liddington R.C. Sutcliffe M.J. Smeeton A.H. Loftus J.C. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 21978-21984Google Scholar). In addition, overlapping peptides corresponding to β3 amino acids 211–222 inhibit fibrinogen binding to purified αIIbβ3, suggesting that this stretch of residues represents a portion of the fibrinogen-binding site (12Charo I.F. Nannizzi L. Phillips D.R. Hsu M.A. Scarborough R.M. J. Biol. Chem... 1991; 266: 1415-1421Google Scholar, 13Steiner B. Trzeciak A. Pfenninger G. Kouns W. J. Biol. Chem... 1993; 268: 6870-6873Google Scholar). There is also evidence that more distal portions of β3 may be involved in fibrinogen binding because a naturally occurring Leu262 → Pro mutation prevents αIIbβ3 binding to immobilized fibrinogen (14Ward C.M. Kestin A.S. Newman P.J. Blood.. 2000; 96: 161-169Google Scholar). Ligand binding to αIIbβ3 also appears to involve the amino-terminal third of αIIb (15Loftus J.C. Halloran C.E. Ginsberg M.H. Feigen L.P. Zablocki J.A. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 2033-2039Google Scholar). Chemical cross-linking experiments suggest that the carboxyl terminus of the fibrinogen γ-chain binds to αIIb in the vicinity of amino acids 294–314 (16D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Burke T.A. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem... 1990; 265: 3440-3446Google Scholar), a suggestion supported by the ability of a peptide corresponding to αIIb residues 300–312 to inhibit platelet adhesion to fibrinogen (17Taylor D.B. Gartner T.K. J. Biol. Chem... 1992; 267: 11729-11733Google Scholar). In addition, there are a number of reports of naturally occurring and laboratory-induced mutations involving amino acids located between αIIbresidues 183 and 224 that impair αIIbβ3function, suggesting that this portion of αIIb binds to ligands as well (18Kamata T. Irie A. Tokuhira M. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 18610-18615Google Scholar, 19Grimaldi C.M. Chen F. Wu C. Weiss H.J. Coller B.S. French D.L. Blood.. 1998; 91: 1562-1571Google Scholar, 20Tozer E.C. Baker E.K. Ginsberg M.H. Loftus J.C. Blood.. 1999; 93: 918-924Google Scholar, 21Basani R.B. French D.L. Vilaire G. Brown D.L. Chen F. Coller B.S. Derrick J.M. Gartner T.K. Bennett J.S. Poncz M. Blood.. 2000; 95: 180-188Google Scholar). Although fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 on the platelets of all mammalian species is required for platelet aggregation, there are substantial differences in the ability of RGD-containing peptides to inhibit the process. For example, fibrinogen binding to rabbit and rat platelets is relatively insensitive to inhibition by RGD-containing peptides (22Harfenist E.J. Packham M.A. Mustard J.F. Blood.. 1988; 71: 132-136Google Scholar, 23Jennings L.K. White M.M. Mandrell T.D. Thromb. Haemostasis.. 1995; 74: 1551-1556Google Scholar). To gain an understanding of the molecular basis for the insensitivity of rat αIIbβ3 to RGD-containing peptides, we measured the effect of the tetrapeptide Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) on fibrinogen binding to chimeric αIIbβ3molecules composed of portions of the rat and human proteins. We found that the sequences determining the sensitivity or resistance of αIIbβ3 to inhibition by RGDS are located in the third and fourth repeats of the amino-terminal portion of αIIb. Moreover, because we also found that RGDS bound to αIIbβ3 regardless of whether the heterodimer contained human or rat subunits, our results imply that RGDS impairs fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3by inducing an allosteric change in the third and fourth repeats of αIIb. They also suggest that a conformational change in these repeats may be required for the fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 that occurs on agonist-stimulated platelets. DISCUSSIONAlthough fibrinogen appears to bind to αIIbβ3 exclusively via sequences located at the carboxyl-terminal end of the fibrinogen γ-chain (5Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Vilaire G. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1992; 267: 16637-16643Google Scholar, 6Farrell D.H. Thiagarajan P. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 226-231Google Scholar), peptides containing an RGD motif are competitive inhibitors of fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 (4Gartner T.K. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1985; 260: 11891-11894Google Scholar). Moreover, despite chemical cross-linking experiments suggesting that the γ-chain and RGD-containing peptides bind to different subunits of the αIIbβ3 heterodimer (16D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Burke T.A. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem... 1990; 265: 3440-3446Google Scholar, 38D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Lam S.C. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem... 1988; 263: 3943-3951Google Scholar), competitive binding measurements indicate that the peptides bind to αIIbβ3 in a mutually exclusive manner (39Bennett J.S. Shattil S.J. Power J.W. Gartner T.K. J. Biol. Chem... 1988; 263: 12948-12953Google Scholar), implying either that the peptides bind to same site or that the binding sites interact allosterically. Hu et al. (40Hu D.D. White C.A. Panzer-Knodle S. Page J.D. Nicholson N. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 4633-4639Google Scholar), using plasmon resonance spectroscopy to study the effect of RGD ligands on fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3, concluded that fibrinogen and RGD ligands bind to separate sites on αIIbβ3, but suggested that there is an allosteric relationship between the two. Using chimeras of RGD-insensitive rat αIIbβ3 and RGD-sensitive human αIIbβ3, we found that sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of the tetrapeptide RGDS was determined by the origin of the third and fourth amino-terminal repeats of αIIb. We also found little difference in the affinity of αIIbβ3 on human and rat platelets for fibrinogen. Thus, our data suggest that rather than directly affecting fibrinogen binding, species differences in the third and fourth αIIb repeats affect an allosteric change that regulates fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3.Ligand binding to αIIbβ3 is thought to involve regions located in the amino-terminal portions of both αIIb and β3 (8Puzon-McLaughlin W. Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 7795-7802Google Scholar), although much of this evidence is indirect. The β3 region encompasses amino acids 95–223 (9Lin E.C.K. Ratnikov B.I. Tsai P.M. Carron C.P. Myers D.M. Barbas III, C.F. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 23912-23920Google Scholar) and includes the RGD-cross-linking site located in the vicinity of amino acids 109–171 (38D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Lam S.C. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem... 1988; 263: 3943-3951Google Scholar) as well as an array of oxygenated residues whose fold may resemble that of the ligand-bindingmetal ion-dependentadhesion sites (MIDAS) present in integrin I domains (11Tozer E.C. Liddington R.C. Sutcliffe M.J. Smeeton A.H. Loftus J.C. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 21978-21984Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the deleterious effect of an Arg214 → Trp mutation, located in the midst of this sequence, can be reversed by exposing αIIbβ3 to DTT, suggesting that the presence of Trp at residue 214 does not prevent fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 directly, but rather obscures the fibrinogen-binding site (41Kouns W. Steiner B. Kunicki T. Moog S. Jutzi J. Jennings L. Cazenave J. Lanza F. Blood.. 1994; 84: 1015-1108Google Scholar).It is also noteworthy that the location of the binding site for RGD-containing peptides in integrins is uncertain, and there is evidence for binding sites in both α- and β-subunits. For example, proteins corresponding to the fourth through seventh amino-terminal repeats of α5 and αIIb bind to fibronectin III fragment-(8–10) and to fibrinogen, respectively, in an RGD- dependent manner (42Baneres J.L. Roquet F. Green M. LeCalvez H. Parello J. J. Biol. Chem... 1998; 273: 24744-24753Google Scholar, 43Gulino D. Boudignon C. Zhang L. Concord E. Rabiet M.-J. Marguerie G. J. Biol. Chem... 1992; 267: 1001-1007Google Scholar). Conversely, experiments using chemical and photoaffinity cross-linking, site-directed mutagenesis, synthetic integrin and RGD-containing peptides, and mAbs have identified regions in the amino-terminal portion of β1- and β3-subunits that recognize the RGD motif (11Tozer E.C. Liddington R.C. Sutcliffe M.J. Smeeton A.H. Loftus J.C. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 21978-21984Google Scholar, 38D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Lam S.C. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem... 1988; 263: 3943-3951Google Scholar,44Bitan G. Scheibler L. Greenberg Z. Rosenblatt M. Chorev M. Biochemistry.. 1999; 38: 3414-3420Google Scholar, 45Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Aota S. Yamada K.M. Irie A. Takada Y. Mardon H.J. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 17283-17292Google Scholar, 46Humphries J.D. Askari J.A. Zhang X.P. Takada Y. Humphries M.J. Mould A.P. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 20337-20345Google Scholar). Based on these observations, one possible explanation for our results is simply that RGDS does not bind to either rat αIIb or rat β3. However, we found that first, the sensitivity of αIIbβ3 composed of human subunits or of a human α-subunit and rat β-subunit to RGDS was equivalent, and second, binding of mAb 10-758 to human β3 was induced by RGDS to an equal extent regardless of whether αIIb was human, rat, or a human-rat chimera. Thus, our data imply that RGDS binds to both human and rat αIIbβ3 and that differences in its inhibitory potency are due to differences in allosteric events that follow RGDS binding.The portion of αIIb implicated in ligand binding has also been localized to the amino-terminal third of the molecule (15Loftus J.C. Halloran C.E. Ginsberg M.H. Feigen L.P. Zablocki J.A. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 2033-2039Google Scholar) and includes the fibrinogen γ-chain peptide-cross-linking site at amino acids 294–314 (16D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Burke T.A. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem... 1990; 265: 3440-3446Google Scholar). In addition, a number of naturally occurring and laboratory-induced mutations involving amino acids 145, 183, 184, 189, 190, 191, 193, and 224 have been described that impair αIIbβ3 function, suggesting that these residues interact with αIIbβ3 ligands (18Kamata T. Irie A. Tokuhira M. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 18610-18615Google Scholar, 19Grimaldi C.M. Chen F. Wu C. Weiss H.J. Coller B.S. French D.L. Blood.. 1998; 91: 1562-1571Google Scholar, 20Tozer E.C. Baker E.K. Ginsberg M.H. Loftus J.C. Blood.. 1999; 93: 918-924Google Scholar). Of note, residues 183–224 are located in the third αIIb repeat (25Poncz M. Eisman R. Heidenreich R. Silver S.M. Vilaire G. Surrey S. Schwartz E. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1987; 262: 8476-8482Google Scholar). Because our data suggest that the third repeat is involved in the allosteric regulation of fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3, it is possible that mutation of the residues listed above interferes with this allosteric change, rather than directly perturbing the fibrinogen-binding site.The tertiary structure of integrins has yet to be determined. Based on computer modeling, Springer (31Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1997; 94: 65-72Google Scholar) proposed that the amino-terminal portion of integrin α-subunits folds into a seven-bladed β-propeller configuration, with each of the blades corresponding to a β-sheet formed from four anti-parallel β-strands located within each of the amino-terminal repeats. Loops connecting the β-strands would be located on either the upper or low surface of the proposed propeller such that residues in three loops in human αIIbbetween Arg147 and Tyr166, Val182and Leu195, and His215 and Gly233, connecting portions of the third and fourth propeller blades, would be juxtaposed in one quadrant of the upper surface of the propeller (21Basani R.B. French D.L. Vilaire G. Brown D.L. Chen F. Coller B.S. Derrick J.M. Gartner T.K. Bennett J.S. Poncz M. Blood.. 2000; 95: 180-188Google Scholar). Comparison of the amino acid sequence of the loops in human αIIb with that of the analogous portions of rat αIIb (47Thornton M.A. Poncz M. Blood.. 1999; 94: 3947-3950Google Scholar) indicates that the putative second loop is fully conserved, whereas the first and third loops would be only 50% homologous. Thus, it is possible that amino acid sequence differences between human and rat αIIb in the putative first and third loops could be responsible for the differences in sensitivity of human and rat αIIbβ3 to RGD-containing peptides.Alterations in the tertiary and/or quaternary structure of integrins regulate their affinity, and possibly their avidity, for ligands. Recent nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic and x-ray crystallographic studies of the I domain of αL emphasize the importance of changes in the conformation of the α-subunit amino terminus in integrin function (48Kallen J. Welzenbach K. Ramage P. Geyl D. Kriwacki R. Legge G. Cottens S. Weitz-Schmidt G. Hommel U. J. Mol. Biol... 1999; 292: 1-9Google Scholar, 49Huth J.R. Olejniczak E.T. Mendoza R. Liang H. Harris E.A. Lupher Jr., M.L. Wilson A.E. Fesik S.W. Staunton D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2000; 97: 5231-5236Google Scholar). I domains are present in nine integrin α-subunits, where they are inserted between the second and third amino-terminal repeats (49Huth J.R. Olejniczak E.T. Mendoza R. Liang H. Harris E.A. Lupher Jr., M.L. Wilson A.E. Fesik S.W. Staunton D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2000; 97: 5231-5236Google Scholar). In αL and αM, ligands such as ICAM-1–3 (intercellular adhesionmolecule) bind to a divalent cation-containing MIDAS motif on the upper I domain surface (50Lee J.O. Bankston L.A. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Structure.. 1995; 3: 1333-1340Google Scholar, 51Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1995; 92: 10277-10281Google Scholar, 52Liddington R. Bankston L.

In the I domain of αL, residues distal to the MIDAS motif, lining a cleft formed by the seventh α-helix and the central β-sheet, regulate ligand binding to αLβ2 allosterically (49Huth J.R. Olejniczak E.T. Mendoza R. Liang H. Harris E.A. Lupher Jr., M.L. Wilson A.E. Fesik S.W. Staunton D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2000; 97: 5231-5236Google Scholar) and constitute the binding site for the αLβ2 inhibitor lovastatin (48Kallen J. Welzenbach K. Ramage P. Geyl D. Kriwacki R. Legge G. Cottens S. Weitz-Schmidt G. Hommel U. J. Mol. Biol... 1999; 292: 1-9Google Scholar). In addition, mutations in the amino- and carboxyl-terminal linker sequences that connect the I domain to the rest of αLeither activate or inactivate I domain function (49Huth J.R. Olejniczak E.T. Mendoza R. Liang H. Harris E.A. Lupher Jr., M.L. Wilson A.E. Fesik S.W. Staunton D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2000; 97: 5231-5236Google Scholar), implying that the changes in I domain conformation that regulate its function are transmitted from the amino-terminal portion of αL to the I domain via these sequences. In the case of αIIbβ3, agonist-induced changes in tertiary structure are essential for its function (2Bennett J.S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med... 1996; 16: 31-36Google Scholar). Our results indicate that an allosteric change in the third and fourth amino-terminal repeats of αIIb, a portion of αIIb located immediately downstream from the I domain insertion site in I domain-containing integrins, regulates ligand binding to αIIbβ3. Thus, by extrapolation, our data suggest that allosteric changes involving the third and fourth α-subunit repeats may be a general mechanism by which ligand binding to integrins is regulated. Although fibrinogen appears to bind to αIIbβ3 exclusively via sequences located at the carboxyl-terminal end of the fibrinogen γ-chain (5Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Vilaire G. Bennett J.S. J. Biol.

Moreover, despite chemical cross-linking experiments suggesting that the γ-chain and RGD-containing peptides bind to different subunits of the αIIbβ3 heterodimer (16D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H.

Thus, our data imply that RGDS binds to both human and rat αIIbβ3 and that differences in its inhibitory potency are due to differences in allosteric events that follow RGDS binding. The portion of αIIb implicated in ligand binding has also been localized to the amino-terminal third of the molecule (15Loftus J.C. Halloran C.E. Ginsberg M.H. Feigen L.P. Zablocki J.A. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 2033-2039Google Scholar) and includes the fibrinogen γ-chain peptide-cross-linking site at amino acids 294–314 (16D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Burke T.A. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem... 1990; 265: 3440-3446Google Scholar). In addition, a number of naturally occurring and laboratory-induced mutations involving amino acids 145, 183, 184, 189, 190, 191, 193, and 224 have been described that impair αIIbβ3 function, suggesting that these residues interact with αIIbβ3 ligands (18Kamata T. Irie A. Tokuhira M. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem... 1996; 271: 18610-18615Google Scholar, 19Grimaldi C.M. Chen F. Wu C. Weiss H.J. Coller B.S. French D.L.

Of note, residues 183–224 are located in the third αIIb repeat (25Poncz M. Eisman R. Heidenreich R. Silver S.M. Vilaire G. Surrey S. Schwartz E. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem... 1987; 262: 8476-8482Google Scholar). Because our data suggest that the third repeat is involved in the allosteric regulation of fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3, it is possible that mutation of the residues listed above interferes with this allosteric change, rather than directly perturbing the fibrinogen-binding site. The tertiary structure of integrins has yet to be determined. Based on computer modeling, Springer (31Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1997; 94: 65-72Google Scholar) proposed that the amino-terminal portion of integrin α-subunits folds into a seven-bladed β-propeller configuration, with each of the blades corresponding to a β-sheet formed from four anti-parallel β-strands located within each of the amino-terminal repeats. Loops connecting the β-strands would be located on either the upper or low surface of the proposed propeller such that residues in three loops in human αIIbbetween Arg147 and Tyr166, Val182and Leu195, and His215 and Gly233, connecting portions of the third and fourth propeller blades, would be juxtaposed in one quadrant of the upper surface of the propeller (21Basani R.B. French D.L. Vilaire G. Brown D.L. Chen F. Coller B.S. Derrick J.M. Gartner T.K. Bennett J.S. Poncz M. Blood.. 2000; 95: 180-188Google Scholar). Comparison of the amino acid sequence of the loops in human αIIb with that of the analogous portions of rat αIIb (47Thornton M.A. Poncz M. Blood.. 1999; 94: 3947-3950Google Scholar) indicates that the putative second loop is fully conserved, whereas the first and third loops would be only 50% homologous. Thus, it is possible that amino acid sequence differences between human and rat αIIb in the putative first and third loops could be responsible for the differences in sensitivity of human and rat αIIbβ3 to RGD-containing peptides. Alterations in the tertiary and/or quaternary structure of integrins regulate their affinity, and possibly their avidity, for ligands. Recent nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic and x-ray crystallographic studies of the I domain of αL emphasize the importance of changes in the conformation of the α-subunit amino terminus in integrin function (48Kallen J.

I domains are present in nine integrin α-subunits, where they are inserted between the second and third amino-terminal repeats (49Huth J.R. Olejniczak E.T. Mendoza R. Liang H. Harris E.A. Lupher Jr., M.L. Wilson A.E. Fesik S.W. Staunton D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2000; 97: 5231-5236Google Scholar). In αL and αM, ligands such as ICAM-1–3 (intercellular adhesionmolecule) bind to a divalent cation-containing MIDAS motif on the upper I domain surface (50Lee J.O. Bankston L.A. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Structure.. 1995; 3: 1333-1340Google Scholar, 51Qu A. Leahy D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1995; 92: 10277-10281Google Scholar, 52Liddington R. Bankston L.

In the I domain of αL, residues distal to the MIDAS motif, lining a cleft formed by the seventh α-helix and the central β-sheet, regulate ligand binding to αLβ2 allosterically (49Huth J.R.

Hommel U. J. Mol. Biol... 1999; 292: 1-9Google Scholar). In addition, mutations in the amino- and carboxyl-terminal linker sequences that connect the I domain to the rest of αLeither activate or inactivate I domain function (49Huth J.R. Olejniczak E.T. Mendoza R. Liang H. Harris E.A. Lupher Jr., M.L. Wilson A.E. Fesik S.W. Staunton D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2000; 97: 5231-5236Google Scholar), implying that the changes in I domain conformation that regulate its function are transmitted from the amino-terminal portion of αL to the I domain via these sequences. In the case of αIIbβ3, agonist-induced changes in tertiary structure are essential for its function (2Bennett J.S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med... 1996; 16: 31-36Google Scholar). Our results indicate that an allosteric change in the third and fourth amino-terminal repeats of αIIb, a portion of αIIb located immediately downstream from the I domain insertion site in I domain-containing integrins, regulates ligand binding to αIIbβ3. Thus, by extrapolation, our data suggest that allosteric changes involving the third and fourth α-subunit repeats may be a general mechanism by which ligand binding to integrins is regulated.

We noted a similar p16Ink4a-associated, senescence-like arrest in normal human astrocytes in response to expression of a conditional form of Raf-1. While HPV16 E7-mediated functional inactivation of the p16Ink4a/pRb pathway in astrocytes blocked the p16Ink4a-associated growth arrest in response to activation of Raf-1, it also revealed a second p21Cip1-associated, senescence-associated, β-galactosidase-independent growth arrest pathway. Importantly, the p21Cip1-associated pathway was present not only in normal astrocytes but also in p53-, p14ARF-, and p16Ink4a/pRb-deficient high grade glioma cells that lacked the p16Ink4a-dependent arrest mechanism. These results suggest that normal human cells have redundant arrest pathways, which can be activated by Raf-1, and that even tumors that have dismantled p16Ink4a-dependent growth arrest pathways are potentially regulated by a second p21Cip1-dependent growth arrest pathway.

Key in regulating this process is the Ras family of proteins. Ras and Ras-related proteins are membrane-bound, receptor-associated GTPases (1Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 2Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). These proteins are activated by ligand-bound growth factor receptors (1Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 2Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar) or other engaged progrowth molecules (3Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22271) Google Scholar) and in turn activate a series of downstream effector proteins including Raf, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and RalGDS (4Katz M.E. McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). While activation of RalGDS and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase undoubtedly play a role in Ras function, activation of the Raf pathway appears to play a critical role in cellular proliferation (5Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1852) Google Scholar, 6Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K.

Biol. 1997; 17: 3047-3055Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Raf is recruited to the cellular membrane by GTP-bound activated Ras, which results in Raf activation by a variety of means, including phosphorylation (8Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 101-110Crossref Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Activated Raf then phosphorylates mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK),1 which in turn phosphorylates and activates p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinases (ERK1 and ERK2) (9Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). ERK1/2 activation and nuclear translocation in turn leads to phosphorylation of a variety of substrates, including transcription factors, which ultimately contribute to proliferation (2Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar,10Chen R.H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). The importance of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in growth is further supported by its alteration in many human tumors. Approximately 50% of human colon carcinomas contain mutant, constitutively active Ras (12Shirasawa S. Furuse M. Yokoyama N. Sasazuki T. Science. 1993; 260: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), an alteration that is believed to contribute to the proliferative signaling necessary for tumor growth. Tumors that typically lack Ras mutations such as brain tumors (gliomas) also have alterations in the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway. Approximately 30% of high grade human gliomas have an amplified, rearranged, and constitutively activated epidermal growth factor receptor (13Louis D.N. Brain Pathol. 1997; 7: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 14Olson J.J. James C.D. Krisht A. Barnett D. Hunter S. Neurosurgery. 1994; 36: 740-748Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar), a receptor known to signal through the Ras pathway (15Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3523) Google Scholar). Additionally, Ras-GTP levels are elevated in a high percentage of high grade human gliomas (16Guha A. Feldkamp M.M. Lau N. Boss G. Pawson A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2755-2765Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), presumably as a result of signaling from a number of different growth factor receptors. Disregulation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is therefore a common means by which tumors maintain and amplify mitogenic stimuli and thereby sustain proliferation. While Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway activation can promote cellular proliferation, it can also paradoxically provoke cell cycle arrest. Sustained activation of oncogenic Ras in normal human fibroblasts (NHF) leads not to proliferation but to permanent arrest in association with elevated levels of p53 and of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p16Ink4a and p21Cip1 (17Lin A.W. Marradas M. Stone J.C. van Aelst L. Serrano M. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3008-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). This irreversible arrest is also associated with expression of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity, suggesting that in response to high levels of activated Ras, normal human cells undergo a senescence-like growth arrest. The ability of oncogenic Ras to induce a senescence-like growth arrest in NHF appears to be closely linked to activation of Raf but not to other downstream targets of Ras, such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or RalGDS, since only mutant forms of Ras that selectively activate the Raf pathway induced growth arrest comparable with that induced by constitutively expressed oncogenic Ras (17Lin A.W. Marradas M. Stone J.C. van Aelst L. Serrano M. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3008-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). This point is further supported by the finding that sustained activation of a conditional form of Raf-1, or overexpression of activated MEK1, in NHF leads to senescence-like arrest comparable with that induced by Ras (17Lin A.W. Marradas M. Stone J.C. van Aelst L. Serrano M. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3008-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 18Zhu J. Woods D. McMahon M. Bishop J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2997-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which Ras or Raf induces a senescence-like arrest in NHF remains to be fully defined, NHF expressing HPV16 E6 and therefore lacking functional p53 (and p53-dependent induction of p21Cip1) still undergo a p16Ink4a-associated, senescence-like arrest in response to Raf activation (18Zhu J. Woods D. McMahon M. Bishop J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2997-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). This senescence-like, Raf-induced arrest could also be blocked by the MEK inhibitor PD098059 (18Zhu J. Woods D. McMahon M. Bishop J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2997-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), further suggesting a link between Raf activation, p16Ink4a induction, and senescence-like arrest. As a whole, these results suggest that the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, in addition to playing a key role in cellular proliferation, can also trigger a senescence-like, p16Ink4a-associated growth arrest that prevents proliferation of normal cells. While normal human cells are programmed to undergo a senescence-like growth arrest in response to excessive stimulation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, tumor cells could gain a growth advantage by inactivating this tumor-suppressive response. Functional inactivation of the pRb/p16Ink4a pathway is a common feature of many if not most human tumors, including human gliomas (13Louis D.N. Brain Pathol. 1997; 7: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 19Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4961) Google Scholar). Given the role of p16Ink4a in mediating Ras/Raf-induced senescence, it seems likely that most human tumors lack important growth arrest programs linked to excessive Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway activation. The cellular response to Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK activation in the absence of a functional p16Ink4a/pRb pathway, however, remains poorly defined. In NHF rendered unresponsive to p16Ink4a-mediated cell cycle arrest by expression of cyclin D1 and a mutant Cdk4, expression of oncogenic Ras resulted in growth arrest and alterations in cell morphology similar to those noted in parental cells (20Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3942) Google Scholar). It is unclear, however, if the arrest pathway activated in the absence of p16Ink4a was the senescence-like arrest pathway activated in p16Ink4a-proficient cells and, if so, what proteins were involved. Similarly, Raf activation in pRb-deficient small cell lung carcinoma cells resulted in cell cycle arrest, although again it was unclear if this arrest was associated with markers of senescence or involved either p16Ink4a or p21Cip1 (21Ravi R.K. Weber E. McMahon M. Williams J.R. Baylin S. Mal A. Harter M.L. Dillehay L.E. Claudio P.P. Giordano A. Nelkin B.D. Mabry M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To more clearly define Raf-induced growth arrest pathways and, in particular, potential p16Ink4a-independent alternate growth arrest pathways, we characterized the response of normal human glial cells to activation of a conditional form of Raf-1 and assessed whether this response was similar in pRb-deficient glial cells and in glial tumors lacking p16Ink4a and/or pRb. The results of these studies show that rather than having a single p16Ink4a-dependent senescence-associated arrest pathway, astrocytes have a second distinct, SA-β-gal-independent, p21Cip1-associated arrest pathway activated in response to Raf activation. This second pathway is present not only in normal astrocytes but also in glial tumor cells that have lost the function of several key cell cycle regulatory proteins including p16Ink4a, p53, pRb, and p14ARF. These results suggest that normal cells (in this case astrocytes) have both primary and secondary mechanisms that can be used to prevent proliferation in the face of sustained Raf/MEK/ERK signaling and that even highly malignant tumors retain at least one pathway in a functional yet dormant state. Normal human astrocytes (NHA), derived from fetal tissue, were purchased from Clonetics (Walkersville, MD). NHA were grown in phenol red-free astrocyte medium (Clonetics) containing 5% charcoal dextran-treated, estrogen-free fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientific, Inc., Tarzana, CA). U251, SF126, U87, and U87 + E6 glioma cell lines were grown in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mm HEPES, penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% charcoal dextran-treated, estrogen-free fetal bovine serum. To create cells that express conditional Raf-1, Phoenix A cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) with EGFPΔRaf-1:ER retroviral DNA. The pWZLblast3 EGFPΔRaf-1:ER retroviral vector encodes a protein that is a chimera of the catalytic domain of human Raf-1, the hormone binding domain of the human estrogen receptor, and an enhanced version of green fluorescent protein (EGFP). The vector also encodes blasticidin resistance. A similar retroviral vector for the expression of GFPΔRaf-1:ER has been described previously (22Woods D. Parry D. Cherwinski H. Bosch E. Lees E. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5598-5611Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Infected cells show little Raf kinase activity until the chimeric protein is activated by the addition of 17β-estradiol (E2) or the estrogen analog 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4HT) (23Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). As a control, cells were infected with pBabepuro3ΔRaf301:ER retroviral DNA. The pBabepuro3ΔRaf301:ER retroviral vector encodes a protein that is a chimera of a kinase-inactive version of the catalytic domain of Raf-1 and the hormone-binding domain of the estrogen receptor. The vector also encodes for puromycin resistance. 24 and 48 h after transfection of Phoenix A cells, the medium containing the packaged virus was placed on NHA. Infected NHA were selected for resistance to blasticidin S (25 μg/ml for 4–5 days) (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) or puromycin (1 μg/ml for 4–5 days) (Sigma-Aldrich), and resistant cells were pooled and expanded for further studies. To ensure successful infection, relevant expanded populations were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting to verify expression of EGFPΔRaf-1:ER. Pooled populations of infected NHA were used for all experiments, since the limited life span of astrocytes in culture does not allow for development of clonal populations. To create pRb-deficient cells with conditional activation of Raf-1, NHA first were infected with HPV16 E7 retroviral DNA packaged in Phoenix A cells, as described above. The pLNCX retroviral vector allows for constitutive expression of the HPV E7 protein (pRb inactivation) and neomycin resistance. Cells expressing E7 were selected for resistance to G418 (0.5 mg/ml for 6–7 days) (ICN). Infected cells that survived drug selection were then infected with the EGFPΔRaf-1:ER retroviral DNA, as described. Cells were selected for resistance to blasticidin/G418 and were pooled and expanded for further studies. U251, SF126, U87, and U87 + E6 glioma cell lines were infected with EGFPΔRaf-1:ER retroviral DNA as described and selected for resistance to blasticidin. U251 also were infected with pBabepuro3ΔRaf301:ER retroviral DNA as described and selected for resistance to puromycin. Following blasticidin selection, cells infected with EGFPΔRaf-1:ER were sorted using a Becton-Dickinson FACSVantage SE Cell Sorter, and the cells expressing the highest level of EGFP (upper 5% of expressers) were collected and expanded. All experiments were performed using this population of high expressing cells. These cells were periodically reanalyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting to ensure maintenance of EGFP expression level. EGFPΔRaf-1:ER was activated by incubating cells for 4 days with either 1 μmE2 (Sigma-Aldrich) or 100 nm 4HT (Research Biochemicals International, Natick, MA). 1 mm stocks of E2 and 4HT were made in ethanol. For all studies, both control and E2- or 4HT-containing media were changed every 48 h. For studies done to assess the reversibility of the Raf-induced growth arrest, cells were incubated for 4 days with 1 μmE2. Cells then were washed extensively with PBS, grown in control medium for an additional 4 days, and analyzed. The extent of proliferation was assessed by monitoring incorporation of [methyl-3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were seeded in at least quadruplicate in 96-well plates, at a density of 16,000 cells/ml (NHA, NHA/E6, NHA/E7, and SF126 cells) or 12,000 cells/ml (U251 and U87 cells). Cells were grown for 4 days and then incubated with 20 μCi/well of [methyl-3H]thymidine for 16 h. Incorporation was measured with a Tomtec Micro 96-cell plate harvester and a Betaplate 1205 liquid scintillation counter. SA-β-gal activity was determined by the method of Dimri et al. (24Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Robelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5707) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde and incubated with a 1 mg/ml X-gal solution (40 mm citric acid/sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6), 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mm ferricyanide, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml X-gal in dimethylformamide) for 16–24 h. Cells were then rinsed with PBS and methanol and air-dried. The percentage of SA-β-gal-positive cells was assessed by counting the number of blue cells in a × 10 microscopic field and dividing that number by the total number of cells in the field. The percentage of positively stained cells in each plate was the average of four fields per plate. For Western blot analysis, cells were lysed in 0.5% SDS lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.2% NaN3, 0.5% SDS). Equal amounts of cellular lysates were electrophoresed on 7.5–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.). Western blots were probed with primary antibodies against the estrogen receptor (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), phospho-p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), p16Ink4a (Oncogene Research Products, Boston, MA), p21Cip1 (Oncogene Research Products), p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and pRb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Anti-mouse and anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were used (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and Western blots were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Equal loading was determined by staining the membrane with Ponceau S (Sigma-Aldrich). Quantitative analysis was done on an AlphaImager 2200, using AlphaEase Software (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). Autoradiographs are representative of 2–4 experiments. 4HT- or E2-mediated activation of Raf in proliferating NHA retrovirally infected with EGFPΔRaf-1:ER (NHA/RafER) led to elevated expression of the chimeric Raf:ER protein. Western blot analysis showed that E2 incubation led to a sustained high level of EGFPΔRaf-1:ER expression in NHA/RafER cells (Fig. 1 a), consistent with increased stability of the Raf-1:ER fusion protein, as reported previously (23Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6252Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). EGFPΔRaf-1:ER induction was noted within 24 h of E2 addition and was sustained for 4 days (Fig.1 a). E2 incubation also led to an increase in phosphorylated ERK1/2 in NHA/RafER cells, but not NHA or NHA containing the kinase-inactive version of Raf-1 (NHA/Raf301:ER), as determined by Western blot analysis using a phosphospecific p42/p44 antibody (Fig.1 a and data not shown). This increase in phosphorylated ERK1/2 is consistent with p42/p44 ERK1/2 pathway stimulation following Raf activation. The level of phosphorylated ERK1/2 remained high throughout the experiment. As shown in Fig. 1 a, the addition of 4HT resulted in induction of EGFPΔRaf-1:ER and phosphorylated ERK1/2 similar to that seen with E2. Activation of EGFPΔRaf-1:ER also led to changes in cell proliferation and morphology. Beginning ∼48 h following EGFPΔRaf-1:ER activation, cells became smaller and refractile but remained adherent and viable (determined by trypan blue exclusion, data not shown). [3H]thymidine incorporation was reduced by 90% after 4 days of EGFPΔRaf-1:ER activation (Fig. 1 b). Incorporation of [3H]thymidine by uninfected NHA and by NHA/Raf301:ER was not affected by the addition of E2 to the medium (Fig.1 b). Additionally, 4 days after EGFPΔRaf-1:ER activation by the addition of either 4HT or E2, 45–50% of cells stained positively for SA-β-gal, a common marker of senescent cells, while control NHA/RafER cells and parental NHA had fewer than 10% SA-β-gal positive cells (Fig. 1 c). Senescent cells have been shown to have increased expression of p16Ink4a, p21Cip1, and p53 (20Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3942) Google Scholar, 25Dimri G.P. Itahana K. Acosta M. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 26Alcorta D.A. Xiong Y. Phelps D. Hannon G. Beach D. Barrett J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13742-13747Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar), and human fibroblast studies have demonstrated that elevation of p16Ink4a expression is associated with the maintenance of senescence (18Zhu J. Woods D. McMahon M. Bishop J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2997-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 26Alcorta D.A. Xiong Y. Phelps D. Hannon G. Beach D. Barrett J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13742-13747Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assessed the effect of Raf activation on the expression of these cell cycle regulatory proteins in NHA. As shown in Fig. 1 d, incubation of uninfected NHA with E2 had no effect on expression of p16Ink4a, p21Cip1, or p53. Similarly, incubation of NHA/Raf301:ER with 4HT did not affect p16Ink4a expression (data not shown). EGFPΔRaf-1:ER activation in NHA/RafER cells similarly did not significantly increase levels of p21Cip1 expression or p53 expression 4 days following Raf activation (54 ± 23 and 114 ± 31% of control values, respectively, by quantitative Western blot analysis; Fig. 1 d). EGFPΔRaf-1:ER activation in NHA/RafER cells did, however, result in increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16Ink4a, at 72 h after Raf activation (Fig. 1 d). To address whether the Raf-induced growth arrest in NHA/RafER cells was permanent and irreversible, NHA/RafER cells were incubated with E2 for 4 days, washed extensively with PBS to remove E2 from the culture, and grown in control medium for an additional 4 days. E2 was used to activate EGFPΔRaf-1:ER in these experiments, since it is more easily removed from the cells than 4HT. As shown in Fig. 1 a, hormone removal resulted in decreases of EGFPΔRaf-1:ER levels and phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels to those seen in control cells. Following E2 removal, however, cells maintained an altered morphology, and thymidine incorporation remained reduced by 90% (Fig. 1 b). Additionally, there was no change in the percentage of cells that stained positively for SA-β-gal (Fig. 1 c). Finally, consistent with the senescence phenotype, p16Ink4a expression remained elevated (Fig. 1 d). Irreversible growth arrest, maintenance of SA-β-gal expression, and sustained elevation of p16Ink4aexpression suggest that activation of Raf and the ERK1/2 pathway is able to induce a p16Ink4a-associated senescence phenotype in NHA. Because of the association between increased p16Ink4a expression and Raf-induced senescence in NHA, studies were initiated to determine if a functional p16Ink4a/pRb pathway was required for Raf-induced growth arrest in NHA. NHA constitutively expressing E7 and conditional EGFPΔRaf-1:ER (NHA/E7/RafER) were derived by retroviral infection. Expression of the HPV16 E7 protein resulted in decreased protein levels of pRb, as shown in the Western blot in Fig.2 a, lower panel. While 4HT had no effect on protein expression in parental NHA/E7 cells (data not shown), 4HT-mediated activation of EGFPΔRaf-1:ER (in NHA/E7/RafER cells) led to increased expression of both chimeric EGFPΔRaf-1:ER protein and phosphorylated ERK1/2 (Fig.2 a). EGFPΔRaf-1:ER activation also resulted in a 60% inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation, as compared with control cells (Fig. 2 b). EGFPΔRaf-1:ER activation did not, however, alter cell morphology, and after 4 days of 4HT exposure fewer than 5% of cells stained positively for SA-β-gal. To better understand the difference in Raf-induced arrest in NHA/E7/RafER cells compared with NHA/RafER cells, Western blot analysis was done to assess changes in protein expression following EGFPΔRaf-1:ER activation. Expression of p16Ink4a was elevated in NHA/E7/RafER cells as compared with NHA/RafER cells (Fig.2 a, lower panel), which is consistent with the destabilization of pRb by the E7 protein (27Khleif S.N. DeGregori J. Yee C.L. Otterson G.A. Kaye F.J. Nevins J.R. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 28Martin L.G. Demers G.W. Galloway D.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 975-985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike what was noted in NHA/RafER cells with a functional p16Ink4a/pRb pathway, however, there was no further increase in p16Ink4alevels, relative to control cells (average p16Ink4a levels were 65 ± 9% of control values) in the pRb-deficient NHA/E7/RafER cells following Raf activation (Fig. 2 c). There was, however, an increase in p21Cip1 expression in NHA/E7/RafER cells following EGFPΔRaf-1:ER activation. This p21Cip1 induction was apparent within 48 h (250 ± 43% of control values), persisted at least 4 days (250 ± 16% of control values), and appeared to be independent of p53, the levels of which remained unchanged throughout the experiment (Fig.2 c). These results indicate that activated Raf is able to induce growth arrest in NHA in the absence of a fully functional p16Ink4a/pRb pathway. This arrest, however, is associated with increased p21Cip1 expression, is not associated with increased SA-β-gal, and appears to be functionally different from senescence-like arrest seen in NHA. Although NHA have two pathways leading to growth arrest following sustained Raf expression, glial tumors often have genetic defects that might influence their responses to Raf activation. For example, the vast majority of high grade (grade IV) gliomas have defects in the p16Ink4a/pRb pathway (13Louis D.N. Brain Pathol. 1997; 7: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To assess whether glioma cells retained cell cycle arrest pathways in response to Raf activation, high grade glioma cells were infected with EGFPΔRaf-1:ER, incubated with 4HT or E2 to activate EGFPΔRaf-1:ER, and monitored for cellular alterations and activation of cell signaling pathways. While [3H]thymidine incorporation by U251 cells containing the kinase-inactive form of Raf-1 (U251/Raf301:ER) was not affected by incubation with 4HT (Fig.3 a), [3H]thymidine incorporation was reduced by 80% in U251/RafER cells, by 90% in SF126/RafER cells, and by 85% in U87/RafER cells following 4 days of incubation with E2(Fig. 3 a). In contrast to the NHA/RafER cells, however, which became smaller and refractile and SA-β-gal-positive following EGFPΔRaf-1:ER activation, the tumor cells became elongated with long processes, and SA-β-gal activity did not increase following EGFPΔRaf-1:ER activation. The response of these cells was therefore more similar to that of pRb-deficient NHA/E7/RafER cells than that of NHA. Consistent with this idea, all cell lines showed elevated p21Cip1 expression, ranging from 2-fold increase in U87/RafER cells to 8-fold in U251/RafER and SF126/RafER cells, which began 24–48 h after 4HT exposure and persisted throughout the experiment (Fig. 3, b–e). As in the NHA/E7/RafER cells, p21Cip1 induction appeared to be independent of p53, since 1) U251 and SF126 cells lack functional p53 (29Ishii N. Maier D. Merlo A. Tada M. Sawamura Y. Diserens A-C. Van Meir E.G. Brain Pathol. 1999; 9: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 30Costanzi-Strauss E. Strauss B.E. Naviaux R.K. Haas M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); 2) U87 cells containing functional p53 (30Costanzi-Strauss E. Strauss B.E. Naviaux R.K. Haas M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) showed no increase in p53 protein levels following 4 days of 4HT exposure despite showing p21Cip1induction (Fig. 3 d); and 3) U87 + E6 cells, which lack functional p53, displayed p21Cip1 induction and growth arrest similar to that noted in U87 cells (Fig. 3 e). p16Ink4a did not have a role in growth arrest of these glioma cell lines, since all lines had homozygous deletion of p16Ink4a (21Ravi R.K. Weber E. McMahon M. Williams J.R. Baylin S. Mal A. Harter M.L. Dillehay L.E. Claudio P.P. Giordano A. Nelkin B.D. Mabry M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 30Costanzi-Strauss E. Strauss B.E. Naviaux R.K. Haas M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These results suggest that high grade gliomas, which have lost the p16Ink4a-associated senescence pathway, retain the p21Cip1-associated growth arrest pathway present in NHA. To further distinguish the Raf-activated, p21Cip1-associated arrest noted in glioma cells from the p16Ink4a-associated, senescence-like arrest seen in NHA, further studies were done in U251/RafER and SF126/RafER cells to determine the permanence of the Raf-induced arrest. When U251/RafER cells were incubated for 4 days with E2 and then incubated for 4 more days in control medium, cells resumed proliferating, as determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation (Fig.3 a). Additionally, the cells reverted back to their original morphology when the E2 was removed from culture, unlike the NHA/RafER, which maintained their altered morphology following E2 removal. Finally, when EGFPΔRaf-1:ER was inactivated in U251/RafER and SF126/RafER cells by the removal of E2from the culture, p21Cip1 expression levels dropped back to the level seen in control cells (Fig. 3, b andc). Therefore, EGFPΔRaf-1:ER activation in the glioma cell lines resulted in growth arrest that lasted only as long as Raf was activated. This arrest also was associated with increased expression of p21Cip1, which returned to normal levels with the inactivation of EGFPΔRaf- 1:ER. These data suggest that the Raf-induced, p21Cip1-associated growth arrest in these glioma cell lines is reversible and is dissimilar to the senescence seen in NHA in response to Raf activation. The data presented in this paper demonstrate the presence of two distinct inducible growth arrest pathways in astrocytic cells. These two pathways are qualitatively different in nature, with the choice of which is used dependent on the presence of a functional p16Ink4a/pRb pathway. In the case of NHA, which have an intact p16Ink4a/pRb pathway, Raf activation results in an irreversible, senescence-like growth arrest associated with increased p16Ink4a expression. However, when this pathway is disrupted, as is the case in the NHA/E7/RafER cells and in the high grade glioma cell lines, Raf activation leads to reversible growth arrest associated with increased p21Cip1 expression. The finding that normal human cells contain two distinct growth arrest pathways in response to Raf activation is both novel and consistent with previous published work. The ability of cells to undergo arrest in response to exogenous expression of either p16Ink4a or p21Cip1 is widely appreciated (18Zhu J. Woods D. McMahon M. Bishop J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2997-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 31Uhrbom L. Nister M. Westermark B. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 32Yang Z.Y. Perkins N.D. Ohno T. Nabel E.G. Nabel G.J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1052-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 33Gorospe M. Wang X. Guyton K.Z. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6654-6660Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and Ras or Raf activation in NHF leads to increased expression of both of these proteins (17Lin A.W. Marradas M. Stone J.C. van Aelst L. Serrano M. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3008-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 18Zhu J. Woods D. McMahon M. Bishop J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2997-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). In NHF, however, Raf-induced senescence-like growth arrest has been shown to occur in the absence of induced levels of p21Cip1 (18Zhu J. Woods D. McMahon M. Bishop J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2997-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), a finding reinforced by our observation that in NHA, p16Ink4a levels, but not levels of p21Cip1, increase in response to EGFPΔRaf-1:ER activation. The novel finding of the present study is that p21Cip1, whose potential function in Ras- and Raf-induced arrest in NHF was not closely examined, is associated not with senescence-like growth arrest in NHA but rather with a second distinct arrest pathway that is not associated with markers of senescence and whose presence can be noted only in the absence of the primary p16Ink4a-associated arrest pathway. The two growth arrest pathways defined in NHA appear to be mutually exclusive (i.e. functional p16Ink4a/pRb appears to be unnecessary for p21Cip1-associated arrest, and vice versa). In E7-expressing astrocytes, however, levels of pRb were low but not absent, and these cells also contained high levels of p16Ink4a. The possibility exists, therefore, that the presumed p21Cip1-associated response might in fact be simply a muted version of the already described p16Ink4a-associated arrest. Additionally, since high levels of p16Ink4a have been suggested to displace p21Cip1 from cyclin D-Cdk4 complexes and to stimulate formation of growth-inhibitory p21Cip1-cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes (34Mitra J. Dai C.Y. Somasundaram K. El-Deiry W.S. Satyamoorthy K. Herlyn M. Enders G.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3916-3928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the possibility also exists that the presumed p21Cip1-associated response might in fact be directly dependent on high levels of p16Ink4a. The qualitative difference in response to EGFPΔRaf-1:ER activation in E7-expressing cells (p21Cip1-associated arrest in the absence of SA-β-gal expression or morphologic alterations) versusthat in NHA (p16Ink4a-associated senescence-like arrest), however, argues against a single p16Ink4a-associated pathway. The presence of a p21Cip1-associated arrest pathway in p16Ink4a null tumor cell lines and the transient as opposed to permanent nature of this arrest further support the contention that two distinct arrest pathways exist in cells of glial origin. A second important finding of the present work is that even tumors which have dismantled the p16Ink4a-dependent senescence-like growth arrest pathway retain the secondary, p21Cip1-associated growth arrest mechanism. Numerous tumor cell types have been shown to respond to Raf induction by undergoing growth arrest, although in these studies either the tumor cells used were p16Ink4a/pRb-proficient (35Ravi R.K. McMahon M. Yangang Z. Williams J.R. Dillehay L.E. Nelkin B.D. Mabry M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 458-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 36Ravi R.K. Thiagalingam A. Weber E. McMahon M. Nelkin B.D. Mabry M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) or the arrest did not involve p21Cip1 (21Ravi R.K. Weber E. McMahon M. Williams J.R. Baylin S. Mal A. Harter M.L. Dillehay L.E. Claudio P.P. Giordano A. Nelkin B.D. Mabry M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We also have noted that activation of EGFPΔRaf-1:ER induces a SA-β-gal-associated arrest in p16Ink4a-proficient tumor cells derived from low grade human gliomas (data not shown). It therefore seems likely that p16Ink4a/pRb-proficient tumors retain senescence-like arrest pathways similar to those noted in normal human cells following activation of Raf. The arrest noted in the glioma cell lines used in the present study, however, was clearly different from the p16Ink4a-dependent arrest noted in NHA, since it was reversible, not associated with SA-β-gal expression, and activated even in tumor cells (U87, U251, and SF126) devoid of p16Ink4a. Significantly, the p21Cip1-associated arrest was also noted in tumor cells lacking functional p53 and p14ARF (U251, SF126). Recent studies have shown that Ras or Raf activation can induce expression of both p14ARF and the p53 inhibitor Mdm2 and that the balance of these actions may affect p53 levels and downstream p53-dependent effects (37Ries S. Biederer C. Woods D. Shifman O. Shirasawa S. Sasazuki T. McMahon M. Oren M. McCormick F. Cell. 2000; 103: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The presence of a Raf-induced, p21Cip1-associated growth arrest pathway in p14ARF and p53-deficient cells therefore suggests that the linkage between Raf induction and increased p21Cip1 expression is independent of not only p16Ink4a but also of effects of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway on the p14ARF/Mdm2/p53 pathway. Having established the presence of a secondary p21Cip1-associated, Raf-stimulated arrest pathway in NHA, the question arises as to how Raf induces p21Cip1expression and how p21Cip1 induces growth arrest in the absence of pRb/p16Ink4a. With regard to the latter question, p21Cip1 has been shown to inhibit the action of E2F in human cervical and bladder carcinoma cell lines that lack functional pRb (38Dimri G.P. Nakanishi M. Desprez P-Y. Smith J.R. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2987-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), suggesting that the p21Cip1-associated arrest noted in glioma cell lines and, in particular, in the pRb/p16Ink4a-deficient SF126 line may similarly involve E2F. Alternatively, p21Cip1 may regulate the activities of cyclin E-Cdk2 and/or cyclin A-Cdk2 complexes (19Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4961) Google Scholar). With regard to the former question, p53-independent induction of p21Cip1 has been associated with a variety of transcription factors including Sp1, Sp3, STAT proteins, and E2Fs (39Gartel A.L. Tyner A.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 280-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 40Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Su W-C.S. You Z-H. Iwamoto Y. Fu X-Y. Science. 1996; 272: 719-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 41Gartel A.L. Najmabadi F. Goufman E. Tyner A.L. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 961-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Raf-induced increases in any of these transcription factors could therefore lead to p53-independent increases in p21Cip1 levels. These possibilities and, in particular, the interplay between Raf, E2F, and p21Cip1, remain to be examined. Finally, the identification of two distinct growth arrest pathways in astrocytes and astrocytic tumors may be important both to understanding the genesis of tumors and to effectively stopping their growth. Approximately half of grade III anaplastic astrocytomas have inactivation of at least one component of the p16Ink4a/pRb pathway, and homozygous deletion of p16Ink4a is seen in up to 70% of grade IV glioblastoma multiforme (13Louis D.N. Brain Pathol. 1997; 7: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Thus, most glial tumors, by dismantling the p16Ink4a/pRb pathway, have eliminated the possibility of Ras/Raf-mediated p16Ink4a-associated permanent growth arrest. Inactivation of p21Cip1, however, has rarely been reported in gliomas or in other human tumors (13Louis D.N. Brain Pathol. 1997; 7: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 19Sherr C.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1672-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (4961) Google Scholar, 42Hall M. Peters G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 68: 67-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that tumor development may select for cells with Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway activation high enough to promote growth yet low enough to avoid triggering p21Cip1-dependent growth arrest. Indeed, this appears to be the case in experimental human gliomas created by overexpression of mutant Ras, which, despite having very high levels of activated Ras, have only modest levels of ERK1/2 activation. 2C. P. Fanton, M. McMahon, and R. O. Pieper, unpublished observation. More importantly, these results support the idea that intact arrest pathways lie dormant in tumors (43Weintraub S.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 541-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), including gliomas. Selective activation of these pathways in tumor cells would represent an ideal, noncytotoxic way to prevent the growth and the ultimate fatal consequences of tumors. The definition of at least two distinct growth arrest pathways in cells is a first step toward this goal."

As a result of water release/rebinding from/to the coproduct formation site the Compound I intermediate may exist in two forms: a “wet” form, Compound I(H2O), in which a water molecule is present at or near the site of coproduct water formation, and Compound I, in which the coproduct water formation site is “dry.” It is postulated that the absence or presence of a water molecule at this site provides the structural basis for a redox pathway switching mechanism, such that the transition states for 2-electron equivalent reduction of Compound I intermediates are accessible in the dry form, but that in the wet form only 1-electron equivalent processes are possible, unless release of water can be stimulated. This concept provides the basis of a general mechanism in which the classical functional distinction between catalases and peroxidases, as well as the more complex behavior observed in halide oxidation and halogenation reactions, appear as particular cases in which variations in the degree of retention of water at the coproduct formation site influence Compound I reactivity.

This concept provides the basis of a general mechanism in which the classical functional distinction between catalases and peroxidases, as well as the more complex behavior observed in halide oxidation and halogenation reactions, appear as particular cases in which variations in the degree of retention of water at the coproduct formation site influence Compound I reactivity. The functional diversity of the enzymes of the heme peroxidase and catalase superfamily is well documented (1Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases. John Wiley and Sons Inc., New York1999Google Scholar). At the same time marked similarities in the form of the catalytic mechanisms of the enzymes have emerged, notably the invariable involvement of a Compound I intermediate, which stores both oxidizing equivalents of hydrogen peroxide. A puzzling contrast, which still defies interpretation, is presented by the classical distinction in behavior of the Compound I intermediates of horseradish peroxidase and catalase. The former react preferentially by 1-electron equivalent oxidation of a wide range of donor substrates and show no significant ability to oxidize hydrogen peroxide, whereas the latter show a near-monofunctional catalatic behavior, rapidly oxidizing hydrogen peroxide directly to oxygen in a 2-electron equivalent redox process but possessing only rudimentary peroxidatic activity. Despite the availability of a considerable number of crystal structures for both types of enzyme (1Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases. John Wiley and Sons Inc., New York1999Google Scholar), no structural bases for these redox pathway “preferences” have been assigned. Although it is true that in some cases (e.g. yeast cytochrome-c peroxidase) there are variations in the structures of the intermediates that may profoundly affect reactivity (2Poulos T.L. Fenna R.E. Sigel H. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. Marcel Dekker, New York1994: 25-75Google Scholar), more generally the data present the paradox of oxidizing intermediates with very similar (ferryl porphyrin π-cation radical) core structures (admittedly in different protein environments), which possess very different redox reactivities. In this report, the possibility is examined that a factor in the formation of Compound I, which may be of crucial importance, has been overlooked, namely that water, which is coproduced with Compound I intermediates, may profoundly influence the subsequent redox reactivity of these species, depending on the extent to which it (or a replacement provided via a reversible water exchange process) is retained at, or near, its site of formation. In the first phase of the catalytic cycles of the enzymes of the heme peroxidase and catalase superfamily the native, Fe(III), enzyme is oxidized by hydrogen peroxide to a Compound I intermediate, and a water molecule is formed (1Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases. John Wiley and Sons Inc., New York1999Google Scholar). The process is commonly expressed as an elementary bimolecular reaction. E(native enzyme)+H2O2→Compound I+H2O REACTION1 The Compound I species are key oxidizing intermediates in the enzymatic reactions and Reaction 1 is in accord with the established retention in a Compound I heme of one oxygen atom from its parent hydrogen peroxide molecule, which resides in a ferryl (Fe(IV)=O) center. The second oxidizing equivalent of H2O2is present, commonly (1Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases. John Wiley and Sons Inc., New York1999Google Scholar) but not invariably (2Poulos T.L. Fenna R.E. Sigel H. Metal Ions in Biological Systems. Marcel Dekker, New York1994: 25-75Google Scholar), as an associated porphyrin π-cation radical. Although the formation, structures, and reactivities of the Compounds I have been extensively studied, the formation of the coproduct water molecule has been regarded as merely a stoichiometric requirement of the reaction and possible mechanistic consequences have not been considered. When the kinetics of water release and rebinding in Compound I formation are examined in detail, the possibility becomes evident that the fate of the product water may play a significant role in influencing the reactivity of the Compound I species as oxidants. Reaction 1 encapsulates some remarkable enzyme chemistry and yet it is an inadequate mechanistic description of Compound I formation in the following two respects: (i) The product water molecule is formed within the enzyme active site, near the heme Fe center. Release of this water molecule to the body of the aqueous solvent is not instantaneous and, in different enzymes, involves journeys of different lengths and complexity, very likely different rates and possibly different mechanisms. In the simplest representation, we can consider a two-state model comprising two distinguishable Compound I species; a “wet” form, Compound I (H2O), in which the coproduct water molecule is present at, or near, its site of formation and a “dry” form, Compound I, in which the coproduct water molecule has left its site of formation and has either joined, or is on its way to joining the bulk solvent. These two species are connected by the process of product water release shown in Reaction 4 (see below). Reaction 4 is an intrinsically reversible process and the reverse, water-rebinding reaction is considered later. (ii) In an earlier discussion, Jones and Dunford (3Jones P. Dunford H.B. J. Theor. Biol. 1977; 64: 457-470Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar) argued for the need to include a classical, reversibly formed enzyme-H2O2 complex as a precursor of Compound I (Reaction 2 below). Compound I is then formed via an intramolecular transformation of this complex (Reaction 3). Thus the apparently simple bimolecular process of Reaction 1 conceals a more complex situation involving (at least) three, kinetically distinct stages, as in Mechanism I as follows. E+H2O2⇄E·H2O2 E·H2O2→Compound I(H2O) Compound I(H2O)⇄Compound I+H2O REACTIONS2–4 Crystallographic studies have revealed the presence of a number of water molecules in the distal active site cavities of peroxidases and catalases. These water molecules are often referred to as “structural,” but “resident” may be a more suitable term, because, although possessing some positional stability, they are not (with one apparent exception (4Murshudov G.N. Melik-Adamyan W.R. Grebenko A.I. Barynin U.V. Vagin A.A. Vainshtein B.K. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar)) ligands to the heme iron. Moreover, in several cases some, or all of them, are either known (5Fulop V. Phizackerley R.P. Soltis S.M. Clifton I.J. Wakatsuki S. Erman J. Hadju J. Edwards S.L. Structure. 1994; 2: 201-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) or believed (6Fita I. Rossmann M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 21-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) to be displaced in the course of Compound I formation. Dunford (1Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases. John Wiley and Sons Inc., New York1999Google Scholar) concludes that the consensus of a variety of techniques is that penta-coordinate heme Fe(III) is usually, perhaps invariably, present in the active forms of the native peroxidases. Inactive hexa-coordinate forms, with water or hydroxyl ion as the sixth, distal ligand to iron, may be induced by pH or thermal stress, by the absence of essential metal-ion cofactors, or, in the case of yeast cytochrome-c peroxidase (CCP), 1The abbreviations used are: CCPcytochrome-c peroxidaseHRPhorseradish peroxidaseMPOmyeloperoxidaseCPOchloroperoxidaseTMPDN,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine by a little understood aging process. However, the active forms invariably possess a water molecule, which is not liganded to but resides nearby the heme Fe(III) and is held with some tenacity in a hydrogen bonding network involving the catalytically important His and Arg residues and usually at least one more water molecule. The situation with the catalases is by no means clear-cut. cytochrome-c peroxidase horseradish peroxidase myeloperoxidase chloroperoxidase N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine The only direct evidence of resident water molecule displacement in the process of Compound I formation comes from a comparative crystallographic study of native CCP and Compound I intermediate (5Fulop V.

Structure. 1994; 2: 201-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), which showed that three water molecules were resident in the heme pocket of the active, native enzyme but only one remained in the Compound I crystal. This study provides no information on the kinetics of the process. The comment by Fita and Rossmann (6Fita I. Rossmann M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 21-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) that Lanir and Schejter (7Lanir A. Schejter A. FEBS Lett. 1975; 55: 254-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) had observed the rapid release of a water molecule accompanying catalase Compound I formation is erroneous; unfortunately this interesting experiment was not attempted. 2Abel Schejter, personal communication, August 2000. Taking the above result for CCP, and the crystal structure for native beef liver catalase, Fita and Rossman (6Fita I. Rossmann M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 21-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) used computer graphics techniques to model the reaction of beef liver catalase with the pseudo-substrate ethyl hydroperoxide. Two resident water molecules were included in the model of the heme pocket of the native enzyme, although they had not been observed in the crystal structure (but two appropriately located water molecules were subsequently observed in the distal pocket of a peroxide resistant mutant of Proteus mirabilis catalase (8Gouet P. Jouve H.-M. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 933-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar)). As the model reaction proceeded the resident water molecules were displaced when the hydroperoxide function of ethyl hydroperoxide entered the constrained distal cavity to form a precursor complex of Compound I. As Compound I formed, the coproduct ethanol was held in an appropriate orientation for oxidation to form acetaldehyde. In the above model the species Compound I (EtOH), which undergoes an intramolecular redox reaction, is clearly an analogue of Compound I (H2O), formed with H2O2 according to Mechanism I. Palcic and Dunford (9Palcic M.M. Dunford H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6128-6132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have commented on evidence of kinetic complexity in the reactions of alkyl hydroperoxides with catalase in earlier reports (10Schonbaum G.R. Chance B. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1976: 313-408Google Scholar). Although ethyl hydroperoxide is converted mainly to acetaldehyde, some ethanol is also formed. In contrast, with methyl hydroperoxide the product is 85% methanol. The low yield of formaldehyde may be attributed to a rapid diffusion of methanol from the active site, whereas the much higher yield of acetaldehyde implies a slower release of ethanol. These different rates of alcohol release parallel the decreasing rates of reaction of alkyl hydroperoxides with native enzyme with increasing substrate size. Two inferences can be made from these results: (i) slow release or retention of Compound I coproduct may influence subsequent redox chemistry, and (ii) it is very probable that coproduct water release from Compound I formation with catalase and hydrogen peroxide is a rapid process. The alkyl hydroperoxides are unusual pseudo-substrates in that the alcohol coproducts are themselves substrates for catalase Compound I. In most studies the choice of pseudo-substrate has been made on the basis of reducing or eliminating further reactions; peroxyacetic acid has proved a useful choice in several cases (9Palcic M.M. Dunford H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6128-6132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Jones P. Middlemiss D.N. Biochem.

Commun. 1980; 94: 1123-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and was used to examine acetic acid release following catalase Compound I formation using the (slow) technique of pH measurement (13Jones P. Middlemiss D.N. Biochem. J. 1974; 143: 473-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Studies of the formation of peroxidase Compound I with m-nitroperoxybenzoic acid (14Schonbaum G.R. Lo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3353-3360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were important in helping to establish that the peroxidic O–O bond was cleaved in the reaction by measuring them-nitrobenzoate coproduct formed, although slow conventional spectrophotometry could not assess either the extent to which coproduct was retained in the active site or its rate of release. Adediran and Dunford (15Adediran S.A. Dunford H.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 132: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) used a combination of transient and steady-state kinetic studies with HRP and p-nitroperoxybenzoic acid to show that the rates of Compound I formation and coproduct carboxylic acid formation are the same within experimental error, and it was argued that this proved that the acyl moiety of the peroxyacid is not retained in Compound I. However the processes of coproduct formation and release are not identical, and it is not clear that the absorption spectrophotometric techniques employed can distinguish them. In general, in stopped-flow studies of reactions of preformed Compound I with donor substrates, the kinetics were independent of the oxidant progenitor of Compound I (16Cotton M.L. Dunford H.B. Can. J. Chem. 1973; 51: 582-587Crossref Google Scholar), suggesting substantially complete coproduct release, although, once again, the manipulation of the Compound I solutions, in a conventional stopped-flow spectrophotometer, takes considerable time. For the arguments developed below, it is the competitive interaction of the pseudo-substrate coproduct and the solvent water with the Compound I site that is significant. Reversible release and rebinding of the coproduct would lead to essentially complete release, because the coproduct concentration in the solution is vanishingly small compared with the concentration of water in the bulk solution. This would allow the onset of the water binding/release process, which, if equilibrium was established sufficiently rapidly, would ensure that the Compound I species formed with a variety of pseudo-substrates would all show the same behavior, identical to Compound I formed with hydrogen peroxide. The vast body of experimental studies (1Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases. John Wiley and Sons Inc., New York1999Google Scholar) show that a wide variety of redox reaction types occur in the reactions of Compound I species with reducing (donor) substrates: 1-electron equivalent and 2-electron equivalent processes; atom and electron transfers; reaction via the ferryl center and via a porphyrin π-cation radical heme edge; reactions involving a protein radical or a redox active cofactor; and reactions within the distal active site cavity or via electron transfer from a remote proximal donor. All Compounds I support reaction with a wide range of reducing substrates, but in some cases an overwhelming reducing substrate specificity in vitro suggests likely biological function. The relatively recent accumulation of enzyme crystal structures has provided valuable suggestions as to the structural origins of substrate specificity but no firm conclusions about the factors influencing redox mechanisms and kinetics. Although it would be absurd to suggest that coproduct water release/rebinding kinetics in Compound I formation could be the sole determinant of redox diversity; it is argued here that this process may have a particular and important significance. If release of coproduct water to the bulk solvent in Compound I formation (the forward reaction in Reaction 4) is dissociative, it is a unimolecular process governed by a rate constant,k o. The reverse reaction is a bimolecular process, which is pseudo-first order (rate constant,k i), because the bulk concentration of water is effectively invariant. The equilibrium constant for Reaction 4 may then be expressed by K =k o/k i = [Compound I]/[Compound I (H2O)]. At the moment of formation of Compound I, the system in Reaction 4 is entirely on the left side of the process. Unless other perturbing factors intrude, the reaction will approach equilibrium with an effective rate constant, k = k o+ k i. At present we have no quantitative information about the values of these rate constants. If it is supposed that equilibrium in this process is rapidly established during the steady-state cycling of the enzymes, two extreme cases can be distinguished: (i) K ≫ 1; so that the intermediate is overwhelmingly present in the dry form, Compound I; (ii) K≪ 1; the wet form Compound I (H2O) predominates. In the interaction of a reducing substrate molecule with the intermediate the transition states formed with Compound I (H2O) and Compound I are “pseudo-isomeric” in the sense that, in the latter case, the water molecule produced in Reaction 3, although remaining in the system, is no longer interacting with the enzyme active site. Even if it fulfills no other role, the water molecule in Compound I(H2O) is occupying space within a crucial region of the active site, so that activated complex geometries, which are accessible in reactions of Compound I, may either be inaccessible or not immediately accessible in reactions of Compound I (H2O). The potential for redox reaction diversity is evident. Dunford (1Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases. John Wiley and Sons Inc., New York1999Google Scholar) has compared a “side-by-side” mechanism (proposed by Jones and Suggett (17Jones P. Suggett A. Biochem. J. 1968; 110: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar)) and the “linear mechanism” of Fita and Rossmann (6Fita I. Rossmann M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 21-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) and concluded that there was little to choose between them, except that the space demands in a constrained active site were smaller for the latter mechanism. Both models were based on the, much earlier, formal “peroxidatic” mechanism of Britton Chance and are very much products of the influences of their times—in 1968 kinetics and UV-visible spectroscopy dominated; in 1985 the advent of enzyme crystal structures was making a profound impact. In fairness to the side-by-side model, it was proposed when Compound I was still thought of as a classical (albeit peculiar) enzyme-substrate complex. If it is adapted to the ideas presented above, it essentially suggests that the reductant H2O2 molecule in the “catalatic” process reacts with Catalase I (H2O). In contrast, in the Fita and Rossmann model (6Fita I. Rossmann M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 21-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) the emphasis is on the influence of the enzyme molecular structure. The water molecules resident in the distal heme pocket and the coproduct water molecule simply vanish from the model as Compound I is formed and, therefore, could not be considered as influences on its reactivity. It is suggested below that a model, which retains the essential features of Fita and Rossmann's model but which also takes into account the concept of water release kinetics described above, is more satisfactory than either earlier model. In formal terms the proposed mechanism is shown in Mechanism II, in which the fate of the water molecules initially resident in the active site of the native enzyme is ignored for simplicity (but see below). Mechanism II most notably provides a rationale for the observation that Compound I reacts with hydrogen peroxide in two distinct ways: (i) a 2-electron equivalent reaction (the catalatic reaction, Reaction 8 below), leading to completion of the enzymatic cycle; (ii) a 1-electron equivalent reaction (Reaction 9) yielding the inert Catalase Compound II and hence resulting in enzyme inactivation (18Chance B. Biochem. J. 1950; 46: 387-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The mechanism also accounts for the observed limiting steady-state catalatic kinetics at high [H2O2] and, more particularly, for the finding that the same value of Km = 1.1m applies to both the catalatic and inactivation reactions (19Jones P. Suggett A. Biochem. J. 1968; 110: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cat+H2O2⇄Cat(H2O2) Cat(H2O2)→Cat I(H2O) Cat I(H2O)⇄Cat I+H2O Cat I+H2O2→Cat+O2+H2O Cat I(H2O)+H2O2→Cat II REACTIONS5–9 It is suggested that equilibration in Compound I coproduct water release and rebinding (Reaction 7) lies almost completely in the direction of release (K ≫ 1) so that: (i) the major catalatic reaction is carried by the dry form of the Compound I intermediate, Cat I; (ii) very occasionally the transition state for Reaction 8 is inaccessible to an incoming hydrogen peroxide molecule, because it encounters the wet form of Compound I, with a water molecule at or near the Compound I coproduct water formation site, and the alternative 1-electron equivalent Reaction 9 occurs. Catalases are very efficient but not perfect enzymes. WithMicrococcus lysodeikticus catalase inactivation via Reaction 9 occurs about once in every 108 cycles (19Jones P. Suggett A. Biochem. J. 1968; 110: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For mammalian catalases inactivation by this reaction may be repaired by reduction of Compound II by the NADPH cofactor (20Kirkman H.N. Gaetani G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4343-4348Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 21Kirkman H.N. Galiano S. Gaetani G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 660-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzyme selectivity is controlled partly by the narrow, deep channels leading to the heme site, so that larger substrates (both oxidizing and reducing) are much less favored reactants. Most remarkable is the overwhelming preference for hydrogen peroxide as reducing substrate. Fita and Rossmann (6Fita I. Rossmann M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 21-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) examined the structure of the main channel into the heme site in beef liver catalase and concluded that it can be described in terms of five sections; the outermost section (I) formed primarily by polar residues, sections II–IV showing gradually increasing hydrophobicity, and section V a hydrophobic neck. In the present context this suggests that a water molecule leaving the active site would find its motion constrained toward release to the bulk solvent by a hydrophilicity gradient. Dunford (1Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases. John Wiley and Sons Inc., New York1999Google Scholar) has noted that “existing” mechanisms do not explain the necessity for the tetrameric enzyme structure for catalatic activity. As Fita and Rossmann point out (6Fita I. Rossmann M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 21-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), R-axis-related subunit residues contribute substantially to the channel lining and hence, in the present interpretation to the release of water from the equivalent active sites of the tetrameric enzyme molecules. If, at equilibrium, the active site cavities of native catalase each contain two resident water molecules (which are expelled by hydrogen peroxide as precursor complex is formed) and the water molecule coproduct of Compound I formation is then involved in the exchange Reaction 7, Reaction 1 must be revised to E+H2O2→Compound I+(3­α)H2O REACTION10 where α (near zero) is the fraction of product water molecules remaining within the active site at release/rebinding equilibrium for Compound I. Further water traffic is involved in the second phase of the catalytic cycle (reduction of Compound I to native enzyme, Reaction 8). If all product water molecules are expelled as they are formed, the final process of the cycle must be the rehydration of the active site of dry Fe(III) enzyme to form the equilibrium native enzyme.E(dry)+2H2O=E(native) REACTION11 Could catalases use a process of water traffic management to ensure catalytic efficiency? An intriguing possibility is that the first cycle of equilibrium, native enzyme may be a priming cycle in which the resident water molecules are cleared from the active site, allowing further cycles to occur with minimum water traffic through the active site until hydrogen peroxide is exhausted. The selection of enzyme molecules with two (or more) resident water molecules in the active site cavity may be advantageous according to the following argument: (i) Equilibration in the rehydration of dry enzyme may be attained only slowly, because binding involves a ternary process, or more likely, consecutive bimolecular processes where there is little stabilization for the intermediate state, E(dry)+H2O⇄E(H2O) E(H2O)+H2O⇄E(H2O)2 REACTIONS12and13 but, in the equilibrium form, the water molecules may achieve positional stability both by their mutual interactions and their interactions with the active site components. Equilibrium will be established in a well-incubated enzyme molecule in solution or in a crystal bathed in mother liquor. (ii) The binding of hydrogen peroxide to equilibrium native enzyme in the first cycle, with expulsion of resident water molecules, involves the disruption of a hydrogen bonding network and a significant energy demand. If, at the end of this cycle, the substrate level is sufficiently high that its bimolecular binding to dry native enzyme competes with ternary rehydration, the second and subsequent cycles will occur without rehydration and with minimal water traffic through the active site, until the substrate level has reduced sufficiently to allow rebinding of resident water to the native enzyme. It is not clear that currently available data permit a test of the priming cycle hypothesis. If it is valid, an interesting corollary is that single turnover, pre-steady state (stopped-flow) studies of Compound I formation examine the enzyme in a different “native” state from that which persists during most of steady-state turnover. The failure of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and most peroxidases, to display catalatic activity has presented a longstanding and unsolved puzzle for mechanistic interpretation. The problem is not thermodynamic; HRP shows a pseudo-catalatic activity in the presence of iodide, which involves the extra-enzymic reaction of hypoiodous acid with hydrogen peroxide (1Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases. John Wiley and Sons Inc., New York1999Google Scholar). Lactoperoxidase and thyroid peroxidase show similar activities (22Magnusson R.P. Taurog A. Dorris M.L. J. Biol.

Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 34: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although oxysterols will dramatically reduce the hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase activity and therefore essentially shut down cholesterol synthesis, their induction of apoptosis cannot be rescued by adding excess cholesterol (17Thompson E.B. Ayala-Torres S. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 34: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This suggests that OSBP may be playing a central role in the oxysterol-induced apoptosis.The oxysterol-binding protein is a member of a family of proteins that share structural and possibly functional similarities (18Laitinen S. Olkkonen V.M. Ehnholm C. Ikonen E. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2204-2211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our interest in the OSBPs is to investigate their role and that of their oxysterol ligands in ocular tissues. More specifically we are interested in determining whether OSBPs and oxysterols are involved in the pathogenesis of age-related ocular diseases such as macular degeneration and cataracts. There is existing evidence suggesting that oxysterol cytotoxicity may be playing a role in the formation of cataracts (19Girao H. Mota M.C. Ramalho J. Pereira P. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 66: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).A recent study found an OSBP-like protein expressed exclusively in metastatic tumor cells (20Fournier M.V. Guimaraes F.C. Paschoal E.M. Ronco L.V. Carvalho M.G.C. Pardee A.B. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3748-3753PubMed Google Scholar). The study linked this OSBP-like gene to tumor dissemination. This publication did not provide a complete molecular characterization of this OSBP, but alignments performed in our laboratory indicate that it is likely our novel OSBP. If this is indeed correct, this makes the identification and characterization of this gene a very important finding. It may also suggest that oxysterols could be playing a role not only in atherosclerosis but in cancer as well.One of the genes presented in our study is the original OSBP and will be referred to as OSBP1. The novel homolog will be referred to as OSBP2. We have cloned and characterized the OSBP2 gene as well as completed the molecular characterization of the OSBP1 gene. A detailed comparative analysis of OSBP1 and OSBP2 at the molecular and biological level is presented.DISCUSSIONWe are reporting the molecular and biological characterization of a novel oxysterol-binding protein, OSBP2, and extend the molecular characterization of the previously reported OSBP1. We became interested in OSBP2 because of its high and almost unique expression in the retina as well as its striking similarity to OSBP1. Both genes contain 14 similarly sized exons and nearly identical intron-exon junctions (Fig. 1, Table I). The genes share a high degree of similarity both at the nucleotide (Fig. 1) and protein levels (Fig.2) and may have derived from a gene duplication event. At the peptide level, OSBP1 and OSBP2 share the oxysterol-binding domain and the pleckstrin homology domain (7Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and are almost identical toward the C terminus. Recent evidence from other investigators (18Laitinen S. Olkkonen V.M. Ehnholm C. Ikonen E. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2204-2211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and from unpublished data within our group indicates that oxysterol-binding proteins are a large and complex family of genes.Although OSBP1 and OSBP2 are structurally very similar, they undergo different transcriptional and posttranslational regulation. Although OSBP1 mRNA is readily detectable by Northern blot in most human tissues, OSBP2 mRNA expression is relatively specific to retina, pineal, testis, and fetal liver (Fig. 3). The expression in fetal liver may suggest that there is developmental regulation of OSBP2 and may correlate with earlier observations that implicated oxysterols in apoptosis control during development (11Smith L.L. Johnson B.H. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1989; 7: 285-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The OSBP1 mRNA is more highly expressed in the macula than in the peripheral retina (Fig.4 A) but the protein seems to be equally distributed. This may be because of the much higher metabolic activity of the macula, which may induce a greater OSBP1 turnover. In contrast, OSBP2 mRNA seems to be readily detectable in both the macula and peripheral neural retina but the protein is only detectable by Western blot in the P2-detergent retinal subfraction (Fig. 5 C). These Western blots (Fig. 5) suggest that there is more OSBP1 than OSBP2 protein in the retina. It should be noted that there is 13 times more total protein in the S2 fraction than in the P2-detergent fraction. Thus, unless there is a very large difference in the antibody affinities (>10-fold), there is probably more OSBP1 than OSBP2 in the retina.Immunocytochemistry localized OSBP1 and OSBP2 in similar but not identical regions of the retina (Fig. 6). The localization of OSBP1 and OSBP2 to the inner retina is complex involving several retinal cell types and possibly subtypes, and it is difficult to speculate as to its meaning without further examination by electron and/or confocal microscopy. However, the localization of these OSBPs to the RPE is of particular interest for several reasons. The RPE expresses the LDL receptor (25Noske U.M. Schmidt-Erfurth U. Meyer C. Diddens H. Ophthalmologie. 1998; 95: 814-819Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and its proximity to the choriocapillaris makes it a likely target for the uptake of blood LDL. The RPE is also probably serving as a cholesterol source for other retinal cells such as the photoreceptors that constantly synthesize rod outer segment membranes. LDL is one of the major sources of oxidized cholesterol and considering the cytotoxity demonstrated by these molecules, it is likely that the RPE has some form of mechanism to bind these oxysterols as they are released from the LDL complex.The oxysterol binding activity of OSBP2 was determined by incubating the detergent-extracted P2 pellet fraction (P2-detergent) with tritiated oxysterols (25HC and 7KC) and fractionating the proteins by HPLC (Fig. 7 B). The S2 soluble fraction, which lacks OSBP2, was also treated identically to serve as a control (Fig.7 A). These results suggest that the majority of the 7KC binding activity is present in the P2-detergent fraction and that this activity is associated with immunoreactivity to OSBP2 (Fig.7 C). Although the experiments in Fig. 7 were not designed to determine binding constants, the data suggest that OSBP2 preferentially binds 7KC and has little or no affinity for 25HC or CH. The binding observed in the void volume (11 to 12 min) is probably because of nonspecific association of these sterols with macromolecules such as hyaluronic acid, which is present in all of our retinal fractions. There may also be other OSBPs in these fractions that associate with these macromolecules. Unpublished results from our laboratory indicate that there are at least 12 different oxysterol-binding protein-like genes in the human genome and many of these are present in the retina. Thus, until these OSBPs are better understood, oxysterol-binding activity in any tissue should be considered to originate from a mixture of binding proteins. The relatively low oxysterol binding activity detected in the S2 fraction may be because of the low concentration of oxysterols used (0.4 nm) or perhaps the narrow choices of oxysterols used (7KC and 25HC). There are over 80 different forms of oxidized cholesterol (26Schroffer G.J. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 361-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar), and as can be seen by the relatively high affinity of OSBP2 for 7KC, different OSBPs may have different affinities for different oxysterols. The identification of the oxysterol binding activity of OSBP2 was facilitated by several factors: OSBP2 fractionated relatively cleanly to the P2-detergent soluble fraction, the availability of a specific OSBP2 antibody, and the high affinity of OSBP2 for 7KC, which allowed it to bind 13% of the total counts at a concentration of 0.4 nm. This allowed the detection of OSBP2 with very small amounts of tritiated oxysterols. Although OSBP1 is also present in the P2-detergent fraction, no OSBP1 immunoreactivity was present in this fraction.OSBPs and their oxysterol ligands may be playing an important role in the pathogenesis of age-related ocular diseases. A recent study has shown that there is a gradual accumulation of LDL cholesterol in the choriocapillaris and Bruch's membrane (27Curcio C.A. Millican C.L. Kruth H.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 265-274PubMed Google Scholar) with aging. This coupled with the high metabolic rate and cholesterol needs of the retina, especially the macula, make this area of the eye especially susceptible to oxysterol accumulation. The functions of the OSBPs and particularly OSBP2 with its high and almost exclusive expression in the retina could play an important role in macular degenerations. The oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP)1 has been known for many years and has been fairly well characterized biochemically. It was originally detected as a cytosolic protein capable of binding 25-hydroxycholesterol (1Kandutsch A.A. Thompson E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10813-10821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). OSBP, as its name implies, is capable of binding a wide variety of oxidized forms of cholesterol with high affinity (2Taylor F.R. Kandutsch A.A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1985; 38: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It was partially purified and characterized in mouse-cultured fibroblast cells (3Taylor F.R. Saucier S.E. Shown E.P. Parish E.J. Kandutsch A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12382-12387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA was first isolated in rabbit (4Dawson P.A. Ridgway N.D. Slaughter C.A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16798-16803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), then in human (5Levanon D. Hsieh C.L. Francke U. Dawson P.A. Ridgway N.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Genomics. 1990; 7: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). OSBP is known to translocate to the Golgi apparatus after binding to oxysterols (6Ridgway N.D. Dawson P.A. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), and this translocation is mediated via a pleckstrin homology domain near the N terminus of the protein (7Levine T.P. Munro S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 729-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). OSBP is phosphorylated in the Golgi (8Ridgway N.D. Lagace T.A. Cook H.W. Byers D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31621-31628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and this phosphorylation and Golgi transport seem to be dependent on cholesterol trafficking and sphingomyelin hydrolysis (9Storey M.K. Byers D.M. Cook H.W. Ridgway N.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 10Ridgway N.D. Badiani K. Byers D.M. Cook H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1390: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Oxysterols accumulate in tissues and can exert potent pharmacological effects on cellular sterol biosynthesis and uptake. Oxysterols are oxidized byproducts of cholesterol (11Smith L.L. Johnson B.H. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1989; 7: 285-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) that cause cytotoxic effects on a variety of cells. This oxysterol cytotoxicity is exerted via apoptosis and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis (12Peng S.-K. Taylor C.B. Hill J.C. Morin R.J. Atherosclerosis. 1985; 54: 121-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 13Brown A.J. Jessup W. Atherosclerosis. 1999; 142: 1-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Oxysterol cytotoxicity has been demonstrated in vascular endothelial cells (14Boissonneault G.A. Henning B. Ouyang C. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1991; 196: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), smooth muscle cells (15Peng S.K. Hu B. Morin R.J. J. Clin. Lab. Anal. 1991; 5: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and cultured neuroretinal cells (16Chang J.Y. Liu L.-Z. Curr. Eye Res. 1997; 17: 95-103Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2120728493,"Gyp6p from yeast belongs to the GYP family of Ypt/Rab-specific GTPase-activating proteins, and Ypt6p is its preferred substrate (Strom, M., Vollmer, P., Tan, T. J., and Gallwitz, D. (1993) Nature 361, 736–739). We have investigated the kinetic parameters of Gyp6p/Ypt6p interactions and find that Gyp6p accelerates the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ypt6p (0.0002 min−1) by a factor of 5 × 106 and that they have a very low affinity for its preferred substrate(K m = 592 μm). Substitution with alanine of several arginines, which Gyp6p shares with other GYP family members, resulted in significant inhibition of GAP activity. Replacement of arginine-155 with either alanine or lysine abolished its GAP activity, indicating a direct involvement of this strictly conserved arginine in catalysis. Physical interaction of the catalytically inactive Gyp6(R155A) mutant GAP with Ypt6 wild-type and Ypt6 mutant proteins could be demonstrated with the two-hybrid system. Short N-terminal and C-terminal truncations of Gyp6p resulted in a complete loss of GAP activity and Ypt6p binding, showing that in contrast to two other Gyp proteins studied previously, most of the 458 amino acid-long Gyp6p sequence is required to form a three-dimensional structure that allows substrate binding and catalysis. Gyp6p from yeast belongs to the GYP family of Ypt/Rab-specific GTPase-activating proteins, and Ypt6p is its preferred substrate (Strom, M., Vollmer, P., Tan, T. J., and Gallwitz, D. (1993) Nature 361, 736–739). We have investigated the kinetic parameters of Gyp6p/Ypt6p interactions and find that Gyp6p accelerates the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ypt6p (0.0002 min−1) by a factor of 5 × 106 and that they have a very low affinity for its preferred substrate(K m = 592 μm). Substitution with alanine of several arginines, which Gyp6p shares with other GYP family members, resulted in significant inhibition of GAP activity. Replacement of arginine-155 with either alanine or lysine abolished its GAP activity, indicating a direct involvement of this strictly conserved arginine in catalysis. Physical interaction of the catalytically inactive Gyp6(R155A) mutant GAP with Ypt6 wild-type and Ypt6 mutant proteins could be demonstrated with the two-hybrid system. Short N-terminal and C-terminal truncations of Gyp6p resulted in a complete loss of GAP activity and Ypt6p binding, showing that in contrast to two other Gyp proteins studied previously, most of the 458 amino acid-long Gyp6p sequence is required to form a three-dimensional structure that allows substrate binding and catalysis. Monomeric GTPases of the Ras superfamily act as regulators in many vital cellular processes. They switch their conformation depending on the nucleotide being bound. Ras and Ras-like proteins bind GDP and GTP specifically and with high affinity, and they are able to hydrolyze the bound GTP but with low efficiency. In general, as the switch from the GTP-bound to the GDP-bound conformation results in the termination of the functional stimulus by a given GTPase, the acceleration of the slow intrinsic GTPase activity (often far below 1 min−1) must be an important device to regulate the activity of the regulator.

These sequences are localized within the catalytically active region of the yeast GAPs, Gyp1p and Gyp7p (6Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and we refer to this region as the GYP domain. However, additional sequences C-terminal of the GYP domain are required for GAP activity (6Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Eight yeast proteins and one mammalian protein containing the GYP domain are known to be Ypt/Rab-specific GAPs (3Strom M. Vollmer P. Tan T.J. Gallwitz D.

The length of the eight GYP family members in yeast ranges from 458 to 950 amino acid residues. The GYP domain, which in Gyp1p and Gyp7p is localized within the C-terminal half of the proteins, covers a region of approximately 300 amino acids. The N-terminal halves of both GAPs can be deleted without affecting the catalytic activity or the substrate specificityin vitro (6Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that these sequences serve other purposes within the cell, such as the interaction with other cellular components to direct the GAPs to their scene of action. With 458 amino acids, the Ypt6p-specific Gyp6p (3Strom M. Vollmer P. Tan T.J. Gallwitz D. Nature. 1993; 361: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) is the smallest of the eight known Ypt/Rab GAPs from yeast and apparently has little sequence space outside the GAP catalytic domain. This observation and the fact that its overall sequence deviates more significantly from the other GAPs prompted us to study the biochemical characteristics of this protein. We found that short N-terminal or C-terminal deletions inactivate Gyp6p and that Gyp6p accelerates the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ypt6p >106-fold and most probably uses a catalytic arginine, which is in the corresponding position of the critical arginine identified in Gyp1p and Gyp7p (6Albert S.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5105-5113Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). All cloning procedures were performed using standard protocols (13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For construction of the yeast expression vector pEG(KT)-GYP6, the plasmid pGEX-GYP6 (bearing a BamHI restriction site 5′ adjacent to the ATG start codon and anEcoRI site directly following the TAA translational stop codon of GYP6) was digested with EcoRI, treated with the Klenow fragment, and cleaved with BamHI. The isolated GYP6-containing fragment was ligated into theBamHI- and XbaI-cleaved vector pEG(KT) (14Mitchell D.A. Marshall T.K. Deschenes R.J. Yeast. 1993; 9: 715-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) after filling in the overhanging ends of the XbaI cleavage site with the Klenow enzyme. The C-terminal deletions of Gyp6p were generated by inserting the following GYP6sequence-containing fragments into pEG(KT) that are derived from pGEX-GYP6: BamHI-AccI (for Gyp6(1–277)p),BamHI-SphI (for Gyp6(1–323)p), andBamHI-EcoNI (for Gyp6(1–382)p). For N-terminal deletions, a HindIII-EcoRI fragment (for Gyp6(45–458)p), a BspMI-EcoRI fragment (for Gyp6(182–458)p), or a BglII-EcoRI fragment (for Gyp6(209–458)p) was isolated from pGEX-GYP6, and aBanI-XbaI fragment (for Gyp6(72–458)p) was isolated from pRS326-GYP6 (3Strom M. Vollmer P. Tan T.J. Gallwitz D. Nature. 1993; 361: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The fragments were blunt-end inserted into pEG(KT) in frame with the GST-encoding sequence. Proper expression of the truncated GST-Gyp6 fusion proteins was verified by Western blot analysis using anti-GST antisera (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Ypt6p was produced in Escherichia coli using the pET vector system (Novagen) and purified as described previously (15Wagner P. Hengst L. Gallwitz D. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 219: 369-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). GST-Gyp6 fusion proteins were produced in the yeast strain BJ5459 (MATa ura3–52 trp1 lys2–801 leu2Δ1 his3Δ200 pep4::HIS3 prb1Δ1.6R can1 GAL) (Yeast Genetic Stock Center, University of California at Berkeley) and purified as described previously for the preparations of GST-Gyp7p (8Vollmer P. Will E. Scheglmann D. Strom M. Gallwitz D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 284-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To get active protein, buffers used had to be free of CHAPS. Yeast cell lysis was done in buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 1 mmPefabloc and 1× complete proteinase inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), column washes in 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1 m KCl. GST-Gyp6p was eluted from glutathione-Sepharose at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm reduced glutathione, pH 7.5. Concentration and purity of the GST fusion proteins were determined as described previously (6Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). GAP activity in crude yeast cell extracts was determined using the filter assay and [γ32P]GTP-loaded Ypt6p (4Vollmer P. Gallwitz D. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 118-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The high pressure liquid chromatography-based quantitative GAP assay used for analysis of purified proteins and the evaluation of the Gyp6p/Ypt6p interaction using the integrated Michaelis-Menten equation were performed as described recently in detail (6Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 16Will E. Albert S. Gallwitz D. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 329: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The generation of pAS2-YPT6, pAS1-YPT6(Q69L), and pACTII-GYP6 has been described previously (17Tsukada M. Will E. Gallwitz D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The fusion of the Gal4 DNA binding domain (Gal4-BD) with Ypt6(G20S)p was performed by the insertion of an NcoI/BglII fragment from pACTII-YPT6(G20S) intoNcoI/BamHI-cleaved pAS2, and the codon exchange was verified by sequence analysis. Truncated Gyp6 proteins were fused to the Gal4 transcription activation domain in the two-hybrid vector pACTII. Proper expression of the “bait” and “prey” plasmids in the yeast reporter strain Y190 (18Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarski K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5201) Google Scholar) was controlled by Western blot analysis using hemagglutinin monoclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Double transformants expressing both bait and prey hybrid proteins were analyzed for β-galactosidase activity by the X-gal filter assay as described previously (19Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1992; 68: 597-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Quantification of the β-galactosidase activity in liquid cultures using o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactosidase was performed as described by Guarente (20Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar) and evaluated according to Miller (21Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar), units = A 420 / (t × V × A 600) where t is the reaction time (in min) at 30 °C, andV is the volume (in ml) of the yeast culture used in the assay. Substitution of arginine to alanine or lysine codons in GYP6 was achieved by a PCR-based overlap extension method (22Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Paese L.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar) using the following oligonucleotides as primers (mutated codons are underlined): R39A, 5′-CTTTAAAGAAAATAGTGCCGGCTGGCTCTGGAA-3′ and 5′-TTCCAGAGCCAGCCGGCACTATTTTCTTTAAAG-3′; R155A, 5′-AGATTTGGACCTCTCGGCCATAATGCTTGACGAT-3′ and 5′-ATCGTCAAGCATTATGGCCGAGAGGTCCAAATCT-3′; R155K, 5′-GGACCTCTCAAAGATAATGCTTGACG-3′ and 5′-CGTCAAGCATTATCTTTGAGAGGTCC-3′; R290A, 5′-AATCTGGCTCATCGCCTGGACAAGGTTGTT-3′ and 5′-AACAACCTTGTCCAGGCGATGAGCCAGATT-3′; R298A, 5′-GGACAAGGTTGTTATTTTTGGCCGAATTACCCTTAAAAT-3′ and 5′-ATTTTAAGGGTAATTCGGCCAAAAATAACAACCTTGTCC-3′. We had previously shown that bacterial expression of full-length Gyp6 protein allowed us to identify its activity as a Ypt/Rab-specific GAP (3Strom M. Vollmer P. Tan T.J. Gallwitz D. Nature. 1993; 361: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), but large scale production of the protein in E. coli failed. Likewise, we were unable to produce a GST-Gyp6 fusion protein in E. coliin reasonable quantity. Therefore, we expressed the GST-Gyp6p fusion in a proteinase-deficient yeast strain under control of the strong galactose-inducible GAL10 promoter. As thrombin cleavage of the affinity-purified fusion protein resulted in a significant loss of GAP activity, the biochemical analyses were performed with GST-Gyp6p fusions that were >80% pure. GAP activity was determined with varying amounts of the fusion protein and a 10–100-fold excess (20 μm) of GTP-bound Ypt6p. From the initial rates of GTP hydrolysis determined by high pressure liquid chromatography-based quantification of GTP and GDP, a specific activity of 72.2 (± 4.8) units/nmol GST-Gyp6p was calculated where one unit of GAP was defined as the hydrolysis of 1 nmol of Ypt6p-bound GTP in 1 min at 30 °C. This value compares well with specific activities that we recently determined for two other yeast Ypt/Rab GAPs (6Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). For further characterization of the Gyp6p-Ypt6p interaction, theK m and k cat values were determined from single time curves using the integrated Michaelis-Menten equation (23Duggleby R.G. Clarke R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1080: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) as described for the analysis of the catalytic properties of Gyp1p, Gyp7p, and Gyp3p (6Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 9Albert S. Gallwitz D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33186-33189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In a representative experiment using 100 nm GST-Gyp6p and an initial substrate concentration of 200 μm Ypt6p-GTP, we determined K m = 592 μm andk cat = 18.8 s−1 for GST-Gyp6p. Given the slow intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate of Ypt6p (0.0002 min−1), this means a maximal acceleration of 5.6 × 106-fold. Thus, compared with the catalytic properties of other GAPs for Ypt-GTPases, Gyp6p seems to bind its substrate with very low affinity but causes the highest maximal acceleration of GTP hydrolysis measured so far for a Ypt/Rab-GAP (Table I).Table ICatalytic properties of Ypt-specific GTPase activating proteinsGAPGTPaseK mkcatActivationReferenceμms−1-foldGyp1–46Ypt51p1433.94.5 × 104(6Albert S.

Within the GYP family of yeast Ypt/Rab-GAPs, Gyp6p is an exception in that it lacks a larger N-terminal sequence segment preceding the GYP domain (Fig. 1). The GYP domain of the Ypt6-GAP with its six elements A–F, related in primary sequence among all GYP family members (5Neuwald A.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 243-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 12Rak A. Fedorov R. Alexandrov K. Albert S. Goody R.S. Gallwitz D. Scheidig A.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5105-5113Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), shares with that of Gyp1p and Gyp7p four arginine residues in equivalent positions. Two of these residues, Arg-39 and Arg-155, of Gyp6p are strictly conserved in all known Ypt/Rab-GAPs of the GYP family. We have shown by mutational analysis that the conserved arginine in sequence segment B of the GYP domain (Fig. 1) is required for the catalytic activity of Gyp1p and Gyp7p (6Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We generated GST-Gyp6 fusion proteins with alanine substitutions for the four arginines in position 39 (motif A), 155 (motif B), and 290 and 298 (motif F) in addition to a mutant GAP with the conservative R155K exchange. From kinetic analyses under standard conditions (Fig.2), we observed that all substitutions led to significant inhibition of Gyp6p GAP activity (TableII). Importantly, both the R155K and the R155A substitution resulted in an apparently complete inactivation of the Gyp6 mutant proteins.Figure 2Effect of arginine substitutions on the catalytic activity of Gyp6p. 1 μm of either wild-type (wt) or mutant Gyp6p fused to GST was incubated with 20 μm GTP-loaded Ypt6p at 30 °C. At the time points indicated, aliquots of the incubation mixtures were shock frozen, and GTP and GDP concentrations were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography analysis. Note that R155A and R155K substitutions only led to an apparent complete loss of Gyp6p catalytic activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IIActivity of GST-Gyp6 proteins with arginine substitutionsGST-Gyp6pGTP hydrolysis rate2-aGTP hydrolysis rates were determined at 30 °C with 20 μm GTP-loaded Ypt6p and 1 μm GST-Gyp6 wild type or mutant proteins.Accelerationmin−1-fold–0.0002–Wild type3.3316,650R39A0.039195R155A<0.00020R155K<0.00020R290A0.003518R298A0.0442202-a GTP hydrolysis rates were determined at 30 °C with 20 μm GTP-loaded Ypt6p and 1 μm GST-Gyp6 wild type or mutant proteins. Open table in a new tab Because we were unable to achieve GST-Gyp6p concentrations high enough to measure the K m and k catvalues for the two mutant proteins, a distinction between an impairment of catalysis and that of substrate affinity was attempted using the two-hybrid system. To test for substrate protein binding, Gyp6p and Ypt6p were fused to the Gal4 transcription activation domain and Gal4-BD, respectively, and protein-protein interactions were identified by monitoring β-galactosidase activity in a reporter yeast strain transformed with both expression plasmids. Expression of wild-type and mutant proteins was verified by Western blotting analysis using appropriate antibodies. Although GAP/GTPase interactions must be extremely short-lived because of the fast GTP hydrolysis reaction, Gyp6p-interaction with its substrate GTPase Ypt6p could be demonstrated (Table III). We also observed a weaker interaction of the GAP with Ypt6p mutated in the P-loop (G20S substitution), and as expected, a considerable enhancement of GAP interaction with Ypt6(Q69L)p, a mutant GTPase that like other Ras superfamily members with the same substitution in the equivalent position, has a significantly reduced intrinsic GTPase activity (Fig.4 A). When the catalytically inactive Gyp6(R155A) mutant GAP was analyzed with respect to its binding to wild-type and mutant Ypt6 GTPases, we found that the GAP/GTPase interactions were significantly stronger than they were with the wild-type Gyp6 protein. This was especially apparent with the P-loop mutant Ypt6(G20S)p (Table III). From this study, it follows that substitutions of Arg-155 in Gyp6p affect the catalytic activity of GAP rather than its substrate binding.Table IIIInteraction of Gyp6p and Ypt6p in the two-hybrid system“Bait” plasmid“Prey” plasmidβ-Galactosidase activity3-aThe β-galactosidase activity produced in double transformants grown in liquid cultures was quantified usingo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactosidase as substrate.

Three single colonies were tested for each interaction. Open table in a new tab Because the large N-terminal segments preceding the GYP domain in Gyp1p and Gyp7p could be deleted without reduction of the catalytic activity (6Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), we addressed the question of whether Gyp6p contained N-terminal or C-terminal sequences dispensable for catalytic activity or substrate GTPase binding. Successive N-terminal and C-terminal deletions were created using available restriction enzyme cutting sites of theGYP6 protein-coding region. GST fusions of the truncated Gyp6 proteins were expressed in yeast (Fig.3), and their apparent GAP activity was assessed in cellular extracts with [γ-32P]GTP-loaded Ypt6p using a filter assay. Whereas cell extracts containing full-length GST-Gyp6p generally resulted in the hydrolysis of >80% Ypt6p-bound GTP within 10 min at 30 °C, extracts containing truncated GST-Gyp6 fusion proteins exhibited only background activity in at least three independent experiments. This finding shows that GAP activity of Gyp6p is already lost or significantly reduced in mutant proteins lacking either the N-terminal 44 amino acid residues (including most of the segment A sequence of the GYP domain) or the C-terminal 76 residues (still leaving intact a block of 72 amino acids distal of the GYP domain) (see Fig. 1). Substrate binding of Gyp6p truncation mutants was assessed by two-hybrid analyses to determine whether the lack of GAP activity was the result of an impaired physical GAP/GTPase interaction. Truncated Gyp6 proteins fused to Gal4 transcription activation domain were coexpressed with Gal4-BD-Ypt6p or Gal4-BD-Ypt6(Q69L)p, expression was confirmed by Western blotting analysis, and the interaction was analyzed using the X-gal filter test (Fig.4 B). The expression level of the truncated GAPs was comparable to that of full-length Gyp6p (data not shown). Very weak interaction of Ypt6(Q69L)p but not wild-type Ypt6p was detected with Gyp6(45–458)p. No interaction was observed with two larger N-terminal deletions or with the C-terminal truncation mutant Gyp6(1–325)p, which lacked most of the sequences distal of the GYP domain (Fig. 1). These results suggest that the GYP domain as well as sequences C-terminal of the GYP domain contribute to efficient substrate binding. Our recent studies have shown that the deletion of extended regions, which are located N-terminal of the catalytic domain of most GYP family members, does not inhibit GAP activity nor does it affect substrate specificity (6Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). 3S. Albert, A. DeAntoni, and D. Gallwitz, unpublished observations.In Gyp1p and Gyp7p, this GAP-dispensable region amounts to 39 and 48%, respectively, of the total length of the protein.

Biochem. 1999; 260: 284-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and other Ypt-GAP null mutants are phenotypically inconspicuous in complete growth media, it is not an easy task to elucidate the function(s) of the N-terminal domains in vivo. We have argued (6Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) that because of the low affinity of Ypt/Rab-GAPs to their substrate GTPases, high concentrations of the GAPs would be required at those membranes where they are likely to act and that the N-terminal extensions of the GAPs might be required for their recruitment to specific cellular locations. If this were the case, Gyp6p without a fragment of appreciable length preceding the GYP domain would need to employ other part(s) of the molecule for localization purposes. All of the N-terminal and C-terminal truncations of Gyp6p we have described here significantly inhibited or even abolished GAP activity. The shortest of the truncations, Gyp6(45–458)p and Gyp6(1–382)p, are of special interest. The deletion of the N-terminal 44 amino acids included most of the 15 amino acid-long sequence motif A with Arg-39 and Trp-43, two residues strictly conserved in all GYP family members (Fig. 1). This mutant not only lost GAP activity but also its ability to bind its substrate GTPase Ypt6p as shown by two-hybrid analysis. The latter finding strengthens the argument, derived from our recently solved x-ray structure of the Gyp1p catalytic domain, that the conserved arginine and tryptophan residues in motif A contribute to the stabilization of the tertiary structure of the GAP domain and presumably to the formation of the GTPase-binding epitope (12Rak A. Fedorov R. Alexandrov K. Albert S. Goody R.S. Gallwitz D. Scheidig A.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5105-5113Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The C-terminal truncation mutants of Gyp1p and Gyp7p, which we previously studied and found to be catalytically inactive, terminated only 31 and 17 amino acids, respectively, distal of the motif F of the GYP domain. But in this study, we had not addressed the question of whether the truncated GAPs were still able to bind their substrate proteins. The work with Gyp6p now shows that a segment of 13 amino acid residues C-terminal of the GYP domain (truncation mutant Gyp6(1–323)p) is not sufficient to allow binding to the substrate GTPase. Even Gyp6(1–382)p with 72 amino acids following the GYP domain was inactive most probably because of its deficiency for substrate binding. The crystal structure of Gyp1p and the proposed Gyp1p·Ypt51p complex (12Rak A. Fedorov R. Alexandrov K. Albert S. Goody R.S. Gallwitz D. Scheidig A.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5105-5113Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) suggests that at least one α-helical region located approximately 100 amino acid residues C-terminal of the GYP domain could contribute to GTPase binding. The C-terminal region distal of the GYP domain of different GYP family members is at least 150 amino acid residues long, but the primary sequences are quite divergent. This work clearly indicates that a significant part of this region is required for the overall architecture of an active GAP and for the binding of the substrate GTPases. Apart from its exceptional N terminus among the GYP family members, Gyp6p, which for technical reasons had to be analyzed as a GST fusion protein, shares similar biochemical properties with other Ypt/Rab-specific GAPs studied. It accelerates the low intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate very potently but displays very low affinity (Km > 500 μm) for its preferred substrate Ypt6p. In fact, with a 5 × 106-fold acceleration of the basic GTPase activity of Ypt6p, Gyp6p is the most potent of the Ypt/Rab-GAPs that we have analyzed so far. Although the substitution with alanine of four arginine residues within the shared sequence motifs of the GYP domain led to a significant loss of Gyp6p GAP activity, only the strictly conserved arginine in position 155 proved to be essential for GAP activity. Importantly, as we could demonstrate for Gyp6(R155A) in a two-hybrid analysis, substitutions of Arg-155 do not interfere with GAP/GTPase interaction. This finding is further evidence for the suggestion, based on our mutational (6Albert S. Will E. Gallwitz D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5216-5225Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 9Albert S.

Wolfenden R. Science. 1995; 267: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar and Fig. 1). The remarkable catalytic power of this enzyme is entirely dependent on non-covalent binding forces and does not involve metals or other cofactors (2Acheson S.A. Bell J.B. Jones M.E. Wolfenden R.

In an attempt to gain insight into its mechanism of action, the crystal structures of ODCase complexed with three different ligands were recently determined (4Miller B.G. Hassell A.M. Wolfenden R.

In each of these structures, a unique arrangement of alternating, charged residues composed of Lys-Asp-Lys-Asp is positioned near the bound pyrimidine ring of the ligand. These four residues, Lys-59, Asp-91, Lys-93, and Asp-96 of the yeast enzyme (see Fig. 2), are completely conserved in all known ODCase sequences (8Traut T.W. Temple B. J. Biol.

According to the theory of absolute reaction rates, a large value ofkcat/Km (for ODCase = 6.3 × 107m−1sec−1) requires that the altered substrate be very tightly bound in the transition state Ktx < 10−23m (1Radzicka A. Wolfenden R. Science. 1995; 267: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Moreover, a large value ofkcat (for ODCase = 44 s−1) requires that the substrate be much less tightly bound in the ground state (1Radzicka A. Wolfenden R. Science. 1995; 267: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar), as was recently established (Km =Ks = 7 × 10−7m) (11Miller B.G. Snider M.J. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8113-8118Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 13Porter D.J.T. Short S.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11788-11800Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). From a structural standpoint, it would be desirable to understand how these very different affinities are achieved. Based on computer simulations, it has been proposed (5Wu N. Mo Y. Gao J. Pai E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2017-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 6Appleby T.C. Kinsland C. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) that Asp-91 (yeast numbering system) may assist decarboxylation by a mechanism involving electrostatic destabilization of the substrate in the ground state. However, the likelihood of that mechanism of destabilization has been questioned (10Warshel A. Strajbl M. Villa J. Florian J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14728-14738Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Lys-93 has been shown to be important for enzyme activity (9Smiley J.A. Jones M.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12162-12168Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), possibly by stabilizing the carbanion produced by CO2 elimination and furnishing the proton that appears at C-6 of the product UMP (Fig.1). The second acidic member of the charged quartet, Asp-96, is contributed by the opposite subunit of the ODCase dimer (4Miller B.G. Hassell A.M. Wolfenden R. Milburn M.V. Short S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2011-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 5Wu N. Mo Y. Gao J. Pai E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4217-4224Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and is drawn into the active site by ligand binding. The final member of the quartet, Lys-59, appears to contact the 3′-hydroxyl group of the bound substrate (5Wu N. Mo Y. Gao J. Pai E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2017-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 6Appleby T.C. Kinsland C. Begley T.P. Ealick S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To assess the contribution of each of these four residues to ground state and transition state stabilization, we have replaced each one with alanine. We also substituted alanine for Gln-215, a residue that appears to be within hydrogen-bonding distance (2.6 Å) of the C-2 oxygen of the BMP pyrimidine ring, possibly aiding delocalization of negative charge in the transition state for decarboxylation (4Miller B.G. Hassell A.M. Wolfenden R. Milburn M.V. Short S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2011-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Here we show that removal of any member of the charged network drastically reduces activity. In contrast, mutagenesis of Gln-215 reveals that this residue contributes very little to transition state stabilization. Mutant recombinant ura3 genes encoding K59A, D91A, K93A, D96A, and Q215A enzymes were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using Quick-Change reagents (Stratagene, Inc.) and mutagenic oligonucleotide pairs (Oligos, Etc.). Wild-type and mutant enzymes were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli SS6130 (cytR, Δcdd) as previously described (11Miller B.G. Snider M.J. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8113-8118Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Analysis of each mutant protein, either intact or as protease-generated peptides, by electrospray mass spectrometry demonstrated the correct alanyl substitution at positions 59, 91, 93, 96, and 215. Enzymatic decarboxylation of OMP was measured in MOPS buffer (2.0 × 10−2m, pH 7.2) by observing the decrease in absorbance at either 285 or 295 nm where ΔεM = −1743 and −819 cm−1, respectively. An alternative assay (12Jones M.E. Kavipurapa P.R. Traut T.W. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 51: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), monitoring the evolution of14CO2 from radiolabeled OMP, was used to estimate values of Km for wild-type and Q215A enzymes. Concentrations of wild-type and mutant enzymes were estimated from absorbance readings at 280 nm, using a molar extinction coefficient of 28,830 cm−1. Ligand binding affinities were determined by comparing rates of decarboxylation in the presence and absence of varying concentrations of each competitive inhibitor. Isothermal titration calorimetry was performed on a Microcal, Inc. MSC calorimeter equilibrated at 25 °C with a final enzyme concentration of 10−4m. Circular dichroism spectra were obtained at 25 °C using an Applied Photophysicsπ* 180 spectrophotometer following dilution of each enzyme into potassium phosphate buffer (10−2m, pH 7.2). The crystal structure of yeast ODCase complexed with BMP suggested the possibility of a hydrogen bond between Gln-215 and O2 of the pyrimidine ring (see Ref. 4Miller B.G. Hassell A.M. Wolfenden R. Milburn M.V. Short S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2011-2016Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar and Fig.2). However, the data in Tables I andII show that replacement of Gln-215 with alanine scarcely affects either catalysis or ligand binding. This result is surprising considering the closeness of the Gln-215 side chain to O2 of the pyrimidine ring and indicates that any interactions between this residue and the pyrimidine ring are dispensable for efficient decarboxylation. Aside from contacts with the 6-substituent, the only remaining contact between the enzyme and the pyrimidine ring is formed between O-4 of the pyrimidine ring and the peptide bond amide group of Ser-154 (4Miller B.G.

Table III compares the activity of wild-type yeast ODCase with the activities of the K59A, D91A, K93A, and D96A mutant enzymes. In these assays, which contained substrate at a concentration 350-fold greater than the Km value for wild-type ODCase (2.5 × 10−4m), no detectable activity was observed for the D91A, K93A, or D96A mutant enzymes, even at an enzyme concentration up to 2.0 × 10−4m in subunits. These experiments indicated that the activity of each mutant enzyme had decreased by more than 5 orders of magnitude compared with the wild-type enzyme (TableIII). The loss of activity resulting from mutagenesis of Asp-91, Lys-93, and Asp-96 does not appear to be a consequence of gross changes in enzyme structure, as indicated by comparison of the CD spectra of mutant and wild-type enzymes.Table IIISpecific activities of purified wild-type and mutant yeast ODCase enzymes determined at a substrate concentration of 2.5 × 10−4mEnzymeSpecific activity (μmol min−1 mg−1)Wild-type90Q215A84K59A0.19D91A≤0.00066K93A≤0.00018D96A≤0.00047 Open table in a new tab In view of the negligible levels of enzyme activity observed for these mutant enzymes, it was of interest to determine whether they were capable of binding OMP. For the D91A and K93A mutant proteins, OMP binding could not be detected by isothermal titration calorimetry. In the case of the D96A protein, isothermal titration calorimetry yielded a value of 8.0 × 10−6m for the binding affinity of OMP (Table I). This value is similar to theKm value of the wild-type enzyme for 2′-deoxyorotidine 5′-phosphate determined in a separate study. 2Miller, B. G., Butterfoss, G. L., Short, S. A., and Wolfenden, R. (2001) Biochemistry, in press. Earlier work has shown that, for the wild-type enzyme, Kmrepresents the dissociation constant of the enzyme-substrate complex (11Miller B.G. Snider M.J. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8113-8118Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 13Porter D.J.T. Short S.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11788-11800Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The ability of the D96A protein to bind ligand, in contrast to the results obtained for the D91A and K93A proteins, is of interest in view of the fact that Asp-96 is contributed to the active site by the opposite subunit of dimeric ODCase upon ligand binding. Based on the activity limit and substrate binding affinity of the D96A protein, the apparent kcat/Km value for this mutant enzyme was reduced by more than 6 orders of magnitude. The absence of detectable substrate binding by the D91A and K93A mutant enzymes precludes the assessment of the effects of these substitutions upon the stability of the ES complex. However, the lack of activity of the D91A, K93A, and D96A mutant enzymes indicates that each of these charged residues play a critical role in transition state stabilization. The crystal structures of all ODCase-ligand complexes suggest the presence of a hydrogen bond between the ε-amino group of Lys-59 and the 3′-OH group of the ligand (4Miller B.G. Hassell A.M.

Whereas removal of the side-chains of Asp-91, Lys-93, and Asp-96 completely destroyed activity, the enzyme retained measurable activity after mutagenesis of Lys-59. Table I shows that the kcat value for the K59A mutant enzyme was reduced 100-fold whereasKm was elevated 1000-fold compared with these parameters for the wild-type enzyme. Table IV reveals a striking disparity between the magnitude of the effect of the Lys-59 → Ala substitution on the binding affinities of the substrate in the ground state and the altered substrate in the transition state. As the reaction progresses from the ground state ES complex to the transition state, the effect of the K59A mutation increases from 910-fold to 1.2 × 105-fold. Upon formation of product UMP, the magnitude of this effect collapses to less than 2-fold. These findings are consistent with the view that the active site of this enzyme is organized to maximize the influence of multiple binding interactions in the transition state, while minimizing such effects in the ground state and product complexes. The differential effect of the Lys-59 → Ala substitution upon ligand binding is comparable with, but somewhat exceeds, the effect of removing the 2′-OH group of the ligand, consistent with the view that interactions between enzyme and ribosyl OH groups are important for transition state stabilization.Table IVRelative contribution of Lys-59-ribofuranosyl interactions to substrate, inhibitor, and transition state binding affinityLigandKi(K59A)/Ki (wild-type)UMP1.7OMP9104-aRatio of Km values.6-AzaUMP1100XMP1800BMP11,000Transition state120,0004-bRatio of Ktx values.4-a Ratio of Km values.4-b Ratio of Ktx values. Open table in a new tab To the extent that enzymatic decarboxylation depends on ground state destabilization, one would expect that any enzyme mutation that reduces this destabilization would tend to both reducekcat and increase the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate in the ground state. In fact, both the K59A and D96A mutant enzymes show reduced values of kcat and reduced affinities for the substrate in the ground state. Similarly, both the D91A and K93A mutants were inactive, and isothermal titration calorimetry experiments ruled out the possibility of an increased affinity for the substrate. To enhance the rate of any reaction over the rate of reaction that is observed in water, an enzyme binds the altered substrate in the transition state more tightly than it binds the substrate in the ground state ES complex (14Wolfenden R. Nature. 1969; 223: 704-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). This difference in affinities may be achieved, at least in part, by the introduction of a local strain in the ES complex that is relieved as the ES complex proceeds toward the transition state. 3It is worth noting that the introduction of ground state destabilization elevates kcat andKm to the same extent, without enhancingkcat/Km. Most enzymes operate with the substrate at sub-saturating concentrations (15Cleland W.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1967; 36: 77-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), and the introduction of ground state destabilization does not enhance the rate of reaction under these conditions. In the case of ODCase, it has been suggested that repulsive interactions between Asp-91 and the carboxylate group of OMP may produce ground state destabilization by electrostatic interactions, which are relieved in the transition state as CO2 is eliminated (5Wu N. Mo Y. Gao J. Pai E.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2017-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). If this enzyme acted by such a mechanism, with ground state repulsion present in the ES complex with UMP, one might expect significantly tighter binding of product OMP in which such repulsion would be absent. In fact, the affinity of the enzyme for product UMP (Ki = 2.0 × 10−7m) is greatly exceeded by its affinity for the substrate OMP, whoseKm value (7 × 10−7m) has been shown to be a true dissociation constant (11Miller B.G. Snider M.J. Short S.A. Wolfenden R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8113-8118Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 13Porter D.J.T. Short S.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11788-11800Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These affinities, combined with the present effects of active site modification, seem to indicate unequivocally that the active site binds the substrate strongly in the ground state and that their mutual affinity increases greatly as the enzyme-substrate complex progresses toward the transition state.

To assess the tolerance of motif A for amino acid substitutions, we determined the mutability of the 13 constituent amino acids Val700–Arg712 by using random mutagenesis and genetic selection. We observed that every residue except the catalytically essential Asp705 can be mutated while allowing bacterial growth and preserving wild-type DNA polymerase activity. Hence, the primary structure of motif A is plastic. We present evidence that mutability of motif A has been conserved during evolution, supporting the premise that the tolerance for mutation is adaptive. In addition, our work allows identification of refinements in catalytic function that may contribute to preservation of the wild-type motif A sequence.

DNA polymerase I T. aquaticus dithiothreitol exonuclease-minus polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (pol I)1 is a multifunctional enzyme with roles in DNA replication, DNA repair, and genetic recombination (1Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar). The first recognized and most thoroughly investigated of all DNA polymerases, it is key to our understanding of how DNA polymerases function as protein catalysts and as central enzymes in DNA metabolism. It belongs to one of six families of DNA polymerases, defined on the basis of amino acid sequence comparisons (2Delarue M. Poch O. Tordo N. Moras D. Argos P.

Crystal structures of representative enzymes from the first four families have been determined, revealing a common overall architecture that has been likened to a human right hand, with fingers, thumb, and palm subdomains (5Ollis D.L. Brick P. Hamlin R. Xuong N.G. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1985; 313: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 6Kohlstaedt L.A. Wang J. Friedman J.M. Rice P.A. Steitz T.A.

Although the structures of the fingers and thumb subdomains vary considerably, the catalytic palm subdomains are all superimposable (10Kunkel T.A. Wilson S.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 11Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 497-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). The palm subdomain includes two conserved sequences, motif A and motif C, each harboring a catalytically essential aspartic acid residue. Essential roles of motif A in catalysis include interaction with the incoming dNTP and coordination with two divalent metal ions that are required for the polymerization reaction (12Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 13Doublié S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T.

Motif A begins at an anti-parallel β-strand containing predominantly hydrophobic residues and is followed by a turn and an α-helix. Although there is considerable variation in the amino acid sequence of the anti-parallel β-strand, the sequence of the turn and helix, DYSQIELR, is nearly invariant among known prokaryotic family A polymerases (16Astatke M. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). 2Patel, P. H., Suzuki, M., Adman, E., Shinkai, A., and Loeb, L. A. (2001) J. Mol. Biol., in press. In a recent study of Taq pol I, we observed substantial mutability of motif A (17Patel P.H. Loeb L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5095-5100Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This plasticity was surprising when one considers the essentiality of DNA polymerases and the marked conservation of motif A within prokaryotic DNA polymerases. To determine whether or not the plasticity within motif A was a property of DNA polymerases, we examined the mutability of motif A in E. coli pol I. We found that E. coli pol I also tolerated multiple substitution within motif A. Moreover, the overall pattern and the type of substitutions were similar to those of Taq pol I. Our results indicate that the mutability of motif A has been conserved in natural evolution and support the premise that toleration of mutation may be an important feature for the overall fitness of DNA polymerase active sites. The pol I gene (polA) of E. coli DH5α was amplified by colony polymerase chain reaction with 5′-ATATATATAAGCTTATGGTTCAGATCCCCCAAAATCCACTTATC-3′ and 5′-ATATATATGAATTCTTAGTGCGCCTGATCCCAGTTTTCGCCACT-3′ as primers. The 3-kilobase pair amplified fragment was digested withHindIII and EcoRI and then cloned under the lactose promoter into pHSG576, a low copy number plasmid that has a pol I-independent origin (18Takeshita S. Sato M. Toba M. Masahashi W. Hashimoto-Gotoh T. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 61: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), to create pECpol I. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on pECpol I to introduce silent mutations C to A at position 2,067 and G to C at position 2,214 of thepolA gene (19Joyce C.M. Kelley W.S. Grindley N.D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1958-1964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to create AccI and EagI sites, respectively, that flank the sequence encoding motif A. The resulting plasmid was named pECpol IS. To avoid contamination with incompletely cut vectors when preparing the random library, a nonfunctional stuffer vector, pECpoldum, was constructed by replacing the AccI-EagI 130-base pair fragment ofpolA with an oligonucleotide fragment (5′-ATACGATCGATCTGCAGCGATCC-3′ and 5′-GGCCGGATCGCTGCAGATCGATCGT-3′). The pol I random library was constructed by annealing two single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides containing segments with random sequences: Oligo 1 was a 104-mer corresponding to the sense nucleotides 2,053–2,156, and containing an AccI site for cloning (5′-GAAGGTCGTCGTATACGCCAGGCGTTTATTGCGCCAGAGGATTAT[GTGATTGTCTCAGCGGACTACTCGCAGATTGAACTGCGC]ATTATGGCGCATCTTTCGCG-3′); Oligo 2 was an 89-mer corresponding to antisense strand nucleotides 2,225–2,137 and containing an EagI site (5′-AACACTTCTGCGGCCGTTGCCCGGTGGATATCTTTTCCTTCCGCGAATGCGGTCAGCAAGCCTTTGTCACGCGAAAGATGCGCCATAAT-3′). The bracketed nucleotides in Oligo 1 were synthesized to contain 88% wild-type nucleotide and 4% each of the other three nucleotides at every position. The 20-base pair complementary regions of hybridization are underlined. Oligo 1 and Oligo 2 were annealed at their nonrandom complementary regions by mixing 250 pmol of each in 20 μl of H2O and heating to 95 °C for 5 min, followed by cooling for 2 h to room temperature. The partially duplex oligonucleotide was extended by incubation with 50 units of E. coli pol I Klenow fragment (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA) for 2 h at 37 °C in a 0.3-ml reaction mixture containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 7.5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm of all four dNTPs. The resulting DNA was digested with AccI and EagI, purified, and inserted into pECpoldum in place of the stuffer fragment. Plasmids containing the random library were transformed into E. coli XLIBlue, and the number of transformed cells was determined by plating an aliquot onto LB agar plates containing 30 μg/ml of chloramphenicol. The remainder of the library was amplified by growing the transformed E. coli XLIBlue in 3 liters of 2× YT medium for 16 h at 37 °C, and the random library, pECpolLib, was then purified. E. coliJS200 (recA718polA12) (20Sweasy J.B. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1407-1410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Witkin E.M. Boegner-Maniscalco V. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4166-4168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was transformed with plasmids pHSG576, pECpol IS, pECpoldum, and pECpolLib. Thereafter, 1 ml of nutrient broth containing 0.4% NaCl was added, and the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. A small fraction of the mixture was then plated in duplicate onto nutrient agar plates containing 0.4% NaCl, 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline, and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol; one plate was incubated at 30 °C, and the other was incubated at 37 °C overnight, and the resulting colonies were counted. Only paired samples containing less than 1,500 colonies at 30 °C were analyzed because dense plating of the cells leads to elevated background at 37 °C. Plasmids carrying the mutant pol I gene were prepared, and the 0.6-kilobase pair region covering the motif A region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with 5′-GATACCATGCTGGAGTCCTACATTC-3′ and 5′-ACGGCGTTGCTCGCTGGTGACGGTT-3′ as primers. Following purification of the polymerase chain reaction product, theAccI-EagI 130-base pair fragment was sequenced by using 5′-TTATCGTCAACCGATCCTAACCTGCA-3′ as a primer. Recombinant E. coli JS200 cells were cultured at 30 °C in 4 ml of 2× YT medium supplemented with 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol. At the exponential growth phase (A 600 = 0.2–0.5), pol I expression was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After further incubation for 4 h (A 600 = 2), cells from 1.5 ml of culture were collected, washed with 1 ml of 20 mmsodium phosphate (pH 7.2), suspended in 0.1 ml of the same buffer, and 5 μl of 10 mg/ml lysozyme was added. The cells were disrupted by freezing at −80 °C for 16 h and thawing on ice for 2 h. The cell extract was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. DNA polymerase activity was measured at 42 °C for 10 min in 20-μl reaction mixtures containing 0.1 μg of gapped calf thymus DNA (22Spanos A. Sedgwick S.G. Yarranton G.T. Hübscher U. Banks G.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 1825-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), 12.5 μm each dNTP, 50 nm [α-32P]dTTP (3,000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 2 μl of cell extract in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 7.5 mm DTT. The reaction was terminated by addition of 0.5 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid followed by 0.1 ml of 0.1 msodium pyrophosphate. The 32P-labeled DNA was collected onto glass fiber filters, and radioactivity was measured by using scintillation counter as described (23Battula N. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4086-4093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay for RNA polymerase activity was the same, except 12.5 μm rGTP was substituted for dGTP. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on pECpol IS to introduce an A to C transversion at position 1,271, changing the corresponding Asp424 to Ala and inactivating the 3′-exonuclease activity (24Derbyshire V. Freemont P.S. Sanderson M.R. Beese L. Friedman J.M. Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Science. 1988; 240: 199-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Then, with this plasmid as a template and 5′-CAGACGAACATATGCACCATCATCACCATCACATTTCTTATGACAACTACGTCACCATCCTTGAT -3′ and 5′-ATATATATGAATTCTTAGTGCGCCTGATCCCAGTTTTCGCCACT-3′ as primers, polymerase chain reaction was performed to construct the HisKlenow(exo−) gene. The amplified fragment was digested with NdeI and EcoRI and cloned under the λP L promoter of pLEX (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). High expression vectors for mutant pol I proteins were constructed by substituting the 1.1-kilobase pair SacI-EcoRI fragment of the wild-type pol I gene on the expression vector with the corresponding fragment of the mutant gene. Recombinant HisKlenow(exo−) proteins were expressed and purified by using the P LExpression System (Invitrogen), and His-Bond kits (Novagen, Madison, WI), respectively, essentially according to the manufacturer's directions. The expression plasmid was introduced into E. coli GI724 (F−, λ−,lacIq, lacPL8,ampC::P trp cI,mcrA, mcrB, INV(rnnD-rnnE)), and cells were grown at 30 °C in 40 ml of induction medium composed of 1× M9 salts, 0.2% casamino acids, 0.5% glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. When an A 550 of 0.5 was attained, tryptophan was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml, and the culture was incubated at 37 °C for a further 4 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with 40 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and suspended in 4 ml of 1× binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9) containing 200 μg/ml lysozyme and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Extracts were prepared by freezing at −80 °C for 16 h and thawing on ice for 2 h, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min. The extract was then applied to a 1-ml Ni2+-resin column, washed with 10 ml of 1× binding buffer, and eluted with buffer composed of 60 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9. The eluted sample was concentrated to ∼1 mg/ml by using a Centricon-30 microconcentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA), diluted with an equal volume of glycerol containing 2 mm DTT, and stored at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). A steady-state kinetic analysis was performed based on the method of Boosalis et al. (26Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14689-14696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 47-mer template (3′-GCGCGGCTTAAGGGCGATCGTTATAGCTTAAGGCCTTTAAAGGGCCC-5′) was hybridized with one of four 5′-32P end-labeled primers: the 23-mer (5′-CGCGCCGAATTCCCGCTAGCAAT-3′), the 24-mer (5′-CGCGCCGAATTCCCGCTAGCAATA-3′), the 25-mer (5′-CGCGCCGAATTCCCGCTAGCAATAT-3′), or the 26 mer (5′-CGCGCCGAATTCCCGCTAGCAATATC-3′). Primer/template (5 nm) was incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in a reaction mixture containing limiting amounts of HisKlenow(exo−) protein and varying concentrations of each dNTP or rNTP in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 7.5 mm DTT. The ranges of nucleotide substrate concentrations used were 0.5–10 nm for dNTP incorporation, 0.5–17.5 μm for rNTP incorporation by the wild type and E710D mutant, and 2.5–400 nm for rNTP incorporation by the I709F mutant. Following termination of the reaction by addition of 2.5 μl of formamide solution, the products were analyzed by 14% PAGE and quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (27Patel P.H. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40266-40272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The 47-mer template and 5′-32P end-labeled 24-mer primer used for kinetic analysis of rNTP incorporation were hybridized and incubated at 37 °C for 5–60 min in 10-μl reaction mixtures containing 50 nmHisKlenow(exo−) protein and 1 μm each of all four rNTPs in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 7.5 mm DTT. After the reaction was terminated by the addition of 2.5 μl of formamide solution, the products were analyzed by 14% PAGE followed by autoradiography. We used random sequence mutagenesis to create substitutions within the 13 contiguous amino acids comprising motif A of E. coli pol I (Val700–Arg712). We then selected functional mutants in E. coli JS200 (recA718 polA12), a strain that contains a temperature-sensitive mutation in the pol I gene (polA) and can be propagated at 30 °C but not at 37 °C (20Sweasy J.B. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1407-1410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Witkin E.M. Boegner-Maniscalco V. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4166-4168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant wild-type polA was able to fully complement the temperature-sensitive phenotype, such that E. coli JS200 harboring the plasmid pECpol IS exhibited a 100% survival rate at 37 °C relative to 30 °C. The recombinant strain carrying pECpoldum, a nonfunctional stuffer vector, showed a 0.5% survival rate at 37 °C, indicating that the background for our complementation-based selection assay was 0.5%. The randomly mutated E. coli pol I library consisted of 500,000 independent clones. DNA sequencing of 26 unselected clones indicated that the average number of amino acid changes within motif A was three. The unselected library included 10% dummy vectors, and 40% of the clones had a deletion and/or insertion within or outside of motif A, which may have been introduced in the process of library construction. Following transformation of the library into E. coli JS200, 8% of the clones formed colonies at 37 °C, relative to 30 °C. After subtracting the background, we estimated that there were 37,500 independent clones encoding active pol I proteins. To establish the spectrum of mutations that restored growth of E. coli JS200, we randomly picked 280 colonies that grew at 37 °C, assayed the DNA polymerase activity in cell extracts at 42 °C, isolated the plasmids, and sequenced the 0.15-kilobase pair linker portion containing the 39-base pair randomized region. DNA polymerase activity in extracts of E. coli JS200 carrying the parent plasmid pHSG576 or the stuffer vector pECpoldum was 1–4% of that in extracts of cells carrying pECpol IS that expresses wild-type E. colipol I, indicating that the background polymerase activity is 1–4% (data not shown). We found three clones carrying pECpoldum that exhibited higher activity than clones harboring the original pECpoldum,i.e. 20–25% of wild-type pol I activity; we did not observe complementation when fresh JS200 cells were retransformed by these three stuffer vectors, indicating that the growth observed at 37 °C was likely due to mutation of the host cells. Twelve clones showed very low activity, less than 10% that of clones carrying pECpol IS. Of the 280 total clones, we estimated that 17–18 should represent background, in that 8% of the total library form colonies at 37 °C and 0.5% of the total library are false positives. Therefore, we attributed the 15 clones just described to background and did not analyze them further. Of the remaining 265 clones, 32 had 1 amino acid substitution and 1 had a deletion of 2 amino acids, all of which were outside of motif A; these clones were also not further investigated. No frameshift mutations were observed among the 280 selected clones. The remaining 232 selected, active mutants harbored one to five amino acid substitutions within motif A. As illustrated in Fig.1 A, the average number of mutations was 1–2. The levels of DNA polymerase activity in extracts of the mutants are shown in Fig. 1 B, as a function of the number of amino acid changes. 70% of the 232 mutants retained DNA polymerase activity comparable with that of wild type (within 60%-200%), including almost all of the single mutants and even six of the ten mutants with four amino acid replacements. Moreover, 36% of mutants exhibited activity equal to or greater than the wild type. The number of mutants exhibiting moderate (30–60% of wild type) or low (10–30% of wild type) activity followed a Poisson distribution relative to the number of amino acid substitutions, with a median of two or three amino acid substitutions per clone. In Fig. 2 the amino acid substitutions observed in the selected active clones with one (Fig. 2 A), two (Fig. 2B), or three to five (Fig. 2C) mutations in motif A are shown; the distribution of mutations was similar in the three groups. Six motif A residues (Val700, Val702, Ser703, Ala704, Ser707, and Gln708) tolerated a wide spectrum of substitutions, whereas six others (Ile701, Tyr706, Ile709, Glu710, Leu711, and Arg712) tolerated predominantly conservative substitutions, and only the catalytically essential residue Asp705 was immutable. Glu710 was substituted solely by Asp, indicating that negative charge at this position may be indispensable for polymerase activity in vivo. DNA polymerase activity in extracts of the 53 different mutants with a single amino acid replacement is indicated in Fig. 3. Interestingly, most single mutants with a replacement within the N-terminal 5 amino acids, which form a strand of the structurally conserved anti-parallel β-sheet, exhibited higher than wild-type activity. In contrast, activity tended to be reduced when the C-terminal α-helix region, whose primary structure is practically invariant in the prokaryotic pol I family, was mutated. Thus, even though both the N- and C-terminal portions of motif A are highly mutable, the effects on catalytic activity differ.Figure 3DNA polymerase activity of pol I mutants with single amino acid substitutions in motif A. Substitutions at each residue are listed alphabetically from top tobottom, followed by DNA polymerase activity, relative to wild type. Polymerase activity in cell extracts was assayed at 42 °C by measuring the incorporation of [α-32P]dTTP into gapped calf thymus DNA. Mutant activities are expressed relative to wild type (1.0), i.e. the activity observed in extracts of cells expressing recombinant wild-type pol I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The foregoing results indicate that the primary structure of motif A inE. coli pol I is plastic and that mutations in motif A can be associated with a high degree of biologic and catalytic function. To assess how the highly functioning variant pol I might differ from wild type catalytically, we tested all 53 different single mutants shown in Fig. 3 for altered sugar selectivity. We did this by substituting rGTP for dGTP in the standard DNA polymerase assay. Wild-type pol I exhibited poor incorporation of rGTP in this assay, as did all the single mutants except the four having an Ile709 to Met, Asn, Phe, or Ala substitution (Fig. 4 and data not shown). Mutants carrying a I709S substitution, such as I701M/A704G/I709S and V700A/L711V/I709S, also exhibited efficient incorporation of rGTP. In contrast, neither the single mutant E710D nor additional mutants such as I701V/V702I/E710D and I709V/E710D/R712S were effective in incorporating rGTP (data not shown). We chose the single mutant I709F, which showed the most efficient rNTP incorporation, for detailed analysis of rNTP discrimination. We also analyzed E710D as a reference enzyme; E710D did not exhibit enhanced rNTP incorporation but has displayed modestly reduced discrimination against rNTPs in other assays (28Astatke M. Ng K. Grindley N.D.F. Joyce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3402-3407Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To eliminate the possibility of proof-reading by the 3′-5′ exonuclease activity of E. coli pol I, we constructed exonuclease-deficient derivatives of the Klenow fragment (24Derbyshire V. Freemont P.S. Sanderson M.R. Beese L. Friedman J.M. Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Science. 1988; 240: 199-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), containing an intact polymerase domain. The wild-type and mutant Klenow fragments were expressed in E. coli as N-terminal hexahistidine fusion proteins (HisKlenow(exo−)) and purified by one-step nickel affinity chromatography. The wild-type, I709F, and E710D preparations each yielded a single band of ∼68 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 5); the estimated purity was ≥95% in all cases, and importantly, no bands of 109 kDa (the molecular mass of endogenous pol I) were detected. We used a steady-state, gel-based assay employing oligonucleotide primer templates (26Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14689-14696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to analyze the kinetics of rNTP incorporation by the purified exonuclease-deficient Klenow fragments. The wild-type and mutant proteins showed typical Michaelis-Menten saturation kinetics when initial velocity was plotted against the concentration of either rNTP or dNTP (data not shown). The parameters K m andV max were derived by hyperbolic curve fitting and were used to calculate k cat, catalytic efficiency, and rNTP/dNTP discrimination factors (TableI). The catalytic constantk cat was obtained by dividingV max by the enzyme concentration. The catalytic efficiency, expressed ask cat/K m, is a measure of the efficiency of nucleotide incorporation. The discrimination factor dNTP/rNTP, calculated as the ratio of efficiencies for incorporation of dNTP versus the corresponding rNTP, is a measure of intrinsic enzymatic specificity for the correct sugar. As indicated in Table I, the discrimination against rNTPs exhibited by the wild-type enzyme ranged from 650- to 53,000-fold; the discrimination was associated exclusively with elevated K m values for rNTPs, the rate constants for all substrates being essentially the same. The mutant I709F was indistinguishable from wild type with respect to incorporation of dNTPs, in accord with the near wild-type activity in the standard nucleotide incorporation assay employing gapped DNA and all four dNTPs (Fig. 4). However, the ability of the I709F mutant to discriminate against rNTPs is impaired; the observed discrimination factors ranged from 20- to 80-fold less than wild type, virtually entirely because of decreased K m values for rNTPs relative to the wild-type value. These findings indicate that Ile709 in wild-type pol I functions to exclude ribonucleotides from the genome, at least in part via diminished incorporation of rNTPs. As shown below, the I709F mutant also discriminates against extension of incorporated ribonucleotides less efficiently than the wild-type exo− Klenow fragment. In contrast to the I709F mutation, the E710D substitution had little or no effect on either incorporation of dNTPs or discrimination against rNTPs. These observations are in accord with essentially wild-type activity in both the standard DNA polymerase and ribonucleotide incorporation assays.Table IKinetic analysis of dNTP and rNTP incorporation by wild-type and mutant exo− Klenow fragmentsProteinNucleotidedNTPrNTPdNTP/rNTP discrimination 1-adNTP/rNTP discrimination equals efficiency of dNTP incorporation (k cat/K m) relative to the efficiency of rNTP incorporation.k cat × 103K mk cat/K mk cat× 103K mk cat/K ms−1nmm−1s−1s−1nmm−1s−1Wild typeG3.3 ± 0.42.5 ± 0.71.3 × 1062.4 ± 0.1(1.2 ± 0.1) × 1032.0 × 103650A3.1 ± 0.31.6 ± 0.41.9 × 1065.4 ± 1.7(17 ± 8.8) × 1033.2 × 1025,900C3.0 ± 0.31.9 ± 0.51.6 × 1062.3 ± 0.1(1.1 ± 0.1) × 1032.1 × 103760T/U3.1 ± 0.21.3 ± 0.32.4 × 1063.7 ± 1.1(83 ± 29) × 1034553,000I709FG3.2 ± 0.42.0 ± 0.71.6 × 1062.6 ± 0.114 ± 1.11.9 × 1058.4A3.1 ± 0.21.1 ± 0.32.8 × 1063.8 ± 0.2(3.9 ± 0.4) × 1029.7 × 103290C2.9 ± 0.21.5 ± 0.31.9 × 1062.4 ± 0.113 ± 1.81.8 × 10511T/U2.8 ± 0.20.8 ± 0.33.5 × 1062.8 ± 0.5(1.4 ± 0.3) × 1032.0 × 1031,800E710DG3.0 ± 0.21.6 ± 0.41.9 × 1062.7 ± 0.1(1.0 ± 0.1) × 1032.7 × 103700A3.0 ± 0.20.9 ± 0.23.3 × 1063.7 ± 0.4(4.6 ± 1.4) × 1038.0 × 1024,100C2.9 ± 0.21.4 ± 0.32.1 × 1062.4 ± 0.1(0.8 ± 0.1) × 1033.0 × 103700T/U3.4 ± 0.21.3 ± 0.32.6 × 1064.5 ± 0.8(35 ± 8.1) × 1031.3 × 10220,0001-a dNTP/rNTP discrimination equals efficiency of dNTP incorporation (k cat/K m) relative to the efficiency of rNTP incorporation.

Treatment of platelets with thrombin induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the JAK3 target substrates STAT1 and STAT3. Platelets from JAK3-deficient mice displayed a decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3. In accordance with these data, pretreatment of human platelets with the JAK3 inhibitor WHI-P131 markedly decreased the base-line enzymatic activity of constitutively active JAK3 and abolished the thrombin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3.

Since the serine protease thrombin is the most potent activator of platelet-mediated coagulation, a better understanding of the signaling pathways regulating thrombin-induced platelet activation may provide the basis for new and effective strategies for prevention and/or treatment of thromboembolism. Recent studies have revealed important roles for several protein-tyrosine kinases in platelet physiology (2Pasquet J.M. Quek L. Pasquet S. Poole A. Matthews J.R. Lowell C. Watson S.P. J. Biol.

The purpose of this study was to examine the role of JAK3 in thrombin-induced platelet activation and aggregation. Here we show genetic and biochemical evidence that implicates JAK3 as one of the regulators of platelet function. Furthermore, our study uniquely identifies a small molecule chemical inhibitor of JAK3 as a novel antiplatelet agent for prevention of potentially fatal thromboembolic events. The JAK3 inhibitor WHI-P131 (4-(4′-hydroxylphenyl)amino-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline) was rationally designed using a homology model for the kinase domain of JAK3, synthesized, and characterized as previously described in detail (9Goodman P.A.

(Germantown, NY). A breeder pair of Jak3knockout mice (Jak3 −/−, C57BL/6 × 129/Sv, H-2b (11Nosaka T. van Deursen J.M. Tripp R.A. Thierfelder W.E. Witthuhn B.A. McMickle A.P. Doherty P.C.

Ihle (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN). These mice were created by the targeted disruption of the Jak3 gene through homologous recombination using the hygromycin resistance gene (Hyg) cassette (11Nosaka T. van Deursen J.M. Tripp R.A. Thierfelder W.E. Witthuhn B.A. McMickle A.P. Doherty P.C. Grosveld G.C. Ihle J.N. Science. 1995; 270: 800-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). These founderJak3 −/− mice were bred with C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME), and the offspring of the F1 generation were back-crossed to C57BL/6 mice. After three generations of back-crossing to C57BL/6 mice, the offspring were intercrossed to produce homozygousJak3 −/− and wild-typeJak3 +/+ mice. The genotype of mice was confirmed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. In brief, a 0.5-inch (1.27-cm) tail tissue section was taken from each mouse and digested at 55 °C in 600 μl of lysis buffer (50 mmTris (pH 8.0), 100 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 1% SDS) with 50 μl of proteinase K (10 mg/ml). Genomic DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extractions and ethanol precipitation (12Treco D.A. Ausubel F.M. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 5th Ed. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 2.1.1-2.1.8Google Scholar). Three primers were employed in the PCR tests: the 30-base primerJak3-S (5′-ACC TAG TCC CCA GCT TGG CTG TCA CTT GGG-3′), the 30-base primer Jak3-AS (5′-CAA AGC GGT GAC ATG TCT CCA GCC CAA ACC-3′), and the 30-base primer Jak3-Hyg(5′-ATG GTT TTT GGA TGG CCT GGG CAT GGA CCG-3′) (Biosynthesis Inc., Lewisville, TX). TheJak3-AS/Jak3-Hyg PCR primer pair yielded a 620-bp mutant PCR product in tissues fromJak3 −/− mice. TheJak3-AS/Jak3-S PCR primer pair yielded a 720-bp wild-type PCR product in tissues from homozygousJak3 +/+ or heterozygousJak3 +/− mice. The homozygousJak3 +/+ genotype was documented by a single 720-bp PCR product, and the homozygousJak3 −/− genotype was documented by a single 620-bp PCR product (Fig. 1). The heterozygous Jak3 +/− genotype was documented by the presence of both 720- and 620-bp PCR products. Each 50-μl PCR medium consisted of 1× PCR buffer II containing 2.5 mmMgCl2 (AmpliTaq Gold kit, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 0.2 mm dNTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 0.4 μm each primer, 6% Me2SO, and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq Gold enzyme. The PCR conditions were 94 °C for 10 min, 30 cycles (94 °C for 1 min, 57 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min with a 5 sec extension), then 72 °C for 10 min in a Touchdown thermocycler (Hybaid, Potomac, MD). The PCR products were cloned into the original TA cloning vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Sequence analysis was accomplished by ThermoSequenase PCR (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using Cy5-labeled T3 and T7 sequencing primers (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA). DNA sequences were analyzed against published Jak3 DNA sequence using Lasergene software (DNASTAR, Madison, WI). Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was purchased from the Memorial Blood Bank (Minneapolis, MN) and used according to the guidelines of the Parker Hughes Institute Human Subjects Committee. The PRP samples were treated with varying concentrations of WHI-P131 for 20 min at 37 °C. Control PRP samples were treated with vehicle alone. The treated PRP samples were diluted 1:4 with sterile normal saline, and platelets were stimulated with thrombin (0.1 unit/ml; Chronolog Inc., Philadelphia, PA) under stirring. Platelet aggregation was monitored using the Born method of turbidimetric aggregation in a Whole Blood Platelet Aggregometer (Model 560 dual chamber instrument, Chronolog Inc.) for 5 min. When the aggregating agent is added to the platelet-rich plasma according to this method, the formation of the large platelet aggregate is accompanied by a clearing of the plasma. The IC50 values for WHI-P131-mediated inhibition of agonist-induced platelet aggregation were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using GraphPAD Prism Version 2.0 software. In impedance aggregation studies, the increase in electrical impedance caused by adherence and aggregation of platelets on an electrode is measured. For these studies, blood was extracted from Jak3 knockout and control C57BL/6 mice by eye bleeds into tubes containing 15% (v/v) buffer containing 0.8% (w/v) citric acid, 2.2% (w/v) trisodium citrate, and 2.45% (w/v) dextrose and mixed gently to prevent coagulation. Citrated blood was diluted with an equal volume of saline and prewarmed at 37 °C for 5 min. The platelet agonist thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) was added at 1 min to induce aggregation. Thrombin-induced platelet aggregation was measured in wild-type and knockout mice (n = 3 for each type) in the whole blood platelet aggregometer. Platelets were isolated from PRP as previously described (13Asselin J. Gibbins J.M. Achison M. Lee Y.H. Morton L.F. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Watson S.P. Blood. 1997; 89: 1235-1242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and resuspended at a concentration of 3 × 109 cells/ml in modified Tyrode's buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.9 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, 3.3 mm NaH2PO4, and 3.8 mmHepes (pH 7.4)). Platelets were incubated with the indicated concentrations of WHI-P131 or vehicle (PBS supplemented with 1% Me2SO) for 30 min at 37 °C. Platelets were then stimulated at 37 °C with 2 or 10 μg/ml collagen or 0.1 unit/ml thrombin. Stimulation was stopped, and platelets were lysed at the indicated time points by adding ice-cold 3× Triton X-100 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 15 mm EGTA, 3% Triton X-100, 3% sodium deoxycholate, 0.3% SDS, 3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 mm Na3VO4, 60 μg/ml leupeptin, 60 μg/ml aprotinin, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)) and incubating for 1 h on ice. Following removal of the membranous fraction by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 30 min), the samples were subjected to immunoprecipitation utilizing antibodies raised against JAK3 and STAT1 (E23, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or STAT3 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) (14Vassilev A.

E23 recognizes both the α (p91) and β (p84) isoforms of STAT1. Similarly, the anti-STAT3 antibody recognizes both the α (p92) and β (p83) isoforms of STAT3. Immunoprecipitations, immune complex protein kinase assays, and immunoblotting on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) using the ECL chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were conducted as described previously (9Goodman P.A.

For immunoblotting, we used antibodies against phosphotyrosine, JAK3, STAT1, STAT3, phospho-STAT1 (recognizes both STAT1α and STAT1β), and phospho-STAT3 (recognizes both STAT3α and STAT3β) (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse and donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-goat antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Following electrophoresis, kinase gels were dried onto Whatman No. 3 Filter Paper and subjected to phosphorimaging on a molecular imager (Bio-Rad) as well as autoradiography on film. Similarly, all chemiluminescent JAK3 Western blots were subjected to three-dimensional densitometric scanning with the molecular imager and an imaging densitometer using Molecular Analyst/Macintosh Version 2.1 software following the specifications of the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). A JAK3 kinase activity index was determined by comparing the ratios of the kinase activity in PhosphorImager units (PIU) and density of the protein bands in densitometric scanning units (DSU) with those of the base-line sample using the following formulas: activity index = (PIU of kinase band/DSU of JAK3 protein band)test sample; and stimulation index = (PIU of kinase band/DSU of JAK3 protein band)test sample/(PIU of kinase band/DSU of JAK3 protein band)base-line control sample. Platelets (1 × 108/ml) were treated with WHI-P131 (100 μm, 30 min, 37 °C) or vehicle (1% Me2SO) and stimulated with thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) or collagen (10 μg/ml). Isolation of the cytoplasmic and Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions was performed as previously described (18Hirao A. Hamaguchi I. Suda T. Yamaguchi N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2342-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 19Oda A. Druker B.J. Smith M. Salzman E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20075-20081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions were analyzed by Western blot analysis utilizing antibodies raised against JAK3, STAT1, SYK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), STAT3, tubulin, and actin (Sigma). Platelet samples were prepared as previously described (20Quek L.S. Bolen J. Watson S.P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1137-1140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Release of serotonin from thrombin (0.1 unit/ml)-stimulated platelets was measured using a serotonin detection kit (Immunotech, Marseilles, France) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Sonicated platelets were used for measurement of the total serotonin content of platelets. HR-LVSEM was utilized for topographical imaging of the platelet surface membrane as previously reported (21D'Cruz O.J. Venkatachalam T.K. Zhu Z. Shih M.J. Uckun F.M. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Aliquots of human platelets were incubated with 100 μm WHI-P131 or vehicle alone for 30 min. Treated platelets were then stimulated with thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) for 10 s. 3% glutaraldehyde was added to stop the reaction. Samples were prepared for HR-LVSEM as previously described (21D'Cruz O.J. Venkatachalam T.K. Zhu Z. Shih M.J. Uckun F.M. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and analyzed using a Hitachi S-900 SEM instrument at an accelerating voltage of 2 kV. Aliquots of human platelets were incubated with 100 μm WHI-P131 or vehicle alone for 30 min and then stimulated with thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) for 10 s. Samples were prepared for TEM as previously described (22White J. Harker L.A. Zimmerman T.S. Methods in Hematology. Churchhill-Livingston, Inc., New York1983: 1-25Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.1% glutaraldehyde was added to stop the reaction. Following a brief centrifugation, the sample pellets were layered with 3% glutaraldehyde for 40 min at room temperature. The samples were then post-fixed in 1% OsO4 for 1 h at 4 °C, rinsed three times in distilled water at room temperature, and dehydrated in a graded ethanol series (25, 50, 75, 90, 95, and 100%) and 100% propylene oxide. The samples were embedded in Embed 812 (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA). Silver sections were picked up on mesh grids and stained for 10 min in 1% uranyl acetate and 70% ethanol and for 10 min in Reynold's lead citrate. Sections were viewed in a Jeol 100× electron microscope at 60 kV. True magnifications were determined by photographing a calibration grid at each magnification step on the microscope and using this scale to determine final print enlargements. Mice were treated intravenously with a single intraperitoneal bolus injection of 200 μl of vehicle (PBS supplemented with 10% Me2SO) or varying doses of WHI-P131 in 200 μl of vehicle 30 min prior to and with an intravenous bolus of the same dose 5 min before the bleeding time measurements. Mice were placed in a tube holder, and tail bleeding was performed with a 2-mm cut from the protruding tail tip. The tail was placed vertically into 10 ml of normal saline in a 37 °C water bath, and bleeding times were determined at 30 min post-intraperitoneal injection of WHI-P131 as previously described (1Teng C.M.

Pharmacol. 1997; 320: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). 4–6-week-old male ICR mice were treated intravenously with 200 μl of vehicle (PBS supplemented with 10% Me2SO) or varying doses of WHI-P131 in 200 μl of vehicle administered in two bolus injections 30 min (intraperitoneal bolus) and 5 min (intravenous bolus) prior to the thromboplastin challenge. The mice were challenged with 25 mg/kg thromboplastin (Sigma) via an intravenous bolus injection into the tail vein as previously described (23Sato K. Taniuchi Y. Kawasaki T. Hirayama F. Koshio H. Matsumoto Y. Iizumi Y. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 78: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). At the time of thromboembolism-related death after the thromboplastin injection or elective sacrifice at 48 h using ketamine/xylazine, all mice were perfused with PBS, followed by 4% phosphate-buffered Formalin. PBS and Formalin were pumped through the left ventricle of the heart and allowed to exit through a 3-mm incision through the anterior wall of the right ventricle. During necropsy, several selected tissues (brain, heart, liver, and lungs) were harvested, fixed in 10% neutral buffered Formalin, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin by routine methods for histopathological examination. Glass slides with affixed 6-μm tissue sections were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin or Masson's trichrome. We first set out to examine the effects of thrombin stimulation on the phosphorylation status of STAT1 and STAT3 proteins in platelets from wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Notably, treatment of platelets with 0.1 unit/ml thrombin induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the α isoform (p91) of STAT1 (Fig.2 A) and the β isoform (p83) of STAT3 (Fig. 2 B). Thrombin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 was JAK3-dependent because thrombin stimulation failed to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of these STAT proteins in JAK3-deficient platelets from Jak3knockout mice (Jak3 −/−). Similarly, stimulation of human platelets with 0.1 unit/ml thrombin enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 proteins (Fig.2, C and D). Pretreatment of human platelets with the JAK3 inhibitor WHI-P131 (100 μm) decreased the base-line enzymatic activity of constitutively active JAK3 by 81% as measured by autophosphorylation (Fig. 2 E) and abolished the thrombin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 (F and G). It is noteworthy that at 60 s after thrombin stimulation, the enzymatic activity of JAK3 was reduced by 41% (activity index: 0.35 = 59% of the activity index before thrombin stimulation) (Fig. 2 E, first andsecond lanes). The significance of this observation is currently unknown. Activation of platelets after exposure to thrombin is associated with actin polymerization and rapid translocation of the tyrosine kinase SYK (24Sada K. Minami Y. Yamamura H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 827-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 25Tohyama Y. Yanagi S. Sada K. Yamamura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32796-32799Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as tubulin to the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction that is associated with the actin filament network. As shown in Fig. 3 A, Western blot analysis of the cytoplasmic and Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions from unstimulated platelets confirmed the presence of abundant amounts of actin in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction and of SYK as well as tubulin in the Triton X-100-soluble (but not -insoluble) fraction. Within 60 s after thrombin stimulation, a significant amount of SYK and tubulin translocated to the membrane-associated cytoskeleton as evidenced by the Western blot detection of SYK and tubulin in the actin-containing Triton X-100-insoluble fractions. Notably, thrombin stimulation also induced the translocation of JAK3, STAT1α/β, and STAT3β proteins to the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction. As shown in Fig. 3 B, pretreatment of platelets with the JAK3 inhibitor WHI-P131 prevented the thrombin-induced relocalization of SYK, tubulin, JAK3, STAT1, and STAT3 to the Triton X-100-insoluble fractions. Platelet activation after thrombin stimulation was accompanied by marked changes in platelet shape and ultrastructural organization. Topographical imaging of the surface membrane of thrombin (0.1 unit/ml)-stimulated human platelets by HR-LVSEM at 40× magnification showed development of pseudopodious extensions indicative of activation (Fig. 4, A and B). WHI-P131 (100 μm) inhibited thrombin-induced pseudopod formation (Fig. 4, C and D). Examination of thrombin-stimulated platelets by TEM at 40,000× magnification showed a rapid shape change from discoidal cells to spheres with pseudopods extending from the surface and coalescence of granules as well as canalicular cisternae in the center of the platelet as a prelude to degranulation (Fig. 5,A and B). In contrast, no pseudopods were observed, and the granules remained uniformly dispersed after thrombin stimulation of WHI-P131-treated platelets (Fig. 5, C andD). In accordance with its inhibitory effects on activation-associated shape changes and granule migration in thrombin-stimulated platelets, WHI-P131 inhibited platelet degranulation after thrombin stimulation as evidenced by a markedly reduced amount of serotonin secreted from WHI-P131-treated platelets after thrombin challenge (Fig. 5 E). The measured serotonin values in platelet supernatants were 157 ± 26 nm for vehicle-treated control platelets (n = 4), 907 ± 20 nm for vehicle-treated, thrombin-stimulated platelets (n = 4), and 313 ± 19 nm for WHI-P131-treated, thrombin-stimulated platelets (n = 4). Taken together, these results provide unprecedented evidence that JAK3 plays a critical role during the earliest events of thrombin-induced platelet activation.Figure 5Effects of WHI-P131 on thrombin-induced ultrastructural changes and degranulation in platelets. A–C, aliquots of human platelets were incubated with 100 μm WHI-P131 or vehicle alone for 30 min and then stimulated with thrombin (0.1 unit/ml) for 10 s. Samples were prepared for TEM as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Sections were viewed in a Jeol 100× electron microscope at 60 kV.A, TEM images of untreated unstimulated control (CON) platelets with a typical discoid appearance and disperse distribution of granules; B, TEM images of vehicle-treated, thrombin-stimulated platelets with spike-like pseudopodia and coalescence of granules in the center; C, TEM images of WHI-P131-treated unstimulated platelets; D, TEM images of WHI-P131-treated, thrombin-stimulated platelets with the largely discoid appearance of resting platelets; E, serotonin release from platelets stimulated with 1 unit/ml thrombin for 60 s measured using the serotonin detection kit according to the manufacturer's specifications.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next sought to examine the role of JAK3 in thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. To this end, we first compared the thrombin-induced aggregatory responses of platelets from wild-type and Jak3knockout mice. As shown in Fig. 6, the magnitude of the thrombin (0.1 unit/ml)-induced aggregatory response ofJak3 +/+ platelets from wild-type mice was greater than that of Jak3 −/−platelets from Jak3 knockout mice. In accordance with these results, pretreatment of human platelets with the JAK3 inhibitor WHI-P131 for 30 min inhibited thrombin (0.1 unit/ml)-induced platelet aggregation in a concentration-dependent fashion, with an average IC50 value of 1.5 μm (Fig.7, A and B). By comparison, WHI-P258, a structurally similar compound that does not inhibit JAK3, did not affect the thrombin-induced aggregation of platelets even at 100 μm (Fig. 7, A andC).Figure 7Effects of the JAK3 inhibitor WHI-P131 on thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. A, composite concentration effect curve of WHI-P131. In two independent experiments, triplicate platelet-rich plasma samples were treated with varying concentrations of the JAK3 inhibitor WHI-P131, the parent compound WHI-P258, or vehicle (1% Me2SO in phosphate-buffered saline) and then stimulated with thrombin (0.1 unit/ml). Platelet aggregation was monitored in a platelet aggregometer. Results are expressed as the percent control of thrombin-induced maximum platelet aggregation as a function of the applied WHI-P131 concentration.B and C, representative traces of aggregation curves of platelets treated with WHI-P131 (100 μm; shown in B), WHI-P258 (shown in C), or vehicle and then stimulated with thrombin (0.1 unit/ml). Platelet aggregation was monitored in a platelet aggregometer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) WHI-P131 is not toxic to mice or monkeys when administered systemically at dose levels ranging from 1 to 100 mg/kg. WHI-P131 prolonged the tail bleeding times of mice in a dose-dependent manner: the average tail bleeding times were 1.5 ± 0.1 min for vehicle-treated controls (n = 12), 9.4 ± 0.6 min for 20 mg/kg WHI-P131 (n = 5; p < 0.001), >10 min for 40 mg/kg WHI-P131 (n = 10; p < 0.001), and >10 min for 80 mg/kg WHI-P131 (n = 10;p < 0.001). Notably, WHI-P131 also improved the survival outcome in a mouse model of thromboplastin-induced generalized and invariably fatal thromboembolism (Fig. 8). In this model, 100% of the challenged mice develop dyspnea, ataxia, and seizures and die within 10 min after the thromboplastin challenge from widespread thrombosis in multiple organs and massive pulmonary thromboembolism. All of the 20 vehicle-treated mice died after the thromboplastin challenge, with a median survival time of 2.5 min. WHI-P131 more than doubled the median survival time and produced an event-free survival outcome of 30 ± 15% (Fig. 8). The cause of death in WHI-P131-pretreated thromboplastin-challenged mice was generalized thromboembolism. No drug-related toxic lesions were detected in any of the organs of these mice. All of the 20 control mice treated with 80 mg/kg WHI-P131 without a subsequent thromboplastin challenge survived beyond the 48-h observation period without any evidence of impaired health status or bleeding. In summary, our findings reveal an essential role for JAK3 in thrombin-induced platelet activation and aggregation. As a serine protease, thrombin activates protease-activated receptors 1 and 4 (26Kahn M.L. Nakanishi-Matsui M. Shapiro M.J. Ishihara H. Coughlin S.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) by cleaving the N-terminal portion of the receptor. The cleaved peptide then acts as a tethered ligand that activates the G-protein-coupled receptor independent of receptor cleavage (27Hammes S.R. Coughlin S.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2486-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). JAK3 may bind to the cytoplasmic C-terminal portion of the protease-activated receptor(s) and play a pivotal role in transduction of the thrombin-induced biochemical signal once the receptor is cleaved. Further studies are needed to decipher the molecular mechanism of JAK3-mediated regulation of platelet function. WHI-P131 inhibited thrombin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 proteins as well as activation-associated translocation of SYK and tubulin to the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction. In agreement with these results, platelets from JAK3-deficient mice displayed a decrease in thrombin-induced platelet aggregation and tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3. Following thrombin stimulation, WHI-P131-treated platelets did not undergo shape changes indicative of activation such as pseudopod formation. WHI-P131 inhibited thrombin-induced degranulation/serotonin release as well as platelet aggregation. Highly effective platelet inhibitory plasma concentrations (≥10 μm) of WHI-P131 were achieved in mice without toxicity. WHI-P131 prolonged the bleeding time of mice in a dose-dependent manner and improved event-free survival in a mouse model of thromboplastin-induced generalized and fatal thromboembolism, involving the lungs, liver, heart, and central nervous system. Thus, this study uniquely identifies WHI-P131 as a novel antiplatelet agent targeting JAK3 for prevention of potentially fatal thromboembolic events. To our knowledge, WHI-P131 is the first anti-thrombotic agent that prevents platelet aggregation by inhibiting JAK3. WHI-P131 is also being developed as an apoptosis-promoting anticancer agent (28Mahajan S. Ghosh S. Sudbeck E.A. Zheng Y. Downs S. Hupke M. Uckun F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9587-9599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). JAK3 inhibitors such as WHI-P131 may be useful as a new class of anticoagulants for treatment of hypercoagulable metastatic cancer patients as well as patients with a primary cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or hematologic disease at risk for thromboembolic complications."
https://openalex.org/W2041753238,"Nitric oxide (NO) has been reported to inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells by increasing the phosphorylation of the α-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2. However, the mechanism through which this increase occurs has not been characterized. In this report, we examined the effect of the diffusible gases nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) on the activation of the heme-regulated eIF2α kinase (HRI) in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Spectral analysis indicated that both NO and CO bind to the N-terminal heme-binding domain of HRI. Although NO was a very potent activator of HRI, CO markedly suppressed NO-induced HRI activation. The NO-induced activation of HRI was transduced through the interaction of NO with the N-terminal heme-binding domain of HRI and not throughS-nitrosylation of HRI. We postulate that the regulation of HRI activity by diffusible gases may be of wider physiological significance, as we further demonstrate that NO generators increase eIF2α phosphorylation levels in NT2 neuroepithelial and C2C12 myoblast cells and activate HRI immunoadsorbed from extracts of these non-erythroid cell lines.

Miami Winter Symp. 1979; 16: 321-345Google Scholar). eIF2 delivers Met-tRNAi in a complex with GTP to 43 S ribosomal initiation complexes and is released as a complex with GDP at the completion of the initiation cycle. Recycling of eIF2·GDP and the formation of eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAi complexes requires the action of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B. Under heme-deficient conditions, HRI is activated and phosphorylates eIF2. Phosphorylated eIF2 avidly binds eIF2B, sequestering eIF2B in a poorly dissociable complex, which subsequently leads to the inhibition of the initiation of translation, as eIF2·GDP complexes that are present in excess of eIF2B fail to recycle. Thus, HRI functions to coordinate globin synthesis with heme availability in RRL. The amino acid sequence deduced from HRI cDNA indicates that it is composed of at least five distinct domains (4Chen J.J. Throop M.S. Gehrke L. Kuo I. Jayanta K.P. Brodsky M. London I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7729-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The unique N-terminal domain of HRI contains ∼165 amino acids. The second and fourth domains contain conserved sequence motifs I–V and motifs VI–XI, which comprise the N-terminal and C-terminal catalytic lobes of protein kinases, respectively. The third and fifth domains are also unique, consisting of ∼140 amino acids that are inserted between the two conserved kinase lobes and ∼50 amino acids at the C terminus, respectively. HRI is a hemoprotein that contains two distinct of heme-binding sites (5Chefalo P.J. Oh J. Rafie-Kolpin M. Kan B. Chen J.-J. Eur. J.

Heme binding to the first site is stable, and remains associated with purified HRI, whereas heme-binding to the second site is reversible and appears to be responsible for the rapid heme-induced down-regulation of HRI activity. We have recently demonstrated that the N-terminal domain of HRI contains the stable heme-binding site, whereas the unique third domain of HRI appears to contain the reversible heme-binding site (6Rafie-Kolpin M.

Nitric oxide (NO) is now recognized as a major signaling molecule (8Ignarro L.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 535-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar, 9Zhang J. Snyder S.H.

Like NO, carbon monoxide (CO) has also been identified as an endogenous second messenger in the peripheral and central nervous system, and has been demonstrated to play an important role in hemodynamic regulation (10Snyder S.H. Jaffrey S.R. Zakhary R. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 26: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 11Foresti R. Motterlini R. Free Radic.

Recently, the cytostatic activity of NO was found to correlate with NO-induced increase in eIF2α phosphorylation and inhibition of protein synthesis in a number of cell lines (15Kim Y.-M. Son K. Hong S.-J. Green A. Chen J.-J. Tzeng E. Hierholzer C. Billiar T.R. Mol. Medicine. 1998; 4: 179-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of this NO-induced increase in eIF2α phosphorylation was not characterized. In this report, we examined the possible function of the NT-HBD in the regulation of HRI activation, and present evidence that HRI activity is regulated by the binding of the diffusible gases NO and CO to its NT-HBD. Protein synthesis was determined by measuring the incorporation of [14C]leucine into the acid-precipitable protein in 5-μl aliquots taken from standard RRL mixtures containing 20 μm hemin at 30 °C as described (16Ernst V.

The phosphorylation of eIF2α in 2 μl of protein synthesis mixes was analyzed as previously described by Western blotting of one-dimensional vertical isoelectric focusing (VIEF) slab gels using 1:1000 dilution of anti-eIF2α monoclonal ascites fluid (18Thulasiraman V.

The NO generator NOC-9 (Calbiochem) was prepared as a 100 mm stock solution in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and used immediately for experiments in RRL or in vitro. NOC-9 breaks down to form NO with a half-life of 3 min at pH 7.4. For CO treatments, samples (RRL or immunoresins) were gassed in a fume hood with CO (99.0+% CO; Sigma) for 3 min on ice by directing a stream of CO through a 21-gauge needle at the surface of the sample with sufficient velocity to cause continuous mixing of the microcentrifuge tube contents. The tubes were then sealed with parafilm prior to any further incubations. Coupled transcription/translation reactions to pulse-label [35S]HRI and His7-[35S]HRI in nuclease-treated RRL (TnT RRL, Promega) were carried out as described previously (21Uma S. Hartson S.D.

After radiolabeling, one volume of TnT protein synthesis mix containing either [35S]HRI and His7-[35S]HRI was mixed with seven volumes of normal heme-deficient or hemin-supplemented (10 μm hemin) protein synthesis mixes containing non-nuclease-treated RRL and the protein synthesis initiation inhibitor aurintricarboxylic acid (60 μm). The samples were then incubated for 50 min at 30 °C to yield “mature-competent” HRI (50 min in hemin-supplemented RRL), “transformed” HRI (50 min in heme-deficient RRL), or “repressed” HRI (40 min in heme-deficient RRL, followed by a 10-min incubation in the presence of 10 μm hemin) (21Uma S.

The in situ effects of NO, CO, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), or dithiothreitol (DTT) on HRI were then assayed by treating samples with NOC-9, gassing RRL with CO, or treatment of samples with NEM or DTT followed by an additional period of incubation at 30 °C as specified in the figure legends. HRI was then affinity-purified and assayed for kinase activity as described below. Immunoadsorption of His7-[35S]HRI by anti-His5antibodies (Qiagen) and non-immune control antibodies were done as previously described (22Uma S. Thulasiraman V. Matts R.L. Mol. Cell.

Autophosphorylation of HRI was assayed by the incorporation of [32P]Piinto HRI during eIF2α kinase assays incubated with [γ-32P]ATP. 32P-Labeled HRI and eIF2α were detected by quantitatively quenching 35S emissions with three intervening layers of previously developed x-ray film (21Uma S.

To study the effects of NO or CO on HRI activation in vitro, HRI was synthesized de novo and matured for 60 min in hemin-supplemented or heme-deficient RRL, or in heme-deficient RRL (50 min) followed by the addition of 10 μm hemin (for 10 min) to yield mature-competent, transformed HRI and repressed HRI, respectively. HRI was then affinity-purified, and autophosphorylation of HRI was assayed by the incorporation of [32P]Pi into HRI incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and treated or untreated with NO or CO as described above. A non-His-tagged [35S]HRI was similarly studied for nonspecific interactions to the resin. Recombinant NT-HBD of HRI was purified as previously described (7Uma S. Matts R.L. Guo Y. White S.

Spectral analysis was done using a Shimdazu UV-160 spectrophotometer scanning the NT-HBD dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl from 200 to 650 nm. The NT-HBD was then reduced by the addition of several grains of dithionite to the cuvette. Immediately after the spectrum of reduced NT-HBD was obtained, NOC-9 was added to a concentration of ∼1 mm, or the cuvette was gassed with 99.0+% CO for 3 min to obtain the spectra of NO-bound and CO-bound NT-HBD, respectively.

Neurosci. 1992; 12: 1802-1815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and C2C12 myoblast cells were cultured in DMEM in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin/streptomycin and 5% CO2 to ∼70% confluence. The cells were then grown overnight (16 h) in DMEM supplemented with 10 μm hemin-HCl. Cells were washed two times with Hank's buffered saline, lysed directly by scraping cells from the culture flasks with lysis buffer (∼1 ml/2.5 × 107 cells) containing 30 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm DTT, 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), and protease-inhibitor mixture (Sigma; 100 μl/107 cells solubilized). The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and HRI was then immunoadsorbed with anti-HRI NT-HBD antibody from 10 μl of mouse polyclonal ascites fluid or a control non-immune antibody that had been previously adsorbed to mouse anti-IgG cross-linked to agarose (24Matts R.L. Xu Z. Pal J.K. Chen J.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18160-18167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse polyclonal anti-HRI NT-HBD antibody was raised against affinity-purified recombinant NT-HBD by the HYCABS core facility (Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK). The immune pellets were washed one time with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl and 1% (v/v) Tween 20, and two times with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl, and assayed for associated kinase activity as described above. Levels of eIF2α phosphorylation present in C2C12 cells were determined by lysis of cells directly in VIEF sample buffer and Western blotting of samples separated on VIEF slab gels as described previously (25Benton P.A. Barret D.J. Matts R.L. Lloyd R.E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5525-5532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Levels of eIF2α phosphorylation present in NT-2 cells were determined by Western blotting of cell extracts separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with antibody specific to phosphorylated eIF2α (Ref. 26DeGracia D.J. Sullivan J.M. Neumar R.W. Alousi S.S. Hikade K.R. Pittman J.E. White B.C. Rafols J.A. Krause G.S. J. Cereb.

To determine the effects of NO on protein synthesis varying concentrations of the NO generator NOC-9 was added to hemin-supplemented RRL (Fig.1 a). Low concentrations of NOC-9 stimulated protein synthesis slightly, while high concentrations of NOC-9 caused a rapid and complete shut-off of protein synthesis. To examine the mechanism by which NO inhibits translation, the phosphorylation status of eIF2α in NOC-9-treated RRL was analyzed (Fig. 1 b). NO generation stimulated eIF2α phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner with 1 mmNOC-9 treatment of hemin-supplemented RRL causing a near quantitative phosphorylation of eIF2α. To determine the effect of CO on protein synthesis, RRL was gassed with 100% CO for 3 min on ice. CO stimulated the rate of protein synthesis in hemin-supplemented RRL by ∼50% (Fig.2 a). Translation in heme-deficient RRL was stimulated 40% by CO during the first 5 min of incubation, but shut-off of translation was not prevented by CO (data not shown). Similarly, pre-gassing of heme-supplemented RRL with CO stimulated translation by ∼40% during the first 5 min of incubation in NOC-9-treated RRL, but did not prevent translational shut-off (Fig.2 a). These observations suggested that NO and CO have opposing effects on protein synthesis in RRL. To determine whether NO modulated the activation of HRI, His7-tagged [35S]HRI was synthesized by coupled transcription/translation in nuclease-treated RRL and then matured in normal RRL in the presence or absence of hemin to generate specific populations of HRI molecules (see Refs. 21Uma S.

Biol. 1999; 19: 5861-5871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar for detailed descriptions of the HRI populations). Samples were then treatedin situ with increasing concentrations of NOC-9, and the His7-tagged HRI was affinity-purified and assayed for kinase activity (Fig. 3 a). His7-tagged [35S]HRI that was matured in hemin-supplemented RRL (+, mature-competent HRI) was an inactive kinase. HRI that was matured in heme-deficient RRL was transformed into an active auto- and eIF2α kinase (−, transformed HRI]. The kinase activity of transformed HRI was inhibited by addition of hemin (−/+, repressed HRI) to the heme-deficient incubations. Addition of 1 mm NOC-9 caused a marked enhancement of the autokinase and eIF2α kinase activity of mature-competent, transformed and repressed HRI (Fig. 3 a, lanes 12–14). Although 0.01 and 0.1 mm NOC-9 had little stimulatory effect on the eIF2α kinase activity of transformed HRI, these concentrations of NOC-9 increased the activity of repressed HRI to that of transformed HRI in untreated heme-deficient RRL. Although 0.1 mm NOC-9 caused mature-competent HRI to become as active an eIF2α kinase as transformed HRI in untreated heme-deficient RRL, it also caused a small decrease in the autokinase activity of transformed and repressed HRI. This decreased autokinase activity may explain the slight enhancement of protein synthesis that was observed in the presence of low NOC-9 concentrations in Fig. 1 a. To establish whether the effect of NOC-9 on the kinase activity of HRI was through a direct interaction of NO with HRI, mature-competent, transformed, and repressed His7-[35S]HRI were affinity-purified and assayed for autokinase activity in the presence of varying concentrations of NOC-9 in vitro (Fig.3 b). The autokinase activity of all the three forms of HRI were activated upon treatment with NOC-9 in vitro in a concentration-dependent fashion, with repressed HRI being the most sensitive to NO-induced activation (3-fold in the presence of 0.01 mm NOC-9). Subsequent studies were carried out with repressed HRI, as stress-induced activation of repressed HRI in hemin-supplemented RRL occurs independent of changes in heme concentration (18Thulasiraman V. Xu Z. Uma S. Gu Y. Chen J.-J. Matts R.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 552-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 22Uma S. Thulasiraman V. Matts R.L. Mol. Cell.

Thus, repressed HRI is the form of HRI that is likely to be the most physiologically relevant target for regulation by diffusible gases in vivo. Order-of-addition studies were carried out to determine whether CO and NO have competing effects on HRI activation (Fig. 2 b). Gassing repressed His7-[35S]HRI with 100% CO suppressed its autokinase activity below that of the ungassed control, and dramatically suppressed the autokinase activity of repressed His7-[35S]HRI that had been affinity-purified from NOC-9-treated RRL. Furthermore, in vitro treatment with NOC-9 markedly enhanced the autokinase activity of repressed His7-[35S]HRI that had been affinity-purified from CO-gassed RRL. These results suggest that CO and NO compete for a common binding site in HRI and have opposing effects on HRI activation. The physiological effects of NO are mediated through a number of mechanisms, including (i) S-nitrosylation of proteins (30Broillet M.-C. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), (ii) the generation of free radicals and oxidative stress (31Ducrocq C. Blanchard B. Pignatelli B. Ohshima H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1068-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), or (iii) the coordination of NO by protein-bound heme (12Tsai A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 32Henry Y. Guissani A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1003-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The only known biological reactivity of CO is as a ligand for protein-bound heme, and CO is neither sulfhydryl- nor redox-active. Thus, the observations that CO both blocks and reverses NO-induced activation of HRI strongly suggest that NO induces the activation of HRI through its coordination by heme. However, since sulfhydryl-reactive compounds and oxidative stress are well known to cause the activation of HRI in hemin-supplemented RRL (1Chen J.-J. Ilan J. Translational Regulation of Gene Expression 2. Plenum Press, New York1993: 349-372Crossref Google Scholar, 2Chen J.-J. London I.M. Trends Biochem.

Chem. 1991; 266: 12695-12702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we carried out experiments designed to test the first two possible mechanisms further. To examine whether NO activates HRI by modifying sensitive sulfhydryls of HRI, the effect of NO on the kinase activity of repressed His7-[35S]HRI that was affinity-purified from RRL treated (or not) with NEM was examined (Fig.4 a). Sulfhydryl-reactive compounds, such as NEM, are thought to activate HRI by covalently modifying some sensitive sulfhydryls of HRI (1Chen J.-J. Ilan J. Translational Regulation of Gene Expression 2. Plenum Press, New York1993: 349-372Crossref Google Scholar, 2Chen J.-J. London I.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 105-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 3Hunt T.

Chem. 1992; 267: 20519-20524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NEM-treatment caused an ∼3-fold increase in the autokinase activity of repressed HRI. Treatment of repressed His7-[35S]HRI with NO in vitro led to an even more marked increase in the autokinase activity of HRI. The autokinase activity of HRI affinity-purified from NEM-treated RRL was also markedly increased upon treatment with NO, indicating that NO can further activate HRI containing previously modified sulfhydryls. However, the possibility remained that NO was modifying a different site on HRI than that which was reactive with NEM. To further test the hypothesis that the activation of HRI by NO was not mediated through its effect on sensitive sulfhydryls of HRI or through the generation of a generalized oxidative stress, the effect of the reducing agent DTT on NO-induced activation of repressed HRI was examined (Fig. 4 b). DTT reverses the effect of NO on proteins that are mediated through S-nitrosylation (36Foresti R. Clark J.G. Green C.J. Motterlini R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18411-18417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In addition, DTT protects HRI from activation induced by sulfhydryl-reactive compounds and reverses the activation of HRI induced by generalized oxidative stress and sulfhydryl-reactive heavy metal ions (3Hunt T. Miami Winter Symp. 1979; 16: 321-345Google Scholar, 33Matts R.L. Schatz J.R. Hurst R. Kagen R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12695-12702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Jackson R.J. Herbert P. Cambell E.A. Hunt T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 131: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Addition of DTT prior to NOC-9 treatment had no effect on NO-induced inhibition of protein synthesis (data not shown) or activation of repressed His7-[35S]HRI (Fig. 4 b). To determine whether NO and CO might modulate the activation of HRI through their coordination by heme, a spectral analysis of the recombinant NT-HBD of HRI was carried out. Reduction of HRI's NT-HBD with dithionite caused a shift in the absorption maximum of the Soret band from 414 nm to 428 nm, with the absorption maximum in the α/β region shifting from 534 nm to distinct α- and β-bands with absorption maximum at 560 and 530 nm, respectively (Fig.5 A). Addition of NO caused the Soret peak to shift immediately to 421 nm and decrease in intensity by ∼50%, with the α- and β-bands shifting to 572 and 542 nm, respectively (Fig. 5 B). After 15 min, the Soret band broadened to give an absorption maximum at 402 nm. In contrast, gassing the reduced NT-HBD with CO (Fig. 5 C) caused the Soret band to shift from 428 to 422 nm and increase in intensity by ∼30%, with the absorption maximum of the α- and β-bands shifting to 568 and 536 nm, respectively. These results indicate that NO and CO become coordinated to the heme moiety of the NT-HBD of HRI. To address the question of whether the activation of HRI by NO is due to the NO binding to NT-HBD, we studied the effect of NO on the activity of HRI from which the NT-HBD has been deleted (HRI/Met-3; Ref.6Rafie-Kolpin M. Chefalo P.J. Hussain Z. Hahn J. Uma S. Matts R.L. Chen J.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5171-5178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). His7-[35S]HRI/Met-3 was synthesizedde novo, transformed in heme-deficient RRL, and repressed by the addition of hemin. Compared with wild type His7-[35S]HRI, the kinase activity of His7-[35S]HRI/Met-3 was only marginally activated upon NOC-9 treatment (Fig.6 a). In contrast, treatment with NEM markedly increased the kinase activity of both His7-[35S]HRI/Met-3 and wild type His7-[35S]HRI (Fig. 6 a). These results support the hypothesis that the NT-HBD domain mediates NO-induced activation of HRI. However, we cannot currently rule out the possibility that NO may have additional effects mediated through an interaction with heme bound to the second regulatory heme-binding site in HRI, because NOC-9 treatment reproducibly caused a slight stimulation in kinase activity of HRI/Met-3. To further confirm the involvement of NT-HBD domain of HRI in NO activation, we studied whether [35S]HRI/Met-3 could form a complex with His7-[35S]NT-HBD, and what effect NO had upon the kinase activity of [35S]HRI/Met-3 in such a complex. [35S]HRI/Met-3 and His7-[35S]NT-HBD were co-expressed in TnT RRL, followed by transformation of the [35S]HRI/Met-3 in heme-deficient RRL and treatment (or not) with NOC-9. The ability of anti-His-tag antibodies to co-adsorb [35S]HRI/Met-3 with His7-[35S]NT-HBD indicated that the NT-HBD of HRI interacted with HRI/Met-3 in trans, although the two proteins did not interact quantitatively (Fig. 6 b). [35S]HRI/Met-3 and non-His-tagged [35S]NT-HBD were co-expressed and treated with 1 mm NOC-9, as a control for nonspecific binding. Although the amount of [35S]HRI/Met-3 protein that coadsorbed as a complex with His7-[35S]NT-HBD was much less compared with the amount of His7-[35S]HRI/Met-3 that was directly adsorbed by the anti-His-tag antibodies, assays of eIF2α kinase activity indicated that the specific activity of the [35S]HRI/Met-3 (32P incorporated into substrate per amount of [35S]HRI/Met-3) that was c"

Chemical information outside of the cell is transmitted to the flagella by a network of chemotaxis proteins. Ligand binding to the periplasmic portion of transmembrane receptors controls the autophosphorylation of CheA, a kinase bound to the cytoplasmic portion of the receptors. The phosphoryl group is then transferred from a histidyl residue on CheA to an aspartyl residue on the freely diffusible protein CheY. Phosphorylated CheY (CheY-P) binds to the FliM protein in the flagellar switch, which increases the likelihood of CW rotation (see Refs. 1Silversmith R.E. Bourret R.B.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6865-6873Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar for recent reviews). CheY exhibits an intrinsic autodephosphorylation activity, but this reaction occurs slowly relative to the time scale of changes in in vivobehavior (5Segall J.E. Manson M.D. Berg H.C. Nature. 1982; 296: 855-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and the primary means of dephosphorylation of CheY in the cell is via an auxiliary protein, CheZ. The proteins controlling chemotaxis are an example of a two-component regulatory system, a large family of systems employed in many organisms to mediate sensory processes. An essential biochemical feature of these systems is phosphotransfer from a histidyl residue on a sensor kinase (e.g. CheA) to an aspartyl residue on a response regulator (e.g. CheY) and subsequent hydrolysis of the phosphoryl group from the response regulator (6Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2398) Google Scholar). A series of studies have combined to suggest basic mechanisms for the phosphorylation and autodephosphorylation reactions of CheY, which are likely applicable to other response regulators. CheY can receive a phosphoryl group from small molecules such as acetyl phosphate (7Lukat G. McCleary W.R. Stock A.M. Stock J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) as well as from CheA, evidence that the fundamental machinery for phosphorylation resides on CheY. Both phosphorylation and autodephosphorylation reactions are centered around a Mg2+ion, and both structural (8Stock A.M. Martinez-Hackert E. Rasmussen B.F. West A.H. Stock J.B. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13375-13380Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and mechanistic studies using small molecules as models of the reaction chemistry (9Knowles J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 877-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 10Herschlag D. Jencks W.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 1942-1950Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) are consistent with direct substitution at the phosphoryl phosphorous via a bipyramidal transition state for both reactions. In contrast, the mechanism of CheZ-dependent CheY dephosphorylation is not known. CheZ activity is also Mg2+-dependent (11Lukat G.S. Stock A.M. Stock J.B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5436-5442Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and CheZ does not catalyze the hydrolysis of acetyl phosphate (7Lukat G. McCleary W.R. Stock A.M. Stock J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). These features are consistent with the possibility that CheZ may act as a positive allosteric modulator of CheY autodephosphorylation. Alternatively, CheZ may contribute its own residues to catalysis as does a conventional phosphatase. Possible regulation of CheZ activity by other chemotaxis proteins could help explain the ultrasensitivity of chemotactic sensing in E. coli (12Cluzel P. Surette M. Leibler S. Science. 2000; 287: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 13Bray D. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 41: 469-482Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 14Spiro P.A.

Eisenbach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1232-1236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The interaction of CheZ and CheY-P has been reported to result in large oligomeric complexes (16Blat Y. Eisenbach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1226-1231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which may be involved in CheZ regulation (15Blat Y. Eisenbach M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 284: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The strict conservation among response regulators of essential active site residues (18Volz K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11741-11753Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) as well as the relative orientation of these residues in the folded proteins (19Robinson V.L. Buckler D.R. Stock A.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) reinforces the notion that the basic phosphorylation reaction mechanisms for two-component systems are conserved. Despite this consistency, the rates of the autodephosphorylation reactions can differ over several orders of magnitude for different systems (20Zapf J. Madhusudan M. Grimshaw C.E. Hoch J.A. Varughese K.I. Whiteley J.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7725-7732Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is plausible that nonconserved residues in the vicinity of the active sites of response regulators have evolved to regulate the rates of the phosphorylation reactions in a way that meets the individual needs of a system. Asn59, a nonconserved residue, has a central location in the active site of E. coli CheY as does the analogous residue in other CheY proteins and response regulators. The backbone carbonyl of Asn59 directly chelates the active site Mg2+ in both the inactive (8Stock A.M. Martinez-Hackert E. Rasmussen B.F. West A.H. Stock J.B. Ringe D. Petsko G.A.

The side chain of Asn59 is oriented toward the active site. In this study, we explored the effect of various amino acid substitutions at position 59 of CheY on the activity of this protein. Characterization of a set of mutant proteins, in particular CheY59NR, gave information regarding CheY·CheZ interactions as well as the role Asn59 may play in CheY phosphorylation and autodephosphorylation reactions. The calcium salt of monophosphoimidazole (MPI) (23Rathlev T. Rosenberg T. Arch. Biochem.

Synth. 1972; 13: 23-26Google Scholar) were synthesized as described. Stock solutions of MPI were made fresh and centrifuged before each use to remove small amounts of insoluble calcium phosphate. Acetyl phosphate was from Aldrich. The mutant genes cheY59NR, 59NA,59NK, 59ND, and 59NE were made bydut − ung − mutagenesis (25Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar) of the cheYZ plasmid pRBB40 (26Bourret R.B. Hess J.F. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and cheY23ND was found in a random mutant search as previously described (27Sanna M.G. Swanson R.V. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1069-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant CheY proteins were purified from the K0641recA/pRBB40 strain (26Bourret R.B. Hess J.F. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) according to published procedures (28Hess J.F. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 188-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). CheZ was overexpressed from strain K0642recA/pKCB1.134KE, which was made by site-directed mutagenesis of pRBB40 to correct an inadvertent mutation at position 134 (29Boesch K.C. Silversmith R.E. Bourret R.B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3544-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). CheZ was purified using a published protocol (28Hess J.F. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 188-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), except for the following two changes. First, a 5-ml Hi-trap Q-Sepharose Column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used in place of a MonoQ column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to allow for larger scale preparations. Second, after gel filtration on Superose 12, a portion of the CheZ pool (2–3 mg) was chromatographed on a 1.0-ml MonoQ column. This step removed a contaminating enzymatic activity for MPI hydrolysis that was evident with the phosphate assay (see below) as well as a small amount of the CheZ proteolytic product CheZ1–181, which sometimes forms during purification (29Boesch K.C. Silversmith R.E. Bourret R.B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3544-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The concentrations of CheY and CheZ were determined by absorbance at 280 nm using extinction coefficients of 10,200 m−1cm−1 (CheY) and 16,700m−1 cm−1(CheZ). The extinction coefficients were determined empirically by parallel measurements of absorbance and protein concentration by quantitative amino acid analysis (The Protein Chemistry Laboratory of University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). All chemotaxis assays were performed on K0641recA/pRBB40 strains. The plasmid pRBB40 carries bothcheY and cheZ so that any effect of possible CheY overexpression is counteracted by the presence of a proportional amount of CheZ (30Kuo S.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1307-1314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rates of bacterial swarming on semi-solid agar plates were carried out at 30 °C as described (31Appleby J.L. Bourret R.B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3563-3569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The rotational behavior of the bacterial flagella was determined by tethering analysis (13Bray D. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 41: 469-482Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and the Hobson Tracker system was used to analyze rotating cells (33Schuster M. Zhao R. Bourret R.B. Collins E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19752-19758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The steady state rates of release of inorganic phosphate from reactions containing CheY, MPI, and CheZ were measured using an enzyme-linked spectroscopic assay (Enzchek Pi Kit, Molecular Probes). In this assay, the reactions of interest were carried out in the presence of purine nucleoside phosphorylase and a guanine analog substrate, 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine ribonucleoside (MESG). Purine nucleoside phosphorylase catalyzes the reaction of phosphate with MESG to rapidly form a product that absorbs at 360 nm (34Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). In our experiments, buffer (final concentration of 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 20 mm MgCl2), MESG (final concentration of 200 μm), and MPI were mixed in a cuvette and placed into the spectrophotometer (Beckman DU7500 diode array), and the absorbance at 360 nm was continuously monitored. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase (5 μl; 0.5 units) was added, and an absorbance increase (typically 0.2–0.4 units) resulted due to the presence of inorganic phosphate in the MPI preparations. If appropriate, CheZ was then added. The addition of CheZ did not affect the absorbance of the sample. After 3 min in the cuvette chamber to ensure temperature equilibration, CheY was added to initiate the reaction. After a short lag period (<10 s), a linear increase in absorbance was observed due to release of Pi from CheY-P. Linearity continued until an absorbance of about 1.6, whereupon the slope decreased gradually, as is expected at high absorbance. The time course was monitored for 2–4 min, and the slope of the absorbance change was determined by instrument software. The total volume of the reaction was 450 μl, the temperature of the cuvette was kept at 25 °C with electronic temperature control, and mixing was done manually. The slopes were converted to μmPi/s by using an empirically determined extinction coefficient at 360 nm of 0.0091 μm−1cm−1 at pH 7.0. This is slightly less than a published extinction of 0.011 μm−1cm−1 measured at pH 7.6, as expected (34Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). There was no increase in slope if larger amounts of purine nucleoside phosphorylase were added, indicating that the observed rate was not limited by the linked enzymatic reaction. PAM and acetyl phosphate could not be used as phosphodonors in the enzyme-linked phosphate assay because preparations of these compounds contained levels of contaminating phosphate that gave off-scale absorbances at the concentrations required for efficient phosphorylation. All fluorescence measurements were carried out using a PerkinElmer LS-50B spectrofluorimeter with a circulating water bath for temperature control. Time courses for phosphorylation of CheY were monitored by tryptophan fluorescence using a stopped flow apparatus (Applied Photophysics RX2000) for rapid mixing of the reactants. Fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 292 nm and an emission wavelength of 346 nm, and all reactions were carried out at 25 °C. Data were fitted to an exponential decay, which yielded a first order rate constant (kobs), which is a function of both the rates of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of CheY, as follows: kobs =kphosph[phosphodonor]/Ks +kdephosph (33Schuster M. Zhao R. Bourret R.B. Collins E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19752-19758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The fluorescence anisotropy of fluoresceinated CheZ was monitored as a function of CheY concentration as described (16Blat Y. Eisenbach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1226-1231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 35Silversmith R.E. Bourret R.B. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Rates of autodephosphorylation of CheY-P at room temperature were determined by electrophoretic analysis of 32P]CheY-P as described (36Silversmith R.E. Appleby J.L. Bourret R.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14965-14974Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The buffer was 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 10 mmMgCl2. Multiple (two to four) independent trials were carried out for each CheY. Chromatography was carried out on a high resolution Superose 12 column (1 × 30 cm) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using fast protein liquid chromatography with a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. CheY and CheZ were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio (final mix concentrations of 0.60 mg/ml CheY and 1.0 mg/ml CheZ) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2. For phosphorylating conditions, acetyl phosphate (final concentration of 20 mm) was added to the CheY/CheZ mixtures, allowed to incubate for 3 min to allow for maximal phosphorylation, and then chromatographed on the column that had been equilibrated with freshly prepared 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 20 mm acetyl phosphate immediately before application of the sample. Elution was monitored by ultraviolet detection, and fractions (0.40 ml) were collected. The fractions that corresponded to the observed peaks were pooled, concentrated by Centricon 10 (Amicon/Millipore), and electrophoresed. Molecular weight standards (Bio-Rad gel filtration standards kit and other individual proteins from Sigma) were independently chromatographed on the same column for estimation of the molecular weight of the species eluting from the column. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we made six substitutions at position 59 (arginine, lysine, histidine, aspartate, glutamate, and alanine). The effects of the mutations on chemotaxis were assessed by measurement of the swarm rates and flagellar rotational biases of strains containing the mutant genes (TableI). All the mutant strains except that containing CheY59NA swarmed at a significantly slower rate than the wild-type strain. Decreased swarm rates can result from either an increase or decrease in CCW bias (37Wolfe A. Berg H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6973-6977Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Strains containing CheY59NK, CheY59ND, and CheY59NE displayed rotational biases more CCW than wild type, with CheY59ND displaying the most extreme phenotype, with nearly exclusively CCW behavior and inability to swarm. In contrast, cells that contained CheY59NR or CheY59NH displayed extreme CW biases relative to wild-type strains. Transformation of plasmids carryingcheY59NR or cheY59NH into a CheA-deficient host resulted in fully CCW behavior (data not shown), indicating that the CW activity was dependent on CheY phosphorylation by CheA. Strong CW behavior could be due to an increased rate of phosphorylation or decreased rate of dephosphorylation, both of which would result in increased CheY-P levels or enhanced binding of CheY-P to the flagellar switch. Because we believed that any of these explanations would be informative as to the role of position 59 in CheY function, we chose to focus our biochemical studies on the basis for the CW behavior of the CheY59NR protein.Table IPhenotypes of K0641recA/pRBB40 strains containing CheY with substitutions at position 59Amino acid at position 59Swarm rate 1-aRatio of swarm rate to that of wild-type control.

Open table in a new tab To assess the phosphorylation, autodephosphorylation, and CheZ-dependent phosphorylation properties of CheY59NR (and CheY59NA and wild-type CheY for comparison), we used a commercially available enzyme-linked spectroscopic assay that continuously measures phosphate concentration. The steady state rate of release of phosphate for the reaction of CheY with MPI is a function of both the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation rates. The data in Fig.1 A for wild-type CheY show that as the concentration of MPI was increased, the rate of phosphate release increased and eventually saturated. The sensitivity of the Pi release rate to MPI concentrations indicates that the observed rate is at least partially dependent on the phosphorylation rate. Saturation occurs when autodephosphorylation becomes rate-limiting. That saturation is due to limiting autodephosphorylation is evident because a similar titration carried out in the presence of excess CheZ, which will greatly increase the dephosphorylation rate, gave higher phosphate release rates, which continued to increase well past 1 mm MPI (Fig. 1 A). The autodephosphorylation rate constant (kdephosph) can be estimated from the saturating rate by dividing the saturating rate by the concentration of CheY. This gives a kdephosph value of 0.035 s−1, which compares well with other determinations (36Silversmith R.E. Appleby J.L. Bourret R.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14965-14974Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 38Mayover T.L. Halkides C.J. Stewart R.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2259-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Similar titrations of CheY59NR and CheY59NA reveal several properties of the phosphorylation reactions for these proteins (Fig.1 B). First, the phosphate release rates for the three CheY proteins all saturate at similar rates, implying that these proteins have similar autodephosphorylation rate constants (kdephosph ∼ 0.030–0.040 s−1). This conclusion was confirmed by direct determination of autodephosphorylation rates by following the decomposition of [32P]CheY-P by gel electrophoresis and phosphorimaging analysis. This analysis gavekdephosph values of 0.036 ± .006 (1 S.D.) s−1 (wild-type CheY), 0.035 ± 0.0791;1 (CheY59NR), and 0.037 ± 0.008 s−1 (CheY59NA). Second, the shift of the titration curve to a lower MPI concentration for CheY59NR indicates that the phosphorylation rate at a given MPI concentration is faster for this mutant than for wild-type CheY. Similarly, the shift of the curve to the right for CheY59NA indicates slower autophosphorylation at a given MPI concentration. These conclusions were supported by fluorescence measurements of rates of CheY-P formation. With MPI as phosphodonor, the observed rate constant for accumulation of CheY-P (kobs) was more than 10-fold higher for CheY59NR compared with wild-type CheY, whereas the rate for CheY59NA was about 2-fold lower than wild-type CheY (TableII). Because the autodephosphorylation rates are similar for the proteins (above), these differences inkobs reflect differences in phosphorylation rates (kphosph/Ks). The accelerated phosphorylation rate for CheY59NR was also observed with PAM as phosphodonor, as CheY59NR had a kobsabout four times higher than wild-type CheY. However, with acetyl phosphate, CheY59NR had a slightly slower kobsthan wild-type CheY. Therefore the accelerated rate of phosphorylation for CheY59NR occurred only with the nitrogen-phosphorous phosphodonors. Possible mechanistic implications are discussed below.Table IIObserved rate constants for CheY phosphorylation with various phosphodonors measured by fluorescenceCheYkobsAcetyl phosphate (50 mm)PAM (50 mm)MPI (12.5 mm)s−1Wild type0.3350.6110.15359NR0.2332.552.0959NA0.0830.5850.070 Open table in a new tab Titrations of the phosphate release rate with CheZ were carried out at 3 mm MPI, a concentration where the phosphate release rates for all three proteins were predominantly limited by autodephosphorylation (Fig. 1 B). For wild-type CheY, the rate of phosphate release increased with CheZ and saturated by 150 nm, with 40–60 nm CheZ required for half saturation (Fig. 2). Saturation is expected when autophosphorylation becomes rate-limiting, and the rate at which saturation occurs should correlate with the phosphorylation rate. Like wild-type CheY, the phosphate release rate for CheY59NA increased throughout the 0–100 nm CheZ range but gave a lower saturation rate, implying a slower phosphorylation rate (Fig. 2 B), consistent with the results described above (Fig. 1 B, Table II). In contrast, CheY59NR demonstrated extreme CheZ resistance. There was no detectable change in phosphate release rate for CheZ concentrations up to 1 μm, showing that CheZ had no effect, either negative or positive, on the rate of dephosphorylation of CheY59NR. A CheZ concentration of 12 μm (the concentration of CheY was 3.3 μm) was required to increase the rate 68% relative to the rate in the absence of CheZ (data not shown). Saturation of the rate was not achieved and would be expected to occur at a rate much higher than that of wild-type CheY (Table II). Given the rate increase by the highest amount of CheZ, we estimate that CheY59NR requires a minimum of 250 times more CheZ to get the same rate enhancement as wild-type CheY and CheY59NA. The exceptional CheZ resistance of CheY59NR would result in high concentrations of CheY-P in the cell, thus accounting for the CW phenotype of cells containing this protein. Finally, for comparison, the CheZ sensitivity of a previously characterized CheZ-resistant mutant, CheY23ND (27Sanna M.G. Swanson R.V. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1069-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), was assessed using this assay. Asn23is a surface residue located on α helix 1, about 20 Å from the active site Asp57. CheY23ND required 800–1000 nm CheZ to reach half of the possible rate acceleration (Fig. 2 A), about 15–20 times more than wild-type CheY. This value is in reasonable agreement with a previous observation that CheY23ND required about 50-fold more CheZ than wild-type CheY for a similar rate acceleration (27Sanna M.G. Swanson R.V. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1069-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The biochemical basis for the extreme CheZ resistance of"

In addition to these mechanisms, a new source of structural diversity exists in C. jejuni, where the sialyltransferase Cst-II from the OH4384 strain has been shown to be bi-functional, using two different acceptor oligosaccharides and has been shown to be mono-functional in the 0:19 serostrain (17Gilbert M. Brisson J.R. Karwaski M.F. Michniewicz J. Cunningham A.M. Wu Y. Young N.M. Wakarchuk W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3896-3906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The existence of these different mechanisms of structural variation makes it impossible to predict the LOS structure based on the gene complement alone. The N. meningitidis α-2,3-sialyltransferase, Lst, has a relaxed acceptor specificity, being able to use synthetic acceptors that present terminal N-acetyllactosamine, lactose, or galactose (18Gilbert M. Watson D.C. Cunningham A.M. Jennings M.P. Young N.M. Wakarchuk W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28271-28276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Lst from N. meningitidisstrains MC58(L3) and 126E(L1) can also use a terminal α-d-galactose to make an α-2,3-sialyl-Pkepitope in vitro with a synthetic acceptor molecule (19Gilbert M. Cunningham A.M. Watson D.C. Martin A. Richards J.C. Wakarchuk W.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that the LOS of the N. meningitidis 126E(L1) was also sialylated but at the O6 position of the terminal α-d-galactose (1Wakarchuk W.W. Gilbert M. Martin A. Wu Y. Brisson J.R. Thibault P. Richards J.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, this structure has not been reported in any mammalian glycolipid (nor in any other LOS); hence, we cannot conclude that it is used as a form of molecular mimicry as is the case with the sialyllacto-N-neotetraose found in the strains with the L3 immunotype. The L1 immunotype has been isolated from disease outbreaks (20Griffiss J.M. Brandt B.L. Saunders N.B. Zollinger W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9716-9724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and therefore, this unique LOS structure may play a role in meningococcal disease. We therefore sought to determine the enzyme responsible for its biosynthesis. In this paper we demonstrate the that the Lst of 126E(L1) is also responsible for the addition of the Neu5Ac at O6 of the α-galactose in the 126E(L1) LOS. Additionally, the bi-functional nature of the enzyme from the 126E(L1) can be introduced into the mono-functional MC58(L3) enzyme by site-directed mutagenesis of a single residue. The following strains ofN. meningitidis were used: immunotype L1 strain 126E (NRCC 4010); immunotype L3 strain MC58 (NRCC 4728). The cloning vector pCW was used for expression of the lst genes and has been described previously (21Wakarchuk W.W. Campbell R.L. Sung W.L. Davoodi J. Yaguchi M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Plasmids were propagated inEscherichia coli strain AD202 (CGSC 7297). N. meningitidis 126E(L1) was grown and harvested, and the LOS was extracted by the hot phenol-water method as previously described (1Wakarchuk W.W. Gilbert M. Martin A. Wu Y. Brisson J.R. Thibault P. Richards J.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), except that the plates were supplemented with 25 μg/ml CMP-Neu5Ac. Small scale isolations were performed as described previously (22Li J. Thibault P. Martin A. Richards J.C. Wakarchuk W.W. van der Wilp W. J. Chromatogr. A. 1998; 817: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry of LOS was performed as previously described (1Wakarchuk W.W. Gilbert M. Martin A. Wu Y.

Chromatogr. A. 1998; 817: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Methylation analysis to determine linkage positions between residues was performed as previously described (1Wakarchuk W.W. Gilbert M. Martin A. Wu Y. Brisson J.R. Thibault P. Richards J.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For detection of activity in N. meningitidis strains, cells were scraped off freshly grown Columbia blood agar plates that had been supplemented with 25 μg of CMP-Neu5Ac/ml. The cell pellet was then extracted with 0.2% Triton X-100 in 20 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0. The cell-free extract was then assayed as previously described (19Gilbert M. Cunningham A.M. Watson D.C. Martin A. Richards J.C. Wakarchuk W.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) with acceptor molecules derived from aminophenylglycosides labeled either with FCHASE or FEX fluorophors. Analysis of all of the site-directed mutants was performed with a construct that contained only the transferase gene. The recombinant proteins were assayed in sonicated extracts. The thin layer chromatography conditions for separation of the α-2,3/2,6-sialylated Pk-FCHASE were: isopropanol,n-butyl alcohol, 0.1 m HCl (2:1:1) or ethyl acetate, methanol, water, acetic acid (4:2:1:0.1). High performance TLC plates (Whatman) were used for the separations. The construction of the allelic replacement was performed essentially as described previously (23Wakarchuk W. Martin A. Jennings M.P. Moxon E.R. Richards J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19166-19173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, the kanamycin resistance gene from pUC-4K was liberated from the plasmid as a SalI fragment. The 5′-upstream region and 3′-downstream regions of the α-2,3-sialyltransferase structural gene were amplified from N. meningitidis 126E(L1) by polymerase chain reaction with Pwo polymerase as described by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The primers for the 126E(L1) upstream-flanking sequence (5′ end) of the coding regions were: 5′-GGGGGGGAATTC CATATTTTGGCGGCTTTGTTCGCGC-3′ and 5′-GGCGGTGGGCATATGATCCCTAAAACTCCATTCCGACAAATTG-3′. The region is 355 base pairs. The primers for the L1 downstream-flanking sequence (3′ end) of the coding sequence were 5′-GGGGGGGTCGACTCGCATAGCAAATCAAAATAGAAAATGG-3′ and 5′-GGGGGGAAGCTTCCGCGCACTGCCCGCCGTTTGGTCGG-3′. The region is 350 base pairs. The coding sequence from MC58 L3 was amplified with the following primers: 5′-CTTAGGAGGTCATATGGGCTTGAAAAAGGCTTGTTTGACC-3′ and 5′-GGGGGGGTCGACTTAATTTTTATCGTCAAATGTCAAAATC-3′. The fragment was 1140 base pairs. The plasmid for the gene replacement was assembled in the following steps. pUC19 was digested withEcoRI and HindIII and purified for use as the cloning vector. A four-fragment ligation was performed with the 5′-flanking sequence of 126E(L1)-lst(EcoRI/NdeI-digested), the MC58(L3)-lst structural gene (NdeI/SalI-digested), the 3′-flanking sequence of 126E(L1)-lst (SalI/HindIII), and the pUC19 vector (EcoRI/HindIII). Once this construct was verified, we then inserted a KanR marker between the structural gene and the 3′- flanking sequence. The recombinant plasmids were introduced into N. meningitidis by electroporation. The gene disruption vector was constructed in a different fashion. The sialyltransferase gene (NdeI-SalI fragment as described above) was restricted with Sau3A-I to generate three fragments. The middle 22-base pair fragment was discarded. The two larger fragments were ligated with the kanamycin resistance marker that had been liberated from pUC-4K with BamHI. These fragments were then ligated into pUC19 which had been digested withEcoRI and SalI. These plasmids were then introduced into the N. meningitidis strain by electroporation. The MC58(L3)-lstallele was mutagenized using the U-DNA method of Kunkel (24Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4539) Google Scholar). All mutant genes were completely sequenced to ensure no other mutations were introduced. A crystal model 310 CE instrument (AYI Unicam, Madison, WI) was coupled to an API 3000 mass spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences/Sciex, Concord, Canada) via a microionspray interface. A sheath solution (isopropanol, methanol, 2:1) was delivered at a flow rate of 1 μl/min to a low dead volume tee (250 μm internal diameter, Chromatographic Specialties, Brockville, Canada). The separations were obtained on a 90-cm-length bare-fused silica capillary using 30 mm morpholine in deionized water, pH 9.0, containing 5% methanol. A voltage of 25 kV was typically applied for the separation. The outlet of the capillary was tapered to ∼15 μm internal diameter using a laser puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). Mass spectra were acquired with dwell times of 3.0 ms/step of 1 m/z unit in full-mass scan mode. 20 nl of sample was typically injected by using 150 mbar for a duration of 0.1 min. NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker AMX-600 and Varian INOVA 600 NMR spectrometers. Experiments on Pk-FCHASE compound were done using an inverse broadband detection probe at 27 °C with the mono-deuterated water resonance at 4.756 ppm. Experiments on α-2,6-sialyl-Pk-FCHASE compound were done using a 5-mm Z gradient triple resonance probe at 25 °C with the mono-deuterated water resonance at 4.774 ppm. NMR samples were prepared by dissolving 0.1–0.3 mg of material in 600 μl of D2O after freeze-drying. All NMR experiments were performed as previously described (17Gilbert M. Brisson J.R. Karwaski M.F. Michniewicz J. Cunningham A.M. Wu Y. Young N.M. Wakarchuk W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3896-3906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). For the proton chemical shift reference, the methyl resonance of internal or external acetone was set at 2.225 ppm (1H). For the 13C chemical shift reference, the methyl resonance of internal or external acetone was set at 31.07 ppm relative to external dioxane at 67.40 ppm. When we analyzed reactions performed with the 126E(L1)-Lst and the Pk-FCHASE acceptor, we noticed a second product peak (slightly faster migrating) in the CE electropherograms (Fig.2), which was sensitive to sialidase treatment (data not shown). This second product is only seen with Pk-FCHASE acceptor. The major product (∼90% of the product) had the same migration time as α-2,3-Neu5Ac-Pk-FCHASE that we had previously described (19Gilbert M. Cunningham A.M. Watson D.C. Martin A. Richards J.C. Wakarchuk W.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We were able to resolve these two products by TLC, but we could only see a second product in reactions performed with the 126E(L1)-Lst and not MC58(L3)-Lst. We were able to obtain enough of the unique secondary product using preparative TLC, and this material was subjected to analysis by NMR spectroscopy (see below). To assess the linkage specificity of the 126E(L1)-Lst, the unique product formed with Pk-FCHASE as an acceptor was analyzed by NMR spectroscopy on nanomole amounts. We have previously published the NMR spectrum for α-2,3-Neu5Ac-Pk made with the MC58(L3)-Lst (19Gilbert M. Cunningham A.M. Watson D.C. Martin A. Richards J.C. Wakarchuk W.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and we found the NMR spectrum of the major sialylated product made with 126E(L1)-Lst was identical to our previously published one. We present here only the spectra from a nonsialylated acceptor, Pk-FCHASE = compound I, and the unique product formed in a reaction with the 126E(L1)-Lst, α-2,6-sialyl-Pk-FEX = compound II. The comparison of these two spectra clearly shows the site of sialylation of the terminal α-galactose in the acceptor. At the time the preparative sialylation reaction was performed, we were using the FEX aglycon, but we have seen that during storage that the FCHASE aglycon is more stable. The nonsialylated Pk-FCHASE spectra was collected on material made at a later time. Both compounds were soluble and gave sharp resonances with line widths of a few Hz since the H-1 anomeric doublets (J1,2 = 4 and 8 Hz) are well resolved (data not shown). For compound I, the mono-deuterated water resonance was very broad and overlapped with one of the anomeric signals. In TableI, the proton assignments were obtained from standard homonuclear experiments, correlated spectroscopy (COSY), total correlation spectroscopy (TOSCY), nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY), one-dimensional NOESY, one-dimensional TOCSY, and the 13C assignments from a heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC) experiment, which detects C-H correlations (17Gilbert M.

The error is ±0.02 ppm for 1H chemical shifts and ±0.2 ppm for 13C chemical shifts. The linkage site on the aglycon was determined from a comparison of the13C chemical shifts of the enzymatic product with those of the precursor to determine glycosidation shifts, as done previously (17Gilbert M. Brisson J.R. Karwaski M.F. Michniewicz J. Cunningham A.M. Wu Y. Young N.M. Wakarchuk W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3896-3906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Although a different fluorescent tag was used, it only influenced the proton chemical shift of the Glc residue. For compound I, the proton and 13C chemical shifts were in accord with those reported for Gal-α1,4-Gal-β1,4-Glc-β-1-O-2-(trimethylsilyl)ethanol (25Gronberg G. Nilsson U. Bock K. Magnusson G. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 257: 35-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Compound II was identified as Neu5Ac-α2,6-Gal-α1,4-Gal-β1,4-Glc-β-1-FEX. From a comparison of the heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence spectra of compound I and II, it is obvious that the linkage site is at C-6 of αGal due to the large downfield shift of −2.6 ppm for αGal C-6 upon sialylation (Fig. 3). Large proton chemical shifts differences of 0.18 and −0.17 ppm were also observed for the H-6 and H-6′ resonances of αGal upon sialylation. An upfield shift of 1.3 ppm for the αGal C-5 was also observed (Table I), typical of 2–6 sialyloligosaccharides (26Sabesan S. Paulson J.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 2068-2080Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The 13C chemical shifts of compound II are similar to those reported for the NeuN-α2,6-Gal-α1,4-Gal-β1,4-Glc moiety present in the 126E(L1) LOS from N. meningitidis, except for the chemical shift of NeuN C-4, which is obviously wrong in the latter (1Wakarchuk W.W. Gilbert M. Martin A. Wu Y. Brisson J.R. Thibault P. Richards J.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In Table I and Fig. 3, the proton chemical shift differences for the Glc unit between compounds I and II are attributed to different fluorescent aglycons. A sequence comparison of the 126E(L1)-Lst (GenBankTM accession U60662) and MC58(L3)-Lst (GenBankTM accession U60660) proteins showed only 6 amino acid changes. We sequentially changed all of the residues in MC58(L3)-Lst that differed from 126E(L1)-Lst to the corresponding residue from 126E(L1)-Lst (E40D, R102W, S129A, G168I, T242A, K273N). Only the G168I mutation resulted in an enzyme with α-2,6-sialyltransferase activity. We then performed additional mutagenesis to put all possible amino acids at the position Gly-168 in MC58(L3)-Lst to determine whether other amino acids also permit the second enzyme activity. The results of these experiments were analyzed by first measuring the activity of the mutants on β-N-acetyllactosamine-FCHASE, the preferred acceptor for the MC58(L3)-Lst, to ensure the mutants were functional. Both Lst enzymes make only a single product, the α-2,3-linked Neu5Ac, with β-N-acetyllactosamine-FCHASE. Only one of the mutations resulted in an inactive enzyme, G168P, and this was not due to lack of protein production (data not shown). These mutants were then analyzed for activity on the Pk-FCHASE acceptor using equivalent amounts of enzyme as measured on the β-N-acetyllactosamine-FCHASE acceptor. Only a few of these had significant α-2,6-sialyltransferase activity, and these data is shown in Fig. 4. The mutants G168I and G168L showed levels of α-2,6-sialyltransferase activity equivalent to the 126E(L1)-Lst. The G168V mutant showed 40% of the α-2,6 activity level of 126E(L1)-Lst, and the G168M mutant showed 25% of the level of α-2,6 activity of 126E(L1)-Lst. We also noted that certain mutants were less active than the wild type on Pk-FCHASE in general but basically unaffected for activity on β-N-acetyllactosamine-FCHASE. These mutants were G168F, G168Y, and G168W, and using the standard assay described here, they showed a higher specificity for β-N-acetyllactosamine-FCHASE than they did for Pk -FCHASE. An insertional inactivation mutant of the lst gene was made in the 126E(L1) strain, and then the LOS was analyzed by mass spectrometry. When thelst gene has been inactivated, no Neu5Ac could be detected in the LOS (data not shown). The mutation should not cause any polar effects as the next gene downstream of lst, a cytochromec′ homologue, is transcribed in the opposite direction and is not involved in sialic acid metabolism (18Gilbert M. Watson D.C. Cunningham A.M. Jennings M.P. Young N.M. Wakarchuk W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28271-28276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To assess the bi-functional nature of the lst gene from 126E(L1) in vivo, we constructed isogenic mutants that contained either the MC58(L3)-derivedlst gene or the G168I mutation. After obtaining transformants, they were screened for sialyltransferase activity, and then the resident lst gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced to ensure the correct gene had been inserted. Both gene replacement mutants produced similar levels of sialyltransferase activity as measured with the in vitroassay on synthetic acceptors. The activity was similar to what we had seen in vitro; the MC58(L3)-derived enzyme did not make a significant amount of the α-2,6-linked Neu5Ac, whereas the G168I mutant showed the same ratio of α-2,3 to α-2,6 product (data not shown). LOS was prepared from these strains and was analyzed by CE-electrospray mass spectrometry (Fig.5). The level of Neu5Ac incorporation in the 126E(L1) mutant strain with the MC58(L3)-lst gene was very low, but certainly detectable. The level of Neu5Ac incorporation from the G168I mutant gene was comparable with the wild-type 126E(L1) strain. Methylation analysis of these LOS samples (TableII) showed 6-substituted Gal, indicating that the Neu5Ac in both cases was α-2,6-linked and that no α-2,3-linked Neu5Ac was present.Table IIMethylation analysis of LOSMethylated sugar (alditol acetate)L1 wild typeL3 replacementG168I replacement2,3,4,6-Me4-Gal0.420.620.552,3,6-Me3-Gal1.001.001.002,3,6-Me3-Glc1.190.600.712,3,4-Me3-Gal0.780.050.292,6,7-Me3-Hep0.460.220.274,6,7-Me3-Hep0.140.140.12Bold values indicate the level of Gal-substituted galactose in the various strains of LOS preparations.

The proteins involved in the addition of the sialic acid to the outer core oligosaccharide portion of the LOS from C. jejuni, H. influenzae, N. meningitidis, andN. gonorrhoeae have been identified (7Hood D.W.

These proteins have a variety of acceptor specificities, and only theC. jejuni and H. influenzae enzymes share some sequence identity with each other. No structure/function analysis for any of these enzymes has so far been reported. Since there is no conserved sequence in the group of enzymes as a whole, it has been difficult to predict which residues might be involved in donor/acceptor recognition or catalysis. Sialic acid transfer to the LOS of N. meningitidis species has been shown to be performed by the product of the lstgene (18Gilbert M. Watson D.C. Cunningham A.M. Jennings M.P. Young N.M. Wakarchuk W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28271-28276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The terminal oligosaccharide produced in most strains is a mimic of the human glycolipid oligosaccharide sialyllacto-N-neotetraose. An alternate sialylated LOS structure with the terminal oligosaccharide α-2,6-Neu5Ac-Pk has been shown to be produced in the 126E(L1) strain (1Wakarchuk W.W. Gilbert M. Martin A. Wu Y. Brisson J.R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 9716-9724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), but the enzyme for producing this novel α-2,6-sialylated structure was not reported. We have now determined the enzyme responsible for the addition of the α-2,6-linked Neu5Ac in the 126E(L1) strain and have shown it to be a bi-functional version of the Lst enzyme that previously had been shown to transfer the α-2,3-linked Neu5Ac in N. meningitidis MC58(L3) strain. The first reported multifunctional enzyme involved in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis was the 3-deoxy-α-d-mannooctulosonic acid (KDO) fromChlamydia pneumoniae, which adds KDO to the lipid A core through a α-2,6 linkage to GlcNAc and then in an α-2,4 linkage to the first KDO residue, and then in an α-2,8 linkage to the second KDO (27Lobau S. Mamat U. Brabetz W. Brade H. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Recently a bi-functional sialyltransferase from C. jejuni was described where the enzyme could also use two very different acceptors, namely a β-linked Gal or a α-2,3-linked Neu5Ac (17Gilbert M. Brisson J.R. Karwaski M.F. Michniewicz J. Cunningham A.M. Wu Y. Young N.M. Wakarchuk W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3896-3906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The sialyltransferase enzyme from the 126E(L1) strain of N. meningitidis described in this paper is also bi-functional but uses the same terminal sugar acceptor for the reaction and makes an alternate linkage (α-2, 6) in addition to the more usual α-2,3-linkage. This activity is also found only with terminal Gal residues that are in an α-linkage with the previous galactose residue. We have never seen any second (α-2,6) product formed duringin vitro reactions on β-linked galactose residues. We detected the α-2,6 product produced during in vitro enzyme reactions, but only about 10% of the synthetic Pk-FCHASE acceptor is converted to the α-2,6 linkage product, whereas the majority of the product formed in vitro is the α-2,3-sialyl-Pk structure. The MC58(L3)-Lst enzyme does produce detectable α-2,6-linked Neu5Ac, but the amount of α-2,6-linked Neu5Ac was about 45-fold less than was made by 126E(L1)-Lst, and this could only be seen using the ultra-sensitive laser-induced fluorescence detector on the CE. The isomeric α-2,3-sialyl-Pk structure has not been detected in vivo in the N. meningitidis 126E(L1) strain. The ability of the enzyme to make these two products in vitro may not be too surprising since side reactions are possible with a synthetic acceptor molecule, but what is most important to bear in mind is that in vivo, only the α-2,6-Neu5Ac linkage is formed in the 126E(L1) strain. In our examination of the enzyme, we were able to pinpoint a single residue in the MC58(L3)-Lst, Gly-168, which when mutated to Ile (the residue at position 168 in 126E(L1), permits the enzyme to form the same level of α-2,6-sialylated product either in vitro on the synthetic Pk acceptor orin vivo on the LOS. What was surprising, however, was the fact that in vivo the MC58(L3)-Lst could form a very small amount of sialylated LOS in the 126E(L1) strain and that this material was also α-2,6-linked. The amount of Neu5Ac in this 126E(L1) mutant (MC58(L3)-Lst) was too small to analyze by NMR, but methylation analysis showed around 6% of the wild type level of the 6-substituted Gal. This level of Neu5Ac incorporation is much higher than what was expected, given the 45-fold lower α-2,6-sialytransferase activity of the MC58(L3)-Lst enzyme measured in vitro. These data suggest that some factor in vivo completely blocks the O3 position of the terminal α-galactose and that something also must promote the formation of the α-2,6-linked product since this is the linkage formed exclusively in L1. At present we do not know if this factor is another protein that may bind either Lst or the LOS, the conformation of the LOS during biosynthesis, or another molecule present at the site of biosynthesis. Molecular modeling of the 126E(L1) LOS suggests the conformation of the terminal trisaccharide could produce a sterically hindered product where the O3 of the terminal α-Gal is effectively blocked by the phosphoethanolamine substituent on Hep-2 of the inner core. 2J. R. Brisson, unpublished data. Consequently the Lst variants with very low α-2,6 activity would be inactive in L1 strains when LgtC is functional. Since a relatively subtle change (Gly to Ile/Leu) results in the α-2,6-sialyltransferase activity, we speculate that the 126E(L1) strain maintained this version of Lst because it was advantageous for its survival in the human host, and as this oligosaccharide structure has not been described in man, it may or may not be molecular mimicry. We do not yet know if the specificity of the 126E(L1)-Lst is in all L1 immunotype strains. Data by Griffiss et al. (20Griffiss J.M. Brandt B.L. Saunders N.B. Zollinger W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9716-9724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) would suggest the structure we described in strain 126E(L1) and the lst gene variant occurs in other L1 immunotype strains. Our mutagenesis of position 168 in the MC58(L3)-Lst revealed that all amino acid side chains are tolerated there except for proline. Surprisingly, the activity level of all of the mutants was similar on the acceptor β-N-acetyllactosamine-FCHASE, except G168P, which was not active at all likely due to distortion of the enzyme active site. The mutants G168Y, G168F, and G168W maintained activity on β-N-acetyllactosamine-FCHASE but have very reduced activity on the Pk-FCHASE compared with the MC58(L3)-Lst or 126E(L1)-Lst. When this residue is Ile or Leu, it then directs the specificity of the reaction to allow the formation of the α-2,6 linkage as well as the 126E(L1)-Lst. The presence of the aromatic amino acid side chains reduced the activity of the enzyme toward the Pk-FCHASE acceptor significantly. With the CE-based assay, the overall activity of the G168W/G168F/G168Y mutants were 4–9-fold less active on this acceptor (data not shown), whereas their activity on β-N-acetyllactosamine-FCHASE appeared very similar to the wild type MC58(L3)-Lst protein. This suggests that the steric hindrance from the large inflexible ring containing side chains specifically block the enzyme from utilizing the α-linked terminal Gal residue. We postulate that the position 168 in this enzyme must be in a cavity that has enough space to accommodate both the α and β anomers of the terminal Gal. It will be essential to obtain structural information about this enzyme that will show us what the active site looks like to understand how these two different acceptor conformations are accommodated such that the product of the 126E(L1)-Lst reaction is α-2,6-linked Neu5Ac, whereas the MC58(L3)-Lst produces α-2,3-linked Neu5Ac. Other factors in the synthesis of the 126E(L1)-LOS influence the Neu5Ac linkage formation so it will also be important to identify what these are to fully understand the formation of this novel glycolipid structure.

It mediates myoblast migration on laminin-1 and -2 and thus might be involved in muscle development and repair. Previously we have shown that α7B as well as the α7A and -C splice variants induce cell motility on laminin when transfected into nonmotile HEK293 cells. In this study we have investigated the role of the cytoplasmic domain of α7 in the laminin-induced signal transduction of α7β1integrin regulating cell adhesion and migration. Deletion of the cytoplasmic domain did not affect assembly of the mutated α7Δcyt/β1 heterodimer on the cell surface or adhesion of α7Δcyt-transfected cells to laminin. The motility of these cells on the laminin-1/E8 fragment, however, was significantly reduced to the level of mock-transfected cells; lamellipodia formation and polarization of the cells were also impaired. Adhesion to the laminin-1/E8 fragment induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, and p130CAS as well as the formation of a p130CAS-Crk complex in wild-type α7B-transfected cells. In α7BΔcyt cells, however, the extent of p130CAS tyrosine formation was reduced and formation of the p130CAS-Crk complex was impaired, with unaltered levels of p130CAS and Crk protein levels. These findings indicate adhesion-dependent regulation of p130CAS/Crk complex formation by the cytoplasmic domain of α7B integrin after cell adhesion to laminin-1/E8 and imply α7B-controlled lamellipodia formation and cell migration through the p130CAS/Crk protein complex.

During muscle repair, undifferentiated muscle precursor cells, so-called satellite cells, are activated and migrate to sites of damaged muscle along the basement membranes of pre-existing muscle fibers to close the wound by proliferating and fusing (1Cossu G.

We deleted the cytoplasmic domain of α7 and transfected 293 cells with a construct encoding the extracellular splice variant X2 (α7X2Δcyt) to elucidate the role of the α7 cytoplasmic domain in terms of heterodimer formation, surface expression, integrin α7-mediated cell attachment, migration, and p130CAS/Crk coupling. Deletion of the α7 cytoplasmic domain did not affect receptor assembly or activity, as assessed by the ability of the mutant receptor to confer cell attachment. In contrast, cell migration, lamellipodia formation, and formation of the p130CAS signaling complex were reduced, highlighting a role for the α7 cytoplasmic domain in signal transduction.

Ends were filled with Klenow polymerase, and the plasmid was religated, which resulted in a stop codon after the residues Lys-Leu. Plasmid DNA was purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). 293HEK-EBNA cells were obtained from Invitrogen (Groningen, Netherlands) and cultured in DMEM/F-12 (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 5% fetal calf serum (FCS; S0215-Lot 264S, Biochrom, Berlin, Germany), 50 μg of streptomycin, and 50 units of Penicillin/ml (Life Technologies, Inc.), 250 μg/ml G418 (Calbiochem, Bad Soden, Germany). Cells were kept in a humidified atmosphere containing 7.5% CO2. For certain experiments, cells were serum-starved by washing twice in serum-free medium and keeping them in serum-free medium for 20 h. The medium was replaced with serum-free medium 2 h before experiments, and for block of protein biosynthesis cycloheximide was added at a concentration of 25 μm and applied for 2 h. Trypsin was stopped with 1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) and 1% BSA (Sigma) in DMEM/F-12 under these conditions. For transfection, 106 HEK293-EBNA cells were seeded on 60-mm dishes and grown for 16 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS and once with OptiMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were incubated with 600 μl of OptiMEM containing 10 μg of plasmid DNA and 15 μl of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 6 h and then additionally 3 ml of DMEM/F-12 were added for 16 h. Medium was changed after 48 h, and cells were selected and maintained in culture medium containing 300 μg/ml hygromycin B (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). FACS analysis was performed as described previously (37Echtermeyer F. Schöber S. Pöschl E. von der Mark H. von der Mark K. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were trypsinized, washed, and resuspended in FACS-PBS (5% FCS in PBS containing 0.02% sodium azide) (2 × 106 cells/ml). 2 × 105 cells were incubated with primary antibodies (GoH3, 2 μg/ml; TS2/16, 3C12, 5A6, and 6A11, hybridoma supernatant) for 30 min on ice. Cells were washed twice with FACS-PBS and incubated with FITC-labeled secondary antibodies (1:200) for 30 min on ice, washed twice with FACS-PBS and fixed in 1% p-formaldehyde in PBS. FACS analysis was performed with a Coulter cytometer. Flasks (25 cm2; Falcon) were coated with PBS-diluted PLL (20 μg/ml) or LN-1/E8 fragment (2 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C with a volume of 1.5 ml/25-cm2 flask. Flasks were washed twice with PBS and blocked with 1% heat-denatured (30 min; 80 °C) BSA (Sigma; A7030) in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C and again washed twice with PBS. Cells were trypsinized, washed, and plated at a density of 2000/cm2 in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)-buffered DMEM/F-12 containing antibiotics and 5% FCS. The flasks were allowed to equilibrate in a 7.5% CO2-containing atmosphere at 37 °C for 1 h, the lid was closed air-tight, and flasks were placed in a thermostatic chamber at 37 °C under a Zeiss ICM-405 microscope (Oberkochen, Germany). Migration was monitored by time-lapse video microscopy as described previously (37Echtermeyer F. Schöber S. Pöschl E. von der Mark H. von der Mark K. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were filmed under low illumination with a CCD camera (JVC) connected to a time lapse video recorder triggered by an external timer. Pictures were taken every 2 min, and cells were recorded for >12 h. For analysis of cell migration, a set of 12 pictures in 1 h steps was imported in the McDraw program and cells were tracked manually by connecting the centers of the cell bodies of individual cells. Tracks of cells were digitalized and converted to pixels, which were converted to micrometers after calibration. Cells were washed quickly three times with ice-cold PBS and fixed in 3.7%p-formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at 4 °C, washed three times in PBS and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min at room-temperature. Samples were again washed three times with PBS and blocked for 30 min at room temperature with 3% BSA in PBS. FITC-phalloidin was diluted 1:1000 in 3% BSA in PBS and applied for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were washed three times for 5 min in PBS, mounted, and examined with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with a 63× oil immersion objective (numeric aperture = 1.24). Cell lysis was performed in two ways, depending on the application. Cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and lysed with 1 ml of buffer/107 cells. Condition A (LN-1/E8 chromatography) consisted of 50 mm N-octylglucopyranoside, 300 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7,4, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), 1 mm PMSF (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; Merck). Condition B (coimmunoprecipitations) was 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm PMSF, 5 mm EDTA. Cells were scraped into ice-cold lysis buffer and allowed to lyse for 30 min on a shaking platform at 4 °C, and the lysate was spun down at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by Cu2+ complexation (Pierce). Samples were adjusted to equal protein concentrations with lysis buffer. For immunoprecipitations samples were adjusted to a volume of 1 ml with lysis buffer and precleared with equilibrated Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) for 30 min at 4 °C by rotation. After centrifugation appropriate antibodies were added to the supernatant, the mixture was rotated for 1 h, and 20–50 μl of equilibrated Protein-G-Sepharose were added for an additional 1 h. If not stated otherwise, antibodies were used at a concentration of 5 μg/mg of protein. Coimmunoprecipitations were performed the same way, but for 2 h. The immune complexes were retained by short pulse centrifugation, washed three times in lysis buffer (for condition A: lysis buffer containing 25 mm N-octylglucopyranoside), and finally boiled in 2× SDS sample buffer (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). If not otherwise indicated, SDS-PAGE was performed with 10% gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (0.2 μm, Schleicher & Schuell, Dassen, Germany) for 1.5 h at 1 mA/cm2 by semidry blotting and a discontinuous buffer system. Blots were stained with Ponceau S and blocked with 3% BSA in TBST (0.1% Tween 20, 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) for 1 h at room temperature. Antibodies were diluted in blocking solution, and incubated with the blot for 1 h at room temperature or for 16 h at 4 °C. Blots were washed four times for 10 min each with TBST, developed with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and chemiluminescence, and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 films (Eastman Co.). For stripping, blots were washed twice with distilled water, incubated two times for 10 min with 0.1 mglycine, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, pH 2.5, neutralized extensively with TBST, and blocked again. Cells were washed once in PBS containing 5 mm EDTA and released from plates with 5 mm EDTA in PBS. After washing three times with ice-cold PBS, pH 8.0, cells were adjusted to 25 × 106/ml and nonmembrane permeable NHS-LC-Sulfobiotin (Pierce) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Surface biotinylation was carried out for 30 min at room temperature on a shaking platform, and the reaction was stopped by three washes with ice-cold PBS, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. Cells were lysed under condition A. The LN-1/E8 fragment used throughout this study was a generous gift of Dr. Rainer Deutzmann (University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany). It was coupled to CNBr activated Sepharose CL 4-B according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which resulted in ∼1 mg of LN-1/E8 fragment/ml of Sepharose. For purification of recombinant integrin α7β1complexes from transfected 293 cells, LN-1/E8-Sepharose was equilibrated in lysis buffer A by three washes and 200 μl of a 1:3 suspension was added to surface-biotinylated cell extracts from 107 cells. The mixture was rotated for 4 h at 4 °C and washed three times in lysis buffer A containing 25 mm N-octylglucopyranoside by short centrifugation at 200 × g and resuspension in 1 ml of wash buffer. The recombinant protein complexes were eluted in a volume of 50 μl with 5 mm EDTA in 25 mm N-octylglucopyranoside, 300 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris/HCl pH 7,4, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm PMSF by vortexing and centrifugation at 200 × g. Eluted proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis and probed with streptavidin-peroxidase complex (1:5000, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)., LN-1/E8-Sepharose was recycled by repeated washes in 1 mNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4 and stored at 4 °C in TBS containing 0.1% sodium azide. Plates (96 wells; Nunc, Denmark) were coated with 100 μl of protein solution/well for 1 h at 37 °C with coating concentrations as indicated under “Results.” Plates were then washed twice with PBS and blocked with 1% heat-denatured (30 min; 80 °C) BSA (Sigma; 7030). Cells were trypsinized and washed either in DMEM containing 1% BSA and 1 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor under serum-free conditions or in DMEM containing 5% FCS and kept in suspension for 30 min. 5 × 105 cells were seeded per well and allowed to attach for 1 h at 37 °C. Plates were washed three times with PBS under standardized conditions with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay washer (M96V; Merlin, Rotterdam, Netherlands), and the amount of attached cells was determined by measurement of lysosomal hexosaminidase activity (42Landegren U. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 67: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Background attachment on BSA was subtracted, and the percentage of attached cells was calculated using serially diluted cells (1:3) as standard. For antibody attachment inhibition assays, cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml purified antibody on ice prior to distribution in wells. The antibody concentration was kept at 10 μg/ml throughout the assay. Attachment assays were performed with internal controls,e.g. nontransfected 293 cells. Sorting was performed over two rounds as described previously (38Schöber S. Mielenz D. Echtermeyer F. Hapke S. Pöschl E. von der Mark H. Moch H. von der Mark K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). α7-transfected cells were trypsinized shortly, washed with culture medium, and adjusted to 3.3 × 107 cells/ml in 3C12 hybridoma supernatant diluted 1:1 with PBS (corresponding to approximately 25 μg/ml specific anti-α7 antibody). The mixture was rocked at 4 °C for 30 min, and cells were washed twice with 4 ml of ice-cold culture medium. Cells were resuspended at a concentration of 108/ml in ice-cold culture medium. Sheep pan-anti-mouse coated magnetic beads (M-450; Dynal, Oslo, Norway) were washed three times in PBS containing 0.1% heat-denatured BSA, added to the cell suspension (1.3 × 108 beads/ml), and cells were rotated with the beads for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells bound to the beads were pulled out magnetically and washed three times with ice-cold medium. Cells were resuspended in warm culture medium, and beads were removed magnetically after trypsin treatment during passaging of the cells. 5 × 104 cells were plated on laminin-1/E8-coated 30-mm dishes, and three pictures of each plate were taken with a Zeiss Axiovert microscope (Kodak TMax 100 film) by a second individual blinded for the experimental condition. Films were developed, and quantitation of cell spreading was performed by calculating the percentage of spread versus total cells by a blinded, second person. Data were analyzed statistically with a two-tailed Student's t test. We reported previously that integrin α7X2B, 3Wild-type transfected cells are named 293α7X2B, and cells carrying the deletion are named 293α7X2Δcyt. α7X2A, and α7X2C induce cell migration specifically on laminin-1 and its E8 fragment (LN-1/E8) when expressed ectopically in nonmotile, integrin α7-negative 293HEK cells (38Schöber S.

To elucidate the role of the α7B cytoplasmic domain, a truncation mutant lacking the cytoplasmic domain except of the two first membrane-proximal residues (Lys-Leu)3 was constructed and transfected in HEK293-EBNA cells. Transfected 293α7X2B and 293α7X2Δcyt cells were magnetically sorted with anti-α7 mAb 3C12 for high surface expression levels (Fig. 1) and scanned by FACS analysis with two different anti-α7 mAbs, a nonblocking (3C12) as well as a blocking antibody (6A11). The wild-type and mutant cells were rather homogenous and displayed similar surface expression levels of integrin α7 (Fig.1 A and Table I), indicating that deletion of the cytoplasmic domain of integrin α7X2 does not interfere with cell surface presentation. 293α7X2Δcyt cells displayed reduced surface levels of integrin α6, thus behaving similarly to the wild-type receptor (37Echtermeyer F.

Immunoblot analysis confirmed deletion of the cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3,6, and 9) and demonstrated that the total α7 expression level was not reduced after deletion of the α7 cy"
https://openalex.org/W1665534701,"The amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC) in the intralobular duct cells of mouse mandibular glands are inhibited by the ubiquitin-protein ligase, Nedd4, which is activated by increased intracellular Na+. In this study we have used whole-cell patch clamp methods in mouse mandibular duct cells to investigate the role of the C termini of the α-, β-, and γ-subunits of ENaC in mediating this inhibition. We found that peptides corresponding to the C termini of the β- and γ-subunits, but not the α-subunit, inhibited the activity of the Na+ channels. This mechanism did not involve Nedd4 and probably resulted from the exogenous C termini interfering competitively with the protein-protein interactions that keep the channels active. In the case of the C terminus of mouse β-ENaC, the interacting motif included βSer631, βAsp632, and βSer633. In the C terminus of mouse γ-ENaC, it included γSer640. Once these motifs were deleted, we were able to use the C termini of β- and γ-ENaC to prevent Nedd4-mediated down-regulation of Na+ channel activity. The C terminus of the α-subunit, on the contrary, did not prevent Nedd4-mediated inhibition of the Na+ channels. We conclude that mouse Nedd4 interacts with the β- and γ-subunits of ENaC.

The binding of Nedd4 to the PY motifs in the Na+channel has also been proposed as a prerequisite for the insertion of the channels into the cell membrane in response to increased intracellular cyclic AMP (23Snyder P.M.

WW1, one of the three WW domains present in mouse Nedd4, does not bind any of the subunits of the epithelial Na+ channel (29Harvey K.F. Dinudom A. Komwatana P. Joliffe C.N. Day M.L. Parasivam G. Cook D.I. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12525-12530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and the same observation has been made for the WW1 domain of human Nedd4 (11Farr T.J. Coddrington-Lawson S.J. Snyder P.M. McDonald F.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 503-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given that all three subunits of the Na+ channel, α, β, and γ, contain PY motifs in their C termini, this finding raised the question of whether the remaining two WW domains in mouse Nedd4 bind all three subunits of the Na+ channel indiscriminately or whether they bind specifically to only two of them. The available information that might have resolved this question is contradictory. Thus, although no cases of Liddle's syndrome have been reported to be caused by the deletion or mutation of the PY motif in the α-subunit (4Hummler E. Horisberger J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G567-G571PubMed Google Scholar), deletion of the C terminus of the α-subunit does lead to increased ENaC activity in Xenopus oocytes (33Schild L. Lu Y. Gautschi I. Schneeberger E.

We investigated this question in mouse mandibular duct cells which, like the cells of other aldosterone-sensitive epithelia (34Cook D.I. Van Lennep E.W. Roberts M.L. Young J.A. Johnson L.

This amiloride-sensitive Na+ conductance is inhibited by increased intracellular Na+ acting via a Nedd4-mediated mechanism (14Dinudom A. Harvey K.F. Komwatana P. Young J.A. Kumar S. Cook D.I. Proc.

In the present study we used whole-cell patch clamp methods to examine whether the inclusion in the pipette solution of fusion proteins and synthetic peptides corresponding to the C termini of the α-, β-, and γ-subunits of the epithelial Na+ channel could prevent down-regulation of Na+ channel activity in mouse mandibular duct cells. We found that the C termini of β- and γ-ENaC, but not of α-ENaC, are able to prevent inhibition of Na+ channel activity by raised intracellular Na+. The regions encoding the C termini of human and mouse α-, β-, and γ-ENaC subunits were polymerase chain reaction-amplified and cloned into either BamHI orBamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-2TK. Mouse C terminus β-ENaC-10, mouse C terminus γ-ENaC-10, and mouse C terminus γ-ENaC-19 were polymerase chain reaction-amplified and cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pGEX-2TK. Human β-ENaC PPNA, human γ-ENaC S637G, and mouse γ-ENaC PPRA and S643G mutants were generated by quick-change mutagenesis (Stratagene). Mouse α-, β-, and γ-ENaC subunit cDNAs were cloned from mouse mandibular duct cells as previously described (29Harvey K.F. Dinudom A. Komwatana P. Joliffe C.N. Day M.L. Parasivam G. Cook D.I.

Human a-, β-, and γ-ENaC cDNA clones were the gift of Dr. M. Welsh (University of Iowa). Overnight cultures ofEscherichia coli DH5α harboring the appropriate GST expression plasmid were diluted 1/50, incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, and incubated for an additional 5 h at 37 °C. Bacterial cell pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, lysed by sonication, and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was incubated with the cleared lysate for 60 min at room temperature, after which the beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Fusion protein was eluted with glutathione buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein concentration was measured using a BCA kit (Pierce). Fusion proteins were routinely checked by electrophoresis of 3 μg of the protein on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, which was then stained by Coomassie Blue (data not shown). In accordance with our usual practice, for the protein concentrations quoted in this paper, compensation was made for the presence of contaminating proteins (29Harvey K.F. Dinudom A. Komwatana P.

Isolated granular duct cells were prepared by collagenase digestion of mouse mandibular glands from male mice as described previously (37Dinudom A. Komwatana P. Young J.A. Cook D.I. J. Physiol. ( London ). 1995; 487: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The standard bath solution (pH 7.4) contained 145 mm NaCl, 5.5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 7.5 mmHEPES, and 10 mm glucose. The standard (zero Na+) pipette solution (pH 7.2) contained 150 mmNMDG-glutamate, 5 mm NMDG-Cl, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm glucose. In the 70 mm Na+pipette solution, the Na+ concentration was adjusted by substituting sodium glutamate for NMDG-glutamate. Standard whole-cell patch clamp techniques were used (37Dinudom A. Komwatana P. Young J.A. Cook D.I. J. Physiol. ( London ). 1995; 487: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 38Dinudom A. Young J.A. Cook D.I. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1993; 423: 164-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After establishing the whole-cell configuration, we replaced the bath solution with one containing 145 mm sodium glutamate, 5 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4). The amiloride-sensitive current was measured as described previously (37Dinudom A. Komwatana P. Young J.A. Cook D.I. J. Physiol. ( London ). 1995; 487: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,38Dinudom A. Young J.A. Cook D.I. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1993; 423: 164-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The chord conductance was measured between −80 mV and the zero-current potential of the amiloride-sensitive current (37Dinudom A. Komwatana P. Young J.A. Cook D.I. J. Physiol. ( London ). 1995; 487: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed using Student's unpaired t test. All experiments were performed at 20–22 °C. Pertussis toxin was stored as a 111 μg/ml stock solution. It was activated prior to use by incubation with 5 mm dithiothreitol for 15 min at 35 °C. It was then diluted to 500 ng/ml in pipette solution to which 1 mmnicotinamide adenine nucleotide had been added. Prior to examining the effect of the C-terminal fusion proteins (Fig. 1) on Na+feedback inhibition of the Na+ channels, we checked whether they affected Na+ channel activity when the Na+ feedback system is inactive. We did so by including 300 μg of each GST fusion protein ml in the zero Na+ pipette solution and then observing the effect of the fusion protein on the amiloride-sensitive Na+ current. To our surprise, we found that both the fusion protein containing the C terminus of human β-ENaC and that containing the C terminus of mouse γ-ENaC inhibited the amiloride-sensitive Na+ current (Fig. 2). The fusion protein containing the C terminus of mouse α-ENaC, however, did not have this effect (Fig. 2).Figure 2The C termini of β- and γ-ENaC inhibit the amiloride-sensitive Na+ conductance. This figure shows the effects on the chord conductance of the amiloride-sensitive Na+ current of including in the zero Na+ pipette solution the GST fusion proteins of the C termini of α-, β-, or γ-ENaC at a concentration of 300 μg/ml. The number of experiments is shown inparentheses.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We first investigated the basis of the inhibitory activity of the C terminus of β-ENaC. We found that a fusion protein containing the C terminus of human β-ENaC, in which the PY motif (PPNY) had been mutated (PPNA) so that it no longer interacted with Nedd4 (29Harvey K.F. Dinudom A. Komwatana P. Joliffe C.N. Day M.L. Parasivam G. Cook D.I. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12525-12530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), was still inhibitory (Fig.3). Furthermore, inclusion of the C terminus of mouse β-ENaC in the pipette solution together with a dominant negative mutant of ubiquitin (K48R), which we have previously shown to block inhibition of Na+ channels by increased intracellular Na+ in these cells (14Dinudom A. Harvey K.F. Komwatana P. Young J.A. Kumar S. Cook D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7169-7173Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), failed to prevent the inhibition produced by the C terminus of mouse β-ENaC. Because inclusion of the K48R mutant of ubiquitin in zero Na+pipette solution is not itself inhibitory (14Dinudom A. Harvey K.F. Komwatana P. Young J.A. Kumar S. Cook D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7169-7173Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we concluded that the inhibition produced by the C terminus β-ENaC does not involve ubiquitination of the Na+ channel. Deletion of 10 amino acids from the C terminus of the mouse β-ENaC fusion protein, however, prevented the inhibitory effect of the fusion protein (Fig.3), suggesting that the inhibitory motif is present in the last 10 amino acids of the β-subunit. We confirmed these findings by using synthetic peptides corresponding to the final 10 amino acids of mouse β-ENaC (Fig.4 A). We found that the inclusion of 20 μm βC10 peptide in the zero Na+ pipette solution inhibited the amiloride-sensitive Na+ current almost completely (Fig. 4 B). We then investigated whether the action of the peptide was mediated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, because these are known to inhibit amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels (37Dinudom A. Komwatana P. Young J.A. Cook D.I. J. Physiol. ( London ). 1995; 487: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 39Berdiev B.K. Shlyonsky V.G. Senyk O. Keeton D. Guo Y. Matalon S. Cantiello H.F. Prat A.G. Ausiello D.A. Ismailov I.I. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1262-C1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found, however, that the inclusion of activated pertussis toxin in the peptide solution did not prevent its inhibitory action on the Na+channel (Fig. 4 B). Finally, we investigated the effects of peptides based on βC10 in which residues that may have been involved in the inhibitory motif were substituted by glycine (Fig.4 C). Initially we examined two peptides in which we had made double substitutions. One of these, βE636G/I638G, in which we replaced the glutamate and isoleucine residues at positions 8 and 10 of the peptide (Fig. 4 A) to target a possible PDZ-binding domain at the C terminus (40Schepens J. Cuppen E. Wieringa B. Hendriks W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), retained its inhibitory activity (Fig.4 C). The other peptide, βD632G/S633G (Fig. 4 A), was without inhibitory activity (Fig. 4 C). We further found that the inhibitory effect of the βC10 peptide was completely abolished by substituting glycine for the serine residues at positions 3 (peptide βS631G in Fig. 4 A) or 5 (peptide βS633G in Fig. 4 A). Substituting glycine for the aspartate residue at position 4 (βD632G in Fig. 4 A), which lies between the two serine residues, reduced (p < 0.05), but did not abolish (p < 0.05) the inhibitory action of the peptide (Fig. 4 C). We then investigated the basis of the inhibitory action of the C terminus of mouse γ-ENaC. We found that mutation of the PY motif of mouse γ-ENaC (PPRA) did not alter the inhibitory activity of the fusion protein (Fig. 5), indicating that the inhibition was not caused by activation of the feedback inhibitory system mediated by Nedd4. In contrast to our findings with the C terminus of mouse β-ENaC, deletion of the terminal 10 amino acids of mouse γ-ENaC did not remove the inhibitory effect of this fusion protein on the Na+ channel (Fig. 5). Only when we removed 19 amino acids from the C terminus of mouse γ-ENaC did the fusion protein cease to inhibit the amiloride-sensitive Na+current (Fig. 5). The experiments with GST fusion proteins suggested that the region between 10 and 19 residues from the C terminus of mouse γ-ENaC contained the inhibitory motif. We therefore investigated whether a chemically synthesized peptide corresponding to this region (γmC9 in Fig.6 A) was inhibitory when included in the zero Na+ pipette solution, and we found that it was (Fig. 6 B). Substituting the three serine residues (γSer640, γSer643, and γSer644) in this peptide by glycines (γSer → Gly) removed this inhibitory activity (γS-G in Fig.6 B). We then found that a peptide in which Ser640 was substituted by glycine (γS640G in Fig. 6 A) was without inhibitory activity (Fig. 6 B), whereas a peptide in which serines 643 and 644 are replaced by glycines (γS643G/S644G in Fig. 6 A) was still inhibitory (Fig. 6 B). Thus, serine 640 is required for the inhibitory activity of the C terminus of mouse γ-ENaC. Serine 640 in mouse γ-ENaC is not present in human γ-ENaC where it is replaced by an arginine residue (Fig.7 A). We thus expected that a GST fusion protein corresponding to the C terminus of human γ-ENaC would not be inhibitory when included in the zero Na+pipette solution (Fig. 7 A). We found, however, that it did inhibit the amiloride-sensitive Na+ current (Fig.7 B). We thus investigated the effect of mutating the sole serine in the C terminus of human γ-ENaC to glycine (γhS637G). We found that this mutant no longer inhibited the amiloride-sensitive Na+ current when included in zero Na+ pipette solution (Fig. 7 B). Mutation of this serine in the C terminus of mouse γ-ENaC, however, did not remove the inhibitory activity of the C terminus of mouse γ-ENaC (Fig. 7 B). This was consistent with our earlier findings using chemically synthesized peptides (see above and Fig. 6 B). As outlined in the Introduction, we wished to determine whether mouse Nedd4 interacts with all three subunits of the epithelial Na+ channel or just two of them. We decided to do this by investigating whether inclusion in the patch pipette of GST fusion proteins of the C termini of α-ENaC, β-ENaC, or γ-ENaC (Fig. 1) could block the inactivation of Na+ channels induced by raised intracellular Na+, which in mouse mandibular duct cells is known to be mediated by Nedd4 (14Dinudom A. Harvey K.F. Komwatana P. Young J.A. Kumar S. Cook D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7169-7173Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). This experimental strategy was based on the idea that Nedd4 in salivary duct cells would bind exogenous PY motifs, which would then prevent its normal interaction with, and inhibition of, Na+ channels. We tested this idea by examining whether a synthetic peptide that included the PY motif of β-ENaC (Fig.8 A) could block inhibition of the Na+ channels by increased intracellular Na+. As is evident from Fig. 8 B, it does so with a half-maximal concentration of 0.3 μm. We then proceeded to investigate whether the ENaC C termini interrupted control of the Na+ channels by intracellular Na+. We found that we could prevent the inhibitory action of the 70 mm Na+ pipette solution by including in it the C terminus of mouse β-ENaC with the last 10 amino acids deleted (Fig. 9). To confirm that this effect was due to the PY motif in this construct, we also investigated the effect of this construct following mutation of the tyrosine in the PY motif to an alanine residue (βmENaC-10 PY-mut). We have previously shown that this mutation eliminates the binding of the C terminus of mouse β-ENaC to Nedd4 (29Harvey K.F. Dinudom A. Komwatana P. Joliffe C.N. Day M.L. Parasivam G. Cook D.I. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12525-12530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We found that the mutant construct no longer prevented feedback inhibition of the amiloride-sensitive Na+ current (Fig. 9). We also found that the C terminus of mouse γ-ENaC with the last 19 amino acids deleted prevented the inhibition of the amiloride-sensitive Na+ current by raised intracellular Na+ (Fig.9). Once again, mutation of the construct by substitution of the tyrosine in the PY motif by alanine to eliminate its capacity to bind Nedd4 (29Harvey K.F. Dinudom A. Komwatana P. Joliffe C.N. Day M.L. Parasivam G. Cook D.I. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12525-12530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) rendered the fusion protein incapable of preventing Na+ feedback inhibition (Fig. 9). Finally, inclusion of the C terminus of mouse α-ENaC in the 70 mmNa+ pipette solution failed to prevent the down-regulation of the amiloride-sensitive Na+ current (Fig. 9). This study has shown that peptides and fusion proteins containing the PY motifs of β- and γ-ENaC prevent inhibition by increased intracellular Na+ of the amiloride-sensitive Na+ current in mouse mandibular duct cells. Na+-feedback inhibition of Na+ channels in mouse mandibular duct cells has previously been shown to be blocked by: (i) antibodies directed against mouse Nedd4, (ii) a mutant of mouse Nedd4 containing the WW domains but no HECT (ubiquitin-protein ligase) domain, and (iii) a dominant negative mutant of ubiquitin (14Dinudom A. Harvey K.F. Komwatana P. Young J.A. Kumar S. Cook D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7169-7173Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 29Harvey K.F. Dinudom A. Komwatana P. Joliffe C.N. Day M.L. Parasivam G. Cook D.I. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12525-12530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), indicating that the Na+ feedback inhibition is mediated by Nedd4, which is expressed in these cells (14Dinudom A. Harvey K.F. Komwatana P. Young J.A. Kumar S. Cook D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7169-7173Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus, the present findings show that the interaction of mouse Nedd4 with amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels can be blocked by PY motifs derived from the β- and γ-subunits of ENaC. Presumably these act by competing with the PY motifs in the native β- and γ-subunits of ENaC, thus preventing the normal interaction of Nedd4 with the Na+ channels. On the other hand, we found that the C terminus of α-ENaC was unable to block Na+ feedback regulation of the amiloride-sensitive Na+ current. This fusion protein is evidently unable to compete with the endogenous Na+ channels for binding of Nedd4. Given that the α-subunits of rat, human, and mouse ENaC have all been shown to bind Nedd4 in vitro (11Farr T.J. Coddrington-Lawson S.J. Snyder P.M. McDonald F.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 503-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Staub O. Dho S. Henry P.C. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 29Harvey K.F. Dinudom A. Komwatana P. Joliffe C.N. Day M.L. Parasivam G. Cook D.I. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12525-12530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), this indicates that in vivo there must be some constraint on the interaction of the PY motif of the α-subunit of the channel with Nedd4. Consistent with this possibility is the report that the C terminus of α-ENaC is bound to α-spectrin in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (41Rotin D. Bar-Sagi D. O'Brodovich H. Merilainen J. Lehto P.V. Canessa C.M. Rossier B.C. Downey G.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4440-4450Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The binding of α-spectrin is mediated by an SH3 (Src homology 3)-binding domain that overlaps the PY motif in α-ENaC (Fig. 1) and is not present in β- or γ-ENaC. As explained in the Introduction, the WW1 domains of mouse and human Nedd4 do not bind any of the subunits of ENaC (11Farr T.J. Coddrington-Lawson S.J. Snyder P.M. McDonald F.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 503-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Harvey K.F. Dinudom A. Komwatana P. Joliffe C.N. Day M.L. Parasivam G. Cook D.I. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12525-12530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the case of mouse Nedd4, which has only three WW domains, this raises the question of whether WW2 and WW3 bind to all three subunits of the Na+ channel or to only a subset of them. The present results demonstrate that WW2 and WW3 bind only to the β- and γ-subunits of the channel in vivo. Given that we have previously shown that the sites recognized by WW2 and WW3 in ENaCs from mouse salivary cells are distinct and are able to distinguish between WW2 and WW3 (29Harvey K.F. Dinudom A. Komwatana P. Joliffe C.N. Day M.L. Parasivam G. Cook D.I. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12525-12530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), it would thus appear likely that the WW2 of Nedd4 binds β-ENaC and the WW3 of Nedd4 binds γ-ENaC or vice versa. From the present data we cannot distinguish these possibilities. The other major finding of our study is that the exogenous C termini of both the β- and γ-subunits of the Na+ channel inhibit Na+ channel activity. As argued below, this probably occurs because the exogenous C termini compete with the Na+channels to interact with a protein, perhaps a kinase, that is required to maintain channel activity. In the case of the C terminus of mouse β-ENaC, this motif is located in the final 10 amino acids and requires the presence of both of the serine residues present in this peptide, βSer631 and βSer633, as well as the aspartate residue between them, βAsp632. In the case of the C terminus of mouse γ-ENaC, the motif is in the region between 10 and 19 residues from the C terminus, and requires the presence of only one of the three serine residues present in this region, γSer640. We further found that the C terminus of human γ-ENaC inhibits the amiloride-sensitive Na+current. This inhibition requires the presence of the serine γSer637, the only serine present in the C terminus of human γ-ENaC. Interestingly, the corresponding serine in mouse γ-ENaC is not involved in inhibiting the amiloride-sensitive Na+ current (Fig. 7). Consistent with our present findings, it has been reported previously that deletion of the C-terminal 8 amino acids of β-ENaC increases Na+ channel activity in Xenopus oocytes (21Snyder P.M. Price M.P. McDonald F.J. Adams C.M. Volk K.A. Zeiher B.G. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 969-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), although a subsequent study in which the final 10 amino acids were deleted from β-ENaC failed to observe any stimulation (33Schild L. Lu Y. Gautschi I. Schneeberger E. Lifton R.P. Rossier B.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2381-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that the constitutively activated Na+channels obtained from lymphocytes of subjects with Liddle's syndrome can be blocked by the application of peptides that include the final 10 amino acids of the C terminus of β-ENaC (42Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Fuller C.M. Bradford A.L. Lifton R.P. Warnock D.G. Bubien J.K. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C214-C223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This inhibition was attributed to the marked negative charge of the terminal decapeptide of β-ENaC, because a peptide in which the four negatively charged residues found in it had been substituted by uncharged residues was inactive (42Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Fuller C.M. Bradford A.L. Lifton R.P. Warnock D.G. Bubien J.K. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C214-C223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The four negative charges mutated in the lymphocyte studies included, however, βAsp632, which we have shown in the present study to be required for the inhibitory activity of the C terminus of β-ENaC. Furthermore, we have found that mutation of βGlu636 to an uncharged residue does not impair the inhibitory activity of the C-terminal peptide of β-ENaC (42Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Fuller C.M. Bradford A.L. Lifton R.P. Warnock D.G. Bubien J.K. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C214-C223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which the C termini of the β- and γ-C subunits inhibit the Na+ channels is unclear. For the C termini of both β-ENaC and γ-ENaC, we can exclude any role for binding of Nedd4. In the case of β-ENaC, we can also exclude any role for ubiquitination or pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins, which are known to inhibit Na+ channels in these and other cell types (14Dinudom A. Harvey K.F. Komwatana P. Young J.A. Kumar S. Cook D.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7169-7173Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 37Dinudom A. Komwatana P. Young J.A. Cook D.I.

Ismailov I.I. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1262-C1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the small size of the inhibitory regions of the C termini make it unlikely that they are forming a β-pleated sheet and hence blocking the channel pore (43Ismailov I.I. Shlyonsky V.G. Serpersu E.H. Fuller C.M. Cheung H.C. Muccio D. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 354-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Given the requirement for the presence of serine residues in the C termini of both β-ENaC and γ-ENaC and the report that these regions are constititutively phosphorylated in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (44Shimkets R.A. Lifton R. Canessa C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3301-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), it is tempting to postulate that the addition of exogenous β-ENaC or γ-ENaC C termini to the cytosol may be interfering in the phosphorylation processes required to maintain the channels in an active state. Consistent with this possibility is the observation that the C terminus of α-ENaC, which in the present studies is without inhibitory activity, is not phosphorylated in vivo (44Shimkets R.A. Lifton R. Canessa C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3301-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W1568036471,"Δ3,5,Δ2,4-Dienoyl-CoA isomerase (DI), an auxiliary enzyme of unsaturated fatty acid β-oxidation, was purified from rat mitochondria and peroxisomes and subjected to N-terminal sequencing to facilitate a mechanistic study of this enzyme. The mature mitochondrial DI from rat heart was lacking its 34 N-terminal amino acid residues that have the properties of a mitochondrial targeting sequence. The peroxisomal isomerase was identified as a product of the same gene with a truncated and ragged N terminus. Expression of the cDNA coding for the mature mitochondrial DI in Escherichia coli yielded an enzyme preparation that was as active as the native DI. Because the recombinant DI also exhibited Δ3,5,7,Δ2,4,6-trienoyl-CoA isomerase (TI) activity, both isomerases reside on the same protein. Mutations of any of the 3 acidic amino acid residues located at the active site (Modis, Y., Filppula, S. A., Novikov, D. K., Norledge, B., Hiltunen, J. K., and Wierenga, R. K. (1998) Structure 6, 957–970) caused activity losses. In contrast to only a 10-fold decrease in activity upon replacement of Asp176 by Ala, substitutions of Asp204 by Asn and of Glu196 by Gln resulted in 105-fold lower activities. Such activity losses are consistent with the direct involvement of these latter two residues in the proposed proton transfers at carbons 2 and 6 or 8 of the substrates. Probing of the wild-type and mutants forms of the enzyme with 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA as substrate revealed low Δ2,Δ3-enoyl-CoA isomerase and Δ5,Δ4-enoyl-CoA isomerase activities catalyzed by Glu196 and Asp204, respectively. Altogether, these data reveal that positional isomerizations of the diene and triene are facilitated by simultaneous proton transfers involving Glu196 and Asp204, whereas each residue alone can catalyze, albeit less efficiently, a monoene isomerization. Δ3,5,Δ2,4-Dienoyl-CoA isomerase (DI), an auxiliary enzyme of unsaturated fatty acid β-oxidation, was purified from rat mitochondria and peroxisomes and subjected to N-terminal sequencing to facilitate a mechanistic study of this enzyme. The mature mitochondrial DI from rat heart was lacking its 34 N-terminal amino acid residues that have the properties of a mitochondrial targeting sequence. The peroxisomal isomerase was identified as a product of the same gene with a truncated and ragged N terminus. Expression of the cDNA coding for the mature mitochondrial DI in Escherichia coli yielded an enzyme preparation that was as active as the native DI. Because the recombinant DI also exhibited Δ3,5,7,Δ2,4,6-trienoyl-CoA isomerase (TI) activity, both isomerases reside on the same protein. Mutations of any of the 3 acidic amino acid residues located at the active site (Modis, Y., Filppula, S. A., Novikov, D. K., Norledge, B., Hiltunen, J. K., and Wierenga, R. K. (1998) Structure 6, 957–970) caused activity losses. In contrast to only a 10-fold decrease in activity upon replacement of Asp176 by Ala, substitutions of Asp204 by Asn and of Glu196 by Gln resulted in 105-fold lower activities. Such activity losses are consistent with the direct involvement of these latter two residues in the proposed proton transfers at carbons 2 and 6 or 8 of the substrates. Probing of the wild-type and mutants forms of the enzyme with 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA as substrate revealed low Δ2,Δ3-enoyl-CoA isomerase and Δ5,Δ4-enoyl-CoA isomerase activities catalyzed by Glu196 and Asp204, respectively. Altogether, these data reveal that positional isomerizations of the diene and triene are facilitated by simultaneous proton transfers involving Glu196 and Asp204, whereas each residue alone can catalyze, albeit less efficiently, a monoene isomerization. The degradation of unsaturated fatty acids by β-oxidation requires several auxiliary enzymes in addition to the enzymes necessary for the breakdown of saturated fatty acids (for a review see Ref. 1Kunau W.-H. Dommes V. Schulz H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 267-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). One of the auxiliary enzymes is Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase (dienoyl-CoA isomerase),1which catalyzes the isomerization of 3,5-dienoyl-CoA to 2,4-dienoyl-CoA (2Smeland T.E. Nada M. Cuebas D. Schulz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6673-6677Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 3Luo M.J. Smeland T.E. Shoukry K. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2384-2388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During the β-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids with odd-numbered double bonds, 5-enoyl-CoA intermediates can be converted to 3,5-dienoyl-CoA by the sequential actions of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase (EC 5.3.3.8) (enoyl-CoA isomerase). The further degradation of 3,5-dienoyl-CoA requires its isomerization to 2,4-dienoyl-CoA, because the latter compound can be reduced by 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase (EC 1.3.1.34) to 3-enoyl-CoA. The isomerization of 3-enoyl-CoA to 2-enoyl-CoA by enoyl-CoA isomerase completes the reductase-dependent sequence of reactions during the β-oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids with odd-numbered double bonds. Dienoyl-CoA isomerase was first identified in rat liver mitochondria but later was also detected in rat liver peroxisomes (4Luthria D.L. Baykousheva S.P. Sprecher H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13771-13776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 5He X.-Y. Shoukry K. Chu C. Yang J. Sprecher H. Schulz H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The molecular characterization of this enzyme revealed the amino acid sequence of the unprocessed subunit, which has a peroxisomal targeting signal, type 1, at the C terminus and an N-terminal sequence that is consistent with the targeting of this protein to mitochondria (6Filppula S.A. Yagi A.I. Kilpeläinen S.H. Novikov D. FitzPatrick D.R. Vihinen M. Valle D. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 349-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This situation is suggestive of a dual subcellular localization and agrees with the previously observed kinetic and immunological similarities of the mitochondrial and peroxisomal forms of this enzyme (5He X.-Y. Shoukry K. Chu C. Yang J. Sprecher H. Schulz H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of a recombinant form of dienoyl-CoA isomerase consisting of subunits without the 53 N-terminal amino acid residues was obtained at 1.5-Å resolution (7Modis Y. Filppula S.A. Novikov D.K. Norledge B. Hiltunen J.K. Wierenga R.K. Structure. 1998; 6: 957-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This study confirmed the proposed hexameric structure of the enzyme (6Filppula S.A. Yagi A.I. Kilpeläinen S.H. Novikov D. FitzPatrick D.R. Vihinen M. Valle D. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 349-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and revealed the active site as a deeply buried hydrophobic pocket with three acidic residues, Asp176, Glu196, and Asp204. The latter two of these residues were predicted to catalyze proton transfers at carbons 2 and 6, respectively, of the 3,5-dienoyl-CoA substrate (6Filppula S.A. Yagi A.I. Kilpeläinen S.H. Novikov D.

Surprisingly, Δ3,5,7,Δ2,4,6-trienoyl-CoA isomerase (trienoyl-CoA isomerase), an enzyme involved in the degradation of unsaturated fatty acids with conjugated double bonds, was found to be a component enzyme of dienoyl-CoA isomerase (8Liang X. Zhu D. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13830-13835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The association of dienoyl-CoA isomerase and trienoyl-CoA isomerase with the same protein prompted this study aimed at elucidating the mechanisms of action of these enzymes. This goal necessitated the characterization of the highly active, mature forms of these enzymes present in mitochondria and peroxisomes. A PCR Advantage kit and a Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit were purchased fromCLONTECH. PGEM-T Easy was obtained from Promega. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. Restriction endonucleases, T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 ligase, and T4 DNA polymerase were supplied by New England BioLabs. Nycodenz, CoASH, NADPH, Polybuffer Exchanger 94, cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose, and most standard biochemicals were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. Hydroxylapatite, the dye reagent for protein assays, Sequi-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, 4–20% polyacrylamide ready gels, and the materials for immunoblotting, including the goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase, were bought from Bio-Rad. Rabbit antiserum against dienoyl-CoA isomerase was raised by Pocono Rabbit Farms and Laboratory, Canadensis, PA. Monospecific antibodies to dienoyl-CoA isomerase were prepared from antiserum by affinity chromatography using a Sepharose-dienoyl-CoA isomerase column prepared from recombinant dienoyl-CoA isomerase and cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose. Male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats from Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY were fed rodent chow containing 2% (w/w) di(ethylhexyl)phthalate for at least 2 weeks before use. 3,5-cis-Octadienoyl-CoA and 2,5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA were prepared as described by Shoukry et al. (9Shoukry K. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6892-6899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 3,5,7-Decatrienoyl-CoA was prepared as described by Liang et al. (8Liang X. Zhu D. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13830-13835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Contaminating 2,5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA and 2,5,7-decatrienoyl-CoA in preparations of 3,5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA and 3,5,7-decatrienoyl-CoA, respectively, were removed by HPLC. Preparations of 2,5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA and 2,5,7-decatrienoyl-CoA were purified by HPLC after converting residual amounts of 3,5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA and 3,5,7-decatrienoyl-CoA to their 2,4 and 2,4,6 isomers, respectively, in the presence of dienoyl-CoA/trienoyl-CoA isomerase. All isomerases were assayed spectrophotometrically with 20 μm substrate in 0.2m potassium phosphate at pH 8. The isomerase activities that were measured are indicated hereafter together with the substrates, wavelengths, and extinction coefficients of the assays: Δ3,5,Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerase, 3,5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA, 300 nm, 27,800m−1 cm−1; Δ3,5,7,Δ2,4,6-trienoyl-CoA isomerase, 3,5,7-decatrienoyl-CoA, 337 nm, 49,300 m−1cm−1; Δ2,5,Δ2,4-enoyl-CoA isomerase, 2,5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA, 300 nm, 27,800m−1 cm−1; Δ2,5,Δ3,5-enoyl-CoA isomerase, 2,5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA, 237 nm, 16,250m−1 cm−1; Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase, 3-cis-octenoyl-CoA, 263 nm, 6,700m−1 cm−1. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 1 μmol of substrate to product in 1 min. Kinetic parameters (Km and Vmax) were obtained by nonlinear curve fitting using SigmaPlot 2000. Protein concentrations were determined as described by Bradford (10Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Dienoyl-CoA isomerases from rat liver and heart were purified as described previously (3Luo M.J. Smeland T.E. Shoukry K. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2384-2388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adult Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were used, which had been fed rodent chow containing 2% (w/w) di(ethylhexyl)phthalate. For the purification of rat liver peroxisomal dienoyl-CoA isomerase, a light mitochondrial fraction was prepared from two rat livers as described by de Duve et al. (11DeDuve C. Pressman B.C. Gianetto R. Wattiaux R. Appelmans F. Biochem. J. 1995; 60: 604-617Crossref Scopus (2544) Google Scholar). Peroxisomes were prepared by Nycodenz density gradient centrifugation of a light mitochondrial fraction as described previously (5He X.-Y. Shoukry K. Chu C. Yang J. Sprecher H. Schulz H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For this purpose, a 30% (w/v) solution of Nycodenz containing 1 mmEDTA, 5 mm Hepes (pH 7.3), and 0.1% ethanol was prepared, and 21 ml of this solution was placed in a 30-ml ultracentrifuge tube on top of 1.5 ml of a 60% sucrose cushion. A density gradient was generated by centrifugation at 60,000 × g in a T865 small angle rotor on a DuPont RC70 ultracentrifuge at 4 °C for 24 h. A light mitochondrial fraction (∼45 mg of protein in 1.5 ml) was layered on top of the gradient followed by 1.5 ml of a cover solution of a 3-fold diluted isolation buffer containing 0.25m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% ethanol, and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The sample was centrifuged at 76,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Fractions of 2.5 ml each were collected from the bottom of the tube. Peroxisomes, microsomes, and mitochondria were localized by assaying the marker enzymes catalase, esterase, and malate dehydrogenase, respectively. Peroxisomal fractions were combined and diluted 5-fold with isolation buffer before they were harvested by centrifugation at 17,500 ×g for 20 min. Pellets were suspended in 2 ml of 5 mm potassium Pi (pH 6.3) containing 5 mm mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.5 mm PMSF (buffer A). The suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h after sonicating it 10 times for 20 s each at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a hydroxylapaptite column (1.5 × 22 cm) previously equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A containing 0.5 m KCl and then was developed with a gradient made up of 160 ml of buffer A and 160 ml of buffer A containing 0.8 m potassium Pi (pH 6.3). Fractions of 3 ml each were collected, and the fractions containing the dienoyl-CoA isomerase activity were combined and concentrated in an Amicon concentrator with a YM-10 membrane. After dialysis overnight against 25 mm ethanolamine-acetic acid (pH 9.4) containing 5 mm mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 20% glycerol (buffer B), the sample was applied to a chromatofocusing column (1 × 15 cm) containing Polybuffer Exchanger 94 equilibrated with buffer B. The column was extensively washed with buffer B and then developed with 12 column volumes of Polybuffer 96 adjusted to pH 6.0 with acetic acid. Fractions of 3 ml each were collected and assayed for dienoyl-CoA isomerase. The active fractions were combined and concentrated with a Millipore centrifugal filter device. Aliquots of purified dienoyl-CoA isomerase were treated with SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE on gradient (4–20%) gels (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by semi-dry blotting (13Bjerrum O.J. Schafer-Nielson C. Dunn M.J. Electrophoresis '86. VCH Publishers, Deerfield, FL1986: 315-327Google Scholar), and proteins remaining on the gel were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. The membrane was incubated for 1 h with a 500-fold-diluted rabbit antiserum or with monospecific antibodies (1 μg/ml) prepared from the serum raised against rat liver dienoyl-CoA isomerase. After incubating the membrane with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with alkaline phosphatase, it was developed with a staining mixture containing the alkaline phosphatase substrate until the antigen bands were visualized (14Blake M.S. Johnston K.H. Russell-Jones G.J. Gotschlich E.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar). N-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed by Stephen Bobin at the Dartmouth College Molecular Biology Core Facility. The N-terminal sequence of the full-length dienoyl-CoA isomerase was analyzed with the program HelicalWheel to draw a helical wheel as described previously (15Schiffer M. Edmondson B.A. Biophys. J. 1967; 7: 121-135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). Rat heart Marathon-Ready cDNA (CLONTECH) was used as the template for cloning the cDNA of the full-length dienoyl-CoA isomerase by touch-down PCR according to the protocol ofCLONTECH. The primers were 5′-CAGGATCCCATATGGCTACCGCGATGACAGTTTCCA-3′ and 5′-CAGTAAGCTTATCAGAGCTTGGAGAAGGTGATGCTT-3′. The PCR product (∼1 kb) was inserted into vector pGEM-T Easy (Promega) and amplified. Thereafter, it was subcloned into theBamHI-HindIII site of vector pND-1 (a gift from Dr. Didier Negre) to form expression plasmid pNDDI. This plasmid was used to transform Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS by the method of Chung et al. (16Chung C.T. Niemcla S.L. Miller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2172-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). Because attempts to express the full-length dienoyl-CoA isomerase were unsuccessful, the cDNA of the mature dienoyl-CoA isomerase was generated from plasmid pNDDI by PCR using primer 5′-CAGGATCCCATATGAGCTCCTCTGCACAAGAGGCGT-3′ for introducing a starting methionine followed by three serines and a 3′ primer 5′-CAGTAAGCTTATCAGAGCTTGGAGAAGGTGATGCTT-3′. BamHI andHindIII restriction sites were introduced with the 5′ primer and 3′ primer, respectively. The PCR product was subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector and transformed into E. coli JM109 as described by the manufacturer. The plasmid pGEM with the insert was isolated from transformants and digested with BamHI andHindIII. The DNA fragments corresponding to the dienoyl-CoA isomerase was obtained by GeneClean and ligated into expression vector pND-1. The expression construct, designated as pNDdi, was used to transform E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS. The transformants were grown in LB medium to an absorbance of about 1.0 at 600 nm and then induced by 0.6 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 5 min and stored at −80 °C. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by use of a Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH) following the manufacturer's instruction. A synthetic oligonucleotide, 5′-ATGCTTCAATAAGATTGAAAAAGGAAG-3′, designed to eliminate aSspI site, was used as the selection primer. The following synthetic oligonucleotides were used as the mutagenic primers. The substituting nucleotide is underlined, and the mutant codon is in boldface: Asp176 → Ala, 5′-GGAGGCGTGGCTCTTATTTCTG-3′; Asp176 → Asn, 5′-GGAGGCGTGAATCTTATTTCTG-3′; Glu196 → Ala, 5′-CCAAGTCAAGGCGGTGGATGTG-3; Glu196 → Asp, 5′-CCAAGTCAAGGATGTGGATGTGG-3′; Glu196 → Gln, 5′-CCAAGTCAAGCAGGTGGATGTG-3′; Asp204 → Ala, 5′-CTGGCTGCTGCTGTAGGAACGCTG-3′; Asp204 → Asn, 5′-CTGGCTGCTAATGTAGGAACGC-3′. The selection primer and one of the mutagenic primers were simultaneously annealed to the template of the denatured double-stranded pNDdi and then incorporated into a new strand of DNA as a result of the elongation catalyzed by T4 DNA polymerase. After digestion with SspI, the mixture of parent and newly synthesized DNA was transformed into E. coli BMH 71-18mutS. The plasmids were isolated from the transformants and digested again with SspI. The digestion mixture was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS, and the desired mutant was selected for the absence of the SspI restriction site. The point mutation was confirmed by sequencing of the respective mutant strain. Expression of the mutant enzymes was achieved by the procedure used for expressing the wild-type dienoyl-CoA isomerase. The frozen pellet from ∼350 ml of cell culture was suspended in 10 ml of 10 mm potassium Pi (pH 8.8) containing 5 mm mercaptoethanol, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.5 mm PMSF (buffer A) and sonicated 12 times for 20 s each. The resultant suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (1.5 × 17 cm) previously equilibrated with buffer A. The column was extensively washed with buffer A and then eluted with a gradient made up of 120 ml of buffer A and 120 ml of buffer A containing 0.4 m KCl. The active fractions were combined and concentrated in an Amicon concentrator with a PX-10 membrane. The concentrate was diluted 10-fold with 10 mm potassium Pi (pH 6.0) containing 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm mercaptoethanol, and 20% glycerol (buffer B) and applied to an S-Sepharose column (1.5 × 4 cm) previously equilibrated with buffer B. After washing extensively with buffer B, the column was developed with a gradient made up of 30 ml of buffer B and 30 ml of buffer B containing 0.4 m KCl. The active fractions were combined and concentrated. Far-UV CD scans were acquired between 190 and 250 nm with an AVIV CD spectrophotometer equipped with temperature control. Two average scans were acquired at 20 °C for each sample. The scans were normalized for protein concentration and corrected for the influence of the buffer. For a planned mechanistic study of rat dienoyl-CoA isomerase, milligram quantities of highly active enzyme were required. Although a recombinant form of this enzyme, lacking its 53 N-terminal amino acid residues, has been described (6Filppula S.A. Yagi A.I. Kilpeläinen S.H. Novikov D. FitzPatrick D.R. Vihinen M. Valle D. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 349-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), its activity was much lower than that of the native enzyme and too low for the contemplated mechanistic study. Attempts to express the full-length isomerase-cDNA were unsuccessful. Hence, we embarked on the molecular characterization of the native mitochondrial and peroxisomal dienoyl-CoA isomerases with the aim of producing a recombinant form of the highly active mature enzyme. N-terminal sequencing of the purified rat liver dienoyl-CoA isomerase revealed the presence of several polypeptides in agreement with the observation of at least three closely spaced bands when the same preparation was subjected to SDS-PAGE (Fig.1A, lanes 2 and5). Because this preparation may have been a mixture of the mitochondrial and peroxisomal forms of dienoyl-CoA isomerase, the enzyme was also purified from rat hearts, which contain few peroxisomes. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting of the heart preparation led to the identification of the dienoyl-CoA isomerase, which seemed to be slightly larger than the liver forms of the enzyme (Fig. 1,A and B, lanes 2 and 3). When the heart dienoyl-CoA isomerase was subjected to N-terminal sequencing, a unique sequence was obtained for the first 20 residues (Fig. 2A). The sequence, beginning with 3 serine residues, perfectly matched the predicted amino acid sequence of rat liver dienoyl-CoA isomerase (6Filppula S.A. Yagi A.I. Kilpeläinen S.H. Novikov D. FitzPatrick D.R. Vihinen M. Valle D. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 349-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) from residue 35 through residue 54. The missing residues 1 through 34 constitute a polypeptide that has the properties of a mitochondrial targeting sequence (Fig. 2B). This conclusion is supported by the following properties of this polypeptide: It is rich in positively charged and hydroxylated residues (3 arginine, 1 lysine, 4 serine, and 3 threonine residues), and it is devoid of acidic residues and does not have a large stretch of uncharged residues (Fig. 2B). Moreover, its N terminus forms a positively charged amphiphilic helix (Fig. 2B). The mitochondrial precursor protein seems to have only one cleavage site. Another potential cleavage site that is indicated by a hydrophilic residue and a serine at positions 27 and 30, respectively, is not susceptible to proteolysis, due to the absence of an arginine residue from position 25.Figure 2N-terminal sequences of mature rat dienoyl-CoA isomerases and sequence of the mitochondrial targeting peptide.A, N-terminal sequences of rat heart mitochondrial dienoyl-CoA isomerase and of two forms of rat liver peroxisomal dienoyl-CoA isomerases.

A better than 80-fold purification was achieved by chromatography on hydroxylapatite followed by chromatofocusing. The resultant preparation was composed of at least three proteins (Fig. 1A, lane 4). The major component with a molecular mass of 32 kDa was identified by immunoblotting as dienoyl-CoA isomerase (Fig. 1B, lane 4). N-terminal sequencing of the material corresponding to the 32-kDa band revealed the presence of several forms of dienoyl-CoA isomerase with different N termini. The N termini of the two most prominent polypeptides were located to positions 37 and 39 of the full-length protein (Fig. 2A). In an attempt to determine whether the peroxisomal dienoyl-CoA isomerase exists in vivoas a truncated protein, purified peroxisomes were incubated with boiling SDS incubation buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with antibodies purified by affinity chromatography on a dienoyl-CoA isomerase-Sepharose column. As shown in Fig. 1C, only one band corresponding to a 32-kDa protein was observed. Thus, it seems that the native peroxisomal dienoyl-CoA isomerase is a truncated protein with a ragged N terminus. The cDNA coding for dienoyl-CoA isomerase was cloned from a rat liver cDNA library by PCR. However, attempts to express the full-length protein in E. coli were unsuccessful. We therefore generated the cDNA for the mature rat heart isomerase from the full-length cDNA by PCR. This mature mitochondrial form of dienoyl-CoA isomerase was successfully expressed in E. coli. A 10-fold purification of dienoyl-CoA isomerase, beginning with a soluble extract of such cells, yielded the pure enzyme in 65% yield. This enzyme preparation exhibited an activity of 960 units/mg (Table I), which is significantly higher than the activity of the enzyme isolated from rat liver (3Luo M.J. Smeland T.E. Shoukry K. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2384-2388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that the recombinant dienoyl-CoA isomerase also exhibited trienoyl-CoA isomerase activity, proved that both catalytic properties are associated with the same protein.Table IActivities of wild-type and mutant dienoyl-CoA isomerasesMutantIsomerase activities3,5→2,43,5,7→2,4,62,5→2,42,5→3,5Specific1-aSpecific activities in μmol/min/mg of protein were obtained with 20 μmsubstrate as described under “Experimental Procedures.”RelativeSpecific1-aSpecific activities in μmol/min/mg of protein were obtained with 20 μmsubstrate as described under “Experimental Procedures.”RelativeSpecific1-aSpecific activities in μmol/min/mg of protein were obtained with 20 μmsubstrate as described under “Experimental Procedures.”RelativeSpecific1-aSpecific activities in μmol/min/mg of protein were obtained with 20 μmsubstrate as described under “Experimental Procedures.”WT96012110.0371D176A980.10.0331.6 × 10−30.0561.5E196D323.3 × 10−20.125.7 × 10−30.113E196Q0.00656.8 × 10−60.00029.6 × 10−60.4111D204A0.0181.9 × 10−50.00029.6 × 10−60.00540.150.40D204N0.00384.0 × 10−60.00031.4 × 10−50.00070.0190.101-a Specific activities in μmol/min/mg of protein were obtained with 20 μmsubstrate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab For the planned mechanistic study, mutant proteins were needed with Asp204, Glu196, and Asp176 replaced by uncharged amino acid residues. The mutations shown in Table I were introduced by site-specific mutagenesis, and the recombinant mutant proteins were purified to apparent or near homogeneity as indicated by SDS-PAGE (results not shown). The near-UV CD spectra of all mutant proteins were virtually indistinguishable from the spectrum of the wild-type enzyme (data not shown). When assayed for 3,5→2,4 dienoyl-CoA isomerase activity, the replacement of either Asp204 or Glu196 by a neutral amino acid residue resulted in an ∼105-fold lower activity (TableI). This observation agrees with the proposed functions of these two residues in the direct proton transfer to or from the substrate (7Modis Y. Filppula S.A. Novikov D.K. Norledge B. Hiltunen J.K. Wierenga R.K. Structure. 1998; 6: 957-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Substitution of Glu196 by an aspartate residue produced a mutant enzyme that retained ∼3% of the isomerase activity (Table I). This lower but significant activity demonstrates that the β-carboxyl group of Asp196 can facilitate the proton transfer although less efficiently than the γ-carboxyl group of Glu196. The mutation of the third acidic group at the active site, Asp176, to Ala caused a 10-fold decrease in activity. The limited effect of this mutation argues against a direct participation of this residue in catalysis. The effects of mutating Asp204, Glu196, and Asp176 on the trienoyl-CoA isomerase activity of this enzyme were comparable to the impact on the dienoyl-CoA isomerase except that the activity losses due to the D176A and E196D mutations were more severe (Table I). Overall these data indicates that the active site of dienoyl-CoA isomerase is identical with the active site of trienoyl-CoA isomerase and that the same acidic residues, Glu196 and Asp204, catalyze the proton transfers that result in the 3,5→2,4 and 3,5,7→2,4,6 isomerizations. In an effort to further explore the mechanism of dienoyl-CoA/trienoyl-CoA isomerase, its activity with 2-trans,5-cis-octadienoyl-CoA as a substrate was evaluated. With the wild-type enzyme, a small but significant conversion of the 2,5 diene to the 2,4 isomer was observed (Table I). The rate of the 2,5→2,4 conversion was more than 104times slower than the 3,5 →2,4 isomerization. Surprisingly, mutants of Glu196 were more active than the wild-type enzyme in catalyzing this reaction (Table I). The E196Q mutant, which was 10 times as active as the wild-type isomerase, permitted a spectroscopic analysis of the 2,5→2,4 isomerization. The time-dependent spectral changes shown in Fig.3B are indicative of a direct 2,5→2,4 isomerization rather than a sequential 2,5→3,5→2,4 conversion. These spectra do not provide evidence for the formation of a 3,5 intermediate with an absorbance maximum at 238 nm nor do they reveal a 3,5→2,4 isomerization as shown in Fig. 3A. Because the 2,5→2,4 conversion catalyzed by the E196Q mutant was 60 times faster than the 3,5→2,4 isomerization catalyzed by the same enzyme (Table I), the 2,5→2,4 isomerization seems to be a one-step conversion. The Asp204 mutants also catalyzed a slow but detectable 2,5→2,4 isomerization. However, as shown in Fig.4C, the formation of the 2,4 isomer proceeded with a lag. Spectral analyses of the reactions that occurred during (Fig. 4C, period A) and after the lag phase (Fig. 4C, period B) revealed an initial 2,5→3,5 isomerization indicated by an increase in the absorbance at 238 nm due to the formation of the 3,5 diene (Fig. 4A) followed by the formation of the 2,4 isomer detected at 300 nm (Fig.4B). Overall, the product formation occurred by a 2,5→3,5→2,4 conversion that showed a pronounced lag in the formation of the 2,4 isomer, because the first reaction proceeded faster than the second reaction (Table I). Because the D204A mutant catalyzed the 2,5→3,5 conversion, it was expected to catalyze also the isomerization of 3-octenoyl-CoA to 2-octenoyl-CoA. This conversion was in fact observed and found to take place at a rate of 0.034 unit/mg as compared with 0.4 unit/mg for the 2,5→3,5 isomerization. The question of whether the differences between the reaction rates observed with various mutants and substrates were due to changes inKm values, Vmax values, or both were addressed. The kinetic parameters listed in TableII clearly show that theKm values varied little and that differences betweenVmax values were the major cause of rate differences observed at fixed substrate concentrations of 20 μm.Table IIKinetic parameters of wild-type and mutant dienoyl-CoA isomerasesMutantIsomerase activities3,5→2,43,5,7→2,4,62,5→2,4Km2-aKm andVmax values are given in μm and μmol/min/mg of protein, respectively.Vmax2-aKm andVmax values are given in μm and μmol/min/mg of protein, respectively.Km2-aKm andVmax values are given in μm and μmol/min/mg of protein, respectively.Vmax2-aKm andVmax values are given in μm and μmol/min/mg of protein, respectively.Km2-aKm andVmax values are given in μm and μmol/min/mg of protein, respectively.Vmax2-aKm andVmax values are given in μm and μmol/min/mg of protein, respectively.WT3024501348D176A21278E196D2151E196Q371.22-a Km andVmax values are given in μm and μmol/min/mg of protein, respectively. Open table in a new tab The main reason for the molecular characterization of the mature dienoyl-CoA isomerases was the need to produce a highly active recombinant form of this enzyme. Such enzyme had not been obtained when recombinant versions of the full-length protein and of an artificially truncated isomerase were generated (6Filppula S.A. Yagi A.I. Kilpeläinen S.H. Novikov D. FitzPatrick D.R. Vihinen M. Valle D. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 349-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, this study was also prompted by a desire to demonstrate unambiguously the dual location of this enzyme in mitochondria and peroxisomes. The presence of the same dienoyl-CoA isomerase in both organelles had been suspected when antibodies raised against the mitochondrial enzyme were found to cross-react with the peroxisomal isomerase (5He X.-Y. Shoukry K. Chu C. Yang J. Sprecher H. Schulz H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 15-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cloning of dienoyl-CoA isomerase had revealed the presence of a peroxisomal targeting signal and an N terminus with properties of mitochondrial targeting sequence. Moreover, antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C terminus of the enzyme recognized 32-kDa and 36-kDa proteins in mitochondria and peroxisomes, respectively (6Filppula S.A. Yagi A.I. Kilpeläinen S.H. Novikov D. FitzPatrick D.R. Vihinen M. Valle D. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 349-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This study, besides revealing the N termini of the mature forms of dienoyl-CoA isomerase, confirms the dual localization of the enzyme to mitochondria and peroxisomes. However, in contrast to a previous report (6Filppula S.A. Yagi A.I. Kilpeläinen S.H. Novikov D. FitzPatrick D.R. Vihinen M. Valle D. Hiltunen J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 349-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the peroxisomal dienoyl-CoA isomerase was found to have a molecular mass of 32 kDa and hence to be a truncated form of the full-length protein. The removal of N-terminal sequences similar in size to the mitochondrial targeting sequence could be a consequence of the susceptibility of this region of the protein to proteolysis. This idea has not been tested nor have other explanations been ruled out. However, the detection of only one band corresponding to a 32-kDa protein when intact peroxisomes were solubilized with boiling SDS incubation buffer and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, supports the conclusion that the truncated form(s) of the peroxisomal dienoyl-CoA isomerase is(are) present in vivo and are not artifacts of the isolation procedure. This study additionally demonstrates that the heart and liver enzymes are identical over a stretch of 20 amino acid residues. Hence, both enzymes are most likely products of the same gene. The successful expression of the mature cardiac dienoyl-CoA isomerase in E. coli achieved two goals. Foremost, a highly active form of this enzyme became available. In fact, the maximal specific activity of 2450 units/mg for the recombinant isomerase was 6 times higher than the Vmax of the enzyme isolated from rat liver (3Luo M.J. Smeland T.E. Shoukry K. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2384-2388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although this difference may be due in part to the use of HPLC-purified substrate in this study, it also reflects the preparation of a purer enzyme. In any case, the recombinant enzyme exhibited an activity well suited for the planned mechanistic study. The second achievement was the demonstration that both dienoyl-CoA isomerase and trienoyl-CoA isomerase are associated with the same protein. This result puts to rest any existing suspicion that the two activities may be expressions of distinct but similar proteins. The successful creation and purification of several mutant forms of dienoyl-CoA isomerase permitted an analysis of its catalytic mechanism. Dramatic activity decreases were observed as the result of replacing Asp204 and Glu196 with neutral amino acids. This finding supports the proposed function of these residues in proton transfers from and to the substrate (7Modis Y. Filppula S.A. Novikov D.K. Norledge B. Hiltunen J.K. Wierenga R.K. Structure. 1998; 6: 957-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), because it agrees with the general prediction that the mutation of a residue that directly participates in a reaction as a general acid/base would be expected to cause a 105 or greater decrease in activity (17Meloche H.P. O'Connell E.L. J. Protein Chem. 1983; 2: 399-410Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The use of 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA as a substrate analog revealed slow, but measurable 2,5→2,4 isomerizations. Because the different positional isomers of octadienoyl-CoA have distinct UV spectra, it was possible to analyze the mechanisms of these isomerizations. The spectral changes observed with mutant E196Q were suggestive of a direct 2,5→2,4 isomerization without the formation of an intermediate. The only alternative route, via a sequence of isomerizations with 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA as an intermediate, was ruled out because the 3,5→2,4 isomerization was much slower than the overall 2,5→2,4 isomerization. Hence the observed 2,5→2,4 isomerization must be the result of a 5→4 double-bond shift as shown in Fig.5. Asp204 is the obvious candidate to facilitate this monoene isomerization by catalyzing a 1,3-proton shift from carbon 4 to carbon 6. Such mechanism for single double-bond isomerizations has been proposed for cholesterol oxidase (18Kass I.J. Sampson N.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 688-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase (19Fillgrove K.L. Anderson V.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7001-7011Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) based on observed intramolecular 1,3-hydrogen shifts. If mechanistically similar, the 1,3-proton shift catalyzed by Asp204 may not be concerted, as shown in Fig. 5, but rather proceed in two steps by removal of a proton from carbon 4 and formation of a stabilized carbanion followed by addition of a proton to carbon 6. Noteworthy is the observation that the 2,5→2,4 isomerization catalyzed by mutant E196Q proceeded 11 times faster than the same reaction catalyzed by the wild-type isomerase. The lower rate detected with the wild-type enzyme may be due to a higher pK value of Asp204 induced by Glu196. Such electrostatic effect on Asp204 would not be effective in the E196Q mutant. The 2,5→2,4 isomerization catalyzed by mutant D204A was more complex than the conversion brought about by the E196Q mutant. The progress curve for the D204A-catalyzed 2,5→2,4 isomerization showed a lag that was shown to correspond to the conversion of 2,5-octadienoyl-CoA to its 3,5 isomer. Because the 2,5→3,5 isomerization was faster than the subsequent 3,5→2,4 isomerization, the 3,5 intermediate accumulated and initially was detectable. The formation of 3,5-octadienoyl-CoA was the result of a double-bond shift from carbon 2 to carbon 3. This double-bond isomerization must have been catalyzed by Glu196, which is proposed to facilitate a 1,3-proton shift from carbon 4 to carbon 2 (Fig. 5). Again, the proton transfers may not be concerted as shown in Fig. 5 but may be sequential, resulting in the formation of a carbanion intermediate. An alternative route with a carbocationic intermediate represents an unlikely mechanism. The analyses of the 2,5→2,4 isomerizations provide good evidence for Glu196 being close to carbon 2 and Asp204 close to carbon 6 as shown in Fig.6. Both residues are necessary for the 3,5→2,4 isomerization that proceeds by a simultaneous shift of both double bonds (3Luo M.J. Smeland T.E. Shoukry K. Schulz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2384-2388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar mechanism is envisioned for the triene isomerization except that Asp204 must be close to carbon 8 (Fig. 6). Such a dual role of Asp204 suggests a certain flexibility of the residue and/or requires different positioning of the dienoyl-CoA and trienoyl-CoA substrates at the active site. Either way, the function of Asp204 in the isomerization of the triene comes at a price that is reflected by the almost 50-fold lower activity of trienoyl-CoA isomerase as compared with dienoyl-CoA isomerase. Altogether, this study demonstrates the need for two acidic residues to facilitate the proton transfers that result in positional isomerizations of dienes and trienes. In contrast, proton transfers that cause monoenes to shift by one carbon only require a single acidic residue as previously documented for other isomerases (18Kass I.J. Sampson N.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 688-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 19Fillgrove K.L. Anderson V.E.

The abundant polypeptides that assist the maintenance of the DNA structure and its conformational transitions in bacteria are generically termed nucleoid-associated proteins. This somewhat vague term includes, in the case of Escherichia coli, factors such as HU, H-NS, StpA, Lrp (leucine-responsive protein), Fis, and the integration host factor IHF (3Drlica K. Rouvière-Yaniv J. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 301-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,4Pettijohn, D. E., Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology, 2nd Ed., Neidhardt, F.

Among these proteins, HU has been identified as the major component of the bacterial nucleoid, the function of which is to facilitate a whole spectrum of molecular processes that involve DNA bending. With at least 30,000 molecules (dimers)/cell, HU statistically can bind every 200 bp of the E. coli chromosome (3Drlica K. Rouvière-Yaniv J. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 301-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HU protein of E. coli consists of two genetically unlinked polypeptides of about 9 kDa, which are encoded by two highly similar genes, hupA andhupB (8Kano Y. Yoshino S. Wada M. Yokoyama K. Nobuhara M. Imamoto F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1985; 201: 360-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 9Kano Y. Wada M. Nagase T. Imamoto F.

Imamoto F. Gene. 1988; 69: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In contrast to IHF, which binds strongly to a consensus DNA motif (12Craig N.L. Nash H.A. Cell. 1984; 39: 707-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 13Goodrich J.A. Schwartz M.L. McClure W.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4993-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), HU does not generally bind in a sequence-specific manner. The HU proteins of E. coli are functional both as homodimers and heterodimers, although each form seems to be specialized in nonidentical roles (14Rouviere-Yaniv J. Kjeldgaard N.O. FEBS Lett. 1979; 106: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 15Claret L. Rouviere-Yaniv J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 16Pinson V. Takahashi M. Rouviere-Yaniv J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 485-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). HU− mutants, which bear deletions of both thehupA and hupB genes in E. coli, are viable but exhibit many growth defects (17Wada M. Kano Y. Ogawa T. Okazaki T. Imamoto F. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 581-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 18Huisman O. Faelen M. Girard D. Jaffe A. Toussaint A. Rouviere-Yaniv J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3704-3712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, these mutants are sensitive to γ and UV irradiation because of the involvement of HU in DNA repair and homologous recombination (19Boubrik F. Rouvière-Yaniv J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3958-3962Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 20Li S. Waters R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3750-3756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although HU proteins are conserved in most microorganisms, only enteric bacteria seem to harbor two genes encoding polypeptides able to form a heterodimer (21Oberto J. Rouviere-Yaniv J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 293-297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In other eubacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, an essential single gene (hbs) gives rise to a homodimeric HU protein (21Oberto J. Rouviere-Yaniv J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 293-297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Micka B. Marahiel M.A. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1992; 74: 641-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which is named Hbsu in this species. The life cycle and the natural niches of E. coli are relatively simple compared with those of not-so-distant relatives, such as Pseudomonas putida, which thrive in soils polluted with toxic chemicals (23Chaudhry G.R. Chapalamadugu S. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 59-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Williams P.A. Sayers J.R. Biodegradation. 1994; 5: 195-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In these niches, the transduction of environmental signals occurs through a whole collection of mechanisms that very frequently involve regulated DNA bending (1Perez-Martin J. Rojo F. de Lorenzo V. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 268-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is particularly true for promoters of metabolic pathways that are dependent on factor sigma 54 (ς54), such as thePu and Ps promoters of the toluene degradation plasmid (TOL) or the Po promoter of the pVI150 (catabolism of methyl phenols), the expression of which is finely regulated by multiple environmental inputs (25Shingler V. Bartilson M. Moore T. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1596-1604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ramos J.L. Marques S. Timmis K.N. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 341-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Although such transduction pathways involving DNA bending can be reproduced to some extent inE. coli, it cannot be taken for granted that the same factors facilitating DNA bending are identical in bacteria living in more complex habitats. To address this issue, we fractionated a cell extract, P. putida, and sought proteins that were generically able to facilitate DNA bending. As shown below, the most active fraction contained two independent HU variants the function of which appeared to be to back up each other for essential DNA bending functions. Plasmid pFBT8 contains a genomic 6-kb SacI fragment from the P. putida chromosome spanning the hupB sequence and cloned in vector pZERO-2 (Invitrogen). The hupB gene was amplified from pFTB8 with primers PLHU1N (5′-TTCATATG(NdeI)AACAA GTCG GAA CTGATTG-3′) and PRHU1B (5′-TGGGATCC(BamHI)GA CTT AGTTGA CGGC GTC-3′), which generated an∼300-bp PCR product bound by a leading ATG overlapping a NdeI site and a stop codon, TAA, followed by aBamHI sequence. This fragment was digested withNdeI and BamHI and cloned in the corresponding sites of expression vector pT7-7 (gift of Stanley Tabor, Harvard Medical School), giving rise to plasmid pFBT17. Similarly, thehupN sequence was amplified with oligonucleotides PLNAK3 (5′-ACCACCATGG(NcoI)CATTGACCAAAGACC-3′) and PRNAK4 (5′-TTTGGATCC(BamHI)ATTACTTGTTGATGGCGTCG-3′), which left NcoI and BamHI sites at the start and end of the ORF. The resulting ∼300-bp product was cloned as aNcoI-BamHI insert in pET-3d (Stratagene), originating plasmid pFBT12. The inserts of pFBT17 (hupB +) and pFBT12 (hupN +) were resequenced to ensure that no error had been entered in the ORFs during the cloning procedures. For expression of hupB and hupN in B. subtilis, the corresponding inserts of pFBT17 and pFBT12 were transferred to shuttle vector pHP13 (27Haima P. Bron S. Venema G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 209: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), which contains origins of replication functional in both E. coli and B. subtilis, as well as chloramphenicol (cat,CmR) and erythromycin resistance gene markers. To transferhupB to such a shuttle plasmid, pFBT17 was digested withXbaI, a site for which is located upstream of the optimized Shine-Dalgarno sequences and the translation initiation regions present in the plasmids. The resulting XbaI end of the digested pFBT17 was then blunt-ended with T4 DNA polymerase and the plasmid subsequently digested with BamHI. This released thehupB sequence as a segment bounded by a blunt end and aBamHI site. Such purified fragment was then cloned in pHP13 digested with SmaI and BamHI, thereby giving rise to plasmids pHP13-hupB. The same procedure was used to generate an equivalent plasmid with hupN, except that the fragment inserted in the shuttle pHP13 was bounded by a blunt-ended extreme (formerly a XbaI site in pFBT12) and aHindIII site. Ligation of such ahupN + fragment to pHP13, digested withSmaI and the HindIII originated plasmid pHP13-hupN. In these constructs, the hupB andhupN genes are located downstream of the cat gene of pHP13, so that their transcription originates from thecat promoter. The plasmids employed for overproduction of hupB andhupN in P. putida (see below) were constructed by transferring the inserts of pFBT17 and pFBT12 into the broad host range and kanamycin resistance expression vector pVLT33 (28De Lorenzo V. Eltis L. Kessler B. Timmis K.N. Gene. 1993; 123: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). To this purpose, both pFBT17 and pFBT12 were digested with XbaI. The resulting ends were filled in as described above, and digested withBamHI. This originated DNA segments each flanked by one blunt end an a BamHI extreme. The DNA fragments were ligated to vector pVLT33, which had been digested withEcoRI, filled in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase + dNTPs (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and subsequently digested with BamHI. Because of this pedigree, the resulting plasmids, pFBT18 (hupB +) and pFBT16 (hupN +), bore each of the genes preceded by an optimal Shine-Dalgarno and translation initiation region sequences and located downstream of a strong Ptac promoter inducible with isopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. A variant of pFBT18 named pFBT22 contained a xylE gene (encoding the enzyme catechol 2,3-dioxygenase) in addition to hupB. For the construction of pFBT22, xylE was entered in pFBT18 by digesting it with BamHI + HindIII and ligating the result to the 960-bp fragment released from pXYLE1 (30Stein D.C. Gene. 1992; 117: 157-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) when cleaved with the same enzymes. The isolation of protein fractions enriched in the DNA bending activity was based on the protocol of Padas et al. (31Padas P.M. Wilson K.S. Vorgias C.E.

Subsequent manipulations were carried out at 0–6 °C. 12 g of the frozen cell paste were resuspended in 150 ml of buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm NaCl) added together with 3 mg of DNase I, and lysed with a French press. After centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was added stepwise for 30 min with ammonium sulfate at 55 and 85%. After centrifugation of the 85% ammonium sulfate extract, the pellet was resuspended in 12 ml of buffer A and dialyzed overnight against 5 liters of buffer A using a MWCO/2000 tubes (Spectrum Medical Industries). The dialyzed protein solution was applied to a 2-ml heparin-Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with buffer A. Bound protein was eluted with a 30-ml gradient of 0.1–1.5m NaCl in buffer A. The fractions enriched in proteins with a molecular size within the range of 7 to 12 kDa (as judged by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) were diluted in buffer A and subsequently loaded on a 4-ml SP-Sepharose High Performance (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with buffer A. A 40-ml gradient of 0.1–1.5 m NaCl in buffer A was applied. Fractions enriched in proteins within the same size range given above were selected for further analysis. For identification of major proteins, the fractions of interest were run in a denaturing Tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis system (33Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar) and blotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250, washed in water, and air-dried. The protein bands in the range of 9 kDa were excised from the membrane, and their N-terminal amino acids were determined through and automated Edman degradation microsequencing protocol (34Maiorino M. Roche C. Kiess M. Koenig K. Gawlik D. Matthes M. Naldini E. Pierce R. Flohe L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 838-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with the Protein Assay ESL (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), which is based on complexing Cu2+ ions by the protein to be measured in a reaction exclusively dependent on the number of peptide bonds. The assay (35Alonso J.C. Weise F. Rojo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2938-2945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) is based on the site-specific recombination between so-called six sites brought about by the β-recombinase encoded by plasmid pSM19035 of Streptococcus pyogenes as part of its replication mechanism (36Rojo F. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The 5.8-kb test plasmid pCB8 (36Rojo F. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) contains two directly repeated target six sites separated by 2.2 kb. Reaction mixtures were set up in a volume of 25 μl containing 10 nm pCB8, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 nm of purified β-recombinase. The materials tested for DNA bending included both crude extracts and protein fractions fromP. putida as well as purified HupB and HupN proteins, which were added to the assays in amounts indicated in each case. Samples containing 50 nm of the chromatin-associated protein Hbsu from B. subtilis were also used as positive controls for the performance of the assay. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by heating (70 °C, 10 min). The DNA was then digested in the same buffer with PstI andSalI, and the resulting fragments were analyzed by agarose-gel electrophoresis (37Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1989) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New YorkGoogle Scholar). To avoid cross-contamination between the HU proteins of P. putida and E. coli, we systematically used a P. putida host for overexpression of the HupB and HupN products. To this end, thehupN + plasmid, pFBT16, was electroporated into the wild type strain P. putida KT2442, whereas thehupB + plasmid pFBT18 was placed into a ΔhupN deletion mutant (see below). The purification procedure for HupB and HupN was carried out basically according to Ref.31Padas P.M. Wilson K.S. Vorgias C.E. Gene. 1992; 117: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar. Each of the expression strains were grown in 4–5 liters of LB medium (with 50 μg/ml kanamycin) at 30 °C with vigorous shaking to an A600 of 0.6–0.8. Following the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside, the cultures were further incubated for 3–4 h at the same temperature. 13–18 g of wet cell paste were harvested by centrifugation for 10 min in the cold at 16,300 × g. Cells resuspended in 3 ml of buffer A (see above)/gram of paste were lysed with a French press and cleared by centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 30 min. The proteins that precipitated within the 55–85% saturation range of ammonium sulfate were resuspended in 2 ml of buffer A/gram of cells and dialyzed extensively against buffer A. The resulting protein solution (35–40 ml) was loaded at a flow of 1 ml/min in a 5-ml heparin-Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with buffer A. After washing the column extensively with buffer A, an 80-ml gradient of 0.1–1.7 m NaCl in buffer A was applied to the column at the same 1 ml/min flow rate. 2-ml fractions were collected and analyzed in Tricine-SDS-PAGE (33Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). HupN eluted from the column within 0.55–0.75 m NaCl with a purity in the best fractions ≥95%, and thus no further purification was pursued. On the contrary, HupB eluted at 0.51–0.76 mNaCl, but the fractions were significantly contaminated with a few additional proteins. The HupB-containing fractions were therefore pooled and dialyzed overnight against buffer A, and 15 ml of the dialysate was loaded at a 1 ml/min rate on a 3-ml SP-Sepharose High Performance (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with buffer A. After washing the column with 3 ml of buffer A, a 60-ml gradient of 0.1–1.0 m NaCl was applied, also at 1 ml/min, to elute the protein. 1.5-ml fractions were collected and analyzed in Tricine-SDS-PAGE as before. The fractions corresponding to 0.3m NaCl contained >95% pure HupB. Fractions containing either pure HupN or HupB were pooled separately, dialyzed against buffer A, and added with glycerol to a concentration of 44% (v/v). The preparations were stored at −20 °C and contained, respectively, 1.0 mg/ml (HupN) and 2.0 mg/ml (HupB). The physical association between HupB and HupN monomers was examined through covalent binding of surface-exposed Lys residues on the polypeptides with suberic acid (disuccinimidyl suberate, Sigma). Stock solutions of suberic acid were prepared at a concentration of 10 mg/ml in dimethyl sulfoxide. A typical 100-μl cross-linking reaction contained 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmMgCl2, 25 mm NaCl, 4 μm HupB or HupN, 0.2 mg/ml suberic acid, in 100 μl reaction volume. Control reactions were set up by replacing the HU proteins by 30 μg/ml lysozyme, which exists only as a monomer. To examine the formation of multimers in the presence of DNA the reactions were added where indicated with 200 nm pCB8 plasmid. One way or the other, mixtures were incubated for 15 min at room temperature and the reactions stopped with an excess (4 mm) of lysine. Samples were then dialyzed in Microcon-10 concentrators (Millipore) and examined in denaturing 15% polyacrylamide-Tricine-SDS gels (33Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). A specialized P. putida strain bearing a transcriptionallacZ fusion to the HU-dependent Pspromoter of the TOL plasmid (38Abril M.A. Michan C. Timmis K.N. Ramos J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6782-6790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Perez-Martin J. de Lorenzo V. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3758-3763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was generated as follows. The 2.4-kb HpaI fragment of plasmid pTK19 (T. Köhler, University of Geneva) containing the complete xylRgene and the Ps promoter was cloned into the SmaI site of the lacZ vector pUJ8 (40De Lorenzo V. Herrero M. Jakubzik U. Timmis K.N. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6568-6572Crossref PubMed Scopus (1203) Google Scholar), thereby generating aPs-lacZ fusion. Such a fusion was excised from the resulting plasmid as a 6.5-kb NotI fragment, which was cloned into theNotI site of a tellurite resistance pUT/mini-Tn5delivery plasmid (41Sanchez-Romero J.M. Diaz-Orejas R. De Lorenzo V. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 4040-4046Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The hybridxylR + /Ps-lacZ mini-transposon generated thereby was integrated into the chromosome of P. putida KT2442 (described in detail in Ref. 42De Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 235: 386-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Onelac + TelR P. putidaexconjugant sensitive to piperacillin (43Fernández S. de Lorenzo V. Pérez-Martı́n J. Mol.

Jakubzik U. Timmis K.N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1773-1776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was picked up as a reference strain to monitor the phenotypes ofhupB and hupN mutants. To generate P. putida variants lacking either hupB or hupN, we entered directed deletions of each gene into the chromosome by homologous recombination. In the case of hupB, plasmid pFBT8 was used as the template to generate two PCR products with the pairs of primers PLKB1 (5′-GGAATTC(EcoRI)ACGTGCCGATGTGGCCATGACCGGCG-3′)/PRKB2 (5′-TCAGGATCC(BamHI)TTAAGTATGTAATGAAAAGCTTATGAAACGTGTGC-3′) and PLKB3(5′-TAAGGATC C(BamHI)TGACAAACCGGCAAGGCAATCAAGATCGAAGCC-3′)/PRKB4 (5′-ACGTAAGCTT(HindIII)GCATCAGTTGACGGCGCTGCATGTCGGC-3′). The first product (456 bp) was digested with EcoRI +BamHI, whereas the second product (492 bp) was treated withBamHI + HindIII. The digested DNAs were purified and ligated together to vector pUC18Not (45Herrero M. de Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6557-6567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar) digested withEcoRI + HindIII (46de Lorenzo V. Herrero M. Sánchez J.M. Timmis K.N. FEMS Microbiol. Ecol. 1998; 27: 211-224Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This originated a plasmid that had a NotI insert spanning the genomic DNA sequence starting at −474 bp and going to −36 bp upstream of the leading ATG of hupB, followed by an artificialBamHI site and followed by the sequence +189 downstream of the ATG to +386 after the stop codon of the structural gene. Such aNotI fragment thus contains a genomic deletion of 224 bp that engages the hupB sequence. The presence of two in-frame stop codons around the BamHI site employed to create the deletion ensured the loss of the entire HupB function. The 947-bpNotI fragment was then passed on to suicide delivery vector pKNG101 (47Kaniga K. Delor I. Cornelis G.R. Gene. 1991; 109: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) (resulting in plasmid pKNG101ΔhupB) and recombined in the chromosome of P. putida Ps-lacZ as described (47Kaniga K. Delor I. Cornelis G.R. Gene. 1991; 109: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The chromosomal deletion was confirmed by PCR with primers PLKOB5 (5′-GCCATGCCTCCCAGCACACG-3′) and PRKOB7 (5′-GCGTCCTGGCTATGAGTGGC-3′). A similar approach was used to produce a ΔhupN strain. In this case, genomic DNA was directly used to generate two PCR products with the pairs of primers PLKN1 (5′-GGAATTC(EcoRI)-TCGGCG CGCTGCAAAAGTTGC-3′)/PRKN2 (5′-TCAGGATCC(BamHI)TTAATCAAA TTCGATGGTTATGCAGCGGACTACG-3′) and PLKN3 (5′-TAAGGATC C(BamHI)TGAGACCAACTGATTGCCGACATCGCCGAATCG3′)/ PRKN4 (5′-ACGTAAGCTT(HindIII)CCCGGGCAAGCCGGGCGCGGTTTCG-3′). The PCR products digested, respectively, with EcoRI +BamHI and BamHI + HindIII were cloned simultaneously into pUC18Not treated with EcoRI +HindIII as before. The resulting 690-bp insert was then placed into the NotI site of pKNG101, yielding pKNG101ΔhupN, and was subsequently recombined into the chromosome of the P. putida strain. This produced a genomic deletion of a small 31-bp segment that eliminated the region between coordinates −17 to +14 in respect to the leading ATG codon of the gene. Such a deletion was confirmed with PCR using the primers PLKON5 (5′CGATAACGTCGTAGTCCGCTGC-3′) and PRKON6 (5′-GTCAGCACTTTGGCT-GGAACGAAC-3′).

The complete HupB and HupN sequences from P. putida were assembled with the assistance of the TIGR (The Institute for Genomic Research) genomic data bank. The GenBankTM accession numbers of the new HU proteins reported in this work are AF345628 (hupB ofP. putida); AF345629 (hupN of P. putida), and AF345630 (hupN of P. aeruginosa). To identify the proteins of P. putida with an ability to promote DNA bending in a sequence-independent fashion, we resorted to the in vitrotest summarized in Fig. 1.

PDI substrates are not restricted to misfolded proteins; PDI catalyzes the dithiothreitol (DTT)-dependent reduction of native ribonuclease A, microbial ribonuclease, and pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, suggesting that an ongoing surveillance by PDI can test even native disulfides for their ability to rearrange. The mechanism of reduction is consistent with an equilibrium unfolding of the substrate, attack by the nucleophilic cysteine of PDI followed by direct attack of DTT on a covalent intermediate between PDI and the substrate. For native proteins, the rate constants for PDI-catalyzed reduction correlate very well with the rate constants for uncatalyzed reduction by DTT. However, the rate is weakly correlated with disulfide stability, surface exposure, or local disorder in the crystal. Compared with native proteins, scrambled ribonuclease is a much better substrate for PDI than predicted from its reactivity with DTT; however, partially reduced bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (des(14–38)) is not.

The linear information in the protein sequence is decoded to give rise to three-dimensional structure in a way that is not completely understood. Although maximum thermodynamic stability is certainly one property that identifies the native states of many proteins, proteins like α-lytic protease are biologically active in a metastable conformation that is kinetically trapped from converting into a more stable structure (1Sohl J.L. Jaswal S.S. Agard D.A. Nature. 1998; 395: 817-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In the cell, protein folding occurs in the presence of folding catalysts and molecular chaperones. Structural features that mark the biologically active conformation must be decoded by these folding assistants so that they can discriminate native from misfolded conformations. This is particularly true in the endoplasmic reticulum, where an elaborate quality control system (2Hammond C. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) ensures that misfolded proteins are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (or degraded), whereas correctly folded proteins are allowed to exit. Protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI)1 is a 55-kDa folding assistant and chaperone of the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum (3Noiva R. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3553-3556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Freedman R.B. Hirst R.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biol.

It catalyzes thiol-disulfide exchange reactions, including disulfide formation, disulfide reduction, and disulfide isomerization. The mechanism of PDI-catalyzed disulfide isomerization involves cycles of disulfide reduction and oxidation so that incorrect disulfides are reduced and converted eventually, through a trial and error process, to native disulfides that are resistant to further isomerization (6Walker K.W. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13642-13650Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A similar cycle of trial and error unfolding/refolding operates in ATP-dependent chaperones, such as GroEL/ES (7Schmidt M. Rutkat K. Rachel R. Pfeifer G. Jaenicke R. Viitanen P. Lorimer G. Buchner J. Science. 1994; 265: 656-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar,8Martin J. Hartl F.U. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). For chaperone-mediated folding, the native conformation is resistant to further structural rearrangement. This resistance of a structure to further attempts at refolding could be due to thermodynamic or kinetic stability, and it is likely that both are important. Chaperones recognize the non-native state by its exposed hydrophobic surface that is normally buried in the folded protein. They fail to interact with the native state because the “recognition” sites are not accessible (9Buchner J. FASEB. J. 1996; 10: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). However, some chaperones can facilitate protein unfolding (10Zahn R. Perrett S. Stenberg G. Fersht A.R. Science. 1996; 271: 642-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar); thus, there may be ongoing surveillance of the native state, or the chaperone may trap the native protein when it spontaneously unfolds. With PDI, recognition of native versus non-native structure might be based on any of the structural or chemical differences between the two states. The native structure may be resistant to PDI attack because its disulfides are inaccessible. PDI and related proteins are the only molecular chaperones that interact covalently with their substrates. One of the active site cysteines (the nucleophilic cysteine) forms a mixed disulfide with a cysteine from the substrate (6Walker K.W. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13642-13650Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Zapun A. Cooper L. Creighton T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1907-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 12Wunderlich M. Otto A. Maskos K. Muche M. Seckler R. Glockshuber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Once a native disulfide is attacked by PDI, the disulfide may reform and expel PDI much faster than it rearranges, implying chemical stability of the protein disulfide. Finally, the native protein may be subject to PDI attack, just like misfolded proteins, but the thermodynamic stability of the native state ensures a low equilibrium concentration of misfolded proteins. To explore how (or if) PDI discriminates native from non-native structures, we compared the reactivity of several native protein disulfides with dithiothreitol in the presence and absence of PDI. The protein substrates we examined are all very well characterized structurally and thermodynamically, including knowledge about the contribution of specific disulfides to the structure. The proteins include bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A (RNase A) (13Iwaoka M. Wedemeyer W.J. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2805-2815Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) (14Hurle M.R. Marks C.B. Kosen P.A. Anderson S. Kuntz I.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4410-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and microbial ribonuclease (RNase Sa) (15Pace C.N. Hebert E.J. Shaw K.L. Schell D. Both V. Krajcikova D. Sevcik J. Wilson K.S. Dauter Z. Hartley R.W. Grimsley G.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 271-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The proteins have different structures, disulfide exposures, and thermodynamic stabilities. All are PDI substrates. The rate constants for PDI-catalyzed reduction are directly correlated with the rate constants for uncatalyzed reaction with DTT over a reactivity range that spans six orders of magnitude. Scrambled RNase, with its randomly formed disulfides, is considerably more reactive with PDI than expected based on the reactivity of the native protein, implying that PDI recognizes extensively unfolded proteins. This extensive interaction is evidently not available for the transiently unfolded structures that are formed from native proteins. BPTI, RNase A, DTT, and iodoacetic acid were obtained from Sigma. Wild-type PDI and mutants were expressed inEscherichia coli strain BL 21 (DE3) obtained from Novagen Inc. (Madison, WI). RNase Sa and its mutants, D17K Sa and E74K Sa, were a generous gift from Dr. C. Nick Pace (Texas A & M University, College Station, TX). PDI was purified to >90% homogeneity, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as described previously (16Gilbert H.F. Kruzel M.L. Lyles M.M. Harper J.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1991; 2: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The concentration of PDI was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using E0.1% of 0.94 mg/ml−1 cm−1 (17Lyles M.M. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). All absorbance measurements were performed using a Beckman DU-70 spectrophotometer. PDI was reduced in 10 mm DTT overnight at room temperature. The DTT was removed by centrifugal gel filtration using BioGel P-6 equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. Scrambled RNase A (sRNase) was produced by a modification of the method of Hillsonet al. (18Hillson D.A. Lambert N. Freedman R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Native RNase A (30 mg/ml) was incubated with 130 mm DTT (15-fold excess over RNase disulfides) in 50 mm Tris-HCl containing 9 m urea and 50 mm sarcosine, pH 8.6, for 18–20 h at room temperature and followed by extensive dialysis against 0.1 m acetic acid in the cold. The RNase A was then diluted into 50 volumes of 9m urea, 50 mm Tris, and 50 mmsarcosine, pH 8.5. Oxygen gas was bubbled slowly through solution in the dark for 2 days at room temperature. The solution was dialyzed extensively against 0.05 m NH4HCO3and then lyophilized. The sRNase concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using ε = 9800m−1 cm−1(19Shaffer S.W. Ahmed A.K. Wetlaufer D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 8483-8486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thiol content was analyzed using Ellman's assay (20Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 82: 70-77Crossref Scopus (21624) Google Scholar) and was determined to be <4% of the RNase cysteine residues. Reduction and unfolding reactions were carried out in the presence of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 m KCl, and various concentrations of DTT and PDI. All of the solutions except the protein stocks were purged of oxygen by bubbling with argon for 10 min. At various times after the reactions were initiated by addition of protein, aliquots were quenched with a solution containing 0.25m iodoacetate (adjusted to pH 8.0 with KOH). After 15 min at room temperature, the solutions were placed on ice. For BPTI, RNase A, and sRNase reduction, the sample was analyzed on a native polyacrylamide gel (27%) using the low-pH discontinuous system of Reisfield et al. (21Reisfield R.A. Lewis U.J. Williams D.E. Nature. 1962; 195: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic separation was at constant voltage (130–160 V) at 4 °C for 1–2 h. Staining was performed with 0.1% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue in 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and 10% (w/v) sulfosalicylic acid overnight. The gels were destained by diffusion into 7.5% acetic acid and 5% methanol. RNase Sa reduction was analyzed in the same way, except that the oxidized and reduced proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12%). The concentration of various species was determined by densitometry of Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained gels. The rate constants for the reduction of native proteins were determined by using an exponential function to fit the time course for the disappearance of native protein. With some proteins and at some of the lower DTT and PDI concentrations, the rate of reduction was sufficiently slow that the initial rate of disappearance of the native protein was used to estimate the rate constant. Under these conditions, the initial concentration of DTT was assumed to equal the added concentration of DTT, avoiding the complications of air oxidation that occurs with prolonged incubations. The rate constants observed by initial rates agreed with those observed at higher DTT concentrations, where the reduction of native protein was observed to go to completion. Rates in the presence of PDI were corrected for any spontaneous reaction with DTT observed in the absence of PDI. The PDI-catalyzed reaction was generally more than 1.5–2-fold higher than that in the absence of PDI. The contribution of disulfides to protein stability depends on the redox environment (22Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar). Although denaturants are often added to facilitate the reduction of native proteins, reduction of native proteins can be observed at high concentrations of good reducing agents such as DTT (23Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 87: 563-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). If PDI can interact with native proteins and facilitate the reduction of native disulfides, the presence of PDI should increase the rate of reduction when sufficiently high concentrations of DTT are present to drive the equilibrium toward the reduced protein. Three disulfide-containing proteins were examined for PDI-catalyzed reduction: RNase A, BPTI, and RNase Sa. These were chosen because they have all been well characterized with respect to the contribution of specific disulfide(s) to stability. The reduction of native proteins by DTT at pH 7.5 (10 mm Tris HCl, 0.2 m KCl, and 1 mm EDTA) can be observed by native or SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after quenching the reaction with a high concentration of iodoacetate (0.25 m) to prevent any further thiol-disulfide exchange and to introduce additional negative charges into the protein (24Creighton T.E. Nature. 1980; 284: 487-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The relative concentrations of reduced and native proteins at various times after initiating reduction were determined by densitometry of the gels. PDI catalyzes the DTT-dependent reduction of all the native proteins examined (Table I). A representative example is shown in Fig.1, where 3.5 μm PDI accelerates the conversion of native RNase A to the reduced protein approximately 5-fold. During the reduction of native RNase A (four disulfides) (Fig. 1), no specific, partially reduced intermediates are observed by gel electrophoresis, although high pressure liquid chromatography shows that reduction proceeds by preferential reduction of the 65–72 and 40–95 disulfides (25Li Y. Rothwarf D.M. Scheraga H.A. Nat. Stru. Biol. 1995; 2: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Consequently, only the first step of the reduction (N→R) was observed. Both the band corresponding to the native protein and the broad band(s) of the fully reduced protein were used to determine rate constants for conversion of the native protein to the collection of reduced proteins.Table IProperties of native and non-native disulfides and the rate constants for protein reduction by DTT in the presence and absence of PDISpeciesRate constant for reductionAccessibility1-bWater-accessible surface area estimated by the program WHATIF by Gert Vriend athttp://www.cmbi.kun.nl:1100/WIWWNI.

Open table in a new tab PDI also catalyzes the reduction of native BPTI (28Creighton T.E. Hillson D.A. Freedman R. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 142: 43-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). BPTI has three disulfides, and the fastest step is the reduction of the 14–38 disulfide to produce des(14–38) BPTI (29Mendosa J.A. Jarstfer M.B. Goldenberg D.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1143-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). At a DTT concentration of 5 mm (Fig. 2), the first step occurs with a half-time of 0.5–1 min. PDI at a concentration of 0.5–2 μm increases the rate of this step ∼1.5–2-fold. This is followed by a slow intramolecular rearrangement or direct reduction of the remaining two disulfides (28Creighton T.E. Hillson D.A. Freedman R. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 142: 43-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In the absence of PDI, the partially reduced intermediate is at this reduced very slowly DTT concentration, consistent with the results reported by Creightonet al. (28Creighton T.E. Hillson D.A. Freedman R. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 142: 43-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, PDI increases the reduction of this intermediate to fully reduced protein, even at low concentrations of DTT (0.5 mm) (Fig. 2). In the presence or absence of PDI, the disappearance of the native protein is first order and can be described by an exponential function. For all of the proteins examined (RNase, BPTI, and RNase Sa), the native protein can be fully reduced in the presence of PDI at high DTT and PDI concentrations. Fig. 3 shows the rate constant for RNase A reduction as a function of the DTT concentration. For all of the proteins examined, including RNase A, the rate constant for reduction is proportional to DTT concentration. Thus, the rate-limiting step involves a molecule of DTT, even when the reaction is catalyzed by PDI. The rate constants for native protein reduction are also linearly dependent on the PDI concentration (representative data are shown in Fig.4), with no evidence of saturation up to a PDI concentration of 3.5 μm. The rate constants for catalyzed and uncatalyzed reduction are summarized in Table I. For the reduction by DTT, the rate constant is second order overall (units ofm−1min−1) and first order in native protein and DTT concentration. With PDI-dependent reduction, the rate of reduction is third order overall (units ofm−2min−1) and first order in native protein, PDI, and DTT.Figure 4Dependence of the rate constant for the RNase reduction on the PDI concentration at pH 7.5 (10 mmTris-HCl, 0.2 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 37 °C).The DTT concentration was 10 mm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The first-order dependence of the PDI-catalyzed reduction on the concentration of DTT, substrate protein, and PDI suggests a simple mechanism where the rate-limiting step involves direct reduction of a disulfide formed by attack of PDI on the native protein. Consistent with the covalent participation of PDI in the reaction, a PDI mutant with no active site cysteines is inactive (Fig.5). PDI is a multidomain protein with two independent active sites, one near the amino terminus of the protein and another near the carboxyl terminus (6Walker K.W. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13642-13650Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Each active site has two cysteines in the sequence CGHC. At either active site, the first cysteine (CGHC) is exposed to solvent and reacts with substrate. The second active site cysteine (CGHC) is buried and restricted to react with only the other active site cysteine. If a substrate-PDI mixed disulfide intermediate is reduced directly by DTT, the second active site cysteine (CGHC) nearer the carboxyl terminus should be dispensable for catalysis. This prediction is confirmed experimentally. Both the wild-type PDI (CGHC …CGHC) and a mutant PDI with a single nucleophilic cysteine at the more carboxyl-terminal active site (SGHS …CGHS) are effective catalysts of BPTI reduction (Fig. 5). Only one active site cysteine is required to catalyze DTT-dependent reduction, showing that the intramolecular displacement of the substrate cysteine by the second active site cysteine is slow compared with the attack of DTT. Ribonuclease Sa is a small (96 amino acids) extracellular ribonuclease isolated from growth media of Streptomyces aureofaciens BM-K (30Gasperik J. Prescakova S. Zelinka J. Biologia (Bratislava). 1982; 37: 377-381Google Scholar). It has one disulfide between residues 7 and 96 that contributes 4.6 kcal/mol to the overall stability of the protein (6.4 kcal/mol) (15Pace C.N. Hebert E.J. Shaw K.L. Schell D. Both V. Krajcikova D. Sevcik J. Wilson K.S. Dauter Z. Hartley R.W. Grimsley G.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 271-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). As with other native proteins, RNase Sa is reduced catalytically by PDI. To observe the effect of thermodynamic stability on reduction in the absence of large sequence variation, mutants of RNase Sa, D17K and E74K, were also examined. The mutants are 1.1 kcal/mol less or more stable than RNase Sa, respectively. The PDI-catalyzed reduction of wild-type and mutant Sa was measured using nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and quantifying the intensity of the native protein band after staining, similar to the methods used with RNaseA and BPTI. The least stable Sa mutant, D17K, is reduced faster than wild-type RNase Sa, and the more stable mutant, E74K, is reduced more slowly than wild-type RNase Sa (Table I). To compare PDI-catalyzed reduction of native disulfides to its reduction of a random, unstructured disulfide, the reduction of scrambled RNase was measured. As expected, the reduction of sRNase was much faster than that of native proteins (Table I). The rate constant for sRNase reduction catalyzed by PDI is about 106faster than that seen for reduction of native RNase A. When statistically corrected for the number of reactive disulfides (four disulfides), the PDI-catalyzed reduction of sRNase is ∼100-fold faster than the PDI-catalyzed reduction of the native, 14–38 disulfide of BPTI. Whether the substrate is a native protein or one that is misfolded, PDI can clearly involve it in thiol-disulfide exchange and catalyze its reduction by DTT. The absence of PDI-catalyzed reduction in a mutant with no active site cysteines (Fig. 5) suggests that PDI participates covalently in DTT-dependent reduction, as in the catalysis of substrate oxidation and isomerization. The first-order dependence of the rate of reduction on the substrate, DTT, and PDI concentrations is consistent with the mechanism for disulfide reduction shown in Fig.6. According to this model, the protein spontaneously unfolds to expose a disulfide, followed by attack of PDI and rate-limiting attack of DTT on a PDI-substrate mixed disulfide. This model predicts that the second active site cysteine of PDI does not participate in DTT-dependent reduction, presumably because the intermolecular attack by DTT is faster than attack of the second active site cysteine to form a PDI active site disulfide, a prediction that is confirmed experimentally (Fig. 5). According to this mechanism, uncatalyzed protein disulfide reduction can be separated into two linked steps, as proposed by Li et al. (25Li Y. Rothwarf D.M. Scheraga H.A. Nat. Stru. Biol. 1995; 2: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the first step (Kun), spontaneous unfolding of some portion of the native structure exposes the protein disulfide to attack. As suggested by Li et al. (25Li Y. Rothwarf D.M. Scheraga H.A. Nat. Stru. Biol. 1995; 2: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the energetics of spontaneous unfolding can be approximated by assuming that the exposed disulfide reacts with DTT like a typical, exposed cysteine disulfide (kex,DTT = 1205m−1min−1). The observed rate constant for DTT reduction is thenkDTT=Kun×kex,DTTEquation 1 The free energy corresponding to unfolding (Kun) is due to destroying noncovalent interactions in the native state that must be broken to convert the protein disulfide to one that is as reactive as an exposed disulfide in scrambled RNase. Using the same approximation, Goldenberg (31Goldenberg D.P. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2481-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) estimates that the 5–55 and 30–51 disulfides of BPTI in the des(14–38) BPTI intermediate require extensive unfolding of the core of the molecule. Li et al. (25Li Y. Rothwarf D.M. Scheraga H.A. Nat. Stru. Biol. 1995; 2: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), on the other hand, find that native RNase A reduction ((65–72) or (40–95) disulfides) requires only partial unfolding, presumably local unfolding in the vicinity of the disulfide. When several different substrate disulfides are considered, it is clear that the extent to which the free energy stabilizing the surrounding protein structure opposes reduction varies considerably from protein to protein (Table I). The native proteins we chose to study have been characterized extremely well with respect to structure, stability, and the contribution of the individual disulfides to stability. Of the four disulfides of native RNase, reduction of 65–72 and 40–95 occur the fastest and by parallel pathways (25Li Y. Rothwarf D.M. Scheraga H.A. Nat. Stru. Biol. 1995; 2: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). With BPTI, the 14–38 disulfide is the most easily reduced. With RNase Sa, there is only one disulfide bond. The common characteristic of these disulfides is that they are all at least partially exposed to solvent (Table I). Totally inaccessible disulfides are less reactive. However, for the partially exposed disulfides in this study, there is only a weak correlation between exposure and reactivity with DTT or PDI. Native RNase is the least exposed and least reactive; however, the exposures of the reactive disulfides of RNase Sa and BPTI are similar, but BPTI is almost 100-fold more reactive. The disulfides of these three proteins contribute differently to the stability of the structure toward equilibrium denaturation. The difference in the free energy of stabilization for the wild-type protein and mutants in which the cysteine has been replaced by alanine are given in Table I. If unfolding of the structure that is stabilized by the disulfides occurs in the transition state for reduction, then stability would correlate directly to reactivity. However, this is not the case for the proteins in this study. The 14–38 disulfide contributes as much to the stability of BPTI as the 7–96 disulfide of RNase Sa; however, the 14–38 disulfide of BPTI is 74-fold more reactive with DTT. Apparently, the interactions that are stabilized by a given disulfide must be destroyed to differing extents as the disulfide is reduced. Kinetic flexibility of the structure surrounding the disulfide might also affect the rate of disulfide reduction; however, for these proteins, the disulfides are all located in reasonably rigid portions of the molecule, and there appears to be no correlation of the rate of reduction with the crystallographic temperature factor of the structure surrounding the disulfide. As with other factors that govern protein stability and kinetic reactivity, the reactivity of disulfides with PDI and DTT reflects a delicate and complex interplay between exposure and stability, possibly including long-range interactions that stabilize the structure. Native disulfides are clearly not immune from PDI-initiated attempts at isomerization or reduction. Surveillance by PDI is evidently an ongoing process for both native and non-native disulfides. Substrate reduction, oxidation, and isomerization are all initiated by the attack of a PDI active site cysteine on a substrate sulfur; hence, the recognition events are likely to be similar for all PDI-catalyzed reactions. Some disulfides are simply more reactive with PDI than others, and this difference is reflected both in the rate of PDI-catalyzed reduction and in the uncatalyzed reduction by DTT. In fact, reactivity with PDI correlates faithfully with the reactivity toward DTT over 6 orders of magnitude (Fig. 7). For native proteins, the a plot of log(kDTT) against log(kPDI) is linear, with a slope of 0.8 ± 0.03. The slope is determined by a series of different proteins with greatly different reactivity. If only the three RNase Sa variants are considered, the slope is 0.94 ± 0.3, very close to 1, suggesting that the factors that dictate reactivity with DTT influence the PDI-catalyzed reaction to the same extent. For these native protein disulfides, PDI recognizes features of the native structure but with no more discrimination than DTT. The determinants of native disulfide reactivity with PDI are essentially those features of the disulfide that govern its reactivity with DTT. Although BPTI is almost as reactive with PDI and DTT as an exposed disulfide, the thermodynamic stability of the structure of the native arrangement of disulfides is the most stable one, preventing the accumulation of alternative disulfide arrangements (27Creighton T.E. Goldenberg D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 497-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The strong correlation between the rates of catalyzed and uncatalyzed reduction of native disulfides shows that the factors that influence reactivity with PDI and DTT are very similar. This is consistent with a previous study on the formation of a disulfide from two cysteines of β-lactamase that are buried in a folded structure (6Walker K.W. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13642-13650Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In this case, the β-lactamase has to unfold spontaneously before the thiols can be oxidized by PDI. Compared with the disulfide of glutathione, PDI is 500-fold better in promoting the oxidation of folded, reduced β-lactamase. This difference in rate can be accounted for by the higher chemical reactivity of the active site disulfide of PDI compared with glutathione disulfide. Based on this precedent (6Walker K.W. Gilbert H.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13642-13650Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), it seems unlikely that PDI facilitates the reduction of native disulfides by interacting with the native structure and inducing it to unfold. Based on the behavior of native proteins, the rate constant for PDI-catalyzed reduction of the denatured protein sRNase is about 60-fold faster than expected from the rate of its reduction by DTT (Fig. 7). Although PDI does not recognize differences between various native proteins any better than DTT, it does detect unfolded substrates better than DTT, presumably through interaction with an extensively unfolded polypeptide. Klappa et al. (32Klappa P. Ruddock L.W. Darby N.J. Freedman R.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 927-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) suggest that larger protein substrates (like sRNase) interact with multiple peptide/protein binding sites distributed on the PDI molecule. This more extensive interaction would allow PDI to kinetically detect disulfides in the context of extensively unfolded polypeptide and specifically reduce them. Interestingly, reduction of the des(14–38) BPTI species falls on the line established by native proteins, suggesting that this species is not extensively unfolded (from the perspective of PDI) in the absence of the 14–38 disulfide. Although native protein disulfides are substrates for PDI-dependent reduction, extensively unfolded substrates are preferred (Fig. 7). We thank Dr. C. N. Pace and K. L. Shaw of the Department of Medical Biochemistry and Genetics, Texas A & M University for their generous gift of RNase Sa and its mutants."

Genetics. 2000; 156: 535-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This drug sensitivity is thought to result from stress upon the elongation machinery due to a reduction in the intracellular pools of nucleotides used for RNA synthesis (3Archambault J. Lacroute F. Ruet A. Friesen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4142-4152Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 8Exinger F. Lacroute F. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). It is well known that, in vitro, a low concentration of nucleotide substrates causes pol II to transcribe at a slower rate, become arrested more often, and therefore be dependent upon SII for efficient elongation (4Powell W. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6866-6873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 14Wiest D.K. Hawley D.K. Mol. Cell.

Hence, upon drug treatment, yeast may become more dependent upon efficient transcript elongation by pol II. Nevertheless, not all 6AU-sensitive mutants carry mutations in genes that are obviously related to transcription elongation (18Loison G. Losson R. Lacroute F. Curr. Genet. 1980; 2: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 19Padilla P.A. Fuge E.K. Crawford M.E. Errett A. Werner- Washburne M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5718-5726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), underscoring the fact that the mechanistic basis of 6AU sensitivity is not well understood. Yeast deleted for ELP1 and ELP3, two genes encoding Elongator subunits, show delayed transcriptional induction in response to different environmental stimuli (9Otero G. Fellows J. Li Y. deBizemont T.

Inactivation of the elongation-related factor Spt5 when a conditional mutant strain is shifted to the nonpermissive temperature results in loss of some, but not all, pol II transcripts (11Hartzog G.A. Wada T. Handa H. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In related studies, yeast with a disruption of the SII gene (dst1) or a point mutation in the second largest subunit of pol II that reduces elongation rate (rpb2-10), are sensitive to the nucleotide-depleting drugs 6AU and mycophenolic acid (4Powell W. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6866-6873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 8Exinger F. Lacroute F. Curr.

Chem. 1992; 267: 13200-13204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These cells are compromised in their ability to induce transcription of the gene for IMP dehydrogenase, IMD2 (also known as PUR5) in response to 6AU treatment (12Shaw R.J. Reines D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7427-7437Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). As well, the rpb2-10mutation results in cold sensitivity and inositol auxotrophy, the latter phenotype is attributed to the inability to transcribeINO1 (21Scafe C. Nonet M. Young R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1010-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cells lacking functional SII and containing the slow elongation mutation display a synergistic sensitivity to 6AU. They also have reduced poly(A+) mRNA levels and reduced transcription of a number of genes compared with wild-type (5Lennon III, J.C. Wind M. Saunders L. Hock M.B. Reines D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5771-5779Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Relatively little is known about the spectrum of genes whose expression requires or is augmented by elongation factors in general and SII in particular. Cumulatively, these results suggest that one of the hallmarks of mutation in elongation factor genes is a slow transcriptional induction phenotype and a reduction in the efficiency of mRNA synthesis. Recently, a gene called SSM1(suppressor of 6-azauracil sensitivity of the SII null mutant 1) was identified in a high copy suppressor screen of the 6AUsphenotype of a DST1 deletant (22Shimoaraiso M. Nakanishi T. Kubo T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29623-29627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). SSM1expression is reduced in DST1 null yeast and is restored by SII expression (22Shimoaraiso M. Nakanishi T. Kubo T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29623-29627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Specific sequences in SSM1 that arrest transcription in vitro could explain why this gene requires SII for its transcription (22Shimoaraiso M. Nakanishi T. Kubo T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29623-29627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A pressing question is whether elongation factors contribute to the efficient transcription of many or most genes or if they are particularly important for the function of those genes with specific arrest sites. Here we have analyzed transcriptional induction in yeast bearing mutations in the elongation machinery. An advantage of this system is that the biochemical consequence of this mutation has been characterized as has the mechanism by which SII relieves arrestin vitro (2Wind M. Reines D. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The effect of 6AU on transcriptional responses, which is expected to slow elongation rates and promote arrest in vivo, was also assessed in wild-type and mutant cells. We find that gene induction is impaired in dst1 andrpb2-10 single mutants and the rpb2-10 dst1double mutant in the absence of drug and that this effect is exacerbated in the presence of 6AU. Finally, we measured the efficiency of transcription through a strong, well-characterized in vitro arrest site for yeast pol II in the presence and absence of 6AU. Surprisingly, the arrest site was ineffective in reducing transcriptional output in any strain in either the presence or absence of drug. That arrest sites defined in vitro were not particularly effective in vivo may reflect the fact that this type of elongation impediment is not rate-limiting in vivo. SII would therefore seem to participate in gene expression in a somewhat more general manner than would be expected considering the well described arrest-relieving activity of SII in vitro. An alternative mechanism may exist that prevents arrest in living cells. Nevertheless, SII and an efficiently elongating pol II have general effects in augmenting transcription in vivo. Strains used here are listed in Table I. Yeast transformation was performed as previously described (23Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2883) Google Scholar). The growth medium used for ENA1induction experiments was synthetic complete medium lacking uracil with glucose (SC-Ura + Glu), to which NaCl was added to a final concentration of 1 m. The growth medium for galactose induction experiments was SC-Ura with raffinose (2% w/v; SC-Ura + Raff) (24Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2537) Google Scholar), to which galactose was added to a final concentration of 2% (w/v). In the glucose repression experiments, glucose was added to a final concentration of 2% (w/v).Table IStrains usedStrainGenotypeDY103MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 his3Δ200 rpb2Δ297∷HIS3[pRP214 (RPB2 LEU2 CEN)] [pRS316 (URA3 CEN)]DY105MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 his3Δ200 rpb2Δ297∷HIS3[pRP2–10L (rpb2–10 LEU2 CEN)] [pRS316 (URA3 CEN)]DY106MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 his3Δ200 rpb2Δ297∷HIS3dst1∷hisG [pRP214 (RPB2 LEU2 CEN)] [pRS316 (URA3 CEN)]DY108MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 his3Δ200 rpb2Δ297∷HIS3dst1∷hisG[pRP2–10L (rpb2–10 LEU2 CEN)] [pRS316 (URA3 CEN)]DY500MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 his3Δ200 rpb2Δ297∷HIS3[pRP214 (RPB2 LEU2 CEN)] [pC1023 (URA3 2μ)]DY501MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 his3Δ200 rpb2Δ297∷HIS3dst1∷hisG [pRP214 (RPB2 LEU2 CEN)] [pC1023 (URA3 2μ)]DY502MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 his3Δ200 rpb2Δ297∷HIS3[pRP2–10L (rpb2–10 LEU2 CEN)] [pC1023 (URA3 2μ)]DY503MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 his3Δ200 rpb2Δ297∷HIS3dst1∷hisG [pRP2–10L (rpb2–10 LEU2 CEN)][pC1023 (URA3 2μ)]DY510MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 his3Δ200 rpb2Δ297∷HIS3[pRP214 (RPB2 LEU2 CEN)] [pC1024 (URA3 2μ)]DY511MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 his3Δ200 rpb2Δ297∷HIS3dst1∷hisG [pRP214 (RPB2 LEU2 CEN)] [pC1024 (URA3 2μ)]DY512MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 his3Δ200 rpb2Δ297∷HIS3[pRP2–10L (rpb2–10 LEU2 CEN)] [pC1024 (URA3 2μ)]DY513MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 his3Δ200 rpb2Δ297∷HIS3dst1∷hisG [pRP2–10L (rpb2–10 LEU2 CEN)] [pC1024 (URA3 2μ)]DY520MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 his3Δ200 rpb2Δ297∷HIS3[pRP214 (RPB2 LEU2 CEN)] [pYes2 (URA3 2μ)]DY521MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 his3Δ200 rpb2Δ297∷HIS3dst1∷hisG [pRP214 (RPB2 LEU2 CEN)] [pYes2 (URA3 2μ)]DY522MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 his3Δ200 rpb2Δ297∷HIS3[pRP2–10L (rpb2–10 LEU2 CEN)] [pYes2 (URA3 2μ)]DY523MATα ura3–52 leu2–3,112 his3Δ200 rpb2Δ297∷HIS3dst1∷hisG [pRP2–10L (rpb2–10 LEU2 CEN)] [pYes2 (URA3 2μ)] Open table in a new tab The plasmids pC1023 and pC1024 were made by inserting a ∼700-base pair fragment (XbaI/NdeI) containing two tandem Ia arrest sites from the plasmid pAdTerm2-2HH-HH (Reines et al., 1993) in the correct or inverse orientation, respectively, into the vector pYES2 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). RNA was prepared by the hot phenol extraction method and quantitated by measuring absorbance at 260 nm (25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology , Appendix 2. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, New York, NY1988Google Scholar). 15 μg of RNA per sample was run on a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to a Zeta-Probe GT nylon membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The filter was dried, baked at 80 °C under vacuum for 30 min, and cross-linked in a Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Filters were prehybridized for 3 h at 42 °C in 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution (25Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology , Appendix 2. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, New York, NY1988Google Scholar), 50% formamide, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. The filters were then hybridized with ∼100 ng of32P-labeled probes overnight at 42 °C, and washed twice at room temperature in 2× SSC/0.1% SDS for 5 min each, twice at room temperature in 0.2× SSC/0/1% SDS for 5 min each, and twice at 42 °C in 0.2× SSC/0.1% SDS for 15 min each. Additional washes (twice at 65 °C in 0.1× SSC/0.1% SDS for 15 min each) were performed for GAL1, SED1, and pC1023 and pC1024 Northern hybridizations. Filters were exposed to x-ray film and PhosphorImager screens. Quantitation was performed with a Fujifilm BAS1000 imaging system. The ENA1 probe was made using the PCR product amplified using the following primers: 5′-AGGTGCCGTTAACGATATCTGTTCTGA-3′ and 5′-CCATCTTAGTAGCAAACACTTGAATCG-3′, producing a 400-base pair probe. TheSED1 probe was made using a SmaI/EcoRI fragment from the SED1 gene. The GAL1 probe was made using the PCR product amplified from yeast genomic DNA using the following primers: 5′-TCTCGCGAAGAATTCACAAGAGAC-3′ and 5′-GCTGCCCAATGCTGGTTTAGAGAC-3′, producing a 467-base pair fragment. The pC1023/pC1024 probe was made using the PCR product amplified from pYES2 using the following primers: 5′-AATAGGGACCTAGACTTCAGG-3′ and 5′-CTGCAGATATCCATCACACTG-3′, producing a 150-base pair fragment. The probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dATP to a specific activity of ≈108 cpm/μg using random hexamer primers and Klenow DNA polymerase. Deletion of the Elongator subunit genes ELP1and ELP3 result in delayed transcriptional induction responses. To better understand the consequences of mutations that either slow pol II's elongation rate (rpb2-10) or remove SII from the cell (dst1), we tested strains bearing either or both of these changes for their ability to induce transcription of the sodium-inducible ENA1 gene, which encodes a sodium pump (26Haro R. Garciadeblas B. Rodriguez-Navarro A. FEBS Lett. 1991; 291: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Cultures were challenged with 1 m NaCl, and RNA was collected for Northern analysis. A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 1 A, and triplicate experiments are quantitated in Fig. 1 B. Yeast with no SII (dst1) were slightly defective in their ability to induceENA1 transcription relative to wild-type cells, showing a delay in reaching a maximal level of induction, which was below the wild-type yeast maxima. Yeast with a slowly elongating pol II (rpb2-10) had a similar, but more attenuated response than the dst1 disruptant. Cells with both of these mutations (rpb2-10 dst1) were quite severely defective in their ability to induce ENA1 transcription relative to wild-type cells. Another well-characterized induction system in yeast is that of galactose activation of GAL1 transcription. This response was examined in the elongation-defective strains described above. Galactose was added to cultures grown in raffinose, and RNA was subjected to Northern analysis. A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 2 A and triplet experiments were plotted in Fig. 2 B. Again we observed that yeast with mutations in the transcription elongation machinery (dst1, rpb2-10, and rpb2-10 dst1) were defective in their ability to induce transcription with respect to both the rate and extent of GAL1 mRNA synthesis. The double mutant strain (rpb2-10 dst1) was only able to induceGAL1 mRNA to ≈37% of the maximal wild-type level after 3 h of galactose exposure. Although the mutant strains were not able to attain wild-type levels of either ENA1 orGAL1 mRNA, they were able to grow on solid medium containing 1 m NaCl or galactose as their sole carbon source, respectively, suggesting that biologically significant amounts of gene product were ultimately produced in both cases (data not shown). Although these cells show reduced levels of total poly(A)+ mRNA (5Lennon III, J.C. Wind M. Saunders L. Hock M.B. Reines D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5771-5779Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the induction defects shown here provide more direct evidence of a transcriptional defect in these cells, which is notable, because it is observed in the absence of any drug treatment. 6-Azauracil (6AU) is thought to decrease the elongation rate of transcribing pol II in vivo because of its ability to inhibit the enzymes that generate nucleoside triphosphates, thereby producing effects similar to defects in the elongation machinery (3Archambault J. Lacroute F. Ruet A. Friesen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4142-4152Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 8Exinger F. Lacroute F. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). To determine whether 6AU would phenocopy the effect of the rpb2-10 and/or dst1mutations upon GAL1 induction, yeast were treated with 6AU for 30 min, galactose was added, and RNA was prepared for Northern analysis (Fig. 3 A). The single and double mutant strains were significantly impaired in both the rate and extent of induction in the presence of drug (Fig. 2 versus Fig. 3). In the absence of 6AU, the single mutants achieved 72% of wild-type GAL1 mRNA levels (Fig.2 B) versus 35–55% in the presence of drug (Fig.3 B). The rpb2-10 dst1 double mutant achieved maximal induction ≈37% of wild-type in the absence of drug (Fig.2 B) and 10% in its presence (Fig. 3 B). These results provide additional evidence that 6AU affects transcription, and it does so in a manner similar to mutations in the elongation machinery, consistent with the idea that it slows transcription elongation in vivo subsequent to nucleotide depletion. The reduced amount of GAL1transcript observed in these mutant strains could be attributed to an alteration at one of several steps, including the initiation of transcription of GAL1, elongation through GAL1, mRNA export, or degradation of the transcript. To test if an increase in the level of mRNA degradation could account for the reduced level of GAL1 mRNA in the mutant strains, we used glucose to repress GAL1 initiation. This repression mechanism acts by preventing the recruitment of TBP and pol II to the gene and results in cessation of transcriptional initiation (27Johnston M. Flick J.S. Pexton T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3834-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 28Kuras L. Struhl K. Nature. 1999; 399: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 29Li X.Y. Virbasius A. Zhu X. Green M.R. Nature. 1999; 399: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).GAL1 transcription was induced for 2 h with galactose then repressed by addition of glucose to growing cultures. RNA was collected at various times after shut off and its rate of disappearance was analyzed by Northern blotting (Fig.4 A, quantitated in triplicate in Fig. 4 B). This experiment shows that the GAL1transcript is present for a longer period of time after glucose shutoff in elongation-defective yeast (both single and double mutants) than in wild-type yeast. The transcript disappeared the least rapidly in therpb2-10 dst1 double mutant, somewhat faster in therpb2-10 mutant, and the closest to wild-type for thedst1 disruptant (Fig. 4 B). This is not consistent with the model in which the reduced level of mRNA seen upon galactose induction in these mutant strains results from an increase in the rate of transcript degradation (Fig. 2). On the contrary, mRNA levels disappeared more slowly in the mutant strains with the double mutant showing the slowest rate of mRNA loss. Because 6AU treatment affected the induction ofGAL1 in a manner similar to that of the mutants, we explored the possibility that 6AU treatment also had an effect similar to that of the mutations on the rate of GAL1 transcript disappearance. Galactose-induced cultures were treated with 75 μg/ml 6AU for 30 min before glucose was added. RNA was prepared for Northern analysis at times thereafter (Fig. 5). 6AU slowed the rate of transcript disappearance in wild-type cells to a rate similar to that of untreated double mutant yeast (rpb2-10 dst1). The rate of disappearance of the GAL1 transcript in the double mutant yeast (rpb2-10 dst1) was also slowed further when treated with 6AU. These data are again consistent with the idea that 6AU phenocopies mutations that perturb transcription elongation and does not operate by increasing the rate of transcript degradation, in further support of the model that delayedGAL1 induction in the rpb2-10 dst1 mutant yeast (Fig. 2) is not due to an increase in GAL1 transcript degradation. The fact that 6AU can make more extreme the defects seen in the rpb2-10 dst1 strain suggests that the process slowed by the drug is additive with the effect of mutations in the transcription elongation pathway. We initially presumed that these elongation mutations and 6AU treatment operated by depleting nucleotides, slowing elongation, enhancing arrest, and reducing the ability of pol II to bypass blocks to elongation, all of which should exacerbate arrest site readthrough in vivo. Presumably, a gene's transcription level in this case would be related to the number or location of pause or arrest site sequences within it. Until recently, no arrest sites have been described in yeast gene sequences in vitro nor shown to operate in vivo (22Shimoaraiso M. Nakanishi T. Kubo T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29623-29627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Hence, we set out to analyzein vivo a well-characterized arrest site (called site Ia; originally derived from a human histone gene), which is known to efficiently arrest transcription by yeast and mammalian pol II as well as phage and bacterial RNA polymerases in vitro (4Powell W. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6866-6873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 30Reines D. Wells D. Chamberlin M.J. Kane C.M. J. Mol.

High copy yeast plasmids were constructed containing a tandem arrangement of two Ia arrest sites inserted downstream of theGAL1 promoter and upstream of the CYC1polyadenylation/termination signals (pC1023; Fig.6). Two consecutive Ia sites function additively in stopping 75% of the polymerase enzymes that encounter them in vitro (36Reines D. Ghanouni P. Gu W. Mote Jr., J. Powell W. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 331-338PubMed Google Scholar). Arrest of pol II at the first or second site would generate 355- and 577-nucleotide transcripts, respectively. As a control, the tandem Ia sites were inserted in the inverse orientation, because its arrest function is strictly orientation-dependent in vitro (pC1024; Fig. 6) (36Reines D. Ghanouni P. Gu W. Mote Jr., J. Powell W. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 331-338PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids pC1023 and pC1024, as well as the empty vector (pYES2), were individually transformed into wild-type cells and strains with thedst1 and/or rpb2-10 mutations (TableI). Cells were induced with galactose for 1 h, and RNA was collected for Northern analysis using a probe that hybridizes downstream of the Ia sequences (Fig. 6). This probe would detect differences in the total amount of full-length transcript produced. The mutant strains show lower overall levels of transcript than wild-type cells, as expected from the induction defect of the mutants described above (Fig. 2). To facilitate comparison between replicate Northern blot experiments, we measured the amount of full-length transcript that contains the arrest sites in the arresting orientation (pC1023) to that derived from the plasmid with the Ia sites in the nonarresting (pC1024) orientation. Each of these values were divided by the amount of transcript produced by the wild-type strain harboring the vector lacking Ia sites. No significant difference was seen in the relative ability of any strain to transcribe through the Ia site in the correct (arresting) versus the inverse (nonarresting) orientation (Fig.7 A; two-tailed ttest, p > 0.025). In other words, within a strain, the level of full-length transcript containing the Ia insert in the sense orientation was similar to that generated from the plasmid with the Ia array in the inverse orientation (Fig. 7 B). Using a probe complementary to the transcript upstream of the inserted Ia sequences, we were unable to detect shortened transcripts of the size expected if pol II became arrested at the Ia sites (data not shown). This indicates that an in vitro arrest site does not have a strong effect upon transcription in vivo.Figure 7Transcripti"
