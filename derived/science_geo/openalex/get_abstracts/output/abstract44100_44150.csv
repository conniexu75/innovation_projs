https://openalex.org/W2108949591,"Six cytoplasmic che gene products are required for signal transduction in bacterial chemotaxis, but the nature of their biochemical interactions is not known. We show that in vitro the CheA protein becomes autophosphorylated in the presence of ATP. In addition, the phosphate group on CheA can be rapidly transferred to CheB, a protein involved in adaptation to stimuli, or to CheY, a protein involved in the excitation response. The phosphorylation of CheB and CheY is transient; they readily dephosphorylate. We have also found that CheZ, a protein that appears to antagonize CheY function in vivo, accelerates the hydrolysis of the phosphate on CheY. These results suggest that signal transduction in bacterial chemotaxis may involve the flow of phosphate through a cascade of phosphorylated protein intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W1999298531,"The T cell antigen receptor is composed of two variable chains (α and β termed Ti), which confer ligand specificity, and five constant chains (γ, δ, ε, ζ, and p21, collectively termed CD3) whose functions are poorly understood. To explore the roles of the individual CD3 components, an antigen-specific murine T cell hybridoma was chemically mutagenized and antigen-induced growth inhibition was used to select CD3/Ti expression variants. One variant produced all CD3/Ti components except CD3-ζ and was able to express small amounts of surface CD3/Ti. This variant failed to respond normally to either antigen or a mitogenic anti-Thy-1 antibody. Surprisingly, in the absence of CD3-ζ, direct cross-linking of the partial receptor induced both phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and interleukin 2 production. These data indicate that CD3-ζ determines the normal intracellular fate of the T cell antigen receptor and is likely to play an important role in physiologically relevant transmembrane signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2003197672,"Cellular ras activity has been neutralized in 3T3 cells by microinjection of a specific anti-ras monoclonal antibody. The injected antibody efficiently inhibited proliferation in cells treated with a phorbol ester and a calcium ionophore, or with prostaglandin F2α. These treatments were designed to imitate the action of phospholipase C or of phospholipase A2. In addition, the highly efficient mitogenic potential of phosphatidic acid was inhibited by the injected antibody even more efficiently than was serum-induced proliferation. The close reliance of phospholipid-induced mitogenesis upon ras activity suggests that ras proteins are unlikely to function to control the action of a phospholipase."
https://openalex.org/W2057579672,"Peroxisomes are apparently missing in Zellweger syndrome; nevertheless, some of the integral membrane proteins of the organelle are present. Their distribution was studied by immunofluorescence microscopy. In control fibroblasts, peroxisomes appeared as small dots. In Zellweger fibroblasts, the peroxisomal membrane proteins were located in unusual empty membrane structures of larger size. These results suggest that the primary defect in this disease may be in the mechanism for import of matrix proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2006220169,"IME1 (Inducer of MEiosis) was cloned due to its high copy number effect: it enabled MAT insufficient strains to undergo meiosis. Disruption of IME1 results in a recessive Spo- phenotype. Diploids homozygous for the two mutations ime1-0, rme1-1 are also meiosis deficient. We conclude that IME1 is a positive regulator of meiosis that normally is repressed by RME1. RME1 is repressed by a complex of MATa1 and MAT alpha 2 gene products. IME1 is also regulated by the environment: no transcripts could be detected in glucose growing cells, in contrast to acetate growing cells. Starvation for nitrogen further induced (6- to 8-fold) transcription of IME1, but, as expected, the induction was found only in MATa/MAT alpha or rme1-1/rme1-1 diploids. Furthermore, the IME1 multicopy plasmids promoted sporulation in rich media."
https://openalex.org/W2080476991,"The T cell antigen receptor is a multi-subunit receptor complex present on the surface of all mature and many developing T cells. It consists of clonotypic heterodimers noncovalently linked to five invariant chains that are encoded by four genes and referred to as the CD3 complex. The CD3 gamma, delta, and epsilon chains have been molecularly characterized. In this report the molecular cloning of a complementary DNA encoding the zeta chain of the murine T cell antigen receptor is described. The predicted protein sequence of the zeta chain suggests a structure distinct from those of any of the previously described receptor subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2056315045,"The S. cerevisiae HAP2 and HAP3 gene products have been shown to recognize CCAAT-containing transcription elements as a HAP2/HAP3 multisubunit heterologous complex, or heteromer. Recently, we have demonstrated that the human sequence-specific DNA-binding protein, CPi, also recognizes CCAAT-containing transcription elements as a heteromer. Mammalian cells contain at least three distinct CCAAT-binding proteins, all of which appear to be multisubunit complexes composed of heterologous subunits. One of these proteins, CP1, has DNA-binding properties that are virtually identical to the yeast HAP2/HAP3 complex. These two proteins bind to the same target sequences, make the same DNA contacts, and are affected in a similar manner by mutations in the CCAAT element. Most surprisingly, the subunits of CP1 and HAP2/HAP3 are functionally interchangeable. That is, the yeast/human hybrid complexes that are formed retain the ability to specifically recognize CCAAT elements."
https://openalex.org/W2002947112,"Immunization with radiation-attenuated malaria sporozoites induces potent cellular immune responses, but the target antigens are unknown and have not previously been elicited by subunit vaccines prepared from the circumsporozoite (CS) protein. A method is described here for inducing protective cell-mediated immunity to sporozoites by immunization with attenuated Salmonella typhimurium transformed with the Plasmodium berghei CS gene. These transformants constitutively express CS antigens and, when used to immunize mice orally, colonize the liver, induce antigen-specific cell-mediated immunity, and protect mice against sporozoite challenge in the absence of antisporozoite antibodies. These data indicate that the CS protein contains T cell epitopes capable of inducing protective cell-mediated immunity, and emphasize the importance of proper antigen presentation in generating this response. Analogous, orally administered vaccines against human malaria might be feasible."
https://openalex.org/W2083445717,"The protein kinase inhibitor 2-aminopurine (2AP) blocks the induction of the human β-interferon gene by virus or poly(I)-poly(C) at the level of transcription. This inhibition is specific, since 2AP does not inhibit induction of either the hsp70 heat-shock gene by high temperature or the metallothionein gene by cadmium or dexamethasone. However, 2AP does block the induction of the fos and c-myc proto-oncogenes by serum growth factors or virus, suggesting that a protein kinase may be involved in the regulation of these genes, as well as of the β-interferon gene. However, different factors must be required for the induction of these three genes, since they are not coordinately regulated by the same inducers in most of the cell lines examined."
https://openalex.org/W1510285205,"Monoclonal antibodies raised against rabbit brain protein kinase C were classified into at least three types, MC-1a, MC-2a, and MC-3a, which selectively interact with hydroxyapatite column chromatographically resolved isozymes type I, II, and III of protein kinase C, respectively, determined on the basis of immunoblotting experiments. Immunoprecipitating analysis revealed that MC-1a, -2a, and -3a interacted with protein kinase C expressed in the brain and MC-2a and -3a, but MC-1a immunoprecipitated the protein kinase from rabbit spleen. Immunocytochemical localization of the protein kinase isozymes in the rabbit cerebellum and spleen was studied using these monoclonal antibodies. Staining with MC-1a was restricted to Purkinje cells of the rabbit cerebellum, and there was no reaction product in the Purkinje cells with either MC-2a or MC-3a. Cells in the granular layer of the cerebellum were labeled with MC-2a, and oligodendroglia in the white matter of the cerebellum was stained with MC-3a. The rabbit spleen contained no product reacting with MC-1a, but MC-2a and MC-3a reacted with lymphocytes in the mantle zone and the periarterial lymphatic sheath of the white pulp, respectively. These results suggest that expression of the protein kinase C isozyme in the rabbit cerebellum may depend on the cell type."

https://openalex.org/W2050714750,"The chloroplast psaA gene of the green unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii consists of three exons that are transcribed from different strands. Analysis of numerous nuclear and chloroplast mutants that are deficient in photosystem I activity reveals that roughly one-quarter of them are specifically affected in psaA mRNA maturation. These mutants can be grouped into three phenotypic classes, based on their inability to perform either one or both splicing reactions. The data indicate that the three exons are transcribed independently as precursors which are normally assembled in trans and that the splicing reactions can occur in either order. While some chloroplast mutations could act in cis, the nuclear mutations that fall into several complementation groups probably affect factors specifically required for assembling psaA mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2035814440,"The twitcher mouse is an animal model of galactosylceramidase deficiency, comparable to Krabbe's disease, a lysosomal storage disease in humans. As in most lysosomal storage diseases, neurological deterioration is a prominent feature of the disease in these mice. Transplantation of enzymatically normal congenic bone marrow was earlier found to result in prolonged survival and increased levels of galactosylceramidase in the visceral organs of twitcher mice. It is now reported that bone marrow transplantation results in increased galactosylceramidase levels in the central nervous system (CNS). Concomitantly, the levels of psychosine, a highly toxic lipid that progressively accumulates in the CNS of untreated twitcher mice, stabilized at much lower levels in the CNS of treated twitcher mice. Histologically, a gradual disappearance of globoid cells, the histological hallmark of Krabbe's disease, and the appearance of foamy macrophages capable of metabolizing the storage product were seen in the CNS. By immunohistochemical labeling it was demonstrated that these foamy macrophages were of donor origin. The infiltration of enzymatically competent, donor-derived macrophages was accompanied by extensive remyelination in the CNS. It is concluded that after bone marrow transplantation, donor-derived macrophages infiltrate the affected brain tissue and are capable of inducing a partial reversal of the enzyme deficiency."

https://openalex.org/W2026681155,"The stability of ompA mRNA is growth-rate dependent. We show that the 5′ noncoding region of this mRNA provides a target for site-specific endonucleases. The rate of degradation of ompA mRNA parallels the rate of these endonucleolytic cleavages, implying that endonucleolytic rather than exonucleolytic attack is the initial step in ompA mRNA degradation. Thus the 5′ noncoding region appears to be a determinant of mRNA stability, and endonucleolytic cleavages in the 5′ noncoding region may well regulate expression of the ompA gene."
https://openalex.org/W1501619406,"We have extended our investigations of the multiple binding modes that form between the Escherichia coli single strand binding (SSB) protein and single-stranded DNA (Lohman, T. M. & Overman, L. B. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 3594-3603; Bujalowski, W. & Lohman, T. M. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 7799-7802) by examining the effects of anions, pH, BaCl2, and protein binding density on the transitions among these binding modes. Reverse titrations that monitor the quenching of the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the SSB protein upon addition of poly(dT) have been used to measure the apparent site size of the complex at 25 degrees C in pH 8.1 and 6.9 as a function of NaF, NaCl, NaBr, and MgCl2 concentrations. Under all conditions in which reverse titrations were performed, we observe three distinct binding modes with site sizes of 35 +/- 2, 56 +/- 3, and 65 +/- 3 nucleotides/SSB tetramer; however, the transitions among the three binding modes are strongly dependent upon both the cation and anion valence, type, and concentration as well as the pH. A net uptake of both cations and anions accompanies the transitions from the (SSB)35 to the (SSB)56 binding mode at pH 6.9, whereas at pH 8.1 this transition is anion-independent, and only a net uptake of cations occurs. The transition from the (SSB)56 to the (SSB)65 binding mode is dependent upon both cations and anions at both pH 6.9 and 8.1 (25 degrees C), and a net uptake of both cations and anions accompanies this transition. We have also examined the transitions by monitoring the change in the sedimentation coefficient of the SSB protein-poly(dT) complex as a function of MgCl2 concentration (20 degrees C, pH 8.1) and observe an increase in s20,w, which coincides with the increase in apparent site size of the complex, as measured by fluorescence titrations. The frictional coefficient of the complex decreases by a factor of two in progressing from the (SSB)35 to the (SSB)65 binding mode, indicating a progressive compaction of the complex throughout the transition. The transition between the (SSB)35 and the (SSB)56 complex is dependent on the protein binding density, with the lower site size (SSB)35 complex favored at higher binding density. These results indicate that the transitions among the various SSB protein-single-stranded DNA binding modes are complex processes that depend on a number of solution variables that are thermodynamically linked.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1616429637,"NIH 3T3 cells transformed with the human c-Ha-rasVal-12 oncogene showed markedly enhanced activity of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the key enzyme of polyamine biosynthesis, as compared with their nontransformed counterparts. While in normal and in c-Ha-ras proto-oncogene-transfected cells stimulation with serum caused a transient induction of ODC, in cells transfected with the mutant c-Ha-ras oncogene the activity of ODC persisted at high levels for greatly extended periods of time. The amounts of immunoreactive ODC protein roughly paralleled the changes in the enzyme activity. The augmentation of ODC content by transformation could be largely, but not solely, accounted for by an enhanced accumulation of ODC mRNA. Nuclear run-off transcription assays demonstrated that in transformed cells the rate of transcription of the ODC gene was increased but to a much lower extent than the increase in the level of ODC mRNA. The turnover of ODC mRNA, as measured after actinomycin D treatment, was negligible in transformed cells for up to 8 h, whereas in normal cells the messenger content was initially decreased, by 40% within 4 h, and then remained constant. In normal cells, however, actinomycin D depressed the expression of ODC by more than 80%, while in transformed cells the activity of ODC was slightly superinduced, corresponding to the changes of ODC mRNA. These findings suggest that labile proteins may be involved in the regulation of both the stability and translatability of the ODC mRNA. Transformation led also to about 3-fold stabilization of ODC as determined by an exposure of the cells to cycloheximide. The results thus suggest ODC deregulation at multiple levels in the ras-oncogene-transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W1518920838,"A cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) of apparent Mr 74,000 has recently been purified from human plasma. Three monoclonal neutralizing antibodies to the CETP were obtained by immunizing mice with purified CETP. The antibodies, each recognizing a similar epitope on CETP, caused parallel and complete immunotitration of plasma cholesteryl ester and triglyceride transfer activities but only partial inhibition of phospholipid transfer activity. Monoclonal immunoaffinity chromatography of plasma or its fractions showed complete removal of cholesteryl ester and triglyceride transfer activities but incomplete removal of phospholipid transfer activity. Sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting of the immunoaffinity-retained fractions showed that only the Mr 74,000 protein was immunoreactive. The results suggest that the previously characterized CETP accounts for all of the cholesteryl ester and triglyceride transfer activity in human plasma but only part of the phospholipid transfer activity."

https://openalex.org/W1639558802,"We have investigated the association of the glucocorticoid receptor in S49 mouse lymphoma cells with the 90-kDa heat shock protein, HSP 90. Proteins were synthetically labeled by culturing cells with [35S]methionine and immunoadsorbed to protein A-Sepharose using monoclonal antireceptor antibody (BuGR-2). HSP 90 coimmunoadsorbed with the receptor when cytosol was incubated with antireceptor antibody for 1 h in the absence of molybdate, indicating that molybdate is not required for either formation or recovery of HSP 90-receptor complexes. Molybdate stabilized HSP 90-receptor complexes during prolonged incubation in vitro and rendered the complexes resistant to dissociation by 500 mM NaCl. In pulse-chase experiments, cells were incubated with [35S]methionine for 30 min (pulse label) and then cultured with excess unlabeled methionine (chase). At different times in the chase, cytosol was prepared from cells, and labeled proteins were immunoadsorbed by antireceptor antibody. The amount of labeled receptor recovered from cytosol decreased during the chase with a half-life of about 4 h. Labeled HSP 90 coimmunoadsorbed with the receptor at 4 h into the chase but not at the beginning of the chase or at 2 h into the chase, indicating that newly synthesized HSP 90 associated with the receptor in a time-dependent manner during the chase. Labeled HSP 90 did not associate with the receptor when dexamethasone was added to cells at the beginning of the chase. These findings support the hypothesis that HSP 90 associates with the glucocorticoid receptor in intact cells rather than in cytosol and indicates that dexamethasone promotes dissociation of HSP 90-receptor complexes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1665591202,"The glycoprotein Ib.IX complex is a major component of the platelet membrane. It mediates the adhesion of platelets to exposed subendothelium and provides an attachment site for the membrane skeleton on the plasma membrane. The present study was designed to characterize the structure of the glycoprotein Ib.IX complex. Electron microscopy of purified glycoprotein Ib.IX complex in detergent showed that each complex existed as a flexible rod with a globular domain on either end. The overall length of the complex was approximately 59.5 nm. The smaller globular domain had a diameter of approximately 8.9 nm; the larger, a diameter of approximately 15.9 nm. In the absence of detergent, the glycoprotein Ib.IX complexes tended to self-associate through the larger globular domain, suggesting that this domain contained the hydrophobic region that inserts into the membrane. Proteases known to cleave glycoprotein Ib alpha close to its membrane-insertion site released the larger globular domain. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that this domain was composed of glycoprotein Ib beta, glycoprotein IX, and a Mr = 25,000 fragment of glycoprotein Ib alpha. Proteolysis at the external end of glycoprotein Ib alpha reduced the size of the smaller globular domain. This study shows that the glycoprotein Ib.IX complex has an elongated shape, with a globular domain on the end that inserts into the membrane and a smaller globular domain on the end of glycoprotein Ib alpha that is oriented external to the plasma membrane."

Following fractionation of cell extracts into soluble and membrane components, CO-dependent H2 evolution and CO-dependent methyl-coenzyme M methylreductase activities were only present in the soluble fraction, but addition of the membrane fraction enhanced both activities. A b-type cytochrome(s), present in the membrane fraction, was linked to a membrane-bound hydrogenase. CO-oxidizing:H2-evolving activity was reconstituted with: (i) CO dehydrogenase complex, (ii) a ferredoxin, and (iii) purified membranes with associated hydrogenase. The ferredoxin was a direct electron acceptor for the CO dehydrogenase complex. The ferredoxin also coupled CO oxidation by CO dehydrogenase complex to metronidazole reduction."
https://openalex.org/W1614710733,"Linkage of ricin A chain (RA) to a cell surface binding antibody or other ligand can result in a potent cytotoxic agent. We expressed the primary sequence for RA in Escherichia coli to facilitate production and to obtain protein free of naturally occurring contaminants, i.e. ricin B chain. Differences in the level of expression and in the characteristics of the expressed protein were noted when several different host/vector systems were tested. Recombinant RA (rRA) was expressed directly under control of the phage lambda major leftward promoter (PL) and the E. coli trp promoter. It was also expressed fused to E. coli alkaline phosphatase sequences, both in the same reading frame for secretion and out-of-reading frame for expression in a cistron-like arrangement. Expression in the PL promoter system, which is temperature-regulated, was achieved at 37 degrees C as well as at 42 degrees C. The protein expressed at these different temperatures had grossly different properties. Whereas rRA expressed at 37 degrees C was soluble and fully active, that produced at 42 degrees C was aggregated, insoluble, and reduced in activity. Soluble rRA could be converted to the insoluble form by incubation at 42 degrees C in vivo, but not in vitro. Hence, this difference in properties does not simply reflect an inherent thermal instability of the protein. Conditions present in vivo, including the possible association with other proteins, are apparently required for this effect on rRA."
https://openalex.org/W1566092281,"The cytoplasmic calcium concentration (Ca2+i) was measured in suspensions of fura-2-loaded mouse pancreatic beta-cells by recording the 340:380 nm fluorescence excitation ratio. Exposure to 20 mM glucose resulted in an initial reduction and later increase of Ca2+i irrespective of preincubation in medium containing 0.5 or 1.28 mM Ca2+ and 0 or 3 mM glucose. When elevating the Ca2+ concentration to 5 or 10 mM only 5 min before raising glucose to 20 mM, the sugar-induced reduction of Ca2+i became more pronounced like the subsequent increase. However, when the Ca2+ concentration was increased from 1.28 to 10 mM 2 min after stimulation with glucose, there was a sudden pronounced Ca2+i transient, which was followed by a decrease and a slower secondary rise. After preincubation in 20 mM glucose the glucose-induced initial reduction of Ca2+i was only seen in a Ca2+-deficient medium. Reintroduction of the sugar in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ resulted in an immediate rise of Ca2+i, the rapidity of which depended on the transmembrane Ca2+ gradient. The results emphasize the role of a saturable beta-cell pool of Ca2+ in glucose-induced reduction of Ca2+i and indicate that the first phase of insulin release depends on an influx of extracellular Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W2019644042,"The centromere of chromosome III (CEN3) of yeast has been examined for its ability to inhibit meiotic recombination in adjacent sequences. The effect of the centromere was investigated when it was adjacent to both of the recombining sequences (homozygous) or adjacent to only one of the two recombining DNA segments (hemizygous). When homozygous, CEN3 exerts a bidirectional repression of crossing over and a strong inhibition of gene conversion. This suggests that CEN3 reduces the frequency of crossing over by interfering with the initiation of proximal recombination events. When hemizygous, CEN3 impairs the ability of adjacent sequences to act as the recipient of genetic information during gene conversion. These results support the idea that the initiating event in yeast meiotic recombination involves the recipient molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1555119217,"Rat alveolar macrophages secrete a growth factor that renders rat lung fibroblasts competent to initiate DNA synthesis in vitro in the presence of platelet-poor plasma. This biological activity resembles that of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). After separation from putative associated binding proteins by chromatography under acidic conditions, the macrophage-derived factor exhibited a relative molecular weight similar to that of highly purified human PDGF. The factor bound to a monospecific antibody to human PDGF and thus could be quantitated in an enzyme immunoassay for PDGF. It competed with radiolabeled human PDGF for receptor sites for PDGF on rat lung fibroblasts, and binding to these receptor sites could be specifically inhibited by anti-PDGF. These data strongly support the view that the factor derived from rat alveolar macrophages is homologous to human PDGF and is similar to human macrophage-derived PDGF-like growth factor. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the lung contains both an effector cell (pulmonary macrophage) and a potential target cell (interstitial fibroblast) for this cytokine. Therefore the rat appears to be an appropriate animal model in which to study macrophage-derived PDGF-like growth factors as mediators of proliferation in pulmonary fibrogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W341831761,"The translocation into Escherichia coli cytoplasmic membrane vesicles of a protein containing an uncleavable signal peptide was studied. The signal peptide cleavage site of the ompF-lpp chimeric protein, a model secretory protein, was changed from Ala-Ala to Phe-Pro through oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis of the ompF-lpp gene on a plasmid. The mutant protein was no longer processed by the signal peptidase. When proteinase K treatment was adopted as a probe for protein translocation into inverted membrane vesicles, the mutant protein exhibited rapid and almost complete translocation, most likely due to the lack of premature cleavage of the signal peptide before the translocation. This result also indicates that cleavage of the signal peptide is not required for translocation of the mature domain of the protein. The establishment of an efficient system made it possible to perform precise and quantitative analysis of the translocation process. The translocation was time-dependent, vesicle-dependent, and required ATP and NADH. Translocation into membrane vesicles was also observed with the uncleavable precursor protein purified by means of immunoaffinity chromatography, although the efficiency was appreciably low. The translocation required only ATP and NADH. Addition of the cytosolic fraction did not enhance the translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1590665808,"Polyclonal antibodies directed against a synthetic octapeptide of the cAMP-dependent phosphorylation site of the ribosomal protein S6 of rat liver were used to screen a lambda gt11 cDNA expression library of human lymphoblasts. An S6 specific clone was isolated. It consists of the complete coding sequence of 747 base pairs and the 3' noncoding region of 40 base pairs. The sequence of 249 amino acids was deduced from the nucleotide sequence. The amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions are almost identical to the reported partial peptide sequences of rat liver S6. The yeast protein S10 is homologous to the human S6 with the exception of 3 amino acid insertions and a carboxyl-terminal extension of 10 amino acids within the human S6. The only two phosphorylation sites at the carboxyl terminus of yeast S10 are homologous to the two cAMP-dependent sites in human S6. Since there are additional phosphorylation sites in mammalian S6, one can assume that they are located in the cluster of 5 serines within the carboxyl-terminal extension. The sequence comparison of these two ribosomal proteins from evolutionarily distant eucaryotes, such as man and yeast, indicates that the structure and probably the function of the phosphoprotein S6 of the small ribosomal subunit has been highly conserved. The expression of the S6 gene has been investigated in proliferating lymphocytes stimulated by concanavalin A. During all stages of lymphoblast development the level of S6 mRNA appeared to be similar. Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNA suggests that multiple genes exist for the S6 protein."
https://openalex.org/W348360137,"Yeast alpha-mannosidase, a marker enzyme of vacuolar membranes, was solubilized and purified from commercial bakers' yeast. The alpha-mannosidase was solubilized efficiently with 10 mM Na2CO3. A high pH (greater than 8.5) and a sufficient amount of a detergent such as 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100 were required to keep the enzyme in a soluble state. This suggested that the enzyme is either a peripheral membrane protein or an ecto-type integral membrane protein. After 4,300-fold purification by conventional chromatography, the alpha-mannosidase gave a single band on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, but could be fractionated into active isoforms, which consisted of 107-, 73-, and 31-kDa polypeptides, with a Mono Q anion exchange fast protein liquid chromatography system. Apparent molecular weight of the native enzyme was determined as 560,000. It suggested that the composition of isoforms will be described as (107 kDa)n (73 kDa)6-n (31 kDa)6-n, where n is 0-6. The 107- and 73-kDa polypeptides were purified further under denaturing conditions. One-dimensional peptide map analysis and immunological analysis of these polypeptides indicated that they are closely related proteins. Immunoblotting of crude cell lysates revealed that the 107-kDa polypeptide appeared first, and then the 73-kDa polypeptide appeared along growth phase. It suggested that proteolytic conversion of the 107-kDa polypeptide occurs to form the 73- and 31-kDa polypeptides and leads to formation of isoforms of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1552679349,"The manganese-containing superoxide dismutase in Escherichia coli is an inducible enzyme that protects cells against oxygen toxicity. The manganese-enzyme is induced by oxygen, nitrate, redox active compounds that react with oxygen to generate superoxide radicals, as well as iron chelators. In order to test the hypothesis that the redox state of the cell is involved in regulating manganese-superoxide dismutase biosynthesis, we studied the effects of several oxidants on growth and superoxide dismutase biosynthesis. The data showed, that under anaerobic conditions, the active manganese-enzyme is induced in the presence of potassium ferricyanide, copper-cyanide complex, ammonium persulfate, and hydrogen peroxide. Western blot analysis revealed that the induction of manganese-superoxide dismutase by the oxidants is associated with de novo protein biosynthesis. Potassium ferricyanide and hydrogen peroxide induced the enzyme under aerobic conditions as well. It is concluded that the redox state of the cell possibly influences the biosynthesis and/or activity of an iron-containing repressor protein that serves to negatively regulate manganese-superoxide dismutase biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1503950878,"Escherichia coli growing anaerobically respond to NO3- with a 3-fold induction of the iron-containing superoxide dismutase. Mutants lacking nitrate reductase do not show this response. Anaerobically grown cells also contain an inactive form of the manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) which can be activated by addition of Mn(II) salts in the presence of acidic guanidinium chloride, followed by dialysis against neutral buffer. Direct addition of Mn(II) to a neutral solution of the inactive MnSOD does not impart activity. This inactive MnSOD thus behaves as would the apoenzyme or the enzyme bearing a metal other than Mn(II) at its active sites. Terminal electron acceptors, such as NO3- or trimethylamine N-oxide, increase the amount of inactive MnSOD produced by anaerobic E. coli. Paraquat, which is itself ineffective in this regard, markedly augments the effect of these terminal electron acceptors. It appears that flow of electrons to sinks such as NO3- or trimethylamine N-oxide, facilitated by paraquat, is sufficient to elicit biosynthesis of the MnSOD protein and that O2- is not needed for this process. Yet, oxygenation and concomitant O2- production do appear important for the insertion of manganese into the growing MnSOD polypeptide, possibly because O-2 oxidizes Mn(II) to Mn(III), and the latter is the valence state most effective in combining with the apoenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1479952490,"The cytochrome d complex is a component of the aerobic respiratory system of Escherichia coli. The enzyme functions as a terminal oxidase, oxidizing ubiquinol-8 within the cytoplasmic membrane and reducing oxygen to water. The enzyme is of particular interest because it is a coupling site in the electron transfer chain. The electron transfer reaction catalyzed by this enzyme is coupled to the translocations of protons across the membrane (H+/e-approximately equal to 1). The oxidase contains two subunits by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, with molecular weights of 58,000 and 43,000. In this paper, the question of the quaternary structure is addressed. Quantitative N-terminal analysis of the isolated enzyme and relative mass quantitation following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicate the subunits are present in equimolar amounts. Sedimentation velocity and sedimentation equilibrium studies were used to characterize the hydrodynamic properties of the purified enzyme solubilized in Triton X-100, under conditions where the enzyme is active. It is concluded that the active enzyme in Triton X-100 is a heterodimer, containing one copy of each subunit. This is likely the structure of the enzyme in the E. coli membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1493843197,"New systematic methods developed for equilibrium isotope exchange kinetics have been used to analyze the effects of activator ATP and inhibitor CTP with Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase. This indepth approach requires (a) variation of [modifier] with fixed subsaturating levels of substrates, and (b) variation of at least three combinations of reactant-product pairs in constant ratio at equilibrium: [A,B,P,Q], [A,P], and [B,Q] with the co-substrates held constant, in the presence and absence of added modifier. Both ATP and CTP had much stronger effects on the [14C]Asp in equilibrium C-Asp exchange rate than on [32P]C-P in equilibrium Pi. The bisubstrate analog N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate activated, then inhibited, Asp in equilibrium C-Asp more strongly than C-P in equilibrium Pi. N-Phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate gave complete (100%) inhibition, whereas CTP inhibition of either exchange was only partial. Substrate saturation curves in the presence and absence of effectors indicate that ATP and CTP perturb the observed values of Rmax and S0.5 in different fashions without appreciably changing the observed Hill number. Computer simulations indicate that the primary site of ATP and CTP action is the association rate for Asp, not the allosteric T-R transition. This finding is substantiated by previous studies in which modified aspartate transcarbamoylase had lost cooperative Asp binding without loss of sensitivity to effectors, or in which sensitivity to one effector could be deleted selectively. The present results, with newly devised computer simulation and analysis methods, illustrate the usefulness of equilibrium isotope exchange kinetic probes for providing unique insights to enzyme regulatory mechanisms, to define exactly which steps are altered in a given kinetic mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1659118868,"The rapid mixing/photocross-linking technique developed in our laboratory has been employed in the study of the mechanism of promoter binding by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (RPase). We have previously reported on the quantitation of the one-dimensional diffusion coefficient (D1) for RPase along the DNA template (Singer, P. T., and Wu, C.-W. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 14178-14189). In this paper, we describe the effect of salt concentration and temperature on the kinetics of promoter search by RPase using plasmid pAR1319 DNA, which contains the A2 early promoter from bacteriophage T7, as template. Over a range of KCl concentrations from 25 to 200 mM, the apparent bimolecular rate constant (ka) for the association of RPase with the A2 promoter on this DNA template varied approximately 2-fold, achieving a maximal value between 100 and 125 mM KCl. More significantly, the transient distribution of RPase among nonspecific DNA binding sites changed markedly as a function of salt concentration, indicative of gross changes in the average number of base pairs covered by sliding during a nonspecific lifetime. Using the mathematical treatment outlined in our earlier report, the nonspecific dissociation rate constant (koff) was calculated from the binding curves for the nonspecific as well as promoter-containing DNA. The observed variations in ka as a function of monovalent cation concentration ([M+]) were due primarily to changes in koff, as D1 was found to be essentially independent of [M+]. Interestingly, D1 decreased by one-third as the concentration of magnesium was lowered from 10 to 1 mM. In addition, the dependence of koff (and consequently the nonspecific equilibrium association constant, keq) on [M+] agreed qualitatively with the results of deHaseth et al. (deHaseth, P.L., Lohman, T. M., Burgess, R. R., and Record, M. T., Jr. (1977) Biochemistry 17, 1612-1622), though we consistently measure a weaker Keq. The association rate constant was also measured between 4 and 37 degrees C, and was found to vary approximately 2-fold over that range. An activation energy for the bimolecular association of RPase to the A2 promoter was calculated to be 2.2 +/- 0.4 kcal/mol, while the activation energy for one-dimensional diffusion was 4.7 +/- 0.8 kcal/mol."
https://openalex.org/W39854491,"Expression of plant acyl carrier protein (ACP) in Escherichia coli at levels above that of constitutive E. coli ACP does not appear to substantially alter bacterial growth or fatty acid metabolism. The plant ACP expressed in E. coli contains pantetheine and approximately 50% is present in vivo as acyl-ACP. We have purified and characterized the recombinant spinach ACP-I. NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing indicated identity to authentic spinach ACP-I, and there was no evidence for terminal methionine or formylmethionine. Recombinant ACP-I was found to completely cross-react immunologically with polyclonal antibody raised to spinach ACP-I. Recombinant ACP-I was a poor substrate for E. coli fatty acid synthesis. In contrast, Brassica napus fatty acid synthetase gave similar reaction rates with both recombinant and E. coli ACP. Similarly, malonyl-coenzyme A:acyl carrier protein transacylase isolated from E. coli was only poorly able to utilize the recombinant ACP-I while the same enzyme from B. napus reacted equally well with either E. coli ACP or recombinant ACP-I. E. coli acyl-ACP synthetase showed a higher reaction rate for recombinant ACP-I than for E. coli ACP. Expression of spinach ACP-I in E. coli provides, for the first time, plant ACP in large quantities and should aid in both structural analysis of this protein and in investigations of the many ACP-dependent reactions of plant lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1607161530,"Expression of the cloned lysis protein of phage MS2, which is sufficient to lyse wild type Escherichia coli, does not cause lysis of mutants lacking the osmoregulatory membrane-derived oligosaccharides (MDO). The lysis gene product normally found in the membrane fraction was not stably inserted into the membranes of a mdoA mutant; rather degradation and release from the membrane occurred. Gentle plasmolysis of the MDO-lacking mutant clearly showed an increased periplasmic space as compared to wild type cells. It is concluded that the MDOs play an important role in maintaining a proper arrangement of inner and outer membrane, a prerequisite for a functional insertion of the MS2 lysis protein."
https://openalex.org/W1483678770,"Escherichia coli 30 S ribosomal subunits and 70 S ribosomes were treated with the bifunctional reagent diepoxybutane, acting as a cross-linker. One major cross-linked protein pair in the 30 S subunit was generated in relatively high yields. This cross-link was shown to consist of ribosomal proteins S13 and S19. Purification of this complex was achieved by a series of conventional and/or high pressure liquid chromatography techniques allowing its isolation in milligram quantities. To reveal the exact position of the two amino acids involved in the cross-link formation, the purified protein pair S13-S19 was subjected to several enzymatic fragmentations, and the resulting peptides were characterized by sequence analysis, amino acid analysis, and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. After isolation of the cross-linked peptides, Cys84 in protein S13 and His68 in S19 could be unequivocally identified as the amino acids cross-linked by the bifunctional reagent. This result demonstrates that, despite neutron scattering data which place the centers of mass of S13 and S19 85 A apart, at least these regions of the two proteins are located within a 4-A distance in the ribosomal particle."
https://openalex.org/W1599784993,"The production of chicken myelomonocytic growth factor (cMGF) can be rapidly induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide from the macrophage cell line HD11. Immunoprecipitation analysis of lipopolysaccharide-induced HD11 cells labeled with various radioactive precursors showed the secretion of a variety of cMGF forms. The precursor-product relationships of the different cMGF forms were studied by pulse-chase experiments, by long-term metabolic labeling in the presence or absence of glycosylation- and oligosaccharide-processing inhibitors, as well as by glycosidase treatment of immunoprecipitates. Our results show that the half-time for intracellular processing/secretion is less than 10 min, making cMGF one of the most rapidly processed proteins. The different forms of the factor are generated from a 24-kDa polypeptide precursor by co- and post-translational acquisition of one or two N-linked oligosaccharides and by O-linked glycosylation. In addition, a fraction of cMGF is modified by long chain, chondroitinase-sensitive, sulfated glycans. This modification is tunicamycin-sensitive, suggesting that the sulfated glycans are attached to N-linked rather than to O-linked oligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W1601188751,"Escherichia coli small ribosomal subunits have been reconstituted from RNA and high performance liquid chromatography-purified proteins including protein S19 that had been modified at its amino-terminal proline residue with 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. As detailed in the accompanying paper (Olah, T. V., Olson, H. M., Glitz, D. G., and Cooperman, B. S. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 4795-4800), dinitrophenyl (DNP)-S19 was efficiently incorporated into the site ordinarily occupied by S19. Antibodies to DNP bound effectively to the reconstituted subunits and did not cause dissociation of the modified protein from the subunit. Electron microscopy of the immune complexes was used to localize the modified protein on the subunit surface. More than 95% of the antibody binding sites seen were consistent with a single location of protein S19 on the upper portion or head of the subunit, on the surface that faces the 50 S particle in a 70 S ribosome, and in an area relatively distant from the subunit platform. The S19 site is close to the region in which 30 S subunits are photoaffinity labeled with puromycin. Protein S19 is thus near protein S14 in the small subunit and in proximity to the peptidyl transferase center of the 70 S ribosome."
https://openalex.org/W1595422437,"The proteins comprising the fructose-specific phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system were investigated using a strain of Salmonella typhimurium which lacks the general phosphotransferase system proteins, HPr and Enzyme I, synthesizes the fructose phosphotransferase system proteins, FPr, Enzyme IIfru, Enzyme IIIfru, and fructose-1-phosphate kinase, constitutively, and expresses the Enzyme I-like protein Enzyme I. Enzyme I activity was found in the cytoplasmic fraction, Enzyme IIfru in the membrane fraction, and FPr and Enzyme IIIfru activities were distributed between the two fractions. Extraction of membranes with butanol and urea led to quantitative release of the membrane-associated Enzyme IIIfru and FPr activities, while Enzyme IIfru remained with the membranes. FPr was purified to homogeneity using ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), and its amino acid composition and N-terminal sequence were determined. A complex of FPr and Enzyme IIIfru (Mr 50,000) was also purified to near homogeneity using ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and chromatography on hydroxylapatite. When the purified complex was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, it was visualized as two protein bands with mobilities corresponding to molecular weights of about 40,000 (Enzyme IIIfru) and 9,000 (FPr). Neither the FPr and Enzyme IIIfru activities nor the proteins represented by these two bands separated during the above chromatography steps or using any of several other techniques, including reversed phase HPLC, indicating a very tight association. Active Enzyme IIIfru free of FPr was never isolated or observed. The proteins could be separated in denatured form by gel filtration in the presence of guanidine HCl or urea. Free FPr and the FPr-Enzyme IIIfru complex were characterized, and the properties of free and complexed FPr were compared to those of HPr."

The procedure for purification of the GI factor included ammonium sulfate precipitation, CM-Sepharose CL-6B and Sephadex G-200 chromatographies, reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography on a C18 hydrophobic support, and high-performance liquid chromatography on a gel filtration column. The purified factor gave a single band of protein with a molecular weight of 25,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel. A concentration of 8 X 10(-10) M GI factor was required for 50% inhibition of growth of Mm-A cells. On chromatofocusing, the GI activity was eluted with Polybuffer 96/acetic acid at pH 8.2-8.4. The purified GI factor markedly inhibited growth of mouse bone marrow cells stimulated by macrophage colony-stimulating factor. The GI factor appeared to be a unique cytokine unrelated to known cytokines such as the tumor necrosis factor, interferons, and oncostatin M."

https://openalex.org/W1513079818,"In this first of two consecutive papers, the main objective of which is to present a new approach to the systematic localization of individual proteins located in the Escherichia coli ribosome by immunoelectron microscopy, we describe the derivatization of several purified 30 S proteins (S12, S21, S14, S19, S18, S17) with 2,4-[3,5-3H]dinitrofluorobenzene at pH 7.4 and 8.4 and the uptake of each dinitrophenylated protein in place of the corresponding unmodified protein into totally reconstituted 30 S subunits. Reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography is used to purify the proteins, to separate and characterize the products of 2,4-[3,5-3H]dinitrofluorobenzene modification, and to analyze the protein composition of the reconstituted subunits. The extent of dinitrophenyl (DNP) modification is estimated by both radioactivity and integrated peak areas, using dual wavelength monitoring at 214 and 360 nm. DNP derivatives of each of the six proteins are efficiently incorporated into reconstituting 30 S subunits. Incorporation of any of the six DNP-modified proteins does not interfere with binding of Phe-tRNA(Phe) in a poly(U)-dependent manner. This result, as well as data showing that unmodified protein competes with DNP-protein for uptake during reconstitution, provide evidence that each DNP-protein occupies the same position in 30 S subunit as does unmodified protein. In general, for a given protein, unmodified and/or less modified forms are incorporated in preference to more modified forms. Modification of protein S19 at pH 7.4 proceeds with selective formation of one derivative in high yield. Reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography analysis of acid hydrolysates of a purified sample of this derivative, as well as of peptides derived from it by digestion with Staphylococcus aureus protease, show the N-terminal proline to be the predominant site of DNP-derivatization."

https://openalex.org/W2414185211,"The v-fps oncoprotein was expressed in a pre-neoplastic, growth factor-dependent Chinese hamster lung fibroblast line (CCL39) to study its effect on growth controls and on the induction of malignancy. Two transfectants were characterized which expressed low (39FPS-8) or high (51FPS-6) levels of P130gag-f ps protein-tyrosine kinase activity. 39FPS-8 cells still arrested in quiescence when deprived of growth factors, but developed an increased sensitivity to the mitogenic actions of epidermal growth factor (20-fold) and alpha-thrombin (50-fold), although not to insulin. In contrast, 51FPS-6 cells completely escaped growth controls, divided in serum-free medium, and were insensitive to further growth factor stimulation. Both transfectants produced rapidly growing tumors in nude mice that formed pulmonary metastases from a subcutaneous site, unlike the parental cells which are non-metastatic. 51FPS-6 cells were comparatively more efficient than 39FPS-8 cells in colonizing the lungs after intravenous inoculation. The v-fps tyrosine kinase therefore induces a partial to complete relaxation of growth factor-mediated controls on the CCL39 cell cycle, with the extent of factor independence reflecting the amount of P130gag-f ps synthesized. This reduction in growth factor requirements correlates with the capacity of v-fps to confer the attributes of metastatic tumors upon preneoplastic CCL39 fibroblasts. We speculate that increased sensitivity to growth factor stimulation represents a common mechanism by which tumor cells acquire metastatic properties."
