https://openalex.org/W1566113502,"Differential scanning calorimetry and x-ray diffraction techniques have been used to investigate the structure and phase behavior of hydrated dimyristoyl lecithin (DML) in the hydration range 7.5 to 60 weight % water and the temperature range -10 to +60 degrees C. Four different calorimetric transitions have been observed: T1, a low enthalpy transition (deltaH approximately equal to 1 kcal/mol of DML) at 0 degrees C between lamellar phases (L leads to Lbeta); T2, the low enthalpy pretransition at water contents greater than 20 weight % corresponding to the transition Lbeta leads to Pbeta; T3, the hydrocarbon chain order-disorder transition (deltaH = 6 to 7 kcal/mol of DML) representing the transition of the more ordered low temperature phases (Lbeta, Pbeta, or crystal C, depending on the water content) to the lamellar Lalpha phase; T4, a transition occurring at 25--27 degrees C at low water contents representing the transition from the lamellar Lbeta phase to a hydrated crystalline phase C. The structures of the Lbeta, Pbeta, C, and Lalpha phases have been examined as a function of temperature and water content. The Lbeta structure has a lamellar bilayer organization with the hydrocarbon chains fully extended and tilted with respect to the normal to the bilayer plane, but packed in a distorted quasihexagonal lattice. The Pbeta structure consists of lipid bilayer lamellae distorted by a periodic ripple in the plane of the lamellae; the hydrocarbon chains are tilted but appear to be packed in a regular hexagonal lattice. The diffraction pattern from the crystalline phase C indexes according to an orthorhombic cell with a = 53.8 A, b = 9.33 A, c = 8.82 A. In the lamellae bilayer Lalpha strucure, the hydrocarbon chains adopt a liquid-like conformation. Analysis of the hydration characteristics and bilayer parameters (lipid thickness, surface area/molecule) of synthetic lecithins permits an evaluation of the generalized hydration and structural behavior of this class of lipids."

https://openalex.org/W75797419,"The transversal distribution of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and cardiolipin in the inner membrane of beef heart mitochondria was investigated. Highly purified “right-side-out” (mitoplasts) and “inside-out” (submitochondrial particles) membranes were used, permitting the independent study of the phospholipid composition on either half of the membrane. Three independent, and partially complementary, methods were employed: (a) chemical labeling with fluorescamine; (b) phospholipase AZ treatment; (c) immunoreaction with anticardiolipin antibodies. (a) 41 and 61% of the total phosphatidylethanolamine in mitoplasts and submitochondrial particles, respectively, were labeled with fluorescamine. With membranes solubilized by deoxycholate about 95% of the total phosphatidylethanolamine was labeled. (b) Phospholipase AZ (EC 3.1.1.4) from NC& nuju venom hydrolyzed 73% of the total phosphatidylcholine and 39% of the total phosphatidylethanolamine in mitoplasts, and 30% of phosphatidylcholine and 63% of phosphatidylethanolamine in submitochondrial particles, provided the enzyme was purified according to Deems and Dennis (Deems, R. A., and Dennis, E. A. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250,9008-9012). After solubilizing the membranes with Triton X-100, more than 90% of the phospholipids were hydrolyzed. The rate of hydrolysis was fast in the case of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine but slow in the case of cardiolipin. After 60 min, 20 and 60% of the total cardiolipin was hydrolyzed in mitoplasts and submitochondrial vesicles, respectively. (c) The immunoreaction with cardiolipin antibodies indicated cardiolipin to be about 3 times more abundant on the matrix side of the membrane. From the three approaches applied, the following phospholipid composition of the inner membrane of heart mitochondria was obtained: tin the cytoplasmic side (mitoplasts) the composition was 28% phosphatidylcholine, 13% phosphatidylethanolamine, 6% cardiolipin; on the matrix side (submitochondrial particles) the composition was 11% phosphatidylcholine, 21% phosphatidylethanolamine, 18% cardiolipin."
https://openalex.org/W1575649761,"A model for the junction of contiguous DNA segments having A-DNA and B-DNA conformations is generated using a computerized linked-atom, least-squares model building program. The junction region comprises one base pair and the two neighboring internucleotide linkages and exhibits full hydrogen-bonded base-pairing, full base-stacking, and unexceptional stereochemistry. In addition, the junction has a mixed sugar ring pucker with the junction base pair adopting C2-endo and C3-endo furanose sugar rings in the complementary strands. Since the junction is fully base-stacked, the differences in base tilt between A-DNA and B-DNA result in a bend of 26 degrees in the duplex at the junction. The results of this study indicate: 1) a correlation of the B leads to A transition with several features of the initiation of RNA transcription, 2) possible structural roles of alternating AT and GC sequences in protein recognition, and 3) the possibility of dynamic conformational discontinuities in a DNA helix."
https://openalex.org/W1532070101,"Prolonged isoproterenol treatment of rats is known to cause hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the parotid glands. Our results show that a dramatic increase in the synthesis or accumulation in the parotid glands of a series of proteins rich in proline also occurs with isoproterenol treatment. After 10 days of treatment (5 mg of isoproterenol/day) these proline-rich proteins (PRPs) comprise more than 50% of the total soluble proteins in parotid gland homogenates. The PRPs are rapidly labeled in vivo by a single intraperitoneal injection of [3H]proline with maximum incorporation occurring at about 3. More than 90% of the [3h]proline found in parotid gland homogenates is incorporated into PRPs with less than 1% of the radioactivity in alpha-amylase. Tritium incorporated into PRPs was isolated as [3H]proline after acid hydrolysis. One acidic and six basic 3H-labeled PRPs were isolated from the 100,000 x g supernatant fraction of parotid gland homogenates by Sephadex G-100 and ion exchange chromatography. The six basic proteins accounted for about 90% of the total PRPs isolated."

https://openalex.org/W1575726674,"By means of affinity chromatography on CDP-hexanolamine-agarose, a CMP-N-acetylneuraminate: alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminide alpha 2 leads to 6 sialyltransferase (EC 2.4.99.1) has been purified 117,000-fold to homogeneity from Triton X-100 extracts of porcine submaxillary glands. The enzyme consists of several electrophoretic forms that can be partially resolved by chromatography on Sephadex G-200, the largest of which has a molecular weight of approximately 160,000 as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. Periodate oxidation studies show that the linkage formed by this enzyme with ovine submaxillary asialo-mucin as the acceptor substrate is NeuAc alpha 2 leads to 6GalNAc alpha 1 leads to O-Thr/Ser. On the basis of initial rate studies and the patterns of inhibition observed with alternate acceptor substrates, the transferase is proposed to have either a random equilibrium kinetic mechanism or an ordered steady state mechanism with the acceptor substrate binding first. Among a wide variety of oligosaccharides, glycoproteins, and simple glycosides (including p-nitrophenyl-alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminide), the only acceptor substrates for this enzyme are those glycoproteins containing the structure, R leads to 3GalNAc alpha 1 leads to O-Thr/Ser, where R may be H or a beta-galactoside."
https://openalex.org/W1587473926,"Branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.4.3(4)) was solubilized and purified from bovine liver mitochondria for the first time. Decarboxylation of alpha-ketoisovalerate, alpha-keto-beta-methylvalerate, and alpha-ketoisocaproate was catalyzed by this multienzyme complex and this activity was co-purified for each substrate. Three enzymatic functions were contained in the complex including decarboxylation of the above ketoacids, transacylation of their simple acid derivatives, and reduction of NAD+ as an overall reaction. Product stoichiometry of these three reactions was 1 CO2:1 acyl-CoA:1 NADH. Activity depended upon the addition of thiamin pyrophosphate, CoASH, and NAD+ which were dissociable cofactors. Physically, two active forms of the enzyme complex were found: a 275,000-dalton unit and a 2 x 10(6)-dalton component. Both showed a characteristic flavin spectra and catalyzed all functions of the complex, implying that 10 small units aggregated into the larger unit. The soluble complex as visualized by electron microscopy had a diameter ranging from 12 to 24 nm corresponding to a molecular weight of 2 x 10(6). The size of the native membrane-bound component remains to be determined."

https://openalex.org/W1546605609,"The content of alpha-lactalbumin and three species of caseins, 42K, 29K, and 25K, have been measured along with the levels and activities of their mRNAs in the rat mammary gland. Changes in these values were followed during gestation and lactation. An increment of 3- to 4-fold over the virgin level was observed for both alpha-lactalbumin and 42K casein during the 1st day of gestation. From this point on, the level of 42K remained unchanged during the 1st week of gestation and increased thereafter. After the increment of the 1st day, the alpha-lactalbumin content decreased rapidly during the 2nd day of gestation, continued to decrease more slowly until the 12th day, and then started to increase thereafter. During the 2nd and 3rd week of gestation. the amounts of alpha-lactalbumin within the gland increased continuously but not uniformly and caseins accumulated rapidly with a tendency to plateau around the 13th to 16th day of gestation. The relative proportions remained, respectively, 42K greater than 29K greater than 25K greater than alpha-lactalbumin until parturition. At the onset of lactation, both alpha-lactalbumin and casein content increased sharply, the relative proportion for caseins changed to 42K greater than 25K greater than 29K greater than alpha-lactalbumin and remained so throughout the lactation period. alpha-Lactalbumin and casein mRNA activity, as judged by the wheat germ translational system, remained unchanged during the 1st week of gestation, then showed a steady but not uniform increase from the 7th day of gestation until parturition. These activities increased sequentially during lactation, alpha-lactalbumin reaching a plateau by the 1st week, caseins between the 1st and 2nd week, and other mRNAs by the end of the 2nd week of lactation. By the 21st day of lactation, the activity of all mRNA had declined. The levels of alpha-lactalbumin mRNA and 16 S doublet casein mRNA sequences measured with the cDNA probes increased by about 8-fold for alpha-lactalbumin mRNA and 6-fold for casein mRNA during the 1st week of gestation. These levels declined slightly early in the 2nd week and then continued to increase until parturition with a shoulder in the levels around the 13th to 16th day. During lactation, these levels increased until the 8th to 12th day and from then on declined. The content of alpha-lactalbumin and caseins, as well as the measurement of sequences and activities of their mRNAs, showed that in the rat mammary gland these differentiated functions are already expressed at the onset of gestation. Both concentration and activity of mRNA are out of phase with protein levels during the 1st week of gestation but they remain in phase thereafter."
https://openalex.org/W1570108971,"Synthesis of phiX174 viral (+) strand circles in vitro requires gene A protein, rep protein, DNA binding protein, and DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (Eisenberg, S., Scott, J. F., and Kornberg, A., (1976) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 73, 3151-3155). We have used this reaction as an assay to isolate gene A protein in greater than 90% purity. Its molecular weight under denaturing conditions is 59,000. The protein tends to aggregate and lose activity at low ionic strength. Tritium-labeled gene A protein cleaves the phiX174 duplex replicative form and is bound to it in a 1:1 ratio as part of an active replication complex. The attachment, at the 5' phosphoryl end of the cleavage point, is apparently covalent. The complex was not dissociated by: (i) banding in CsCl, (ii) treatment with 0.2 M NaOH, or (iii) boiling in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate and electrophoresis on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel; only micrococcal nuclease digestion of the DNA released the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1527757841,"The major high molecular weight complex of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases is purified about 1000-fold with 30% yield from rat liver. The synthetase complex sediments at 24 S with a molecular weight of 900,000 +/- 75,000 and contains aminoacylation activities for lysine, arginine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, glutamine, glutamate, and proline. The 24 S synthetase complex dissociates into 21 S, 18 S, 13 S, 12 S, and 10 S complexes with specific enzymatic activities. Dissociation of the 24 S complex into active free synthetases is achieved by hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The disassembly of the synthetase complex is consistent with the structural model of a heterotypic multienzyme complex and suggests that the complex formation is due to the specific intermolecular interactions among the synthetases."

https://openalex.org/W1602192060,"We tested various methods of assaying the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of cholera toxin using artificial acceptors of the ADP-ribosyl group. Any of several proteins or poly(L-arginine) could be used with [adenine-14C]NAD+ as ADP-ribosyl donor, but this method was not ideal because of the heterogeneity of potential acceptor groups and the necessity of using costly labeled NAD+. We, therefore, developed an alternative assay using a synthetic low molecular weight acceptor, 125I-N-guanyltyramine (125I-GT). 125I-GT was specifically ADP-ribosylated by thiol-treated cholera toxin or its A1 peptide in the presence of beta-NAD. ADP-ribosyl-125I-GT was quantified after separation from unreacted 125I-GT by batch absorption of the latter to cation exchange resins. Analysis of the kinetics of ADP-ribosylation of 125I-GT indicated that the reaction proceeds by a sequential rather than a ping-pong mechanism. The Km values for NAD+ and 125I-GT were 3.6 mM and 44 microM, respectively. L-Arginine was a competitive inhibitor of 125I-GT (KI = 75 mM), but was at least 1000-fold less active than 125I-GT as an ADP-ribose acceptor."
https://openalex.org/W1530884630,"The mechanism of binding of two antagonists, 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate and N-methyl-4-piperidinyl benzilate, to the muscarinic receptor was studied. The pseudo-first order rate constant of association showed a hyperbolic dependence on the concentration of the antagonist(s) indicating that the interaction involves two equilibria. The first binding equilibrium is reached rapidly and is characterized by dissociation constants 2.7 +/- 0.4 nM and 6.7 +/- 2.5 nM in phosphate buffer (0.05 M, pH = 7.4) for 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate and N-methyl-4-piperidinyl benzilate, respectively. The first binding equilibrium is followed by a slower isomerization step of the receptor . antagonist complex. The equilibrium constants for the isomerization step of the complex for both ligands were about 0.15. The overall constant of binding obtained as the product of the above constants shows good agreement with the results of equilibrium binding studies."

The amino acid composition of the inactivated inhibitor indicates the loss of a peptide fragment from the intact inhibitor. Both intact and inactivated inhibitor contain COOH-terminal lysine. However, the NH2 terminus of the intact inhibitor is Glx, whereas that of inactivated inhibitor is methionine. NH2-terminal analysis of the inactive inhibitor fragment revealed the following sequence: -Met-Phe-Leu-Glu-Ala-Ile-Pro-Met-Ser-Ile-Pro-Pro-Gln-Val-Lys-Phe-Asn. The data show that the venom proteinase has inactivated alpha1- proteinase inhibitor by cleavage of a single bond which differs from that reported for trypsin or papain."
https://openalex.org/W2396632380,"The property of brain endopeptidases of attacking small biologically active polypeptides but not denatured proteins led us to compare them with pancreatic proteolytic enzymes with respect to hydrolysis of a synthetic peptide derived from bradykinin (Gly-Gly-Gly-Arg-bradykinin), free, bound to Affi-Gel 10, or bound to succinylated polylysine of 3,000 and 180,000 daltons, respectively. The data show that brain endopeptidases A and B only hydrolyze bradykinin in its free form, whereas trypsin, chymotrypsin, and carboxypeptidase B hydrolyze the polypeptide both free and covalently bound to a high molecular weight carrier. These results suggest that brain endopeptidases selectively hydrolyze low molecular weight polypeptides."

https://openalex.org/W1545094689,"Incorporation of 18O in cholic anc chenodeoxycholic acid was determined after inhalation of 18O2 by rats with biliary fistula. After a 30-min inhalation, the maximal incorporation of 18O in the three hydroxyl groups of cholic acid was about 1.8 atoms, and in the two hydroxyl groups of chenodeoxycholic acid about 1.1 atoms. About 0.4 atom of 18O in the cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid isolated was present at C-3. It was calculated that at least 50% of the biosynthesized bile acids were derived from newly synthesized cholesterol. The time course for the incorporation of 18O at C-3 of chenodeoxycholic acid was slightly different from that of cholic acid, indicating that a small part of chenodeoxycholic acid might have been synthesized from a pool of cholesterol different from that utilized in the biosynthesis of cholic acid. Incorporation of 18O in biliary cholesterol was less than 0.05 atom, indicating that the major part of this cholesterol is derived from a pool different from that utilized in bile acid biosynthesis."

In mackerel, yellow mackerel, and prawn liver and mantis club hepatopancreas, uricase and allantoinase were located only in the peroxisomes and in the soluble fraction from broken peroxisomes, and allantoicase was located only in the peroxisomes. Uricase and allantoinase seem to be located in the peroxisomal matrix and allantoicase in the peroxisomal membrane. Adenase, guanase, and xanthine oxidase were present only in the soluble fraction of mackerel liver."

This complex was prepared using high specific activity [14C]O2 and injected into a solution containing a large (50- to 112-fold) molar excess of [12C]O2 and sufficient ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate to permit the catalytic site to turn over several times. The enzyme was then rapidly separated from the other components by gel filtration and its radiospecific activity was determined to be 30 to 60 times that of the medium. If the CO2 activator and the CO2 substrate sites were one and the same, then, following turnover, the enzyme should have been in isotopic equilibrium with the medium. The finding that this was not the case, by a factor of about 40, indicates that the CO2 activator site is physically distinct from the CO2 substrate site."
https://openalex.org/W1550523869,"A highly folded, rapidly sedimenting form of rat liver mitochondrial DNA has been released from the organelles wiht BRIJ 58 and sodium deoxycholate in the presence of 0.5 M NaCl and isolated by sedimentation velocity in sucrose gradients. Under these conditions a majority of the mitochondrial DNA labeled in vitro sedimented beyond 39 S, the sedimentation coefficient of a highly purified mitochondrial DNA supercoil, and appeared as a stable, heterogeneous population of species ranging in s values between 42 S and about 70 S. Under formamide-spreading conditions most of the rapidly sedimenting forms appeared in the electron microscope as single genome length rosettes constrained at the center in a dense core. Except for an occasional D-loop, no extraordinary structural features were evident along the smooth loops projecting radially from the central core. In sucrose gradients containing various amounts of ethidium bromide, the sedimentation velocity of the folded DNA changed in a biphasic fashion in response to increasing amounts of dye. At a dye concentration of 0.5 microgram per ml the DNA species present reached s value minima, but two major peaks sedimenting at 32 S and 42 S were present at this point. Thus, although these species were similar in superhelix density, there appeared to be additional constraints superimposed upon their tertiary structure that folded these forms to differing degrees of compactness. Direct chemical analyses showed that proteins were bound to the folded DNA at a protein to DNA ratio of about 0.3. Separation of the bound proteins on SDS-polyacrylamide gels revealed an array of proteins ranging in molecular weight between 11,000 and 150,000. Several of the lower molecular weight proteins co-migrated with proteins from the inner mitochondrial membrane, but the major DNA-bound band (Mr = 58,000) was undetectable among the proteins from any other submitchondrial fraction. Digestion of the compact DNA structure with proteinase K under various conditions indicated that the DNA was maintained in the compact conformation by the tightly bound proteins and that the portions of these proteins directly involved in stabilizing the folded DNA were proteinase insensitive unless digestion was carried out in the presence of a disulfide reductant at elevated temperatures."

https://openalex.org/W1606777322,"Raman spectra of ATP at various pH values are affected by addition of equimolar solution of divalent metal ions such as Ca2+, Mg2+, Co2+, Cu2+, and Hg2+. The changes in frequency and intensity have been used to construct models describing the nature of metal-adenine and metal-triphosphate interactions under different conditions. The metal ions are found to co-ordinate the triphosphate group in the entire pH range studies (pH to 12). Calcium (II) and magnesium (II) interact strongly with the phosphate moiety at neutral pH, although a weak interaction with the ring occur at low pH values. Around neutrality, several Raman spectral changes are observed to implicate the interaction of cobalt (II) ion with the five-membered ring of the adenine. The changes in Raman frequency are too small to suggest a direct Co(II)-N7 binding. At least six different Cu(II)-ATP species are identified between pH 3 and 12. At pH approximately 7.0 Raman data are explained better by Cu(II) interacting with N7 simultaneously with the amino group of the adenine ring. However, a Cu(II) binding to N3 at pH 10 to 11 is indicated by the enhancement of the 760 and 1360 cm-1 vibrations. At neutral pH, mercury (II) ion shows a direct coordination at N1 while at low pH with N1 blocked by protonation, mercury (II) does not interact with the adenine moiety."

Fragment 2 was found to slow the rate of inhibition of thrombin by antithrombin III about 3-fold. The effect of prothrombin fragment 2 on antithrombin III inhibition was examined by comparing its action in the presence of either thrombin or meizothrombin (des fragment 1). The second order rate constants for antithrombin III inhibition of thrombin with saturating fragment 2 and antithrombin III inhibition of meizothrombin (des fragment 1) were the same. Prothrombin fragment 2 had no effect on either antithrombin III inhibition of meizothrombin (des fragment 1) or Factor Xa. The effect of the fragment on the reaction mechanism of thrombin inhibition was evaluated to see if the fragment altered binding of antithrombin III to thrombin or inhibited the formation of the covalent complex. The fragment was found to have no inhibitory effect on the rate of covalent complex formation, indicating that the protective effect of the fragment is by inhibiting binding of antithrombin III to thrombin. These data suggest that prothrombin fragment 2 may be an important factor in controlling the localization of clot formation by regulating the interaction between thrombin and antithrombin III."

The key steps in this procedure were the joining of dCk oligomers, protected at the 3'-OH with an acetyl group, to rCi oligomers by T4 DNA ligase and the purification of the products by RPC-5 column chromatography. The block polymers were characterized by 20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, UV and CD spectra, analytical Cs2SO4 buoyant density analyses, helix-coil transitions and S1 nuclease studies.

In the presence of 1 mM Mg’+, the binding constants are reduced by about 1 order of magnitude, but cooperativity is conserved. Mg2+ competes with Ca2+ for four out of six sites on SCP. In the absence of Ca’+, magnesium binds to SCP with positive cooperativity for two sites and with negative cooperativity for two others, the four intrinsic binding constants for Mg2+ ranging from 0.4 to 1.0 X 10” M-‘. MgSCP is essentially as stable as Ca-SCP, in contrast to the metal-free protein, which denatures readily. A purified preparation of fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum removes bound calcium from SCP easily and, in the presence of physiological levels of Mg2+, the latter cation replaces Ca”+ on the Ca-Mg sites, suggesting that exchange of Ca2+ and Mg2’ takes place during muscular activity. With its two calcium-specific sites, two Ca-Mg sites that interact with positive cooperativity and two Ca-Mg sites that interact with negative cooperativity, crayfish SCP displays more complex metal-binding properties than does parvalbumin, the sarcoplasmic calcium-binding protein found in vertebrates which has only two noninteracting Ca-Mg sites. Furthermore, a comparison between the metal-binding properties of SCP’s and troponin C’s from invertebrate muscle reveals that the former are much more complex than the latter. This contrasts sharply with the situation prevailing in vertebrate skeletal muscle, where complexity is found in myofibrillar troponin C and not in sarcoplasmic parvalbumin."

Furthermore the results indicate that the CF3CO-group experiences the same environment in all of the reversible complexes formed with these inhibitors. This agrees with the higher affinity of these peptides for the enzyme as compared to the corresponding acetylated inhibitors and confirms our earlier hypothesis of the existence of a specific binding site for the CF3CO-group on the enzyme. The interactions between elastase and the irreversible inhibitors CF3CO-Alan chloromethyl ketone (n = 2, 3, 4, 5) and CF3CO-Lys-Ala4 chloromethyl ketone have been investigated by enzymatic measurements and 19F NMR spectroscopy. The kinetic constants k2 and KI describing the irreversible inhibition are significantly lower for all the CF3CO-peptide chloromethyl ketones with exception of CF3CO-Ala2 chloromethyl ketone, than for the corresponding acetylated ones. Moreover, 19F NMR spectroscopy enabled us to demonstrate, for the tri- and tetrapeptide derivatives, the parallel formation of reversible nonproductive enzyme.inhibitor complexes. The spectroscopic properties of these complexes are completely different from those of the irreversible complexes but are similar to those observed with the reversible complexes described above. In the case of the pentapeptide chloromethyl ketones, fast hydrolysis of the peptide or fast inactivation of the enzyme does not allow observations to be made but does not exclude the existence of reversible nonproductive complexes. In fact, their existence is strongly suggested by the enzyme reaction rate measurements. The similarity of the properties of all the reversible complexes, their striking differences with those of all the irreversible complexes, as well as their mutual exclusivity, permit the conclusion that the CF3CO-group does not bind at one of the classical S subsites of elastase."
https://openalex.org/W1533695824,"We have examined the susceptibilities of the histones within the HeLa chromatin core particle to covalent modification by a diol-epoxide derivative of the carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon benzo(a)-pyrene. Core-particle histones exhibit substantial variation in their relative susceptibilities to modification, depending upon the ionic strength of the environment. In contrast, the relative susceptibilities of either purified histones or histones in urea-denatured core particles are insensitive to changes in ionic strength. The variations in the pattern of modification of core particle histones occur primarily at ionic strengths at which the histones remain associated with core-particle DNA (0 to 0.6 M NaCl). Non-histone proteins influence the ionic strength-dependent variations in histone modification. The results imply that the ionic strength of the environment affects the conformation of the core particle and that the nucleoprotein has a flexible structure."
https://openalex.org/W1521587245,"The action of human leukocyte elastase on a series of acetyl and trifluoroacetyl tri-, tetra-, and pentapeptide chloromethyl ketones has been investigated. Leukocyte and pancreatic elastases react quite differently with these irreversible inhibitors. For instance, leukocyte elastase has a much lower affinity for the compounds than pancreatic elastase. On the other hand, the inhibition rate constants of the two enzymes are not influenced in the same way by peptide chain elongation. The two elastases, however, share a common property: trifluoroacetyl tri- and tetraalanine chloromethyl ketones are more tightly bound but are less reactive than the corresponding acetylated inhibitors. This behavior is probably due to the formation of nonproductive complexes between the enzymes and the trifluoroacetylated inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1881955275,"Incubation of a nonfusing muscle cell line, BC3H1, with concanavalin A (Con A) results in a maximum decrease of 35% in the cell's ability to bind alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-BuTx). The Con A-induced inhibition of 125I-alpha-BuTx binding is reversible and the degree of inhibition parallels the degree of saturation of Con A binding sites on the cell surface. The maximum level of Con A-induced inhibition of 125I-alpha-BuTx binding is not affected by increasing the time of incubation in Con A, using higher concentrations of Con A or by increasing the time of incubation in the presence of 125I-alpha-BuTx. In addition, all BC3H1 cells in culture are sensitive to the Con A-induced inhibition of 125I-alpha-BuTx binding. A comparison of the pseudo-first order rate constants for 125I-alpha-BuTx binding to untreated (8.6 x 10(4) M-1 S-1) and Con A-treated (5.4 x 10(4) M-1 S-1) BC3H1 cells, however, shows that those acetylcholine receptors in Con A-treated cells which bind 125I-alpha-BuTx do so with a lowered apparent affinity. Partial inhibition of toxin-binding capacity is not a consequence of two classes of acetylcholine receptors on the cell surface. Furthermore, individual receptors experience partial inhibition of their binding capacity by Con A, resulting in receptors with at least one binding site blocked and at least one site available for alpha-BuTx binding."
https://openalex.org/W2973055,"The two major DNA-binding proteins of human serum (DNA-binding protein 1 and DNA-binding protein 2) were shown to bind preferentially to single-stranded polynucleotides rich in guanine residues. Equilibrium competition experiments using a nitrocellulose filter assay system containing labeled human lymphocyte DNA and various competing natural and synthetic polynucleotides indicated that both proteins recognized sequences of bases containing a keto group in either position 6 (purines) or 4 (pyrimidines) and that these keto groups must be readily accessible for effective binding to occur. Guanine was shown to be the preferred nucleotide through inhibition experiments using a series of synthetic homopolymers and a series of bacterial DNAs of differing G + C content. The relationship between protein affinity and G + C content was shown to be directly proportional. The equilibrium constants for the binding of the human lymphocyte DNA by both proteins were on the order of 10(-6) M, and the length of the nucleotide sequence necessary for effective binding was found to be 12 to 18 bases using a series of oligomers of poly(dG)."
https://openalex.org/W1586519782,"The ability of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and cholera toxin to increase cyclic AMP levels is potentiated 6-fold when normal rat kidney (NRK) cells are treated with picolinic acid or histidinol, or grown in isoleucine-deficient medium. The response to (-)-isoproterenol is increased 2-fold in NRK cells treated with picolinic acid but not in cells subjected to isoleucine deprivation. The increase in agonist responsiveness is time-dependent, reaches its maximum at 40 h, and is quickly reversed following removal of picolinic acid or addition of medium with normal amounts of isoleucine. The cholera toxin response is also increased about 7-fold in simian virus 40-transformed NRK cells and Moloney sarcoma virus-transformed NRK cells treated with picolinic acid. GTP-stimulated, but not fluoride-stimulated, adenylate cyclase activities are increased in membranes from NRK cells treated with picolinic acid or starved for isoleucine, indicating that the increased response is due, at least in part, to a specific potentiation of GTP-dependent functions of the adenylate cyclase system. The results demonstrate that GTP-dependent events in hormonal stimulation of adenylate cyclase can be altered in intact cells to modulate hormonal enhancement of cyclic AMP production."
https://openalex.org/W1487416858,"The enzyme 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate-6-P aldolase of Pseudomonas putida is inactivated by one of the chiral forms of 2-keto-(3RS)-3-bromobutyric acid (bromoketobutyrate). The inactivation shows saturation kinetics and competition with pyruvate. The minimal inactivation half-time is 4 min and that concentration of bromoketobutyrate half-saturating the enzyme is 2 mM. (3RS)-[3-3H]bromoketobutyrate is catalytically detritiated during enzyme inactivation. A kinetic analysis of rates gave data consistent with both catalysis and inactivation occurring at a single protein site, the catalytic site. The enzyme only detritiates one of the two optical isomers of bromoketobutyrate, and that form which is detritiated also alkylates the catalytic site. The inactive isomer of reagent degrades, with inversion, to L-lactate so that the chiral form specific for the enzyme is 2-keto-(3S)-3-bromobutyrate. Thus, as is the case with bromopyruvate, the enzyme catalyzes protonation of the re face at C-3 of the enzyme-reagent eneamine. As a result, bromoketobutyrate could serve as a chiral probe for stereochemical constraints of selected pyruvate-specific lyase active sites."
