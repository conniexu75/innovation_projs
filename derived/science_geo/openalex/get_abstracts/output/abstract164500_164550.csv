To understand the proinflammatory nature of HSP, we analyzed signaling induced by human and chlamydial HSP60. We show that both HSP60s activate the stress-activated protein kinases p38 and JNK1/2, the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1/2, and the I-κB kinase (IKK). Activation of JNK and IKK proceeds via the Toll/IL-1 receptor signaling pathway involving MyD88 and TRAF6. Human fibroblasts transfected with TLR2 or TLR4 plus MD-2 gain responsiveness to HSP60, while TLR2- or TLR4-defective cells display impaired responses. Initiation of signaling requires endocytosis of HSP60 that is effectively inhibited by serum component(s). The results revealed that adjuvanticity of HSP60 operates similar to that of classical pathogen-derived ligands.

In addition, HSPs act as molecular shuttles for antigens (3Srivastava P.K. Menoret A. Basu S. Binder R.J. McQuade K.L. Immunity. 1998; 8: 657-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). For example, certain HSPs isolated from (tumor) cells are associated with a large repertoire of proteins and peptides, including antigenic peptides (4Udono H. Srivastava P.K. J. Exp.

Upon internalization by immature dendritic cells, HSP-peptide complexes efficiently trigger cytotoxic T cell responses (8Arnold-Schild D. Hanau D. Spehner D. Schmid C. Rammensee H.G. de la S.H.

This raises the question why HSP-peptide complexes require no adjuvant to confer immunogenicity to bound peptides. Since initiation of antigen-specific responses depends on activation of immature dendritic cells into professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) expressing costimulatory molecules and producing cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-12, HSP may directly activate immature APC (12Singh-Jasuja H. Scherer H.U. Hilf N. Arnold-Schild D. Rammensee H.G. Toes R.E. Schild H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2211-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 13Basu S. Binder R.J. Suto R. Anderson K.M.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 6029-6035Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Activation of APC can be induced by either T helper cells or pathogen-derived ligands (15Banchereau J. Steinman R.M. Nature. 1998; 392: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (12240) Google Scholar). Recognition of pathogen-derived ligands such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycans, and bacterial CpG-DNA by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), TLR2, and TLR9, respectively, has recently been discovered (16Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2617) Google Scholar, 17Hemmi H. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Kaisho T. Sato S. Sanjo H. Matsumoto M. Hoshino K. Wagner H. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2000; 408: 740-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5359) Google Scholar). Subsequent cell activation is brought about by recruitment through TLR's Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain of the adapter molecule myeloid differentiation marker 88 (MyD88) followed by activation of the IL-1 receptor-associated kinase and recruitment of the adapter molecule tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) (18Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Kopp E. Stadlen A. Chen C. Ghosh S. Janeway Jr., C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 253-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). This leads ultimately to activation of kinases controlling activity of transcription factors responsible for induction of proinflammatory cytokines and costimulatory molecules. The ability of HSP to activate innate immune cells has been best documented for HSP60 (19Kol A. Sukhova G.K. Lichtman A.H. Libby P. Circulation. 1998; 98: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 20Kol A. Bourcier T. Lichtman A.H. Libby P. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 21Chen W. Syldath U. Bellmann K. Burkart V. Kolb H. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3212-3219PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, chlamydial HSP60 and its human homologue accumulate in atherosclerotic lesions and stimulate macrophages and endothelial cells as well (19Kol A. Sukhova G.K. Lichtman A.H. Libby P. Circulation. 1998; 98: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Although the signaling pathways involved are yet poorly understood, we were intrigued by similarities of CpG-DNA-driven and HSP60-driven activation of immune cells. Therefore, we analyzed whether HSP60s activate innate immunity cells via the TLR signaling pathway. Here we report that both chlamydial and human HSP60 induce in murine macrophages the stress-activated protein kinases c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1/2 (JNK1/2) and p38, the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and I-κB kinase (IKK). Activation, at least of JNK and IKK, depends on MyD88 and TRAF6. Finally, we demonstrate that chlamydial (“exogenous”) and human (“endogenous”) HSP60 are recognized by TLR2 and TLR4 but not by TLR9 and that endocytosis of HSP60 precedes initiation of signaling. A 5′-FLAG epitope-tagged C terminus of murine MyD88 (MyD-C) was amplified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction from murine spleen RNA and cloned into a modified pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen), containing an untranslated intervening sequence from the mouse IgG heavy chain gene for improved expression in eukaryotic cells (pCX). The expression vectors for the C terminus of human TRAF6 (TRAF-C) and human FLAG-tagged TLR2 and TLR4 were gifts from Tularik, Inc. The cDNA for human TLR9, a gift from B. Beutler (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) was expressed in a modified pcDNA3 vector, containing the EF-1α promoter. The human MD-2 expression vector was kindly provided by K. Miyake (Saga Medical School, Nabeshima, Japan). The cDNA for hemagglutinin epitope (HA)-tagged IKKα, a gift from R. Schmid (University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany), was expressed in pCX. HA-JNK1 was a gift from M. Karin (University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA). The luciferase reporter driven by synthetic enhancer harboring 6 NF-κB binding consensus sites was a gift from P. Baeuerle (Munich, Germany). Recombinant human HSP60 was purchased from StressGen Biotechnologies (Victoria, Canada). TheEscherichia coli expression vector for His epitope-tagged chlamydial HSP60 was kindly provided by B. Kaltenboeck (Auburn University, Auburn, AL). Recombinant chlamydial HSP60 was produced by standard protein purification procedures using a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) followed by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purity of produced protein was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining. Endotoxin contamination of recombinant chlamydial HSP60 was less than 0.1 pg/µg protein as determined by LAL-Test (Acila GMN, Weiterstadt, Germany). Phosphothioate-stabilized CpG oligonucleotides 1668 (TCC ATG ACG TTC CTG ATG CT) and 2006 (TCG TCG TTT TGT CGT TTT GTC GTT) were purchased from TIB MOLBIOL (Berlin, Germany). LPS from Salmonella minnesota Re 595, polymyxin B (PMB), monodansylcadaverine (MDC), and anisomycin were purchased from Sigma, poly(dI·dC) was fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech, and murine recombinant interferon-γ (IFN-γ) was from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Antibodies to ERK1/2 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), and antibodies from New England Biolabs included anti-phospho-JNK1/2 (Thr183/Tyr185), anti-JNK1/2, anti-phospho-p38 (Thr180/Tyr182), anti-p38, anti-IκB-α, anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr202/Tyr204), anti-ERK1/2, anti-phospho-STAT1 (Tyr701), and anti-STAT1. The murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 was grown in VLE-RPMI medium (Biochrom KG, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 IU/ml penicillin G, and 100 IU/ml streptomycin sulfate (all from Biochrom KG). 5–10·106 RAW264.7 cells were transfected by electroporation in a 400-µl final volume (RPMI, 25% FCS) at 280 V (for JNK kinase assay) or 300 V (for IKK kinase assay) and 960 microfarads in a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). 5 µg of HA-JNK1 or 9 µg of HA-IKKα were used for transfection together with different amounts of specific expression vectors as indicated in the figure legends. The overall amount of plasmid DNA was held constant at 30 µg/electroporation by the addition of the appropriate empty expression vector. After electroporation, cells were washed and split into six-well plates for subsequent stimulation and lysis. The human embryonic kidney fibroblasts 293T were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biochrom KG) with the same supplements as for RAW264.7 macrophage cell cultures. For luciferase reporter assays, the 293T cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method as described (22Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). Briefly, 24 h before transfection, 293T cells were plated at 105 cells/well in 12-well plates in 10% FCS, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. 1 ng of 6× NF-κB luciferase reporter together with 0.1 µg of respective expression vector or empty control vector (as indicated in legend of Fig. 5 A) per transfection were used. The overall DNA amount was held constant at 6 µg by the addition of pcDNA3. After the addition of DNA mix, the cells were held in 3% CO2 incubator for 15–20 h, subsequently washed, and held in 7% CO2 incubator for an additional 5–10 h before stimulation and lysis. Mice deficient in TLR2 generated by gene targeting were obtained from Tularic Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Briefly, a portion of the TLR2 gene sequence encoding a portion of the extracellular and of the transmembrane domain was replaced by gene targeting in ES cells from 129/SvJ mice with a neomycin cassette oriented in the opposite direction of the gene (Deltagen Inc., Menlo Park, CA). TLR2-deficient mice were generated by aggregation in C57BL/6 mice and intercrossing of resulting heterozygous mice. Inactivation of the TLR2 gene was confirmed by Western blotting of extracts from thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages using rabbit polyclonal serum raised against TLR2. 2C. J. Kirschning, manuscript in preparation. Groups of corresponding wild-type and TLR2-deficient mice were applied. All experiments used homozygous F1 generation mice. TLR4-mutated C3H/HeJ and wild-type C3H/HeN mice were purchased from Charles River (Sulzfeld, Germany). Age-matched groups of wild-type and TLR-deficient mice were used for the experiments. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDDC) were prepared as described (23Lutz M.B. Kukutsch N. Ogilvie A.L. Rossner S. Koch F. Romani N. Schuler G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 223: 77-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (2502) Google Scholar). For stimulation, nonadherent BMDDC at days 7–9 were washed and plated at 7.5·105 in medium without FCS, and after a 4-h rest cells were stimulated in duplicates for 18 h. Unless otherwise stated, stimulations were performed in the presence of 20 µg/ml PMB, sufficient to block at least 50 ng/ml LPS. TNF-α levels in culture supernatants were determined by a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (R&D Systems) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. For Western blotting, cells were grown and stimulated as indicated in the figure legends. After stimulation, cells were lysed in Triton lysis buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were boiled in SDS sample buffer, sonicated, centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min, resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and blotted onto Protran nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were blocked in 5% skim milk solution, probed with the indicated antibodies, and visualized using the chemiluminescence kit Renaissance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For in vitro kinase assays, 18 h after transfection cell cultures were deprived of FCS for 2 h and then stimulated as indicated in legend of Fig. 4. Afterward, medium was aspirated, cells were lysed in Triton lysis buffer, and lysates were precleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. To precipitate HA-tagged kinases, antibodies to the HA tag (clone 12CA5, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) together with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were incubated with the lysates overnight. Precipitates were washed 3 times with HNTG buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) and equilibrated in kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmsodium fluoride, 0.5 µm sodium orthovanadate, 20 µm ATP). Kinase assays were initiated by adding [γ-32P]ATP (Hartmann Analytic, Braunschweig, Germany) and the number of amino acids from C-JUN (GST-c-Jun (79)) for JNK or the number of amino acids from IKB (GST-IκBα (54)) for IKK. Reactions were performed at 30 °C for 30 min for JNK or 40 min for IKK and stopped by boiling in SDS sample buffer. Probes were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and the radioactive intensity was measured using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). For loading control, membranes were probed with antibodies to HA-tag (clone 3F10; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For luciferase assays, transfected cells were stimulated as described in Fig. 5 A and lysed, and luciferase activity in extracts was measured with the Luciferase Assay System kit from Promega(Mannheim, Germany) according to manufacturer's instructions. Chlamydial HSP60 was labeled using the Alexa FluorTM546 Protein Labeling Kit (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) following the manufacturer's instructions. Concentration of protein after labeling was controlled by the BCA assay kit from Pierce. To study the cellular uptake of chlamydial HSP60, 7×105 RAW264.7 macrophages were plated 1 day before image collection in Lab-Tek II two-chambered cover glasses (Nunc International, Wiesbaden-Biebrich, Germany) in 10% FCS, RPMI medium. Two h prior to stimulation, medium was exchanged as detailed in Fig. 2. The specimens were mounted in a Zeiss Tempcontrol 37-2 digital and held at 37 °C during the recordings. The uptake was viewed with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) using a helium/neon 543-nm laser, a Plan-Neofluar 40 1.3 oil lens, and LSM 510 version 2.02 software. 1-µm thick slices were collected. Initial attempts to correlate HSP60-induced TNFα production with activation of IKK or JNK consistently resulted in weak signals or no signals. However, if macrophage cell line RAW264.7 cultures were withdrawn of FCS for several hours and then stimulated with HSP60, an unequivocal activation of, for example, stress-activated protein kinase JNK1/2 ensued (Fig.1 A). This was paralleled with production of higher amounts of TNFα at each concentration of HSP60 tested (Fig. 1 B). The potential of contamination with LPS could be excluded, since all experiments were performed in the presence of PMB at concentrations able to neutralize 50 ng/ml LPS (Figs.1 B and 3 B). We speculated that FCS might block the contact of HSP60 with macrophages. To analyze this possibility, we compared stimulation of cells with fluorescently labeled HSP60 in the presence or absence of serum. Labeling of HSP60 did not affect its stimulatory capacity as measured by TNFα production (data not shown). Confocal laser-scanning microscopy revealed that in the absence of FCS fluorescently labeled HSP60 became rapidly endocytosed by macrophages (Fig. 2). On the other hand, FCS (10% in culture medium) effectively blocked the internalization of HSP60 (Fig.2). Overall, these data implied that component(s) within FCS interfered with HSP60 endocytosis by macrophages and perhaps with subsequent triggering of intracellular signaling cascades.Figure 3Signaling cascades triggered by HSP60. A, 1 day before stimulation, 2.5·105 RAW264.7 macrophages/well in 0.5 ml of 10% FCS/RPMI medium were plated in 24-well plates. 2 h before stimulation, cell cultures were deprived of FCS. Cells were stimulated with 1 µg/ml of human or chlamydial HSP60 for 60 and 120 min and with 2 µm CpG oligonucleotide 1668 for 30 min. 20 µg/ml PMB was used throughout the stimulations to exclude the effects of trace amounts of LPS in protein preparations. Cells were lysed, and Western blotting for the activated form of p38 (p-p38), for I-κBα, and for activated forms of ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) was performed. Additionally, the total amount of p38 and ERK1/2 in lysates was determined. One representative experiment out of three is shown. B, RAW264.7 cells were pretreated as in A and then stimulated in the absence of FCS for 30 min with 2 µm 1668 or 50 ng/ml LPS. In parallel, the same stimulations were performed in medium containing 10% FCS. To probe the efficiency of PMB, part of the cells were in addition stimulated with 50 ng/ml LPS with and without PMB. Cells were lysed, and Western blotting for the activated form of p38 was performed. Additionally, the total amount of p38 in lysates was determined. One representative experiment out of three is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Having established that serum-free conditions allow efficient HSP60-mediated activation of macrophages, we compared the signaling pathways induced with those triggered by bacterial CpG-DNA or LPS. In addition to JNK1/2 (Fig. 1 A) HSP60 also activated stress-activated protein kinase p38, although slightly delayed when compared with CpG-DNA (oligonucleotide 1668) or LPS (Fig.3 A and data not shown). Furthermore, chlamydial HSP60 and its human homologue activated IKK (see below), caused degradation of IκB-α (Fig. 3 A) and induced in macrophages NF-κB luciferase reporter activity (data not shown). Finally, both HSP60s activated the classic mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK1/2 (Fig. 3 A), as shown for LPS (24Weinstein S.L. Sanghera J.S. Lemke K. DeFranco A.L. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14955-14962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or CpG-DNA (25Hacker H. Mischak H. Hacker G. Eser S. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Wagner H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6973-6982Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Pathogen-derived (exogenous) ligands such as LPS or bacterial CpG-DNA activate innate immune cells via the evolutionary ancient TIR signaling pathway (26Kawai T. Adachi O. Ogawa T. Takeda K. Akira S. Immunity. 1999; 11: 115-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar, 27Hacker H. Vabulas R.M. Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Akira S. Wagner H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Signaling through TIR is believed to occur via sequential recruitment of the adapter molecule MyD88, the IL-1 receptor-associated kinase, and the adapter molecule TRAF6 (18Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Kopp E. Stadlen A. Chen C. Ghosh S. Janeway Jr., C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 253-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar, 28Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). To address the question of whether HSP60s share intracellular signaling cascades with classic bacterial ligands, we employed transient transfections of RAW264.7 with dominant negative forms of signaling intermediates, concentrating our analysis on downstream activation of JNK and IKK. Having established that the peak of JNK and IKK activity in RAW264.7 macrophages stimulated with 5 µg/ml of HSP60 was reached at 60 and 30 min, respectively (data not shown), these time points were used to “read out” the effects of dominant-negative constructs. First, we analyzed whether HSP60-mediated activation of the intracellular signaling cascades is controlled by MyD88. To this, RAW264.7 cells were cotransfected with either HA-tagged JNK1 or IKKα together with a C terminus of MyD88 (MyD-C) known to act as a dominant negative version of MyD88 (28Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4 A, increasing amounts of MyD-C inhibited dose-dependently both JNK and IKK activation after stimulation with human or with chlamydial HSP60. Dose-dependent expression of the MyD-C construct was confirmed by Western blotting (data not shown). To control for unspecific effects of MyD-C overexpression, we used poly(dI·dC) as an MyD88-independent stimulus (27Hacker H. Vabulas R.M. Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Akira S. Wagner H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Fig.4 A shows that induction of JNK and IKK activity by poly(dI·dC) was not affected by transfection of dominant negative MyD-C. TRAF6, originally cloned as a CD40-interacting molecule, is composed of a highly conserved C-terminal TRAF domain and an N-terminal RING finger domain (29Arch R.H. Gedrich R.W. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2821-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). The overexpressed C-terminal TRAF domain (TRAF-C) acts as a dominant-negative molecule in TIR- and CD40-dependent signaling (18Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Kopp E. Stadlen A. Chen C. Ghosh S. Janeway Jr., C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 253-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar, 30Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V.

Med. 1998; 187: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To investigate whether TRAF6 is involved in HSP60-induced signaling, we cotransfected TRAF-C together with HA-tagged JNK1 or IKKα into RAW 264.7 cells, activated them with human or chlamydial HSP60, and measured induced kinase activities. As shown in Fig. 4 B, TRAF-C suppressed dose-dependently JNK and IKK activity induced by HSP60 yet did not affect JNK and IKK activity triggered by poly(dI·dC). Dose-dependent expression of TRAF-C construct was confirmed by Western blotting (data not shown). These results implied that HSP60s signal via MyD88 and TRAF6, leading to downstream activation of JNK and IKK. Activation of the TIR pathway by bacterial ligands LPS, peptidoglycans, or CpG-DNA is brought about via TLR4, TLR2, or TLR9, respectively (17Hemmi H. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Kaisho T. Sato S. Sanjo H.

Participation of MyD88 and TRAF6 in HSP60-triggered signaling events prompted us to consider the involvement of Toll-like receptors. To test whether one of these TLR acts as a HSP60 receptor component we resorted to the system of transient reconstitution of unresponsive human embryonic kidney fibroblasts 293T. These cells were transiently transfected with luciferase reporter driven by synthetic enhancer harboring NF-κB binding consensus sites. Upon cotransfection of human TLR2 expression vector but not of the empty control vector, both human and chlamydial HSP60 activated the NF-κB reporter in these cells (Fig.5 A). Furthermore, transient transfection with human TLR4 was insufficient to make 293T responsive to HSP60, yet cotransfection of TLR4 plus human MD-2 conferred responsiveness (Fig. 5 A). Cotransfection of TLR2 and TLR4 plus MD-2 did not yield in synergistic responsiveness (data not shown), indicating that TLR2 and TLR4 appear not to cooperate in the response to HSP60, at least in regard to NF-κB activation. Finally, transfection of a human TLR9 construct selectively conferred responsiveness to CpG-DNA but not to HSP60 (Fig. 5 A), implying specificity in “gain of function.” These data suggested that TLR2 or a complex of TLR4 and MD-2 represent essential receptor components for endogenous (human) and exogenous (chlamydial) HSP60. To verify the gain of function experiments, we performed “loss of function” assays by using BMDDC from TLR2-k.o. mice and from C3H/HeJ mice known to carry the codominant point mutationLps d that compromises the function of TLR4 (32Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6421) Google Scholar). Compared with wild type BMDDC, TLR2-deficient BMDDC displayed a strongly reduced capacity to respond to HSP60 as measured by TNFα production (Fig. 5 B). The reactivity to LPS was, however, only slightly compromised due to contaminating lipoproteins in the commercially available LPS preparation (35Hirschfeld M. Ma Y. Weis J.H. Vogel S.N. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Similarly, TLR4-defective BMDDC from C3H/HeJ mice responded under serum-free conditions to HSP60, but the response was curtailed compared with control cells from C3H/HeN mice (Fig. 5 B). To control for equal stimulatory conditions for both wild-type and mutant cells, we included stimulation with CpG-DNA (Fig. 5 B) known to be TLR9-dependent but not TLR2- or TLR4-dependent. Based on the TLR2- and TLR4-associated gain of function and loss of function data, we concluded that both TLR2 and TLR4 confer responsiveness to HSP60. Since FCS effectively impaired HSP60 endocytosis by macrophages and HSP60 triggered signaling as well (Fig. 1 and 2), we analyzed whether endocytosis of HSP60 is a condition for signal initiation or whether it reflects only scavenging of the ligand. There are at least five independent pathways known for endocytic internalization: the clathrin-dependent pathway, the caveolar pathway, a clathrin- and caveolin-independent pathway, macropinocytosis, and phagocytosis (36Riezman H. Woodman P.G. van Meer G. Marsh M. Cell. 1997; 91: 731-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In view of the known receptor-dependent uptake of certain HSP, that is HSC70, HSP70, gp96 and HSP90 (8Arnold-Schild D. Hanau D. Spehner D. Schmid C. Rammensee H.G."

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt play important roles in insulin-signaling pathways leading to production of NO in vascular endothelium. Here we dissected mechanisms whereby insulin activates eNOS by using the fluorescent dye DAF-2 to directly measure NO production in single cells. Insulin caused a rapid increase in intracellular NO in NIH-3T3IR cells transiently transfected with eNOS. The stimulation of NO production by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) was abrogated by pretreatment of cells with the calcium chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid. Remarkably, in the same cells, insulin-stimulated production of NO was unaffected. However, cells expressing the eNOS-S1179A mutant (disrupted Akt phosphorylation site) did not produce detectable NO in response to insulin, whereas the response to LPA was similar to that observed in cells expressing wild-type eNOS. Moreover, production of NO in response to insulin was blocked by coexpression of an inhibitory mutant of Akt, whereas the response to LPA was unaffected. Phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1179 was observed only in response to treatment with insulin, but not with LPA. Interestingly, platelet-derived growth factor treatment of cells activated Akt but not eNOS. Results from human vascular endothelial cells were qualitatively similar to those obtained in transfected NIH-3T3IR cells, although the magnitude of the responses was smaller. We conclude that insulin regulates eNOS activity using a Ca2+-independent mechanism requiring phosphorylation of eNOS by Akt.

We previously demonstrated that key signaling molecules mediating metabolic actions of insulin, such as the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, PI1 3-kinase, and Akt (3Nystrom F.H. Quon M.J. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), are also necessary for insulin to stimulate production of NO in human vascular endothelial cells (4Zeng G. Quon M.J. J. Clin.

Circulation. 2000; 101: 1539-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Thus, one physiological role of insulin action in vascular endothelium may be to couple regulation of hemodynamic homeostasis with metabolic homeostasis (6Montagnani M. Quon M.J. Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2000; 2: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Moreover, abnormalities in insulin signaling in endothelial cells related to metabolic insulin resistance may help to explain the frequent association between hypertension and diabetes (6Montagnani M. Quon M.J. Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2000; 2: 285-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is of great interest to elucidate the precise mechanisms whereby insulin signaling regulates the activity of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS). eNOS contains reductase and oxygenase domains that are joined by a calmodulin binding site (7Stuehr D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Regulation of eNOS activity typically involves mobilization of intracellular Ca2+, subsequent binding of Ca2+/calmodulin to the enzyme, and displacement of caveolin-1 from eNOS (8Michel J.B. Feron O.

This promotes transfer of electrons from the reductase domain to the oxygenase domain, catalyzing the formation of NO from l-arginine (for reviews, see Refs. 7Stuehr D.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Treatment of neurons and pancreatic β-cells with insulin has been reported to mobilize intracellular Ca2+stores (13Jonas E.A. Knox R.J. Smith T.C. Wayne N.L. Connor J.A. Kaczmarek L.K.

However, it is not clear whether insulin-stimulated activation of eNOS is mediated by Ca2+, because insulin is not a classical agonist for modulation of intracellular Ca2+ in endothelium. Furthermore, even though eNOS is often regarded as a strictly Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent enzyme, there is a growing body of evidence that activation of eNOS in endothelium may be independent of Ca2+ for stimuli such as IGF-1 (15Tsukahara H.

Res. 1999; 43: 532-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Indeed, several groups have recently reported that Akt can phosphorylate human eNOS at Ser1177(Ser1179 in bovine eNOS), resulting in increased eNOS activity (20Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B.

Previously, we had identified a critical role for Akt in the insulin-signaling pathway responsible for production of NO in endothelium but had not studied the direct effects of Akt in regulating phosphorylation or enzymatic activity of eNOS in response to insulin (5Zeng G. Nystrom F.H. Ravichandran L.V. Cong L. Kirby M. Mostowski H. Quon M.J. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1539-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated whether mechanisms in which insulin regulates eNOS activity involve Ca2+ or phosphorylation of eNOS by Akt. Our results suggest that insulin-stimulated activation of eNOS is independent of Ca2+ and that phosphorylation of eNOS on Ser1179 by Akt is necessary for insulin to activate eNOS. Importantly, we also found that phosphorylation-dependent regulation and Ca2+-dependent regulation of eNOS may be separable and functionally independent. The pCIS2 mammalian expression vector (23Choi T. Huang M. Gorman C. Jaenisch R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3070-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) was the parent vector for all constructs. The XhoI/NotI fragment containing cDNA for red fluorescent protein obtained from pDsRed1–1 (CLONTECH Laboratories Inc., Palo Alto, CA) was subcloned into pCIS2. The cDNA for bovine eNOS (a gift from Dr. Thomas Michel) was subcloned into pCIS2. A point mutant of eNOS-WT disrupting the Akt phosphorylation site was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis with the MORPH kit (Eppendorf-5 Prime, Boulder, CO) and the mutagenic oligonucleotide (5′-CGT ACC CAG GCC TTT TCC CTG-3′). This mutation introduced a new StuI site and was confirmed by direct sequencing. The cDNA for the kinase-inactive mutant of Akt in pCIS2 was as described (24Cong L.N. Chen H. Li Y. Zhou L. McGibbon M.A. Taylor S.I. Quon M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1881-1890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA for Akt in pCIS2 containing point mutations K179A, T308A, and S473A was as described (25Ahmad F. Cong L.N. Stenson Holst L. Wang L.M. Rahn Landstrom T. Pierce J.H. Quon M.J. Degerman E.

Cells at 60% confluence were transiently cotransfected with 0.1 µg of pCIS2-RFP, 0.45 µg of an eNOS construct, and 0.45 µg of either pCIS2 or an Akt construct using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and bovine aortic endothelial cells in primary culture (Clonetics Corp., San Diego, CA) were grown in EGM-2 as described (4Zeng G. Quon M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 894-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 5Zeng G. Nystrom F.H. Ravichandran L.V. Cong L. Kirby M. Mostowski H. Quon M.J. Circulation. 2000; 101: 1539-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) and used at passages 3–4. For immunoblotting experiments, cells were serum-starved overnight prior to initiation of the experiments. One day after transfection, NIH-3T3IR cells were serum-starved for 2 h after being washed three times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without red phenol, 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin). l-arginine (100 µm) was added 1 h prior to each study. Untransfected or transiently transfected endothelial cells grown at 95% confluence were serum-starved for 2 h in EBM-A (red phenol-free endothelial basal media from Clonetics Corp supplemented with 1% platelet-deprived horse serum (Sigma) and 100 µml-arginine). Serum-starved cells were first loaded with the NO-reactive dye 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate (DAF-2 DA; Calbiochem) (final concentration, 3 µm; 20 min, 37 °C). DAF-2 DA is a cell-permeable compound that is converted to DAF-2 by intracellular esterases and forms a triazole derivative in the presence of NO that emits light at 515 nm upon excitation at 489 nm in proportion to the amount of NO present (27Kojima H. Nakatsubo N. Kikuchi K. Kawahara S. Kirino Y. Nagoshi H. Hirata Y. Nagano T. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 2446-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar, 28Nakatsubo N. Kojima H. Kikuchi K. Nagoshi H. Hirata Y. Maeda D. Imai Y. Irimura T. Nagano T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). After loading, cells were rinsed three times in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-A supplemented with 100 µml-arginine or EBM-A, kept in the dark, and maintained at 37 °C with a warming stage (Bioptechs, Inc.) on a Zeiss Axiovert S100 TV inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY) equipped with an argon laser, PentaMAX camera (Princetown Instruments Inc., Trenton, NJ), and appropriate filters for fluorescence microscopy. In some experiments, l-NAME (100 µm) was added 20 min before loading with DAF-2 DA. In other experiments, 10 µm BAPTA tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester) (Calbiochem) was added along with DAF-2 DA. To identify transiently transfected cells, RFP expression was visualized by emission of red light (583 nm) upon excitation at 558 nm. Typically, two to five transfected cells were identified in a field of view at × 32 magnification. Cells were then treated with insulin, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), or PDGF-BB, and NO production was visualized by emission of green light (515 nm) upon excitation at 489 nm over a period of up to 9 min. Because the DAF-2 dye undergoes significant photobleaching, we maintained cells in the dark and only exposed them to a light intensity of 20% for 3 s for each image captured. Green fluorescence intensity was quantified using IP Labs Software (Scanalytics Inc., Fairfax, VA) to integrate intensity over all pixels within the boundary of each transfected cell. Data for each experiment were normalized to a reference image of the basal state. Cell lysates were prepared using 100 µl of lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 4 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, and the complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Samples (45 µg of total protein) were separated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with antibodies against eNOS (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), Akt (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), phospho-eNOS (P-Ser1177, Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), or phospho-Akt (P-Ser473, New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) according to standard methods. For immunoblotting experiments with the phospho-eNOS antibody, okadaic acid (100 nm) was added to the lysis buffer. To study the mechanisms by which insulin activates eNOS in a minimal system, we transiently cotransfected eNOS and RFP into NIH-3T3IR cells and loaded cells with the NO-specific fluorescent dye DAF-2 (Fig.1 A). Cells expressing eNOS were identified by coexpression of RFP (detected by emission of red light at 583 nm upon excitation at 558 nm) (Fig. 1 B). When these cells were excited with light at 489 nm, insulin caused a rapid, dose-dependent, saturable ∼50-fold increase in green fluorescence at 515 nm (ED50 of ∼50 nm), indicative of a rise in intracellular NO (Fig. 1, C–I). Note that RFP was not visible in cells excited at 489 nm (Fig.1 C), and there was no detectable production of NO in cells not transiently cotransfected with eNOS and RFP. Furthermore, no production of NO was observed in cotransfected cells pretreated withl-NAME (competitive inhibitor of eNOS) or in cells transfected with RFP alone (data not shown). We next examined the time course of NO production in NIH-3T3IR cells cotransfected with eNOS and RFP. When these cells were treated with a maximally stimulating concentration of insulin (500 nm), we observed an increase in fluorescence by 30 s, with a peak at 2 min followed by a rapid return to basal levels by 3 min (Fig.2, A, C, andE, closed triangles). Taken together, these data suggest that our strategy of coexpressing eNOS and RFP in NIH-3T3IR cells in conjunction with the use of DAF-2 DA is a useful model system for understanding how insulin signaling regulates eNOS activity.Figure 2Insulin-stimulated activation of eNOS requires Ser1179. NIH-3T3IR cells transiently cotransfected with pCIS2-RFP and either eNOS-WT (A and C) or eNOS-S1179A (B andD) were treated as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Transfected cells (expressing RFP) were identified by emission of red light (583 nm) upon excitation at 558 nm (A andB). Two min after the addition of insulin (500 nm), production of NO was visualized by emission of green light (515 nm) upon excitation at 489 nm in cells transfected with eNOS-WT (C) or eNOS-S1179A (D). E, the time course of relative green fluorescence intensity after insulin stimulation was plotted as the mean ± S.E. of 12 independent experiments for eNOS-WT (▴) and 7 independent experiments for eNOS-S1179A (▵). F, anti-eNOS immunoblot of cell lysates derived from transfected cells demonstrated comparable expression of eNOS-WT and eNOS-S1179A. Ctrl, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next compared cells expressing wild-type eNOS with cells expressing eNOS-S1179A (disrupted Akt phosphorylation site). Strikingly, in contrast to cells expressing wild-type eNOS (Fig.2, A, C, and E, closed triangles), there was no detectable production of NO in response to insulin in cells expressing eNOS-S1179A (Fig. 2, B,D, and E, open triangles), despite comparable expression of wild-type and mutant eNOS in the two groups of cells (Fig. 2 F). Thus, the Akt phosphorylation site at Ser1179 appears to be absolutely essential for regulation of eNOS activity by insulin. Because eNOS is typically regulated by changes in intracellular Ca2+, we inquired whether Ca2+is also involved in the regulation of eNOS activity by insulin. When NIH-3T3IR cells cotransfected with eNOS and RFP were treated with LPA (a phospholipid growth factor that mobilizes intracellular Ca2+), we observed a rapid rise in production of NO that peaked at 30 s and slowly decreased to basal levels by 3 min (Fig. 3, B–D andK, closed circles). When these same cells were subsequently treated with insulin, we observed a comparable stimulation of NO production with a distinct time course (peak at 2 min, back to basal by 3 min) (Fig. 3, D, E, and K,closed triangles). Consistent with the importance of Ca2+ in regulating eNOS activity, LPA-induced production of NO was completely blocked in cells pretreated with BAPTA (calcium chelator) (Fig. 3, G–I and K, open circles). Nevertheless, when these BAPTA-treated cells were subsequently stimulated with insulin, we observed a significant increase in production of NO comparable with that seen in cells not pretreated with BAPTA (Fig. 3, I, J, andK, open triangles). We observed similar results when insulin was added first and LPA treatment was second (data not shown). Interestingly, insulin treatment stimulated the phosphorylation (and presumably activation) of Akt in both the absence and presence of BAPTA (Fig. 3 L, lanes 4, 5, 8, and 9) whereas LPA treatment did not (Fig. 3 L,lanes 2, 3, 6, and 7). Moreover, when we immunoblotted cell lysates with a phosphospecific antibody directed against the Akt phosphorylation site in eNOS, only insulin treatment, but not LPA treatment, resulted in a significant increase in phosphorylation of wild-type eNOS at Ser1179(Fig. 4, top panel,lanes 2–4). No band was detected in anti-phospho-eNOS immunoblots of lysates derived from insulin-stimulated cells expressing the mutant eNOS-S1179A, demonstrating the specificity of the phospho-eNOS antibody (Fig. 4, top panel, lane 5). Comparable levels of phosphorylated Akt were detected in response to insulin stimulation of cells expressing either eNOS-WT or eNOS-S1179A (Fig. 4, lower panel, lanes 4 and5). Taken together, the results from Figs. 3 and 4 strongly suggest that insulin-stimulated activation of eNOS is independent of changes in intracellular Ca2+ and that LPA-stimulated activation of eNOS is independent of Akt activation. Thus, alternative mechanisms for regulation of eNOS activity by insulin must exist. To determine whether Ca2+-dependent and phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms for regulating eNOS activity are separable, NIH-3T3IR cells expressing eNOS-S1179A were sequentially treated with insulin and LPA. As demonstrated above (Fig. 2), insulin was unable to stimulate the production of NO in these cells (Fig.5 A, open triangles). Nevertheless, subsequent treatment with LPA stimulated significant production of NO that was comparable with that seen in cells expressing wild-type eNOS (Fig. 5 A, open circles). Similar results were obtained when cells were treated first with LPA and then with insulin (data not shown). Thus, Ser1179 is critical for activation of eNOS by insulin but is not required for activation of eNOS by LPA. We next examined cells cotransfected with wild-type eNOS and Akt-K179A (inhibitory Akt mutant) to determine the role of Akt in LPA- and insulin-mediated activation of eNOS. Similar to results obtained with eNOS-S1179A, production of NO in response to insulin treatment was blocked by coexpression of the mutant Akt (Fig. 5 B, closed triangles), whereas the ability of LPA to stimulate production of NO was unaffected by the inhibitory mutant (Fig. 5 B, closed circles). Similar results were obtained using Akt-AAA (another inhibitory mutant of Akt) (data not shown). These findings support the concept that insulin-stimulated activation of eNOS requires phosphorylation of eNOS by Akt. However, the regulation of eNOS activity by Ca2+-dependent mechanisms does not require this phosphorylation. To determine whether effects of insulin and LPA on activation of eNOS were synergistic, we compared simultaneous stimulation of cells with LPA and insulin with subsequent addition of LPA and insulin alone (Fig.6). Interestingly, the magnitude of the rise in intracellular NO in response to concurrent treatment with LPA and insulin was similar to that observed with either LPA or insulin alone. However, the time course of NO production in response to combination treatment resembled addition of the two time courses for individual treatment. That is, simultaneous LPA and insulin treatment resulted in a rapid rise in NO at 30 s followed by sustained production of NO over the next 90 s and then a rapid decrease back to basal levels by 2.5 min. Because phosphorylation of eNOS by Akt was necessary for activation of eNOS by insulin, we wondered whether activation of Akt would be sufficient. In NIH-3T3IR cells expressing wild-type eNOS, little, if any, increase in intracellular NO was observed in response to PDGF stimulation (Fig.7 A, closed squares), whereas the production of NO in response to insulin in the same cells resembled the time course previously illustrated (Fig.7 A, closed triangles). Interchanging the order of PDGF and insulin stimulation did not alter these results (data not shown). Similarly, insulin, but not PDGF, stimulated phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1179 (Fig. 7 B, upper panel). Nevertheless, both PDGF and insulin stimulated comparable phosphorylation and activation of endogenous Akt (Fig. 7 B,lower panels). Thus, stimulation of Akt activity per se was not sufficient to phosphorylate and activate eNOS. To determine whether results obtained with our minimal system of NIH-3T3IR cells transiently transfected with eNOS were relevant to a physiological cell type, we repeated key experiments using HUVEC and bovine aortic endothelial cells in primary culture (Fig. 8). In untransfected HUVEC, the time course and dynamics for LPA- and insulin-stimulated production of NO were similar to those obtained in transfected NIH-3T3IR cells, although the absolute magnitude of the response was 6–7 times lower (Fig. 8 A). Similar results were obtained in untransfected bovine aortic endothelial cells (data not shown). Importantly, pretreatment of HUVEC with BAPTA significantly inhibited production of NO in response to LPA (Fig. 8 B,closed squares), without affecting the response to insulin (Fig. 8 B, closed triangles). Finally, HUVEC overexpressing either eNOS-S1179A or AKT-AAA (identified by coexpression of RFP) produced NO in response to LPA stimulation (Fig.8, C and D, closed squares) but not in response to insulin stimulation (Fig. 8, C and D,closed triangles). Thus, our results in endothelial cells in primary culture agree qualitatively with our results in a minimal system. That is, insulin-stimulated production of NO in vascular endothelium requires phosphorylation of eNOS on Ser1179 by Akt and is independent of intracellular calcium mobilization. Moreover, LPA-mediated activation of eNOS is calcium-dependent but independent of Akt and phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1179. The critical role of eNOS in hemodynamic homeostasis has been unequivocally demonstrated by the presence of hypertension in eNOS “knockout” mice (29Huang P.L. Huang Z. Mashimo H. Bloch K.D.

Diabetes. 2000; 49: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) suggest that insulin signaling and regulation of eNOS activity may intersect and contribute importantly to regulation of both metabolic and cardiovascular physiology. We have recently shown that striking parallels exist between insulin signaling pathways related to glucose uptake in adipose tissue and insulin signaling pathways related to production of NO in vascular endothelium (3Nystrom F.H.

In particular, we found that the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, PI 3-kinase, and Akt play important roles in both of these processes, whereas Ras pathways and PDGF-stimulated activation of Akt do not (4Zeng G.

Thus, it is of great interest to determine the precise mechanisms underlying insulin-stimulated activation of eNOS because this may contribute to understanding the pathophysiological relationships between diabetes and hypertension. The NO-specific fluorescent dye DAF-2 has previously been employed to quantitatively study intracellular production of NO in a variety of cell types that normally express nitric-oxide synthase isoforms (27Kojima H.

Three copper-inducible promoters, controlling expression of six copper tolerance genes, were recently identified in Escherichia coli. The cue system employs an inner membrane copper transporter, whereas the cus system includes a tripartite transporter spanning the entire cell envelope. Although cusis not essential for aerobic copper tolerance, we show here that a copper-sensitive phenotype can be observed when cus is inactivated in a cueR background. Furthermore, a clear copper-sensitive phenotype for the cus system is revealed in the absence of O2. These results indicate that thecue pathway, which includes a copper exporter, CopA, and a periplasmic oxidase, CueO, is the primary aerobic system for copper tolerance. During anaerobic growth, however, copper toxicity increases, and the independent cus copper exporter is also necessary for full copper tolerance. We conclude that the cytosolic (CueR) and periplasmic (CusRS) sensor systems differentially regulate copper export systems in response to changes in copper and oxygen availability.

These results underscore the increased toxicity of copper under anaerobic conditions and the complex adaptation of copper export in E. coli. chemically defined media inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry Cellular responses to starvation are complicated if the nutrient in question is essential but also toxic. The transition metal copper is one such nutrient. The unique redox properties of copper lead to a central role in numerous respiratory and metabolic enzymes, especially those that utilize dioxygen or reactive oxygen species as substrates. Copper can also be quite toxic. This toxicity led to widespread use of copper compounds in anti-fungal and anti-microbial agricultural applications (1Millardet A. The Discovery of the Bordeaux Mixture. American Phytopathological Society, Ithaca, NY1933Google Scholar) or as in anti-fouling paint additives. This cytotoxicity is further manifest in a number of fatal diseases in humans, such as Menkes and Wilson disease, which involve significant disruption of intracellular copper trafficking (2Bull P.C. Cox D.W. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 246-252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Although the mechanisms of cytotoxicity are not yet established, excess copper can apparently lead to deleterious side reactions, including competition with other essential transition metals for binding to key metalloprotein metal centers. Given the dual nature of copper, elaborate mechanisms for copper homeostasis can be found in all kingdoms. In eukaryotes, ranging from yeast to humans, highly conserved systems are used to acquire copper, to direct it to appropriate enzyme metal centers and intracellular compartments, or to eject copper from the cell (3O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25057-25060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 4Pena M.M. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 1251-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). The ensemble of these activities maintains the cellular quota for this metal within an acceptable range, depending upon the growth and stress conditions. The minimal copper quota is that amount necessary for growth and metabolism per cell, but this value is influenced by the specific growth conditions and by the genetic and biochemical background of the organism. Recent studies in the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli have identified two chromosomal systems involved in copper tolerance, both of which catalyze removal of excess copper from the cell. The cue system (for Cu efflux) consists of a copper-responsive metalloregulatory protein, CueR, that up-regulates expression of two genes, copA and cueO (5Outten F.W. Outten C.E. Hale J. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31024-31029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). CopA is a copper efflux P-type ATPase with significant homology to eukaryotic copper transporters in yeast and humans (6Rensing C. Fan B. Sharma R. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). CueO is a putative oxidase that bears similarity to a large family of multicopper oxidases, which includes ascorbate oxidase and the ferroxidases Fet3 and ceruloplasmin (5Outten F.W. Outten C.E. Hale J. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31024-31029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). An independent copper efflux system on the E. colichromosome, the cus system (for Cu-sensing) is regulated by a two-component signal transduction system encoded bycusR and cusS (7Munson G.P. Lam D.L. Outten F.W. O'Halloran T.V. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5864-5871Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). CusRS activate expression of the cusCFBA operon in response to elevated concentrations of copper (7Munson G.P. Lam D.L. Outten F.W. O'Halloran T.V. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5864-5871Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 8Franke S. Grass G. Nies D.H. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The cus system can also be activated by silver, although at higher concentrations than observed for copper (8Franke S. Grass G. Nies D.H. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). CusC is an outer membrane protein with homology to the TolC stress-response protein (9Koronakis V. Sharff A. Koronakis E. Luisi B. Hughes C. Nature. 2000; 405: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). CusB belongs to the membrane fusion protein family (10Paulsen I.T. Park J.H. Choi P.S. Saier Jr., M.H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 156: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Membrane fusion protein family members typically are anchored in the inner membrane with a long periplasm-spanning domain (11Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7190-7195Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). CusA is part of the RND family of H+antiporters, which export numerous substrates ranging from heavy metals to proteins (12Saier Jr., M.H. Tam R. Reizer A. Reizer J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Together these three proteins are envisioned to form a multiunit transport complex that spans both membranes and the periplasmic space. Based on the precedent of homologous systems, the CusCBA transport complex is proposed to transport copper from the cytoplasm across the cell envelope and into the extracellular space utilizing the proton motive force as an energy source. The proposed copper export function of the cus locus has been challenged (8Franke S. Grass G. Nies D.H. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In an alternative model, it is argued that the absence of a copper-sensitive phenotype in the cusA strain is not consistent with a role in copper tolerance and that the cus genes mediate resistance to silver (8Franke S. Grass G. Nies D.H. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The cus and cue systems, however, are induced at similar concentrations of copper sulfate in the medium (5Outten F.W. Outten C.E. Hale J. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31024-31029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar,7Munson G.P. Lam D.L. Outten F.W. O'Halloran T.V. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5864-5871Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), which implies that there may be significant overlap in function. Such overlap would make the copper phenotype difficult to discern. A role for the cus determinant in copper tolerance is further supported by the recent observation of a copper-sensitive phenotype in a cueO/cusCFBA strain (13Grass G. Rensing C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2145-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To test these alternatives, we have deconvoluted the regulation of three loci within these two systems and examined how anaerobic growth alters the copper phenotypes. We show that CueO has multicopper oxidase activity in the periplasm as initially proposed. This activity and several of the Cus phenotypes are dependent upon oxygen, suggesting differential roles for the cus and cuesystems under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In fact the systems are partially redundant, but each operon functions optimally in different environments providing protection for both cytosolic and periplasmic factors from adverse effects of copper. The E. coli strains used in this work (Table I) are all derivatives of BW25113 except for LMG194/copA. Construction of the strains used in this study is described below. All growth and gene reporter studies were conducted in a metal-limited, chemically defined media (CDM)1described previously (5Outten F.W. Outten C.E. Hale J. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol.

Where required, antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: chloramphenicol at 30 µg/ml, kanamycin at 40 µg/ml, and carbenicillin at 100 µg/ml. Media and other solutions used anaerobically were purged of oxygen through three cycles of vacuum evacuation/nitrogen replacement. All anaerobic experiments were performed in a Vacuum AtmospheresTM glove box under a N2 atmosphere.Table IStrainsStrainDescriptionRef.BW25113Wild-type (lacIqrrnBT14 lacZWJ16 hsdR514 araBAD AH33 rhaBAD LD78)14Datsenko K.A.

Single copy gene reporter strains containingcusC-lacZ, cueO-lacZ, orcopA-lacZ were constructed using a λ phage vector as described elsewhere (16Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Lysogens containing the various promoter lacZ fusions were grown aerobically at 37 °C until exponential phase (A 600≈0.5–0.7) at which time they were exposed to varying amounts of copper sulfate for 1 h. After copper exposure promoter activity was measured using the standard Miller assay for β-galactosidase. For anaerobic copper induction profiles, cells were grown as described for the copper sensitivity experiments except that no copper was added to cultures until cells were growing exponentially (A 600 ≈0.5–0.7). Cells were exposed to various copper concentrations for 1 h at which time cells were brought out of the anaerobic glove box. An aliquot of cells was immediately transferred into Z buffer for the Miller assay, whereas the remaining cells were used for A 600determination. The measurements shown are the average of triplicate experiments. Overnight cultures of the various strains were diluted 1:100 into 5 ml of CDM. Cells were grown at 37 °C to an A 600 of 0.6–0.8, followed by addition of various concentrations of copper sulfate. After 1 h, the cells were harvested, and a periplasmic extract was prepared by the chloroform method (17Ames G.F. Prody C. Kustu S. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 1181-1183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the media were drained, and the cells were resuspended into ∼100 µl of remaining media, followed by the addition of 50 µl of CHCl3. After brief mixing, the cell suspension was incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Then 500 µl of 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, was combined with the cell suspension to extract the released components of the periplasm. After centrifugation, the top layer, containing the periplasmic extract, was carefully removed and stored on ice, prior to the oxidase assays. Total protein concentration of the extract was determined by the method of Bradford with IgG (Biorad) used as a standard (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). The activity assays were performed utilizing 3,3′-dimethoxybenzidine (Sigma) as the colorimetric indicator for oxidase activity (19Lehmann H.P. Schosinsky K.H. Beeler M.F. Clin. Chem. 1974; 20: 1564-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Reactants were pre-equilibrated at 37 °C, and the reaction was performed at 37 °C. In the assay 15 µl of periplasmic extract was combined was 225 µl of 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.5. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 60 µl of 7.88 mm3,3′-dimethoxybenzidine. The reaction was performed in duplicate for each assay, and the reactions were stopped at 5 and 120 min, respectively, by the addition of 600 µl of 18 nH2SO4 to each reaction. The difference in absorbance at 540 nm between the 120- and 5-min reactions was used to calculate the amount of oxidized 3,3′-dimethoxybenzidine (ε = 9600 m−1 cm−1). A unit of activity is defined as micromole of substrate oxidized per min per ml of extract. The specific activity is defined as the micromole of substrate oxidized per min per mg of total protein in extract. Measurements shown are the average of triplicate experiments. For aerobic copper sensitivity, overnight cultures of the various strains were diluted 1:100 into 5 ml of CDM containing various concentrations of copper sulfate. Cells were grown at 37 °C with shaking, and a finalA 600 measurement was taken after 9 h of growth. For anaerobic copper sensitivity, overnight cultures of the various strains were sealed into a 1.5-ml tube, and oxygen was replaced with nitrogen gas. These tubes were then transferred into an anaerobic glove box, and the cells were diluted 1:500 into 20 ml of CDM containing various concentrations of copper sulfate. These cells were well dispersed by vigorous pipetting and grown in Petri dishes at 30 °C. A final A 600 measurement was taken after 24 h of growth. Measurements shown are the average of triplicate experiments. Copper gradient plates were made using equal portions of CDM agar with no added copper and with 1 mmcopper sulfate. Plates were allowed to equilibrate overnight prior to use. Equal numbers of cells from each strain were dotted in 10-µl portions across the copper gradient. Growth was examined after 24 h at 37 °C. For aerobic copper accumulation, cells were grown to mid-log phase and then exposed to varying amounts of copper sulfate for 80 min. Following copper treatment, 1 ml of cells was removed for determination of finalA 600, which was used to calculate the total milligrams of cells based on a calibration curve. Cells were then pelleted and washed three times with media containing 1 mmEDTA. The cell pellets were dried overnight at 80 °C in 10-ml Teflon tubes. The dried pellets were then dissolved in 500 mg of Trace Metal Grade (Fisher) nitric acid by heating at 80 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature the samples were transferred to a 50-ml sterile polypropylene centrifuge tube (Fisher). Teflon tubes were rinsed 3 times with Milli-Q H2O, and the rinse was also transferred to the 50-ml tube. These samples were mixed with an internal standard consisting of 45Sc, 89Y,115In, 159Tb, and 209Bi (CPI International). The volume was adjusted to 25.0 g with Milli-Q H2O giving final concentrations of 5 ppb for the internal standard and 2% for nitric acid. The metal content of the samples was measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (PQ ExCell, VG Elemental). Control experiments without cells were run in parallel to determine the background metal contamination in the materials used. A 10-ppm stock of the metal standards used for calibration of ICP-MS was custom-ordered from CPI International and contained 25Mg, 51V, 53Cr,55 Mn, 59Co, 60Ni,65Cu, 66Zn, 75As, 82Se, and 100Mo. This 10-ppm stock was diluted to make standards ranging from 0 to 20 ppb. All glassware and plasticware was acid-washed overnight with 10% nitric acid prior to use. For anaerobic copper accumulation, media were measured into flasks and sealed with rubber septa in the nitrogen atmosphere of an anaerobic glove box. Cells were added to the anaerobic flask using a sterile syringe and were grown at 37 °C without shaking. Addition of copper, copper exposure, and ICP-MS analysis were conducted as described for the aerobic copper accumulation experiments. Measurements shown are the average of triplicate experiments. CueO (encoded by the yacK gene) contains a twin arginine translocation motif at its amino terminus, which targets it for export to the periplasm via the “folded protein” export pathway (20Stanley N.R. Palmer T. Berks B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11591-11596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 21Berks B.C. Sargent F. Palmer T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 260-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). To determine if CueO may function in the periplasm as a multicopper oxidase, periplasmic extracts made from wild-type and cueO strains were tested for oxidase activity. Oxidase activity from wild-type extracts is clearly present, and this activity is inducible by copper (Fig.1). This oxidase activity was abolished in the cueO strain regardless of the presence of added copper. The copper-inducible oxidase activity was also sensitive to treatment with sodium azide (Fig. 1), an established inhibitor of multicopper oxidases, such as ascorbate oxidase, ceruloplasmin, and Fet3 (22Messerschmidt A. Rossi A. Ladenstein R. Huber R. Bolognesi M. Gatti G. Marchesini A. Petruzzelli R. Finazzi-Agro A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 513-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 23Casella L. Gullotti M. Pallanza G. Pintar A. Marchesini A. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 24Blackburn N.J. Ralle M. Hassett R. Kosman D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2316-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that cueO encodes for a copper-inducible, periplasmic multicopper oxidase. The catalytic cycle of multicopper oxidases involves oxidation of a substrate and transfer of the liberated electrons to a copper cluster, where the four-electron reduction of O2 to form H2O occurs (25Cole A.P. Root D.E. Mukherjee P. Solomon E.I. Stack T.D. Science. 1996; 273: 1848-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 26Solomon E.I. Sundaram U.M. Machonkin T.E. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2563-2605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3105) Google Scholar). Multicopper oxidases require dioxygen for activity and are thus sensitive to oxygen deprivation. In fact, we observe no CueO oxidase activity when the assay is conducted anaerobically (Fig. 1). One would therefore predict that CueO is unable to function during growth in the absence of oxygen. The requirement for molecular oxygen for thecue system led us to hypothesize that this system may play a significant role in copper efflux under aerobic conditions, whereas thecus system could be important for copper export under anaerobic conditions. To determine a base line for anaerobic copper toxicity, we measured the copper tolerance of wild-type E. coli strain BW25113 grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions (Fig. 2 A). The toxicity of copper increases dramatically under anaerobic growth conditions. This trend supports an early report of increased copper toxicity in E. coli under anaerobic conditions (27Beswick P.H. Hall G.H. Hook A.J. Little K. McBrien D.C. Lott K.A. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1976; 14: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This is interesting because the toxic effects of copper are often attributed to its ability to catalyze adventitious formation of reactive oxygen species from O2. Given that copper is more toxic under oxygen limited conditions, copper must be able to alter physiological processes in other ways. Previous work (28Strain J. Culotta V.C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 139-145PubMed Google Scholar) has shown that copper accumulation increases in anaerobic cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as compared with aerobic cultures. To determine if a similar change in copper accumulation occurs in E. coli under anaerobic conditions, we measured total copper content of wild-type aerobic and anaerobic cultures (Fig. 2 B). Strikingly, cells grown under anaerobic conditions reach a point of maximum copper accumulation at a media copper concentration of 50 µm, whereas aerobic copper accumulation fails to reach similar levels even out to 500 µm copper. Furthermore, anaerobic cells accumulated up to 20-fold more copper than aerobic cells. These results suggest that the essential copper quota may increase during anaerobic growth. Alternatively, copper homeostasis may be perturbed in the absence of oxygen, either through uncontrolled uptake or through disruption of copper export. To test whether the roles of cue andcus in copper tolerance shift in response to oxygen, thecue and cus mutant strains were assayed in the presence and absence of air. Disruption of copA leads to a significant copper sensitivity under aerobic growth conditions (Fig.3 A). The cueOstrain shows only a mild aerobic copper sensitivity, whereas the copper sensitivity of the cusR strain is not different from wild type in the presence of air (Fig. 3 A). These results are corroborated by the recent findings of Grass and Rensing (13Grass G. Rensing C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2145-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of these strains to copper changes significantly under anaerobic growth conditions. As anticipated by the biochemical analysis above, deletion of cueO does not affect copper sensitivity relative to that of wild-type strains. The copA strain is more sensitive to copper than wild-type (Fig. 3 B), indicating that it continues to play a role in copper tolerance during anaerobic growth. The most striking difference between the anaerobic and aerobic conditions is the appearance of copper sensitivity in thecusR strain in the absence of air (Fig. 3 B). These results imply that disruption of copper export machinery leads to increased copper toxicity, perhaps through increased accumulation. It has been shown previously that disruption of copA leads to a decrease of copper efflux and accumulation of cellular copper (6Rensing C. Fan B. Sharma R. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 29Petersen C. Moller L.B. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 261: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To determine if deletion of cusR and inactivation of the CusCFBA transporter lead to a similar disruption in copper export under anaerobic conditions, the copper content of the cusR strain grown anaerobically was measured. Fig. 4indicates that copper accumulation increases markedly in thecusR strain compared with the wild-type strain, suggesting that anaerobic copper export is disrupted in the absence of thecus system. This accumulation implies that thecus system may exhibit different patterns of gene expression in response to oxygen. A number of metabolic and stress-responsive pathways include metalloproteins that are specifically regulated in response to molecular oxygen (30Sawers G. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 31Kiley P.J. Beinert H. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 22: 341-352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although none of the cue or cus gene promoters contain obvious binding sites for oxygen-dependent regulators, such as FNR or ArcB, copper induction profiles for thecusC and cueO promoters reveal a strong oxygen-dependent effect (Fig.5). First, we consider the relative effects of copper on transcription under aerobic conditions for each promoter (Fig. 5). The half-maximal induction of the cueO promoter occurs at ∼3 µm, which is a lower copper concentration than observed for the cusC promoter (∼200 µm) (compare Fig. 5, A and B). Induction of thecopA promoter directly parallels that of cueO in the initial response (i.e. up to 10 µm) as expected (Fig. 5, B and C). The base-line expression of both copA and cueO in the absence of any copper stress is significantly higher than that observed with the cus system (Fig. 5). Thus at these copper levels we observe the earliest indications of copper stress, up-regulation ofcueO and copA. The early induction of thecue system suggests that copA and cueOtogether form the primary export pathway under these moderate copper concentrations. Further induction of the copA promoter is observed at higher copper concentrations, and as suggested previously (5Outten F.W. Outten C.E. Hale J. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31024-31029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) this may arise from additional activation by other regulatory factors, such as cpxR, that respond to cell envelope stress. A very different pattern of copper-responsive gene expression is observed under anaerobic conditions. First, the half-maximal induction of the cusC promoter now occurs at a lower copper concentration (70 µm) under anaerobic conditions than that observed aerobically (200 µm) (Fig. 5 A). This is consistent with the hypothesis that the cus system plays a more important role under anaerobic conditions. In contrast, the half-maximal induction of the cueO promoter occurs at a higher copper concentration compared with the aerobic condition (60versus 3 µm) (Fig. 5 B). Activity at the copA promoter changes little under anaerobic conditions (Fig. 5 C), but the higher basal level under anaerobic conditions suggests an elevation of cytoplasmic copper concentration relative to aerobic growth. Despite the lack of any clear connection to known oxygen-responsive regulatory systems, the copper responses of thecueO and cusC promoters are shifted in opposite directions by oxygen deprivation. This shift in the regulation pattern may allow the cell to adapt to changes in the periplasmic Cu1+/Cu2+ ratio under anaerobic conditions. Initial characterization of a cusA strain showed no measurable loss of aerobic copper tolerance (8Franke S. Grass G. Nies D.H. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Our results here demonstrate that a cusR mutant strain also has no measurable copper sensitivity phenotype under aerobic conditions. This led to the suggestion that the cus operon is not important for aerobic copper tolerance despite the fact that copper is the most potent inducer, giving a greater induction ratio than silver (data not shown) (8Franke S. Grass G. Nies D.H. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To evaluate this hypothesis further, we deletedcusR in a cueR background to create acueR/cusR strain. In this double mutant strain, the cue system (copA and cueO) is expressed at basal levels but is not copper-inducible due to the absence of cueR (5Outten F.W. Outten C.E. Hale J. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31024-31029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the cus system i"

In this setting, changes in intracellular ROS can activate signal transduction pathways that influence how cells react to their environment. In sepsis, a dynamic proinflammatory cellular response to bacterial toxins (e.g. lipopolysaccharide or LPS) leads to widespread organ damage and death. The present study demonstrates for the first time that the activation of Rac1 (a GTP-binding protein), and the subsequent production of ROS, constitutes a major pathway involved in NFκB-mediated tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) secretion following LPS challenge in macrophages. Expression of a dominant negative mutant of Rac1 (N17Rac1) reduced Rac1 activation, ROS formation, NFκB activation, and TNFα secretion following LPS stimulation. In contrast, expression of a dominant active form of Rac1 (V12Rac1) mimicked these effects in the absence of LPS stimulation. IKKα and IKKβ were both required downstream modulators of LPS-activated Rac1, since the expression of either of the IKK dominant mutants (IKKαKM or IKKβKA) drastically reduced NFκB-dependent TNFα secretion. Moreover, studies using CD14 blocking antibodies suggest that Rac1 induces TNFα secretion through a pathway independent of CD14. However, a maximum therapeutic inhibition of LPS-induced TNFα secretion occurred when both CD14 and Rac1 pathways were inhibited. Our results suggest that targeting both Rac1- and CD14-dependent pathways could be a useful therapeutic strategy for attenuating the proinflammatory cytokine response during the course of sepsis.

Although CD14 and LBP are involved in LPS signaling (CD14-dependent pathways), the existence of additional signaling pathways (CD14-independent pathways) have been reported by other investigators (24Netea M.G.

LPS antagonists, lipid Iva, andRhodobacter sphaeroides lipid A, but not anti-CD14 blocking antibody, inhibited LPS-induced monocyte activation under serum-free conditions (28Lynn W.A. Liu Y. Golenbock D.T. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4452-4461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggested that these compounds act at a site distinct from CD14. In addition, neither LBP nor CD14 was found to be necessary for LPS-induced activation of bovine macrophages (29Jungi T.W. Sager H. Adler H. Brcic M. Pfister H. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3577-3584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes are responsible for killing microorganisms and eliminating cellular debris. These functions are mediated by superoxide (O⨪2) generated by an NADPH-dependent oxidase, as well as other reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and hydroxyl radicals (⋅OH) (30Boxer G.J. Curnutte J.T. Boxer L.A. Hosp. Pract. 1985; 20 (; 77; 80): 69-73Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The assembly of NADPH oxidase has been shown to be up-regulated in neutrophils exposed to bacterial LPS (31DeLeo F.R. Renee J. McCormick S. Nakamura M. Apicella M. Weiss J.P. Nauseef W.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Furthermore, DeLeo et al. (31DeLeo F.R. Renee J. McCormick S. Nakamura M. Apicella M. Weiss J.P. Nauseef W.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that LPS priming increased the level of Rac2, a small GTP-binding protein associated with p47phox and p67phox (two subunits needed for NADPH oxidase function, p91phox) at the membrane. These studies support a role for LPS priming of the respiratory burst in polymorphonuclear leukocytes. In addition, Rac1 (a homolog of Rac2) has been shown to control mitogenic and oncogenic signals through NADPH oxidase superoxide production (32Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17991-17994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 33Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). However, little is known about a potential role of Rac1-NADPH oxidase complexes in controlling LPS-mediated intracellular signaling pathways. We hypothesized that Rac1 might be involved in LPS-mediated signaling pathways leading to the activation of macrophages. In the present study, we provide functional and biochemical evidence that Rac1 induction of NFκB is partially responsible for LPS-induced TNFα production. Activation of this pathway by LPS is dependent on Rac1-mediated ROS formation and the subsequent activation of the IKK complex, but appears to be independent of the CD14 receptor. These studies provide further definition of the ROS-mediated signal transduction pathways that contribute to LPS-induced TNFα secretion.

GST-PBD fusion protein was purified from DL21 cells (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) transformed with pGEX-PBD. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C to log phase and treated with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h. The cells were centrifuged and the cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, and 10 µg/ml aprotinin). Cells were then further lysed by 3 rounds of sonication (each lasting for 30 s). The lysate was subsequently centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the fusion protein was isolated from the supernatant using a Bulk GST Purification Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). The purified protein appeared as a single band on SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay. For selective precipitation of GTP-bound Rac1, the GST-PBD fusion protein (50 µg) was prebound to agarose-conjugated anti-GST antibody (20 µg) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA; catalog number sc-138 AC) in 500 µl of lysis buffer at 4 °C overnight. Subsequently, samples were centrifuged at 2500 × g for 5 min and then washed three times with lysis buffer. These PBD-bound agarose beads were used for precipitation of GTP-bound Rac1 from LPS-treated RAW cells as described below. Confluent monolayers of RAW cells were treated with 0.2 µg/ml LPS (Sigma, catalog number L-2630, source Escherichia coliSertotype 0111-B4, <1.3% protein, 3,000,000 endotoxin units/mg) and incubated at 37 °C for different periods of time (0, 5, 15, and 30 min).

Precipitation of GTP-bound Rac1 was performed by the addition of 200 µg of RAW cell lysate to GST-PBD bound agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Samples were then centrifuged at 2,500 ×g for 5 min followed by three washes with lysis buffer. After boiling samples at 100 °C for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer followed by centrifugation, samples were loaded onto a 12% SDS-PAGE for Western blotting against anti-Rac1 antibodies. Nitrocellulose filters were blocked (5% non-fat dry milk in 1 × PBST) at 4 °C overnight followed by incubation with 0.2 µg/ml rabbit polyclonal anti-Rac-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h at 25 °C. Subsequently, the filter was washed and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) at 0.9 µg/ml for 1 h at 25 °C. The filters were finally washed and developed using a chemiluminescence luminol reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA) and exposed to x-ray film. For loading controls, anti-GST antibody (B14) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc-138) was used to probe the filters. RAW 264.7 cells were obtained from ATCC and grown on 35-mm Petri dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. Adenoviral infections were performed for 2 h at 37 °C, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without FBS. After infections, an equal volume of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 20% FBS was added to increase the serum concentration to 10% and the infections were continued for a total of 40 h. Most studies used various multiplicities of infection (m.o.i.) to test recombinant adenoviral vectors. In RAW cells, adenoviral infection at an m.o.i. of 5,000 particles/cell gave greater than >95% transduction as evidenced by transgene expression. A subset of RAW cells (<5%) appeared to be refractory to adenoviral infection even at m.o.i. of 10,000 particles/cell. The luciferase assay system with Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega, Inc., catalog number E4030) was used to measure NFκB-mediated transcriptional induction according to the manufacturer's protocol. All measurements of luciferase activity (relative light units) were normalized to the protein concentration. The NFκB responsive luciferase reporter, Ad.NFκBLuc, was used to co-infect cells at an m.o.i. of 5000 particles/cell in these experiments. For TNFα protein measurements, a DuoSet ELISA Development System Kit from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, catalog number DY410) was used according to manufacturers instructions. Anti-oxidant chemicals pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (PDTC, Sigma, catalog number P-8765) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC, Sigma, catalog number A-8199) were used to treat RAW cells for 1 h at 37 °C prior to LPS treatment at doses ranging from 1 to 100 µm(PDTC) and 1 to 25 µm (NAC). Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the procedure published by Andrews and Faller (44Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar). NFκB oligos (Promega, Madison, WI, catalog number E329B) were end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4-kinase according to the manufacturers instructions. The mobility shift assays were performed as previously described (45Sanlioglu-Crisman S. Oberdick J. Prog. Brain Res. 1997; 114: 3-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ESR was used to detect the production of hydroxyl radicals using a procedure modified from a previously published protocol (46Sanlioglu S. Engelhardt J. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 1427-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, ESR assays were conducted at room temperature using a Bruker model EMX ESR spectrometer (Bruker, Karlsvuhe, Germany) equipped with a TM110 cavity and a flat cell (Electron Spin Resonance Core Facility, University of Iowa, IA). Instrument settings were as follows: receiver gain, 1 × 106; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; microwave power, 40.1 mW; modulation amplitude, 1.0 G; sweep rate, 1.5 G/s. The WINEPR filter function, moving average (n = 5), was used to filter out noise in all spectra. Prior to LPS treatment, RAW cells were serum starved for 15 h, briefly trypsinized, and then resuspended in PBS with 0.5% FBS. The spin trap, 5,5-dimetyl-1-pyrrolineN-oxide (DMPO), was added to cells at a final concentration of 50 mm. Cells then were immediately treated with LPS at a concentration of 5 µg/ml and the production of ⋅OH was recorded for 45 min. Since the signal intensity decreased after 30 min, spectra recorded in the first 20 min were used for analysis. This procedure was also performed on RAW cells preinfected with Ad.N17Rac1, Ad.V12Rac1, or Ad.Cat virus at a m.o.i. of 10,000 particles/cell and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h prior to ESR analysis. DHE assays were performed according to a modified protocol from Miller and colleagues (47Miller Jr., F.J. Gutterman D.D. Rios C.D. Heistad D.D. Davidson B.L. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1298-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Briefly, RAW cells were grown to 70% confluency on 6-well plates and serum starved overnight. The medium was then changed to PBS containing 10 µm DHE for 20 min at 37 °C prior to LPS stimulation. Cells were stimulated with LPS (5 µg/ml) in PBS containing 10 µm DHE and 0.5% FBS for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then scraped off the plates and kept on ice prior to fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. For experiments which included superoxide dismutase pretreatments, cells were incubated in PBS containing 1000 units/ml purified superoxide dismutase enzyme (Sigma, catalog number S2525) and 10 µm DHE for 20 min prior to LPS treatment. LPS (5 µg/ml) stimulation was carried out in PBS containing 10 µm DHE, 1000 units/ml superoxide dismutase, and 0.5% FBS for 30 min at 37 °C. Total RNA was isolated using the Absolutely RNA RT-PCR Miniprep Kit according to manufacturers instructions (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). RNA was quantified using the RiboGreen Kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Total RNA was reversed transcribed to cDNA using the RETROscript RT-PCR Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). PCR amplification was then performed in an iCycler iQ Fluorescence Thermocyler (Bio-Rad) as follows: 3 min at 95 °C, followed by 45 cycles of 20 s at 95 °C, 20 s at 58 °C, 20 s at 72 °C, and 10 s at 79 °C. Fluorescence data was captured during the dwell at 79 °C. Data were collected and recorded by iCycler iQ software (Bio-Rad) and expressed as a function of threshold cycle (C t), the cycle at which the fluorescence intensity in a given reaction tube rises above background. Specific primer sets for murine TLR and HPRT genes were as follows (5′ → 3′): TLR2 sense, TGGTTCTTTTCCCAAACTGG and antisense, GCTTTCTTGGGCTTCCTCTT; TLR4 sense ATTGCTTGGCGAATGTTTCT and antisense, GACCCATGAAATTGGCACTC;TLR6 sense TCTGCAACATGAGCCAAGAC and antisense, GTTTTGCAACCGATTGTGTG; HPRT sense, CCTCATGGACTGATTATGGAC and antisense, CAGATTCAACTTGCGCTCATC. Primers were selected based on nucleotide sequences downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information data bank and designed with software by Steve Rozen and Helen J. Skaletsky ((1998) Primer3, code available at genome.wi.mit.edu/genome_software/other/primer3.html). PCR conditions and data collection dwell temperature were based on melting curve analysis of each amplimer generated by the primers listed above. Data was captured at 4 °C below the lowest melting temperature among all amplimers assayed to ensure that primer-dimers were not contributing to the fluorescence signal generated with SYBR Green I DNA Dye. Relative quantitative gene expression was calculated as follows. For each sample assayed, the C t for reactions amplifyingTLR2, TLR4, TLR6, and HPRTwere determined. HPRT was used as an internal reference. TheC t for each TLR gene was then corrected by subtracting the C t for HPRT(ΔC t). Untreated controls were chosen as the reference samples, and the ΔC t for all LPS-treated experimental samples were subtracted from the ΔC tfor the control samples (ΔΔC t). Finally, LPS-treated TLR2, TLR4, and TLR6 mRNA abundance relative to control TLR2, TLR4, andTLR6 mRNA abundance was calculated by the formula 2−(ΔΔCt). The validity of this approach was confirmed by using serial 10-fold dilutions of templates containingTLR and HPRT genes. Using this set of template mixtures, the amplification efficiencies for TLR2, TLR4, TLR6, and HPRT amplimers were found to be identical. Previous reports have demonstrated that antioxidants significantly inhibit LPS-mediated activation of NFκB and subsequent TNFα secretion (48Chandel N.S. Trzyna W.C. McClintock D.S. Schumacker P.T. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 49Peristeris P. Clark B.D. Gatti S. Faggioni R. Mantovani A. Mengozzi M. Orencole S.F. Sironi M. Ghezzi P. Cell.

We hypothesized that Rac1 might be a central molecular regulator of LPS-induced changes in the cellular redox state promoting the induction of proinflammatory signal transduction pathways. In order to test whether Rac1 activity was elevated following LPS treatment, an assay developed by Glaven and colleagues (42Glaven J.A. Whitehead I. Bagrodia S. Kay R. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2279-2285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) was utilized. This assay was used to specifically detect the abundance of GTP-bound (activated) Rac1 by immunoprecipitation with a GST-PBD fusion protein in a macrophage cell line (RAW). In support of our initial hypothesis, the abundance of GTP-bound Rac1 increased significantly as early as 5 min after treatment of RAW cells with LPS, but not in mock treated controls (Fig.1). These studies indicate that Rac1 is activated early during the cellular response to LPS. TNFα secretion following LPS challenge is well known to correlate with the induction of NFκB DNA binding activity (48Chandel N.S. Trzyna W.C. McClintock D.S. Schumacker P.T. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar,50Wahl C. Liptay S. Adler G. Schmid R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1163-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), which acts at sites in the TNFα promoter to induce expression. Given our results demonstrating the activation of Rac1 by LPS, we next sought to determine whether this pathway induces TNFα secretion via the NFκB signal transduction pathway. To approach this question, RAW cells were infected with a recombinant adenovirus expressing either the dominant negative mutant form of Rac1 (Ad.N17Rac1), or β-galactosidase (Ad.CMVLacZ) as a negative control, 48 h prior to LPS stimulation and assessment of TNFα levels in the media. As seen as in Fig. 2 A, a maximal 41% reduction in TNFα secretion was achieved when RAW cells were infected with Ad.N17Rac1 at an m.o.i. 10,000 DNA particles/cell (the infection efficiency was >95%).

A human lung cancer cell line that expresses the temperature sensitive murine p53 was utilized to quantitate mRNA levels of various genes at different time points after shifting the temperature to 32 degrees C. Inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide (CHX) was used to distinguish between primary and secondary target genes regulated by p53. In the absence of CHX, 259 and 125 genes were up or down-regulated respectively; only 38 and 24 of these genes were up and down-regulated by p53 also in the presence of CHX and are considered primary targets in this cell line. Cluster analysis of these data using the super paramagnetic clustering (SPC) algorithm demonstrate that the primary genes can be distinguished as a single cluster among a large pool of p53 regulated genes. This procedure identified additional genes that co-cluster with the primary targets and can also be classified as such genes. In addition to cell cycle (e.g. p21, TGF-beta, Cyclin E) and apoptosis (e.g. Fas, Bak, IAP) related genes, the primary targets of p53 include genes involved in many aspects of cell function, including cell adhesion (e.g. Thymosin, Smoothelin), signaling (e.g. H-Ras, Diacylglycerol kinase), transcription (e.g. ATF3, LISCH7), neuronal growth (e.g. Ninjurin, NSCL2) and DNA repair (e.g. BTG2, DDB2). The results suggest that p53 activates concerted opposing signals and exerts its effect through a diverse network of transcriptional changes that collectively alter the cell phenotype in response to stress."
https://openalex.org/W2162613182,"A precise pH gradient between organelles of the regulated secretory pathway is required for sorting and processing of prohormones. We studied pH regulation in live endocrine cells by targeting biotin-based pH indicators to cellular organelles expressing avidin-chimera proteins. In AtT-20 cells, we found that steady-state pH decreased from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (pHER = 7.4 ± 0.2, mean ± S.D.) to Golgi (pHG = 6.2 ± 0.4) to mature secretory granules (MSGs) (pHMSG= 5.5 ± 0.4). Golgi and MSGs required active H+v-ATPases for acidification. ER, Golgi, and MSG steady-state pH values were also dependent upon the different H+ leak rates across each membrane. However, neither steady-state pHMSG nor rates of passive H+ leak were affected by Cl−-free solutions or valinomycin, indicating that MSG membrane potential was small and not a determinant of pHMSG. Therefore, our data do not support earlier suggestions that organelle acidification is primarily regulated by Cl− conductances. Measurements of H+ leak rates, buffer capacities, and estimates of surface areas and volumes of these organelles were applied to a mathematical model to determine the H+ permeability (P H+) of each organelle membrane. We found that P H+ decreased progressively from ER to Golgi to MSGs, and proper acidification of Golgi and MSGs required gradual decreases inP H+ and successive increases in the active H+ pump density.

Even small pH differences between organelles can be critical in separating cellular events. For example, a difference of <0.5 pH can determine whether a prohormone is processed (1Schmidt W.K.

In professional secretory cells (e.g. endocrine and neuroendocrine), “regulated” secretory proteins have been hypothesized to be sorted from constitutively secreted proteins by a process of pH- and calcium-dependent selective aggregation (2Gerdes H.H.

The exact site where aggregation occurs is controversial, largely due to the lack of direct measurements of organelle pH along the regulated secretory pathway. The “sorting for entry” model postulates that sorting occurs when proteins encounter the ionic milieu of the trans-Golgi network (3Chanat E. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1505-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In contrast, the “sorting by retention” model asserts that aggregation serves to retain regulated proteins in granules and does not occur until prohormones have entered acidic immature secretory granules (ISGs)1 and become proteolytically processed (5Arvan P.

In live cell pH measurements using the green fluorescent protein derivative pHlorin (12Miesenböck G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1998; 394: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar), secretory granules of mast cells were also acidic (pH 5.2).

In contrast, in “regulated” cells, experiments using DAMP detected no acidification of Golgi in pancreatic islet cells (7Orci L. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Madsen O. Perrelet A. Vassalli J.D.

Cell. 1987; 49: 865-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether the conflicting Golgi pH data are due to differences in cell type or techniques used. Therefore, although there is general agreement regarding the acidity of MSGs, the exact pH of Golgi versus ISGs (and hence the site of sorting) in regulated secretory cells remains in question. Furthermore, although the dynamics of pH regulation in the Golgi and ER of non-regulated cells has been extensively studied, there has been no examination of the pH regulatory mechanisms of Golgi and MSGs in live, intact cells with regulated secretory pathways. pH studies of these organelles have been limited to either fixed cells or isolated organelles in vitro. Data from these studies suggested that Golgi and secretory granules controlled their acidic pH values by altering their conductances to Cl−, which served as a counterion for the H+ v-ATPase (6Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 9Barasch J. Gershon M.D. Nunez E.A. Tamir H. al-Awqati Q. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2137-2147Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Experiments on isolated synaptic vesicles also supported a critical role for Cl− in organelle acidification (22Maycox P.R.

These results led to the general hypothesis that acidic organelles maintain distinct lumenal pH values by maintaining different permeabilities to Cl−, the primary counterion (24Al-Awqati Q. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1986; 2: 179-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). However, experiments in non-regulated cells demonstrated that although Cl− and K+ did serve as counterions for H+ pumping, Cl− and K+ conductances were large compared with the passive H+ conductance, arguing against modulation of Cl− and K+ conductances as a mechanism for trans-Golgi network or Golgi pH regulation (18Demaurex N.

In addition, the pH-dependent processing of secretogranin II measuredin vitro was not stimulated by increasing the outside Cl− concentration (11Urbe S. Dittie A.S. Tooze S.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, the exact mechanisms regulating acidification along the regulated secretory pathway are unknown. To begin to address the controversies and the gaps in our understanding of pH regulation in organelles of the regulated secretory pathway, we targeted pH indicators to the ER, Golgi, and MSGs to study the pH regulatory mechanisms in live, intact endocrine cells. We chose the AtT-20 mouse pituitary cell line because it has a well characterized regulated secretory pathway. The data presented in this paper represent the first study of pH regulation in MSGs of live, intact cells, and the first systematic comparison of the pH regulatory mechanisms between the major organelles of the regulated secretory pathway. We tested for the importance of Cl− and K+ conductances in determining pHG and pHMSG by eliminating Cl− from the solutions and by using the K+ionophore valinomycin. In addition, since H+ leaks appear to be crucial determinants of organelle pH (18Demaurex N. Furuya W. D'Souza S. Bonifacino J.S. Grinstein S. J. Biol.

Oster G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) to calculate H+ permeabilities for each organelle. From our experimental data and mathematical modeling, we found that the acidification step between the ER and Golgi in AtT-20 cells was similar to that in non-regulated cells (21Wu M.M. Llopis J.

An avidin-pro-opiomelanocortin (AV-POMC)-encoding plasmid was constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of avidin (Dr. Markku Kulomaa, University of Jyvaskyla, Finland) using primers (5′-cgcgggaagcttgccaccatggtgcacgcaacctcc-3′ and 5′-cgcgggggatcctccttctgtgtgcgcag-3′), which allowed isolation of avidin by HindIII and BamHI digestion. A signal sequence-lacking POMC was polymerase chain reaction-amplified from mouse POMC (gift from Dr. Edward Herbert) using primers 5′-cgcggggatccctggtgcctggagagcagc-3′ and 5′-cgcgggggcggccgctcactggcccttcttgtg-3′ and isolated by digestion withBamHI and NotI. Avidin and POMC were ligated into sIg-7-poly vector (Dr. Brian Seed, Massachusetts General Hospital) using HindIII, BamHI, and NotI sites (avidin replaced Ig). AtT-20 cells were grown as described previously (1Schmidt W.K. Moore H.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1271-1285Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Golgi and MSG pH experiments were performed on AtT-20 cells that were either transiently transfected (by electroporation, see below) or stably transfected (27Chavez R.A. Chen Y.T. Schmidt W.K. Carnell L. Moore H.P. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 43: 263-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) with AV-POMC DNA. ER pH experiments were performed on AtT-20 cells transiently transfected with AV-KDEL DNA by electroporation. 24 h before electroporation, AtT-20 cells were passaged to obtain a 50% confluent 15-cm dish. On the day of electroporation, cells were trypsinized, rinsed with normal growth medium, and pelleted. The cell pellet was rinsed with cold DMEM, re-pelleted, and resuspended in 300 µl of cold DMEM. 100 µg of AV-POMC or AV-KDEL DNA and 50 µg of a puromycin resistance gene-encoding plasmid (pSFPACEBv, Dr. Brian Seed) were combined, phenol/chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in 100 µl of DMEM. To electroporate, the 300 µl of cells were mixed with the 100 µl of DNA, incubated for 5 min on ice, and transferred to a cold 0.4-cm gap cuvette. Cells were electroporated at 250 V, 0 ohm resistance, and 960 microfarads using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser. After electroporation, cells recovered for 10 min on ice before being replated onto a 15-cm plate. 24 h post-transfection, 0.75 µg/ml of puromycin (Sigma) was added to the cell medium to select for positive transfectants. After 48 h of puromycin treatment, cells were replated onto laminin-coated coverslips and allowed to recover 24 h before imaging experiments were performed. Because the expression level of AV-POMC in AtT-20 stable cell lines was too low for fluorescence imaging experiments, we used a butyrate incubation protocol, described previously (28Grote E. Hao J.C. Bennett M.K. Kelly R.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), to boost expression of AV-POMC. Butyrate prevents histone deacetylation, inducing expression from viral promoters. AV-POMC stably expressing AtT-20 cells were plated on laminin-coated coverslips; 24 h after plating, cells were incubated in 6 mm sodium butyrate in normal growth medium for 15 h. After butyrate induction, cells were rinsed once in a large volume of DMEM and chased in normal growth medium for at least 34 h before loading with Flubi dyes. The butyrate incubation had no effect on endogenous POMC or AV-POMC processing, indicating that MSG pH was unaffected by this protocol (data not shown). Cell cytosol was labeled using BCECF-AM and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran as described previously (21Wu M.M. Llopis J. Adams S. McCaffery J.M. Kulomaa M.S. Machen T.E. Moore H.P. Tsien R.Y.

We used AV-KDEL-expressing AtT-20 cells to monitor ER pH and AV-POMC-expressing AtT-20 cells to monitor the pH of both Golgi and MSGs. To label the avidin-containing lumens of ER, Golgi, and MSGs, the cell-permeable Flubi-2 diacetate (Flubida-2, ∼2 mm) was mixed 1:1 with Pluronic F-127 (20% w/v in dry Me2SO) and then diluted to the desired final concentration with DMEM containing <2% fetal calf serum. AV-KDEL- or AV-POMC-expressing cells were rinsed with DMEM, loaded with 2–4 µm Flubida-2 dye for 4–6 h, and then chased with normal growth medium for 0–2 h (0 h of chase for Golgi measurements; >2 h of chase for MSG measurements) at 37 °C. Cytosol, ER, Golgi, and MSG pH values were measured in separate experiments using digitally processed fluorescence ratio imaging. Ratio imaging measurements were performed at room temperature as described previously (21Wu M.M. Llopis J. Adams S. McCaffery J.M. Kulomaa M.S. Machen T.E. Moore H.P. Tsien R.Y.

MSG pH was measured by collecting data from only the brightly labeled tips of cell processes of AtT-20 cells. Ringer's, NH4Cl Ringer's, and Cl−-free, and sodium-free Ringer's solutions were all prepared as described previously (21Wu M.M. Llopis J. Adams S. McCaffery J.M. Kulomaa M.S. Machen T.E. Moore H.P. Tsien R.Y. Chemistry and Biology. 2000; 7: 197-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Calibration solutions were also prepared as described previously (21Wu M.M.

Chemistry and Biology. 2000; 7: 197-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), except the solutions were titrated to the following pH values: 8.2, 7.0, 6.5, 6.0, 5.4, and 4.9. In situcalibrations were performed and the data fit to calibration curves, and the calibration curves were used to convert ratio values to pH values exactly as described (21Wu M.M. Llopis J. Adams S. McCaffery J.M. Kulomaa M.S. Machen T.E. Moore H.P. Tsien R.Y. Chemistry and Biology. 2000; 7: 197-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Rates of H+ leak out of ER, Golgi, MSG, and plasma membranes were calculated by fitting the data to the single exponential equation: y =A(1 − e −kt) using GraphPad InPlot (Kelvin Gee, Irvine, CA). Rate constants (k) and half-times (t 12) were determined from the curve fits. Since H+ leak rates across organelle membranes are affected by buffer capacity (β) and surface area-to-volume (S/V) ratio, differences in β orS/V between organelles could account for differences in H+ leak rates. We accounted for β andS/V ratio values of each organelle by calculating intrinsic H+ permeabilities, P H+, for ER, Golgi, and MSGs using data from experiments such as those shown in Figs. 3C and 4and the model described below. In order to calculate H+ permeabilities, we had to first measure β of the cytosol, ER, Golgi, and MSGs of AtT-20 cells. β was calculated from the magnitudes of rapid increases in pH of each compartment during perfusion with solutions containing 20, 30, or 40 mmNH4Cl or from rapid decreases in pH of compartments during perfusion with solutions containing 20 or 30 mm sodium acetate. Values of β for ER, Golgi, and MSGs were determined using bafilomycin-pretreated cells (500 nm, >2 h) so that the base-line pH values, prior to NH4Cl or sodium acetate treatment, were similar for all the compartments. For NH4Cl experiments, using pK = 9.0 for the NH 4+ → H+ + NH3 reaction and assuming that NH3 equilibrates equally across all the membranes, β was calculated from the change in pH (extrapolated to time 0) during the switch from Ringer's to NH4Cl according to (31Roos A. Boron W.F. Physiol. Rev. 1981; 61: 296-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2297) Google Scholar) Equation 1. β=[NH4+]/ΔpHEquation 1 For sodium acetate experiments, using pK = 4.7 for the CH3CO2H → H+ + CH3CO 2− reaction and assuming that CH3CO2H equilibrates equally across all the membranes, β was calculated from the change in pH (extrapolated to time 0) during the switch from Ringer's to sodium acetate according to Equation 3, β=−[CH3CO2−]/ΔpHEquation 2 After determining key physical characteristics for each organelle, such as β, a mathematical model for the movement of H+ across the organelle was required in order to predict the H+ permeability of the membrane. We employed a model that has been shown to be in quantitative agreement with a diverse range of organelle pH and membrane potential data (26Grabe M. Oster G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 329-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Our present modeling effort is a subset of this more complete model in that we ignored H+ pumping by the H+ v-ATPase, since all the permeability measurements were performed in the presence of bafilomycin. Given this, the measured rate of change of lumenal pH is related to the passive flux of H+ and the physical characteristics of the organelle as shown in Equation 3, dpHdt=1β0·SV·JleakEquation 3 where J leak is the total passive flux of H+ across a unit area of membrane, and β0 is the organelle buffer capacity. We used surface areas, S, and volumes, V, of ER and Golgi as determined from terminal tubule and acinar cells of the rat submandibular gland (32Taga R. Alvares E.P. Sesso A. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 1993; 56: 517-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar);S and V of MSGs were based on a 200-m diameter sphere (33Gumbiner B. Kelly R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although our H+ permeability calculations were determined for AtT-20 (mouse anterior pituitary) cells, we used theS and V values from Taga et al. (32Taga R. Alvares E.P. Sesso A. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 1993; 56: 517-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) because this was the only published report where S andV for both ER and Golgi membranes were measured in the same cell type.Figure 4pH recoveries of AtT-20 cell compartments after an acid load. The pH recoveries of cytosol, ER, Golgi, and MSGs were measured in either BCECF-AM-loaded or Flubi-2-loaded, bafilomycin-pretreated, intact cells by acid-loading the cytosol (Cyto) and organelles with an NH3/NH 4+ pulse, followed by a washout with sodium-free Ringer's (0 Na R) before allowing the pH values to recover in sodium-containing Ringer's (Ringer's). This protocol is illustrated in Awith typical results for cytosol (black) and MSG (green) pH. B, only the pH recovery traces for each organelle are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We modeled the H+ leak, J leak, as simple passive diffusion. With this assumption, the leak depends on the membrane potential and the concentration gradient as shown in Equation4, Jleak=PH+z⋅U⋅([CH+]O−[CH+]C⋅e−zU1−e−zUEquation 4 where P H+ is the H+permeability of the membrane; C H+ is the concentration of H+ in the organelle (O) or cytosol (C); z is the valence of the H+; andU = ΨF/(RT), where Ψ is the organelle membrane potential. We computed Ψ in terms of the excess charge inside the organelle membrane, which was treated as a parallel plate capacitor (Equation 5), Ψ=F⋅VCm⋅[K+]O−[Cl]O+∫pHOpHGβ0⋅dpH-BEquation 5 where C m is the total capacitance of the membrane (calculated assuming capacitance = 1 microfarad/cm2); [K+]O and [Cl−]O are the concentrations of K+and Cl− in the organelle (based on previous experiments, we assumed that K+ and Cl− diffuse across organelle membranes according to equations of the form (4Colomer V. Kicska G.A. Rindler M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 48-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar)); the integral term represents the total H+ in the organelle lumen (both buffered and free), and B (a constant) is the concentration of charged species trapped in the organelle. In the absence of any membrane-energizing enzymes, one expects H+to diffuse across the organelle membrane until the lumenal pH and the cytosolic pH are equal. However, this is often not the case for organelles that have been treated with bafilomycin (16Kim J.H. Lingwood C.A. Williams D.B. Furuya W. Manolson M.F. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1387-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 21Wu M.M. Llopis J. Adams S. McCaffery J.M. Kulomaa M.S. Machen T.E. Moore H.P. Tsien R.Y. Chemistry and Biology. 2000; 7: 197-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar); furthermore, at rest, the distribution of H+ across a membrane can be manipulated by the distribution of other ionic species (34Langridge-Smith J.E. Dubinsky W.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 94: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This discrepancy can be attributed to trapped, negatively charged species inside the organelle that, in the absence of an active H+ v-ATPase, lead to an accumulation of H+. Our model accounts for the difference in steady-state pH between organelle lumen and cytosol only through changes in the parameter B. Average values of B varied between ∼50 and 200 mm. Average B values determined from the model for ER, Golgi, and MSGs did not significantly contribute to the different steady-state pH values of these compartments. From our buffer capacity measurements, we know that a significant number of H+ are transported into/out of the organelle during acidification/alkalinization. If this change in charge is not off-set by the subsequent movement of counterions, a large membrane potential will build up across the organelle membrane and quickly limit further changes in pH. This physical insight suggests that organelles that undergo acidification must be permeable to some counterions. However, it is unclear which ions are permeable and how fast their movement is compared with the movement of H+. Schapiro and Grinstein (25Schapiro F.B. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21025-21032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) have convincingly shown"

Comparing this structure with that of the ATP-bound form of the HisP ATP-binding cassette (Hung, L. W., Wang, I. X., Nikaido, K., Liu, P. Q., Ames, G. F., and Kim, S. H. (1998) Nature 396, 703–707) shows a 5-Å withdrawal of a phylogenetically invariant glutamine residue from contact with the γ-phosphate of ATP in the active site. This glutamine is located in a protein segment that links the rigid F1-type ATP-binding core of the enzyme to an ABC transporter-specific α-helical subdomain that moves substantially away from the active site in the MgADP-bound structure of MJ0796 compared with the ATP-bound structure of HisP. A similar conformational effect is observed in the MgADP-bound structure of MJ1267 (Karpowich, N., et al.(2001)Structure, in press), establishing the withdrawal of the glutamine and the coupled outward rotation of the α-helical subdomain as consistent consequences of γ-phosphate release from the active site of the transporter. Considering this subdomain movement in the context of a leading model for the physiological dimer of cassettes present in ABC transporters indicates that it produces a modest mechanical change that is likely to play a role in facilitating nucleotide exchange out of the ATPase active site. Finally, it is noteworthy that one of the intersubunit packing interactions in the MJ0796 crystal involves antiparallel β-type hydrogen bonding interactions between the outermost β-strands in the two core β-sheets, leading to their fusion into a single extended β-sheet, a type of structural interaction that has been proposed to play a role in mediating the aggregation of β-sheet-containing proteins.

Based on the fact that the nearly phylogenetically invariant LSGGQ sequence (1Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3346) Google Scholar, 12Schmees G. Stein A.

Although these crystal structures have provided substantial insight into the structural basis of ABC transporter activity, additional data are needed to define both the structural consequences of the significant sequence variability observed in the N- and C-terminal regions of the cassettes and also the nature of the nucleotide-dependent changes in cassette structure that control the conformational reaction cycle of the ABC transporters.

https://openalex.org/W2146368001,"Bile acids regulate the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase gene (CYP7A1), which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme in the classical pathway of bile acid synthesis. Here we report a novel mechanism whereby bile acid feedback regulatesCYP7A1 transcription through the nuclear receptorhepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4), which binds to the bile acid response element (BARE) at nt −149/−118 relative to the transcription start site. Using transient transfection assays of HepG2 cells with Gal4-HNF-4 fusion proteins, we show that chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) dampened the transactivation potential of HNF-4. Overexpression of a constitutive active form of MEKK1, an upstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) module triggered by stress signals, strongly repressed the promoter activity ofCYP7A1 via the consensus sequence for HNF-4 embedded in the BARE. Similarly, MEKK1 inhibited the activity of HNF-4 in the Gal4-based assay. The involvement of the MEKK1-dependent pathway in the bile acid-mediated repression of CYP7A1 was confirmed by co-transfecting a dominant negative form of the stress-activated protein kinase kinase, SEK, which abolished the effect of CDCA upon CYP7A1transcription. Treatment of transfected HepG2 cells with tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), an activator of the MEKK1 pathway, led to the repression of CYP7A1 via the HNF-4 site in the BARE. TNF-α also inhibited the transactivation potential of HNF-4. Collectively, our results demonstrate for the first time that HNF-4, in combination with a MAPK signaling pathway, acts as a bile acid sensor in the liver. Furthermore, the effects of CDCA and TNF-α converge to HNF-4, which binds to the BARE of CYP7A1, suggesting a link between the cascades elicited by bile acids and pro-inflammatory stimuli in the liver."
https://openalex.org/W2333831054,"Rejoining of ionizing radiation (IR) induced DNA DSBs usually follows biphasic kinetics with a fast (t50: 5–30 min) component attributed to DNA-PK-dependent non-homologous endjoining (NHEJ) and a slow (t50: 1–20 h), as of yet uncharacterized, component. To examine whether homologous recombination (HR) contributes to DNA DSB rejoining, a systematic genetic study was undertaken using the hyper-recombinogenic DT40 chicken cell line and a series of mutants defective in HR. We show that DT40 cells rejoin IR-induced DNA DSBs with half times of 13 min and 4.5 h and contributions by the fast (78%) and the slow (22%) components similar to those of other vertebrate cells with 1000-fold lower levels of HR. We also show that deletion of RAD51B, RAD52 and RAD54 leaves unchanged the rejoining half times and the contribution of the slow component, as does also a conditional knock out mutant of RAD51. A significant reduction (to 37%) in the contribution of the fast component is observed in Ku70−/− DT40 cells, but the slow component, operating with a half time of 18.4 h, is still able to rejoin the majority (63%) of DSBs. A double mutant Ku70−/−/RAD54−/− shows similar half times to Ku70−/− cells. Thus, variations in HR by several orders of magnitude leave unchanged the kinetics of rejoining of DNA DSBs, and fail to modify the contribution of the slow component in a way compatible with a dependence on HR. We propose that, in contrast to yeast, cells of vertebrates are ‘hard-wired’ in the utilization of NHEJ as the main pathway for rejoining of IR-induced DNA DSBs and speculate that the contribution of homologous recombination repair (HRR) is at a stage after the initial rejoining."
https://openalex.org/W1977251381,"Proprotein convertases (PCs) of the subtilisin/kexin family are responsible for the activation of prohormones, protrophic factors, and their receptors. We sought to determine whether loss of PC-mediated activities might affect the malignant phenotypes of cancer cells. Stable transfectants of α1-antitrypsin Portland (α1-PDX) cDNA, coding for a potent PC inhibitor, were analyzed in model HT-29 cells (HT-29/PDX) and in other cell lines. Expression of α1-PDX resulted in a proinsulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (pro-IGF-1R) processing blockade, hence inhibiting the ability of exogenous IGF-1 to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of its β-subunit and insulin-related substrate-1. Coexpression of IGF-1R with four different PCs or the novel convertase SKI-1 in the furin-defective LoVo-C5 cells demonstrated that pro-IGF-1R (∼200 kDa) cleavage into IGF-1R (β-subunit, ∼105 kDa) can be achieved by furin and PC5A, but not by PACE4, PC7, or SKI-1. Expression of α1-PDX resulted in reduction of DNA synthesis and in anchorage-independent growth. Following serum deprivation, the α1-PDX transfectants exhibited an enhanced apoptotic phenotype and were insensitive to IGF-1-mediated [3H]thymidine incorporation and protection against apoptosis. These cells showed reduced invasiveness that paralleled decreased mRNA levels of urokinase-type plasminogen activator and its receptor, tissue-type plasminogen activator, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. Comparative subcutaneous inoculation of cells in nude mice revealed that animals injected with HT-29/PDX cells exhibited delayed and lower incidence of tumor development as well as reduced tumor size. Immunohistochemical analysis of CD31 antigen expression, a marker of endothelial cells, revealed reduced HT-29/PDX tumor vascularization. These findings indicate that PCs actively contribute to the growth and malignant phenotypes of HT-29 tumors, suggesting that PC inhibition strategies may be a useful adduct to the arsenal of colorectal anticancer gene therapies.

The control (pBK-CMV vector; HT-29/CTL) and stably α1-PDX (HT-29/PDX)-transfected HT-29-D4 human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines were derived from a pool of Pseudomonas Exotoxin A-resistant clones as previously described (45Berthet V.

LoVo-C5 human colon adenocarcinoma cells were transiently transfected with the empty pIRES2-EGFP vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) or with one that expresses full-length human furin, PACE4, SKI-1, mouse PC5A, or rat PC7 (4Seidah N.G. Chrétien M. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) using Effectene transfection reagent (QIAGEN Inc., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) as recommended by the manufacturer. Jurkat cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium, and HT-29, LoVo-C5, and AtT20 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, both supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). In both culture media, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc., Burlington, Ontario), and, for stable transfectants, 200 µg/ml G418 were added. Cells were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2% Nonidet P-40; lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 8% gels; and proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-human IGF-1R polyclonal antibody recognizing carboxyl-terminal amino acids 1447–1366 (1:1000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-phosphotyrosine (2 µg/ml) and anti-actin (1:1000 dilution) antibodies (Sigma, Oakville, Ontario). Primary antibodies were revealed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10000 dilution; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Baie-d'Urfé, Quebec, Canada) and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL+Plus, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Band intensities of the autoradiographs were quantitated by densitometry. Confluent HT-29/CTL and HT-29/PDX cells grown in 75-cm2 flasks were maintained in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h and incubated with or without 50 ng/ml IGF-1 for 2 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and lysed with 500 µl/dish lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm vanadate, 100 mm NaF, and 0.40 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Equal amounts of proteins (1 mg) were immunoprecipitated overnight with anti-IGF-1R or IRS-1 polyclonal antibody (10 µg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and the whole pellets were analyzed by Western blotting. [3H]Thymidine incorporation in 2 × 104 cells/well in 96-well culture plates was assayed as follows. 24 h hours after plating, cells were incubated in a growth arrest medium (0.5% FCS) for the next 24 h and then incubated for an additional 24 h in fresh medium containing various concentrations of serum or IGF-1. For the last 6 h of incubation, 0.5 µCi/well [3H]methylthymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added. Cells were then harvested onto glass-fiber filters using a cell harvester (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland) and counted using a Betaplate liquid scintillation counter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Results are expressed as percentages of the values obtained for vector-transfected cells in the absence of serum. Doubling times were assessed by cell counting with a hemocytometer following culture of 10,000 cells/well in 12-well plates for 3 days. To assay anchorage-independent colony formation, 4 × 103 cells were suspended in complete medium containing 0.3% agar and seeded in triplicate in six-well plates onto a base layer of complete medium containing 0.5% agar. Complete medium was added every 3 days. After 14 days, colonies >100 µm in diameter were counted by inverted microscopy. To induce apoptosis, cells grown on 100-mm dishes to 80% confluency were placed in serum-free medium with or without 100 ng/ml IGF-1 for the indicated time periods. Apoptotic cells were analyzed by cell death and DNA ladder assays and propidium iodide staining. For the cell death assay, floating and attached cells were separately resuspended in 0.4% trypan blue (Life Technologies, Inc.), and cells that had taken up this dye were considered nonviable. The percentage of dead cells was calculated as a ratio of floating dead cells to the total of number of cells/culture dish. For the DNA ladder assay, genomic DNA was isolated from attached cells using the apoptotic DNA ladder detection kit (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and analyzed on 2% agarose gels. For propidium iodide cell staining, cells were incubated in propidium iodide for 5 min, and the percentage of stained cells was determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (Becton Dickinson Inc., San Jose, CA). At least 10,000 cells were examined for each sample. HT-29/CTL and HT-29/PDX cell invasiveness was assessed in vitro using the reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel) assay. Matrigel (0.25 mg/ml; Collaborative Research, Bedford, MA) in PBS was used to coat the filter (8-µm pore size), and human fibronectin (5 µg/ml; Sigma) was used as a chemoattractant in the lower chamber (24-well Transwell plate, Corning Inc., Corning, NY). Cells (5 × 104/6.5-mm filter) were incubated for 48 h, and cells that migrated to the underside of the filters were stained and counted using an inverted microscope. Using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions, total RNA was extracted, and predefined amounts (0.2–4 µg; see below) were reversed-transcribed in a 20-µl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 30 mm KCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dNTPs, and 0.2 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In each case, the 3′-antisense oligonucleotide (2 µm) was used to initiate reverse transcription. The mixture was sequentially incubated for 10 min at 25 °C, for 60 min at 37 °C, and for 5 min at 95 °C. cDNAs were amplified by PCR using the following oligonucleotides: uPAR, CCTGGAGCTTGAAAATCTGC and GGTGATGGTGAGGCTGAGAT (352-bp product); uPA, TTGCTGGTTGTCATTTTTGC and CTCCCACATTGGCTAAGCTC (402-bp product); tPA, GAGATCCCGCCTCTTCTTCT and GGAAAGGGGAAGGAGACTTG (504-bp product); PAI-1, TGGAACTACGGGGCTTACAG and AGTGGCTGGACTTCCTGAGA (554-bp product); and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, TGGAAATCCCATCACCATCT and GTCTTCTGGGTGGCAGTGAT (520-bp product). The PCRs (50 µl) included 10 µl of the cDNA sample, 5 µm each primer, 200 µm dNTPs, and 0.2 units of Taq polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the buffer supplied by the manufacturer. PCR conditions were as follows: 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 56 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C for 25 cycles using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences thermocycler. The quantity of total RNA introduced in the reverse transcription reaction was set independently for each gene product to be below the saturation point of the reaction. Amplified PCR products were analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel. Cells (1 × 106 HT-29/CTL or HT-29/PDX) were injected subcutaneously into 4-week-old male athymic mice. The animals were monitored for tumor formation every 3 days and killed 31 days after injection. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula described by Kyriazis et al. (46Kyriazis A.P. Kyriazis A.A. Scarpelli D.G. Fogh J. Rao M.S. Lepera R. Am. J. Pathol. 1982; 106: 250-260PubMed Google Scholar): tumor volume = (width)2 × length × 0.4. The tumors were removed; embedded in OCT compound; and frozen rapidly in isopentane, which was precooled in liquid nitrogen to −180 °C and stored at −70 °C. 17 days following the subcutaneous injection of HT-29/CTL and HT-29/PDX cells, the developed tumors were frozen, cryosectioned to 10–15 µm at −20 °C, fixed in 4% PBS/paraformaldehyde, and incubated with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol for 20 min at room temperature to block endogenous peroxidase. Slides were rinsed with blocking solution (PBS supplemented with 5% skim milk and 0.1% Tween 20) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-mouse CD31 monoclonal antibody (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) at 1:50 dilution. Following washes in PBS, sections were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (Chemicon International, Inc.) at 1:100 dilution for 2 h, washed, and incubated with diaminobenzidine substrate. Staining was monitored under a microscope, and the reaction was stopped by washing with PBS. The corresponding frozen tumor sections were also stained with hematoxylin and eosin (Sigma). IGF-1R is processed at the RKRR740↓ site into the α- and membrane-bound β-subunits (Fig. 1 A) (42Ullrich A. Gray A. Tam A.W. Yang-Feng T. Tsubokawa M. Collins C. Henzel W. Le Bon T. Kathuria S.

To affirm the involvement of PCs in IGF-1R maturation and to investigate which of them are likely to be the best convertases for this precursor, endogenous IGF-1R processing was examined in furin activity-deficient LoVo-C5 cells (47Takahashi S. Kasai K. Hatsuzawa K. Kitamura N. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Murakami K. Nakayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In these cells, the majority of IGF-1R was expressed as an immature ∼200-kDa form, and only a small amount of the receptor was cleaved to generate its β-subunit (apparent molecular mass of ∼105 kDa), suggesting that PCs other than furin may contribute to this processing. LoVo-C5 cells were thus transfected with furin, PC5A, PC7, PACE4, or SKI-1 cDNA-containing vectors (Fig. 1 B). IGF-1R/total signal intensity ratios, calculated as an indication of cleavage, were found to be 63 and 53% for furin and PC5A, respectively, whereas PC7, PACE4, and SKI-1 did not enhance the cleavage of IGF-1R. The processing of IGF-1R was then examined in control (CTL) and α1-PDX (PDX)-expressing HT-29 pool and Jurkat cells (Fig.1 C). In empty vector-transfected cells (CTL), both unprocessed and mature forms of IGF-1R were detected. However, in α1-PDX-transfected cells, the mature β-subunit was barely detectable. In these cells, pro-IGF-1R was also present as a slower migrating species believed to be a trans-Golgi network-associated form of pro-IGF-1R, as reported for transforming growth factor-β (9Dubois C.M.

We report here the cloning and characterization of three Xenopus Slug promoters: that of the Xenopus tropicalis slug gene and those of two Xenopus laevis Slug pseudoalleles. Although the three genes encode proteins with almost identical amino acid sequences and are expressed with similar spatiotemporal patterns, their 5′-flanking regions are quite different. A striking difference is a deletion in the X. tropicalisgene located precisely at the transcription initiation site that results in the X. tropicalis promoter being inefficient inX. laevis.

NCCs are determined during neurulation at the border of the neural plate, delaminate from the neural tube during and after its closure, and migrate extensively before colonizing various tissues in which they differentiate into various neuronal and non-neuronal cell types (1Le Douarin N.M. Kalcheil C. The Neural Crest. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1999Crossref Google Scholar, 2Christiansen J.H. Coles E.G. Wilkinson D.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 719-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In several species, the related zinc finger transcription factors Slug and Snail are specific early markers of this population: Slug in chick (3Nieto M.A. Sargent M.G. Wilkinson D.G. Cooke J. Science. 1994; 264: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), Snail in mouse (4Nieto M.A. Bennett M.F. Sargent M.G. Wilkinson D.G. Development. 1992; 116: 227-237PubMed Google Scholar, 5Smith D.E. Franco del Amo F. Gridley T. Development. 1992; 116: 1033-1039PubMed Google Scholar) and zebrafish (6Thisse C. Thisse B. Postlethwait J.H. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 86-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and both genes in Xenopus (7Mayor R. Morgan R. Sargent M.G. Development. 1995; 121: 767-777PubMed Google Scholar, 8Essex L.J. Mayor R. Sargent M.G. Dev. Dyn. 1993; 198: 108-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In Xenopus laevis embryos, Slug is expressed from the beginning of neurulation in the presumptive neural crest domain, a strip of cells at the border between the neural plate and presumptive epidermis (7Mayor R. Morgan R. Sargent M.G. Development. 1995; 121: 767-777PubMed Google Scholar). Many studies have used this marker to investigate the molecular basis of NCC induction. Interactions between the neural and non-neural ectoderm seem to be crucial for this induction (9Mancilla A. Mayor R. Dev. Biol. 1996; 177: 580-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 10LaBonne C. Bronner-Fraser M. Development. 1998; 125: 2403-2414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As it is decisive for neural induction, the role of BMP4 inhibition in NCC determination has been extensively studied. By overexpressing a BMP4 antagonist, noggin or chordin, this inhibition has been shown to be necessary but insufficient for XSlug expression, which occurs only in synergy with another lateralizing signal (10LaBonne C. Bronner-Fraser M. Development. 1998; 125: 2403-2414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Mayor R. Guerrero N. Martinez C. Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 12Marchant L. Linker C. Ruiz P. Guerrero N. Mayor R. Dev. Biol. 1998; 198: 319-329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both fibroblast growth factor and Wnt pathways have been suggested as sources of this additional signal (7Mayor R. Morgan R. Sargent M.G. Development. 1995; 121: 767-777PubMed Google Scholar, 11Mayor R. Guerrero N. Martinez C. Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 13Saint-Jeannet J.P. He X. Varmus H.E. Dawid I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13713-13718Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that Wnt is a direct signal required for NCC determination, whereas fibroblast growth factor-dependent XSlug induction would be a consequence of an indirect effect mediated by Wnt (10LaBonne C. Bronner-Fraser M. Development. 1998; 125: 2403-2414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies have contributed to our understanding of the mechanisms of XSlug induction, but most are difficult to interpret definitively because it is difficult to determine whether XSlug is a direct or indirect target of the injected molecules. We cloned theslug promoter to overcome this problem and to analyze precisely the pathways leading to XSlug induction. In this study, we isolated one promoter from Xenopus tropicalis and two different promoters from X. laevis. The sequences of the three promoters seemed very different at first glance; but by detailed comparison, we were able to distinguish two conserved regions that appeared to be necessary and sufficient for specific expression in NCCs. This promoter, used with a simple expression system, is a very powerful tool for targeting NCCs. It can thus be used to study the role of several putative candidate molecules in the determination, migration, and differentiation of these cells. We also report here for the first time an extensive comparison between X. tropicalisand X. laevis promoters, indicating the possibility of differences in transcription mechanisms in these two species, which are assumed to be very closely related. Finally, the two regulatory regions are potential targets for several transcription factors and would be very useful for determining effective XSlug inducers. We report here the presence in one of these regions of a functional Lef/β-catenin-binding site that is necessary for expression in NCCs. This suggests that the Wnt pathway is directly involved inXenopus Slug regulation and that Slug is one of the direct targets of NCC determination signals. The X. tropicalis gene was isolated from a genomic DNA library (kind gift of R. Grainger, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA) by high stringency nonradioactive screening. A 500-bp fragment of previously described X. laevis Slug cDNA (7Mayor R. Morgan R. Sargent M.G. Development. 1995; 121: 767-777PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a probe. X. laevis genes were obtained by PCR. Primers were derived from a 20-bp region common to human, mouse, and X. tropicalis Slug promoters. Combined with several oligonucleotides derived from the X. laevis cDNA, these primers allowed us to amplify two complete X. laevis Slug genes. PCR was carried out with the high fidelity Bio-X-Act polymerase (Bioline, London, United Kingdom), and various clones were sequenced with an ABI310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). 5′- and 3′-ends of mRNA were precisely located with the GeneRacer kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). In silico sequence analyses were performed at the Infobiogen facilities (Evry, France). Wild-type X. laevisembryos were used for all injection experiments. Each construct was inserted in the Sleeping Beauty plasmid between the two inverted terminal repeats (14Ivics Z. Hackett P.B. Plasterk R.H. Izsvak Z. Cell. 1997; 91: 501-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). These inverted terminal repeats enable genomic integration if transposase is co-injected, which was not the case here. Since this plasmid is remarkably stable and nontoxic, it can also be used alone for ectopic expression in Xenopusembryos. In this study, each construct was injected, in a volume of 15 nl, into one blastomere of a two-cell stage embryo. To compare the effects of different constructs, all the injections in a series were performed at the same molarity. If not otherwise stated below, 2 × 10−17 mol of plasmid was injected in 15 nl; for example, this corresponded to 100 pg of the α3000-GFP construct. Injections were performed in 0.33× Marc's modified ringers and 4% Ficoll (15Sive H.L. Grainger R.M. Harland R.M. Early Development of Xenopus laevis: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). Embryos were then transferred to 0.33× Marc's modified ringers and cultured at 18 °C until the desired stage of development. Stages were determined as described by Nieuwkoop and Faber (16Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis (Daudin). Garland Publishing, New York1994Google Scholar). Radioactive semiquantitative RT-PCR, with histone H4 used as an internal control, was performed with a pool of 10 embryos as previously described (17Vallin J. Girault J.M. Thiery J.P. Broders F. Mech. Dev. 1998; 75: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To detect the GFP transcript, we used the following specific primers: U, 5′-GATCCACAGCCACCATGAGTA; and D, 5′-AAAGCATTGAACACCATAAGT. To detect Slug transcripts, the downstream primer 5′-TCGGAAAGTTTGGTTTGGAGTC was combined with 5′-CGGGCGAGGACGAAACCAT for slug α, with 5′-AGGCCGGGGAGGAAACATA for slug β, and with 5′-CTGTGCTACCCCAGCCTGACAT for the amplification of both Slug genes. PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis on 8% native acrylamide gels and analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Whole-mount in situhybridization experiments were performed as described by Harland (18Harland R.M. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 685-695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but with minor modifications (7Mayor R. Morgan R. Sargent M.G. Development. 1995; 121: 767-777PubMed Google Scholar). For each X. laevisSlug gene, the 5′-UTR was used as a short specific probe. Lef-1 was produced by transcription and translation in vitro from a pCIneo construct (kindly provided by A. Ben z'ev, Weissman Institute, Rehovot, Israel) with a coupled transcription and translation kit (Promega, Madison, WI). The recombinant GST/β-catenin fusion protein was purified from lysates of Escherichia coli transformed with pEGX5-β-cat (a gift from A. Cano, Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas, Madrid, Spain). For protein-DNA interaction, Lef-1 and β-catenin produced in vitro were incubated for 30 min with 20,000 cpm of a 32P-labeled duplex oligonucleotide probe containing the predicted Lef-1-binding site of theslug α promoter (Slug-Lef, 5′-GAGTCCCTAGCTTTGTATACGACCTAG) in 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mg of bovine serum albumin, and 10 µg/ml herring sperm DNA. In competition experiments, unlabeled Lef-1 oligonucleotide (Lef-1, 5′-TCGAATTCTCACCCTTTGAAGCTCTT) or its mutated counterpart (mLef-1, 5′-TCGAATTCTCACAATTTCAAGCTCTT) was incubated with the mixture before adding the labeled probe. For supershift assays, 1 µg of anti-β-catenin antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) was used. Protein·DNA complexes were subjected to electrophoresis on 4.5% native acrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. X. laevisis a pseudotetraploid; and during evolution, some of its genes have become silent. So, to ensure that we did not clone an inactive Slug promoter, we cloned the promoter of the slug gene fromX. tropicalis, a very close diploid relative of X. laevis. A 500-bp X. laevis Slug probe corresponding roughly to human slug exon 2 was used to screen an X. tropicalis genomic library at high stringency. We obtained three overlapping positive clones that enabled us to sequence the wholeslug gene and 4 kb of the 5′-flanking region. The predicted amino acid sequence of the protein encoded by the X. tropicalis gene is very similar to that of the publishedX. laevis Slug sequence (7Mayor R. Morgan R. Sargent M.G. Development. 1995; 121: 767-777PubMed Google Scholar), with 99% identity overall and all five zinc fingers totally identical. The organization of the gene is identical to that of the human gene (19Stegmann K. Boecker J. Kosan C. Ermert A. Kunz J. Koch M.C. Mutat. Res. 1999; 406: 63-69PubMed Google Scholar), consisting of two short introns (of 700 bp and 1 kb, respectively) located at the same relative positions in the coding region in both species. The 5′- and 3′-ends of the X. tropicalis Slug cDNA were amplified from late neurula total RNA with the GeneRacer kit. This enabled us to obtain the complete X. tropicalis Slug cDNA sequence. This cDNA was 1.8 kb in size, slightly shorter than the mouse Slug mRNA (20Jiang R. Norton C.R. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Gridley T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1443: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A transcription initiation site (+1) was identified 142 nucleotides upstream from the start codon, and a good putative CAP site (21Bucher P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 563-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar) was present nearby: 80% maximum score and centered on +7. Moreover, the upstream region contained a putative TATA box (70% score and centered on −28), a putative CCAAT box, and two GC boxes. These results suggest that the cloned flanking region is a good candidate for the X. tropicalis slug promoter. To test the activity of the X. tropicalis slug promoter in vivo, deletion constructs were produced with the GFP gene as a reporter gene. These constructs were cloned in the Sleeping Beauty plasmid (14Ivics Z. Hackett P.B. Plasterk R.H. Izsvak Z. Cell. 1997; 91: 501-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). Injected intoX. laevis at the two-cell stage, this plasmid remains present at high levels throughout early development, at least until late tail-bud stages, and enables expression of ectopic proteins under the control of specific promoters. 2J. Vallin, E. Giacomello, I. S. Coulter, J. P. Thiery, and F. Broders, submitted for publication. This technique has the great advantage of being simple and harmless for the embryos. Thus, a large number of injected embryos can be obtained in a single experiment, making it possible to obtain statistically significant results with many different constructs. We assayed various fragments of the X. tropicalis slug promoter, from 200 bp to 4 kb in length, in which the GFP coding region was inserted just downstream from the CAP site. The GFP coding region inserted downstream from the 5′-UTR of the X. tropicalis Slug cDNA was used as a negative control (Fig.1 A). Several series of injections were performed with each of these constructs, but no fluorescence was ever detected. We tested for GFP mRNA by semiquantitative RT-PCR of stage 19 NF injected embryos. The GFP transcript was detected in various quantities, depending on the construct injected (Fig. 1 A). The constructs p200-GFP and p3900-GFP (including 200 and 3900 bp of the X. tropicalis slug promoter, respectively) gave relatively high levels of expression. These results show that the X. tropicalis slug promoter was able to drive GFP expression in X. laevis embryos. Nevertheless, the efficiency of this promoter could not be compared with that of the endogenous promoter in this assay. We investigated promoter efficiency by making new constructs with the two most efficient regions of the X. tropicalis slug promoter. These fragments were cloned upstream from a modified X. laevis Slug cDNA containing an insertion (Fig. 1 B). This enabled us to detect in injected embryos the products of both the endogenous and exogenous promoters with the same set of primers and thus to perform comparative RT-PCR. The results show that the exogenous and endogenous products were produced in similar amounts (Fig. 1 B). As expected, the relative quantity of exogenous Slug decreased over time because the number of plasmid copies/cell decreased during the course of development.2However, with this method, each cell should be considered to contain ∼20 copies of the plasmid at stage 19 NF. Therefore, if the two promoters were similar in efficiency, the exogenous product would be produced in substantial excess over the endogenous product. Our results indicate that the region of the X. tropicalis slug promoter isolated was inefficient in X. laevis embryos. There may be two reasons for this: either this region did not contain all the regulatory elements, or the regulatory process differed between X. tropicalis and X. laevis. A PCR approach was used to clone the 5′-flanking region of the X. laevis slug gene. Comparison of the sequences of Slug promoters from X. tropicalis, humans (19Stegmann K. Boecker J. Kosan C. Ermert A. Kunz J. Koch M.C. Mutat. Res. 1999; 406: 63-69PubMed Google Scholar), and mice 3P. Savagner, unpublished data. revealed no similarity except a common 20-bp region, located at −3.2 kb in X. tropicalis, −1.5 kb in humans, and −1.2 kb in mice. We designed two primers in this common region and used them with two primers corresponding to the Slug coding region to perform nested PCR onX. laevis genomic DNA. We obtained two types of amplicon containing 3 and 1.7 kb upstream from the ATG codon, respectively. Several subfragments were amplified, and a large number of clones were sequenced to obtain the complete sequences of these two genes. The genetic organization of these two clones was identical (Fig. 2 A), and their predicted coding sequences were very similar (TableI), with 96% identity at the nucleotide level, compared with 67% identity between XSlug and the related zinc finger protein Xenopus Snail (22Sargent M.G. Bennett M.F. Development. 1990; 109: 967-973PubMed Google Scholar). This high level of similarity indicated that we had cloned two Slug pseudoalleles. The first (with 3 kb of 5′-flanking region) appeared to correspond to the published X. laevis slug gene and is referred to hereafter as slug α. In addition to a few differences in the coding region, the second clone is slightly divergent in the 5′- and 3′-UTRs (Table I). This clone is referred to hereafter asslug β.Table IComparisons between Xenopus Slug genesXt1-aXt, X. tropicalis;Xl, X. laevis; aa, amino acids. slugXl slug αXl slug βXt/XlαXt/XlβXlα/Xlβ%%%Length and homology of RNA elementsCoding region801 bp801 bp801 bp959596Predicted protein sequence266 aa266 aa266 aa9997985′-UTR142 bp138 bp133 bp7080703′-UTR835 bp804 bp839 bp838587Intron 1707 bp1071 bp667 bp315532Intron 21031 bp985 bp1256 bp383336Localization and homology of promoter elementsRegion A−1 to −250−1 to −260−1 to −260898887Region B−2890 to −3200−2640 to −2950−1340 to −16509389911-a Xt, X. tropicalis;Xl, X. laevis; aa, amino acids. Open table in a new tab Before studying the regulatory capacities of the 5′-flanking regions of the two X. laevis Slug clones, we needed to determine the precise expression pattern of each gene. As previous in situhybridization studies (7Mayor R. Morgan R. Sargent M.G. Development. 1995; 121: 767-777PubMed Google Scholar, 23Linker C. Bronner-Fraser M. Mayor R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 224: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) used part of the coding region as a probe, the domains expressed may be those of Slug α, Slug β, or both Slug mRNAs. To discriminate between the two pseudoalleles, we first used an RT-PCR approach. Amplification was performed with primers derived from a divergent region of the 5′-UTR, which were therefore specific for a particular Slug gene. Semiquantitative PCR using embryos at various stages of development showed that both pseudoalleles were expressed at very similar levels and in exactly the same temporal pattern (Fig.3 A). Moreover, in situ hybridization with neurula embryos and short specific probes derived from the 5′-UTR showed that the two X. laevis Slug genes were expressed in the same location, at the border of the neural plate, as expected (Fig. 3 B). We assessed the efficiency of the X. laevis promoters obtained using constructs consisting of the GFP coding region under the control of the full-length slug α or slug β flanking region (α3000-GFP and β1700-GFP, respectively). Both promoters drove strong GFP expression in NCCs at the edge of the neural plate throughout the neurulation process and later both in premigratory and migrating cells (Fig.4). Expression was detected at stage 14 NF at the border of the neural plate. The highest level of expression was observed at stage 19 NF, with the strong expression in the cephalic NCCs and a lower level of expression in the rest of the neural crest territory. At stage 25 NF, GFP was strongly expressed in the cephalic premigratory NCCs. The migrating cells colonizing the branchial arches gave a positive, but weaker GFP signal. The cells from the mandibular pathway displayed the strongest expression among cells colonizing the branchial arches. This expression pattern closely resembled that of endogenous Slug according to in situ hybridization data (23Linker C. Bronner-Fraser M. Mayor R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 224: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This suggests that the isolated flanking regions of bothslug α and slug β contain the key regulatory elements of the promoter. The threeXenopus Slug genes presented similar expression patterns, but their 5′-flanking regions were different. More detailed analysis revealed two conserved regions (Fig. 2 A and Table I). Region A was ∼250 bp long and was located just upstream from the CAP site. Region B was ∼300 bp long, and its position was variable: around −3 kb in X. tropicalis slug, around −2.7 kb inX. laevis slug α, and around −1.5 kb inslug β. The sequences between these two regions were divergent. X. tropicalis presented a 315-bp fragment of GT repeats, located around −800 bp. These repeats were absent from theX. laevis Slug promoters, but slug α andslug β displayed 11 and 4 repeats, respectively, of a 79-nucleotide motif. Although this motif has been identified in regulatory as well as transcribed regions of the X. laevisgenome (24Ho L. Mercola M. Gudas L.J. Mech. Dev. 1994; 47: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 25Kloc M. Spohr G. Etkin L.D. Science. 1993; 262: 1712-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 26Tsujimura A. Yasojima K. Kuboki Y. Suzuki A. Ueno N. Shiokawa K. Hashimoto-Gotoh T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), it has never been shown to have a regulatory function. Additionally, comparison of the sequences of the genes from X. tropicalis and X. laevis revealed a striking difference at the transcription initiation site. Although the surrounding regions are almost identical in the three promoters, both X. laevisgenes have a 9-bp insertion just downstream from the identified CAP site of the X. tropicalis promoter (Fig. 2 B). This insertion creates a second putative CAP site, with a score even higher than that for the first site. This may account for the inefficiency of the X. tropicalis promoter in X. laevis. Alternatively, divergent regions, such as the repeats present in X. laevis but not in X. tropicalis, may be involved in Slug regulation. We investigated whether the extra CAP site is necessary for efficient transcription in X. laevis by producing a construct derived from β1700-GFP. Seven nucleotides were deleted at the 3′-end of the promoter, eliminating the second putative CAP site (construct β1700ΔCAP-GFP) (Fig.5 A). This construct did not drive detectable GFP expression when injected into X. laevisembryos (data not shown). GFP mRNA was detected in these embryos by RT-PCR, but at a level of about one-fifth that found in embryos injected with β1700-GFP (Fig. 5 A). Thus, the second CAP site present in the X. laevis genes is necessary for efficient transcription in this species. The β1700ΔCAP-GFP construct was very similar to the X. tropicalis constructs used in terms of the CAP site (Fig.5 B). Interestingly, the level of GFP mRNA detected with this β1700ΔCAP-GFP construct was similar to that obtained with the most efficient X. tropicalis constructs (compare Figs.1 A and 5 A, the same unit is used in both cases). This suggests that the inefficiency of the X. tropicalispromoter in X. laevis was mainly due to the absence of the second CAP site in this promoter. We also investigated the putative role of the first intron in Slug regulation. We injected a construct containing the β1700 promoter, the first exon, the first intron, and the start of the second exon in frame with the GFP cDNA (construct β1700int1-GFP) (Fig.5 A). Similar results were obtained with this construct and with β1700-GFP, suggesting that the first intron of theslug gene contains no major regulatory elements. We investigated the regulatory properties of the various regions of Slug promoters using several constructs containing different portions of the slug α promoter (Fig.6). The amount of GFP and its distribution in injected embryos were analyzed both by fluorescence monitoring throughout development and by semiquantitative RT-PCR of stage 19 NF embryos. Two different amounts of plasmid were injected (referred to as 1× and 8×) and gave different and complementary results. In both cases, no fluorescence was detected with the negative control, which consisted of the 70 bp just upstream from the transcription start site containing the TATA box. This α70TATA-GFP construct gave the basal level for RT-PCR experiments. The α200AΔ-GFP construct, with three-fourths of region A, drove strong expression both in NCCs and in presumptive epidermis. This reveals the presence in this region of a positive regulatory element, activated both in NCCs and in presumptive epidermis. With the α270A-GFP construct, which contained all of region A, no GFP was detected with 1× injections, and mRNA levels were similar to the basal levels obtained with α70TATA-GFP. This indicates the existence of a negative regulatory element in the 5′-fourth of region A. With 8× injections, this α270A-GFP construct gave a similar nonspecific expression pattern compared with α200AΔ-GFP, but with lower mRNA levels. The α1000-GFP and α2200-GFP constructs (with 1 and 2.2 kb of promoter, respectively, and containing region A, but lacking region B) had similar effects compared with α270A-GFP for both 1× and 8× injections. This suggests that the intermediate divergent regions of the promoters are not very important for transcription regulation. If the region B was present, as in the full-length α3000 promoter, the specific Slug pattern was observed in 1× injected embryos, as described above. This suggested the presence of another positive regulatory element in region B. No GFP expression was ever observed with constructs containing region B and the TATA box, but lacking the rest of region A (see, for example, α500B-GFP and α2300B-GFP), even for 8× injections. These results suggest that both conserved regions A and B were necessary for specific expression in NCCs. In addition, the intermediate region did not seem to possess regulatory elements. As the relative positions of regions A and B differ in the three promoters, we wondered whether the intermediate region might play an essential role as a spacer. We tested this hypothesis by injecting the α700BA-GFP construct, which contains a very short intermediate region. This construct gave a similar expression pattern compared with the full-length promoter, indicating that the two conserved regions alone are sufficient to drive specific expression in NCCs. In silicoanalysis of Xenopus Slug promoter sequences predicted a number of putative binding sites for transcription factors. These sites included a consensus binding site for Lef-1 in the middle of region B (centered on −2839 in the slug α promoter). The Lef/Tcf transcription factors form complexes with β-catenin, acting as downstream targets of the Wnt signaling pathway, which has been shown to be directly involved in NCC determination (10LaBonne C. Bronner-Fraser M. Development. 1998; 125: 2403-2414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated the possible role of this site in Slug regulation by performing electrophoretic mobility shift assays to"

Using substrate screening in various tissues, we uncovered two major substrates, p130 and p85, for MRCKα-kinase. p130 is identified as myosin binding subunit p130, whereas p85 is a novel related protein. p85 contains N-terminal ankyrin repeats, an α-helical C terminus with leucine repeats, and a centrally located conserved motif with the MRCKα-kinase phosphorylation site.

In particular, the myosin binding subunit MBS130 appears to play a unique role in the regulation of the activity of the associated PP1 catalytic subunit. The specific binding of MBS130 to RhoA may link this regulatory subunit to Rho-dependent events (9Amano M.K. Chihara K. Fukuta N. Nakamura Y. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Indeed chicken gizzard MBS130 is found to be effectively and specifically phosphorylated by ROK at threonine 695 and serine 854 (10Kawano Y. Fukata Y. Oshiro N. Amano M. Nakamura T. Ito M.

Other proteins that can interact with and phosphorylate MBS130 include the cGMP-dependent protein kinase 1α and an unidentified mitotic kinase, but in contrast, such phosphorylation resulted in activation of protein phosphatase activity (18Surks H.K. Mochizuki N. Kasai Y. Georgescu S.P. Tang K.M. Ito M. Lincoln T.M. Mendelsohn M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 19Totsukawa G. Yamakita Y. Yamashiro S. Hosoya H. Hartshorne D.J. Matsumura F. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 735-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). MBS130 therefore appears to serve as a scaffold for multiple protein interactions as well as phosphorylation regulation. Indeed, a recent report has indicated that a number of proteins involve in the Rho signaling pathways including Ezrin, Radixin and Moesin family proteins, adducin, and MBS130 can be found to colocalize at cell periphery upon stimulation. It is possible that MBS130 may provide a bridge for various Rho-dependent components to function in a coordinated manner (20Fukata Y. Kimura K. Oshiro N. Saya H. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 409-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Since the myotonic dystrophy kinase-related Cdc42-binding kinases (MRCKs) also consist of similar catalytic domains with differential cellular localization and cellular functions (7Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Tan I. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 21Chen X-Q. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19901-19905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), it is of interest to investigate if these kinases could share similar and different sets of substrates for their cellular activities. As a first step toward identification of new substrates for kinases such as MRCKs, we derived a filter assay to screen for potential candidates. This assay allows renatured proteins on the filter to be phosphorylated by specific recombinant kinases. Using this assay for MRCKα kinase, we identified two potential substrate proteins, one of which was MBS130; the other was a novel related protein. Full-length p85 cDNA was obtained by first performing a PCR reaction of the presumed initiation codon from the first exon of the human genomic DNA using two adaptor primers, 5′-CAGGATCCATGTCCGGAGAGGATGGC-3′ and 5′-GCAGGCCTGGTGCAGG-3′. This was then joined to aStuI/NotI fragment from EST clone AI1825921 that contains the rest of the 3′ end of p85. p85NT was derived from a BamHI/PstI DNA fragment of p85 (encoding residues 1–389), and p85CT was obtained by subcloning a PCR fragment from a 5′ primer 5′-CAGGATCCTGCCGCCTGCTGGCCG-3′ (encompassing residues 346–782) into pXJ-40 FLAG-tagged vector as previously described (4Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A shorter C-terminal construct encompassing the conserved α-helix leucine zipper (p85αLZ; residues 591–782) was derived from PCR product using 5′ primer 5′-CGGATCCCGAAGGCCCCGCGTC-3′. In-frame deletions by Nar1 restriction enzyme digest, which removed a central conserved region (p85ΔNar; deleted residues 521–610), and by BssHII (p85ΔAR1), which deleted an ankyrin repeat (residues 51–71), were likewise subcloned. Mutagenesis was carried out as previously described (4Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5313-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using primer pairs 5′-CTGCATGCAGCGGCACACTGG-3′ and 5′-CTGCATGCAGGGCAGAGGCGCC-3′ to generate p85ΔAR2 (deleted residues 232–264) and primer pairs 5′-GACGTCGACGGGCCGCACAGGGTGTGACTCTTAC3-′ and 5′-GACGTCGACTCTGGCGCATGAGACGG-3′ to generate p85S559A/T560A (p85AA). PP1δ was derived from EST clone AI156840, which contains the whole of the coding sequence. The nucleotide sequences encoding the 50 amino acids ofphosphorylation inhibitory motif (PIM; residues 526–575) of the wild-type p85 and mutant p85AA were obtained by PCR using primer pairs 5′-CAGGATCCCGGGACCGACGGAG-3′ and pXJ40 reverse primer. The 156-base pair BamHI/PstI-digested PCR fragments were subcloned into pXJ40-GST vector for mammalian cell transfection (22Zhao Z-S. Manser E. Chen X-Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and into pGEX-4T2 for the production of GST-PIM50 and GST-PIM50AA fusion proteins. The N terminus containing the kinase domain of MRCKα (residues 1–473) was obtained by subcloning a 1.4-kilobase BamHI/HindIII fragment from full-length MRCKα into pGEX4T2 to generate a vector producing MRCKα-CAT. GST-MLC2 was prepared as previously described (7Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Tan I. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10‥ fetal bovine serum, and HeLa cells were cultivated in modified Eagle's medium with 10‥ fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). Subconfluent HeLa cells plated on coverslips for 48 h were transfected with various HA- or FLAG-tagged DNA constructs (1 μg/ml) with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to recommended protocol. 16 h after transfection, cells were fixed with 4‥ paraformaldehyde and stained with the combination of various primary antibodies: anti-HA (12CA5; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma). Stained cells were analyzed with an MRC 600 confocal imager adapted to a ZEISS Axioplan microscope. For localization studies, transfected HeLa cells were serum-starved for 4–6 h before treatment with lysophosphatidic acid (300 ng/ml; Sigma) or phorbol myristic acetate (100 ng/ml; Sigma). COS-7 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10‥ fetal bovine serum were similarly transfected with various constructs. 24 h after transfection, cell extracts were obtained with lysis buffer ((25 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 0.15m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2,0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5‥ glycerol, 0.1‥ Triton X-100 and 1× inhibitor mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibodies for expression. Tissue extracts from rat brain and other tissues or cultured cells were resolved on either one- or two-dimensional gels, electro-transferred onto PVDF filters, and renatured in buffer containing phosphate-buffer saline with 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1‥ bovine serum albumin, and 0.1‥ Triton X-100 for 2 h. Filters were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1‥ Triton, incubated with a phosphorylation mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 75 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml GST-MRCKα-CAT fusion protein, and 10 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1‥ Triton and 6 mguanidinium chloride before autoradiography. Control experiments were also performed using GST-α-p21-activated kinase (22Zhao Z-S. Manser E. Chen X-Q. Chong C. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2153-2163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and protein kinase A (Sigma). Kinase assays were carried out in kinase buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 75 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 as previously described (5Matsui T. Amano M. Yamanoto T. Chihara K. Nakafuku M. Ito M. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2208-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). For labeling of GST-MLC2, purified fusion protein (10 μg) on glutathione beads was subjected to phosphorylation using 20 μg/ml GST-MRCK-α-CAT and 1 μm[γ-33P]ATP for 1 h at 30 °C. After an extensive wash with GST purification buffer, the phosphorylated protein was eluted with 5 mm reduced glutathione. Phosphatase assays were carried out at 30 °C using 33P-GST-MLC2 as substrate. To show phophorylation-mediated PP1 inhibition, the immunoprecipitated FLAG-p85·HA-PP1δ complex was first incubated in 20 μl of kinase buffer with 0.15 mm ATPγS in the presence or absence of 0.5 μg of GST-MRCKα-CAT for 30 min at 30 °C. Phosphatase assays were initiated by the addition of 5 μm33P-GST-MLC2 in 30 mmTris-HCl, PH 7.5, 0.1 m KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, and 0. 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of SDS sample buffer at each time point indicated and boiling for 5 min before gel loading. To show PP1 inhibition by phosphorylated GST-PIM50, 10 μg of the fusion protein was first incubated in kinase buffer (as above using ATPγS) with and without GST-MRCKα-CAT for 30 min at 30 °C. These phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated GST-PIM50 proteins were then separately mixed with the immunoprecipitated FLAG-p85·HA-PP1δ complex and preincubated for 1 min before the start of phosphatase assays. Phosphatase activities were quantified using the Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager System. COS-7 cells co-expressing various FLAG-p85 and HA-PP1δ constructs were lysed in buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 0.15 mNaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 5‥ glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1‥ Triton, 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture and incubated with anti-FLAG-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. After an extensive wash, the immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-FLAG or anti-HA antibodies as mentioned. To detect any interaction of these complex with the phosphorylated GST-PIM50, an in vitro assay containing either the unphosphorylated or phophorylated GST-PIM50 was added to COS-7 cell lysates co-expressing FLAG-p85AA and HA-PP1δ and followed by immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG-conjugated agarose beads. Immunoblot analyses were carried out as before. Northern blots containing mRNA from various human tissues were obtained fromCLONTECH and were hybridized with a full-length32P-labeled p85 probe as previously described (5Matsui T. Amano M. Yamanoto T. Chihara K. Nakafuku M. Ito M. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2208-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). One- and two-dimensional gel analyses were carried out according to standard protocol, and separated proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and probed with various antibodies, including an antibody to a phosphorylated threonine 695 of chicken gizzard M130 (which is identical to the flanking sequence around threonine 560 of p85). Analysis of tryptic peptides and phosphopeptides were performed with a QSTAR Mass-spectrometer (PerkinElmer). To identify and characterize potential substrates for ROKα and MRCKα, we made GST fusion proteins of the catalytic domains of both ROKα (1) and MRCKα (1). The yield and catalytic activities of MRCKα-CAT were consistently higher than ROKα-CAT, and subsequent experiments were thus carried out with GST-MRCKα-CAT. Here we observed that renatured proteins separated on SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels and transferred onto PVDF membrane filters were readily phosphorylated by MRCKα-CAT. Two proteins of 130 and 85 kDa were prominently and specifically phosphorylated by MRCKα-CAT (Fig. 1) but not by α-p21-activated kinase or protein kinase A (data not shown). These two proteins are not abundant in tissues such as brain and testis but could easily be enriched by passing through an affinity dye Reactive Brown 10-Sepharose column (Sigma), and this constitutes a simple one-step enrichment of these proteins for further purification (Fig. 1 A). Further separation of these two proteins was achieved with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (Fig.1 B), and the Coomassie Blue-stained spots corresponding to the phosphorylated proteins were excised for peptide sequencing. Both peptide sequencing and subsequent immunoblotting analyses showed that the p130 corresponds to the previously reported MBS130 (data not shown). Peptide sequence analysis also indicated that the p85 is a novel protein (Fig.2 A). A 2.8-kilobase human EST clone AI825921 contains most of the coding sequence except for the extreme N terminus. The complete match of this cDNA with two overlapping genomic clones, S51329 and AC005782, from human chromosome 19 (Fig. 2 C) suggested that the N terminus is confined within the first exon. A full-length cDNA for p85 was thus constructed from the PCR product of the first exon of human p85 genomic DNA and subsequently joined to the truncated cDNA. The amino acid sequence derived from this cDNA indicated that p85 is structurally related to MBS130 (Fig. 2 B). The N terminus of p85 consists of a closely related structure with 6 ankyrin repeats and 48‥ identity to MBS130, which has been reported to have 7–8 repeats (23Chen Y.H. Chen M.X. Alessi D.R.

Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), was also present immediately before the ankyrin repeats. The C terminus contains a conserved α-helical structure with leucine zippers at the C-terminal end (αLZ). This structure can form homodimers or heterodimers (e.g. with M20, which also contains this structural motif (26Johnson D. Cohen P. Chen M.X. Chen Y.H. Cohen P.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar)). Of most striking similarity (87‥ identity) is a central motif, which contains the sole phosphorylation site for MRCKα-CAT (refer to Fig. 3).Figure 3Mapping of phosphorylation sites of p85 by MRCK α-CAT.

FLAG-tagged immunoprecipitated p85 before and after phosphorylation in vitro by GST-MRCKα-CAT was also shown as controls for comparison (right panel). WB, Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The genomic organization of p85 showed that the mRNA is derived from 22 exons (Fig. 2 C). Intriguingly, a number of integration hotspots (AAVS1) of adenovirus-associated virus (AAV) was found in the first exon/intron regions of p85 genomic sequence (Fig.2 D; Refs. 27Kotin R.M. Linden R.M. Berns K.I. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 5071-5078Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar and 28Recchia A. Parks R.J. Lamartina S. Toniatti C. Pieroni L. Palombo F. Ciliberto G. Graham F.L. Cortese R. La Monica N. Colloca S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2615-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The consequence of these integrations is not known but is expected to disrupt the expression of this gene. Rearrangements and disruption of a nearby troponin gene were also observed upon adenovirus-associated virus integration (29Dutheil N. Shi F. Dupressoir T. Linden R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4862-4866Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis indicated that the 3-kilobase p85 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed and is especially high in the heart (Fig.2 E). P85 protein expressed in serum-starved HeLa cells mainly showed cytoplasmic punctate distribution (Fig. 2 F, a) but was readily redistributed to cell peripheral upon treatment with lysophosphatidic acid and phorbol myristic acetate (Fig. 2 F, b and c). To confirm the nature of phosphorylation of p85, we expressed the FLAG-tagged wild-type and deletion mutants of p85 in COS-7 cells (Fig. 3 A). The immunoprecipitated proteins were phosphorylated with MRCKα-CAT to map the phosphorylation site(s). It is clear that the major site(s) is within the central conserved region, as mutants deleted of this region were not phosphorylated (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2 and4). To confirm this, we expressed GST fusion protein containing the wild-type conserved PIM motif (PIM50; also refer to Fig.4) and a mutant S559A/T560A (PIM50AA) and showed that the mutant was not phosphorylated (Fig. 3 B, lane 8), unlike the wild-type control (lane 7). This in vitro phosphorylation site of p85 on threonine 560 by MRCKα-CAT was further confirmed by mass spectrometry on the tryptic phosphopeptides derived from p85 phosphorylation. Further evidence was obtained by probing p85 protein expressed from COS-7 cells that were co-transfected with either MRCKα-CAT or ROKα-CAT with an antibody that specifically recognizes phosphorylated threonine 560 of p85. Clearly, threonine 560 of p85 can be phosphorylated by both MRCKα-CAT and ROKα-CAT in vivo(Fig. 3 C). To see if p85 can associate with PP1, we co-transfected FLAG-tagged p85 and HA-tagged PP1α, -γ, and -δ isoforms. Only PP1δ isoform was immunoprecipitated with p85, indicating a specific interaction between p85 and PP1δ. This was also evident from the co- immunoprecipitation of the endogenous PP1δ with the overexpressed p85 (data not shown). Constructs with an intact N terminus, including the ankyrin repeats, could effectively interact with PP1δ (Fig.4 A, lanes 1–4), whereas a deletion mutant of a single ankyrin repeat (lane 5) can dramatically reduce such interaction. Deletion mutants devoid of N terminus are totally ineffective (Fig. 4 A, lanes 6 and7). The N terminus of p85 could also interact with MLC2 (Fig.4 B), and the C terminus is totally ineffective. Hence PP1δ can form a tight complex with p85 and substrate MLC2 through its N terminus. Next, to examine if the phosphorylation of threonine 560 by MRCKα-CAT can regulate PP1 activity, we measured the time course of dephosphorylation toward 33P-MLC2. As shown in Fig.4 C, nonphosphorylated wild-type p85 (p85WT) or the phosphorylation-defective p85 mutant (p85AA) were equally active in MLC2 dephosphorylation. Wild-type p85 but not the mutant p85AA, when phosphorylated in vitro with MRCKα-CAT, showed significant reduction in the rate of MLC2 dephosphorylation. These results confirm a similar observation with MBS130 where phosphorylation of a conserved threonine 695 within a highly conserved motif was essential for the inhibition of phosphatase catalytic activity (11Feng J. Ito M. Ichikawa K. Isaka N. Nishikawa M. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37385-37390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Based on the biochemical and functional similarities between p85 and MBS130, we therefore designate p85 as MBS85. Because PP1 activities are essential for regulating the phosphorylation states of myosin, it is likely that the biochemical interaction of MBS85 with PP1δ may be correlated with morphological effects in cultured cells. Furthermore adherent cells mainly exhibit active Rho phenotype in serum medium, and the interference of endogenous PP1δ would be expected to affect this actin structure. As shown in Fig.5 A, expression of wild-type p85 alone did not give any obvious morphological consequence. However, truncation of the C terminus led to various degrees of disassembly of actin stress fibers, with the most striking effects when both the PIM and αLZ motifs were totally removed (p85NT; Fig. 5,A and B). Deletion of the PIM motif (p85ΔNar1) or mutation of the phosphorylation site (p85AA) was significantly effective in inducing similar morphological effects, although this appears to depend on the levels of expression (Fig. 5 A, bottom panel). Both the PIM and αLZ motifs at the C terminus appear to exert opposing effects on the N-terminal function. Truncation of the N terminus resulted in general increases in actin polymerization (p85CT in Fig. 5 A) that was resistant to C3 treatment (data not shown). As αLZ alone was also effective, although to a lesser extent (data not shown), it is likely that PIM and αLZ domains have independent activities toward actin assembly. Similar trends were also observed when the various constructs were co-expressed with PP1δ (Fig. 5 B). In this case, the morphological effects were more pronounced in the presence of exogenous PP1δ. As expected, both ankyrin repeat mutants p85ΔAR1and p85ΔAR2 that were defective in binding to PP1δ were totally ineffective in inducing morphological changes (Fig.5 B and data not shown). Hence the phenotypic effects of the various MBS85 variants on actin cytoskeleton correlate well with the biochemical data described earlier. It is known that phosphorylation of threonine 695 of MBS (which is equivalent to the threonine 560 of p85) is critical for the inhibitory effects on PP1 catalytic function (11Feng J. Ito M. Ichikawa K. Isaka N. Nishikawa M. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37385-37390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). It is likely that a similar mechanism may operate for MBS85. To test this possibility, we derived an assay to examine the effect of phosphorylation on the interaction of the highly conserved GST-PIM with p85/PP1δ complex. The phosphorylation-deficient mutant p85AA was used to eliminate possible competition for binding. As shown in Fig. 6 A, phosphorylated GST-PIM, but not the nonphosphorylated form, was detected in the p85/PP1δ immuno-complex. Similarly only glutathione beads with the phosphorylated GST-PIM, but not the nonphosphorylated or phosphorylation-deficient mutant GST-PIM50AA, were able to pull down the expressed PP1δ or p85/PP1δ complex (Fig.6 B), clearly indicating that phosphorylation of threonine 560 of MBS85 is essential for its interaction with PP1δ. To examine if such interaction is functional, we measured the catalytic activities of the immuno-complex in the presence of in vitrophosphorylated or nonphosphorylated GST-PIM50. Phosphorylated GST-PIM50, but not the nonphosphorylated form, was likewise effective in inhibiting the catalytic activity of p85·PP1δ complex (Fig.6 C). This provides further evidence that the interaction is functional. Next we tested the effects of co-expression of this PIM50 motif on the p85NT-induced morphological changes. As shown in Fig.7, A and B, PIM50 expression is sufficient in reversing the effect of p85NT-induced actin stress fiber losses. The phosphorylation-deficient mutant PIM50AA was totally inefficient (Fig. 7 B). These inhibitory effects became less pronounced when p85NT was co-expressed with PP1δ, suggesting that PIM50 may well be competing with the catalytic subunit in regulating actin dynamics. We therefore conclude that from both biochemical and morphological data that the central conserved motif of MBS85 can be regulated by phosphorylation, resulting in conformational changes that affect the associated PP1δ catalytic property and subsequently effects on actin morphology, probably through the eventual effects on myosin phosphorylation. Two candidate proteins from rat brain cytosolic extract were identified in this study on the basis of their in vitrophosphorylation by MRCKα-CAT. The p130 protein was confirmed to be MBS130 by peptide sequencing and immunoreactive toward specific antibodies. The smaller protein p85 is a novel protein that is structurally related to MBS130. Overall p85 shares low similarity to MBS130 (<40‥). The N terminus of p85 contains six ankyrin repeats that are known to be involved in protein-protein interactions. This motif shares a 48‥ identity to MBS130, which has 7–8 repeats (23Chen Y.H. Chen M.X. Alessi D.R. Campbell D.G. Shanahan C. Cohen P. Cohen P.T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar,24Shimizu H. Ito M. Miyahara M. Ichikawa K. Okubo S. Konishi T. Naka M. Tanaka T. Hirano K. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30407-30411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preceding these repeats is a short stretch (RTVRF) that resembles PP1 binding consensus sequence (25Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The C terminus of p85 is also conserved and consists of an α-helical structure with four leucine heptad repeats at the C-terminal end. This motif is known to be involved in dimerization and interaction with other proteins. M20, a small subunit protein of PP1, is found to be an integral part of the heterotrimeric complex (28Recchia A. Parks R.J. Lamartina S. Toniatti C. Pieroni L. Palombo F. Ciliberto G. Graham F.L. Cortese R. La Monica N. Colloca S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2615-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), and it contains a similar helical structure. Indeed, it has been reported that this M20 may be a spliced product from skeletal muscle isoform of MBS130 (30Hartshorne D.J. Hirano K. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1999; 90: 79-84Crossref Google Scholar). More recently, it has also been reported that other proteins can interact with the C terminus of MBS130. This includes RhoA and cGMP-dependent protein kinase 1α (9Amano M.K. Chihara K. Fukuta N. Nakamura Y. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar, 18Surks H.K. Mochizuki N. Kasai Y. Georgescu S.P. Tang K.M. Ito M. Lincoln T.M. Mendelsohn M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). The former links the PP1 complex to Rho-dependent regulatory events, and the kinase phosphorylates and activates PP1 activity. The presence of a similar motif in p85 at the C terminus suggests that it may serve similar functional roles. Indeed p85 can readily translocate to peripheral membrane upon treatment with lysophosphatidic acid and phorbol ester, factors that are known to have prominent effects on Rho GTPases and actin cytoskeleton (2Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar). A central conserved motif that contains the sole phosphorylation site for MRCKα and ROKα exhibits a more striking similarity. Threonine 560 of p85 is equivalent to threonine 695 of MBS130 and is located within a ∼50-amino acid conservative phosphorylation inhibitory motif (PIM50). Phosphorylation of the threonine 695 by ROKα has been shown to inhibit associated PP1 activity (11Feng J. Ito M. Ichikawa K. Isaka N. Nishikawa M. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37385-37390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 30Hartshorne D.J. Hirano K. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1999; 90: 79-84Crossref Google Scholar). A second phosphorylation site (serine 854) by ROKα has also been described in MBS130, but this is absent in p85 (Fig. 2 A and Ref. 10Kawano Y. Fukata Y. Oshiro N. Amano M. Nakamura T. Ito M. Matsumura F. Inagaki M. Kaibuchi K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1023-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Here we have also demonstrated that p85 is functionally similar to MBS130. First it is specifically associated with PP1δ, and this depends on the N terminus including the whole of the ankyrin repeats. N-terminal as well as ankyrin-repeat deletion mutants are ineffective in binding PP1δ. In agreement with a previous report for MBS130 (32Ichikawa K. Hirano K. Ito M. Tanaka J. Nakano T. Hartshorne D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6313-6320Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), we also detected binding of the substrate MLC2 within the N-terminal region. In this respect, the N terminus of p85 alone can therefore act as scaffold for PP1 and myosin and confers specific phosphatase activity on MLC2 substrate (30Hartshorne D.J. Hirano K. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1999; 90: 79-84Crossref Google Scholar). p85 (designated here as MBS85) is therefore a genuine myosin binding subunit of PP1δ, similar to MBS130. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of threonine 560 of the central motif of MBS85 resulted in inhibition of PP1δ activity, also suggesting a conservation of phosphorylation mechanism in regulating the catalytic event. Similar conclusions can be derived from the morphological assays that clearly reflect the biochemical interactions. HeLa cells expressing the N terminus of MBS85 alone exhibits the greatest loss in actin stress fibers, an indicator for activation of PP1 in vivo. Interestingly, the two conserved motifs (PIM and αLZ) appear to act independently to counteract this N-terminal function as deletion of either motif attenuates the stress fiber losses. Overexpression of C-terminal αLZ motif alone can induce actin stress fibers that are resistant to C3 treatment, suggesting that this activates an event downstream of Rho. The exact mechanism of how this αLZ motif works is currently not clear. One possibility is that this motif may directly compete with binding proteins such as cGMP-dependent kinase 1α, which is known to activate PP1 (18Surks H.K. Mochizuki N. Kasai Y. Georgescu S.P. Tang K.M. Ito M. Lincoln T.M. Mendelsohn M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the αLZ motif is known to be able to form homodimers or heterodimers with the small subunit M20, although the biological functions of these complexes are currently not known (data not shown; Refs. 26Johnson D. Cohen P. Chen M.X. Chen Y.H. Cohen P.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 931-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar and 30Hartshorne D.J. Hirano K. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1999; 90: 79-84Crossref Google Scholar). We conclude from both biochemical and morphological analyses that different domains of the MBS85 have opposing activities in regulating actin polymerization and that the phosphorylation of threonine 560 in a central motif appears to fine tune these events. It is therefore important to demonstrate a direct interaction of the conserved central motif (PIM50) with PP1δ. Such an interaction occurred only when the threonine 560 was phosphorylated. Moreover, not only did such a motif play a role in intramolecular interaction, it is also equally effective both in vitro and in vivoin promoting intermolecular interactions when introduced separately. This leads to the conclusion that phosphorylation of MBS85 by myotonic dystrophy kinase-related kinases such as MRCKα and ROKα induces a conformational change at the central conserved motif that results in higher affinity toward PP1δ. Such an interaction may change the orientation or catalytic properties of PP1δ toward the associated myosin (through MLC2; Fig. 6 C), resulting in myosin phosphorylation and subsequent cytoskeletal changes. This is depicted as a working model in Fig. 8. It remains unclear as to which GTPase(s) and downstream kinase(s) are regulating this event, as endogenous levels of p85 in cultured cells are much lower than p130MBS, and the specific antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated peptide was unable to detect the endogenous phosphoprotein. Further experiments are therefore required to clarify this issue. In summary, we have isolated a novel myosin binding subunit that is ubiquitously expressed. Compared with MBS130, the smaller size and simpler arrangement of the regulatory domains of this novel MBS85 allow an easier analysis of structure and function relationships. The identification of an increasing number of these myosin binding subunits, which share a similar regulatory mechanism, should help to understand how each of these are regulated by various diverse signaling pathways in the control of the actin cytoskeleton. We thank Dr. M. Ito for the antibody to phosphorylated threonine 695 of MBS130 and Dr. Robert Qi for peptide sequence analysis."
https://openalex.org/W1972547501,"During apoptotic cell death, cells usually release apoptogenic proteins such as cytochromec from the mitochondrial intermembrane space. If Bcl-2 family proteins induce such release by increasing outer mitochondrial membrane permeability, then the pro-apoptotic, but not anti-apoptotic activity of these proteins should correlate with their permeabilization of membranes to cytochrome c. Here, we tested this hypothesis using pro-survival full-length Bcl-xL and pro-death Bcl-xL cleavage products (ΔN61Bcl-xL and ΔN76Bcl-xL). Unlike Bcl-xL, ΔN61Bcl-xL and ΔN76Bcl-xL caused the release of cytochrome cfrom mitochondria in vivo and in vitro. Recombinant ΔN61Bcl-xL and ΔN76Bcl-xL, as well as Bcl-xL, cleaved in situ by caspase 3-possessed intrinsic pore-forming activity as demonstrated by their ability to efficiently permeabilize pure lipid vesicles. Furthermore, only ΔN61Bcl-xL and ΔN76Bcl-xL, but not Bcl-xL, formed pores large enough to release cytochromec and to destabilize planar lipid bilayer membranes through reduction of pore line tension. Because Bcl-xL and its C-terminal cleavage products bound similarly to lipid membranes and formed oligomers of the same size, neither lipid affinity nor protein-protein interactions appear to be solely responsible for the increased membrane-perturbing activity elicited by Bcl-xLcleavage. Taken together, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that Bax-like proteins oligomerize to form lipid-containing pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane, thereby releasing intermembrane apoptogenic factors into the cytosol. During apoptotic cell death, cells usually release apoptogenic proteins such as cytochromec from the mitochondrial intermembrane space. If Bcl-2 family proteins induce such release by increasing outer mitochondrial membrane permeability, then the pro-apoptotic, but not anti-apoptotic activity of these proteins should correlate with their permeabilization of membranes to cytochrome c. Here, we tested this hypothesis using pro-survival full-length Bcl-xL and pro-death Bcl-xL cleavage products (ΔN61Bcl-xL and ΔN76Bcl-xL). Unlike Bcl-xL, ΔN61Bcl-xL and ΔN76Bcl-xL caused the release of cytochrome cfrom mitochondria in vivo and in vitro. Recombinant ΔN61Bcl-xL and ΔN76Bcl-xL, as well as Bcl-xL, cleaved in situ by caspase 3-possessed intrinsic pore-forming activity as demonstrated by their ability to efficiently permeabilize pure lipid vesicles. Furthermore, only ΔN61Bcl-xL and ΔN76Bcl-xL, but not Bcl-xL, formed pores large enough to release cytochromec and to destabilize planar lipid bilayer membranes through reduction of pore line tension. Because Bcl-xL and its C-terminal cleavage products bound similarly to lipid membranes and formed oligomers of the same size, neither lipid affinity nor protein-protein interactions appear to be solely responsible for the increased membrane-perturbing activity elicited by Bcl-xLcleavage. Taken together, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that Bax-like proteins oligomerize to form lipid-containing pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane, thereby releasing intermembrane apoptogenic factors into the cytosol.

Some members of this family, including Bax, Bak, Bok/Mtd, Bad, Bik/Nbk, Bid, Blk, Bim/Bod, and Hrk promote apoptosis, whereas others, including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Bfl-1/A1, Mcl-1, and Boo/Diva inhibit apoptosis (1Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar). All these proteins share one to four conserved Bcl-2 homology domains (BH)1designated BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4 (1Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J.

In addition, Bcl-2 family members can possess a C-terminal hydrophobic amino acid sequence that helps localize them to intracellular membranes, primarily the outer mitochondrial membrane (1Gross A.

Bcl-xL can be cleaved by caspase 3 after aspartate 61 and 76 and by calpain after alanine 60, converting Bcl-xL from an anti-apoptotic factor to a pro-apoptotic factor (5Clem R.J. Cheng E.H.-Y.

Current models propose that Bcl-2 family proteins exert this function either by forming pores in mitochondrial membranes themselves, or by modulating endogenous mitochondrial channels through protein-protein interactions (1Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar,24Vander Heiden M.G. Thompson C.B. Nat.

The pore-forming function was first proposed based on the structural similarity of Bcl-xL and the pore-forming domain of bacterial toxins such as colicins and the diphtheria toxin (27Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlam J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.-L. Ng S.-N. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar).

Consistent with the structural similarity to bacterial toxins, Bcl-2 family proteins can permeabilize artificial lipid bilayer membranes, with pro-apoptotic members generally showing higher capacity for pore formation than anti-apoptotic members (32Minn A.J.

Here, we report that pro-apoptotic C-terminal cleavage fragments of Bcl-xL, but not their full-length anti-apoptotic counterpart, permeabilize both mitochondria and pure lipid bilayer membranes to cytochrome c.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAll lipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). KCl, HEPES, EDTA, Triton X-100, Nonidet P-40, horse heart cytochrome c, and dextrans of different molecular weights with or without fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeling were supplied by Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). 8-Aminonaphtalene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (ANTS) andp-xylene-bis-piridinium bromide (DPX) were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Sephadex G-10, Sephacryl S-300, and Superdex 200 were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Piscataway, NJ). Caspase 3 (catalog no. 201-038-C005, without CHAPS detergent) and zVAD-fmk were obtained from Alexis (San Diego, CA). The polyclonal anti-Bcl-xL H62 antibody and the monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and the monoclonal anti-cytochrome c65791A and 7H8.2C-12 antibodies were from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). The monoclonal anti-Bcl-xL 2A1 antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Larry Boise (University of Miami). LipofectAMINE was obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).Protein Expression and PurificationPlasmids encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Bcl-xL fusion proteins were constructed by subcloning human Bcl-xLcDNA into pGEX2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A stop codon was inserted after Bcl-xL amino acid 212 to generate GST-ΔC20Bcl-xL. The coding sequence for Bcl-xL amino acids 62–233 and 77–233 plus an initiation codon were amplified by polymerase chain reaction to construct GST-ΔN61Bcl-xL and GST-ΔN76Bcl-xL, respectively. The presence of the deletions was confirmed by DNA sequencing. All constructs were produced as GST fusion proteins from pGEX vectors using Escherichia coli DH1α as the host strain. A 50-ml overnight culture was used to inoculate 1 liter of Luria-Bertani medium, which was further incubated at 37 °C until anA 600 value of 0.4 was achieved. The cells were induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and incubated at 30 °C for an additional 6 h before harvesting by centrifugation. Then, cells were resuspended in a 10-ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution with 1% Triton X-100 (w/v) and protease inhibitors, and disrupted by sonication. The resulting lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to pellet cellular debris. Glutathione-agarose beads were added to the supernatant and incubated at 4 °C with gentle rotation for 3 h. The beads were washed twice with 50 ml of ice-cold PBS without Triton X-100, packed in a 1-ml column, and washed again with 10 ml of PBS. After incubation with thrombin for 3 h at room temperature, cleaved proteins were eluted with 5 ml of PBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. To 1-ml elution fractions 200 µl of prewashed detergent-binding beads (Calbiosorb, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) were added, followed by incubation for 30 min at 4 °C, and removal of the beads by centrifugation. After repeating this process five times, the supernatants were dialyzed against PBS buffer (10-kDa cut-off dialysis membrane), and finally, protein samples were concentrated using a Centricon BIOMAX-10 filter. Purified proteins were characterized by SDS-PAGE in 4–20% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) followed by Colloidal Blue staining (Pierce, Rockford, IL).Release of Cytochrome c from MitochondriaFor the immunofluorescence studies, 2–3 × 104 BHK cells were seeded on a slide and transiently transfected with 1 µg of the appropriate plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE. 10 h post-transfection, cells were immunostained with sc-807 anti-FLAG and 65791A anti-cytochrome c antibodies, followed by rhodamine-conjugated and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated secondary antibodies, respectively (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Cells were analyzed with a Noran OZ CLSM confocal microscope system with interversion software (Noran Inc., Madison, WI). Cell-fractionation studies were performed as described previously (41Kirsch D.G. Doseff A. Chau N.B. Lim D.-S. de Souza Pinto N.C. Hansford R. Kastan M.B. Lazebnik Y.A. Hardwick J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21155-21161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were isolated from livers of male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats as described by Rickwood et al. (42Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Darley-Usmar V.M. Darley-Usmar V. Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Mitochondria: A Practical Approach. IRL Press Ltd., Oxford, England1987: 1-16Google Scholar), followed by two washes in 210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 0.5 mmEDTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). Isolated mitochondria (50 µg of protein) were incubated with recombinant Bcl-xLprotein (1 µm) in 50 µl of 125 mm KCl, 0.02 mm EDTA, 5 mm sodium succinate, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 5 mmNa2HPO4, 5 µm rotenone, for 30 min at 30 °C. Reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min, mitochondrial membrane pellets corresponding to 25 µg of protein and the corresponding volume of supernatants were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4–20% Tris-glycine gels, and their respective cytochrome c contents were estimated by immunoblotting (7H8.2C-12) using the ECL method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Vesicle PreparationLarge unilamellar vesicles (LUV) were formed by the freeze-thawing/extrusion method as described in Mayeret al. (43Mayer L.D. Hope M.J. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, lipid composition was 60% dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), 40% dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG). Organic solvents were evaporated from lipid mixtures under an argon stream. The resulting films were kept under vacuum for at least 2 h to remove traces of solvent. Dry lipid films were resuspended in (i) 12.5 mm8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (ANTS), 45 mm p-xylenebis(piridinium bromide) (DPX), 20 mmKCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, or (ii) buffer A (100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0) supplemented with 75 mg/ml FITC-dextrans of 4 kDa (FD-4), 10 kDa (FD-10), 40 kDa (FD-40), or 70 kDa (FD-70). Then, lipid samples were subjected to 10 freeze-thaw cycles followed by extrusion through two polycarbonate membranes with 0.1-µm pores (Nucleopore, San Diego, CA). Unencapsulated ANTS/DPX was separated from LUV using prepacked Sephadex G-10 columns. Untrapped FD-4, FD-10, FD-40, FD-70, and cytochrome c (see below) were removed on a Sephacryl S-400 (20/30) column at a 1 ml/min flow rate. In both cases, buffer A was used as the elution buffer. The osmolality of all solutions used was measured using a vapor pressure osmometer (Wescor 5500, Logan, UT). LUV preparations showed unimodal size distributions as determined by dynamic light scattering measurements (Coulter Model N4 Plus). Mean diameters (± S.D.) of vesicle preparations were as follows: ANTS/DPX LUV, 123.9 ± 36.9 nm; FD-4 LUV, 116.9 ± 27.1 nm; FD-10 LUV, 118.9 ± 33.2 nm; FD-40 LUV, 124.7 ± 34.9 nm; FD-70 LUV, 120.2 ± 28.3 nm. Lipid concentration was routinely measured by the ammonium ferrothiocyanate method (44Stewart J.C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 104: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar).Liposome Binding AssaysProteins (100 nm) with or without LUV (300 µm lipid) were incubated in buffer A at 37 °C for 30 min. Then, 170 µl of 73% sucrose (w/v) in buffer A was added to 80 µl of the reaction mixture, and the samples were carefully overlaid with 150 µl of 40% sucrose in buffer A, and 300 µl of 25% sucrose in buffer A. After overnight centrifugation at 215,000 × g, seven 100-µl fractions were drawn from the air-fluid interface at the top of the tube. Proteins were precipitated by the chloroform/methanol method and analyzed by immunoblotting using H62 or 2A1 anti-Bcl-xL antibodies. In samples of LUV doped with 0.25 mol% of lissamine rhodamine B-labeled dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (Rh-DOPE), the three uppermost fractions of the gradient contained 95% of the fluorescence whereas the three lowermost fractions of the gradient did not show significant fluorescence. Therefore, the first three and the last three fractions collected from the air-fluid interface of the gradient corresponded to the lipid-containing and lipid-free fractions of the gradient, respectively.Fluorimetric MeasurementsLeakage of fluorescent molecules from LUV was continuously monitored in an SLM-2 Aminco-Bowman luminescence spectrometer (Spectronic Instruments), in a thermostatted 1-cm path length cuvette with constant stirring, at 37 °C. For ANTS, λex = 355 nm, λem = 520 nm (slits = 4 nm); for FITC-dextrans, λex = 490, λem = 520 nm (slits = 2 nm). Release of fluorescent markers was quantified on a percentage basis according to the equation,%Release=(Ff−F0/F100−F0)×100Equation 1 where F f is the measured fluorescence after protein addition, F 0 is the initial fluorescence of the intact LUV suspension, andF 100 is the fluorescence value after complete disruption of vesicle integrity by addition of Triton X-100 (final concentration, 0.2% w/v). Extents of marker release were obtained after fluorescence intensity reached a plateau. Vesicles were stored at 4 °C and used within 1–2 days. No spontaneous leakage of entrapped material was observed for vesicles stored at 4 °C for at least 1 week.Release of Cytochrome c from LUVTo study cytochromec release from LUV, two different methods were used. (i) LUV were prepared in buffer A supplemented with 0.1 mmcytochrome c as described above. Then, cytochromec-containing LUV were incubated with Bcl-xLproteins, 100-µl aliquots of treated samples were centrifuged in a 100-kDa cutoff microconcentrator (Millipore Co., Bedford, MA), and finally, cytochrome c contents of the retentate and of the filtrate were analyzed by immunoblotting using 7H8.2C-12 antibody. (ii) LUV were prepared in buffer A supplemented with 0.1 mmcytochrome c and 0.015 mm FD-70 as described above, except that two polycarbonate filters with 0.2-µm pores were used for extrusion. The liposomes were incubated with Bcl-xL proteins, 1-ml aliquots of treated samples were loaded onto the Sephacryl S-400 HR column, and the cytochromec and FD-70 contents of eluted fractions (1 ml) were determined by absorbance and by fluorescence measurements, respectively.Size Exclusion ChromatographyExperiments were performed in a Superdex-200 (15/45) column equilibrated with 100 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 0.2 mm EDTA (pH = 7.0), with or without 2% (w/v) CHAPS (J.T. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ) at a 1 ml/min flow rate. The column was calibrated using protein gel-filtration standards (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), having the following elution peak volumes: bovine thyroglobulin, 670,000 Da, 31.8 ml; bovine γ-globulin, 158,000 Da, 43.2 ml; avian ovalbumin, 44,000 Da, 53.7 ml; equine myoglobin, 17,000 Da, 61.8 ml; and vitamin B-12, 1350 Da, 75.1 ml. The void volume of the column was 29.4 ml, as determined by blue dextran 2000 elution. Samples of 300 µl were loaded onto the column followed by collection of 2-ml elution fractions. Aliquots of individual fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE in 16% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen), and finally, Bcl-xL proteins were visualized by immunoblotting using 2A1 antibody.Planar Bilayer Membrane StudiesSingle-channel measurements were performed in planar lipid bilayer membranes formed by the Mueller-Rudin technique across a 250-µm diameter hole, as described previously (45Melikov K.C. Frolov V.A. Shcherbakov A. Samsonov A.V. Chizmadzhev Y.A. Chernomordik L.V. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 1829-1836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Lipid composition was diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine/diphytanoylphosphatidylserine (1/1, v/v) or DOPC/DOPE/DOPS (1/1/1, v/v). The solution bathing the membrane contained 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0). Membrane thinning was monitored visually and by capacitance measurements. After planar membrane formation, a glass micropipette filled with a solution containing the protein was brought into close contact until a gigaseal (resistance = 20–100 gigaohms) was formed between the glass in the micropipette tip and the lipid bilayer within it. Then, a constant potential difference was applied to the patched membrane area, and the resulting current was filtered (5-KHz corner frequency, H900 active filter, Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA) and stored (100-µs sampling rate). Membrane lifetime experiments were done in a Lucite chamber with a hole of ∼550 µm (Warner Inst., Hamden, CO). Purified proteins were added to the aqueous sub-phase, and the solution was stirred for 5 min to ensure good mixing. A software program (BROWSE, available upon request) was modified to apply voltage pulses and facilitate membrane lifetime measurements.DISCUSSIONIn this work we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the pro-apoptotic activity of cleaved Bcl-xL. Our results provide compelling evidence that cleavage of Bcl-xLmarkedly enhances its pore-forming activity. The C-terminal cleavage fragment of Bcl-xL found in dying cells is sufficient for this activity. The cleavage-induced increase in pore-forming activity likely accounts for the apoptosis-inducing function of cleaved Bcl-xL through the permeabilization of mitochondrial membranes to release apoptogenic intermembrane proteins.Post-transcriptional modifications can affect the function of Bcl-2 family proteins by modulating their subcellular localization (1Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar, 3Fadeel B. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1647-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The pro-apoptotic activity of Bcl-xL elicited by proteolytic cleavage could be due, at least in part, to an increased affinity of the cleaved fragments for mitochondrial membranes, as shown for tBid (13Luo X.

Med. 2000; 192: 1391-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). However, Bcl-xL and its C-terminal cleavage products bound similarly to LUV. Furthermore, in situ cleavage of membrane-bound Bcl-xL increased its pore-forming activity to levels similar to those obtained with ΔN76Bcl-xL. Bcl-xL, but not Bid, contains a hydrophobic C-terminal domain that has been proposed to function as a membrane-anchoring domain (1Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3238) Google Scholar, 2Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4780) Google Scholar, 3Fadeel B. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1647-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Although deletion of this hydrophobic domain greatly impaired the association of Bcl-xL to LUV, efficient binding of full-length Bcl-xL, ΔN76Bcl-xL, and ΔN61Bcl-xL to LUV required the presence of anionic lipids in the liposomal membrane. Because Bcl-xL has a biased charge distribution with basic residues being concentrated in one region of the molecule (56Aritomi M. Kunishima N. Inohara N. Ishibashi Y. Ohta S. Morikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27886-27892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), this positively charged region might help protein docking to the membrane surfaces rich in negatively charged lipids. Alternatively, the C terminus of Bcl-xL may lie within the hydrophobic pocket delimited by the BH1, -2, and -3 domains, as recently shown for Bax (30Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjnadra N. Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar), and anionic lipids may induce a conformational change in Bcl-xLleading to exposure of the hydrophobic C terminus for insertion into membrane. Irrespective of the exact mechanism underlying the association of Bcl-xL with intracellular membranes in vivo, our results suggest that the increased pore-forming activity induced by proteolytic cleavage of Bcl-xL is likely independent of changes in its intracellular distribution.How do mitochondrially localized Bcl-2 relatives induce release of cytochrome c? In particular, do they act on mitochondrial membranes directly, through their endogenous pore-forming activity, or indirectly, through their ability to interact with other proteins (24Vander Heiden M.G.

In addition to these proteins, three new proteins were also identified in the 55 S mitoribosome. We have clearly identified a mitochondrial homologue of S12, which is a key regulatory protein of translation fidelity and a candidate for the autosomal dominant deafness gene, DFNA4. The apoptosis-related protein DAP3 was found to be a component of the small subunit, indicating a new function for the mitoribosome in programmed cell death.

The mammalian mitochondrial ribosome (mitoribosome)1 has a smaller sedimentation coefficient (55 S), compared with the bacterial ribosome (70 S), and consists of large 39 S and small 28 S subunits (5O'Brien T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3409-3417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The former contains 16 S and the latter contains 12 S rRNAs as RNA components. The mammalian mitoribosome contains no counterpart for the 5 S rRNA found in bacteria. A recent physicochemical study has revealed that the rat mitoribosome has a large molecular mass (3.57 MDa) compared with that of the Escherichia coli ribosome (2.49 MDa) (6Patel V.B. Cunningham C.C. Hantgan R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6739-6746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which is explained by the fact that the protein to RNA ratio is completely reversed between these two ribosomes (7Hamilton M.G. O'Brien T.W. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5400-5403Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The protein composition of the mitoribosome has been estimated to be about 75%, which indicates that large parts of bacterial rRNA domains have been replaced by protein components during mitochondrial evolution from a eubacteria-like endosymbiont in eukaryotic cell progenitors. The functional equivalency of the mammalian mitoribosome to the E. coli ribosome has been suggested by the observation that mammalian mitochondrial translation factors, EF-Tu, EF-G, and IF-2, can be exchanged for bacterial factors on bacterial ribosome (8Schwartzbach C.J. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19125-19131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Chung H.K. Spremulli L.L. J. Biol.

The mammalian mitoribosome provides an intriguing model for defining the functional domains of rRNA and a means to verify the evolutionary concept of the transition from the “RNA world” to the “ribonucleoprotein world.” Translation initiation in mammalian mitochondria is one of the most characteristic features of mitochondrial protein synthesis. Mitochondrial mRNAs encoded by mtDNA do not have significant leader sequences on the 5′ side of their initiation codons, such as a Shine-Dalgarno sequence, nor do they have a cap structure at their 5′ ends (11Ojala D.K. Montoya J. Attardi G. Nature. 1980; 287: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 12Attardi G. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1985; 93: 93-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). It is considered that mitochondrial protein synthesis starts directly at initiation codons located on the 5′ end of these mRNAs. The 28 S small subunit of the mitoribosome is thought to play a key role in this peculiar initiation system since it has been reported that the 28 S subunit of the mitoribosome has GTP binding activity that may participate in translation initiation (13O'Brien T.W.

They identified 52 protein spots in the large subunit and 33 protein spots in the small subunit. Over the past few years, more than 20 mitoribosomal proteins from rat and bovine mitoribosomes have been identified by several groups using peptide sequencing and data base screening (15Goldschmidt-Reisin S.

We recently analyzed 39 S large subunit proteins of the bovine mitoribosome by peptide analysis using mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing, and we identified 31 mitoribosomal proteins including 15 new ones, along with the complete human and mouse cDNA sequences (22Suzuki T. Terasaki M. Takemoto-Hori C. Hanada T. Ueda T. Wada A. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21724-21736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). An interesting finding of this study was that mitoribosomal proteins whose binding sites on rRNA are shortened or lost carry an N- or C-terminal extension, whereas mitoribosomal proteins with conserved rRNA-binding sites have a similar molecular weight to those of their E. coli counterparts. These enlarged proteins, together with several extra proteins that are specifically found in the mitoribosome, obviously provide both structural and functional compensation for the deficit of rRNA in the mitoribosome, such that the whole molecular architecture of the ribosome is conserved in bacteria and mitochondria. In similar studies on the 28 S small subunit, 14 proteins have been identified to date, including five homologues of bacterial ribosomal proteins and a further nine extra proteins. In the work presented in this paper, we report the systematic identification of small subunit proteins by proteomic analysis using electrospray ionization/ion trap mass spectrometry. Twenty one proteins, including 11 newly identified proteins, have been detected. The results demonstrate characteristic features of small subunit proteins and suggest similar structural compensation for the reduced rRNA content through the inclusion of larger proteins. In addition, we have identified three new proteins from the intact 55 S mitoribosome. As a result of this study, we can now diagrammatically represent and assign a total of 55 spots on an RFHR two-dimensional PAGE of the mammalian mitochondrial ribosome. These data provide a new landmark for proteomic analysis of the mammalian mitoribosome, genetic information on mitochondrial protein synthesis, and candidate genes for respiratory defects associated with human mitochondrial diseases. Mitochondria were prepared from a fresh bovine liver according to standard methods in the literature (23Schwartzbach C.J. Farwell M. Liao H.X. Spremulli L.L. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 248-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 55 S mitoribosome was purified using sucrose density gradient centrifugation as described previously (22Suzuki T. Terasaki M.

The 39 S large and 28 S small subunits were purified from the isolated 55 S mitoribosome using the same conditions published in our previous report (22Suzuki T. Terasaki M. Takemoto-Hori C. Hanada T.

Total 55 S ribosomal proteins were prepared as described (22Suzuki T. Terasaki M. Takemoto-Hori C. Hanada T. Ueda T. Wada A. Watanabe K. J. Biol.

(Tokyo). 1986; 100: 1583-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 25Wada A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 100: 1595-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Protein spots on an RFHR-2D gel were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and then excised and completely dried in vacuo. The dried gel pieces were then rehydrated in 5–10 µl of a trypsin digest solution (0.2m NH4HCO3, 15 ng/mll-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-trypsin (Pierce)). After the gel pieces had absorbed the liquid, 10–20 µl of 0.2 m NH4HCO3 was added. The digestion was carried out overnight at 30 °C. The digested peptides were extracted from the gel by shaking in 200 µl of a 60% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid solution for 20 min. This step was repeated twice. The collected fractions containing peptides were batched, dried in a speedvac, and then dissolved in 80 µl of 0.1% formic acid. A Finnigan LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoQuest) equipped with an electrospray ionization source was used for peptide analysis of the mitoribosomal proteins. The LC/MS analysis was performed using an ODS reverse-phase column (Monitor C18, 0.1 × 15 cm; Michrom BioResource) connected on-line to the electrospray interface. A gradient consisting of 0.1% formic acid in H2O (A) and acetonitrile (B) was developed from 0% B to 70% B over a period of 35 min at a flow rate of 50 µl/min by using the Magic 2002 high pressure liquid chromatography system (Michrom BioResource). The flow rate of the sheath gas and the capillary temperature were kept at 55 arb and 235 °C, respectively. The zoom scan analysis and MS/MS experiment by collision-induced dissociation using the data-dependent scan (triple play) were performed in the range of 300–2000m/z throughout the separation. The uninterpreted data set of the peptide product ions for each protein, generated from the triple play analysis, was used to search the non-redundant protein data base and the human and mouse EST data bases using the SEQUEST search program (26Dongre A.R. Eng J.K. Yates III, J.R. Trends Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 418-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 27Gatlin C.L. Eng J.K. Cross S.T. Detter J.C. Yates III, J.R. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Excised gel pieces were dried in vacuo and soaked for 1 h in a buffer containing 10 mm CAPS-NaOH (pH 11) and 10% methanol. Each protein from the gel was blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Fluorotrans, Paul) by electroelution using an Electroelutor (Nihon Eido Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Amino acid sequencing was performed using a gas-phase protein sequencer (PPSQ-21, Shimadzu). In our previous study, we identified 31 large subunit proteins from the intact 55 S mitoribosome separated by RFHR two-dimensional PAGE (22Suzuki T. Terasaki M. Takemoto-Hori C. Hanada T. Ueda T. Wada A. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21724-21736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Most of the residual protein spots on the two-dimensional PAGE are considered to belong to the 28 S small subunit. The purified 28 S subunit was also separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE as reported in a previous study (22Suzuki T. Terasaki M. Takemoto-Hori C. Hanada T. Ueda T. Wada A. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21724-21736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Each protein spot was digested with trypsin in the gel and subjected to LC/MS/MS analysis using electrospray ionization/ion trap mass spectrometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each peptide analysis produced a data set consisting of a molecular mass, a charge state, and a collision-induced dissociation (CID) spectrum. The data set obtained was then used to search the non-redundant protein data base and/or dbEST of human (and mouse) using the SEQUEST algorithm (26Dongre A.R. Eng J.K. Yates III, J.R. Trends Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 418-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Partial cDNA sequences, corresponding to the peptides from each mitoribosomal protein, were obtained from the EST data base. Related EST sequences were then retrieved using a BLASTN (28Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) search with the hit sequence as a query. Using this information, the longest possible cDNA sequence for each protein was assembled in silico. Sequencing errors and gaps were corrected by comparing many overlapping data base entries. In this analysis, 21 proteins and their corresponding cDNA sequences were identified for the small subunits of human and mouse, including 11 new proteins (Fig. 1 and TableI). The S2 homologue was identified by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE analysis of the 28 S subunit (data not shown), since it could not be found using two-dimensional PAGE analysis of the 55 S mitoribosome. The reasons for this are unknown. N-terminal sequencing was performed on each protein with a free N terminus to determine the cleavage site of the mitochondrial importing signal peptide (see Fig. 4).Table IProtein components of the small ribosomal subunit from human mitochondriaSpot nameFamily nameMassRatio (H/E)Diff.

We first demonstrated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunocytochemistry that BMCs express the type I parathyroid hormone/PTHrP receptor. Treatment with PTHrP increased osteogenic cell proliferation as determined by [3H]thymidine and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and augmented osteogenic colonies. Immunocytochemistry and Western blotting revealed no direct effect on expression of the osteoblast markers, type I collagen, bone sialoprotein, and osteocalcin, indicating that PTHrP did not directly stimulate differentiation in this system. PTHrP increased mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity in BMC and MAPK activity, and PTHrP-induced osteogenic cell proliferation could be blocked by the MEK inhibitor PD-098059. PTHrP also increased Ras activity in BMC. Although wortmannin and H8, inhibitors of phosphoinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase A, respectively, did not block PTHrP-stimulated Ras or MAPK activity, chelerythrin chloride, a known protein kinase C inhibitor, did block these PTHrP actions as well as PTHrP-induced osteogenic cell proliferation. These results demonstrate that PTHrP stimulates osteogenic cell proliferation in rat marrow mesenchymal progenitor cells through protein kinase C-dependent activation of the Ras and MAPK signaling pathway.

Originally, PTHrP was considered to be a skeletal catabolic agent as patients with MAH develop marked osteoclastic bone resorption. However, as is the case with PTH in hyperparathyroidism, this catabolic skeletal effect of PTHrP in MAH occurs in the context of continuous exposure of the skeleton to PTHrP. In contrast, administration of PTH to rodents on an intermittent basis increases bone mass. This anabolic effect of intermittent PTH administration in osteoporosis has been extensively explored (1Reeve J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 440-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Several groups have also demonstrated that intermittent PTHrP administration increases bone mass in rats in vivo (2Everhart-Caye M. Inzucchi S.E. Guinness-Henry J. Mitnick M.A. Stewart A.F. J. Clin.

Gundberg C. Mitnick M. Stewart A.F. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1998; 83: 2786-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Analogs of PTHrP have been developed in an attempt to improve its anabolic efficacy. One such analog, RS-66271, has received attention because of its pronounced bone anabolic activity when given intermittently to ovariectomized, osteopenic rats (10Vickery B.H. Avnur Z. Cheng Y. Chiou S.S. Leaffer D. Caulfield J.P. Kimmel D.B. Ho T. Krstenansky J.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1943-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A rapid increase in the number of osteoblasts on trabecular surfaces was observed following initiation of treatment (11Leaffer D. Sweeney M. Kellerman L.A. Avnur Z. Krstenansky J.L. Vickery B.H. Caulfield J.P. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3624-3631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional evidence in support of an anabolic effect of PTHrP on bone comes from studies of heterozygous PTHrP “knockout” animals that exhibit haploinsufficiency and evidence of reduced trabecular bone volume (12Amizuka N. Karaplis A.C. Henderson J.E. Warshawsky H. Lipman M.L. Matsuki Y. Ejiri S. Tanaka M. Izumi N. Ozawa H. Goltzman D. Dev. Biol. 1996; 175: 166-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Despite these observations the cellular basis for the anabolic actions of PTHrP in vivo is still not well understood. The osteogenic potential of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells has been very well characterized in vitro and in vivo (13Beresford J.N. Clin. Orthop. 1989; 240: 270-280PubMed Google Scholar, 14Friedenstein A.J. Chailakhyan R.K. Gerasimov U.V. Cell Tissue Kinet. 1987; 20: 263-272PubMed Google Scholar, 15Malaval L. Modrowski D. Gupta A.K. Aubin J.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 158: 555-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). When cultured in the presence of dexamethasone, ascorbic acid, and β-glycerophosphate, these cells proliferate and differentiate along the osteogenic lineage, producing bone-like nodules with a mineralized extracellular matrix. Treatment with 1,25-(OH)2D3, prostaglandin E2, or PTH in vivo increases the number of osteogenic colonies inex vivo bone marrow cultures suggesting that their effects may be mediated via bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (16Erben R.G. Scutt A.M. Miao D. Kollenkirchen U. Haberey M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4629-4635Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17Weinreb M. Suponitzky I. Keila S.

Bone (NY). 1994; 15: 717-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of action of PTHrP on osteogenic cell proliferation and/or differentiation in vitro has not been reported. Insight into the mechanism of action of PTH and PTHrP has been provided by the discovery of the type I PTH/PTHrP receptor (PTHR) (19Abou-Samra A.B. Juppner H. Force T. Freeman M.W. Kong X.F.

This G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) was shown to bind the NH2-terminal regions of both PTH and PTHrP with almost equal affinity (21Mannstadt M. Juppner H. Gardella T.J. Am. J.

Res. 1999; 14: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and is associated with at least two signal transduction systems, the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway and the phospholipase C/protein kinase C pathway (21Mannstadt M. Juppner H. Gardella T.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F665-F675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Verheijen and Defize (24Verheijen M.H. Defize L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3423-3429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) have reported that PTH activates mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) via a cAMP-mediated pathway independent of Ras in both Chinese hamster ovary R15 cells and parietal yolk sac carcinoma cells, and Swarthout et al.

In recent years, a number of GPCRs, operating through several subfamilies of heterotrimeric G proteins, have been shown to activate the MAP kinase cascade; this includes receptors for thrombin, bombesin, bradykinin, α-adrenergic and nucleotide (P2Y) agonists (26Gutkind J.S.

In the present studies, we investigated the effects of PTHrP on osteogenic cell proliferation and differentiation in vitroby employing primary rat bone marrow cell cultures. Our results demonstrate that PTHrP stimulates osteogenic cell proliferation through PKC-dependent activation of the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway. Human PTHrP-(1–34) was obtained from Peninsula Laboratories, Inc., CA. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), wortmannin, chelerythrin chloride, and H8 were purchased from Sigma. Antibodies were obtained as follows: rabbit anti-PTH receptor antibody (Babco, Berkeley, CA); mouse anti-vimentin monoclonal antibody (Medicorp, Montreal, Quebec, Canada); mouse anti-bromodeoxyuridine monoclonal antibody (Sigma); affinity-purified goat anti-human type I collagen antibody (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc., Birmingham, AL); goat anti-mouse osteocalcin (Biomedical Technologies, Inc., Stoughton, MA); rabbit anti-human bone sialoprotein LF-6, (34Bianco P.

Tibiae and femurs of 200-g male Wistar rats were removed under aseptic conditions, and bone marrow cells (BMC) were flushed out with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 50 µg/ml ascorbic acid, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 10−8m dexamethasone. Cells were dispersed by repeated pipetting, and a single-cell suspension was achieved by forcefully expelling the cells through a 22-gauge syringe needle. 106 total bone marrow cells were cultured in 36-cm2 Petri dishes in 5 ml of the above-mentioned medium. The medium was changed every 4 days. The non-adherent cells containing hematopoietic elements were removed by pipetting gently when the medium was changed for the first time (35Conget P.A. Minguell J.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Only monocytic cells remained. Cultures were maintained for 6–18 days. At the end of the culture period cells were washed with PBS, fixed with PLP fixative (2% paraformaldehyde containing 0.075 m lysine and 0.01m sodium periodate solution), and stained cytochemically or immunocytochemically. Proteins were extracted from these cells for Western blotting and MAPK and Ras assays, and RNA was extracted from these cells for RT-PCR, as described below. The proliferation of osteogenic cells was assessed by measuring the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fraction of cells. 4 × 105 BMC were cultured in 6-well plates under the conditions described in the figure legends and were pulsed with [3H]thymidine (1 µCi/ml of medium) for the last 6 h of incubation with test agents. After the incubation period, the medium was removed, and the cell monolayer was washed with ice-cold PBS and then detached by treatment with 1 ml of 0.25% trypsin for ∼5 min. Further tryptic activity was inhibited by addition of 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. DNA containing incorporated [3H]thymidine was precipitated in cold 7.5% trichloroacetic acid, centrifuged, washed three times with 7.5% trichloroacetic acid, and then counted on an LKB Rackbeta scintillation counter. The proliferation of osteogenic cells was also assessed by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation assay. The cells from 6-day primary bone marrow cell cultures were pulsed with 5 µm BrdUrd for the last 6 h of incubation with test agents. After the culture period, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with PLP fixative solution. After air drying, the cells were stored at −20 °C until double staining for alkaline phosphatase and BrdUrd as described below. BrdUrd-positive cells were quantitated by image analysis. Cells from 18-day primary BMC cultures were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in 100 mm Tris maleate buffer containing 0.2 mg/ml naphthol AS-MX phosphate (Sigma) dissolved in ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (Sigma) as a substrate and fast red TR (0.4 mg/ml, Sigma) as a stain for the reaction product. After washing with distilled water and air drying, ALP-positive colony areas were measured by image analysis as described below. Following ALP staining, cells were stained with 3% silver nitrate for 20 min under ultraviolet light. After washing with distilled water and air drying, calcified positive colony areas were measured by image analysis. Computer-assisted image analysis was performed as described previously (36Miao D. Bai X. Panda D. McKee M.D. Karaplis A.C. Goltzman D. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 926-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Briefly, images of stained culture dishes were photographed with transmitted light over a light box. All images were processed using Northern Eclipse image analysis software, version 5.0 (Empix Imaging Inc., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). For determining the area of positive colonies in cultured cells, thresholds were set using green and red channels. The thresholds were determined interactively and empirically on the basis of three different images. Subsequently, this set threshold was used to analyze automatically all recorded images of all sections that were stained in the same staining session under identical conditions. Cultured cells in Petri dishes were stained immunocytochemically for type I PTH/PTHrP receptor (PTHR), vimentin, type I collagen, bone sialoprotein, and osteocalcin using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) technique as described previously (36Miao D. Bai X. Panda D. McKee M.D. Karaplis A.C. Goltzman D. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 926-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The cultured cells were first treated with 0.5% bovine testicular hyaluronidase (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C, to increase antibody penetration and access to epitopes. Primary antibody was applied to cells overnight at room temperature. As a negative control, the preimmune serum was substituted for the primary antibody. After washing with high salt buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 2.5% NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.6) for 10 min at room temperature followed by two 10-min washes with TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 7.6), the cells were incubated with secondary antibody (biotinylated rabbit anti-goat IgG, biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG, biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG, Fab special (Sigma)). Cells were then washed as before and incubated with the Vectastain ABC-AP kit (Vector Laboratories, Ontario, Canada) for 45 min. After washing as before, red pigmentation to demarcate regions of immunostaining was produced by a 10–15-min treatment with Fast Red TR/Naphthol AS-MX phosphate (Sigma, containing 1 mm levamisole as endogenous ALP inhibitor). After washing with distilled water, the sections were counter-stained with methyl green and mounted with Kaiser's glycerol jelly. Following ALP cytochemistry the cells cultured in Petri dishes were stained for BrdUrd reactivity by the ABC immunoperoxidase technique as described above, except for immunoreactivity detected by using the Vectastain Elite ABC kit and staining with Vector SG substrate (Vector Laboratories, Ontario, Canada). Antigenicity appeared as a gray coloration. Proteins were extracted from 18-day cultures and quantitated by the protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Protein samples (30 µg) were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Immunoblotting was carried out using antibodies as described above. Bands were visualized using the ECL chemiluminescence detection method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA for RT-PCR was extracted from 6-day BMC cultures by a single-step method, using Trizol reagent, and reversed-transcribed and amplified by PCR using Qiagen one-step TR-PCR kit (Qiagen Inc., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instructions. We used the following primer sets to amplify PTHR: forward 5′-TGCTTGCCACTAAGCTTCG-3′ and reverse 5′-TCCTAATCTCTGCCTGCACC-3′. Cells from 6-day BMC cultures were transferred to serum-free media overnight and then preincubated with or without 10 µm H8 for 30 min and then incubated with or without 10−7m PTHrP for 10 min. Protein kinase A (PKA) activity was assessed with PKA Assay Kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Six readings were taken for each treatment. Cells from 6-day BMC cultures were transferred into serum-free media overnight and then challenged with various reagents as described in the figure legends. After stimulation, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 20 mmNaH2PO4, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4) and lysed for 20 min with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1% glycerol, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, and a protease mixture tablet/10 ml of buffer). The samples were collected and microcentrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatants were collected, assayed for protein, and prepared for Western blot analysis with antibody against the active, phosphorylated form of MAPK (37Tong X.K. Hussain N.K. Adams A.G. O'Bryan J.P. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29894-29899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) or Akt (Thr-308) (38Huang H.M. Huang C.J. Yen J.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 1764-1771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were stripped and re-probed with polyclonal antibodies against MAPK (ERK-1 and ERK-2) or Akt. Cells, treated as described for the MAPK assay, were washed in PBS and then scraped from the dish with 0.3 ml of ice-cold Ras assay buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% mm β-mercaptoethanol, and a protease mixture tablet/10 ml of buffer). The extracts were microcentrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 3 min, and a 0.03-ml aliquot of the supernatant was retained as a starting material, and the remainder was applied to ∼25 µg of a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein encoding the Ras-GTP binding domain of Raf1 coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads (37Tong X.K.

Following a 2-h incubation, the beads were washed 4 times with 1 ml of ice-cold Ras assay buffer, and material bound to the beads was eluted with SDS gel sample buffer and processed for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis along with the starting material aliquot. The samples were processed for Western blots with the monoclonal antibody against Ras. Data from image analysis of stained cell cultures are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were made using one-way analysis of variance, with a probability of less than 0.05 being considered significant. Cells were characterized in early (6 day) cultures of bone marrow cells. Following removal of the non-adherent cells at 4 days, only two kind of adherent cells were observed morphologically. Over 90% of cells were large fibroblast-like stromal cells, and less than 10% were small round cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage (35Conget P.A. Minguell J.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Oil red O staining was negative for the presence of adipocytes. Expression of the PTH/PTHrP receptor (PTHR) was assessed by RT-PCR and immunocytochemical staining. PTHR mRNA was expressed in cultures and was not apparently up- or down-regulated by treatment of the cells with PTHrP for 6 days (Fig.1A). PTHR protein was evident in all fibroblast-like stomal cells and was localized mainly to the membrane and cytoplasm of these cells (Fig. 1 B). Immunostaining for vimentin, a marker of mesenchymal cells (42Altmannsberger M. Osborn M. Schauer A. Weber K. Lab. Invest. 1981; 45: 427-434PubMed Google Scholar, 43Gown A.M. Vogel A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 414-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), showed that all adherent cells in the 6-day cultures of bone marrow cells were positive for vimentin (Fig. 1 C). Cytochemical staining for ALP revealed that 83.7 ± 6.4% of cells were positive for ALP (Fig. 1 D). Immunostaining for bone sialoprotein, type I collagen, and osteocalcin showed that all cells were positive for bone sialoprotein (Fig. 1 E); all fibroblast-like cells but no small round cells were positive for type I collagen (Fig. 1 F); and all cells were negative for osteocalcin (Fig. 1 G). Consequently all cells at 6 days of culture expressed vimentin and bone sialoprotein, and the majority of cells was positive for ALP and type I collagen, and none expressed osteocalcin. The majority of the cells (over 90%) at this stage was therefore mesenchymal stromal cells (pre-osteoblastic cells) but not mature osteoblasts. We next explored the potential action of PTHrP on BMCs. Following 18 days in culture, cells were stained cytochemically for ALP to identify potential osteogenic areas and with von Kossa to identify calcified colonies. Positive ALP and calcified areas were quantitated by image analysis. Treatment with PTHrP at day 4 resulted in a significant increase in ALP-positive colony area compared with control cultures. However, calcified colony area was not altered significantly between control and PTHrP-treated cultures. Consequently, the ratio of ALP-positive colony area to calcified colony area was significantly increased in PTHrP-treated cultures compared with control cultures (Figs.2and3), i.e. mineralization was reduced.Figure 3Quantitative data from cytochemical staining for ALP and from von Kossa staining for calcium. Cells from 18-day primary BMC cultures incubated in the absence (Control) or presence of 10−7m PTHrP (PTHrP) on day 4 were stained cytochemically for ALP and with the von Kossa method for calcified colonies as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Leftand middle bars, resulting stained cultures were quantitated by image analysis and expressed as a percent positive area for ALP and CA, respectively, per dish. Each value is the mean ± S.E. of three determinations.Right bars, results are also expressed as the ratio of Ca/ALP area × 100%. * denotes a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) in the PTHrP-treated cultures relative to the control cultures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To assess further whether the increase of ALP-positive colony area in PTHrP-treated cultures resulted from osteogenic cell proliferation or differentiation, we performed [3H]thymidine incorporation and BrdUrd assays and analyzed cultured cells for phenotypic indices of osteoblasts by immunocytochemical staining and Western blotting. Treatment of cultures with 10−7, 10−8, and 10−9m PTHrP increased [3H]thymidine incorporation by 149.2 ± 12.8, 79.8 ± 6.5, and 53.2 ± 4.2%, respectively, in 6-day cultures, as compared with control cultures. This stimulation was also confirmed by BrdUrd incorporation assay, which demonstrated more BrdUrd-positive cells after 10−7m PTHrP treatment of cultures (76.5 ± 7.2%) than before (32.8 ± 2.2%) (Fig. 4, A andB). Consequently, both methods confirmed the proliferative effect of PTHrP in these cells. We then explored the effect of PTHrP treatment on the expression of a variety of phenotypic markers of osteoblast differentiation in cells within the colonies. When these cells were cultured for 10 days or more, almost all cells expressed type I collagen, bone sialoprotein, and osteocalcin. Consequently, these cells expressed several indices consistent with an osteoblast phenotype. After PTHrP treatment increased numbers of cells staining for type I collagen, bone sialoprotein, and osteocalcin in colonies were observed (Fig. 4, C–H). However, no difference was found in the levels of vimentin, type I collagen, bone sialoprotein, and osteocalcin per unit of cell protein following PTHrP treatment (Fig. 5).Figure 5Western blot analysis of vimentin, type I collagen, bone sialoprotein, and osteocalcin in cells from primary BMC cultures. BMC were cultured as in Fig. 4 for 10 days, after which protein was extracted for Western blotting for vimentin (VIM), type I collagen (Col I), and bone sialoprotein (BSP) or for 18 days, after which protein was extracted for osteocalcin (OCN). Extracts were analyzed by Western blot employing 30 µg of extracted protein as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To explore the possible mechanism by which PTHrP stimulates osteogenic cell proliferation, we first examined whether PTHrP activates endogenous MAPK in osteogenic cells from 6-day BMC cultures.

We focus here on the signaling mechanism of the ectodomain shedding of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like growth factor (pro HB-EGF). Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a ligand for seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors, stimulates the shedding of pro HB-EGF, which constitutes a G protein-coupled receptor-mediated transactivation of the EGF receptor. Experiments using a series of inhibitors and overexpression of mutant forms of signaling molecules revealed that the Ras-Raf-MEK signal is essential for the LPA-induced shedding. In addition, the small GTPase Rac is involved in the LPA-induced shedding, possibly to promote MEK activation. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate is another potent inducer of pro HB-EGF shedding. We also demonstrate that the LPA-induced pathway is distinct from the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced pathway and that these pathways constitute a dual signaling cascade that regulates the shedding of pro HB-EGF.

The ectodomain shedding of membrane proteins changes their fate, location, and mode of action; thus, it affects the biological activities of membrane proteins (1Massague J. Pandiella A. Annu. Rev.

Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (EGF)1-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is a member of the EGF family (12Higashiyama S. Abraham J.A. Miller J. Fiddes J.C. Klagsbrun M. Science. 1991; 251: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Like EGF, transforming growth factor-α, and amphiregulin, HB-EGF binds to and stimulates the phosphorylation of the EGF receptor (EGFR). HB-EGF is synthesized as a membrane-anchored precursor protein of 208 amino acids composed of signal peptide, heparin-binding, EGF-like, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains. Although the membrane-anchored form of HB-EGF (pro HB-EGF) is cleaved on the cell surface to yield a soluble growth factor of 75–86 amino acids, a considerable amount of pro HB-EGF remains uncleaved on the cell surface (13Goishi K. Higashiyama S. Klagsbrun M. Nakano N. Umata T. Ishikawa M. Mekada E. Taniguchi N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 967-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Pro HB-EGF is not merely a precursor of the soluble form; it is also biologically active such that it forms complexes with both CD9 (14Iwamoto R. Higashiyama S. Mitamura T. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2322-2330Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and integrin α3β1 (15Nakamura K. Iwamoto R. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1691-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and transduces biological signals to neighboring cells in a non-diffusible manner (16Higashiyama S. Iwamoto R. Goishi K. Raab G. Taniguchi N. Klagsbrun M. Mekada E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Moreover, although secreted mature HB-EGF (sHB-EGF) is a potent mitogen for a number of cell types (12Higashiyama S. Abraham J.A. Miller J. Fiddes J.C. Klagsbrun M. Science. 1991; 251: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar), pro HB-EGF may act as a negative regulator of cell proliferation (17Iwamoto R. Handa K. Mekada E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25906-25912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, the processing of the juxtamembrane domain of pro HB-EGF into sHB-EGF means that the mode of action of this growth factor is switched from juxtacrine to paracrine, or that its activity with respect to cell growth is inverse. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a potent activator of protein kinase C (PKC), induces ectodomain shedding of a number of membrane proteins (18Aicher B. Lerch M.M. Muller T. Schilling J. Ullrich A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 681-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 19Arribas J. Coodly L. Vollmer P. Kishimoto T.K. Rose-John S. Massague J. J.

A. 1991; 88: 1726-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), suggesting that PKC is involved in a cellular signaling pathway for regulated shedding. Ectodomain shedding of pro HB-EGF is also accelerated by TPA (13Goishi K. Higashiyama S. Klagsbrun M. Nakano N. Umata T. Ishikawa M. Mekada E. Taniguchi N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 967-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). As demonstrated for other transmembrane proteins, TPA-induced ectodomain shedding of pro HB-EGF is blocked by hydroxamate metalloprotease inhibitors, indicating that a metalloprotease is involved in TPA-induced shedding (21Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Ohno S. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). We have shown, using monkey kidney Vero-H cells (stable transfectants of Vero cells overexpressing human pro HB-EGF), that the presence of a constitutively active form of PKCδ results in the shedding of pro HB-EGF, whereas kinase-negative PKCδ suppresses TPA-induced shedding (21Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Ohno S. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). MDC9 (ADAM9), a member of the metalloprotease disintegrin family (22Blobel C.P. Cell. 1997; 90: 589-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), binds PKCδ to the cytoplasmic domain of MDC9 in vivo and in vitro. Overexpression of MDC9 results in the shedding of pro HB-EGF, whereas MDC9 mutants lacking the entire metalloprotease domain or the conserved histidine residues in the metalloprotease domain inhibit the TPA-induced cleavage. These results indicate that PKCδ and MDC9 are involved in the TPA-induced ectodomain shedding of pro HB-EGF (21Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Ohno S. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Although TPA is a potent agonist for the ectodomain shedding of pro HB-EGF, physiological ligands also induce ectodomain shedding of pro HB-EGF. G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) ligands including lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and endothelin stimulate the shedding of pro HB-EGF in COS and HEK293 cells (23Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). We have shown that serum contains at least one factor that induces shedding of pro HB-EGF and that LPA is a major factor in fetal calf serum for the stimulation of pro HB-EGF shedding (24Hirata M. Umata T. Takahashi T. Ohnuma M. Miura Y. Mekada E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 915-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Angiotensin II and insulin-like growth factor-1 also induce ectodomain shedding of pro HB-EGF (25Eguchi S. Dempsey P.J. Frank G.D. Motley E.D. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7957-7962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 26Roudabush F.L. Pierce K.L. Maudsley S. Khan K.D. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol.

This ligand-induced shedding of pro HB-EGF results in EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, referred to as “transactivation” (23Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). Transactivation of EGFR is a general aspect of GPCR signaling and is critical for the mitogenic activity of many GPCR ligands (27Luttrell L.M. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 28Hackel P.O. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Ullrich A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Because of the biological significance of LPA (29Moolenaar W.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) and its marked potency to induce pro HB-EGF shedding, we studied here the signal transduction mechanism through which LPA influences the shedding of pro HB-EGF, using Vero-H cells.

All transfections, which used plasmids, were carried out following a previously described method (35Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). Activation of Ras and Rac was assayed using GST-RBD and GST-PAK, respectively, following methods reported previously (36Foschi M. Chari S. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6439-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 37Royal I. Lamarche-Vane N. Lamorte L. Kaibuchi K. Park M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1709-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Vero-H cells (5 × 105 cells) were cultured for 18 h in serum-free modified Eagle's medium with nonessential amino acids and then treated with the indicated concentrations of LPA or TPA for 30 min. For detection of transmembrane forms and tail fragments of HB-EGF, cells were collected and suspended in 70 µl of lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 30 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 0.3m NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 20 µg/ml antipain, and 10 µg/ml chymostatin. After 10 min of incubation on ice, the lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. Western blot analysis was performed with goat anti-human HB-EGF carboxyl-terminal domain antibody. For detection of secreted HB-EGF, sHB-EGF in the culture medium was trapped with heparin-Sepharose beads and eluted with SDS gel sample buffer. The eluted materials were subjected to Western blotting and detected with goat anti-HB-EGF neutralizing antibody. The antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG using ECL-Plus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunostaining of pro HB-EGF was performed with goat anti-HB-EGF neutralizing antibody and Cy3-conjugated anti-goat IgG as described previously (21Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Ohno S. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). To detect the expression of transfected proteins, fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 min and stained with the antibodies indicated in the legends of Figs.2, 4, and 6, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated second antibody. The images were captured with a FISH imager system (Carl Zeiss, Inc.). To detect cells expressing dominant-negative forms of PKCδ, MDC9, and Raf-1, cells were cotransfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP). The percentage of pro HB-EGF-positive cells was determined by counting the number of pro HB-EGF-positive cells among cells concomitantly expressing products of transfected cDNA. The values were determined based on the results obtained in at least two independent transfections, and at least 100 independent cells positive for transfected proteins or marker proteins were examined in each experiment. Scoring was performed in a completely blind manner.Figure 4Involvement of Rac activity in LPA-induced shedding. A, overexpression of dominant-negative mutants of the Rho family of GTPases. Vero-H cells were transfected with plasmids (10 µg) encoding dominant-negative mutants of RhoA (panels a and b), Rac1 (panels c andd), and Cdc42 (panels e and f). After 48 h of transfection, the cells were incubated with LPA (60 µm) for 30 min and then double-stained with anti-HB-EGF antibody for detection of the pro HB-EGF ectodomain (red) and with anti-FLAG antibody for detection of the expression of dominant-negative mutants (green).

Percentages of pro HB-EGF-positive cells among the transfected cells are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) At the beginning of this study, we confirmed the LPA-induced shedding in Vero-H cells by Western blot analysis. Fig.1 shows the immunoblots of the cell lysates (upper panel) and culture medium (lower panel) of Vero-H cells incubated with either LPA or TPA and detected with anti-pro HB-EGF antibodies that recognize the cytoplasmic domain and the EGF-like domain, respectively. In the cell lysates, the bands ranging from 20 to 31 kDa correspond to the transmembrane forms of pro HB-EGF, and the smallest band shown at the position between the 18.7- and 7.2-kDa molecular markers is the proteolytically cleaved fragment comprising the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains (tail fragment). The addition of LPA strongly induced cleavage and generated a large amount of the tail fragment in the cell lysate (Fig. 1,lane 2). Consistent with the appearance of the tail fragment, sHB-EGF was secreted in the culture medium. The levels of pro HB-EGF shedding induced by LPA and by TPA were similar (Fig. 1,lane 3). A hydroxamic acid-based metalloprotease inhibitor, KB-R8301, completely inhibited both TPA- and LPA-induced cleavage of pro HB-EGF (Fig. 1, lanes 5 and 6, respectively), suggesting that a metalloprotease is involved in both cases. LPA activates the small GTPase Ras through the mediation of the βγ-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (38Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lansing T.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19443-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The pull-down assay for Ras activation indicated that LPA activated Ras endogenous to Vero-H cells 0.5 min after the addition of LPA (Fig.2 A). To investigate whether Ras is involved in the LPA-induced shedding, we examined the effects of the dominant-negative form of Ras. For this assay, Vero-H cells were transfected with plasmids encoding dnHa-Ras (N17Ha-Ras), and then LPA-induced shedding of pro HB-EGF was examined by measuring the immunoreactivity of the cell surface with respect to anti-HB-EGF antibody targeted to the ectodomain of pro HB-EGF. Fig. 2 Bshows examples where Vero-H cells expressing dnHa-Ras were visualized using anti-Ras antibody by indirect immunofluorescence (green). At the same time, the pro HB-EGF ectodomain was also visualized by anti-HB-EGF antibody (red). The results show that dnHa-Ras inhibited LPA-induced shedding (Fig. 2 B,panels c and d), indicating that Ras is involved in LPA-induced shedding. Mock transfection with plasmids encoding GFP did not inhibit the LPA-induced shedding (Fig. 2 B,panels a and b). Quantification of the pro HB-EGF-positive cells indicated that ∼90% of the cells expressing dnHa-Ras were pro HB-EGF-positive cells (Fig. 2 C). Ras-Raf-MEK is a well known cascade of Ras signaling. The effects of dnRaf-1 (NΔRaf-1) were also examined. Since dnRaf-1 could not be stained with anti-Raf antibody due to a lack of the epitope, cells expressing cotransfected GFP were considered as transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 2 (B, panels e and f; and C), dnRaf-1 inhibited LPA-induced shedding. In addition, the MEK inhibitor PD98059 strongly blocked LPA-induced shedding (see Fig. 6 A). Neither dnHa-Ras nor dnRaf-1 affected the expression of pro HB-EGF in unstimulated cells (Fig.2 C). In contrast to the transfection with the dominant-negative forms, overexpression of wtHa-Ras, the constitutively active form of Raf-1 (Raf BXB), or caMEK1 resulted in the shedding of pro HB-EGF in the absence of LPA (Fig. 2, D and E). Transfection of caHa-Ras (V12Ha-Ras) caused cell death, preventing reliable results from being obtained. Cotransfection with a combination of wtHa-Ras and dnRaf-1 resulted in the inhibition of wtHa-Ras-induced pro HB-EGF shedding, whereas dnHa-Ras did not inhibit caRaf-1-induced shedding. Similarly, dnRaf-1 did not inhibit caMEK1-induced shedding. It is also well known that LPA activates the Rho family of small GTPases (39Kjoller L. Hall A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 166-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). C3 exoenzyme from Clostridium botulinum specifically inactivates Rho, but does not inactivate Rac and Cdc42, members of the Rho family of small GTPases (40Ohashi Y. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1430-1433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Ogorochi T. Nemoto Y. Nakajima M. Nakamura E. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 1175-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although the C3 enzyme inhibited actin stress fiber formation in Vero-H cells under the conditions examined here (data not shown), it did not inhibit LPA-induced shedding of pro HB-EGF (Fig. 3 A). However, toxin B from C. difficile, known to inactivate Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 (42Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar), prevented LPA-induced shedding of pro HB-EGF (Fig.3 A). Consistent with the results obtained with the toxin B, CNF2 from a uropathogenic strain of Escherichia coli, known as an activator of Rho and Rac (43Sugai M. Hatazaki K. Mogami A. Ohta H. Peres S.Y. Herault F. Horiguchi Y. Masuda M. Ueno Y. Komatsuzawa H. Suginaka H. Oswald E. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6550-6557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), stimulated the shedding of pro HB-EGF in the absence of LPA (Fig. 3 B). To obtain direct proof of the involvement of Rac in LPA-induced shedding, we examined the effects of overexpression of dnRhoA, dnRac1, and dnCdc42 on LPA-induced shedding. For this assay, Vero-H cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged N19RhoA, N17Rac1, or N17Cdc42. The expression of these dominant-negative forms in Vero-H cells was visualized using anti-FLAG antibody (M2) by indirect immunofluorescence (green) (Fig. 4 A). The pro HB-EGF ectodomain was stained by anti-HB-EGF antibody (red). The results indicate that dnRac1 inhibited LPA-induced shedding (Fig. 4 A, panels c andd). dnRhoA and dnCdc42, however, did not inhibit LPA-induced shedding (Fig. 4 A, panels a and b andpanels e and f, respectively). Quantification of the pro HB-EGF-positive cells indicated that almost all of the cells expressing dnRac1 were pro HB-EGF-positive cells (Fig. 4 B). Fig. 4 B also shows the effects of these dominant-negative forms in the absence of LPA. Although neither dnRac1 nor dnCdc42 affected the expression of pro HB-EGF, transfection of dnRhoA resulted in partial shedding without LPA. Similar effects of dnRhoA were reported recently in the shedding of CD44 (44Kawano Y. Okamoto I. Murakami D. Itoh H. Yoshida M. Ueda S. Saya H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29628-29635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The effects of caRhoA, caRac1, and caCdc42 were also studied by transfection with hemagglutinin-tagged V14RhoA, V12Rac1, and V12Cdc42, respectively. Both caRac1 and caCdc42 stimulated shedding of pro HB-EGF in the absence of LPA, but caRhoA did not (Fig. 4, C,panels a–f, and D). dnCdc42 did not inhibit LPA-induced shedding, whereas caCdc42 stimulated shedding without LPA. To clarify whether Cdc42 is related to the Rac1-mediated pathway of pro HB-EGF shedding, cotransfection with a combination of dnRac1 and caCdc42 or of dnCdc42 and caRac1 was performed. dnRac1 inhibited caCdc42-induced shedding of pro HB-EGF, but dnCdc42 did not inhibit caRac1-induced shedding (Fig. 4, C, panels g–j; and D), suggesting that Cdc42 is involved upstream of Rac, but is not directly involved in LPA receptor (LPAR)-mediated ectodomain shedding of pro HB-EGF in Vero-H cells. Rho is activated downstream of the LPAR-mediated signaling pathway in fibroblastic cells (39Kjoller L. Hall A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 166-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). However, the present results indicate that Rac, but not Rho, is involved in LPA-induced pro HB-EGF shedding. To obtain direct evidence for the activation of Rac by LPA treatment, a pull-down assay using GST-PAK fusion protein was performed. As shown in Fig. 4 E, upon stimulation of Vero-H cells with LPA, activated Rac was detected 2.5 min after stimulation, although the level of Rac activation by LPA seemed to be much lower than for Ras. To clarify the relationship between Ras-Raf-MEK signaling and Rac signaling, we performed cotransfections with a combination of wtRas and dnRac, caRaf and dnRac, caMEK and dnRac, caRac and dnRas, and caRac and dnRaf. Transfection with wtHa-Ras or caRaf-1 resulted in shedding as shown in Fig. 2, but the effect of these molecules was inhibited by cotransfection with dnRac1 (Fig.5). Although caMEK1 also induced shedding of pro HB-EGF, dnRac1 did not inhibit caMEK1-induced shedding. Conversely, the effect of caRac1 was inhibited by cotransfection with either dnHa-Ras or dnRaf-1. PD98059 also inhibited caRac1-induced shedding. These results indicate that the Ras-Raf signal and Rac are synergistically required for the shedding of pro HB-EGF upon LPA stimulation. Since caMEK1-induced shedding was not inhibited by dnRac1, MEK activation is critical for the shedding. We have previously shown that PKCδ and MDC9 are involved in TPA-induced shedding of pro HB-EGF (21Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Ohno S. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). To compare the signaling cascades of LPA- and TPA-induced shedding, the effects of various inhibitors on the shedding of pro HB-EGF were studied (Fig.6 A). The PKC inhibitor Ro31-8220 (10 µm) strongly inhibited TPA-induced shedding, but weakly inhibited LPA-induced shedding. Conversely, the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (30 µm) strongly blocked LPA-induced shedding, as mentioned above, but not TPA-induced shedding. Wortmannin (100 nm), a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, did not inhibit either TPA- or LPA-induced shedding. These results suggest that LPA- and TPA-induced shedding is regulated by different signaling pathways. KB-R8301 completely inhibited both TPA- and LPA-induced pro HB-EGF shedding, consistent with the results shown in Fig. 1, indicating that a metalloprotease is involved in both TPA- and LPA-induced shedding of pro HB-EGF. Next, we examined whether PKCδ and MDC9 were involved in LPA-induced shedding of pro HB-EGF and whether Rac and Ras were involved in TPA-induced shedding. Although both dnPKCδ and dnMDC9 blocked TPA-induced shedding of pro HB-EGF as described previously (21Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Ohno S. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), neither dnRac1 (Fig. 6 B) nor dnHa-Ras (data not shown) did. On the other hand, LPA-induced shedding of pro HB-EGF was blocked by dnRac1, but not by dnPKCδ or dnMDC9 (Fig. 6 B). These results indicate that the LPA-induced shedding pathway of pro HB-EGF is distinct from the TPA-induced shedding pathway in Vero-H cells. We have investigated the LPA-induced shedding pathway. Fig.7 depicts a proposed model for the pathways of LPA- and TPA-induced shedding of pro HB-EGF in Vero-H cells. As supported by the expression of LPARs in Vero-H cells and the inhibitory effect of suramin (24Hirata M. Umata T. Takahashi T. Ohnuma M. Miura Y. Mekada E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 915-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the LPA signal would be mediated by LPARs (of the G protein-coupled seven-transmembrane protein family), followed by the activation of some G proteins in the heterotrimeric G protein family (29Moolenaar W.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 45Luttrell L.M. Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4637-4644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Pertussis toxin (PTX) did not inhibit LPA-induced pro HB-EGF shedding (see Fig. 3 A), suggesting that PTX-insensitive G proteins are involved in LPA-induced shedding of pro HB-EGF in Vero-H cells. Consistently, LPA-induced PTX-insensitive transactivation was observed previously (46Daub H. Wallasch C. Lankenau A. Herrlich A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). It was reported that GPCR signals can result in the activation of the small G protein Ras (38Luttrell L.M. Hawes B.E. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lansing T.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19443-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Pull-down assays confirmed that LPA induces Ras activation in Vero-H cells. Using the transfection of mutant forms of Ha-Ras or Raf-1, we demonstrate here that Ras and Raf, situated downstream, are involved in LPA-induced shedding. MEK, a well known downstream participant in the Ras-Raf cascade, is also involved in LPA-induced shedding, as was demonstrated by the experiments using caMEK1 and the MEK inhibitor PD98059. In addition to the Ras-Raf-MEK cascade, Rac also contributes to LPA-induced shedding, as it was shown by using inhibitors and a stimulator of the Rho family of GTPases or by transfection with dominant-negative and constitutively active mutants of Rac1. A requirement of both Rac and Ras for the proliferative effects of GPCRs was reported (47Burstein E.S. Hesterberg D.J. Gutkind J.S. Brann M.R. Currier E.A. Messier T.L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1617-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), consistent with the present results. We show here that dnRac1 inhibited the effects of both wtHa-Ras and caRaf-1, whereas both dnHa-Ras and dnRaf-1 inhibited caRac1-induced shedding. However, dnRac1 did not suppress the action of caMEK1. These results suggest that activation of MEK is critical for the shedding of pro HB-EGF and that the Ras-Raf signal and Rac are synergistically required to promote MEK activation, as has been indicated previously (48Bar-Sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). MEK activates ERK, a member of the MAPK family. We actually observed that ERK activation occurs in Vero-H cells upon LPA stimulation. Therefore, although neither dnERK nor caERK is available, ERK is also postulated to contribute to LPA-induced shedding downstream of MEK. This study also reveals that the signaling pathway of LPA-induced shedding is distinct from that of TPA-induced shedding. Following from our previous work, where we showed that TPA-induced pro HB-EGF shedding in Vero-H cells is mediated by PKCδ and MDC9 (21Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Ohno S. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), we demonstrate here that LPA-induced shedding was not inhibited by dnPKCδ or dnMDC9, whereas TPA-induced shedding was not inhibited by dnRas, dnRac1, or PD98059. This indicates the different requirements of the signaling molecules of TPA- and LPA-induced shedding. Therefore, we propose that a dual signaling pathway leads to the shedding of pro HB-EGF in Vero-H cells (Fig. 7). Owing to its biological importance, ectodomain shedding of pro HB-EGF is possibly regulated by multiple signaling mechanisms. In this regard, identification of the physiological stimulus that activates the TPA-induced pathway would be important in clarifying how the two pathways are used. This study reveals that GPCR-triggered shedding of pro-HB-EGF is mediated also by the MAPK cascade, as has been previously observed for receptor tyrosine kinase/TPA-induced shedding (49Fan H. Derynck R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6962-6972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Gechtman Z. Alonso J.I. Raab G. Ingber D.E. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28828-28835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Receptor tyrosine kinase activation causes stimulation of the MAPK cascade; thus, ligands for receptor tyrosine kinases could also induce the ectodomain shedding of pro HB-EGF in a PKCδ- and MDC9-independent manner. Actually, we observed that EGF, sHB-EGF, and platelet-derived growth factor weakly induced shedding of pro HB-EGF in Vero-H cells, although the effects were much lower than with LPA (data not shown). EGFR is down-regulated in Vero-H cells, and therefore, EGF ligands may not efficiently induce the ectodomain shedding of pro HB-EGF. In Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO), TPA-induced shedding of pro HB-EGF is inhibited by PD98059 (50Gechtman Z. Alonso J.I. Raab G. Ingber D.E. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28828-28835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), suggesting that MEK is implicated in TPA-induced cleavage. However, as shown in this study, TPA-induced shedding of pro HB-EGF in Vero-H cells was not inhibited by PD98059. The discrepancy between the results with CHO cells and Vero-H cells can be explained: in the case of Vero-H cells, PKCδ (among other PKC isotypes) is involved in TPA-induced shedding, whereas in CHO cells, PKCδ does not seem to be involved in TPA-induced shedding because caPKCδ does not induce pro HB-EGF shedding. 2T. Umata, M. Hirata, and E. Mekada, unpublished data. Thus, other isotypes of PKC could be activated by TPA and be involved in TPA-induced shedding in CHO cells. Possibly, the TPA-activated PKC isotype is located upstream of the MEK-mediated shedding pathway in CHO cells, and therefore, the MEK inhibitor blocked the TPA-induced shedding. Transactivation of EGFR by GPCR ligands is critical for the mitogenic activity of ligands such as LPA, endothelin, carbachol, thrombin, and angiotensin II (45Luttrell L.M.

Owada K.M. Hirata Y. Marumo F. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8890-8896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed that ectodomain shedding of pro HB-EGF contributes to the transactivation of EGFR by LPA and other GPCR ligands (23Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). HB-EGF is the only growth factor mediating EGFR transactivation in COS-7 and HEK293 cells when these cell lines are stimulated with LPA or endothelin, suggesting an essential role of HB-EGF among EGFR ligands for transactivation of EGFR. Moreover, not only GPCR ligands, but also insulin-like growth factor-1, which binds to and mediates signals through the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, induces HB-EGF-mediated transactivation (26Roudabush F.L. Pierce K.L. Maudsley S. Khan K.D. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22583-22589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), raising a possibility of the common role of HB-EGF in EGFR transactivation. We demonstrate here that MEK activation is critical for LPA-induced ectodomain shedding of pro HB-EGF. Therefore, not only GPCR ligands, but also other factors that activate MEK would have the ability to stimulate the shedding of pro HB-EGF, followed by EGFR transactivation. In fact, EGF and sHB-EGF induce the shedding of pro HB-EGF in Vero-H cells, as mentioned. It is postulated that shed sHB-EGF causes EGFR activation, which results in activation of the Ras-MEK-ERK pathway. Thus, the Ras-MEK-ERK pathway would be used twice in GPCR-induced transactivation events,i.e. for stimulation of pro HB-EGF shedding and as a consequence of EGFR activation by shed sHB-EGF. Regarding this context, EGFR and ectodomain shedding of pro HB-EGF may constitute a positive feedback loop for the Ras-MAPK signal. A previous report (36Foschi M. Chari S. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6439-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) may suggest the presence of such two-cycle signaling cascades in the transactivation events. GPCR-mediated ectodomain shedding and transactivation of EGFR would be a generally conserved mechanism, from insects to mammals, to efficiently regulate signal transduction through growth factors. SPITZS is the principal ligand of EGFR in embryonic and larval development ofDrosophila (8Wasserman J.D. Freeman M.

This protein, like transforming growth factor-α and HB-EGF, is synthesized as a transmembrane protein, but has no activity until the extracellular domain is proteolytically released from the cell surface. SPITZS processing is regulated by two other members of the spitzs group,rhomboid and star. RHOMBOID, a seven-transmembrane protein, is thought to regulate the cleavage of SPITZS and to be essential for the efficient activation of the receptor by SPITZS. Moreover, mutations in the genes spitzsand rhomboid cause similar pattern alterations in the development process of the Drosophila embryo. The similarity of the SPITZS-RHOMBOID system to the LPAR-HB-EGF system implies the existence of a common mechanism in the signaling pathway. We are grateful to K.

https://openalex.org/W2082955274,"In recent years, protein translocation has been implicated as the mechanism that controls assembly of signaling complexes and induction of signaling cascades. Several members of the multifunctional Ca2+- (Zn2+- and Cu2+)-binding S100 proteins appear to translocate upon cellular stimulation, and some are even secreted from cells, exerting extracellular functions. We transfected cells with S100B-green fluorescent fusion proteins and followed the relocation in real time. A small number of cells underwent translocation spontaneously. However, the addition of thapsigargin, which increases Ca2+ levels, intensified ongoing translocation and secretion or induced these processes in resting cells. On the other hand, EGTA or BAPTA (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid), the Ca2+-chelating agents, inhibited these processes. In contrast, relocation of S100B seemed to be negatively dependent on Zn2+ levels. Treatment of cells with TPEN (N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine), a Zn2+-binding drug, resulted in a dramatic redistribution and translocation of S100B. Secretion of S100B, when measured by ELISA, was dependent on cell density. As cells reached confluence the secretion drastically declined. However, an increase in Ca2+ levels, and even more so, a decrease in Zn2+ concentration, reactivated secretion of S100B. On the other hand, secretion did not decrease by treatment with brefeldin A, supporting the view that this process is independent of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi classical secretion pathway.

Intracellularly, S100B regulates the cytoskeletal dynamics through disassembly of tubulin filaments and binding to fibrillary proteins such as CapZ (1Kligman D. Marshak D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7136-7139Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 2Van Eldik L.J. Christie-Pope B. Bolin L.M. Shooter E.M. Whetsell Jr., W.O.

Furthermore, S100B interacts in a Ca2+-dependent manner with the cytoplasmic domain of myelin-associated glycoprotein and inhibits its phosphorylation by protein kinase A (5Kursula P. Lehto V.P. Heape A.M. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 76: 407-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Similarly, interaction of S100B with p53 was shown to inhibit protein kinase C phosphorylation (6Delphin C. Ronjat M. Deloulme J.C. Garin G. Debussche L. Higashimoto Y. Sakaguchi K. Baudier J. J.

When secreted by astrocytes, in addition to an autocrine effect leading, for example, to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (8Goncalves D.S. Lenz G. Karl J. Goncalves C.A. Rodnight R. Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 807-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), S100B can have a paracrine effect on neurons, promoting their survival during development and after injury through the NF-κB pathway, as well as through neurite outgrowth (1Kligman D. Marshak D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7136-7139Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar,9Winningham-Major F. Staecker J.L. Barger S.W. Coats S. Van Eldik L.J. J.

However, the extracellular concentration of S100B plays a crucial role in the physiological response. Although nanomolar quantities have trophic effects on cells, high levels of this protein have been implicated in glial activation (a prominent feature in Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease), up-regulation of nitric-oxide synthase, and apoptosis (11Huttunen H.J.

Recently, Schmidt and colleagues (14Hofmann M.A. Drury S. Fu C. Qu W. Taguchi A. Lu Y. Avila C. Kambham N. Bierhaus A. Nawroth P. Neurath M.F. Slattery T. Beach D. McClary J. Nagashima M. Morser J.

Others also demonstrated that the binding of extracellular S100B to RAGE promotes cell survival by induction of NF-κB and Bcl-2 (11Huttunen H.J. Kuja-Panula J. Sorci G. Agneletti A.L. Donato R. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40096-40105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the antioxidant-dependent apoptosis induced by high levels of S100B requires expression of the full-length receptor. In fact, the deletion mutant of RAGE was unable to transduce trophic or toxic stimuli of S100B. This indicates that extracellular S100B can induce cell survival or apoptosis only when the functional receptor is expressed on the cell surface. However, the mechanisms of regulation of S100B secretion still remain unclear. In resting cells, S100 proteins are localized in specific cellular compartments from which they relocate upon Ca2+ activation (16Mandinova A. Atar D. Schäfer B.W. Spiess M. Aebi U. Heizmann C.W. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2043-2054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Mueller A. Bachi T. Hochli M. Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Histochem.

Acta. 2000; 1498: 220-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This suggests that translocation might be a temporal and spatial determinant of their interactions with different partner proteins. Most of the S100B cascades, whether induced through interaction with intracellular partners or binding to extracellular receptor domains, are most likely preceded by translocation and/or secretion of S100B. Therefore, we investigated factors that might regulate these mechanisms. Because S100B binds Ca2+ and Zn2+ (19Heizmann C.W. Cox J.A. Biometals. 1998; 11: 383-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 20Barber K.R. McClintock K.A. Jamieson Jr., G.A. Dimlich R.V. Shaw G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1502-1508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) we focused on the effects of intracellular Ca2+/Zn2+ concentration on translocation/secretion. Astrocytes (glial cells), which secrete S100B, have evolved a complex machinery that enables them to change intracellular calcium concentration. They sense and respond to external signals produced by neurons and communicate with each other through calcium waves (21Giaume C. Venance L. Glia. 1998; 24: 50-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Xiong et al. (22Xiong Z. O'Hanlon D. Becker L.E. Roder J. MacDonald J.F. Marks A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 257: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) used glial cells derived from S100B null mice and demonstrated that S100B modulates Ca2+ homeostasis in these cells, confirming the earlier results of Barger and Van Eldik (23Barger S.W. Van Eldik L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9689-9694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who showed that S100B stimulates calcium fluxes in glial and neuronal cells. Therefore, we selected two human glioblastoma cell lines, one expressing and the other not expressing endogenous S100B, to examine the translocation/secretion pathway using S100B-green fluorescent protein (GFP).1 To fuse S100B to GFP (enhanced form, modified for brighter fluorescence,CLONTECH), we designed primers, including a linker of 5 glycines, 20 bases of the S100B-coding sequence, and restriction sites compatible with the GFP-containing vectors (XhoI/BamHI for pEGFP-N1 orBglII/SalI for pEGFP-C1) followed by three additional bases. The primers were incorporated into the S100B sequence by polymerase chain reaction. Oligonucleotides used for construction of pEGFP-N1 were 5′-TAACTCGAGATGTCTGAG CTGGAGAAGGC-3′ and 5′-ATTACCTAGGGC(CCA)5GAGTACAAGTTTCTTGAGCA; of pEGFP-C1, 5′-AATAGATCT(GGT)5TCTGAGCTGGAGAAGGCCAt-3′ and 5′-ATTCAGCTGAGTGAGTACAAGTTTTCTTGA. The polymerase chain reaction conditions were as follows: pEGFP-N1, 58 °C, 30 cycles; pEGFP-C1, 56 °C, 30 cycles. The resulting products were digested, purified, and ligated in the correct reading frame to the corresponding vectors. All constructs were verified by restriction digestion and DNA sequencing. The human glioblastoma cell lines U-373MG and U-87MG (HTB-17 and HTB-14, respectively, available from ATCC) were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBC and penicillin-streptomycin. GFP constructs were transfected using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were seeded at 2–2.5 × 105 cells/35-mm dish, plated, and incubated overnight. Plasmid DNA (1 µg) in DMEM (100 µl total volume) and LipofectAMINE (5 µl) reagent in DMEM (95 µl) were combined and incubated for 15–30 min before being diluted to 1 ml with DMEM and added to the cells. After incubating for 5 h, a solution of 10% fetal bovine serum in DMEM was added to the cells and incubated overnight. The following day, the transfection medium was removed and fresh medium was added. Stable transfectants were selected and maintained in medium containing G418. To examine localization and translocation of endogenous S100B and recombinant fusion proteins by confocal microscopy, 2–5 × 104 cells were plated on coverslips in 24-well dishes 24 h prior to the experiment. Cells were rinsed with DMEM and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with TPEN (Sigma, 5 µm) or thapsigargin (Sigma, 100 nm-1 µm) (24Thastrup O. Cullen P.J. Drobak B.K. Hanley M.R. Dawson A.P. Proc. Natl.

For treatment with thapsigargin, cells were incubated in a stimulation buffer (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mmHEPES supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 or 10 mm EGTA). The viability of cells was assessed after prolonged treatment with thapsigargin, TPEN, or EGTA (2.5 × 105). The cells were seeded in 35-mm dishes (in triplicates), incubated with drugs for up to 90 min, trypsinized, stained with trypan blue, and counted. To observe the translocation of S100B in live cells, 5–10 × 105 cells expressing fusion proteins were seeded in 35-mm glass-bottom dishes (Matek) and treated with different drugs on the microscope stage in a temperature-controlled CO2 chamber. The time course for S100B translocation after thapsigargin (100 nm-1 µm) treatment was monitored by microscope time lapse photography. The effects of Ca2+ and Zn2+ on translocation were monitored by incubating the cells with Ca2+-chelators such as 10 mm EGTA or membrane-permeable 100 µm BAPTA-AM (Molecular Probes (27Zhang Z.

Cells were treated with 0.5–5 µg/ml brefeldin A, which reversibly blocks the ER-Golgi-dependent pathway (Calbiochem (29Rammes A. Roth J. Goebeler M. Klempt M. Hartmann M. Sorg C. J. Biol.

Nature. 1985; 317: 648-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar)), respectively. For ELISAs, a medium (1 ml) from each sample was collected, and the cells were extracted in 1 ml of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, supplemented with protease inhibitors: 10 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml aprotinin). S100B was quantified by ELISA using an immunoradiometric assay (Sangtec) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The amount of S100B in the sample was calculated using a standard curve with known concentrations of human recombinant S100B. To assess potential apoptotic effects, cells were resuspended in 75 µl of cell extraction buffer (50 mm Pipes, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 µg/ml CLAP (chymostatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin A, 10 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride)) and then frozen and thawed twice. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g, 4 °C for 15 min, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and the protein concentration was determined by the Coomassie Blue assay. Protein extracts from each sample were diluted to a final concentration of 40 µg/100 µl. Then, 100 µl-aliquots from each sample were added to two wells of a 96-well plate. One of the wells was left untreated, while the other was treated with 10 µm DEVD-Chinese hamster ovary inhibitor (Sigma) at 37 °C for 30 min. Then 10 µl of 0.8 mmDEVD-pNa substrate was added to each well, and the plate was analyzed after 2, 6, and 24 h at 405 nm. As a positive control, cells were treated with 100 nm staurosporine. Cell proteins (5–6 µg/ml) were extracted in 1 ml of buffer B (see above) and immunoprecipitated with 20 µl of rabbit anti-human recombinant S100B (F 3802) (33Ilg E.C. Schäfer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 68: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) bound to 15 mg of protein A-Sepharose. The samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After blotting onto nitrocellulose membranes and blocking in nonfat milk (5% in washing buffer: 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100), membranes were incubated with anti-S100B serum (dilution, 1:1500), washed for 30 min, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit serum (dilution 1:500, Bio-Rad). Visualization of immunoreactive proteins was achieved by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were rinsed with DMEM, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in DMEM for 15 min at 37 °C, and permeabilized with methanol for 10 min at room temperature. After washing in 5% horse serum-DMEM, the cells were incubated with anti-S100B (dilution 1:500) for 1 h at 37 °C followed by staining with Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (goat, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 45 min at 37 °C. As a control, cells were incubated with the antibodies preabsorbed with human S100B antigen (1 µg/1 µl). The cells to be stained with the monoclonal Cy3-conjugated anti-actin (mouse IgG2a isotype; Sigma) or anti-β-tubulin (mouse IgG1 isotype; Sigma) were fixed with formaldehyde (3.7% in PBS with Ca2+/Mg2+) at room temperature for 20–30 min, washed twice with PBS, treated with NH4Cl (50 mm in PBS), washed with PBS, and permeabilized with Triton X-100 (0.1% in PBS) as described (34Zhu X. Roovers K. Davey G. Assoian R.K. Guan J.-L. Signaling through Cell Adhesion Molecules. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1999: 129-140Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with antibodies against actin (dilution 1:50) or tubulin (dilution 1:100) for 30 min and washed four times with PBS and once with water. To mount the slides, a small drop of mounting media (Molwiol, Hoechst) containing 0.75% n-propyl gallate as an anti-bleaching agent, was placed on the slide. Mounted slides were left to dry for 24 h at room temperature and stored in the dark at 4 °C until viewed. Fixed cells were analyzed using a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope (under a 63×-oil objective lens) equipped with a confocal scanning unit MRC-600 (Bio-Rad) and an argon-krypton laser with an excitation wavelength of 568 nm for Cy3 and 488 nm for enhanced GFP. Subsequently, the images were processed using Graphic Converter (version 3.8) and Photoshop (Adobe System, version 5.5) software on a Macintosh computer. Live cells were analyzed by time lapse photography after plating in 35-mm glass bottom dishes (Matek), using a wide-field Leica DM IRBE microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu camera controller (C4742–95) and connected to a Macintosh computer. The imaging and recording was operated by Open Lab software, version 2.1.1. The 25–50 images (depending on the rapidity of the cellular response) were recorded, one every 4 s, with each exposure set at 50–300 ms (depending on the intensity of the signal, but constant in each series) using a set filter for GFP (Leica), and neutral density filters to minimize bleaching. The images obtained were processed using Photoshop (Adobe System, version 5.5) or converted into quick-time files using a public domain NIH Image program (developed at the National Institutes of Health, rsb.info.nih.gov/nih.-image/). Before examining the localization, mechanisms of translocation, and secretion of S100B, we assessed the endogenous levels of S100B in two glioblastoma cell lines, U373 and U87, both described to be similar to primary astrocytic tumors (35Kiss R. Camby I. Salmon I. Van Ham P. Brotchi J. Pasteels J.L. Cytometry. 1995; 20: 118-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 36Camby I. Salmon I. Oiry C. Galleyrand J.C. Nagy N. Danguy A.

Proteins in cellular extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-human S100B and analyzed by Western blotting (Fig.1 a) and ELISA (Fig.1 b). In U373 cells, endogenous S100B levels are highest at confluence (∼5 ng/100,000 cells), whereas in U87 cells they are undetectable. Next we prepared S100B-GFP fusion proteins connected by a 5 glycine-linker, allowing for rotational freedom between the S100B protein and GFP. S100B fused to the N terminus of GFP (through ligation to pEGFP-N1, Fig. 2 a) was named GnB, and that fused to the C terminus of GFP (through ligation to pEGFP-C1, Fig. 2 b) was named GcB. To examine the localization of GnB and GcB in comparison to the endogenous S100B, U373 (Fig. 3 a) and U87 (Fig.3 b) cells were either stained with anti-S100B and examined by indirect immunofluorescence or U87 cells were transfected with either construct (named GnB-U87 or GcB-U87) and directly analyzed (3c-d).Figure 2Construction of S100B-GFP vectors. S100B cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using specific primers/adaptors and then ligated into the corresponding vector.a, S100B was fused to the N terminus of GFP (GnB), and thus its stop codon was eliminated and a 5-glycine linker was added at the 3′-end. b, S100B was fused to the C terminus of the GFP (GcB), and thus its start codon was removed and the 5-glycine linker was added at the 5′-end.

All samples were analyzed by laser-scanning confocal microscopy (scale bar,15 µm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The localization of the fusion proteins in U87 cells was comparable with that of endogenous S100B in U373. Some of the differences might be because of the variation between the appearance of GFP fluorescence, as opposed to the immuno staining, which might yield a more punctate pattern. Nonetheless, the endogenous and the fusion proteins were both absent from the nucleus, as assessed by confocal microscopy, in contrast to S100A11, which was found in the nucleus (18Davey G.E. Murmann P. Hoechli M. Tanaka T. Heizmann C.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1498: 220-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and they were both predominantly localized to the perinuclear area. However, the staining of the S100B-GFP extended further into the cytoplasm, potentially caused by slightly higher concentration of the fusion protein in the cell. Similar results were obtained with transient and stable transfectants. To determine the effects of intracellular Ca2+/Zn2+ levels on the localization of endogenous S100B, we either left U373 cells untreated (Fig.4 a) or we treated them for 10 min with thapsigargin (data not shown) or TPEN (5 µm, Fig. 4 b) and compared the localization of S100B by indirect immunofluorescence. Similarly, we analyzed untreated (Fig.4 c) and TPEN-treated GcB-U87 cells (Fig. 4 d). In both cell types we observed vesicle-like structures located toward the periphery of the cell, indicating that both the endogenous protein and the S100B-GFP fusion protein behave similarly and translocate in response to increasing Ca2+ or decreasing Zn2+concentration. To study these processes in real time, U87-GnB or U87-GcB cells were studied by wide-field microscopy, using either transiently or stably transfected cells. Initial observation revealed that a small number of the S100B-GFP-positive cells were undergoing spontaneous translocation. The S100B seemed to be moving toward the newly formed cytoplasmic extensions. These extensions were dynamically forming and disappearing, however, they were not always occupied by S100B when observed under phase-contrast. Although these glioblastoma cell lines are in general quite motile (35Kiss R. Camby I. Salmon I. Van Ham P. Brotchi J. Pasteels J.L.

Translocation would subside in one cell (Fig. 5 a) and begin in another in 10–20% of cells in the population at any time point. Addition of 0.5 µm thapsigargin (Fig. 5 b) caused relocation of S100B in 70–80% of the cells within 1–2 min, supporting the idea that this process depends on calcium fluxes that normally occur in glial cells and can be intensified by a sudden increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration through drug stimulation. These results did not depend on the expression levels of S100B-GFP. The experiments were repeated with different stable and transient transfectants that display a wide range of expression levels of S100B-GFP, yielding the same results. As a control, cells undergoing S100B translocation were treated with 10 mm EGTA (Fig. 6,a–c) or 100 µm BAPTA-AM (data not shown) to chelate endogenous Ca2+, resulting in an inhibition of the translocation process within 2–5 min. Similarly, pretreatment of unstimulated cells with either Ca2+-chelator blocked or significantly reduced the response of cells to thapsigargin. In fact, the vesicles would get smaller as they were moving about in the cell, to the point when they were no longer detectable. The cell membrane retracted only after prolonged incubation with EGTA, which removes Ca2+ from the interactions between integrins and extracellular matrix, resulting in a slow cell detachment. However, when EGTA-containing medium was replaced by normal medium, cells fully reattached and resumed the basal level of translocation (data not shown). Therefore, induction and inhibition of S100B translocation are both Ca2+-dependent and reversible. On the other hand, chelating endogenous Zn2+ by addition of 5–10 µm TPEN (a membrane-permeant Zn2+-chelator) produced a result opposite to that of Ca2+ removal by EGTA/BAPTA-AM. Within seconds after treatment, a dramatic change in fluorescence intensity of S100B-GFP occurred (Fig. 6 e), followed by an onset of translocation (Fig. 6 f). If TPEN was removed by incubation in fresh media, cells would return to normal conditions. Viability of cells after 0, 15, 45, and 90 min of treatment with 1 µm thapsigargin, 20 µm TPEN, or 10 mm EGTA was assessed by staining triplicate samples with trypan blue, showing no increase in cell death even when drug concentration and exposure time were higher than those used in the time lapse experiments. We also analyzed and compared relocation of S100B-GFP between the two cell lines, showing that the translocation of the fusion proteins is unaffected by the presence or absence of endogenous S100B. Here, we present analysis mostly done in the U87 cells, which do not express endogenous S100B. To determine whether S100B translocation upon [Ca2+] increase depends on the ER-Golgi pathway, U87 cells expressing fusion proteins were seeded onto glass-bottom plates, incubated with 5 µg/ml of brefeldin A (29Rammes A.

We have analyzed caspase-2 processing in human cell lines containing defined mutations in caspase-3 and caspase-9.

Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6159) Google Scholar). In normal cells, caspases are present as zymogens that are cleaved at aspartic sites during cell death. Enzyme processing generates the active form, which is constituted by a heterodimer consisting of two small and a two large subunits (2Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4132) Google Scholar). Caspases involved in the apoptotic process can be divided into initiator caspases and effector caspases based on the presence of a large prodomain at their amino terminus region. In general, effector caspases possess short prodomains and are cleaved by initiator caspases, which possess large prodomains. Effector caspases are involved in the cleavage of the death substrates, thus modulating the morphological changes characterizing the apoptotic process (3Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar). The long prodomains of the initiator caspases function in inducing dimerization and activation of the proenzymes through interaction with specific adaptor molecules. Caspase-2, caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-10 are the long prodomain caspases involved in the apoptotic process (4Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2451) Google Scholar). The generation of caspase-deficient mice for initiator caspases has indicated that these enzymes regulate cell death in a tissue- and stimulus-specific fashion (4Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2451) Google Scholar). In particular, caspase-9 is the critical player of the apoptotic stimuli acting through mitochondrial dysfunction (5Kuida K. Haydar T.F. Kuan C.Y. Gu Y. Taya C. Karasuyama H. Su M.S. Rakic P.

Additional studies have shown that this initiator caspase is essential for specific apoptotic pathways such as β-amyloid-induced neuron death and salmonella-induced macrophage death (9Troy C.M.

The identification of RAIDD/CRADD as an adaptor protein for caspase-2 has suggested that caspase-2 could be involved also in apoptosis triggered by TNF-α. Recruitment of caspase-2 to the TNF-α receptor is regulated by the interaction between the CARD domain present in the prodomain of caspase-2 and a similar CARD domain present in RAIDD/CRADD (11Ahmad M. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Talanian R.V. Litwack G. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Cancer Res. 1997; 4: 615-619Google Scholar, 12Duan H. Dixit V.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Different apoptotic insults can cause caspase-2 processing, which generally occurs by two proteolytic steps. A first cleavage at aspartic 316 generates two fragments: one of 32–33 kDa containing the prodomain and the large subunit and a second fragment of 14 kDa containing the small subunit. Subsequent cleavages at Asp152 and Asp330 lead to the formation of the large and the small subunits of 18 and 12 kDa, respectively. The appearance of the 32–33-kDa fragment has been generally used as marker of caspase-2 activation (13Li H. Bergeron L. Cryns V. Pasternack M.S. Zhu H. Shi L. Greenberg A. Yuan J. J. Biol.

Despite significant evidence for an involvement of caspase-2 in different apoptotic pathways, its specific role is not completely understood. Only recently, a caspase-2 substrate has been identified in golgin-160, thus suggesting that caspase-2 could act as an executioner caspase involved in modulating Golgi integrity (16Mancini M. Machamer C.E. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have attempted to further analyze caspase-2 activity and its hierarchy with respect to the common apoptotic pathways. We have used human cell lines containing defined mutations in caspase-9 and caspase-3 to unveil the relationships between the mitochondrial pathway and caspase-2 proteolytic processing in response to different apoptotic triggers. In addition, we have analyzed the ability of caspase-2 to induce cell death in cells defective in caspase-9 activity. Rabbits were immunized with His-tagged caspase-2 fragment (residues 15–436) purified from Escherichia coli transformed with the construct pQE32-caspase-2. Briefly, after induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, bacteria where collected by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 5 min and lysed in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After sonication, the insoluble fraction was resuspended in sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 120 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.005% bromphenol blue, 1% β-mercaptoethanol) and then run on an SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 to identify the caspase-2 band, which was then electroeluted. The protein was dialyzed overnight in PBS and purified by nickel chromatography using a His-trap column (Qiagen), eluted with an imidazole buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole), and then used to immunize rabbits. Purified recombinant caspase-2 was cross-linked to an Affi-Prep 10 column (Bio-Rad) and used to affinity-purify antibody to caspase-2 from rabbit antiserum. The serum was loaded onto the column at a slow flow rate, washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and then washed with a high salt buffer (500 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4). Caspase-2 antibodies were eluted using 10 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and neutralized with pH 7.5 with Tris-HCl. To generate pcDNA3HA caspase-2 C303G, the entire coding region of human caspase-2 was amplified from pGDSV7S caspase-2 by polymerase chain reaction. In vitro mutagenesis to substitute Cys303 with Gly was performed as previously described (17Brancolini C. Benedetti M. Schneider C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5179-5190Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The following set of primers was used: primer A (CATGAATTCATGGCCGCTGACAGGGGACGC), primer B (ATCCAGGCCGGCCGTGGAGAT), primer C (ATCTCCACGGCCGGCCTGGAT), and primer D (CATCTCGAGTCATGTGGGAGGGTGTCCTGG). Caspase-2 C303G cDNA was subcloned in pcDNA3HA asEcoRI/EcoRI and EcoRI/XhoI fragments. Caspase-2 C303G was subcloned from pcDNA3HA caspase-2 C303G as SphI/XhoI fragment in pQE32 to generate a His-tagged caspase-2 construct. To generate pEGFPN1Bid and pBSKBid, the entire coding region of human Bid was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from a human fetal cDNA library. The following set of primers was used: primer E (CATGAATTCTGATGGACTGTGAGGTCAACAAC) and primer F (CATGGATCCCGGTCCATCCCATTTCTGGCTAA). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Cells at 70–80% confluence were treated for 36 h with 1 μg/ml cycloheximide plus 20 ng/ml TNF-α or 10 ng/ml TNF-α (MCF-7pBC3 and MCF-7pBC3mut) or with 1 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) alone as a control. For UV treatment, culture medium was removed, dishes were washed once with PBS1 and UVC (180 J/m2)-irradiated, and fresh medium, containing 10% fetal calf serum, was added to the cells (17Brancolini C. Benedetti M. Schneider C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5179-5190Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested by scraping with a rubber policeman 15 or 18 h later. When required floating cells were collected separately from the adherent cells. After washes in PBS, cells were resuspended in SDS sample buffer sonicated boiled for 3 min and analyzed by Western blot. Transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Cell were seeded 24 h before transfection and analyzed 20 h after removal of the precipitates. Cells were transfected with 2 μg of each expression vector together with 200 ng of pEGFPN1 (Invitrogen) to identify transfected cells. Caspase-3 was expressed in bacteria and purified as previously described (18Sgorbissa A. Benetti R. Marzinotto S. Schneider C. Brancolini C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4475-4482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the pQE-12 expression system (Qiagen). Density scanning of the ∼20-kDa fragments of the autoprocessed caspases, as evidenced after electrophoretic separation and Coomassie Blue staining, was used to estimate the amount of active enzyme. Purified caspase-7 was obtained from Alexis, and caspase-2 was from Chemicom. The different caspases, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and Bid, were in vitro translated with 35S using the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). 1 μl of eachin vitro translated protein was incubated with increasing amounts of caspase-3 or caspase-7 in 15 μl of the appropriate buffer (final volume) for 1 h at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated by adding one volume of SDS gel loading buffer and boiling for 3 min. For Western blotting, proteins were transferred to 0.2-μm pore-sized nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) using a semidry blotting apparatus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (transfer buffer: 20% methanol, 48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, and 0.0375% SDS). After staining with Ponceau S, the nitrocellulose sheets were saturated for 1 h in Blotto-Tween 20 (17) (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 5% nonfat dry milk, and 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated overnight at room temperature with the specific antibody: anti-caspase-2, anti-actin, and anti-p85 PARP fragment (Promega). Blots were then rinsed three times with Blotto-Tween 20 and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Sigma) or goat anti-mouse (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then washed four times in Blotto-Tween 20, rinsed in phosphate buffer saline, and developed with Super Signal West Pico, as recommended by the vendor (Pierce). For indirect immunofluorescence assays, transfected cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Fixed cells were washed with PBS and 0.1 m glycine, pH 7.5, and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. The coverslips were treated with anti-cytochrome c (Promega) or with anti-cytochrome c oxidase, diluted in PBS for 1 h in a moist chamber at 37 °C. They were then washed with PBS twice, followed by incubation with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. Nuclei were evidenced by Hoechst staining. Cells were examined by epifluorescence with a Zeiss Axiovert 35 microscope or with a LEICA TCS laser scan microscope equipped with a 488 λ argon laser and a 543 λ helium neon laser. We produced an antibody against E. coli expressed caspase-2 fragment in order to study caspase-2 activation during cell death. The antiserum was purified on a caspase-2 affinity column and tested for caspase-2 detection by Western blot. 293 cells were transfected with HA-tagged catalytic inactive caspase-2 as positive control. Anti-caspase-2 antibody recognizes a single band migrating at around 48 kDa, showing a similar electrophoretic mobility to the band detected with the anti-HA antibody in caspase-2-transfected cells. The intensity of the band detected by the anti-caspase-2 antibody was dramatically increased in caspase-2-transfected cells (Fig.1 a). Caspase-2 processing during apoptosis can be followed by the appearance of different proteolytic fragments. A first cleavage at aspartic 316 generates two fragments: a first fragment of 32–33 kDa containing the prodomain and the large subunit and a second fragment of 14 kDa containing the small subunit. Subsequent cleavages at Asp152 and Asp330 generate the large and the small subunits of 18 and 12 kDa, respectively (13Li H. Bergeron L. Cryns V. Pasternack M.S. Zhu H. Shi L. Greenberg A. Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 34: 21010-21017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To confirm the specificity of the anti-caspase-2 antibody, we investigated caspase-2 processing by Western blot during apoptosis. MDA cells were UV-irradiated, and cellular lysates were prepared 24 h later. In UV-irradiated cells, a band migrating at ∼33 kDa was detected, the appearance of which parallels the rate of cell death in the culture as confirmed by β-catenin processing (19Brancolini C. Sgorbissa A. Schneider C. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 1042-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This band is similar in size to the previously identified intermediate processed form of caspase-2, p33. The small and large subunits of caspase-2 were detected only after long exposure of the blot (Fig. 1 b). In conclusion, this evidence indicates that the produced antibody specifically recognizes caspase-2 both in normal and apoptotic cells. We next investigated the appearance of the 33-kDa form of caspase-2 in different cell lines when apoptosis was induced by UV irradiation. As shown in Fig. 1 c, the processed form of caspase-2 was detected upon apoptosis induction in most of the cell lines tested, with the exception of the MCF-7 cells. The anti-caspase-2 antibody also showed cross-species reactivity, since it detected a band of 50 kDa in the cellular lysates of murine fibroblasts NIH 3T3 that is converted in a p33 form upon induction of apoptosis (data not shown). To study the hierarchy of caspase-2 processing in respect to different caspases during apoptosis in vivo, we decided to use cell lines containing defined mutations in specific caspases. We took advantage of the IMR90 cells transformed with E1A oncogene and containing a dominant negative form of caspase-9 (caspase-9 DN) (20Fearnhead H.O. Rodriguez J. Givek E-E. Guo W. Kobayashi R. Hannon G. Lazebnik Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13664-13669Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). As a control IMR90 fibroblasts expressing E1A alone were used. It has been previously demonstrated that IMR90-E1A cells expressing the caspase-9 DN do not show all of the “classical” apoptotic features when challenged by etoposide treatment, whereas in these cells cytochrome c release from mitochondria was reported as normal (20Fearnhead H.O. Rodriguez J. Givek E-E. Guo W. Kobayashi R. Hannon G. Lazebnik Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13664-13669Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We also used the human MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell line, which is devoid of caspase-3 due to the functional deletion of theCASP-3 gene (21Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1720) Google Scholar). This cell line was used to reintroduce wild type caspase-3 or its catalytic inactive point-mutated derivative caspase-3 (CI) as a control (22Faleiro L. Lazebnik Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We used FACS analysis to confirm that the different cell lines selected showed different susceptibility to enter cell death by apoptosis following UV irradiation. UV-irradiated IMR90-E1A cells underwent apoptosis as evidenced by cell morphology, chromatin condensation, and detachment from the adhesion substrate. Levels of apoptosis were assessed by FACS analysis using propidium iodide staining (Fig.2 a). Analysis of DNA content (Fig. 2) revealed a significant increase of cells with sub-G1 DNA content, indicative of apoptosis (19Brancolini C. Sgorbissa A. Schneider C. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 1042-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), when IMR90-E1A cells were UV-irradiated. On the contrary, IMR90-E1A cells containing caspase-9 DN were impaired in entering efficiently apoptosis following UV irradiation, as evidenced by FACS analysis. Indeed, in these cell lines, floating cell fragments could be detected upon UV irradiation (data not shown). Reintroduction of wild type caspase-3 in MCF-7 cells renders these cells susceptible to apoptosis following UV irradiation, whereas cells expressing a catalytic inactive form of caspase-3 were partially resistant to UV-dependent cell death (Fig. 2 b). Moreover, when MCF-7 caspase-3 CI cells were UV-irradiated, some cell debris was detected floating in the medium (data not shown). Having selected two human cell lines containing defined mutations in caspase-3 and caspase-9, we analyzed the relationships between caspase-2 processing and the above mentioned caspases by inducing cell death with two different stimuli: UV irradiation and TNF-α. As mentioned before, some dead cells floating in the medium were observed also in the case of UV-irradiated IMR90-E1A-caspase-9 DN that were resistant to apoptosis as judged by FACS analysis. These dead cells might be indicative of a necrotic or “frustrated apoptotic” response that occurs following extensive DNA damage and/or mitochondrial dysfunction. In our studies, we have focused our attention on the status of caspase-2 in the population of dead cells that can be isolated as nonadherent cells (Fig. 3, D) from the population of still viable cells (Fig. 3, V). It is important to note that the population of nonadherent cells was consistently reduced in cells expressing the catalytic inactive caspases (data not shown), but in our Western analysis the total amount of protein lysates loaded for each sample was normalized. In apoptotic IMR90-E1A cells, almost all caspase-2 was processed to the p33 form, as shown in Fig. 3 a, while in floating cells from IMR90-E1A-caspase-9 DN (D), caspase-2 processing was largely impaired. The same lysates were also analyzed for PARP processing by using an antibody specific for the cleaved form. Processing of PARP was observed in both cell lines although the presence of a dominant negative form of caspase-9 clearly reduced the amount of cleaved PARP detectable. Actin was used as loading control. We next analyzed the dependence of caspase-2 processing on caspase-9 in response to the activation of a different apoptotic pathway. IMR90-E1A and IMR90-E1A-caspase-9 DN were treated with TNF-α in the presence of cycloheximide, and Western blot analysis was performed using lysates prepared from TNF-α/CHX- and CHX-treated or untreated cells. Nonadherent dead cells (Fig. 3, D) and adherent viable cells (V) were harvested separately. In TNF-α-triggered cell death, despite of the presence of a dominant negative form of caspase-9, caspase-2 was normally processed, thus generating the p33 fragment (Fig. 3 b). PARP processing during apoptosis induced by TNF-α was independent from caspase-9 activity. Here again, detection of actin was used as a loading control. The previous experiment clearly shows that caspase-2 processing following UV irradiation is dependent on caspase-9. Since caspase-9 activates caspase-3 in response to DNA damage (20Fearnhead H.O.

A. 1998; 95: 13664-13669Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), we next analyzed if caspase-3 is critical for caspase-2 processing in vivo. Human MCF-7 cells were UV-irradiated, and 18 h later nonadherent dead cells (Fig. 3, D) and adherent viable (V) cells were harvested and combined, and lysates were prepared for Western analysis. As shown in Fig. 4 a, in UV-irradiated MCF-7 wild type caspase-3, a consistent fraction of caspase-2 could be detected as the p33-processed form, while in MCF-7 caspase-3 CI cells, caspase-2 processing was undetectable. Processing of PARP was reduced but still detectable in MCF-7 caspase-3 CI as described above in IMR90-E1A caspase-9 DN. We next analyzed the dependence of caspase-2 processing on caspase-3 under TNF-α-induced apoptosis. MCF-7 wild type caspase-3 and caspase-3 CI cells were treated with TNF-α in the presence of cycloheximide for 36 h, and Western blot analysis was performed. Nonadherent dead (Fig. 4, D) and adherent viable (V) cells were harvested separately. Caspase-2 was fully processed when apoptosis was induced in wild type caspase-3 MCF-7 cells treated with TNF-α and CHX. In apoptotic MCF-7 caspase-3 CI cells, caspase-2 processing was largely impaired. PARP was similarly processed in both cell lines, thus confirming the induction of cell death. Having demonstrated that caspase-3 is the critical enzyme for an efficient processing of caspase-2 in vivo, we wanted to analyze the ability of caspase-3 to cleave caspase-2 in vitro with respect to other long and short prodomain caspases involved in the apoptotic response. In vitro proteolytic assays using recombinant caspases-3 were performed. Full-length caspase-1, caspase-2, caspase-3, caspase-6, caspase-7 caspase-8, and caspase-9 cDNA were in vitrotranslated and then incubated with purified caspase-3 (Fig.5). Treatment with an increasing amount of purified caspase-3 for 30 min at 37 °C leads to the processing of all of the tested caspases with the exception of caspase-1. Among the different long prodomain caspases, some processing of caspase-2 to generate the p18/p12 active form was detectable after incubation with only 0.01 ng of caspase-3, while the full processing of the p48 form was detectable when 500 ng of caspase-3 were used. In contrast, caspase-9 and caspase-8 were weak substrates of caspase-3 and only partially processed after incubation with 10 ng of the recombinant caspase-3. Among the different short prodomain caspases analyzed, caspase-7 was the most efficiently cleaved by caspase-3, and partial processing was detectable after incubation with 10 ng of recombinant caspase-3. PARP, a well defined substrate of caspase-3 (4Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2451) Google Scholar, 23Nicholson D.W. Ambereen A.

Nature. 1995; 376: 37-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar), was used as a control under the same conditions. From this analysis, we can suggest that caspase-2, among the different caspases analyzed, is the best substrate for caspase-3. Residual caspase-2 processing was observed when apoptosis was induced by TNF-α in MCF-7 cells defective for caspase-3 activity. Since caspase-3 and caspase-7 show overlapping cleavage consensus sequences and share many death substrates in vivo(4Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2451) Google Scholar), we asked whether caspase-7 was able to cleave caspase-2 in anin vitro assay. In vitro translated caspase-2 was incubated with increasing amounts of purified caspase-7 for 60 min at 37 °C. As shown in Fig.6 a, 1 μg of caspase-7 was required for the full processing of caspase-2, while partial caspase-2 processing was observed after incubation with 10 ng of caspase-7. Under the same experimental conditions, full processing of PARP was observed after incubation with 10 ng of purified caspase-7. This analysis suggests that caspase-7 can cleave caspase-2 in vitro,although with a lower efficiency when compared with PARP. It is possible that caspase-7 is responsible for the limited proteolytic processing of caspase-2 during apoptosis in MCF-7 caspase-3 CI cells (25Germain M. Affar E.B. D'Amours D. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. Poirier G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28379-28384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed if caspase-7 was activated when these cells were treated with TNF-α/CHX. We have analyzed by Western blot caspase-7 expression, as shown in Fig.6 b, with an antibody that recognizes the caspase-7 proenzyme migrating at around 34 kDa. Disappearance of the 34-kDa band was considered as evidence for caspase-7 processing. Nonadherent apoptotic and adherent nonapoptotic cells were harvested separately. Caspase-7 was processed in MCF-7 wild type caspase-3 cells during apoptosis, and its processing was reduced but still detectable in apoptotic MCF-7 containing catalytic inactive caspase-3. The dependence of caspase-2 processing on caspase-3 argues that caspase-2 acts as an effector caspase and that its activation is a downstream event in the proteolytic cascade triggering cell death. On the other hand, caspase-2 possesses a prodomain, which is a marker for caspases acting at the apex of the proteolytic cascade, and its overexpression can trigger cell death by apoptosis, possibly as a consequence of caspase-2 activation following prodomain-mediated oligomerization (14Colussi P.A.

Cell. 1994; 78: 739-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). If caspase-2 induces apoptosis simply by acting as an effector caspase, its ability to induce cell death should be independent from mutations in the regulative caspases such as caspase-9. Therefore, we have investigated the ability of caspase-2 to efficiently induce cell death when overexpressed in cells impaired in caspase-9 activity. IMR90-E1A caspase-9 DN and IMR90-E1A were co-transfected with caspase-2 and GFP used as a reporter, and the appearance of apoptotic cells was scored 24 h after transfection. As shown in Fig. 7 a, the apoptotic response triggered by caspase-2 overexpression in IMR90-E1A caspase-9 DN was impaired"
https://openalex.org/W2081762967,"We have previously shown that mouse microglial cells undergo apoptosis upon inflammatory activation and that nitric oxide (NO) is the major autocrine mediator in this process (Lee, P., Lee, J., Kim, S., Yagita, H., Lee, M. S., Kim, S. Y., Kim, H., and Suk, K. (2001) Brain Res. 892, 380–385). Here, we present evidence that interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and caspase-11 are the essential molecules in activation-induced cell death of microglial cells. The apoptogenic action of inflammatory stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-γ (IFNγ) was mediated through the induction of IRF-1 and caspase-11 expression in two separate events. Although IRF-1 was required for NO synthesis, caspase-11 induction was necessary for NO-independent apoptotic pathway. Microglial cells from IRF-1-deficient mice showed markedly decreased NO production, and they were partially resistant to apoptosis in response to LPS/IFNγ but were sensitive to NO donor exposure. LPS/IFNγ treatment resulted in the induction of caspase-11 followed by activation of caspase-11, -1, and -3. Inactivation of caspase-11 by the transfection of dominant-negative mutant or treatment with the caspase inhibitors rendered microglial cells partially resistant to LPS/IFNγ-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of both NO synthesis and caspase-11 completely blocked LPS/IFNγ-induced cytotoxicity. These results indicated that LPS/IFNγ not only induced the production of cytotoxic NO through IRF-1 but also initiated the NO-independent apoptotic pathway through the induction of caspase-11 expression. We have previously shown that mouse microglial cells undergo apoptosis upon inflammatory activation and that nitric oxide (NO) is the major autocrine mediator in this process (Lee, P., Lee, J., Kim, S., Yagita, H., Lee, M.

Matsumoto Y. Kreutzberg G.W. Brain Res. Rev. 1995; 20: 269-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). Although the ontogeny of microglial cells has long been debated, recent works using monoclonal antibodies specific for microglial cells indicated that these cells are closely related to monocytes and macrophages (2Stoll G. Jander S. Prog. Neurobiol. 1999; 58: 233-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). As the primary immune effector cells in the central nervous system, microglial cells migrate to the site of tissue injury or inflammation, where they respond to invading pathogens or other inflammatory signals. Like monocytes/macrophages, they also secrete inflammatory cytokines and toxic mediators, which may amplify the inflammatory responses (3Minghetti L. Levi G. Prog. Neurobiol. 1998; 54: 99-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 4Gonzalez-Scarano F. Baltuch G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 219-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). In general, microglial cells function in a manner very similar to monocytes/macrophages. Recently, activated macrophages have been shown to undergo apoptosis (5von Knethen A. Lotero A. Brune B. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 6Albina J.E. Cui S. Mateo R.B. Reichner J.S. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 5080-5085PubMed Google Scholar, 7Adler B. Adler H. Jungi T.W. Peterhans E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the apoptosis of activated macrophages is one mechanism whereby an organism may regulate immune and inflammatory responses involving macrophages (7Adler B. Adler H. Jungi T.W. Peterhans E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 215: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We and others have demonstrated that a similar regulatory mechanism exists for microglial cells (8Liu B. Wang K. Gao H.M. Mandavilli B. Wang J.Y. Hong J.S. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 182-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 9Lee P. Lee J. Kim S. Yagita H. Lee M.S. Kim S.Y. Kim H. Suk K.

Brain Res. 2001; 900: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) as well. Microglial cells and astrocytes underwent apoptosis upon inflammatory activation, and nitric oxide (NO)1 acted as an autocrine cytotoxic mediator in this process (9Lee P. Lee J. Kim S. Yagita H. Lee M.S. Kim S.Y. Kim H. Suk K. Brain Res. 2001; 892: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 10Suk K. Lee J. Hur J. Kim Y.S. Lee M.S. Cha S.H. Kim S.Y. Kim H. Brain Res. 2001; 900: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Activation of glial cells may be intended to protect neurons at first. More frequently, however, activation of glial cells and inflammatory products derived from them have been implicated in neuronal destruction commonly observed in various neurodegenerative diseases (4Gonzalez-Scarano F. Baltuch G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 219-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). These deleterious effects of glial activation may be exacerbated by the failure of autoregulatory mechanisms. Thus, our understanding of the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases may be enhanced by elucidation of the molecular mechanism underlying autoregulation of microglial activation.IRF-1 is one of the major transcription factors that mediate IFNγ responses (11Boehm U. Klamp T. Groot M. Howard J.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 749-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (2462) Google Scholar). In particular, IRF-1 has been shown to mediate inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression in response to IFNγ (12Kamijo R. Harada H. Matsuyama T. Bosland M. Gerecitano J. Shapiro D. Le J. Koh S.I. Kimura T. Green S.J. Mak T.W. Taniguchi T. Vilček J. Science. 1994; 263: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). The expression of IRF-1 is induced by IFNγ as well as other inflammatory mediators (13Barber S.A. Fultz M.J. Salkowski C.A. Vogel S.N. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 601-608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophages (12Kamijo R. Harada H. Matsuyama T. Bosland M. Gerecitano J. Shapiro D. Le J. Koh S.I. Kimura T. Green S.J. Mak T.W. Taniguchi T. Vilček J.

Brain Res. 1997; 759: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) deficient in IRF-1 did not respond to LPS or IFNγ for NO production, indicating that IRF-1 is an essential mediator in NO production of these types of cells. The involvement of IRF-1 in cellular apoptosis has also been reported. The role of IRF-1 in the induction of apoptosis by DNA damage or IFNγ has been suggested (15Tanaka N. Ishihara M. Kitagawa M.

Previous work in our laboratory has also shown that IRF-1 plays a central role in IFNγ/TNFα-induced apoptosis of mouse pancreatic islet β-cells (18Suk K. Kim S. Kim Y.H. Kim K.A. Chang I. Yagita H. Shong M. Lee M.S. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4481-4489Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and ME-180 human cervical cancer cells (19Suk K. Chang I. Kim Y.H. Kim S. Kim J.Y. Kim H. Lee M.S. J.

However, the role of IRF-1 in microglial NO production and apoptosis has not been investigated.Caspases play a central role in central nervous system cellular apoptosis (20Yuan J. Yankner B.A. Nature. 2000; 407: 802-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar). A variety of apoptotic stimuli lead to the activation of initiator caspases, which in turn triggers the caspase cascade, ultimately resulting in apoptotic cell death. Among more than a dozen caspases identified so far, caspase-11 has been first characterized as an activator of caspase-1 (21Wang S. Miura M. Jung Y. Zhu H. Gagliardini V. Shi L. Greenberg A.H. Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20580-20587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and this caspase has been proposed to play an important regulatory role in both apoptosis and inflammatory responses (22Wang S. Miura M. Jung Y.K. Zhu H. Li E. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 92: 501-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Activation of caspase-11 was crucial for the activation of caspase-1 (22Wang S. Miura M. Jung Y.K. Zhu H. Li E. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 92: 501-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar); however, recent studies have demonstrated that caspase-11 activates caspase-3 as well under pathological conditions (23Kang S.J. Wang S. Hara H. Peterson E.P. Namura S. Amin-Hanjani S. Huang Z. Srinivasan A. Tomaselli K.J. Thornberry N.A. Moskowitz M.A. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Caspase-11 has been shown to carry out an essential function in apoptotic death of neuronal cells and oligodendrocytes (23Kang S.J. Wang S. Hara H. Peterson E.P. Namura S. Amin-Hanjani S. Huang Z.

Yuan J. Momoi T. Okano H. Miura M. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and showed reduced numbers of apoptotic cells after middle cerebral artery occlusion (23Kang S.J. Wang S. Hara H. Peterson E.P. Namura S. Amin-Hanjani S. Huang Z. Srinivasan A. Tomaselli K.J. Thornberry N.A. Moskowitz M.A. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The expression of caspase-11 was increased by inflammatory stimuli (21Wang S. Miura M. Jung Y. Zhu H. Gagliardini V. Shi L. Greenberg A.H. Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20580-20587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and hypoxia (24Shibata M. Hisahara S. Hara H. Yamawaki T. Fukuuchi Y. Yuan J. Okano H. Miura M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 643-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar); this increase in the expression is believed to auto-activate caspase-11 (23Kang S.J. Wang S. Hara H. Peterson E.P. Namura S. Amin-Hanjani S. Huang Z. Srinivasan A. Tomaselli K.J. Thornberry N.A. Moskowitz M.A. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Recombinant procaspase-11 has been shown to auto-process itself in vitro, suggesting that an elevated concentration of caspase-11 in stimulated cells may be sufficient for its auto-activation (23Kang S.J. Wang S. Hara H. Peterson E.P. Namura S. Amin-Hanjani S. Huang Z. Srinivasan A. Tomaselli K.J. Thornberry N.A. Moskowitz M.A. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). These previous reports on the critical functions of caspase-11 in central nervous system cellular apoptosis led us to examine the role of this caspase in microglial apoptosis.In this work, we have demonstrated that both IRF-1 and caspase-11 are required for the activation-induced apoptosis of microglial cells and that these two molecules are strongly induced by inflammatory stimuli to participate in two separate events leading to microglial apoptosis. IRF-1 induction mediated the production of NO, which acted as an autocrine apoptotic mediator, whereas up-regulation of caspase-11 induced direct apoptotic pathways independently of NO production. NF-κB was involved in NO production but not in apoptogenic action of NO or caspase-11.DISCUSSIONHere, we present evidence that IRF-1, NF-κB, and caspase-11 play a central role in the apoptosis of mouse microglial cells following inflammatory activation. LPS/IFNγ treatment induced apoptosis of activated microglial cells through two independent events: they induced production of the autocrine toxic mediator (NO) in microglial cells in an IRF-1/NF-κB-dependent manner, and concurrently they initiated NO-independent apoptotic pathways through caspase-11 induction (Fig. 10).Activation-induced cell death (AICD) is an active process. T and B lymphocytes undergo activation-induced cell death as an autoregulatory mechanism for the body to remove unwanted activated cells after making appropriate use of them (36Donjerkovic D. Scott D.W. Cell Res. 2000; 10: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 37Crispe I.N. Immunol. Res. 1999; 19: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Compared with lymphocytes, glial cells in the central nervous system have not been not well studied in this respect. Recently, however, the results in our laboratory indicated that both microglial cells (9Lee P. Lee J. Kim S. Yagita H. Lee M.S. Kim S.Y. Kim H. Suk K. Brain Res. 2001; 892: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and astrocytes (10Suk K. Lee J. Hur J. Kim Y.S. Lee M.S. Cha S.H. Kim S.Y. Kim H. Brain Res. 2001; 900: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) might be under the control of a similar regulatory mechanism. In particular, microglial cells that are closely related to macrophages underwent NO-dependent apoptosis upon inflammatory activation. In contrast to the AICD of T lymphocytes, where Fas-Fas ligand interaction plays a central role, neither Fas-Fas ligand interaction nor TNFα was important in the AICD of microglial cells. Instead, NO produced by activated microglial cells themselves was the major cytotoxic mediator. However, the presence of an NO-independent cytotoxic mechanism was suggested by the incomplete protection by iNOS inhibitor. Here, we present evidence that caspase-11 induction is such an NO-independent apoptotic pathway. Inflammatory stimuli such as LPS and IFNγ were more than just cellular activators to microglial cells. They not only activated the cells to produce inflammatory mediator such as TNFα and NO but also induced autoregulatory apoptosis. The involvement of similar (overlapping) signaling pathways in cellular activation and apoptosis has been suggested by previous studies. Bcl-xL, one of the well known apoptotic inhibitors, has been shown to inhibit both cellular activation and apoptosis in macrophages (38Lakics V. Medvedev A.E. Okada S. Vogel S.N. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2729-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 39Okada S. Zhang H. Hatano M. Tokuhisa T. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 2590-2596PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of Akt, which is known to mediate survival signaling in a number of different cell types, enhanced LPS-induced cellular activation in astrocytes (40Pahan K. Raymond J.R. Singh I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7528-7536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that inflammatory stimuli induce or activate a specific group of genes and signaling pathways, some of which are commonly involved in both activation and apoptosis. Our results suggested that caspase-11 may be an example of such genes. The induction of caspase-11 may be involved in the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β and interleukin-18 by activating the processing enzyme required (caspase-1). We and others have previously demonstrated the production of interleukin-1β (41Sanz J.M. Di Virgilio F. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4893-4898Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and interleukin-18 (42Conti B. Park L.C. Calingasan N.Y. Kim Y. Kim H. Bae Y. Gibson G.E. Joh T.H. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 67: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) by mouse microglial cells. In addition to its role in microglial activation, caspase-11 induction also causes auto-activation, which in turn may initiate caspase cascade leading to microglial apoptosis. Therefore, inflammatory stimuli seem to activate microglial cells to produce various inflammatory mediators and, concomitantly, to activate a built-in autoregulatory mechanism by both direct and indirect means (NO-independent and -dependent pathways). This, however, may not be the whole story. Our results that pretreatment of microglia with inflammatory stimuli enhanced their sensitivity to exogenous NO (Fig. 7) suggest the presence of yet other mechanisms whereby inflammatory stimuli affect the microglial AICD process (see below).In this work, we have focused on the effects of LPS and IFNγ as representative inflammatory stimuli. Treatment of microglial cells with LPS or IFNγ alone also induced cell death, NO production (9Lee P. Lee J. Kim S. Yagita H. Lee M.S. Kim S.Y. Kim H. Suk K. Brain Res. 2001; 892: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and induction of caspase-11 and IRF-1, albeit with a modest difference in the degree of response (Figs. 1 and 3). This suggests that the AICD-inducing mechanism was not different among the single treatments (LPS or IFNγ alone) and the co-treatment (LPS plus IFNγ). Astrocytes responded to LPS and IFNγ in the same way as microglial cells; LPS/IFNγ induced IRF-1 and caspase-11 as well as NO production in astrocytes, and moreover, TNFα also induced caspase-11 expression in astrocytes. 2K. Suk, J. Lee, J. Hur, P. Lee, J. Y. Kim, N. Cho, M.-S. Lee, S. Y. Kim, and H. Kim, unpublished results. Thus, the mechanism of LPS/IFNγ-induced AICD of microglial cells proposed in the current studies may also be applicable to astrocytes and other inflammatory stimuli.According to our model of activation-induced apoptosis of microglial cells, inflammatory signals that activate microglia may also initiate internal death program (Fig. 10). One interesting question that can be raised then is how microglial cells could survive inflammatory activation. It should be kept in mind that microglial cells in vivo are heterogeneous and interact with other glial cells as well as neurons. There is also growing evidence that activated microglial cells proliferate in vivo as one way of replenishment (1Gehrmann J. Matsumoto Y. Kreutzberg G.W. Brain Res. Rev. 1995; 20: 269-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). Thus, not all microglial cells may respond to the inflammatory signals in the same fashion. Upon inflammatory activation, individual microglial cells in heterogeneous population may either undergo AICD or return to the resting state via other regulatory mechanisms depending on the specific microenvironment under which they react to the signals. Although many activated microglial cells may be eliminated, some would survive to be deactivated. Whatever the mechanism of down-regulation is, this may be an excellent autoregulatory system for the microglial activation. One can easily imagine pathological situations where this type of autoregulatory mechanism goes wrong. Failure of the autoregulation of “over-activated” microglial cells may result in pathological destruction of bystander cells (neurons and other glial cells) exposed to toxic mediators produced by activated microglia. Recently, up-regulated Bcl-xL expression has been detected in the reactive microglia of patients with neurodegenerative diseases (43Drache B. Diehl G.E. Beyreuther K. Perlmutter L.S. Konig G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 47: 98-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Authors have proposed that a high level of Bcl-xL protein might render microglia more resistant to cytotoxic environment such as areas of neurodegeneration (43Drache B. Diehl G.E. Beyreuther K. Perlmutter L.S. Konig G. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 47: 98-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein has been also associated with the aged brain and with neurodegenerative diseases (44Migheli A. Cavalla P. Piva R. Giordana M.T. Schiffer D. Neuroreport. 1994; 5: 1906-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The importance of physiological regulation of microglial activation by AICD is supported by these previous reports.Our current work indicates that inflammatory stimuli play a dual role in AICD of microglial cells. They not only induce the indirect apoptotic pathway via production of NO, but they also induce the direct apoptotic pathway in a manner independent of NO production. Although caspase-11 was required for NO-independent apoptotic pathway, IRF-1 and NF-κB were involved in the NO-dependent apoptosis of microglial cells mainly by mediating NO synthesis. We and others have previously reported that STAT1/IRF-1 pathway plays a central role in cellular apoptosis by inflammatory cytokines (15Tanaka N. Ishihara M. Kitagawa M. Harada H. Kimura T.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and caspase induction has been suggested as a possible downstream event following IRF-1 induction in IFNγ-induced apoptosis (17Kano A. Haruyama T. Akaike T. Watanabe Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 672-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In microglial cells, however, the absence of IRF-1 did not affect the inducibility of caspase-11 that mediated apoptosis of activated cells. Although we have not tested the inducibility and activation of other caspases in IRF-1-deficient microglial cells, a role of IRF-1 in microglial apoptosis seems to be related to NO production rather than caspase induction or activation (Figs. 2 B and 3 C). Our results also demonstrated that NF-κB plays a role similar to IRF-1 in microglial apoptosis. NF-κB activation appeared to be involved in inflammatory NO production; however, it did not influence the apoptotic process initiated by LPS/IFNγ or NO donors (Fig. 9). It has been reported previously that IRF-1 and NF-κB interact in vitroas well as in vivo for the cooperative induction of inflammatory genes (33Saura M. Zaragoza C. Bao C. McMillan A. Lowenstein C.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 45Neish A.S. Read M.A. Thanos D. Pine R. Maniatis T. Collins T. Mol. Cell.

Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 1037-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In particular, the two transcription factors interacted to cooperatively enhance iNOS gene transcription in macrophages stimulated by LPS and IFNγ (33Saura M. Zaragoza C. Bao C. McMillan A. Lowenstein C.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Cooperative induction of iNOS expression by interaction between the two transcription factors may also occur in LPS/IFNγ-treated microglial cells, and this interaction between IRF-1 and NF-κB may well be responsible for cytotoxic NO production in response to LPS/IFNγ.Our results here demonstrate that caspase-11 plays a critical role in NO-independent actions of inflammatory stimuli during AICD of microglial cells. Caspase-11 was strongly induced by LPS/IFNγ and inactivation of the caspase blocked NO-independent apoptosis. Furthermore, over-expression of caspase-11 alone induced microglial apoptosis to a certain extent. These results are in agreement with previous studies in which over-expression of caspase-11 in Rat-1 fibroblasts induced apoptosis (21Wang S. Miura M. Jung Y. Zhu H. Gagliardini V. Shi L. Greenberg A.H. Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20580-20587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The results also suggest that up-regulation of caspase-11 expression alone may be sufficient for the initiation of apoptotic pathways in microglial cells, possibly through auto-activation of caspase-11 followed by cascade activation of downstream executioner caspases. This possibility was also suggested in a previous report (23Kang S.J. Wang S. Hara H. Peterson E.P. Namura S. Amin-Hanjani S. Huang Z. Srinivasan A. Tomaselli K.J. Thornberry N.A. Moskowitz M.A. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), where caspase-1 and -3 were proposed as downstream caspases cleaved by auto-activated caspase-11. A similar involvement of caspase-1, -3, and -11 was demonstrated in microglial apoptosis. Although NO donor-induced apoptosis appeared to involve only the caspase-3 pathway, apoptotic pathway initiated by LPS/IFNγ seemed to involve caspase-1, -3, and -11 (Fig. 5). Thus, inflammatory stimuli initiate two divergent apoptotic pathways in microglial cells, one being NO production followed by its apoptogenic action and the other being caspase-11 induction. However, these two pathways ultimately converge on the activation of caspase-3 for the execution of apoptosis. Future studies using microglial cells from caspase-11-deficient mice will give the definitive answer on the role of the caspase-11 in AICD of microglial cells.Although IRF-1 and caspase-11 play a major role in activation-induced apoptosis of microglial cells, the involvement of other genes up-regulated by inflammatory stimuli cannot be excluded. In fact, pretreatment of microglial cells with LPS/IFNγ enhanced sensitivity of the cells to NO-induced toxicity, indicating the presence of other apoptotic mediators modulated by inflammatory stimuli. IRF-1 and caspase-11 are not likely to play an important role under these conditions for the following reasons. First, because the pretreatment with LPS/IFNγ was done in the presence of NMMA, a role of endogenous NO and IRF-1, which predominantly mediated its production, is minimal. Second, there was no difference in the sensitivity of microglial cells to NO donors between IRF-1 +/+ and −/− mice. Third, an exogenous NO induced the apoptosis in microglial cells that constitutively expressed very low levels of caspase-11, indicating that caspase-11 induction was not necessary for NO-induced apoptosis. Finally, NO-induced apoptosis was not blocked by caspase-1-specific inhibitor, indicating that NO-induced apoptosis was not mediated through caspase-11/caspase-1 pathways. Taken collectively, our results strongly suggest that LPS/IFNγ-inducible gene products other than IRF-1 and caspase-11 may also participate in the AICD of microglial cells. Candidate genes include p53 and Bax, which are known to be involved in NO-induced apoptosis (47Chung H.T. Pae H.O. Choi B.M. Billiar T.R. Kim Y.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 1075-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) (Fig. 10). Further studies that address this issue are in progress in our laboratory.In conclusion, microglial cells undergo apoptosis upon inflammatory activation. In the activation-induced apopto"
https://openalex.org/W1972388246,"The majority of familial Alzheimer's disease cases have been attributed to mutations in the presenilin 1 (PS1) gene. PS1 is synthesized as an inactive holoprotein that undergoes endoproteolytic processing to generate a functional N- and C-terminal heterodimer (NTF and CTF, respectively). We identified a single residue in PS1, Ser397, which regulates the CTF levels in a population of dimer that has a rapid turnover. This residue is part of a highly conserved glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) consensus phosphorylation site within the loop domain of PS1. Site-directed mutagenesis at the Ser397 position increased levels of PS1 CTF but not NTF or holoprotein. Similar increases in only CTF levels were seen when cells expressing wild type PS1 were treated with lithium chloride, an inhibitor of GSK-3β. Both wild type and PS1 S397A CTF displayed a biphasic turnover, reflecting rapidly degraded and stable populations. Rapid turnover was delayed for mutant PS1 S397A, causing increased CTF. These data demonstrate that PS1 NTF·CTF endoproteolytic fragments are generated in excess, that phosphorylation at Ser397 by GSK-3β regulates the discard of excess CTF, and that the disposal of surplus NTF is mediated by an independent mechanism. Overall, the results indicate that production of active NTF·CTF dimer is more complex than limited endoproteolysis of PS1 holoprotein and instead involves additional regulatory events.

Uncleaved PS monomers are incorporated into an immature complex of ∼180 kDa or are degraded by a proteosome-dependent mechanism. Maturation of the complex is associated with an increase in molecular mass to ∼250 kDa and cleavage of the PS holoprotein to generate the functional NTF·CTF dimeric structure. This tight regulation of processed PS dimer is exemplified by overexpression of PS1, which results in a replacement of the endogenous PS1 NTF·CTF complex. Furthermore, PS1 replacement inhibits the synthesis of PS2 NTF and CTF fragments and vice versa (4Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitsky T. Davenport F.

PS1 also associates with other proteins such as glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), the serine/threonine kinase that negatively regulates β-catenin cell survival signaling by tagging this protein for degradation (24Takashima A.

A cDNA encoding PS1 was amplified by standard polymerase chain reaction techniques and subcloned into a C-terminal Myc-His6-tagged mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(−) (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis of the serine and threonine residues found in PS1, which conform to the (S/T)XXXS GSK-3β consensus phosphorylation site were generated by using a two-primer pair method protocol outlined by the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).

Briefly, synthetic peptides (30–50 µm) containing the Ser397, Ser401 motif, NH2-393VGKASATASGDWN405-COOH (wild type), or an altered motif to substitute serine 397 for alanine, NH2-393VGKAAATASGDWN405-COOH (S397A), was incubated with 5 units of kinase, 10 µm ATP, and 2 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 111 TBq/mmol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at 37 °C. Incorporation of radiolabeled phosphate was determined by adsorption of the peptide to P81 membranes and scintillation counting. Synthetic PS1 peptides used for in vitro kinase studies were obtained from American Peptide Co. GSK-3β (rabbit), produced by recombinant methods, was purchased from Sigma or New England Biolabs. 293HEK cells were transiently transfected with either mock cDNA, wild type PS1, or PS1 S397A mutant with 2 µg of DNA per well of a six-well plate. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and growth medium was replaced with methionine-, cysteine-, and serum-free medium and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. After the incubation, the medium was supplemented with 100 µCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated for 20 or 120 min. Following the pulse of radioactivity, cells were washed several times, placed in complete medium, and incubated at 37 °C. Cells were harvested at the indicated times and lysed, and CTF and PS1 holoprotein were immunoprecipitated from the lysates as previously described (23Kirschenbaum F. Hsu S.-C. Cordell B.

Immunoprecipitates were resolved on 4–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gels (Novex) and analyzed by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Western blot analysis was used to ensure equivalent levels of exogenous PS1 expression. PS1 is synthesized as a 46-kDa holoprotein with six or eight transmembrane-spanning domains. This 46-kDa protein is endoproteolytically processed to generate a NTF·CTF heterodimer (4Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitsky T. Davenport F. Nordstedt C.

PS CTF has a large hydrophilic loop extension between transmembrane domains 6 and 7 that has been shown to interact with a number of proteins (12Saura C.A. Tomita T. Davenport F. Harris C.I.

Alignment of the hydrophilic loop domain of PS1 (residues 263–407) from several species revealed that this domain contains three highly conserved and potential GSK-3β consensus phosphorylation sites:TERES 324,STPES 357, andSATAS 401, two of which are completely conserved in all species examined (Ref. 23Kirschenbaum F. Hsu S.-C. Cordell B. McCarthy J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7366-7375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar and Fig.1). The sequence (S/T)XXXS is known to be a consensus sequence for GSK-3β phosphorylation. Since this motif is highly conserved in PS1, it seems likely that these identified GSK-3β consensus phosphorylation sites mediate specific PS1 function(s). Indeed, we have previously reported that theSTPES 357 motif is necessary for the physical association between PS1 and β-catenin (23Kirschenbaum F. Hsu S.-C. Cordell B. McCarthy J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7366-7375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Since phosphorylation by GSK-3β is known to target proteins for ubiquitination and proteosome degradation (24Takashima A. Murayama M. Murayama O. Kohno T. Honda T. Yasutake K. Nihonmatsu N. Mercken M. Yanaguchi H. Sugihara S. Wolozin B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9637-9641Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether GSK-3β regulates levels of PS1 via these phosphorylation consensus motifs present in the CTF hydrophilic loop domain. Mutant PS1 cDNAs were generated containing single or combinatorial amino acid substitutions of the critical serine and threonine codons of all three (S/T)XXXS consensus sites. Table I summarizes the 13 different PS1 mutants generated, the specific residues mutated, and the nomenclature used to reference each mutant. We previously demonstrated that none of the GSK-3β consensus site mutations had an effect on PS1 holoprotein endoproteolysis or saturable accumulation of PS1 NTF·CTF dimer (23Kirschenbaum F. Hsu S.-C. Cordell B. McCarthy J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7366-7375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the experiments for this work, subconfluent 293HEK cell cultures were transiently transfected with wild type or mutant PS1, each tagged with a C-terminal His epitope. Expression of PS1 in transfected cell lysates was assessed by Western blot analysis with an anti-His monoclonal antibody. The presence of exogenous 46-kDa PS1 holoprotein and 20-kDa CTF was detected, revealing that some of the site-directed mutants resulted in increased levels of CTF (Fig.2 A). (Exposure was adjusted for mutant levels and was, therefore, insufficient to readily visualize exogenous wild type CTF.) A common feature of all of the mutants showing increased amounts of CTF was the presence of mutations within the SATAS 401 GSK-3β consensus motif. The increase in PS1 CTF cannot be simply explained as an artifact associated with protein overexpression, since levels of the 46-kDa holoprotein were roughly equivalent to wild type and the other mutants, nor can the increase in CTF result from the presence of the His-epitope tag, since all contain the tag, both mutant and wild type PS1.Table ISummary of GSK-3β phosphorylation site-specific mutant constructsConstruct nameIncreases in CTF1-a+, increase in PS1 CTF over wild type; −, no increase.PS1 WT−PS1 S353A−PS1 S357A−PS1 S353A,S357A−PS1 S397A+PS1 S401R−PS1 S397A,S401R+PS1 T320R−PS1 S324A−PS1 T320R,S324A−PS1 S353A,S357A,S397A,S401R+PS1 S353A,S357A,T320R,S324A−PS1 S397A,S401R,T320R,S324A+PS1 S353A,S357A,S397A,S401R,T320R,S324A+1-a +, increase in PS1 CTF over wild type; −, no increase. Open table in a new tab We also examined NTF levels in the same lysates using an N-terminus-specific antibody by Western blotting (Fig. 2 A). PS NTF and CTF are typically seen as a dimer with a 1:1 stoichiometry. It was remarkable that unlike the large increase in CTF seen upon expression of SATAS 401 site mutations, the 30-kDa NTF levels were equivalent to wild type for all mutations within all GSK-3β consensus motifs, including those at theSATAS 401 site. To elucidate specific residue requirements within theSATAS 401 motif on the accumulation of PS1 CTF, we individually mutated the serine residues within this site. The two single mutants, PS1 S397A and PS1 S401R, as well as the double mutant (PS1 S397A,S401R) and wild type PS1 were transfected into 293HEK cells, and CTF levels were analyzed by Western blot. The results obtained clearly indicated that the single mutation S397A was uniquely responsible for the elevation of CTF as PS1 CTF levels from S401R expression were identical to those obtained with exogenous wild type PS1 (Fig. 2 B). Since the accumulation of PS1 NTF and CTF derivatives typically occurs in a 1:1 stoichiometry, we examined whether mutating residue S397A affected the PS1 NTF·CTF stoichiometry and dimer composition. To do so, we immunoprecipitated the dimer using either a CTF- or NTF-specific antibody and then Western blotted to detect the complementary fragment of the dimer. Wild type and PS1 S397A CTF were immunoprecipitated using an anti-His antibody and then were Western blotted for NTF using the N-terminal antibody, 614.1 (Fig. 2 C). Consistent with direct Western blot analysis in Fig. 2, A and B, the immunopurified sample contained increased amounts of PS1 CTF in cells expressing PS1 S397A compared with cells expressing wild type PS1. In contrast, immunopurified samples from both wild type PS1- and PS1 S397A-expressing cells had equivalent amounts of PS1 NTF (Fig.2 C, left panel). The reciprocal experiment was carried out. NTF was immunoprecipitated from cells expressing either wild type or PS1 S397A followed by Western blotting for CTF (Fig. 2 C, right panel). Equal amounts of both NTF and CTF were seen for both wild type and mutant PS1. These results suggest that the 1:1 NTF/CTF stoichiometry was maintained in the mutant and that excess CTF was not affiliated in the dimer structure. Thus, mutation at residue Ser397within the SATAS 401 GSK-3β consensus motif of PS1 perturbs CTF accumulation independent of alterations in holoprotein, NTF, or the functional dimeric complex. To further assess the role of GSK-3β in regulating PS1 CTF levels, we examined whether inhibition of GSK-3β affected CTF accumulation. Although it is reported to have several biological effects, including a role as a neuroprotective agent, lithium chloride specifically inhibits GSK-3β in the millimolar range but has no effect on numerous other protein kinases, including cAMP-dependent protein kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and casein kinase II. Lithium thus mimics the effects of physiological GSK-3β inhibition. Treatment of cells with lithium chloride should mimic the observed selective accumulation of PS1 CTF when residue Ser397 is mutated. To test this, subconfluent 293HEK cells were transfected with wild type PS1 and then exposed to 10 mm lithium chloride in complete medium for 24 h. A companion culture was identically manipulated except that lithium chloride was not added. Western blot analysis with a PS1 CTF-specific anti-His antibody or a PS1 NTF-specific antibody, 614.1, revealed that inhibition of GSK-3β activity by lithium chloride resulted in a significant 3-fold increase in CTF (Fig.3 A). In contrast, when the same cell lysates were assessed for NTF levels, inhibition of GSK-3β was without effect (Fig. 3 A). To further confirm the role of GSK-3β phosphorylation of PS1 CTF at residue Ser397, we carried out in vitro kinase studies. Synthetic peptides harboring theSATAS 401 motif centered within the sequence were used as substrates for GSK-3β phosphorylation. Two peptides were evaluated, one bearing the wild type motif (SATAS401) and one with a mutation at Ser397changing the serine residue to an alanine (AATAS401). Recombinant GSK-3β was used as the enzyme source. The data in Fig.3 B verify that this sequence is a substrate for GSK-3β as phosphorylation was only observed with the peptide bearing the wild type motif. Mutating residue Ser397 within theSATAS 401 motif dramatically reduced GSK-3β phosphorylation, indicating that Ser397 was the recipient residue of the phosphate group. Together these in vitro and in vivo data indicate that GSK-3β recognizes the SATAS 401 motif and that this site influences the cellular steady-state level of PS1 CTF. PS1 holoprotein, NTF and CTF have been reported by several groups to be degraded by the proteosome (7Steiner H. Capell A. Pesold B. Citron M. Kloetzel P.M. Selkoe D.J. Romig H. Mendla K. Haass C. J.

In these studies, inhibitors of proteosome activity, such as the peptide aldehyde ALLN and lactacystin, were shown to inhibit proteosome-mediated proteolysis of PS1 and its derivatives, and that this leads to an accumulation of PS1 proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2321037169,"Smad proteins transduce signals from TGF-β receptors and regulate transcription of target genes. Among the latter are c-jun and junB, which encode members of the AP-1 family of transcription factors. In this study, we have investigated the functional interactions of the Smad and AP-1 transcription factors in the context of Smad-specific gene transactivation in both fibroblasts and keratinocytes. We demonstrate that overexpression of either junB or c-jun prevents TGF-β- or Smad3-induced transactivation of the Smad-specific promoter construct (SBE)4-Lux. Inversely, Smad-driven promoter transactivation by TGF-β/Smad is significantly enhanced when c-jun expression is abolished in HaCaT keratinocytes, and when junB expression is prevented in fibroblasts, consistent with the cell-type specific induction of jun members by TGF-β. We also demonstrate that Smad-specific gene transactivation in junB−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts is significantly higher than in embryonic fibroblasts from the control parental mouse line, and that this difference is abolished by rescuing junB expression in junB−/− cells. Finally, we have determined that off-DNA interactions between Smad3 and both c-Jun and JunB result in the reduction of Smad3/DNA interactions. From these results, we provide a model in which jun expression in response to the initial Smad cascade represents a negative feed-back mechanism counteracting Smad-driven gene transactivation."

Although the depolarization results mainly from the influx of Na+, these channels also conduct a significant Ca2+ current that is large enough to evoke transmitter release from presynaptic neurons. We sought to determine the molecular basis of this Ca2+ conductance by a mutational analysis of recombinant P2X2 receptors. Wild type and 31 mutant P2X2 receptors were expressed in HEK-293 cells and studied under voltage-clamp. We found that the relative Ca2+permeability measured from the reversal potentials of ATP-gated currents was unaffected by neutralizing fixed charge (Asp315, Asp349) near the mouths of the channel pore. By contrast, mutations that changed the character or side chain volume of three polar residues (Thr336, Thr339, Ser340) within the pore led to significant changes in PCa/PCs. The largest changes occurred when Thr339 and Ser340 were replaced with tyrosine; these mutations almost completely abolished Ca2+permeability, reduced PLi/PCs by about one-half, and shifted the relative permeability sequence of Cs+, Rb+, K+, and Na+to their relative mobility in water.

We know more about the biophysics of homomeric P2X2receptors than other family members primarily because this subunit shows a relatively slow rate of desensitization; the slow desensitization results in sustained responses to applications of ATP that are easy to study under voltage-clamp. Like all family members, P2X2 receptors are freely permeable to small cations, impermeable to anions, and display a strong preference for Ca2+ over Na+ (11Evans R.J. Lewis C. Virginio C. Lundstrom K.

Physiol. 1998; 510: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Furthermore, they show a conductance sequence to alkali metal cations that differs from the relative mobility of these ions in water, suggesting that the receptor distinguishes among similarly sized ions (13Ding S. Sachs F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 695-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The molecular basis of this selection is unknown. Each P2X2subunit has two transmembrane-spanning domains (14Torres G.E. Egan T.M. Voigt M.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and scanning cysteine mutagenesis studies demonstrate that the second of these, TMD2,1 forms a hydrated surface of the channel pore (15Rassendren F. Buell G. Newbolt A. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3446-3454Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 16Egan T.M. Haines W.R. Voigt M.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2350-2359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In or near TMD2 are two conserved aspartates (Fig. 1) that may facilitate cation transport through the pore by altering the local concentrations of cations and anions. In addition, TMD2 contains a number of pore-lining, polar amino acids that may regulate cation current by solvating ions within the pore (16Egan T.M. Haines W.R. Voigt M.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2350-2359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the specific amino acids of TMD2 that play a role in monovalent cation and Ca2+ permeability, we measured relative permeability sequences from the reversal potentials of ATP-gated currents. Acidic and polar amino acids within TMD2 of the P2X2 receptor were mutated one at a time to alter the charge, polarity, and/or volume of the side chain. PCa/PCs was measured first because the high Ca2+ permeability suggests that sites within the pore confer a favorable electrostatic profile for Ca2+transport. Then, relative monovalent cation permeabilities were measured for all mutants displaying altered Ca2+permeabilities. Our results show that point mutations of polar residues within a short stretch of TMD2 alter monovalent cation and Ca2+ permeability in a manner consistent with an effect on a narrow section of the channel pore. This short stretch of TMD2 may form part of the ion selectivity filter that regulates Ca2+permeability by providing favorable solvation of partially dehydrated ions as they pass through the channel pore. Site-directed mutagenesis of acidic and polar amino acids of the rat P2X2 receptor was performed using the overlap-primer extension method (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Siedman J.G. Smith J.A. Stuhl K. Janseen J. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1995: 8.5.1-8.5.7Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction was carried out using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs), and all mutations were verified by sequencing using the33P-Terminator Sequenase kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. HEK-293 cells were plated at a density of 400,000 cells/35-mm culture dish and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Transient expression of WT and mutant receptors was accomplished using a mixture of 1 µg of a P2X2receptor cDNA, 0.5 µg of plasmid pGreen Lantern-1 encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein, 6 µl of LipofectAMINE, and 1 ml of Opti-MEM according to the manufacturer's protocols (Life Technologies, Inc). Large ATP-gated currents through functional receptors were studied 24–36 h after transfection. Whole cell currents were recorded at room temperature with low resistance (1.5–2 megohms), lightly fire-polished, borosilicate electrodes (Garner Glass), and AxoPatch 200 series amplifiers (Axon Instruments). At the time of an experiment, plated cells were mechanically dispersed using a fire-polished Pasteur pipette. An aliquot of the dispersion was transferred to a recording chamber containing a standard extracellular solution of the following composition (in mm): 154 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES. Cells predicted to express P2X receptor protein were identified using fluorescence microscopy to detect the presence of enhanced green fluorescent protein. Whole cell current was measured using the perforated patch technique (18Horn R. Korn S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The pipette solution contained (in mm): 130 cesium methanesulfonate, 24 CsCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, and amphotericin B (200 µg/ml). After establishing a gigaohm seal, the membrane contained within the tip of the pipette was allowed to incorporate amphotericin B until a stable series resistance (mean of 6.1 ± 0.2 megohms for a sample of 200 cells) was established. The data were low pass-filtered at 5 kHz and digitized direct to disk at a sampling interval of 100 µs using the EventTracter XOP developed by Richard Bookman and Jack Herrington (University of Miami, Miami, FL) and executed in IGOR Pro (Wavemetrics, OR). ATP and extracellular solutions of different ionic compositions were applied by moving the electrode and attached cell into the line of flow of solutions exiting one of an array of inlet tubes. Successive applications of ATP were separated by at least 2 min to minimize receptor desensitization. Reversal potentials were measured from the best polynomial fits to the leak subtracted currents obtained from voltage ramps (120 mV, 240 mV/s) applied before and during a 3-s applications of ATP (Fig.2). Ionic permeability ratios were determined from the difference in reversal potentials of ATP-gated currents generated in a range of extracellular solutions. Each extracellular solution contained (in mm): 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, and either 112 Ca2+ or 154 X+ (where X equals Na+, K+, Rb+, Li+, TEA+ or NMDG+). Extracellular solutions used to measure monovalent cation permeability ratios also contained 1 mm Ca2+ and 1 mmMg2+ to prevent the progressive change in cation permeability that sometimes occurs when ATP-gated currents are studied in extracellular solutions lacking divalent cations 2In other experiments, we measured a progressive change in reversal potential in about 10% of the cells exposed to an extracellular solution containing 154 mm NMDG and 0 mm divalent cations; no difference in PNMDG/PCs was noted in the remaining 90% of the cells (data not shown).

The EC50 of ATP at the WT receptor is 16 ± 3 µm (n = 11) 3K. Migita, W. R. Haines, and T. M. Egan, unpublished observation. in normal extracellular concentrations (1 mm) of divalent cations; however, ATP becomes less potent as [Ca2+]oincreases (11Evans R.J. Lewis C. Virginio C. Lundstrom K. Buell G. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Physiol. 1996; 497: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). We used 30 µm ATP to evoke ligand-gated current when the extracellular solution contained 1 mmCa2+. A higher ATP concentration (0.5–2 mm) was used in the presence of 112 mm extracellular Ca2+ to account for the decreased ATP potency. ATP (1 mm) evoked no current in untransfected cells under these conditions (n = 5, data not shown). Reversal potentials measured in different extracellular solutions were compared with that measured in 154 mm extracellular Cs+ in the same cell. PX/PCs was calculated as PX/PCs =exp(ΔV rev F/RT), where PX/PCs is the relative permeability of X+ to Cs+, ΔV rev is the difference in the reversal potentials measured in the two solutions, F is Faraday's constant, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. Relative Ca2+ permeability was calculated as PCa/PCs = (a Cs[Cs]i)*exp(ΔV rev F/RT)*(1 +exp(ΔV rev F/RT))/4a Ca[Ca]o, where a Na and a Ca are the activity coefficients of Cs+ (0.75) and Ca2+(0.25), respectively. Each experiment was repeated at least five times. The data were pooled, analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, and evaluated using the Fisher's protected least significant differencepost hoc test of Statview 5.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All P2X receptors contain two conserved aspartates (Asp315 and Asp349 of the P2X2subunit) that are, in theory, appropriately positioned to influence ionic current. They may do so by attracting cations and repelling anions near the mouths of the pore or by forming anionic binding sites that have a high affinity for Ca2+ (21Aidley D.J. Stanfield P.R. Ion Channels: Molecules in Motion. Cambridge University Press, New York1996Google Scholar). Asp315occupies a site about 20 amino acids upstream of the start of TMD2 (22Brake A.J. Wagenbach M.J. Julius D. Nature. 1994; 371: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar), and Asp349 is within TMD2 on the intracellular side of channel gate (16Egan T.M. Haines W.R. Voigt M.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2350-2359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These two residues were mutated to lysine, glutamate, and asparagine to test the role of fixed charge on Ca2+ permeability. Lysine-substituted mutants (D315K, D349K) had dramatically altered responses to ATP. No ligand-gated current was recorded in cells transfected with D315K regardless of the concentration of ATP applied (0.03–1 mm), and peak currents evoked by 30 µm ATP through D349K receptors were significantly smaller (5.5 ± 1.5 pA/pF, n = 5) than those of D349N (60.6 ± 10.3 pA/pF, n = 12) or D349E (75.3 ± 14 pA/pF, n = 13). These differences did not result from either a rightward shift in the ATP concentration-response curve of the lysine-substituted receptors (23Nakazawa K. Ohno Y. Inoue K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) or a change in the amount of P2X receptor protein targeted to the cell surface membrane. 4T. M. Egan and M. M. Voigt, unpublished data. The small or negligible responses of the lysine-substituted mutants made accurate measurements of ATP-gated current reversal potentials problematic, and these two mutants were not investigated further. Cells expressing glutamate- or asparagine-substituted receptors (D315E, D315N, D349E, D349N) gave ATP-gated currents that were no different than those of the WT receptor in either size or shape of the current. Additionally, PCa/PCs was unchanged even when the fixed negative charge of the carboxylate was removed by mutation to asparagine (Table I). This result argues against a role for either D315 or D349 in determining relative Ca2+ permeability.Table IEffect of site-directed mutagenesis of charged residues on relative calcium permeabilityCloneΔV revPCa/PCsnpvalueWT4.6 ± 1.72.74 ± 0.2512D315E7.3 ± 1.23.21 ± 0.2330.42D315N5.6 ± 3.53.1 ± 0.7750.91D315KNDND10D349E5.3 ± 1.42.96 ± 0.22130.56D349N1.8 ± 1.72.42 ± 0.21120.41D349KNDND5Values are mean ± S.E.; n, number of experiments;p value determined by analysis of variance using a generalized Fisher's protected least significant difference test; ND, not determined.

Next, we investigated the contribution of the uncharged polar amino acid Asn333 to ion selectivity because the results of two studies suggest it may play a role in this process. First, P2X2 receptors are predicted to contain a saturable binding site for Na+ that is located about 20% of the electrical distance from the extracellular surface (13Ding S. Sachs F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 695-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Asn333 is appropriately positioned to form such a site if TMD2 passes through the membrane as a straight α helix. 5The secondary structure of TMD2 is undetermined. Second, mutant N333I receptors have reduced single channel conductances, a result that suggests that the negative pole of Asn333 facilitates cationic current either by concentrating cations near the extracellular mouth of the channel or by influencing the molecular dimensions of a narrow part of the channel pore (23Nakazawa K. Ohno Y. Inoue K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). PCa/PCs was measured for five mutant receptors in which the polarity and/or volume of the side chain at position Asn333 were changed. In the first series of experiments, we introduced mutations (N333Q, N333Y) that predominately affected side chain volume. N333Q resulted in a modest increase in side chain volume but had no effect on PCa/PCs (TableII). N333Y further increased side chain volume and decreased PCa/PCs by 27%, although the decline was not large enough to reach statistical significance. These findings demonstrate that the WT receptor is wide enough at position to Asn333 to tolerate moderate changes in side chain volume without significantly affecting Ca2+permeability.Table IIEffect of site-directed mutagenesis of Asn333 on relative calcium permeabilityCloneΔV revPCa/PCsnpvalueΔVolΔHydromVÅ3WT4.6 ± 1.72.74 ± 0.2512N333Q3.84 ± 3.22.76 ± 0.4450.9725.90N333Y−2.8 ± 1.92.02 ± 0.1870.0768.42.2N333C2.3 ± 3.62.80 ± 0.5150.62−29.66N333V2.3 ± 1.62.43 ± 0.3950.556.57.7N333I−10.5 ± 2.41.21 ± 0.172-aRatio is significantly different (p < 0.01) from WT.70.00633.68.0Mean ± S.E.; n, number of experiments.

Nature. 1975; 254: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar). Next, we examined the effect of a change in hydrophobicity. Increasing hydrophobicity was without effect when side chain volume decreased (N333C) or remained constant (N333V). The lack of effect of the N333V mutation on relative Ca2+ permeability is particularly important because it is inconsistent with the hypothesis that the negative pole of asparagine facilitates Ca2+ current by producing a high local Ca2+ concentration near the extracellular end of the ion channel (24Nakazawa K. Inoue K. Ohno Y. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 347: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). By contrast, PCa/PCs was significantly reduced when isoleucine replaced Asn333 (see Table II), a result in keeping with the reduced single channel conductance of N333I previously reported by Nakazawa et al. (24Nakazawa K. Inoue K. Ohno Y. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 347: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The side chain of isoleucine is both larger and more hydrophobic than asparagine, and our results suggest that both parameters must change before an effect on PCa/PCs is measured. The P2X2 receptor contains five additional uncharged polar amino acids (Thr330, Thr336, Thr339, Ser340, Ser345) in TMD2. We investigated the role these amino acids play in Ca2+ current by measuring PCa/PCs in a series of mutants containing hydrophobic substitutions. Native residues were replaced by valine or alanine to reduce polarity without causing a dramatic change in side chain volume (Table III). A defined pattern of reactivity was apparent. The two polar amino acids (T330V, N333V) thought to be positioned closest to the extracellular mouth of the ion channel were unaffected by valine replacement. Next to these is a stretch of residues (Thr336, Thr339, Ser340) that imparted a roughly equal (∼55%) reduction in PCa/PCs when side chains were rendered hydrophobic (see Table III). The last polar amino acid, Ser345, which may lie adjacent to the intracellular side of the channel gate (16Egan T.M. Haines W.R. Voigt M.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2350-2359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was not affected by mutation to alanine. A simple hypothesis that explains these results is that the pore is narrower between Thr336 and Ser340 than it is at Asn333 or Ser345. If so, then hydrophobic substitutions within this domain may disrupt Ca2+permeability by removing the countercharge required by the partially dehydrated ion as it permeates the channel pore.Table IIIEffect of increased hydrophobicity on relative calcium permeabilityCloneΔV revPCa/PCsnpvalueΔVolΔHydromVÅ3WT4.6 ± 1.72.74 ± 0.2512T330V4.1 ± 3.52.72 ± 0.4550.9819.54.9N333V2.3 ± 1.62.43 ± 0.3950.556.57.7T336V−6.9 ± 2.81.57 ± 0.243-aRatio is significantly different from WT (p < 0.01).90.00519.54.9T339V−5.0 ± 2.81.61 ± 0.213-bRatio is significantly different from WT (p < 0.05).40.0319.54.9S340A−7.8 ± 3.81.49 ± 0.083-bRatio is significantly different from WT (p < 0.05).50.01−7.62.6S345A5.9 ± 1.43.00 ± 0.2750.59−7.62.6Mean ± S.E.; n, number of experiments.3-a Ratio is significantly different from WT (p < 0.01).3-b Ratio is significantly different from WT (p < 0.05). Open table in a new tab Mean ± S.E.; n, number of experiments. We tested the hypothesis that the channel pore narrows between Thr336 and Ser340 by mutating all uncharged polar residues in TMD2 to tyrosine to increase side chain volume without changing hydrophobicity. All tyrosine-substituted mutants except T336Y and T339Y resembled WT receptor in the size and shape of ATP-gated currents (Fig. 3). HEK-293 cells transfected with cDNA encoding the T336Y mutant receptor failed to respond to 30–100 µm ATP regardless of the direction or magnitude of the electrical potential across the membrane. 6T336F also failed to give ATP-gated currents. The reason for the loss of function is unknown. T339Y was functional but displayed a more profound desensitization/inactivation in response to ATP than did control (Fig. 3); however, the rate of current decline of T339Y was still compatible with the voltage-ramp method used to measure reversal potentials, and recovery from desensitization/inactivation was complete within 3 min. The same residues that responded to hydrophobic substitutions with a decrease in PCa/PCs responded to tyrosine substitutions in a similar fashion. Uncharged polar residues outside of the stretch from Thr336 to Ser340 were not affected, whereas tyrosine-substituted mutants of the adjoining residues Thr339 and Ser340 became almost impermeable to Ca2+ (TableIV). Again, the results suggest that the pore diameter is relatively small at Thr339–Ser340 and that permeating ions can sense the composition of the wall in this domain.Table IVEffect of increased side chain volume on relative calcium permeabilityCloneΔVrevPCa/PCsnpvalueΔVolΔHydromVÅ3WT4.6 ± 1.72.74 ± 0.2512T330Y9.8 ± 1.43.79 ± 0.3260.2281.4−0.6N333Y−2.8 ± 1.92.01 ± 0.18100.0768.42.2T336YNDND1081.4−0.6T339Y−36.0 ± 3.40.33 ± 0.054-aRatio is significantly different from WT (p < 0.01).5<0.000181.4−0.6S340Y−67.3 ± 1.30.08 ± 0.014-aRatio is significantly different from WT (p < 0.01).5<0.0001104.5−0.5S345Y8.8 ± 0.83.33 ± 0.5350.23104.2−0.5Mean ± S.E.; n, number of experiments.

We looked in more detail at the effects of changing the character of the side chains at positions Thr339 and Ser340. TableV presents all data of Thr339- and Ser340-substituted mutants. A few general trends are clear. First, an increase in hydrophobicity at either position leads to a decrease in PCa/PCsregardless of the effect of the mutation on side chain volume (compare T339C, T339V, S340A, and S340F). Second, the largest decreases in PCa/PCs occur when side chain volume dramatically increases (T339Y, S340F, S340Y). For example, both the S340F and S340Y mutations result in an almost complete loss of Ca2+ permeability (PCa/PCs = 0.24 and 0.08, respectively) despite the fact that substituting tyrosine for serine does not change side chain hydrophobicity. The situation is more complicated at position Thr339, where bulky substitutions also altered gating kinetics. Specifically, the T339Y receptor had an altered rate of desensitization/inactivation in response to applications of ATP (see Fig. 3), whereas the T339F receptor showed a progressive decrease in current amplitude to repeated applications of ATP (data not shown). The dramatic decline in current amplitude of the T339F receptor made quantification of the relative Ca2+permeability difficult to measure, and this mutant was not studied further. Third, a decrease in side chain volume (by mutation to glycine) has no effect at Thr339(PCa/PCs = 2.76) but significantly decreases Ca2+ permeability at Ser340(PCa/PCs = 1.62). Such a change is expected if Ser340 represents a site within the pore where Ca2+ depends on a tight fit with the channel wall to catalyze the dehydration process. Fourth, relative Ca2+permeability increased upon addition of fixed negative charge (T339E, PCa/PCs = 6.14) and decreased upon addition of a fixed positive charge (T339K, PCa/PCs = 1.16) 7We also made the S340E and S340K mutants, but these gave small ATP-gated currents that were difficult to accurately measure in a quantitative fashion. . The finding that addition of fixed negative charge in a narrow part of the channel increases Ca2+ permeability is not surprising, as a similar effect is reported for glutamate-substituted mutants of voltage-gated sodium channels (25Heinemann S.H.

An evaluation of more than 20 site-directed mutants of murine COX-2 has allowed for the development of a model of 2-AG binding within the COX-2 active site.

Despite this difference, aspirin-treated COX-2 oxygenates 2-AG to afford 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid glycerol ester in a reaction analogous to the C-15 oxygenation of arachidonic acid observed with acetylated COX-2.

COX-1 is a constitutive enzyme expressed in most tissues, whereas COX-2 is inducible and highly regulated by a range of cytokines, growth factors, and tumor promoters (3Evett G.E. Xie W. Chipman J.G.

COX-1 appears to play a role in generating PGs, which serve cellular “housekeeping” functions and account for PG and thromboxane synthesis in gastric mucosa, kidney, and platelets (8Vane J.R. Bakhle Y.S. Botting R.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2607) Google Scholar). In contrast, COX-2 activity is primarily responsible for PG biosynthesis in the central nervous system and inflammatory cells (9Masferrer J.L. Zweifel B.S. Manning P.T. Hauser S.D. Leahy K.M.

It is now well established that the two COX isoforms play very different roles in an array of physiological and pathological processes in vivo. The possibility that the different functions of COX enzymes may be mediated by isoform-specific products has recently been posited (12Yu M. Ives D. Ramesha C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21181-21186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar,13Kozak K.R. Rowlinson S.W. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33744-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). For example, the endocannabinoid anandamide has been shown to be selectively oxygenated by COX-2 generating PG ethanolamides (12Yu M. Ives D. Ramesha C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21181-21186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). COX-2 also oxygenates the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) providing glycerol esters of both PGs and, to a lesser extent, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs). 2-AG oxygenation by COX-2 has been demonstrated to occur in cultured macrophages. Both human and murine COX-2 metabolize 2-AG as efficiently as arachidonic acid (13Kozak K.R. Rowlinson S.W. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33744-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The current study was initiated to define the binding of 2-AG in the COX-2 active site with a focus on protein residues that account for the observed isoform selectivity of this substrate. In addition, we determined the stereochemistry of oxygenation of 2-AG to PG glycerol esters and HETE glycerol esters (HETE-G) because product stereochemistry provides additional insight into the nature of substrate binding within the enzyme active site. These studies allow the development of a model for 2-AG binding in the COX-2 active site that helps explain the isoform selectivity of 2-AG oxygenation. 2-AG, PGF2α, PGF2β, 8-iso-PGF2α, 11β-PGF2α, and 15(R)-PGF2α were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI).

Apoenzymes were reconstituted with hematin prior to activity assays. COX activity was quantified as described (15Kalgutkar A.S. Marnett L.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8625-8628Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Initial reaction velocity data were obtained from the linear portion of oxygen uptake curves. The PG-G to HETE-G product ratio for enzyme oxygenation of 2-AG was obtained by incubating 10 µg of protein with 10 µg of endocannabinoid in 150 µl of Tris-HCl buffer (100 mm, pH 8) containing 500 µm phenol for 10 min at 37 °C. Oxygenated products were extracted with EtOAc. The organic solvent was evaporated under a stream of argon, and the resultant residue was redissolved in 1:1 H2O:MeCN and analyzed by LC/MS (see below). The PG-G to HETE-G ratio was calculated by dividing the area of peaks corresponding to PGE2-G and PGD2-G (m/z449, M+Na+) by the area of peaks corresponding to 11- and 15-HETE-G (m/z 417, M+Na+) followed by normalization to the ratio of products generated by wild-type enzyme. Acetylation of wild-type murine COX-2 was accomplished by treating the enzyme with 2 mm aspirin for 30 min at 37 °C. PGF2-G was prepared by incubating 300 µg of 2-AG with 450 µg of heme-reconstituted mCOX-2 in 3.0 ml of Tris-HCl buffer (100 mm, pH 8) containing 500 µm phenol for 2 min at 37 °C followed immediately by treatment with 3.0 ml of ice-cold EtOAc containing triphenylphosphine (5 mg/ml). The biphasic mixture was centrifuged, and the organic solvent was removed and dried under a stream of argon. The resultant residue was dissolved in 500 µl of 1:1 H2O:MeCN, filtered (0.22 µm), and applied to a C18 solid phase extraction column (Varian, Walnut Creek, CA). PGF2-G was eluted with 1:1 H2O:MeCN. The eluant was lyophilized, and glycerol esters were saponified by treatment with 1 n NaOH for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was acidified with 1 n HCl and extracted with EtOAc. Thin layer chromatographic analysis was conducted with a solvent of CHCl3:MeOH:HOAc:H2O (90:10:1:1), and the products were visualized by iodine staining. HETE-Gs were prepared by incubating mCOX-2 (500 nm) with 2-AG (50 µm) for 10 min at 37 °C in Tris-HCl buffer (100 mm, pH 8) containing 500 µm phenol followed by the addition of ice-cold EtOAc. The biphasic mixture was centrifuged, and the organic solvent was removed and dried under a stream of argon. The resultant residue was saponified by treatment with 1 n NaOH for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was acidified with 1 n HCl, and HETEs were extracted with EtOAc. HETE stereochemistry was established as previously described (16Schneider C. Boeglin W.E. Brash A.R. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 186-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). LC/MS was conducted as previously described (13Kozak K.R. Rowlinson S.W. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33744-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). All displayed chromatograms are representative of at least three separate experiments. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers (5′-GTCGCAAGCTTGCTGCAGAGTTAGAAGCGCTCTACGGAGACATAGATGC-3′ and 5′-GCTGAGAGCTCGAGGTGTGCATCTTGAACACTGAATGAGGTAAAGGGAC-3′) were designed according to Ovis aries COX-2 cDNA (GenBankTM accession number U68486) and used to amplify a 300-nucleotide fragment from O. aries genomic DNA that included the codon for residue 513. Genomic DNA was isolated from ram seminal vesicle tissue with a DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's specifications. The primers encoded for the addition of HinDIII and SacI restriction sites (underlined above). These enzymes were used to subclone the PCR product into the pBS+ vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for amplification and subsequent sequencing. 2-AG was built into the protein coordinates of uninhibited mCOX-2 (Protein Data Bank code5COX). All amino acid positions were fixed except for the side chains of Arg-120, Arg-513, Glu-524, and Tyr-355. The glycerol ester moiety of 2-AG was restrained within 3.6 Å from the hydrogen bond donor/acceptor groups of Arg-513, Arg-120, and Glu-524. The Tyr-385 hydroxyl group was restrained within 3.6 Å from C-13 to ensure a productive conformation for oxygenation. The complexes were energy minimized for 1000 iterations using a conjugate gradient in the consistent valence forcefield. Molecular dynamic simulations were then run on the energy minimized assemblies for 1000 iterations at 300 K. All simulations were performed using the Discover module of Insight II 2000 with a R12000 Silicon Graphics Octane work station. Wild-type and mutant COX-2 enzymes were expressed in insect cells and then purified by ion exchange and gel filtration. The mutations were made in enzyme residues throughout the cyclooxygenase active site with particular attention paid to amino acids implicated in arachidonic acid and 2-AG binding (Fig.1). All of the proteins were shown by densitometric scanning of SDS-polyacrylamide gels to be at least 80% pure with the following exceptions: W387F (50%) and Y504F (60%). COX activity was determined by oxygen uptake. This necessitated the use of purified proteins to minimize possible hydrolysis of 2-AG to arachidonic acid by contaminating esterases/lipases. Analyses of COX reaction product profiles typically employ radiolabeled arachidonic acid substrate and take advantage of the availability of all necessary synthetic standards. The expense and technical difficulties associated with the synthesis of the requisite quantity of radiolabeled 2-AG prevented a similar strategy from being employed in these studies. Thus, products were identified and quantified by LC/MS analysis. Fig. 2 shows a typical LC/MS chromatogram for wild-type mCOX-2 incubated with 2-AG. In both COX isoforms, Arg-120, Tyr-355, and Glu-524 participate in a hydrogen bonding network that forms a constriction at the bottom of the substrate (and inhibitor) binding site (17Luong C.

Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). In addition to forming the constriction, these residues play a role in binding the polar carboxylate of both arachidonic acid and acidic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (19Bhattacharyya D.K.

Science. 2000; 289: 1933-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). To identify interactions between these residues and 2-AG, site-directed mutants of mCOX-2 were generated, including R120Q and R120A, Y355F and Y355A, and E524L. The site-directed mutants R120Q, Y355F, and E524L displayed modestly reduced capacities to oxygenate arachidonic acid at high substrate concentrations (<2.5-fold reductions) (Fig. 3). However, the R120Q and E524L mutants demonstrated ∼9- and 7-fold reductions in 2-AG oxygenation rates, respectively, when compared with wild-type enzyme (Fig. 3). In contrast, although Y355F oxygenated arachidonic acid at approximately half the rate of wild-type enzyme, 2-AG oxygenation remained essentially unaffected (Fig. 3). A role for Glu-524 in 2-AG oxygenation is further supported by the demonstration that the E524L mutant generates a smaller proportion of PG-G products in comparison with wild-type enzyme (Table I). In contrast, Tyr-355 mutants actually generate a greater proportion of PG-G products in comparison with wild-type enzyme (Table I). Taken together, these results suggest that both Arg-120 and Glu-524 are critical residues in facilitating 2-AG oxygenation and that Glu-524 plays a role in establishing or maintaining a substrate conformation that is amenable to cyclization to PG-G products. Tyr-355 appears to be relatively uninvolved in 2-AG oxygenation because mutations in this residue do not detract from 2-AG oxygenation rates or PG-G formation.Table INormalized ratio of PG-G to HETE-G products of 2-AG oxygenation by mCOX-2 enzymesEnzymeRatioWild type1.0 ± 0.1R120A1.1 ± 0.1R120Q1.1 ± 0.2Y348F0.90 ± 0.07V349A<0.11-ap < 0.01 (Student'st test).V349L0.15 ± 0.021-ap < 0.01 (Student'st test).V349I1.2 ± 0.1Y355A1.2 ± 0.1Y355F1.5 ± 0.11-bp < 0.05 (Student'st test).W387F<0.11-ap < 0.01 (Student'st test).L503F1-cCOX-2 → COX-1 mutations are in bold.0.84 ± 0.08Y504F1.4 ± 0.11-bp < 0.05 (Student'st test).R513H1.1 ± 0.2R513H/V523I0.88 ± 0.04V523I0.76 ± 0.02V523I/R513H/V434I0.57 ± 0.081-bp < 0.05 (Student'st test).E524L0.39 ± 0.071-bp < 0.05 (Student'st test).A527V0.6 ± 0.1S530A0.52 ± 0.021-bp < 0.05 (Student'st test).S530M<0.11-ap < 0.01 (Student'st test).L531A0.21 ± 0.021-ap < 0.01 (Student'st test).L531V0.33 ± 0.031-ap < 0.01 (Student'st test).L531I0.69 ± 0.08The PG-G to HETE-G product ratio was obtained by analyzing products by LC/MS and was calculated by dividing the area of peaks corresponding to PGE2-G and PGD2-G (m/z 449, M + Na+) by the area of peaks corresponding to 11- and 15-HETE-G (m/z 417, M + Na+) followed by normalization to the ratio of products generated by wild-type enzyme.

Previous investigations have identified the COX-2 side pocket as a structural determinant of the isoform selectivity observed for 2-AG oxygenation (13Kozak K.R. Rowlinson S.W. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33744-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The COX-2 side pocket is an additional solvent accessible region off the main cyclooxygenase active site formed by the conserved change of Ile-523 in COX-1 for the sterically less demanding Val-523 in COX-2 (17Luong C. Miller A. Barnett J. Chow J. Ramesha C. Browner M.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 927-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 24Kurumbail R.G. Stevens A.M. Gierse J.K. McDonald J.J.

In addition, COX-1 and COX-2 differ in this region at positions 434 and 513. In human and ovine COX-1, these residues are Ile-434 and His-513, and in all COX-2 genes reported to date these residues are Val-434 and Arg-513 with a single exception; the reported ovine COX-2 sequence encodes for an alanine at position 513 (Fig.4 A) (25Zhang V.V. O'Sullivan M. Hussain H. Roswit W.T. Holtzman M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To identify the side pocket residue(s) responsible for the COX-2 selectivity of 2-AG oxygenation, site-directed mCOX-2 mutants were generated incorporating conserved COX-2 → COX-1 changes. As expected, all side pocket mutants efficiently oxygenated arachidonic acid (Fig.5). Investigations into 2-AG oxygenation began with Val-523 because this residue dictates the COX-2 selectivity of diarylheterocycle inhibitors such as rofecoxib and celecoxib; the V523I mutant enzyme is resistant to inhibition by these inhibitors (26Gierse J.K.

Kulmacz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19134-19139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Substitution of Ile for Val-523 only modestly reduced the 2-AG oxygenation rate (Fig. 5). However, substitution of His for Arg-513 markedly reduced the rate of 2-AG metabolism (Fig. 5). In support of a critical role for Arg-513 and minimal involvement of Val-523 in 2-AG turnover, the double mutant incorporating both changes was essentially indistinguishable from the R513H mutant enzyme (Fig. 5). In fact, all enzymes examined that did not contain Arg at position 513, including wild-type COX-1 and the triple mutant V523I/R513H/V434I, showed dramatically reduced activity toward the endocannabinoid (Fig. 5). Thus, Arg-513 appears, in part, to dictate the isoform selectivity observed for COX metabolism of 2-AG.Figure 5Oxygenation of arachidonic acid and 2-AG by side pocket mutants of COX-2. Initial O2 uptake rates by wild-type and mutant murine COX-2 enzymes (200 nm) and wild-type ovine COX-1 (150 nm) with arachidonic acid (100 µm) and 2-AG (200 µm) are shown and are normalized to the initial rate of O2 uptake for arachidonic acid with wild-type enzyme (mean ± S.E., n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These and prior results led to the hypothesis that a capacity to metabolize 2-AG represented an important evolutionary impetus for COX-2 enzymes. To conclude that endocannabinoid metabolism represents a fundamental COX-2 function, residues critical for endocannabinoid oxygenase activity should be conserved in all COX-2 enzymes. Consequently, Arg-513 would be expected to be universally conserved. The residue at position 513 is Arg in all COX-2 sequences from teleosts to human except for sheep, which contains an Ala (25Zhang V.V. O'Sullivan M. Hussain H. Roswit W.T. Holtzman M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We sought to confirm the identity of the amino acid at position 513 of sheep COX-2 by PCR analysis of sheep seminal vesicle genomic DNA. Using the reported sheep COX-2 cDNA sequence as a guide, PCR primers were designed which, upon amplification, would provide a 300-base pair fragment spanning the codon for residue 513. PCR amplification of sheep genomic DNA and subcloning of the subsequent products provided multiple clones containing the expected size fragment. Sequencing of three unique clones revealed that residue 513 is an Arg encoded by CGT (Fig.4 B). Thus, Arg-513 appears to be conserved in all known COX-2 genes, supporting the assertion that this residue may be critical for COX-2 function. Taken together these results suggest that three polar residues within the COX-2 active site, Arg-120, Arg-513, and Glu-524, play critical roles in promoting 2-AG oxygenation. This endocannabinoid contains three distinct hydrogen bond donor/acceptors including the two primary alcohols and the ester carbonyl. Directed by the results of the site-directed mutagenesis studies, a model for 2-AG binding to COX-2 was developed. Distance restraints were imposed between the three implicated polar residues in COX-2 and the glycerol moiety of 2-AG, and molecular dynamic simulations were performed to optimize substrate-enzyme interactions. These simulations resulted in the positioning of the ester carbonyl between Arg-120 and Tyr-355. The calculated distances of the 2-AG carbonyl oxygen from the closest Arg-120 guanidinium nitrogen and Tyr-355 hydroxyl groups were 3.3 and 2.9 angstroms, respectively. The primary alcohols of 2-AG adopted a conformation that suggests chelation of the Arg-513 guanidinium group (Fig. 6). The distances between the two alcohols of 2-AG and the closest Arg-513 guanidinium nitrogen were measured to be 2.9 angstroms and 3.2 angstroms. One of these primary alcohols was located only 3.2 angstroms from the carboxylate moiety of Glu-524. As shown in Fig. 6, COX-2 accommodates a 2-AG binding conformation that provides for close interaction between each of the three polar enzyme residues implicated in 2-AG metabolism and hydrogen bond donors/acceptors of the endocannabinoid. Both COX isoforms contain Leu at position 531 (Fig. 4 A). In COX-2, Leu-531 is positioned directly across from the side pocket in the cyclooxygenase active site (Fig. 6) (17Luong C. Miller A. Barnett J. Chow J. Ramesha C. Browner M.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 927-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 24Kurumbail R.G. Stevens A.M. Gierse J.K. McDonald J.J. Stegeman R.A.

Crystallographic analysis of complexes of COX-1 with arachidonic acid indicate that Leu-531 is beyond van der Waals' contact distances from substrate; however, site-directed mutagenesis studies demonstrate that this residue promotes high affinity, productive binding of arachidonic acid within the active site (23Malkowski M.G. Ginell S.L. Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1933-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 29Thuresson E.D. Lakkides K.M. Rieke C.J. Sun Y. Wingerd B.A. Micielli R. Mulichak A.M.

Reduction of the hydrophobic side chain length at position 531 in COX-1 affects the positioning of arachidonic acid near Arg-120 and substantially decreases oxygenation rates (29Thuresson E.D. Lakkides K.M. Rieke C.J. Sun Y. Wingerd B.A. Micielli R. Mulichak A.M. Malkowski M.G. Garavito R.M. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10347-10357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The demonstrated role of the COX-2 side pocket, and Arg-513 in particular, in 2-AG oxygenation suggests that this endocannabinoid may bind nearer the side pocket and consequently, further from Leu-531 than arachidonic acid. To test the hypothesis that Leu-531 may have a less significant role in positioning 2-AG than that seen with arachidonic acid, three mutations (L531I, L531V, and L531A) were made in mCOX-2 to reduce the size of the hydrophobic side chain. The ability of these mutant enzymes to oxygenate both arachidonic acid and 2-AG decreased markedly. However, the deleterious effects of Leu-531 mutations were less pronounced with the endocannabinoid substrate. In addition, as the side chain of residue 531 decreased in size, the ratio of 2-AG/arachidonic acid oxygenation rates increased (Fig.7). Thus, changes in Leu-531 of COX-2 affect 2-AG oxygenation rates less significantly than arachidonic acid oxygenation rates. These results are consistent with our model in which 2-AG is displaced toward the side pocket of COX-2 and away from Leu-531 relative to arachidonic acid (Fig. 6). In fact, modeling results positioned C-1 of 2-AG 7.3 angstroms from the closest Leu-531 methyl group. In comparison, the crystal structure of arachidonic acid bound in COX-1 reveals a distance of 4.6 angstroms from C-1 to the closest Leu-531 methyl group (23Malkowski M.G. Ginell S.L. Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. Science. 2000; 289: 1933-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Arachidonic acid binds within COX enzymes in an L-shaped conformation placing the 13-pro-S-hydrogen close to Tyr-385 and the ω-end near Gly-533 (14Rowlinson S.W. Crews B.C. Lanzo C.A. Marnett L.J. J.

Previous investigations demonstrated that 2-AG binds within COX-2 in a similar conformation; neither the G533V nor the Y385F mutant COX-2 enzymes oxygenated 2-AG (13Kozak K.R. Rowlinson S.W.

Residues Ala-527 and Val-349 line the hydrophobic L-shaped channel adjacent to Ser-530 (Fig. 6). Ala-527 and Val-349 are within van der Waals' distances of arachidonic acid, and Val-349 has been implicated in stabilizing a conformation of arachidonic acid that is optimal for cyclization (23Malkowski M.G.

Mutations were made in COX-2 at positions 527 and 349 to examine whether these residues also affect 2-AG oxygenation. The mutant enzymes were incubated with 2-AG, and the products were analyzed by LC/MS. The A527V and V349I mutations did not show significant increases in monooxygenated products (Table I). However, V349A and V349L did show relative increases in monooxygenated products (Table I). V349L also displayed a dramatic shift in HETE-G regiochemistry, from C-11 to C-15 (Fig. 8). Therefore, one of the methyl groups of Val-349 seems to interact with 2-AG to promote PG-G generation. These findings are consistent with arachidonic acid product profiles from mutant COX-1 enzymes (29Thuresson E.D. Lakkides K.M. Rieke C.J. Sun Y. Wingerd B.A. Micielli R. Mulichak A.M. Malkowski M.G.

Both 2-AG oxygenation and 15-HETE generation by acetylated-COX-2 are dependent, in part, on the COX-2 side pocket, and the possibility existed that these two overlapping spatial requirements would prevent 2-AG oxygenation by acetylated-COX-2 (35Rowlinson S.W.

Neither enzyme generated a significant amount of PGE2-G or PGD2-G (data not shown and Table I). However, HETE-G products were observed, and regiochemical analysis demonstrated that oxygenation occurred preferentially at C-15 (Fig. 9). Thus, 2-AG and arachidonic acid are both capable of adopting a conformation in the active site of aspirin-acetylated COX-2, which leads to selective C-15 oxygenation in addition to the more typical conformation in unmodified enzyme that leads preferentially to prostaglandin formation. COX-2 oxygenation of anandamide and 2-AG to generate PG ethanolamides and glyceryl PGs has been reported (12Yu M. Ives D. Ramesha C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21181-21186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 13Kozak K.R. Rowlinson S.W. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33744-33749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). However, the stereochemistry of the products has not been conclusively established. Structural changes in the active site of cyclooxygenase enzymes can lead to altered product profiles and product stereochemistry. As a result, product stereochemical analysis provides an additional test of substrate-enzyme interactions. In addition, PG and HETE stereoisomers generally possess dramatically different biological activities and/or potencies. For example, 15(R)-PGF2α displays negligible binding to rat vascular smooth muscle cells and binds ovine luteal cell FP receptors with 15-fold less affinity when compared with the natural stereoisomer (37Balapure A.K. Rexroad C.E. Kawada K. Watt D.S. Fitz T.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 2375-2381Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 38Hanasaki K. Kishi M. Arita H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4871-4875Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, 8(S)-HETE activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α ∼10-fold more potently than 8(R)-HETE (39Yu K. Bayona W. Kallen C.B. Harding H.P. Ravera C.P. McMahon G. Brown M. Lazar M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23975-23983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Consequently, we investigated the relative stereochemistry of PG and HETE glyceryl esters generated by COX-2 metabolism of 2-AG. PGF2-G was obtained by rapidly reducing the endoperoxide PGH2-G generated in COX-2 incubations with 2-AG. Following saponification to generate the PGF2-free acid, the sample was analyzed by thin layer chromatography and compared with PGF2α and diastereomers (Fig. 10). The sample generated from 2-AG eluted as a single spot with an identicalR f as PGF2α. Under the chromatographic conditions employed, PGF2β, 8-iso-PGF2α, 11β-PGF2α, and 15(R)-PGF2α were readily distinguished from PGF2α. Thus, 2-AG oxygenation by COX-2 provides PG-Gs with the same relative stereochemistry found for arachidonic acid-derived PGs. HETE-G stereochemistry also was investigated and found to be similar to that observed with HETEs generated by arachidonic acid oxygenation (15-HETE-G, 40 ± 2% R; 11-HETE-G, > 99% R; mean ± S.E.). The present results suggest that the COX-2 active site accommodates the endocannabinoid, 2-AG, in a productive conformation similar to arachidonic acid; however, subtle differences have been identified. The endocannabinoid glyceryl moiety interacts with three polar residues in the COX-2 active site, Arg-120, Arg-513, and Glu-524. The universal presence of Arg at position 513 in the side pocket of COX-2 enzymes and its absence in mammalian COX-1 enzymes explains, in part, the isoform selectivity observed for 2-AG metabolism. When compared with the binding of arachidonic acid in the COX-1 active site, the polar terminus of 2-AG shifts toward the COX-2 side pocket and Arg-513 and away from Leu-531. Despite this difference, 2-AG, like arachidonic acid, is oxygenated by aspirin-acetylated COX-2 to provide 15-HETE-G and is bis-dioxygenated by the unmodified enzyme to provide PG-Gs with the natural prostaglandin stereochemistry. These findings support the hypothesis that 2-AG is a natural COX-2 substrate and that the active site of this enzyme has evolved to promote efficient 2-AG turnover."
https://openalex.org/W2017976029,"Abstract Dfp1/Him1 protein of fission yeast,Schizosaccharomyces pombe, encodes the regulatory subunit for Hsk1 kinase, a homologue of budding yeast Cdc7 kinase essential for initiation and progression of the S phase of the cell cycle. This protein binds and activates Hsk1 kinase, which phosphorylates the MCM2 protein. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the Cdc7 regulatory subunits from various eukaryotes revealed the presence of three small stretches of conserved amino acid sequences, namely Dbf4 motifs N, M, and C. We report here that the Dbf4 motif M, a unique proline-rich motif, and the Dbf4 motif C, a C2H2-type zinc finger motif, are essential for mitotic functions of Dfp1/Him1 protein as well as for full-level activation of Hsk1 kinase. In vitro, a small segment containing the Dbf4 motif M or C alone binds to and partially activates Hsk1. Co-expression of these two segments augments the extent of activation. Furthermore, a fused polypeptide containing only Dbf4 motifs M and C without any spacer can activate Hsk1 and is capable of rescuing the growth defect ofhim1 null cells. Insertion of a long stretch of amino acids between the motif M and motif C can be tolerated for mitotic functions. On the other hand, internal deletion of Dbf4 motif N, which has some similarity with the BRCA C-terminal domain motif, results in a defect in hydroxyurea-induced checkpoint responses and sensitivity to methyl methane sulfonate, yet mitotic functions and kinase activation are intact. In one-hybrid assays with budding yeast Dbf4, motif N mutants exhibit reduced interaction with a replication origin. Our observations suggest the molecular architecture of Cdc7·Dbf4-related kinase complexes at the origins, in which they are tethered to replication machinery through Dbf4 motif N and the catalytic subunits are activated through bipartite binding of Dbf4 motifs M and C of the regulatory subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1991031899,"We have recently reported that transfer of the domain IIS6 region from rapidly inactivating R-type (α1E) calcium channels to slowly inactivating L-type (α1C) calcium channel confers rapid inactivation (Stotz, S. C., Hamid, J., Spaetgens, R. L., Jarvis, S. E., and Zamponi, G. W. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 24575–24582). Here we have identified individual amino acid residues in the IIS6 regions that are responsible for these effects. In this region, α1C and α1Echannels differ in seven residues, and exchanging five of those residues individually or in combination did not significantly affect inactivation kinetics. By contrast, replacement of residues Phe-823 or Ile-829 of α1C with the corresponding α1E residues significantly accelerated inactivation rates and, when substituted concomitantly, approached the rapid inactivation kinetics of R-type channels. A systematic substitution of these residues with a series of other amino acids revealed that decreasing side chain size at position 823 accelerates inactivation, whereas a dependence of the inactivation kinetics on the degree of hydrophobicity could be observed at position 829. Although these point mutations facilitated rapid entry into the inactivated state of the channel, they had little to no effect on the rate of recovery from inactivation. This suggests that the development of and recovery from inactivation are governed by separate structural determinants. Finally, the effects of mutations that accelerated α1C inactivation could still be antagonized following coexpression of the rat β2a subunit or by domain I–II linker substitutions that produce ultra slow inactivation of wild type channels, indicating that the inactivation kinetics seen with the mutants remain subject to regulation by the domain I–II linker. Overall, our results provide novel insights into a complex process underlying calcium channel inactivation. We have recently reported that transfer of the domain IIS6 region from rapidly inactivating R-type (α1E) calcium channels to slowly inactivating L-type (α1C) calcium channel confers rapid inactivation (Stotz, S.

Overall, our results provide novel insights into a complex process underlying calcium channel inactivation. base pair analysis of variance The voltage-dependent inactivation of ionic channels is a fundamental biological process that prevents the breakdown of ionic gradients and determines action potential duration and the refractory period of excitable tissues (2Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1994Google Scholar). In calcium channels, this process serves several unique purposes. First, it is a key mechanism by which calcium channels are able to achieve a tight regulation of internal calcium levels and thus the temporal precision of calcium signals. This is of particular significance in view of the pivotal role calcium plays as a cytoplasmic messenger (3Dunlap K. Luebke J.I. Turner T.J. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 89-98Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar, 4Sutton K.G. McRory J.E. Guthrie H. Murphy T.H. Snutch T.P. Nature. 1999; 401: 800-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Along these lines, calcium channel inactivation helps to prevent the build up of excessive and cytotoxic levels of intracellular calcium (5Choi D.W. Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 465-469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar, 6McConkey D.J. Nicotera P. Hartzell P. Bellomo G. Wyllie A.H. Orrenius S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the inactivation of calcium currents in nerve terminals appears to contribute to the short term depression of neurosecretion (7Branchaw J.L. Banks M.I. Jackson M.B. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5772-5781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Forsythe I.D. Tsujimoto T. Barnes-Davies M. Cuttle M.F. Takahashi T. Neuron. 1998; 20: 797-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Finally, a number of pharmacological agents, including many clinically used calcium channel therapeutics, preferentially interact with inactivated channels (9Sun J. Triggle D.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1995; 274: 419-426PubMed Google Scholar, 10Jimenez C. Bourinet E. Leuranguer V. Richard S. Snutch T.P. Nargeot J. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding the molecular determinants that govern this process is of fundamental importance. Whereas the basic principles underlying fast inactivation of voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels have been elucidated (for review see Ref. 11Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar), the detailed mechanisms underlying the voltage-dependent inactivation of calcium channels have remained somewhat enigmatic. In potassium channels, an ∼20-amino acid cluster of residues in the N-terminal region acts to physically occlude the channel pore (12Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Neuron. 1991; 7: 547-556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 13Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 29-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 14Demo S.D. Yellen G. Neuron. 1991; 7: 743-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), thus preventing potassium influx (termed ball and chain mechanism). In sodium channels, the cytoplasmic loop between domains III and IV of the α subunit serves as a pore-occluding inactivation particle (termed hinged-lid mechanism) (15West J.W. Patton D.E. Scheuer T.

In voltage-gated calcium channels, it has been known for some time that the β subunit that interacts with the α1subunit domain I–II linker region exerts a pronounced modulatory effect on inactivation kinetics (18Lacerda A.E.

However, point mutations in a number of locations throughout the calcium channel sequence can exert dramatic effects on inactivation rates (28Zhang J.F. Ellinor P.T. Aldrich R.W. Tsien R.W.

We have recently reported that multiple transmembrane domains contribute to the inactivation process (33Spaetgens R.L. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22428-22436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our work has revealed that insertion of either the domain IIS6 or the domain IIIS6 region of rapidly inactivating R-type (α1E) channels into normally slowly inactivating L-type (α1C) calcium channels is sufficient to induce rapid inactivation of L-type channels (1Stotz S.C. Hamid J. Spaetgens R.L. Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24575-24582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Here we have identified a pair of amino acid residues in the domain IIS6 region that are key inactivation determinants of α1C-Phe-823 and Ile-829. We show that amino acid substitutions in these two positions to the corresponding α1E residues are capable of inducing rapid, α1E-like inactivation rates. A systematic replacement of these residues with a series of amino acids reveals amino acid side chain size in position 823 as a major inactivation determinant, with the α1CF823A mutant producing inactivation kinetics that approach those of T-type calcium channels. Our data, however, also show that this effect can be greatly attenuated by either coexpression of the β2a subunit or by manipulation of the domain I–II linker structure. Our data are consistent with a mechanism in which the domain I–II linker may serve as a physical inactivation gate structure that functionally interacts with the pore lining S6 segments to induce inactivation. We have previously engineered a series of silent restriction enzyme sites into the wild type rat brain α1C subunit in the pMT2 expression vector (1Stotz S.C. Hamid J. Spaetgens R.L. Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24575-24582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 33Spaetgens R.L. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22428-22436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This construct was modified further as follows. An SpeI site in the 3′-untranslated region region of the channel was eliminated using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) using the complete expression construct as the template. An ∼2.2-kilobase pairSbfI-NotI fragment containing the mutation was then excised and reintroduced into the original full-length pMT2/α1C cDNA. The mutatedSbfI-NotI fragment was completely sequenced to confirm the removal of the SpeI site and the absence of errors. By using a similar strategy, a silent MluI site was then introduced into this modified construct 129 bp1 upstream of the domain IIS6 region. Subsequently, an ∼1-kilobase pairBsrGI-SpeI fragment containing the silentMluI site was isolated and then reintroduced into the construct lacking the SpeI site in the 3′-untranslated region. The BsrGI-SpeI fragment was sequenced in its entirety to confirm the presence of the MluI site and the absence of other errors. The resulting pMT2/α1CcDNA construct encoding a wild type α1C channel thus carried a unique MluI site 129 bp upstream of the IIS6 region, and an endogenous unique SpeI site 570 bp 3′ to the end of the segment, and was used as the template for all mutagenesis of residues of the domain IIS6 region. When possible, each further change incorporated the silent addition or elimination of a diagnostic restriction site such that mutated sequence could be readily identified via restriction enzyme digestion. SphI sites were used in the creation of V815S and C816A; FokI for I821V;AflIII for I829T; BglII for F823Q, F823E, and F823K; and NdeI for F823T, F823S, F823C, F823Y, F823G, F823D, F823R, F823A, F823I, and F823V. If a diagnostic restriction site could not be easily designed, the mutations were confirmed by immediate sequencing (ABI Prism BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (PE Applied Biosystems); University of Calgary Sequencing). This was necessary in the creation of I824L, C825F, I829S, I829Y, I829G, I829A, I829F, I829V, and α1C IIS6E T823F/T829I. To ensure that the rest of the channel was identical to wild type, the unique MluI and SpeI sites were employed to excise the mutated sequence and to reintroduce it into template DNA encoding the channel. The MluI-SpeI fragments containing the introduced mutations were subsequently sequenced in every case to confirm that only the intended mutation had taken place and to rule out mutagenesis errors. To create the partial domain I–II linker chimera (CecCCC), we utilized previously constructed domain chimeras (33Spaetgens R.L. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22428-22436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). An NarI restriction site was introduced 54 bp before the end of the domain I–II linker region of the CECC chimera (i.e. domains I, III, and IV of α1C and domain II and the domain I–II linker of α1E) in a position complementary to a naturally occurring NarI site in the α1C I–II linker. Domain I and part of the I–II linker region of this CECC chimera were excised with KpnI (5′-multicloning site) andNarI and ligated into the wild type α1Cchannel, yielding a chimera of mostly α1C origin but containing about 75% of the domain I–II linker region of α1E. To create the F823A mutant of this chimera, an ∼3-kilobase pair KpnI-BsrGI fragment was ligated into α1CF823A (this BsrGI site immediately precedes the domain IIS6 region). Human embryonic kidney tsA-201 cells were grown to 80% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (at 5% CO2 and 37 °C). Cells were split via trypsin EDTA and plated on glass coverslips at 5–10% confluence ∼12 h before transfection. Prior to transfection, cells were washed with fresh medium, and the calcium phosphate method was used for transfection of cDNAs encoding for wild type and mutant/chimeric calcium channel α1 subunits plus ancillary α2-δ and β subunits, as well as the reporter gene-enhanced green fluorescent protein (CLONTECH). Unless stated otherwise, the β1b subunit was used in all transfections. Approximately 12 h after transfection, cells were washed, stored at 37 °C for 12 more hours, and then moved into a 5% CO2 incubator at 28 °C. The cells were maintained under those conditions for 24–72 h, and then individual coverslips were transferred to a 3-cm culture dish for electrophysiological recordings. Cells were bathed in a recording solution consisting of 20 mm BaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 40 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 mm glucose, 65 mm CsCl (pH 7.2 with tetraethylammonium-OH). Whole cell patch clamp recordings were performed with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) connected to a personal computer equipped with pCLAMP version 6.0. Patch pipettes (Sutter borosilicate glass, BF150-86-15) were pulled using a Sutter P-87 puller and fire-polished using a Narashige Microforge. When filled with internal pipette solution contained 108 mm cesium methane sulfonate, 4 mm MgCl2, 9 mm EGTA, 9 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 with CsOH), pipettes typically showed resistances of 3–4 megohms. The buffering of internal calcium together with the use of barium as the carrier ion allows us to isolate voltage-dependent inactivation without contamination from calcium-sensitive inactivation (33Spaetgens R.L. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22428-22436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Data were filtered at 1 kHz and recorded directly onto the hard drive of the computer. Series resistance and capacitance were compensated, but no on-line leak subtraction was used. Unless stated otherwise, currents were evoked by stepping from −100 mV to various test potentials. Steady state inactivation curves were obtained by maintaining the cells at various holding potentials for 5 s prior to stepping to a test depolarization of +10 mV. Recovery from inactivation was determined by providing a conditioning pulse from a holding potential of −100 to 10 mV for 1 s followed by a test pulse of 10 mV for 40 ms. The time interval between the conditioning pulse and the test pulse was increased in 10-ms increments until the 100-ms interval point. Hereafter, the duration between conditioning pulse and the test pulse was increased in 100-ms intervals. In the period between the conditioning pulse and the test pulse, the holding potential was returned to −100 mV. The raw data were analyzed using Clampfit software. The time course of inactivation was fitted monoexponentially, and as a second measure of inactivation rate, the percentage of inactivation that had developed during a 125-ms test depolarization was used. Steady state inactivation curves were fitted with standard Boltzmann relations using Sigmaplot software (Jandel Scientific). Half-activation potentials were estimated from the whole cell current voltage relations by means of Boltzmann fits. The time course of recovery from inactivation was obtained by biexponential fits to the amplitude normalized data or, in the case of α1E, with a monoexponential fit. All figures were generated in Sigmaplot. Numbers in parentheses reflect individual experiments that typically were obtained in multiple transfections. Error bars given reflect standard errors. Student's t tests were carried out between α1C wild type data and individual mutations within the IIS6 segment to ascertain the statistical significance of the results (p < 0.05). To determine the significance of differences in data obtained in the characterization of IIS6 positions Phe-823 and Ile-829 one-way ANOVAs were performed and followed by the appropriate post-ANOVA test (Student-Newman-Keuls method, p < 0.05). We have recently reported that replacement of the domain IIS6 region of the (L-type) α1Csubunit with the corresponding region in α1E was sufficient to confer the rapid inactivation rates seen with α1E (1Stotz S.C. Hamid J. Spaetgens R.L. Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24575-24582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig.1, A and B, the α1C(IIS6E) chimera displays rapid inactivation kinetics that qualitatively approach those of wild type α1Echannels. The domain IIS6 regions of these two channel isoforms contain 25 amino acid residues, of which 18 are completely conserved (Fig.1 C), indicating that one, or a combination of the remaining seven residues, must be responsible for the effects observed in Fig. 1,A and B. To determine the role of each of these seven amino acids, we individually replaced α1C residues of the IIS6 regions with the corresponding residues found in α1E, and we then assessed their effects on inactivation.

In addition, for each mutant, the half-activation potential was estimated from whole cell current-voltage relations, and the half-inactivation potential was determined from steady state inactivation curves (see TableI).Table ISummary of half-activation and half-inactivation potentials for domain IIS6 mutantsConstructV 1/2,activationnV 1/2,inactivationnα1C−0.43 ± 1.7212−21.23 ± 1.7010α1C(IIS6E)−9.43 ± 2.241-aStatistical significance (p < 0.05) relative to α1C control is shown.

Values are significantly different from α1C,p < 0.05 (Student's t test). Open table in a new tab Figs. 2and3illustrate the effects of individual point mutations in the domain IIS6 region of α1C. Substitutions of residues Val-815, Cys-816, and Cys-825 did not significantly affect inactivation of α1C(+β1b+α2-δ) calcium channels, whereas mutagenesis of residue Ile-821 to the corresponding α1E residue (valine) appeared to produce a significant slowing of inactivation rather than acceleration toward α1E-like kinetics. Mutagenesis of residue 824 to leucine statistically and significantly increased the net percentage of inactivation that occurred over 125 ms (see Fig. 3 A for detail); however, this was due to a slightly smaller non-inactivating fraction of the α1C current. The time constant of inactivation of this mutant did not differ significantly from that observed with wild type channels (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that this position contributes only in a minor fashion to the observed differences between α1C and α1E calcium channels. By contrast, replacement of residues Phe-823 or Ile-829 with the threonines found in the corresponding positions in α1E mediated a statistically significant (p < 0.05) acceleration of inactivation kinetics, which was maintained over a wide range of test potentials but which did not completely approach those seen with wild type α1Ecalcium channels or the α1C(IIS6E) chimera. Hence, no single residue was able to account for the observations obtained with the α1C(IIS6E) chimera.Figure 3Summary of the effects of the amino acid substitutions in α1C in form ofbar graphs using either the percentage of inactivation over a 125-ms test depolarization to +10 mV (A) or the time constant of inactivation measured from mono-exponential fits to raw data such as those shown in Fig. 2(B). Error bars denote S.E., andnumbers in parentheses indicate the numbers of experiments, and the asterisks reflect statistical significance (p < 0.05) relative to the α1C control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine if the effects of the F823T and I829T substitutions were additive, we generated a double α1C(F823T/I829T) mutant and examined its inactivation profile. As seen from Fig.4A, the double mutant displayed rapid inactivation kinetics that did not differ significantly from the α1C(IIS6E) chimera or wild type α1E calcium channels over a wide range of test potentials, indicating that the combination of these two residues is sufficient to confer rapid α1E-like inactivation kinetics onto α1C. To corroborate our data further, we produced a quintuple mutant in which all of the domain IIS6 residues of α1C except for Phe-823 and Ile-829 were mutated to the corresponding α1E residues. As shown in Fig. 4,B and C, this mutant produced inactivation rates that did not differ significantly from those of wild type α1C channels, thereby further supporting the notion that only residues 823 and 829 are responsible for the effects of the α1E domain IIS6 region on L-type calcium channel inactivation. As shown in Table I, the individual substitutions mediated only minor effects on the voltage dependence of activation, indicating that the observed effects did not secondarily arise from a change in activation gating. Furthermore, with the exception of the I829T construct, the half-inactivation potentials observed with the mutant channels did not differ significantly from those of the wild type α1Cchannels. The observation that the F823T/I829T double mutant inactivated with a time course comparable to α1Echannels, but displayed ∼50 mV more positive half-inactivation potential, indicates that the rate and voltage dependence of inactivation can be governed by separate structural determinants (but see below). To gain a more detailed understanding of the roles of residues 823 and 829 in the inactivation process, we replaced these residues with a number of different amino acids of varying size and polarity, and we examined their effects on the functional properties of the channel. Fig. 5shows the effects of substitutions of Phe-823 with a number of non-polar amino acid residues. As seen from the figure, replacement of the phenylalanine with either glycine or alanine results in very rapid inactivation kinetics that approach the rates seen with T-type calcium channels (34Akaike N. Kanaide H. Kuga T. Nakamura M. Sadoshima J. Tomoike H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1989; 416: 141-160Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 35Perez-Reyes E. Cribbs L.L. Daud A. Lacerda A.E. Barclay J.

Hence, a single amino acid substitution in a slowly inactivating channel is sufficient to accelerate inactivation by almost an order of magnitude. More importantly, there appears to be a clear dependence of the inactivation rates on the size of the amino acid side chain, with smaller residues resulting in faster kinetics than bulkier side chains. Fig. 6examines the effects of polar substitutions on the rate of inactivation. As with the non-polar residues, increasing the size of polar groups resulted in a slowing of inactivation. As evident from the summary of the data in Fig.7, residues with similar size, but differing polarities, yielded similar inactivation rates, indicating that polarity per se is not a major factor in setting the rates of inactivation. However, the presence of a hydrophilic residue in this position appeared to result in rapid inactivation kinetics irrespective of charge or size (Fig. 7), possibly indicating that side chain size, while clearly important,"

The TATAAA element can support high levels of transcription in vivo, whereas the CATAAA element is severely defective for this function. This dramatic functional difference is not likely to be due to a difference in TBP (TATA-binding protein) binding efficiency because protein-DNA complex studies in vitro indicate little difference between the two DNA sequences in the formation and stability of the TBP-DNA complex. In addition, the binding and stability of the TFIIB-TBP-DNA complex is similar for the two elements. In striking contrast, the TFIIA-TBP-DNA complex is significantly less stable on the CATAAA element when compared with the TATAAA element. A role for TFIIA in distinguishing between TATAAA and CATAAA in vivo was tested by fusing a subunit of TFIIA to TBP. We found that fusion of TFIIA to TBP dramatically increases transcription from CATAAA in yeast cells. Taken together, these results indicate that the stability of the TFIIA-TBP complex depends strongly on the sequence of the core promoter element and that the TFIIA-TBP complex plays an important function in recognizing optimal promotersin vivo.

Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 651-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The first step in promoter recognition is binding of TBP (TATA-binding protein) to the TATAAA element (reviewed in Ref. 2Burley S.K. Roeder R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 769-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Recruitment of TBP is a rate-limiting step in transcriptional initiation in vivo at a majority of promoters (3Xiao H. Friesen J.D. Lis J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5757-5761Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 4Chatterjee S. Struhl K. Nature. 1995; 374: 820-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 5Klages N. Strubin M. Nature. 1995; 374: 822-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and promoter occupancy of TBP correlates very well with transcriptional activity (6Kuras L. Struhl K. Nature. 1999; 399: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 7Li X.Y. Virbasius A. Zhu X. Green M.R. Nature. 1999; 399: 605-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The TBP-TATA interaction sets the stage for the nucleation of the remainder of the preinitiation complex, which includes TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH, TFIIJ, and RNA polymerase II (reviewed in Ref. 8Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). TFIIA and TFIIB have each been shown to make direct contacts with TBP and DNA and, in so doing, stabilize the TBP-DNA complex (reviewed in Ref. 9Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, TFIIA and TFIIB promoter occupancy is coordinated with that of TBP (10Kuras L. Kosa P. Mencia M. Struhl K. Science. 2000; 288: 1244-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar); thus interactions between the DNA, TBP, TFIIA, and TFIIB are likely to play an important role in a majority of promotersin vivo. Despite the apparent requirement of the TATAAA sequence in the initiation of RNA polymerase II transcription, many natural eukaryotic core promoters lack recognizable TATA elements but still require TBP for transcription initiation (11Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1187-1197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 12Cormack B.P. Struhl K.

This noncanonical or “TATA-less” subclass includes the promoters of several different types of genes, including the ubiquitously expressed “housekeeping” genes, developmentally regulated genes (growth factors and growth factor receptors), and many oncogenes (14Nothias J.Y. Majumder S. Kaneko K.J. DePamphilis M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22077-22080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 15Smale S.T. Biochim. Biophys.

A. 1989; 86: 5718-5722Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In addition, several instances of multiple, yet functionally distinct elements driving the expression of a single gene have been described in yeast (17Li W.-Z. Sherman F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 666-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18Roy A. Exinger F. Losson R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5257-5270Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 19Struhl K. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1986; 6: 3847-3853Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). For example, the yeast HIS3 gene contains two distinct promoter elements: a canonical TATAAA element (TR) that initiates from +13 and a second element (TC) that lacks the canonical TATAAA sequence, extends over ∼30 base pairs, and initiates from +1 (20Mahadevan S. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4447-4455Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The two tandem yeast HIS3 promoter elements are utilized differentially depending on the overall levels ofHIS3 production (19Struhl K. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1986; 6: 3847-3853Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 21Ponticelli A.S. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2832-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). At low levels of overall transcription, both TC and TR are utilized with approximately equal efficiencies. However, at high levels of transcription, expression from TC increases only slightly, whereas expression from TR shows a large and dramatic increase. Thus, the noncanonical TC element saturates at much lower levels of expression than does the canonical TATA element. The in vivo regulation observed for TC can be mimicked by substituting TC with CATAAA, a sequence with a single base pair change of the first thymine in the TATAAA element to a cytosine (22Iyer V. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7059-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Because CATAAA can functionally replace TCand CATAAA serves as a simpler model than TC for noncanonical core promoters, we utilized TATAAA and CATAAA to study the mechanistic differences between canonical and noncanonical elementsin vitro and in vivo. We find that the TBP-DNA and the TFIIB-TBP-DNA complexes behave very similarly on TATAAA and CATAAA. In contrast, the TFIIA-TBP complex is much less stable on the CATAAA element compared with the TATAAA element. Transcriptional analysis indicates that the CATAAA element is severely defective for supporting high levels of transcription in vivo, but a TFIIA-TBP fusion molecule can restore activity from this element. These results suggest that the stability of the TFIIA-TBP-DNA complex is sensitive to the sequence of the core promoter element and that the TFIIA-TBP complex plays an important role in core promoter recognition and the level of transcriptional expression in vivo. The yeast strain yJS156 is a derivative of KY804 (relevant genotype: MATα ura3-52 trp1-Δ1eu2::PET56 gal2 gcn4-Δ1) (23Hope I.A. Struhl K. Cell. 1986; 46: 885-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), with the chromosomal copy of SPT15 deleted by a two-step knockout. TBP functions are provided by a URA3-marked plasmid containing the TBP promoter, open reading frame, and terminator. Plasmid shuffling on 5-fluoroorotic acid was used to create theTRP1-marked wild type TBP, Toa2-TBP, and TFIIB-TBP fusion strains assayed. The DNA elements used for the in vivo transcription analysis and the in vitro protein DNA interaction studies were 23-base pair oligonucleotides designed from sequences at the promoter of the yeast HIS3 gene. The TATAAA oligo contains a core promoter element identical to the HIS3 TR with the sequence 5′-AATTCCTATAAAGTAATGTGGAG-3′. The CATAAA oligo is identical to TATAAA except that the first thymine in the core element is substituted with a cytosine (5′-AATTCCCATAAAGTAATGTGGAG-3′). To make double stranded probe, a 19-base pair complementary oligonucleotide was synthesized and annealed to the 23-base pair oligo described above leaving an AT-rich overhang on the 5′ end of the probe. Klenow enzyme was used to fill in the single-stranded overhang with 25 µCi of [α-32P]dATP in the presence of 2.0 µmdTTP. The plasmids used for the in vivo transcription analysis were derivatives of YCp86 containing the 2-kilobase fragment from pUC18 including the bla gene and the origin of replication, a 1.9-kilobase fragment of yeast DNA containing cen3 andars1, a 1.1-kilobase fragment containing the URA3gene, and a polylinker. The hybrid HIS3 promoterYCp86-SC3801 (24Chen W. Struhl K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2691-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 25Singer V.L. Wobbe C.R. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 636-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) has the wild type initiation and amino-terminal region of theHIS3 gene fused in frame with a functional Escherichia coli LacZ gene and is used to detect levels of transcriptionin vivo. The promoter region contains a 365-base pairGAL1,10 fragment containing four GAL-4 binding sites fused upstream of the EcoRI-SacI restriction endonuclease sites, between which the TATAAA and CATAAA oligonucleotides (described above) could be inserted. When the two oligos were cloned into this molecule it was renamed pJS3801 (TATAAA) and pJS3803 (CATAAA), respectively. For the experiments measuring activated transcription in vivo, the pJS3801 and pJS3803 constructs (described above) were transformed into yeast strain yJS156. The resulting transformants were used in liquid assays for β-galactosidase activity. The cells were grown in selective medium containing either 2% raffinose or 2% galactose to mid-exponential growth phase (A 600 ≅ 1–2). Enzyme activities were determined in triplicate and normalized to the A600 of the cultures. Quantitative RNA analysis was done by S1 nuclease digestion of ∼50 µg of RNA prepared from cells grown in synthetic complete medium to an A 600 of 0.6 (26Iyer V. Struhl K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5208-5212Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 27Collart M.A. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared by hot phenol extraction and hybridized with 100-fold excess of radiolabeled single-stranded HIS3, DED1, andtRNAw probes and subjected to S1 nuclease digestion. The RNA amounts used in each reaction were normalized to the RNA levels obtained from a probe to the intron of the tryptophan tRNA gene (tRNAW). Untagged, full-length yeast TBP was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) with a pET11a vector (called pYTBP) as described (28Campbell K.M. Ranallo R.T. Stargell L.A. Lumb K.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The soluble fraction was purified over Q, SP, and Heparin HiTrap columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer A (10 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH adjusted to 7.5). TBP flowed through the Q column and was eluted from the SP and heparin columns using linear NaCl gradients in buffer A. Final purification of TBP was by gel filtration with Sephacryl S-100 equilibrated in 100 mm KCl, 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20 mmTris (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. TFIIB was cloned into pET-15b for expression and purification of His-tagged protein from E. coli BL21DE3/PlysS (Novagen). The cells were grown in LB medium at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.7. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration, 0.1 mm) was added, and the cells were incubated for 2 h at 30 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with a 20 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl buffer. Following sonication, the lysate was incubated with shaking at 4 °C with 1 ml of His-bind resin (Novagen). After two consecutive wash steps with buffers containing 20 mm imidizole and 80 mmimidizole, respectively, the His-tagged protein was eluted with buffer containing 200 mm imidizole. The eluate was dialyzed against 100 mm KCl, 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl flouride (EMSA binding buffer without MgCl2).1 The protein was shown to be 80% pure upon staining with Coomassie Blue. Recombinant yeast TFIIA was purified as described (29Ranish J.A. Lane W.S. Hahn S. Science. 1992; 255: 1127-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This procedure involves expressing each subunit, Toa1 and Toa2, in separate strains ofE. coli BL21DE3. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration, 0.1 mm) was added at an optical density of 0.6, and after the cells were ruptured by sonication, insoluble material was collected by centrifugation. The proteins were then denatured in a buffer containing 8 m urea and renatured in the presence of the other subunit. The renatured proteins were dialyzed against 100 mm KCl, 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20 mmTris (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl flouride (EMSA binding buffer without MgCl2). The TFIIA was ∼60% pure as determined by Coomassie staining. Protein-DNA interactions in vitro were studied by incubation of purified proteins with32P-labeled TATAAA and CATAAA probes. Binding reactions contained 10 µm poly(dG-dC) nonspecific competitor, 100 mm KCl, 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20 mmTris (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl flouride. 32P-Labeled TATAAA and CATAAA probes (2.4 pmol) were incubated with 13.8 nm TBP at 25 °C for the indicated amount of time. For EMSA the complexes were separated on 5% acrylamide gel containing 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA and 2 mm MgCl2 in both the gel and running buffer. Recombinant yeast TFIIA (5.0 nm) and His-tagged TFIIB (8.5 nm) were isolated and incubated with TBP and probe DNA and treated as described above, except that MgCl2 was omitted from the gel and running buffer in the experiments shown. Omission of the divalent cations from the binding reaction allows for the stable formation of only the ternary complex, which makes quantitation simpler because there is only a single shifted complex. Assays of higher order complex formation were also performed in the presence of MgCl2 (data not shown). Inclusion of MgCl2 did not alter the results of the experiments. The gels were transferred to Whatman 3MM paper, dried under vacuum at 80 °C, and subjected to PhosphorImager screen or autoradiography at −70 °C with an intensifying screen. The concentration of active protein was determined by DNA titration in which the reaction mixtures contained known concentrations of radiolabeled probe and a fixed amount of protein (30Hoopes B.C. LeBlanc J.F. Hawley D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11539-11547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hoopes B.C. LeBlanc J.F. Hawley D.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 1015-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and the fraction of DNA bound was determined. By this analysis, the TBP preparation used for most experiments shown in this work was about 6% active, consistent with 10% activity reported by others for yeast TBP preparations (30Hoopes B.C. LeBlanc J.F. Hawley D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11539-11547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All TBP concentrations given in the text refer to the concentration of active protein. For measuring association rates, the reactions contained 2.4 pmol of probe DNA and 13.8 nm TBP (or 13.8 nm TBP and 5.0 nm TFIIA) and were incubated at 25 °C in a final reaction volume of 360 µl. At the indicated times, the extent of complex formation was analyzed by EMSA by loading 10 µl of the binding reaction on to the gel. For filter binding assays, the samples were applied to a pretreated nitrocellulose membrane via a dot blot apparatus exactly as described (32Wong I. Lohman T.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). After sample application, each well was washed with 100 µl of binding buffer (100 mmKCl, 40 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol), and the filters were air dried and subjected to a PhosphorImager screen for quantitation. For both the EMSA and filter binding assays, the data are presented as the fraction bound at time (t). Fraction bound is calculated from the ratio B/B 30, where B represents the amount of complex present at each time point and B 30 is defined as the amount of complex formed at 30 min. For dissociation kinetic studies, TBP-DNA, TFIIA-TBP-DNA, and TFIIB-TBP-DNA complexes were allowed to reach equilibrium and then challenged with 1000-fold molar excess of specific competitor poly(dA-dT) for the specified amount of time. The samples were then loaded on to the gel and resolved by EMSA. The data are presented as the fraction bound at time (t). Fraction bound is calculated from the ratio B/B o, whereB represents the amount of complex present at each time point and B o is defined as the amount of complex formed in the control lane without added specific competitor. Recent work characterizing a TBP allele defective for interaction with TFIIA (the N2-1 derivative of TBP) has shown that the TFIIA-TBP interaction is important forHIS3 core element utilization (33Stargell L.A.

When the amount of RNA initiating from +1 (which is driven by the noncanonical element, TC) and +13 (driven by TATA) start sites were compared, the N2-1 strain showed a preferential increase in transcription initiating from +13, even when the overall level of transcription was low (33Stargell L.A. Moqtaderi Z. Dorris D. Ogg R.C. Struhl K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12374-12380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This is in stark contrast to the utilization of the HIS3promoter elements occurring in wild type cells, which shows similar levels of output (22Iyer V. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7059-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the loss of the TFIIA-TBP interaction is having a more dramatic effect on the noncanonical element (TC) than on the canonical element (33Stargell L.A. Moqtaderi Z. Dorris D. Ogg R.C. Struhl K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12374-12380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To further test the importance of the TFIIA-TBP interaction at the HIS3 promoter, we examined the effect of introducing a fusion construct of a subunit of TFIIA (Toa2) to TBP (34Stargell L.A. Struhl K. Science. 1995; 269: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The idea is that fusion of TFIIA to TBP increases the effective concentration of TFIIA at the promoter. We compared the amount of RNA initiating from the +1 start site (TC) and the +13 start site (TATA) in strains containing either Toa2-TBP or wild type TBP. Interestingly, the amount of transcription initiating at +1 was 10-fold higher in the Toa2-TBP strain compared with the TBP strain (Fig.1). In contrast, the amount of transcription initiating at +13 is essentially the same in the two strains. Thus, fusion of TFIIA to TBP causes a preferential increase in transcription from a natural, noncanonical element, indicating that transcription from this class of elements is more sensitive to perturbations in the TFIIA-TBP interaction than is a consensus TATA element. Because the CATAAA sequence can functionally replace TC (22Iyer V. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7059-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and CATAAA is a simpler model for noncanonical promoters, we compared the functional activities of CATAAA and TATAAA. The TATAAA and CATAAA elements were cloned individually into the core promoter region of a reporter plasmid containing the GAL1,10 UAS upstream of the core promoter and the wild type HIS3 initiation region driving the expression of a HIS3-LACZ fusion (24Chen W. Struhl K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2691-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 25Singer V.L. Wobbe C.R. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 636-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus, the only difference between the two constructs is in the first position of the TATAAA box sequence where TATAAA contains a thymine and CATAAA contains a cytosine. These constructs were used to measure the response to Gal4, a potent acidic activator that stimulates transcription in the presence of galactose. Under noninducing conditions (raffinose) both TATAAA and CATAAA exhibited similar levels of β-galactosidase activity (TableI). In contrast, incubation in galactose medium resulted in a 50-fold increase in activity from the TATAAA-driven reporter, whereas the CATAAA-driven reporter did not show a significant increase in activity over that of cells grown under noninducing conditions. Thus, like TC, the CATAAA element is greatly diminished in its ability to support high levels of transcription in vivo.Table IGal4-dependent activation of transcription in vivoTBP derivative1-aThe parent yeast strain yJS156 has the chromosomal copy of Spt15 deleted.

Open table in a new tab If CATAAA serves as a good model for TC (a noncanonical TATA element), then one would predict that the sensitivity to changes in TFIIA activity would be similar. To test this hypothesis, we again utilized the Toa2-TBP fusion construct. The response to Gal4 from TATAAA or CATAAA in the strain containing the Toa2-TBP fusion as the sole source of TBP was measured using the β-galactosidase assay. Incubation in galactose medium results in a 50-fold increase in activity in either the wild type TBP or the Toa2-TBP fusion strain harboring the TATAAA driven reporter (Table I). Whereas activity from the TATAAA element was unaffected by the Toa2-TBP fusion, the CATAAA-driven reporter showed a dramatic increase (15-fold) in activity in the fusion strain over the TBP strain containing the CATAAA element. In addition, this increase in activity from CATAAA is specific for TFIIA because no such increase is observed in a TFIIB-TBP fusion strain. Thus, CATAAA and TC are up-regulated similarly in the Toa2-TBP background. Because TBP is the sequence-specific factor that recognizes the TATA element, it seemed likely that differences in TATAAA and CATAAA element activity might be due to insufficient binding of TBP or instability of the TBP-CATAAA complex. To test this hypothesis, the relative binding and stability of TBP on the TATAAA or the CATAAA element was measured. The two 33-base pair sequences used in this assay differ only in position 11, where TATAAA contains a thymine and CATAAA contains a cytosine. The rate of formation of the TBP-DNA complex on TATAAA and CATAAA was measured by monitoring complex formation over increasing time using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig.2, A–C) and filter binding assays (Fig. 2 D). The observed kinetics of TBP binding to the TATAAA and CATAAA sequences appears to follow first order kinetics because the data were fitted by single-exponential curves (Fig. 2,C and D). The curves fit to the data obtained from the shift assay corresponded to a half-time association (t 12) of 1.2 min for TATAAA and 3.0 min for CATAAA. Similar rates were obtained using the filter binding assay: 0.9 min for TATA and 2.1 min for CATA. The rates obtained for the TBP-TATA association are consistent with previously obtained rates for the formation of this complex (30Hoopes B.C. LeBlanc J.F. Hawley D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11539-11547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, both assays reveal a slightly faster formation of the TBP-TATA complex as compared with the TBP-CATA complex at early time points. However, the absolute amount of complex formed at 30 min is similar for both TATAAA and CATAAA. We next examined the stability of the TBP-DNA complex by determining the dissociation kinetics of the two complexes (Fig.3). TBP-DNA complexes were formed and then challenged with a large excess of an adenine-thymine rich sequence, poly(dA-dT). Poly(dA-dT) is used in these competition assays as specific competitor because the sequence of alternating adenine and thymine closely resembles a TATAAA element. TBP was incubated with the DNA for 30 min, because this results in a similar amount of TBP-DNA complex formed on TATAAA and CATAAA (Figs. 2 and 3), followed by the addition of 1000-fold molar excess of poly(dA-dT). TBP behaves similarly on both elements with a t 12 of 40 min. DNase I footprinting experiments confirmed that TBP was specifically protecting the TATAAA and CATAAA elements (data not shown). Thus, TBP binds with equal stability on both the TATAAA and CATAAA elements. Could the 100-fold difference in activity in vivo be due to the slight difference in early binding kinetics of TBP to TATAAA and CATAAA? Possibly, but we next examined higher order complex formation to determine whether more dramatic differences could be observed for the two elements. Because the binding and stability of TBP was not dramatically different on the two elements, we compared the two sequences for their ability to form TFIIA-TBP-DNA complexes. Because the fusion of TFIIA to TBP resulted in elevated le"

Never in Mitosis A glutathione S-transferase electrophoretic mobility shift analysis base pair Cell division requires accurate condensation and faithful segregation of chromosomes. Despite the great efforts invested, the mechanisms of these two processes still remain unclear. However, during the last few years an impressive progress has been made in their understanding by using two complementary approaches as follows: genetics in yeast and experiments in extracts prepared fromXenopus eggs (reviewed in Ref. 1Hirano T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 115-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The biochemical manipulations of the Xenopus egg extract were extremely useful since they have led to the identification of multiprotein complexes, termed condensins, required for chromosome condensation (2Hirano T. Kobayashi R. Hirano M. Cell. 1997; 89: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar).

Several lines of evidence indicate that the master kinase Cdc-2 might be involved in the phosphorylation and activation of condensins (3Kimura K. Hirano M. Kobayashi R. Hirano T.

In contrast, the phosphorylation of serine 10 in the amino-terminal domain of histone H3 is essential for cell division.

This was further supported by experiments on blocking of the mitotic histone H3 kinase and, thus, histone H3 phosphorylation, which has resulted in inhibition of chromosome assembly in vitro (22de la Barre A.E.

Nonetheless, the mechanism of action of histone H3 phosphorylation in cell division is still poorly understood. A real progress toward elucidation of this mechanism will be the identification of the enzymes involved in the regulation of mitotic H3 phosphorylation. Recently, reports from two different groups identified two distinct kinases Never in Mitosis A (NIMA)1 inA. nidulans (17De Souza C.P. Osmani A.H. Wu L.P. Spotts J.L. Osmani S.A.

Cell. 2000; 102: 279-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar) as the mitotic histone H3 kinases. In vitro NIMA phosphorylated histone H3 at serine 10, and the in vivo phosphorylation of the histone is dependent on the presence of the kinase activity (17De Souza C.P. Osmani A.H. Wu L.P. Spotts J.L. Osmani S.A. Cell. 2000; 102: 293-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). At the onset of mitosis, NIMA is detected on chromatin and subsequently colocalized with spindle microtubules and spindle pole bodies. The chromatin localization of this enzyme is tightly correlated with histone H3 phosphorylation (17De Souza C.P. Osmani A.H. Wu L.P. Spotts J.L. Osmani S.A. Cell. 2000; 102: 293-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The budding yeast genome encodes for a single aurora kinase Ipl1 that is required for cell cycle progression, and strains bearing genetics defects in this enzyme showed abnormal chromosome segregation and suffered severe nondysjunction (23Chan C.S. Botstein D. Genetics. 1993; 135: 677-691Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme expression peaks at mitosis, and when a temperature-sensitive lethal Ipl1 strain was grown at permissive temperature, a markedly reduced H3 phosphorylation was detected (15Hsu J.Y.

However, only the disruption by RNA interference of air2 expression in C. elegans embryos led to undetectable histone H3 phosphorylation (15Hsu J.Y. Sun Z.W. Li X. Reuben M. Tatchell K. Bishop D.K.

The situation is different in vertebrates where three aurora kinases, recently renamed as aurora-A, -B, and -C, have been described (reviewed in Refs. 24Giet R. Prigent C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3591-3601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1244) Google Scholar, 26Adams R.R. Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 49-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) The Xenopus laevis kinase pEg2 belongs to the aurora kinase protein family, and according to the new nomenclature is the Xenopus aurora-A kinase. pEg2 was found associated with centrosomes in a cell cycle-dependent manner. It also binds to the spindle microtubules, and its activity is required for bipolar spindle assembly (27Roghi C. Giet R. Uzbekov R. Morin N. Chartrain I. Le Guellec R. Couturier A. Doree M. Philippe M. Prigent C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 557-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo pEg2 has been reported to associate with the kinesin-related protein XlEg5 and to the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding factor. Both proteins are phosphorylated by pEg2 in vitro in residues found phosphorylated in vivo (24Giet R. Prigent C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3591-3601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Mendez R. Hake L.E. Andresson T. Littlepage L.E. Ruderman J.V. Richter J.D. Nature. 2000; 404: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In vertebrate cells the aurora kinase(s) that phosphorylates histone H3 is not known. Moreover, none of the X. laevis H3 mitotic kinases have been identified yet. The aim of this work was to search for such enzyme(s). To this end extracts from Xenopus eggs were used, and in vitro chromosome assembly was performed. We have identified the aurora-A kinase pEg2 as a potentially good candidate for histone H3 mitotic kinase in Xenopus eggs. Mitotic extracts from Xenopus eggs were prepared essentially as described (49Losada A. Yokochi T. Kobayashi R. Hirano T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Dejellied eggs were crushed by centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 rpm in an SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments) at 16 °C in XBE2 buffer (100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.7, 5 mm K-EGTA, 0.05m sucrose) supplemented with 10 µg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin and 100 µg/ml cytochalasin D. The cytoplasmic layer was collected using a 20-gauge needle via a side puncture and kept on ice. Protease inhibitors (leupeptin and aprotinin) and cytochalasin D at final concentration of 10 µg/ml and 1/20 volume of 20× energy mix (20 mm phosphocreatine, 2 mm ATP, and 5 µg/ml creatine kinase, final concentration) were added, and the extract was clarified by centrifuging at the same speed as above, but at 4 °C. The golden layer (low speed supernatant) was collected and transferred in 2 ml of polypropylene tubes for a TLS-55 rotor (Beckman Instruments) and spun at 52,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C. The top lipid layer was aspirated under vacuum, and the clear cytoplasmic fraction was recentrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 52,000 rpm to remove the residual membranes. The extract (high speed supernatant) was collected, aliquoted in 25-µl fractions, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Heated extracts were prepared as described previously (35Dimitrov S. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5897-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Demembraned sperm nuclei were isolated according to a protocol published previously (50de la Barre A.-E. Robert-Nicoud M. Dimitrov S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 219-229PubMed Google Scholar). They were aliquoted in 5-µl fractions at a concentration of 1 µg/µl DNA and stored at −80 °C. Each aliquot was used only once, since after refreezing and a second thawing the demembraned sperm nuclei strongly tend to aggregate. Recombinant X. laevis full-length and globular domain histone proteins were made in bacteria and purified to homogeneity as described by Luger et al. (34Luger K. Rechsteiner T.J. Flaus A.J. Waye M.M.

The mutations of serine 10 and of serine 28 to alanine in histone H3 were made according to the standard site-directed mutagenesis approach by using QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For the first mutation the oligonucleotides used were pet3aH3S10A (cagaccgcccgtaaagctaccggagggaagg) and pet3bH3S10A (ccttccctccggtagctttacgggcggtctg), and the mutagenesis at serine 28 was carried out with pet3aH3S28A (caccaaggcagccaggaaggctgctcctgctacc) and pet3bH3S28A (ggtagcaggagcagccttcctggctgccttggtg) oligonucleotides. The mutated histone H3 was expressed and purified exactly as the non-mutated one. The GST-histone tail fusion proteins were prepared as described (22de la Barre A.E. Gerson V. Gout S. Creaven M. Allis C.D. Dimitrov S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The concentration of the recombinant proteins was determined by using both Bradford assay and spectrophotometrically. pEg2 was depleted from the extract by the already characterized 1C1 monoclonal antibody (27Roghi C. Giet R. Uzbekov R. Morin N. Chartrain I. Le Guellec R. Couturier A. Doree M. Philippe M. Prigent C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 557-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The immunodepletion was carried out essentially according to a protocol described previously (37Dimitrov S. Dasso M.C. Wolffe A.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 591-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, protein A-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were washed with EB buffer (80 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.3, 15 mm MgCl2, 20 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and blocked with 5 times volume of bovine serum albumin at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. After three successive washings with EB, 500 µl of the hybridoma supernatant was added to 50 µl of pelleted beads, and the suspension was incubated for 1 h under rotation at 4 °C. For the mock immunodepletion, 25 µl of preimmune serum was diluted with EB to 500 µl final volume, mixed with 50 µl of settled beads, and incubated as above. Once the incubation completed, the beads were washed 3 times with 10 volumes of EB. The cytosol was depleted by adding 4 volumes of extract to 1 volume of settled beads followed by incubation under rotation at 4 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation, the supernatant was treated with additional 50 µl of fresh beads under the conditions described. Quantitative measurements showed that this protocol removed 95–98% of pEg2 present in the extract. The native pEg2 immobilized to the beads was further used in kinase assay experiments. Recombinant pEg2 was expressed and purified essentially as described (27Roghi C. Giet R. Uzbekov R. Morin N. Chartrain I. Le Guellec R. Couturier A. Doree M. Philippe M. Prigent C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 557-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNA of pEg2 was prepared by differential screening of Xenopusegg cDNA library. The coding sequence of the protein was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and inserted inNheI/XhoI restriction sites of the His tag expression vector pET21 (Novagen Inc.) using primers described previously (27Roghi C. Giet R. Uzbekov R. Morin N. Chartrain I. Le Guellec R. Couturier A. Doree M. Philippe M. Prigent C. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 557-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytically inactive form of the enzyme pEg2KR was engineered with Transformer Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (CLONTECH) to change the lysine 169 of pEg2 to arginine. The kinases were expressed in Escherichia colistrain BL21(DE3) and the tagged proteins purified on a nickel column (Qiagen). The purified enzymes were dialyzed overnight against EB, aliquoted in 20-µl fractions, and stored at −20 °C at concentration 0.2–0.5 µg/µl. For the kinase assay 1 µl of recombinant pEg2 was added to 50 µl of EB containing 1 µg of recombinant histones or 5 µg of reconstituted nucleosomes. After addition of 20 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP, the reaction was allowed to proceed for 15 min at room temperature, and then the proteins were precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid (final concentration). The pellet was dissolved in 8 m urea, and after adding sample buffer the proteins were separated on 18% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the gel was dried and autoradiographed. The immunoblotting protocol was already described (22de la Barre A.E. Gerson V. Gout S. Creaven M. Allis C.D. Dimitrov S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The dilution used for the anti-phosphorylated histone H3 antiserum was 1:3000, whereas the hybridoma supernatant was diluted 1:500. The filters were developed by using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the instructions of the manufacturer. The extract was prepared by using Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain GA59. This yeast strain has the advantage of exhibiting low protease activity. An overnight preculture, grown in YPD medium, was diluted toA 600 = 0.2–0.3 with the same medium. The yeast were further grown at 30 °C to A 600 = 0.5 and then supplemented with nocodazole to 10 µg/ml final concentration. The control and the nocodazole-containing cultures (50 ml each) were next incubated for 5 h and harvested by centrifugation. The pellets were washed twice with ice-cold water and resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mmMgCl2, 20 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.05% SDS, 1 µm okadaic acid, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The suspension was then transferred in 2-ml Eppendorf tubes containing glass beads, and the cells were lysed by 5 min of vortexing. The cell debris were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was used in gel activity assay experiments. The gel activity assay was performed in 10- × 8-cm × 1-mm 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 50 µg/ml gel-incorporated substrate (GST-histone H3 tail fusions or the globular domain of histone H3). After separation of the extracts, the gel was incubated twice in 50 ml of buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20% 2-propanol) for 30 min, followed by two washings (50 ml each) in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and two successive 30-min denaturation steps in 50 ml of buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 6 m guanidine chloride). Furthermore, the proteins were renatured by incubation of the gel for 30 min at 4 °C in 50 ml buffer D (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.04% Tween 20). Then the gel was preincubated for 30 min in 50 ml of the activity buffer E (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 25 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 50 mm dithiothreitol) followed by 1-h incubation in 10 ml of EB supplemented with 15 µCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Finally, after five washings (50 ml each) with 5% trichloroacetic acid, 1% tetrapyrophosphate, the gel was dried and autoradiographed. Mitotic chromosomes were assembled in Xenopus egg extract at 23 °C following a standard protocol (50de la Barre A.-E. Robert-Nicoud M. Dimitrov S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 219-229PubMed Google Scholar). 20–25 µl of extract were used for 40–60,000 demembraned sperm nuclei. In some experiments 1 µl of cyclin BΔ90 (the nondegradable form of cyclin B) was added. To follow the kinetics of assembly, 5-µl aliquots from the mock-depleted and pEg2-depleted extract were taken at different times after initial incubation and fixed immediately with 5 µl of the fix/stain buffer (Hoechst 33258 at 1 µg/ml in 200 mmsucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 7.4% formaldehyde, 0.23% 1,4-diazabicycle-[2.2.2]octane, 0.02% B NaN3, and 70% glycerol). The decondensation of sperm nuclei in heated extract was carried out as described previously (35Dimitrov S. Wolffe A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5897-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The immunofluorescence analysis was carried out as described by de la Barre et al. (50de la Barre A.-E. Robert-Nicoud M. Dimitrov S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 219-229PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-phosphorylated histone H3 antibody was used at dilution 1:5000. Finally, the chromosomes were counterstained with 8 µl of fix/stain buffer. Hen erythrocyte nuclei were isolated as described by Mirzabekov et al. (51Mirzabekov A.D. Pruss D.V. Ebralidze K.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 479-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Oligosomes were prepared by digestion of the nuclei with micrococcal nuclease and linker histones, and non-histone proteins were removed by centrifugation of the oligosomes over 5–20% sucrose, containing 0.65m NaCl (52Mutskov V. Gerber D. Angelov D. Ausio J. Workman J. Dimitrov S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6293-6304Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). After overnight dialysis against a solution of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, oligonucleosomes were aliquoted and stored frozen at −20 °C. In the reconstitution experiments, “bulk” nucleosomal DNA, prepared from native hen erythrocyte nucleosomes, was used. A strictly stoichiometric amount of the four histones (determined spectrometrically and checked on a SDS gel) in 10 mm HCl was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 2 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA. The next morning a mixture of bulk nucleosomal DNA and 32P-end-labeled 152-bp EcoRI-RsaI fragment containing a Xenopus borealis somatic 5 S RNA gene was added to the dialysis tubing. The ratio of the added DNA to the core histone octamer was 1:0.8. Nucleosome reconstitution was performed by successively lowering the concentration of the NaCl in the dialysis buffer. Finally, the reconstituted particles were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA and used for kinase assay. The extent of reconstitution and the integrity of the nucleosomes were checked by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA) and DNase I footprinting. The EMSA was carried out in 2% agarose gel at room temperature in 0.5× TBE (Tris borate/EDTA) buffer. Upon completion of the electrophoresis, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide. The footprinting of the reconstituted nucleosomes was performed by using DNase I. The digestion was carried out with 10 ng of DNase I per 10 µl of nucleosome solution (10 ng/µl) in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2 for 2 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 µl of stop solution (10 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 50 ng/µl proteinase K) followed by 30 min of incubation at 37 °C. Then the samples were phenol-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and separated on 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gel containing urea. The dried gel was exposed overnight on a PhosphorImager screen. We were interested in determining the Xenopus kinase(s) responsible for the mitotic-specific phosphorylation of histone H3 at serine 10. However, various bona fide candidates for histone H3 mitotic kinases were identified in different organisms (15Hsu J.Y. Sun Z.W. Li X. Reuben M. Tatchell K. Bishop D.K. Grushcow J.M. Brame C.J.

If the last suggestion is true, it will be important to find the relative contribution of each enzyme in the mitotic phosphorylation of histone H3. Since in vitroserine 10 of histone H3 can be phosphorylated by a multitude of kinases (protein kinase A (29Shibata K. Inagaki M. Ajiro K. Eur. J.

Science. 1999; 285: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar)), the determination of the active mitotic kinases could be done more easily by using yeast, which is a somewhat simpler system, instead of Xenopus. As H3 phosphorylation is highly conserved in evolution, the major mitotic kinases modifying this protein should belong to the same families in different organisms. Thus, the identification of the yeast enzymes will undoubtedly be instrumental for the analysis of the Xenopus system. Since the yeast genome is already sequenced, the kinase molecular weight determination will allow their identification. Following this rationale, we carried out a series of in gel activity assays using crude extracts isolated from nocodazole-treated or control, non-treatedS. cerevisiae cells (Fig. 1). As substrates for the kinases we have incorporated into the gels either the non-mutated GST-histone H3 tail fusion (GSTH3) or the same fusion, but mutated at serine 10 to alanine (GSTH3S10), or the globular domain of histone H3 (GH3). As a control, we have used gel-incorporated GST. When the mitotic extract (isolated from the nocodazole-treated cells) was subjected to the assay, three specific bands were detected by autoradiography in the gel containing GST-H3. The strongest band migrated with molecular mass of 40–42 kDa. The incorporation of32P in these three positions was characteristic for the yeast mitotic extract in the gel comprising GST-H3; very faint or no32P-labeled bands with the above molecular masses were observed in all other cases (Fig. 1, compare lane 1 withlanes 2–8). These data suggest that at least three different kinases from the yeast mitot"
https://openalex.org/W2076290756,"Abstract Human DNA polymerase ι is a low-fidelity template copier that preferentially catalyzes the incorporation of the wobble base G, rather than the Watson-Crick base A, opposite template T (Tissier, A., McDonald, J. P., Frank, E. G., and Woodgate, R. (2000) Genes Dev. 14, 1642–1650; Johnson, R. E., Washington, M. T., Haracska, L., Prakash, S., and Prakash, L. (2000) Nature 406, 1015–1019; Zhang, Y., Yuan, F., Wu, X., and Wang, Z. (2000) Mol. Cell. Biol. 20, 7099–7108). Here, we report on its ability to extend all 12 possible mispairs and 4 correct pairs in different sequence contexts. Extension from both matched and mismatched primer termini is generally most efficient and accurate when A is the next template base. In contrast, extension occurs less efficiently and accurately when T is the target template base. A striking exception occurs during extension of a G:T mispair, where the enzyme switches specificity, “preferring” to make a correct A:T base pair immediately downstream from an originally favored G:T mispair. Polymerase ι generates a variety of single and tandem mispairs with high frequency, implying that it may act as a strong mutator when copying undamaged DNA templates in vivo. Even so, its limited ability to catalyze extension from a relatively stable primer/template containing a “buried” mismatch suggests that polymerase ι-catalyzed errors are confined to short template regions."
https://openalex.org/W1993476049,"Previously, we characterized a mitochondrial co-chaperonin (Cpn10) and a chloroplast co-chaperonin (Cpn20) from Arabidopsis thaliana (Koumoto, Y., Tsugeki, R., Shimada, T., Mori, H., Kondo, M., Hara-Nishimura, I., and Nishimura, M. (1996) Plant J. 10, 1119–1125; Koumoto, Y., Shimada, T., Kondo, M., Takao, T., Shimonishi, Y., Hara-Nishimura, I., and Nishimura, M. (1999) Plant J. 17, 467–477). Here, we report a third co-chaperonin. The cDNA was 603 base pairs long, encoding a protein of 139 amino acids. From a sequence analysis, the protein was predicted to have one Cpn10 domain with an amino-terminal extension that might work as a chloroplast transit peptide. This novel Cpn10 was confirmed to be localized in chloroplasts, and we refer to it as chloroplast Cpn10 (chl-Cpn10). The phylogenic tree that was generated with amino acid sequences of other co-chaperonins indicates that chl-Cpn10 is highly divergent from the others. In the GroEL-assisted protein folding assay, about 30% of the substrates were refolded with chl-Cpn10, indicating that chl-Cpn10 works as a co-chaperonin. A Northern blot analysis revealed that mRNA for chl-Cpn10 is accumulated in the leaves and stems, but not in the roots. In germinating cotyledons, the accumulation of chl-Cpn10 was similar to that of chloroplastic proteins and accelerated by light. It was proposed that two kinds of co-chaperonins, Cpn20 and chl-Cpn10, work independently in the chloroplast. Previously, we characterized a mitochondrial co-chaperonin (Cpn10) and a chloroplast co-chaperonin (Cpn20) from Arabidopsis thaliana (Koumoto, Y., Tsugeki, R., Shimada, T., Mori, H., Kondo, M., Hara-Nishimura, I., and Nishimura, M.

They are generally divided into two groups (1Braig K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Group I chaperonins are localized in the stroma of chloroplasts, the matrix of mitochondria, and eubacteria, and group II chaperonins are found in the eukaryotic cytosol and archaebacteria. One of the differences between the two groups is the requirement for co-chaperonins for their function. Group I chaperonins work together with co-chaperonins, whereas group II chaperonins work alone. The chaperonin (GroEL) and co-chaperonin (GroES) of Escherichia coli have been characterized in detail. They are heat-shock proteins that are also required for viability under normal conditions (2Fayet O. Ziegelhoffer T. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). GroEL is composed of two heptameric rings, each consisting of seven 57-kDa subunits. Two stacked rings of the GroEL heptamer form a central cavity that captures incompletely folded proteins. The co-chaperonin GroES, a dome-shaped ring consisting of seven 10-kDa subunits, binds to GroEL. GroES has been shown to increase the cooperativity of the ATPase activity of GroEL (3Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1994; 265: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the GroEL tetradecamer (4Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar), the GroES heptamer (5Hunt J.F. Weaver A.J. Landry S.J. Gierasch L. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1996; 379: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), the GroEL-GroES complex (6Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar), and the GroEL-peptide complex (7Chen L. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 99: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) have been characterized. Whereas the structures and basic mechanism of reaction have been well defined, little is known about the roles of the chaperonins in vivo. From the analysis of a temperature-sensitive GroEL mutant strain of E. coli, it has been shown that about 30% of newly translated polypeptides fold via GroEL (8Horwich A.L. Low K.B. Fenton W.A. Hirshfield I.N. Furtak K. Cell. 1993; 74: 909-917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that about 10–15% of cytoplasmic proteins of E. colicells interact with GroEL (9Ewalt K.L. Hendrick J.P. Houry W.A. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1997; 90: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). These results suggested that the majority of proteins fold without the help of chaperonins in vivo. However, it is a fact that the folding of some proteins is extremely dependent on chaperonins (10Dubaquié Y. Looser R. Fünfschilling U. Jenö P. Rospert S. EMBO J. 1998; 20: 5868-5876Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). From import experiments of temperature-sensitive mutants of yeast mitochondrial chaperonin (Cpn60) and co-chaperonin (Cpn10), it was shown that some proteins form aggregates in the absence of either Cpn60 or Cpn10. In particular, the folding of a newly imported Cpn60 itself is extremely dependent on Cpn10. The chaperonin system in the chloroplast stroma of higher plants is unique. The stromal chaperonin oligomer consists of two isoforms, Cpn60α and Cpn60β (11Nishio K. Hirohashi T. Nakai M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 266: 584-587Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and stromal co-chaperonin (Cpn20) is comprised of two GroES-like tandem domains (12Bertsch U. Soll J. Seetharam R. Viitanen P.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8696-8700Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Schlicher and Soll (13Schlicher T. Soll J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 302-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) showed that the thylakoid lumen contains a Cpn10 homologue that is recognized by a peptide-specific antiserum raised against a peptide of stromal Cpn20. The reported size of the lumenal homologue on SDS-PAGE1 is about 10–12 kDa. On the other hand, in a recently performed proteomics study on the chloroplast of pea, Peltier et al. (14Peltier J.-B. Friso G. Kalume D.E. Roepstorff P. Nilsson F. Adamska I. van Wijk K.J. Plant J. 2000; 12: 319-341Google Scholar) identified Hsp70, Cpn60α, and Cpn20 on the two-dimensional electrophoresis map with thylakoid lumenal proteins. The explanation for the presence of stromal chaperones in the lumenal fraction was that they are bound to the stromal side of the thylakoid membrane. The authors supposed that the 10–12-kDa protein recognized by the antiserum against Cpn20 was a degradative product of Cpn20 and not a Cpn10 homologue. Thus, we performed studies to examine whether a Cpn10 homologue exists in the chloroplast or not. In this study, we report the existence of a novel Cpn10 homologue in the chloroplast. Sequence analysis showed that chloroplast Cpn10 was divergent from the other co-chaperonins, suggesting that it might have evolved to have a special function. The cDNA fragment for the deduced mature region of chl-Cpn10, residues 50–139, was inserted into expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Six histidine residues (His-tagged) located at the amino-terminal of chl-Cpn10 were derived from this vector.E. coli was transformed with the construct, and the expression of proteins was induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The chaperonin-assisted protein folding assay was performed as described by Schmidt et al. (15Schmidt M. Buchner J. Todd M.J. Lorimer G.H. Viitanen P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10304-10311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Citrate synthase (CS) was denatured at a concentration of 15 µm in a solution containing 6m guanidine hydrochloride, 100 mmTris-Cl (pH 8.0), and 20 mm dithiothreitol for at least 1 h at room temperature. Denatured CS was rapidly diluted to a concentration of 150 nm in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.7), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, and 225 nm GroEL tetradecamer at 0 °C. The temperature was adjusted to 35 °C, and 2 mmATP and 300 nm co-chaperonin oligomer were added. After various time periods of incubation, aliquots were removed and assayed for CS activity. The assay for CS was essentially as described previously (16Srere P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1969; 13: 3-11Crossref Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). GroEL and GroES were purchased from Takara (Tokyo, Japan). The content of co-chaperonin was determined by a protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). Transgenic Arabidopsiscotyledons were fixed, dehydrated, and embedded in LR White resin (London Resin Co., Basingstoke, United Kingdom) as described previously (17Nishimura M. Takeuchi Y. De Bellis L. Hara-Nishimura I. Protoplasma. 1993; 175: 131-137Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Immunogold procedures were essentially the same as those described by Kinoshita et al. (18Kinoshita T. Yamada K. Hiraiwa N. Kondo M. Nishimura M. Hara-Nishimura I. Plant J. 1999; 19: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), except for the use of antiserum against the His-tagged chl-Cpn10 diluted 50-fold. 15 nm protein A-gold (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was diluted 100-fold prior to use. An antiserum was raised in a rabbit against the His-tagged chl-Cpn10 expressed in E. coli. The sections were examined with a transmission electron microscope (1200EX; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) at 80 kV. Intact chloroplasts were prepared from homogenates of mature tobacco leaves as described in a previous study (19Koumoto Y. Shimada T. Kondo M. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. HaraNishimura I. Nishimura M. Plant J. 1999; 17: 467-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The chloroplast pellets (equivalent to 130 µg of chlorophyll) were lysed in 150 µl of 10 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 6.0) and 10 mm MgCl2. After 5 min on ice, the membrane and the soluble fractions were separated by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 10 min. Total RNA was purified by LiCl precipitation after the extraction of RNA with ISOGEN (Nippongene, Tokyo, Japan). 20 µg of total RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel and transferred to a nylon membrane under a vacuum with 1 n ammonium acetate. Hybridization was performed as described by Church and Gilbert (20Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7251) Google Scholar). After hybridization, the membrane was sequentially washed twice in 2× SSC and 0.1% (w/v) SDS at room temperature for 30 min and twice in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 60 °C for 30 min. The washed membrane was exposed to an imaging plate, and the radioactivity of signals was detected with an analyzer system (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide) was performed by following the method of Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). The separated proteins on the gels were electrophoretically blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Nihon Millipore Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Immunochemical detection was performed by the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After detection, the blotted membrane was rinsed once in water and stained in 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue solution for 1 min. The stained membrane was washed once in 50% methanol until the protein bands appeared and were dried. To generate overproducing transgenic plants, the β-glucuronidase gene of binary vector pBI121Hm was replaced by a SalI-XbaI cDNA fragment derived from an Arabidopsis EST clone (GenBank accession numberT44192). pBI121Hm is a derivative of pBI121 and contains two drug resistance genes, the neomycin phosphotransferase II gene and the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene. The resulting construct was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens (strain EHA101) and used to transform Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia plants by the in planta method (22Bechtold N. Ellis J. Pelletier G. C. R. Acad. Sci. Ser. III Sci. Vie. 1993; 316: 1194-1199Google Scholar). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using a SuperscriptTMpreamplification system for the first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) from total RNA. The oligo(dT) primer was used for reverse transcription. Quantitative PCR assays were performed by an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (PE Biosystems Japan, Tokyo, Japan). This system is capable of detecting PCR products as they accumulate during PCR. For detection, it is necessary to prepare the fluorescent DNA probe that is specific to the PCR target sequence flanked by PCR primers. To select the PCR primers and the fluorescent probes, we used the Prime ExpressTM program (PE Biosystems Japan). All PCR procedures were carried out with 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s with annealing and extension at 60 °C for 1 min according to the supplier's recommendations. In A. thaliana, cDNAs for mitochondrial Cpn10 and chloroplast Cpn20 have already been cloned (19Koumoto Y. Shimada T. Kondo M. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. HaraNishimura I. Nishimura M. Plant J. 1999; 17: 467-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar,23Koumoto Y. Tsugeki R. Shimada T. Mori H. Kondo M. Hara-Nishimura I. Nishimura M. Plant J. 1996; 10: 1119-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 24Hirohashi T. Nishio K. Nakai M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1429: 512-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Using the amino acid sequences of full-length mitochondrial Cpn10 and the mature region of chloroplast Cpn20, we searched the EST data base for another homologous cDNA. As a result, some EST clones were found to have the amino-terminal conserved motif of Cpn10, PXX(D/N)(K/R) (Fig.1 a) but showed low similarity to the two clones mentioned above as a whole. The sequence of the longest EST clone (GenBank accession number T44192) was determined. The cDNA was 603 bp long, encoding a protein of 139 amino acids (Fig.1 a). The protein was predicted to be a homologue of Cpn10 containing an amino-terminal extension from sequence analysis. This extension was predicted to be a chloroplast transit peptide using the PSORT program. 2www.nibb.ac.jp. Therefore, the Cpn10 homologue is referred to as chl-Cpn10. Moreover, we found tomato and soybean EST clones that exhibit high sequence homology with chl-Cpn10 of Arabidopsis (Fig. 1 b). This indicates that chl-Cpn10 exists in various plants. Genome sequencing revealed another clone of chl-Cpn10 in Arabidopsis (25The Arabidopsis Genome Initiative Nature. 2000; 408: 796-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (7006) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of the two Arabidopsis clones showed 72% identity. The phylogenic tree was generated with amino acid sequences of other co-chaperonins including bacterial GroES (Fig.2). The amino-terminal conserved motif of GroES starts from the fifth proline. Because it is expected that sequences with similar length align more accurately, the amino acid sequence from Thr-50 to Glu-139 of chl-Cpn10, in which the conserved motif also starts from the fifth proline (as in GroES), was used for alignment. As shown in Fig. 2, chl-Cpn10 is highly divergent from other co-chaperonins. For a more detailed analysis, chl-Cpn10 was compared with GroES (Fig. 1 c). The crystal structure of GroES has nine β-sheets and the mobile loop (5Hunt J.F. Weaver A.J. Landry S.J. Gierasch L. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1996; 379: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The mobile loop is the region that interacts with GroEL. The fourth and fifth β-sheets compose the roof structure of the GroES heptameric dome. When both the 8-residue gap between Lys-106 and Arg-107 of chl-Cpn10 and the 2-residue gap in the mobile loop region of GroES were inserted, identical residues were found in the corresponding regions of the third, sixth, and ninth β-sheet of GroES (Fig. 1 c). Thus, chl-Cpn10 might lack one domain, and the oligomer of chl-Cpn10 might have a smaller roof structure or no roof structure. Gp31 is a co-chaperonin encoded by bacteriophage T4 and mediates the folding and assembly of the T4 major capsid protein, Gp23, with GroEL. Because T4 cannot propagate in the absence of Gp31, GroES cannot substitute for Gp31 (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). From its crystal structure, the roof structure of Gp31 was found to be completely absent, leaving a cavity of at least 16 Å in diameter (26Hunt J.F. van der Vies S.M. Henry L. Deisenhofer J. Cell. 1997; 90: 361-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Due to the absence of the roof structure of Gp31, the complexes between GroEL and Gp31 might have a larger substrate-binding cavity than GroEL and GroES. The molecular mass of Gp23, 55 kDa, is almost at the limit of size to interact with GroEL. It has been speculated that Gp31 evolved to expand the substrate-binding cavity of GroEL and to mediate the folding of Gp23 more easily. It is an exciting speculation that chl-Cpn10 has its own specific substrates and evolved with a specialized function. In fact, chl-Cpn10 has a different activity from Cpn20 as a co-chaperonin of GroEL on the refolding of denatured protein, as discussed below. The chaperonin-assisted protein folding assay was performed to study whether chl-Cpn10 works as a co-chaperonin. The polypeptide containing residues 50–139 of chl-Cpn10 was expressed in E. coli. The segment containing the 6 histidine residues (His tag) was fused to the amino terminus. Because the expressed His-tagged chl-Cpn10 was insoluble, it was immobilized on a Ni-coupling column after being solubilized with 8 m urea and renatured by a gradual decrease of urea from 6 m to 1 m and then eluted by imidazole. The purified His-tagged chl-Cpn10, as judged from the Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining pattern (Fig.3 a), was used for assays. CS was used as a substrate. At 35 °C, denatured CS is not permissive for spontaneous folding, and the recovery of CS activity depends on chaperonins (15Schmidt M. Buchner J. Todd M.J. Lorimer G.H. Viitanen P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10304-10311Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GroEL was used as a chaperonin. As shown in Fig.3 b, about 30% of the CS activity was recovered with His-tagged chl-Cpn10. By doubling the amounts of chl-Cpn10, the recovery of CS activity was increased slightly. These results confirmed that the His-tagged Cpn10 homologue could interact with GroEL and work as a co-chaperonin. In this assay, the authentic co-chaperonin, GroES, recovered about 70% activity. The previous study showed that the activity of mitochondrial Cpn10 containing the His tag at its amino terminus was the same as that of GroES (19Koumoto Y. Shimada T. Kondo M. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. HaraNishimura I. Nishimura M. Plant J. 1999; 17: 467-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This indicates that the amino-terminal His tag has no effect on His-tagged mitochondrial Cpn10 in this assay, and the His tag did not seem to prevent co-chaperonins from binding to GroEL. It was shown that about 55% of the CS activity was recovered with His-tagged Cpn20 (Fig. 3). The activity of Cpn20 was higher than that of chl-Cpn10, although chl-Cpn10 is the same single-type co-chaperonin as GroES. It was suggested that the low activity of chl-Cpn10 was caused by sequence specificity. Because the length of the mobile loop of chl-Cpn10 is expected to be longer than that of GroES, it seems that chl-Cpn10 is not able to bind GroEL efficiently. To confirm the localization of chl-Cpn10, immunogold labeling was performed. We have previously revealed by immunogold labeling that mitochondrial Cpn10, which was expressed in a transgenic plant, is exclusively localized in mitochondria (23Koumoto Y. Tsugeki R. Shimada T. Mori H. Kondo M. Hara-Nishimura I. Nishimura M. Plant J. 1996; 10: 1119-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Because endogenous chl-Cpn10 was hardly detectable by immunogold labeling, the transgenic Arabidopsis harboring chl-Cpn10 cDNA was prepared. chl-Cpn10 was expressed under regulation of the 35S promoter from cauliflower mosaic virus. An immunoblot analysis of wild-type and transgenicArabidopsis using rosette leaves is shown in Fig.4 a. Because the immunoreactive bands in both lanes were almost the same size, it is expected that the overexpressed chl-Cpn10 was imported into chloroplasts and processed correctly. Seedlings of transgenic Arabidopsis, which were grown in the dark for 4 days, were transferred and kept in continuous light for 1 day. Cotyledons became green within 1 day of illumination, and their chloroplasts had stacked thylakoid membranes. The gold particles for chl-Cpn10 were restricted exclusively to a chloroplast (Fig.4 b), and most of them were in contact with thylakoid membranes (Fig. 4 c). Fractionation analysis was performed to examine whether chl-Cpn10 was associated with thylakoid membrane. Because it was difficult to isolate chloroplasts fromArabidopsis, intact chloroplasts were isolated from mature tobacco leaves. After disruption by osmotic shock, the insoluble precipitates containing thylakoid membrane and the soluble fraction were separated. Immunoblot analysis of these two fractions is shown in Fig. 5. The immunoreactive band for chl-Cpn10 was detected in the soluble fraction. Cpn20, which was used as a stromal control, was concentrated in the soluble fraction. These results indicated that chl-Cpn10 was not associated with thylakoid membrane. The expression pattern of the chl-Cpn10 gene was also examined. Fig.6 a shows the Northern blotting of RNA extracted from the roots, stems, and leaves of matureArabidopsis plants. Because of the weak chl-Cpn10 signal, 20 µg of total RNA was used. The amount of ribosomal RNA in each lane was almost the same. mRNA for chl-Cpn10 was present in the leaves and stems, but the signal was not detected in the roots. Cpn20 was observed in these three organs (19Koumoto Y. Shimada T. Kondo M. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. HaraNishimura I. Nishimura M. Plant J. 1999; 17: 467-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These results suggested that chl-Cpn10 and Cpn20 work independently. Next, the effect of heat treatment on the accumulation of chl-Cpn10 mRNA was examined (Fig. 6 b). For detailed study, we performed quantitative reverse transcription-PCR with a fluorescent probe, which is specific to the target PCR product. First, the total RNA was prepared from Arabidopsis plants incubated at 35 °C for various lengths of time. Five µg of RNA was used for reverse transcription with an oligo(dT) primer. Because almost the same results were observed with duplicates, it seems to be unnecessary to take the efficiency of reverse transcription into consideration. One gene, APETALA 2 (AP2; Ref. 27Jofuku K.D. den Boer B.G. Van Montagu M. Okamuro J.K. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar) was used as a control because the amount of AP2 mRNA was constant during heat treatment. Fig.6 c shows the amount of chl-Cpn10 mRNA that was normalized by the amount of AP2 mRNA. Heat treatment did not change the amount of chl-Cpn10 mRNA drastically. This result was distinct from those of both mitochondrial Cpn10 and chloroplast Cpn20, whose mRNAs showed nearly 10-fold and 5-fold increases by heat treatment, respectively. This also indicated that chl-Cpn10 belongs to a divergent class of co-chaperonin. To investigate the differences between chl-Cpn10 and Cpn20, the accumulation pattern of chl-Cpn10 protein during germination and greening was examined.Arabidopsis seeds were germinated in the dark. Cotyledons were yellow during the incubation in the dark and became fully green within 1 day of exposure to light. In cells exposed to light, proteins involved in photosynthetic electron transfer, such as light harvesting complex II, were rapidly accumulated (Fig.7, bottom). One of the major stromal proteins involved in photosynthetic carbon metabolism, RuBisCO, was accumulated gradually in the dark, especially after a 5-day incubation. A comparison of the amounts of RuBisCO in lane 5and in lane 4D1L indicated that the accumulation was also accelerated by light. Accumulation of chl-Cpn10 was observed after a 5-day incubation in the dark and accelerated by light, similar to that of RuBisCO (Fig. 7, top panel). The amount of chl-Cpn10 in cotyledon grown for 7 days in the dark (7D cotyledon) was comparable with that in a light-exposed cotyledon. TransgenicArabidopsis that overexpresses chl-Cpn10 was also germinated and grown for 7 days in the dark. Immunogold labeling of transgenicArabidopsis showed that chl-Cpn10 was localized in the etioplasts of a 7D cotyledon (Fig. 4 d). In contrast to chl-Cpn10, accumulation of Cpn20 was observed at an early stage of germination. This also suggested that chl-Cpn10 and Cpn20 work independently. Cpn60α and Cpn60β had been shown to bind to immobilized Cpn20 (28Baneyx F. Bertsch U. Kalbach C.E. van der Vies S.M. Soll J. Gatenby A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10695-10702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Because these Cpn60s were originally referred to as RuBisCO-binding proteins, it is known that one of their substrates is RuBisCO. Therefore, it is thought that Cpn20 facilitates the folding of RuBisCO with Cpn60α and Cpn60β. It might be reasonable that Cpn20 protein seemed to accumulate slightly faster than RuBisCO. By analogy, chl-Cpn10 might mediate the folding of the protein that accumulates later. From a search of the Arabidopsis genomic sequence, we found two Cpn60α genes and four Cpn60β genes. One of the two Cpn60α genes and three of the four Cpn60β genes may actually be expressed, judging from the presence of EST clones. Because chl-Cpn10 and Cpn20 are thought to work independently, there is a possibility that they regulate a specific partner, Cpn60. As reported previously (29Dickson R. Weiss C. Howard R.J. Alldrick S.P. Ellis R.J. Lorimer G. Azem A. Viitanen P.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11829-11835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), Cpn60α and Cpn60β are expressed in E. coli and have been characterized. This report indicated that Cpn60β could form oligomer by itself, although Cpn60α could not. Moreover, it also indicated that a homo-oligomer of Cpn60β works only with mitochondrial Cpn10, in contrast to a hetero-oligomer that is compatible with various co-chaperonins. These results suggested the possibility that one Cpn60β homologue could form its homo-oligomer and function with its specific co-chaperonin. It is possible that a chaperonin system containing chl-Cpn10 and a Cpn60β homologue exists in chloroplasts, in addition to one containing Cpn20, Cpn60α, and Cpn60β.

The very earliest steps in KDR-mediated signal transduction, and the KDR structural features that allow those steps, are just starting to be clarified. Based upon the wealth of experimental results obtained using other receptor tyrosine kinases, it is generally accepted that the molecular mechanism by which VEGF initiates signaling is through receptor dimerization followed by receptor autophosphorylation (for review, see Ref. 24Yarden Y.

KIT and PDGF receptors are growth factor receptors structurally similar to KDR, and in addition to the interactions between ligand and receptor, receptor-receptor interactions are necessary for receptor dimerization (28Blechman J.M.

Whether receptor-receptor interactions are necessary for KDR dimerization is not known. There are other reasons for suspecting that the extracellular domain of KDR contains structural features that participate in receptor activities that are independent of ligand binding. VEGF is expressed as five alternatively spliced isoforms (30Tischer E. Mitchell R. Hartman T. SIlva M. Gospodarowicz D. Fiddes J.C. Abraham J.A. J. Biol.

Although HSPG and neuropilin-1 interactions with VEGF165 participate in this response, an interaction with KDR has not been ruled out. If this were the case, then it may be expected that deletion of the relevant KDR sequences would alter VEGF165 binding properties. In this study we investigated the consequence of deleting amino acid sequences contained within KDR Ig-like domains 4–7 on receptor function. The experimental results led to the conclusion that this region contains structural features that inhibit receptor dimerization and signaling, and the binding of VEGF to KDR relieves that inhibition, allowing for receptor activation. We propose that this mechanism acts to prevent unwanted receptor dimerization in the absence of growth factor. Transfected porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) and human embryonic kidney epithelial (HEK293) cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% newborn calf serum, 0.4 μg/ml puromycin, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin. Rabbit anti-KDR antibody was isolated in our laboratory and targets a polypeptide sequence within the KDR cytosolic domain (35Dougher M. Terman B.I. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1619-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Anti-NCK, anti-PLCγ, and anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) monoclonal antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories. Peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit and sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulins were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The experimental strategy for constructing mutant KDR cDNAs involved the introduction of NotI restriction sites in both the region of KDR between Ig-like domain 7 and the membrane-spanning domain (nucleotides 2195–2202) and the regions between either Ig-like domain 3 and 4 (nucleotides 968–975) or Ig-like domains 6 and 7 (nucleotides 1961–1968). Mutagenesis was done using the native KDR cDNA cloned into an expression vector (36Terman B.I. Dougher-Vermazen M. Carrion M.E. Dimitrov D. Armellino D.C. Gospodarowicz D. Bohlen P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar) and a U.S.E. mutagenesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.). The resulting plasmids were digested withNotI and religated. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The resulting vectors were transfected into HEK293 and PAE cells, and stable transfectants were selected and expanded as described previously (35Dougher M. Terman B.I. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1619-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). For examination of the effect of VEGF on receptor autophosphorylation, and NCK and PLCγ tyrosine phosphorylation, transfected HEK293 and PAE cells were grown on 10-cm dishes until subconfluent. The cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM with 1 mm Na3VO4 for 1 h at 4 °C; 50 ng/ml VEGF was then added for 4 h at 4 °C. The cells were scraped from the dishes, pelleted, and suspended in 2 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mmNaCl, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 30 mm Na4P2O7, 30 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1% Triton X-100). After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, the lysates were pelleted, and anti-Tyr(P) was added to the supernatant. The samples were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C, and the antibodies were then immobilized on protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma). The beads were washed five times with lysis buffer and boiled in 40 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample loading buffer. Proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad). The filters were then blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20 plus 5% dry milk at 4 °C overnight and probed with specific antibodies for 4 h at room temperature. After washing, the filters were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG. The reactions were visualized through enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL;Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 1 μg of VEGF121 (R & D Systems) was added to a reaction buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and 0.5 mCi of Na125I. The final volume was 120 μl. To this mixture were added 8 μg of freshly dissolved chloramine T, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 45 s at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by the addition of 50 μl of sodium metabisulfite (2 mg/ml) and 50 μl of 10 mm KI. The solution was then centrifuged through a Sepharose G-25 spin column twice, and 30 μl of 1% gelatin was added. A small aliquot of the sample was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid to ensure the complete removal of unincorporated radiolabel. Transfected cells were grown until confluent on 24-well (4 × 105 cells/well) cell culture plates. The cells were washed twice with PBS, and 0.2 ml of DMEM containing 0.15% gelatin and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, was added. 125I-VEGF165 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or 125I-VEGF121 was added at concentrations ranging from 1 to 2,000 pm, and 10 mm VEGF and other additions were made to appropriate dishes, thus adjusting the final volume to 0.25 ml. Cells were incubated for either 1 h at room temperature or 4 h at 4 °C. A 50-μl sample of the medium for each well was taken to determine the concentration of free radioligand, and the cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing 0.1% BSA. The cells were extracted from the dishes by incubating them for 30 min with 1% Triton X-100 in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, and radioactivity of the extracts was determined in a gamma counter. Specific 125I-VEGF binding is defined as the difference between the presence and absence of 10 nm nonradioactive VEGF. Duplicate samples were analyzed. Binding affinities were calculated by Scatchard (37Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17749) Google Scholar) analysis. Transfected PAE cells were plated on eight-well Permanox plastic chamber slides coated with 0.2% gelatin and grown until 70% confluent. 50 ng/ml VEGF165 was added to certain wells for 20 min. The cells were washed twice with PBS and then fixed in 3.5% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were incubated with Hanks' solution containing 1% BSA and 0.1% glycine for 5 min at room temperature, and the solution was aspirated; this step was repeated. Cells were incubated with Hanks', 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1% BSA for 10 min and then washed in Hanks' and 1% BSA three times. Blocking buffer (Hanks', 1% BSA, and 10% goat serum) was added, and the cells were incubated for 1 h. Anti-KDR or anti-Tyr(P) antibodies were added to appropriate coverslips, which were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were washed three times with Hanks and 1% BSA followed by a 90-min incubation with secondary Cy-3-conjugated goat anti-mouse or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (1:40 dilution) (Jackson Laboratories). After washing three times with Hanks' and 1% BSA, cells were viewed under a Nikon fluorescent microscope. The KIT and PDGF receptor tyrosine kinases contain structural features adjacent to the ligand binding domains which are necessary for receptor dimerization (28Blechman J.M. Lev S. Barg J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12676-12682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and their deletion prevents both ligand binding and ligand-induced signaling. In an attempt to determine if complementary domains within KDR function in a similar manner, three mutant receptor (Fig. 1) cDNA constructs were made in which either Ig-like domains 4–7 (KDR(Ig1–3)), Ig-like domain 7 (KDR(Ig1–6)), or Ig-like domains 4–6 (KDR(Ig1–3, 7)) were deleted. KDR and KDR(Ig1–3) were expressed in HEK293 cells, and KDR, KDR(Ig1–3), KDR(Ig1–6), and KDR(Ig1–3, 7) were expressed in PAE cells. Analysis of Western blots of cell extracts using an anti-KDR antibody reveals the expression of native and mutant receptor protein in these cells at the expected sizes (Fig.2).Figure 2Expression of native and mutant receptors in HEK293 and PAE cells. Transfected HEK293 (panel A) or PAE (panel B) cells were grown to confluence on 10-cm cell culture dishes. The cells were lysed, anti-KDR immunoprecipitates were prepared, and immunoblotting was done using anti-KDR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The ability of VEGF to stimulate receptor autophosphorylation in cells expressing native and mutant receptors was then examined (Fig.3). The protocol for this experiment involved treating cells with or without 50 ng/ml VEGF, immunoprecipitation with anti-Tyr(P) antibodies, and immunoblotting with the anti-KDR antibody. For HEK293 and PAE cells expressing native KDR, there is no tyrosine phosphorylation of receptor in the absence of VEGF, and growth factor treatment induces a robust response (Fig. 3,A and B). Unexpectedly, KDR(Ig1–3), KDR(Ig1–6), and KDR(Ig1–3, 7) are heavily phosphorylated in control cells, and VEGF does not enhance that phosphorylation (Fig. 3, A,C, and D). For KDR(Ig1–3)-expressing cells, VEGF treatment results in some experiments in a decrease in the level of receptor phosphorylation (Fig. 3 A); the reason for this is not known. For the experiment shown in Fig. 3 C, two molecular weight proteins are visualized in samples prepared from KDR(Ig1–3)-expressing PAE cells; this was not observed for all experiments. The structural differences between these proteins are not known, although they could represent receptor degradation or receptor proteins containing different degrees of tyrosine phosphorylation. Receptor autophosphorylation allows for the recruitment of cellular signaling proteins to the receptor and subsequent signal transduction. We therefore tested whether cell signaling pathways that are stimulated in endothelial cells by VEGF are activated in the mutant KDR-transfected cells in the absence of growth factor. Transfected HEK293 cells were incubated with and without VEGF, cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-Tyr(P) antibodies, and immunoblotting was done using antibodies to two signaling proteins (NCK and PLCγ) that are activated by growth factor in endothelial cells (22Abedi H. Zachary I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15442-15451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) (Fig.4). Neither PLCγ (Fig. 4 A) nor NCK (Fig. 4 B) is tyrosine phosphorylated in KDR-expressing cells, and VEGF stimulates a robust response. For KDR(Ig1–3)-expressing cells, both of the signaling proteins are phosphorylated in the absence of growth factor. As is found for KDR(Ig1–3) autophosphorylation (Fig. 3 A), VEGF treatment decreases the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of both NCK and PLCγ; the mechanisms that account for this are not known. As shown in Fig. 5, the activation of more downstream signaling events is also independent of VEGF in cells transfected with mutant receptors. VEGF-induced assembly of focal adhesions plays a necessary role in the signaling pathway leading to endothelial cell migration (38Gilmore A.P. Romer L.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 8: 1209-1224Crossref Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Fig. 5, A and B, demonstrates that this effect is observed in KDR-transfected PAE cells because VEGF stimulates the number and increases the size of focal adhesions as visualized by immunofluorescent staining using the anti-Tyr(P) antibody. In the absence of VEGF treatment, both the number and size of focal adhesion complexes in KDR(Ig1–3)-expressing cells are identical to that seen for VEGF-treated KDR-expressing cells (Fig.5 C). VEGF had no effect on focal adhesion complex assembly in cells expressing KDR(Ig1–3) (data not shown). The region of KDR which is involved in direct VEGF binding has been mapped to Ig-like domains 1–3 (39Kaplan J.B. Sridharan L. Zaccardi J. Dougher-Vermazen M. Terman B.I. Growth Factors. 1997; 14: 243-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To determine whether amino acid sequences in Ig-like domains 4–7 can regulate growth factor binding, we performed125I-VEGF165 radioligand binding assays to cells expressing native and mutant receptors. KDR-expressing HEK293 and PAE cells exhibit a high number of specific125I-VEGF165 binding sites (Fig.6). The affinity of binding to transfected HEK293 cells was 85 pm (Fig. 6 A), which is similar to that which has been reported for endothelial cells expressing endogenous KDR (40Quinn T.P. Peters K.G. De Vries C. Ferrara N. Williams L.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7533-7537Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 41Vaisman N. Gospodarowicz D. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19461-19469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The affinity of binding to transfected PAE cells is significantly weaker (1,200 pm) (Fig. 6 B). This result was observed for several individual expanded cell lines derived from two separate transfection protocols (data not shown). The molecular reasons why KDR expressed in these cells exhibits this weak affinity is not clear, although other investigators have made similar observations (42Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 125I-VEGF165 binds to KDR(Ig1–3)-expressing HEK293 cells with an affinity similar to that observed for native receptor (Fig. 6 A). In contrast,125I-VEGF165 binds to KDR(Ig1–3)- and KDR(Ig1–6)-expressing PAE cells with affinities that are significantly greater than that observed for native receptor (Fig. 6 B). Radioligand bound to KDR(Ig1–3) with a greater affinity than to KDR(Ig1–6), and at an affinity that is similar to that observed for the KDR(Ig1–3)- and KDR-transfected HEK293 cells. In addition, the number of 125I-VEGF165 binding sites is reduced significantly in PAE cells expressing mutant, versus native, receptor, a result that was found when analyzing several separate stably transfected cell lines. A comparison of the results shown in Figs. 2 and 6 indicates that although the number of mutant KDR proteins expressed in PAE cells is similar to that for native KDR proteins, the number of125I-VEGF165 binding sites is significantly less for cells expressing mutant receptor. It is known that VEGF165 stimulates the internalization of KDR in endothelial cells by a mechanism that requires receptor autophosphorylation (35Dougher M. Terman B.I. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1619-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In view of the finding that KDR(Ig1–3) autophosphorylation and signaling are VEGF-independent (Figs. 3, 4, and5), we reasoned that KDR(Ig1–3) internalization may also be VEGF-independent. This would account for the decreased number of125I-VEGF165 binding sites in cells expressing mutant receptor because the radioligand does not penetrate the cell membrane and only binds to surface receptors. This hypothesis was tested using immunofluorescence protocols to examine receptor distribution in KDR- and KDR(Ig1–3)-expressing PAE cells. In cells expressing native receptor, there is weak KDR staining in the cell cytoplasm, and the cell periphery is clearly outlined, suggesting cell surface receptor (Fig.7 A). In contrast, staining of KDR(Ig1–3)-expressing cells indicates an intense spotty receptor distribution within the cytoplasm, and the line of fluorescence marking the cell periphery is not visible (Fig. 7 B). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the low number of125I-VEGF165 binding sites in cells expressing mutant receptor is because these receptors are contained in the distinct domains within the cell interior and a relatively less number at the cell surface. Receptor tyrosine kinase dimerization is the earliest step in the signaling pathway by which growth factors activate cells. In view of the finding that KDR(Ig1–3) autophosphorylation and signaling are observed in the absence of VEGF treatment, we asked whether KDR(Ig1–3) might exist constitutively in the dimeric form. VEGF-treated and control KDR- and KDR(Ig1–3)-expressing HEK293 cells were solubilized and then subjected to cross-linking analysis using disuccinimidyl suberate. The solubilization step was included because of the results indicating that the majority of KDR(Ig1–3) is internal. The results from affinity cross-linking KDR-expressing cells did not reveal the presence of covalent receptor dimers, even after VEGF treatment (Fig. 8, lanes 1–4). There may be two reasons for receptor dimers not being observed in the presence of growth factor. First, the SDS-polyacrylamide gels were run in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol, and so noncovalent receptor dimers will have dissociated during sample preparation. Second, the inefficiency of the cross-linking step may prevent detection of covalently dimerized receptors. The results were very different for KDR(Ig1–3)-expressing cells, where it was found that greater than 50% of receptors were cross-linked, even in the absence of growth factor (Fig. 8, lanes 7 and8). These results suggest that deletion of Ig-like domains 4–7 induces activation of receptor tyrosine kinase activity by allowing receptor dimerization in the absence of VEGF binding. It is concluded from the data described above that Ig domains 4–7 contain structural features that inhibit KDR autophosphorylation and signaling, and deletion of this domain relieves that inhibition. We hypothesize further that the molecular mechanism by which VEGF activates KDR is by relieving the inhibitory action of Ig domains 4–7. The binding of VEGF165 to KDR is dependent upon HSPGs (32Gitay-Goren H. Soker S. Vlodavsky I. Neufeld G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6093-6098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,33Dougher M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 35132-35141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the cellular and molecular nature of non-sterol-mediated ACAT-1 regulation remains largely unknown. Recently, using mouse macrophage-derived foam cells, Panousis and Zuckerman (12Panousis C.G. Zuckerman S.H. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 75-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that IFN-γ increased the cellular cholesteryl ester content and reduced high density lipoprotein-mediated cholesterol efflux; its cellular effects were attributed to its ability to increaseACAT-1 message (12Panousis C.G. Zuckerman S.H. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 75-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to induce down-regulation of the Tangier Disease gene (the ABC1 transporter) (16Panousis C.G. Zuckerman S.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1565-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In the current work, we showed that IFN-γ increased ACAT-1 message and protein content in human monocyte-derived macrophages. To examine the molecular mechanism of IFN-γ action on ACAT-1 gene regulation in macrophages, we identified the important cis-acting elements in the human ACAT-1 P1 promoter. In order to perform transient transfection experiments, we used THP-1 cell, a monocytic human cell line as the cell model. Upon treatment with retinoids, including all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), THP-1 cells differentiate into macrophage-like cells (17Banka C.L. Black A.S. Dyer C.A. Curtiss L.K. J.

Our results show that ATRA and IFN-γ synergistically caused up-regulation of ACAT-1 gene expression. Additional experiments revealed that ATRA causes increased gene expression of the transcription factor STAT1, while IFN-γ is essential to cause STAT1 to undergo phosphorylation dependent dimerization and to bind to the GAS site present in theACAT-1 P1 promoter.DISCUSSIONACAT-1 mRNAs and protein contents are significantly increased during the human monocyte-macrophage differentiation process in vitro (21Cheng W.

Biol. 1996; 16: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Its protein content is amply present in macrophage-derived foam cells localized in the human atherosclerotic lesion, implying that up-regulation of the ACAT-1 gene plays important roles in macrophage foam cell formation in atherosclerosis (42Miyazaki A. Sakashita N. Lee O. Takahashi K. Horiuchi S. Hakamata H. Morganelli P.M. Chang C.C.Y. Chang T.Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Bio. 1998; 18: 1568-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In mouse macrophages, ACAT-1 message was found to be up-regulated by cells with IFN-γ (12Panousis C.G. Zuckerman S.H. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 75-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular basis of these findings has not been pursued at the gene transcription level. In our current work, we showed that IFN-γ increased ACAT-1mRNAs and protein contents during the human blood monocyte-macrophage differentiation process. We then found that treating the human monocyte-like THP-1 cells with ATRA and IFN-γ caused up-regulation of ACAT-1 gene expression in cell-type specific manner. To elucidate the molecular basis of this finding, we identified a 159-bp core region with Sp1 elements that is responsible for the P1 promoter activity. This region also contains an IFN-γ activated sequence (GAS) that overlaps exactly with the second Sp1 element (TGGGCGG AA, with the Sp1 site underlined). To our knowledge, this is the first example in literature describing an overlapping Sp1/GAS site. Using luciferase constructs in transient trasfection studies, we demonstrated that the combination of IFN-γ and ATRA is needed to enhance ACAT-1 P1 promoter activity. Additional experiments using RT-PCR and EMSA showed that ATRA caused large induction of the transcription factor STAT1, while IFN-γ triggered the phosphorylation dependent activation of STAT1. The activated STAT1 then acts by binding to the overlapping GAS/Sp1 site in the ACAT-1 P1 promoter. Our work dissects the non-sterol-mediated ACAT regulation at the transcriptional level, and provides a molecular mechanism to account for part of the effects of IFN-γ in causing macrophage foam cell formation in vitro.In atherosclerosis, the infiltration of T-cells and monocyte-derived macrophages into the intimal layer of the artery is believed to lead to foam cell formation. Activated T cells found in human atheroma secrete high levels of IFN-γ (43Hansson G.K. Holm J. Jonasson L. Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 135: 169-175PubMed Google Scholar, 44Geng Y.J. Holm J. Nygren S.

IFN-γ has been shown to exert certain proatherosclerogenic actions in vitro. It inducesVCAM-1 on endothelial cells (45Li H. Cybulsky M.I. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Libby P.

On the other hand, IFN-γ has also been shown to exert protective action against atherosclerosis in certain in vitro systems examined (49Christen S. Thomas S.R. Garner B. Stocker R. J. Clin.

Our work described here may serve to explain some of the synergistic actions of ATRA and IFNs described in these studies. ACAT1 is an intracellular enzyme responsible for catalyzing the intracellular formation of cholesteryl esters from cholesterol and long-chain fatty acyl-coenzyme A (1Chang T.Y. Chang C.C.Y. Cheng D.

ACAT-1 is also present in the intestine; however, the major enzyme involved in the intestinal cholesterol absorption may be ACAT-2, which is mainly located in the apical region of the intestinal villi (7Chang C.C.

The relative tissue distributions of ACAT-1 and ACAT-2 in mice and monkeys are not entirely consistent with those found in humans (8Buhman K.K. Accad M. Novak S. Choi R.S. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L.

In macrophages and other cell types, a dynamic cholesterol-cholesteryl ester cycle exist; the formation of intracellular cholesteryl esters is catalyzed by ACAT-1, while the hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters is catalyzed by the enzyme neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase (10Brown M.S.

Freeman M.W. Libby P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 122-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, IFN-γ has also been shown to exert protective action against atherosclerosis in certain in vitro systems examined (49Christen S. Thomas S.R. Garner B. Stocker R. J. Clin.

Recently, it has been shown that apoE knockout mice crossed with the IFN-γ receptor knockout mice display reductions in lesion size, lipid accumulation, and cellularity (51Gupta S. Pablo A.M. Jiang X.C. Wang N. Tall A.R. Schindler C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2752-2761Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). In addition, in mice, post-transplant graft arteriosclerosis is associated with the presence of IFN-γ; the serological neutralization or the genetic absence of IFN-γ markedly reduces the extent of intimal expansion (52Tellides G.

These results support the notion that IFN-γ is pro-atherogenic in vivo. If this concept holds true, then our finding described here may explain some of the effects of IFN-γ on foam cell formation in vivo. IFN-γ exhibits antigrowth or antiproliferation effects in various target cells. Its effects often occur synergistically with retinoids (53Mangelsdorf, D. J., Umesono, K., Evans, R.

This heterodimerization event is considered to alter the signaling capacity and cellular responses provoked by homodimers of occupied ErbB receptors. No ligand has been identified that directly interacts with the ectodomain of ErbB-2. ErbB-2 was originally identified as the transforming oncogeneneu, which contains a point mutation in the transmembrane domain that is responsible for its oncogenic potential (4Segatto O. King C.R. Pierce J.H. Di Fiore P.P. Aaronson S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 5570-5574Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ErbB-2 also produces a transformed phenotype in experimental systems (5Di Marco E. Pierce J.H. Knicley C.L. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell.

Importantly, ErbB-2 is frequently overexpressed in carcinomas, particularly mammary and ovarian carcinomas, and is associated with a poor prognosis (8Revillion F. Bonneterre J. Peyrat J.P. Eur. J.

In many of these instances the decreased growth provoked by the loss of ErbB-2 is due to increased apoptosis. In contrast, the overexpression of ErbB-2 can prevent the induction of apoptosis (15Zhou B. Hu M. Miller S.A., Yu, Z. Xia W. Lin S. Hung M.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8027-8031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Hence, the growth-controlling activity of ErbB-2 is related to structural changes or alterations in its level of expression. The benzoquinoid anasamycin antibiotic geldanamycin was first isolated and described as an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity (16Omura S. Iwai Y. Takahashi Y. Sadakane N. Nakagawa A. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1979; 32: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Subsequently, geldanamycin was shown to possess tumoricidal activity toward cell lines that overexpress ErbB-2 (17Miller P. DiOrio C. Moyer M. Schnur R.C. Bruskin A. Cullen W. Moyer J.D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2724-2730PubMed Google Scholar). Currently geldanamycin derivatives designed to reduce toxicity are in clinical trials for certain cancer patients (18Mandler R. Wu C. Sausville E.A. Roettinger A.J. Newman D.K. Ho D. King R. Yang D. Lippman M.E. Landolfi N.F. Dadachova E. Brechbiel M.W. Waldman T. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 95: 1573-1581Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The addition of geldanamycin to cells results in an increased rate of degradation of several protein kinases, including ErbB-2 (17Miller P. DiOrio C. Moyer M. Schnur R.C. Bruskin A. Cullen W. Moyer J.D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2724-2730PubMed Google Scholar), Src (19Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G. De Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar), Raf (26Schulte T.W. Blagosklonny M. Ingui C. Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24585-24588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), and focal adhesion kinase (20Ochel H.-J. Schulte T.W. Nguyen P. Trepel J. Neckers L. Mol. Genet. Metabol. 1999; 64: 24-30Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar) as well as other growth-regulating proteins such as p53 (21Blagosklonny M. Toretsky J. Neckers L. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 933-939PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which geldanamycin provokes the degradation of these and other proteins is not clear but is thought to involve the Hsp90 family of chaperones, which are the major intracellular proteins that bind geldanamycin (22Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 420-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 23Pratt W.B. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 297-326Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the manner in which Hsp90 or other geldanamycin-binding proteins influences the physiology of ErbB-2 is not known. Geldanamycin binds to Hsp90 and inhibits its ATPase activity, which is required for its chaperone function (24Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar, 25Smith D. Whitesell L. Nair S. Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6804-6812Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Although association of Hsp90 with Src (19Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G. De Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar) and Raf (26Schulte T.W. Blagosklonny M. Ingui C. Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24585-24588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) have been documented, only GRP94 was originally reported to be associated with ErbB-2 (27Chavany C. Mimnagh E. Miller P. Bitton R. Nguyen P. Trepel J. Whitesell L. Schnur R. Moyer J.D. Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4974-4977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The idea that GRP94 mediates geldanamycin-induced degradation of ErbB-2 was not widely accepted, however, due to its subcellular localization (31Nicchita C. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and the fact that geldanamycin-sensitivity requires the tyrosine kinase domain of ErbB-2 (17Miller P. DiOrio C. Moyer M. Schnur R.C. Bruskin A. Cullen W. Moyer J.D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2724-2730PubMed Google Scholar, 29Tikhomirov O. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26625-26631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), which is never present within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. However, recently it has been reported that Hsp90 does, in fact, associate with ErbB-2 in a manner that is disrupted by the presence of geldanamycin (30Xu W. Mimnaugh E.G Rosser M.F. Nicchitta C. Marcu M. Yarden Y. Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3702-3708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Hence it is possible that Hsp90 is associated with the tyrosine kinase domain of ErbB-2 and may regulate the conformation or the enzymatic function of ErbB-2. Geldanamycin then represents a tool with which to perturb that association. A previous study of ErbB-2 degradation stimulated by geldanamycin demonstrated the appearance of two fragments (29Tikhomirov O. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26625-26631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). One large fragment of 135 kDa included the ectodomain, the transmembrane domain, and part of the cytoplasmic domain. The other fragment of 23 kDa was derived from the carboxyl-terminal portion of the ErbB-2 cytoplasmic domain. These studies also indicated that the 135-kDa fragment was degraded by lysosomes, whereas degradation of the 23-kDa fragment depended on proteosome function. In the experiments reported in this manuscript, the exact nature of the 23-kDa fragment is described as is the nature of the enzyme that produces this fragment from ErbB-2. Geldanamycin, curcumin, staurosporin, and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents were purchased from Sigma. Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was from Bio-Rad.N-Acetyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinyl-l-norleucinal (ALLN),1 caspase inhibitor I (Z-VAD-FMK), and proteasome inhibitor I were from Calbiochem. Monoclonal antibody against the ErbB-2 extracellular domain (Ab5) was from Transduction Laboratories, whereas monoclonal antibody against the ErbB-2 carboxyl-terminal domain (Ab3) was purchased from Calbiochem. The pcDNA3.1+ vector was obtained from Invitrogen. Goat anti-mouse antibody cross-linked with horseradish peroxidase was from Zymed Laboratories Inc., and LipofectAMINE was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. SKBr3 human breast cancer cells were grown to near confluence in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in McCoy's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and then washed and treated with the indicated compounds in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cos7 cells were grown overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum to about 80% confluence and then transfected with LipofectAMINE according to the manufacture's recommendations (3 μg of DNA of pcDNA3.1+ vector was used per 60-mm culture dish). ErbB-2 mutants were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis using a megaprimer approach. To facilitate manipulations with the ErbB-2 intracellular region, a SalI restriction site downstream of the transmembrane region was generated by polymerase chain reaction (silent mutagenesis) using the following primers: primer 1, ACT ACG TCC AGT TCT AGA TCA CAC TGG CAC GTC CAG ACC (3′); primer 2, AAG TAC ACG ATG CGT CGA CTG CTG CAG (5′); primer 3, CTG CAG CAG TCG ACG CAT CGT GTA(3′); primer 4, AGA CCC AAG CTG GCT AGC GCC ACC ATG GAG CTG GCG GCC TTG TGC CGC(5′). The resultant two polymerase chain reaction products (primers 1 and 2; primers 3 and 4) were cut with NheI, SalI, and XbaI restriction sites and ligated into the pcDNA3.1+ vector through NheI and XbaI sites (3-piece ligation). Mutations in the ErbB-2 carboxyl terminus were introduced in the first round of polymerase chain reaction with primer 1 as the 3′ primer and the following 5′ primers: primer 5, CTG CCC TCT GAG ACT GCT GGC TAC GTT (D1125-A); primer 6, TCT GAG ACT GAA GGC TAC GTT (D1125-E); primer 7, TCT GAG ACT GAT GCC TAC GTT GC (G1126-A). One strand of these products was used as the 3′ primer in the second round of polymerase chain reaction with primer 2 as the 5′ primer. The final products were ligated through SalI and XbaI restriction sites into the pcDNA3.1+ vector. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. At the end of each experiment the cells were solubilized by scraping into cold lysis buffer (10 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmNa3VO4). The lysates were then clarified by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 10 min), and equal aliquots (40 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. Proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for Western blotting. The membrane was blocked by incubation with 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate buffer saline for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated for 1 h with the indicated primary antibody in TBSTw buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.2% nonfat milk), washed 3 times in the same buffer, and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody. The membrane was then washed five times with TBSTw buffer and visualized by ECL. SKBr3 cells were grown on 20 150-mm tissue culture dishes to 80% confluence (∼10 × 106 cells/plate) and washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cells were then preincubated for 1 h with ALLN (250 μm) and treated with geldanamycin (3 μm) for 5 h. Subsequently, the cells were scraped with a rubber policeman into cold lysis buffer and centrifuged (20,000 × g, 30 min). The high molecular weight proteins, including native ErbB-2, were removed by ultrafiltration using a Centriplus membrane with a cut-off of 100 kDa (Millipore). The filtrate (∼30 ml) was incubated with 40 μg of antibody against ErbB-2 carboxyl terminus and protein G-Sepharose for 2 h and then washed five times with lysis buffer. Immunoreactive material was separated by 13% SDS-PAGE, transferred to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and stained with Coomassie Blue. The 23-kDa band was cut out of the membrane and subjected to 7 cycles of Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems Procise sequencer. Previously, we have shown that when the mammary carcinoma cell line SKBr3 is incubated with geldanamycin, a 23-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment of ErbB-2 is produced (29Tikhomirov O. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26625-26631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This fragment is rapidly degraded by proteosome activity unless a proteosome inhibitor is added. The data in Fig.1 show that a similar 23-kDa fragment accumulates when transfected Cos7 transiently expressing human ErbB-2 are treated with geldanamycin and ALLN, a proteosome inhibitor. To isolate this 23-kDa ErbB-2 fragment for sequence analysis, we employed transfected Cos7 cells treated with geldanamycin and ALLN for 6 h. ErbB-2 was then immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with an antibody to the carboxyl terminus of ErbB-2. The resulting immunoprecipitate was subjected to SDS-PAGE, the separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the membrane was stained with Coomassie. The stained protein band at 23 kDa representing the carboxyl-terminal ErbB-2 fragment was clearly visible. The 23-kDa peptide was eluted from the membrane and subjected to automated Edman amino-terminal microsequencing, which yielded a sequence of GYVAPLT through the first seven cycles. There was no evidence of heterogeneity in this sequence, which if present might indicate proteolytic processing of the amino terminus of the fragment. The recovered sequence corresponds exactly to residues 1126–1132 in the deduced cDNA sequence of human ErbB-2 (32Coussen L. Yang-Feng T.L. Liao Y.-C. Chen E. Gray A. McGrath J. Seeburg P.H. Libermann T.A. Schlessinger J. Francke U. Levinson A. Ullrich A. Science. 1985; 230: 1132-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). Although it is possible that post-cleavage amino-terminal processing has taken place to yield the isolated 23-kDa fragment, we considered whether sequence information would predict a known proteolytic cleavage consensus site between residues 1125 and 1126 in ErbB-2. This analysis did show that there is a significant similarity between the ErbB-2 sequence immediately upstream from Gly-1126, which is PSETD, and caspase consensus cleavage sites that have been defined using a positional scanning combinatorial substrate library (33Margolin N.

Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 37Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4146) Google Scholar). These caspase cleavage sequences are characterized by an essential Asp residue at the P1 position and frequently a Glu residue at the P3 position which correspond, respectively, to Asp-1125 and Glu-1123 in the ErbB-2 sequence. To test the possibility that this putative caspase cleavage sequence in ErbB-2 was necessary to generate the 23-kDa ErbB-2 fragment, site-directed mutagenesis was employed. The Asp at residue 1125 of ErbB-2 was mutated to either Ala or Glu, and Gly-1126 was changed to Ala. In regard to the conservative D1125E mutation, published structural data show that the aspartyl carboxylate side chain at the P1 position in a caspase substrate fits into a highly restrictive “socket” of enzyme that does not accommodate the side chain of a glutamate residue (36Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). The wild-type and mutant ErbB-2 constructs were transiently expressed in Cos7 cells and exposed to geldanamycin without or with ALLN. The results in Fig. 2 show that mutagenesis of Asp-1125 to either Glu or Ala prevented production of the 23-kDa fragment from ErbB-2. Interestingly, in the case of these two mutations a new fragment of 30 kDa was generated from the carboxyl terminus of ErbB-2, and the depletion of the cellular level of native ErbB-2 by geldanamycin was not affected. In the case of the G1126A mutation, there was no effect on geldanamycin-induced ErbB-2 degradation or formation of the 23-kDa fragment. That mutagenesis of Gly-1126 did not abrogate production of the 23-kDa fragment is not surprising in view of the fact that caspase cleavage sites, although preferring Gly at the P′1 position, exhibit considerable flexibility at this position (35Talanian R.V. Quinlan C. Trautz S. Hackett M.C. Mankovich J. Banach D. Ghayur T. Brady K.D. Wong W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9677-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that caspase activity is required for production of this 23-kDa fragment from ErbB-2, the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (38McColl K.S. He H. Zhong H. Whitacre C.M. Berger N.A. Distelhorst C.W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 139: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 39Pronk G.J. Ramer K. Amiri P. Williams L.T. Science. 1996; 271: 808-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) was tested. As can be seen in the data presented in Fig. 3, Z-VAD-FMK completely prevented the formation of the 23-kDa ErbB-2 fragment induced by geldanamycin. In the D1125E ErbB-2 mutant geldanamycin induces a 30-kDa fragment instead of the 23-kDa fragment. To determine whether the formation of this 30-kDa fragment might also be caspase-dependent, we incubated cells expressing the D1125E mutant with geldanamycin in the presence and absence of Z-VAD-FMK. The data shown in Fig. 4 indicate that the amount of the 30-kDa fragment is significantly reduced when these cells are exposed to geldanamycin in the presence of the caspase inhibitor.Figure 4Influence of caspase inhibitor on formation of the 30-kDa ErbB-2 fragment. The ErbB-2 mutant D1125A was expressed in Cos7 cells. The cells were then preincubated with ALLN (250 μm) for 1 h and with geldanamycin (GA, 3 μm) for an additional 6 h. Cell lysates (40 μg) were prepared and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (W.B.) with antibody against carboxyl-terminal domain (CT) of ErbB-2. Bound antibody was detected by ECL. An arrowhead indicates the 30-kDa band.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Geldanamycin induces ErbB-2 degradation, in part through a caspase-dependent mechanism, and geldanamycin is known to induce apoptosis in some cell lines (40Khan S.M. Oliver R.H. Dauffenbach L.M. Yeh J.J. Fertil. Steril. 2000; 74: 359-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether other reported inducers of apoptosis, particularly in mammary carcinoma cell lines, also provoke ErbB-2 degradation. Two known stimulators of apoptosis, which are also known protein kinase inhibitors, did induce ErbB-2 degradation in a manner similar to geldanamycin. The results with staurosporin are shown in Fig.5. The data in the upper panelof Fig. 5 A show that staurosporin decreases the level of native ErbB-2 with about the same time course as that previously reported for geldanamycin (17Miller P. DiOrio C. Moyer M. Schnur R.C. Bruskin A. Cullen W. Moyer J.D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2724-2730PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the results in the upper panel of Fig. 5 B show that maximal degradation of ErbB-2 was achieved with a staurosporin concentration of ∼2 μm. Significantly, the ErbB-2 degradation elicited by staurosporin is accompanied by the production of a 23-kDa carboxyl-terminal ErbB-2 fragment, shown in the lower panelsof Figs. 5, A and B, similar to that recorded for degradation induced by geldanamycin. The data in Fig.6 demonstrate that formation of this 23-kDa fragment from ErbB-2 in the presence of staurosporin is prevented by the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. Comparison of geldanamycin and staurosporin-induced ErbB-2 degradation in the same cell line (SKBr3) can be made by comparing the data in Figs. 3 and 6, respectively. The results show that in the absence of ALLN, the 23-kDa fragment produced by staurosporin accumulates to a significantly greater level than the same fragment generated in geldanamycin-treated cells. Also, the presence of ALLN significantly increases the level of this fragment in geldanamycin-treated cells but actually decreases the fragment level in staurosporin-treated cells. These results suggest significant, but unknown, distinctions in the mechanisms of action of geldanamycin and staurosporin.Figure 6Capacity of caspase inhibitor to block the 23-kDa ErbB-2 fragment formation induced by staurosporin. SKBr3 cells were preincubated with ALLN (250 μm) and Z-VAD-FMK (50 μm) for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with staurosporin (5 μm) for an additional 6 h.

Lin J.-K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1317: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The data in Fig.7 show that curcumin depletion of cellular ErbB-2 involves production of a 23-kDa ErbB-2 carboxyl-terminal fragment, which is stabilized in the presence of proteasome inhibitor I. Furthermore, the formation of this fragment in cells treated with curcumin is blocked in the presence of Z-VAD-FMK. However, not all inducers of apoptosis provoked ErbB-2 degradation in SKBr3 cells. Etoposide (100 μm), actinomycin D (5 μg/ml), hydroxyurea (5 μm), camptothecin (100 μm), paclitaxel (1 μm) with or without the MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase) inhibitor PD98059 (50 μm) (45McKeigan J.P. Collins T.S. Ting J.P.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38953-38956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and the potent kinase inhibitor H7 (100 μm) did not decrease ErbB-2 levels in SKBr3. In many cases, these compounds did induce dramatic morphological changes in the cells. Both staurosporin and geldanamycin induce the degradation of ErbB-2 with formation of a 23-kDa fragment that is dependent on caspase activity. We have asked whether the inhibition of caspase activity interferes with the drug-induced degradation of the native 185-kDa ErbB-2 molecule. The data in Fig. 8 show that Z-VAD-FMK does not block geldanamycin-induced ErbB-2 degradation, but the inhibitor significantly attenuates degradation induced by staurosporin. Like geldanamycin-induced ErbB-2 degradation, curcumin-mediated degradation of this transmembrane protein was not prevented by Z-VAD-FMK (data not shown). The induction of ErbB-2 degradation by geldanamycin is associated with proteolytic fragmentation of the receptor (29Tikhomirov O. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26625-26631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This includes the formation of a 23-kDa fragment that is recognized by antibodies as an epitope, within residues 1242–1255, in the carboxyl-terminal domain of the ErbB-2. Sequencing of this fragment shows that its amino terminus corresponds to Gly-1126 in the human ErbB-2 sequence. If the 23-kDa fragment includes all residues from Gly-1126 to the ErbB-2 carboxyl terminus Val-1255, then it has a calculated molecular mass of 16,091. Hence its apparent Mr value on SDS-PAGE is an overestimation of the actual mass due to anomalous migration in the gel. This fragment would contain most of the known ErbB-2 autophosphorylation sites that provide its coupling to signal transduction proteins (46Margolis B.L. Lax I. Kris R. Dombalagian M. Honnegger A.M.

Schlessinger J. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 3-7PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the carboxyl-terminal PDZ domain recognition motif that is involved in targeting ErbB-2 to the basolateral surface of polarized cells (48Borg J. Marchetto S. Le Bivic A. Ollendorff V. Jaulin-Bastard F. Saito H. Fournier E. Adelaide J. Margolis B. Birnbaum D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). It is possible that cleavage of ErbB-2 occurs between residues 1125 and 1126 to generate the 23-kDa fragment or that the primary cleavage event occurs upstream of these residues, and post-cleavage processing occurs at the amino terminus to produce the observed fragment. Several facts suggest that the former is more plausible. First, we did not detect heterogeneity in the amino-terminal amino acids recovered in microsequencing of this fragment. Second, the residues immediately upstream of Gly-1126 constitute a site favorable for caspase-dependent cleavage. This includes the essential Asp at residue 1125. Analysis of caspase cleavage sites shows that cleavage invariably occurs immediately after an Asp residue at the P1 position and frequently includes a Glu residue at the P3 position (34Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D. J. Biol.

Wong W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9677-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar), which in this instance corresponds to Glu-1123 in the ErbB-2 sequence. Our data show that mutagenesis of the essential Asp at position P1 (residue 1125) prevents geldanamycin-induced formation of the 23-kDa fragment. This includes the conservative D1125E mutation, which on the basis of the structure of caspase active sites with model substrates, is predicted to inhibit peptide bond hydrolysis by these proteases (36Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1028-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). Last, the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK blocks geldanamycin-induced formation of the 23-kDa peptide. Hence, we conclude that this fragment is formed by cleavage between residues 1125 and 1126 in ErbB-2. It is interesting that when Asp-1125 is mutated in ErbB-2, geldanamycin treatment of cells gives rise to a new carboxyl-terminal fragment of 30 kDa instead of the 23-kDa fragment. Formation of this fragment in the ErbB-2 mutant is partially sensitive to the caspase inhibitor. There are consensus caspase cleavage sites upstream of Asp-1125 that could generate the 30-kDa fragment. These include Asp-1087 and Asp-1016 and Asp-1019, which constitute a nested cleavage site. Cleavage at Asp-1087 would directly produce a carboxyl-terminal ErbB-2 fragment of about 30 kDa, whereas cleavage at Asp-1016 or Asp-1019 would generate a theoretical 40-kDa fragment, which would require additional processing to produce the observed 30-kDa fragment. It is important to note that when the caspase-dependent cleavages at the carboxyl terminus are prevented by the addition of Z-VAD-FMK to geldanamycin-treated cells, the cellular content of the native ErbB-2 molecule is still decreased. This implies that cleavage at the ErbB-2 carboxyl terminus is not necessary to initiate the geldanamycin-dependent reduction in the ErbB-2 levels. However, Z-VAD-FMK does prevent staurosporin-dependent degradation of the native ErbB-2 molecule, suggesting that caspase activity is more significant in the degradation of ErbB-2 by staurosporin than by geldanamycin. The current proposed mechanism for geldanamycin-induced ErbB-2 degradation involves the drug-dependent dissociation of Hsp90 from the kinase domain of ErbB-2 (27Chavany C. Mimnagh E. Miller P.

Since geldanamycin is known to induce apoptosis and some but not all cell types (40Khan S.M. Oliver R.H. Dauffenbach L.M. Yeh J.J. Fertil.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1799-1804PubMed Google Scholar) and, as mentioned above, caspase activity seems involved in ErbB-2 degradation induced by this drug, we tested other known inducers of apoptosis for their capacity to provoke ErbB-2 degradation and formation of the 23-kDa fragment. Of the various inducers of apoptosis tested, two compounds (staurosporin and curcumin) were found to promote formation of a 23-kDa fragment. Others report that curcumin inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of ErbB-2 and depletes the cellular content of native ErbB-2 (41Hong R.-L. Spohn W.H. Hung M.-C. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 1884-1891PubMed Google Scholar). Curcumin also induces an apoptotic response in mammary carcinoma cells (50Ramachandran C. You W. Breast Cancer Res. 1999; 54: 269-278Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Curcumin has been reported to dissociate the endoplasmic reticulum heat shock protein GRP94 from ErbB-2 (41Hong R.-L. Spohn W.H. Hung M.-C. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 1884-1891PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether curcumin actually binds to GRP94, and its effect on Hsp90 has not been reported. Less is known regarding the effects of staurosporin on ErbB-2. Staurosporin, a broad spectrum protein kinase inhibitor, has not been reported to interact with heat shock proteins and is well described as an inducer of apoptosis (51Andersson M. Sjostrand J. Petersen A. Honarvar A.K. Karlsson J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 2623-2632PubMed Google Scholar, 52Rokhlin O.W. Glover R.A. Cohen M.B. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5870-5875PubMed Google Scholar). Staurosporin, like geldanamycin and curcumin, is a weak inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases (51Andersson M. Sjostrand J. Petersen A. Honarvar A.K. Karlsson J. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 2623-2632PubMed Google Scholar) but has not been previously shown to alter the cellular level of ErbB-2. The similarities in ErbB-2 metabolism between cells treated with geldanamycin or staurosporin suggest that the observed degradation of ErbB-2 by these compounds does not necessarily have to proceed through dissociation of heat shock proteins from ErbB-2. It may be that inhibition of kinase activities along with promotion of caspase activities is sufficient for ErbB-2 degradation. The identity of the target kinases, however, is unclear. It has been reported that the metabolic stability of a kinase-negative ErbB-2 mutant is decreased by geldanamycin (30Xu W. Mimnaugh E.G Rosser M.F. Nicchitta C. Marcu M. Yarden Y. Neckers L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3702-3708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), which suggests that perhaps non-tyrosine kinases are the target of these drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2327877875,"In this study, we show that upon thrombopoietin (Tpo) stimulation the two adapter proteins Gab1 and Gab2 are strongly tyrosine phosphorylated and associated with Shc, SHP2, PI 3-kinase and Grb2 in mpl-expressing UT7 cells. Although Gab1 and Gab2 seem to mediate overlapping biological signals in many cells, only Gab1 is expressed and phosphorylated in response to Tpo in primary human megakaryocytic progenitors; furthermore, it associates with the same proteins. Although a low level of tyrosine phosphorylated IRS-2 protein is also detected in PI 3-kinase immunoprecipitates, Gab proteins are the essential proteins associated with PI 3-kinase after Tpo stimulation. We demonstrate that, albeit no association is detected between the Tpo receptor mpl and Gab proteins, Y112 located in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of mpl is required for Gab1/2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Gab proteins are not tyrosine phosphorylated after Tpo stimulation of UT-7 and Ba/F3 cells expressing a mpl mutant lacking Y112. Moreover, no activation of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway is observed in cells expressing this mpl mutant. Finally, we show that this mutant does not allow cell proliferation, thereby confirming that PI 3-kinase activation is required for Tpo-induced cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W1989412006,"Mechanisms underlying radiation and chemotherapy resistance, the hallmark of human melanoma, are not well understood. Here we demonstrate that expression levels of signal adaptor protein TRAF2 coincide with melanoma resistance to UV-irradiation. Altered TRAF2 signaling by a form of TRAF2, which lacks the ring finger domain (TRAF2DeltaN), increases activities of p38 MAPK, ATF2, and the level of TNFalpha expression. Forced expression of TRAF2DeltaN in HHMSX highly metastatic melanoma cells that lack Fas expression and thus utilize the TNFalpha-TNFR1 as the major apoptotic pathway sensitized cells to UV-induced apoptosis. An over twofold increase in degree of apoptosis was observed in TRAF2DeltaN expressing cells that were treated with actinomycin D, anisomycin or with the radiomimetic drug neocarzinostatin. Sensitization by TRAF2DeltaN is selective since it was not observed in response to either Taxol or cis-platinum treatment. TRAF2DeltaN effects are primarily mediated via p38 since inhibition of p38 reduces, whereas activation of p38 promotes the level of UV-induced apoptosis. Conversely, activation of IKK attenuates the sensitization of melanoma by TRAF2DeltaN, indicating that p38-mediated suppression of NF-kappaB activity is among TRAF2DeltaN effects. Our finding identifies p38, TNFalpha and NF-kappaB among key players that efficiently sensitizes melanoma cells to UV-, ribotoxic (anisomycin) and radiomimetic chemicals-induced programmed cell death in response to aberrant TRAF2 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2041173282,"To evaluate the role of the NF-κB signaling pathway in oncogenic transformation, we expressed IκBβ, a specific inhibitor of NF-κB, in two human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, A549 and H441. Expression of IκBβ significantly reduced NF-κB activation induced by cotransfection with p65/RelA or TNF-α and abrogated the basal NF-κB activity in A549 cells. Transfection of IκBβ into A549, H441 and K-ras-transformed NIH3T3 cells suppressed anchorage-independent growth as measured by colony formation in soft agar. Anchorage-independent growth of vector-transfected A549 cells in reduced serum could be enhanced by both EGF and IGF-I. In contrast, only EGF but not IGF-I could induce anchorage-independent growth of IκBβ-expressing A549 cells, suggesting that the IGF-I signaling pathway regulating growth and survival may be blocked by IκBβ. Interestingly, expression of IκBβ suppressed growth of A549 cells in low serum in vitro without affecting in vivo growth subcutaneously in nude mice. However, metastatic growth of IκBβ-expressing A549 cells in the lungs of nude mice was significantly inhibited. These results provide evidence that NFκB plays an important role in anchorage-independent growth and metastatic growth of lung carcinoma cells."

Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 22Senes A. Gerstein M. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 921-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). We chose GPA as a model protein to investigate hetero-association of different transmembrane segments. GPA has a known homo-oligomerization motif, which was implicated in hetero-oligomerization in vitro (2Langosch D. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 19Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 21Brosig B. Langosch D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1052-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 22Senes A. Gerstein M. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 921-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Until now, detection of hetero-association between proteins in the membrane was mostly restricted to in vitro methods. In the case of GPA, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis experiments suggested hetero-oligomerization of a wild type transmembrane domain linked to staphylococcal nuclease with mutant peptides through the homo-oligomerization motif (19Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 23Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). We devised a scheme to detect direct interaction between hetero-proteins in a biological membrane. We then applied this method to wild type GPA ([WT]GPA) and peptide analogs to study their hetero-association. Our results suggest the importance of an extended motif for hetero-association of GPA within the membrane of Escherichia coli. This study emphasizes the significance of using such displacement strategies in the investigation of membrane complexes. In turn, these strategies may prove useful in modulation of membrane protein activity. The peptides were synthesized by a standard solid phase method on PAM-resin as described (24Merrifield R.B. Vizioli L.D. Boman H.G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5020-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 25Gerber D. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23602-23607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The peptides were cleaved from the resin by HF treatment and purified by reverse phase-HPLC. Purity (∼99%) was confirmed by analytical HPLC. The peptide compositions were confirmed by Platform LCZ electrospray mass spectrometry. The boc protecting group was removed from the N terminus of the peptides by incubation with trifluoroacetic acid, whereas all the other reactive amine groups of the attached peptides were kept protected. The acidity was neutralized with 5% (v/v) N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIEA 5%). The resin-bound peptides were then treated with 4-chloro-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole fluoride (NBD-F) (2 eq) in dry dimethylformamide (DMF), leading to the formation of resin-bound N-NBD peptides, respectively. After 1 h, the resins were washed thoroughly with DMF and then with methylene chloride. The labeled peptides were cleaved from the resin and purified as described previously. Lipid films were prepared at a ratio of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) phosphatidylglycerol (PG) (7:3, w/w) as previously described (26Hetru C. Letellier L. Oren Z. Hoffmann J.A. Shai Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Lipids were resuspended by vigorous vortexing. SUVs were obtained by sonication of the lipid suspensions for 2 min in a water bath-type sonicator. The ToxR transcription activator can be used successfully to assess weak protein interactions within the E. coli membrane. A GPA transmembrane-encoding DNA cassette was previously inserted between the maltose-binding protein and the ToxR transcription activator (2Langosch D. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Transcription activation is mediated by expressing the construct, ToxR-GPA, in the indicator strain FHK12. After transforming FHK12 cells, 1-ml cultures (8 repeats) were grown in the presence of chloramphenicol and 0.1 µm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 20 h at 37 °C. β-galactosidase activity was quantified in crude cell lysates after the addition of o-nitrophenylgalactoside and monitoring the reaction at 405 nm for 20 min at 30-s intervals at 28 °C. Specific β-galactosidase activity was measured in Miller units (2Langosch D. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Hetero-association was detected using ToxR-GPA grown in the presence of an exogenous peptide. Inhibition was calculated according to Equation1, I=1−Apeptide−AbaselineAmax−AbaselineEquation 1 where I is the inhibitory ability of the peptide,A peptide is the activity of ToxR-GPA in the presence of peptide, A max is the maximal activity of ToxR-GPA without peptide, andA baseline is the baseline activity of the monomer A16 plasmid (2Langosch D. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). IC50 was calculated by fitting normalized data to the Langmuir equation (Equation 3) in Origin 6.0 (MicroCal, Inc., Northampton, MA; Ref. 27Eckert D.M. Malashkevich V.N. Hong L.H. Carr P.A. Kim P.S. Cell. 1999; 99: 103-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), AA+B⇔A+ABEquation 2 I=k×IC50[B]+IC50Equation 3 where A represents ToxR-GPA transcription factor, B represents the exogenous peptide, I represents inhibition of β-galactosidase activity (1-activity) and K is a scaling constant. The fluorescence of NBD is sensitive to its environment (28Rajarathnam K. Hochman J. Schindler M. Ferguson-Miller S. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3168-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The fluorescence quantum yield is low in solution and high in the membrane-bound state. The degree of peptide association with PE/PG (7:3) SUVs was measured by adding increasing amounts of vesicles to 0.1 µm NBD-labeled peptides dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). The fluorescence intensity was measured as a function of the lipid/peptide molar ratio, with excitation set at 467 nm (8-nm slit) and emission set at 530 nm (8-nm slit). The fluorescence values [f] were corrected by subtracting the corresponding blank (Me2SO with the same amount of vesicles) [f-f0], were f0represents fluorescence intensity in the absence of SUV. The partition coefficient was determined by nonlinear least-squares (NLLSQ) fitting using Equations 4 and 5, f=fboundfmax+(1−fbound)f0Equation 4 fbound=KpL/(W+KpL)Equation 5 where f bound is the relative fluorescence of the peptide-bound fraction, f max is the fluorescence at full binding, W is the water concentration (55.56m) and L is the lipid concentration in molar units. NLLSQ analyses and data simulations were performed with the commercial software package Origin 6.0. Changes in the fluorescence of NBD-labeled peptides were measured upon their binding to vesicles. NBD-labeled peptide (0.1 µm) was added to 0.4 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, containing PE/PG (7:3) SUV (200 µm). Emission spectra were recorded (8-nm slit), with excitation set at 467 nm (8-nm slit), and compared with the emission spectra of the NBD-labeled peptide in liposome-free PBS. The peptide/lipid molar ratio was kept at a level such that the majority of the peptides were bound to the vesicles and the contribution of the free peptide to fluorescence could be neglected. A series of five peptides corresponding to the transmembrane domain of GPA were synthesized (Table I) using t-boc strategies. To overcome solubility problems and to deliver the hydrophobic transmembrane segments into the bacterial membrane, a host sequence of two consecutive lysines was used (29Han X. Tamm L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13097-13102Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These peptides were tested for their ability to inhibit the formation of a ToxR-GPA transcription activator complex in the inner membrane ofE. coli as described in the model depicted in Fig.1 (2Langosch D. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Briefly, the ToxR-GPA is a transcription factor that activates a lacZ reporter gene as a consequence of dimerization. The dimerization is solely through the transmembrane segment, namely the GPA transmembrane segment (13 amino acids long) (2Langosch D. Brosig B. Kolmar H. Fritz H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Hetero-association of an exogenous peptide with the ToxR-GPA transcription factor will result in a decrease in the lacZ signal.Table IPeptide designations, sequences, and biophysical propertiesPeptideSequenceK p ×104m−1ΔGkcal/moleIC50 µm[WT]GPAKKITLIIFGVMAGVIGT15.0 ± 4.0−8.602.18 ± 0.01[A]GPAKKITLI AA GVAAGVAA T3.9 ± 0.5−7.916.68 ± 0.45[A2]GPAKKITAGAA GVAAGVAAA3.6 ± 2.5−7.87>95 ± 12.0[SC]GPAKGLIMIKVITGGITFVA19.6 ± 8.0−8.79>200[G]GPAKKITL GGFGVGAG GIGT23.0 ± 4.0−8.88>200Mutations in GPA sequences are underlined.

Letters in bold correspond to the known “Extended Homo-oligomerization Motif.”K p is the partition coefficient and ΔG is the free energy of binding. IC50 was calculated assuming a simple heterodimerization model (Equations 2 and 3). ToxR-GPA transcription levels were monitored in the presence of the different exogenous GPA analogs. The [WT]GPA and alanine mutant ([A]GPA) were able to interfere with the proper dimerization of ToxR-GPA, thereby inhibiting reporter gene transcription (Fig.2). Conversely, glycine ([G]GPA), scrambled ([SC]GPA), and [A2]GPA analogs were virtually inactive. In the [A2]GPA peptide, we used the [A]GPA mutant as a backbone, and introduced alanine and glycine mutations. These mutations eliminated the entire “extended motif” and left only the GXXXG motif. Using a simple equilibrium model (Equations 2 and 3), we performed non-linear fitting of our results and found the IC50 of [WT]GPA and [A]GPA to be 2.18 and 6.68 µm,respectively (Table I). A more complex equilibrium is possible, although it is unlikely because the transcription activator homodimer demands a spatial proximity of the two transcription domains for its activity. For example, inhibition of the dimer through complexes such as heterotrimerization with the peptide is probably not sufficient to prevent the cytoplasmic domains from dimerization (Fig. 1). To eliminate the possibility that the inactivity of [SC]GPA, [G]GPA and [A2]GPA were because of poor membrane binding, we compared peptide affinity to bacterial-mimetic membranes (PE/PG 7:3) (26Hetru C. Letellier L. Oren Z. Hoffmann J.A. Shai Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 30Ladokhin A.S. Jayasinghe S. White S.H. Anal.

J. 1999; 341: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). We found the inactive peptides ([SC]GPA, [G]GPA) and the active [WT]GPA to have similar membrane partitions; both being higher than the membrane partition of the active [A]GPA and inactive [A2]GPA (Fig.3 A). The free energy of binding and partition coefficient of all the peptides is within the range reported for known membrane binding peptides (25Gerber D. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23602-23607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 29Han X. Tamm L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

White S.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4432-4442Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) (Table I). Membrane insertion was investigated through the spectral analysis of the NBD moiety. The GPA analogs were labeled with the NBD fluorescent probe. NBD is highly sensitive to the polarity of the environment (26Hetru C. Letellier L. Oren Z. Hoffmann J.A. Shai Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 31Oren Z. Lerman J.C. Gudmundsson G.H. Agerberth B. Shai Y. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), thus a transfer into a hydrophobic environment will result in a blue shift concomitant with an increase in intensity. Blue shift analysis of GPA NBD-labeled fluorescent analogues revealed similar results for all peptides. Furthermore, the 10–12 nm blue shift observed is consistent with the localization of the N termini of the peptide in the hydrophobic membrane milieu (Fig. 3 B) (31Oren Z. Lerman J.C. Gudmundsson G.H. Agerberth B. Shai Y. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 34Frey S. Tamm L.K. Biochem.

Danin M. Gazit E. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8868-8875Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This study sets a precedent for the detection of direct in vivo-specific hetero-oligomerization. We found that the homo-oligomerization motif (GXXXG) (19Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar) is not enough for hetero-association within bacterial membranes, although an extended motif (LIXXGXXXGXXXT) (19Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 21Brosig B. Langosch D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1052-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) is essential for hetero-association. In fact, [A]GPA retains wild type oligomerization capability despite multiple alanine mutations, suggesting that the extended motif alone is enough for hetero-association. Moreover, when comparing the partition coefficients of the [WT]GPA to that of [A]GPA one can see that [A]GPA has about four times weaker binding, and consequently the IC50is around three times higher (Table I). This indicates that the specificity of [A]GPA is very similar to that of [WT]GPA. In contrast, the [A2]GPA peptide, containing only a GXXXG motif, had very low affinity toward the wild type transmembrane domain. This implies a crucial role for the extended homo-oligomerization motif. Moreover, the [G]GPA peptide, having mutations in the extended homo-oligomerization motif, completely loses its affinity to the wild-type transmembrane domain without a reduction in its membrane binding affinity. A possible explanation for the loss of hetero-assembly is that the glycine mutations interfere with the helical packing. Statistical analysis has previously shown that β-branched amino acids in positions I and I + 4 are favorable for packing two transmembrane domains, especially when next to the GXXXG motif (19Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 22Senes A. Gerstein M. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 921-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Mutating two such pairs may have lowered the packing energy of the oligomer. It is worth noting that GXXXG is the most common motif found in oligomeric transmembrane domains (19Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 22Senes A. Gerstein M. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 921-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). By creating a second GXXXG motif in [G]GPA, situated on a different helical face than the original, we allowed further freedom. However, this motif did not contribute to oligomerization. The comparison of the extended motif on the [A]GPA peptide with the GXXXG motif on the [A2]GPA peptide further confirms the importance of the extended motif for hetero-oligomerization. Polarity is the major characteristic implicated in determining the specificity of membrane interactions (37Zhou F.X. Cocco M.J. Russ W.P. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Additionally, hydrophobic amino acids and especially β-branched amino acid pairs are also characteristic of transmembrane segments. The β-branched amino acid pairs were previously suggested to be structurally important for helical packing (19Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 911-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 22Senes A. Gerstein M. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 921-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). We have challenged these characteristics by introducing multiple alanine mutations in hydrophobic and β-branched positions, leaving the polar amino acids alone. It is logical to assume that these drastic structural changes are bound to interfere with the helical packing. Still, the specificity of [A]GPA remains similar to that of the wild type, suggesting that in this case the polar interactions play a larger role than the structure and helical packing. In contrast, [G]GPA lost its ability to hetero-associate with the wild type transmembrane domain, despite the presence of the polar amino acids, supporting the notion that hydrophobic interactions are sufficient for assembly. Other hints to this end can be found in the literature where all-hydrophobic transmembrane segments were shown to specifically interact with each other in a biological membrane (38Laage R. Rohde J. Brosig B. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17481-17487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Protein-protein recognition and cross-talk in the membrane remains a largely uncharted field. Nevertheless, structural data of membrane proteins is scarce (39Bowie J.U. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 435-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The method presented herein can directly detect the interaction between two different transmembrane domains provided that one of the helices can also homo-oligomerize. Thus, this method can advance structural and functional research of a broad range of such membrane proteins. In the case of the T cell receptor, for example, exogenous addition of a peptide corresponding to the transmembrane segment is known to modulate the activity of the receptor (40Manolios N. Collier S. Taylor J. Pollard J. Harrison L.C. Bender V. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Our method can clarify whether this is due to direct displacement of the corresponding helix from the receptor complex. Characterization of the mechanism by which the transmembrane domain affects receptor activity is highly important both in terms of the basic understanding of receptor mechanics and from a therapeutic perspective. Our results indicate that interfering with hetero-oligomerization within the membrane can be a useful strategy to characterize such interactions, as well as to modulate membrane protein activity.

Because some properties of native GPCRs are disadvantageous for ectopic therapeutic expression, we utilized the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) as a scaffold to construct a highly modified therapeutic receptor-effector complex (TREC) suitable for gene therapy. Altogether, 19 modifications were made to the receptor. The ligand-binding site was re-engineered in TM-3 so that a β-hydroxylmethyl side chain acts as a proton donor for the binding of a novel ligand. In addition, sites critical for agonist-promoted down-regulation in the amino terminus and for phosphorylation by GPCR kinases, and protein kinases A and C, in the third intracellular loop and the carboxyl terminus of the receptor were altered. These modifications of the receptor resulted in depressed agonist-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity (26.8 ± 2.1 versus 41.4 ± 8 pmol/min/mg for wild-type β2AR). This was fully restored by fusing the carboxyl terminus of the modified receptor to Gαs (43.3 ± 2.7 pmol/min/mg). The fully modified fused receptor was not activated by β-agonists but rather by a nonbiogenic amine agonist that itself failed to activate the wild-type β2AR. This two-way selectivity thus provides targeted activation based on physiologic status. Furthermore, the TREC did not display tachyphylaxis to prolonged agonist exposure (desensitization was 1 ± 5%versus 55 ± 4% for wild-type β2AR). Thus, despite extensive alterations in regions of conformational lability, the β2AR can be tailored to have optimal signaling characteristics for gene therapy. As a general paradigm, TRECs for enhancement of other G-protein signaling appear to be feasible for modification of other pathologic states.

G-protein-coupled receptors are widely expressed and serve diverse functions within hormonal, neurotransmission, immune, and growth systems. Receptor signaling in this family is dynamically regulated such that the cell integrates a large number of incoming signals and ultimately adapts to short and long term events. Although such regulation can occur at the level of G proteins or subsequent downstream participants in the pathway, highly specific mechanisms acting at the receptor itself are the primary mechanisms by which the signal transduction of a given receptor is selectively modulated (1Liggett S.B. Lefkowitz R.J. Sibley D. Houslay M. Regulation of Cellular Signal Transduction Pathways by Desensitization and Amplification. John Wiley & Sons, London1993: 71-97Google Scholar,2Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Both the β1-adrenergic receptor and β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR)1subtypes couple to the stimulatory guanine nucleotide binding protein Gs, resulting in activation of adenylyl cyclase and increased intracellular cAMP. Rapid regulation of βAR coupling efficiency (1Liggett S.B. Lefkowitz R.J. Sibley D. Houslay M. Regulation of Cellular Signal Transduction Pathways by Desensitization and Amplification. John Wiley & Sons, London1993: 71-97Google Scholar) is mediated by phosphorylation of the receptor by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), as well as protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC). GRK-mediated desensitization is evoked by agonist occupancy, whereas PKA- and PKC-mediated phosphorylation are mechanisms of heterologous desensitization. Receptor-mediated responsiveness is also dependent on cell surface βAR expression, which is regulated by complex sorting and trafficking mechanisms involving internalization, recycling, and degradation of receptors, as well as transcriptional mechanisms (3Hadcock J.R. Wang H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4740-4746PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hosoda K. Fitzgerald L.R. Vaidya V.A. Feussner G.K. Fishman P.H. Duman R.S. Mol.

Although regulation of βAR function serves important roles in maintenance of homeostasis under normal and compensatory states, in certain pathologic conditions depressed function appears to contribute to the disease state or may limit the therapeutic response to agonist (6Grove A. Lipworth B.J. Br. J. Clin. Pharmac. 1995; 39: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For example, in the lung airway smooth muscle β2AR act to relax the muscle resulting in bronchodilation (7Green S.A. Liggett S.B. Liggett S. Meyers D. The Genetics of Asthma. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1996: 67-90Google Scholar). β2AR on airway epithelial cells also contribute to the establishment of bronchomotor tone (7Green S.A. Liggett S.B. Liggett S. Meyers D.

In asthma, a disease characterized by bronchial smooth muscle contraction, airway epithelial and smooth muscle β2AR function is depressed, thus contributing to airway obstruction (7Green S.A.

Furthermore, regular use of β-agonists in the treatment of bronchospasm acts to desensitize β2AR (termed tachyphylaxis), thus potentially worsening obstruction and limiting the effectiveness of this therapy (10Grove A.

Mechanisms of such dysfunction include down-regulation of receptor number, phosphorylation of receptors by the βAR kinase (βARK) and PKC, and changes in downstream elements of the signal transduction cascade such as G proteins and adenylyl cyclase (14Brodde O.E.

Overexpression of β2AR or inhibition of βARK has been shown to markedly improve organ function in animal models of asthma and/or heart failure. For example, we have recently shown that transgenic overexpression of β2AR in airway smooth muscle results in mice that are resistant to methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction (20McGraw D.W.

The above studies indicate the potential for gene therapy via expression of the β2AR in the lung and heart. The wild-type receptor, however, has a number of properties that may limit the effectiveness of this approach, particularly with lower levels of expression, as is likely in human therapy. Thus, under pathologic conditions where βARK activity is increased, phosphorylation and desensitization of the genetically expressed β2AR may ultimately limit therapeutic efficacy. Similarly, PKA or PKC activation in the cell, because of homologous or heterologous mechanisms, could alter receptor function. Also, agonist-promoted receptor down-regulation, which is partially due to degradation of receptor protein (5Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar), could decrease the available number of cell surface receptors after initial successful expression. In addition, certain conformational and spatial properties of the receptor-Gsinterface limit the efficiency of functional coupling of the wild-type β2AR (32Seifert R. Wenzel-Seifert K. Kobilka B.K. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 383-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Finally, a therapeutically expressed wild-type β2AR is activated by the same endogenous catecholamines and synthetic agonists as is the endogenously expressed β2AR. Thus, under these circumstances there is no mechanism to selectively activate or deactivate the genetically expressed receptor as may be dictated by the clinical status. We have considered, however, that the β2AR can be utilized as a scaffold upon which to construct a synthetic G-protein-coupled receptor with specific properties to optimize gene therapy. It is not clear, however, whether such a highly modified receptor can maintain functional integrity, because multiple mutations throughout the protein would need to be introduced in known areas of conformational lability. In the current work, we utilize the human β2AR in the above fashion to create a protein with markedly different properties from an adrenergic receptor and with characteristics suitable for gene therapy. As a general paradigm the creation of such designer receptors is likely to be amendable for enhancement of other G-protein signaling for the modification of other pathologic states. The human wild-type β2AR cDNA cloned into the expression vector pBCBI was used as a template for mutagenesis. From this, an 1862-base pairSacI/SalI fragment encompassing the entire wild-type β2AR coding region was isolated and subcloned into M13mp19 for oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (33Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 82: 488-492Crossref Scopus (4894) Google Scholar). Sequence encoding the HA epitope tag (MGYPYDVPDYAS) was incorporated at the amino terminus of the receptor for all subsequent constructs. Amino acid 27 was changed from Gln to Glu, and amino acid 113 was changed from Asp to Ser, to make the receptor refractory to agonist-promoted down-regulation and to alter the ligand binding specificity, respectively. In addition, potential PKA/PKC phosphorylation sites at amino acids 272, 273, 356, and 357 were changed to Ala. Similarly, potential GRK phosphorylation sites at amino acids 366, 367, 371, 375, 395, 404, 407, 412, 418, 419, and 422 were changed to Ala. Another modification included the mutation of the stop codon to alanine and an in-frame ligation at the NcoI site immediately preceding the initiator methionine codon of the entire open reading frame of the rat Gαs cDNA (long form). Chinese hamster fibroblasts (CHW-1102) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin. The cells were transiently transfected with a concomitant infection of a “helper” adenovirus using methods as described (34Forsayeth J.R. Garcia P.D. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 354-356PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 7 × 106 cells were plated in a T-75 flask ∼16 h prior to transfection. The cells were washed twice with Hank's balanced salt solution and incubated in 0.5 ml of a transfection/infection mixture containing 1 × 1010 plaque-forming unit purified E1A-deleted adenovirus, 2% fetal calf serum, 80 µg/ml DEAE-dextran, and 15 µg of plasmid DNA in the aforementioned expression vectors, at 37 °C and 5% CO2 with gentle rocking. After 2 h, the solution was aspirated, and the cells were incubated with 10% Me2SO in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2 min. After a final wash, the cells were incubated in complete medium for 48 h prior to analysis. For long term desensitization studies, the cells were incubated for 24 h in the presence of 10 µm albuterol or 100 µm of the catechol butanone compound L-158,870 (Merck). The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, detached with a rubber policeman in 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mmEDTA buffer, and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 10 min. To determine receptor density, membrane pellets were resuspended in 75 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, and radioligand binding with125I-cyanopindolol was performed for cells expressing the wild-type β2AR as described previously (35Small K.M. Forbes S.L. Rahman F.F. Liggett S.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2815-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To determine adenylyl cyclase activities, the membranes were incubated with 30 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm EDTA, 120 µm ATP, 60 µm GTP, 2.8 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 50 µg/ml myokinase, 100 µm cAMP, and 1 µCi of [α-32P]ATP for 30 min as described (35Small K.M. Forbes S.L. Rahman F.F. Liggett S.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2815-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The reactions were carried out with water, 100 µm forskolin, 10 µm epinephrine, 100 µm norepinephrine, and varying concentrations of albuterol or L-158,870. [32P]cAMP was separated from α-32P by chromatography over alumina columns. A [3H]cAMP standard included in the stop buffer accounted for individual column recovery. The Western blots were carried out using immunoprecipitated protein essentially as described (35Small K.M. Forbes S.L. Rahman F.F. Liggett S.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2815-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were lysed in buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors (10 µg/ml benzamidine, 10 µg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, and 5 µg/ml leupeptin) in phosphate-buffered saline. Equal amounts of solubilized protein were preincubated with protein G-agarose beads to remove nonspecific binding for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein G-agarose beads and 1 µg/ml of rat anti-HA antibody (Roche) for 18 h at 4 °C. Following immunoprecipitation, the beads were washed three times by centrifugation and resuspension and boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer. The proteins in the supernatant were fractionated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blots were performed using a mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Babco) at a dilution of 1:200. Protein determination was by the copper bicinchoninic acid method. The results are presented as the means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were made by paired two-wayt tests with significance imparted for p < 0.05. The response curves were generated using Prism 3.0 software (GraphPad). Shown in Fig. 1are the modifications imposed on the β2AR. To facilitate identification by immunoblotting, all receptors were fused at the amino terminus with the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag. The combined effect of mutations that remove sites required for down-regulation and phosphorylation was considered to be unlikely to alter ligand binding, so these were imposed collectively in the initial round of mutagenesis. Ultimately, two modified receptors and the wild-type β2AR were studied. One receptor contained the single mutations introduced to change amino acids at the indicated positions to alter the ligand-binding site, receptor down-regulation and receptor phosphorylation as further described below. This receptor is denoted as the “modified receptor,” A second receptor contained these mutations in addition to being fused to Gαs and is denoted as the therapeutic receptor-effector complex (TREC). Receptors were transiently expressed in CHW-1102 cells, and expression was verified by 125I-cyanopindolol binding (∼400 fmol/mg) or Western blots. The agonist-binding site was re-engineered to satisfy several criteria. First, we wanted to render the receptor unresponsive to endogenous catecholamines and other synthetic β-agonists. In addition, we aimed to have the mutated receptor respond to a unique agonist. Finally, we preferred that this unique agonist not activate wild-type β2AR. The key interactions (36Strader C.D.

At Asp113, it has been proposed that the binding of agonists (and antagonists) involves the formation of an ion pair between the amine group of the ligand and the Asp carboxylate side chain. This interaction can apparently be brought about in mutant forms of the receptor by using different classes of ligands (39Strader C.D. Gaffney T. Sugg E.E. Candelore M.R. Keys R. Patchett A.A. Dixon R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We thus mutated Asp113 to Ser, which substitutes the β-carboxymethyl side chain with a β-hydroxylmethyl group. This renders the receptor incapable of activation by biogenic amines. However, compounds that otherwise satisfy requirements for β2AR binding and are capable of accepting hydrogen bonds from the engineered Ser in transmembrane domain III, would activate the receptor. Based on work by Straderet al. (39Strader C.D. Gaffney T. Sugg E.E. Candelore M.R. Keys R. Patchett A.A. Dixon R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we chose 1-(3′,4′-dihydroxyphenyl)-3-methyl-1-butanone as the agonist specific for the modified β2AR. This compound, also known as L-158,870, retains the catechol ring but instead of the amine containing alkyl-side chain has a four carbon length moiety, keto-substituted at the α-carbon. The functional results of the Asp to Ser substitution are shown in Fig. 2. Because the therapeutic β-agonists commonly utilized clinically are partial agonists, we used albuterol as the benchmark agonist. As shown in Fig. 2 A, albuterol stimulated adenylyl cyclase by the Asp113 (the wild-type allele) receptor ∼50% over basal levels, whereas there was no stimulation by albuterol of the modified mutant (including Ser113) receptor. In contrast, L-158,870 stimulated adenylyl cyclase by the modified receptor ∼70% above basal but did not activate wild-type β2AR (TableI). In additional studies with the modified receptor, neither norepinephrine nor epinephrine stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities over basal levels (5 ± 10% and 10 ± 10%, respectively; n = 6; p> 0.05 versus basal levels).Table IAdenylyl cyclase activities of WTβ2AR and modified receptorsReceptorBasalAlbuterolL-158,870EC50MaxIncreaseMaxIncreasepmol/min/mgpmol/min/mg%pmol/min/mg%µmWild-type β2AR27.8 ± 2.6041.4 ± 7.2850 ± 2.518.7 ± 2.530.39 ± 0.10 (albuterol)Modified receptor16.6 ± 1.3517.8 ± 1.3226.8 ± 2.0670 ± 1011 ± 3.7 (L-158,870)TREC23.2 ± 1.7129.3 ± 2.4743.3 ± 2.7190 ± 207.4 ± 2.9 (L-158,870) Open table in a new tab One consequence that we observed with the Ser substitution at position 113 of the third transmembrane domain was a decrease in basal adenylyl cyclase activities compared with the wild-type β2AR (16.6 ± 1.3 versus 27.8 ± 2.6 pmol/min/mg). So, whereas the two agonists stimulated their respective receptors to the same fold extent over basal, the absolute levels of maximal stimulation of the Ser113 modified β2AR was nonetheless depressed (Fig. 2 B). This effect on basal coupling is likely due to conformational effects on the intracellular coupling domains that are imposed by this substitution in transmembrane domain III. Of note, Asp in this position is invariant in all biogenic amine-liganded G-protein-coupled receptors. To attempt to overcome this therapeutically disadvantageous characteristic, the intracellular carboxyl terminus of the modified receptor was fused to the amino terminus of the α-subunit of Gs. At least with wild-type β2AR, such a fusion has been reported to increase basal (non-agonist-stimulated) levels of adenylyl cyclase activity (35Small K.M. Forbes S.L. Rahman F.F. Liggett S.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2815-2821Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Because the Ser substitution at residue 113 ablated125I-cyanopindolol binding, immunoblotting using HA antibody was used for verification of the expression of the fused receptor. As shown in Fig. 3, the wild-type β2AR migrated at a molecular mass of ∼60 kDa, with an additional band representing more highly glycosylated states observed between 80 and 100 kDa. The TREC migrated at molecular masses consistent with the addition of the 42 kDa Gαs protein, with a band at ∼100 kDa and another broad band representing the highly glycosylated states at ≥120 kDa. The results from adenylyl cyclase studies of the TREC are shown in Fig.4. The fusion with Gαsindeed increased basal levels from 16.2 ± 1.3 to 23.1 ± 1.9 pmol/min/mg. Agonist stimulation was preserved and in fact increased from ∼70% over basal in the absence of Gαs to ∼90% over basal with the fusion. With these changes, maximal adenylyl cyclase activities were equivalent between wild-type β2AR and the fully modified fused receptor in the basal state and with the respective agonist activation (Table I). We next considered the effects of modifications imposed to limit receptor desensitization. These mutations included substitution of all Ser and Thr in the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor with Ala. A similar mutant β2AR, which consisted of Gly and Ala substitutions for Ser and Thr, has been shown to lack sites for GRK (βARK)-mediated phosphorylation (40Hausdorff W.P. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. Irons G.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12657-12665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are two potential PKA/PKC sites (Arg-Arg-Ser-Ser*) at amino acid positions 273 and 357 that were changed to Ala. Because the Ser immediately adjacent to the second Arg could also serve as a phosphoacceptor, these were mutated to Ala as well. Because long term agonist exposure evokes desensitization via these phosphorylation events as well as down-regulation of receptor number, we also sought to render the receptor resistant to down-regulation. We thus substituted Glu for Gln at amino acid position 27 of the amino terminus (which is a naturally occurring polymorphism in the human gene), which we have previously shown to result in a functional receptor that fails to undergo agonist-promoted destabilization and subsequent degradation (41Green S. Turki J. Innis M. Liggett S.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9414-9419Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Thus, to test whether the above modifications in fact limit desensitization, cells in culture expressing the wild-type β2AR or the TREC were incubated with equipotent concentrations of albuterol (10 µm) or L-158,870 (100 µm) for 24 h. This exposure provides the ultimate verification of a functional knockout of desensitization from all the above mechanisms and also mimics the in vivosetting of repetitive dosing over prolonged periods of time. The cells were then placed on ice and washed, membranes were prepared, and agonist-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities were determined. The results of such studies are shown in Fig.5.

https://openalex.org/W2023138011,"Myc overexpression is a hallmark of human cancer and promotes transformation by facilitating immortalization. This function has been linked to the ability of c-Myc to induce the expression of the catalytic subunit of telomerase, telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), as ectopic expression of TERT immortalizes some primary human cell types. c-Myc up-regulates telomerase activity in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and myeloid cells. Paradoxically, Myc overexpression also triggers the ARF-p53 apoptotic program, which is activated when MEFs undergo replicative crises following culture ex vivo. The rare immortal variants that arise from these cultures generally suffer mutations in p53 or deleteInk4a/ARF, and Myc greatly increases the frequency of these events. Alternative reading frame (ARF)- and p53-null MEFs have increased telomerase activity, as do variant immortal clones that bypass replicative crisis. Similarly, immortal murine NIH-3T3 fibroblasts and myeloid 32D.3 and FDC-P1.2 cells do not express ARF and have robust telomerase activity. However, Myc overexpression in these immortal cells results in remarkably discordant regulation of TERT and telomerase activity. Furthermore, in MEFs and 32D.3 cells TERT expression and telomerase activity are regulated independently of endogenous c-Myc. Thus, the regulation of TERT and telomerase activity is complex and is also regulated by factors other than Myc, ARF, or p53."

Hurwitz J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2671-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and MOF is a histone acetylase (8Smith E.R. Pannuti A. Gu W. Steurnagel A. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. Lucchesi J.C. Mol.

Johansen K.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1005-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), but it is not known if this protein is essential for dosage compensation. The complex only assembles in males as one of the components, MSL2, is not present in females (10Kelley R.L. Solovyeva I. Lyman L.M. Richman R. Solovyev V. Kuroda M.I. Cell. 1995; 81: 867-877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 11Bashaw G.J. Baker B.S. Development. 1995; 121: 3245-3258PubMed Google Scholar, 12Zhou S. Yang Y. Scott M.J.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2884-2895Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).The complex is initially targeted to the male X chromosome through binding to 30–40 “high affinity” or “chromatin entry” sites (13Lyman L.M. Copps K. Rastelli L. Kelley R.L. Kuroda M.I. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1743-1753PubMed Google Scholar). The complex is then thought to spread from these sites to other sites on the X chromosome (2Stuckenholz C. Kageyama Y. Kuroda M.I. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 454-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Two of these sites are the X-linkedroX1 and roX2 genes (14Kelley R.L. Meller V.H. Gordadze P.R. Roman G. Davis R.L. Kuroda M.I. Cell. 1999; 98: 513-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). That is, the same genes that encode the RNA components of the complex also appear to contain DNA sequences that are recognized by the complex.It has recently been shown that a 217-bp DNA fragment ofroX1 is sufficient to produce an ectopic chromatin entry site when inserted on an autosome (15Kageyama Y. Mengus G. Gilfillan G. Kennedy H.G. Stuckenholz C. Kelley R.L. Becker P.B. Kuroda M.I. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2236-2245Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).Previously, we developed an insulated reporter gene system to search for cis-acting X-linked DNA sequences that are required for dosage compensation (16Fitzsimons H.L. Henry R.A. Scott M.J. Genetica. 1999; 105: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The system consists of the constitutivearmadillo promoter driving expression of the lacZreporter gene and flanked by SCS and SCS′ insulator elements. Seven X-linked DNA fragments totaling 63 kb were tested with the system, but none were found to contain DNA sequences that caused elevated expression of the reporter in males. Here we report that insertion of either roX1 or roX2 DNA sequences upstream of the armadillo promoter results in elevated expression of the lacZ reporter gene in maleDrosophila.DISCUSSIONThere are several lines of evidence that have shown that the MSL complex binds to hundreds of sites along the male X chromosome and causes a 2-fold increase in expression of most X-linked genes in maleDrosophila (1Lucchesi J.C. Manning J.E. Adv. Genet. 1987; 24: 371-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 2Stuckenholz C. Kageyama Y. Kuroda M.I. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 454-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The most direct evidence for the latter is that males that are homozygous for mutant alleles ofmsl1, msl2, or mle have significantly reduced levels of X-linked but not autosomal enzymes and mlemales have a lower overall rate of X-chromosome transcription (22Belote J.M. Lucchesi J.C. Nature. 1980; 285: 573-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In this study we have shown that binding of the MSL complex to eitherroX1 or roX2 DNA sequences integrated at autosomal sites correlates with an elevated expression of an adjacentlacZ reporter gene. Indeed, in some of the lines that had either roX1 or roX2 cDNA inserted upstream oflacZ we observed full compensation, that is a doubling of expression in males compared with females carrying the same number of copies of the construct. However, in all of the lines carryingroX1 genomic fragments, a line with a roX2genomic fragment, and some of the lines with roX cDNA upstream of lacZ we observed partial compensation. That is the male/female ratios were significantly greater than one but less than the 2-fold expected if recruitment of the MSL complex leads to a precise doubling of transcription as occurs on the X chromosome. We considered that this partial compensation might be because the MSL complex is only binding to the autosomal roX sequence in a fraction of the cells in a tissue. However, we found that the proportion of nuclei that showed binding to the roX1 BS construct, which shows partial compensation, was the same as compared with a line that showed full compensation (3.7 cDNA line 2). Thus it appears that partial compensation cannot be explained by variability in MSL binding between cells within a tissue. However, we have only analyzed cells from one tissue, third instar larvae salivary glands. We also considered the possibility that one roX sequence might not be sufficient in some autosomal locations to recruit enough MSL complexes to achieve full compensation. If so, a construct that had both roX1 and roX2 cDNAs inserted upstream oflacZ may be more effective at recruiting the complex and would thus show full compensation in most lines. However, the lines tested both showed partial compensation. Thus there must be some other explanation for why some lines show only partial compensation. We think the most likely explanation is that the local chromatin environment at the autosomal integration site influences the level of hyperactivation of the lacZ reporter by the MSL complex. It's known that some autosomal sites are much more permissive to spreading of the complex than others, indicating that the local autosomal chromatin environment can affect at least one function of the MSL complex.We found that lines that were homozygous for the roX1 4.9 genomic-arm-lacZ construct gave significantly lower male/female ratios of β-galactosidase activity than lines that were either heterozygous or homozygous for the roX1 3.7 cDNA-arm-lacZ construct. Because both constructs contain a binding site for the MSL complex, it's not obvious why theroX1 genomic construct should give lower hyperactivation oflacZ in males. One possibility is that this is simply because by chance in all the roX1 genomic lines the transgene integrated into a negative chromosomal environment that was not permissive to full hyperactivation of lacZ in males. However, this would seem unlikely, because all three lines gave similar male/female ratios of β-galactosidase. The genomic construct contains additional DNA sequences from the roX1 gene region compared with the cDNA construct. It's possible that these additional sequences may somehow inhibit hyperactivation of lacZ by the MSL complex. The genomic construct would be expected to produceroX1 RNA, whereas the promoter-less cDNA construct would not. The function of the roX1 RNA in the complex is not known. If the RNA has an inhibitory role, then a localized excess of synthesis of roX1 RNA might result in assembly of an MSL complex that is less effective at elevating expression of the adjacent reporter gene. It has been suggested that in vivo there must be some mechanism for dampening the transcription elevation due to the MOF histone acetylase, because in vitro recombinant MOF is able to increase expression from a nucleosomal template far more than 2-fold (23Akhtar A. Becker P.B. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 367-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Clearly, further experiments with additional constructs are required to determine the biological significance (if any) of the difference in lacZ hyperactivation between roX1genomic and cDNA constructs.The level of elevation of β-galactosidase activity in males carrying the 419-bp fragment of roX1 that contains the MSL binding site was significantly less than obtained with 3.7-kb roX1cDNA. It's possible that by chance all three roX1 BS lines are inserted into negative chromatin environments that inhibit the MSL complex. We think this is unlikely, because all three lines gave very similar male/female ratios of β-galactosidase activity. Rather it is more likely that binding of the MSL complex to the site inroX1 BS is not sufficient to achieve full compensation. This suggests that other sequences in roX1 3.7 cDNA in addition to the MSL binding site in roX1 BS are required for full roX1 function.In Drosophila, the SCS and SCS′ insulator elements are able to protect a gene from position effects and block a transcription enhancer from acting on a promoter (24Kellum R. Schedl P. Cell. 1991; 64: 941-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 25Kellum R. Schedl P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2424-2431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been previously shown that the SCS and SCS′ elements do not block genes from being dosage compensated when inserted onto the X chromosome (16Fitzsimons H.L. Henry R.A. Scott M.J. Genetica. 1999; 105: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 24Kellum R. Schedl P. Cell. 1991; 64: 941-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). This suggests that these insulators cannot prevent hypertranscription in males due to the MSL complex. In this study we have tested this directly by placing an SCS′ insulator between a roX2sequence, which contains an MSL binding site, and thelacZ reporter. The SCS′ insulator was unable to block elevation of expression of the reporter in males. Because this insulator can block transcription enhancers, this suggests that the mechanism by which the MSL complex affects transcription may be different from how an enhancer acts on a promoter. In the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster, males have one X chromosome and females have two. Males dosage compensate by doubling the transcription of most X-linked genes (1Lucchesi J.C. Manning J.E. Adv. Genet. 1987; 24: 371-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The MSL1 complex is required for this male-specific hypertranscription (2Stuckenholz C. Kageyama Y. Kuroda M.I.

The complex is comprised of at least five proteins, MSL1, MSL2, MSL3, MLE, and MOF and two non-coding RNAs, roX1 and roX2. All components of the complex co-localize to hundreds of sites along the male X chromosome (4Bone J.R. Lavender J. Richman R. Palmer M.J. Turner B.M. Kuroda M.I.

https://openalex.org/W2012057203,"Tetanus toxin is a fascinating, multifunctional protein that binds to peripheral neurons, undergoes retrograde transport and trans-synaptic transfer to central inhibitory neurons where it blocks transmitter release, thereby, causing spastic paralysis. As a pre-requisite for exploiting its unique trafficking properties, a novel recombinant single chain was expressed at a high level in Escherichia coli as a soluble, easily purifiable protein. It could be activated with enterokinase to produce a dichain that matched native toxin in terms of proteolytic and neuroinhibitory activities, as well as induction of spastic paralysis in mice. Importantly, nicking was not essential for protease activity.

This observation unveils differences between the intoxication processes resulting from retrograde transport of toxin in vivo and its local uptake into peripheral or central nerves in vitro, dispelling a popularly held belief that the heavy chain is the sole determinant for efficient trafficking. Thus, this innocuous mutant may be a useful vehicle, superior to the heavy chain, for drug delivery to central neurons. Tetanus toxin is a fascinating, multifunctional protein that binds to peripheral neurons, undergoes retrograde transport and trans-synaptic transfer to central inhibitory neurons where it blocks transmitter release, thereby, causing spastic paralysis. As a pre-requisite for exploiting its unique trafficking properties, a novel recombinant single chain was expressed at a high level in Escherichia coli as a soluble, easily purifiable protein.

An alternative entry route entails uptake into peripheral nerve endings followed by retrograde axonal transport to their cell body and trans-synaptic transfer to central neurons. Such fascinating trafficking routes are exploited efficiently by growth factors (1Stockel K. Schwab M. Thoenen H. Brain Res. 1975; 99: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), neurotrophic viruses (2Ugolini G. Loewy A.D. Kaplitt M.G. Viral Vectors: Gene Therapy and Neuroscience Applications.

Thus, insights could be gained into the fundamental processes of protein and membrane trafficking by investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for such movements, for example, of TeTx; also, novel means of preventing tetanus should emerge. TeTx, a protein from Clostridium tetani composed of a heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) linked by a disulfide and non-covalent bonds, causes spastic paralysis by targeted delivery to the spinal cord and lower brain where it blocks transmitter release from inhibitory nerve endings (5Wellhöner, H. H. (1992) in Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology (Herken, H., and Hucho, F., eds), Vol 102: Selective Neurotoxicity, pp. 357–417, Springer-Verlag, Berlin.Google Scholar). The HC is required for binding to ecto-acceptors on peripheral and central neurons (6Herreros J. Lalli G. Montecucco C. Schiavo G. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1941-1950Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 7Lalli G. Herreros J. Osborne S.L. Montecucco C. Rossetto O. Schiavo G. J.

Sci. 1986; 11: 314-317Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (333) Google Scholar), but functional antagonism of whole toxin by recombinant HC (9Li Y. Aoki R. Dolly J.O. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 1200-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) has not been demonstrated in vivo. The LC functions independently as a Zn2+-dependent protease and cleaves specifically synaptobrevin, a synaptic vesicle protein essential for Ca2+-elicited neurotransmitter release (10Link E. Edelmann L. Chou J.H. Binz T. Yamasaki S. Eisel U. Baumert M. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. Jahn R. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Nature. 1992; 359: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). Clearly, this toxin and its chains or derivatives can provide invaluable research tools for elucidating poorly understood intra- and inter-neuronal trafficking pathways/mechanisms. Moreover, TeTx has unique potential as a central nervous system delivery vehicle because of its proven ability to co-transport attached “cargo” such as complexed anti-toxin (12Habig W.H. Keinumer J.G. Hadegree M.C. Lui T.Y. Frontiers in Biochemical and Biophysical Studies of Proteins and Membranes. Elsevier, New York1983: 463-473Google Scholar) or conjugated enzymes (13Schwab M.E. Suda K. Thoenen H. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 82: 798-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Because TeTx is one of the most poisonous substances known, ablation of this toxicity is an essential pre-requisite for such exploitation; this can be achieved by mutagenesis of the protease active site in LC but requires subsequent reconstitution with HC, which gives a low yield of dichain (9Li Y. Aoki R. Dolly J.O. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 1200-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 14Li Y. Foran P. Fairweather N.F. de Paiva A. Weller U. Dougan G. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7014-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Due to its ease of preparation (15Bizzini B. Grob P. Akert K. Brain Res. 1981; 210: 291-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 16Coen L. Osta R. Maury M. Brulet P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9400-9405Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the C-terminal moiety of the HC, termed HC, has been employed to traffic enzymes into the central nervous system in vivo (15Bizzini B. Grob P. Akert K. Brain Res. 1981; 210: 291-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 16Coen L. Osta R. Maury M. Brulet P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9400-9405Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) but the transport efficiency was very poor (17Figueiredo D.M. Hallewell R.A. Chen L.L. Fairweather N.F. Dougan G. Savitt J.M. Parks D.A. Fishman P.S. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 145: 546-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 18Fishman P.S. Savitt J.M. Farrand D.A. J. Neurol. Sci. 1990; 98: 311-325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Possible reasons for this low efficacy of HC include: (i) reduced binding affinity for central neuronal membranes in vitro compared with HC or TeTx (19Weller U. Dauzenroth M.-E. Meyer zu Heringdorf D. Habermann E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 20Fishman P.S. Parks D.A. Patwardhan A.J. Matthews C.C. Nat. Toxins. 1999; 7: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar); (ii) its preferential or predominant interaction with non-productive acceptors on peripheral neurons that do not mediate optimal retrograde traffic; (iii) the absence of the contributions of the N-terminal half of the HC, as well as the inter-chain disulfide, to the internalization of TeTx that results in toxicity (21Schiavo G. Matteoli M. Montecucco C. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 717-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). In this context, it is notable that motor nerve terminals appear to possess two distinct pools of TeTx acceptor. In addition to the aforementioned productive acceptor that underlies retrograde trafficking leading to the spastic paralysis typical of tetanus, low affinity binding sites exist that apparently release the neurotoxin proximal to its synaptic site of internalization; hence, at high doses TeTx induces flaccid paralysis at neuromuscular junctions in vitro (22Simpson L.L. Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1986; 26: 427-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) andin vivo (23Matsuda M. Sugimoto N. Ozutsumi K. Hiria T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These various findings highlight that TeTx, devoid of toxicity, will provide the most effective vehicle for targeted delivery to the central nervous system, being functional at very low concentrations by targeting the high affinity acceptor, which enters the retrograde trafficking pathway and culminates in translocation of LC into the neuronal cytosol. Hence, a new strategy to achieve this goal is described herein. To circumvent the difficulties of preparing the individual chains of TeTx and achieving adequate reconstitution, TeTx was expressed as a single chain (SC) in Escherichia coli to yield a high level of correctly folded and soluble toxin, thereby, mimickingClostridium tetani. Attachment of a tag afforded complete purification while incorporation of an enterokinase (EK)-susceptible linker allowed controlled nicking to create the fully active, disulfide-linked dichain. A similarly created protease-inactive, non-toxic variant (TeTx E234A) protected mice from a TeTx challenge, unlike HC; on the other hand, both antagonized the toxin's neuroparalytic action in vitro. Hence, these strategies have provided a unique non-toxic TeTx for future use as a vaccine (24Figueiredo D. Turcotte C. Frankel G. Li Y. Dolly O. Wilkin G. Marriott D. Fairweather N. Dougan G. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 3218-3221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and an efficient transporter to the central nervous system, as well as for characterizing the functional acceptors and poorly understood but functionally important retrograde trafficking pathways. Moreover, the fully active wild-type will facilitate mutagenesis to delineate the individual roles of each of its multiple domains. Restriction endonucleases, DNA purification kits, and E. coli were from Promega. Talon resin and a site-directed mutagenesis kit were bought from CLONTECH and Stratagene, respectively. pTrcHisA vector and enterokinase were purchased from Invitrogen. A monoclonal antibody specific for the poly-histidine tag was obtained from Qiagen. Cell culture media, reagents, and glass beads were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Horse serum was supplied by Life Technologies, Inc. and primers by MWG-Biotech. Every construct had unique restriction sites inserted for the purpose of validation. The pTrcHisA vector was modified using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit by the insertion of two restriction sites (SalI (GTC GAC) and HindIII (AAG CTT)) into its multiple cloning site (MCS), ahead of the EK consensus sequence. This was achieved using two primers (a; 5′-G ACT GGT GGA CAG CAA GTC GAC CGG AAG CTT TAC GAC GAT GAC G-3′ and b, 5′-C GTC ATC GTC GTA AAG CTT CCG GTC GAC TTG CTG TCC ACC AGT C-3′). Because this insertion introduced a second HindIII site into the MCS, the originalHindIII site was replaced, by SmaI, using the same method except with another two primers (a, 5′-TAC CAT ATG GGA ATT CCC GGG TTG GCT GTT TTG GCG-3′; b, 5′-CGC CAA AAC AGC CAA CCC GGG AAT TCC CAT ATG GTA-3′). The modified pTrcHisA was confirmed by agarose electrophoresis after digestion with SalI,SmaI, or HindIII enzymes. The LC DNA of either wild-type (WT) or E234A mutant was isolated from the pMAL-LC and pMAL-E234A plasmids (14Li Y. Foran P. Fairweather N.F. de Paiva A. Weller U. Dougan G. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7014-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), respectively, by SalI and HindIII digestion and subcloned, separately, into the modified pTrcHisA pre-cut by the same pair of enzymes; this created pTrcHisA-LC and pTrcHisA-LC (E234A) plasmids. The stop codon at the end of each LC DNA was removed using the above method with the following primers: a, 5′-AAT AGA ACT GCA GGA GAA AAG CTT TAC GAC GAT GAC-3′; b, 5′-GTC ATC GTC GTA AAG CTT TTC TCC TGC AGT TCT ATT-3′. The HC gene was removed from the pMAL-HC plasmid (9Li Y. Aoki R. Dolly J.O. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 1200-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) byBamHI digestion and subcloned, in the correct reading frame, into the BamHI pre-cut pTrcHisA-LC and pTrcHisA-E234A plasmids, producing pTrcHisA-SC TeTx WT and pTrcHisA-SC TeTx E234A constructs. These two SC TeTx plasmids were separately transformed into competent E. coli cells (JM109 strain) by a heat-shock method (25Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8190) Google Scholar). The positive colonies were screened on Luria-Bertani agar plates containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin, and the isolated constructs were analyzed by DNA digestion, electrophoresis, and DNA sequencing, as detailed previously (14Li Y. Foran P. Fairweather N.F. de Paiva A. Weller U. Dougan G. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7014-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). All the work with the SC TeTx WT was carried out under containment level 3, according to an approved strict safety protocol. E. colitransformed with pTrcHisA-SC TeTx WT or E234A were used to inoculate 10 ml of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium, and grown overnight with agitation (200 rpm) at 37 °C. An aliquot (2 ml) of each culture was transferred to 200 ml of fresh LB medium with the addition of ampicillin (100 µg/ml); the cells were grown further at 37 °C with agitation to reach A 600 nm = 0.5 (about 2.5 h). Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG) was then added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the induction was allowed to proceed for 16 h at 37 °C before harvesting by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The cell pellets were resuspended in 30 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl) and lysed by addition of 5 ml of glass beads, followed by vigorous shaking for 10 min at 22 °C. The broken cells were centrifuged at 9000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. These SC TeTx WT and E234A lysates were separately mixed with 2 ml of Talon resin, previously equilibrated with the lysis buffer, and gently agitated at 22 °C for 20 min. After the two mixtures had been loaded into mini-columns and washed with 100 ml of lysis buffer, each recombinant toxin was eluted with 8 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm imidazole, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. The toxins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, using antibodies specific for His tag, LC, or HC, as detailed elsewhere (9Li Y. Aoki R. Dolly J.O. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 1200-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 14Li Y. Foran P. Fairweather N.F. de Paiva A. Weller U. Dougan G. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7014-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The two SC toxins were nicked by incubation with EK (1 unit/30 µg of protein) at 22 °C for 1 h, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 500 nm bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor. Recombinant HC was prepared as detailed in a previous study (9Li Y. Aoki R. Dolly J.O. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 1200-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and dialyzed into HEPES-buffered saline, pH 7.5. An appropriate concentration of each sample was incubated at 37 °C with 15 µm HV62, a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 33–94 of human synaptobrevin/VAMP-2 (HV62) in 60 µl of buffer (50 mmHEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.2 mg.ml−1 bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 50 µm ZnCl2). Bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (500 nm) was included in all incubations to prevent EK cleavage of HV62. The reactions were stopped after 30 min by addition of 60 µl of 5 mm EDTA and 1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (pH 2). Reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) on a Micropax C18 column equilibrated in 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid, and elution with a 0–60% acetonitrile gradient separated the products; the peak height of one (residues 77–94) was used to calculate the percentage of HV62 hydrolyzed (for details see Ref. 26Foran P. Shone C.C. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15365-15374Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Mouse phrenic-nerve hemi-diaphragm preparations were dissected, bathed in Krebs-Ringer (KR) buffer (in mm; NaCl 118, KCl 4.7, MgSO4 1.2, NaHCO3 23.8, KH2PO4 1.2, CaCl2 2.5, and glucose 11.7, pH 7.4) containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA and gassed with 5% CO2/95% O2. After equilibration, TeTx, a recombinant sample (or buffer as a control) was added and toxin-induced neuromuscular paralysis was determined as the time taken for nerve-evoked muscle contraction to decrease to 10% of original value, as described previously (9Li Y. Aoki R. Dolly J.O. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 1200-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 27de Paiva A. Ashton A.C. Foran P. Schiavo G. Montecucco C. Dolly J.O. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 2338-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For competition studies, conditions designed to minimize toxin uptake into the nerve endings were used. The hemi-diaphragms were preincubated for 60 min at 4 °C, in the absence and presence of a putative antagonist, in modified Krebs-Ringer buffer (MKR; equivalent to KR except for the addition of 3.8 mm MgCl2 and the reduction of CaCl2 to 0.5 mm) supplemented with 0.1% BSA and saturated with 95% O2/5% CO2. Native toxin (1 nm) was then added to the bath, and the incubation was continued for a further 30 min. The tissues were washed three times with MKR and then with KR before raising the temperature to 37 °C, stimulating the nerve, and recording the evoked muscle twitch (9Li Y. Aoki R. Dolly J.O. J. Biochem. 1999; 125: 1200-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). For quantitation of the lethality of each recombinant toxin relative to native TeTx, the samples (200 µl) were diluted into 0.9% (w/v) sterile saline containing 0.25% (w/v) BSA and injected subcutaneously into the two flanks of each mouse (4–5 weeks old, ∼20 g of body weight, four mice/group), and the LD50 values were determined, as described previously (28Maisey E.A. Wadsworth J.D.F. Poulain B. Shone C.C. Melling J. Gibbs P. Tauc L. Dolly J.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 683-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In some experiments, native TeTx was mixed with mutated TeTx SC or nicked, or HC before co-injection into mice; these animals were continuously monitored for the appearance of tetanus symptoms over the following 96 h. In view of the appreciable toxicity of the un-nicked toxin in mice, its susceptibility to nicking was evaluated. SC TeTx (50 µg) was treated at 37 °C for 0.5 h with trypsin (final concentration, 1 µg/ml), before the addition of SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min; 2 µg of the same toxin (treated similarly except not exposed to protease) was used as a control. All the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, in the presence of reducing agent, electrotransferred onto an Immobilon-P membrane, and stained with Ponceau red to reveal the HC, which was cut out for N-terminal sequencing. Because this showed that the peptide bond between Arg496 and Ser497 was cleaved (see “Results”), this Arg was replaced with Gly using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit with the following two primers: a, 5′-AAG GAT CGA TGG GGA TCC TCT GGA TCA TTA ACA GAT TTA GGA GGA-3′; b, 5′-TCC TCC TAA ATC TGT TAA TGA TCC AGA GGA TCC CCA TCG ATC CTT-3′. The construct was analyzed, and the protein (R496G) was expressed and purified as detailed above for WT; its susceptibility to various trypsin concentrations was monitored by SDS-PAGE and protein staining of the products. These cells were dissociated from the cerebella of 7- to 8-day-old rats, using established methodology (29Cambray-Deakin M.A. Cohen J. Wilkin G.P. Neural Cell Culture: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1995: 3-13Google Scholar). Neurons were suspended at 1–2 × 106/ml in medium consisting of 3 parts Basal Eagle's medium and 1 part of (in mm: 40 HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.3), 78.4 KCl, 37.6d-glucose, 2.8 CaCl2, 1.6 MgSO4, and 1.0 NaH2PO4), as well as 1 × N2 supplement, 1 mml-glutamine, 60 units/ml penicillin, 60 µg/ml streptomycin, and 5% (v/v) horse-dialyzed serum. An aliquot (1 ml) of this cell suspension was added to each 22-mm diameter poly-d-lysine-coated well, cytosine-β-d-arabinofuranoside (40 µm) was added after culturing for 20–24 h in 5% (v/v) CO2, and the neurons were maintained by weekly replacement of the same medium. Neurons cultured for at least 10 days were washed four times with O2-gassed Krebs-Ringer HEPES (KRH) (in mm: 20 HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), NaCl 128, KCl 5, NaH2PO41, CaCl2 1.4, MgSO4 1.2, d-glucose 10, and BSA 0.05 mg/ml (pH 7.4)) and 0.5 ml of the latter buffer containing 0.25 µCi/ml [14C]glutamine (i.e.the glutamate precursor (30Gallo V. Ciotti M.T. Coletti A. Aloisi F. Levi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7919-7923Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar)) was added. All steps were performed at 37 °C. After a 45-min labeling period, the neurons were washed four times as before and incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in KRH containing either 1.4 mm Ca2+ or 0.5 mm EGTA (i.e. to assess Ca2+-independent release); aliquots were retained for measurement of [14C]glutamate content by ion exchange HPLC analysis and scintillation counting (30Gallo V. Ciotti M.T. Coletti A. Aloisi F. Levi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7919-7923Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). A modified KRH buffer containing 50 mm KCl (with a reduced NaCl content of 83 mm to maintain osmolarity) and either 1.4 mm Ca2+ or 0.5 mm EGTA was added for a 5-min stimulation period. The amounts of [14C]glutamate in basal and stimulated samples were measured as above and expressed as a percentage of the total cell content. The quantities of KCl-induced [14C]glutamate released into EGTA-containing buffer were subtracted from the values recorded from Ca2+-containing samples to calculate the Ca2+-dependent component of evoked release. Two restriction enzyme sites (SalI andHindIII) were created inside the MCS and in front of the EK cleavage site in pTrcHisA vector (the original HindIII was replaced by SmaI). DNA encoding LC WT or E234A mutant (14Li Y. Foran P. Fairweather N.F. de Paiva A. Weller U. Dougan G. Dolly J.O. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7014-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) was inserted into pTrcHisA, and the stop codon at the end of each was removed before subcloning HC DNA into the pre-cut plasmids to yield pTrcHisA-SC TeTx WT or E234A constructs (Fig. 1), as detailed under “Materials and Methods.” The two constructs gave the expected DNA fragments on agarose gel electrophoresis when the requisite restriction enzymes were used (cf., Fig. 1); for example, digestion of either with a combination of SalI and HindIII released LC DNA, whereas BamHI gave HCDNA (data not shown). This subcloning of the SC TeTx gene resulted in 66 extra nucleotides at the 5′-end; also, a 51-nucleotide linker encoding an EK substrate consensus motif was present (Fig. 1). The DNA sequences obtained for the two constructs confirmed that they were in the correct reading frame. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the predicted SC protein WT or E234A has 17 extra residues in the linker; nicking by EK (between Lys489 and Asp490) should create the dichain composed of a LC, with 22 and 10 extra amino acids at its N and C termini, and HC having a 7-residue N-terminal extension. After transformation of E. coli with either of the above-noted constructs, expression of the proteins was induced by IPTG; in each case, a SC protein was obtained in the bacterial lysate but only after induction, as demonstrated by Western blotting with an anti-His tag antibody (Fig. 2 A). Moreover, the same single band was also recognized by polyclonal antibodies specific for TeTx LC or HC (Fig. 2 A). This evidence together with the expected size (∼150 kDa) on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions confirmed the identity of SC TeTx; an absence of smaller components excluded any nicking, degradation, or premature translation. SC TeTx was purified by nickel-affinity chromatography, as judged from the protein pattern on a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel run under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 2 B). A doublet was seen for SC TeTx E234A (Fig. 2 B) and WT (not shown), migrating slightly behind native TeTx as expected due to the extra residues; only a single band (molecular mass = 150 kDa) was observed under reducing conditions, indicative of the doublet seen in the absence of DTT being attributable to the disulfide in the HC being present in only a fraction of both the native and recombinant molecules (see below). In contrast to the documented SC toxin, native TeTx converted to HC and LC after reduction (Fig. 2 B). Having shown that the recombinant TeTx existed exclusively as an SC protein both in the E. coli lysate and in the purified state, its complete conversion to the dichain was achieved in vitro using EK to cleave the engineered site in the inter-chain linker (Fig. 1). After SC TeTx was incubated with EK, it still migrated in non-reducing SDS-PAGE as the 150-kDa doublet but was totally converted to HC and LC after reduction (Fig. 2, B andC). This established that the inter-chain disulfide had formed in all of the recombinant toxin. After purification, ∼4.5 mg of either SC TeTx WT or E234A was generally obtained from 500 ml of culture. An established RP-HPLC method, based on the proteolysis of HV62, a 62-mer polypeptide corresponding to residues 33–94 of human synaptobrevin-2, was used to measure the protease activities of the recombinant toxin preparations and investigate the influence of nicking. The initial rates of cleavage (TableI) were determined by quantifying one of the separated products (residues 77–94). Reduced SC TeTx gave a value of 8 nmol min−1mg−1, which represents 39% of that obtained for native dichain TeTx; this demonstrates, for the first time, that nicking is not an absolute prerequisite for the toxin's catalytic activity.

NADH+NADP++Hp+⇔NAD++NADPH+Hn+ REACTION1Its function in energy metabolism, biosynthesis, and detoxification has been discussed at length (1Rydstrom J. Hoek J.B. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 2Sazanov L.A. Jackson J.B. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In different organisms (and possibly in different tissues of the same organism) transhydrogenase can either utilize the proton electrochemical gradient (Δp) to drive reduction of NADP+ by NADH, or it can use NADPH oxidation by NAD+ to augment Δp formation. Energy coupling in transhydrogenase is indirect. In the forward direction (Reaction 1), protein conformational changes accompanying proton translocation bring together the nicotinamide rings of the bound nucleotides to allow the redox reaction (3Cotton N.P.J. White S.A. Peake S.J. McSweeney S. Jackson J.B. Structure. 2001; 9: 165-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This “binding-change mechanism” may share common features with energy coupling in some ion-translocating ATPases. More generally, transhydrogenase has a number of properties that make it an excellent model for understanding the principles of operation of conformationally linked pumps in biology.The polypeptide organization of transhydrogenases varies between species, but the arrangement of the three components, dI, dII, and dIII, is essentially the same in all (Fig.1). NAD(H) binds to dI, and NADP(H) binds to dIII; these two components protrude from the membrane (into the bacterial cytoplasm or mitochondrial matrix). The dII component spans the membrane, probably in 13 or 14 transmembrane helices (reviewed in Ref. 4Meuller J. Rydstrom J. J. Biol.

We shall refer to this structure as a generic dI2dII2dIII2“hexamer,” although, in terms of polypeptide composition, it corresponds to a homodimer in the bovine enzyme, an α2β2 tetramer in E. coli, and a (PntAA)2(PntAB)2(PntB)2 hexamer inRhodospirillum rubrum. Observations on the intact bovine enzyme indicate that interactions between the two dI-dII-dIII polypeptides are important in turnover. First, measurements of rates of transhydrogenation after partial chemical modification indicate reactivity in half of the sites (8Phelps D.C. Hatefi Y.

Remarkably, a simple mixture of dI and dIII proteins, even from different species, forms a complex that catalyzes transhydrogenation. Measurement of activity during titration of dI with dIII indicates that the two proteins become tightly associated (the apparent K d ≈ 20 nmfor the R. rubrum components) (13Diggle C. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure of the complex in crystals grown from an equimolar mixture of R. rubrum dI and dIII (in the presence of NAD+ and NADP+) has been recently solved at 2.5-Å resolution (3Cotton N.P.J. White S.A. Peake S.J. McSweeney S. Jackson J.B. Structure. 2001; 9: 165-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It is a dI2dIII1 heterotrimer. The two dI polypeptides, in similar although not identical conformations, are symmetrically organized about a two-fold axis. Distinctive clefts, in which the sites of NAD(H) binding are located (one in each dI polypeptide), face away from each other. The extensive contact surfaces in the dI dimer interface, and the fact that the complementary surfaces are hydrophobic, must reflect the structure of the dI component in the dI2dII2dIII2 hexamer. The single dIII polypeptide is positioned at the side of the cleft of only one of the dI polypeptides; the binding loop of the NADP+nicotinamide on the dIII is inserted into the cleft on the dI. It is clear that, in the intact enzyme, a second dIII component must be able to interact with the second dI during catalytic turnover. However, in modeling studies with the crystal structure, the docking of a second dIII to the dI2dIII1 complex in the same conformation as the first is blocked by clashing of amino acid sidechains in the dIII/dIII interface. This at least partly explains the failure to form the dI2dIII2 tetramer during crystallization. The question arises as to whether the restricting conformations are the consequence of crystallization forces, or whether the heterotrimer is the stable complex also in solution. Two previous studies provide some evidence for the latter. First, in mixtures of dI and dIII, there is a single turnover burst of transhydrogenation that precedes the slow steady-state rate (14Venning J.D. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Quirk P.G. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A fast kinetic component in the burst, thought to correspond to the transfer of hydride equivalents between nucleotides bound to the complex, requires two dI/dIII for saturation. Second, in NMR experiments, intensity changes in 1H-15N cross-peaks from backbone amide groups in R. rubrum dIII upon addition of R. rubrum dI indicate both a slow intermediate and an intermediate exchange between the two proteins (25Quirk P.G. Jeeves M. Cotton N.P.J. Smith K.J. Jackson J.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and this is taken as evidence for a high affinity (dI2 + dIII ↔ dI2dIII1) and a low affinity (dI2dIII1 + dIII ↔ dI2dIII2) interaction.On the basis of the crystal structures and the observations on the behavior of the complex of dI and dIII in solution, we proposed an alternating-site model for intact transhydrogenase; conformational changes resulting from proton translocation across the membrane give rise to changes in interaction between dIII and dI alternately in the two halves of the molecule, and these drive the nucleotide-binding changes that are responsible for coupling to the redox reaction (3Cotton N.P.J. White S.A. Peake S.J. McSweeney S. Jackson J.B. Structure. 2001; 9: 165-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,22Jackson J.B. Peake S.J. White S.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the experiments described below, we provide evidence for the stability of a dI2dIII1 heterotrimer in solution conditions, and we show that the binding of nucleotides to isolated dI and dIII is affected by heterotrimer formation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESThe isolation of DNA coding for the dI and dIII components ofR. rubrum transhydrogenase, the mutagenesis procedures, and the expression, purification, and storage of the proteins have been described (11Diggle C. Hutton M. Jones G.R. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 13Diggle C. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The dIII proteins were prepared either in their NADP+ form or their NADPH form, as described (14Venning J.D. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Quirk P.G. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). When necessary, proteins were concentrated by centrifugation through Vivaspin filters. All preparations were checked for purity by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were assayed for transhydrogenase activity with appropriate protein partners to ensure comparability with published data, again by established methods. Protein concentrations were determined by the micro tannin procedure (26Mejbaum-Katzenellenbogen S. Drobryszycka W.J. Clin. Chem. Acta. 1959; 4: 515-522Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard; previous results have shown that this assay gives similar results to other methods (13Diggle C. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For isolated dI and dIII, all concentrations are given in terms of the monomers unless otherwise stated.Isothermal titration calorimetry was carried out using the Microcal MCS as described in the figure legends. Data were analyzed using the instrument software.Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed in a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. Solutions were loaded into standard 12-mm double-sector cells and run at a rotor speed of 45,000 rpm, at 20 °C. Solute distribution was recorded at 4 min intervals using scanning absorbance optics at a wavelength of 280 nm. The data were analyzed using the time-derivative g(s*) method (27Stafford W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) to produce sedimentation coefficient distributions, from which information on heterogeneity, sedimentation coefficient, and diffusion coefficient were obtained. These data were then used in the Svedberg equation (28Svedberg T. Pederson K.O. The Ultracentrifuge. Oxford University Press, New York1940Google Scholar) to yield molecular weight information.Small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS)1 data were collected at the ID2 high brilliance beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France. The scattering curves were measured using a wavelength (λ) of 0.995 Å and with the detector positioned at 2.5 m from the sample (momentum transfer limits of 0.10 < Q < 2.67 nm−1, whereQ = 4πsinθ/λ and 2θ is the scattering angle). Following data reduction, the scattering curves were examined for radiation damage. Guinier analysis (29Guinier A. Fournet G. Small Angle Scattering of X-rays. John Wiley and Sons, New York1955Google Scholar) was performed using Igor Pro (Wavemetrics), and a macro designed by Kenneth Littrel and Diego Pontoni. Observed scattering profiles were compared with the predicted scattering curves produced by CRYSOL, version 2.1 (30Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2715) Google Scholar), using the Protein Data Bank file 1HZZ (and truncated forms thereof). Low resolution envelope functions were created using the program SASHA, version 2.04b (31Svergun D.I. Volkov V.V. Kozin M.B. Stuhrmann H.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1996; 52: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and were subsequently viewed using ASSA, version 2.0 (32Kozin M.B. Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 811-815Crossref Google Scholar).The rate of NADP+ release from dIII was measured using an enzyme trap (13Diggle C. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The dIII protein (1.0 µm), with or without 1.0 µm dI protein, was incubated in 2.0 mm isocitrate, 20 mm Mops, pH 7.2, at 25 °C, before addition of 5 units of isocitrate dehydrogenase. The subsequent fluorescence change accompanying the reduction of nucleotide as it dissociated from the dIII was measured using a Spex FluoroMax (340-nm excitation, 450-nm emission, 2.1-nm band pass). The change in NADPH fluorescence as it rebound to dIII was negligible. NADP+release from the E155W mutant of dIII following addition of excess NADPH was measured from the change in Trp fluorescence (15Yamaguchi M. Hatefi Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 33Rodrigues D.J. Venning J.D. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1430-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The dIII protein (with or without dI) was pre-incubated in 20 mm Mops, pH 7.2, containing 20 µmNADP+, at 20 °C for 5 min. Nucleotide exchange was then initiated by addition of NADPH (50 µm). The apparent first order rate constant for NADP+ release was calculated from the time course of the decrease in protein fluorescence (280-nm excitation, 338-nm emission, 2.1-nm band pass). The pH dependence of NADP+ release was determined in similar experiments but using a buffer mixture (20 mm Mes, 20 mm Hepes, 20 mm Mops).The rate of steady-state “reverse” transhydrogenation (see Reaction 1) in mixtures of dI and dIII was measured as the reduction of AcPdAD+ (an NAD+ analogue) by NADPH, from the absorbance change at 375 nm, as described previously (13Diggle C. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The dIII protein (final concentration 900 nm), and dI at various concentrations, were incubated at 25 °C in 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Mops, pH 7.2, containing 200 µm NADPH. The reaction was initiated by addition of AcPdAD+ (200 µm final concentration).Stopped flow experiments were performed on an Applied PhotophysicsDX-17MV operating in its fluorescence mode with 280-nm excitation light and >305-nm emission (selected with a WG305 cut-off filter) and with both monochromator slits set to band pass of 9.3 nm. Data were analyzed using the instrument software. For further details, see Refs. 14Venning J.D. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Quirk P.G. Jackson J.B. Eur. J.

Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 563-571PubMed Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThe results described above, from several different types of experiment, show that, in solution in the concentration range 10–100 µm, the isolated dI component of R. rubrum transhydrogenase is a dimer, isolated dIII is a monomer and the complex is a dI2dIII1 heterotrimer. The complex can catalyze a very fast redox reaction between NAD(H) on dI and NADP(H) on dIII (34Venning J.D. Peake S.J. Quirk P.G. Jackson J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19490-19497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), but evidently at just one of the two interfaces that can form in the complete, “hexameric” enzyme (dI2dII2dIII2). It was proposed that, in the complete enzyme, there are conformational changes that alternately bring together the two dI/dIII interfaces to permit the redox reaction (23White S.A. Peake S.J. McSweeney S. Leonard G. Cotton N.N.J. Jackson J.B. Structure. 2000; 8: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These conformational changes are coupled to proton translocation across the membrane. They are propagated in the membrane-spanning dII and are associated with changes in NADP+ and NADPH binding to dIII (22Jackson J.B. Peake S.J. White S.A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, dIII may adopt an “open” state, in which bound NADP(H) can readily exchange with nucleotides in the solvent, and an “occluded” state, in which this exchange is blocked. The occluded dIII can interact with dI such that hydride transfer between bound NADP(H) and NAD(H) is facilitated. The open dIII interacts only weakly with dI, and, in this state, redox chemistry between the bound nucleotides is prohibited. The switch is required to ensure the efficiency of energy coupling (i.e. to prevent proton translocation without redox chemistry andvice versa). Alternation of the sites is a consequence of out-of-phase co-ordination of the conformational changes: as one dI/dIII site is driven into the dIII-occluded state (e.g. by protonation of dII from the p-phase), the other is driven into the dIII-open state (e.g. deprotonation of dII to the n-phase, see Reaction 1). If the enzyme is undergoing turnover in the “forward” direction (Reaction 1), the first dI/dIII site then catalyzes hydride transfer from NADH to NADP+, while the second simultaneously releases product NADPH (and NAD+) and rebinds substrate NADP+(and NADH).Isolated dIII is predominantly in the occluded state; it can only release its bound nucleotide extremely slowly into the solvent (see below), but it can bind to dI dimer giving the heterotrimer, which can catalyze a rapid single turnover of hydride transfer between NAD(H) and NADP(H). In the context of the model, the difference in binding affinity of dI2, and of dI2dIII1, for dIII is an indication of the energy required to convert dIII into its open state. There is no direct measure of the K dfor dissociation of the heterotrimer into dI2+dIII. Analysis of the microcalorimetry (Fig. 2) and ultracentrifugation data (Fig. 3), and indirect observations by stopped-flow spectrophotometry (14Venning J.D. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Quirk P.G. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 34Venning J.D. Peake S.J. Quirk P.G. Jackson J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19490-19497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), suggest that binding is quite tight (K d < 1 µm) and this is consistent with a K d≈ 25 nm calculated from measurements of catalytic activity (13Diggle C. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). NMR experiments reveal an interaction between dI2dIII1 and a second molecule of dIII (25Quirk P.G. Jeeves M. Cotton N.P.J. Smith K.J. Jackson J.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Significantly, a comparison with the crystal structure shows that some of the amino acid residues involved in this interaction are equivalent to those involved in the interaction of the first dIII with dI2 within the heterotrimer. From the degree of dIII-resonance broadening at low concentrations of dI2, theKd for dissociation of a dIII from dI2dIII2 was estimated to be in the order of 10 µm. However, in the microcalorimetry and ultracentrifugation experiments described in this report, we failed to detect the formation of dI2dIII2 tetramer at protein concentrations in the range 10–100 µm, suggesting that the Kd determined by NMR is an underestimate; the value is more likely to be >100 µm. Thus, it may be calculated that the ΔG needed to switch from the occluded state of dIII to the open state (a free energy change, which, in the complete, “hexameric” enzyme, must be supplied by Δp and delivered through conformational changes in dII) is >21 kJ·mol−1. Since one proton is translocated per hydride transferred between nucleotides (40Bizouarn T. Sazanov L.A. Aubourg S. Jackson J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1273: 4-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), a ΔG of −21 kJ·mol−1 is available to transhydrogenase when Δp = 0.22 V.We previously observed that the rate of NADP+ release from isolated dIII is similar to the rate of reverse transhydrogenation catalyzed by the complex of dIII with dI (13Diggle C. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The implication was that reverse transhydrogenation is limited by the rate of product NADP+ release. However, the observation requires a slight refinement; because NADP+ release from the complex is substantially slower than from isolated dIII (Fig. 6), it is true only when reverse transhydrogenation is measured within a narrow range of protein concentrations (Scheme FS3). Since the rates of NADP+release from both isolated dIII and from the dI2dIII1 complex are slow relative to rates of formation and dissociation of the protein complex (and relative to hydride transfer and AcPdAD(H) binding and release), the nucleotide-binding sites on dIII, e.g. at 900 nm(Fig. 7), will become fully occupied with NADP+ even when the dI concentration is only ∼200 nm (i.e.[dI2] = ∼100 nm); effectively, one dI2 protein can productively visit many dIII molecules in the time it takes for the latter to release their nucleotide. At those low protein concentrations, most of the dIII.NADP+ is unattached to dI and the nucleotide is released from the protein with a rate constant of 0.022 s−1. As the dI concentration is increased, then more of the dIII.NADP+ will be in the dI2dIII1 complex, from which the nucleotide is released with a rate constant of 0.004 s−1. Experiments (see above and Ref. 13Diggle C. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) indicate that there will be a similar relationship for NADPH release and forward transhydrogenation, but this is difficult to establish on a quantitative basis because the rates are so low.The finding that NADP(H) release is faster from isolated dIII than from the dI2dIII1 complex might be relevant to our understanding of the process by which these nucleotides are released from the complete enzyme; this is a critical step, thought to be intimately associated with proton translocation. There are two possibilities. (a) The pathway for nucleotide diffusion away from its site is sterically restricted in the complex because of the position of dI. (b) Although the equilibrium still greatly favors the occluded state, there is a shift toward the open form when dIII dissociates from the complex. The crystal structures reveal that there might be some restriction to NADP(H) diffusion from the dIII site resulting from the positioning of the “RQD” and “mobile” loops on dI (see Ref. 3Cotton N.P.J. White S.A. Peake S.J. McSweeney S. Jackson J.B. Structure. 2001; 9: 165-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Note also that the side-chain amide of Gln132, from the RQD loop of dI, makes an H-bond across the interface with the 2′-OH of the nicotinamide ribose of NADP(H). Loop E (the “lid”) appears to be particularly important in maintaining the high affinity of isolated dIII for NADP(H) (23White S.A. Peake S.J. McSweeney S. Leonard G. Cotton N.N.J. Jackson J.B. Structure. 2000; 8: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); its location over the nucleotide, with which it makes numerous H-bonds, appears to be an essential feature of the occluded state, and it is presumably retracted in the formation of the open state of the protein. There are no direct contacts between loop E and dI to be seen in the crystal structure of dI2dIII1 and therefore no clear explanation as to how dI might directly shift the conformation of dIII toward the occluded state. However, an interaction between loop E and the dI mobile loop cannot be ruled out because of the weak electron density of the latter. Moreover, the N terminus of the important helix D/loop D of dIII makes several van der Waals and H-bond contacts (some involving invariant amino acid residues) with loop E. The central region of helix D/loop D, through highly conserved or invariant amino acid residues, interacts with the RQD loop of dI, and its C terminus is close to the expected position of the membrane-spanning dII. This feature is, therefore, well placed to co-regulate conformational changes in loop E and dI and, in the complete enzyme, to couple these to proton translocation.The organization of the dI2dIII1 complex in solution points to an explanation as to why there is a change inK d of just one of the two NADH-binding sites of the dI dimer upon addition of dIII (Fig. 8). We propose that the dI polypeptide whose cleft is occupied by dIII.NADPH has the greatly decreased NADH-binding affinity, whereas the dI polypeptide whose cleft is unoccupied by dIII has the NADH-binding affinity equivalent to that in isolated dI2. This is reminiscent of the finding that, in the crystal structure, the NAD+ electron density in theB polypeptide (which has dIII.NADP+ bound in its cle"

In embryonic stem cell-like F9 teratocarcinoma cells, which are widely used to study retinoic acid actions on gene regulation and early embryonic differentiation, retinoic acid treatment for 4 days resulted in suppression of cell growth and differentiation into primitive and then visceral endoderm-like cells, accompanied by a suppression of serum-induced c-Fos expression. The MAPK (ERK) pathway was involved in mitogenic signaling in F9 cells stimulated with serum. Surprisingly, although c-Fos expression was reduced, the MAPK activity was not decreased by retinoic acid treatment. We found that retinoic acid treatment inhibited the phosphorylation of Elk-1, a target of activated MAPK required for c-Fos transcription. In F9 cells, the MAPK/MEK inhibitor PD98059 suppressed Elk-1 phosphorylation and c-Fos expression, indicating that MAPK activity is required for Elk-1 phosphorylation/activation. Phosphoprotein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin), the major phosphatase for activated Elk-1, is not the target in the disassociation of MAPK activation and c-Fos expression since its inhibition by cyclosporin A or activation by ionomycin had no significant effects on serum-stimulated c-Fos expression and Elk-1 phosphorylation. Thus, we conclude that retinoic acid treatment to induce F9 cell differentiation uncouples Ras/MAPK activation from c-Fos expression by reduction of Elk-1 phosphorylation through a mechanism not involving the activation of phosphoprotein phosphatase 2B.

Up-regulation of AP-1 activity by retinoic acid contributes to cell differentiation (23Yang-Yen H.F. Chiu R. Karin M.

Through adapters, GDP/GTP exchange to activate Ras, and a kinase cascade, the extracellular signal causes the phosphorylation/activation of cellular MAPK (ERK) (32Egan S.E. Weinberg R.A.

Many studies have suggested that down-regulation of c-Fos expression interferes with the proliferation of tumor cells in vitro (45Brown J.R. Nigh E. Lee R.J. Ye H. Thompson M.A. Saudou F.

The physiological importance of c-Fos expression for proliferation and transformation is not as certain. Although gene knockout studies indicate that c-Fos is dispensable for cell proliferation and mouse development (48Hu E. Mueller E. Oliviero S. Papaioannou V.E. Johnson R. Spiegelman B.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3094-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), it contributes to and is essential for the malignant growth of solid tumor cells (49Saez E. Rutberg S.E. Mueller E.

In differentiated cells, retinoic acid can suppress c-Fos expression (50Jaffey P. Chan L.N. Shao J. Schneider-Schaulies J. Chan T.S. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 2384-2388PubMed Google Scholar, 51Ozeki A.

Oncogene. 1996; 12: 577-584PubMed Google Scholar), leading to growth reduction and apoptosis, suggesting that repression of c-Fos expression may be part of the differentiating activity of retinoic acid in somatic cells. We found that retinoic acid treatment for 4 days resulted in suppression of serum-induced c-Fos expression in F9 cells, and this reduction occurred during differentiation of F9 to endoderm-like cells. Surprisingly, the Ras/MAPK activity was not affected by retinoic acid treatment, although the phosphorylation of Elk-1 was inhibited. Thus, we conclude that retinoic acid treatment uncouples Ras/MAPK activation from c-Fos expression by reduction of Elk-1 phosphorylation. All-trans-retinoic acid and dibutyryl cAMP were purchased from Sigma. Kinase inhibitors PD98059 and SB202190, cyclosporin A, and ionomycin were purchased from Calbiochem. Tissue culture supplies were obtained from Fisher. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from Mediatech (Herndon, VA). The ECL Super-Signal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate immunodetection kit was purchased from Pierce. All other general chemicals and supplies, including Me2SO, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, and agarose, were from Sigma or Fisher and were reagent grade or higher. F9 mouse teratocarcinoma cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. The cells were cultured on tissue culture plates coated with 0.1% gelatin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and antibiotic/antimycotic solution. Cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified tissue culture incubator. All-trans-retinoic acid was dissolved in Me2SO to a stock concentration of 0.1 mm. Dibutyryl cAMP was dissolved in water to make a 50 mm stock. PD98059 and SB202190 were dissolved in Me2SO to make 50 and 6 mm stocks, respectively. These reagents were aliquoted, stored at −20 °C, and kept from light exposure until used. For serum stimulation experiments, the cells were first cultured for 18 h without serum in 1% bovine serum albumin or in low serum (0.5% FBS) and then were stimulated with 15% FBS for various times. Cell growth and cell numbers were estimated using the MTT assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's directions. Briefly, the cells were cultured in 96-well gelatin-coated plates (∼103 cells/well) under the specified experimental conditions with the addition of tested compounds. All experiments were performed in triplicate. The medium was changed every 2 days. At the end of the specified incubation period, the MTT reagent (15 µl) was added to cells and incubated for 2–4 h. The reactions were terminated by the addition of stop/solubilization solution (100 µl). Cell numbers were assessed spectrophotometrically at 570 nm by determining the conversion of tetrazolium salt to a colored formazan product. In our experience, the results from the MTT assay are consistent with cell number determined by counting. Polyclonal anti-Dab2 antibodies were characterized as previously described (53Xu X.-X. Yi T. Tang B. Lambeth J.D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1561-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and were used for immunoprecipitation. Monoclonal anti-Dab2 (p96) antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-c-Fos antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-actin antibodies were from Sigma. Anti-ERK1/2 and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology. Immunoblotting was performed according to standard procedures as described previously (53Xu X.-X. Yi T. Tang B.

After confirmation of antibody selectivity, two or more antibodies were in some cases used simultaneously in an incubation to detect various molecular mass proteins by Western blot analysis. F9, an embryonic stem cell-like teratocarcinoma cell line, can be differentiated into primitive and visceral endoderm by treatment with retinoic acid (9Hogan B.L. Taylor A. Adamson E.

Gudas L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26783-26788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Retinoic acid induced F9 cell differentiation, accompanied by cell growth suppression (Fig.1), which is mediated by retinoic acid receptor-β (10Faria T.N. Mendelsohn C. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26783-26788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Similar to many somatic cells, proliferation of F9 cells is serum-dependent. The MAPK pathway is involved in this mitogenic signaling since the MAPK/MEK inhibitor PD98059 inhibited serum-stimulated cell growth (Fig. 1). Retinoic acid treatment also inhibited F9 cell growth, but to a smaller degree than PD98059. In a representative example of four experiments, cell number following growth in the absence of serum was 16% of control cells cultured in 10% serum. The number of cells cultured in 1 µm retinoic acid or in the presence of PD98059 was 38 or 26%, respectively, of that of control cells cultured in 10% serum. One consequence of MAPK activation is the expression of immediate-early genes such as c-fos (38Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J.

Retinoic acid treatment for 4 days suppressed serum-stimulated c-Fos expression in F9 cells, as indicated by Western blotting (Fig.2), consistent with previous reports (23Yang-Yen H.F. Chiu R.

In serum-deprived F9 cells, serum stimulation resulted in elevated c-Fos expression after 30 min and maximal expression by 90 min. In retinoic acid-treated cells, however, c-Fos expression was greatly suppressed (Fig. 2). The decrease in c-Fos protein in retinoic acid-treated cells correlates with a reduced level of c-Fos mRNA detected by Northern blotting (data not shown). When the period of retinoic acid exposure was less than 1 day, retinoic acid had no effect on c-Fos expression in F9 cells (data not shown), and the inhibition of cell growth could be detected only after retinoic acid treatment for 2 or more days, suggesting that retinoic acid has no direct inhibitory effect on serum-stimulated c-Fos transcription and that the inhibition is likely the result of changes in the gene expression pattern during endoderm differentiation. In contrast, suppression of c-Fos expression by PD98059 (see below) could be observed in 30 min, and inhibition of F9 cell proliferation could be detected during the first day following the addition of the inhibitor. Following serum stimulation of F9 cells, MAPK was activated and remained fairly even for 15–90 min in both retinoic acid-differentiated or undifferentiated cells, as detected in immunoblots using antibodies specific for the phosphorylated/activated kinase (Fig. 3,A and B). On the same blot, a suppression of c-Fos expression by retinoic acid treatment was observed (Fig. 3,A and B). In >10 experiments, we consistently observed a suppression of c-Fos expression in F9 cells upon retinoic acid-induced differentiation, but no inhibition of serum-stimulated MAPK activity. Furthermore, we occasionally observed an enhancement of serum-stimulated MAPK activation in retinoic acid-treated F9 cells, also accompanying reduced c-Fos expression. We observed no inhibitory effect of retinoic acid treatment on Ras and Raf-1 activation by serum stimulation in F9 cells (data not shown), consistent with a previous report (21Verheijen M.H. Wolthuis R.M. Bos J.L. Defize L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1487-1494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, there is a disassociation between MAPK activation and c-Fos expression upon retinoic acid-induced endoderm differentiation of F9 cells. Dab2, a cell signaling phosphoprotein (54Xu X.-X. Yang W. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14184-14191Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), is a marker for primitive endoderm cells (17Cho S.Y. Cho S.Y. Lee S.H. Park S.S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 30: 179-184Google Scholar, 18Morrisey E.E. Musco S. Chen M.Y. Lu M.M. Leiden J.M. Parmacek M.S. J. Biol.

Xu, submitted for publication. Dab2 was present in retinoic acid-treated cells (Fig. 3 A), indicating the differentiation of the F9 cells when treated with retinoic acid. Following serum stimulation, progressive retardation of Dab2 migration on the SDS-polyacrylamide gel could be observed. This retardation is due to Dab2 phosphorylation by MAPK (54Xu X.-X. Yang W. Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14184-14191Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar),2 consistent with the unsuppressed activation of MAPK in retinoic acid-treated F9 cells. In both native and differentiated F9 cells, the MAPK isoform ERK2 is much more abundant than ERK1. This distribution differs in cells originating from adult animals such as the MOV mouse ovarian surface epithelial cell line, in which both the ERK1 and ERK2 isoforms of MAPK were found in near equal amounts (Fig. 3 D). Activated MAPK phosphorylates the transcription factor Elk-1 at serine 383, and phosphorylated Elk-1 binds with the ternary complex to the c-fos promoter and activates transcription (36Yang S.H. Shore P. Willingham N. Lakey J.H. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5666-5674Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Upon serum stimulation of F9 cells, the phosphorylation of Elk-1 was found to be maximal at 30 min (Fig. 3,A and B). We found that serum-stimulated Elk-1 phosphorylation was much reduced in retinoic acid-induced F9 cells (Fig. 3, A and B), despite a similar MAPK activity in treated and untreated cells. Additionally, the protein level of total Elk-1 was unaltered following retinoic acid-induced differentiation (Fig. 3 C). In an immunocomplex of anti-Elk-1 antibodies, the phosphorylation of Elk-1 at serine 383 was much reduced following retinoic acid treatment, despite a similar amount of total Elk-1 protein found in Elk-1 immunoprecipitates from either differentiated or undifferentiated cells (Fig. 3 C). Thus, the direct target of retinoic acid treatment in the MAPK pathway and suppression of c-Fos is the reduction of Elk-1 phosphorylation. Upon serum stimulation, a strong activation of MAPK (ERK1/2) was observed; however, no detectable JNK and p38MAPK activities were observed in retinoic acid-induced or undifferentiated control F9 cells (data not shown). The MAPK/MEK inhibitor PD98059 inhibited both Elk-1 phosphorylation (Fig.4A) and c-Fos expression (Fig.4 B). However, unlike the effect of retinoic acid-induced differentiation, PD98095 also eliminated serum-stimulated MAPK activation (Fig. 4 A). Inhibition by PD98095 indicates that MAPK phosphorylation of Elk-1 is essential for serum-stimulated c-Fos expression in F9 cells. As a control, the p38MAPK inhibitor SB202190 did not inhibit MAPK activation, Elk-1 phosphorylation, or c-Fos expression (Fig. 4), indicating that p38MAPKactivation is not required for serum-stimulated c-Fos expression in F9 cells. Thus, stimulation of MAPK activity appears to be necessary and sufficient for Elk-1 phosphorylation and c-Fos expression in undifferentiated F9 cells. In differentiated F9 cells, however, MAPK activation is not correlated with Elk-1 phosphorylation and c-Fos expression, indicating that retinoic acid induces an uncoupling of MAPK activity and Elk-1 phosphorylation/activation. One precedent for uncoupling of MAPK activation and Elk-1 transcriptional activity is the enhancement of PP2B (calcineurin) activity by KSR (56Sugimoto T. Stewart S. Han M. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). PP2B is the major phosphatase for the dephosphorylation of phosphorylated/activated Elk-1, leading to down-regulation of its activity (57Sugimoto T. Stewart S. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29415-29418Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 58Tian J. Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15173-15180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To determine if PP2B is responsible for the reduced phosphorylation of Elk-1 and suppressed expression of c-Fos in retinoic acid-treated F9 cells, we examined the effect of ionomycin (activator of PP2B) in these cells. Cellular second messenger calcium acting through calmodulin (59Hemenway C.S. Heitman J. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 30: 115-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 60Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 611-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar) can activate PP2B. In laboratory research, the calcium ionophore ionomycin is commonly used to increase cytosolic calcium levels, thus to activate PP2B. The addition of ionomycin had no significant effect on c-Fos expression (Fig. 5A), Elk-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 5 B), or MAPK activation (Fig.5 C) in both retinoic acid-treated and untreated F9 cells. At the highest dose of ionomycin (1 µm) used, it appeared that the phospho-Elk-1 level was slightly decreased in Me2SO-treated control cells (Fig. 5 B); however, no suppression of c-Fos expression could be detected in the same experiment (Fig. 5 A). Thus, the use of ionomycin to activate PP2B does not mimic the effect on c-Fos expression during retinoic acid-induced endoderm differentiation in F9 cells. Cyclosporin A is a specific inhibitor of PP2B (59Hemenway C.S. Heitman J. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 30: 115-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 61Matsuda S. Koyasu S. Immunopharmacology. 2000; 47: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). If retinoic acid treatment increases PP2B activity, leading to suppression of Elk-1 phosphorylation and c-Fos expression, cyclosporin A should cause an elevation or restoration of phosphorylated Elk-1 levels and c-Fos expression in differentiated F9 cells. We found that inhibition of PP2B by cyclosporin A did not enhance serum-stimulated c-Fos expression (Fig. 6A), Elk-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 6 B), or MAPK activation (Fig. 6,A and B) in either undifferentiated or differentiated F9 cells. In contrast, cyclosporin A appeared to slightly reduce c-Fos expression at high doses. Thus, the response of either undifferentiated or differentiated F9 cells to ionomycin and cyclosporin differs from that of COS-7 and 293 cells, which are responsive regarding c-Fos expression to these agents (56Sugimoto T. Stewart S. Han M. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 57Sugimoto T. Stewart S. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29415-29418Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 58Tian J. Karin M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19649-19654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Therefore, we conclude that the uncoupling of MAPK activation and c-Fos expression by retinoic acid-induced F9 differentiation is at the step of inhibition of Elk-1 phosphorylation (Fig.7). However, decreased Elk-1 phosphorylation is not due to an increase in PP2B activity following retinoic acid-induced differentiation in F9 cells. Thus, through an unclear mechanism without the participation of PP2B activation, MAPK activation and Elk-1 phosphorylation are disassociated in F9 cells following retinoic acid-induced primitive endoderm differentiation, resulting in suppression of c-Fos expression and correlating with cell growth reduction.Figure 7Disassociation of c-Fos expression and MAPK activation in retinoic acid-induced F9 cell differentiation.Shown is a schematic illustration of the effect of retinoic acid (RA), PD98095, ionomycin, and cyclosporin A on MAPK activation, Elk-1 phosphorylation, and c-Fos expression. Retinoic acid-induced F9 cell differentiation results in the inhibition of c-Fos expression due to inhibition of Elk-1 phosphorylation. However, retinoic acid treatment does not inhibit MAPK activation, unlike the action of PD98095. PP2B may dephosphorylate Elk-1 and suppresses c-Fos expression. Cyclosporin A inhibits PP2B and may enhance Elk-1 activity and c-Fos expression, whereas ionomycin activates PP2B and may decrease Elk-1 phosphorylation and suppress c-Fos expression. The lack of inhibition of c-Fos expression by ionomycin in undifferentiated F9 cells and the lack of a stimulating effect on c-Fos expression by cyclosporin A in retinoic acid-treated F9 cells suggest that PP2B is not involved in the regulation of Elk-1 phosphorylation and c-Fos expression in F9 cells during endoderm differentiation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) F9 cells are undifferentiated, with characteristics resembling those of stem cells in early embryos, and have been widely used to study early embryonic development and retinoic acid regulation (9Hogan B.L. Taylor A. Adamson E. Nature. 1981; 291: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 10Faria T.N. Mendelsohn C. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. J. Biol.

Retinoic acid induction of cell differentiation is usually accompanied by reduced cell proliferation, due to suppression of cell cycle progression (62Wu S Donigan A. Platsoucas C.D. Jung W. Soprano D.R. Soprano K.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 232: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 63Faria T.N. LaRosa G.J. Wilen E. Liao J. Gudas L.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 143: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The growth-suppressive activity of retinoic acid in F9 cells is retinoic acid receptor-β-dependent (10Faria T.N. Mendelsohn C. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26783-26788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism for growth suppression by retinoic acid is not yet certain, several possibilities have been investigated. One possibility is that retinoic acid suppresses cell growth by the induction of the transforming growth factor-β pathway (64Han G.R. Dohi D.F. Lee H.Y. Rajah R. Walsh G.L. Hong W.K. Cohen P. Kurie J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13711-13716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Many studies have also indicated that retinoic acid treatment inhibits AP-1 activity (52Soprano D.R. Chen L.X. Wu S. Donigan A. Borghaei R.C. Soprano K.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 577-584PubMed Google Scholar, 65Lin F. Xiao D. Kolluri S.K. Zhang X. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3271-3280PubMed Google Scholar, 66Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R.

Here, we found that retinoic acid treatment reduced serum-stimulated c-Fos expression. Surprisingly, retinoic acid treatment had no effect on MAPK activation, thus uncoupling MAPK activation and c-Fos expression. The effect of retinoic acid has been determined to be on the phosphorylation and activation of Elk-1, a transcription factor required for c-Fos expression (Fig. 7). A few studies have previously shown uncoupling of MAPK activation and Elk-1 phosphorylation/activation (56Sugimoto T. Stewart S. Han M. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 67Zhao C., Yu, D.H. Shen R. Feng G.S. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 2001; 77: 239-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, transfection of the KSR mammalian ortholog of Drosophila KSR can inhibit Elk-1 phosphorylation and activation without affecting MAPK activity (56Sugimoto T. Stewart S. Han M. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The effect of KSR was shown to be through the activation of PP2B (calcineurin), the major phosphatase for Elk-1 (57Sugimoto T. Stewart S. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29415-29418Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 58Tian J. Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15173-15180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The mechanism for the activation of PP2B by KSR has not been defined. A second example is the Grb2-binding adapter protein Gab2, the likely mammalian ortholog of Drosophila DOS. Gab2 uncouples MAPK activity and Elk-1 phosphorylation/activation when transfected into mammalian cells, although the mechanism is yet unknown (67Zhao C., Yu, D.H. Shen R. Feng G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19649-19654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A third example is α-synuclein, a chaperon protein that has been identified as a component of Lewy bodies in Parkinson's disease and diffuse Lewy body disease (68Iwata A. Miura S. Kanazawa I. Sawada M. Nukina N. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 239-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of α-synuclein prominently attenuates Elk-1 phosphorylation without inhibiting MAPK (68Iwata A. Miura S. Kanazawa I. Sawada M. Nukina N. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 239-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). α-Synuclein is associated with both MAPK and Elk-1 and presumably imposes upon the kinase and substrate a nonproductive conformation (68Iwata A. Miura S. Kanazawa I. Sawada M. Nukina N. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 239-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, another Grb2-binding protein (53Xu X.-X. Yi T. Tang B. Lambeth J.D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1561-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), Dab2, can uncouple MAPK activation and c-Fos expression when transfected into tumor cells (69He, J., Smith, E. R., and Xu, X.-X. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, in press.Google Scholar). Dab2 expression is often lost in tumor cells (70Fazili Z. Sun W. Mittelstaedt S. Cohen C. Xu X.-X. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3104-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and re-expression of Dab2 suppresses cell growth and tumorigenicity (55Sheng Z. Sun W. Smith E. Cohen C. Sheng Z. Xu X.-X. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4847-4854Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 71Mok S.C. Chan W.Y. Wong K.K. Cheung K.K. Lau C.C. Ng S.W. Baldini A. Colitti C.V. Rock C.O. Berkowitz R.S. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2381-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), suggesting a tumor suppressor function. However, the mechanism for the action of Dab2 in uncoupling MAPK activation and c-Fos expression is also unknown. It is possible that Dab2 mediates the retinoic acid-induced uncoupling of MAPK activation and c-Fos expression and the suppression of cell growth since Dab2 is induced by retinoic acid in F9 cells (Fig. 3 A) (17Cho S.Y. Cho S.Y. Lee S.H. Park S.S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 30: 179-184Google Scholar). We have attempted transfection to establish Dab2 expression in F9 cells; however, none of the G418-resistant clones were found to have significant Dab2 expression. Several additional genes including collagen IV are induced along with dab2 by GATA-6 during primitive endoderm differentiation (17Cho S.Y. Cho S.Y. Lee S.H. Park S.S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 30: 179-184Google Scholar, 18Morrisey E.E. Musco S. Chen M.Y. Lu M.M. Leiden J.M. Parmacek M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19949-19954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 19Tanaka S. Kaytes P. Kurkinen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8862-8870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Laminin is also induced directly by retinoic acid in F9 cells during retinoic acid-induced differentiation (10Faria T.N. Mendelsohn C. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26783-26788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 20Vasios G.W. Gold J.D. Petkovich M. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9099-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We speculate that expression of dab2 coordinately with several additional genes achieves a balanced signal during F9 cell differentiation; thus, expression of Dab2 alone (without additional working partners) is likely to be incompatible for cell maintenance and growth, which may account for the inability to isolate Dab2-transfected F9 cells. There are several possible mechanisms to be considered for how retinoic acid treatment acts to uncouple MAPK and Elk-1. First, retinoic acid may act to dephosphorylate Elk-1, similar to KSR in activating PP2B (56Sugimoto T. Stewart S. Han M. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Retinoic acid may do so by inducing calcium influx or recruiting PP2B to a particular cellular location close to Elk-1. PP2B does not appear to be responsible for the retinoic acid-induced suppression of Elk-1 phosphorylation and activation since the specific inhibitor (cyclosporin A) and the calcium ionophore and potential PP2B activator (ionomycin) have no effect on c-Fos expression with or without retinoic acid treatment of F9 cells. To modulate PP2B activity, we have tested ionomycin in a wide range of concentrations since, at low doses, ionomycin may inhibit PP2B, but it also may activate the Ras/MAPK pathway at higher doses (59Hemenway C.S. Heitman J. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 30: 115-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 60Crabtree G.R. Cell. 1999; 96: 611-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Thus, the response of either undifferentiated or differentiated F9 cells to ionomycin and cyclosporin A is different from that of COS-7 and 293 cells, which are responsive regarding c-Fos expression to these agents (56Sugimoto T. Stewart S. Han M. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1717-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 57Sugimoto T. Stewart S. Guan K.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19649-19654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It is possible that PP2B is not expressed in F9 cells, and this possibility remains to be examined. Alternatively, retinoic acid treatment may inhibit phosphorylation of Elk-1 by MAPK, such as preventing the productive association between Elk-1 and MAPK, as in the case of α-synuclein (68Iwata A. Miura S. Kanazawa I. Sawada M. Nukina N. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 239-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), blocking nuclear entry of activated MAPK, sequestration of Elk-1 from being phosphorylated by activated MAPK. We are currently investigating these possibilities. Uncoupling of MAPK activation and c-Fos expression during endoderm differentiation may enable the cells to attenuate the mitogenic signal of MAPK through Elk-1 and c-Fos, leaving an unsuppressed MAPK activity in endoderm cells. Whether c-Fos expression is critical in F9 cells for mitogenic signaling is not certain. Nevertheless, changes in the ability of serum to activate c-Fos expression accompany F9 cell differentiation into endoderm-like cells and provide a mechanism for the different interpretation and response of the serum signal of the differentiated cells. It is likely that there are many substrates for MAPK beside Elk-1 in primitive endoderm cells. Activated MAPK probably is needed for other processes such as further cell differentiation, migration, cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, and structural organization. Our finding that retinoic acid-induced F9 cell differentiation into primitive endoderm cells uncouples MAPK activity and Elk-1 phosphorylation (Fig. 7) adds additional complexity and flexibility to the regulation of the Ras/MAPK pathway.

We report evidence for a novel nuclear export signal in HAP95 and showed that the domains involved in RHA binding and nuclear localization are required for CTE activation. Finally, we showed that HAP95 synergizes significantly with RHA on CTE-mediated reporter gene expression and promotes nuclear export of unspliced mRNA in transfected cells.

At least two distinct pathways have been utilized. The complex retroviruses, such as HIV,1encode the viral protein Rev, which acts as an adapter between the Rev response element (RRE) on the viral RNA and the cellular export receptor, CRM-1 (reviewed in Refs. 1Hope T.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar and 2Pollard V.W. Malim M.H. Annu. Rev. Micro. 1998; 52: 491-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). In contrast, the simian type D retroviruses do not encode a Rev-like protein but rather act through a cis-acting constitutive transport element (CTE). CTE is functionally equivalent to the Rev/RRE of HIV and presumably interacts directly with cellular export proteins to mediate the nuclear export of unspliced viral RNA. Two cellular proteins, RNA helicase A (RHA) and Tip-associated protein (3Tang H. Gaietta G.M. Fischer W.H. Ellisman M.H. Wong-Staal F. Science. 1997; 276: 1412-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 4Gruter P. Tabernero C. von Kobbe C. Schmitt C. Saavedra C. Bachi A. Wilm M. Felber B.K. Izaurralde E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 649-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), were shown to bind to functional CTE and are implicated in CTE-mediated RNA nuclear export and gene expression.RHA was identified previously as a nuclear protein capable of unwinding RNA duplexes in an ATP-dependent manner (5Zhang S. Grosse F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20483-20490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our laboratory first reported that RHA binds specifically to functional CTE and is required for CTE activity (3Tang H. Gaietta G.M. Fischer W.H. Ellisman M.H. Wong-Staal F. Science. 1997; 276: 1412-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We further showed that RHA is a nuclear shuttle protein, with overlapping import and export signals localized to the carboxyl-terminal region (6Tang H. McDonald D. Middlesworth T. Hope T. Wong-Staal F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3540-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, we showed that RHA plays a role in RRE-mediated gene expression (7Li J. Tang H. Mullen T. Westberg C. Reddy T.R. Rose D.W. Wong-Staal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We proposed that RHA is required to release both CTE- and RRE-containing mRNA from spliceosomes before completion of splicing, thus freeing them for nuclear export (6Tang H. McDonald D. Middlesworth T. Hope T. Wong-Staal F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3540-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 7Li J. Tang H. Mullen T. Westberg C. Reddy T.R. Rose D.W. Wong-Staal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Others have reported that RHA mediates molecular interactions between RNA polymerase II and the cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein and is required for activation of transcription in response to cAMP (8Nakajima T. Uchida C. Anderson S.F. Lee C.G. Hurwitz J. Parvin J.D. Montminy M. Cell. 1997; 90: 1107-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). These reports suggest that RHA is a multifunctional protein involved in both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events.The nuclear export of cellular mRNA and retroviral mRNA may proceed by a similar mechanism, facilitated by distinct specific RNA-binding proteins containing nuclear export signals (NESs). As part of our effort to further understand the role of RHA in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, we searched for functionally relevant RHA-binding proteins. A novel shuttle protein, HAP95, was identified to interact with the nuclear transport domain of RHA in the yeast two-hybrid assay (9Westberg C. Yang J.-P. Tang H. Reddy T.R Wong-Staal F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21396-21401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). HAP95 also up-regulates CTE function when co-expressed with a CTE reporter gene (9Westberg C. Yang J.-P. Tang H. Reddy T.R Wong-Staal F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21396-21401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). HAP95 has extensive homology with AKAP95, a member of the A-kinase anchoring protein family (10Coghlan V.M. Langeberg L.K. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7658-7665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, HAP95 lacks the characteristic protein kinase A binding domain of this family.In this report, we further characterize the different domains of HAP95 that may contribute to its activity on CTE-mediated gene expression. We identified a novel export signal of 17 amino acids that bears no homology with any known signal sequences, as well as two RHA-binding regions in HAP95. We also found that the amino-terminal domain of HAP95, including a YG-rich sequence, was essential for transactivation of CTE, whereas a mutant truncated in the amino-terminal region exerted a dominant negative effect. Interestingly, HAP95 synergizes with RHA on CTE-mediated gene expression in human cells. These results broaden our understanding of nucleo-cytoplasmic protein transport through the identification of a new type of shuttling signal and transport pathway.DISCUSSIONThe Rev protein of HIV-1 promotes the nuclear export of RRE-containing mRNA by directly binding to the export receptor hCRM1 through its NES (15Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar, 16Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, 17Ossareh-Nazari B. Bachelerie F. Dargemont C. Science. 1997; 278: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Rev function is inhibited by the antibiotic leptomycin B, which disrupts the interaction of hCRM1 and RanGTP, thus abolishing the export of the NES-containing proteins. The CTE of type D retroviruses, in contrast, functions independently of hCRM1 and is therefore insensitive to leptomycin B. This latter export pathway appears to be shared by most cellular mRNAs. Our laboratory has shown that RHA not only binds to CTE but also plays a critical role in mediating the nuclear export of CTE-containing mRNA (7Li J. Tang H. Mullen T. Westberg C. Reddy T.R. Rose D.W. Wong-Staal F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The shuttling function of RHA was not affected by leptomycin B (6Tang H. McDonald D. Middlesworth T. Hope T. Wong-Staal F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3540-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In searching for proteins that bind specifically to the NTD of RHA, we identified HAP95, which also up-regulates CTE-mediated gene expression (9Westberg C. Yang J.-P. Tang H. Reddy T.R Wong-Staal F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21396-21401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this work, we have extended this earlier study by mapping the functional domains of HAP95 and providing strong evidence for a direct role of HAP95 in RHA-mediated nuclear export of CTE-containing mRNA.HAP95 also shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. We identified a strong NES with 17 amino acids localized between a classical basic NLS and a bipartite NLS in HAP95 (Fig. 1). This NES has no similarity to known signals for nuclear export, including the leucine-rich NES found in Rev and the bi-directional transport signals found in hnRNP A1, hnRNP K, and RHA (6Tang H. McDonald D. Middlesworth T. Hope T. Wong-Staal F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3540-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 19Michael W.M. Eder P.S. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3587-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the HAP95 NES could not rescue the function of an NES-defective Rev mutant (data not shown). Interestingly, we found that the NES signal in HAP95 was neither necessary nor sufficient for its activation of CTE-mediated gene expression (Fig. 3 B). In fact, deletion of NES resulted in a greater than 2-fold increase in activation over full-length HAP95. It is possible that the NES of RHA and HAP95 compete for a subset of cellular factors even though they may have different conditions for nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking. This is evidenced by the fact that with actinomycin D treatment, RHA distributes to the cytoplasm, whereas HAP95 stays in the nucleus (data not shown). Nonetheless, further investigation on the HAP95 NES may reveal a new pathway of nuclear export for other proteins containing a similar NES.We have mapped the minimal functional domains of HAP95 to its amino-terminal half of the protein. The critical regions include a YG-clustered region at the amino terminus, the first AKAP95 homology domain (H1), and the classical NLS (Fig. 3 B). Deletion of the bipartiite NLS significantly impaired but did not abolish CTE activation. Of these regions, the H1 domain appears to be required for binding of the functional subfragment HAP95 (1) to RHA (Fig.4 B), and NLS is required for nuclear localization of the protein (Fig. 3 C). Deletion of the YG domain both in full-length and (1) of HAP95 completely abolished their CTE activation function (Figs. 3 B and 4 B), without affecting their ability to shuttle or to bind RHA. Therefore, the role of this domain remains to be determined. It is intriguing to note that these YG repeats are not found in AKAP95 (Fig. 1). Despite extensive BLAST searches, we could not find similar YG repeats in other proteins. Taking together, the amino terminus of HAP95 is responsible for its activation of the CTE-mediated gene expression pathway.The results with the H1 deletion strongly suggest that HAP95 activation of CTE requires the directly binding of RHA (Fig. 4). This conclusion was further supported by the observation that HAP95 (1), which was fully active, did not bind to CTE RNA (Figs. 3 B and 5). Furthermore, HAP95 and RHA interaction is independent of RNA (RNase-resistant). However, the most convincing and most striking evidence for the functional interaction of HAP95 and RHA was their dramatic synergy on activation of CTE-mediated gene expression in vivo (Fig. 6, A and B). This synergy was specific because AKAP95, which has extensive homology with HAP95, had no such effect. An RHA mutant lacking helicase activity also failed to act on its own or to synergize with HAP95 in activating CTE-dependent gene expression.We also directly demonstrated that both RHA and HAP95 promote an increase in cytoplasmic accumulation of CTE-containing RNA, using an RNase protection assay (Fig. 7). Because HAP95 does not directly bind CTE and its NES is not required for this effect, its exact mechanism of action is not known. We hypothesized that this effect is mediated through its direct interaction with RHA. Currently, a number of cellular proteins have been implicated in CTE-mediated gene expression. In addition to RHA and HAP95, Tap was shown to bind CTE and mediate CTE function in quail cells (20Kang Y. Cullen BR. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1126-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 21Braun I.C. Rohrbach E. Schmitt C. Izaurralde E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1953-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We recently reported that Sam68, which activates basal as well as Rev-mediated RRE- gene expression, also significantly activated gene expression of a CTE-gag/pol construct (13Reddy T.R. Xu W. Mau J.K.L. Goodwin C.D. Suhasini M. Tang H. Frimpong K. Rose D.W. Wong-Staal F. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 22Reddy T.R. Tang H. Xu W. Wong-Staal F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3570-3575Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We further showed that RHA functionally interacts with Tap and Sam68 (22Reddy T.R. Tang H. Xu W. Wong-Staal F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3570-3575Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Based on these and other results, we proposed that Sam68, RHA, and Tap cooperate in the post-transcriptional regulation of HIV and type D retroviral mRNA. Recently, an NTF2-like protein, p15, was found to bind to Tap and to enhance the binding of Tap to CTE (23Katahira J. Straber Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Jung J.U. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1999; 16: 3256-3271Google Scholar). One can expect that additional factors relevant to this regulatory pathway will still be discovered and that these various cellular factors may contribute to the function of CTE and RRE at various steps between RNA transcription and nuclear export. These may include splicing, mRNA stability, polyadenylation, and nuclear retention. Additional insights into these processes should be gained as the network of interacting proteins and RNA is elucidated. Post-transcriptional regulation is an essential phase in the life cycle of many retroviruses. A key regulatory step in this phase involves the nuclear export of unspliced viral RNA, which requires the interaction of viral RNA and/or proteins with cellular factors.

McDonald D. Middlesworth T. Hope T. Wong-Staal F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3540-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In searching for proteins that bind specifically to the NTD of RHA, we identified HAP95, which also up-regulates CTE-mediated gene expression (9Westberg C. Yang J.-P. Tang H. Reddy T.R Wong-Staal F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21396-21401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this work, we have extended this earlier study by mapping the functional domains of HAP95 and providing strong evidence for a direct role of HAP95 in RHA-mediated nuclear export of CTE-containing mRNA. HAP95 also shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. We identified a strong NES with 17 amino acids localized between a classical basic NLS and a bipartite NLS in HAP95 (Fig. 1). This NES has no similarity to known signals for nuclear export, including the leucine-rich NES found in Rev and the bi-directional transport signals found in hnRNP A1, hnRNP K, and RHA (6Tang H. McDonald D. Middlesworth T. Hope T. Wong-Staal F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3540-3550Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 18Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 19Michael W.M. Eder P.S. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3587-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, the HAP95 NES could not rescue the function of an NES-defective Rev mutant (data not shown). Interestingly, we found that the NES signal in HAP95 was neither necessary nor sufficient for its activation of CTE-mediated gene expression (Fig. 3 B). In fact, deletion of NES resulted in a greater than 2-fold increase in activation over full-length HAP95. It is possible that the NES of RHA and HAP95 compete for a subset of cellular factors even though they may have different conditions for nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking. This is evidenced by the fact that with actinomycin D treatment, RHA distributes to the cytoplasm, whereas HAP95 stays in the nucleus (data not shown). Nonetheless, further investigation on the HAP95 NES may reveal a new pathway of nuclear export for other proteins containing a similar NES. We have mapped the minimal functional domains of HAP95 to its amino-terminal half of the protein. The critical regions include a YG-clustered region at the amino terminus, the first AKAP95 homology domain (H1), and the classical NLS (Fig. 3 B). Deletion of the bipartiite NLS significantly impaired but did not abolish CTE activation. Of these regions, the H1 domain appears to be required for binding of the functional subfragment HAP95 (1) to RHA (Fig.4 B), and NLS is required for nuclear localization of the protein (Fig. 3 C). Deletion of the YG domain both in full-length and (1) of HAP95 completely abolished their CTE activation function (Figs. 3 B and 4 B), without affecting their ability to shuttle or to bind RHA. Therefore, the role of this domain remains to be determined. It is intriguing to note that these YG repeats are not found in AKAP95 (Fig. 1). Despite extensive BLAST searches, we could not find similar YG repeats in other proteins. Taking together, the amino terminus of HAP95 is responsible for its activation of the CTE-mediated gene expression pathway. The results with the H1 deletion strongly suggest that HAP95 activation of CTE requires the directly binding of RHA (Fig. 4). This conclusion was further supported by the observation that HAP95 (1), which was fully active, did not bind to CTE RNA (Figs. 3 B and 5). Furthermore, HAP95 and RHA interaction is independent of RNA (RNase-resistant). However, the most convincing and most striking evidence for the functional interaction of HAP95 and RHA was their dramatic synergy on activation of CTE-mediated gene expression in vivo (Fig. 6, A and B). This synergy was specific because AKAP95, which has extensive homology with HAP95, had no such effect. An RHA mutant lacking helicase activity also failed to act on its own or to synergize with HAP95 in activating CTE-dependent gene expression. We also directly demonstrated that both RHA and HAP95 promote an increase in cytoplasmic accumulation of CTE-containing RNA, using an RNase protection assay (Fig. 7). Because HAP95 does not directly bind CTE and its NES is not required for this effect, its exact mechanism of action is not known. We hypothesized that this effect is mediated through its direct interaction with RHA. Currently, a number of cellular proteins have been implicated in CTE-mediated gene expression. In addition to RHA and HAP95, Tap was shown to bind CTE and mediate CTE function in quail cells (20Kang Y. Cullen BR. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1126-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 21Braun I.C. Rohrbach E. Schmitt C. Izaurralde E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1953-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We recently reported that Sam68, which activates basal as well as Rev-mediated RRE- gene expression, also significantly activated gene expression of a CTE-gag/pol construct (13Reddy T.R. Xu W. Mau J.K.L. Goodwin C.D. Suhasini M. Tang H. Frimpong K. Rose D.W. Wong-Staal F. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 635-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 22Reddy T.R. Tang H. Xu W. Wong-Staal F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3570-3575Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We further showed that RHA functionally interacts with Tap and Sam68 (22Reddy T.R. Tang H. Xu W. Wong-Staal F. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3570-3575Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Based on these and other results, we proposed that Sam68, RHA, and Tap cooperate in the post-transcriptional regulation of HIV and type D retroviral mRNA. Recently, an NTF2-like protein, p15, was found to bind to Tap and to enhance the binding of Tap to CTE (23Katahira J. Straber Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Jung J.U. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1999; 16: 3256-3271Google Scholar). One can expect that additional factors relevant to this regulatory pathway will still be discovered and that these various cellular factors may contribute to the function of CTE and RRE at various steps between RNA transcription and nuclear export. These may include splicing, mRNA stability, polyadenylation, and nuclear retention. Additional insights into these processes should be gained as the network of interacting proteins and RNA is elucidated.

https://openalex.org/W2038566391,"Cyclin A is essential for regulating key transitions in the eukaryotic cell cycle including initiation of DNA replication and mitosis. This paper describes the characterization of a truncated cyclin A isoform (cyclin At) in vitro in cultured mammalian cells and in mouse tissues. The presence of cyclin At in specific cell types correlates with the ability of cell extracts to cleave in vitrotranslated cyclin A. In CHO-K1 cells, cyclin A processing to cyclin At occurs at the N terminus; it does not involve the 26 S proteasome, nor could it be induced by conditional overexpression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1. However, high cell densities lead to increased cyclin At levels. Unlike full-length cyclin A, cyclin At localizes to the cytoplasm, where it binds Cdk2. The data suggest that cyclin A processing occurs in vivo to yield an N-terminally truncated isoform by an unknown mechanism that is regulated by cell density. Differential subcellular localization may provide the first insights into the physiological role of cyclin At."
https://openalex.org/W2062062669,"We investigated intracellular mechanisms involved in the up-regulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor I (PAI-1) synthesis by human recombinant tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) during monocyte differentiation of HL-60 cells triggered by the transforming growth factor-β1/vitamin D3 (TGF/D3) mixture. TGF/D3-treated cells expressed surface monocytic markers and produced noticeable amounts of PAI-1 but stopped to proliferate. A reduced p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) phosphorylation was also observed and, in this situation, TNF dramatically enhanced PAI-1 synthesis. Similarly, TNF significantly up-regulated PAI-1 synthesis when p70S6K phosphorylation was inhibited by rapamycin. This phenomenon was not due to a general decrease in protein synthesis but involved the activation of gene transcription rather than PAI-1 mRNA stabilization. The level of the transcriptional regulator factor E2F1, a repressor of PAI-1 gene expression, was shown to be down-modulated in TGF/D3- as well as in rapamycin-treated cells. Furthermore, the apoptotic effect of TNF in HL-60 cells appeared to be prevented by the addition of either TGF/D3 or rapamycin. In conclusion, these results indicate that inhibition of p70S6K phosphorylation during TGF/D3-induced monocyte differentiation of HL-60 cells is a determinant factor that allows TNF to exert its up-regulating effect on PAI-1 synthesis while protecting cells from apoptosis.

A property that can be considered essential for monocytes/macrophages to exert their roles is their ability to emigrate from the circulating blood pool into different tissues or structures. This ability is mainly secured by the expression of pericellular proteolytic activities, with the partial involvement of the fibrinolytic system (4Plow E.F. Ploplis V.A. Busuttil S. Carmeliet P.

Because of its potency to inhibit plasminogen activation, Plasminogen activator inhibitor I (PAI-1)1 can be considered the cornerstone of fibrinolytic system regulation (7Juhan-Vague I. Alessi M.C.

Changes in gene expression during monocyte/macrophage differentiation have been investigated (11Tamayo P. Slonim D. Mesirov J. Zhu Q. Kitareewan S. Dmitrovsky E. Lander E.S. Golub T.R. Proc. Natl.

Matsushima K. Blood. 2000; 96: 2584-2591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and, in these studies, PAI-1 mRNA levels were reported to increase. During differentiation of HL-60 cells, which are usually used as a model to study monocyte/macrophage differentiation, Krichevsky et al. (14Krichevsky A.M. Metzer E. Rosen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14295-14305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) described a cluster of mRNAs, including PAI-1 mRNA, that are more associated to polysomes, which are more susceptible to translation into proteins. Thus, during monocyte differentiation, PAI-1 synthesis was unanimously reported to increase. We investigated pathways leading to PAI-1 production during HL-60 cell differentiation toward the monocyte lineage. We showed that, upon treatment of these cells by the TGF/D3 mixture, PAI-1 synthesis largely increased and this increase could be up-regulated by the addition of TNF (15Lopez S. Peiretti F. Bonardo B. Juhan-Vague I. Nalbone G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3081-3087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Signaling pathways allowing this cellular event were reported to be different from those responsible for PAI-1 synthesis induced by phorbol esters, which involves activation of the pathway protein kinase Cβ/extracellular-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) followed by autocrine stimulation of neosynthesized TNF (15Lopez S. Peiretti F. Bonardo B. Juhan-Vague I. Nalbone G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3081-3087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cell differentiation and cell proliferation arrest can be considered as two associated features. For instance, differentiation of monocyte precursors occurs when cells stop growing (16Horiguchi-Yamada J. Yamada H. Nakada S. Ochi K. Nemoto T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 132: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 17Kanatani Y. Kasukabe T. Okabe-Kado J. Hayashi S. Yamamoto- Yamaguchi Y. Motoyoshi K. Nagata N. Honma Y. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 187-196PubMed Google Scholar). On the contrary, during the atherosclerotic process smooth muscle cell dedifferentiation is accompanied by their proliferation (18Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9909) Google Scholar). The enzyme p70S6K was originally described as responsible for the phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6 (19Novak-Hofer I. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5995-6000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Jeno P. Ballou L.M. Novak-Hofer I. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Its specific inhibition by rapamycin (RAP) was shown to reduce the translation of 5′-TOP mRNA (21Jefferies H.B.J. Fumagalli S. Dennis P.B. Reinhard C. Pearson R.B. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3693-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) mainly coding for proteins involved in the translation process, which results in a decrease in their amount and in turn leads to a general decrease in translation. The activity of the p70S6K closely correlates with cell proliferation (22Volarevic S. Thomas G. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 65: 101-127Crossref Google Scholar) and cell cycle regulation (23Kuo C.J. Chung J. Fiorentino D.F. Flanagan W.M. Blenis J. Crabtree G.R.

In this work, we investigated possible links between TGF/D3-induced HL-60 cell differentiation, p70S6K activity, and up-regulation of PAI-1 synthesis by TNF. Our results strongly suggest that, during TGF/D3-triggered monocyte differentiation of HL-60 cells, the inhibition of p70S6K activity allows TNF to fully stimulate PAI-1 production. This likely occurs through a decrease in the level of the PAI-1 transcriptional inhibitor E2F1. Monoclonal antibodies (12A4 and 15H12) specific for human PAI-1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were generously given by Dr. P. Declerck (Center for Thrombosis and Vascular Research, Leuven, Belgium). Antibodies raised against p70S6K and E2F1 (C-20) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. The phospho-p70S6K-specific antibody recognizing threonine 389 when phosphorylated was from New England BioLabs.

Cycloheximide was from Sigma Chemical Co. Molecular biology products (dNTP, random hexaprimers, RNasin, and appropriate buffers) were from Life Technologies, Inc. The human promyelocytic HL-60 leukemia cell line was kindly provided by Pr. E. Huberman (Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL) and cultured as described previously (28Lopez S. Peiretti F.

Cells in 72-h-old culture medium were incubated for 1 h in fresh medium and then treated. Human monocyte-derived macrophages were prepared as described previously (29Rouis M. Nigon F. Lafuma C. Hornebeck W. Chapman M.J. Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 246-255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proper controls made with a similar concentration of vehicle alone were without effect on the parameters studied. Cells were lysed in the buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Cell lysates were centrifuged, and proteins of the supernatant were separated using an 8% SDS-PAGE according to Laemmli (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar), electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, which was hybridized with the antibody. Detection was performed by the use of alkaline phosphatase-coupled secondary antibodies and the colorimetric substrate nitro blue tetazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. A population of 106 HL-60 cells (5.105/ml) was incubated either with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated monoclonal antibody raised against CD11b (Beckman-Coulter) washed and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, or with the unlabeled monoclonal antibody directed against CD71 (Dako), washed and incubated with the appropriate fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Beckman-Coulter), washed again and fixed as described above. Cells were analyzed on a XL-cytofluorograph (Coulter Electronics Inc.) at 488 and 525 nm, corresponding to excitation and detection wavelengths, respectively. Cells were treated for 12 h with TNF or TNF + RAP, then 1 mCi of [35S] methionine/106 cells was added to the media for 30 min. Cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed using Triton X-100 0.1%. Proteins were precipitated by two volumes of acetone, and pellets were suspended in the same lysis buffer. The amount of precipitated counts was measured by scintillation counting, and proteins were assayed according to specifications of the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Sigma). Protein synthesis is expressed as cpm/µg of protein/min. DNA was extracted using a QIAamp DNA mini kit from Qiagen according to the manufacturer's instructions. The same amounts of DNA were loaded and separated by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel and visualized under UV irradiation. Total RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, PAI-1, and eEF1α PCR were performed as described previously (28Lopez S. Peiretti F. Morange P. Laouar A. Fossat C. Bonardo B. Huberman E. Juhan-Vague I. Nalbone G. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 81: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The mRNA of PAI-1 was measured by real time semiquantitative RT-PCR using a PE Applied Biosystems Prism, model 7700 sequence detection instrument. Sequences of primers and probe for the Taqman PCR were designed using Primer Express software from PE Applied Biosystems. Threshold cycle,C t, which inversely correlates with the target mRNA levels, was measured as the cycle number at which the reporter fluorescent emission increases above a threshold level. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. Comparisons were analyzed by analysis of variance, and significance was calculated atp < 0.01 using the Scheffe F-test. We reported that HL-60 cells treated with a mixture of TGF/D3 increased PAI-1 synthesis, which was then largely potentiated by the addition of TNF (28Lopez S. Peiretti F. Morange P. Laouar A. Fossat C. Bonardo B. Huberman E. Juhan-Vague I. Nalbone G. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 81: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), whereas others showed that this mixture triggers HL-60 cell differentiation toward the monocytic lineage (31Morikawa M. Harada N. Soma G. Yoshida T. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1990; 26: 682-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 32Okabe-Kado J. Honma Y. Hayashi M. Hozumi M.

To clarify if PAI-1 production correlated with monocytic progression, we analyzed the effect of TGF/D3, associated or not with TNF on some parameters characteristic of monocyte differentiation. Arrest in cell proliferation is considered as a prerequisite to cell differentiation (34Wang Q.M. Studzinski G.P. Chen F. Coffman F.D. Harrison L.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 238-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 35McCarthy D.M. San Miguel J.F. Freake H.C. Green P.M. Zola H. Catovsky D. Goldman J.M. Leuko. Res. 1983; 7: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In our culture conditions, the untreated HL-60 cell population had a doubling time of roughly 24 h and all the treatments used in this study inhibited proliferation (Table I). Treatments with either TGF/D3 or TGF/D3/TNF were the most potent to reduce proliferation, because after 24 h of culture, cells grew by less than 10%. Surface expression of CD11b and CD71 were described to positively and negatively correlate with the process of HL-60 cell differentiation (33Testa U. Masciulli R. Tritarelli E. Pustorino R. Mariani G. Martucci R. Barberi T. Camagna A. Valtieri M. Peschle C. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2418-2430PubMed Google Scholar, 36Trayner I.D. Bustorff T. Etches A.E. Mufti G.J. Foss Y. Farzaneh F. Leuk. Res. 1998; 22: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), respectively. The increase in CD11b surface expression was optimal upon treatment with the mixture of TGF/D3/TNF (+4.9-fold compared with control cells). This mixture also triggered an optimal, although weak, decrease in CD71 surface expression (−1.5-fold compared with control cells). Compared with control cells, TNF alone exerted intermediate effects on proliferation and surface marker expression. These results indicate that treatment with the mixture of TGF/D3/TNF can be considered as the most potent stimulation used in this study to trigger monocyte differentiation of HL-60 cells. As previously reported (28Lopez S. Peiretti F. Morange P. Laouar A. Fossat C. Bonardo B. Huberman E. Juhan-Vague I. Nalbone G. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 81: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and shown herein, PAI-1 accumulation was enhanced upon treatment with the mixture of TGF/D3 (+18.3-fold compared with control cells) and greatly increased with the simultaneous addition of TNF (+100-fold compared with control cells). Taken together, these data are in accordance with the existence of a link between HL-60 cell differentiation toward monocyte lineage and PAI-1 production, which suggests that induction of cell differentiation is a prerequisite for PAI-1 synthesis stimulated or not by TNF. We thus investigated which intracellular pathway triggered PAI-1 production and was involved in the early steps of the differentiation process.Table IPAI-1 production associates with HL-60 cells differentiation×106 cells/mlCD11bCD71PAI-1 ng/106cellsControl1.01.0 ± 0.241.0 ± 0.0210.4 ± 0.04TGF/D30.562.1 ± 0.0820.84 ± 0.0327.32 ± 0.841-aSignificant atp < 0.01 versus untreated (control) cells.TGF/D3/TNF0.594.88 ± 0.361-aSignificant atp < 0.01 versus untreated (control) cells.0.68 ± 0.041-aSignificant atp < 0.01 versus untreated (control) cells.40.38 ± 2.721-aSignificant atp < 0.01 versus untreated (control) cells.TNF0.761.27 ± 0.0810.82 ± 0.010.86 ± 0.16Cell were seeded at a density of 0.5.106/ml.

Values are means ± S.D. from at least three separate experiments each performed in triplicate. As mentioned above, cell growth cessation can be considered as a prerequisite for cell differentiation. Table I shows that reduction in cell proliferation is accompanied by an increase in PAI-1 synthesis. Because an increasing line of evidence suggests that p70S6K is a potential regulator of cell growth (22Volarevic S. Thomas G. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 65: 101-127Crossref Google Scholar, 37Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar), we investigated possible relationships between p70S6K phosphorylation and PAI-1 synthesis. Phosphorylation of p70S6K was analyzed by its migration shift on SDS-PAGE and detection by immunoblot and also by immunoblot using a phospho-p70S6K antibody able to detect p70S6K only when activated by phosphorylation of the threonine at position 389. The phosphorylation status deduced from these two means of investigation was shown by others to closely correlate with p70S6K activity (38Weng Q.-P. Kozlowski M. Belham C. Zhang A. Comb M.J. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16621-16629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The TGF/D3 mixture inhibited p70S6K phosphorylation (Fig.1, A and B), whereas each compound had no effect when used alone (not shown). TNF did not alter the basal or the TGF/D3-modified p70S6Kphosphorylation (Fig. 1, A and B). All the data above showed that 1) p70S6K activity was reduced in the presence of TGF/D3, a situation in which PAI-1 production is increased, and 2) that TNF addition has a minor effect on PAI-1 synthesis, but greatly increased it when added to the mixture of TGF/D3. This prompted us to further investigate relationships between p70S6Kactivity and TNF on PAI-1 synthesis. To further investigate if a reduced p70S6Kactivity was involved in TNF-stimulated PAI-1 synthesis, we inhibited the kinase activity by RAP (Fig. 1, A and B), a highly specific inhibitor of p70S6K activity (39Sehgal S.N. Ther. Drug Monit. 1995; 17: 660-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 40Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3910) Google Scholar), and measured PAI-1 production. PAI-1 synthesis from D3-treated cells (data not shown) and TGF/D3(±TNF)-treated cells was not significantly increased by RAP (Fig. 2). The result obtained in this last case could be explained by the fact that, as shown in Fig. 1, TGF/D3 mixture was as effective as RAP in inhibiting p70S6K activity, not allowing p70S6K activity to be additionally inhibited by RAP. However, the original finding is that inhibition of p70S6K activity by RAP was able to enhance the stimulatory effect of TNF on PAI-1 production by a factor of 2.7 (Fig. 2). This suggests that a decrease in p70S6Kactivity allows TNF to exert its full activating potential on PAI-1 synthesis. The activating effect of RAP on PAI-1 production was also significant on cells stimulated by TGF/TNF (factor 2) and by TGF (factor 1.9). The fact that the slight, but non-significant increase in CD11b expression triggered by TNF (Table I) was not further enhanced by RAP treatment (data not shown) ruled out a general up-regulating effect of RAP on TNF-induced gene expression. The permissive effect of RAP on TNF-induced PAI-1 synthesis was also observed on in vitro-matured human monocytes/macrophages. The synthesis of PAI-1 was not significantly altered by TNF or RAP (28 ± 3 and 29.4 ± 1 ng/ml, respectively) compared with untreated cells (26.3 ± 2 ng/ml), whereas the association of TNF and RAP increased the level of PAI-1 by 42% (37.4 ± 2 ng/ml). Because RAP appeared to closely mimic the effect of TGF/D3 on TNF-induced up-regulation of PAI-1, we further investigated how RAP was involved in this process. The literature documents that total protein synthesis decreases during HL-60 cell differentiation (14Krichevsky A.M. Metzer E. Rosen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14295-14305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), although the synthesis of some proteins, like PAI-1, is specifically increased. We previously reported that PAI-1 synthesis can be down-regulated at the level of translation (41Peiretti F. Alessi M.C. Henry M. Anfosso F. Juhan-Vague I. Nalbone G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 1550-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), suggesting that conditions exist during which PAI-1 mRNA are weakly translated. A prediction of the model of Lodish (42Lodish H.F. Nature. 1974; 251: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) is that a partial block of elongation would impede the initiation of the efficiently translated mRNAs, thereby making translation factors more available for weakly translated mRNAs. In our experimental conditions, RAP was able to completely stop the proliferation of HL-60 cells (not shown) and to decrease total protein synthesis by half when compared with TNF-treated cells, after 24 h of incubation (Fig. 3). We therefore investigated if a general decrease in protein synthesis, rather than a specific decrease in p70S6K activity, was involved in the permissive effect of RAP on TNF-stimulated PAI-1 production. We incubated TNF-stimulated HL-60 cells with a low dose of cycloheximide (0.1 µg/ml). In this case, PAI-1 production was neither increased by TNF nor by TNF + RAP treatments (not shown), suggesting that a reduction in protein synthesis itself is not responsible for the increased PAI-1 production triggered by RAP on TNF-treated HL-60 cells. In the aim to understand how RAP was able to increase PAI-1 synthesis in TNF-treated cells, we investigated at which step RAP action took place. Surprisingly, RAP significantly increased the level of PAI-1 mRNA (Fig. 4). Blockage in protein synthesis with cycloheximide did not impair the increase in PAI-1 mRNA level induced by TNF and TNF + RAP (Fig. 4) suggesting thatde novo protein synthesis is not necessary in these situations to increase PAI-1 mRNA level. Results obtained from experiments using actinomycin D ruled out a possible stabilization effect of RAP on PAI-1 mRNA to explain the observed increase in PAI-1 mRNA level. Conversely, fine analysis using real time semiquantitative RT-PCR showed that RAP slightly destabilized PAI-1 mRNA (Fig. 5). These results suggest that RAP increased the PAI-1 transcription rate in TNF-treated HL-60 cells.Figure 5RAP does not destabilize PAI-1 mRNA.HL-60 cells were stimulated for 6 h with TNF or TNF + RAP then actinomycin D (2.5 µg/ml) was added. Total RNA was extracted 5 h later and reversed-transcribed, and PAI-1 mRNA levels were evaluated using real time semiquantitative RT-PCR as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Ct, threshold cycle.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We then hypothesized that the reduced protein synthesis triggered by RAP and associated with the decrease in p70S6K activity was able to reduce the level of a PAI-1 transcriptional inhibitor. E2F1 was recently demonstrated to bind the PAI-1promoter and to repress PAI-1 transcription (43Koziczak M. Krek W. Nagamine Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2014-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Its level was described to be quickly reduced upon cell growth arrest due to a destabilization of its mRNA (44Kirkham P.A. Lam E.W. Takamatsu H.H. Parkhouse R.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1630-1636PubMed Google Scholar, 45Saunders N.A. Dicker A.J. Jones S.J. Dahler A.L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1646-1649PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 6, the protein level of E2F1 was reduced by treatments allowing HL-60 cell differentiation (TGF + D3 and TGF + D3 + TNF). TNF had no effect on E2F1 level, but RAP alone or associated with TNF reduced E2F1 protein level. This result indicates that RAP can mimic the down-modulating effect of TGF + D3 on E2F1 level, which may account for the relief of inhibition inPAI-1 gene transcription and allowing TNF to activate it. TNF was reported to induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells (46Yanagisawa-Shiota F. Sakagami H. Kuribayashi N. Iida M. Sakagami T. Takeda M. Anticancer Res. 1995; 15: 259-265PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated this phenomenon in our experimental conditions (Fig.7). After 24 h of treatment, TNF alone induced a detectable DNA fragmentation reflecting the apoptotic process. Incubation with TGF/D3 or RAP clearly protected cells from the TNF-induced apoptotic effect as the DNA pattern closely resembled to that of control HL-60 cells. This protective effect was also induced by D3 alone. The literature concerning quantitative and qualitative remodeling of gene expression during monocyte differentiation has been extensively documented by the use of new technologies such as microarray (11Tamayo P. Slonim D. Mesirov J. Zhu Q. Kitareewan S. Dmitrovsky E. Lander E.S. Golub T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2907-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (2385) Google Scholar, 12Shiffman D. Mikita T. Tai J.T. Wade D.P. Porter J.G. Seilhamer J.J. Somogyi R. Liang S. Lawn R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37324-37332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 13Suzuki T. Hashimoto S. Toyoda N. Nagai S. Yamazaki N. Dong H.Y. Sakai J. Yamashita T. Nukiwa T. Matsushima K. Blood. 2000; 96: 2584-2591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the identification of signaling components involved in the alteration of the expression of the vast majority of these genes is still missing. We contributed to answer this question by studying PAI-1 expression during HL-60 cell differentiation triggered by the mixture of TGF/D3. We previously reported that stimulation of PAI-1 production by TGF/D3 was further increased following TNF addition, which did not involve the ERK1/2 pathway (28Lopez S. Peiretti F. Morange P. Laouar A. Fossat C. Bonardo B. Huberman E. Juhan-Vague I. Nalbone G. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 81: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the intracellular mechanisms involved in this up-regulation. We first hypothesized that the arrest in cell proliferation, considered as a prerequisite for differentiation, was involved in the stimulation of PAI-1 production. The fact that PAI-1 production is concomitant with proliferation arrest and differentiation supported this hypothesis (Table I). Several papers mentioned the important role of p70S6K activity in the proliferation process (22Volarevic S. Thomas G. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 65: 101-127Crossref Google Scholar, 26Kanayasu-Toyoda T. Yamaguchi T. Uchida E. Hayakawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25471-25480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 37Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Our results (Fig. 1 and Table I) showed that a decrease in p70S6K phosphorylation was closely associated with both TGF/D3-induced monocyte differentiation and PAI-1 production. RAP, which allows the binding of FKBP12 to FRAP (the enzyme responsible for P70S6K phosphorylation), provoked a similar level of inhibition of P70S6K phosphorylation as TGF/D3, although the level of PAI-1 synthesis it induced was lower than that of TGF/D3. The elucidation of the mechanisms responsible for these differences was beyond the scope of this work, because we focused our interest on intracellular mechanisms that allow TNF to up-regulate PAI-1 synthesis during TGF/D3-induced differentiation. When used alone, TNF induced a low level of PAI-1 synthesis. However, when associated with TGF/D3 or RAP, TNF was now able to dramatically up-regulate PAI-1 synthesis (Fig. 2). This supports the contention that a complete decrease in p70S6K activity brought by a differentiative stimulus allowed TNF to exert its full potential of stimulation on PAI-1 synthesis. Levels of PAI-1 mRNA, undetectable in native HL-60 cells, were induced upon TGF/D3 treatment (15Lopez S. Peiretti F. Bonardo B. Juhan-Vague I. Nalbone G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3081-3087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and we show herein that RAP was also able to increase the level of PAI-1 mRNA when associated to TNF (Fig. 4). Induction of gene expression upon RAP treatment was reported in yeast (47Hardwick J.S. Kuruvilla F.G. Tong J.K. Shamji A.F. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14866-14870Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). In mammals, RAP was shown to potentiate glucocorticoid receptor-mediated gene induction, probably by increasing the nuclear translocation of the glucocorticoid receptor (48Ning Y.M. Sanchez E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6073-6076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in this case, FK506 (which allows the binding of FKBP12 to calcineurin) triggered the same effect, ruling out a role of p70S6Kactivity inhibition in this process. Our findings that RAP, but not FK506, 2F. Peiretti, S. Lopez, P. Deprez-Beauclair, B. Bonardo, I. Juhan-Vague, and G. Nalbone, unpublished data. potentiates a TNF-mediated increase in PAI-1 synthesis suggests for the first time, to our knowledge, that under particular circumstances, inhibition of p70S6K activity can result in an increased gene expression. This increase was neither due to a prolonged PAI-1 mRNAs half-life, because RAP slightly destabilized PAI-1 mRNA (Fig. 5), nor tode novo protein synthesis (Fig. 4), which was expected because RAP decreased global protein synthesis (Fig. 3). Furthermore, experiments using cycloheximide showed that a global decrease in protein synthesis is not responsible and not favorable for PAI-1 synthesis during TNF stimulation. The transcriptional regulator E2F1 was recently demonstrated to bind the PAI-1 promoter and to repress PAI-1 gene transcription (43Koziczak M. Krek W. Nagamine Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2014-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Its level was reduced during HL-60 cell differentiation and also treatment with RAP (Fig. 6), which makes the relief of E2F1-induced inhibition that follows inactivation of p70S6K a reasonable explanation for the permissive effect of RAP on TNF-induced PAI-1 synthesis. We also show herein that apoptosis triggered by TNF could be circumvented by D3 and RAP (Fig. 7). RAP was shown to protect HL-60 cells from apoptosis triggered by didemnin B (49Johnson K.L. Lawen A. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) through an effect that did not seem to involve p70S6K activity. Inversely, RAP was reported to increase the ability of the alkylating agent, cisplatin, to induce apoptosis in HL-60 (50Shi Y. Frankel A. Radvanyi L.G. Penn L.Z. Miller R.G. Mills G.B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1982-1988PubMed Google Scholar). Whether RAP inhibited TNF-induced apoptosis through the blockage of p70S6Kactivity is outside of the confines of this work. Nevertheless, we can hypothesize that, when apoptosis, triggered by TNF, is prevented, the stimulatory effect of TNF on PAI-1 production is exerted on more viable cells for a longer period of time allowing PAI-1 synthesis to be increased. Therefore, apoptosis can be considered as a negative factor for PAI-1 synthesis during HL-60 differentiation. Thus, RAP mimics at least four associated events triggered during TGF/D3-induced HL-60 cell differentiation that allow TNF to up-regulate PAI-1 synthesis: (i) decrease in cell proliferation, (ii) decrease in p70S6Kphosphorylation, (iii) decrease in E2F1 protein level, and (iv) decrease in TNF-induced HL-60 cell apoptosis. Potential pharmacological modulation of vascular remodeling by rapamycin has been highlighted by different results in the literature. Rapamycin was shown to inhibit proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro and ex vivo (51Marx S.O. Jayaraman T. Go L.O. Marks A.R. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 412-417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,52Poon M. Marx S.O. Gallo R. Badimon J.J. Taubman M.B. Marks A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2277-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Administration of rapamycin in pig reduced the arterial cell proliferation response after balloon angioplasty by targeting regulators of cell cycle-like E2F (53Gallo R. Padurean A. Jayaraman T. Marx S. Roque M. Adelman S. Chesebro J. Fallon J. Fuster V. Marks A. Badimon J.J. Circulation. 1999; 99: 2164-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The regulatory effect of the fibrinolytic system on smooth muscle cell migration/proliferation (54Carmeliet P. Moons L. Lijnen R. Janssens S. Lupu F. Collen D. Gerard R.D. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3180-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and neointimal leukocyte infiltration (55Carmeliet P. Moons L. Ploplis V. Plow E. Collen D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 200-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) after arterial injury has been clearly demonstrated. Whether rapamycin may modulate these effects through PAI-1 synthesis could be envisioned, because we observed that RAP up-regulated PAI-1 synthesis in TNF-stimulated human peripheral monocyte-derived macrophages. In conclusion, our results support the notion that the reduced p70S6K activity that occurs when HL-60 cells differentiate toward a monocyte lineage, driven by the TGF/D3 mixture, is a key event that allows TNF to have its optimal stimulatory effect on PAI-1 synthesis.

Translocation has been thoroughly studied in prokaryotes and a good picture of the global mechanism at molecular level is starting to emerge. Key aspects in such progress have been the elucidation of ribosome structure at good resolution (8Ban N. Nissen P. Hansen J. Capel M. Moore P.B. Steitz T.A. Science. 1999; 400: 841-847Google Scholar) and detailed crystallographic studies of EF-G, the prokaryotic homolog of EF-2 (9Czworkowski J. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Moore P.B.

Biol. 2000; 10: R369-R373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar for a review). EF-G, the protein that promotes ribosomal translocation in prokaryotes, is a tadpole-like molecule organized into five domains. The globular domain I is responsible for GTP binding and hydrolysis. It contains several structural motifs characteristic of the G-protein superfamily (indeed, it is referred to as “G-domain”) plus an extra insert called the G′-subdomain. The role of the latter remains unknown, although it has been suggested to act as a nucleotide-exchange factor (9Czworkowski J. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Moore P.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3661-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Interaction of the G-domain with the ribosome triggers GTP hydrolysis, and the energy released is transformed into mechanical movement. Eventually, domain IV (a fibrous domain at the other end of the molecule) moves away, stretching the EF-G shape and literally pushing the newly formed peptidyl-tRNA from the A to the P ribosomal site (15Agrawal R.K. Heagle A.B. Penczek P. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 643-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). It is still unclear how energy is transformed into movement, although it seems to be related to rearrangements within both EF-G and the ribosome that allow the complex to act as a molecular ratchet (15Agrawal R.K. Heagle A.B. Penczek P. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 643-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 16VanLoock M.S. Agrawal R.K. Gabashvill I.S. Qi L. Frank J. Harvey S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 507-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The eukaryotic system has not been so deeply studied. However, it seems to be more sophisticated, as demonstrated by the larger number of proteins constituting the eukaryotic ribosome and by the ability to regulate EF-2 function by specific kinases (17Ryazanov A.G. Shestakova E.A. Natapov P.G. Nature. 1988; 334: 170-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) and ADP-ribosylation (18Iglewski W.J. Fendrick J.L. ADP-ribosylating Toxins and G-proteins: Insights into Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1990: 511-524Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the general features of the process are assumed to be the same. In coherence with this, there is a substantial degree of homology between bacterial EF-G and eukaryotic EF-2. The more relevant differences are the greater length of EF-2 and the regulatory mechanisms depicted above. Likewise, it is remarkable that the G′-subdomain has been replaced in EF-2 by another insert termed the G“-subdomain, which is 15–30 residues longer, with a position that is displaced beyond in the sequence, and shows no homology with the prokaryotic G′-subdomain (19Aevarsson A. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 41: 1096-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). On the other hand, EF-2 is a highly conserved protein within the entire eukaryotic kingdom. This fact makes especially striking the existence of EF-2 inhibitors such as sordarin, which exclusively impair fungal and not bacterial, mammalian, or plant protein synthesis machinery with the added capacity to discriminate between closely related fungal species (6Justice M.C.

Identification of the residues involved in sordarin binding to EF-2 might help to explain such selectivity. For this reason, we have performed photoaffinity labeling studies of EF-2 from the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans, using a radiolabeled sordarin derivative. Elongation factor 2 and salt-washed ribosomes were isolated fromC. albicans 2005E as previously described (5Domı́nguez J.M. Martı́n J.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 2279-2283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EF-2 concentration was determined spectrophotometrically usingE 280 = 67310m−1·cm−1 as deduced from its amino acid sequence (Swiss-Prot O13430). Ribosome concentration was also calculated spectrophotometrically assuming oneA 260 unit corresponds to 18 pmol of ribosomes (22Spedding G. Ribosomes and Protein Synthesis: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1990: 1-29Google Scholar). [14C]GM258383 (1.8 GBq/mmol) and [3H]sordarin (180 GBq/mmol) were prepared by the Isotope Chemistry Group at GlaxoSmithKline Medicines Research Center (Stevenage, United Kingdom). Non-radiolabeled sordarin derivatives were prepared by the Medicinal Chemistry Unit at GlaxoSmithKline S.A. (Tres Cantos, Spain). Sephadex G-25 (PD-10 columns) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). All other chemicals were from Sigma Chemical Co. Binding of [3H]sordarin to EF-2 alone or to equimolar mixtures of EF-2 and ribosomes was studied by equilibrium dialysis using microvolumetric dialysis capsules (Cellu Sep, San Antonio, TX). The two chambers of each capsule were separated by dialysis membrane with a cutoff of 6 kDa. One chamber was filled with 150 µl of [3H]sordarin at appropriate concentration in 25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 85 mmpotassium acetate, 4 mm magnesium acetate, and 1.5 mmdl-dithiothreitol. The other chamber was filled with the same solution containing either 3.6 µmEF-2 or 333 nm EF-2, 333 nm ribosomes, and 33.3 µm Gpp(NH)p. Samples were incubated overnight at 30 °C under rotary shaking. Finally, duplicate 50-µl aliquots were withdrawn from each chamber, and their radioactivity was measured. Free sordarin was calculated from radioactivity values of the first capsule chamber, whereas bound sordarin was calculated by subtracting the latter from each corresponding value of the second capsule chamber. The reaction was performed in Eppendorf tubes containing 50 µl of 20 µm EF-2 in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 200 µm EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol and the appropriate amount of [14C]GM258383. After preincubating for 15 min at 25 °C in the dark, samples were placed on ice and irradiated at 254 nm with an UV lamp (2000 microwatts/cm2). Further sample processing was dependent on the aim of the experiment. For quantification purposes, samples were denatured by adding 150 µl of 8 mguanidine chloride followed by 5 min of heating at 80 °C. Then, free drug was removed by gel filtration through Sephadex G-25, and the extension of covalent labeling was determined by liquid scintillation counting. For other purposes samples were processed as opportunely described. Photolabeling of EF-2 was performed as described above using 100 µm[14C]GM258383 and 10-min UV-irradiation. Gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 was then used to remove drug excess and to exchange buffer to 100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 5.0. Further reduction and alkylation with 4-vinylpyridine, trypsin digestion, and reverse-phase HPLC were performed according to established methods (23Lottspeich F. Microcharacterization of Proteins. VCH, Weinheim1994: 11-130Crossref Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences were determined with an Applied Biosystems pulse-liquid sequencer model 477A connected on-line to a reverse-phase HPLC unit for identification of the stepwise released phenylthiohydantoin-amino acids. Mass determinations were performed with a Bruker Biflex III MALDI time of flight mass spectrometer. These analysis were done by Eurosequence b.v. (Groningen, The Netherlands). GM258383, the photoactivatable aryl azide sordarin derivative used in the present work (see structure in Fig.1), inhibits protein synthesis inC. albicans cell-free systems (IC50 = 2 µm, determined as in Ref. 20Domı́nguez J.M. Kelly V.A. Kinsman O.S. Marriott M.S.,. Gómez de las Heras F. Martı́n J.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 2274-2278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This biological activity makes GM258383 appropriate for studies intended to identify sordarin binding site. Ideally, this photoprobe was intended to label the ribosome·EF-2 complex, because this is considered the functional target of sordarin. However, the spectral properties of GM258383 (maximum absorption at 260 nm and no absorption at wavelengths longer than 300 nm) are almost identical to those of ribosomes; consequently, photoactivation of the probe is quenched by the inner filter effect of ribosomes. Indeed, all efforts to photolabel mixtures of ribosomes and EF-2 were unsuccessful (data not shown). Therefore, labeling experiments were carried out with EF-2 alone. To characterize the binding of sordarin to its target we have performed equilibrium dialysis experiments with [3H]sordarin and either EF-2 alone or equimolar mixtures of EF-2 and ribosomes in the presence of a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog, i.e. Gpp(NH)p (Fig. 2). Sordarin binding to EF-2 alone showed saturation, the Scatchard plot corresponding to that of one single class of binding sites (Fig. 2 A). Fitting the experimental points to a single hyperbola yielded K d= 1.26 µm. This indicates that sordarin binds to EF-2 in a specific manner to a defined binding site within the EF-2 molecule and hence supports performing photoaffinity labeling with EF-2 alone. This affinity, similar to that described for rat liver EF-2 and its natural substrate GTP (K d = 3.0 µm) (24Sontag B. Reboud A.M. Divita G. Di Pietro A. Guillot D. Reboud J.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1976-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), seems to be high enough to reduce the risk of nonspecific labeling (25King S.M. Kim H. Haley B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 449-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 26Kotzyba-Hibert F. Kapfer I. Goeldner M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995; 34: 1296-1312Crossref Scopus (388) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the presence of ribosomes unveils two classes of binding sites with higher affinity, as deduced from the Scatchard plot (Fig. 2 B). K d values for these two sites (calculated from data fitting to a double hyperbola) were 0.7 and 41.5 nm. These values are far apart with respect to the value with EF-2 alone and might be indicative of the presence of two populations of ribosomes (pre- and post-translocated) in agreement with our previous observations (4Domı́nguez J.M. Gómez-Lorenzo M.G. Martı́n J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22423-22427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The affinity increase may result from conformational changes within EF-2 upon interaction with the ribosome rather than from the creation of a new site in EF-2, because the latter seems unlikely in view of the already notable affinity shown by EF-2 alone. The possibility of a combined binding site in the interface between ribosome and EF-2 cannot be ruled out either. Interestingly, it has been recently shown that the sordarin derivative GM193663 increases the reactivity of 26 S rRNA inSaccharomyces cerevisiae ribosomes, most notably affecting to the sarcin-ricin loop, which becomes more exposed (27Briones C. Ballesta J.P.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4497-4505Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The use of aryl azides (such as GM258383) in photoaffinity labeling is widespread. Nevertheless, the long lifetime of the reactive intermediate has been deemed a serious caveat that may lead to nonspecific labeling (28Chowdhry V. Westheimer F.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 293-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Fig.3 A shows EF-2 photolabeling with [14C]GM258383 at different irradiation times. Labeling followed pseudo-first order kinetics withk obs of 0.215 min−1 and was quantitatively completed after 10 min. When EF-2 was irradiated in the presence of increasing concentrations of [14C]GM258383, a hyperbolic saturation curve was obtained (Fig. 3 B), with maximum incorporation at 0.39 mol/mol EF-2. The most convincing result to support the specificity of photolabeling with [14C]GM258383 is presented in Fig. 3 C, where it is demonstrated that sordarin derivative GM193663 prevented photolabeling in a dose-dependent manner, so that incorporation of the photoprobe was completely precluded in the presence of high concentrations of GM193663 (Fig.4, lane 3). On the other hand, when the reaction mixture was not irradiated at 254 nm no labeling was detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography (Fig. 4, lane 4). In all, it is proved that GM258383 is covalently bound to a EF-2 sordarin binding site as a result of a photoactivatable process.Figure 4Fluorography of samples from EF-2 photolabeling. 20 µm EF-2 was incubated with 100 µm [14C]GM258383 and either not exposed to UV light (lane 4) or UV-irradiated for 10 min in the presence (lane 3) or absence (lane 2) of 10 mm GM193663. Samples were then diluted 20-fold with denaturing electrophoresis sample buffer, and 5 µl was loaded on a 10% acrylamide gel. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was run the gel was dried and subjected to fluorography. Lanes 1and 5, molecular weight markers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To identify the EF-2 residue modified by [14C]GM258383, photolabeled EF-2 was digested with trypsin and the resulting peptide mixture was resolved by reverse-phase HPLC (Fig.5). Five fractions (named “A” to “E”) showed significant radioactive levels, which accounted for more than 60% of the total. Besides, there is a spurious trail of radioactivity at the end of the chromatogram, which is not associated with UV peaks at 214, 254, 280, or 297 nm; hence, it might be attributed to traces of free decomposed radioligand. Fraction A was further purified by HPLC (Fig.6) and yielded two radioactive peaks, “A1” and “A2.” Sequence analysis of these two peaks, by Edman degradation, rendered uFANxYSK (peak A1; where “u” denotes no unambiguous assignment and “x” denotes no detection) and FANxYSKK (peak A2). MALDI-MS of peak A1 rendered a signal atm/z = 1437 (MH+), which could be attributable to the mass of the peptide QFANKYSK (986 Da) plus an added mass of 450 Da corresponding exactly to the expected mass increase due to the linked photoprobe (Fig. 7). Likewise, MALDI-MS of peak A2 gave a signal atm/z = 1437 (MH+), attributable to the mass of FANKYSKK (986 Da) plus the photoprobe. Such sequences correspond to the fragment Gln224–Lys232within the C. albicans EF-2 sequence, Lys228being the modified residue. Modification of this lysine residue, which explains that trypsin did not cleave at this position and that the residue was not identified after Edman degradation, is the result of one of the mechanisms described for the photochemistry of aryl azides. As depicted in Fig. 7, it proceeds via triplet nitrene, leading to abstraction of a hydrogen radical from the protein and further combination of the newly formed radicals to yield the covalent bond. The hydrogen radical is preferably abstracted from a carbon atom adjacent to heteroatoms of the amino acid side chain, as is the case of Cε in Lys (26Kotzyba-Hibert F. Kapfer I. Goeldner M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995; 34: 1296-1312Crossref Scopus (388) Google Scholar).Figure 6Purification of fraction A. Fraction A from the first HPLC run (Fig. 5) was subjected to re-chromatography on the same column using a linear gradient of 0–90% acetonitrile in 0.05% (w/v) ammonium acetate, pH 6.0, during 120 min at 0.35 ml/min. Fractions were collected for different intervals and one-third of their volume was used for radioactivity counting by liquid scintillation.A, UV profile of the column eluate; arrows denote positions of the peaks that were selected according to the content of radioactivity. B, radioactivity expressed as total cpm in each of the collected fractions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 7Reactions involved in EF-2 photolabeling with [14C]GM258383. Reactions are inferred from the experimental results of this paper, according to the photochemistry of aryl azides described in Ref. 26Kotzyba-Hibert F. Kapfer I. Goeldner M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995; 34: 1296-1312Crossref Scopus (388) Google Scholar.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The same procedure was followed with fraction B. Further chromatography yielded a single radioactive peak (Fig.8). No sequence could be obtained from Edman degradation of this peak. However, MALDI-MS revealed one signal at m/z = 1419 (MH+) attributable to the mass of qFANKYSK (968 Da; where “q” is pyroglutamic acid) plus the mass of the photoprobe (450 Da). Transformation of Gln into Glu and subsequent lactam formation blocked the N terminus of the peptide, thus preventing Edman degradation. Finally, when the rest of the radioactive peaks were analyzed in the same form, either no radioactivity was detected in the re-chromatography, or no sequence nor MS results were obtained. This suggests that these peaks might correspond to modified peptides present in scarce amounts. The modified Lys228 is located in the G-domain (also called domain I) of EF-2, more precisely at the beginning of the insert called G“-subdomain. The analog insert in bacterial EF-G (called the G′-subdomain) is located before the G5 motif, between helix DG and strand 6G (see Ref.9). However, in eukaryotic EF-2, the insert is longer and placed after the G5 motif. Because this G”-subdomain is involved in sordarin binding, such differences between G“- and G′-subdomains can play a role in determining the innocuousness of sordarins on bacterial protein synthesis. Fig. 9 shows the alignment of the G“-subdomains from all EF-2 sequences presently available. It is noteworthy that such a subdomain is longer in EF-2 from higher animals than in the rest of eukaryotic species due to a 13-residue fragment located at the beginning of the subdomain. More remarkable is the existence of two putative Walker motifs (29Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar), with Walker-A being present only in this group of species. Recently, Gonzalo et al. (30Gonzalo P. Sontag B. Lavergne J.P. Jault J.M. Reboud J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13558-13564Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) identified in rat liver EF-2 a second nucleotide binding site specific for ATP, which may probably involve these additional Walker motifs. Although the underlying physiological function is not known, these observations show that, despite the high homology, significant differences exist in G”-subdomains among species. Thus, the high selectivity of sordarin toward one such set of species (the fungi) appears less surprising. The G“-subdomain is thought to directly interact with the sarcin-ricin loop of 26 S rRNA in fungi. The peptide identified in this work is very close to Trp218, an essential residue in the interaction with the loop (31Guillot D. Lavergne J.P. Reboud J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26082-26084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Putting together these observations with the above-mentioned effect of GM193663 on S. cerevisiae 26 S rRNA (27Briones C. Ballesta J.P.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4497-4505Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), the hypothesis of a combined binding site between ribosome and EF-2 becomes more plausible. This in turn opens the possibility that differences among ribosomes also contribute significantly to sordarin specificity. In a previous paper, a theoretical three-dimensional model for S. cerevisiae EF-2 was presented (32Capa L. Mendoza A. Lavandera J.L. Gómez de las Heras F. Garcı́a-Bustos J.F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 2694-2699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The model was built from homology mapping of EF-2 onto the crystal structure ofThermus thermophilus EF-G. In this model a sordarin binding site was proposed based on the position of the mutations conferring resistance to sordarin: 9 of 14 mutated residues (32Capa L. Mendoza A. Lavandera J.L. Gómez de las Heras F. Garcı́a-Bustos J.F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 2694-2699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Cook N.D. Drug Discov. Today. 2000; 1: 287-294Crossref Scopus (141) Google Scholar) mapped closely on domain III, defining a possible binding pocket. Accordingly, Shastry et al. (21Shastry M. Nielsen J. Ku T. Hsu M.J. Liberator P. Anderson J. Schmatz D. Justice M.C. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have recently shown in this domain a block of eight amino acids (corresponding to residues 517–524 inS. cerevisiae EF-2) that may define a sordarin specificity region in natural fungal species. We have not made use of this three-dimensional model, because the photolabeled peptide is included in the G“-subdomain, which is not present in the template EF-G molecule, and hence the accuracy of the model may not suffice for our purposes. Nevertheless, it is obvious that the putative binding region deduced from our studies is far from the pocket predicted from these resistant mutations. Recent studies strongly suggest that domain III is closely related to the G-domain both structurally and functionally. It seems to influence the GTP binding center (34Martemyanov K.A. Gudkov A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35820-35824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and to participate in the transmission of conformational rearrangements from the G-domain to domain IV after GTP hydrolysis (35Wilson K.S. Noller H.F. Cell. 1998; 92: 131-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Therefore, these mutations in EF-2 may help to overcome the effect of the drug by affecting EF-2 function rather than sordarin binding to EF-2 alone, thus precluding the transition to a high affinity sordarin binding complex upon interaction with the ribosome. On the other hand, there are five more sordarin-resistant mutations out of domain III, two of them located near the photolabeled peptide (6Justice M.C. Hsu M.J. Tse B. Ku T. Balkovec J. Schmatz D. Nielsen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3148-3151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In summary, the results presented in this paper may contribute to the sordarin mode of action. In any case, studies designed to afford a more detailed definition of the molecular effects of this drug at ribosomal level are still needed. We thank Dr. H. J. Bak and Dr. W. J. Weijer (Eurosequence b.v.) for their excellent work, and M. Nieto, R. Sarabia, and A. Monjo for their assistance."

By introducing single 2′-5′ phosphodiesters in lieu of a standard 3′-5′ phosphodiester linkage, we illuminate the contributions of phosphodiester connectivity to DNA transesterification. We find that the DNA cleavage reaction was slowed by more than six orders of magnitude when a 2′-5′ linkage was present at the scissile phosphodiester (CCCTT2′p↓5′A). Thus, vaccinia topoisomerase is unable to form a DNA-(2′-phosphotyrosyl)-enzyme intermediate. We hypothesize that the altered geometry of the 2′-5′ phosphodiester limits the ability of the tyrosine nucleophile to attain a requisite, presumably apical orientation with respect to the 5′-OH leaving group. A 2′-5′ phosphodiester located to the 3′ side of the cleavage site (CCCTTp↓N2′p5′N) reduced the rate of transesterification by a factor of 500. In contrast, 2′-5′ phosphodiesters at four other sites in the scissile strand (TpCGCCCTpT↓ATpTpC) and five positions in the nonscissile strand (3′-GGGpApApTpApA) had no effect on transesterification rate. The DNAs containing 2′-5′ phosphodiesters were protected from digestion by exonuclease III. We found that exonuclease III was consistently arrested at positions 1 and 2 nucleotides prior to the encounter of its active site with the modified 2′-5′ phosphodiester and that the 2′-5′ linkage itself was poorly hydrolyzed by exonuclease III.

Type IB topoisomerases modulate the topological state of DNA by cleaving and rejoining one strand of the DNA duplex. Cleavage is a transesterification reaction in which the scissile Np↓N phosphodiester is attacked by a tyrosine of the enzyme, resulting in the formation of a DNA-(3′-phosphotyrosyl)enzyme intermediate and the expulsion of a DNA strand having a 5′-OH terminus. In the religation step, the DNA 5′-OH group attacks the covalent intermediate resulting in expulsion of the active site tyrosine and restoration of the DNA phosphodiester backbone. Vaccinia topoisomerase is a prototype of the type IB topoisomerase family (1Shuman S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 321-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The poxvirus enzyme is distinguished from the nuclear topoisomerase I by its compact size (314 amino acids) and its site-specificity in DNA transesterification. Vaccinia topoisomerase binds and cleaves duplex DNA at a pentapyrimidine target sequence 5′-(T/C)CCTT↓. The Tp↓ nucleotide (defined as the +1 nucleotide) is linked to Tyr-274 of the enzyme. The stereochemical outcome of the net cleavage-religation reaction of vaccinia topoisomerase is a retention of configuration at the scissile phosphodiester. This suggests that the component cleavage and religation reactions entail in-line SN2-type displacements in which the attacking nucleophile is apical to the leaving group and each transesterification results in an inversion of configuration (2Stivers J.T. Jagadeesh G.J. Nawrot B. Stec W.J. Shuman S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5561-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Four conserved amino acid side chains of vaccinia topoisomerase (Arg-130, Lys-167, Arg-223, and His-265) are required for catalysis (3Wittschieben J. Shuman S.

Type IB topoisomerases engage the DNA target site circumferentially, forming a C-shaped clamp around the duplex (6Cheng C. Kussie P. Pavletich N. Shuman S.

The DNA moieties that contribute to target site recognition and enable catalysis by vaccinia topoisomerase have been examined using synthetic substrates containing a single CCCTT site. Modification interference, modification protection, base and sugar analog substitution, and UV cross-linking experiments indicate that vaccinia topoisomerase makes contact with specific bases and phosphates of DNA in the vicinity of the CCCTT element (9Sekiguchi J.

For example, dimethyl sulfate protection and interference experiments revealed interactions with the three guanine bases of the pentamer motif complementary strand (3′-GGGAA) (10Shuman S. Turner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18943-18950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and permanganate oxidation interference highlighted a functional interaction with the +2T base of the scissile strand (CCCTT) (12Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19436-19442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Functionally relevant phosphates were initially identified by studying the effects of phosphate ethylation on topoisomerase binding (9Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31731-31734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ethylation of the +1, +2, +3, and +4 phosphates on the scissile strand (positions CpCpTpTp↓ within the pentamer motif) and the +3, +4, and +5 phosphates on the nonscissile strand (3′-GpGpGpA) interfered with topoisomerase-DNA complex formation. The relevant topoisomerase-phosphate contacts are arrayed across the minor groove of the DNA helix (9Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31731-31734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphate ethylation is a relatively crude modification interference method, insofar as it simultaneously eliminates the negative charge on the phosphate and introduces a bulky aliphatic group. Subsequent studies of the catalytic contributions of individual phosphates have entailed less drastic modifications, for example replacing the standard 3′-5′ phosphodiester by a 3′-OH/5′-PO4 nick (13Cheng C. Shuman S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16599-16612Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This modification interrupts the DNA backbone and introduces additional negative charge (net charge of about −1.5 at pH 7.0 at the nick versus −1.0 for the phosphodiester) but adds only minimal bulk (one extra oxygen). A 3′-OH/5′-PO4 nick in lieu of the scissile phosphodiester abolished transesterification by vaccinia topoisomerase, but did not affect the noncovalent binding of topoisomerase to the nicked DNA (13Cheng C. Shuman S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16599-16612Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This result indicated that vaccinia topoisomerase is an obligate nucleotidyl-3′-phosphotransferase that cannot transesterify to a 5′ phosphomonoester. Placement of a 3′-OH/5′-PO4 nick at position +2 (CCCTpTp↓) slowed the rate of transesterification by a factor of 500. A “missing phosphate” analysis of the DNA target site entailed replacement of phosphodiesters with a 3′-OH/5′-OH nick, a maneuver that eliminates one negative charge along with potential hydrogen bonding interactions between the topoisomerase and the nonbridging phosphate oxygens. This interference method revealed a contribution of the −1 phosphate of the scissile strand (CCCTTp↓NpN), which enhances the rate of transesterification by a factor of 40 (13). Here we present a more subtle modification interference analysis in which we investigate the positional effects of introducing single 2′-5′ phosphodiesters in lieu of a standard 3′-5′ phosphodiester linkage (14Arslan T. Abraham A.T. Hecht S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12383-12390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar,15Arslan T. Abraham A.T. Hecht S.M. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1998; 17: 515-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This approach imposes no alteration in net charge or size of the phosphate moiety and is better suited than previous modification methods to dissect the role of phosphate orientation in site recognition and transesterification chemistry. The instructive findings are that vaccinia topoisomerase is insensitive to single 2′-5′ phosphodiester modifications, with two exceptions: the rate of single-turnover transesterification is suppressed by six orders of magnitude by a 2′-5′ substitution for the scissile phosphodiester (CCCTT2′ p↓5′N) and by a factor of 500 by 2′-5′ modification of the −1 phosphate (CCCTT↓N2′ p 5′N). Vaccinia topoisomerase displays a more stringent requirement for natural phosphodiester geometry at the cleavage site than mammalian topoisomerase I. Modified oligonucleotides containing a single 2′-5′ phosphodiester bond were synthesized as described (14Arslan T. Abraham A.T. Hecht S.M. J. Biol.

Unmodified oligonucleotides were purchased fromBIOSOURCE International. Recombinant vaccinia topoisomerase was produced in Escherichia coli(BL21) by infection with bacteriophage λCE6 and then purified from the soluble bacterial lysate by phosphocellulose chromatography as described previously (18Shuman S. Golder M. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16401-16407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Standard or 2′-5′ modified 18-mer scissile strands d(CGTGTCGCCCTTATTCCC) were 5′ 32P-labeled by enzymatic phosphorylation in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled oligonucleotides were gel-purified and hybridized to standard or 2′-5′ modified 30-mer oligonucleotides d(TGTAGTCTATCGGAATAAGGGCGACACG) at a 1:4 molar ratio of 18-mer to 30-mer. Transesterification reactions containing (per 20 μl) 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 pmol 18-mer/30-mer DNA, and 75, 150, or 300 ng of vaccinia topoisomerase were incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots (20 μl) were withdrawn at the times specified and quenched immediately with SDS (1% final concentration). The products were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS. Free DNA migrated near the dye front. Covalent complex formation was revealed by transfer of radiolabeled DNA to the topoisomerase polypeptide. The extent of covalent adduct formation was quantified by scanning the dried gel using a Fujix BAS2500 Phosphorimager. A plot of the percentage of input DNA cleaved versus time established the end point values for cleavage. The data were then normalized to the end point value (defined as 100%), and the cleavage rate constants (k obs) were calculated by fitting the normalized data to the equation 100 − %cleavage(norm) = 100e−kt. The values of k obs at the saturating level of input topoisomerase (either 75 or 150 ng) and the actual end point cleavage values are listed in Tables I and II.Table IEffect of single 2′–5′ phosphodiesters on DNA cleavage by vaccinia topoisomerasePosition of 2′–5′ modificationKinetic data18-mer30-merk obs(s −1)% cleavagenonenone0.3090−3P−0.3381−2P−0.3687−1P−0.000621-aSignificant rate decrement.87+1P−<1 × 10−7 1-aSignificant rate decrement.+2P−0.2388+8P−0.3193none−2P0.4484−−1P0.3384−+1P0.4188−+2P0.2685−+3P0.35871-a Significant rate decrement.

Open table in a new tab Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 pmol of standard or 2′-5′ modified 18-mer/30-mer DNA, and 75 ng of vaccinia topoisomerase were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. A mixture containing DNA modified at −1 phosphodiester on the 18-mer was incubated for 240 min at 37 °C. The reactions were quenched with 1% SDS. Half of the sample was digested for 2 h at 37 °C with 10 μg of proteinase K and the other half was not digested. The mixtures were adjusted to 47% formamide, heat-denatured, and electrophoresed through a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in TBE (90 mm Tris-borate, 2.5 mm EDTA). The reaction products were visualized by autoradiographic exposure of the gel. 5′ 32P-labeled standard and 2′-5′ modified oligonucleotides were hybridized to complementary 60-mer DNAs at a 1:4 molar ratio of labeled strand to 60-mer. Exonuclease III reaction mixtures (90 μl) containing 66 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.66 mmMgCl2, 3 pmol of 18-mer/60-mer or 30-mer/60-mer DNA, and 2.5 units of E. coli exonuclease III (New England Biolabs) were incubated at 22 °C. Aliquots (10 μl) were withdrawn at the times specified and quenched by adding EDTA to 30 mm final concentration. The samples were adjusted to 47% formamide, heat-denatured, and electrophoresed through a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in TBE. The reaction products were visualized by autoradiographic exposure of the gel. A series of 18-mer scissile strands containing a single 2′-5′ phosphodiester at positions +8, +2, +1, −1, −2, and −3 were 5′ 32P-labeled and annealed to an unlabeled 30-mer strand to form a “suicide” substrate for vaccinia topoisomerase (Fig. 1). Cleavage results in covalent attachment of a 5′ 32P-labeled 12-mer (5′-pCGTGTCGCCCTTp) to the enzyme via Tyr-274. The unlabeled 6-mer leaving strand 5′ HOATTCCC dissociates spontaneously from the protein-DNA complex. Loss of the leaving strand drives the reaction toward the covalent state. The reaction of topoisomerase with the unmodified control substrate attained an end point of 90% covalent adduct formation, and the reaction was completed within 20 s (Fig. 1). The extent of transesterification after 5 s was 80% of the end point value. From this datum, we calculated a single-turnover cleavage rate constant of 0.3 s−1 (Table I). Introduction of a 2′-5′ phosphodiester at positions +8, +2, −2, or −3 had no significant effect on the reaction end point or the cleavage rate constant (Table I). In contrast, a 2′-5′ phosphodiester at position −1 reduced the rate of transesterification by a factor of 500 (k obs = 6.2 × 10−4s−1) (Fig. 1, Table I). The k obsfor the −1 modified substrate did not increase when the concentration of topoisomerase in the reaction mixture was increased 2-fold (not shown). This indicated that the slowed cleavage rate was not caused by a defect in the initial binding of topoisomerase to the substrate. Placement of a 2′-5′ phosphodiester directly at the cleavage site virtually abrogated the transesterification reaction. A mere 3% of the input DNA was cleaved after a 6-day reaction of topoisomerase with the +1 modified substrate (not shown). Although an end point was clearly not attained, we calculated an initial rate of cleavage of the +1 modified strand of 4.2 × 10−6 % s−1. This value reflects a rate decrement of at least 10−6.5compared with the initial rate of cleavage of the unmodified control DNA. Thus we can estimate that cleavage rate constant for the +1 modified substrate was <1 × 10−7s−1. To address whether the 2′-5′ phosphodiester substitutions altered the site of cleavage within the 18-mer scissile strand, the reaction products were digested with proteinase K in the presence of SDS to remove the covalently linked topoisomerase. The radiolabeled DNA reaction products were then analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). Reaction of topoisomerase with the unmodified control substrate resulted in the appearance of a cluster of radiolabeled species migrating faster than the input 32P-labeled 18-mer strand but slower than a free32P-labeled 12-mer 5′-pCGTGTCGCCCTTp. (The free 12-mer was generated by peroxidolysis of the covalent topoisomerase-DNA intermediate, Ref. 19Krogh B.O. Shuman S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6422-6432Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar.) The cluster consists of the 12-mer 5′-pCGTGTCGCCCTTp linked to one or more amino acids of the topoisomerase. Detection of the covalent oligonucleotide-peptide complex was completely dependent on prior digestion of the sample with proteinase K (Fig. 2). This is because the labeled DNA does not migrate into the polyacrylamide gel when it is bound covalently to the topoisomerase polypeptide. The instructive finding was that the same cluster was produced by proteinase K digestion of the covalent adduct formed by topoisomerase on the scissile strands containing 2′-5′ phosphodiesters at positions −3, −2, −1, and +2 (Fig. 2). Thus, the site of covalent adduct formation was unchanged by the modifications. Any shift in the cleavage site, and hence the size of the covalently bound oligonucleotide, would have been readily detected by an altered mobility of the labeled oligonucleotide-peptide adducts. Additional experiments verified that the +8 modification also had no effect on the site of cleavage (not shown). A series of 30-mer nonscissile strands containing a single 2′-5′ phosphodiester at positions +3, +2, +1, −1, and −2 were annealed to the unmodified 5′ 32P-labeled 18-mer scissile strand (Fig. 1). None of these 2′-5′ phosphodiester modifications had a significant effect on the reaction end point or the cleavage rate constant (Table I). The modifications of the nonscissile strand did not alter the site of cleavage within the 18-mer scissile strand (not shown). A series of doubly modified substrates containing one 2′-5′ phosphodiester in the scissile strand and one 2′-5′ phosphodiester in the nonscissile strand was prepared by annealing the modified 32P-labeled 18-mer strands to each of the modified unlabeled 30-mer strands. The substrate combinations and the results of the analysis of transesterification kinetics are shown in Table II. We found that the modifications of the −3 and −2 positions of the scissile strand, which by themselves had no deleterious effect on transesterification, also had no significant effect on the rate of cleavage when combined with any of the five singly substituted complementary strands. (Our operational definition of a significant effect is one that elicits at least a 4-fold change ink obs.) In contrast, the +2 modification of the scissile strand, which also had no deleterious effect per se, was inhibitory when combined with 2′-5′ phosphodiester modifications on the complementary strand that were also benign by themselves (Table II). A hierarchy of synergistic effects was evident, whereby “cross-strand” combination with a 2′-5′ phosphodiester at position +2 on the nonscissile strand elicited a 100-fold decrement in cleavage rate (k obs = 0.002 s−1), combination with modifications at −1 (k obs = 0.02 s−1) or +3 (k obs = 0.013 s−1) resulted in an order of magnitude rate decrement, and combination with a 2′-5′ linkage at +1 slowed cleavage by a factor of 4 (k obs = 0.051 s−1). The already severe negative effect of the 2′-5′ phosphodiester at position −1 of the scissile strand (k obs = 6.2 × 10−4 s−1) was exacerbated by a factor of 8 in combination with 2′-5′ phosphodiesters at positions −1 or +2 on the complementary strand (k obs = 7.5 × 10−5 s−1) (Table II). Other modifications of the nonscissile strand did not have a significant impact on cleavage of the −1 modified 18-mer. E. coli exonuclease III catalyzes unidirectional digestion of duplex DNA from the 3′-end to liberate 5′ dNMP products. The phosphodiesterase activity of exonuclease III is impeded by chemical modifications of the phosphate backbone (20Putney S.D. Benkovic S.J. Schimmel P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7350-7354Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 21Porter K.W. Briley J.D. Shaw B.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1611-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), including the 2′-5′ phosphodiester modification studied here (14Arslan T. Abraham A.T. Hecht S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12383-12390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 15Arslan T. Abraham A.T. Hecht S.M. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1998; 17: 515-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To confirm the incorporation of the 2′-5′ phosphodiesters during chemical synthesis of the topoisomerase substrate strands and further explore the effects of this modification on the phosphodiesterase activity of exonuclease III, we annealed the 5′ 32P-labeled 30-mers containing the complement of the topoisomerase cleavage site to a complementary 60-mer strand and incubated the duplexes with exonuclease III. The 5′-labeled digestion products were resolved by denaturing gel electrophoresis (Fig.3). All of the unmodified 30-mer was converted after 15–30 min to 5′-labeled species 8–10 nucleotides in length. A ladder of partially digested strands was evident at 5 min. Introduction of a 2′-5′ phosphodiester at position −2 resulted in a kinetic roadblock to exonuclease III digestion located 1 nucleotide 3′ of the site of the modification (−A2′p5′ApT). The paused species persisted at 30 min and was only slowly converted to a species arrested at the site of modification (−A2′p5′A). There was almost no digestion of the 32P-labeled DNA past this point. Changing the position of the 2′-5′ phosphodiester modification elicited a corresponding shift in the site of the impediment to exonuclease III digestion (Fig. 3). In the case of the +1 phosphate modification, the progress of exonuclease III was arrested after 5 min at points 1 and 2 nucleotides 3′ of the modified phosphate. After 15 and 30 min, the major products were arrested at the site of modification and 1 nucleotide upstream and only a minority of the DNA strands were degraded past the modified phosphodiester. The upstream block to digestion was apparent, but less pronounced, on the −1 phosphate-modified strand, so that most of the DNA was digested up to the site of the 2′-5′ phosphodiester and no further (Fig. 3). The 5′ 32P-labeled 18-mers containing the CCCTT topoisomerase cleavage site were also annealed to a complementary 60-mer strand and digested with exonuclease III (Fig.4). Here again, the 2′-5′ modifications arrest exonuclease III at sites 1 and 2 nucleotides 3′ of the modified phosphodiester and, as the reaction proceeds, at the modified phosphodiester itself. These results indicate that exonuclease III can sense the conformation of the DNA backbone in advance of the position of its active site. The rate of DNA transesterification by vaccinia topoisomerase was reduced by more than six orders of magnitude by a 2′-5′ linkage at the scissile phosphodiester (CCCTT2′ p↓5′N). Thus, vaccinia topoisomerase is essentially unable to form a DNA-(2′-phosphotyrosyl)-enzyme intermediate. The 2′-5′ modification is relatively subtle because it does not alter the charge on the scissile phosphate or introduce bulk. We hypothesize that the altered geometry of the 2′-5′ phosphodiester limits the ability of the nucleophile Tyr-274 to attain its requisite apical orientation with respect to the 5′-OH leaving group. Additional perturbations of contacts of the phosphate oxygens with the catalytic Arg-130, Arg-223, His-265, and Lys-167 side chains in the ground state or the transition state may also contribute to the inability of the poxvirus enzyme to cleave the 2′-5′ phosphodiester. Arslan et al. (14Arslan T. Abraham A.T. Hecht S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12383-12390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 15Arslan T. Abraham A.T. Hecht S.M. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1998; 17: 515-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) showed that mammalian topoisomerase I is quite capable of cleaving a 2′-5′ phosphodiester to form a DNA-(2′-phosphotyrosyl)-enzyme intermediate, although the extent of the reaction at the modified phosphodiester was reduced because the enzyme was diverted to an alternative (unmodified) cleavage site 2 nucleotides upstream. Apparently, the active site of the mammalian type IB topoisomerase is better able to accommodate the altered geometry of a 2′-5′ phosphodiester. Note that the mammalian enzyme is also much less fastidious than the vaccinia topoisomerase with respect to the nucleotide sequence at the cleavage site. The cellular and poxvirus topoisomerases have a common fold and the same constellation of catalytic side chains (6Cheng C. Kussie P. Pavletich N. Shuman S. Cell. 1998; 92: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 7Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar), but the structural nuances that account for the greater stringency of the poxvirus topoisomerase active site are entirely uncharted. A 2′-5′ modification of the −1 phosphate (CCCTTp↓N2′ p 5′N) reduced the rate of transesterification by vaccinia topoisomerase by a factor of 500. This effect was an order of magnitude more deleterious than simply removing the −1 phosphate and replacing it by a 3′-OH/5′-OH nick (13Cheng C. Shuman S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16599-16612Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We infer that the 2′-5′ modification interference is not caused solely by a perturbation of functional contacts between the topoisomerase and the −1 phosphate. Rather, we invoke an additional effect of the unconventional 2′-5′ linkage on the conformation of either the adjacent −2 nucleoside (CCCTTp↓A2′ p 5′ T) or the −1 nucleoside (CCCTTp↓A 2′ p 5′T) or both. Note that removal of the −1 phosphate plus the −2T nucleoside reduces the cleavage rate by three orders of magnitude (13Cheng C. Shuman S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16599-16612Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which is similar to the effect elicited by the 2′-5′ modification of the −1 phosphate. It is also conceivable that a 2′-5′ modification of the −1 phosphate affects the conformation of the adjacent (unmodified) scissile phosphodiester in such a way as to make it unfavorable for transesterification chemistry. Mammalian topoisomerase I also displays profound interference of cleavage by a 2′-5′ phosphodiester immediately 3′ of the cleavage site (14Arslan T. Abraham A.T. Hecht S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12383-12390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 15Arslan T. Abraham A.T. Hecht S.M. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1998; 17: 515-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). A 2′-5′ modification of the +2 phosphate (CCCT2′ p 5Tp↓N) had no effect on vaccinia topoisomerase. This result was remarkable, given that the introduction of a 3′-OH/5′-PO4 nick at the +2 position slowed the rate of cleavage by a factor of 500 (13Cheng C. Shuman S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16599-16612Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, a modification that preserves the electrostatics on the +2 phosphate and the continuity of the backbone is benign compared to one that breaks the backbone and imposes an extra negative charge. Covalent intermediate formation was also suppressed by introduction of a single 2′-O-methyl moiety on the +2 sugar (10Shuman S. Turner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18943-18950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apparently, the combination of a 2′-OMe with the standard 3′-5′ phosphodiester was more detrimental than substitution of the 2′ carbon (as a phosphate ester) in the context of a 3′ deoxy sugar. In the crystal structure of vaccinia topoisomerase, the side chains of Arg-84, Ser-268, and Ser-270 coordinate a sulfate proposed to correspond to the +2 phosphate of the scissile strand (6Cheng C. Kussie P. Pavletich N. Shuman S. Cell. 1998; 92: 841-850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In the mammalian topoisomerase-DNA cocrystal (7Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar), the +2 phosphate interacts with Lys-433, which is the mammalian counterpart of vaccinia Arg-84. Mammalian topoisomerase I is also unaffected by a 2′-5′ linkage immediately 5′ of the cleavage site. Thus, the relevant contacts to the +2 phosphate appear not to be disrupted by the 2′-5′ phosphodiester. Single modifications at five phosphodiesters on the nonscissile strand had no significant effect on transesterification by vaccinia topoisomerase. However, some of the nonscissile strand modifications were inhibitory in concert with a 2′-5′ phosphodiester at positions +2 or −1 on the scissile strand. Indeed, modification of the −1 or +2 phosphodiesters of the nonscissile strand elicited 10-fold synergistic effects in combination with scissile strands containing either +2 or −1 phosphate modifications. The most severe synergistic effect (100-fold) was observed with 2′-5′ modifications at the +2 positions of both DNA strands. Insofar as the observed negative cross-strand effects involve phosphates located on opposite faces of the B-form DNA duplex, a simple interpretation of the data is that certain local distortions of the duplex in the vicinity of the scissile phosphate adversely affect the transesterification reaction. Exonuclease III employs a one-step in-line mechanism in which an activated water attacks the scissile phosphodiester (which is coordinated to an essential divalent cation) and expels the 3′-O of the upstream nucleotide of the DNA strand (22Mol C.D. Kuo C.F. Thayer M.M. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Exonuclease III is clearly impeded from hydrolyzing a 2′-5′ phosphodiester. We presume that the altered geometry affects the correct positioning of the attacking nucleophile relative to the new 2′-O leaving group. The block to cleavage at the modified phosphodiester, which is not surprising per se, is overshadowed by two other aspects of our findings. First, we observed that that exonuclease III, though slowed by the 2′-5′ linkage, is nonetheless capable of degrading a fraction of the input DNA strands beyond the modification site. This result raises the interesting question of whether exonuclease III traverses the block directly by hydrolyzing the 2′-5′ phosphodiester linkage or by skipping over the modified linkage and cleaving the DNA at the next available standard phosphodiester bond. (It is also possible that a contaminating endonuclease in the commercial exonuclease III preparation is responsible for traversal of the modified phosphodiester.) Second, we observed that exonuclease III is consistently arrested at positions 1 and 2 nucleotides prior to the encounter of its active site with the modified 2′-5′ phosphodiester. This result implies that exonuclease III surveys or senses the phosphate backbone in advance of the active site."

DNA footprinting studies of various elongation complexes formed by RT around wild type and mutant Ter2 sites have revealed two major structural transformations of these complexes when the enzyme gets closer to Ter2. First, the interactions between RT and the DNA duplex are less extended, although the global affinity of the enzyme for this duplex is only decreased by 2-fold. Second, there is an atypical positioning of the RT RNase H domain on the DNA duplex. We interpret our data as indicating that the AnTm motif located upstream of Ter2 prevents a classical positioning of the enzyme on the double-stranded part of the DNA duplex at some precise positions of elongation downstream of this motif. Instead, novel species of binary and/or ternary complexes, characterized by atypical footprints, are formed.

Chem.276, 31429–31438), would be a transition leading from these new species to a catalytically competent ternary complex. human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 reverse transcriptase dithiothreitol DNA polymerases have a common chemistry of nucleotide incorporation, and the structures involved in the polymerization process are mostly conserved. This conservation, initially suggested by the identification of conserved motifs (1Delarue M. Poch O. Tordo N. Moras D. Argos P. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), has been confirmed by numerous structural and biochemical studies performed on these enzymes (reviewed in Refs. 2Doublie S.

As originally described for the large fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (Klenow fragment) (6Ollis D.L. Brick P. Hamlin R. Xuong N.G. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1985; 313: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar), the general shape of these polymerases resembles a right hand with “fingers,” “thumb,” and “palm” domains. While the palm domain contains the residues responsible for the catalysis of polymerization, the other domains are also involved in this process, for example by interacting with the nucleic acid or with the incoming nucleotide. However, DNA polymerases display some structural differences. Although the “right hand” shape is conserved, there are some differences in the underlying primary sequence, in the secondary structure, and in the size and oligomeric state. Also, the parameters associated with the polymerization process (such as the fidelity, the overall rate, the processivity, and the sensitivity to various drugs) are different for each polymerase. As a consequence, DNA polymerases are expected to display subtle variations around a common theme. Among DNA polymerases, HIV-11reverse transcriptase (RT) is remarkable for the variety of functions it assumes during the copy of the retroviral genome (for recent reviews, see Refs. 7Sarafianos S.G.

Finally, HIV-1 RT terminates the synthesis of the DNA (+)-strand at two precise sites (Ter1 and Ter2) located in the center of HIV-1 genome. Termination at these sites is important for HIV-1 infectivity, and the central termination sequence acts as a cis-determinant of HIV-1 DNA nuclear import (27Charneau P. Mirambeau G. Roux P. Paulous S. Buc H. Clavel F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 28Zennou V. Petit C. Guetard D. Nerhbass U. Montagnier L. Charneau P. Cell. 2000; 101: 173-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). AnTm motifs are located at the 3′-end of the termination sites, and the narrowing of the DNA minor groove induced by these motifs is responsible for the termination events (29Lavigne M. Roux P. Buc H. Schaeffer F. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 507-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 30Lavigne M. Buc H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 977-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Most of the kinetic studies on HIV-1 RT have been performed during classic elongation processes on both RNA and DNA templates. These studies have shown that the mechanism of ordinary elongation by HIV-1 RT is similar to the one proposed for other DNA polymerases. In the simplest case, this mechanism is sequential and requires a conformational change of the enzyme, which precedes the chemical reaction and corresponds generally to the rate-limiting step of the reaction (31Kati W.M.

Chopra R. Verdine G.L. Harrison S.C. Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar), a three-dimensional interpretation of this sequential mechanism has been formulated (7Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Ding J. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: R137-R146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This model does not conflict with the types of movements that have been suggested for the faithful incorporation of a substrate by the polymerase β- or the polymerase I-like families of enzymes (see, for example, the structures of T7 DNA polymerase (39Doublie S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Nature. 1998; 391: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar) and KlenTaq (40Li Y. Korolev S. Waksman G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7514-7525Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar) and the reviews (2Doublie S. Sawaya M.R. Ellenberger T. Struct. Fold Des. 1999; 7: R31-R35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 3Jager J. Pata J.D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 4Brautigam C.A. Steitz T.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 54-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar)). This interpretation proposes that the initial binding of RT to the nucleic acid is associated with a large rotation of the “thumb” domain away from the “fingers” domain of p66. The slow conformational change of RT that precedes the chemical reaction would correspond to a closing movement of the “fingers” domain around the incoming nucleotide. Structural equivalents of the initial binary complex E-Dn or of a ternary complex corresponding to the activated complexE′-Dn-dNTP, located just after the rate-limiting step, are therefore available. Footprinting studies have completed this structural information. The “canonical” footprint of a binary complex E-Dnformed at a position of processive synthesis is characterized by the DNA areas protected against cleavage by DNase I (+7 to −23 on the template strand and −1 to −25 on the primer strand) or by hydroxyl radicals (+3 to −15 on the template strand and +1 to −15 on the primer strand) and by sites hypersensitive to cleavage by these nucleases (positions −20 and −17 on the template strand, respectively) (41Metzger W. Hermann T. Schatz O. Le Grice S.F. Heumann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5909-5913Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 42Wohrl B.M. Tantillo C. Arnold E. Le Grice S.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5343-5356Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Hydroxyl radicals footprints have also revealed a useful property of HIV-1 RT; the Fe2+ cation used to generate the hydroxyl radicals can replace the catalytically active Mg2+ of the RNase H domain of RT. These radicals cleave the most proximal base of the DNA (43Gotte M. Maier G. Gross H.J. Heumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10139-10146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The Fe2+-dependent cuts have been used to trace the activity of the RNase H domain on various DNA/RNA hybrids and DNA/DNA duplexes that reproduce different stages of the replication cycle (15Gotte M. Maier G. Onori A.M. Cellai L. Wainberg M.A. Heumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11159-11169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Finally, the use of mutated RTs that can be site-specifically modified with a photoactivable cross-linking agent or cross-linked with modified nucleotides has allowed the characterization of specific contacts between side chain residues of RT and the nucleic acid duplex (e.g. see Refs. 44Huang H. Harrison S.C. Verdine G.L. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 355-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar and 45Rausch J.W. Sathyanarayana B.K. Bona M.K. Le Grice S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16015-16022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). It is important to know how the structures of the complexes formed by the enzyme during processive synthesis are affected at the steps where the mechanism of elongation is strongly perturbed. Footprinting and kinetic studies performed on the initiation steps have already explained the specificity of these processes (13Isel C. Westhof E. Massire C. Le Grice S.F. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1038-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 15Gotte M. Maier G. Onori A.M. Cellai L. Wainberg M.A. Heumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11159-11169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the case of termination at the central termination sequence, the kinetic studies presented in the preceding article (60Lavigne M. Polomack L. Buc H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31429-31438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) have shown at least three properties of the relevant complexes. First, at the termination site Ter2 or in its immediate vicinity, the global affinity of HIV-1 RT for the corresponding duplex is still in the nanomolar range. Second, a change in the mechanism occurs in a very narrow interval of three nucleotides (at Ter2 and two positions downstream). Third, termination at Ter2 results from a large decrease in the rate of a step located after the formation of an initial ternary intermediate (E-Dn-dNTP in the classical formalism) and before the dissociation of the enzyme from the elongated duplex. This step can be the chemical step and/or the usual conformational isomerization prior to this step. Conversely, termination could also result from a more profound perturbation of the classical mechanism of nucleotide incorporation. In this report, footprinting methods were used to determine the structure of complexes formed by RT at Ter2 and in its vicinity. These studies, performed on small DNA duplexes, have revealed a large heterogeneity in the complexes formed during polymerization at this termination site. They have also shown how a narrow minor groove positioned upstream of the polymerization site could affect the positioning of RT on the corresponding duplex. Indeed, we have found that the most stable complex formed by RT at Ter2 is characterized by an atypical positioning of the RNase H domain on the synthesized DNA. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides (called oligonucleotides) were purchased from Genset and purified by preparative electrophoresis to more than 95% homogeneity. dNTP and ddNTP were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. HIV-1 RT was generously given by T. Unge (46Unge T. Ahola H. Bhikhabhai R. Backbro K. Lovgren S. Fenyo E.M. Honigman A. Panet A. Gronowitz J.S. Strandberg B. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1990; 6: 1297-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Its active site titration was determined, according to Ref. 31Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, on an extended PG5/D22 duplex. Duplexes used in kinetic and footprinting assays were prepared following the same protocol. One of the two oligonucleotides (primer or template) is labeled at its 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP. The two oligonucleotides are annealed in a 2:1 ratio of cold to labeled oligonucleotides. Annealing consists of an incubation of the duplex at 75 °C for 5 min, followed by a slow cooling, in a 100 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.8), 400 mm NaCl, 8% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 6000 solution. Concentrations of the duplexes were always at least 20 times higher than their concentrations in the final assay. All footprinting assays were performed at 37 °C, in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 6 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 2 mm DTT. DNase I was purchased from Worthington and stored at a concentration of 5 mg/ml, at −20 °C. Three different probes were used in these footprinting assays. DNase I attacks were performed as described (47Lavigne M. Kolb A. Yeramian E. Buc H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4983-4990Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) at final concentrations of 2 and 2.5 µg/ml for duplexes labeled in their primer or template strands, respectively. Hydroxyl radical attacks generated by the Fe-EDTA complex and Fe2+complexed with the RNase H domain were performed for 1 min at 37 °C, following a procedure described in Refs. 41Metzger W. Hermann T. Schatz O. Le Grice S.F. Heumann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5909-5913Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar and 43Gotte M. Maier G. Gross H.J. Heumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10139-10146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, respectively. In the presence of RT, final concentrations of iron, EDTA, ascorbate, and H2O2 were 1 mm, 1 mm, 1 mm, and 0.05% respectively. In the absence of RT, these reagents were used at half of these concentrations. Cleavage products, after precipitation with ethanol, were analyzed on 12 or 16% polyacrylamide sequencing gels. When required (titration experiments), the cleavage products were quantified using PhosphorImaging and the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). In order to characterize the structure of the complexes formed by HIV-1 RT at different positions around WT and mutant Ter2 sites, various DNA/DNA duplexes were constructed (Fig.1). One strand of each duplex (template or primer) was labeled at its 5′-end. Three different probes were used to obtain the footprints of the complexes formed between RT and DNA duplexes at equilibrium: DNase I, hydroxyl radicals generated by the Fe-EDTA complex, and hydroxyl radicals generated by Fe2+located within the RNase H catalytic site of the enzyme (called Fe2+-RNase H complex). On each duplex, RT-DNA complexes were formed under two different conditions. The first one consists of a mixture of RT, DNA duplex, and an incorporable ddNTP. This condition allows formation of the binary complex E-Dn. Under the second condition, a dNTP complementary to the next position is added but cannot be incorporated because there is no OH residue at the 3′-end of the primer strand (previous incorporation of a ddNTP). In most cases, this last condition allows formation of a ternary complex, which is more stable than the binary complex ((31Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Tong W. Lu C.D. Sharma S.K. Matsuura S. So A.G. Scott W.A.

The unincorporated dNTP is also called a stabilizing nucleotide. However, this situation is not general, and the ternary complexes prepared under these conditions can be assigned to other types of E-Dn-dNTP complexes, as we show later. Fig. 2, A–D, presents the footprints of the complexes formed at different positions around WT Ter2, obtained using DNase I (Fig. 2, A andD), hydroxyl radicals generated by the Fe-EDTA complex (Fig.2 B), or hydroxyl radicals generated by the Fe-RNase H complex (Fig. 2 C). Fig. 3gives a synopsis of these footprints. Positions of elongation are always designated by the location of the primer 3′-end on the HIV-1 genome. Positions of cleavage by DNase I or by hydroxyl radicals are numbered in relation to the location of this 3′-end. For example, when elongation terminates at position 4934 (Ter2), the nucleotide attacked by hydroxyl radicals and located at position 4934 is numbered −1, and the phosphodiester bond cleaved by DNase I and located between nucleotides 4933 and 4934 is numbered −1.5.Figure 3Synopsis of DNase I and hydroxyl radical footprints of complexes formed by RT at various positions around Ter2. This synopsis is based on the footprints presented in Fig.2, A–D, obtained with complexes formed in the absence and presence of stabilizing dNTP (left and right panels, respectively, the stabilizing nucleotide being represented by a large dot).

At positions 4931 and 4936, three nucleotides upstream and two nucleotides downstream of Ter2, these footprints are very similar to the “canonical” footprints of a binary complex formed at positions where elongation is processive (41Metzger W. Hermann T. Schatz O. Le Grice S.F. Heumann H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5909-5913Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 42Wohrl B.M. Tantillo C. Arnold E. Le Grice S.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5343-5356Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 43Gotte M. Maier G. Gross H.J. Heumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10139-10146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). They show a large protection from DNase I cleavage, which extends to position −25.5 on both template and primer strands and a hyperreactivity at positions −21.5 and −18.5 on template and primer strands, respectively. Footprints with hydroxyl radicals reveal a hyperreactivity at position −17 on the template strand whatever the origin of the radicals (Fe-EDTA or Fe-RNase H complex). Footprints with hydroxyl radicals generated by the Fe-EDTA complex also show a protection of the template strand around the elongation site. Quantification of the hydroxyl radical cleavage products indicates an important decrease of cleavage between positions −6 and +1 (data not shown). At positions 4932 and 4933, two and one nucleotides upstream of Ter2, some characteristics of the “canonical” footprints are changed especially when hydroxyl radicals generated by the Fe-EDTA complex are used as a probe (loss of hyperreactivity at position −17 or decrease of protection around the elongation site). However, the characteristics of the DNase I footprints and the hyperreactivity toward hydroxyl radicals generated by the Fe-RNase H complex are maintained. Therefore, the binary complexes formed at the two positions located immediately upstream of Ter2 have footprints very similar to the footprints of a canonical E-Dn complex. Finally, the footprints of the binary complexes formed at positions 4930, 4934, and 4935 display many differences with the previous set of data. At position 4930, located exactly between Ter1 and Ter2, the footprint is characterized by a smaller protection against DNase I cleavage and by the loss of hyperreactivity to DNase I and hydroxyl radicals at the canonical positions. Hyperreactivity to hydroxyl radicals generated by the Fe-RNase H complex is observed on the template strand at positions −14 and −11 instead of position −17, suggesting an atypical positioning of the RNase H domain of the enzyme on the DNA/DNA duplex. At positions 4934 and 4935, which correspond to Ter2 and one nucleotide downstream, footprints of binary complexes are characterized by a weak and short protection against DNase I cleavage and by a hyperreactivity of nucleotides −13 to −11 on the template strand to hydroxyl radicals generated by the Fe-RNase H complex. A footprinting study of the ternary complexes, formed in the presence of stabilizing nucleotide, has also been performed at various positions around Ter2. At positions 4930–4933 and at position 4936, the footprints are very similar to those of canonical elongation complexes. We attribute them to the E′-Dn-dNTP complexes, which precede the chemical reaction when elongation is performed at a processive position. On the other hand, footprints of complexes formed at positions 4934 and 4935 are different. Protection against DNase I cleavage is more restricted and is associated with a loss of hyperreactive sites on both strands of the duplex. The classical protections and hyperreactivities due to hydroxyl radicals are also lost. They are replaced by a hyperreactivity of the nucleotides located on the template strand between positions −14 and −11. The negative effect exerted by the AnTm tract on the structure of the binary and ternary complexes formed around Ter2 can then be summarized as follows. First, this effect is very local. If one excludes the footprints of the binary complex formed at position 4930, which can be explained by the combined effects of Ter1 and Ter2, the footprints of all complexes are largely different from canonical footprints at two positions only: Ter2 and one nucleotide downstream. This window is one nucleotide smaller than the window where a decrease of the k obs was observed in the recycling elongation assays presented in the accompanying article. The binary complexes formed at these positions show three major differences with canonical binary complexes: a weaker interaction between RT and the DNA duplex, the loss of some contacts between the RNase H domain of the enzyme and the upstream part of the duplex, and the existence of new contacts between this domain and another part of this duplex. These characteristics define a new type of binary complex, called here an incomplete binary complex. At Ter2, this complex is also sensitive to heparin (see preceding article (60Lavigne M. Polomack L. Buc H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31429-31438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar)). Second, the negative effect exerted by the AnTm motif on the formation of the binary complexes is partially reversed in the presence of a stabilizing nucleotide. At positions 4932 and 4933, this reversion is total and leads to a complex having canonical footprints (hyperreactivity to hydroxyl radicals generated by the Fe-EDTA complex is observed at position −17 on the template strand. At positions 4934 and 4935, the ternary complexes show a stronger protection against DNase I cleavage. However, they do not yield an extended footprint, and they are still characterized by an atypical positioning of the RNase H domain on the DNA duplex. Atypical binary and ternary complexes are therefore formed at Ter2 and one nucleotide downstream. The aim of the following studies is to characterize fully these new complexes.

Mutations of the CTS that abolish termination are responsible for a large decrease of HIV-1 infectivity (1Charneau P. Mirambeau G. Roux P. Paulous S. Buc H. Clavel F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). An explanation of this effect has recently been proposed at the molecular and cellular levels (2Zennou V. Petit C. Guetard D. Nerhbass U. Montagnier L. Charneau P. Cell. 2000; 101: 173-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). One characteristic of replication of lentiviruses is that their (+)-strand is synthesized in two segments, starting at two polypurine tracts, located in the center and at the 3′-end of the genome and called cPPT and 3′-PPT, respectively. One of them, the cPPT, is located about 100 base pairs upstream of the CTS. In consequence, between the cPPT and the CTS, (+)-strand synthesis creates a plus-strand overlap, the central flap, that acts as a cis-determinant of HIV-1 DNA nuclear import (2Zennou V. Petit C. Guetard D. Nerhbass U. Montagnier L. Charneau P. Cell. 2000; 101: 173-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). This event may confer to lentiviruses the property of replicating in nondividing cells. It is then essential to determine parameters important for polymerase activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) at this step and to compare them rigorously with more classical elongation processes.In vivo and in vitro, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase terminates DNA synthesis at two precise termination sites of the CTS, called Ter1 and Ter2 (1Charneau P. Mirambeau G. Roux P. Paulous S. Buc H. Clavel F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 241: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In vitro, termination is observed at these sites when elongation is performed on a single-stranded DNA template and is enhanced in conditions of strand displacement, a result that is consistent with the natural conditions of termination. Furthermore, Ter1 and Ter2 are located at the 3′-end of AnTm motifs, and the structure generated by these motifs is responsible for termination (3Lavigne M. Roux P. Buc H. Schaeffer F. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 507-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This structure consists in a global curvature of the DNA helix, associated with a narrowing of the minor groove. This compression, maximal between 5 and 2 base pairs upstream of the termination site, has been shown to be the structural element responsible for the termination event (4Lavigne M. Buc H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 977-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, the width of the minor groove of the synthesized DNA is an important parameter for the polymerase activity of HIV-1 RT. The role of the DNA minor groove has been confirmed by numerous biochemical and structural studies. Processivity of the enzyme is reduced when amino acid side chains entering the DNA minor groove are mutated (5Bebenek K. Beard W.A. Casas-Finet J.R. Kim H.R. Darden T.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J.

These amino acids are conserved within lentiviruses, and the cluster has been defined as the minor groove binding track (MGBT) (8Bebenek K. Beard W.A. Darden T.A. Li L. Prasad R. Luton B.A. Gorenstein D.G. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 194-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Modifications of bases have also been informative. Replacement of adenines by diaminopurines in the AnTmmotifs both enlarge the DNA minor groove within these motifs and abolish termination at their 3′-end (4Lavigne M. Buc H. J. Mol.

Styrene oxide N2-guanine or N6-adenine adducts introduced in the template strand and pointing toward the minor or major groove, respectively, have been shown to block HIV-1 RT downstream of these modifications (10Forgacs E.

Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28527-28530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With both adducts, the profile and efficiency of termination are different between the WT enzyme and enzymes mutated in residues of the MGBT (Trp266 and Gly262) (12Latham G.J. Forgacs E. Beard W.A.

The location of the termination sites and the difference observed between the WT and mutated enzymes both indicate that the residues of the MGBT of HIV-1 RT are sensing the DNA minor groove of the synthesized DNA and that this sensing is important for HIV-1 processivity. Two structures of complexes formed between RT and a DNA/DNA duplex have been obtained (13Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L.

Science. 1998; 282: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). Both structures clearly show a bend of the DNA molecule 4–5 nucleotides upstream of the 3′-end of the primer. This bend is associated with an opening of the minor groove that faces the thumb of the catalytic subunit of the enzyme and more precisely helix αH, which contains four of the five residues of the MGBT. Furthermore, during these studies, efficient cross-links have been obtained between RTs mutated in a residue of the MGBT (Q258C, G262C, or W266C) and a duplex that contains a guanine modified at position N-2 (facing the minor groove) in the template strand (15Huang H. Harrison S.C. Verdine G.L. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 355-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A catalytic complex of HIV-1 RT has been trapped at various positions by these cross-links, stressing the role of the DNA minor groove in the interaction between HIV-1 RT and the elongated DNA duplex. Kinetic studies have shown that the mechanism of ordinary elongation by HIV-1 RT is similar to the one proposed for other DNA polymerases (16Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hsieh J.C. Zinnen S. Modrich P. J. Biol.

Goody R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8046-8049Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Using quench-flow techniques and working in excess of DNA over active enzyme, these studies have suggested a mechanism where the catalytic step is preceded by a conformational change of the enzyme. This isomerization is usually rate-limiting for the incorporation of the nucleotide at saturation of this substrate (corresponding rate constant k c) (SchemeFSI). Classical kinetic assays, measuring the extension of a primer by one nucleotide and initiated by the addition of the corresponding dNTP, generally display a biphasic profile. The first phase, corresponding to the pre-steady state, can generally be fitted with a monoexponential function. Two parameters are obtained from this phase at saturation in dNTP: 1) the burst amplitude, which indicates the quantity of enzyme that has formed a complex ready to elongate the primer before any event of dissociation (this complex is called a “productive” complex) and 2) the exponential constant, corresponding to the polymerization rate equal to k c, at saturating concentrations of dNTP. This burst is followed by a steady state phase, initially linear with respect to time. The elongation rate measured during this recycling process divided by the concentration of active enzyme gives the value of k obs, which is the constant for the rate-limiting step of the recycling reaction. On DNA duplexes where synthesis is processive, this step corresponds to the dissociation of the enzyme from the elongated duplex, and thereforek obs = k off (+1). However, this simple sequential pathway is not always sufficient to account for some specific cases of elongation. Additional complexes have been postulated to describe RNA-primed initiation of reverse transcription (20Lanchy J.M. Ehresmann C. Le Grice S.F. Ehresmann B. Marquet R.

In the present kinetic study, we examined how the sequential scheme (Scheme FSI) should be modified to explain the kinetic behavior at Ter2 and at vicinal positions. Minimal modifications in this scheme were introduced to take into account the following observations. At Ter2, in conditions that allow a recycling of the enzyme, elongation by one nucleotide is not limited by the dissociation of the enzyme from the elongated duplex (as observed at processive positions) but by a new rate-limiting step that occurs before this dissociation event and after binding of nucleotide. Assays performed in the presence of a trap show that the elongation rate is also slow with respect to the dissociation rate of the enzyme from the nonelongated duplex. Finally, we examined how these kinetic features depend on the width of the minor groove that precedes the Ter2 termination site and on the position of the elongation complex with respect to this site. Oligodeoxyribonucleotides (called oligonucleotides) were purchased from Genset and purified by preparative electrophoresis to more than 95% homogeneity. dNTP and ddNTP are from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. HIV-1 RT was generously given by T. Unge (27Unge T. Ahola H. Bhikhabhai R. Backbro K. Lovgren S. Fenyo E.M. Honigman A. Panet A. Gronowitz J.S. Strandberg B. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1990; 6: 1297-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Two different batches of RT were used in this study. For each batch, the percentage of active enzyme was measured on an extended PG5/D22 duplex and following an active site method described in Ref. 16Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Duplexes were prepared according to the same protocol. One of the two oligonucleotides (primer or template) is labeled at its 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP and hybridized to the complementary strand, at a 2:1 ratio (cold/labeled). Hybridization is performed by incubating the duplex for 5 min at 75 °C, followed by a slow decrease in temperature, in a 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 400 mm NaCl, 8% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 6000 solution. Duplexes were always made at concentrations of oligonucleotide at least 20 times higher than their concentrations in the final assay. Assays were performed at 37 °C and in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 6 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Both rapid and slow kinetic assays are based on the quantification, at different times of the reaction, of elongated (n + 1) and nonelongated (n) primers. These two forms were separated on a 16% polyacrylamide sequencing gel and quantified using the PhosphorImaging technique and ImageQuant software. Rapid quench experiments were carried out in a Kintek apparatus (Austin, TX). Experiments were performed by loading the enzyme plus duplex solution in one loop and the dNTP substrate in the second loop. Each reaction was started by rapidly mixing both solutions and quenched with 0.3 m EDTA after time intervals ranging from 11 ms to several minutes. Before being loaded on the separating gel, the reaction products were ethanol-precipitated in order to overcome problems of migration due to the presence of EDTA. Slow kinetic assays were performed after a manual mixing of two solutions, preincubated during 5 min at 37 °C. In the measurements of the k obs of steady state phase (TableI), heparin effect (Fig. 2 c), or dGTP effect (Fig. 3), reaction was started by the addition of substrate (dNTP or ddNTP), with or without effector, to a premix of DNA (duplex or triplex) and RT. In the kinetic assays performed in an excess of enzyme, the reaction is started by the addition of enzyme to a premix of DNA and nucleotide.Table IDependence of the kobs (s−1) value measured during the steady state phase of elongation on the position of elongation and on the structure of the DNA substrateDNA substratePosition (3′-OH of the primer)dNTP (250 µm)ddNTP (250 µm)ddNTP (900 µm)WT duplexes4929*0.280.220.1949300.150.0849310.260.1749320.110.084933*0.140.120.124934*0.0270.0190.02149350.0260.01849360.0190.0184937*0.380.230.1449380.170.1249390.110.114940*0.560.260.234941*0.640.410.28m-C2 duplex4934*0.160.130.2m-C12 duplex4934*0.30.170.18WT triplex4934*0.001NDNDValues of k obs were obtained under conditions of excess of DNA (150 nm) over RT (3 nm), according to the method described under “Experimental Procedures.” DNA substrates are described in Fig. 1.

In both rapid and slow kinetic experiments, performed in an excess of DNA, the rate constant k obs of the recycling process was always calculated by dividing the velocity of elongation during the linear steady state phase by the concentration of active enzyme (defined on a standard processive hybrid; see above). This calculation assumes that the percentage of active enzyme does not depend on the position at which elongation is assayed. Finally, all time-dependent profiles were fitted to their analytical expressions using the Kaleidagraph software. In our previous studies, termination at the CTS has been analyzed by polymerization assays performed on large single-stranded DNA templates and using a mixture of the four dNTPs (3Lavigne M. Roux P. Buc H. Schaeffer F. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 507-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 4Lavigne M. Buc H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 977-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These “run-off” polymerization assays have shown that termination at Ter2, on a WT template, occurs precisely at position 4934 (position of the last nucleotide incorporated). However, these assays do not allow to measure the kinetic constants characterizing the polymerization process at and around this site. In order to study the kinetic of incorporation of one single nucleotide at various positions around Ter2, various small DNA/DNA duplexes were designed. A 60-mer template centered at Ter2 is hybridized to various primers having the same 5′-end but different 3′-ends. Primers are named according to the position of their 3′-end (4929–4941; Fig. 1). As in the case of “run-off” assays, these +1 extension assays were performed on small DNA duplexes having WT or mutated sequences that have been previously shown to abolish termination (m-C2 and m-C12). These +1 extension assays were also performed on small DNA substrates, which better mimic the conditions of strand displacement. In these substrates, called triplexes, the single-stranded part of the duplex is hybridized with a 60-mer oligonucleotide that mimics the strand to be displaced by the enzyme (see Fig. 1). We first studied the kinetics of incorporation of dCTP at Ter2 on duplexes of WT, m-C2, and m-C12 sequences. The corresponding primers are 5′-labeled and terminate at position 4934. Their extension by one nucleotide (to position 4935) can be followed by running the elongation products on a 16% sequencing gel and quantifying the nonelongated and elongated primers. This +1 extension assay was first performed in conditions of large excess of duplexes (130 nm) relative to RT (6 nm). For each time point, the reaction was started by mixing a solution containing RT and the duplex with a concentrated solution of dCTP (250 µm final concentration) and stopped by the addition of EDTA. Reaction times ranged between 11 ms and 180 s. Fig. 2, a andb, shows the kinetics of these extensions. RT clearly displays a different kinetic profile on the WT and mutant duplexes. The kinetics of primer extension of the m-C2 and m-C12 duplexes conform to the behavior expected for a processive synthesis, as summarized in the introduction (16Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They are biphasic and fit well to the following equation: [D n + 1] =A(1 − expk pol t) + Bt, where [Dn+ 1] represents the concentration of elongated primer, A is the amplitude of the burst, k pol is the constant of the pre-steady state exponential phase, and B is the slope of the steady state linear phase. Values of burst amplitude, exponential constant, and slope of the linear phase measured in these assays are given in the legend of Fig. 2 a. The amplitudes of the burst indicate that 50 and 75% of the present enzyme can form a productive complex at the positions tested, on the m-C2 and m-C12 duplexes, respectively. The constants of the exponential phase are not significantly different between the two mutants. They are very close to the values ofk pol measured at processive sites at saturation of dNTP (k c = 20 s−1 in Ref. 16Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Last, the rate constant k obs of the recycling reaction is equal to the slope of the linear steady state phase divided by the concentration of active enzyme (defined on a standard processive hybrid). At processive sites, the recycling process is limited by the dissociation of the enzyme from the elongated duplex. In consequence, on the m-C2 and m-C12 duplexes, k obs =k off (+1). These values (0.4–0.5 s−1) suggest that RT dissociates slightly faster from these elongated duplexes than from others (0.2 s−1). On the WT duplex, this biphasic behavior is abolished and a linear release of products occurs immediately after nucleotide addition. The rate of this process is 0.16 nms−1 and corresponds to a k obs of 0.027 s−1. This value is 7 times lower than a classical dissociation rate. The simplest explanation for this behavior is that there is a new rate-limiting step that affects the first round of incorporation as well as the subsequent ones. The rate of this limiting step can be compared with the kinetic constant characteristic of a usual burst, k pol, which is on the order of 20 s−1 (16Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In consequence, a 700–800-fold decrease of the corresponding constant k c would account for this atypical behavior . If the recycling elongation at WT Ter2 is no longer limited by the dissociation of the enzyme from the elongated duplex, one can then specifically perturb this last step and study its consequences on thek obs constants. This study can be performed at Ter2 on both WT and m-C12 duplexes. Dissociation of RT after elongation is usually disfavored by the addition of the next incorporable deoxynucleotide to the reaction mixture. This effect has been observed when following the incorporation of a dideoxynucleotide in the presence of the deoxynucleotide complementary to the next position and when elongation under recycling conditions is limited by k off (+1) (16Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Tong W. Lu C.D. Sharma S.K. Matsuura S. So A.G. Scott W.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5749-5757Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The corresponding complex has a longer residence time and is thought to mimic the E′-Dn +1-dNTP ternary complex formed in the sequential reaction pathway. We analyzed this effect on WT and m-C12 DNA duplexes made with primers that terminate at Ter2. Their elongation was performed with ddCTP in the presence and absence of dGTP (Fig.3). On the m-C12 duplex, extension is indeed limited by the dissociation of the enzyme at position 4935, since the corresponding value of k obs is decreased 14 times in the presence of dGTP. By contrast, a less than 2-fold decrease is observed on the WT duplex. Therefore, during a recycling phase, elongation at WT Ter2 is not limited by the dissociation of the enzyme from the elongated duplex but by a step occurring during the polymerization pathway. Heparin, a trap of unbound polymerases, was used to challenge primer extension performed on the WT and m-C12 duplexes ending at Ter2. After formation of the enzyme-duplex complexes, in conditions of excess of duplex (200 nm) over RT (5 nm), heparin was added at the same time as the nucleotide substrate dCTP. The effect of the competitor on the elongation of the two duplexes is clearly different (Fig.4). For the m-C12 duplex (and for m-C2 as well; data not shown), the amplitude of the burst is not affected by the presence of heparin in the assay. The enzyme-DNA binary complexes formed at m-C12 Ter2 are therefore resistant to heparin and fully committed toward synthesis during the first turnover. This result also implies that the steps that engage these binary complexes into the elongation process are faster than the dissociation of this complex (k off (0) in Scheme FSI). On the other hand, all complexes formed at WT Ter2 between RT and the DNA duplex are heparin-sensitive. If Scheme FSI still applies,k off (0) must be faster than the rate-limiting step k obs, and all of the binary complexes formed at WT Ter2 can be considered as “slow isomerizing” complexes. The dependence of the rate constantk obs on the dCTP concentration was analyzed at WT Ter2. It follows a simple binding law as shown in Fig.5. At the plateau,k obs is equal to 0.05 s−1, and the corresponding dissociation constantK D(dCTP) is about 150 µm. This value is much higher than the valueK D(dNTP), which characterizes, at positions of processive synthesis, the dependence of the burst ratek pol on nucleotide concentration. This constant corresponds to the binding of dNTP on E-Dn in SchemeFSI and is reported to be on the order of 4–10 µm (16Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, at Ter2, the rate-limiting step occurs after substrate binding (which is poor) and before dissociation of the enzyme from the elongated duplex. All experiments reported up to now can be interpreted though a simple kinetic scheme, requiring only the sequential binding to the enzyme of the duplex DNA and of the deoxynucleotide substrate. The rate-limiting step occurs after this last binding step and before dissociation of the enzyme from the elongated duplex (SchemeFSII). In this model, the role of the enzyme and the duplex are perfectly symmetrical. We can therefore check its relevance by working in excess of enzyme over duplex. Indeed, at WT Ter2, there is no longer any rationale to use the converse situation (excess of duplex), since the information usually provided by a biphasic profile is lost at this position. Scheme FSII represents an ordinary pathway where product formation (corresponding to the last two species in this scheme) is limited by a step between the ternary complex E-DndNTP and the binary complex E-Dn+ 1. The rate of this limiting step is called k ls. Furthermore, we assume that the binding steps leading to the b"
