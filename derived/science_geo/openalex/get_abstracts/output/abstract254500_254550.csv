https://openalex.org/W2094652659,"Through the adoptive transfer of lymphocytes after host immunodepletion, it is possible to mediate objective cancer regression in human patients with metastatic melanoma. However, the generation of tumor-specific T cells in this mode of immunotherapy is often limiting. Here we report the ability to specifically confer tumor recognition by autologous lymphocytes from peripheral blood by using a retrovirus that encodes a T cell receptor. Adoptive transfer of these transduced cells in 15 patients resulted in durable engraftment at levels exceeding 10% of peripheral blood lymphocytes for at least 2 months after the infusion. We observed high sustained levels of circulating, engineered cells at 1 year after infusion in two patients who both demonstrated objective regression of metastatic melanoma lesions. This study suggests the therapeutic potential of genetically engineered cells for the biologic therapy of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2059979506,"Cytosine methylation is important for transposon silencing and epigenetic regulation of endogenous genes, although the extent to which this DNA modification functions to regulate the genome is still unknown. Here we report the first comprehensive DNA methylation map of an entire genome, at 35 base pair resolution, using the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana as a model. We find that pericentromeric heterochromatin, repetitive sequences, and regions producing small interfering RNAs are heavily methylated. Unexpectedly, over one-third of expressed genes contain methylation within transcribed regions, whereas only approximately 5% of genes show methylation within promoter regions. Interestingly, genes methylated in transcribed regions are highly expressed and constitutively active, whereas promoter-methylated genes show a greater degree of tissue-specific expression. Whole-genome tiling-array transcriptional profiling of DNA methyltransferase null mutants identified hundreds of genes and intergenic noncoding RNAs with altered expression levels, many of which may be epigenetically controlled by DNA methylation."

OoÌmycetes such as these Phytophthora species share the kingdom Stramenopila with photosynthetic algae such as diatoms, and the presence of many Phytophthora genes of probable phototroph origin supports a photosynthetic ancestry for the stramenopiles. Comparison of the two species' genomes reveals a rapid expansion and diversification of many protein families associated with plant infection such as hydrolases, ABC transporters, protein toxins, proteinase inhibitors, and, in particular, a superfamily of 700 proteins with similarity to known ooÌmycete avirulence genes."
https://openalex.org/W2028139627,"Two randomized field experiments tested a social-psychological intervention designed to improve minority student performance and increase our understanding of how psychological threat mediates performance in chronically evaluative real-world environments. We expected that the risk of confirming a negative stereotype aimed at one's group could undermine academic performance in minority students by elevating their level of psychological threat. We tested whether such psychological threat could be lessened by having students reaffirm their sense of personal adequacy or “self-integrity.” The intervention, a brief in-class writing assignment, significantly improved the grades of African American students and reduced the racial achievement gap by 40%. These results suggest that the racial achievement gap, a major social concern in the United States, could be ameliorated by the use of timely and targeted social-psychological interventions."
https://openalex.org/W1604181701,"Although the link between long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and supernovae has been established, hitherto there have been no observations of the beginning of a supernova explosion and its intimate link to a GRB. In particular, we do not know how the jet that defines a gamma-ray burst emerges from the star's surface, nor how a GRB progenitor explodes. Here we report observations of the relatively nearby GRB 060218 (ref. 5) and its connection to supernova SN 2006aj (ref. 6). In addition to the classical non-thermal emission, GRB 060218 shows a thermal component in its X-ray spectrum, which cools and shifts into the optical/ultraviolet band as time passes. We interpret these features as arising from the break-out of a shock wave driven by a mildly relativistic shell into the dense wind surrounding the progenitor. We have caught a supernova in the act of exploding, directly observing the shock break-out, which indicates that the GRB progenitor was a Wolf-Rayet star."

Driven by the proton motive force, it mediates the efflux of bile salts, detergents, organic solvents, and many structurally unrelated antibiotics. Here, we report a crystallographic structure of trimeric AcrB determined at 2.9 and 3.0 angstrom resolution in space groups that allow asymmetry of the monomers. This structure reveals three different monomer conformations representing consecutive states in a transport cycle. The structural data imply an alternating access mechanism and a novel peristaltic mode of drug transport by this type of transporter."
https://openalex.org/W2125396253,"A link between long γ-ray bursts (GRBs) and supernovae has been established, but whether there is a similar relationship between the weaker and softer X-ray flashes and supernovae is unclear. GRB/XRF 060218, spotted by the Swift satellite on 18 February this year, may supply that missing link. In the first of four papers on this novel burster, Campana et al. report the sighting of the X-ray signature of a shock break-out, possible evidence of a supernova in progress. Pian et al. report the optical discovery of a type Ic supernova 2006aj associated with GRB/XRF 060218. Soderberg et al. report radio and X-ray observations that show that XRF 060218 is 100 times less energetic than, but of a type that is ten times more common than cosmological GRBs. Mazzali et al. modelled the spectra and light curve of SN 2006aj to show that it had a much smaller explosion energy and ejected much less mass than other GRB-supernovae, suggesting that it was produced by a star with a mass was only about 20 times that of the Sun, leaving behind a neutron star, rather than a black hole. A report of the optical discovery and follow-up observations of the type Ic supernova SN 2006aj associated with X-ray flash XRF 060218. SN 2006aj was intrinsically less luminous than the gamma-ray burst (GRB)–supernovae connection, but more luminous than many supernovae not accompanied by a GRB. Long-duration γ-ray bursts (GRBs) are associated with type Ic supernovae1 that are more luminous than average2,3,4,5 and that eject material at very high velocities. Less-luminous supernovae were not hitherto known to be associated with GRBs, and therefore GRB–supernovae were thought to be rare events6. Whether X-ray flashes—analogues of GRBs, but with lower luminosities and fewer γ-rays—can also be associated with supernovae, and whether they are intrinsically ‘weak’ events or typical GRBs viewed off the axis of the burst7, is unclear. Here we report the optical discovery and follow-up observations of the type Ic supernova SN 2006aj associated with X-ray flash XRF 060218. Supernova 2006aj is intrinsically less luminous than the GRB–supernovae, but more luminous than many supernovae not accompanied by a GRB. The ejecta velocities derived from our spectra are intermediate between these two groups, which is consistent with the weakness of both the GRB output8 and the supernova radio flux9. Our data, combined with radio and X-ray observations8,9,10, suggest that XRF 060218 is an intrinsically weak and soft event, rather than a classical GRB observed off-axis. This extends the GRB–supernova connection to X-ray flashes and fainter supernovae, implying a common origin. Events such as XRF 060218 are probably more numerous than GRB–supernovae."
https://openalex.org/W1969193795,"Over the last decade, long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) including the subclass of X-ray flashes (XRFs) have been revealed to be a rare variety of Type Ibc supernova (SN). While all these events result from the death of massive stars, the electromagnetic luminosities of GRBs and XRFs exceed those of ordinary Type Ibc SNe by many orders of magnitude. The essential physical process that causes a dying star to produce a GRB or XRF, and not just an SN, remains the crucial open question. Here we present radio and X-ray observations of XRF 060218 (associated with SN 2006aj), the second nearest GRB identified to-date, which allow us to measure its total energy and place it in the larger context of cosmic explosions. We show that this event is 100 times less energetic but ten times more common than cosmological GRBs. Moreover, it is distinguished from ordinary Type Ibc SNe by the presence of 10^48 erg coupled to mildly-relativistic ejecta, along with a central engine (an accretion-fed, rapidly rotating compact source) which produces X-rays for weeks after the explosion. This suggests that the production of relativistic ejecta is the key physical distinction between GRBs/XRFs and ordinary SNe, while the nature of the central engine (black hole or magnetar) may distinguish typical bursts from low-luminosity, spherical events like XRF 060218."
https://openalex.org/W2133915176,"Optical control of the primary step of photoisomerization of the retinal molecule in bacteriorhodopsin from the all-trans to the 13-cis state was demonstrated under weak field conditions (where only 1 of 300 retinal molecules absorbs a photon during the excitation cycle) that are relevant to understanding biological processes. By modulating the phases and amplitudes of the spectral components in the photoexcitation pulse, we showed that the absolute quantity of 13-cis retinal formed upon excitation can be enhanced or suppressed by ±20% of the yield observed using a short transform-limited pulse having the same actinic energy. The shaped pulses were shown to be phase-sensitive at intensities too low to access different higher electronic states, and so these pulses apparently steer the isomerization through constructive and destructive interference effects, a mechanism supported by observed signatures of vibrational coherence. These results show that the wave properties of matter can be observed and even manipulated in a system as large and complex as a protein."

We determined the magnitude and direction of shifts over time (24 years between samples on average) in chromosome inversion frequencies and in ambient temperature for populations of the fly Drosophila subobscura on three continents. In 22 of 26 populations, climates warmed over the intervals, and genotypes characteristic of low latitudes (warm climates) increased in frequency in 21 of those 22 populations. Thus, genetic change in this fly is tracking climate warming and is doing so globally."
https://openalex.org/W2020946317,"Habitat fragmentation is one of the largest threats to biodiversity. Landscape corridors, which are hypothesized to reduce the negative consequences of fragmentation, have become common features of ecological management plans worldwide. Despite their popularity, there is little evidence documenting the effectiveness of corridors in preserving biodiversity at large scales. Using a large-scale replicated experiment, we showed that habitat patches connected by corridors retain more native plant species than do isolated patches, that this difference increases over time, and that corridors do not promote invasion by exotic species. Our results support the use of corridors in biodiversity conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2041471015,"The distinct properties of fluorous phases are practically useful for separation, purification, and reaction control in organic synthesis. Here, we report the formation of a liquid-like fluorous droplet, composed of 24 perfluoroalkyl chains confined in the interior of a 5-nanometer-sized, roughly spherical shell that spontaneously assembled in solution from 12 palladium ions and 24 bridging ligands. Crystallographic analysis confirmed the rigid shell framework and amorphous interior. Perfluoroalkanes can dissolve in this well-defined fluorous phase, whereas they can hardly dissolve in a surrounding polar organic solution, and their solubility (up to ∼eight perfluoroalkane molecules per spherical complex) can be finely controlled by tuning the length of perfluoroalkyl chains tethered to the shell."
https://openalex.org/W2126490785,"The insulin-like signaling pathway is known to regulate fat metabolism, dauer formation, and longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we report that this pathway is also involved in salt chemotaxis learning, in which animals previously exposed to a chemoattractive salt under starvation conditions start to show salt avoidance behavior. Mutants of ins-1, daf-2, age-1, pdk-1, and akt-1, which encode the homologs of insulin, insulin/IGF-I receptor, PI 3-kinase, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase, and Akt/PKB, respectively, show severe defects in salt chemotaxis learning. daf-2 and age-1 act in the ASER salt-sensing neuron, and the activity level of the DAF-2/AGE-1 pathway in this neuron determines the extent and orientation of salt chemotaxis. On the other hand, ins-1 acts in AIA interneurons, which receive direct synaptic inputs from sensory neurons and also send synaptic outputs to ASER.

These results suggest that INS-1 secreted from AIA interneurons provides feedback to ASER to generate plasticity of chemotaxis. Animals show various behaviors in response to environmental stimuli and have abilities to modulate behavior according to past experiences. Behavioral plasticity is caused by changes in the response characteristics of neurons, which are, in many cases, induced by the interplay of multiple neurons in the nervous system. It is therefore important to understand the roles of signaling pathways acting for interneuronal communications underlying behavioral plasticity. Involvement of the insulin and PI 3-kinase pathways in neural and behavioral plasticity has been highlighted through various observations in mammals. The insulin receptor (IR) is highly expressed in several brain regions, including the hippocampus and cerebellum, and its inhibition in the central nervous system causes deficits in learning and memory (Zhao et al., 2004Zhao W.Q. Chen H. Quon M.J. Alkon D.L. Insulin and the insulin receptor in experimental models of learning and memory.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2004; 490: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). In hippocampal CA1 neurons, insulin causes long-term depression of synaptic transmission by decreasing AMPA receptors on the plasma membrane (Man et al., 2000Man H.Y. Lin J.W. Ju W.H. Ahmadian G. Liu L. Becker L.E. Sheng M. Wang Y.T. Regulation of AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission by clathrin-dependent receptor internalization.Neuron. 2000; 25: 649-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The PI 3-kinase pathway is one of the signaling pathways acting downstream of receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, including the insulin receptor. Its importance for neuronal plasticity has been demonstrated by impaired amygdala LTP in rats after pharmacological inhibition of PI 3-kinase (Lin et al., 2001Lin C.H. Yeh S.H. Lu K.T. Leu T.H. Chang W.C. Gean P.W. A role for the PI-3 kinase signaling pathway in fear conditioning and synaptic plasticity in the amygdala.Neuron. 2001; 31: 841-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Inhibition of PI 3-kinase also impairs synaptic insertion of AMPA receptors during hippocampal LTP (Man et al., 2003Man H.Y. Wang Q. Lu W.Y. Ju W. Ahmadian G. Liu L. D'Souza S. Wong T.P. Taghibiglou C. Lu J. et al.Activation of PI3-kinase is required for AMPA receptor insertion during LTP of mEPSCs in cultured hippocampal neurons.Neuron. 2003; 38: 611-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In spite of these observations, the understanding of the role of the insulin/PI 3-kinase signaling pathway in synaptic and behavioral plasticity is fragmentary, and the significance of this pathway is unclear. To assess the importance of signaling pathways in behavioral plasticity and understand how they act, a simple model organism such as Caenorhabditis elegans is beneficial. The nervous system of C. elegans is composed of 302 neurons, and their neural connections are fully described (White et al., 1986White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 314: 1-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Worms sense volatile and water-soluble chemicals by sensory neurons in the head and tail and show chemotaxis to these chemicals. This chemotaxis behavior shows several forms of plasticity (Hobert, 2003Hobert O. Behavioral plasticity in C. elegans: paradigms, circuits, genes.J. Neurobiol. 2003; 54: 203-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For example, prolonged exposure to attractive odorants leads to a reduction of chemotaxis to these odorants in a process called “olfactory adaptation” (Colbert and Bargmann, 1995Colbert H.A. Bargmann C.I. Odorant-specific adaptation pathways generate olfactory plasticity in C. elegans.Neuron. 1995; 14: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Several molecules, including OSM-9, a TRP-like ion channel (Colbert and Bargmann, 1995Colbert H.A. Bargmann C.I. Odorant-specific adaptation pathways generate olfactory plasticity in C. elegans.Neuron. 1995; 14: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, Colbert et al., 1997Colbert H.A. Smith T.L. Bargmann C.I. OSM-9, a novel protein with structural similarity to channels, is required for olfaction, mechanosensation, and olfactory adaptation in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8259-8269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), EGL-4, a cGMP-dependent protein kinase (L'Etoile et al., 2002L'Etoile N.D. Coburn C.M. Eastham J. Kistler A. Gallegos G. Bargmann C.I. The cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase EGL-4 regulates olfactory adaptation in C. elegans.Neuron. 2002; 36: 1079-1089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and ADP-1, whose molecular identity is unknown (Colbert and Bargmann, 1995Colbert H.A. Bargmann C.I. Odorant-specific adaptation pathways generate olfactory plasticity in C. elegans.Neuron. 1995; 14: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), are essential for olfactory adaptation. In another form of plasticity, worms subjected to prolonged exposure to attractive salts, such as NaCl, under starvation conditions show a dramatic reduction of chemotaxis to salts and eventually show a negative chemotaxis. Exposure to salts in the presence of food does not lead to a reduction of chemotaxis, suggesting that worms change their behavior by integrating two stimuli, salt and starvation (Saeki et al., 2001Saeki S. Yamamoto M. Iino Y. Plasticity of chemotaxis revealed by paired presentation of a chemoattractant and starvation in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 1757-1764PubMed Google Scholar). HEN-1, a secretory protein with an LDL receptor motif that is expressed in two types of neurons, ASE salt-sensing neurons and AIY interneurons, is involved in this type of learning as well as other integrative sensory processing (Ishihara et al., 2002Ishihara T. Iino Y. Mohri A. Mori I. Gengyo-Ando K. Mitani S. Katsura I. HEN-1, a secretory protein with an LDL receptor motif, regulates sensory integration and learning in Caenorhabditis elegans.Cell. 2002; 109: 639-649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Mutants affected in G protein signaling, Ca2+ signaling, and cGMP signaling show defects in a similar assay for plasticity of salt chemotaxis (Hukema et al., 2006Hukema R.K. Rademakers S. Dekkers M.P. Burghoorn J. Jansen G. Antagonistic sensory cues generate gustatory plasticity in Caenorhabditis elegans.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 312-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The insulin-like signaling pathway in this organism is known to regulate dauer larva formation, an alternative developmental program that occurs under starvation and overcrowding in wild-type animals (Paradis et al., 1999Paradis S. Ailion M. Toker A. Thomas J.H. Ruvkun G. A PDK1 homolog is necessary and sufficient to transduce AGE-1 PI3 kinase signals that regulate diapause in Caenorhabditis elegans.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1438-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The components of the insulin-like signaling pathway are highly conserved with those in mammals, including DAF-2, a homolog of the insulin/IGF-I receptor, AGE-1, a PI 3-kinase homolog, DAF-18, a PTEN homolog, PDK-1 and AKT-1/2, homologs of phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinases, and DAF-16, a FOXO family transcription factor (Paradis et al., 1999Paradis S. Ailion M. Toker A. Thomas J.H. Ruvkun G.

Apart from dauer larva formation, the pathway is also involved in the control of longevity, fat accumulation, sensitivity to hypoxia, and thermotaxis (Murakami et al., 2005Murakami H. Bessinger K. Hellmann J. Murakami S. Aging-dependent and -independent modulation of associative learning behavior by insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 signal in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 10894-10904Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, Paradis et al., 1999Paradis S. Ailion M. Toker A. Thomas J.H. Ruvkun G.

Crowder C.M. Regulation of hypoxic death in C. elegans by the insulin/IGF receptor homolog DAF-2.Science. 2002; 296: 2388-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Here we present evidence that the insulin-like signaling pathway regulates behavioral plasticity in C. elegans. Mutants affected in the insulin-like signaling pathway show severe defects in the behavioral plasticity induced by prolonged exposure to salt. A balance between the PI 3-kinase AGE-1 and the PTEN phosphatase DAF-18 regulates the extent and orientation of salt chemotaxis in the ASER sensory neuron. On the other hand, the insulin-like molecule INS-1 acts in AIA interneurons that receive direct synaptic input from sensory neurons and also send synaptic outputs to ASER. These observations reveal the importance of the feedback regulation by the insulin/PI 3-kinase pathway in behavioral plasticity in C. elegans. We have previously reported that C. elegans learns to avoid NaCl after being exposed to NaCl under starvation conditions (Saeki et al., 2001Saeki S. Yamamoto M. Iino Y. Plasticity of chemotaxis revealed by paired presentation of a chemoattractant and starvation in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 1757-1764PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, a simplified version of the assay was employed (Figure 1A). After soaking in a NaCl-containing buffer for 1 hr (NaCl conditioning), worms show negative chemotaxis to NaCl (Figures 1B and 1C and see Movies S1 and S2 in the Supplemental Data available online). However, treatment with a buffer without NaCl (mock conditioning) does not cause this dramatic change of chemotaxis to the opposite direction (Figure 1B and Movie S3) but causes an increase in chemotaxis. This improvement of chemotaxis by buffer treatment is not the subject of this study but will be briefly discussed in the Discussion. As reported previously (Saeki et al., 2001Saeki S. Yamamoto M. Iino Y. Plasticity of chemotaxis revealed by paired presentation of a chemoattractant and starvation in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 1757-1764PubMed Google Scholar), no decrease in chemotaxis is observed when worms are exposed to NaCl in the presence of food (Figure S1A). Chemotaxis to odorants does not significantly change by conditioning with NaCl, indicating that the behavioral change is not caused by nonspecific effects of salt treatment (Figure 1B and Figure S1A). Chemotaxis to NaCl is dramatically decreased after soaking in a NaCl-containing buffer for 10 min and then is gradually decreased further after a longer conditioning (Figure 1C). The time course of the change in chemotaxis resembles that of a similar salt-plasticity assay reported by Jansen et al. (Jansen et al., 2002Jansen G. Weinkove D. Plasterk R.H. The G-protein gamma subunit gpc-1 of the nematode C.elegans is involved in taste adaptation.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). NaCl-conditioned animals keep avoiding NaCl for about half an hour, suggesting formation of a stable memory (Figure 1D). For simplicity, we hereafter call this form of behavioral plasticity “salt chemotaxis learning.” To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms of salt chemotaxis learning, we searched for learning-defective mutants through existing mutants affected in the regulatory functions of the nervous system. We focused on dauer larva formation (daf) mutants because many daf genes act in neurons to regulate dauer larva formation in response to environmental cues and might also be involved in other aspects of neuronal control (Riddle and Albert, 1997Riddle D.L. Albert P.S. Genetic and environmental regulation of Dauer larva development.in: Riddle D.L. Blumenthal T. Meyer B.J. Priess J.R. C. elegans II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 739-768Google Scholar). Among the daf mutants tested, we found that the daf-2 mutants showed a strong defect in salt chemotaxis learning. daf-2 mutants showed normal chemotaxis to NaCl after mock conditioning but showed only a small decrease of chemotaxis after exposure to NaCl (Figure 1E and Figure S1B). Water-soluble chemicals including NaCl are mainly sensed by ASE neurons (Bargmann and Mori, 1997Bargmann C.I. Mori I. Chemotaxis and thermotaxis.in: Riddle D.L. Blumenthal T. Meyer B.J. Priess J.R. C. elegans II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 717-738Google Scholar). As reported previously (Saeki et al., 2001Saeki S. Yamamoto M. Iino Y. Plasticity of chemotaxis revealed by paired presentation of a chemoattractant and starvation in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 1757-1764PubMed Google Scholar), NaCl conditioning also decreases chemotaxis to several ASE-sensed chemicals, such as cAMP, biotin, and lysine (Figure S2). daf-2 mutants also showed a defect in the plasticity of chemotaxis to these ASE-sensed chemicals (Figure S2). daf-2(e1370) mutants are temperature sensitive: they show a dauer-constitutive phenotype and therefore fail to grow to adults at temperatures above 20°C, while they grow normally at 15°C (Kimura et al., 1997Kimura K.D. Tissenbaum H.A. Liu Y. Ruvkun G. daf-2, an insulin receptor-like gene that regulates longevity and diapause in Caenorhabditis elegans.Science. 1997; 277: 942-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar). The learning defect was observed when daf-2(e1370) mutants were grown at 15°C and conditioned and tested at 25°C. In contrast, the learning defect was not observed at 15°C (Figure 1F). Several different alleles of daf-2 also showed defects in learning (Figure S3). daf-2 encodes the only C. elegans homolog of insulin and IGF-I receptors (Kimura et al., 1997Kimura K.D. Tissenbaum H.A. Liu Y. Ruvkun G. daf-2, an insulin receptor-like gene that regulates longevity and diapause in Caenorhabditis elegans.Science. 1997; 277: 942-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar). Previous studies on the dauer formation and longevity pathways have revealed several genes that act in this pathway, all of which encode phylogenetically conserved proteins. We therefore asked which of these genes are also involved in salt chemotaxis learning. Genes that act downstream of daf-2 include age-1, which encodes a homolog of the catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase thought to be coupled to the DAF-2 receptor; pdk-1, which encodes a phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase homolog; and akt-1 and akt-2, which encode Akt/PKB homologs (Paradis et al., 1999Paradis S. Ailion M. Toker A. Thomas J.H. Ruvkun G. A PDK1 homolog is necessary and sufficient to transduce AGE-1 PI3 kinase signals that regulate diapause in Caenorhabditis elegans.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1438-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Both PDK and Akt/PKB kinases are activated by 3-phosphoinositides, the product of PI 3-kinase. Of these, loss-of-function mutants of age-1, pdk-1, and akt-1 showed defects in the salt learning assay, which were similar to daf-2 mutants (Figures 2A and 2B). These results suggest that the kinase cascade of PDK and Akt/PKB is required downstream of DAF-2 receptor and AGE-1 PI 3-kinase for salt chemotaxis learning. Given that impairment of the DAF-2/AGE-1 signaling causes learning defects, it is of interest to see the consequence of hyperactivation of this signal. daf-18 encodes a homolog of PTEN phosphatase, which catalyzes dephosphorylation of 3-phosphoinositides such as PI(3,4,5)P3, the reverse reaction of PI 3-kinase (Solari et al., 2005Solari F. Bourbon-Piffaut A. Masse I. Payrastre B. Chan A.M. Billaud M. The human tumour suppressor PTEN regulates longevity and dauer formation in Caenorhabditis elegans.Oncogene. 2005; 24: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, the 3-phosphoinositide level is raised in daf-18 mutants, and they show a dauer-defective phenotype, which is opposite to age-1 and daf-2 mutants (Solari et al., 2005Solari F. Bourbon-Piffaut A. Masse I. Payrastre B. Chan A.M. Billaud M. The human tumour suppressor PTEN regulates longevity and dauer formation in Caenorhabditis elegans.Oncogene. 2005; 24: 20-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We found that both the reduction-of-function and null mutants of daf-18, daf-18(e1375), and daf-18(mg198), respectively, showed negative or reduced chemotaxis to NaCl both in naive animals and after treatment in a NaCl-free buffer (Figures 2A and 2B, hatched or open bars). The phenotype implies that 3-phosphoinositides may negatively regulate salt chemotaxis. To further dissect the effect of the daf-18 mutations, we tested the phenotypes of double mutants. daf-2(e1370), daf-2(sa189), age-1(hx546), and akt-1(ok525) mutations partially or fully suppressed the reduced chemotaxis of daf-18(e1375) in double mutants, suggesting that hyperactivation of the DAF-2/AGE-1 pathway caused the reduction of chemotaxis in daf-18 mutants as expected (Figures 2A and 2B, hatched or open bars). Chemotaxis after salt conditioning was similarly affected by these mutations. Introduction of the daf-18(e1375) mutation dramatically reduced the chemotaxis of salt-conditioned daf-2(e1370), daf-2(sa189), and age-1(hx546) mutants to negative values. On the other hand, chemotaxis of the strong mutant of age-1, age-1(mg305), was hardly affected by daf-18 (Figures 2A and 2B, filled bars). These results suggest that residual activity of DAF-2 or AGE-1 carrying weak reduction-of-function mutations can be augmented by lack of DAF-18 PTEN and that extent and orientation of chemotaxis is very sensitive to phosphoinositide levels. Although the null mutants of daf-2 and age-1 are lethal, the lethality of the age-1(m333) null mutant can be rescued by the daf-18 mutations. In the age-1(m333); daf-18(mg198) double null mutants, only a small extent of salt chemotaxis learning occurred, indicating that the AGE-1 pathway plays a major role for salt chemotaxis learning compared to other signaling pathways known to be involved in the behavioral plasticity (Figure 2A and Figure S4). The insulin-like peptide DAF-28 is required for dauer formation (Li et al., 2003Li W. Kennedy S.G. Ruvkun G. daf-28 encodes a C. elegans insulin superfamily member that is regulated by environmental cues and acts in the DAF-2 signaling pathway.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 844-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). However, daf-28 mutants were normal in our salt learning assay (data not shown). In addition to daf-28, 37 insulin-like genes have been predicted in the C. elegans genome. We therefore tested available mutants of the insulin-like genes, including ins-1, whose predicted product is the most similar to human insulin (Pierce et al., 2001Pierce S.B. Costa M. Wisotzkey R. Devadhar S. Homburger S.A. Buchman A.R. Ferguson K.C. Heller J. Platt D.M. Pasquinelli A.A. et al.Regulation of DAF-2 receptor signaling by human insulin and ins-1, a member of the unusually large and diverse C. elegans insulin gene family.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 672-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). We found that the deletion mutant of ins-1, ins-1(nr2091), showed a clear defect in salt chemotaxis learning (Figure 2B), while it was normal in dauer formation and had a wild-type lifespan (Pierce et al., 2001Pierce S.B. Costa M. Wisotzkey R. Devadhar S. Homburger S.A. Buchman A.R. Ferguson K.C. Heller J. Platt D.M. Pasquinelli A.A. et al.Regulation of DAF-2 receptor signaling by human insulin and ins-1, a member of the unusually large and diverse C. elegans insulin gene family.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 672-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). These data suggest that different insulin-like peptides are used for different biological processes; DAF-28 mainly acts for dauer formation and INS-1 mainly for salt chemotaxis learning. We also tested the FOXO family transcription factor DAF-16, which is known to act for both dauer and longevity controls (Paradis et al., 1999Paradis S. Ailion M. Toker A. Thomas J.H. Ruvkun G. A PDK1 homolog is necessary and sufficient to transduce AGE-1 PI3 kinase signals that regulate diapause in Caenorhabditis elegans.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1438-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Mock-conditioned daf-16(m26) reduction-of-function and daf-16(mgDf47) null mutants showed reduced chemotaxis (Figure 2D), which suggested that it might be somehow involved in the regulation of chemotaxis. In dauer and longevity controls, DAF-16 is negatively regulated by the DAF-2/AGE-1 pathway; daf-16 mutations suppress the dauer-constitutive and long-life phenotypes of daf-2 and age-1 mutants (Paradis et al., 1999Paradis S. Ailion M. Toker A. Thomas J.H. Ruvkun G. A PDK1 homolog is necessary and sufficient to transduce AGE-1 PI3 kinase signals that regulate diapause in Caenorhabditis elegans.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1438-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). It also suppresses the enhanced thermotaxis of daf-2 and age-1 mutants (Murakami et al., 2005Murakami H. Bessinger K. Hellmann J. Murakami S. Aging-dependent and -independent modulation of associative learning behavior by insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 signal in Caenorhabditis elegans.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 10894-10904Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, daf-16 mutants did not suppress daf-2 and age-1 mutants in salt chemotaxis learning (Figure 2D). In addition, the phenotypes of daf-16 single mutants and double mutants daf-16; daf-2 or daf-16; age-1 were largely different. Therefore, although DAF-16 might act downstream of the DAF-2/AGE-1 pathway, it cannot be the sole downstream target of the pathway, and factors other than DAF-16 should act for salt chemotaxis learning. The insulin-like signaling pathway could either affect development or act in the mature neural circuit to regulate salt chemotaxis learning. We tested these possibilities by heat-shock rescue experiments. Development of the nervous system occurs mostly in embryos; a subset of neurons is generated and mature during early larval stages in C. elegans. INS-1 was expressed from a transgene in the ins-1(nr2091) mutants under the control of the heat-shock promoter Phsp16-2. When heat shock was applied at the adult stage, the learning defect was rescued in the ins-1 mutants carrying the transgene (Figure 3A). This result indicates that the action of ins-1 at the adult stage is sufficient for salt chemotaxis learning. When daf-18 was similarly expressed at the adult stage using the heat-shock promoter, the chemotaxis defect in the daf-18(e1375) mutants was rescued (Figure 3B, hatched bars), suggesting that the action of daf-18 at the adult stage is sufficient for normal chemotaxis to NaCl and that the chemotaxis defect of daf-18 mutants is unlikely to be due to developmental defects. In addition, salt chemotaxis learning was inhibited in animals where daf-18 expression was induced (Figure 3B, filled bars). We speculate that the overproduction of DAF-18 caused a decrease of the intracellular level of 3-phosphoinositides, which led to a learning defect similar to age-1 mutants. To examine where in the neural circuit the insulin-like signaling pathway acts to alter chemotaxis behavior, we expressed age-1 cDNA in various neurons in age-1(hx546) mutants using cell-specific promoters and examined which promoter-driven cDNA rescued the learning defect in the mutants. When age-1 was expressed using the gcy-5 and gcy-7 promoters or the ceh-36 promoter in ASE neurons, the main salt-sensing chemosensory neurons, the learning defect was rescued, while it was not rescued by expression in the salt-sensing chemosensory neurons other than ASE or in several interneurons (Figures 4A and 4C). These data suggest that age-1 mainly acts in ASE neurons. These neurons consist of a pair of neurons, ASEL and ASER, which are bilaterally symmetrical in morphology. When age-1 was only expressed in ASER neurons using the gcy-5 promoter, learning defects of the age-1(hx546) mutants were completely rescued, while they were not rescued by expression in ASEL neurons using the gcy-7 or lim-6 promoter (Figure 4A). This indicates that age-1 acts only in the ASER neuron. Expression of daf-2 in ASER neurons partially rescued the learning defect of the daf-2(e1370) mutants, while expression in ASEL neurons did not (Figure S5), suggesting that daf-2 also acts in the ASER neuron. The rescue was weak possibly due to the difficulty to express DAF-2 protein from the cDNA. However, it does not rule out the possible role of daf-2 in neurons other than ASE. Reduced chemotaxis to NaCl of daf-18 mutants was rescued by the expression of daf-18 in ASER neurons, but not in ASEL neurons, suggesting that DAF-18 PTEN also acts in ASER neurons for efficient chemotaxis (Figure 4B). To gain insights into the role of DAF-18 PTEN in ASER, we observed the localization of the DAF-18 protein that was fused with Venus, a modified green fluorescent protein (Nagai et al., 2002Nagai T. Ibata K. Park E.S. Kubota M. Mikoshiba K. Miyawaki A. A variant of yellow fluorescent protein with fast and efficient maturation for cell-biological applications.Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar), and expressed in ASER neurons. Functional DAF-18::Venus was localized to the surface of the cell body, dendrite, and axon, but not to the cilia (Figure S6), suggesting that DAF-18 is likely to act at a site other than the cilia, where sensory signal transduction occurs. We also attempted to determine the intracellular localization of AGE-1 and DAF-2 in ASER neurons using fusion proteins with GFP or Venus. AGE-1::GFP was observed throughout the cell, while expression of DAF-2::Venus was too weak to determine the precise localization (data not shown). To further characterize the nature of the chemotaxis defect of daf-18 mutants, we monitored the sensory response of ASER neurons by following the activation of MAP kinase (MAPK). MAPK was previously shown to be activated in olfactory neurons upon odorant stimulus, which was probably dependent on membrane depolarization because the activation did not occur in mutants of cyclic nucleotide-gated channel or voltage-gated calcium channel (Hirotsu et al., 2000Hirotsu T. Saeki S. Yamamoto M. Iino Y. The Ras-MAPK pathway is important for olfaction in Caenorhabditis elegans.Nature. 2000; 404: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In ASER neurons, MAPK was activated within 1 min of removal of NaCl (Figures 5A–5C). This off-response was expected because worms respond to reduction of salt concentrations and change their direction of movement (Faumont et al., 2005Faumont S. Miller A.C. Lockery S.R.

We compared, in macaques, the effects of lesions in subdivisions of the anterior cingulate and the orbitofrontal cortices believed to be anatomically homologous to those damaged in such patients. We show that the anterior cingulate gyrus in male macaques is critical for normal patterns of social interest in other individual male or female macaques. Conversely, the orbitofrontal cortex lesion had a marked effect only on responses to mildly fear-inducing stimuli. These results suggest that damage to the anterior cingulate gyrus may be the cause of changes in social interaction seen after frontal lobe damage."

In contrast, we report that four glycosyltransferases from two distinct natural product biosynthetic pathways—calicheamicin and vancomycin—readily catalyze reversible reactions, allowing sugars and aglycons to be exchanged with ease. As proof of the broader applicability of these new reactions, more than 70 differentially glycosylated calicheamicin and vancomycin variants are reported. This study suggests the reversibility of GT-catalyzed reactions may be general and useful for generating exotic nucleotide sugars, establishing in vitro GT activity in complex systems, and enhancing natural product diversity."

We report that subplate neurons are needed both for maturation of inhibition and for the proper sign of ocular dominance (OD) plasticity. Removal of subplate neurons prevents the developmental upregulation of genes involved in mature, fast GABAergic transmission in cortical layer 4, including GABA receptor subunits and KCC2, and thus prevents the switch to a hyperpolarizing effect of GABA. To understand the implications of these changes, a realistic circuit model was formulated. Simulations predicted that without subplate neurons, monocular deprivation (MD) paradoxically favors LGN axons representing the deprived (less active) eye, exactly what was then observed experimentally. Simulations also account for published results showing that OD plasticity requires mature inhibition. Thus, subplate neurons regulate molecular machinery required to establish an adult balance of excitation and inhibition in layer 4, and thereby influence the outcome of OD plasticity."

These observations suggest a critical role of VAChT in the regulation of ACh release and physiological functions in the peripheral and central nervous system. Acetylcholine (ACh) plays a crucial role in controlling a number of physiological processes in both the peripheral and central nervous system. Synthesis of ACh requires efficient uptake of choline by the high-affinity choline transporter and choline acetylation by the enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) (Ribeiro et al., 2006Ribeiro F.M. Black S.A. Prado V.F. Rylett R.J. Ferguson S.S. Prado M.A. The “ins” and “outs” of the high-affinity choline transporter CHT1.J. Neurochem. 2006; 97: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Efficient release of ACh from nerve endings depends on its storage in synaptic vesicles, a step reliant on the activity of a vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) (Parsons, 2000Parsons S.M. Transport mechanisms in acetylcholine and monoamine storage.FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2423-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). VAChT is a twelve-transmembrane domain protein that uses the electrochemical gradient generated by a V-type proton ATPase to accumulate ACh in synaptic vesicles. VAChT and the vesicular monoamine transporters (VMATs) share a high degree of homology in their transmembrane domains and belong to the SLC18 (or solute carrier) family of proton/neurotransmitter antiporters (Erickson et al., 1994Erickson J.D.

USA. 1994; 91: 10620-10624Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The ACh transporter is likely to provide stringent control of the amount of neurotransmitter stored and released by cholinergic nerve endings (Prado et al., 2002Prado M.A. Reis R.A.

VAChT trafficking to secretory vesicles appears to be the target of cellular regulation, and phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) influences delivery of VAChT to synaptic-like microvesicles in PC12 cells (Cho et al., 2000Cho G.W. Kim M.H. Chai Y.G. Gilmor M.L. Levey A.I. Hersh L.B. Phosphorylation of the rat vesicular acetylcholine transporter.J. Biol.

However, the consequences of reduced targeting of VAChT to synaptic vesicles for ACh output in vivo are unknown. Deficits in central or peripheral ACh neurotransmission have been described in several human disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), in which certain behavioral and cognitive abnormalities have been related to brain cholinergic dysfunction (Bartus et al., 1982Bartus R.T.

The cholinergic lesion of Alzheimer's disease: pivotal factor or side show?.Learn. Mem. 2004; 11: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). However, the relationship between cholinergic decline and specific behavioral deficits is still not completely appreciated. Basal forebrain lesions in rats, with immunotoxins targeting the p75 neurotrophin receptor, indicate that ACh plays an essential role in attention (Sarter and Parikh, 2005Sarter M. Parikh V. Choline transporters, cholinergic transmission and cognition.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), whereas it seems to participate, but it is not essential, in hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory (Parent and Baxter, 2004Parent M.B. Baxter M.G. Septohippocampal acetylcholine: involved in but not necessary for learning and memory?.Learn. Mem. 2004; 11: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To investigate the consequences of reduced expression of VAChT on ACh neurotransmission and function, we genetically modified mice to produce a knockdown (KD) of VAChT gene expression. We observed a strong relationship between the levels of VAChT expression and ACh release in both the peripheral and central nervous systems. A marked reduction of VAChT expression was necessary to affect neurotransmission at the neuromuscular junction, while even modest deficiency was sufficient to interfere with brain ACh release and affect behavior. Moreover, these investigations revealed a role for cholinergic tone in processing complex cues, which manifested as cognitive deficits in mutant mice for object and social memory. To investigate the physiological consequences of altered expression of VAChT as related to vesicle filling and ACh release, we generated a mouse line with decreased expression rather than complete deletion, of this transporter, so we could investigate the consequences of reduced cholinergic tone in vivo (Figures 1A and 1B for wild-type and mutant alleles, respectively). PCR and Southern analyses confirmed homologous recombination and targeting of the 5′ untranslated region of the VAChT gene in genetically altered mice (Figures 1C and 1D). Mutant mice were born at the expected Mendelian frequency, survived, and exhibited no gross abnormalities. Northern analysis of spinal cord indicated that the major mRNA species for VAChT (V1, 2.6 kb) was significantly reduced by 40% and 62% in VAChT KDHET and KDHOM mice, respectively [F(2,11) = 11.09, p < 0.005, one-way ANOVA, Figures 1E and 1F]. Surprisingly, a second VAChT species of 3.0 kb, which was especially apparent in spinal cord, was significantly increased in VAChT KD mice, suggesting that compensatory transcriptional mechanisms operate in response to changes in VAChT expression. The changes in mRNA were specific for VAChT transcripts, as we detected no significant changes in mRNA levels for ChAT [F(2,3) = 0.0311, p = 0.970] and CHT1 [F(2,12) = 0.0921, p = 0.9127] in mutant mice (Figures 1E and 1F). These results agree with the lack of significant alterations found in ChAT activity and high-affinity choline transport in mutant mice (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data). Control experiments using kidney mRNA demonstrated the specificity of the probes (Figure 1E). We investigated the consequences of altered expression of VAChT mRNA in VAChT KD mice by probing protein expression by immunoblot analysis. These experiments show a reduction of close to 50% in immunoreactivity for VAChT in the hippocampus [two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc, F(2,23) = 70.95, p < 0.001, Figures 2D and 2E] and in other brain regions (Figures 2A–2E) of VAChT KDHET mice compared to wild-type control mice. In contrast, levels of other presynaptic proteins were not altered (Figures 2A–2E). Results were similar in all brain regions and in spinal cord (Figure 2E, overall decrease in all tissues was 56% ± 4% of the wild-type levels, n = 20). These results indicate a significant reduction in VAChT protein in VAChT KDHET mice. VAChT KDHOM mice showed further decrease in VAChT protein levels (65% to 70%, Figures 2A–2E). Thus, VAChT KDHOM mice present an even larger decrease in levels of transporter than VAChT KDHET mice, but VAChT expression in homozygous mutant mice is sufficient for survival. In order to evaluate the impact of reduced VAChT expression on quantal ACh release, we examined neuromuscular transmission. Miniature end-plate potentials (MEPPs) were readily recorded at neuromuscular junctions from either wild-type, VAChT KDHET, or VAChT KDHOM mice. To compare quantal size we recorded at least 100 MEPPs from each of five fibers from five to seven animals of each genotype. MEPPs from mutant mice were smaller than those from wild-type, as can be seen in histograms of MEPP amplitudes (Figure 3A). To avoid possible histogram binning artifacts, we also analyzed the cumulative distribution of MEPP amplitudes, which showed a similar shift to smaller MEPPs in mutant animals (Figure 3B, p< 0.001 for VAChT KDHOM, p < 0.05 for VAChT KDHET, Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test). Further statistical analysis using ANOVA on averages of either the peak amplitude or the area of MEPPs confirmed the statistical significance of the differences in quantal sizes between wild-type and VAChT KDHOM animals [F(1,71) = 8.7, p < 0.005]. Therefore, mutant mice appear to pack less ACh in each synaptic vesicle. In addition to quantal size, MEPP frequency was also strongly reduced in VAChT KDHOM animals, as shown in Figure 3C. The frequency of MEPPs was 0.69 ± 0.08 s−1 in wild-type animals (40 synapses from seven animals), 0.79 ± 0.18 s−1 in VAChT KDHET animals (30 synapses from five animals), and 0.37 ± 0.05 s−1 in VAChT KDHOM mice (41 synapses from seven animals). The difference in MEPP frequency between wild-type and VAChT KDHOM mice was statistically significant [two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc, F(1,18) = 10.3, p < 0.005]. The observed decrease in MEPP frequency at junctions from KDHOM mice could be due to a reduction in the number of synaptic vesicles available for release, a reduction in vesicle release probability, or a population of synaptic vesicles whose ACh load is below our detection limit. To investigate these possibilities, we measured evoked end-plate potentials (EPPs) during 100 Hz trains after cutting the muscle fibers to avoid contraction. Under these conditions, EPP amplitudes during a train rapidly fell from their initial level to a depressed steady state over the course of the first ten stimuli (Figure 3D). Overall, initial depression of normalized EPPs was similar in recordings from wild-type and KDHOM animals, suggesting similar release probabilities. Quantal content of each EPP during a train was calculated based on measured MEPP amplitudes, thus permitting an estimate of the size of the readily releasable pool of vesicles as described (Elmqvist and Quastel, 1965Elmqvist D. Quastel D.M. Presynaptic action of hemicholinium at the neuromuscular junction.J. Physiol. 1965; 177: 463-482PubMed Google Scholar). This analysis considered only the first eight responses during a train for which the relationship between EPP versus cumulative EPP was linear. With this method, the readily releasable pool was similar for both genotypes and estimated at 439 ± 73 vesicles in synapses from wild-type animals and 550 ± 59 vesicles in VAChT KDHOM synapses (p = 0.52, two-tailed Student's t test). In contrast, the extent of steady-state depression of EPPs was significantly greater in VAChT KDHOM animals compared with wild-type [one-way ANOVA, F(1,70) = 197, p < 0.001]. Assuming constant quantal size, the increase in depression uncovered in the above experiments would suggest a defect in mobilizing or recycling of ACh-filled vesicles; however, the assumption of constant quantal size during the stimulus train may not be valid for mutant animals. Therefore, we attempted to directly test whether synaptic vesicle exo- and endocytosis would be altered in mutant mice. For this we performed experiments with the vital dye FM1-43 (Richards et al., 2000Richards D.A. Guatimosim C. Betz W.J. Two endocytic recycling routes selectively fill two vesicle pools in frog motor nerve terminals.Neuron. 2000; 27: 551-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), which provides the opportunity for optical detection of both exocytosis and endocytosis of synaptic vesicles. Labeling of nerve terminals in junctions from both wild-type and KDHOM animals in response to 60 mM KCl (10 min) was indistinguishable, and no differences were detected upon quantification of fluorescent spots (Figure 3E), suggesting that endocytosis occurs to the same extent in both genoytypes. Destaining of fluorescent spots in response to 60 mM KCl was calcium dependent (not shown), and was not different between wild-type and KDHOM animals (Figure 3F), indicating that synaptic vesicle exocytosis is not changed in VAChT KDHOM mice. Thus, taken together, our observations would suggest that the alterations in MEPP frequency and EPP depression in VAChT KDHOM are more than likely a consequence of decreased transport of ACh by synaptic vesicles. To evaluate whether the alterations detected in neuromuscular transmission may affect neuromuscular function, we tested the performance of wild-type and mutant mice in motor tasks (Figure 4). In the wire-hang test (Figure 4A), wild-type and VAChT KDHET mice show no differences in performance; however, VAChT KDHOM mice were significantly impaired [F(2,37) = 28.77, p < 0.001]. This altered performance of VAChT KDHOM animals is likely the result of altered neuromuscular force, since these mutants were also severely impaired in a grip strength test when compared with wild-type mice [Figure 4B, F(3,48) = 9.52, p < 0.001]. By comparison, VAChT KDHET mice present no deficit in neuromuscular function as assessed in this test. Importantly, reduced grip strength in VAChT KDHOM mice was improved by prior injection of one of three cholinesterase inhibitors: pyridostigmine (i.p., 1 mg/kg), galantamine (s.c., 1 mg/kg) or physostigmine (i.p., 0.3 mg/kg) [Figure 4B, F(3,47) = 8.323, p < 0.05]. No change in grip force was observed in wild-type mice treated similarly with any of the above cholinesterase inhibitors at the doses used (not shown). Since pyridostigmine is charged and should not cross the blood-brain barrier, its efficacy in improving grip force observed in homozygous mutant mice directly implicates peripheral cholinergic transmission in this effect. To further study neuromuscular output, we examined performance of VAChT mice on the rotarod. This test depends not only on the ability of mice to learn motor skills, but also on their ability to maintain prolonged motor function. Wild-type mice were able to learn this motor task, and after five trials their performance was significantly better than their performance during the first trial [Figure 4C, repeated measures ANOVA, F(13,195) = 16.9, p < 0.05]. The performance of VAChT KDHET mice improved significantly only after 12 trials on the rotarod [repeated measures ANOVA, F(13,117) = 4.63, p < 0.05]. In contrast, VAChT KDHOM mice never learned this motor task [Figure 4C, F(13,91) = 0.653] and their performance was significantly worse than those of wild-type and VAChT KDHET mice [F(2,434) = 60.16, p < 0.05 on trials 12, 13, and 14, two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests]. The performance of VAChT KDHOM mice may indicate either motor learning deficits on the rotarod or that mutant mice are incapable of sustained physical activity. To evaluate the latter possibility, we used a treadmill to evaluate the performance of wild-type, VAChT KDHET, and VAChT KDHOM mice in exhaustive physical activity. Figure 4D shows that VAChT KDHOM mice were not able to maintain long periods of physical activity and performed poorly compared with wild-type or VAChT KDHET mice [one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc, F(2,28) = 22.09, p < 0.001]. Indeed, VAChT KDHOM mice could run for no more than 5 min on the treadmill, whereas wild-type or VAChT KDHET mice could usually run for longer than 60 min. These results indicate that VAChT KDHOM mice are unable to perform on the rotarod due to their decreased capacity to maintain physical activity. They also indicate that VAChT KDHET mice appear as physically fit as wild-type control mice under the conditions tested. VAChT KDHOM mice display significant neuromuscular deficiency, which may confound the outcomes of complex behavioral tests aimed at assessing consequences of central ACh deficiency. In contrast, VAChT KDHET mice have essentially normal neuromuscular transmission, thereby indicating their potential usefulness as test subjects for investigating the behavioral consequences of mild reductions of central cholinergic function. To investigate the functional consequences of reduced VAChT expression, we first used brain microdialysis to establish extracellular levels of ACh in freely moving VAChT KDHET mice. Because all brain regions examined appeared to show similar reductions in VAChT expression, we chose to determine extracellular ACh levels in frontal cortex and striatum. Frontal cortex was selected because this brain region receives innervation from nucleus basalis and substantia innominata, areas known to be affected in Alzheimer's disease. Striatum was chosen because it contains the largest concentration of cholinergic nerve endings and is therefore particularly suitable to evaluate possible decreases in extracellular ACh. The quantitative “low perfusion rate” microdialysis approach, which allows precise determination of a given extracellular neurotransmitter (Gainetdinov et al., 2003Gainetdinov R.R. Bohn L.M. Sotnikova T.D. Cyr M. Laakso A. Macrae A.D. Torres G.E. Kim K.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Premont R.T. Dopaminergic supersensitivity in G protein-coupled receptor kinase 6-deficient mice.Neuron. 2003; 38: 291-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), revealed that levels of extracellular ACh were depressed by more than 35% in frontal cortex [t(1,19) = 2.642, p < 0.016] and by approximately 31% in striatum [t(1,18) = 2.560, p < 0.020] of VAChT KDHET mice (Figure 5A). Next, by using the conventional microdialysis approach, we examined the dynamic responses to KCl-stimulated ACh release in the striatum. After establishing basal extracellular ACh levels, artificial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) containing 60 mM [K+] was perfused through the microdialysis probe over the next 40 min, and the probe was returned to normal artificial CSF for the remaining 40 min of the experiment (Figure 5B). A repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of time [F(5,60) = 31.541, p < 0.001] and a significant time by genotype interaction [F(5,60) = 7.502, p < 0.001]. Bonferroni-corrected pairwise comparisons showed genotype effects at 40 (p < 0.044), 60 (p < 0.023), and 80 min (p < 0.026). Hence, both genotypes responded to KCl depolarization; however, stimulated release in KDHET striatum was reduced relative to that of the wild-type controls. Since VAChT is responsible for sequestering ACh into secretory vesicles, we evaluated the effects of decreased VAChT expression on total ACh levels in brain tissue. When tissue concentrations of ACh were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with eletrochemical detection (HPLC-EC), levels in frontal cortex and striatum of VAChT KDHET mice were significantly increased by approximately 49% [t(1,25) = 4.082, p < 0.001] and 30% [t(1,10) = 3.408, p < 0.007], respectively, over that of the wild-type controls (Figure 5C). These data were replicated in a complementary chemiluminescence assay in a separate group of mice using both striatum and hippocampus (Figure 5D; p < 0.05). Moreover, VAChT KDHOM mice show an even larger increase in ACh content in the brain, and this increase was statistically different from that of VAChT KDHET mice or wild-type mice (Figure S1C; p < 0.05). This increase in ACh content for mutant mice cannot be attributed to an increase in ChAT activity (Figure S1A), high-affinity choline transporter activation (Figure S1D), or increased levels of expression of ChAT (Figures S1B and S1E) or CHT1 (Figure 1E). Whereas the mechanism of such an increase in total tissue ACh content it is not immediately apparent, it is important to emphasize that the functional “releasable” ACh pool seems to be decreased, as evidenced by in vivo microdialysis experiments and quantal analysis at the neuromuscular junction. All together, these results demonstrate that a reduction of approximately 50% in the levels of VAChT expression in the brain results in a significant decrease in the release of ACh in vivo, despite enhanced intracellular content of neurotransmitter. These observations suggest a complex relationship between the control of storage and release of ACh in CNS neurons. After documenting normal performance of VAChT KDHET mice in tests of neuromuscular strength, despite reduced cholinergic tone in the brain, we proceeded to evaluate performance of mutants in behavioral tasks reflecting CNS cholinergic function. VAChT KDHET mice were tested for performance in the step-down inhibitory avoidance task, a task that depends upon hippocampal and amygdala networks and may be sensitive to manipulations in central cholinergic function (Izquierdo and Medina, 1997Izquierdo I. Medina J.H. Memory formation: the sequence of biochemical events in the hippocampus and its connection to activity in other brain structures.Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 1997; 68: 285-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Both genotypes exhibited learning, as latency to step-down from the platform increased from 10 to 15 s to approximately 80 to 100 s after training. In parallel experiments, we determined in another cohort of mice that the unconditioned stimulus was essential for both genotypes to learn the task (data not shown). VAChT KDHET performed as well as wild-type littermates on this task on a short-term (1.5 hr after learning) and long-term (24 hr after learning) memory test, suggesting that this specific aspect of learning and memory is preserved in animals with a mild decrease in cholinergic tone (Figure 6A). A second test for memory, based on the ability to discriminate novel objects, was used to evaluate the performance of mutant mice. In the object recognition task, mice explore two objects, and after a latency of 1.5 or 24 hr they are presented with one of the familiar objects and a nonfamiliar object. Initial exploration time of two objects was identical for both genotypes, indicating that they both show preference for novelty (data not shown). However, whereas wild-type mice exhibited a significant increase in the exploration of the unfamiliar object, mutant mice performed poorly compared to wild-type mice in their ability to remember the familiar object both 1.5 and 24 hr after learning (Figure 6B, p < 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance and Mann-Whitney U tests, n = 12–18). Thus, VAChT KDHET mice appear to have a cognitive deficit that impacts behavior in this test. Recognition of a familiar conspecific is the basis of several social interactions, including hierarchical social relationship and mate choice (Winslow and Insel, 2004Winslow J.T. Insel T.R. Neuroendocrine basis of social recognition.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2004; 14: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). There is evidence for the participation of nicotinic and muscarinic central systems in social recognition in rodents (Prediger et al., 2006Prediger R.D.S. De Mello N. Takahashi R.N.

We evaluated social interactions of VAChT KDHET mice in a habituation-dishabituation paradigm using a mouse intruder (Choleris et al., 2003Choleris E. Gustafsson J.A. Korach K.S. Muglia L.J. Pfaff D.W. Ogawa S. An estrogen-dependent four-gene micronet regulating social recognition: a study with oxytocin and estrogen receptor-alpha and -beta knockout mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 6192-6197Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Wild-type control mice showed extensive exploration of the intruder (e.g., sniffing) during first contact. This response decreased with subsequent exposure to the same juvenile [F(4,11) = 60.93, p < 0.01], indicating that wild-type control mice readily habituated to the conspecific (Figure 6C). Hence, after four exposures to the same juvenile, wild-type mice explored the intruder for only one-third of the length of time of the initial exploration. Upon changing to an unfamiliar mouse, wild-type animals showed a renewed interest in investigation, and explored the new mice as much as they explored the original intruder during the first contact (Figure 6C). These results indicate that lack of interest in exploring the first intruder upon recurring exposure was not attributable to lack of motivation, but appears to be due to habituation, i.e., learning. Exploration of the intruder mice by VAChT KDHET mice on the first contact was slightly less than that observed for wild-type animals (p < 0.05, two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc). Upon subsequent exposures, VAChT KDHET mice show statistically significant differences in exploration of the intruder mice as compared with wild-type mice (p < 0.001, two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc). In sharp contrast to wild-type littermates, VAChT KDHET mice failed to habituate to the juvenile intruder in the subsequent exposures after the initial contact, and only after the fourth contact was there a significant difference in exploratory behavior compared with the first encounter [F(4,10) = 5.293, Figure 6C)]. Introduction of an unfamiliar mouse led VAChT KDHET mice to increase their exploration, indicating that the decrease in exploration during the fourth exposure for the first intruder was not due to nonspecific effects such as physical exhaustion or motivation. One possible explanation for the inability of VAChT KDHET mice to habituate to a conspecific is that mutant mice have olfactory deficits. In a control experiment, we evaluated olfactory responses in these mice. However, both wild-type and VAChT KDHET mice showed similar abilities in finding a hidden food reward (data not shown), suggesting that the differences observed in social recognition do not relate to deficits in olfactory function. In addition, wild-type and VAChT KDHET mice habituated to a test odor similarly [wild-type, F(4,6) = 11.35, and VAChT KDHET mice, F(4,6) = 18.11, p < 0.05 by repeated measures ANOVA]. There were no differences between the two genotypes in olfactory habituation or in their ability to discriminate between two test odors (Figure 6D). A second possibility to explain the deficit in social habituation is that VAChT KDHET mice are more social than wild-type mice, i.e., they prefer the company of intruder mice more than wild-type mice"

A proteomics strategy in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been used to identify a series of spermatogenesis-specific factors that are required for DNA compaction, chromosome segregation and fertility, many of which cause male sterility in mice. The resulting list of proteins will provide new opportunities to identify the causes of male sterility and could also provide possible targets for male contraceptives. The cover image shows nuclei progressing through spermatogenesis in a C. elegans male gonad, which has been fixed and stained with fluorescent markers. DNA is shown in red. Sperm protamines SPCH-1, SPCH-2 and SPCH-3 are shown in green. Yellow in the image indicates colocalization. A proteomics strategy in Caenorhabditis elegans has identified spermatogenesis-specific factors required for DNA compaction, chromosome segregation and fertility, many of which cause male sterility in mice. Male infertility is a long-standing enigma of significant medical concern. The integrity of sperm chromatin is a clinical indicator of male fertility and in vitro fertilization potential1: chromosome aneuploidy and DNA decondensation or damage are correlated with reproductive failure. Identifying conserved proteins important for sperm chromatin structure and packaging can reveal universal causes of infertility. Here we combine proteomics, cytology and functional analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans to identify spermatogenic chromatin-associated proteins that are important for fertility. Our strategy employed multiple steps: purification of chromatin from comparable meiotic cell types, namely those undergoing spermatogenesis or oogenesis; proteomic analysis by multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) of factors that co-purify with chromatin; prioritization of sperm proteins based on abundance; and subtraction of common proteins to eliminate general chromatin and meiotic factors. Our approach reduced 1,099 proteins co-purified with spermatogenic chromatin, currently the most extensive catalogue, to 132 proteins for functional analysis. Reduction of gene function through RNA interference coupled with protein localization studies revealed conserved spermatogenesis-specific proteins vital for DNA compaction, chromosome segregation, and fertility. Unexpected roles in spermatogenesis were also detected for factors involved in other processes. Our strategy to find fertility factors conserved from C. elegans to mammals achieved its goal: of mouse gene knockouts corresponding to nematode proteins, 37% (7/19) cause male sterility. Our list therefore provides significant opportunity to identify causes of male infertility and targets for male contraceptives."

A genome-wide survey of gene copy number variation among human and great ape lineages revealed that the most striking human lineage–specific amplification was due to an unknown gene, MGC8902 , which is predicted to encode multiple copies of a protein domain of unknown function (DUF1220). Sequences encoding these domains are virtually all primate-specific, show signs of positive selection, and are increasingly amplified generally as a function of a species' evolutionary proximity to humans, where the greatest number of copies (212) is found. DUF1220 domains are highly expressed in brain regions associated with higher cognitive function, and in brain show neuron-specific expression preferentially in cell bodies and dendrites."

We conclude that lynx1 functions as an allosteric modulator of nAChR function in vivo, balancing neuronal activity and survival in the CNS. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) make up a family of ionotropic, ligand-gated ion channels, which contribute to a wide range of functions in the central nervous system, including learning and memory, locomotion, and attention (reviewed in Rezvani and Levin, 2001Rezvani A.H.

(1988). The Health Consequences of Smoking: Nicotine Addiction. A Report of the Surgeon General. U.S. Government Printing Office.Google Scholar). Activation of postsynaptic nAChRs induces depolarizing inward currents that typically increase firing frequencies, whereas activation of nAChRs located on presynaptic terminals contributes to Ca2+ flux into the terminal augmenting NT release (reviewed in Dani, 2001Dani J.A.

Activation of nAChRs can thus shift the balance of competing inhibitory and excitatory inputs toward excitation, producing synaptic changes that can facilitate learning and memory (Mann and Greenfield, 2003Mann E.O.

The importance of maintaining the proper balance of cholinergic signaling has been well documented. For example, reductions in nAChR levels or activity have been correlated with Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and dementia (Picciotto and Zoli, 2002Picciotto M.R. Zoli M.

Under some circumstances, nAChR activation can play a neuroprotective role, reducing the cell's sensitivity to excitotoxicity, while in other cases, overactivation of nAChRs can be detrimental. For instance, high doses of nicotine can induce epilepsy (Damaj et al., 1999Damaj M.I. Glassco W. Dukat M. Martin B.R. Pharmacological characterization of nicotine-induced seizures in mice.J.

Even subtle alterations in nAChR activity, such as those resulting from changes in desensitization kinetics, can have important consequences on cholinergic function (Dani et al., 2000Dani J.A.

Taken together, these studies highlight the importance of cholinergic tone in normal CNS function and illustrate the detrimental effects that chronic hyperactivation of nAChRs can have on neurons and neuronal ensembles in vivo. We have previously reported the identification of a cholinergic modulator, lynx1 (Miwa et al., 1999Miwa J.M. Ibanez-Tallon I. Crabtree G.W. Sanchez R. Sali A. Role L.W. Heintz N. lynx1, an endogenous toxin-like modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the mammalian CNS.Neuron. 1999; 23: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), which can form stable associations with nAChRs and alter their function in vitro (Ibanez-Tallon et al., 2002Ibanez-Tallon I. Miwa J.M. Wang H.L. Adams N.C. Crabtree G.W. Sine S.M. Heintz N. Novel modulation of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors by association with the endogenous prototoxin lynx1.Neuron. 2002; 33: 893-903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). lynx1, an evolutionary precursor to snake venom toxins, shares structural characteristics with toxins such as α- and κ-bungarotoxins, which bind tightly to nAChRs and inhibit their activation. When coexpressed with lynx1, α4β2 nAChRs are less sensitive to ACh, display more rapid desensitization, and recover more slowly from desensitization. Single-channel studies of α4β2 receptors indicate that lynx1 shifts the distribution of channel openings toward a faster inactivating species with more uniform, larger amplitude currents. These data, along with studies showing that lynx1 colocalizes and coimmunoprecipitates with α7 and β2 nAChR subunits, are strong indicators that lynx1 has a critical role in modulating cholinergic activity in vivo. To test the hypothesis that lynx1 serves as an endogenous regulator of nAChR activity in vivo, we generated a targeted deletion of the lynx1 gene in mice using homologous recombination. Because lynx1 both decreases nAChR sensitivity and increases desensitization, we postulated that its removal would reduce nAChR desensitization and increase ligand sensitivity, a condition that could lead to novel insights into cholinergic function. We report here that neurons from lynx1 null mutant brains demonstrate heightened sensitivity to nicotine, and a corresponding increase in Ca2+ levels in response to nicotine treatment. In addition, lynx1 null mutant animals display enhanced learning and memory in a fear-conditioning paradigm and show a correlated reduction in paired-pulse facilitation (PPF). They also display an increased sensitivity to nicotine in the rotarod test of motor learning. These data support the hypotheses that lynx1 normally decreases activity of nAChRs and, thus, deletion of lynx1 shifts the balance in favor of increased neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity. Our studies also reveal that the short-term benefits of the loss of lynx1 are counterbalanced by an increased vulnerability of lynx1 mutant neurons to glutamate toxicity and by loss of nicotine's neuroprotective effect on these cells. Consistent with these findings, lynx1 mutant mice exhibit age-dependent degeneration that is exacerbated by nicotine and rescued by null mutations in nAChR subunits. These data are consistent with previous studies demonstrating the neurotoxic effects of mutant hypersensitive variants of nAChRs in vivo. Taken together, our data demonstrate that lynx1 modulates nAChR function in vivo and that it plays a critical role in maintaining a balance between the beneficial effects of short-term nAChR activation and the potentially devastating degenerative effects of chronic activation of these critical CNS receptors. We generated a deletion of the lynx1 coding sequence through gene targeting in mice using homologous recombination in ES cells (Figure 1A). The targeting construct was designed to replace the entire lynx1 coding sequence. Homologous recombination was detected by Southern blot analysis (Figure 1B). As expected, the complete loss of lynx1 protein in the lynx1−/− animals was evident in Western blots of protein extracts from lynx1−/− relative to wild-type+/+ and lynx1+/− littermate brains (Figure 1C). The lynx1−/− animals demonstrated no gross abnormalities in size, viability, CNS morphology, or longevity (data not shown). Direct measurements of nicotine sensitivity were carried out using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of neurons in brain slices of lynx1−/− versus wild-type mice. The medial habenula was chosen for these experiments because of the high level of expression of nAChRs (Sheffield et al., 2000Sheffield E.B. Quick M.W. Lester R.A. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit mRNA expression and channel function in medial habenula neurons.Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 2591-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and the coexpression of lynx1 and nAChRs in this region. Application of a 250 ms nicotine pulse to neurons in the medial habenula (Figure 2B) elicited larger peak responses in slices from lynx1−/− animals than those of wild-type animals (Figure 2A) for nicotine concentrations between 1 and 20 μM. For the entire tested nicotine concentration range (0.1 μM to 300 μM), the data reveal a decrease in the EC50 from 89.0 ± 2.2 μM in wild-type mice to 9.0 ± 0.7 μM in lynx1−/− mice (Figure 2C). These currents were blocked by the nAChR antagonist mecamylamine (mec) and recovered during wash out (middle traces), indicating a specific involvement of nAChRs in this response. Analysis of the decay rate of the nicotine response revealed that the half-maximal response times in neurons from lynx1−/− mice (2.2 ± 0.22 s) were significantly prolonged compared to those of wild-type neurons, (1.4 ± 0.19 s) (Figure 2D). The peak responses are determined primarily by activation processes and show clear hypersensitivity, and these kinetic data also suggest that removal of lynx1 can alter the deactivation and/or desensitization processes of nAChRs in vivo. Since some aspects of nicotinic receptor hypersensitivity may be mediated via intracellular Ca2+ levels, we measured the effect of nicotine on Ca2+ levels in primary cortical cultures from lynx1−/− and wild-type mice. Neurons were exposed either to buffer or 10 μM nicotine. Cultured cells were then loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive indicator fluo-3, and fluorescence measurements were obtained (Figure 3A). Incubation of wild-type cultures with 10 μM nicotine did not result in a significant change in steady-state Ca2+ levels, whereas lynx1−/− cultures demonstrated a 2-fold increase in fluorescence (Figure 3B). These data indicate an effect of lynx1 on ligand sensitivity and/or desensitization of nAChRs. In order to test agonist sensitivity further, we measured acute responses to nicotine by measuring fluorescence levels in real time. Nicotine elicited a significant increase in Ca2+ levels in lynx1−/− but not in wild-type cultures (Figure 3C). Dose-response measurements indicate that ∼1 μM nicotine is sufficient for activation of nAChRs and elevation of Ca2+ levels in lynx1−/− cultures (Figure 3D), but under our conditions, no change in fluorescence was observed at any of the concentrations tested for wild-type cultures (Figure 3D). We conclude that the altered response properties of nAChRs in lynx1 mutant cells can result in elevated intracellular Ca2+ levels, perhaps leading to changes in intracellular signaling. Maintenance of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis is critical for neuronal excitability and synaptic activity. Given the enhanced sensitivity of neurons from lynx1 null mutant mice to nicotine and the elevations in Ca2+ levels observed in these cells in response to nicotine, it seemed likely that changes in synaptic NT release would be present in lynx1 null mutant mice. Since synaptic responses are sensitive to nicotine in the hippocampus and both lynx1 (Miwa et al., 1999Miwa J.M. Ibanez-Tallon I. Crabtree G.W. Sanchez R. Sali A. Role L.W. Heintz N. lynx1, an endogenous toxin-like modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the mammalian CNS.Neuron. 1999; 23: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and nAChRs are present in this brain region (Maggi et al., 2004Maggi L. Sola E. Minneci F. Le Magueresse C. Changeux J.P. Cherubini E. Persistent decrease in synaptic efficacy induced by nicotine at Schaffer collateral–CA1 synapses in the immature rat hippocampus.J. Physiol. 2004; 559: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we tested whether excitatory synaptic responses were altered in lynx1−/− hippocampal slices. We conducted field potential recordings of evoked CA3 to CA1 synaptic responses and measured PPF ratios, an indicator of the probability of NT release, by applying two consecutive stimuli at intervals ranging from 10 to 70 ms. As expected, potentiation of the second response relative to the first response was observed at latency intervals of 30–70 ms in wild-type slices (Figure 4A), as residual Ca2+ from the first stimulus adds to the Ca2+ influx during the second, leading to more vesicle fusion and a potentiation of NT release. In contrast, PPF ratios in lynx1−/− slices were significantly reduced relative to wild-type responses at intervals of 50–70 ms (Figures 4A and 4B). Previous studies have suggested that a reduction in PPF reflects an increased probability of vesicle fusion and NT release, leading to a depletion of vesicle pools available to respond to subsequent stimuli. These data suggest alterations in synaptic efficacy in lynx1−/− mice. nAChR activation has been shown to be an important component of specific aspects of learning and memory (Picciotto et al., 1995Picciotto M.R. Zoli M. Lena C. Bessis A. Lallemand Y. Le Novere N. Vincent P. Pich E.M. Brulet P. Changeux J.P. Abnormal avoidance learning in mice lacking functional high-affinity nicotine receptors in the brain.Nature. 1995; 374: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Therefore, a series of behavioral tests were run on lynx1 null mutant animals to evaluate learning and memory abilities relative to their wild-type littermates. Mice were trained in a fear-conditioning paradigm, a test of associative and contextual learning. On the training day, an unconditioned stimulus of a mild foot shock was paired with a conditioned stimulus, an innocuous tone. When mice were placed into the identical training environment 24 hr later, lynx1−/− mice and wild-type littermates showed no difference in their freezing response, demonstrating that lynx1−/− mice are normal with respect to contextual learning (Figure 5A, left). In cue-associated learning, the animals were placed into a novel environment and presented with the shock-associated tone. lynx1−/− mice demonstrated a significant increase in freezing to tone as compared to their wild-type littermates, indicating an alteration in associative learning (Figure 5A, right). The animals did not show differences when placed in the altered environment, prior to the presentation of tone, indicating no difference in unconditioned fear (data not shown). These data are suggestive of a specific effect of lynx1 on associative fear learning as compared to either unconditioned fear or contextual memory. To assess the specificity of action of lynx1 in memory processes, lynx1−/− mice were analyzed in two other forms of contextual conditioning: passive avoidance conditioning and Morris water maze learning. In passive avoidance conditioning, mice were placed in the light chamber of a two-chambered box, and the latency to enter into the dark, preferred chamber was measured, whereupon the mice were given a mild foot shock. Lynx1−/− display no differences from wild-type when the latency to enter into the dark chamber was measured the following day (Figure 5B). Mice were then assessed for performance in the Morris water maze learning task. Mice were trained for 8 days to swim through water to reach a stationary hidden platform, and the latency to find the platform was measured. No significant differences were observed between lynx1−/− and wild-type mice (Figure 5C) in either the training phase (left) or when the hidden platform was relocated to a different position on the ninth day (the transfer test, upper right). These data are consistent with the lack of effect observed in lynx1 null mutant mice in the contextual component of the fear-conditioning task. These behavioral data are suggestive of a specific involvement of lynx1 in cue-associated learning as opposed to contextual memory. Alternatively, enhanced freezing to tone in lynx1−/− mice could be due to a generalized increase in fear, although the lack of difference in baseline freezing or freezing to context argues against this. To test for differences in anxiety levels, lynx1−/− mice were analyzed in an elevated plus maze paradigm, a more sensitive test for anxiety. Mice were placed for 5 min in a plus-shaped maze that consisted of two open, white arms and two closed, black arms and were scored for entries into the open arm, entries into the closed arm, and time spent in the open arms. lynx1−/− mice displayed no significant differences from wild-type mice in any of these parameters (Figure 5D), although lynx1−/− mice displayed a nonsignificant increase in time spent in the open arm. We conclude from these studies that lynx1−/− mice manifest no differences in basal levels of anxiety. Thus, increased anxiety is unlikely to account for the freezing to tone observed in the fear-conditioning test. Nicotine receptor activation has been shown to stimulate locomotor activity in both rats and mice (Clarke and Kumar, 1983Clarke P.B. Kumar T. The effects of nicotine on locomotor activity in non-tolerant and tolerant rats.Br. J. Pharmacol. 1983; 78: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, King et al., 2004King S.L. Caldarone B.J. Picciotto M.R. β2-subunit-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are critical for dopamine-dependent locomotor activation following repeated nicotine administration.Neuropharmacology. 2004; 47: 132-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To test whether behavioral responses to nicotine were altered in lynx1−/− animals, a series of locomotor tests were performed. To measure general activity levels in lynx1−/− mice, they were tested for diurnal locomotor activity over a 72 hr period (Figure 6A), as well as in a novel environment for 20 min (Figure 6B). No differences between lynx1−/− animals and wild-type littermates were observed in either diurnal locomotion (Figure 6A) or in response to novelty (Figure 6B), indicating that general activity levels were not significantly altered in lynx1−/− mice. To test for sensitivity to nicotine, nicotine was administered to lynx1−/− animals and their wild-type littermates chronically (at least 6 weeks). Motor coordination and motor learning were assessed using an accelerating rotarod paradigm. lynx1−/− mice given saccharin alone in their drinking water showed no significant differences in rotarod performance from wild-type mice, either on the initial test day or on subsequent training days (Figure 6C). Although wild-type mice treated with nicotine plus saccharin (200 μg/ml nicotine in 2% saccharin) showed a trend toward improved performance on the accelerating rotarod compared to saccharin-treated wild-type mice in earlier trials, this difference was not significant (data not shown). In contrast, nicotine-treated lynx1−/− mice displayed a significant improvement in rotarod performance on the second day of training relative to similarly treated wild-type mice, demonstrating a greater effect of nicotine on motor learning in lynx1−/− mice than their wild-type littermates (Figure 6D). The heightened responsiveness of lynx1−/− mice to nicotine in this motor test is consistent with the observation that cultured neurons from lynx1−/− animals are also more responsive to nicotine (Figure 3) and is also consistent with our hypothesis that elimination of lynx1 alters nAChRs toward heightened receptor sensitivity. Treatment of cultured neurons with glutamate or glutamate receptor agonists results in an influx of Ca2+ into the cell that can lead to cell death (McLeod et al., 1998McLeod J.R. Shen M. Kim D.J. Thayer S.A. Neurotoxicity mediated by aberrant patterns of synaptic activity between rat hippocampal neurons in culture.J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 80: 2688-2698PubMed Google Scholar). Pretreatment of neurons with nicotine prior to glutamate exposure can protect cells from glutamate-mediated excitotoxic cell death (Stevens et al., 2003Stevens T.R. Krueger S.R. Fitzsimonds R.M. Picciotto M.R. Neuroprotection by nicotine in mouse primary cortical cultures involves activation of calcineurin and L-type calcium channel inactivation.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10093-10099PubMed Google Scholar). Since lynx1−/− cortical neurons showed increased Ca2+ accumulation upon nicotine administration, we addressed whether lynx1−/− neurons are more vulnerable to glutamate toxicity and whether nicotine remains neuroprotective in the absence of lynx1. As shown previously, wild-type cultures exhibited a significant decrease in cell viability upon 100 μM glutamate treatment, and 1 hr pretreatment of nicotine protects wild-type neurons from cell death (Figures 7A and 7B, left panel) (Dajas-Bailador et al., 2000Dajas-Bailador F.A. Lima P.A. Wonnacott S. The α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtype mediates nicotine protection against NMDA excitotoxicity in primary hippocampal cultures through a Ca(2+) dependent mechanism.Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 2799-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In contrast, lynx1−/− neurons were more sensitive to glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, and the neuroprotective effect of nicotine was completely abolished (Figures 7A and 7B, right panel). Previous studies have shown that nicotine-mediated neuroprotection usually occurs at low doses of nicotine, and the protective effect of nicotine is eliminated and can even result in more cell death with higher doses of nicotine. Consistent with the idea that the lynx1−/− cultures exhibit a shift in the dose-response curve to nicotine, these data suggest that the removal of lynx1 results in heightened sensitivity to nicotine and that a dose of nicotine that is normally neuroprotective is excitotoxic. These data also suggest that there may be an increased vulnerability to neurotoxic insult in lynx1−/− mice, mediated through elevations in Ca2+ due to nAChR hyperactivation. Given the enhanced vulnerability of cultured lynx1 null mutant neurons to excitotoxic stimuli, we were next interested in determining whether the chronic disturbance of nAChR activity evident in lynx1−/− animals might result in cell loss in vivo. Thus, we performed an anatomic study using histological stains on lynx1−/− versus wild-type coronal brain sections. We detected no significant difference between lynx1−/− and wild-type mouse brains at 9 months of age (data not shown). However, inspection of brains from lynx1−/− animals taken at 12 months revealed the presence of large vacuoles in the dorsal striatum (Figure 8A) and isolated brainstem regions (data not shown). Most of these lesions were present in the pinker, eosinic areas of the sections, indicating that the degeneration was occurring within axonal tracts within the striatum (Figure 8B). Further evidence of axonal degeneration was found in the cerebellum (Figure 9A), where nAChRs have been demonstrated (Kaneko et al., 1998Kaneko W.M. Britto L.R.G. Lindstrom J.M. Karten H.J. Distribution of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit in the developing chick cerebellum.Brain Res. Dev.

In addition to the ligand-dependent peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors and liver X receptors, this family of transcription factors includes a large number of orphan receptors, and their role in vascular diseases remains to be investigated. The neuron-derived orphan receptor-1 (NOR1) belongs to the ligand-independent NR4A subfamily, which has been implicated in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In this study, we demonstrate NOR1 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) of human atherosclerotic lesions. In response to mitogenic stimulation with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), SMC rapidly express NOR1 through an ERK-MAPK-dependent signaling pathway. 5′-Deletion analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and transactivation experiments demonstrate that PDGF-induced NOR1 expression is mediated through a cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-dependent transactivation of the NOR1 promoter. Consequently, short interfering RNA-mediated depletion of CREB abolished PDGF-induced NOR1 expression in SMC. Furthermore, PDGF induced Ser-133 phosphorylation of CREB and subsequent binding to the CRE sites of the endogenous NOR1 promoter. Functional analysis demonstrated that PDGF induces NOR1 transactivation of its consensus NGFI-B-response elements (NBRE) in SMC. We finally demonstrate that SMC isolated from NOR1-deficient mice exhibit decreased cell proliferation and characterize cyclin D1 and D2 as NOR1 target genes in SMC. These experiments indicate that PDGF-induced NOR1 transcription in SMC is mediated through CREB-dependent transactivation of the NOR1 promoter and further demonstrate that NOR1 functions as a key transcriptional regulator of SMC proliferation.

Based on this evidence, elucidation of the molecular pathways utilized by nuclear receptors to regulate programs of gene expression is expected to facilitate the development of novel pharmacological approaches for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Nuclear receptors of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) and liver X receptor (LXR) subfamilies are expressed in SMC and inhibit their proliferation in response to mitogenic stimulation thereby limiting the development of postangioplasty restenosis (7Law R.E.

Although much attention has focused on the role of PPARs and LXRs as transcriptional regulators of genes involved in SMC proliferation, the nuclear receptor superfamily includes a large number of so-called orphan nuclear receptors, whose ligands, target genes, and physiological functions are unknown and remain to be discovered (10Chawla A.

Members of the NR4A subfamily transactivate target gene promoters through monomer binding to consensus NGFI-B-response elements (NBRE), homodimer binding to a palindromic NurRE sequence, or heterodimer binding with retinoid X receptor to specific DR5 elements of target genes (13Wilson T.E.

Subsequent studies characterized NOR1 as an early response gene rapidly induced by a variety of extracellular stimuli (12Maruyama K. Tsukada T. Ohkura N. Bandoh S. Hosono T. Yamaguchi K. Int. J.

Our studies using previously generated NOR1-deficient mice demonstrated that NOR1 plays a critical role in neuronal survival, axonal guidance, and is required for the continuous proliferative growth of the semicircular canals (22Ponnio T.

In addition, experiments using overexpression of NOR1 revealed that constitutive NOR1 expression in thymocytes results in apoptosis (24Cheng L.E. Chan F.K. Cado D. Winoto A.

These studies suggest that NOR1 may function as important regulator of key cellular mechanisms, including apoptosis, proliferation, and migration.Recently, NOR1 expression has been identified in atherosclerotic lesions (25Martinez-Gonzalez J.

However, the molecular mechanisms governing NOR1 expression in response to growth factor stimulation, its biological function in SMC, and its role in the development of cardiovascular diseases remain to be investigated.In this study, we analyzed the transcriptional regulation of NOR1 expression in response to stimulation with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a key growth factor mediating SMC proliferation in atherosclerosis and postangioplasty restenosis (29Bornfeldt K.E. Raines E.W. Graves L.M. Skinner M.P. Krebs E.G. Ross R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 416-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To establish an essential physiological function of NOR1 for SMC proliferation, we further analyzed cell proliferation of SMC isolated from NOR1-deficient mice. These experiments demonstrate that PDGF-induced NOR1 expression is mediated through a cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-dependent transactivation of the NOR1 promoter and further outline an essential role for NOR1 to mediate SMC proliferation via an induction of cyclin D1 and D2 expression. Based on these observations, we propose that NOR1 functions as a key transcriptional regulator of SMC proliferation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESImmunohistochemistry—To demonstrate specificity of the employed NOR1 antibody, NOR1 was overexpressed in HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells seeded on 6-well plates were transfected with 1 μg of expression vector overexpressing NOR1 (pCMV-NOR1) (30Ohkubo T. Ohkura N. Maruyama K. Sasaki K. Nagasaki K. Hanzawa H. Tsukada T. Yamaguchi K. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 162: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) or empty vector (pCMV) using Lipofectamine 2000. 24 h after transfection, cells were fixed in acetone and stained with anti-NOR1 antibody (IMG-71915; Imgenex, Inc.) followed by Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (sc-2780; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cells were counterstained with 4′,6′-diamidinophenylindole and visualized using confocal microscopy.For immunohistochemical analysis of NOR1 expression in human atherosclerotic lesions, segments of normal human coronary arteries or arteries containing atherosclerotic lesions at various stages were harvested from explanted hearts during cardiac transplantation. Tissues were fixed in 4% phosphate-buffered formaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Transverse sections (8 μm) were collected, and immunohistochemical analysis of atherosclerotic lesions was performed as described previously (31Bruemmer D. Collins A.R. Noh G. Wang W. Territo M. Arias-Magallona S. Fishbein M.C. Blaschke F. Kintscher U. Graf K. Law R.E. Hsueh W.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1318-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Paraffin-embedded sections were incubated with the rabbit polyclonal NOR1 antibody (IMG-71915; Imgenex, Inc.) followed by biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (BA-1000; Vector Laboratories). SMC co-staining of serial sections was performed using an anti-mouse monoclonal anti-smooth muscle α-actin antibody (Ab18147; Abcam, Inc.) followed by biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (BA-9200; Vector Laboratories).Cell Culture—Rat aortic vascular SMC were isolated and cultured as described previously (32Bruemmer D. Yin F. Liu J. Kiyono T. Fleck E. Van Herle A.J. Law R.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 290: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to 60-70% confluency, serum-deprived in 0.1% FBS for at least 48 h, and subjected to stimulation with rat PDGF-BB (Sigma) at a final concentration of 25 ng/ml. For all data shown, individual experiments were repeated at least three times with different preparation of cells.Northern Blotting—Isolation of total RNA and Northern blotting was performed as described previously (33Bruemmer D.

Acta. 1996; 1308: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Blots were cohybridized with cDNA encoding the constitutively expressed house-keeping gene 36B4 to assess equal loading of samples.Western Blot Analysis—Western blotting was performed as described recently (35Ogawa D.

Primary antibodies were obtained from the following suppliers: NOR1 (2ZH7833H; R & D Systems); phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204), p44/42 MAPK, phospho-CREB (Ser-133), CREB (Cell Signaling); GAPDH (FL 335; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); cyclin D1 (05-815, Upstate); cyclin D2 (M-20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Blots were cohybridized with p44/42 MAPK, CREB, or GAPDH.Plasmids, Transient Transfections, and Luciferase Assay— The NOR1 promoter constructs and the NBRE(x8)-Luc reporter construct were used as described recently (36Ohkura N. Hosono T. Maruyama K. Tsukada T. Yamaguchi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 37Ohkura N. Ito M. Tsukada T. Sasaki K. Yamaguchi K. Miki K. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 211: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The CRE-mutated NOR1 promoter constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Hiroshi Tokumitsu (Kagawa Medical University, Kagawa, Japan) (38Inuzuka H. Tokumitsu H. Ohkura N. Kobayashi R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 522: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The dominant-negative CREB (ACREB) construct was provided by Dr. Jane E.-B. Reusch (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Aurora, CO) (39Watson P.A. Vinson C. Nesterova A. Reusch J.E.-B Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2922-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). SMC were transfected for 6-8 h with 2 μg of reporter DNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Following transfection, cells were serum-deprived in 0.1% FBS for 24 h and subsequently stimulated with PDGF (25 ng/ml) for the indicated time points. Luciferase activity was assayed using a dual luciferase reporter assay (Promega). Transfection efficiency was normalized to Renilla luciferase activities generated by cotransfection of 10 ng/well pGL4.74[hRluc/TK] (Promega).Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—ChIP assays were performed using an EZ-ChIP assay kit (Upstate) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, quiescent SMC were stimulated with PDGF (25 ng/ml) for the indicated time points. Cells were harvested, and soluble chromatin was prepared. Chromatin was immunoprecipitated using an antibody (4 μg) directed against Ser-133-phospho-CREB (catalog number 9192; Cell Signaling). Final DNA extractions were PCR-amplified using the following primer pairs that cover the three CRE consensus sequences between -79 and -46 in the NOR1 promoter: forward, 5′-ACACGAACACACACACCCT-3′; reverse, 5′-TCCATAGAGTGCCTGGAATGCGA-3′.siRNA Knockdown of CREB Expression—siRNA experiments were performed using the SMARTpool technology (Dharmacon RNA Technologies), which provides a mix of four different proprietary siRNAs specific for rat CREB. SMC were plated at a density of 1.0 × 105 cells on 6-well plates and transfected with 150 nmol/liter of CREB siRNA or scrambled siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Following transfection, cells were serum-deprived in 0.1% FBS for 12 h and subsequently stimulated with PDGF (25 ng/ml) for 6 h. Total cell lysates were collected and analyzed for CREB and NOR1 protein expression by Western blotting.Isolation of Murine Aortic Vascular SMC—NOR1-deficient mice have been described previously (22Ponnio T. Burton Q. Pereira F.A. Wu D.K. Conneely O.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 935-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Heterozygote NOR1 mice were interbred to generate littermate NOR1-/- and NOR1+/+ mice used for the isolation of aortic vascular SMC. Five different preparations of NOR1-/- and wild type SMC were isolated from the aortas of 8-10-week-old male matched littermate mice. The aortas were excised, washed in PBS, and incubated in DMEM containing 1 mg/ml collagenase type 2 (Worthington) for 15 min. The adventitia was removed; the aortas were incised longitudinally, and the endothelial cells were gently scraped off. The vessels were then transferred to culture dishes containing DMEM with 0.5 mg/ml collagenase type 1 (Worthington) and 0.125 mg/ml elastase type III (Sigma). Subsequently, the vessels were minced with scissors, incubated in 37 °C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator, and mechanically dispersed by pipeting vigorously every 10 min for 40-60 min until >90% of the cells were dispersed under the microscope. The cells were centrifuged at 1600 rpm for 5 min then resuspended in 3 ml of DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS, 2% penicillin/streptomycin, and cultured in 60-mm plates. Cultured cells were verified as SMC by immunostaining using anti-α-smooth muscle actin (Sigma) and calponin antibodies (Sigma).Cell Proliferation Assays—NOR1+/+ and NOR1-/- murine aortic vascular SMC were plated at a density of 0.5 × 105 cells/plate on 60-mm plates and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Proliferation assays were performed with exponentially growing cells in 10% FBS or following serum deprivation in 0.1% FBS for 24 h followed by stimulation with PDGF (25 ng/ml). After 2, 4, 6, and 8 days, cells were harvested, and cell proliferation was analyzed by cell counting using a hemocytometer. To re-express NOR1 protein in NOR1-/- cells, NOR1-deficient SMC were transfected with 1 μg of pCMV-NOR1 or an expression vector overexpressing green fluorescent protein (pCMV-GFP) as control. Cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 20% FBS. Cell proliferation was analyzed after 3 days by cell counting using a hemocytometer. For all experiments, wild type and NOR1-deficient SMC of similar passages (passage 3-7) were employed. Experiments were performed in triplicates using five different preparations of aortic vascular SMC.Statistical Analysis—Analysis of variance and paired or unpaired t test were performed for statistical analysis as appropriate. p values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Results are expressed as mean ± S.E.RESULTSNOR1 Is Expressed in Human Atherosclerotic Lesions—The specificity of the employed NOR1 antibody was first confirmed in HEK293 cells, which had been transfected with a eukaryotic expression vector overexpressing NOR1 protein. These experiments demonstrated NOR1 staining only in cells transfected with the NOR1 expression vector and not with the control vector. The staining pattern revealed a typical nuclear localization of NOR1 protein as depicted in the supplemental Fig. 1.To analyze NOR1 protein expression in normal arteries and arteries containing atherosclerotic lesions of different stages, immunohistochemical analysis was performed using tissues derived from coronary arteries of explanted hearts during cardiac transplantation. Serial sectioning and staining for smooth muscle α-actin and NOR1 revealed that NOR1 expression is almost absent in the media of normal arteries, although some staining is observed in endothelial cells (Fig. 1A). In contrast, in early stages of atherosclerosis (Fig. 1, B and C) and fibroatheromas (Fig. 1D), NOR1 is strongly expressed in neointimal SMC. Higher magnifications indicate that in these cells NOR1 expression is typically observed in the nucleus. In more advanced atherosclerotic lesions (Fig. 1E), NOR1 expression was observed in SMC of the fibrous cap as well as in medial SMC. In addition, these lesions revealed NOR1 expression in the core of the atheroma.PDGF Induces NOR1 mRNA and Protein Expression through ERK-MAPK-dependent Signaling Pathways—In response to vascular injury, secreted growth factors stimulate SMC proliferation that perpetuates neointimal hyperplasia contributing to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (2Dzau V.J. Braun-Dullaeus R.C. Sedding D.G. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1249-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 4Schwartz S.M. deBlois D. O'Brien E.R.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 445-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar, 40Ross R. Glomset J.A. Science. 1973; 180: 1332-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). PDGF is one of the most potent mitogenic growth factors secreted after vascular injury and induces SMC migration and proliferation (29Bornfeldt K.E. Raines E.W. Graves L.M. Skinner M.P. Krebs E.G. Ross R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 416-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In an effort to identify novel transcription factors regulating SMC proliferation, we screened for the expression of nuclear receptors in quiescent SMC stimulated with PDGF. In Northern blotting experiments, NOR1 mRNA was transiently induced after stimulation with PDGF (Fig. 2A). The NOR1 cDNA recognized two transcripts (4.0 and 5.7 kb) because of alternative splicing from the NOR1 gene (37Ohkura N. Ito M. Tsukada T. Sasaki K. Yamaguchi K. Miki K. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 211: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports characterizing NOR1 as an early response gene (20Maruyama K. Tsukada T. Bandoh S. Sasaki K. Ohkura N. Yamaguchi K. Cancer Lett. 1995; 96: 117-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), maximal NOR1 mRNA expression was observed after 2 h. As further depicted in Fig. 2B, Western blotting experiments identified maximal NOR1 protein expression 6 h after stimulation with PDGF.FIGURE 2PDGF induces NOR1 expression through ERK/MAPK-dependent signaling pathways. SMC were serum-deprived for 48 h and stimulated with PDGF (25 ng/ml). A, mRNA was isolated at the indicated time points and analyzed for NOR1 expression by Northern blotting. Cohybridization for the housekeeping gene 36B4 was performed as internal control. B, whole cell proteins were isolated at the indicated time points and analyzed for NOR1 protein expression by Western blotting. Cohybridization for GAPDH was performed to assess equal loading. C, quiescent SMC were pretreated with wortmannin (WT, 200 mm), PD98059 (PD, 10 mm), SB203580 (SB, 15 mm), and SP600125 (SP, 25 mm) for 30 min prior to stimulation with PDGF (25 ng/ml). RNA was isolated 2 h after stimulation and analyzed for NOR1 mRNA expression by Northern blotting. The autoradiograms shown are representative of three independently performed experiments using different cell preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Previous work has established a critical role for ERK-MAPK in PDGF signaling, vascular SMC proliferation, and arterial injury (41Mii S. Khalil R.A. Morgan K.G. Ware J.A. Kent K.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H142-H150PubMed Google Scholar, 42Gennaro G. Menard C. Michaud S.-E. Deblois D. Rivard A. Circulation. 2004; 110: 3367-3371Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We next investigated whether ERK-MAPK signaling cascades mediate PDGF-induced expression of NOR1. Pretreatment of quiescent SMC with the pharmacologic inhibitor of MEK1 PD98059 (10 μm) almost completely abolished PDGF-induced NOR1 expression (Fig. 2C). In contrast, inhibition of p38 MAPK (SB203580, 15 μm), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (wortmannin, 200 μm), or c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling (SP600125, 25 μm) revealed only a modest effect on PDGF-induced NOR1 mRNA expression. These observations reveal that PDGF-induced NOR1 expression in SMC is primarily mediated through the RAS-MEK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway.The Proximal NOR1 Promoter Confers the Transcriptional Regulation in Response to PDGF—To investigate the transcriptional mechanisms regulating NOR1 promoter activity, SMC were transiently transfected with a 4.0-kb NOR1 promoter fragment. Stimulation of quiescent SMC with PDGF resulted in 4.75 ± 0.38-fold induction of NOR1 promoter activity (Fig. 3A). A series of 5′-deletion constructs was employed to further identify the minimal responsive promoter region that confers the transcriptional regulation of the NOR1 promoter in response to PDGF. Although PDGF induced NOR1 promoter activity of a -162-NOR1 promoter construct, the -42-NOR1 promoter construct was not inducible (Fig. 3B). These findings indicate that PDGF-induced NOR1 promoter activity is dependent on transcription factor-binding sites located between -162 to -42 relative to the transcription initiation site.FIGURE 3The proximal NOR1 promoter confers the transcriptional regulation in response to PDGF. A, SMC were transiently transfected with a 4.0-kb NOR1 promoter construct, serum-deprived, and stimulated with vehicle (white bars) or PDGF (25 ng/ml, black bars)for 6 h. B, SMC were transfected with the indicated 5′-deletion series of the 4.0-kb NOR1 promoter. Serum-deprived cells were stimulated with either vehicle (white bars) or PDGF (25 ng/ml, black bars) for 6 h. Following stimulation, cells were harvested, and luciferase activities were analyzed. Transfection efficiency was adjusted by normalizing firefly luciferase activities to Renilla luciferase ac"
https://openalex.org/W2041544905,"Neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) containing tau are a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). NFT burden correlates with cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in AD. However, little is known about mechanisms that protect against tau-induced neurodegeneration. We used a cross species functional genomic approach to analyze gene expression in multiple brain regions in mouse, in parallel with validation in Drosophila, to identify tau modifiers, including the highly conserved protein puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (PSA/Npepps). PSA protected against tau-induced neurodegeneration in vivo, whereas PSA loss of function exacerbated neurodegeneration. We further show that human PSA directly proteolyzes tau in vitro. These data highlight the utility of using both evolutionarily distant species for genetic screening and functional assessment to identify modifiers of neurodegeneration. Further investigation is warranted in defining the role of PSA and other genes identified here as potential therapeutic targets in tauopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2140110083,"Learning and motivation are integral in shaping an organism's adaptive behavior. The dopamine system has been implicated in both processes; however, dissociating the two, both experimentally and conceptually, has posed significant challenges. We have developed an animal model that dissociates expression or scaling of a learned behavior from learning itself. An inducible dopamine transporter (DAT) knockdown mouse line has been generated, which exhibits significantly slower reuptake of released dopamine and increased tonic firing of dopamine neurons without altering phasic burst firing. Mice were trained in experimental tasks prior to inducing a hyperdopaminergic tone and then retested. Elevated dopamine enhanced performance in goal-directed operant responses. These data demonstrate that alterations in dopaminergic tone can scale the performance of a previously learned behavior in the absence of new learning."
https://openalex.org/W2088377890,"Sgt1p is a conserved, essential protein required for kinetochore assembly in both yeast and animal cells. Sgt1p has homology to both TPR and p23 domains, sequences often found in proteins that interact with and regulate the molecular chaperone, Hsp90. The presence of these domains and the recent findings that Sgt1p interacts with Hsp90 has led to the speculation that Sgt1p and Hsp90 form a co-chaperone complex. To test this possibility, we have used purified recombinant proteins to characterize the in vitro interactions between yeast Sgt1p and Hsp82p (an Hsp90 homologue in yeast). We show that Sgt1p interacts directly with Hsp82p via its p23 homology region in a nucleotide-dependent manner. However, Sgt1p binding does not alter the enzymatic activity of Hsp82p, suggesting that it is distinct from other co-chaperones. We find that Sgt1p can form a ternary chaperone complex with Hsp82p and Sti1p, a well characterized Hsp90 co-chaperone. Sgt1p interacts with its binding partner Skp1p through its TPR domains and links Skp1p to the core Hsp82p-Sti1p co-chaperone complex. The multidomain nature of Sgt1p and its ability to bridge the interaction between Skp1p and Hsp82p argue that Sgt1p acts as a “client adaptor” recruiting specific clients to Hsp82p co-chaperone complexes.

Hsp90 is a highly conserved molecular chaperone that has been linked to maintaining the activity of a number of cellular proteins involved in signal transduction and cell division. This role has been linked to the normal cycle of protein activation and inactivation associated with the highly dynamic pathways that control cell division (1Whitesell L. Lindquist S.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (1975) Google Scholar). In addition, Hsp90 has been proposed to play a more general role in “buffering” the proteome against the genetic changes associated with the rapid accumulation of mutations found in cancers or in slow accumulation of changes that contribute to gene evolution (2Sangster T.A. Lindquist S. Queitsch C. BioEssays. 2004; 26: 348-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). How Hsp90 is targeted to its substrates, or clients, remains a major unresolved question. A large group of Hps90-associated proteins have been proposed to assist Hsp90 in client recognition or in the transition of client to its final active state. One class of Hsp90-associated proteins includes “co-chaperones,” proteins that interact with Hsp90 and frequently are found to modulate its ATPase activity. Co-chaperones typically interact with Hsp90 through two conserved domains: (i) a tetracopeptide repeat (TPR) 2The abbreviations used are: TPR, tetracopeptide repeat; CBF3, centromere binding factor-3; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). domain or an Hsp20/α-crystallin domain, also known as a p23-domain, after the founding member of the family (3Lamb J.R.

The relevance of this genetic interaction lies in the fact that Skp1p is a Sgt1p-associated protein. The Skp1-4p mutant fails to interact with Sgt1p, and this failure compromises the assembly of the budding yeast centromere-DNA binding complex, CBF3 (6Rodrigo-Brenni M.C. Thomas S. Bouck D.C.

Science. 2005; 309: 929-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Recent work in human tumor cells further argues that essential mitotic functions of Sgt1p overlap with those of Hsp90 in these cells (26Niikura Y. Ohta S. Vandenbeldt K.J. Abdulle R. McEwen B.F. Kitagawa K. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 4133-4146Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Interpreting these genetic findings requires some basic understanding of the biochemical role of Sgt1p in the context of Hsp90 function. Recent reports have shown that Sgt1p co-immunoprecipitates with the molecular chaperone Hsp90 in yeast, plants, and humans (7Bansal P.K. Abdulle R. Kitagawa K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8069-8079Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 9Takahashi A. Casais C. Ichimura K. Shirasu K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2004; 24: 8938-8950Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Alone, this observation does not distinguish between Sgt1p being an Hsp90 client or co-chaperone. Co-precipitation data shows only a small fraction of total Sgt1p in a complex with Hsp90 and does not address whether additional factors are required to mediate the Sgt1p-Hsp90 interaction (7Bansal P.K. Abdulle R. Kitagawa K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8069-8079Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 11Lingelbach L.B. Kaplan K.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8938-8950Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, work with known co-chaperones has suggested that they may bind with much higher affinity than seen for Sgt1p and Hsp90 in extracts; the yeast co-chaperones Sti1p and Cpr6p have dissociation constants that suggest co-chaperone-Hsp90 complexes should predominate in vivo (27Prodromou C. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Woolfson D.N. Regan L. Panaretou B. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 754-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). One possible interpretation is that Sgt1p forms a transient interaction with Hsp90, one more reminiscent of the essential Hsp90-targeting subunit, Cdc37p (28Pearl L.H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To explore the relationship between Sgt1p and Hsp90 in more detail, we have used purified recombinant proteins to reconstitute Hsp90-Sgt1p complexes in vitro. We have found that the p23 homology domain of Sgt1p is required for the direct interaction between Sgt1p and Hsp90. Sgt1p binds preferentially to non-ATP bound forms of Hsp90 and does not alter the intrinsic ATPase activity of the chaperone. Interestingly, Sgt1p can form at least two distinct ternary complexes; in the first, Hsp90 interacts directly with Sgt1p and Sti1p and in the second, Sgt1p interacts with Skp1p through its TPR domain and Hsp90 through its p23 homology domain. Importantly, we demonstrate that Sgt1p can recruit Skp1p to the core co-chaperone complex containing Hps90 and Sti1p. Together, these findings argue that Sgt1p functions as a client adaptor, linking Hsp90 to a specific set of clients. Plasmids and Cloning—Construction of His-Sgt1p for baculoviral expression has been previously described (6Rodrigo-Brenni M.C. Thomas S. Bouck D.C. Kaplan K.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3366-3378Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) as has His-Skp1p (29Russell I.D. Grancell A.S. Sorger P.K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 933-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Yeast HSP82, STI1, and CPR6 were PCR-amplified with the addition of appropriate cloning sites from yeast genomic DNA and cloned into a modified pFASTBAC™ vector (Invitrogen), pFBNHis10HA (6Rodrigo-Brenni M.C. Thomas S. Bouck D.C. Kaplan K.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3366-3378Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), or pMIT-77 (pFASTBACGST followed by PreScission Protease cleavage site; details provided upon request) to generate His-Hsp82p, GST-Hsp82p, GST-Sti1p, or GST-Cpr6. Inserts were confirmed by DNA sequencing. p23ET, a plasmid for bacterial expression of Histagged yeast Sba1, was a kind gift of Avrom Caplan. Site-directed mutagenesis using PCR was performed to generate mutant versions of Sgt1p and Hsp82p. Coding sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Details of cloning techniques or primers used are available upon request. Protein Expression and Purification—His-Sba1p was expressed and purified from bacterial lysates as previously described (30Fang Y. Fliss A.E. Rao J. Caplan A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3727-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). All other proteins used in this paper were expressed and purified using the baculoviral expression system. High Five™ insect cells (Invitrogen) were infected with the appropriate virus for 48 h, chilled on ice 15 min, then washed in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed on ice 15 min using 1% Triton buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) plus protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin, and chymostatin) then centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 21,000 × g. The soluble fraction was removed, aliquoted, flash frozen, and stored at -80 °C for subsequent purification. To purify GST- or His-tagged fusion proteins, 100 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) or 100 μl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen, Valencia CA), as appropriate, were added to soluble baculoviral extract containing the desired fusion protein diluted 1:10 in 1% Triton buffer and rocked at 4 °C for 2 h. Generally, extract containing 40 μg of fusion protein was used, although the protocol could be scaled up or down without altering purity or percent yield. After rocking, beads were washed three times in 500 μl of 1% Triton buffer, followed by three washes in 500 μl of SHB-Tris (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, with protease inhibitors as described for 1% Triton buffer). GST fusion protein to be used as bait for binding assays was stored as purified at 4 °C for up to 1 week. To produce cleaved Sti1p or Cpr6p, GST fusion protein-bound beads were further washed three times in PreScission protease buffer followed by addition of 2 units of PreScission protease and overnight cleavage at 4 °C as described by the manufacturer (GE Healthcare). Eluted protein was aliquoted and flash frozen. His fusion proteins bound to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads were washed three times in five bead volumes of SHB-Tris plus 50 mm imidazole, and protein was then eluted three times in one bead volume of SHB-Tris plus 250 mm imidazole. Eluted protein was combined, aliquoted, and flash frozen. Contaminating chaperones were released from Sti1p and Sgt1p protein fusions by including a final wash step with SHB-Tris buffer containing 5 mm ATP for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by three washes in SHB-Tris buffer with no nucleotide. Although this step reduced co-purifying proteins, it had no effect on the binding assays. Because the ATPase assays described below require large amounts of highly concentrated protein, the above protein purification protocol was scaled up, and eluted proteins were concentrated using Microcon YM-30 centrifugal filter devices (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Protein Binding Assays—For the quantitative binding assays shown in Fig. 1 (A and B) proteins to be assayed were quantified using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 0.025, 0.050, or 0.100 nmol of Sgt1p, Sti1p, or Cpr6p was added to 0.100 nmol of GSTp or GST-Hsp82p bound to glutathione beads in 200 μl of SHB-Tris and processed as described below. For the other binding reactions shown, 10 μl of GST, GST-Hsp82p, or GST-Skp1p (∼2 μg of protein), bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) and purified as described above, was added to 200 μl of SHB-Tris followed by addition of ∼2 μg of additional protein(s) to be assayed. Binding reactions were rocked at room temperature 1 h and then centrifuged at 1000 × g. Depleted supernatants were removed, and proteins were concentrated after adding 20% w/v trichloroacetic acid. Beads were washed three times in 200 μl of cold SHB-Tris. Bound and unbound fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie-stained. For GST-Skp1p binding experiments, PreScission Protease was used (as described above) to cleave the fusion protein prior to SDS-PAGE because GST-Skp1p and His-Sgt1p co-migrate. To quantify bound Sgt1p, Sti1p, and Cpr6 bound to GST-Hsp82p (Fig. 1B), the intensity of the band (or doublet of bands for Sgt1p) was determined from the Coomassie-stained gel using ImageQuaNT (GE Healthcare), converted to micrograms of bound using the molecular weight ladder as an internal control, then converted to nanomoles of bound using the molecular weight of the protein. Nucleotide Dependence of Binding—Binding reactions of Sgt1p to GST-Hsp82p with or without various nucleotides were conducted as above with the following modifications. SHB-Tris binding buffer was modified via addition of 6 mm MgOAc and 5 mm ADP, ATP, AMP-PNP (Sigma), or ATPγS (Roche Applied Science) as indicated. Geldanamycin (a kind gift of the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Developmental Therapeutics, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, NCI, National Institutes of Health) was diluted from a 10 mg/ml (17.8 mm) stock in Me2SO to a final concentration of 60 μm. This concentration has previously been shown to completely inhibit the ATPase activity of purified Hsp90 (31McLaughlin S.H. Smith H.W. Jackson S.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 787-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 32Panaretou B. Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4829-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). GST-Hsp82 and indicated nucleotide or geldanamycin were mixed on ice and then preincubated at 30 °C for 30 min followed by the addition of potential binding partner to be assayed, and assays were completed as described above. Reactions were prepared on ice, then GST-Hsp82, and indicated amounts of nucleotide or geldanamycin were preincubated at 30 °C for 30 min, potential binding partner to be assayed was added, and assays were completed as described above. For Sba1p binding (Fig. 1D), binding was performed as described (33Weikl T. Abelmann K. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), but no cross-linking reagent was used. ATPase Assays—Pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase-coupled ATPase assays were conducted essentially as described (32Panaretou B. Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4829-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 34Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), except that buffer SHB-Tris (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) was modified with 13 mm MgOAc and 5 mm ATP. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C in 200 μl of reaction volume with 0.4 nmol of Hsp82p and/or 1.2 nmol of co-chaperone (Sgt1p, Sti1p, Cpr6p, and Sba1p) unless otherwise noted. Addition of 60 μm geldanamycin completely inhibited the ATPase activity of our His-Hsp82p preparation (data not shown), ruling out the possibility of contaminating ATPases. Sgt1p Directly Interacts with Yeast Hsp90—To characterize Sgt1p-Hsp90 complexes in more detail, we expressed and purified yeast Sgt1p and Hsp82p using baculoviral expression in insect cells (see “Experimental Procedures”). To serve as positive controls and to allow comparison of Sgt1p to known HSP90 co-chaperones, the well characterized co-chaperones Cpr6p, Sti1p, and Sba1p were also purified as either GST fusions, or multihistidine fusions (supplemental Fig. S1). Sti1p is the yeast homolog of human HOP (35Nicolet C.M. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3638-3646Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and is thought to mediate transfer of client proteins from Hsp70p to Hsp90 (36Smith D.F. Sullivan W.P. Marion T.N. Zaitsu K. Madden B. McCormick D.J. Toft D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 37Hernandez M.P. Sullivan W.P. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38294-38304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Cpr6p is a yeast cyclophilin-like molecule (38Duina A.A. Chang H.C. Marsh J.A. Lindquist S. Gaber R.F. Science. 1996; 274: 1713-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and Sba1p is the homolog of human p23 (30Fang Y. Fliss A.E. Rao J. Caplan A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3727-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Both Cpr6p and Sba1p are believed to act at a late step of Hsp90 client activation (39Wegele H. Muller L. Buchner J. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 151: 1-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Previous efforts have co-purified only small amounts of Sgt1p associated with Hsp90 under conditions where the presence of other potential bridging proteins could not be ruled out (7Bansal P.K. Abdulle R. Kitagawa K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8069-8079Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 11Lingelbach L.B. Kaplan K.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8938-8950Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To test if the interaction between Sgt1p and Hps90p is direct, we purified recombinant, His-tagged versions of yeast Sgt1p (His-Sgt1p) and a GST fusion of the yeast Hsp90 protein, Hsp82p (GST-Hsp82). When added at equimolar ratios, His-Sgt1p specifically interacted with GST-Hsp82, but not GST, bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Fig. 1A). His-Sgt1p purified from insect cells migrates as a doublet due to protein phosphorylation (see arrows, Fig. 1A) 3B. A. Macher and K. B. Kaplan, unpublished observations. ; interestingly, both forms of His-Sgt1p bind equally well to GST-Hsp82 (compare with load gel, supplemental Fig. S1). To assess the relative affinity of Sgt1p for GST-Hsp82p, we compared its ability to bind with two known co-chaperones, Sti1p and Cpr6p (Fig. 1A). We assayed the binding of Sgt1p, Sti1p, and Cpr6p when added at 1:4, 1:2, or 1:1 molar ratios to GST-Hsp82p. Taking into account the two forms of Sgt1p, quantitative analysis of digitized gel images suggest Sgt1p binds to GST-Hsp82p with similar affinity to other known co-chaperones (Fig. 1B). Multiple modes of interactions link Hsp90 to its co-chaperone and clients. Some interactions are sensitive to conformational changes in Hsp90 mediated by nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. For example, it has been reported that Sba1p/p23 interacts preferentially with the ATP-bound form of Hsp90; Sti1p/Hop1 interacts preferentially with the ADP-bound form of Hsp90; and Cpr6p binds to Hsp90 independent of nucleotide (27Prodromou C.

To test the effect of nucleotide on the interaction between Sgt1p and Hsp90, we incubated purified His-Sgt1p with GST-Hsp82p in the absence of nucleotide, in the presence of ADP, ATP as well as the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogues, ATP-γ-S and AMP-PNP (see “Experimental Procedures”). His-Sgt1p bound to GST-Hsp82p in the absence of nucleotide, suggesting that binding does not require Hsp82p to be bound to nucleotide. Consistent with this possibility, geldanamycin, a highly specific Hsp90 inhibitor that displaces ATP from the active site (42Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G. De Costa B. Myers C.E. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar, 43Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H.

Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar), has no effect on the interaction of His-Sgt1p with GST-Hsp82p (Fig. 1C). Although incubation with ADP resulted in similar amounts of His-Sgt1p bound to GST-Hsp82p compared with the no nucleotide condition, ATP, and to a greater extent ATPγS and AMP-PNP had an inhibitory effect on the binding of His-Sgt1p to GST-Hsp82p. As anticipated from the participation of Sti1p in the HSP90 “intermediate” complex and Cpr6p in the HSP90 “mature complex” (27Prodromou C. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Woolfson D.N. Regan L. Panaretou B. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 754-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), the binding of Cpr6p to GST-Hsp82p increased when GST-Hsp82 was ATP-bound, whereas Sti1p failed to interact with GST-Hsp82p in the presence of nonhydrolyzable ATP analogues (Fig. 1C). Although a weaker interaction, Sba1p bound to Hsp82p best in the presence of non-hydrolyzable nucleotide analogues and was further enhanced with the addition of sodium molybdate under conditions previously described (Fig. 1D) (33Weikl T. Abelmann K. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Skp1p did not bind directly to GST-Hsp82p under any of the nucleotide conditions tested (Fig. 1B). These controls argue that the preparation of GST-Hsp82p bound to glutathione Sepharose is behaving as predicted, allowing us to conclude that, like Sti1p, Sgt1p has a lower affinity for Hsp90 in its ATP-bound conformation. Sgt1p Does Not Alter the Enzymatic Activity of Hsp82p—The binding of Sti1p and Sgt1p to the ATP-bound form of Hsp82p raised the possibility that these two proteins have a similar effect on the enzymatic activity of Hsp82p. Previous reports have shown that Sti1p/HOP blocks access of ATP to Hsp90 (27Prodromou C. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Woolfson D.N. Regan L. Panaretou B. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 754-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). We therefore asked if Sgt1p could alter the hydrolysis rate of Hsp82p. For these experiments, we used a His-tagged version of yeast Hsp82p (see “Experimental Procedures”). Because the enzymatic activity of yeast His-Hsp82p produced in insect cells using baculovirus had not been previously determined, we first established conditions where reliable kinetics could be measured. Using conditions similar to previously published work, we observed His-Hsp82p to have a hydrolysis rate of 0.285 mol/min/mol at 37 °C (Table 1), a rate comparable although slightly lower than previously reported (0.4 mol/min/mol (32Panaretou B. Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4829-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar)). Adding 60 μm of the ATP binding site competitor geldanamycin completely blocked ATP hydrolysis in our assay, arguing that there are no nonspecific ATPases present in the His-Hsp82p preparation. Importantly, ATP hydrolysis was almost completely inhibited when we added 3-fold molar excess of Sti1p or Sba1p; in contrast, addition of 3-fold excess of Cpr6p had no effect on ATP hydrolysis by His-Hsp82p (Table 1). These results are consistent with previously published reports and further validate the integrity of the purified system (27Prodromou C. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Woolfson D.N. Regan L. Panaretou B. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 754-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 45Richter K. Walter S. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 342: 1403-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To determine if Sgt1p could alter the rate of ATP hydrolysis, it was added at a 3:1 ratio to Hsp82p. We observed no affect on ATP hydrolysis by His-Hsp82p (Table 1). An increase in the molar ratio of Sgt1p:His-Hsp82p also had no effect on the rate of ATP hydrolysis (>10-fold Sgt1p:His-Hsp82p; data not shown). This is consistent with the preference of Sgt1p for the non-ATP bound form of Hsp82p. We conclude that, although Sgt1p and Sti1p both bind to Hsp82p with sim"

In addition, CD44 mediates the endocytosis of hyaluronan leading to its subsequent degradation within lysosomes. Using model systems of COS-7 and Flp-293 cells, we demonstrate that the association of CD44 with lipid rafts is essential for the endocytosis of hyaluronan but not the extracellular binding. Further, we demonstrate that palmitoylation of CD44 on two highly conserved cysteine residues is essential for the association with lipid rafts as determined by density gradient ultracentrifugation. Mutations of either cysteine residues or pretreatment of cells with the palmitic acid analog 2-bromopalmitate, reduced the [3H]palmitic acid incorporation into CD44 and prevented CD44-lipid rafts association. Preventing CD44 palmitoylation had no effect on the binding of hyaluronan but inhibited hyaluronan internalization. The turnover of the CD44 receptor itself was also affected by blocking its association with lipid rafts. Using cycloheximide to prevent de novo protein synthesis, palmitoylation-deficient cysteine mutants underwent slower turnover from cell surface compared with the palmitoylation-intact wild type, as determined by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. These results indicate that palmitoylation of CD44 is a critical driving determinant to CD44 association with lipid rafts and, concomitantly, the rates of hyaluronan endocytosis and CD44 turnover from cell surface.

CD44 is a single pass transmembrane glycoprotein expressed by a wide variety of cells. On many of these cells, CD44 serves as the principal receptor for the extracellular matrix macromolecule hyaluronan. For example, in articular chondrocytes CD44-hyaluronan interactions are critical to the cellular retention of the proteoglycan-rich extracellular matrix (1Knudson C.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 825-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). CD44 also participates in receptor-mediated internalization of hyaluronan, resulting in hyaluronan degradation within low pH intracellular compartments (2Embry J. Knudson W.

Luukkonen M. Hascall V.C. Tammi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35111-35122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In addition, the cytoplasmic domain of CD44 does not contain an AP-2 adaptor binding site (YQRL or LL) indicative of interactions with clathrin or caveolin-binding domains such as ΦXΦXXXXΦ, ΦXXXΦXXΦ, and ΦXΦXXXXΦXXΦ, where X is any amino acid and Φ is an aromatic residue (5Knudson W. Peterson R.S. Garg H.G. Hales C.A. Chemistry and Biology of Hyaluronan. Elsevier, Boston2004: 83-123Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). As such, it remains unclear as to the mechanism cells use to regulate the extent of CD44-mediated hyaluronan internalization. Although we have found various regions within the cytoplasmic domain of CD44 that are required for the mechanics of CD44-mediated endocytosis of hyaluronan (6Jiang H. Knudson C.B. Knudson W. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 2599-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 7Jiang H. Peterson R.S. Wang W. Bartnik E. Knudson C.B. Knudson W. J. Biol.

Orthop. 2004; 15: 369-375Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), none of these interaction sites appear to regulate the process. In this study, the differential association of CD44 with lipid rafts was determined to be the major mechanism by which cells segregate pools of CD44 destined for internalization. Lipid rafts are specialized plasma membrane microdomains rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids such as sphingomyelin and gangliosides. Various lipids as well as proteins associate with lipid rafts. Lipid rafts can have widespread function in cells, including signal transduction, receptor endocytosis, apoptosis, and cholesterol esterification (10Radeva G. Sharom F.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 219-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The association of CD44 with lipid rafts has previously been reported in other systems. For example, in EpH4 cells (immortalized mouse mammary epithelial cell line) CD44 was shown to associate with lipid rafts along with caveolin/VIP21 and an actin-binding protein annexin II, and this interaction was dependent on the presence of cholesterol and an intact cytoskeleton (11Oliferenko S. Paiha K. Harder T. Gerke V. Schwarzler C. Schwarz H. Beug H. Gunthert U. Huber L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Similarly in T cells, antibody-induced cross-linking of CD44 was capable of rearranging the actin-based cytoskeletal network followed by targeting of CD44 and certain CD44-associated kinases like Fyn and Lck into lipid rafts (12Foger N. Marhaba R. Zoller M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2888-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Certain fatty acid modifications can lend proteins the necessary hydrophobicity for such an association with lipid rafts to take place (13Bijlmakers M.J. Marsh M. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 32-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). One such modification is fatty acid acylation, especially palmitoylation, a dynamic, reversible, post-translational modification involving the formation of thioesters between one or more palmitate to cysteine residues on proteins. The cysteine residues optimal for palmitoylation are believed to reside on the transmembrane domain or the cytoplasmic domain or the boundary between the transmembrane/cytoplasmic domains (13Bijlmakers M.J. Marsh M. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 32-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CD44 has two cysteine residues located in regions of the protein accessible to acylation. One of these cysteines is within the highly conserved transmembrane domain, Cys286, and another, within the highly conserved proximal cytoplasmic domain, Cys295. CD44 palmitoylation has previously been reported in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (14Liu D. Sy M.-S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1987-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In these cells, CD44 acylation was stimulated by the addition of particular cross-bridging anti-CD44 monoclonal antibodies. Such a fatty acid modification on CD44 was found to be important to the CD44-hyaluronan-mediated signal transduction. Palmitoylation can be involved in dictating several functions in cells. For example, hRas undergoes dual palmitoylation where both the palmitate residues were shown to have distinct roles with respect to membrane affinity, lateral segregation, and protein trafficking from the Golgi to the plasma membrane (15Roy S. Plowman S. Rotblat B. Prior I.A. Muncke C. Grainger S. Parton R.G. Henis Y.I. Kloog Y. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6722-6733Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Similarly, CCR5, a chemokine co-receptor for HIV-1, 2The abbreviations used are: HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; CD44H, human CD44; FRT, flp recombinase target site; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Fl-HA, fluorescein-conjugated hyaluronan; HABP, hyaluronan binding protein; CD44wt, CD44 wild-type; 2-BP, 2-bromopalmitate; Mβ-CD, methyl-β-cyclodextrin. undergoes palmitoylation, which in turn affects the degradation of the molecule (16Percherancier Y.

In this case, the loss of palmitoylation led to faster endocytosis and degradation of the mutant protein compared with the palmitoylation-intact wild-type receptor (16Percherancier Y. Planchenault T.

These examples present the evidence for a role of palmitoylation in protein membrane affinity and receptor turnover. In this report, we demonstrate that a pool of CD44 is associated with a cholesterol-rich microdomain of the plasma membrane and, that this association is dependent on the dual acylation of Cys286 and Cys295. Prevention of CD44 localization within lipid rafts does not interfere with the ability of the receptor to bind to hyaluronan but blocks hyaluronan internalization as well as the turnover/cycling of the receptor itself. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was obtained from Cellgro (Herndon, VA). Fetal bovine serum was purchased from HyClone (South Logan, UT). Specific primers for CD44 detection and mutagenesis were custom made by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). The expression plasmid construct, human pCD44H, was the same as described previously (7Jiang H. Peterson R.S. Wang W. Bartnik E. Knudson C.B. Knudson W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10531-10538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). pCDM8 and pTracer-SV40 vectors, the Flp-In stable transfectants system, l-glutamine, hygromycin, Lipofectamine 2000, and the anti-V5 monoclonal antibody were all obtained from Invitrogen.

Anti-human CD44 antibody BU-52 was purchased from ID Labs (London, Ontario, Canada). Luminol reagent was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and Clear Blue x-ray film from Pierce (Rockford, IL). The [3H]palmitate (45 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The nuclear stain, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride (DAPI) and NeutrAvidin-Texas Red were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Cyanine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Cy3-AffiPure H+L IgG) was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). The anti-flotillin-1 antibodies were obtained from BD Pharmingen (San Jose, CA). Biotinylated hyaluronan-binding protein was purchased from Seikagaku (Falmouth, MA). All other enzymes and chemicals, either for molecular biology or as reagent grade materials, were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture and Transfections—COS-7 cells (simian virus 40-transformed African green monkey epithelial cells, ATCC) and Flp-HEK 293 (human embryonic kidney epithelial kidney cells (Invitrogen) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. The COS-7 cells were transiently transfected as previously described (7Jiang H. Peterson R.S. Wang W. Bartnik E. Knudson C.B. Knudson W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10531-10538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) using Lipofectamine 2000 with cDNA encoding the hematopoietic isoform of human CD44 (CD44H) as well as various point mutation isoforms of CD44H (CD44-C286A, CD44-C286S, or CD44-C286,295A). In this study, CD44H will be denoted as wild-type CD44 or CD44wt. The CD44 cDNAs were all subcloned into pCDM8 plasmid vectors. All experiments in COS-7 cells were initiated 24 h post-transfection. Generation of CD44 Stable Transfectants—Stable transfectants expressing recombinant CD44H or various CD44H cysteine mutants were established using the Flp-In system. Briefly, sub-confluent HEK-293 cells, containing a single pre-engineered flp recombinase target site (FRT) within the genome, were co-transfected with an insert shuttle vector pCDNA5/FRT (carrying the CD44 cDNA insert) together with a plasmid expressing the Flp-recombinase enzyme (pOG44). The plasmid ratio of pCDNA5/FRT to pOG44 was 1:8, and the co-transfections were facilitated using Lipofectamine 2000. Five hours post-transfection the media was changed with fresh DMEM containing 20% fetal bovine serum. After 48 h of transfection, the cells were trypsinized and plated into four 100-mm dishes with fresh DMEM containing 5 mm l-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were allowed to recover for 4 h before addition of the selection medium containing DMEM, 5 mm l-glutamine, and 50 μg/ml hygromycin. Stable, hygromycin-resistant cells were selected for at least 2 weeks with media changes every third day. After 2 weeks of selection, small clusters of cell clones were isolated, allowed to expand, and assayed for expression of CD44 protein by immunoblotting. The use of the pCDNA5/FRT shuttle vector plasmid introduces a V5 epitope tag to the amino-terminal of the CD44 as a fusion protein. Generation of Point Mutations in CD44H—Point mutations were introduced into human CD44H cDNA cloned into a pCDM8 plasmid using the site-directed mutagenesis kit as previously reported (7Jiang H. Peterson R.S. Wang W. Bartnik E. Knudson C.B. Knudson W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10531-10538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Point mutations were used to modify CD44H Cys286 into alanine or serine and Cys295 into alanine. The forward primer for CD44-C286A was 5′-GCTTTGATTCTTGCAGTTGCCATTGCAGTAAGTCG-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-CGACTGTTGACTGCAATGGCAACTGCAAGAATCAAAGC-3′. The forward primer for CD44-C286S was 5′-GCTTTGATTCTTGCAGTTTCCATTGCAGTCAACAGTCG-3′, and the reverse primer was 5′-CGACTGTTGACTGCAATGGAAACTGCAAGAATCAAAGC-3′. To generate a double mutation, the CD44-C286A was used as a template and modified into a CD44-C286,295A using the forward primer 5′-CAGTCGAAGAAGGGCTGGGCAGAAGAAAAAGC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GCTTTTTCTTCTGCCCAGCCCTTCTTCGACTG-3′. All point mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis at the University of Illinois sequencing laboratory core facility. Incorporation of [3H]Palmitate into CD44—Various Flp-293 stable transfectants were plated at 2 × 106 cells/35-mm dish. Three days after plating the cells were serum-starved for 1 h and then incubated with 250 μCi of [3H]palmitate at 37 °C for 2 h. In some studies, the cells were preincubated with or without 50 μm 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) at 37 °C overnight prior to incubation with the [3H]palmitate. The labeled cells were washed with DMEM three times and lysed in 1 ml of cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) containing 1× protease inhibitor mixture for 30 min on ice. Lysates were clarified at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-V5 antibody and Sepharose-G beads overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation, suspended in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The acrylamide gel was then dehydrated in Me2SO, impregnated with 20% (w/v) of 2,5-diphenyloxazole in Me2SO and exposed to x-ray film at -80 °C for periods of 5-30 days (17Bonner W.M. Laskey R.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 46: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (5622) Google Scholar). Proteins bands were visualized using a Fluor-S Multimager and Quantity One 4.1.1 software (Bio-Rad). Optiprep Gradient Ultra Centrifugation—Flp-293 HEK stable and COS-7 transient transfectants, cultured in 60-mm dishes, were preincubated overnight with or without 50-100 μm 2-BP or; with or without 20 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (Mβ-CD) for 25-50 min. The cells were then washed with cold 1× PBS and lysed with 200 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% sucrose, 1% Triton X-100, and 1× protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails). The residual cell material was scraped into a microcentrifuge tube and, together with the lysate buffer, incubated on ice for 30 min. The cell lysate was then mixed directly with iodixanol stock solution (60% solution of Optiprep iodixanol) to yield a 40% (v/v) iodixanol concentration and layered at the bottom of the ultracentrifuge tubes. This was overlaid with equal volumes of 35%, 30%, 25%, 20%, and 0% iodixanol solution in lysis buffer without Triton X-100. All these operations were carried out on ice. The samples were centrifuged at 114,000 × g for 4 h at 4 °Cinan SW50.1 rotor (Beckman Coulter). Six equal volume fractions were then collected from the top down. Equivalent aliquots of each fraction were subjected to Western blotting using the anti-human CD44 antibody, BU-52 for COS-7 cell lysates, anti-V5 antibody for Flp-293 HEK cell lysates, and anti-flotillin-1 antibodies. Signal detection was performed using the Luminol reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein bands were visualized using a Fluor-S Multimager and Quantity One 4.1.1 software. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—COS-7 cells were co-transfected with various CD44H constructs subcloned into pCDM8 plasmids together with a red fluorescent protein-positive empty vector (pDsRed2-C1). In other experiments, CD44H subcloned into a green fluorescent protein-positive was used. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, the cells were incubated with or without 100 μg/ml cycloheximide for 3 h at 37°C in serum-free DMEM. At the end of the treatment, cells were released from the monolayer culture with a non-enzymatic cell dissociation solution and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were then blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin and 10% goat serum in PBS, followed by incubation with BU-52 monoclonal antibody (1:5,000 dilution, 0.0001 μg/m in 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Bound antibody was detected with cyanine-3-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody; 1:20,000 dilution in 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS (Cy3-AffiPure H+L IgG). To study the cellular accumulation of internalized CD44 protein, COS-7 transfectants were preincubated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide for 2 h followed by co-incubation of 100 μg/ml cycloheximide and 200 μg/ml chloroquine for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were trypsinized for 30 min, washed, fixed, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. At the end of each procedure, the cells were washed with PBS and mounted onto glass slides in media containing DAPI nuclear stain. Cells were visualized by using a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope equipped with Y-Fl Epi-fluorescence (Melville, NY), a 40× or 60× 1.4 numerical aperture oil-immersion objective and Texas Red (red), fluorescein isothiocyanate (green) and DAPI (blue) filters. Images were captured digitally in real-time using a Spot-RT camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI) and processed using MetaView imaging software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). As a means to quantify the results observed by immunofluorescence, cell lysates (using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer) were prepared from control or cycloheximide-treated COS-7 transfectants as described above. Aliquots of these cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-human CD44 antibody, BU-52. The binding and internalization of fluorescein-conjugated hyaluronan (Fl-HA) and hyaluronan decorated with biotinylated hyaluronan-binding protein probe (HABP) by COS-7 co-transfectants were as described previously (2Embry J. Knudson W. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 3431-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The binding of hyaluronan at the cell surface was visualized after 1 h of incubation of cells with Fl-HA at 4 °C. Internalized hyaluronan was visualized after 3 h of incubation of cells with Fl-HA at 37 °C, followed by trypsinization, fixation, and permeabilization. Biotinylated HABP was detected by the use of 1 μg/ml Neutr-Avidin-Texas Red in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 4°C. At the end of each procedure, the cells were washed with PBS and mounted onto glass slides in media containing the DAPI and visualized by using the Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope. CD44-mediated Internalization of Hyaluronan Is Dependent on Cholesterol-rich Lipid Rafts—To determine whether CD44 association with lipid rafts was required for hyaluronan endocytosis, the effect of cyclic polysaccharides that bind and chelate cholesterol from the plasma membrane, were tested. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the full-length CD44H and denoted as CD44wt. Following transfection the cells were pretreated with or without 10 mm Mβ-CD and monitored for the binding and internalization of Fl-HA. Typical Fl-HA binding was observed in control COS-7 transfectants (Fig. 1A, green fluorescence). Following trypsinization, internalization of Fl-HA could also be visualized (Fig. 1B) as we have shown previously (7Jiang H. Peterson R.S. Wang W. Bartnik E. Knudson C.B. Knudson W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10531-10538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Treatment with Mβ-CD appeared to have no obvious effect on Fl-HA binding (Fig. 1C) but completely blocked the internalization of Fl-HA (Fig. 1D). This suggests that cholesterol or cholesterol-rich microdomains within the plasma membrane are essential for the endocytosis of hyaluronan. A Subpopulation of CD44 Is Associated with Lipid Rafts—On Western blots, CD44 typically appears as a broad band with an average molecular mass of 85 kDa as seen in direct lysates obtained from five different hygromycin-selected colonies of Flp-293 cells (labeled as C1-C5, Fig. 2A). To determine whether CD44 itself was present in lipid raft microdomains of the plasma membrane, detergent lysates were isolated from transiently transfected COS-7 cells as well as Flp-293 cell-stable transfectants of CD44H. The cold-extracted cell lysates were subjected to ultracentrifugation in step gradients containing iodixanol prepared in lysis buffer without detergent and then analyzed on Western blots. As shown in Fig. 2B, a substantial proportion of the total immunoreactive CD44 isolated from COS-7 cells was present in the 20% iodixanol fraction. CD44 isolated from Flp-293 cells was dispersed throughout the gradient but also was present within the 20% iodixanol fraction (Fig. 2D). Lipid raft-associated proteins are localized within the 0 and 20% iodixanol fractions as illustrated by the standard marker protein, flotillin-1 (Fig. 2F). To further characterize the localization of CD44 in these gradients, the COS-7 and Flp-293 cells were pretreated with Mβ-CD prior to cell lysis. As shown in Fig. 2 (C and E), following the removal of cholesterol, none of the CD44 was present in the low density (0 or 20%) iodixanol fractions. Additionally, under these conditions the distribution of flotillin-1 also shifted to the higher density fractions (Fig. 1G). Previous studies had suggested that CD44 was palmitoylated through thioesterification at cysteine 286. To explore whether the presence of CD44 in the low density lipid raft-associated fraction was dependent on such acylation of the receptor, both transfected COS-7 and stable Flp-293 cells were pretreated with the palmitic acid analog 2-BP prior to cell lysis. As shown in Fig. 3A and 3B, respectively, the presence of the acylation inhibitor prevented the association of CD44 with the low density fractions. These results suggest that palmitoylation is necessary for CD44 to associate with the cholesterol-rich lipid raft fractions. However, the use of 2-BP is nonspecific and effects the palmitoylation of all membrane proteins. To determine whether CD44 acylation is specifically involved, the potential thioester site present on CD44, Cys286 was mutated to alanine 286 (C286A). In both transfected COS-7 cells and Flp-293 cell-stable transfectants, with CD44 containing the C286A mutation (CD44-C286A), little to no CD44 was present in the lipid raft-associated iodixanol fractions (Fig. 3, C and D, respectively). Nonetheless, a small fraction of CD44 was present in the 0 and 20% iodixanol of the transfected COS-7 cells suggesting that another CD44 amino acid might be palmitoylated. Given its proximity to the inner plasma membrane, CD44 cysteine 295 was considered another potential acylation site. This site was also mutated to an alanine and the double mutated CD44 (denoted as CD44-C286,295A), transfected into COS-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 3E, although the majority of the CD44 from these cells is present in the non-raft fractions, a small but still detectable presence of CD44 can be observed in the 0 and 20% iodixanol fractions. Nonetheless, it is clear that thioesterification of one or more of the cysteines of CD44 contribute to the association of CD44 with the low density lipid raft fractions. Palmitic Acid Incorporation into CD44—To provide more definitive evidence that CD44 undergoes palmitoylation, 3H-labeled palmitic acid incorporation into CD44 was assessed in Flp-293-stable transfectants of CD44wt. As shown in Fig. 4A, lane 2, fluorography gels of the isolated and immunoprecipitated CD44 depicted a single 3H-labeled band. When the Flp-293 cells were preincubated with 2-BP, no immunoprecipitated 3H-labeled band was detected (Fig. 4A, lane 1). This suggests that the 2-BP does block the acylation of CD44 and that the label is incorporated as palmitate. As a nonspecific control, Flp-293 cells engineered to stably express a different protein, human hyaluronidase-2, were also labeled with [3H]palmitic acid. Only background immunoprecipitated 3H-labeled bands were detected (Fig. 4A, lane 3), none in the size range of CD44. To validate the participation of cysteine residues in the palmitoylation of CD44, Flp-293 cells, stably transfected with CD44wt or CD44-C286A, were labeled with [3H]palmitic acid and processed for palmitate incorporation into CD44. The wild-type CD44 again exhibited a strong single 3H-labeled band (Fig. 4B, lane 2) whereas control Flp-293 cells (without stable CD44 transfection) did not (Fig. 4B, lane 1). Incorporation of [3H]palmitate into CD44-C286A was present but significantly reduced (Fig. 4B, lane 3). Image analysis densitometry determined the incorporation of palmitate into CD44-C286A was 55 ± 9% that of the wild-type CD44. The advantage of the Flp-293 cell system is that each selected line exhibits equivalent copy numbers of the desired transfected gene at the flp recombinase target site. However, to verify the expression equivalence of the two cell lines, the aliquots from the same lysates in Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 3, were probed by Western blotting. As can be seen in Fig. 4B, an equivalent level expression of CD44 is present in both Flp-293 cell-stable transfectants of CD44wt (lane 4) and CD44-C286A (lane 5). Therefore, the reduction in [3H]palmitate incorporation observed in Fig. 4B, lane 3, as compared with lane 2 is not due to differing expression of CD44. Given that CD44 exhibits close to two times the level of [3H]palmitate incorporation as CD44-C286A, there may be two acylated amino acids in the wild-type CD44. To investigate this possibility, [3H]palmitate incorporation into Flp-293 stably expressing the double mutant, CD44-C286,295A was compared with CD44wt and the CD44-C286A single mutant. As shown in Fig. 4C, the incorporation of [3H]palmitate into CD44-C286,295A (lane 2) was reduced by more than 50% (36 ± 7%) of control CD44 (Fig. 4C, lane 1). The incorporation was also substantially lower than that present in the single C286A mutant (Fig. 4C, lane 3) but, interestingly, not completely blocked. It is thus likely that other amino acids in addition to the two membrane-proximal cysteines also participate in CD44 acylation. Palmitic Acid Incorporation into CD44 Is Necessary for Hyaluronan Internalization—Fig. 1 suggested that the presence of cholesterol was necessary for CD44 internalization. To determine whether CD44 association with lipid rafts was required for hyaluronan internalization, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with CD44-C286S, another site-directed mutation of CD44 Cys286. COS-7 cells expressing wild-type CD44 bound Fl-HA (Fig. 5A), whereas no"
https://openalex.org/W1973867786,"G protein-coupled signaling is one of the major mechanisms for controlling cellular excitability. One of the main targets for this control at postsynaptic membranes is the G protein-coupled potassium channels (GIRK/Kir3), which generate slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials following the activation of Pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein-coupled receptors. Using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy combined with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), in intact cells, we provide evidence for the existence of a trimeric G protein-channel complex at rest. We show that activation of the channel via the receptor induces a local conformational switch of the G protein to induce channel opening. The presence of such a complex thus provides the means for a precise temporal and highly selective activation of the channel, which is required for fine tuning of neuronal excitability."
https://openalex.org/W2134634468,"Among flowering plants, animals commonly act as pollinators. We showed that fertile moss shoots attract springtails and mites, which in turn carry moss sperm, thereby enhancing the fertilization process. Previously, fertilization of mosses was thought to depend on the capacity of individual sperm to swim through a continuous water layer. The role of microarthropods in moss fertilization resembles the role of animals as pollinators of flowering plants but may be evolutionarily much older because of the antiquity of the organism groups involved."
https://openalex.org/W1973332688,"Because multiple laser shots are typically required to monitor ultrafast photochemical reaction dynamics, sample depletion and product accumulation have greatly restricted the range of substrates and structural environments amenable to study. By implementing a two-dimensional spatial delay gradient across the profile of a femtosecond probe pulse, we can monitor in a single laser shot organic crystalline reaction dynamics despite the formation of permanent photoproducts that cannot be conveniently removed. We monitored the photolysis of the triiodide anion, I 3 − , and subsequent recombination or relaxation of its reaction products, in three very different pure organic molecular crystals. The experimental results and associated molecular dynamics simulations illustrate the intimate connection between lattice structure and reaction dynamics, highlighting the role of lattice constraints in directing phase-coherent geminate recombination of photofragments within a crystalline reaction cage."

Although specific binding of dantrolene to the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR1), the Ca2+ release channel of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum, has been demonstrated, there is little evidence for direct dantrolene inhibition of RyR1 channel function. Recent studies suggest store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) contributes to skeletal muscle function, but the effect of dantrolene on this pathway has not been examined. Here we show that azumolene, an equipotent dantrolene analog, inhibits a component of SOCE coupled to activation of RyR1 by caffeine and ryanodine, whereas the SOCE component induced by thapsigargin is not affected. Our data suggest that azumolene distinguishes between two mechanisms of cellular signaling to SOCE in skeletal muscle, one that is coupled to and one independent from RyR1.

In humans, MH is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with incomplete penetrance, and the more than 80 mutations in RyR1 that have been identified appear in only about 50% of affected families (6Tilgen N.

Muscle bundles from MH-susceptible patients are hypersensitive to RyR1 agonists, including caffeine, Ca2+, and halothane (8Mortier W. Biesel C.

Thus, the loss of control of RyR1-mediated Ca2+ release likely contributes to the elevation of [Ca2+]i observed in MH patients. To date, the only effective treatment for MH is dantrolene sodium, a skeletal muscle relaxant, which suppresses the uncontrolled rise in myoplasmic Ca2+, presumably by targeting RyR1 and suppressing its Ca2+ channel activity (10Krause T.

Azumolene sodium is a structurally similar, equipotent analog of dantrolene, with an ∼30-fold greater water solubility (13Leslie G.C. Part N.J. Br. J.

Whereas hyperactivity or leakiness of the RyR1 channel has been described as the primary physiological defect in MH-susceptible muscle, the molecular mechanism underlying the suppression of [Ca2+]i by dantrolene remains controversial. Functional studies demonstrate partial inhibition of Ca2+ release from isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) (11Fruen B.R. Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. J. Biol.

Rodney G.G. Schneider M.F. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2005; 314: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, functional studies have been unable to unequivocally demonstrate direct inhibition of the RyR1 Ca2+ channel activity by dantrolene (12Nelson T.E. Lin M. Zapata-Sudo G. Sudo R.T. Anesthesiology. 1996; 84: 1368-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 17Szentesi P. Collet C. Sarkozi S. Szegedi C. Jona I. Jacquemond V. Kovacs L. Csernoch L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 355-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Sustained opening of RyR1 Ca2+ channels leads to reduction of the Ca2+ store within the SR lumen, a signal that activates store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) in skeletal muscle (18Shin D.W. Pan Z.

Nishi M. Takeshima H. Cheng H. Ma J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Recent evidence from heterologous expression systems supports a role for the amino-terminal cytoplasmic foot structure of RyR1 in coupling to channels possibly involved in SOCE (20Sampieri A. Diaz-Munoz M. Antaramian A. Vaca L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24804-24815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Additionally, elevated Ca2+ entry through cell surface Ca2+ channels with pharmacology similar to SOCE has been linked to the elevation of [Ca2+]i in muscular dystrophy (21Gailly P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1600: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The contribution of SOCE to MH and the potential effect of dantrolene on SOCE have not been examined. In this study, we test the hypothesis that azumolene can influence SOCE function. Using Ca2+-sensitive fluorescence measurements of RyR1-dependent intracellular Ca2+ transients and extracellular Ca2+ entry via SOCE, we show that azumolene inhibits SOCE both in skeletal muscle fibers and in cultured cells expressing RyR1. Our results reveal two modes of SOCE activation. One mode is RyR1-dependent and can be inhibited by the action of azumolene; the other is RyR1-independent and is insensitive to azumolene. Cell Culture—C1148 cells, a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing RyR1, were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin and streptomycin, and 0.5 mg/ml G-418 (22Bhat M.B. Zhao J. Zang W. Balke C.W. Takeshima H. Wier W.G. Ma J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 749-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Culture of C2C12 myogenic cells was described previously (23Shin D.W. Pan Z. Bandyopadhyay A. Bhat M.B. Kim D.H. Ma J. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2539-2549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Myotubes derived from C2C12 were used in experiments at day 5 of differentiation. Intracellular Ca2+ Measurement—C1148 cells were loaded with 10 μm Fura-2 AM (Invitrogen) for 45 min at 37 °C and allowed to de-esterify for 15 min at 25 °C. Cells were then harvested and resuspended in balanced salt solution (BSS) containing (in mm) the following: 140 NaCl, 2.8 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.2. 2.5 × 106 cells were transferred into the cuvette system of a PTI spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International, Princeton, NJ), and the changes in [Ca2+]i were measured as changes in the ratio of Fura-2 fluorescence at excitation wavelength of 350 nm (F350) and 380 nm (F380), following exposure to various concentrations of caffeine and ryanodine (C/R). For measurement in 0.5 mm EGTA, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in BSS without CaCl2, and 0.5 mm EGTA was added immediately before recordings. Measurement of Ca2+ in individual C2C12 myotubes was performed as described before (18Shin D.W. Pan Z. Kim E.K. Lee J.M. Bhat M.B. Parness J. Kim D.H. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3286-3292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). All experiments were conducted at 25 ± 2 °C. SOCE Assay; Mn2+ Quenching of Fura-2—Mn2+ is known to be able to permeate into cells via store-operated Ca2+ channels (SOC), but it is impervious to surface membrane extrusion processes or SR uptake by Ca2+ pumps. Hence, Mn2+ fluorescence quenching represents a measurement of unidirectional Ca2+ flux into cells via SOC (18Shin D.W. Pan Z. Kim E.K. Lee J.M. Bhat M.B. Parness J. Kim D.H. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3286-3292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 19Pan Z. Yang D. Nagaraj R.Y. Nosek T.A. Nishi M. Takeshima H. Cheng H. Ma J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Briefly, to measure the Mn2+ influx rate through the SOC machinery, thapsigargin (TG), or C/R, was applied to C1148 cells or C2C12 myotubes to induce SR Ca2+ depletion in 0 mm extracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]o), and 0.5 mm Mn2+ was then added to the extracellular solution. The quenching of Fura-2 fluorescence by Mn2+ was measured at the Ca2+-independent excitation wavelength of Fura-2 (360 nm). The decay of Fura-2 fluorescence upon Mn2+ addition was expressed as percent decrease in Fura-2 fluorescence per unit time (the initial fluorescence is set to be equal to 100%). For all measurements of SOCE by Mn2+ quenching, the maximally quenched fluorescence signal was established at the end of the experiment by lysing the cells with 1% Triton and was set equal to 0% fluorescence. Dissociation of Individual Flexor Digitorum Brevis (FDB) Fibers and Measurement of SOCE—FDB fibers were enzymatically dissociated from 2- to 4-month-old C57Bl6/J male mice, following the procedure described in our previous study (24Wang X. Weisleder N. Collet C. Zhou J. Chu Y. Hirata Y. Zhao X. Pan Z. Brotto M. Cheng H. Ma J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). For experiments performed at room temperature (25 ± 2 °C), individual muscle fibers were plated onto either uncoated (for TG treatment) or a silicon-coated ΔTC3 dish (for C/R treatment) and loaded with 10 μm Fura-2 AM at room temperature for 1 h. FDB fibers were then fastened by silicon drops at both ends to avoid contraction induced by C/R (25Collet C. Ma J. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 268-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For experiments performed at 35 °C, FDB fibers were plated on uncoated ΔT4 dishes, and the temperature was controlled by a thermal controller (Bioptechs Inc., Butler, PA). To prevent motion artifact in fibers associated with intracellular Ca2+ release, 20 μm N-benzyl-p-toluene sulfonamide (Sigma), a specific myosin II inhibitor (26Cheung A. Dantzig J.A. Hollingworth S. Baylor S.M. Goldman Y.E. Mitchison T.J. Straight A.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), was applied. Spatial and Temporal Resolution of SOCE in Skinned Muscle Preparation—The detailed procedure for the application of this methodology in SOCE measurement has been described before (27Zhao X. Yoshida M. Brotto L. Takeshima H. Weisleder N. Hirata Y. Nosek T.M. Ma J. Brotto M. Physiol. Genomics. 2005; 23: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, single muscle fibers are dissected from extensor digitorum longus muscle of C57Bl6/J mice and cultured for 72 h. For SOCE measurements, fibers were mechanically skinned in the presence of Rhod-5N potassium salt (Invitrogen) to trap the dye conjugated with Ca2+ into transverse tubules (T-tubule). For SR Ca2+ content assessment, the fiber was mechanically skinned in the absence of Rhod-5 and Ca2+ and then incubated with an intracellular-like solution (in mm, 140 potassium glutamate, 6.5 MgCl2, 6 creatine phosphatase, 0.5 CaCl2, 20 2-bromoethanesulfonate/BES-KOH) containing 0.2 mm EGTA and 20 μm Rhod-5N AM (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature to load the SR, followed by extensive washes and incubation for an additional 30 min to allow the complete deesterification of the dye. Treatment with 5 μm p-trifluoromethoxy carbonyl cyanide phenylhydrazone (FCCP) (Sigma) effectively eliminated the fluorescence signal from mitochondria. A Bio-Rad 2100 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) was used to resolve the spatial and temporal distribution of Rhod-5N inside the T-tubules or SR compartment as described in Zhao et al. (27Zhao X. Yoshida M. Brotto L. Takeshima H. Weisleder N. Hirata Y. Nosek T.M. Ma J. Brotto M. Physiol. Genomics. 2005; 23: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), with the following exception. The fiber was perfused with SR loading solution plus 20 μm azumolene or 0.1% Me2SO for 2 min. After that, the fiber was exposed to an SR-depleting solution (in mm, 100 potassium glutamate, 16 sodium glutamate, 20 EGTA-KOH, 5 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 0.07 MgCl2, 0.25 ATP, 1 creatine phosphatase, 10 BES-KOH) with C/R (30 mm/5 μm), in the presence of azumolene or Me2SO carrier for 1000 s. These experiments were repeated six times, and mean values of 10 regions of interest per fiber were analyzed. Rhod-5N intensity was normalized to the maximal loading intensity, prior to the onset of SR Ca2+ depletion. The above experiments were conducted at 25 ± 2 °C. Statistics—Values are mean ± S.E. Significance was determined by Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance. A value of p < 0.05 was used as criterion for statistical significance. Azumolene Inhibits Extracellular Ca2+ Entry in CHO Cells Stably Transfected with RyR1—C1148 is a cell line derived from CHO cells that are stably transfected with RyR1 (22Bhat M.B. Zhao J. Zang W. Balke C.W. Takeshima H. Wier W.G. Ma J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 749-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These cells contain functional RyR1 channel on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, in addition to the presence of an endogenous SOCE pathway. Thus, cell population assays (e.g. 2.5 × 106 cells) using a cuvette system can be applied to evaluate RyR1-mediated changes in intracellular Ca2+ signaling. As shown in Fig. 1, exposure of these cells to C/R leads to release of Ca2+ from the ER. C/R treatment results in complete depletion of the ER Ca2+ store, since it has been demonstrated previously that no further Ca2+ release is observed with subsequent addition of TG or ionomycin (28Pan Z. Damron D. Nieminen A.L. Bhat M.B. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19978-19984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). When the bath solution contains 2 mm Ca2+, the C/R-induced Ca2+ transient displays an initial peak followed by a sustained tail component. The peak is somewhat attenuated, and the sustained Ca2+ elevation is absent when the bath solution contains BSS without Ca2+ and 0.5 mm EGTA, which results in a nominally 0 mm [Ca2+]o. This indicates that extracellular Ca2+ entry contributes to the development of both the peak and the sustained component of the C/R-induced Ca2+ transient, although quite significantly to the latter. The sustained Ca2+ elevation observed in 2 mm [Ca2+]o could be substantially inhibited by 20 μm 2-aminodiphenyl borate, an inhibitor of SOCE (29Prakriya M. Lewis R.S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 536: 3-19Crossref Scopus (422) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Taken together, these results suggest that an endogenous SOCE pathway likely mediates the entry of extracellular Ca2+ following depletion of the C/R-dependent ER Ca2+ store in C1148 cells. To test the effects of azumolene on the RyR1-dependent Ca2+ signaling, azumolene was added to C1148 cells from a Me2SO stock solution. In the presence of 20 μm azumolene, the peak amplitude of C/R-induced Ca2+ transients (in 2 mm [Ca2+]o) was significantly reduced from F350/F380 = 0.37 ± 0.06 (in Me2SO carrier) to 0.20 ± 0.03 (plus azumolene). This is consistent with the previously reported partial inhibitory effect of dantrolene on RyR1-dependent Ca2+ transients in cells (17Szentesi P. Collet C. Sarkozi S. Szegedi C. Jona I. Jacquemond V. Kovacs L. Csernoch L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 355-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Significantly, the sustained post-peak elevation of Ca2+, which our results suggest is because of SOCE, was significantly reduced by the presence of azumolene. Note that the addition of azumolene leads to apparent instantaneous elevation of the Fura-2 signal, as shown in Fig. 1A, inset. This is because of the intrinsic autofluorescence of azumolene. The autofluorescence of azumolene displays a sharp peak at an excitation wavelength of 348 nm, and thus likely contributes to the apparent elevation of F350/F380 Fura-2 signal shown in Fig. 1A. To correct for the autofluorescence of azumolene, we subtracted the component of F350 Fura-2 fluorescence associated with azumolene addition in the calculation of F350/F380. As shown in Fig. 1B, the sustained component of Ca2+ transients was completely inhibited by azumolene. This observation led us to hypothesize that azumolene may suppress extracellular Ca2+ entry through SOCE. We next used Mn2+ quenching of Fura-2 fluorescence to test whether azumolene directly affects SOCE in C1148 cells. In this assay, Mn2+ is supplied to the extracellular solution, and its entry through SOC quenches the intracellular Ca2+-dependent Fura-2 fluorescence (30Weirich J. Dumont L. Fleckenstein-Grun G. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 31Choi S.Y. Kim K.T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 291: 107-114PubMed Google Scholar, 32Vazquez G. de Boland A.R. Boland R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33954-33960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Measurement of the decrease in Fura-2 fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm, the Ca2+-independent isosbestic point of Fura-2, provides an assessment of SOCE function. We found that preincubation of C1148 cells with 20 μm azumolene significantly reduced the rate of Mn2+ entry following depletion of the ER Ca2+ store with C/R (Fig. 1, C and D). These results directly demonstrate that azumolene is capable of inhibiting SOCE induced by C/R in CHO cells expressing RyR1. Azumolene Inhibits SOCE in C2C12 Myotubes—The effect of azumolene on SOCE was further evaluated in myotubes derived from the C2C12 mouse myogenic cell line. Differentiated C2C12 myotubes were treated with C/R for 5 min in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ to allow for complete depletion of the SR Ca2+ stores (18Shin D.W. Pan Z. Kim E.K. Lee J.M. Bhat M.B. Parness J. Kim D.H. Ma J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3286-3292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, individual myotubes treated with Me2SO (vehicle control) exhibited steep quenching of Fura-2 fluorescence because of Mn2+ influx. This defines the maximal C/R-triggered activation of SOCE measured in our system. C2C12 myotubes exposed to 20 μm azumolene prior to C/R stimulation exhibited an ∼70% reduction of SOCE compared with that of vehicle-treated control cells (Fig. 2, B and D). The peak amplitude of C/R-induced Ca2+ release in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ in C2C12 myotubes was not altered by azumolene (Fig. 2, A and B), with F360/F390 = 0.32 ± 0.03 in Me2SO control versus 0.28 ± 0.03 in azumolene-treated myotubes, a change that was not statistically significant (n = 8-11, p = 0.38). Thus, this decrease in SOCE in azumolene-treated C2C12 myotubes does not appear to result from an inhibition of SR Ca2+ release by azumolene. Interestingly, changing the order of drug treatment in the experimental protocol produces a significantly different result (Fig. 2C). Here, incubation of C2C12 myotubes with azumolene after C/R-initiated SR Ca2+ depletion resulted in loss of the inhibitory effect of the drug on SOCE (Fig. 2D, also compare Fig. 2, C and A). Me2SO carrier alone had no effect on the slope of Mn2+ quenching, regardless of the order of application. Because a significant decrease in the slope of Mn2+ quenching of Fura-2 fluorescence occurred only when azumolene was added prior to C/R stimulation, and not after, the effect of azumolene on SOCE in C2C12 myotubes may depend on the conformation of the RyR1 channel at the time of incubation with azumolene, if azumolene acts by binding to RyR1. Dose-dependent Effects of Azumolene on SOCE in C2C12 Myotubes—Our previous study showed that SOCE in fetal skeletal muscle can be activated in a graded manner by the reduction of SR Ca2+ store (25Collet C. Ma J. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 268-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To determine the effects of azumolene on the graded activation of SOCE in C2C12 myotubes, the quenching of Fura-2 by Mn2+ was monitored from the beginning of C/R-initiated SR Ca2+ release. As shown in Fig. 3A, myotubes pretreated with Me2SO exhibited a sigmoidal Mn2+ quench curve, reflecting the graded activation of SOCE that follows reduction of the SR Ca2+ store. Prior incubation of myotubes with 10 μm azumolene for 2 min led to significant delay in activation of SOCE and an altered slope of the Mn2+ quench curve. To quantify the graded activation of SOCE, the first-order derivative of changes in F360, dF360/dt, was determined (Fig. 3B). This analysis led to the definition of the following two kinetic parameters of SOCE in skeletal muscles: mmax, the peak slope of Mn2+ quenching, reflecting the maximum degree of SOCE activation; and Δτ, the delay time to reach mmax from the onset of Ca2+ release from SR after addition of C/R. Using this analysis, we conducted systematic studies to resolve the dose-dependent effect of azumolene on mmax and Δτ of SOCE in C2C12 myotubes. As shown in Fig. 3, C and D, the steepest range of azumolene effect on Δτ and mmax was observed between concentrations of 0.1 to 20 μm, a clinically relevant concentration range. Note that there appears to be a biphasic effect of azumolene on SOCE, e.g. a high affinity effect with an apparent Kd close to 2 μm, and a low affinity one that does not saturate under our experimental conditions. Azumolene Does Not Affect TG-induced Activation of SOCE—SR Ca2+ store in skeletal muscle can be depleted using other methods besides activation of RyR1 by C/R. TG, an inhibitor of the Ca2+-ATPase on SR, has been classically used to passively deplete the SR Ca2+ store to activate SOCE (19Pan Z. Yang D. Nagaraj R.Y. Nosek T.A. Nishi M. Takeshima H. Cheng H.

As shown in Fig. 4A, treatment of C2C12 myotubes with 10 μm TG for 5 min in a bath solution containing 0 [Ca2+]o led to depletion of SR Ca2+ stores that is not affected by azumolene treatment (p > 0.05). The F360/F390 equaled 0.27 ± 0.02 in Me2SO control versus 0.24 ± 0.02 in the azumolene-treated group. This SR Ca2+ depletion leads to maximum activation of SOCE, which is reflected in the steep Mn2+ quenching of Fura-2 fluorescence. In contrast to the results shown in Fig. 2A, we found that the TG-induced activation of SOCE was not affected by azumolene, e.g. the slope of Mn2+ quenching of Fura-2 fluorescence did not change significantly with the addition of azumolene (Fig. 4A). The ability of azumolene to discriminate between C/R- and TG-induced SR Ca2+ depletion suggests the existence of at least two pathways of SOCE activation in skeletal muscle, one RyR1-dependent and the other RyR1-independent. To further test this hypothesis, we performed the following studies. First, we tested whether there are additive effects of TG and C/R on SOCE activation in C2C12 myotubes. As shown in Fig. 4B, the slope of Mn2+ quenching induced by prior exposure to C/R did not increase following subsequent addition of TG, suggesting that TG does not induce additional activation of SOCE. The lack of additive effects of TG- and C/R-induced activation of SOCE in C2C12 myotubes was further demonstrated in Fig. 4C, where addition of C/R to a C2C12 myotube that was previously treated with TG also did not elicit additional activation of SOCE. Second, we tested whether C/R and TG mediation of SOCE involve interacting or parallel pathways in C2C12 myotubes by determining the effect of order of addition of the two sets of drugs on the parameters of SOCE and the effect of azumolene on these. As shown in Fig. 4B, the inhibitory effect of azumolene on C/R-induced SOCE in C2C12 myotubes could be completely overcome by subsequent treatment with TG. This result suggests that TG can maximally activate SOCE despite azumolene inhibition of RyR1-mediated SOCE, indicating the two pathways to SOCE are parallel and access the same store of SR Ca2+. Indeed, in the converse experiment, azumolene does not inhibit TG-induced SOCE, and subsequent addition of C/R does not appear to affect the degree of SOCE activation (Fig. 4C), supporting the argument for parallel pathways to SOCE activation. The data from multiple measurements summarized in Fig. 4D substantiate our conclusions. Although TG and C/R may share a final common target that leads to activation of SOCE, only the C/R-induced SOCE pathway is significantly affected by azumolene. Differential Effects of Azumolene on SOCE Activation in FDB Muscle Fibers—To complement our cell culture-based measurements of azumolene effects on SOCE, we tested azumolene in enzymatically dissociated FDB fibers from mice. For these measurements, we used 20 mm/5 μm C/R or 20 μm TG to deplete the SR Ca2+ store for maximum activation of SOCE. To prevent motion artifacts, we employed two techniques. First, the silicongrease method was used to immobilize the individual FDB fibers onto the culture dish (25Collet C. Ma J. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 268-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Second, N-benzyl-p-toluene sulfonamide, a specific myosin II inhibitor with minimum alteration of Ca2+ signaling (26Cheung A. Dantzig J.A. Hollingworth S. Baylor S.M. Goldman Y.E. Mitchison T.J. Straight A.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), was used to prevent muscle contraction associated with intracellular Ca2+ release. Similar to our results with C2C12 myotubes, we found that 20 μm azumolene could significantly inhibit C/R-activated SOCE (Fig. 5A) but not the TG-induced SOCE (Fig. 5B). The above analyses of the effect of azumolene on SOCE in FDB muscle fibers were all performed at room temperature (25 ± 2 °C) (Fig. 5C). Because previous studies have suggested that the effect of dantrolene on RyR-mediated Ca2+ release may display temperature dependence (33Ohta T. Ito S. Ohga A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 178: 11-19C"

Therefore, cellular factors that suppress this cell death are important for protection of the gastric mucosa from NSAIDs. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is up-regulated by various stressors and protects cells against stressors. Here, we have examined up-regulation of HO-1 by NSAIDs and the contribution of HO-1 to the protection of gastric mucosal cells against NSAIDs both in vitro and in vivo. In cultured gastric mucosal cells, all NSAIDs tested up-regulated HO-1. In rats, orally administered indomethacin up-regulated HO-1, induced apoptosis, and produced lesions at gastric mucosa. An inhibitor of HO-stimulated NSAID-induced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo and also stimulated NSAID-produced gastric lesions, suggesting that NSAID-induced up-regulation of HO-1 protects the gastric mucosa from NSAID-induced gastric lesions by inhibiting NSAID-induced apoptosis. Indomethacin activated the HO-1 promoter and caused nuclear accumulation of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a transcription factor for the HO-1 gene. Examination of phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and experiments with its inhibitor strongly suggest that the nuclear accumulation of Nrf2 and resulting up-regulation of HO-1 by NSAIDs is mediated through NSAID-dependent activation (phosphorylation) of p38 MAPK.

Ray W.A. Daugherty J.R. Griffin M.R. Am. J. Epidemiol. 1995; 141: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The anti-inflammatory actions of NSAIDs are mediated through their inhibitory effects on cyclooxygenase (COX) activity. COX is an enzyme essential for the synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs), which have a strong capacity to induce inflammation. On the other hand, NSAID use is associated with gastrointestinal complications (2Hawkey C.J. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 521-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), with about 15-30% of chronic users of NSAIDs suffering from gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeding (3Barrier C.H. Hirschowitz B.I. Arthritis Rheum. 1989; 32: 926-932PubMed Google Scholar, 4Fries J.F. Miller S.R. Spitz P.W. Williams C.A. Hubert H.B. Bloch D.A. Gastroenterology. 1989; 96: 647-655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Although PGs have a strong protective effect on gastrointestinal mucosa, the inhibition of COX by NSAIDs is not the sole explanation for the gastrointestinal side effects of NSAIDs (5Lichtenberger L.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that NSAIDs induce apoptosis in primary cultures of gastric mucosal cells in a manner independent of COX inhibition (6Tanaka K. Tomisato W. Hoshino T. Ishihara T.

Gastrointest Liver Physiol. 2001; 281: G1092-G1100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As for the molecular mechanism governing this apoptosis, we recently proposed that permeabilization of cytoplasmic membranes by NSAIDs stimulates Ca2+ influx which in turn induces production of the C/EBP homologous transcription factor (CHOP), and activates calpain, a Ca2+-dependent cysteine protease, both of which have apoptosis-inducing ability (6Tanaka K. Tomisato W. Hoshino T. Ishihara T. Namba T. Aburaya M. Katsu T. Suzuki K. Tsutsumi S. Mizushima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31059-31067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we suggested that both COX-inhibition and NSAID-induced cell death (such as apoptosis) in gastric mucosa are required for production of NSAID-induced gastric lesions in vivo (10Tomisato W. Tsutsumi S. Hoshino T. Hwang H.J. Mio M. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Cellular factors that suppress NSAID-induced apoptosis are therefore important for protection of gastric mucosa from NSAID-induced gastric lesions. When cells are exposed to various stressors, including NSAIDs, they induce a number of proteins, so-called stress proteins, in order to protect themselves against such stressors. Molecular chaperons are representative stress proteins. Their up-regulation in cells confers resistance to various stressors as the chaperons re-fold or degrade denatured proteins produced by stressors (11Mathew A. Morimoto R.I. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 851: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It has been shown that cytosolic molecular chaperones (such as heat shock proteins (HSPs)) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) molecular chaperons (such as glucose-regulated proteins (GRPs)) are up-regulated by NSAIDs and make cells resistant to NSAIDs (12Gehrmann M. Brunner M. Pfister K. Reichle A. Kremmer E. Multhoff G. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 3354-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13Tsutsumi S. Namba T. Tanaka K.I. Arai Y. Ishihara T. Aburaya M. Mima S. Hoshino T. Mizushima T. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 1018-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Furthermore, geranylgeranylacetone (GGA), the leading anti-ulcer drug on the Japanese market, has been reported to induce HSPs at gastric mucosa that protect gastric mucosal cells against NSAIDs and other gastric irritants (14Tomisato W. Takahashi N. Komoto C. Rokutan K. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Dig. Dis. Sci. 2000; 45: 1674-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 15Takano T. Tsutsumi S. Tomisato W. Hoshino T. Tsuchiya T.

Gastroenterology. 1996; 111: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is another type of stress protein. Not only its substrate, heme, but also various stressors such as oxidative stressors, ultraviolet irradiation, inflammatory cytokines, and heavy metals, have been reported to induce HO-1 production (18Ponka P. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1999; 318: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Maines M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar, 20Tenhunen R. Marver H.S. Schmid R. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6388-6394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HO-1 degrades heme to carbon monoxide (CO), free iron, and biliverdin. Biliverdin is subsequently converted into bilirubin by biliverdin reductase (18Ponka P. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1999; 318: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Maines M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar, 20Tenhunen R. Marver H.S. Schmid R. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6388-6394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bilirubin and biliverdin are potent antioxidants and CO has anti-apoptotic activity. Therefore, up-regulation of HO-1 in cells makes cells resistant to apoptosis induced by various stressors (19Maines M.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar, 20Tenhunen R. Marver H.S. Schmid R. J. Biol.

Med. 2000; 192: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). HO-1 is also known as HSP32; however, the mechanism governing regulation of its expression is different from that of other HSPs (22Chou Y.H. Ho F.M. Liu D.Z. Lin S.Y. Tsai L.H. Chen C.H. Ho Y.S. Hung L.F. Liang Y.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 37: 604-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). HO-1 is a phase II drug detoxifying enzyme. Such enzymes are regulated in a coordinated manner through a consensus cis-element and transcription factors, such as NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). HO-1-inducing stressors, such as reactive oxygen species, translocate Nrf2 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus where it binds to the consensus cis-element (Maf-recognition element (MARE)) to stimulate the transcription of genes located downstream (23Igarashi K. Kataoka K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1994; 367: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 24Ishii T. Itoh K. Takahashi S. Sato H. Yanagawa T. Katoh Y. Bannai S.

Kleeberger S.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). A number of kinases are involved in this activation (translocation) of Nrf2. They are mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). It has been suggested that the kinases involved in HO-1 up-regulation are different from each other depending on stressor and cell species (26Elbirt K.K. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Bonkovsky H.L. J.

In this study, we show that all NSAIDs tested up-regulate HO-1 in cultured gastric mucosal cells, possibly through the p38 MAPK-dependent nuclear accumulation of Nrf2. The results of experiments with a specific inhibitor of HO (Sn(IV) Mesoporphyrin, SnMP) suggest that this up-regulation contributes to the suppression of NSAID-induced apoptosis and NSAID-induced gastric lesions.

The experiments and procedures described here were carried out in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals as adopted and promulgated by the National Institute of Health, and were approved by the Animal Care Committee of Kumamoto University. Gastric Damage Assay—Gastric damage assays were performed as described previously (10Tomisato W. Tsutsumi S. Hoshino T. Hwang H.J. Mio M. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 575-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Rats, which had been fasted for 24 h, were intraperitoneally injected with SnMP (dissolved in 0.1 n NaOH, adjusted to pH 7.6 with HCl). One hour later, indomethacin in 1% methylcellulose was orally administered. Three hours after the oral administration, the rats were sacrificed by decapitation under light anesthesia with ethyl ether, and the stomachs were removed and scored for hemorrhagic damage by an observer unaware of the treatment the rats had received. Calculation of the scores involved measuring the area of all lesions in millimeters squared and summing the values to give an overall gastric lesion index. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Cell Viability Assay—Gastric mucosal cells were isolated from guinea pig fundic glands, as described previously (17Hirakawa T. Rokutan K. Nikawa T. Kishi K.

After removing non-adherent cells by washing with RPMI 1640, cells that were attached to the plate at ∼50% confluence were used. Guinea pig gastric mucosal cells prepared under these conditions have been previously characterized, with the majority (about 90%) of such cells being identified as pit cells (17Hirakawa T.

Human gastric carcinoma cells (AGS) were cultured in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. Unless otherwise noted, cells (0.8 × 104 cells per well in 24-well plates, 4 × 104 cells per well in 6-well plates, 6 × 105 cells in 100-mm plates) were cultured for 24 h and then used in the experiments. Transfection of cells with plasmid was carried out using Lipofectamine (TM2000) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were used for experiments after a 24-h recovery period. Transfection efficiency was determined in parallel plates by transfection of cells with the pEGFP-C1 control vector. Transfection efficiency was more than 80% in all experiments. NSAIDs were dissolved in Me2SO or Na2CO3 (for indomethacin only) and control experiments (without NSAIDs) were performed in the presence of the same concentrations of Me2SO or Na2CO3. Cells were exposed to NSAIDs by changing the medium. Cell viability was determined by the MTT method. Immunoblotting Analysis—Whole cell extracts and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (36Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W.

Samples were applied to 8% (HSP72 and GRP78), 10% (lamin B, Nrf2, p38 MAPK, and actin) or 12% (HO-1) polyacrylamide SDS gels, subjected to electrophoresis, and proteins then immunoblotted with appropriate antibodies. Luciferase Assay—The luciferase assay was performed as described previously (7Tsutsumi S. Gotoh T. Tomisato W. Mima S. Hoshino T. Hwang H.J. Takenaka H. Tsuchiya T. Mori M. Mizushima T. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 1009-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with 0.375 μgof each of the P. pyralis luciferase reporter plasmids (pHO15luc or its vector) and 0.125 μg of the internal standard plasmid bearing the R. reniformis luciferase reporter (pRL-SV40). P. pyralis luciferase activity in cell extracts was measured using the Dual Luciferase Assay System and then normalized for R. reniformis luciferase activity. Histological and Immunohistochemical Analysis—Gastric tissue samples were fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde, embedded in O.C.T. compound and cryosectioned. Sections were stained first with Mayer's hematoxylin and then with 1% eosin alcohol solution for histological examination (hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining). Samples were mounted with Malinol and inspected using microscopy (Olympus IX70). For immunohistochemical analysis, sections were blocked with 2.5% goat serum for 10 min and then incubated for 12 h with antibody against HO-1 (1:500 dilution) in the presence of 2.5% bovine serum albumin, and finally incubated for 1 h with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G. Samples were mounted with VECTASHIELD and inspected using fluorescence microscopy (Olympus IX70). TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin End-labeling (TUNEL) Assay— Gastric tissue samples were fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde, embedded in O.C.T. compound and cryosectioned. Sections were first incubated with protenase K (10 μg/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C, then with TdTase and biotin 14-ATP for 1 h at 37 °C and finally with Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated with streptavidin for 1 h. Samples were mounted with VECTASHIELD and inspected using fluorescence microscopy (Olympus IX70). Measurement of HO Activity—Enzymatic activity of HO was determined as described previously (38Tenhunen R. Marver H.S. Schmid R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 61: 748-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (1481) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Sample preparation from cultured cells: Cells were lysed by freeze-thawing and sonication in the 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were applied to the HO assay system (see below). Sample preparation from gastric mucosa: Gastric mucosal cells prepared from rats were homogenized in the 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.25 m sucrose, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were further centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 60 min. The precipitates were resuspended with the 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m KCl and applied to the HO assay system (see below). HO Assay System—After determination of the protein concentration, samples were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in the dark with the following reagents: heme (17 μm), rat liver cytosol (10 mg/ml), MgCl2 (2 mm), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (4 units), glucose 6-phosphate (0.85 mm), and β-NADP (2 mm) in 0.6 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The reaction was stopped by placing the tubes on ice. The amount of bilirubin generated was estimated with a scanning spectrophotometer and was defined as the difference between 452 and 530 nm. The HO activity is expressed as pmol of bilirubin per milligram of protein per hour. Caspase Activity Assay—The activity of caspase-3 was determined as described previously (39Hoshino T. Tsutsumi S. Tomisato W. Hwang H.J. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12752-12758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were collected by centrifugation and suspended in extraction buffer (50 mm PIPES (pH 7.0), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Suspensions were sonicated and centrifuged, after which the supernatants were incubated with fluorogenic peptide substrates (acetyl-DEVD-methylcoumarin amide) in reaction buffer (100 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 15 min at 37 °C. The release of aminomethylcoumarin (AMC) was determined using a fluorescence spectrophotometer. One unit of protease activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to release 1 pmol of AMC/min. Measurement of the Intracellular Ca2+ Level—Intracellular Ca2+ levels were monitored as described (6Tanaka K. Tomisato W. Hoshino T. Ishihara T. Namba T. Aburaya M. Katsu T. Suzuki K. Tsutsumi S. Mizushima T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31059-31067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with 4 μm fluo-3/AM in assay buffer supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.04% Pluronic F127 and 2 mm probenecid, for 40 min at 37 °C. After washing twice with assay buffer, cells were suspended in assay buffer supplemented with 2 mm probenecid. Cells were transferred to a water-jacketed cuvette and the fluo-3 fluorescence was then measured with a HITACHI F-4500 spectrofluorophotometer. The intracellular Ca2+ level was calculated according to the equation [Ca2+]i = Kd(F - Fmin)/(Fmax - F), where Kd is the apparent dissociation constant (400 nm) of the fluorescent dye-Ca2+ complex. Statistical Analysis—All values are expressed as the mean ± S.D. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Scheffe's multiple comparison test was used for evaluation of differences between groups. The Student's t test for unpaired results was used for the evaluation of differences between two groups. Differences were considered to be significant for values of p < 0.05. NSAIDs Up-regulate HO-1—Up-regulation of HO-1 production by NSAIDs was examined in primary cultures of guinea pig gastric mucosal cells. This type of cell has been used as an in vitro model for physiological and pathological studies of gastric mucosa, because various characteristic features of gastric mucosal cells in vivo (such as vigorous secretion of mucin) are reproduced in this system (17Hirakawa T. Rokutan K. Nikawa T. Kishi K. Gastroenterology. 1996; 111: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, treatment of cells with indomethacin up-regulated HO-1 very rapidly (within 3 h of the addition of indomethacin) and transiently (HO-1 levels returned to pre-treatment levels 24 h after the addition). Indomethacin is known to up-regulate other stress proteins (HSPs and GRPs) (12Gehrmann M. Brunner M. Pfister K. Reichle A. Kremmer E. Multhoff G. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 10: 3354-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13Tsutsumi S. Namba T. Tanaka K.I. Arai Y. Ishihara T. Aburaya M. Mima S. Hoshino T. Mizushima T. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 1018-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 1A show that up-regulation of HO-1 by indomethacin occurs prior to that of HSP72 and GRP78. Fig. 1B shows the effects of different doses of indomethacin on HO-1 up-regulation. Up-regulation of HO-1 was just apparent at 25-50 μm indomethacin and was distinct at 200-400 μm indomethacin. These concentrations of indomethacin did not affect cell viability (Fig. 1C), showing that up-regulation of HO-1 by indomethacin is not the result of indomethacin-induced cell damage. On the other hand, up-regulation of HSP72 and GRP78 required much higher concentrations of indomethacin (Fig. 1B); in other words, up-regulation of these proteins occurs simultaneously with cell damage (Fig. 1C). We also examined up-regulation of HO-1 by other NSAIDs (diclofenac, ibuprofen, aspirin, flurbiprofen, celecoxib, and loxoprofen). All of the NSAIDs tested up-regulated HO-1 (Fig. 2) at concentrations that did not affect cell viability (data not shown). As was the case for indomethacin, some NSAIDs (diclofenac and flurbiprofen) showed two peaks in their dose response profile of HO-1 up-regulation (Fig. 2). COX exists as two subtypes, COX-1 and COX-2, for which celecoxib and flurbiprofen are COX-2-selective in"
https://openalex.org/W2124368930,"RGS2, one of the small members of the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) family, is highly expressed in brain and regulates G(i/o) as well as G(q)-coupled receptor pathways. RGS2 modulates anxiety, aggression, and blood pressure in mice, suggesting that RGS2 regulates synaptic circuits underlying animal physiology and behavior. How RGS2 in brain influences synaptic activity is unknown. We therefore analyzed the synaptic function of RGS2 in hippocampal neurons by comparing electrophysiological recordings from RGS2 knockout and wild-type mice. Our study provides a general mechanism of the action of the RGS family containing RGS2 by demonstrating that RGS2 increases synaptic vesicle release by downregulating the G(i/o)-mediated presynaptic Ca(2+) channel inhibition and therefore provides an explanation of how regulation of RGS2 expression can modulate the function of neuronal circuits underlying behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2149411071,"Vanadium phosphates are important catalysts for the oxidation of alkanes, and commercial catalysts comprise a complex range of V 4+ and V 5+ phosphates. We used three complementary in situ characterization methodologies—powder x-ray diffraction and laser Raman and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies—to show that the metastable phase ω-VOPO 4 is very sensitive to many of the reactants and products of butane oxidation. A rapid transformation from ω-VOPO 4 to δ-VOPO 4 occurs on exposure to butane at the reaction temperature, and hence the metastable ω-VOPO 4 may play a role in the formation of commercial catalysts."
https://openalex.org/W1974598255,"The laminin α1 chain is a subunit of laminin-1, a heterotrimeric basement membrane protein. The LG4-5 module at the C terminus of laminin α1 contains major binding sites for heparin, sulfatide, and α-dystroglycan and plays a critical role in early embryonic development. We previously identified active synthetic peptides AG73 and EF-1 from the sequence of lamininα1 LG4 for binding to syndecan and integrin α2β1, respectively. However, their activity and functional relationship within the laminin-1 and LG4 as well as the functional relation between these sites and α-dystroglycan binding sites in LG4 are not clear. To address these questions, we created mutant recombinant LG4 proteins containing alanine substitutions within the AG73 (M1), EF-1 (M2, M3), and α-dystroglycan binding sites (M4, M5) and analyzed their activities. We found that recombinant proteins rec-M1 and rec-M5, containing mutations within M1 and M5, respectively, did not bind heparin or lymphoid cell lines expressing syndecans. These results suggest that LG4 binds to heparin and syndecans through M1 and M5. Rec-M1 and rec-M5 reduced fibroblast attachment, whereas mutant rec-M2 and rec-M3 retained cell attachment activity but did not promote cell spreading. Fibroblast attachment to rec-LG4 was inhibited by heparin but not by integrin antibodies. Spreading of fibroblasts on rec-LG4 was inhibited by anti-integrin α2 and β1 but not by anti-integrin α1 and α6. These results suggest that the M1 and M5 sites are necessary for cell attachment on LG4 through syndecans and that the EF-1 site is for cell spreading activity through integrin α2β1. In contrast, laminin-1-mediated fibroblast attachment and spreading were not inhibited by heparin or antiintegrin α2. Our findings indicate that LG4 has a unique function distinct from laminin-1 and suggest that laminin α1 LG4-5 may also be produced by a proteolytic cleavage in certain tissues where it exerts its activity.

Laminins are heterotrimeric basement membrane proteins that exert multiple biological functions through interactions with extracellular matrix molecules and with cell surface receptors. The regulation of these interactions are critical to many biological processes, including cell adhesion and migration, angiogenesis, tumor progression, and neurite outgrowth (1Patarroyo M.

Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 255-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). The five laminin α chains share a large module at their C-terminal region (G domain), which contains five laminin G domain-like modules (LG1-5), and each module consists of about 200 amino acids (3Sasaki M.

These studies revealed that the AG73 activities and sequence are unique in the α1 chain and that EF-1 is the only peptide active for integrin binding among the homologous peptides from other α chains. However, it is uncertain whether these sites are active in the LG4 and laminin-1 proteins. Mutagenesis analysis with recombinant laminin α1 LG4 revealed that two sequences, EYIKRK (K1 site, residues 2789-2793) and GKGRTK (K3 site, residues 2766-2770), which are located downstream of the AG73 and EF-1 sites, are active for heparin and α-dystroglycan binding of LG4 (22Andac Z. Sasaki T. Mann K. Brancaccio A. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that laminin α1 LG4 has several active sites and multiple biological functions through interacting with extracellular matrix and cell surface receptors. However, functional relationships between these active sites have not been elucidated. Laminin α1 knock-out mice die around embryonic day E7.5 due to the lack of Reichert's membrane and defective epiblast polarization (23Miner J.H. Li C. Mudd J.L. Go G. Sutherland A.E. Development. 2004; 131: 2247-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Recently, mutant mice that express a truncated laminin-1 molecule that is specifically missing the LG4-5 portion of the laminin α1 chain were generated (24Schéele S. Falk M. Franzén A. Ellin F.

The mutant mice die from defective Reichert's membrane, just like the laminin α1 knock-out mice. In addition, the ectoplacental cone of wild-type mice stain with antibodies specific to laminin α1 LG4 but not to the N terminus or to LG1-3, suggesting that laminin α1 may be cleaved to generate the LG4-5 molecule in vivo, as observed in laminin α2 (25Talts J.F.

Taken together, these results suggest that the laminin α1 LG4-5 tandem module is critical for mouse embryogenesis and may also serve as a distinct functional unit apart from the whole laminin-1 molecule in certain tissues. In this report we prepared recombinant mouse laminin α1 LG4 proteins, which contained site-specific mutations within the AG73, EF-1, K1, and K3 sites and analyzed their activities for binding to heparin, syndecans, and integrins in relation to their activities for cell attachment and spreading. We found that the critical residues of the AG73 and α-dystroglycan binding sites are very closely located in the predicted three-dimensional structure and also bind to syndecan. On the other hand, the EF-1 site is not essential for cell attachment but is required for cell spreading through integrin α2β1 binding. This site is positioned on the opposite side from the syndecan binding sites in the LG4 module. Inhibition assays revealed that the laminin α1 LG4 module has a unique function distinct from the whole laminin-1 molecule. Our results suggest that the AG73 and α-dystroglycan sites within LG4 have an overlapping function, and the EF-1 site exerts its activity for cell spreading in concert with the AG73 and α-dystroglycan sites.

The following amino acid residues of the laminin α1 LG4 module were substituted with alanine: Arg-2719, Lys-2720, and Arg-2721 within the AG73 site, Arg-2757 and Asp-2763 within the EF-1 site, and Lys-2766, Arg-2768, and Lys-2770 and Lys-2791, Arg-2792, and Lys-2793 within α-dystroglycan binding site. And mutate sites are named from M1 to M5 through the N to C terminus, and recombinant proteins were rec-M1 to -M5. All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. The expression vector for the LG4 module, pCEP4-Mul-PURD, is a modified vector of pCEP4-WT-His (33Wilson R. Freddi S. Chan D. Cheah K.S. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15544-15552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), a derivative of pCEP4 (Invitrogen), and contains a BM-40 signal peptide, a hexahistidine tag, and a multicloning site along with the cytomegalovirus promoter and enhancer. In this vector the original hygromycin resistance gene was replaced by the puromycin resistance sequence from the pPUR vector (BD Bioscience). HindIII site in puromycin was deleted by the fill-in method using the DNA Blunting Kit (Takara, Ohtsu, Japan), and the hygromycin resistance gene was replaced in pCEP4 by PURD at SpeI and NruI. Various mutated laminin α1 LG4 module sequences were cloned into the HindIII and NotI sites of pCEP4-Mul-PURD. Site-directed mutagenesis of LG4-5 was also performed similar to LG4. Three amino acids, Arg-2719, Lys-2720, and Arg-2721, within AG73 were substituted with alanine individually or all together. The mutant LG4-5 sequences were cloned into the HindIII and XhoI sites of pSecTag2/Hygro B (Invitrogen). The recombinant proteins were prepared as previously reported (34Nielsen P.K. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10906-10912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The recombinant LG4 expression vectors were transfected into 293 EBNA cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). The transfected cells were maintained for 2 days, then split at a 1:6 ratio in 10% FBS in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated with 5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) for 3 days for selection. The selected cells were maintained with 0.5 μg/ml puromycin. To prepare recombinant proteins, nearly confluent cells were cultured without serum for 3 days, and the condition medium was collected. The medium was cleared of debris by centrifugation, and Complete EDTA-free (Roche Applied Science) was added to decrease proteolysis. Nickel-charged agarose resins (Probond, Invitrogen) were equilibrated with Dulbecco's PBS (D-PBS; Invitrogen), pH 8.0, containing 10 mm imidazole and added to the conditioned medium. After incubation at 4 °C for 60 min, the resins were transferred to a column and washed with D-PBS, pH 8.0, containing 20 mm imidazole. His-tagged laminin α1 LG4 module recombinant proteins were eluted with D-PBS, pH 8.0, containing 250 mm imidazole. Purified proteins were dialyzed against D-PBS and quantified using the BCA protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard (Pierce). Purity was determined by reducing SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie G-250 Blue (GelCode Blue, Pierce) staining and judged to >95%. Synthetic Peptides—The peptides AG73 and EF-1 were manually synthesized with an amide at the C terminus by the Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) strategy as previously described (17Suzuki N. Nakatsuka H. Mochizuki M. Nishi N. Kadoya Y. Utani A. Oishi S. Fujii N. Kleinman H.K. Nomizu M. J. Biol.

Purity and identity of the peptides were confirmed by an analytical high performance liquid chromatography and an electrospray ionization mass spectrometer at the Central Analysis Center, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Science. Biotinylated Heparin Binding Assay—Heparin binding assays were performed in 96-well round-bottomed microtiter plates (Immulon-2HB, Dynax Technologies, Inc., Chantilly, VA) as previously described (15Hoffman M.P. Engbring J.A. Nielsen P.K. Vargas J. Steinberg Z. Karmand A.J. Nomizu M. Yamada Y. Kleinman H.K. J. Biol.

Wells were coated with recombinant laminin α1 LG4 proteins in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm CaCl2 overnight at 4 °C, and then biotinylated heparin, with an average mass of 12.5 kDa (Heparin-BH, Celsus Laboratories, Inc., Cincinnati, OH), was detected with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Invitrogen). After incubation with the enzyme substrate (TMB-ELIZA, Pierce), the reaction was stopped by 1 m H2SO4, and the absorbance at 450 nm was measured. Antibodies—Mouse monoclonal antibodies against human integrins α1 (FB12), α2 (P1E6), and β1 (6S6), rat monoclonal antibody against human integrin α6 (NKI-GoH3), and rabbit polyclonal antibody against human integrin α2 were purchased from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). Mouse monoclonal antibody against human vinculin (hVIN-1) was purchased from Sigma, and Cy3-conjugated AffiniPure F(ab′)2 fragment donkey anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Glove, PA). Cell Attachment Assay—96-Well round-bottomed microtiter plates (Immulon-2HB) were coated with recombinant proteins or laminin-1 from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) tumor (Sigma) in 50 μl of D-PBS overnight at 4 °C and then blocked for 60 min at RT with 200 μl of heat-denatured (30 min at 70 °C) Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma, 1% blocking solution) and washed twice with 0.1% blocking solution. Protein coating efficiency of recombinant proteins was measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using His-tag antibody. These results showed that all recombinant proteins bound dishes at almost equal coating efficiency (less than a 2% difference). ARH-77 cell lines were cultured in suspension, washed twice with 0.1% blocking solution, and resuspended in a concentration of 2 × 105 cells/ml. Human foreskin fibroblasts were detached with 0.02% trypsin, EDTA (Invitrogen). Cell suspension was diluted with an equal volume of 10% FBS in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to inhibit trypsin and resuspended and incubated in 10% FBS-containing media at 37 °C for 20 min to recover the cells. Then cells were washed twice and resuspended in 0.1% blocking solution and used for attachment assays. 2 × 104 cells/100 μl cells were added to the wells and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Wells were stained for 10 min with 0.2% crystal violet (Sigma) in 20% methanol. After washing with H2O, plates were dried overnight at RT. Cells were dissolved in 1% SDS (150 μl), and the absorbance at 570 nm was measured. Each sample was assayed in triplicate, and cells attached to the bovine serum albumin substrate were subtracted from all measurements. For inhibition of cell attachment with heparin, EDTA, peptides, and anti-integrin antibodies, fibroblasts were first incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in the presence of either 10 μg/ml heparin, 5 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml peptides, or 10 μg/ml antibodies, respectively, and then incubated and measured as described above. Cell Spreading Assay—Glass Chamber Slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) were coated with proteins (3 μg/well) and prepared as described for the cell attachment assay. Human foreskin fibroblasts (2 × 103 cells/well) were added to the wells and incubated for 150 min at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. After washing with prewarmed D-PBS containing calcium and magnesium (Invitrogen), cells were fix with 4% paraformaldehyde D-PBS for 10 min at 37 °C. Fixed cells were mounted with GEL/MOUNT (Biomeda, Foster City, CA) and examined under an Axiovert 135 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) equipped with an AxioCam HRc CCD camera (Carl Zeiss). Digital images were obtained using MetaMorph 6.16 software. Immunofluorescence Assay of Cultured Cells—Fibroblasts were prepared as described for the spreading assay. Cells were fixed and permeabilized with prewarmed D-PBS containing calcium and magnesium (Invitrogen), 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 5% sucrose for 3 min at 37 °C. Then, for further fixation, slides were treated with 2% paraformaldehyde containing 5% sucrose D-PBS with calcium and magnesium for 10 min at 37 °C and blocked in D-PBS, 20% donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.), and Mouse on Mouse (MOM) blocking reagent (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) as recommended by the manufacturer. Cells were incubated with anti-vinculin or integrin antibody in D-PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, and 7% MOM protein concentrate (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) to 10 μg/ml for 60 min at RT or 4 °C overnight. Bound antibodies and F-actin were visualized by secondary antibody diluted to 1:100 and Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin (Invitrogen) diluted to 1:100 in D-PBS, 5% donkey serum, and 0.05% Tween 20 for 30 min at RT. After washing, cells were mounted with VECTASHIELD (Vector Laboratories) and examined under a LSM510 fluorescent confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss). Mutant Recombinant Laminin α1 LG4 and LG4-5 Proteins—Laminin α1 LG4-5 contains two tandem repeat modules, LG4 and LG5. We first prepared recombinant LG4-5, LG4, and LG5 modules of laminin α1 and tested their activity for cell attachment. LG4-5 and LG4 promoted cell attachment, but LG5 did not (see Fig. 3B and data not shown). These results suggest that LG4 plays a critical role for cell binding activity of laminin α1 LG4-5. We, therefore, primarily focused on the LG4 module in this study. We prepared five mutant LG4 proteins (rec-M1 to M5) with alanine substitutions; rec-M1 has a mutation within the AG73 sequence, rec-M2/-M3 has a mutation within the EF-1 sequence, and rec-M4/-M5 has a mutation within α-dystroglycan binding regions (Fig. 1A, Table 1). Mutant rec-M1 protein has alanine substitutions at three consecutive positively charged residues, Arg-2719, Lys-2720, and Arg-2721 (M1 site), within AG73 that were shown to be critical for peptide AG73 cell attachment and heparin binding activity (14Hoffman M.P.

Mutant rec-M2 and rec-M3 proteins contained a single alanine substitution at Arg-2757 (M2 site) and Asp-2763 (M3 site) within the EF-1 sequence, respectively, which were important for peptide EF-1 integrin α2β1 binding activity (17Suzuki N. Nakatsuka H. Mochizuki M. Nishi N. Kadoya Y. Utani A. Oishi S. Fujii N. Kleinman H.K. Nomizu M. J. Biol.

In addition, two mutant proteins, rec-M4 and rec-M5, were created within α-dystroglycan binding sites by alanine substitutions at the three positively charged residues in each site, Lys-2766, Arg-2768, and Lys-2770 (M4 site) and Lys-2791, Arg-2792, and Lys-2793 (M5 site), respectively (22Andac Z. Sasaki T. Mann K. Brancaccio A. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We also created four mutations within the M1 site of AG73 in recombinant LG4-5; alanine was substituted at residues Arg-2719, Lys-2720, and Arg-2721 either singly or all together. These mutant proteins were purified from the conditioned media of 293 EBNA cells or Cos7 cells that had been transfected with the expression vectors as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purified proteins showed a single band with 95% purity in SDS-PAGE analysis under a reduced condition and also under a nonreduced condition (Fig. 1B).TABLE 1Mutant recombinant laminin α1 LG4 proteinsMutantAlanine mutated sequence positionsaThe sequence positions and sites are from Andac et al.

Here we show that despite the absence of these events, caspase-9 activation is essential for cephalostatin 1-induced apoptosis. Cephalostatin 1 initiates a rapid endoplasmic reticulum stress response characterized by phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 α-subunit and increased expression of the chaperone immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein GRP78 as well as the transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP)/GADD153. Cephalostatin 1 activates apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). However, this pathway does not play a major role in cephalostatin 1-induced apoptosis, as assessed by stable expression of a dominant negative apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1. Importantly, the endoplasmic reticulum-associated caspase-4 is required and as shown by biochemical and genetic inhibition experiments, acts upstream of caspase-9 in cephalostatin-induced apoptosis.

Apoptosis dysregulation represents an important contribution to the development of cancer as well as chemoresistance. Moreover, a wide range of chemotherapeutic drugs induces death in malignant cells by inducing apoptosis (1Kim R. Cancer. 2005; 103: 1551-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 2Herr I. Debatin K.M. Blood. 2001; 98: 2603-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Two major pathways leading to apoptosis have been elucidated: one triggered by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) 3The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; Apaf-1, apoptosis activating factor-1; ASK1, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1; BiP, immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein; BiP/GRP78, 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein; CHOP, C/EBP homologous protein; GADD153, growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene 153; TG, thapsigargin; ETO, etoposide; eIF2α, eukaryotic initiation factor 2 α-subunit; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; IRE1, inositol requiring 1; TM, tunicamycin; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TRAF2, TNF receptor-associated factor 2; UPR, unfolded protein response; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone. 3The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; Apaf-1, apoptosis activating factor-1; ASK1, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1; BiP, immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein; BiP/GRP78, 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein; CHOP, C/EBP homologous protein; GADD153, growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene 153; TG, thapsigargin; ETO, etoposide; eIF2α, eukaryotic initiation factor 2 α-subunit; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; IRE1, inositol requiring 1; TM, tunicamycin; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TRAF2, TNF receptor-associated factor 2; UPR, unfolded protein response; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone./Fas family receptors and the other mediated by mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and other proteins (1Kim R.

However, damage or stress in many organelles (besides mitochondria) may trigger apoptosis through mechanisms, which remain partially unclear (4Ferri K.F. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E255-E263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). In this respect, a pathway of apoptosis induction has been linked to stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (5Breckenridge D.G. Germain M. Mathai J.P. Nguyen M. Shore G.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8608-8618Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 6Kadowaki H. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. J. Chem. Neuroanat. 2004; 28: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 7Momoi T. J. Chem. Neuroanat. 2004; 28: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 8Rao R.V. Ellerby H.M. Bredesen D.E. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). ER stress leads to the activation of genes possessing an unfolded protein response (UPR) element, which controls the levels of molecular chaperones, such as Mr 78,000 glucose-regulated stress protein (BiP/GRP78) involved in protein folding in the ER (9Schroder M. Kaufman R.J. Mutat. Res. 2005; 569: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF2) is phosphorylated by the PKR-like ER-localized eIF2α kinase (PERK) in response to ER stress leading to an attenuation of translational initiation and protein synthesis (8Rao R.V. Ellerby H.M. Bredesen D.E. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). When these stress modulators are unable to rescue cells, various apoptotic pathways are activated. Recruitment of TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) to activated stress sensor proteins, called IREs, induces the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascade (6Kadowaki H. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. J. Chem. Neuroanat. 2004; 28: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In addition, ER-specific caspases, such as caspase-12 in the murine system, seem to aggregate at the ER membrane surface through TRAF2 proteins resulting in their cleavage and activation (7Momoi T. J. Chem. Neuroanat. 2004; 28: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In humans, caspase-4 has been proposed to play a role as ER stress-specific caspase similar to caspase-12 (10Hitomi J. Katayama T. Eguchi Y. Kudo T. Taniguchi M. Koyama Y. Manabe T. Yamagishi S. Bando Y. Imaizumi K. Tsujimoto Y. Tohyama M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the UPR increases the transcription of the transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), which is closely associated with cell death (11Zinszner H. Kuroda M. Wang X. Batchvarova N. Lightfoot R.T. Remotti H. Stevens J.L. Ron D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 982-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar, 12Oyadomari S. Mori M. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2193) Google Scholar). ER stress pathways linked to apoptosis have been reported in pathological states such as ischemia-reperfusion injury and diabetes as well as in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and Parkinson, where abnormalities in protein folding have been identified (8Rao R.V. Ellerby H.M. Bredesen D.E. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, 9Schroder M. Kaufman R.J. Mutat. Res. 2005; 569: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar, 13Paschen W. Cell Calcium. 2003; 34: 365-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The role of ER stress in tumor development and therapy is unclear at present, although supposedly ER stress response is important for regulating the balance between tumor cell death and its growth as well as for the sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents (14Ma Y. Hendershot L.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 966-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar).Because most of the cancer chemotherapeutic drugs signal through mitochondrial cytochrome c release, it is very difficult to distinguish as to whether the ER may play a role as stress sensor for chemotherapeutics that reroute the signal directly through mitochondria and the apoptosome or whether the ER is able to activate its own death pathway (2Herr I. Debatin K.M. Blood. 2001; 98: 2603-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 3Igney F.H. Krammer P.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar, 4Ferri K.F. Kroemer G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E255-E263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar, 8Rao R.V. Ellerby H.M. Bredesen D.E. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). In this respect, it is important to characterize specific elements of the ER stress response because they could represent novel targets for the development of new cancer chemotherapeutic strategies.We recently characterized an experimental anticancer agent, cephalostatin 1, that showed promise to be a helpful tool in this respect. Cephalostatin 1 is a bis-steroidal marine natural product, which induces a novel pathway of apoptosis in leukemia T cells. Cephalostatin 1 triggers cell death in a CD95- and caspase-8-independent manner. Even more intriguingly, without triggering cytochrome c release from mitochondria and apoptosome formation, cephalostatin-induced apoptosis is accompanied by caspase-9 activation (15Dirsch V.M. Muller I.M. Eichhorst S.T. Pettit G.R. Kamano Y. Inoue M. Xu J.P. Ichihara Y. Wanner G. Vollmar A.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8869-8876PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosome-independent cell death induction has been described in the literature before (16Marsden V.S. O'Connor L. O'Reilly L.A. Silke J. Metcalf D. Ekert P.G. Huang D.C. Cecconi F. Kuida K.

Maestro R. Paroni G. Brancolini C. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 1240-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but in these cases, apoptosis occurred independently of caspase-9 activation.In search of the mechanisms responsible for apoptosome-independent caspase-9 activation, we hypothesized that cephalostatin 1 induces ER stress. Thus, we investigated several markers of ER stress induced by cephalostatin 1 and identified ER-specific molecular players such as caspase-4 and the ASK1/JNK cascade being involved in apoptosome-independent execution of cell death.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCompounds—Cephalostatin 1 was isolated from the marine worm Cephalodiscus gilchristi as described previously (18Pettit G.R.

Purity of the compound was 98% as judged by high performance liquid chromatography. Before application, cephalostatin 1 was dissolved and further diluted in Me2SO. Final Me2SO concentration did not exceed 1%, a concentration verified not to interfere with the experiments performed. Propidium iodide, thapsigargin (TG), tunicamycin (TM), and human TNF-α were from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany); etoposide (ETO) and the specific JNK inhibitor SP600125 were from Calbiochem; and the selective caspase-4 inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-LEVD-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-LEVD-fmk) was from MBL (Woburn, MA).Cell Culture—Human leukemia Jurkat T cells (J16) (kindly provided by P.H.

Cancer. 2001; 93: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) were cultured (37 °C and 5% CO2) in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine (PAN Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (PAA Laboratories, Cölbe, Germany) and 1% pyruvate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Medium of ASK1-DN transfected cells was supplemented with 1 mg/ml G418 (PAA Laboratories, Cölbe, Germany) every fifth passage.Quantification of Apoptosis—Quantification of apoptosis was performed according to Nicoletti et al. (22Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4406) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in a hypotonic buffer (0.1% sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide) overnight at 4 °C and analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany). Nuclei to the left of the G1 peak containing hypodiploid DNA were considered apoptotic.Western Blot Analysis—Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed for 30 min either in 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 with the protease inhibitor Complete™ (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) (for Apaf-1, BiP, CHOP, and caspases); in 2 mm EDTA, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm Tris, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm sodium glycerophosphate hydrate, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride supplemented with Complete™ (for p-JNK, p-eIF2α, and JNK); or in 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 20 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4 with Complete™ (for p-ASK1 and ASK1). Lysates were homogenized with an ultrasonic device and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5% for Apaf-1 and ASK1; 10% for JNK; 12% for BiP, CHOP, p-eIF2α, and caspases) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond™ ECL™; Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked with 5% fat-free milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (1 h) and incubated with specific antibodies against Apaf-1 (mouse IgG1; BD Transduction Laboratories), Bak (mouse IgG2a; Calbiochem), BiP (mouse IgG2a; BD Transduction Laboratories), CHOP (rabbit polyclonal antibody; Sigma), p-eIF2α (rabbit polyclonal antibody; Cell Signaling, Frankfurt, Germany), p-ASK1 (Thr-845) (rabbit polyclonal antibody; Cell Signaling), ASK1 (rabbit polyclonal antibody; Cell Signaling), p-JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185) (mouse IgG1 monoclonal antibody; Cell Signaling), JNK (rabbit polyclonal antibody; Cell Signaling), caspase-4 (mouse IgG1κ, clone 4B9; MBL), or caspase-9 (rabbit polyclonal antibody; Cell Signaling) overnight at 4 °C. Specific proteins were visualized by secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and the ECL Plus™ Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were exposed to x-ray film for the appropriate time periods and subsequently developed in a tabletop film processor (Curix 60; Agfa, Cologne, Germany). Equal protein loading was controlled by Ponceau S staining of membranes.Apaf-1 siRNA—Sense and antisense small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotides corresponding to nucleotides 978–998 of Apaf-1 (AATTGGTGCACTTTTACGTGA)(23Lassus P. Opitz-Araya X. Lazebnik Y. Science. 2002; 297: 1352-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) and oligonucleotides corresponding to a scramble sequence were purchased from biomers.net GmbH (Ulm, Germany) and annealed to create the double-stranded siRNAs. Jurkat cells were transfected with 3 μg of scramble or Apaf-1 siRNAs using the Nucleofector™ II (Amaxa, Cologne, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Clonogenic Assay—Caspase-9-deficient Jurkat cells and cells retransfected with full-length caspase-9 were left untreated or treated with cephalostatin 1 for 2 h. Subsequently, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in culture medium (5 × 105 cells/ml). Cell suspensions were diluted 1:10 with methylcellulose (0.52%) medium containing 40% fetal calf serum. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (100 μl), and colonies were scored after 7 days of culture.Caspase-9 Activity Assay—Caspase-9 activity was measured using the Caspase-Glo™ 9 assay from Promega GmbH (Mannheim, Germany) following the manufacturer's protocol. Jurkat T cells grown in 96-well plates were left untreated or treated with cephalostatin 1 for 4 h with or without preaddition of caspase-4 inhibitor. After stimulation, Caspase-Glo™ 9 reagent was added to each well and gently mixed. Luminescence was measured immediately in a plate-reading multifunction photometer (SPECTRAFluor Plus; Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany) every 10 min for 2 h. Background luminescence corresponding to the culture medium was subtracted from experimental values.Plasmid Construction—A siRNA-expressing sequence for targeting the caspase-4 gene was cloned into a psiRNA-h7SKneo G1 expression vector system (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) to generate siRNA. Forward target sequences of the caspase-4 siRNA hairpin transcripts were 5′-acctcAAGTGGCCTCTTCACAGTCATtcaagagATGACTGTGAAGAGGCCACTTtt-3′ and 5′-acctcAAGATTTCCTCACTGGTGTTTccaagagAAACACCAGTGAGGAAATCTTtt-3′, respectively (10Hitomi J. Katayama T. Eguchi Y. Kudo T. Taniguchi M. Koyama Y. Manabe T. Yamagishi S. Bando Y. Imaizumi K. Tsujimoto Y. Tohyama M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar) (uppercase letters denote the double-stranded region corresponding to the caspase-4 sequence targeted). Oligonucleotides encoding a scramble sequence (universal control from InvivoGen) were used as a control. After hybridization, oligonucleotides were cloned into the BbsI site of psiRNA-h7SKneo G1 expression vector, and the plasmids were sequenced and amplified. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli LyoComp GT116 strain, and the resultant cells were cultured in LB-kanamycin-containing medium. The recombinant plasmids in the selected colonies were extracted, digested with SpeI, and run on 0.8% agarose gel to isolate the cells containing psiRNA-h7SKneo G1 caspase-4 siRNA plasmids.Plasmid Transfection—Jurkat cells were transfected by electroporation with the Nucleofector™ II (Amaxa) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 4 × 106 Jurkat T cells in exponential growing phase were transfected with 3 μg of psiRNA-h7SKneo, 3 μg of psiRNA-h7SKnScr (a control plasmid containing a scramble sequence), or 3–4 μgofa1:1 mixture of the siRNA constructs. Efficiency of RNA interference was checked by Western blot analysis using antibodies against caspase-4.To study the influence of caspase-4 down-regulation in apoptosis, caspase-4 siRNA-generating plasmids were transfected into Jurkat cells as described above, and cells were incubated for 24 h before induction of apoptosis. To investigate caspase-9 activation in cells with silenced caspase-4 expression, 1 mg/ml G418 was added to the culture medium 2 days after transfection, and experiments were performed 48 h later. In both experiments, cells containing psiRNA-h7SKneo and psiRNA-h7SKnScr vectors were used as controls.Statistical Analysis—All experiments were performed at least three times in triplicate. Results are expressed as mean value ± S.E. Student's unpaired two-tailed t test was performed using GraphPad Prism version 3.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). p values <0.05 were considered significant.RESULTSCaspase-9 Is Essential in Apoptosome-independent Apoptosis Induced by Cephalostatin 1—Cephalostatin 1 activates caspase-9 and induces apoptosis without cytochrome c release and apoptosome formation (15Dirsch V.M. Muller I.M. Eichhorst S.T. Pettit G.R. Kamano Y. Inoue M. Xu J.P. Ichihara Y. Wanner G. Vollmar A.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8869-8876PubMed Google Scholar). To further support this unique finding two strategies were used: 1) Bak-deficient Jurkat cells (Bak–/–) were exposed to cephalostatin 1 as well as etoposide as positive control. Because Jurkat cells do not express Bax (24Brimmell M. Mendiola R. Mangion J. Packham G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1803-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), the Bak–/– Jurkat cells are resistant to apoptotic stimuli such as etoposide that use the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway hallmarked by release of cytochrome c (Fig. 1A). Importantly, Bak–/– cells are equally sensitive to cephalostatin as Bak-reconstituted control cells (Fig. 1A), further pointing to a cytochrome c-independent signaling pathway. 2) To confirm cephalostatin 1 induction of apoptosis without apoptosome formation, Apaf-1 was silenced via siRNA in Jurkat cells. Cephalostatin 1 killed cells transfected with Apaf-1 siRNA to the same extent as cells transfected with a scramble siRNA sequence (Fig. 1B, left). The apoptotic response to etoposide, however, was significantly blunted in Apaf-1-silenced cells. Moreover, caspase-9 was activated to the same extent in Apaf-1 as in scramble siRNA-transfected cells upon treatment with cephalostatin 1 (Fig. 1B, right), confirming that activation of caspase-9 occurred independently of the apoptosome complex. Apoptosis induction and more intriguingly, activation of caspase-9 independently from the classical mitochondrial signaling raises the question of the role and activation pathway of caspase-9 in cephalostatin 1-induced apoptosis. For this purpose, we used a Jurkat cell line deficient in caspase-9. Interestingly, apoptosis induced by cephalostatin 1 was almost completely inhibited in caspase-9-deficient cells, whereas cells stably retransfected with full-length caspase-9 died normally when exposed to cephalostatin (Fig. 1C, left). Moreover, significant differences between both cell lines were still observed in a 7-day clonogenic assay (Fig. 1C, right). These data ask for clarifying the mechanism underlying the apoptosome-independent activation of caspase-9 by cephalostatin 1.Cephalostatin 1 Induces ER Stress in Jurkat Leukemia T Cells—In search of the initial event leading to caspase-9 activation and apoptosis, cephalostatin 1 was hypothesized to induce ER stress. In fact, the expressions of an ER stress sensor (BiP/GRP78) and an ER stress-induced cell death modulator (CHOP/GADD153) were affected by cephalostatin 1. As shown in Fig. 2, cephalostatin 1 (1 μm) increased expression of the ER chaperone BiP/GRP78 and the transcription factor CHOP/GADD153 as did the known ER stress-inducer tunicamycin. The increase of BiP showed a biphasic pattern with an early increase (30 min to 1 h) followed by a plateau and a second strong elevation after 16–24 h. CHOP protein level increased rapidly (15 min to 1 h) and decreased slowly thereafter. The eukaryotic initiation factor-2 is phosphorylated by the PKR-like ER-localized eIF2α kinase in response to ER stress leading to an attenuation of translational initiation and protein synthesis and activation of pathways leading to cell death or survival (8Rao R.V. Ellerby H.M. Bredesen D.E. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Cephalostatin 1 induced a very early and strong phosphorylation of the α-subunit of eIF2α as did the known ER stress-inducer thapsigargin (Fig. 2), further supporting the assumption of ER stress induction by cephalostatin. Similar results were obtained in HeLa and MCF-7 cells (data not shown).FIGURE 2Cephalostatin 1 induces ER stress in Jurkat leukemia T cells. Cells were either left untreated (CO) or treated with cephalostatin 1 (CPH; 1 μm) or as a positive control with TM (1 μg/ml) or TG (3 μm, 2 h) for the indicated times. Western blot analysis was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” using antibodies against BiP, CHOP, and the phosphorylated form of eIF2α. One representative blot of three is shown. Equal protein loading was controlled by staining membranes with Ponceau S (a representative section of the stained membrane is shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cephalostatin 1 Activates the ASK1-JNK Pathway, Which Is Involved in Cell Death—The ASK1 and the downstream JNK cascade are known to be activated under conditions of ER stress-induced apoptosis (6Kadowaki H. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. J. Chem. Neuroanat. 2004; 28: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). As observed in Fig. 3A, both kinases were activated very early upon cephalostatin 1 treatment. Phosphorylation of ASK1 at Thr-845, which is correlated with ASK1 activity, was observed after only 15 min and maintained up to at least 2 h of treatment. Its downstream kinase JNK was also already phosphorylated after 15 min, and the intensity of phosphorylation increased further in the course of time.FIGURE 3The ASK1-JNK pathway is important for cephalostatin 1-induced apoptosis. A, Jurkat T cells were left untreated (CO) or stimulated with cephalostatin 1 (CPH; 1 μm) or with TG (3 μm) for the indicated times (p-JNK/JNK, stimulation with TG for 2 h). Western blot experiments were performed using antibodies against the active phosphorylated forms of JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185) and ASK1 (Thr-845). Membranes were stripped and reprobed with antibodies recognizing the total level of the proteins. B, Jurkat J16 and Jurkat ASK1-DN cells (clone A2–1 and A2–3) were treated for 24 h with cephalostatin 1(CPH; 1 μm) or human TNF (10 nm), and apoptotic cells were quantified by flow cytometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Inset, the indicated cells were lysed, and equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and further analyzed by Western blot using anti-ASK1 antibodies. The lower arrow points to the endogenous and overexpressed ASK1 proteins, whereas the upper band detects a nonspecific (n.s.) band. C, Jurkat cells and ASK1-DN clone A2–3 were investigated for the activation of JNK after treatment with cephalostatin 1 (CPH; 1 μm) and TNF-α (10 nm). After treatment for 30 min, cell lysates were prepared, and the phosphorylated form of JNK was detected using Western blot analysis. Equal protein loading was controlled by staining membranes with Ponceau S (a representative section of the stained membrane is shown). All experiments were performed three times with consistent results. Bars, mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments performed in triplicate. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 (unpaired two-tailed t test).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To evaluate the role of the ASK1-JNK pathway in cephalostatin 1-induced apoptosis, two Jurkat clones expressing a dominant negative ASK1 (ASK1-DN) (21Hofmann T.G. Moller A. Hehner S.P. Welsch D. Droge W. Schmitz M.L. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 93: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) were employed. In both clones of ASK1-DN cells (A2–1, A2–3), only a partial reduction of cephalostatin 1 (1 μm, 24 h)-induced apoptosis was observed as compared with the parental J16 cells (Fig. 3B). TNF-α (10 nm, 24 h) was used as a positive control because TNF-induced apoptosis also partially depends on the activation of ASK1 (25Tobiume K. Matsuzawa A. Takahashi T. Nishitoh H. Morita K. Takeda K. Minowa O. Miyazono K. Noda T. Ichijo H. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). To verify the lack of ASK1 activity of our ASK1-DN clones, J16 and A2–3 clones were treated with cephalostatin 1 or TNF-α and investigated for JNK phosphorylation by Western blot. As expected, JNK phosphorylation was severely impaired in A2–3 cells in both cases compared with control J16 cells (Fig. 3C). In summary, Fig. 3 shows that the ASK1-JNK cascade seems not to play a major role in cephalostatin 1-induced apoptosis.Cephalostatin 1-induced Activation of Caspase-4 Is Necessary for Apoptosis—In humans caspase-4 seems to play a similar role as caspase-12 in mice being localized predominantly to the ER and involved specifically in ER stress-induced apoptosis (10Hitomi J. Katayama T. Eguchi Y. Kudo T. Taniguchi M. Koyama Y. Manabe T. Yamagishi S. Bando Y. Imaizumi K. Tsujimoto Y. Tohyama M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 347-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Fig. 4A shows that cephalostatin 1 as well as the well known ER stress inducers tunicamycin and thapsigargin activate caspase-4 time-dependently. A strong reduction of the proform was already observed after 4 h of cephalostatin 1 treatment. Employment of the specific caspase-4 inhibitor Z-LEVD-fmk led to a marked inhibition of cephalostatin 1-induced DNA fragmentation (Fig. 4B), demonstrating a crucial role of caspase-4 in the apoptotic pathway of cephalostatin 1. Caspase-4 contribution to tunicamycin and thapsigargin-induced apoptosis was similar to that seen for cephalostatin 1, further supporting its role in ER stress-induced apoptosis.

(2004) Plant Cell Physiol. 45, 18–27). To further dissect this interaction, we aimed to determine whether cytMDH can interact with the cytosolic thioredoxin and whether its activity is redox-regulated. We obtained the active recombinant cytMDH that could be oxidized and rendered inactive. Inactivation was reversed by incubation with low concentrations of dithiothreitol in the presence of recombinant Arabidopsis thaliana thioredoxin-h1. Inactivation of cytMDH was found to result from formation of a homodimer. By cysteine mutant analysis and peptide mapping analysis, we were able to determine that the cytMDH homodimer occurs by formation of a disulfide bond via the Cys330 residue. Moreover, we found this bond to be efficiently reduced by the reduced form of thioredoxin-h1. These results demonstrate that the oxidized form cytMDH dimer is a preferable target protein of the reduced form thioredoxin-h1 as suggested by thioredoxin affinity chromatography.

NAD-dependent MDHs (EC 1.1.1.37) generally exist as a homodimer with a subunit of 32–37 kDa (1Walk R.A. Hock B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 81: 636-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 2Hock B. Gietl C. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1076: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In plants, MDH isoforms have been reported in the cytosol and in organelles and have been found to carry out important roles in a number of metabolic pathways (5Gietl C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1100: 217-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In general, MDH proteins are grouped into five classes according to their location within the cell; (i) cytosolic NAD-dependent MDH (cytMDH); (ii) mitochondrial NAD-dependent MDH, which is part of the tricarboxylic acid cycle; (iii) glyoxisomal and peroxisomal NAD-dependent MDHs, which are involved in photorespiration; (iv) chloroplast NADP-dependent MDH, which is required for the transfer of reducing equivalents from chloroplast stroma to cytosol; and (v) chloroplast NAD-dependent MDH (6Scheibe R.

Among the classes listed, chloroplast NADP-dependent MDH is a thiol enzyme that has been subject of intense study (4Scheibe R. Kampfenkel K. Wessels R. Tripier D. Biochim. Biophys.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Central to the regulation of chloroplast MDH, ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase sources electrons from photosynthesis to reduce chloroplast thioredoxins (Trx) (8Crawford N.A. Droux M. Kosower N.S. Buchanan B.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 271: 223-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Trxs are an important class of regulatory proteins that modulate the activity of a wide variety of thiol-containing chloroplast enzymes by the reduction of specific disulfide bonds (15Buchanan B.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 288: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In the light, excess NADPH (produced by photosynthesis but surplus to CO2 fixation requirements) induces the conversion of oxaloacetate to malate, resulting in the regeneration of the electron acceptor NADP+. In chloroplasts, the activated form of MDH is responsible for this reaction. The resulting malate is translocated to the cytosol via the dicarboxylate transporter (16Taniguchi M. Taniguchi Y. Kawasaki M. Takeda S. Kato T. Sato S. Tabata S. Miyake H. Sugiyama T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2002; 43: 706-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), where cytosolic MDH (cytMDH) converts malate back to oxaloacetate, with NAD+ acting as an oxidant to form NADH. This mechanism allows chloroplast reducing equivalents to be transferred to the cytosol, and the transport system described above is known as the “malate valve” (6Scheibe R. Physiol. Plant. 2004; 120: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). NADH accumulated in the cytosol is then used in the mitochondria for respiratory ATP generation or may alternatively be used for cytosolic nitrate reduction. Hence cytMDH functions as a key player in the transfer of reducing equivalents from the chloroplast to other destinations in plant cells. In the cytosol, a number of Trx-h isoforms have been reported, although the function of each of these Trx-h isoforms has not been determined very well (17Rivera-Madrid R. Mestres D. Marinho P.

A. 2005; 102: 16729-16734Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cytosolic Trx-h isoforms are thought to be reduced by cytosolic NADPH Trx reductase, which in turn uses NADPH as a reducing equivalent (20Florencio F.J. Yee B.C. Johnson T.C. Buchanan B.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 266: 496-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The NADPH/NADP+ ratio in the cytosol does not change substantially during light/dark transitions and is maintained between 1 and 1.2 in pea leaves (21Igamberdiev A.U. Gardestrom P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1606: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), suggesting that the reduction levels of cytosolic Trx-h isoforms must also be maintained at a certain level irrespective of light/dark conditions. Therefore, determination of the target proteins of Trx is of significant importance in our understanding of the physiological roles of Trx-h as transducer of reducing equivalents. Recent enrichment of genome data bases has allowed the screening and molecular characterization of possible target proteins of Trx using a proteomic approach (22Motohashi K. Kondoh A. Stumpp M.T.

Hosoya-Matsuda N. Motohashi K. J. Exp. Bot. 2005; 56: 1463-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) in an attempt to capture the potential cytosolic target proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana Trx-h and identified a number of proteins including anti-oxidative stress-related proteins, proteins involved in biosynthesis and degradation of proteins, and several metabolic enzymes (30Yamazaki D. Motohashi K. Kasama T. Hara Y. Hisabori T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Within these captured enzymes, we sought to verify and characterize Trx-dependent regulation of cytMDH in this study. Materials—The Bradford protein assay system was from BioRad. DTT was from Sigma. All of the other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. Preparation of Recombinant Trx-h1—Recombinant Trx-h1 was expressed in Escherichia coli using an expression plasmid and the Trx-h1 gene sequence from A. thaliana (30Yamazaki D. Motohashi K. Kasama T. Hara Y. Hisabori T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), purified as described (31Motohashi K. Koyama F. Nakanishi Y. Ueoka-Nakanishi H. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31848-31852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and stored at –80 °C. The Trx concentration was determined by the BCA assay (Pierce). Preparation of the cDNA for cytMDH—Total RNA was isolated from 14-day-old A. thaliana as described in (32Stumpp M.T. Motohashi K. Hisabori T. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and used as a template for RT-PCR. The cDNA for cytMDH was synthesized by RT-PCR using RNA LA PCR kit (Takara, Kyoto, Japan) with the following oligonucleotide primers; 5′-GGAATTCCATATGGCGAAAGAACCAGTTCG-3′ (NdeI) and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTTAAGAGAGGCATGAGTACG-3′ (XhoI). The restriction sites for the enzyme shown in parentheses are underlined. The amplified DNA was ligated into the NdeI and XhoI sites of the pET23a expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI), and the sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing (PRISM 310; Applied Biosystems). Expression and Purification of cytMDH—The resulting expression vector was transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3), and transformed cells were cultured at 37 °C until A600 = 0.7. Expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranoside, followed by further culture at 21 °C for 16 h. For purification of the recombinant cytMDH, all of the procedures were carried out at 4 °C. The cells were suspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), disrupted by sonication, and centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then applied to a DEAE-Toyopearl 650 m column (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) that had been previously equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and the proteins were eluted with a 0–300 mm linear gradient of NaCl in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The fractions containing cytMDH were collected, and ammonium sulfate was added to a final concentration of 30% (w/v). This protein sample was applied to a Butyl-Toyopearl 650 m column (Tosoh) and eluted with 30–0% inverse ammonium sulfate gradient. The obtained fraction containing the desired protein was collected and ultrafiltrated to remove ammonium sulfate using Amicon Ultra-15 (cut-off molecular weight, 10,000; Millipore). The protein concentration was determined by Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as standard. Oxidation and Reduction of the Recombinant cytMDH—Because the recombinant cytMDH was obtained in the reduced form (cytMDHred), after purification, the protein was oxidized by incubation with 50 μm CuCl2 for 1 h at 30 °C. Oxidized cytMDH (cytMDHox) was dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) to remove CuCl2 prior to the assay. For in vitro reduction, 5 μM cytMDHox was incubated for 1 h at 30 °C with DTT in the presence or absence of Trx-h1. Following treatment, the redox state of cytMDH was confirmed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE using 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel. Preparation of the Cys Mutant of cytMDH—The Cys mutants of cytMDH were prepared by using the mega-primer method (33Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar) using KOD DNA polymerase (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) and the suitable oligonucleotide primers. Expression and purification of the mutant proteins were performed as above. A C125A mutant was prepared instead of the C125S mutant because the latter was found to be insoluble. MDH Activity—cytMDH activity was measured at 30 °C in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 1 mm oxaloacetic acid, and 0.1 mm NADH. The activity was monitored as a decrease in absorbance at 340 nm because of NADH oxidation. ϵ340 for NADH of 6.25 mm–1 was used for the calculation of the amounts of the catalyzed NADH. In this study, MDH activity is shown as the oxidation of NADH/min/mg of protein. Peptide Mapping Analysis—To determine the disulfide partner cysteines, cytMDHox was digested with sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) for 20 h at 37 °C in 25 mm (NH4)HCO3 (pH 7.0) with a protein-to-protein ratio of 90:1 (w/w). The proteolytic peptides obtained were analyzed directly by reversed-phase HPLC or reduced before analysis. For reduction of the fragments obtained from cytMDHox, the mixture of proteolytic peptides was incubated with 10 mm DTT for 1 h at 37 °C. The peptides were then separated by reversed-phase HPLC column (Cosmosil 5C18 AR-300, 4.6 × 150 mm; Nacalai tesque, Kyoto, Japan) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with solvent A (0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid) and solvent B (90% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid) using the gradient elution (2% solvent B at 0–5 min, 2–50% solvent B at 5–50 min, 50–80% solvent B at 50–65 min, and 80% solvent B at 65–75 min). The peptide fragments were monitored at 220 nm. N-terminal amino acid sequences of the separated fragments were analyzed by N-terminal peptide sequencing (PPSQ-21; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan), and their molecular masses were determined by using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Axima-CFR Plus; Shimadzu). Gel Filtration Analysis—Reduced or oxidized cytMDH was loaded onto a gel filtration column TSK-G2000SWXL (Tosoh) that had been previously equilibrated with buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 100 mm KCl. Sedimentation Analysis—Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out with an ultracentrifuge, Optima XLI (Beckman-Coulter), using a four-hole An60Ti rotor at 20 °C. The measurements were carried out in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) and 150 mm KCl and monitored by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. The partial specific volume was calculated based on the amino acid composition using the software SEDNTERP, which was kindly provided by J. Philo. The results were analyzed by using the program SEDFIT (34Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3062) Google Scholar), and the distribution function of sedimentation coefficients, c(s), was calculated. Reactivation of the Oxidized Form of Recombinant cytMDH by Reduction—Measurement of the activity of purified recombinant cytMDH in the presence of 0.1 mm NADH and 1 mm oxaloacetic acid showed comparable rates (1.5 mmol/min/mg of protein) to cytosolic MDHs from other organisms and organelles (35Miller S.S. Driscoll B.T. Gregerson R.G. Gantt J.S. Vance C.P. Plant J. 1998; 15: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 36Trejo F. Gelpi J.L. Ferrer A. Boronat A. Busquets M. Cortes A. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Therefore, measurements of redox-induced changes in cytMDH activity were carried out as described above in all of the subsequent experiments. We first examined whether the enzyme activity of cytMDH is affected by redox conditions. Although recombinant cytMDH expressed in E. coli was purified as a reduced form, the protein could be oxidized by incubation with low concentrations of CuCl2 (Fig. 1), resulting in cytMDH inactivation (Fig. 1A). Upon reduction of oxidized cytMDH by incubation with 1 mm DTT, enzyme activity was restored, indicating that cytMDH could be reversibly activated and inactivated by a change in redox state. Oxidized cytMDH Forms an Intermolecular Disulfide Bond—The reported crystal structures of MDH proteins of various organisms suggest that this protein forms a homodimer (37Birktoft J.J. Rhodes G. Banaszak L.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6065-6081Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 38Hall M.D. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol.

Birkeland N.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To investigate the formation of the intermolecular disulfide bond within the dimer under oxidizing conditions, we used nonreducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). The reduced form of cytMDH migrated to the monomeric position (35.6 kDa), whereas oxidized cytMDH appeared as a 71-kDa homodimeric band, implying that cytMDH was able to form an intermolecular disulfide bond(s) under oxidizing conditions. Oxidized cytMDH Is Reduced by Trx-h1—Interaction between oxidized cytMDH and the reduced form of Trx-h1 was initially identified by Trx affinity chromatography (30Yamazaki D. Motohashi K. Kasama T. Hara Y. Hisabori T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To confirm this interaction, oxidized cytMDH was incubated with various concentrations of DTT in the presence or the absence of Trx-h1. cytMDH activity was found to be gradually restored by increasing concentrations of DTT (Fig. 2A), and, most significantly, recovery was greatly accelerated by the addition of Trx-h1. Efficiency of the reduction of intermolecular disulfide bond(s) was also increased by Trx-h1 (Fig. 2, B and C). The linear correlation observed between cytMDH activity and its reduction level (Fig. 2C, inset) strongly suggests that cytMDH activity is regulated by formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond. Enhancement of the reduction by Trx-h1 was observed in the presence of 0.5 μm Trx-h1 and 10 μm DTT (Fig. 2D), suggesting that the reduced form of Trx-h1 can efficiently reduce cytMDHox. Identification of the Critical Cysteines of cytMDH for Dimer Formation Using Cys Mutants—A. thaliana cytMDH contains six cysteine residues, all of which are conserved in plant cytosolic MDH isoforms (supplemental Fig. S1). To determine the regulatory Trx-targeted cysteine pairs responsible for dimer formation, we prepared six cytMDH Cys mutants (C79S, C125A, C155S, C252S, C292S, and C330S) and investigated their redox sensitivity. The C330S mutation alone was found to affect both the redox sensitivity of MDH activity and intermolecular disulfide bond formation (Fig. 3). These results imply that the oxidized cytMDH dimer is formed by disulfide formation between Cys330 on the monomeric protein. Peptide Mapping Analysis—Peptide mapping analysis (31Motohashi K. Koyama F. Nakanishi Y. Ueoka-Nakanishi H. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31848-31852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) was used to characterize both the intra- and intermolecular disulfide bonds formed in the protein molecule under oxidizing conditions. To achieve this, cytMDHox was digested by trypsin, and the resulting peptide fragments were either directly separated by reversed-phase HPLC (Fig. 4A) or separated following incubation with 10 mm DTT for reduction (Fig. 4B). Two redox-responsive peptide fragments were identified in the oxidized form peptides (Fig. 4A, TO-1 and TO-2), which were not observed in the reduced form fragments (Fig. 4B). In contrast, a novel peptide fragment appeared when the peptide fragments were reduced in advance (Fig. 4B, TR-1). These redox-specific peptide fragments were analyzed by N-terminal sequencing and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Table 1). The TO-1 fragment was found to have a mass of 1739.9 and the sequence DLAYS derived from the C-terminal region of cytMDH. This fragment mass corresponds to that of a dimer of the C terminus peptide fragment (325DLAYSCLS332), which was formed by the Cys330–Cys330 disulfide bond. TO-2 was also observed only in the oxidizing peptide fragments, and it contained two peptide fragments, one including Cys252 and another one probably including Cys292, respectively. Although this result suggests the existence of a Cys252–Cys292 disulfide bond, the finding that the two C252S and C292S mutants remained inactive in the oxidized form implies that the suggested disulfide bond does not play a regulatory role in the cytMDH protein (Fig. 3B). An additional peak corresponding to TR-1 was specifically found in reduced peptide fragments and was found to contain no cysteine residues. So far, we have been unable to explain the occurrence of the TR-1 peptide in the reduced form fragments.TABLE 1Peptide mapping analysis of cytMDHox using N-terminal sequencer and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometryPeptide fractionPeptide fragmentaThe numbers denote the amino acid positions in the sequence of the mature protein.

Open table in a new tab Molecular Size of the Oxidized cytMDH—Finally, the molecular sizes of the reduced and the oxidized cytMDH were determined. The oxidized form cytMDH gave two molecular species in the gel filtration chromatography in the presence of 0.1 m KCl, whereas the elution time for the smaller molecule was almost the same as that for the reduced form, which was eluted as a single peak (Fig. 5A). Both fractions of cytMDHox were composed of cytMDH disulfide dimer and monomer molecules, although the monomer content of the O2 fraction (the first half of the second peak fraction) was found to be higher than in the O3 fraction (Fig. 5A, inset). In addition, the weak MDH activity of the cytMDHox preparation was recovered in these three fractions (40% in O1, 50% in O2, and 10% in O3), implying that both peaks contained the reduced form dimer molecule, but the presumed tetramer molecule eluted in the O1 fraction may be composed of a heterogeneous mixture of cytMDHox dimer and cytMDHred dimer. The deduced molecular weight of the reduced form cytMDH was 53,000, and that for the smallest peak of the oxidized form cytMDH was 43,000. These values were smaller than the theoretically expected values for dimer (71,200) and larger than that for monomer (35,600), suggesting that the molecular shapes of these cytMDH dimers were very different from those of the globular proteins or that these cytMDH proteins have some nonspecific weak affinity to the gel. To determine the molecular species in the oxidized and the reduced fractions, we carried out sedimentation velocity measurements. The c(s) analysis of the moving boundaries of the oxidized form cytMDH showed again two molecular species, whose s values were 4.85 S (the major peak) and 7.00 S (Fig. 5B). The c(s) analysis for the reduced form cytMDH gave only one peak with the s value of 4.64 S, which is almost identical to the s value for the major peak of the oxidized form. Using these values, the conversion of c(s) to c(M) gave the molecular weight of 76,200, which is close to the value for dimer for the reduced form, and that of 69,500 for the major peak fraction of the oxidized form. Nine genes encoding cytosolic Trx-h isoforms have been reported in the A. thaliana genome (43Meyer Y. Reichheld J.P. Vignols F. Photosynth. Res. 2005; 86: 419-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), at least five of which have been found to be expressed (17Rivera-Madrid R. Mestres D. Marinho P. Jacquot J.P. Decottignies P. Miginiac-Maslow M. Meyer Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5620-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar); the physiological role of each Trx isoform is yet to be determined. Trx affinity chromatography was used in an attempt to uncover the target proteins of the Trx-h isoforms, leading to the identification of several potential metabolic enzyme targets (29Hisabori T. Hara S. Fujii T. Yamazaki D. Hosoya-Matsuda N. Motohashi K. J. Exp. Bot. 2005; 56: 1463-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 30Yamazaki D. Motohashi K. Kasama T. Hara Y. Hisabori T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Among the captured proteins, cytMDH was found to be of particular interest, given that redox regulation of its chloroplastic counterpart has been the subject of intense study. Moreover, in contrast to the cytosolic form that, until now, was thought to be a redox-insensitive enzyme, the chloroplast MDH isoform is characterized by two unique N- and C-terminal extensions containing redoxsensitive cysteines. The work presented here elegantly demonstrates that, although lacking these N- and C-terminal extensions, cytMDH is also a redox-sensitive enzyme. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, we were able to confirm that recombinant cytMDH forms an intermolecular disulfide bond under oxidizing conditions. As a target of the reduced form of Trx-h1, this disulfide bond was found to be responsible for the regulation of the enzyme activity of recombinant cytMDH. The MDH activity in the cytosol obtained from the Arabidopsis cell cultures was about 7.6 μmol/min/mg of protein, and ∼15% of this activity was suppressed upon previous incubation of the cell cultures with H2O2 (data not shown). Assuming that (i) the suppressed activity is caused by oxidation of cytMDH and (ii) the specific activity of cytMDH in vivo is equivalent to that of the recombinant cytMDH, the amount of cytMDH protein was roughly estimated to be 0.1% of the total cytosolic protein. Although Trx-h is known to be a ubiquitous and constitutively expressed protein, and several reports on Trx-h mRNA quantification have been published (17Rivera-Madrid R. Mestres D. Marinho P. Jacquot J.P. Decottignies P. Miginiac-Maslow M. Meyer Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5620-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 44Laloi C. Rayapuram N. Chartier Y.

Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1006-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), there is as yet no information regarding the Trx-h protein content of the plant cytosol. According to measurements carried out using a specific antibody, 4Y. Mizota and T. Hisabori, unpublished data. TrxA1 in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, the major Trx in this bacterium, represents 1% (w/w) of the total soluble proteins. In view of the known cellular expression levels of Trxs, the experimental conditions used for reduction of recombinant cytMDH in this study (Trx concentration range of 0.5–3 μm being similar or slightly lower than that used for the recent study of plant Trx target enzymes (46Sasaki Y.

A. 2004; 101: 14545-14550Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar)) are considered appropriate to evoke the physiological stoichiometry of cytMDH and Trx. In addition to the functional characterization of cytMDH, we were able to determine that Cys330 is the redox-responsive cysteine residue required to form the intermolecular disulfide bond under oxidizing conditions (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the two Cys330 residues have been shown to be located at opposite ends of the dimeric contact point in previously reported crystal structures of dimeric MDH proteins from other organisms (40Johansson K. Ramaswamy S. Saarinen M. Lemaire-Chamley M. Issakidis-Bourguet E. Miginiac-Maslow M. Eklund H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4319-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 51Carr P.D. Verger D. Ashton A.R. Ollis D.L. Structure. 1999; 7: 461-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This notion raises the issue of whether recombinant cytMDH is able to assume the previously reported dimeric structure under oxidizing conditions. Three-dimensional structural information on the oxidized form of cytMDH will allow us to further elucidate the nature of the newly reported disulfide bond-linked dimer described here. Peptide mapping analysis revealed one additional intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys252 and Cys292 (Table 1) that is not involved in conferring redox sensitivity to the enzyme activity of cytMDH. Moreover, based on the reported crystal structures of the cytosolic-type MDH (37Birktoft J.J. Rhodes G. Banaszak L.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6065-6081Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), the corresponding positions of the sulfhydryl side chains of these cysteine residues may not be close enough to form a disulfide bond. Again, the molecular structure of the cytMDH of A. thaliana is likely to be somewhat different from the previously reported structures of MDH. During analysis of dimer formation by nonreducing SDS-PAGE, we noted two monomeric bands on the gel (Figs. 1B and 2B). However, this was not due to the suggested intramolecular disulfide bond because both C252S and C292S mutants also showed this heterogeneity under the reducing conditions (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, the mutant C330S did not show the duplex bands (Fig. 3A). We found that the lower band of these two monomeric bands disappeared when the reduced protein was treated with N-ethylmaleimide prior to nonreducing SDS-PAGE (data not shown). We therefore concluded that the observed lower band is the result of formation of the unidentified intramolecular disulfide bond between the Cys330 and the other Cys residue in the cytMDH molecule, which must be easily formed in the denatured state by oxidation during nonreducing SDS-PAGE. To characterize the oxidized form cytMDH in more detail, we measured the molecular weights using two methods. Both gel filtration chromatography and sedimentation velocity analysis revealed two hydrodynamically distinct species in the oxidized cytMDH fraction (Fig. 5). However, in both cases, the smaller molecular species was the major fraction, and the major peak for the reduced form of cytMDH was unambiguously identified as dimer based on the c(s) analysis. Because the major peak for oxidized form has the close s value of 4.85 S, this must be a dimer species. The presence of multiple species may introduce some significant errors into the molecular weight calculation based on the measured c(s) values, because the c(s) analysis assumes a common value for f/f0. It is, however, very likely that the peak with the s value of 7.00 S corresponds to tetramer. Based on the reported crystal structure of cytMDH, a large conformational change is expected to occur upon intermolecular disulfide bond formation between the Cys330 residues on the monomeric protein. This conformational change may significantly alter the molecular surface charges and the hydrophobicity. Moreover, this hypothesized conformational change may induce additional intermolecular interaction and facilitate the formation of tetramer. The observed slight difference in the elution time between the oxidized and reduced form of dimeric cytMDH may be due to the change in surface properties of the molecule upon oxidation. Three-dimensional structural analysis of the oxidized form cytMDH will therefore provide crucial information on the oxidation of cytMDH. In plant cytosol, the reducing equivalents transferred from chloroplasts are converted to NADH by cytMDH. The resulting NADH is then used as reducing equivalents in the cytosol or transferred into mitochondria by another malate shuttle system where it is used for respiration. In contrast, cytosolic NADPH levels in plant cells are maintained by the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway irrespective of the light/dark transition (21Igamberdiev A.U. Gardestrom P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1606: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) because cytosolic NADPH is an important reducing equivalent required for amino acid and fatty acid biosynthesis. In addition, the reduction level of cytosolic Trx-h isoforms is likely to be influenced by the cytosolic NADPH/NADP+ ratio, because the cytosolic Trx-h protein is efficiently reduced by NADPH-Trx reductase. Reduced Trx-h is likely to be instrumental in maintaining a high ratio of reduced/oxidized cytMDH under physiological conditions. What is the reason for the highly efficient reduction of oxidized cytMDH by Trx-h? As mentioned above, the physiological importance of cytMDH means that its activity must be highly maintained. Thus Trx-h may constitute a safety mechanism required to minimize unexpected inactivation of cytMDH caused by intermolecular disulfide bond formation. So far, the existence of multiple cytosolic Trx isoforms has been somewhat enigmatic, and little is known about the individual roles of these isoforms. The Trx-targeted metabolic enzymes captured by Trx affinity chromatography (30Yamazaki D. Motohashi K. Kasama T. Hara Y. Hisabori T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) are likely to be of significant physiological importance. Consequently, oxidation of these enzymes is likely to result in a marked impairment in cell viability. To avoid this eventuality, plant cells are probably equipped with a large and efficient reduction system comprised of multiple Trx-h isoforms, which serve to reduce redox-sensitive disulfide bonds on these important enzymes. Further investigation into the interaction between Trx-h isoforms and their target proteins and on the redox states of the metabolic enzymes in the cytosol should allow additional insight into the multiple and varied functions of the cytosolic Trx-h family.

https://openalex.org/W2055417292,"αII-spectrin is a major cortical cytoskeletal protein contributing to membrane organization and integrity. The Ca2+-activated binding of calmodulin to an unstructured insert in the 11th repeat unit of αII-spectrin enhances the susceptibility of spectrin to calpain cleavage but abolishes its sensitivity to several caspases and to at least one bacterially derived pathologic protease. Other regulatory inputs including phosphorylation by c-Src also modulate the proteolytic susceptibility of αII-spectrin. These pathways, acting through spectrin, appear to control membrane plasticity and integrity in several cell types. To provide a structural basis for understanding these crucial biological events, we have solved the crystal structure of a complex between bovine calmodulin and the calmodulin-binding domain of human αII-spectrin (Protein Data Bank ID code 2FOT). The structure revealed that the entire calmodulin-spectrin-binding interface is hydrophobic in nature. The spectrin domain is also unique in folding into an amphiphilic helix once positioned within the calmodulin-binding groove. The structure of this complex provides insight into the mechanisms by which calmodulin, calpain, caspase, and tyrosine phosphorylation act on spectrin to regulate essential cellular processes. αII-spectrin is a major cortical cytoskeletal protein contributing to membrane organization and integrity.

Spectrin αβ heterodimers are organized into filamentous structures composed of two related subunits. The α subunit contains 21 triple-helical homologous repeats that are further organized into five protease-sensitive domains (1Morrow J.S. Rimm D.L. Kennedy S.P. Cianci C.D. Sinard J.H. Weed S.A. Hoffman J. Jamieson J. Handbook of Physiology, Section 14, Cell Physiology. Oxford, London1997: 485-540Google Scholar). The 11th repeat is the longest and contains a unique insert that is implicated to play a critical role in spectrin integrity. The spectrin-based cytoskeleton represents a scaffold attached to both the plasma membrane and the intracellular organelles by interactions involving both integral and peripheral membrane proteins as well as by direct lipid interactions (2Gascard P.

It has been observed that during the early stages of apoptosis, a characteristic 150-kDa fragment of αII-spectrin is generated by caspases regardless of the cell type and the apoptosis stimulus (21Williams S.T. Smith A.N. Cianci C.D. Morrow J.S. Brown T.L. Apoptosis. 2003; 8: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In neurons, calpain-catalyzed proteolysis has been linked with N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation and is thought to be crucial for synaptic and neuronal plasticity. Finally, the Pet toxin, a serine proteinase from enter-opathogenic bacteria, catalyzes spectrin fragmentation and the consequent collapse of the cell membrane (22Dutta P.R. Cappello R. Navarro-Garcia F. Nataro J.P. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 7105-7113Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 23Canizalez-Roman A. Navarro-Garcia F. Mol.

In each case, the cellular response ensuing from such proteolysis is determined by cleavage at a specific site in the αII spectrin molecule. The 11th repeat of αII-spectrin contains an unusual, protease-hypersensitive insert in helix C. This insert contains recognition sites for μ-calpain, caspases 2, 3, and 7, and the serine proteinase Pet toxin (13Wang K.K. Posmantur R. Nath R. McGinnis K. Whitton M. Talanian R.V. Glantz S.B.

The N-terminal side of the 11th repeat (herein termed αIIspec) is flanked by an SH3 domain, whereas the C-terminal portion encompasses a calmodulin-binding domain that is proposed to be unstructured in solution (27Stabach P.R. Cianci C.D. Glantz S.B. Zhang Z. Morrow J.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).

J. 2004; 378: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cleavage by calpain is also controlled by phosphorylation of residue Tyr1176 by c-Src, a kinase that binds to the flanking SH3 domain in the α10 repeat unit (31Nedrelow J.H. Cianci C.D. Morrow J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7735-7741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). When phosphorylated, αII-spectrin becomes resistant to calpain proteolytic activity (31Nedrelow J.H. Cianci C.D. Morrow J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7735-7741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 32Nicolas G. Fournier C.M. Galand C. Malbert-Colas L. Bournier O. Kroviarski Y. Bourgeois M. Camonis J.H.

Thus, an insert in the α11 repeat of the human αII-spectrin represents the convergence point of two crucial cellular signaling cascades. The mechanism(s) of both the CaM-dependent regulation of spectrin proteolysis and the cross-talk between the two signaling networks at the site of αIIspec is not well understood. To address these questions, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of the complex between bovine calmodulin and the proposed calmodulin-binding domain of human αII-spectrin (CaM-αIIspec) (25Harris A.S. Croall D. Morrow J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15754-15761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of this complex revealed that the CaM-αIIspec-binding interface is composed entirely of hydrophobic residues, in striking contrast to previously determined CaM-peptide structures. CaM binding also induced a 23-residue stretch of αIIspec to fold into an amphiphilic α-helix with hydrophobic side chains facing the CaM hydrophobic groove. These numerous hydrophobic interactions are reminiscent of those seen within a protein core, suggesting that complex formation is driven by an increase in solvent entropy. A detailed comparison of our structure with those of other CaM-peptide complex structures also reveals that αIIspec is positioned uniquely in the CaM groove relative to previously known ligands (33Aoyagi M. Arvai A.S. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 766-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 34Clapperton J.A. Martin S.R. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Bayley P.M.

The crystal structure of the CaM-αIIspec complex thus provides a compelling structural basis for understanding how calmodulin regulates the susceptibility of αII-spectrin to proteolysis and thereby other downstream cytoskeletal signals. Complex Preparation and Crystallization—Bovine calmodulin was purchased from Sigma. The human αII-spectrin calmodulin-binding domain containing cleavage sites for calpain, caspases, and Pet toxin was cloned into pGEX4T vector and expressed and purified as a GST fusion protein from Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) using the following procedure. An over-night culture of the CaM-binding domain of spectrin was diluted 1/10 into fresh Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, grown with shaking at 37 °C for 1 h when it was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The growth was continued for an additional 4 h at 37°C. The cells were spun down at 5,000 × g/10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme, and 1% Triton X-100 and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The culture was then diluted with an additional 10 ml of the resuspension buffer, and while on ice, sonicated with three 10-s pulses. The lysate was then centrifuged at 18,000 rpm for 20 min. at 4 °C. The soluble fraction was loaded onto a glutathione agarose matrix and washed with Tris-buffered saline buffer, and GST-αIIspec was eluted in 4 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm reduced glutathione. The protein was then further purified on a calmodulin-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm CaCl2. Prior to loading the column, CaCl2 was added to the sample to a final concentration of 10 mm. The column was then washed with the above buffer until the baseline absorbance was restored. The GST-αIIspec was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm EGTA. GST was subsequently removed by thrombin cleavage and removed by absorption to glutathione-Sepharose. The αII-spec-CaM complex was formed from an equimolar solution of calmodulin and peptide. Crystals were obtained by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method, mixing equal volumes of the protein complex and the well solution (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 30% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 m (NH4)2SO4) in a total volume of 40 μl. The crystals belong to space group P212121 (a = 44.29, b = 57.73, c = 69.75 Å) with one molecule per asymmetric unit and 49% solvent content. Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement— Diffraction data were collected at room temperature on a Rigaku RAXIS II detector using a rotating copper anode as an x-ray source. The data were indexed in Denzo and scaled and reduced in Scalepack (37Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The initial phases were determined by molecular replacement using the structure of calmodulin (PDB accession code: 1CDM). The search model was broken into two domains (residues 4-70 and 79-144), omitting the linker loop containing residues 71-80. Molecular replacement calculations were performed with Phaser 1.3 (38McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Ten percent of the data was randomly assigned to an Rfree test set for cross-validation (41Brunger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The final stages of refinement, including individual B factor refinement, were performed against all the data.

The molar circular dichroism was measured from 190 to 260 nm, and the percentages of protein secondary structure were estimated using the program K2d available at the K2d home page (43Andrade M.A. Chacon P.

Overall Structure—The crystal structure of the calmodulin-binding domain of αII-spectrin in complex with calmodulin was solved to 2.45 Å resolution and refined to a final R factor of 24.5% (Rfree = 26.9%) (Table 1). The final model contains 157 protein residues, 62 water molecules, and four calcium ions. The CaM-αIIspec complex is compact and globular, like other CaM-peptide structures solved previously (see Fig. 2A) (33Aoyagi M. Arvai A.S. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D.

All four calcium-binding sites are similar when compared with other CaM-ligand complex structures. To crystallize the complex of CaM with αIIspec, a 42-residue peptide of the proposed calmodulin-binding domain of αII-spectrin was prepared (Fig. 1A). This peptide contains cleavage sites for μ-calpain, caspases 2, 3, and 7, and the recently identified Pet toxin proteinases (23Canizalez-Roman A. Navarro-Garcia F. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 947-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 25Harris A.S. Croall D. Morrow J.S. J. Biol.

J. 2004; 378: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A 23-residue-long stretch (residues Ala1189-Arg1211) of the peptide was ordered and adopted an α-helical conformation (Fig. 2). Five N-terminal residues of CaM, loop 70 (residues 74-80) and residue 116, were disordered and consequently could not be modeled into the CaM-αIIspec structure. Likewise, the 18 N-terminal residues of αIIspec, encompassing the calpain and caspase cleavage sites, and 3 extreme C-terminal residues, were missing from the map. CaM-αIIspec Binding Is Mediated Entirely by Hydrophobic Interactions—Analysis of the CD spectra of the calmodulin-binding domain of αII-spectrin as well as earlier modeling studies (27Stabach P.R. Cianci C.D. Glantz S.B. Zhang Z. Morrow J.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) show that it is disordered in solution (Fig. 3). The structure of the CaM-αIIspec complex revealed that upon calmodulin binding, αIIspec folds into an amphiphilic helix beginning with a proline residue at position 1191 (based on the human αII-spectrin numbering). The combined buried surface area at the interface between the two molecules is 2,590 Å2, which is a half of the αIIspec surface area. A more detailed analysis of αIIspec binding revealed a striking difference between the CaM-spectrin complex and other previously solved CaM-peptide structures. It is well established that upon binding of Ca2+, two calmodulin lobes, designated as the N- and C-lobe, undergo a structural rearrangement to expose hydrophobic pockets and allow various ligands to bind. Flexibility in helix D (hD) that connects the two CaM lobes allows an additional conformational change upon ligand binding. In such a complex, two CaM lobes wrap around the target ligand, stabilizing the closed conformation of the CaM-peptide complex. The typical CaM ligand is a helix of about 20 residues containing two hydrophobic side chains separated by 8, 10, 14, or 16 residues that provide anchor points for the ligand (46Rhoads A.R.

Genomics. 2000; 1: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The proposed CaM-binding sequence of the αIIspec contains 3 hydrophobic residues, whereas the rest of the sequence does not bear any similarity with other known CaM ligands (Fig. 1B). These hydrophobic residues put the αII-spectrin CaM-binding domain into the 1-14 class of CaM-binding peptides, or more precisely, into its 1-8-14 subclass (47Yap K.L. Kim J. Truong K. Sherman M. Yuan T. Ikura M. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2000; 1: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The class/subclass name designates the spacing between the critical anchor residues in the CaM ligand. In all previously described CaM-peptide complexes, the majority of interactions with the ligand are mediated through extensive hydrogen bonding networks that are supported with limited hydrophobic interactions. However, unlike the other CaM-binding sequences that have been characterized, the interacting surface of the CaM-αIIspec complex is composed almost entirely of hydrophobic residues clustered into three hydrophobic pockets (Fig. 4). The first CaM-binding pocket is composed of the C-lobe residues from helices F (hF) and H (hH), the extreme C terminus of CaM, and the loop connecting hF and helix G (hG). Two methionine residues, Met124 and Met144, form the first methionine cleft that binds the side-chain Trp1192 from αIIspec. At the bottom of the pocket are Phe92, Leu105, Met109, Phe141, and Met145 from CaM. The side chains of Phe92 and Met109 interact with Ala1195 from αIIspec, a residue positioned on the same face of the helix as Trp1192. The Van der Waals contacts between Trp1192 and the first CaM methionine cleft anchor the N-terminal end of αIIspec into the C-lobe of CaM (Fig. 4, A and B). Hydrophobic interactions between a tryptophan side chain at the N terminus of a ligand and the first hydrophobic pocket of CaM have been described previously (34Clapperton J.A. Martin S.R. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Bayley P.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14669-14679Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 35Meador W.E. Means A. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1251-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). In those structures, the tryptophan side chain forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Met124 of CaM. Conversely, in the CaM-αIIspec complex, the Trp1192 side chain adopts a different rotamer conformation and interacts with the first methionine pocket via exclusively hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 4B). The second binding pocket is composed of residues from the N-lobe helix A (hA), C-lobe helix E (hE), and the loop connecting hF and hG. The αIIspec residue Leu1197 interacts with Ala15 and Leu18, whereas Val1199 interacts with Ile85, Ala88, and Met145. The anchor residue in the second pocket is clearly Met1198, which makes contacts with Val35, Leu39, and Ala112 (Fig. 4C). The pocket expands further with Met36 from CaM, which interacts with side chains of Thr1201 and Val1202 from αIIspec. This pocket represents the region where the hydrophobic surfaces of the two CaM lobes fuse into one continuous region. The third pocket is composed of residues from helices B, C, and D of the N-lobe of CaM. CaM side chains Phe16, Phe19, Phe61, Ile63, Phe65, and Phe68 form the bottom of the pocket, whereas the wall is lined up with Leu32, Val55, Met71, and Met72. Finally, the pocket roof is composed of Met36 and Met51. Three methionine residues Met36, Met51, and Met71 establish the second methionine cleft that interacts primarily with αIIspec residue Phe1205 (Fig. 4B). Other αIIspec residues, such as Thr1201, Val1202, and Ile1204, contribute with additional Van der Waals contacts. It is clear that the hydrophobic side chains of the 2 αIIspec residues Trp1192 and Phe1205, located at the opposite ends of the helix, interact with two methionine clefts located within different CaM lobes (Fig. 4, A and B). These residues, along with Met1198, serve as anchor points for the αIIspec helix, playing a crucial role in CaM-αIIspec recognition. The only two ionic interactions observed in the entire complex are the following: Lys1193 of αIIspec makes a hydrogen bond with Glu14 (N-lobe; hA), whereas Asn1206 forms hydrogen bonds with both the Gln41 (N-lobe; hB) and the Glu84 (C-lobe; hE) side chains. Interestingly, these ionic interactions are contiguous to the major anchor pockets both sequentially and spatially. These small hydrogen bond networks further stabilize the orientation of the αIIspec helix. Finally, αIIspec residues from Asn1206 to the C terminus and other polar side chains do not contribute to the binding with CaM. The Calmodulin-binding Domain of Spectrin Binds Differently in the CaM-binding Groove—We have compared our structure of the calmodulin-binding domain of spectrin with the following CaM-peptide complexes: CaM-CaMKII (36Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1993; 262: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar), CaM-MARCKS (44Yamauchi E. Nakatsu T. Matsubara M. Kato H. Taniguchi H. Nat. Struct.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14669-14679Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The ligands used in the comparison belong to different classes of calmodulin-binding proteins based on the motifs they contain; CaM-CaMKII is from the 1-10 class, CaM-MARCKS is from the basic class, whereas the others are from the 1-14 class of calmodulin-binding proteins (47Yap K.L. Kim J. Truong K. Sherman M. Yuan T. Ikura M. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2000; 1: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Further, CaM-smMLCK belongs to the basic 1-8-14, CaM-CaMKI is in the 1-14 and CaM-NOSIII is in the 1-5-8-14 subclass of the more general 1-14 class (47Yap K.L. Kim J. Truong K. Sherman M. Yuan T. Ikura M. J. Struct. Funct. Genomics. 2000; 1: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The superimposition of Cα atoms of either the N-lobe (6-72) or the C-lobe residues (83-147) of CaM in our structure with those of other CaM-peptide complexes gave the following values: N-lobe r.m.s.d. = 0.77-1.31 Å (67 Cα atoms superimposed) and C-lobe r.m.s.d. = 0.68-1.19 Å (65 Cα atoms superimposed).

Following expression, the newly synthesized IRAP protein traffics to the perinuclear insulin-sensitive compartment and acquires insulin sensitivity 6-9 h following biosynthesis. Knockdown of GGA1 by RNA interference prevented IRAP from entering, but not exiting, the insulin-responsive compartment. Mutation of the dileucine motif at positions 76 and 77 (EGFP-IRAP/AA76,77), but not the dileucine motif at positions 53 and 54, resulted in the rapid default of the reporter to the cell surface beginning at 3 h following biosynthesis. Alanine substitution of 9 residues amino- or carboxyl-terminal to LL76,77 did not perturb basal intracellular sequestration or abrogate insulin-stimulated IRAP translocation. Moreover, a dominant interfering GGA mutant (VHS-GAT) potently inhibited insulin-stimulated translocation of EGFP-IRAP/WT but did not block the constitutive exocytotic trafficking of EGFP-IRAP/AA76,77. In addition, the EGFP-IRAP/WT and EGFP-IRAP/AA76,77 constructs occupied morphologically distinct tubulovesicular compartments in the perinuclear region.

The secretory pathway of eukaryotic cells is functionally organized into a series of discrete subcellular membrane compartments, each uniquely outfitted with a relatively stable population of resident proteins (1Mellman I. Warren G. Cell. 2000; 100: 99-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 2Munro S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Against this fairly constant backdrop, many proteins transiently occupy a succession of membrane compartments before reaching their final destinations. In addition, a select few proteins are initially sequestered within subcellular compartments until an appropriate extracellular signal triggers their regulated exocytosis. Regardless of the specific trafficking itinerary, cargo proteins harbor intrinsic targeting information that directs their subcellular localization (3Bonifacino J.S. Traub L.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar). Protein targeting begins at the level of the endoplasmic reticulum, which represents the entry point into the secretory pathway for both membrane and secreted proteins. Having cleared the quality control system of the endoplasmic reticulum, correctly folded cargo proteins are efficiently incorporated into COPII carrier vesicles prior to anterograde transport to the Golgi apparatus (4Tang B.L. Wang Y. Ong Y.S. Hong W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1744: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 5Antonny B. Schekman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism for intra-Golgi transport is still under debate, it is generally believed that cargo proteins lacking specific endoplasmic reticulum retrieval signals arrive at the Golgi complex and are subsequently transported through the stacked Golgi cisternae (6Bonifacino J.S. Glick B.S. Cell. 2004; 116: 153-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar, 7Rodriguez-Boulan E. Musch A. Biochim. Biophys.

The trans-Golgi network (TGN) 2The abbreviations used are: TGN, trans-Golgi network; IRAP, insulin-responsive aminopeptidase; IRC, insulin-responsive compartment; WT, wild type; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; HSP, high speed pellet; LSP, low speed pellet; PM, plasma membrane; Stx3, syntaxin 3. 2The abbreviations used are: TGN, trans-Golgi network; IRAP, insulin-responsive aminopeptidase; IRC, insulin-responsive compartment; WT, wild type; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; HSP, high speed pellet; LSP, low speed pellet; PM, plasma membrane; Stx3, syntaxin 3. is the final subcompartment of the Golgi complex and functions as a key sorting station for proteins and lipids. In this capacity, recent work has shown that the TGN is subdivided into functional domains that recruit distinct coat complexes (8Gleeson P.A. Lock J.G. Luke M.R. Stow J.L.

Indeed, a new family of clathrin adaptors, the GGA (Golgi-localized, γ-ear-containing, ADP-ribosylation factor-binding proteins), have recently been identified as key players in transmembrane cargo selection at the TGN (10Boman A.L.

The three mammalian GGA isoforms are modular adaptors, each comprised of an amino-terminal VHS domain, a middle GAT domain, a hinge region, and a carboxyl-terminal GAE domain. The VHS domain interacts with a consensus DXXLL sorting motif found in the cytosolic tails of a subset of transmembrane cargo proteins, including the cation-dependent and independent mannose-6-phosphate receptors, sortilin, and LRP3, among others. The GAT domain binds GTP-loaded ADP-ribosylation factor during GGA-mediated coat recruitment to the TGN, the hinge region interacts with clathrin, and the GAE domain binds several accessory coat proteins (15Bonifacino J.S.

Recently, we investigated the sorting of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter GLUT4 in the Golgi region of adipocytes (17Watson R.T. Khan A.H. Furukawa M. Hou J.C. Li L. Kanzaki M. Okada S.

After electroporation, the cells were seeded on collagen-coated glass coverslips and allowed to recover for various times as described in the figure legends. For siRNA-mediated knockdown of GGA1, three different siRNA oligonucleotides were used: GGG CGA CCA GAC CUA CAA UGA, GCA GUG AGG ACC UCA UGA AGG, and GAC CAG AAG CGG AUG GAA AUG; 1 nm of each of the three siRNAs were electroporated into adipocytes (170 V, 950 microfarads). For the corresponding control experiments, 1 nm of each of the following three scrambled siRNA oligonucleotides were used: UCA CCA CGC GAG CGG AAA UGA, ACA CUU CCG AGG GAG GAA UGG, and AAC AGC CGG AAG UGA GGA AUG. Time Course Experiments—Transfected adipocytes were allowed to recover for 3-24 h prior to insulin stimulation as previously described (17Watson R.T. Khan A.H. Furukawa M. Hou J.C. Li L. Kanzaki M. Okada S. Kandror K.V. Pessin J.E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2059-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The cells that were treated with insulin at the 3-h time point post-transfection were plated directly into serum-free medium. For all other time points the cells were first plated in complete medium and then switched to serum-free medium 2-3 h prior to insulin stimulation. The incubation with or without 100 nm insulin for 30 min was done at the determined time to end the experiments exactly 3, 6, 9, and 12 h after transfection, at which time the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for wide field fluorescent microscopy. Translocation data in 3T3L1 adipocytes are expressed as the means ± S.E. of cells showing a plasma membrane ring, obtained by counting 50 cells/condition in three to five independent experiments. Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy and Image Analysis—Following the individual experimental procedure, the cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 0.2% Triton X-100, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and blocked with 5% donkey serum plus 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. Primary and secondary antibodies were used at 1:100 dilutions (unless otherwise indicated) in blocking solution and samples were mounted on glass slides with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). The cells were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal fluorescent microscope. Subcellular Fractionation and Western Blotting—Adipocytes were electroporated with 50 μg of EGFP-IRAP DNA and allowed to recover for various times prior to serum starvation and insulin stimulation as indicated in the figure legend. The cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in HES buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 225 mm sucrose, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin), and sheared by 10 passes through a ball-bearing homogenizer. Differential centrifugation was used to fractionate adipocytes as described previously (58Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys.

Total protein in the high speed pellet (HSP), low speed pellet (LSP), and plasma membrane (PM) fractions was quantified using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Equal protein amounts from each of the subcellular fractions were loaded onto 4-12% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels, subjected to electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with a polyclonal GFP antibody. Entry of Newly Synthesized IRAP into, but Not Exit from, the Insulin-responsive Compartment Is Dependent upon GGA Function—We showed previously that the intracellular compartmentalization and insulin-stimulated translocation of the EGFP-IRAP/WT reporter construct is indistinguishable from that of endogenous IRAP and GLUT4 (54Elmendorf J.S.

Physiol. 2005; 289: E746-E752Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported that the GGA clathrin adaptors function during the entry of newly synthesized GLUT4 into the insulin responsive storage compartment (17Watson R.T. Khan A.H. Furukawa M. Hou J.C. Li L. Kanzaki M. Okada S. Kandror K.V. Pessin J.E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2059-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To examine the potential role of GGA1 function in the initial sorting and regulated trafficking IRAP into and out of the IRC in adipocytes, we first determined the time course of expression of GGA1 during the differentiation of 3T3L1 adipocytes (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, GGA1 expression levels showed a marked induction between days 2 and 3 of differentiation, a time frame that is coincident with the formation of the insulin-responsive compartment (61El-Jack A.K. Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1581-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We next utilized siRNA-mediated gene silencing to reduce the expression levels of GGA1 (Fig. 1B). Although GGA1 protein levels remained unchanged relative to scrambled siRNA controls at 6 and 12 h following transfection (Fig. 1B, lanes 1-4), at the 24-h time point following transfection with GGA1 siRNAs, a substantial reduction of GGA1 protein levels was observed compared with cells transfected with scrambled siRNA (Fig. 1B, lanes 5 and 6). GGA1 protein levels were further decreased at 48 and 72 h following siRNA transfection (Fig. 1B, lanes 7-10). This reduction in GGA1 protein levels was specific because there was no significant effect on the expression of protein kinase B (also referred to as Akt) (Fig. 1B) and TUG (data not shown). Previously, we observed that newly synthesized IRAP protein requires 6-9 h following expression to acquire insulin responsiveness (Fig. 2 and Ref. 60Liu G. Hou J.C. Watson R.T. Pessin J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: E746-E752Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In contrast, the siRNA-mediated knockdown of GGA1 protein required 24-48 h (Fig. 1B), providing us with a window of opportunity to determine whether GGA functions in either the biosynthetic entry and/or exit of IRAP from the IRC. 3T3L1 adipocytes were first transfected with the EGFP-IRAP/WT reporter. Twelve h later, the cells were transfected a second time with GGA1 siRNA (or scrambled siRNA control), and 60 h later treated without or with 100 nm insulin. Under these experimental conditions, EGFP-IRAP/WT has been synthesized and reached its steady-state intracellular distribution prior to the loss of GGA1 protein. Expression of the IRAP reporter before the decrease in GGA1 protein had no significant effect on the extent of insulin-stimulated translocation of EGFP-IRAP/WT (Fig. 1C). These data demonstrate that once IRAP enters into the IRC, insulin-stimulated exit is independent of GGA1 function. We next knocked down GGA1 protein levels first, prior to the expression of the EGFP-IRAP/WT reporter (Fig. 1D). In one set of experiments, adipocytes were transfected with GGA1 siRNA, and then 36 h later they were transfected again with EGFP-IRAP/WT. The cells were then allowed to recover for 12 h and treated without and with insulin. In a second set of experiments, adipocytes were transfected with the GGA1 siRNA, and then 60 h later were transfected again with the EGFP-IRAP/WT reporter. The cells were then allowed to recover for 12 h and treated without or with insulin. Under both of these conditions, a specific and marked inhibition of insulin-stimulated IRAP translocation was observed (Fig. 1D). These data demonstrate that GGA1 is required for the biosynthetic acquisition of insulin responsiveness. Taken together, these data establish that GGA1 functions in the initial biosynthetic entry of IRAP into the IRC but does not affect its ability to exit from this compartment. A Dileucine Motif at Positions 76 and 77 (LL76,77) Is Required for Insulin-responsive Compartmentalization of Newly Synthesized IRAP—Having established a role for GGA in the biosynthetic sorting of IRAP into the IRC, we next compared the time course and GGA sensitivity of various IRAP mutations. The cytosolic domain of IRAP, when fused to the transmembrane and extracellular regions of the human transferrin receptor, IRAP (1-109)-TR, displays all the established trafficking characteristics of the IRAP protein (50Subtil A.

Moreover, a 30-amino acid minimal region (amino acids 55-84) of IRAP was found to be functionally sufficient and to faithfully recapitulate the intracellular trafficking and insulin responsiveness of the parent IRAP (1-109)-TR construct under steady-state conditions (50Subtil A.

We found that IRAP (1-109)-TR was efficiently retained in intracellular compartments at the 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-h time points following transient expression in the absence of insulin (Fig. 2A). Beginning at 6 h after expression, IRAP (1-109)-TR displayed a small but readily observable insulin-stimulated translocation to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A). At the 9- and 12-h time points, IRAP (1-109)-TR exhibited a robust cell surface accumulation following acute insulin stimulation. In addition, the insulin-stimulated translocation of IRAP (1-109)-TR was potently inhibited at all time points examined when coexpressed with the dominant interfering VHS-GAT domains of GGA (Fig. 2B). As expected, the IRAP minimal unit, IRAP (55-84)-TR, also resulted in a trafficking behavior and insulin responsiveness that was indistinguishable from IRAP (1-109)-TR (Fig. 2C). In addition, the ability of IRAP (55-84)-TR to respond to insulin was potently inhibited when coexpressed with the VHS-GAT dominant interfering GGA construct (Fig. 2D). We next undertook to identify potential sorting motifs present within the cytosolic domain of IRAP. Previous work had identified a dileucine motif at positions 76 and 77 (LL76,77) that was critical for endocytosis of IRAP from the plasma membrane and subsequent endosomal sorting (53Johnson A.O. Lampson M.A. McGraw T.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 367-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Because the IRAP (55-84)-TR chimera contains the LL76,77 motif, we mutated these residues to alanines, generating the IRAP (55-84)-TR/AA76,77 construct (Fig. 2, E and F). The IRAP (55-84)-TR/AA76,77 mutant reporter showed a consistent increase in basal cell surface localization at the 3-h time point that dramatically increased over the time course examined (Fig. 2E). Because the plasma membrane accumulation was quite pronounced, there was no additional significant increase in response to insulin stimulation (Fig. 2E). Moreover, coexpression of VHS-GAT had no significant effect on the cell surface localization of the IRAP (55-84)-TR/AA76,77 construct (Fig. 2F). These data further demonstrate that the minimal IRAP (55-84)-TR construct contains all the necessary targeting information to direct efficient GGA-sensitive perinuclear sorting into the insulin-responsive storage compartment.

This interaction was verified in overlay, pulldown, and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Deletion mapping confined the binding to the C terminus of neurochondrin and to the proximal C terminus of MCHR1, a region known to be involved in G protein binding and signal transduction. This region of the MCHR1 is also able to interact with the actin- and intermediate filament-binding protein, periplakin. Interactions of MCHR1 with neurochondrin and periplakin were competitive, indicating that these two proteins bind to overlapping regions of MCHR1. Although neurochondrin did not interfere with melanin-concentrating hormone-mediated internalization of the receptor, it did inhibit G protein-coupled signal transduction via both Gαi/o and Gαq/11 family G proteins as measured by each of melanin-concentrating hormone-induced G protein-activated inwardly rectifying K+ channel activity of voltage-clamped amphibian oocytes, by calcium mobilization in transfected mammalian cells, and by reduction in the capacity of melanin-concentrating hormone to promote binding of [35S]guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate to both Gαo1 and Gα11.

Recently, evidence has accumulated that specific functions of many GPCRs, including desensitization, internalization, subcellular distribution, and signal transduction, can be regulated via multiple interactions with proteins that bind to the intracellular C terminus of the receptors (17Brzostowski J.A.

We have previously used the C-terminal tail of rat MCHR1 as bait in a yeast two-hybrid assay to screen a human brain cDNA library for intracellular interacting proteins. This screen resulted in the identification of both a zinc finger protein termed MCHR1-interacting zinc finger protein (MIZIP) (22Bächner D. Kreienkamp H. Richter D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 526: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and the actin- and intermediate filament-binding protein periplakin (23Murdoch H. Feng G.J. Bachner D. Ormiston L. White J.H.

Although the consequences of interactions between the MCHR1 and MIZIP remain to be resolved (22Bächner D. Kreienkamp H. Richter D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 526: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), periplakin inhibits G protein-coupled signal transduction of the MCHR1 (23Murdoch H. Feng G.J. Bachner D. Ormiston L.

Our results indicate that NCDN interacts with the proximal C terminus of MCHR1, and in a similar manner to periplakin inhibits MCH-induced signal transduction. This reflects that periplakin and NCDN bind to overlapping regions of the MCHR1. The co-expression of MCHR1 and NCDN in specific neurons of rodent brain suggests that NCDN may play a role in modulating MCH-mediated functions in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Construction—Generation of a cDNA encoding the C-terminal fragment of the rat MCHR1 (amino acids 299-353) cloned in pAS2 (BD Biosciences) was described previously (23Murdoch H.

Similarly, fragments of rat and human NCDN were generated by PCR and cloned into the yeast fish vector pACTII.For the generation of recombinant fusion proteins, the EcoRI/XhoI fragment of clone L22 of the human NCDN cDNA was cloned into the vector pGEX-4T2 (GE Healthcare) downstream of glutathione S-transferase (GST), providing a 57.5-kDa GST-NCDN fusion protein. A rat MCHR1 cDNA fragment (nucleotides 915-1085) was generated by PCR and cloned into the dehydrofolate reductase (DHFR)-HIS vector pQE40 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), providing a 30-kDa 6xHIS-DHFR-C-terminal MCHR1 fusion protein, as described (23Murdoch H.

Maruyama K. Kume H. Kuzume H. Obata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal anti-T7 antibody was obtained from Novagen; mouse monoclonal anti-Myc antibody was from Sigma; rabbit polyclonal anti-MCHR1 antiserum was from Alpha Diagnostics (San Antonio, TX); and polyclonal affinity-purified chicken anti-MCHR1 antibody was from Chemicon (Chandlersford, Hampshire, UK). Rabbit anti-His6 and mouse anti-GST were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology/Autogen Bioclear.Yeast Two-hybrid Screen and Deletion Mapping—Transformation of the yeast reporter strain CG1945, screening of a human brain cDNA library in the yeast vector pACTII, and the β-galactosidase filter lift assay were performed as described (23Murdoch H.

Interaction was monitored as growth of yeast cells on selection media after 3-5 days at 30 °C.Overlay and GST Pulldown Assays—Fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL-21 (Stratagene, Cambridge UK) and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) or nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) following the instructions of the manufacturers. Overlay assays were performed as described (23Murdoch H. Feng G.J. Bachner D. Ormiston L. White J.H. Richter D. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8208-8220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In brief, 20 μg of GSTNCDN and GST control protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Inverclyde Biologicals, Bellshill, Lanarkshire, UK). Loading of proteins was estimated by staining of the membrane with 1% Ponceau Red. Unspecific binding was blocked by incubation of the membrane with TBS-T (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) supplemented with 10% low fat milk powder (3 h, 4 °C), followed by incubation for 14 h (4 °C) with constant shaking with 2 μg/ml DHFR-HIS-MCHR1 fusion protein in TBS-T. After washing with TBS-T, bound proteins were visualized using a polyclonal rabbit anti-MCHR1 antiserum and secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (GE Healthcare). Detection was performed using the ECL system (GE Healthcare) as indicated by the manufacturer.GST pulldown assays were performed as described (23Murdoch H. Feng G.J. Bachner D. Ormiston L. White J.H. Richter D. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8208-8220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In brief, 20 μg of GST control and GST-NCDN fusion proteins were coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100 supplemented with 2 μg/ml purified DHFR-HIS-MCHR1 fusion protein (3 h, 4 °C) with continuous shaking. After washing, bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting using the antisera described for the overlay assay. Similarly, interactions of GST fusion proteins comprising elements of the C-terminal region of human MCHR1 with His6-tagged full-length NCDN were employed to map the regions of interaction of MCHR1 with NCDN.Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 and COS7 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and transient transfection was performed using the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer.Immunocytochemistry—For immunofluorescence staining, cells were grown on glass coverslips treated with poly-d-lysine, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS as described (23Murdoch H. Feng G.J. Bachner D. Ormiston L. White J.H. Richter D. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8208-8220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). MCHR1 was detected using a mouse monoclonal anti-T7 antibody (Novagen), followed by incubation with a Cy-3-labeled anti-mouse secondary antiserum (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). NCDN was detected using rabbit polyclonal anti-NCDN-C and NCDN-N and Cy-2-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antisera (Dianova). Cells were mounted in glycerol gelatin (Sigma) and analyzed with a Leica Aristoplan fluorescence microscope. Images were captured with a CCD camera (Hamamatsu, Wel-wyn Garden City, UK) using the Openlab software (Improvision, Coventry, UK). Merged images were generated using the Photoshop software (Adobe Systems, Uxbridge UK).Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemical analyses were performed as described (26Böckers T.M. Mameza M.G. Kreutz M.R. Bockmann J. Weise C. Buck F. Richter D. Gundelfinger E.D. Kreienkamp H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40104-40112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). All incubations were at room temperature except as specified. Free-floating 50-μm cryosections of postnatal day 12 and adult rat brain or 10-μm cryosections adhered to microscopic slides were post-fixed for 5 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS followed by incubation for 10 min with ice-cold methanol/acetone. After two washes with PBS-T (PBS with 0.05% Triton X-100), sections were blocked for 1 h with PBS-T complemented with 10% horse serum and incubated overnight at 4 °C under continuous shaking in PBS-T, 5% horse serum-complemented chicken anti-MCHR1 antibody, diluted 1:1000, and rabbit anti-NCDN-C or NCDN-N antisera, diluted 1:1000. As control, anti-MCHR1 antibody was preincubated with 10-fold excess of antigenic peptide. Sections were washed five times for 5 min with PBS-T and incubated with PBS-T complemented with donkey anti-goat antibodies, diluted 1:400, or donkey anti-chicken antibodies, diluted 1:200, both coupled to Cy2 (Dianova) and donkey anti-rabbit antibodies coupled to Cy3 (Dianova), diluted 1:800. Sections were washed five times for 5 min with PBS-T, rinsed with water, and mounted with glycerol/gelatin (Sigma). Fluorescence microscopy was performed as described above.Immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Immunoblots—Immunoprecipitation was performed as described (24Zitzer H. Honck H.H. Bachner D. Richter D. Kreienkamp H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32997-33001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In brief, cells grown to confluency on a 10-cm plastic cell culture dish were lysed in 1 ml of RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, protease inhibitor mixture “Complete” (Roche Applied Science)) on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min. For immunoprecipitation, cleared lysates were incubated with anti-T7-agarose (50-μl suspension; Novagen) or anti-Myc-agarose (50-μl suspension; Alpha Diagnostics, San Antonio, TX) for 2-4 h at 4 °C under continuous agitation. Precipitates were washed five times with RIPA buffer and released by boiling with SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and analyzed by immunoblotting using mouse monoclonal anti-T7 antibody, rabbit polyclonal anti-MCHR1 antibody, or rabbit polyclonal anti-NCDN-N or NCDN-C antibody. Detection of bound antibodies was performed using horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody and the ECL detection system (GE Healthcare), according to the instructions of the manufacturer.Quantitative Internalization Assay—Quantitative internalization assays were performed as described (27Pfeiffer M. Koch T. Schroder H. Laugsch M. Hollt V. Schulz S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19762-19772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In brief, 24 h after transfection HEK293 cells were split at a density of 2 × 105 per well onto poly-d-lysine-treated 24-well plates. The next day, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with monoclonal anti-T7 antibody (1:5000; Novagen) for 2 h in serum-free DMEM at 4 °C, followed by incubation with DMEM supplemented with MCH (10-12 to 10-6 m) for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:10,000; GE Healthcare) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and incubated with 200 μl of 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) solution (Sigma) for 10-30 min. 100 μl from each well was transferred to a 96-well plate and analyzed at 405 nm using a microplate reader. All measurements were performed in duplicate. Data from three independent experiments were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad, San Diego). For each set of measurements, a nonlinear regression analysis was performed, and the maximum of the dose-response curve was determined. Each reading point was then normalized to this maximum value (Emax), and a new linear regression analysis over all normalized reading points was performed.Expression in Xenopus Oocytes—Functional expression in Xenopus oocytes was essentially performed as described previously (4Bächner D. Kreienkamp H. Weise C. Buck F. Richter D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 522-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Briefly, cDNAs of full-length rat MCHR1, full-length rat NCDN, and full-length mouse MIZIP were cloned in the Xenopus expression vector pGEMHE, which contained Xenopus β-globin 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions. cRNAs were in vitro transcribed using T7-RNA polymerase and NheI-linearized plasmids and co-injected with GIRK1 cRNA as described (4Bächner D. Kreienkamp H. Weise C. Buck F. Richter D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 522-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). 3-5 days after injection, oocytes were superfused with ND-96 medium (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) and whole cells clamped at -60 mV for recordings. For agonist measurements, the medium was changed to high K+ medium (hK, ND-96 with 96 mm KCl and 2 mm NaCl). After the initial inward current had reached a plateau, MCH was applied in hK. MCH treatment was terminated by wash out with hK and a subsequent switch to ND-96 medium. For concentration-response curves, measurements of three independent experiments with 2-4 individual oocytes each were subjected to nonlinear regression analyses using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad).[Ca2+]i Assays—The capacity of MCH to elevate [Ca2+]i was monitored in single HEK293 cells expressing MCHR1 with or without NCDN essentially as described by Liu et al. (28Liu S. Carrillo J.J. Pediani J. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25707-25714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Equivalent experiments were performed following transient expression of the human histamine H1 receptor with or without NCDN. In brief, transfected cells were loaded with Fura-2 dye by incubation for 20 min at 37 °C in DMEM containing the membrane-permeable acetoxymethyl ester form of the dye (1.5 μm). The cells were then observed and recorded using a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope with a ×40 oil immersion lens. Excitation wavelength was alternated between 340 and 380 nm, and the Fura-2 emission at 510 nm was recorded with a high resolution CCD camera. Metafluor imaging software (Universal Imaging Corp., Downing, PA) was used to control the monochromator, CCD camera and for recording and processing the cell image data. All experiments were undertaken in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ in saline solution comprising 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, 10 mmd-glucose, and 0.01 mm EDTA, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. In a range of studies, an internal ribosome entry site-based plasmid that allows expression of both NCDN and green fluorescent protein was employed. The intensity of GFP fluorescence was measured in individual cells selected by visual examination to display a range of signal. The intensity measurements were then correlated with peak Fura-2 fluorescence ratio following addition of 1 μm MCH.[35S]GTPγS Binding Assays—[35S]GTPγS binding experiments were initiated by the addition of membranes of HEK293 cells transfected to express MCHR1 and either Gαo1 or Gα11 with or without NCDN to an assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 μm guanosine 5′-diphosphate, 0.2 mm ascorbic acid, 50 nCi of [35S]GTPγS) containing the indicated concentrations of MCH. Nonspecific binding was determined in the same conditions but in the presence of 100 μm GTPγS. Reactions were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C and were terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of ice-cold buffer, containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl. The samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the resulting pellets were resuspended in solubilization buffer (100 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1.25% Nonidet P-40) plus 0.2% SDS. Samples were precleared with pansorbin (Calbiochem), followed by immunoprecipitation with antiserum CQ (for Gα11) (29Mitchell F.M. Mullaney I. Godfrey P.P. Arkinstall S.J. Wakelam M.J.O. Milligan G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 287: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) or antiserum OC (for Gαo1) (30Mullaney I. Magee A.I. Unson C.G. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Finally, the immunocomplexes were washed twice with solubilization buffer, and bound [35S]GTPγS was estimated by liquid scintillation spectrometry.Biotinylation Experiments—HEK293 cells were split into 6-well plates and transfected 24 h later. The cells were allowed to grow for a further 48 h and then incubated with or without 1 μm MCH for 30 min at 37 °C. The plates were placed on ice, and the media were removed; the cells were washed two times with 2 ml of borate buffer (10 mm boric acid, 154 mm NaCl, 7.2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, pH 9.0), and 1 ml of 0.8 mm EZ-Link Sulfo-NHSSS-Biotin (Pierce) (31Canals M. Jenkins L. Kellett E. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16757-16767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) in borate buffer was added and incubated on ice in the dark for 15 min. The biotin solution was replaced with stop solution (0.192 m glycine, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3) for 5 min on ice, and the cells were then harvested in 0.5 ml each of 1× RIPA (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, 5% ethylene glycol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined by BCA assay and equalized. 100 μl of ImmunoPure immobilized streptavidin (Pierce) was added and allowed to adsorb at 4 °C for 1 h with rotation. The immobilized streptavidin was pelleted by centrifugation at 150 × g for 2 min at 4 °C and then washed three times with 0.5 ml of 1× RIPA. Biotinylated proteins were eluted with 100 μl of sample buffer containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.RESULTSIdentification of Neurochondrin as an MCHR1-interacting Protein and Mapping of Interacting Regions—To identify potential cytoplasmic MCHR1-interacting proteins, the C-terminal tail of the rat MCHR1 (amino acids 299-353) was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen against a human brain cDNA library.

Michael Eisenstein reports. DNA microarrays were developed over 15 years ago as a way of determining the expression levels of many genes at once. They quickly became a staple of biological and medical research, for instance in identifying genes involved in human disease. Yet there are lingering doubts as to their reliability. This week's Technology Feature reports on new developments that are making microarrays more powerful, and more reliable, than ever."
https://openalex.org/W2022600898,"We have used low-energy electron microscopy to measure step motion on Si(111) and Si(001) near dislocations during growth and sublimation. Steps on Si(111) exhibit the classic rotating Archimedean spiral motion, as predicted by Burton, Cabrera, and Frank. Steps on Si(001), however, move in a strikingly different manner. Thestrain-relieving anomalous behavior can be understood in detail by considering how the local step velocity is affected by the nonuniform strain field arising from the dislocation. We show how the dynamic step-flow pattern is related to the dislocation slip system."
https://openalex.org/W2080544710,"Vertebrate GATA transcription factors have been classified into two subgroups; GATA-1, GATA-2, and GATA-3 are expressed in hematopoietic cells, whereas GATA-4, GATA-5, and GATA-6 are expressed in mesoendoderm-derived tissues. We previously discovered that expression of GATA-2 or GATA-3 under the transcriptional control for the Gata1 gene eliminates lethal anemia in Gata1 germ line mutant mice (Gata1.05/Y). Here, we show that the GATA-4 expression by the same regulatory cassette prolongs the life span of Gata1.05/Y embryos from embryonic day 12.5 to 15.5 but fails to abrogate its embryonic lethality. Gata1.05/Y mice bearing the GATA-4 transgene showed impaired maturation of both primitive and definitive erythroid cells and defective erythroid cell expansion in fetal liver. Moreover, the incidence of apoptosis was observed prominently in primitive erythroid cells. In contrast, a GATA-4-GATA-1 chimeric protein prepared by linking the N-terminal region of GATA-4 to the C-terminal region of GATA-1 significantly promoted the differentiation and survival of primitive erythroid cells, although this protein is still insufficient for rescuing Gata1.05/Y embryos from lethal anemia. These data thus show a functional incompatibility between hematopoietic and endodermal GATA factors in vivo and provide evidence indicating specific roles of the C-terminal region of GATA-1 in primitive erythropoiesis.

These data thus show a functional incompatibility between hematopoietic and endodermal GATA factors in vivo and provide evidence indicating specific roles of the C-terminal region of GATA-1 in primitive erythropoiesis. The GATA family transcription factors play critical roles in determining cell fate, cell proliferation, differentiation, and the survival of hematopoietic cells. Three of the GATA factors, GATA-1, GATA-2, and GATA-3, are expressed in hematopoietic lineages and are referred to as hematopoietic GATA factors. The other three GATA factors, GATA-4, GATA-5, and GATA-6, are referred to as endodermal GATA factors. Individual hematopoietic GATA factors show a unique expression profile in the hematopoietic system (see Ref. 1Ohneda K. Yamamoto M. Acta Haematol. 2002; 108: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar and references therein). Namely, GATA-1 is expressed in erythroid cells, megakaryocytic cells, eosinophils, and mast cells. Although GATA-2 is expressed in similar cell lineages, its expression in erythroid cells is restricted to immature progenitors. GATA-2 is expressed in hematopoietic stem cells and multipotential progenitors (2Suzuki N. Ohneda O. Minegishi N. Nishikawa M. Ohta T. Takahashi S. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2202-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). GATA-3 is mainly expressed in Th2 lymphoid cells in the hematopoietic lineage.

A similar phenotype is observed in mice carrying the Gata1 gene knockdown mutation that causes a 95% reduction in GATA-1 mRNA in erythroid cells (4Takahashi S. Onodera K. Motohashi H. Suwabe N. Hayashi N. Yanai N. Nabesima Y. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12611-12615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We named this knockdown allele Gata1.05. Since the Gata1 gene is located on the X chromosome, this phenotype is observed in hemizygotic male embryos bearing the Gata1.05 mutation (Gata1.05/Y). Although GATA-2 expression is observed at extremely high levels in GATA-1-deficient cells (5Weiss M.J. Keller G. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1184-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), it fails to sustain erythroid cell differentiation. On the other hand, we previously discovered that transgenic expression of either GATA-2 or GATA-3 under the control of the Gata1 gene hematopoietic regulatory domain (G1HRD) (6Onodera K. Takahashi S. Nishimura S. Ohta J. Motohashi H. Yomogida K. Hayashi N. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4487-4492Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 7Motohashi H. Katsuoka F. Shavit J.A. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Cell. 2000; 103: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) successfully rescues Gata1.05/Y embryos from the embryonic lethality (8Takahashi S. Shimizu R. Suwabe N. Kuroha T. Yoh K. Ohta J. Nishimura S. Lim K.C. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Blood. 2000; 96: 910-916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, if expressed under regulatory influences associated with the Gata1 gene, both GATA-2 and GATA-3 can replace GATA-1 function in erythroid cells during hematopoietic lineage development. The question arising from this discovery is whether endodermal GATA factors can substitute for GATA-1 activity when forcibly expressed in erythroid cells. Endodermal GATA factors possess conserved zinc fingers and bind to the consensus GATA box sequence, but their expression profiles and biological roles are quite different from those of the hematopoietic GATA factors (see Ref. 9Patient R.K. McGhee J.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 416-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar and references therein). Therefore, based on the best available knowledge, we surmised the following two possibilities. First, if expressed in erythroid cells under G1HRD regulation, the endodermal GATA factors may activate GATA-1 target genes and sustain a physiological level of erythropoiesis. Alternatively, only the hematopoietic GATA factors may be able to compensate for GATA-1 deficiency. A recent study of Drosophila GATA factors supports the latter possibility. In Drosophila, the hematopoietic GATA factor Serpent is essential for the formation of the hematopoietic cells (10Tepass U. Fessler L.I. Aziz A. Hartenstein V. Development. 1994; 120: 1829-1837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Rehorn K.P. Thelen H. Michelson A.M. Reuter R. Development. 1996; 122: 4023-4031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lebestky T. Chang T. Hartenstein V. Banerjee U. Science. 2000; 288: 146-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), whereas the endodermal GATA factor Pannier functions during heart development (13Gajewski K. Fossett N. Molkentin J.D. Schulz R.A. Development. 1999; 126: 5679-5688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Forced expression of mouse GATA-4 in Drosophila activates cardiogenic gene transcription and increases the production of cardiac cells, whereas neither the hematopoietic GATA factor Serpent nor mouse GATA-1 can serve as a cardiogenic factor (13Gajewski K. Fossett N. Molkentin J.D. Schulz R.A. Development. 1999; 126: 5679-5688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the cardiogenic role is evolutionarily conserved among the endodermal GATA factors and cannot be replaced by the hematopoietic GATA factors. In order to test these two possibilities, we generated transgenic mice expressing GATA-4 under the control of G1HRD and examined its ability to rescue Gata1.05/Y embryos from lethal anemia. Unlike GATA-2 and GATA-3, GATA-4 failed to fully rescue the Gata1.05/Y embryos from lethal anemia, yet it prolonged their survival. This result thus unequivocally demonstrates that GATA-4 incompletely replaces the function of GATA-1 in erythroid cells. To further delineate the difference between GATA-1 and GATA-4, we constructed a GATA-4-GATA-1 (G4G1) chimeric protein in which the N-terminal region of GATA-4 is linked to the C-terminal region of GATA-1 and tested its ability in erythroid cells in vivo. This chimeric protein supported the differentiation and survival of primitive erythroid cells almost completely, but the protein was still insufficient to support definitive erythropoiesis in fetal liver. These results demonstrate that the hematopoietic GATA factors possess conserved functional properties that cannot be compensated for entirely by the endodermal GATA factors.

The resultant construct was digested with SalI and purified by a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The G4G1 chimeric cDNA fragment was generated by PCR, verified by DNA sequencing, and inserted 3′ of the G1HRD. To examine the transcriptional activity of the G4G1 chimeric protein, pEF-G4G1HA plasmid containing the EF-1α promoter (15Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar) was constructed and co-transfected into QT6 cells with pRBGP3-MαP, a reporter plasmid containing triplicate mouse GATA sites originating from the α-globin promoter (MαP) and the luciferase gene (16Igarashi K. Kataoka K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1994; 367: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The luciferase assay was carried out using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Renilla luciferase activity from the expression plasmid pRL-TK was monitored and used to normalize the firefly luciferase activity. G1HRD-GATA-4 transgenic mice and G1HRD-G4G1HA transgenic mice were generated by microinjection of purified DNA into fertilized BDF1 eggs using standard procedures (17Wassarman P.M. DePamphilis M.L. Guide to Techniques in Mouse Development. Academic Press, Inc, New York1993Google Scholar). Founders were screened by PCR using genomic DNA prepared from tail. PCR amplification was carried out using the following primers. For GATA-4 transgenic mice, GATA-4 sense (5′-GATTCAAACCAGAAAACGGAAG-3′) and GATA-4 anti-sense (5′-ATGTCTGAGTGACAGGAGATGC-3′) primers were used. For G4G1HA transgenic mice, G4G1 sense (5′-ATGCCTGTGGCCTCTATCAC-3′) and G4G1 antisense (5′-TTCCTCGTCTGGATTCCATC-3′) primers were used. The transgenic males obtained were mated with Gata1.05/X mice (4Takahashi S. Onodera K. Motohashi H. Suwabe N. Hayashi N. Yanai N. Nabesima Y. Yamamoto M. J. Biol.

The primers used for genotyping (Neo and Zfy) were as described previously (4Takahashi S. Onodera K. Motohashi H. Suwabe N. Hayashi N. Yanai N. Nabesima Y. Yamamoto M. J. Biol.

Immunoblot Analysis—Whole cell lysates were prepared from the fetal livers and hearts of E12.5 embryos. Briefly, fetal livers or hearts were sonicated in 300 μ l of 1× SDS sample buffer and subsequently heat-denatured. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed using anti-GATA-4 (C-20) or anti-HA (Y-11) antibodies. Anti-LaminB (M-20) antibody was used for normalizing the mass of the proteins. The antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Histological Analysis—E8.5 embryos and E12.5 fetal livers were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in wax. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For immunohistochemical analysis, serial sections were processed with anti-GATA-4 antibody and anti-ϵy-globin antibody (kindly provided by Dr. Tadao Atsumi). Diaminobenzidine was used as chromogen, and methyl green was used for counterstaining. To collect embryonic peripheral blood cells, E12.5 embryos were dissected free of decidual tissues. After removal of the placenta, embryos were washed in 2% fetal bovine serum/phosphate-buffered saline three times and bled from severing the head and umbilical vessels. Peripheral blood cells were washed at 1,500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Cytospin samples were prepared from ∼30,000 cells spun at 300 rpm for 3 min using CYTOSPIN3 (SHANDON). These preparations were processed for Wright-Giemsa staining. Peripheral blood samples of E18.5 embryos were taken from carotid artery and jugular vein. Peripheral blood smears were prepared and stained with Wright-Giemsa staining. Count of Total Fetal Liver Cells—Single-cell suspensions prepared from E12.5 fetal livers were washed by centrifugation at 1,500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 1 ml of 2% fetal bovine serum/phosphate-buffered saline. The cell number was counted using a hemocytometer. Flow Cytometry Analysis—Single-cell suspensions from livers or peripheral blood cells were prepared from E12.5 and E13.5 embryos as described above. The cells were incubated in 2% fetal bovine serum/phosphate-buffered saline containing Fc block (CD16/CD32; 1:200 dilution) for 15 min on ice and stained with antibodies for 20 min on ice. The antibodies phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-Ter119, allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-c-Kit, biotin-conjugated CD71, and allophycocyanin-conjugated streptavidin were obtained from BD Biosciences. The apoptotic cells were verified using Annexin V-allophycocyanin according to the manufacturer's instructions. The samples were analyzed using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). The data were analyzed with the CellQuest program. The experiments were performed three times independently and confirmed the reproducibility. In Vitro Colony Assays—Fetal livers of E12.5 and E13.5 embryos were dispersed into single-cell suspension. For CFU-E assays, 2 × 104 cells were plated in 1 ml of methylcellulose medium (MethoCult M3231; Stem Cell Technologies) and cultured for 2 days in the presence of 1 unit/ml erythropoietin (generous gifts from Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.). For BFU-E assays, 1 × 105 cells were plated in 1 ml of methylcellulose medium and cultured for 7 days in the presence of 2 units/ml erythropoietin and 100 ng/ml stem cell factor (generous gifts from Kirin Brewery). Colonies were stained with benzidine, and benzidine-positive colonies were counted. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from the peripheral blood cells of E12.5 embryos using ISOGEN (Nippon-gene) and then treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega). The cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript™II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random primer. To detect the expression of Bcl-XL, PCR amplification was performed as previously described (18Pan X. Ohneda O. Ohneda K. Lindeboom F. Iwata F. Shimizu R. Nagano M. Suwabe N. Philipsen S. Lim K.C. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22385-22394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The expression of EpoR (erythropoietin receptor) was detected using the sense primer 5′-AGGCCCCCTCTGTCTCCTACTTGCTGGG-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-AACTCGATGTGTCCGCTGTTGGCAGTGA-3′. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as an internal control. Gata1 Knockdown Mutants Harboring the G1HRD-GATA-4 Transgene Die in Utero—To examine whether GATA-4 can substitute for GATA-1 when expressed under the Gata1 gene regulatory cassette, we generated transgenic mice expressing GATA-4 under the control of G1HRD (Fig. 1A). We successfully established four transgenic lines, and two of these lines (Lines 2 and 4) were used in this study. To identify the production of transgene-derived GATA-4 protein, immunoblot analysis was performed using fetal livers at E12.5 (Fig. 1B). The GATA-4 protein level in fetal liver was comparable between Lines 2 and 4. The endogenous GATA-4 protein observed in the heart was similar in wild type and these two transgenic lines (Fig. 1B). It is of note that the expression level of GATA-4 transgene in fetal liver was comparable with that of endogenous GATA-4 in the heart. These transgenic mice were born at the expected frequency and were fertile. Peripheral blood counts of these transgenic mice were within the normal range in the adult stage (data not shown). We next examined whether the expression of GATA-4 under the control of G1HRD could rescue Gata1.05/Y embryos from lethal anemia. To this end, Gata1.05/X females were crossed with G1HRD-GATA-4 transgenic males, and the genotypes of the progeny were determined by PCR (Table 1). No male mice bearing the Gata1.05 allele were obtained from several litters in both transgenic lines, indicating that Gata1.05/Y embryos die in utero even in the presence of the GATA-4 transgene.TABLE 1Genotype of pups from mating Gata 1.05/X with GATA-4 transgenic miceLineNumber of pupsGata 1.05/YGATA-4 TG (—)GATA-4 TG (+)ObservedExpected249007463009 Open table in a new tab The genotypes of Line 2 and Line 4 embryos from E11.5 to E16.5 were examined (Table 2). Although in the absence of transgene all Gata1.05/Y mutants were found dead by E12.5, the majority of the Gata1.05/Y::GATA-4-TG compound mutants were alive at this stage. Furthermore, we observed nine Gata1.05/Y::GATA-4-TG embryos that survived until E13.5 and E15.5. These results thus demonstrate that, although the expression of GATA-4 is not sufficient for rescuing Gata1.05/Y mice from embryonic lethality, this substitution recapitulates the function of GATA-1 to some extent in the Gata1.05/Y embryos. Therefore, we referred to the surviving Gata1.05/Y embryos bearing GATA-4-TG (Gata1.05/Y::GATA-4-TG) as GATA-4-rescued embryos (G4R).TABLE 2Genotype of embryos from mating Gata 1.05/X with GATA-4 transgenic miceTime of analysisGata 1.05/YGata 1.05/Y::GATA-4 TGTotal number of embryosAliveDeadAliveDeadE11.5211020E12.5055250E13.5013318E14.5015355E15.5001338E16.5000427 Open table in a new tab Primitive Erythroid Cell Maturation Is Impaired in G4R—We observed primitive erythropoiesis in G4R embryos. At E8.5, primitive erythroid cells were observed in blood islands of the yolk sac. The gross appearance of the yolk sac (Fig. 2, A, E, and I) and hematoxylin and eosin staining of the sectioned blood islands (Fig. 2, B, F, and J) were similar in wild type, Gata1.05/Y, and G4R embryos. However, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that a large number of cells were positive for embryonic ϵy-globin in wild type and G4R embryos (Fig. 2, C and K), whereas very few cells were positive in the yolk sac of the Gata1.05/Y embryo (Fig. 2G). GATA-4 immunostaining was positive in the blood island cells of the G4R embryo, confirming the expression of the transgene (Fig. 2L). These results indicate that transgenic GATA-4 substituted for GATA-1 and induced embryonic globin gene expression at the early embryonic stage. At E12.5, G4R embryos (Fig. 3B) were easily distinguishable from wild type embryos (Fig. 3A) by their anemic appearance. The majority of the peripheral blood cells harbored basophilic or polychromatic cytoplasm and large nuclei in the G4R embryos (Fig. 3D), whereas those of wild type embryos were mature primitive erythroid cells showing orthochromatic cytoplasm and small nuclei (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these results indicate that, whereas the expression of embryonic ϵy-globin is rescued, both cytoplasmic and nuclear maturation is impaired in the G4R primitive erythroid cells. Maturation Arrest of Definitive Erythroid Cells in G4R Fetal Liver—At E12.5, the number of fetal liver cells in G4R embryos was less than one-third of wild type embryos (Fig. 4A), and, accordingly, G4R livers were much smaller than those of wild type (data not shown). A colony assay demonstrated a significant reduction in CFU-E formation in G4R embryos compared with wild type, whereas in contrast, the number of BFU-E colonies was comparable between G4R and wild type embryos (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that the progression of BFU-E to CFU-E is significantly impaired in G4R embryos. We further assessed the maturation stage of fetal liver erythroid cells by flow cytometry (FACS). The maturation status of erythroid cells has been characterized by the expression profiles of c-Kit, CD71, and Ter119 (19Socolovsky M. Nam H. Fleming M.D. Haase V.H. Brugnara C. Lodish H.F. Blood. 2001; 98: 3261-3273Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 20Zhang J. Socolovsky M. Gross A.W. Lodish H.F. Blood. 2003; 102: 3938-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Proerythroblasts are characterized as the c-Kit+Ter119- cell fraction. These cells differentiate into c-Kit-Ter119+ erythroblasts during maturation. The FACS profile of fetal liver cells demonstrated that this process was severely impaired in G4R embryos (Fig. 4C). Moreover, the frequency of the Ter119-CD71+ fraction that corresponds to proerythroblasts was increased in G4R embryos compared with wild type embryos (Fig. 4D, R2 fraction). Instead, the Ter119+CD71+ fraction corresponding to basophilic erythroblasts was reduced in G4R embryos compared with wild type (Fig. 4D, R3 fraction). Collectively, these FACS profiles demonstrate that erythroid differentiation is impaired at the proerythroblast stage in G4R embryos. Consistent with these results, Wright-Giemsa staining of fetal liver cells revealed that G4R erythroid cells are larger in size and with larger nuclei than wild type erythroid cells (Fig. 4E). At E14.5, the majority of circulating erythrocytes were enucleated in wild type embryos, whereas almost all circulating erythrocytes were nucleated in G4R embryos (Fig. 4F). These data demonstrate that in G4R embryos erythroid differentiation is affected at multiple stages of definitive erythropoiesis, suggesting that the expression of multiple genes may be attenuated in the G4R embryos. Therefore, it seems likely that maturation arrest of definitive erythroid cells in G4R embryos consequently results in defective expansion of fetal liver hematopoiesis and lethal anemia in the following gestation period. Transgenic Mouse Expressing GATA-4-GATA-1 Chimeric Protein—The data obtained so far show that, whereas the G1HRD-GATA-2 or -GATA-3 transgene could rescue Gata1.05/Y embryos from lethal anemia (8Takahashi S. Shimizu R. Suwabe N. Kuroha T. Yoh K. Ohta J. Nishimura S. Lim K.C. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Blood. 2000; 96: 910-916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the G1HRD-GATA-4 transgene could not, suggesting the presence of unique functional properties of hematopoietic GATA factors that cannot be replaced by endodermal GATA factors. To delineate the molecular basis of the differences between hematopoietic and endodermal GATA factors, we focused on the zinc finger region of the GATA factors, because there is divergence outside this region even among the hematopoietic GATA factors. Alignment of the zinc finger region sequences of six murine GATA factors revealed that 12 amino acid residues are conserved in hematopoietic but not in endodermal GATA factors (Fig. 5, yellow). These residues are frequently located in the adjacent region of the C-terminal zinc finger (CF). Therefore, in order to examine the contribution of these hematopoietic factor-conserved residues to the erythropoiesis in vivo, we generated transgenic mouse lines bearing GATA-4-GATA-1 (G4G1) chimeric protein and carried out complementation rescue analysis. In the chimeric G4G1 protein, the N-terminal region of GATA-4 (amino acid residues 1-251), including the N-terminal zinc finger (NF), is linked to the CF and adjacent C-terminal region of GATA-1 (amino acid residues 240-412; Fig. 6A). It turns out that 10 of the 12 residues described above are derived from the GATA-1 part or “hematopoietic” residues in this chimeric protein. To verify the protein expression, an HA tag was added to the C-terminal region of the G4G1 protein. This chimeric protein activated transcription of a GATA box-containing reporter when expressed in nonhematopoietic cultured cells (Fig. 6B) and bound to a consensus GATA sequence in gel mobility shift assays (data not shown). Two lines of G1HRD-G4G1-HA transgenic mice with different expression levels (Lines 1 and 2; Fig. 6C) were established. We also generated transgenic lines expressing wild type GATA-1 protein with an HA tag at the C-terminal end as controls. G4G1 Chimeric Protein Promotes Maturation of Primitive Erythroid Cells—To examine the activity of the G4G1 chimeric protein in hematopoiesis, we crossed G1HRD-G4G1-HA transgenic males with Gata1.05/X females. Only one transgenic male mouse bearing the Gata1.05 allele (G4G1R) was observed out of 90 neonates from the two transgenic lines, whereas Gata1.05/Y mice expressing the GATA-1-HA transgene (G1R) were born at the expected frequency, indicating that the G4G1HA protein fails to completely substitute for GATA-1 during embryonic erythropoiesis. However, we observed five G4G1R embryos alive at the E16.5 or later stage of gestation out of 35 embryos genotyped, revealing that G4G1R embryos can survive much longer than G4R during embryonic development (Table 3). We also found one embryo alive at E17.5 in 4 G4G1R embryos generated utilizing the other transgenic mouse line (data not shown).TABLE 3Genotype of embryos from mating Gata1.05/X with G4G1 transgenic miceTime of analysisGata1.05/YGata1.05/Y::G4G1 TGTotal number of embryosAliveDeadAliveDeadE12.5009048E13.5006050E14.5002013E16.5001014E17.5002010E18.5002011 Open table in a new tab One of the most significant differences between G4R and G4G1R was the macroscopic appearance of E12.5 embryos. The gross appearance of G4G1R embryos at E12.5 was indistinguishable from wild type embryos (Fig. 7, A and B, respectively), which is in clear contrast with the anemic appearance of E12.5 G4R embryos (Fig. 3B). It has been shown that the majority of circulating erythrocytes at E12.5 are derived from primitive erythropoiesis, whereas definitive erythroid cells proliferate rapidly in fetal liver at this stage (21Brotherton T.W. Chui D.H. Gauldie J. Patterson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2853-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Since G4R primitive erythroid cells showed impaired maturation at E12.5 (Fig. 3D), we examined whether the G4G1 protein promoted maturation of primitive erythroid cells using the peripheral blood of E12.5 embryos. Indeed, the morphology of peripheral blood from E12.5 embryos clearly differed among G4R, G4G1R, and wild type embryos. In wild type and G1R embryos, nearly 80% of cells showed typical features of matured primitive erythrocytes with orthochromatic cytoplasm and small nuclei (Fig. 7, C and F, respectively). In contrast, almost all G4R erythroid cells had a basophilic cytoplasm and large nuclei (Fig. 7E). In G4G1R embryos, the majority of the cells showed orthochromatic cytoplasm, but the frequency of polychromatic erythroblasts was slightly higher than in wild type embryos (Fig. 7D). Notably, the orthochromatic cells in G4G1R blood (Fig. 7D) were distinguishable from wild type (Fig. 7C) by the appearance of nuclei. In G4G1R cells, chromatin condensation was insufficient, and the size of nuclei (relative to cytoplasm) was larger than that of wild type cell nuclei. We also categorized the peripheral blood cells by counting each class of erythroblasts. Consistent with the morphological examination, G4R embryos contained many polychromatic erythroblasts, whereas wild type and G1R embryos contained predominantly orthochromatic erythroblasts (Fig. 7G). G4G1R embryos harbored many orthochromatic erythroblasts with larger nuclei (Fig. 7G, hatched columns). These results thus indicate that the G4G1 chimeric protein supports the differentiation of primitive erythroid cells much more dramatically than GATA-4 does. G4R Primitive Erythroid Cells, but Not G4G1R Cells, Undergo Apoptosis—In addition to the delay in cell maturation, we frequently found nuclear fragmented cells in the G4R peripheral blood cells at E12.5 (Fig. 7, E and H, arrows). These cells were also observed in G4G1R, albeit at a much low"
