https://openalex.org/W2034371181,"Antisera to the human cellular myc oncogene product were used to identify a human c-myc specific protein with a molecular weight of 65,000. Subcellular fractionation showed that the human c-myc protein is predominantly found in the cell nucleus. The p65Kc-myc protein binds to double- and single-stranded DNA as measured by a DNA affinity chromatography assay."
https://openalex.org/W2170586278,"We have determined which sequences at the right border of the T-DNA region of the nopaline C58 Ti plasmid are required for transfer and/or integration of the T-DNA into the plant cell genome. The results indicate that the 25 by T-DNA terminus repeat sequence, TGACAGGATATATTGGCGGGTAAAC, is directly responsible for T-DNA transfer; furthermore, this sequence is directional in its mode of action. A transfer-negative nononcogenic Ti plasmid derivative, pGV3852, was constructed, in which 3 kb covering the right T-DNA border region was substituted for by pBR322 sequences. The pBR322 sequences in pGV3852 provide a site for homologous recombination with pBR-derived plasmids containing sequences to assay for transfer activity. First, a 3.3 kb restriction fragment overlapping the deleted region in pGV3852 was shown to restore transfer activity. Second, a sequence of only 25 bp, the T-DNA terminus sequence, was shown to be sufficient to restore normal transfer activity. The transfer-promoting sequences are most active when reinserted in one orientation, that normally found in the Ti plasmid."
https://openalex.org/W1870391416,"Previous studies point to the acidic amino-terminal segment of band 3, the anion transport protein of the red cell, as the common binding site for hemoglobin and several of the glycolytic enzymes to the erythrocyte membrane. We now report on the interaction of hemoglobin with the synthetic peptide AcM-E-E-L-Q-D-D-Y-E-D-E, corresponding to the first 11 residues of band 3, and with the entire 43,000-Da cytoplasmic domain of the protein. In the presence of increasing concentrations of the peptide, the oxygen binding curve for hemoglobin is shifted progressively to the right, indicating that the peptide binds preferentially to deoxyhemoglobin. The dissociation constant for the deoxyhemoglobin-peptide complex at pH 7.2 in the presence of 100 mM NaCl is 0.31 mM. X-ray crystallographic studies were carried out to determine the exact mode of binding of the peptide to deoxyhemoglobin. The difference electron density map of the deoxyhemoglobin-peptide complex at 5 A resolution showed that the binding site extends deep (approximately 18 A) into the central cavity between the beta chains, along the dyad symmetry axis, and includes Arg 104 beta 1 and Arg 104 beta 2 as well as most of the basic residues within the 2,3-diphosphoglycerate binding site. The peptide appears to have an extended conformation with only 5 to 7 of the 11 residues in contact with hemoglobin. In agreement with the crystallographic studies, binding of the peptide to deoxyhemoglobin was blocked by cross-linking the beta chains at the entrance to the central cavity. Oxygen equilibrium studies showed that the isolated cytoplasmic fragment of band 3 also binds preferentially to deoxyhemoglobin. The binding of the 43,000-Da fragment to hemoglobin was inhibited in the cross-linked derivative indicating that the acidic amino-terminal residues in the intact cytoplasmic domain also bind within the central cavity of the hemoglobin tetramer."
https://openalex.org/W1549953248,"A new fucoganglioside, 6B, which accumulates in human colonic adenocarcinoma but is absent in normal colonic mucosa, was isolated from a monosialoganglioside fraction of colonic adenocarcinomas. The structure of this ganglioside was identified as shown below by methylation analysis, direct probe mass spectrometry, and enzymatic degradation followed by examination of the degradation products with specific monoclonal antibodies. (formula; see text) The hybridoma (FH6) secreting a monoclonal IgM antibody directed to this glycolipid was selected by reactivity of the antibody with this ganglioside and lack of reactivity with other glycolipids having a closely related structure, such as sialosyllactoneotetraosylceramide (IV3NeuAcnLc4), sialosyllactofucopentaosy(III)ceramide (IV3NeuAcIII3FucnLc4), sialosyllactofucopentaosy(II)ceramide (sialosyl-Lea glycolipid; IV3NeuAcIII4FucLc4), and 6C fucoganglioside (sialosyl 2 leads to 6 fucoganglioside; VI6NeuAcIII3FucnLc6). The antibody was highly reactive with a large variety of human cancer cells, but was less reactive or did not react with a variety of normal cells."
https://openalex.org/W1996133970,"The role of collagen I for midgestation development was studied in homozygous Mov 13 embryos, which cannot synthesize alpha 1(1) mRNA as a result of insertional mutagenesis and most of which die between day 12 and 14 of gestation. No type I collagen was detected in mutant embryos, while the distribution of other collagens, laminin, and fibronectin was not affected. Mutant embryos develop normally up to day 12 of gestation, suggesting that collagen I has no essential role in the early phase of morphogenesis. The first pathological events were detected in hemopoietic cells of the liver, followed by necroses of mesenchymal cells in other parts of the embryo. The sudden death is caused by the rupture of a major blood vessel, indicating an important role for collagen I in establishing the mechanical stability of the circulatory system. Our results furthermore suggest that complex cell interactions in embryonic development such as those in early hemopoiesis may depend on the presence of collagen type I."
https://openalex.org/W2103012525,"I have identified a chromatin particle containing DNA as large as 20-40 kb that migrates as a discrete entity on agarose gels. With increasing nuclease digestion, the particle becomes cleaved in the linker regions between nucleosomes, but remains intact, probably held together by the outer histones, H1 and H5. By hybridization analysis, inactive genes are found in these particles. Active genes (and their flanking sequences) are also found in particles containing H1 and H5, but in contrast to inactive supranucleosome particles, active polynucleosome particles are not held together after cleavage of linker DNA. This suggests that H1 cross-links adjacent nucleosomes in inactive regions and that H1 is bound differently in expressed regions. The results raise the possibility that the marked degree of suppression of repressed, tissue-specific genes may be determined, in part, by their assembly into these inactive supranucleosome structures."
https://openalex.org/W2115312355,"Methotrexate-resistant Leishmania tropical contain two separate regions of DNA amplification, one encoding the bifunctional thymidylate synthetase-dihydrofolate reductase (TS-DHFR) characteristic of protozoans and the other of yet unknown function. The amplified DNAs are initially found as extrachromosomal closed circular forms, which are unstable in the absence of selection. After prolonged culture in methotrexate the amplified DNAs are found as repetitive arrays associated with the chromosomal DNA fraction after CsCl-ethidium bromide density gradient centrifugation, and are stable once selection is removed. The molecular description of gene amplification in Leishmania thus closely parallels the cytological features of gene amplification in cultured mammalian cells."

https://openalex.org/W1596027979,"The driving forces for taurocholate transport were determined in highly purified canalicular (cLPM) and basolateral rat liver plasma membrane (LPM) vesicles. Alanine transport was also examined for comparison. Inwardly directed Na+ but not K+ gradients transiently stimulated [3H]taurocholate (1 microM) and [3H]alanine (0.2 mM) uptake into basolateral LPM 3-4- fold above their respective equilibrium values (overshoots). Na+ also stimulated [3H]taurocholate countertransport and tracer exchange in basolateral LPM whereas valinomycin-induced inside negative K+ diffusion potentials stimulated alanine uptake but had no effect on taurocholate uptake. In contrast, in the right-side out oriented cLPM vesicles, [3H]taurocholate countertransport and tracer exchange were not dependent on Na+. Efflux of [3H]taurocholate from cLPM was also independent of Na+ and could be trans-stimulated by extra-vesicular taurocholate. Furthermore, an inside negative valinomycin-mediated K+ diffusion potential inhibited taurocholate uptake into and stimulated taurocholate efflux from the cLPM vesicles. These studies provide direct evidence for a carrier mediated and potential-sensitive conductive pathway for the canalicular excretion of taurocholate. In addition, they confirm the presence of a possibly electroneutral Na+-taurocholate cotransport system in basolateral membranes of the hepatocyte."
https://openalex.org/W2072808743,"We have analyzed staged human placentas by Northern, dot blot, and in situ hybridization to human c-myc probes. Placental RNA exhibits a stage-specific appearance of a 2.4 kb transcript of the c-myc gene. The frequency of this transcript varies 20 to 30 fold over the course of placental development, showing a peak at 4-5 weeks after conception, where the myc transcripts comprise about 0.05% by weight of the total placental mRNA. A clear decline in placental c-myc transcription is seen before the end of the first trimester of pregnancy. In situ hybridization to 125I-labeled myc probes demonstrates an unequal spatial distribution of myc transcripts in placental with particularly high expression in the cytotrophoblastic shell of early placenta. Labeling of placental explants with 3H-thymidine, the localization of myc transcripts to cytotrophoblasts, and the temporal pattern of myc expression all support a strong correlation between myc transcript abundance and cytotrophoblast proliferation. We argue for a role for the c-myc gene in the proliferation of normal cells in this tissue."

https://openalex.org/W1582772138,"Four hexapeptides of sequence L-Val-L-Tyr-L-Pro-(Asp)-Gly-L-Ala containing D- or L-aspartyl residues in normal or isopeptide linkages have been synthesized by the Merrifield solid-phase method as potential substrates of the erythrocyte protein carboxyl methyltransferase. This enzyme has been shown to catalyze the methylation of D-aspartyl residues in proteins in red blood cell membranes and cytosol. Using a new vapor-phase methanol diffusion assay, we have found that the normal hexapeptides containing either D- or L-aspartyl residues were not substrates for the human erythrocyte methyltransferase. On the other hand, the L-aspartyl isopeptide, in which the glycyl residue was linked in a peptide bond to the beta-carboxyl group of the aspartyl residue, was a substrate for the enzyme with a Km of 6.3 microM and was methylated with a maximal velocity equal to that observed when ovalbumin was used as a methyl acceptor. The enzyme catalyzed the transfer of up to 0.8 mol of methyl groups/mol of this peptide. Of the four synthetic peptides, only the L-isohexapeptide competitively inhibits the methylation of ovalbumin by the erythrocyte enzyme. This peptide also acts as a substrate for both of the purified protein carboxyl methyltransferases I and II which have been previously isolated from bovine brain (Aswad, D. W., and Deight, E. A. (1983) J. Neurochem. 40, 1718-1726). The L-isoaspartyl hexapeptide represents the first defined synthetic substrate for a eucaryotic protein carboxyl methyltransferase. These results demonstrate that these enzymes can not only catalyze the formation of methyl esters at the beta-carboxyl groups of D-aspartyl residues but can also form esters at the alpha-carboxyl groups of isomerized L-aspartyl residues. The implications of these findings for the metabolism of modified proteins are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1503916414,"A model describing the nucleation and assembly of purified tubulin has been developed. The novel feature of this model is a two stage nucleation process to allow the explicit inclusion of the two-dimensional nature of the early stages of microtubule assembly. In actin assembly the small starting nucleus has only one site for subunit addition as the two-stranded helix is formed. In contrast, microtubule assembly begins with the formation of a small two-dimensional section of microtubule wall. The model we propose is a modification of the work of Wegner and Engel (Wegner, A., and Engel, J. (1975) Biophys. Chem. 3, 215-225) wherein we add a second stage of nucleation to directly account for lateral growth, i.e. the addition of a small number of subunits to the side of an existing sheet structure. Subsequent elongation of the sheets is treated in the usual way. The experimental system used to test this model was the Mg2+/glycerol induced assembly of purified tubulin. The computer simulation of the polymerization time courses gave a fairly good fit to experimental kinetics for our model, where the primary nucleus comprises two protofilaments, of four and three subunits, and lateral growth requires a three-subunit nucleus to initiate a new protofilament."
https://openalex.org/W1567157730,"The metabolism of endogenously labeled proteoglycans was studied in rat ovarian granulosa cell cultures by a series of pulse-chase experiments using [35S]sulfate as a precursor. More than 90% of the newly synthesized proteoglycans are transported to the cell surface (trypsin-accessible compartment) with a median transit time of 13 min. The membrane-bound heparan sulfate-proteoglycan (HS-PG) is lost from the cell surface either by release into the medium (30%, with t1/2 of 4 h) or by internalization (70%, with t1/2 of 4 h). Internalized HS-PG, which does not recycle to the cell surface, is degraded by two major pathways. In pathway 1, 60% of the internalized HS-PG migrates to lysosomes with a relatively short t1/2 of 30 min, where it is rapidly degraded, releasing free [35S]sulfate without detectable intermediate products. Chloroquine treatment inhibited degradation, resulting in the accumulation of intact proteoglycans inside the cell. In pathway 2, 40% of the internalized HS-PG is first subjected to extensive proteolysis and limited endoglycosidic degradation yielding single HS chains about 1/3 of their original size (t1/2 of 30 min). Chloroquine did not inhibit this step. The partially degraded HS is then degraded further by limited endoglycosidic activity to about 1/4-1/5 the original size (t1/2 of 30-60 min). This step is inhibited by chloroquine. These smaller fragments have a relatively long t1/2 of 3-4 h before rapid degradation in the lysosomes, releasing free [35S]sulfate. Approximately 7% of the newly synthesized HS-PG that is not transported to the cell surface is degraded directly by pathway 2. The larger dermatan sulfate proteoglycan (DS-I) is transported to the cell surface from which it is quantitatively released into the medium with a t1/2 of 4-6 h. The smaller DS-PG (DS-II) is metabolized similarly to the HS-PG. Most (greater than 90%) is transported to the cell surface from which it is lost either by release into the medium (40%) or by internalization (60%). About 60% of the internalized DS-II is degraded by pathway 1 (t1/2 of 30 min), while the remainder appears to be degraded by pathway 2 with an overall t1/2 of 4 h. However, in contrast to the degradation of HS-PG by pathway 2, no endoglycosidic degradation of the DS chains occurred."
https://openalex.org/W1589579904,"Rat ovarian granulosa cells were isolated from immature female rats after stimulation with pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin and maintained in culture. Proteoglycans were labeled with [35S]sulfate, [3H]glucosamine, or [3H]serine as precursors. Proteoglycans associated with the cell layer were extracted with 4 M guanidine HCl buffer containing 2% Triton X-100. Labeled proteoglycans were isolated using sequential DEAE-Sephacel and Sepharose CL-4B chromatography under dissociative conditions in the presence of detergent. The cell layer contained three different hydrodynamic size species of dermatan sulfate proteoglycans, DS-Ic, DS-IIc, and DS-IIIc, and two different hydrodynamic size species of heparan sulfate proteoglycans, HS-Ic and HS-IIc, when analyzed on Sepharose CL-4B, DS-Ic, DS-IIc, and HS-Ic were indistinguishable from corresponding species in the medium fraction in terms of (a) hydrodynamic size analyzed on Sepharose CL-2B or Sepharose CL-4B, (b) buoyant density distribution in dissociative CsCl gradients, and (c) glycosaminoglycan and oligosaccharide compositions. The majority of these three proteoglycan species could be removed by brief trypsin treatment indicating their cell surface localization. Heparin released a part of the trypsin-removable proteoglycan population, which mostly consisted of DS-Ic with smaller amounts of DS-IIc and HS-Ic. Cell layer extracted with 4 M guanidine HCl without detergent contained a large hydrodynamic size structure excluded from Sepharose CL-2B, which contained DS-IIc and HS-Ic proteoglycans with large amounts of exogenous proteins. Proteoglycans were dissociated from this supramolecular structure in the presence of high concentrations of detergents (2% sodium dodecyl sulfate or Triton X-100), indicating the hydrophobic nature of this structure, probably a part of the plasma membrane, and suggesting that DS-IIc and HS-Ic are intercalated into membrane. Both DS-IIIc and HS-IIc were intracellular species, which were not released into the medium by the living cells or removed by either trypsin or heparin. DS-IIIc species was a single glycosaminoglycan chain having the same hydrodynamic size and sulfation pattern as those of glycosaminoglycan chains on DS-II. HS-IIc species was also a single glycosaminoglycan chain with an average molecular size only 1/3-1/4 that of chains on HS-I but heparan sulfate chains from both species showed a similar average sulfation pattern when analyzed by nitrous acid fragmentation. Both DS-IIIc and HS-IIc had small amounts of covalently attached peptides."
https://openalex.org/W2060831891,"Cochlear microphonic iso-response functions reported here suggest an explanation of frequency-dependent changes in hearing sensitivity during early development. The work is a direct demonstration of developmental changes in the spatial frequency map of the mammalian hearing organ. Intracochlear recordings from the midbasal turn in a series of age-graded gerbils reveal a progressive increase in best frequency, spanning approximately two octaves, from the time of onset of function until adultlike responses are seen. It is, therefore, suggested that ontogenetic changes in the cellular structure of the organ of Corti contribute to an age-dependent shift in micromechanical response."

https://openalex.org/W1599961267,"Mitochondria isolated from rapidly growing, poorly differentiated Morris hepatoma 3924A have been found to export the citrate they generate from pyruvate, at a rate greater than four times that of control liver preparations. These 3924A mitochondria fail to exhibit state 3 respiration when either pyruvate or citrate are supplied as respiratory fuels. Nevertheless, substrates that join the Krebs cycle beyond citrate (viz. isocitrate, glutamate, alpha-ketoglutarate, and succinate) are readily oxidized by tumor 3924A mitochondria. Blocking the tricarboxylate anion exchange carrier with the citrate transport inhibitor 1,2,3-benzenetricarboxylate restores the ability of tumor 3924A mitochondria to respire with pyruvate or citrate. Slowly growing, minimally deviated Morris hepatoma 16 possesses mitochondria that do not display discernably altered respiratory patterns with pyruvate or citrate, but they do exhibit a 30% increase in the rate of citrate export relative to control liver preparations. Paralleling the preferential citrate export from tumor mitochondria is a dramatic enrichment of the tumor mitochondrial membranes with cholesterol. Hepatoma 3924A mitochondria possess a more than 5-fold enrichment in cholesterol, and those from tumor 16 display a 2-fold enrichment. When normal mitochondria, isolated from ACI strain rat liver, were enriched with cholesterol in vitro via a solid-state molecule transfer method employing Sephadex G-10 beads coated with cholesterol, they exhibited altered patterns of Krebs cycle metabolism that were qualitatively identical to those obtained with isolated Morris hepatoma mitochondria (which become enriched in membrane cholesterol endogenously during tumorigenesis). The enrichment of mitochondrial membranes with cholesterol, either by experimental manipulation in vitro or during the proliferation of the tumor in the host animal, promotes these metabolic changes directly, apparently by effecting a functional alteration in the operation of the tricarboxylate (citrate) exchange carrier of the inner mitochondrial membrane. These results highlight two related but incompletely understood phenomena as follows: 1) a functionally truncated Krebs cycle in cholesterol-rich tumor mitochondria, and 2) a mechanism for providing higher cytoplasmic levels of precursor metabolite intermediates which help sustain deregulated cholesterogenesis in hepatomas and other malignant neoplasms."
https://openalex.org/W2004250443,"When isolated apical membrane vesicles prepared from cultured A6 epithelia were incubated in vitro with the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine, the control rate of amiloride-inhibitable sodium transport was doubled. The methylation inhibitors 3-deazaadenosine and S-adenosyl homocysteine returned the S-adenosyl-methionine-stimulated sodium transport to control levels. Neither these agents nor adenosine affected sodium transport into control vesicles. In vesicles incubated with S-adenosyl-[3H-methyl]methionine, both membrane phospholipids and proteins were labeled, and this labeling was inhibited by deazaadenosine. In vesicles prepared from A6 cells treated with aldosterone, sodium transport was twice the control value and S-adenosylmethionine did not cause any further stimulation of transport. In those vesicles, both lipid and protein methylation were increased. These results suggest that methylation, which increases the rate of amiloride-sensitive sodium transport is involved in the action of aldosterone at the apical membrane level in epithelia."
https://openalex.org/W1559584802,"The N-asparagine-linked oligosaccharide chains of homogeneous human placental beta-glucocerebrosidase were released by hydrazinolysis, and their structures were analyzed. The sequence of sugars, linkage, and anomeric configuration of the glycosidic bonds were determined. Approximately 20% of the released sugar chain was of the typical high mannose type. The balance was of complex type with biantennary and triantennary structures. As a major component, the following trisialylated oligosaccharide was detected: (formula; see text)."
https://openalex.org/W1498027545,"The effects of estradiol and antiestrogens on two estrogen-regulated proteins (52 and 160 kDa) and an estrogen-inducible mRNA (pS2) have been measured in the MCF7 human breast cancer cell line and two tamoxifen-resistant sublines. In MCF7 cells, tamoxifen (or nafoxidine) alone does not significantly affect pS2 mRNA levels nor transcription of the pS2 gene but completely antagonizes the ability of estradiol to increase pS2 RNA levels. The estrogen-mediated increase in pS2 mRNA levels resembles that of two estrogen-regulated proteins (52 and 160 kDa) that are released from MCF7 cells into the culture medium. This is distinct from the estrogen-mediated increase in progesterone receptor which is also obtained by tamoxifen treatment. In the two tamoxifen-resistant sublines (R27 and RTx6), tamoxifen does not increase pS2 mRNA levels or 160-kDa protein production but increases the production of the 52-kDa protein. These results show that in these tamoxifen-resistant cells, tamoxifen has become fully estrogenic for one, but not all estrogen-regulated responses."
https://openalex.org/W2007932566,We have mimicked the phenomena of nucleolar dominance by injecting cloned ribosomal genes from X. laevis and X. borealis into oocytes from either species and into embryos. The results of these experiments suggest that the dominance of the laevis ribosomal genes in hybrid embryos is primarily due to the fact that the laevis spacer has more copies of an enhancer element for the ribosomal gene promoter than does the borealis spacer. A contributing effect is that the laevis promoter functions well with transcription machinery from either species while the borealis promoter interacts poorly with laevis transcription machinery.

https://openalex.org/W1486817666,"A protein inhibitor to ornithine decarboxylase, antizyme, was purified to homogeneity, as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, about 600,000-fold with a 15% yield from the liver cytosol of putrescine-treated rats. Antizyme was very labile but markedly stabilized in the presence of Tween 80 and 2-mercaptoethanol. The apparent molecular weight of antizyme was determined to be 22,000 by gel filtration on Sephadex G-75 and 19,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, indicating that antizyme may be composed of a single polypeptide chain. The isoelectric point of antizyme was found to be 6.8. The equilibrium constant of the reaction between antizyme and ornithine decarboxylase was estimated to be as high as 1.4 X 10(11) M-1. Some other properties of antizyme were also described."
https://openalex.org/W1537343175,"Thermophilic and thermostable DNA ligase was purified to near homogeneity from the extract of Thermus thermophilus HB8. The purified enzyme has an isoelectric point at pH 6.6 and consists of a single polypeptide of about 79,000 in molecular weight on the bases of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis data and an equilibrium sedimentation method. The enzyme requires divalent cations, Mg2+ or Mn2+, and the optimum concentration of these ions being 5-9 X 10(-3) M and 3-6 X 10(-3) M, respectively. The enzyme also requires NAD as a cofactor. The apparent Km for NAD is 1.85 X 10(-8) M and that of (dT)10 is 1.4 X 10(-4) M. The pH optimum is 7.4-7.6 in Tris-HCl and 8.0 in collidine/HCl buffer. The joining reaction is activated by K+ and NH+4 at a concentration of 2-100 mM and inhibited by Na+ above 25 mM. The optimum temperatures of the joining of thymidylate oligomers in the presence of poly(dA) as a template are 27.5 degrees C for p(dT)s, 34.5 degrees C for p(dT)10, and 37 degrees C for p(dT)12-18 and that of cohesive-end DNA restriction fragments is 24-37 degrees C. The nick-closing activity of the enzyme was observed over a wide range of the temperature from 15 to 85 degrees C and the optimum temperature is 65-72 degrees C. The temperature dependency of ligation with HB8 DNA ligase for various substrates was found to shift to a region of 7-10 degrees C higher than that of T4 DNA ligase and the activity of HB8 DNA ligase decreased remarkably below 4 degrees C. The enzyme was stable for 1 week at 37 degrees C, its activity dropped by 50% within 2 days at 65 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W1538188566,"Glycine is converted to carbon dioxide and an intermediate attached to H-protein in the P-protein-catalyzed partial reaction of the glycine cleavage reaction (Fujiwara, K., and Motokawa, Y. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 8156-8162). The studies presented in this communication indicate that the amino group of glycine is retained in the intermediate and released as ammonia in the second partial reaction catalyzed by T-protein. The formation of ammonia accompanies the stoichiometric formation of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate from the methylene carbon of glycine and tetrahydrofolate. Kinetic studies show that the reaction proceeds through a sequential mechanism. Km values for the intermediate complex and tetrahydrofolate are 2.2 and 50 microM, respectively. In the absence of tetrahydrofolate, T-protein catalyzes the stoichiometric formation of ammonia and formaldehyde from the intermediate although the velocity is extremely low. Km value for the intermediate complex in the absence of tetrahydrofolate is 10.3 microM, about 4-fold higher than the value in the presence of tetrahydrofolate. The addition of tetrahydrofolate increased the rate about 2400-fold. The modification of the free lipoyl sulfhydryl group with N-ethylmaleimide caused the intermediate complex inactive. The lipoyl sulfhydryl group seems to be essential for both P-protein- and T-protein-catalyzed partial reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1550642408,"In the basic life sciences the term implies a physical, chemical, or molecular construct that provides a representation for the interpretation of experimental observations. To the statistician, however, a model is a mathematical expression for correlating data, which may or may not have roots in a molecular picture. With regard to ligand-receptor interactions, the mathematical model used plays a crucial role in extrapolations of binding measurements. Regardless of the statistical goodness of fit of data to an equation, the relationships of the parameters of a mathematical formalism to the molecular features of ligand-receptor complexes are generally very complex. Oversimplified interpretations of the molecular significance of the constants derived from binding measurements are unwarranted, unless one has independent information from molecular probes."
https://openalex.org/W1596346915,"Isolated hepatocytes from rat liver were incubated with [3H]mevalonate, and the labeling of polyprenols in the microsomal fraction was followed. After a 1-min incubation the alpha-unsaturated forms of polyprenyl-P2, -P, and polyprenol were mainly labeled and at this time point only 2, 8, and 17%, respectively, of the label was associated with the saturated forms. In the case of the free alcohol 2 h of incubation was required before all the labeling was recovered in the saturated form. After 1 min polyprenols and polyprenyl-P with 20 and 21 isoprene residues demonstrated much higher specific labeling than the shorter compounds, but after 5 min these differences were greatly reduced. In experiments utilizing short incubation times and chasing no evidence has been obtained that the phosphorylated form is a precursor of the free alcohol or vice versa, that the free alcohol is a precursor of the phosphorylated form. In human liver about 1% of the dolichol is present in the alpha-unsaturated form. These experiments suggest that: 1) the alpha-unsaturated form is the precursor of the alpha-saturated free alcohol, 2) dolichol does not necessarily arise directly from dephosphorylation of the phosphorylated form, and 3) the free alcohol is for the most part not phosphorylated under in vivo conditions in rat liver."
https://openalex.org/W1525007860,"The ability of HeLa DNA polymerase alpha to utilize gapped PM2 DNAs for synthesis in a model base excision DNA repair scheme was examined. Partially depurinated PM2 DNA was incised on the 5' side of apurinic sites with HeLa apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease II, then the baseless sugar was removed and gaps of defined mean lengths were introduced at these sites by exonucleolytic digestion with HeLa DNase V. Gaps smaller than approximately 15 nucleotides did not serve as efficient primer-templates for DNA polymerase alpha. Gaps with mean lengths of 20-63 nucleotides did support limited DNA synthesis, but such synthesis terminated after the gap was reduced to roughly 15 nucleotides. These products were not substrates for Escherichia coli DNA ligase. In contrast, HeLa DNA polymerase beta utilize as primer-templates all of the gapped DNA substrates tested though it acted more efficiently with the smaller gaps. Moreover, the beta-polymerase was capable of filling these gaps to completion. In the case of the gaps that remained after partial closure by DNA polymerase alpha, DNA polymerase beta incorporated roughly 15 nucleotides and formed a product which was a substrate for DNA ligase. These results suggest that in vivo DNA repair pathways that involve a gap-filling DNA synthesis reaction might utilize DNA polymerase alpha only for larger gaps."

At the external ear, large interaural intensity differences are generated only when a sound originates within a limited area of two-dimensional space, and this area is different for each pulse harmonic. As a consequence, the external ear generates pronounced binaural spectral cues containing two-dimensional spatial information. This information is encoded in the inferior colliculus by neurons tuned to one of the harmonics and sensitive to interaural intensity differences."
https://openalex.org/W1584311881,"Two species of troponin T have been purified by ion-exchange chromatography from erector spinae, the major fast white muscle of the rabbit back, and from a pool of the fast hindlimb muscles gastrocnemius and plantaris. Designated Tn-T1f and Tn-T2f, they can be resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with apparent molecular weights of 37,500 and 37,000 respectively. Their amino acid compositions are similar and correlate well with that reported for troponin T from fast muscle (Pearlstone, J. R., Carpenter, M. R., and Smillie, L. B. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 971-977). Tn-T2f most likely corresponds to the previously studied troponin T; further characterization was undertaken to determine how the newly identified Tn-T1f differs from Tn-T2f. Phosphorylation of alkaline phosphatase-treated troponin demonstrated that Tn-T1f and Tn-T2f are not interconverted by a change in phosphorylation state. Comparison of the CNBr fragments of Tn-T1f and Tn-T2f by SDS-gel electrophoresis and reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography revealed similar but not identical peptide patterns. The major difference occurs in the amino-terminal CNBr peptides corresponding to CB3. Since both Tn-T1f and Tn-T2f have blocked amino termini, the difference does not result from proteolysis at the amino terminus of one of the proteins. These observations indicate that the two species of troponin T do not result from a known post-translational modification, but rather from differences in the amino acid sequence, suggesting that they arise either from the expression of different genes or a single gene from which different mRNAs are transcribed."
https://openalex.org/W1523996460,"An alanine carrier protein was isolated from membranes of the thermophilic bacterium PS3 using ion exchange column chromatography followed by high performance liquid chromatography with a hydroxylapatite column. The final preparation consisted of a single polypeptide, with Mr = 42,500, as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A polarity index of 33% was calculated from the amino acid analysis. Proteoliposomes reconstituted with the purified alanine carrier carried out an active alanine transport driven by either an electrochemical potential difference of protons or that of sodium ions."
https://openalex.org/W2028434177,"Development and fertility in the mouse are known to be influenced by loci mapped to the T/t complex of chromosome 17. Recent evidence suggests that one or more genes near this region may also be associated with sex determination. Washburn and Eicher recently reported partial to complete sex reversal with the Thp deletion on some genetic backgrounds and suggest that this result may be due to a primary sex-determining locus (Tas) that is closely linked to, or a part of, the T locus. Sex-specific, Bkm (banded Krait minor satellite DNA)-related sequences are known to have autosomal as well as heterogametic sex chromosomal copies, but specific regions of autosomal localization have not been described. We now demonstrate the presence of chromosome Y-related DNA sequences on proximal chromosome 17 in Sex-reversed (Sxr) and normal mice using in situ hybridization of mitotic chromosomes with 3H-labelled pCS316 (ref. 4), a probe that shows major hybridization to the proximal portion of the mouse chromosome Y. These data, and those of Washburn and Eicher, argue for a gene(s) related to sex determination or differentiation within the proximal portion of mouse chromosome 17."
https://openalex.org/W1517414895,"BamHI methylase has been purified to apparent homogeneity. The isolated form of the enzyme is a single polypeptide with a molecular weight of 56,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis. Unlike BamHI endonuclease, which is isolated as a dimer and higher aggregates, the methylase has no apparent higher form. The methylase requires S-adenosyl-L-methionine as the methyl-group donor and is inhibited by Mg2+. The enzyme is also inhibited by 2,3-butanedione and reagents specific for sulfhydryl groups, such as N-ethylmaleimide, which suggests a role for arginine and cysteine residues, respectively. DNA efficiently protects the enzyme against the butanedione modification while S-adenosylmethionine has no effect. In contrast, S-adenosylmethionine protects against cysteine modification while DNA produces only small amounts of protection. Studies on the mechanism of methylation indicate that both strands of the recognition sequence are modified in a single binding event. The sequence specificity of the methylase is relaxed upon the addition of glycerol in the reaction mixture. In the presence of 30% glycerol the enzyme methylates sequences that are also recognized by BamHI endonuclease when acting under conditions of relaxed specificity."

https://openalex.org/W1584803905,"The monoclinic crystalline form of aldolase from rabbit skeletal muscle grown at 29 degrees C is catalytically active in the direction of aldol cleavage. Activity was assayed for in a crystallization buffer containing 45% saturated ammonium sulfate using chemically unmodified single crystals cut to precise dimensions. Diffusion effects velocities from assays employing aldolase crystals do not appear to be limiting when cut single crystals are crushed. Assays of crushed crystals are linear with respect to both time and enzyme concentration. Kinetic constants are reported for both substrates fructose 1-phosphate and fructose 1,6-phosphate. Maximal velocities and binding constants determined differ by no more than a factor of 2 between the crystalline and the soluble state of the enzyme. Analysis of the kinetic constants for fructose 1-phosphate as substrate shows that binding of substrate does not change in going to the crystalline state. Release of product is reduced roughly 2-fold in the crystalline state. A similar conclusion can be reached in the case of fructose 1,6-phosphate as substrate provided the on steps of substrate and product are only diffusion limited but independent of the physical state of the enzyme. It is not possible to distinguish between a more sluggish conformational change during catalysis or simply tighter product binding in the crystalline state as compared to the soluble enzyme state."
https://openalex.org/W1595139970,"The binding of cadmium to skeletal troponin C (STnC) has been measured by equilibrium binding and by 113Cd NMR spectroscopy. The equilibrium binding experiments have shown that there are two cadmium binding sites on STnC with a high affinity for Cd2+ (KCd congruent to 10(7) M-1) and two with a lower affinity for Cd2+ (KCd congruent to 10(3) M-1). The former binding constant is comparable to Ca2+ binding to the Ca2+-Mg2+ (structural) sites of STnC and the latter is about a factor of one hundred less than Ca2+ binding to the Ca2+-specific (regulatory) sites of STnC. In the presence of Mg2+ the affinity of Cd2+ for the higher affinity sites was lowered, yielding a KMg of approximately 10(3) M-1. These data clearly suggest that the two sites with high affinity for Cd2+ are the same as the Ca2+-Mg2+ sites (Zot, H., and Potter, J. D. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 7678-7683). The 113Cd NMR is shown to be temperature-dependent. The room temperature spectrum consists of two resonances at -107.8 and -112.7 ppm with respect to a 0.1 M solution of Cd(ClO4)2. Lowering the temperature to 4 degrees C alters the cadmium exchange dynamics, and results in a four line 113Cd spectrum. The two new resonances at -103.1 and -109.8 ppm probably arise from cadmium binding to the Ca2+-specific (regulatory) sites on STnC; whereas, the resonances at -107.8 and -112.7 ppm correspond to cadmium binding at the Ca2+-Mg2+ (structural) sites, respectively. When the 113Cd2+-substituted protein was titrated with Ca2+, the two resonances corresponding to the high affinity sites were reduced in intensity, followed by a reduction in intensity of the lower affinity Cd2+ sites. Based on the assignments made here and the known binding constants of STnC for Ca2+ (Potter, J. D., and Gergely, J. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 4628-4633) and the Cd2+ affinities reported here, one would not predict these results. Ca2+ should have first bound to the sites with the lower affinity Cd2+. Since the direct binding experiments clearly demonstrate that the high affinity Cd2+ sites are the Ca2+-Mg2+ sites, we can only conclude that Cd2+ binding to the protein (probably to the lower affinity Ca2+-specific sites) dramatically alters the affinity of the Ca2+-Mg2+ sites for Ca2+. It is suggested that an allosteric coupling network exists between all classes of binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1486551516,"Using 31P NMR and a potassium ion distribution method, the internal phosphorylation potential and the transmembrane electrical potential of intact rat liver mitochondria were measured simultaneously during ATP synthesis and ATP hydrolysis. The ATPase was shown to quickly equilibrate the internal phosphorylation potential with the proton motive force across the mitochondrial membrane. Upon oxygenation of anaerobic mitochondria, there was a very fast increase of delta pH and a quick uptake of inorganic phosphate prior to the buildup of the internal ATP. Consistent with the chemiosmotic theory, these results showed the presence of proton pumping by the respiratory system from the bulk internal aqueous phase to the bulk external aqueous phase. There was, in the measured energetic parameters, no indication of direct energy coupling or short circuiting protons between the respiratory energy input and the ATP synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1642252235,"In vitro translation of the mRNA from the congenital goiter tissue of Afrikander cattle directs the synthesis of two (Mr congruent to 250,000 and congruent to 75,000, respectively) abnormal thyroglobulin-like polypeptides. Common features of these polypeptides are the following: 1) both are immunoprecipitated by purified, anti-thyroglobulin antibody; 2) the signal sequence is present on their nascent polypeptide chains, and 3) their synthesis is apparently directed by the same high molecular weight mRNA. However, the goiter thyroglobulin mRNA shows, by Northern blot analysis, a slightly reduced size (congruent to 30 S) as compared to the mRNA from normal, bovine, thyroid tissue (33 S). Furthermore, a 10- to 15-fold decrease (as assessed by dot blot hybridization) in relative mRNA concentration was observed. Thus, it can be concluded that the genetic defect in congenital goiter of Afrikander cattle results in the synthesis of an altered mRNA which is present in decreased amount and directs the synthesis of two abnormal thyroglobulin-like polypeptides."
https://openalex.org/W2275479312,"The murine mutation CatFraser causes a cataract in both the mutant heterozygote (C/+) and mutant homozygote (C/C). Our previous electrophoretic studies detected, in the lenses of both mutant genotypes, several proteins which did not appear to be present in normal lenses. Here we show, using more sensitive methods, that traces of these proteins previously characterized as abnormal are in fact present in normal lenses. Furthermore, these proteins have a primary structure very similar to that of the alpha-crystallins. We conclude that the mutation accelerates the degradation of alpha-crystallin, which in the normal lens proceeds at a very slow rate."
https://openalex.org/W201251562,"Abstract Protein methylesterase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes protein methyl esters, has been purified. The purification procedure includes ammonium sulfate and acid precipitations, and chromatographies on Sephadex G-100, Polybuffer exchanger 94, and matrex gel Green A. With this procedure, protein methylesterase was purified 1190-fold with a 28% recovery in activity. Its molecular weight has been estimated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions and by molecular sieving under native conditions at 31,000. Protein methylesterase has an optimum pH of 4.0 and an isoelectric point of 4.45. The enzyme is stable over a wide range of pH (2-10). The Km for ovalbumin methyl esters was estimated at 5.9 microM. Monovalent ions had little effect on activity while divalent ions at concentrations above 50 mM inhibited protein methylesterase activity in a concentration-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W204315537,"The hypothesis of a preferential biosynthesis of a major phenobarbital inducible form of hepatic cytochrome P-450 (P-450b) in mitochondria-associated rough endoplasmic reticulum (RERmito) was tested by measuring incorporation rates of [35S]methionine and delta-amino[3H]levulinate into the hemoprotein in adult rats. RERmito, rough microsomes (RM representing RER not associated with mitochondria) and smooth microsomes (SM) were quantitatively isolated from the same homogenate by rate zonal centrifugation and their content of P-450b determined by rocket immunoelectrophoresis. P-450b was isolated by immunoprecipitation from detergent-solubilized membrane fractions. The time course and rate of incorporation of [35S] methionine into immunoprecipitable P-450b of RERmito and of RM were similar at all time points studied (2-15 min) both under conditions of maximal induction (4 injections of phenobarbital in 4 days) and after a single injection of phenobarbital. The incorporation of [35S]methionine into P-450b of SM was slower at early time points (2-8 min) but similar to RERmito and RM after 15 min. In contrast, at short labeling periods (less than 8 min) more delta-amino[3H]levulinate was incorporated into P-450b of RERmito than into P-450b of RM and SM. No significant accumulation of free apocytochrome P-450b was found in either membrane fraction. These data indicate a close coordination of the biosynthesis and assembly of apocytochrome P-450b and its prosthetic heme but do not support the hypothesis of a major functional role of MITO X RER complexes in the synthesis of microsomal cytochrome P-450b."
https://openalex.org/W1539919573,"We report natural abundance carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance studies of myosin, subfragment 1 (S-1), and myosin rod in solution and of myosin filaments. We measured solution spectra at 37.7 MHz, 20 degrees C with scalar proton decoupling. If the native proteins were rigid particles, only S-1 would have observable intensity. In fact, 30% of myosin, 70% of S-1, and 30% of rod carbons are observable. Observable carbons possess rotational correlation times less than 10(-7) s which effectively average 13C-1H dipolar coupling and anisotropic chemical shift interactions. Short alpha-carbon region spin-lattice relaxation times (T1) and nonminimal 13C-1H nuclear Overhauser enhancements suggest restricted nanosecond motions of backbone atoms. This is direct evidence for internal motion of backbone and side-chain carbons in myosin and its fragments. Double resonance experiments at 15.1 MHz and 5 degrees C with pelleted myosin filaments detected carbon atoms in rigid domains. While most (80%) aliphatic carbons are strongly 13C-1H dipolar coupled due to limited motion, they have short T1 values and large nuclear Overhauser enhancement values; this is evidence for high frequency restricted motion. Cross-polarization experiments show that the 13C carbonyl line width is motionally narrowed, suggesting broad backbone motions in the 100 mus range. Thus, motion in filaments is highly anisotropic."
https://openalex.org/W8541625,"The substrates hexobarbital and ethylbenzene have been shown to compete for the spectral binding site of phenobarbital-induced rat hepatic microsomal cytochrome p-450. The two substrates produce different delta Absmax values, and the presence of one substrate does not affect the delta Absmax of the other substrate and vice versa. The respective binding constants for the two substrates are similarly unaffected. The conclusion drawn from these observations is that, over the concentration ranges studied, there is no change in the availability of the enzyme as a result of substrate addition; the difference in delta Absmax apparently being due to varying abilities of different substrates to bring about a spin shift in the enzyme. Evidence is presented to indicate that differences between enzymes from untreated male rats and phenobarbital-treated male rats are attributable to differences in the enzyme itself and not to changes in the nature of the membrane brought about by phenobarbital administration, at least insofar as heat entropy compensation is concerned. The enthalpy-entropy compensation observed in the binding of a homologous series of barbiturates to the microsomal membrane as determined from the membrane concentration dependence of their binding constants is shown to agree surprisingly well with the direct determination performed by Sitar and Mannering."
https://openalex.org/W1590795004,"Abstract Free Ca2+ was shown to inhibit the NAD+-isocitrate dehydrogenase from blowfly flight muscle mitochondria. Inhibition by free Ca2+ concentrations of 40 microM or greater was found in the absence or presence of ADP and citrate, two known activators of the enzyme. Calcium decreased the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate, the magnesium DL-isocitrate chelate; no change in the apparent V of the reaction was observed. Calcium was inhibitory when activity was measured in the presence of fixed concentrations of magnesium DL-isocitrate chelate in the presence of several fixed concentrations of either free isocitrate3-, an activator, or free Mg2+, an inhibitor of the enzyme. That NAD+-isocitrate dehydrogenase from blowfly flight muscle mitochondria was not activated by micromolar free Ca2+ is consistent with the view that calcium does not play a role in regulating the flux through the tricarboxylate cycle in this species."

Animal studies, whenever possible, should be augmented by studies of mechanisms, metabolism, and pharmacodynamics. Such studies may assist in assessing risk to man. Recognizing the utility of such data should point the way for better assessment in the future."
