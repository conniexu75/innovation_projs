https://openalex.org/W2056302937,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are increasingly implicated in regulating the malignant progression of cancer. Here we show that miR-9, which is upregulated in breast cancer cells, directly targets CDH1, the E-cadherin-encoding messenger RNA, leading to increased cell motility and invasiveness. miR-9-mediated E-cadherin downregulation results in the activation of beta-catenin signalling, which contributes to upregulated expression of the gene encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); this leads, in turn, to increased tumour angiogenesis. Overexpression of miR-9 in otherwise non-metastatic breast tumour cells enables these cells to form pulmonary micrometastases in mice. Conversely, inhibiting miR-9 by using a 'miRNA sponge' in highly malignant cells inhibits metastasis formation. Expression of miR-9 is activated by MYC and MYCN, both of which directly bind to the mir-9-3 locus. Significantly, in human cancers, miR-9 levels correlate with MYCN amplification, tumour grade and metastatic status. These findings uncover a regulatory and signalling pathway involving a metastasis-promoting miRNA that is predicted to directly target expression of the key metastasis-suppressing protein E-cadherin."
https://openalex.org/W2105380935,"Neural responses are typically characterized by computing the mean firing rate, but response variability can exist across trials. Many studies have examined the effect of a stimulus on the mean response, but few have examined the effect on response variability. We measured neural variability in 13 extracellularly recorded datasets and one intracellularly recorded dataset from seven areas spanning the four cortical lobes in monkeys and cats. In every case, stimulus onset caused a decline in neural variability. This occurred even when the stimulus produced little change in mean firing rate. The variability decline was observed in membrane potential recordings, in the spiking of individual neurons and in correlated spiking variability measured with implanted 96-electrode arrays. The variability decline was observed for all stimuli tested, regardless of whether the animal was awake, behaving or anaesthetized. This widespread variability decline suggests a rather general property of cortex, that its state is stabilized by an input."
https://openalex.org/W2043355615,"Sequence polymorphisms in a 58-kilobase (kb) interval on chromosome 9p21 confer a markedly increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD), the leading cause of death worldwide. The variants have a substantial effect on the epidemiology of CAD and other life-threatening vascular conditions because nearly one-quarter of Caucasians are homozygous for risk alleles. However, the risk interval is devoid of protein-coding genes and the mechanism linking the region to CAD risk has remained enigmatic. Here we show that deletion of the orthologous 70-kb non-coding interval on mouse chromosome 4 affects cardiac expression of neighbouring genes, as well as proliferation properties of vascular cells. Chr4(Delta70kb/Delta70kb) mice are viable, but show increased mortality both during development and as adults. Cardiac expression of two genes near the non-coding interval, Cdkn2a and Cdkn2b, is severely reduced in chr4(Delta70kb/Delta70kb) mice, indicating that distant-acting gene regulatory functions are located in the non-coding CAD risk interval. Allele-specific expression of Cdkn2b transcripts in heterozygous mice showed that the deletion affects expression through a cis-acting mechanism. Primary cultures of chr4(Delta70kb/Delta70kb) aortic smooth muscle cells exhibited excessive proliferation and diminished senescence, a cellular phenotype consistent with accelerated CAD pathogenesis. Taken together, our results provide direct evidence that the CAD risk interval has a pivotal role in regulation of cardiac Cdkn2a/b expression, and suggest that this region affects CAD progression by altering the dynamics of vascular cell proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W2058647415,"Cellular senescence irreversibly arrests cell proliferation in response to oncogenic stimuli. Human cells develop a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which increases the secretion of cytokines and other factors that alter the behavior of neighboring cells. We show here that “senescent” mouse fibroblasts, which arrested growth after repeated passage under standard culture conditions (20% oxygen), do not express a human-like SASP, and differ from similarly cultured human cells in other respects. However, when cultured in physiological (3%) oxygen and induced to senesce by radiation, mouse cells more closely resemble human cells, including expression of a robust SASP. We describe two new aspects of the human and mouse SASPs. First, cells from both species upregulated the expression and secretion of several matrix metalloproteinases, which comprise a conserved genomic cluster. Second, for both species, the ability to promote the growth of premalignant epithelial cells was due primarily to the conserved SASP factor CXCL-1/KC/GRO-α. Further, mouse fibroblasts made senescent in 3%, but not 20%, oxygen promoted epithelial tumorigenesis in mouse xenographs. Our findings underscore critical mouse-human differences in oxygen sensitivity, identify conditions to use mouse cells to model human cellular senescence, and reveal novel conserved features of the SASP."
https://openalex.org/W2036755369,"The IGF/mTOR pathway, which is modulated by nutrients, growth factors, energy status and cellular stress regulates aging in various organisms. SIRT1 is a NAD+ dependent deacetylase that is known to regulate caloric restriction mediated longevity in model organisms, and has also been linked to the insulin/IGF signaling pathway. Here we investigated the potential regulation of mTOR signaling by SIRT1 in response to nutrients and cellular stress. We demonstrate that SIRT1 deficiency results in elevated mTOR signaling, which is not abolished by stress conditions. The SIRT1 activator resveratrol reduces, whereas SIRT1 inhibitor nicotinamide enhances mTOR activity in a SIRT1 dependent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SIRT1 interacts with TSC2, a component of the mTOR inhibitory-complex upstream to mTORC1, and regulates mTOR signaling in a TSC2 dependent manner. These results demonstrate that SIRT1 negatively regulates mTOR signaling potentially through the TSC1/2 complex."
https://openalex.org/W2054035764,"Background Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive type of brain tumor in humans and the first cancer with comprehensive genomic profiles mapped by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. A central challenge in large-scale genome projects, such as the TCGA GBM project, is the ability to distinguish cancer-causing “driver” mutations from passively selected “passenger” mutations. Principal Findings In contrast to a purely frequency based approach to identifying driver mutations in cancer, we propose an automated network-based approach for identifying candidate oncogenic processes and driver genes. The approach is based on the hypothesis that cellular networks contain functional modules, and that tumors target specific modules critical to their growth. Key elements in the approach include combined analysis of sequence mutations and DNA copy number alterations; use of a unified molecular interaction network consisting of both protein-protein interactions and signaling pathways; and identification and statistical assessment of network modules, i.e. cohesive groups of genes of interest with a higher density of interactions within groups than between groups. Conclusions We confirm and extend the observation that GBM alterations tend to occur within specific functional modules, in spite of considerable patient-to-patient variation, and that two of the largest modules involve signaling via p53, Rb, PI3K and receptor protein kinases. We also identify new candidate drivers in GBM, including AGAP2/CENTG1, a putative oncogene and an activator of the PI3K pathway; and, three additional significantly altered modules, including one involved in microtubule organization. To facilitate the application of our network-based approach to additional cancer types, we make the method freely available as part of a software tool called NetBox."
https://openalex.org/W2119184935,"Extracellular factors may act on cells in two distinct modes: an acute increase in concentration as a result of regulated secretion, or a gradual increase in concentration when secreted constitutively or from a distant source. We found that cellular responses to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) differed markedly depending on how BDNF was delivered. In cultured rat hippocampal neurons, acute and gradual increases in BDNF elicited transient and sustained activation of TrkB receptor and its downstream signaling, respectively, leading to differential expression of Homer1 and Arc. Transient TrkB activation promoted neurite elongation and spine head enlargement, whereas sustained TrkB activation facilitated neurite branch and spine neck elongation. In hippocampal slices, fast and slow increases in BDNF enhanced basal synaptic transmission and LTP, respectively. Thus, the kinetics of TrkB activation is critical for cell signaling and functions. This temporal dimension in cellular signaling may also have implications for the therapeutic drug design."

https://openalex.org/W1987369248,"Inhibition of an initiating oncogene often leads to extensive tumour cell death, a phenomenon known as oncogene addiction. This has led to the search for compounds that specifically target and inhibit oncogenes as anticancer agents. However, there has been no systematic exploration of whether chromosomal instability generated as a result of deregulation of the mitotic checkpoint pathway, a frequent characteristic of solid tumours, has any effect on oncogene addiction. Here we show that induction of chromosome instability by overexpression of the mitotic checkpoint gene Mad2 in mice does not affect the regression of Kras-driven lung tumours when Kras is inhibited. However, tumours that experience transient Mad2 overexpression and consequent chromosome instability recur at markedly elevated rates. The recurrent tumours are highly aneuploid and have varied activation of pro-proliferative pathways. Thus, early chromosomal instability may be responsible for tumour relapse after seemingly effective anticancer treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2007011011,"Background Escherichia coli are widespread in the environment and pathogenic strains cause diseases of mucosal surfaces including the female genital tract. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID; metritis) or endometritis affects ∼40% of cattle after parturition. We tested the expectation that multiple genetically diverse E. coli from the environment opportunistically contaminate the uterine lumen after parturition to establish PID. Methodology/Principal Findings Distinct clonal groups of E. coli were identified by Random Amplification of Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) from animals with uterine disease and these differed from known diarrhoeic or extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli. The endometrial pathogenic E. coli (EnPEC) were more adherent and invasive for endometrial epithelial and stromal cells, compared with E. coli isolated from the uterus of clinically unaffected animals. The endometrial epithelial and stromal cells produced more prostaglandin E2 and interleukin-8 in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) purified from EnPEC compared with non-pathogenic E. coli. The EnPEC or their LPS also caused PID when infused into the uterus of mice with accumulation of neutrophils and macrophages in the endometrium. Infusion of EnPEC was only associated with bacterial invasion of the endometrium and myometrium. Despite their ability to invade cultured cells, elicit host cell responses and establish PID, EnPEC lacked sixteen genes commonly associated with adhesion and invasion by enteric or extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli, though the ferric yersiniabactin uptake gene (fyuA) was present in PID-associated EnPEC. Endometrial epithelial or stromal cells from wild type but not Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) null mice secreted prostaglandin E2 and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1) in response to LPS from EnPEC, highlighting the key role of LPS in PID. Conclusions/Significance The implication arising from the discovery of EnPEC is that development of treatments or vaccines for PID should focus specifically on EnPEC and not other strains of E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1998418245,"A prostate cancer epigenome map reveals that genes are suppressed in clusters through long-range epigenetic silencing (LRES). Regions of LRES contain known tumour suppressors and miRNAs, and may expand to neighbouring genes during tumour progression. Silencing of individual genes can occur by genetic and epigenetic processes during carcinogenesis, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. By creating an integrated prostate cancer epigenome map using tiling arrays, we show that contiguous regions of gene suppression commonly occur through long-range epigenetic silencing (LRES). We identified 47 LRES regions in prostate cancer, typically spanning about 2 Mb and harbouring approximately 12 genes, with a prevalence of tumour suppressor and miRNA genes. Our data reveal that LRES is associated with regional histone deacetylation combined with subdomains of different epigenetic remodelling patterns, which include re-enforcement, gain or exchange of repressive histone, and DNA methylation marks. The transcriptional and epigenetic state of genes in normal prostate epithelial and human embryonic stem cells can play a critical part in defining the mode of cancer-associated epigenetic remodelling. We propose that consolidation or effective reduction of the cancer genome commonly occurs in domains through a combination of LRES and LOH or genomic deletion, resulting in reduced transcriptional plasticity within these regions."
https://openalex.org/W1986586470,"We found that demyelinated axons formed functional glutamatergic synapses onto adult-born NG2(+) oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) migrating from the subventricular zone after focal demyelination of adult mice corpus callosum. This glutamatergic input was substantially reduced compared with endogenous callosal OPCs 1 week after lesion and was lost on differentiation into oligodendrocytes. Therefore, axon-oligodendrocyte progenitor synapse formation is a transient and regulated step that occurs during remyelination of callosal axons."
https://openalex.org/W1966426962,"Immunotherapy based on natural killer (NK) cell infusions is a potential adjuvant treatment for many cancers. Such therapeutic application in humans requires large numbers of functional NK cells that have been selected and expanded using clinical grade protocols. We established an extremely efficient cytokine-based culture system for ex vivo expansion of NK cells from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from umbilical cord blood (UCB). Systematic refinement of this two-step system using a novel clinical grade medium resulted in a therapeutically applicable cell culture protocol. CD56+CD3− NK cell products could be routinely generated from freshly selected CD34+ UCB cells with a mean expansion of >15,000 fold and a nearly 100% purity. Moreover, our protocol has the capacity to produce more than 3-log NK cell expansion from frozen CD34+ UCB cells. These ex vivo-generated cell products contain NK cell subsets differentially expressing NKG2A and killer immunoglobulin-like receptors. Furthermore, UCB-derived CD56+ NK cells generated by our protocol uniformly express high levels of activating NKG2D and natural cytotoxicity receptors. Functional analysis showed that these ex vivo-generated NK cells efficiently target myeloid leukemia and melanoma tumor cell lines, and mediate cytolysis of primary leukemia cells at low NK-target ratios. Our culture system exemplifies a major breakthrough in producing pure NK cell products from limited numbers of CD34+ cells for cancer immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2059328247,"To gain insight into the role of genomic alterations in breast cancer progression, we conducted a comprehensive genetic characterization of a series of four cell lines derived from MCF10A. MCF10A is an immortalized mammary epithelial cell line (MEC); MCF10AT is a premalignant cell line generated from MCF10A by transformation with an activated HRAS gene; MCF10CA1h and MCF10CA1a, both derived from MCF10AT xenografts, form well-differentiated and poorly-differentiated malignant tumors in the xenograft models, respectively. We analyzed DNA copy number variation using the Affymetrix 500 K SNP arrays with the goal of identifying gene-specific amplification and deletion events. In addition to a previously noted deletion in the CDKN2A locus, our studies identified MYC amplification in all four cell lines. Additionally, we found intragenic deletions in several genes, including LRP1B in MCF10CA1h and MCF10CA1a, FHIT and CDH13 in MCF10CA1h, and RUNX1 in MCF10CA1a. We confirmed the deletion of RUNX1 in MCF10CA1a by DNA and RNA analyses, as well as the absence of the RUNX1 protein in that cell line. Furthermore, we found that RUNX1 expression was reduced in high-grade primary breast tumors compared to low/mid-grade tumors. Mutational analysis identified an activating PIK3CA mutation, H1047R, in MCF10CA1h and MCF10CA1a, which correlates with an increase of AKT1 phosphorylation at Ser473 and Thr308. Furthermore, we showed increased expression levels for genes located in the genomic regions with copy number gain. Thus, our genetic analyses have uncovered sequential molecular events that delineate breast tumor progression. These events include CDKN2A deletion and MYC amplification in immortalization, HRAS activation in transformation, PIK3CA activation in the formation of malignant tumors, and RUNX1 deletion associated with poorly-differentiated malignant tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2028950558,"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is characterized by progressive night blindness, visual field loss, altered vascular permeability and loss of central vision. Currently there is no effective treatment available except gene replacement therapy has shown promise in a few patients with specific gene defects. There is an urgent need to develop therapies that offer generic neuro-and vascular-protective effects with non-invasive intervention. Here we explored the potential of systemic administration of pluripotent bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to rescue vision and associated vascular pathology in the Royal College Surgeons (RCS) rat, a well-established animal model for RP.Animals received syngeneic MSCs (1x10(6) cells) by tail vein at an age before major photoreceptor loss.both rod and cone photoreceptors were preserved (5-6 cells thick) at the time when control animal has a single layer of photoreceptors remained; Visual function was significantly preserved compared with controls as determined by visual acuity and luminance threshold recording from the superior colliculus; The number of pathological vascular complexes (abnormal vessels associated with migrating pigment epithelium cells) and area of vascular leakage that would ordinarily develop were dramatically reduced; Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated there was upregulation of growth factors and immunohistochemistry revealed that there was an increase in neurotrophic factors within eyes of animals that received MSCs.These results underscore the potential application of MSCs in treating retinal degeneration. The advantages of this non-invasive cell-based therapy are: cells are easily isolated and can be expanded in large quantity for autologous graft; hypoimmunogenic nature as allogeneic donors; less controversial in nature than other stem cells; can be readministered with minor discomfort. Therefore, MSCs may prove to be the ideal cell source for auto-cell therapy for retinal degeneration and other ocular vascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2124402284,"The risk of premature cardiovascular disease in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) can be profoundly reduced by cholesterol-lowering therapy, and current guidelines for FH advocate ambitious low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals. In the present study, we determined whether these goals are reflected in current clinical practice once FH has been diagnosed.In 2008, we sent questionnaires to all subjects (aged 18-65 years) who were molecularly diagnosed with FH in the year 2006 through the screening program in The Netherlands. Of these 1062 subjects, 781 completed the questionnaire (46% males; mean age: 42+/-12 years; mean LDL-C at molecular diagnosis (baseline): 4.1+/-1.3 mmol/L). The number of persons that used cholesterol-lowering therapy increased from 397 (51%) at baseline to 636 (81%) after diagnosis. Mean treated LDL-C levels decreased significantly to 3.2+/-1.1 mmol/L two years after diagnosis. Only 22% achieved the LDL-C target level of < or = 2.5 mmol/L.The proportion of patients using cholesterol-lowering medication was significantly increased after FH diagnosis through genetic cascade screening. The attained LDL-C levels were lower than those reported in previous surveys on medication use in FH, which could reflect the effect of more stringent lipid target levels. However, only a minority of the medication users reached the LDL-C target."
https://openalex.org/W1986684160,"The BCL-2 family members BAK and BAX are required for apoptosis and trigger mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Here we identify a MOMP-independent function of BAK as a required factor for long-chain ceramide production in response to pro-apoptotic stress. UV-C irradiation of wild-type (WT) cells increased long-chain ceramides; blocking ceramide generation prevented caspase activation and cell death, demonstrating that long-chain ceramides play a key role in UV-C-induced apoptosis. In contrast, UV-C irradiation did not increase long-chain ceramides in BAK and BAX double knock-out cells. Notably, this was not specific to the cell type (baby mouse kidney cells, hematopoietic) nor the apoptotic stimulus employed (UV-C, cisplatin, and growth factor withdrawal). Importantly, long-chain ceramide generation was dependent on the presence of BAK, but not BAX. However, ceramide generation was independent of the known downstream actions of BAK in apoptosis (MOMP or caspase activation), suggesting a novel role for BAK in apoptosis. Finally, enzymatic assays identified ceramide synthase as the mechanism by which BAK regulates ceramide metabolism. There was no change in CerS expression at the message or protein level, indicating regulation at the post-translational level. Moreover, CerS activity in BAK KO microsomes can be reactivated upon addition of BAK-containing microsomes. The data presented indicate that ceramide-induced apoptosis is dependent upon BAK and identify a novel role for BAK during apoptosis. By establishing a unique role for BAK in long-chain ceramide metabolism, these studies further demonstrate that the seemingly redundant proteins BAK and BAX have distinct mechanisms of action during apoptosis induction."

In addition to ENaC, SGK1 is also involved in regulation of glucose transporter SGLT1, glutamate transporter EAAT1, glutamine transporter SN1, and cardiac sodium channel SCN5A through phosphorylation and inhibition of Nedd4-2 (28Dieter M.

Interestingly, SGK1 is activated by a serine/threonine kinase, WNK1 (with no lysine (K) kinase 1), which is a known causal molecule for pseudohypoaldosteronism type II hypertension (32Choate K.A. Kahle K.T. Wilson F.H. Nelson-Williams C. Lifton R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). WNK1 activates SGK1, inhibiting Nedd4-2 and enhancing ENaC activity, which results in hypertension (33Xu B.E. Stippec S. Chu P.Y. Lazrak A. Li X.J. Lee B.H. English J.M. Ortega B. Huang C.L. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 10315-10320Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Nedd4-2 by AMP-activated kinase, which causes inhibition of ENaC activity, was also observed (34Bhalla V. Oyster N.M. Fitch A.C. Wijngaarden M.A. Neumann D. Schlattner U. Pearce D. Hallows K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26159-26169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Nedd4 by AMP-activated kinase may be an important means for regulation of the E3 ligase activity or recognition of the substrate. A recent research report shows that Nedd4 is phosphorylated by G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (35Sanchez-Perez A. Kumar S. Cook D.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 359: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The effect of phosphorylation by G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 on Nedd4 activity is not known.The C2 domain was originally identified as a calcium-binding domain in protein kinase C, which is required for calcium-dependent activation of the kinase activity (36Luo J.H. Weinstein I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23580-23584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Medkova M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17544-17552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). More than 100 proteins are now known to contain the C2 domain (38Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-23790Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). The C2 domain of Nedd4 has been proposed as a calcium-dependent inositol phospholipid-binding module (39Plant P.J. Yeger H. Staub O. Howard P. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32329-32336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 40Dunn R. Klos D.A. Adler A.S. Hicke L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Early studies indicated that the C2 domain mediated the translocation of cytoplasmic Nedd4 to plasma membrane by binding to phospholipids (39Plant P.J. Yeger H. Staub O. Howard P. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32329-32336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Annexin XIIIb was identified as a partner for the C2 domain of Nedd4 to bind to apical plasma membranes in epithelial cells (41Plant P.J. Lafont F. Lecat S. Verkade P. Simons K. Rotin D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1473-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In yeast, the C2 domain of Rsp5, the homolog of Nedd4, is required for functional compartmentalization of Rsp5 and ubiquitination of its substrate (40Dunn R. Klos D.A. Adler A.S. Hicke L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells the WW domains, but not the C2 domain, are required for Nedd4 to down-regulate ENaC (42Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. McDonald F.J. Bucher D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28321-28326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It was observed that the C2 domain truncation mutant of Nedd4 had stronger inhibition of ENaC activity than wild-type Nedd4 (42Snyder P.M. Olson D.R. McDonald F.J. Bucher D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28321-28326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), suggesting that the C2 domain has an inhibitory role in Nedd4 function. A recent study has shown that the C2 domain of Smurf2 directly binds to the HECT domain and functions as an auto-inhibitory domain for E3 ligase activity (43Wiesner S. Ogunjimi A.A. Wang H.R. Rotin D. Sicheri F. Wrana J.L. Forman-Kay J.D. Cell. 2007; 130: 651-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar).In this report, we confirmed that the C2 domain of Nedd4 is the auto-inhibitory domain for its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Deletion of the C2 domain causes constitutive activation of Nedd4. Calcium activates Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity both in vitro and in vivo by releasing the auto-inhibition. Signaling that elevates intracellular calcium activates Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Thus, we propose that release of the C2 domain-mediated auto-inhibition by calcium ions or other cellular activators is a key mechanism for activation of Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligases in response to cellular signaling.DISCUSSIONWe have shown by mutational analysis and GST-Nedd4-C2 domain pulldown assays that the C2 domain of Nedd4 functions as an auto-inhibitory domain through binding to the HECT domain. Weisner et al. also reported that the C2 domain of Smurf2 directly binds to the HECT domain and functions as an auto-inhibition module to the E3 ligase activity (43Wiesner S. Ogunjimi A.A. Wang H.R. Rotin D. Sicheri F. Wrana J.L. Forman-Kay J.D. Cell. 2007; 130: 651-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). They proposed that Nedd4 has a similar structure to Smurf2 and showed that truncation of the C2 domain activates Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in an in vitro ubiquitin ligase activity assay (43Wiesner S. Ogunjimi A.A. Wang H.R. Rotin D. Sicheri F. Wrana J.L. Forman-Kay J.D. Cell. 2007; 130: 651-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Thus, the auto-inhibition of the E3 ligase activity by the C2 domain is a key feature of Nedd4. Currently we do not know whether the auto-inhibition is formed through the intra- or the intermolecular interaction between the C2 and the HECT domains. We speculate that the both interactions could form the auto-inhibition. We hypothesized that activation of Nedd4 E3 ligase activity is directly related to releasing the auto-inhibition. Our data show that this auto-inhibitory mechanism is regulated by calcium. Calcium activates Nedd4 by binding to the C2 domain and releasing the C2 domain-mediated auto-inhibition. The membrane-rich fraction (400Kxg fraction) enhances calcium to bind to the C2 domain; together calcium and the membrane-rich fraction generate a robust activation of Nedd4. We also show signal-dependent activation of endogenous Nedd4 in cells. Finally, we also show that calcium-mediated activation of Nedd4 is enhanced by a heat-sensitive membrane fraction. Based on these results, we propose a model for activation of Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity shown in Fig. 7. In this model, Nedd4 is kept inactive by either the intra- or intermolecular interaction (the intramolecular interaction depicted in Fig. 7) between the C2 and the HECT domains in calcium-free or low calcium environment. Cellular signaling elevates intracellular calcium concentration and results in binding of calcium to the C2 domain of Nedd4. The calcium binding enhances the affinity of the C2 domain to the membranes and promotes Nedd4 translocation to the membrane fraction, which releases the auto-inhibition and activates Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. We speculate that binding of calcium to the C2 domain (intermediate status) partially disrupts interaction of the C2 domain with the HECT domain and makes the C2 domain accessible to membranes. This is based on our finding that calcium alone only partially activates Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5). Binding to the membranes stabilizes the active conformation of Nedd4.The C2 domain of Nedd4 has been demonstrated to bind to inositol phospholipids and proposed as an inositol phospholipid-binding module (39Plant P.J. Yeger H. Staub O. Howard P. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32329-32336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 40Dunn R. Klos D.A. Adler A.S. Hicke L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The C2 domain also binds to phosphatidylcholine or/and phosphatidylserine in a calcium-promoting manner (39Plant P.J. Yeger H. Staub O. Howard P. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32329-32336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that translocation of Nedd4 to plasma membrane occurred in response to elevation of intracellular calcium in cells (39Plant P.J. Yeger H. Staub O. Howard P. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32329-32336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 41Plant P.J. Lafont F. Lecat S. Verkade P. Simons K. Rotin D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1473-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We speculate that calcium-dependent membrane translocation of Nedd4 is a pivotal step for activation in response to intracellular signaling. We observed a dramatic enhancement in calcium-mediated activation of Nedd4 by a 400,000 × g particulate fraction. This enhancement was eliminated by heating the particulate fraction for 10 min at 100 °C, suggesting that the component in the particulate fraction that collaborates with calcium to activate Nedd4 might be a protein. This component could be an endogenous activator of Nedd4 that activates Nedd4 by augmenting or/and stabilizing the activation effect of calcium by releasing the C2 domain-mediated auto-inhibition. Identification of this component would help us further to understand the mechanism of Nedd4 ligase activation and delineate signaling pathways of Nedd4 ligases.Although Smurf2, similar to Nedd4, also has the C2 domain-mediated auto-inhibitory mode for regulation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, ITCH (AIP4) and WWP1, the two other members of the HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase family that are close to Nedd4, seem not to have such a regulatory mechanism. We observed no activation effect with the C2 domain truncation of ITCH and WWP1 (data not shown). It has been shown that JNK-mediated phosphorylation plays an important role in activation of ITCH (44Gallagher E. Gao M. Liu Y.C. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation site was located between the C2 domain and the WW1 domain. It was proposed that the region executes auto-inhibition by interaction with the HECT domain, while phosphorylation releases the auto-inhibition (44Gallagher E. Gao M. Liu Y.C. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Protein phosphorylation may also be involved in activation of Nedd4. It was observed that AMP activated kinase-phosphorylated Nedd4-2, and the phosphorylation enhanced binding of Nedd4-2 to its substrate ENaC, thus down-regulation of ENaC activity (34Bhalla V. Oyster N.M. Fitch A.C. Wijngaarden M.A. Neumann D. Schlattner U. Pearce D. Hallows K.R. J. Biol.

J. 2004; 379: 513-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), activation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of Nedd4 in response to cellular signaling is poorly understood. Here we show that the C2 domain of Nedd4 E3 ubiquitin ligases functions as an auto-inhibitory domain to the ligase activity, and that the auto-inhibition is released by calcium. This molecular mechanism may serve as a switch for activation/inactivation of Nedd4 in cells and couple cellular signals, such as EGFR and acetylcholine receptor, to protein ubiquitination, degradation, and trafficking. It has been shown that Nedd4-1 ubiquitinates tumor suppressor proteins and may be oncogenic (15Magnifico A. Ettenberg S. Yang C. Mariano J. Tiwari S. Fang S. Lipkowitz S. Weissman A.M. J. Biol.

The C2/calcium switch model for the ligase activity will provide novel insight into how Nedd4 regulates biological and pathological processes in response to cellular signaling.

Consequently, the role of PCSK9 in modulating circulating LDL makes it a promising therapeutic target for treating hypercholesterolemia and coronary heart disease. Although the C-terminal domain of PCSK9 is not involved in LDLR binding, the location of several naturally occurring mutations within this region suggests that it has an important role for PCSK9 function. Using a phage display library, we identified an anti-PCSK9 Fab (fragment antigen binding), 1G08, with subnanomolar affinity for PCSK9. In an assay measuring LDL uptake in HEK293 and HepG2 cells, 1G08 Fab reduced 50% the PCSK9-dependent inhibitory effects on LDL uptake. Importantly, we found that 1G08 did not affect the PCSK9-LDLR interaction but inhibited the internalization of PCSK9 in these cells. Furthermore, proteolysis and site-directed mutagenesis studies demonstrated that 1G08 Fab binds a region of β-strands encompassing Arg-549, Arg-580, Arg-582, Glu-607, Lys-609, and Glu-612 in the PCSK9 C-terminal domain. Consistent with these results, 1G08 fails to bind PCSK9ΔC, a truncated form of PCSK9 lacking the C-terminal domain. Additional studies revealed that lack of the C-terminal domain compromised the ability of PCSK9 to internalize into cells, and to inhibit LDL uptake. Together, the present study demonstrate that the PCSK9 C-terminal domain contribute to its inhibition of LDLR function mainly through its role in the cellular uptake of PCSK9 and LDLR complex. 1G08 Fab represents a useful new tool for delineating the mechanism of PCSK9 uptake and LDLR degradation.

Recently, we have characterized pili distribution and conservation in 289 GBS clinical isolates and we have shown that GBS has three pilus types, 1, 2a and 2b encoded by three corresponding pilus islands, and that each strain carries one or two islands. Here we have investigated the capacity of these strains to form biofilms. We have found that most of the biofilm-formers carry pilus 2a, and using insertion and deletion mutants we have confirmed that pilus type 2a, but not pilus types 1 and 2b, confers biofilm-forming phenotype. We also show that deletion of the major ancillary protein of type 2a did not impair biofilm formation while the inactivation of the other ancillary protein and of the backbone protein completely abolished this phenotype. Furthermore, antibodies raised against pilus components inhibited bacterial adherence to solid surfaces, offering new strategies to prevent GBS infection by targeting bacteria during their initial attachment to host epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1974056635,"Although bisexual reproduction has proven to be highly successful, parthenogenetic all-female populations occur frequently in certain taxa, including the whiptail lizards of the genus Aspidoscelis. Allozyme analysis revealed a high degree of fixed heterozygosity in these parthenogenetic species, supporting the view that they originated from hybridization events between related sexual species. It has remained unclear how the meiotic program is altered to produce diploid eggs while maintaining heterozygosity. Here we show that meiosis commences with twice the number of chromosomes in parthenogenetic versus sexual species, a mechanism that provides the basis for generating gametes with unreduced chromosome content without fundamental deviation from the classic meiotic program. Our observation of synaptonemal complexes and chiasmata demonstrate that a typical meiotic program occurs and that heterozygosity is not maintained by bypassing recombination. Instead, fluorescent in situ hybridization probes that distinguish between homologues reveal that bivalents form between sister chromosomes, the genetically identical products of the first of two premeiotic replication cycles. Sister chromosome pairing provides a mechanism for the maintenance of heterozygosity, which is critical for offsetting the reduced fitness associated with the lack of genetic diversity in parthenogenetic species."
https://openalex.org/W2113349997,"Background Burkholderia pseudomallei, a Gram-negative bacterium that causes melioidosis, was reported to produce biofilm. As the disease causes high relapse rate when compared to other bacterial infections, it therefore might be due to the reactivation of the biofilm forming bacteria which also provided resistance to antimicrobial agents. However, the mechanism on how biofilm can provide tolerance to antimicrobials is still unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings The change in resistance of B. pseudomallei to doxycycline, ceftazidime, imipenem, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole during biofilm formation were measured as minimum biofilm elimination concentration (MBEC) in 50 soil and clinical isolates and also in capsule, flagellin, LPS and biofilm mutants. Almost all planktonic isolates were susceptible to all agents studied. In contrast, when they were grown in the condition that induced biofilm formation, they were markedly resistant to all antimicrobial agents even though the amount of biofilm production was not the same. The capsule and O-side chains of LPS mutants had no effect on biofilm formation whereas the flagellin-defective mutant markedly reduced in biofilm production. No alteration of LPS profiles was observed when susceptible form was changed to resistance. The higher amount of N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) was detected in the high biofilm-producing isolates. Interestingly, the biofilm mutant which produced a very low amount of biofilm and was sensitive to antimicrobial agents significantly resisted those agents when grown in biofilm inducing condition. Conclusions/Significance The possible drug resistance mechanism of biofilm mutants and other isolates is not by having biofilm but rather from some factors that up-regulated when biofilm formation genes were stimulated. The understanding of genes related to this situation may lead us to prevent B. pseudomallei biofilms leading to the relapse of melioidosis."
https://openalex.org/W2017432154,"Interspecies DNA transfer is a major biological process leading to the accumulation of mutations inherited by sexual reproduction among eukaryotes. Lateral DNA transfer events and their inheritance has been challenging to document. In this study we modified a thermal asymmetric interlaced PCR by using additional targeted primers, along with Southern blots, fluorescence techniques, and bioinformatics, to identify lateral DNA transfer events from parasite to host. Instances of naturally occurring human infections by Trypanosoma cruzi are documented, where mitochondrial minicircles integrated mainly into retrotransposable LINE-1 of various chromosomes. The founders of five families show minicircle integrations that were transferred vertically to their progeny. Microhomology end-joining of 6 to 22 AC-rich nucleotide repeats in the minicircles and host DNA mediates foreign DNA integration. Heterogeneous minicircle sequences were distributed randomly among families, with diversity increasing due to subsequent rearrangement of inserted fragments. Mosaic recombination and hitchhiking on retrotransposition events to different loci were more prevalent in germ line as compared to somatic cells. Potential new genes, pseudogenes, and knockouts were identified. A pathway of minicircle integration and maintenance in the host genome is suggested. Thus, infection by T. cruzi has the unexpected consequence of increasing human genetic diversity, and Chagas disease may be a fortuitous share of negative selection. This demonstration of contemporary transfer of eukaryotic DNA to the human genome and its subsequent inheritance by descendants introduces a significant change in the scientific concept of evolutionary biology and medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2104295028,"Background Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) are increasingly used in humans; however, their impact is now questioned. At blastocyst stage, the trophectoderm is directly in contact with an artificial medium environment, which can impact placental development. This study was designed to carry out an in-depth analysis of the placental transcriptome after ART in mice. Methodology/Principal Findings Blastocysts were transferred either (1) after in vivo fertilization and development (control group) or (2) after in vitro fertilization and embryo culture. Placentas were then analyzed at E10.5. Six percent of transcripts were altered at the two-fold threshold in placentas of manipulated embryos, 2/3 of transcripts being down-regulated. Strikingly, the X-chromosome harbors 11% of altered genes, 2/3 being induced. Imprinted genes were modified similarly to the X. Promoter composition analysis indicates that FOXA transcription factors may be involved in the transcriptional deregulations. Conclusions For the first time, our study shows that in vitro fertilization associated with embryo culture strongly modify the placental expression profile, long after embryo manipulations, meaning that the stress of artificial environment is memorized after implantation. Expression of X and imprinted genes is also greatly modulated probably to adapt to adverse conditions. Our results highlight the importance of studying human placentas from ART."
https://openalex.org/W2055569438,"Background Trichoderma reesei, a mitosporic green mould, was recognized during the WW II based on a single isolate from the Solomon Islands and since then used in industry for production of cellulases. It is believed to be an anamorph (asexual stage) of the common pantropical ascomycete Hypocrea jecorina. Methodology/Principal Findings We combined molecular evolutionary analysis and multiple methods of phenotype profiling in order to reveal the genetic relationship of T. reesei to H. jecorina. The resulting data show that the isolates which were previously identified as H. jecorina by means of morphophysiology and ITS1 and 2 (rRNA gene cluster) barcode in fact comprise several species: i) H. jecorina/T. reesei sensu stricto which contains most of the teleomorphs (sexual stages) found on dead wood and the wild-type strain of T. reesei QM 6a; ii) T. parareesei nom. prov., which contains all strains isolated as anamorphs from soil; iii) and two other hypothetical new species for which only one or two isolates are available. In silico tests for recombination and in vitro mating experiments revealed a history of sexual reproduction for H. jecorina and confirmed clonality for T. parareesei nom. prov. Isolates of both species were consistently found worldwide in pantropical climatic zone. Ecophysiological comparison of H. jecorina and T. parareesei nom. prov. revealed striking differences in carbon source utilization, conidiation intensity, photosensitivity and mycoparasitism, thus suggesting adaptation to different ecological niches with the high opportunistic potential for T. parareesei nom. prov. Conclusions Our data prove that T. reesei belongs to a holomorph H. jecorina and displays a history of worldwide gene flow. We also show that its nearest genetic neighbour - T. parareesei nom. prov., is a cryptic phylogenetic agamospecies which inhabits the same biogeographic zone. These two species thus provide a so far rare example of sympatric speciation within saprotrophic fungi, with divergent ecophysiological adaptations and reproductive strategies."

The steady-state level of the AtFtsH10 transcripts did not change in ftsh3 compared with wild type plants, but we found that almost twice more of the AtFtsH10 transcripts were associated with polysomes in ftsh3. Based on this result, we assume that the AtFtsH10 protein is synthesized at a higher rate in the ftsh3 mutant.

IntroductionInfluenza A virus (IAV) 3The abbreviations used are: IAVinfluenza A virusTFEtrifluoroethanolDLSdynamic light scatteringThTthioflavin TThSthioflavin SSPRsurface plasmon resonance. is a major pathogen of humans and animals responsible for three main pandemics of the last century: 1957, 1968, and the most severe in 1918 with 20–40 million deaths reported (1Lamb R.A. Takeda M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1286-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Every year, influenza epidemics cause considerable illness and death. Since 2003, one of the greatest worldwide pandemic threats remains the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian viruses that display a high lethality rate (60% of the 438 cases resulted in death) (2Lipatov A.S.

Since its identification in April 2009, a novel swine origin influenza A virus H1N1 is currently causing a pandemic as declared by the WHO in June 2009 (around 1% of the 300,000 cases resulted in death) (4Garten R.J.

IAV belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae viral family, and its genome is composed of eight negative-strand RNA gene segments encoding 11 proteins (5Palese P. Cell. 1977; 10: 1-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The virulence of IAV is complex and can be influenced by each of the eight viral segments and notably the HA, NA, and PB1 segments (6Pappas C. Aguilar P.V. Basler C.F. Solórzano A. Zeng H. Perrone L.A. Palese P. García-Sastre A. Katz J.M. Tumpey T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 3064-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).PB1-F2, the 11th discovered IAV protein, is translated from an alternative reading frame in the PB1 gene (+1 reading frame of PB1, PB1-Frame 2) (7Chen W. Calvo P.A. Malide D. Gibbs J. Schubert U. Bacik I. Basta S. O'Neill R. Schickli J. Palese P. Henklein P. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1306-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). PB1-F2 is expressed by many IAV isolates from a wide range of hosts and in nearly all avian and human strains (8Pancuchárová H. Russ G. Acta Virol. 2006; 50: 269-272PubMed Google Scholar, 9Zell R. Krumbholz A. Wutzler P. Emerg. Infect.

Gen Virol. 2007; 88: 536-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Recent studies have described the influence of PB1-F2 on viral pathogenesis in mouse models (11Zamarin D. Ortigoza M.B. Palese P. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 7976-7983Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 12Conenello G.M. Zamarin D. Perrone L.A. Tumpey T. Palese P.

Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 2: 240-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Loss of PB1-F2 expression results in attenuation of the virus and in a more rapid clearance of the virus from the lungs of infected mice. Insertion of a single N66S mutation present in the PB1-F2 of the 1918 pandemic strain is sufficient to increase virulence of a low pathogenic IAV in mice (12Conenello G.M. Zamarin D. Perrone L.A. Tumpey T. Palese P. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: 1414-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Moreover, a mouse model of secondary Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia following A/PR/834 virus infection shows greater weight loss of infected mice, more severe pneumonia, and a higher lethality with the virus expressing PB1-F2 compared with the PB1-F2 knock-out virus (13Conenello G.M. Palese P. Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 2: 207-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 14McAuley J.L. Hornung F. Boyd K.L. Smith A.M. McKeon R. Bennink J. Yewdell J.W. McCullers J.A. Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 2: 240-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In addition, contemporary H1N1 strains that no longer express PB1-F2 seem to be less virulent. PB1-F2 is considered as one of the factors that contribute to IAV virulence (15Basler C.F. Aguilar P.V. Antiviral Res. 2008; 79: 166-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).Compared with the other IAV proteins, PB1-F2 shows several distinct features. PB1-F2 is expressed differently among infected cells and independently of the expression level of other viral proteins. PB1-F2 has a short half-life and is rapidly degraded (7Chen W. Calvo P.A. Malide D. Gibbs J. Schubert U. Bacik I. Basta S. O'Neill R. Schickli J. Palese P. Henklein P. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1306-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). PB1-F2 is generally described as a proapoptotic factor that could facilitate evasion of host defenses (with NS1), allowing the virus to escape from the immune system by inducing apoptosis in macrophages and monocytes (1Lamb R.A. Takeda M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1286-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7Chen W. Calvo P.A. Malide D. Gibbs J. Schubert U. Bacik I. Basta S. O'Neill R. Schickli J. Palese P. Henklein P.

Thus, PB1-F2 is thought to compromise the ability of the host to mobilize adaptive immune responses (18Coleman J.R. Virol. J. 2007; 4: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Another specific feature is the mitochondrial tropism of PB1-F2, which is only partial because PB1-F2 can also be present in the nucleus and cytoplasm of infected cells, depending on the cell type (7Chen W. Calvo P.A. Malide D. Gibbs J. Schubert U. Bacik I. Basta S. O'Neill R. Schickli J. Palese P. Henklein P. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Nat.

Cell Microbiol. 2008; 10: 1140-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal domain of the protein, containing the mitochondrial targeting signal, is capable by itself to interfere with mitochondrial function and cellular viability (20Gibbs J.S. Malide D. Hornung F. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 7214-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 21Yamada H. Chounan R. Higashi Y. Kurihara N. Kido H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 578: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Studies of the interaction of a synthetic form of PB1-F2 with membrane showed that PB1-F2 was able to create pores of variable size in planar lipid membranes, suggesting that PB1-F2 could oligomerize to permeabilize membranes (22Chanturiya A.N. Basañez G. Schubert U. Henklein P. Yewdell J.W. Zimmerberg J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 6304-6312Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). PB1-F2 was also shown to interact with two proteins implicated in the formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore complex, ANT-3 (adenine nucleotide translocator 3), and VDAC-1 (voltage-dependent ion channel 1) (17Zamarin D. García-Sastre A. Xiao X. Wang R. Palese P. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: e4Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar).Although new insights have been gained in understanding the function of PB1-F2, very little structural information is available. Bruns and co-workers (23Henklein P. Bruns K. Nimtz M. Wray V. Tessmer U. Schubert U. J. Pept. Sci. 2005; 11: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24Röder R. Bruns K. Sharma A.

The stability of the structured regions of PB1-F2 was shown to be dependent on the hydrophobicity of the solvent: random coil in aqueous solution and α-helical structure upon the addition of trifluoroethanol (TFE). This α-helical structure present in the positively charged C-terminal domain of PB1-F2 was described as not a true amphipathic helix and is more compact than previously predicted. In an effort to obtain deeper insight into the structure-function of PB1-F2 and to better understand its role in the virus cycle, we produced and compared PB1-F2 originating from seven IAV isolates, including the highly pathogenic strain H5N1, the 1918 Brevig Mission strain, and two apathogenic avian strains, in biochemical and biophysical assays. We showed that PB1-F2 can be classified in the newly described group of intrinsically disordered proteins, capable of conformation changes switching from a random to an α-helical or β-sheet secondary structure. PB1-F2 is able to oligomerize to form amyloid fibers upon different environmental conditions. The presence of amyloid PB1-F2 structures was also evidenced in infected cells. Moreover, functional tests showed that the seven variants of PB1-F2 efficiently permeabilized membranes.DISCUSSIONIn the present work, we have investigated both secondary and oligomeric structures of seven PB1-F2 variants to gain insight into their structural and functional relationships. We show that PB1-F2 has distinct folding pathways leading to the formation of either disordered conformations or α-helices or oligomeric β-enriched structures, depending on physico-chemical conditions (Fig. 7). As previously observed, our results confirm the disordered structure of PB1-F2 in aqueous solutions (acidic) as well as the formation of an α-helical secondary structure in TFE (25Bruns K. Studtrucker N. Sharma A. Fossen T. Mitzner D. Eissmann A. Tessmer U. Röder R. Henklein P. Wray V. Schubert U. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 353-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). TFE is well known to induce α-helix folding by stabilizing hydrogen bonds in peptides (36Buck M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1998; 31: 297-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 37Montserret R. Aubert-Foucher E. McLeish M.J. Hill J.M. Ficheux D. Jaquinod M. van der Rest M. Deléage G. Penin F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6479-6488Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) even if they do not have an intrinsic propensity to adopt α-helical structure. In contrast, all PB1-F2 variants exhibit β-sheet secondary structures in the presence of acetonitrile. Compared with TFE, acetonitrile is less polar, and thus it is a weaker hydrogen bond donor (38Kamlet M.J. Abboud J.L. Taft R.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1977; 99: 6027-6037Crossref Scopus (1502) Google Scholar). Moreover, the β-sheet structural conformational switch of PB1-F2 was also observed with the addition of SDS. This mild detergent is commonly used for probing conformation of small proteins due to its ability to induce and stabilize ordered conformations in peptides having structure-forming potential (39Chang D.K.

U.S.A. 1992; 89: 4462-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Furthermore, SDS micelles have been used extensively for the structural investigations of membrane peptides because they provide an anionic, membrane-mimicking environment with a hydrophobic core and a polar head (42Montserret R. McLeish M.J. Böckmann A. Geourjon C. Penin F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8362-8373Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Therefore, it clearly appears that the microenvironment surrounding PB1-F2 strongly affects its folding pathway. Finally, in the presence of small unilamellar asolectin liposomes of net negative charge, all PB1-F2 variants adopt a β-sheet conformation similar to those observed with acetonitrile and SDS.PB1-F2 oligomerizes in all of the conditions that favor β-sheet-enriched structure formation. In most cases, protein fibers emerge from an equilibrium of folded protein states with local unfolded or marginally stable structures that can be self-assembled into β-sheet oligomers, leading finally to the irreversible formation of insoluble fiber (43Dobson C.M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). In contrast, oligomeric structures were not observed in TFE. The α-helical conformation evidenced with TFE may be considered as an end conversion pathway because only the PB1-F2 monomeric structured form was observed in this environmental condition. Fluorinated alcohols, such as TFE, have been shown to favor monomeric protein conformation by disrupting hydrophobic interaction in aggregated amyloid preparations (44Barrow C.J. Yasuda A. Kenny P.T. Zagorski M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 1075-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). Only amorphous aggregates were observed upon the addition of acetonitrile. Amyloid fibers were generated in 0.01% SDS solution. Fibers were also observed in the presence of asolectin liposomes, as visualized by electronic microscopy. PB1-F2 variants form fibers of different lengths, from 100 nm to 1 μm. Because PB1-F2 variants exhibit differential abilities to form β-sheets and amyloid fibers, this process is likely to be sequence-specific. The structural switch leading to an amyloid pathway was observed for other viral proteins, such as the DNA binding domain of papillomavirus E2 proteins and EBNA-1 Epstein-Barr virus protein in vitro (45Wetzler D.E. Castaño E.M. de Prat-Gay G. Protein Sci. 2007; 16: 744-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 46Freire E. Oddo C. Frappier L. de Prat-Gay G. Proteins. 2008; 70: 450-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).We also checked whether the structural switch between the unfolded state and oligomeric β-sheet-enriched structures may constitute a critical element for the regulation of PB1-F2 activities. PB1-F2 was previously reported to form pores of variable sizes in planar membranes (22Chanturiya A.N. Basañez G. Schubert U. Henklein P. Yewdell J.W. Zimmerberg J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 6304-6312Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Otherwise, PB1-F2 was shown to be cytotoxic when added to cell medium at a low concentration (7Chen W. Calvo P.A. Malide D. Gibbs J. Schubert U. Bacik I. Basta S. O'Neill R. Schickli J. Palese P. Henklein P. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1306-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) and to promote loss of mitochondrial membrane potential by inducing morphological alterations (7Chen W. Calvo P.A. Malide D. Gibbs J. Schubert U. Bacik I. Basta S. O'Neill R. Schickli J. Palese P. Henklein P. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1306-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 17Zamarin D. García-Sastre A. Xiao X. Wang R. Palese P. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: e4Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). We show here that all of the variants used in this study permeabilize asolectin liposomes very efficiently, even at 5 nm nanomolar range concentrations. The fact that PB1-F2 adopts a β-sheet structure in the presence of synthetic membranes suggests a possible pore formation activity, as observed for many amyloid-forming proteins (33Lashuel H.A. Sci. Aging Knowledge Environ. 2005; 2005: pe28Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the net positive charge of PB1-F2 in acidic conditions may promote its incorporation into negatively charged asolectin liposomes by electrostatic interaction. Lysis assays showed that there is no direct correlation between the length of fibers and PB1-F2 activity. Interestingly, the addition of preformed fibers to liposomes did not lead to liposome permeabilization. This suggests that a prefibrillar protein but not amyloid may be the active lytic form. The ordered prefibrillar aggregates may form nonspecific pores perturbing cell ionic homeostasis. Frequently, prefibrillar aggregates display much higher toxicity than mature fibrils (47Stefani M. Dobson C.M. J. Mol. Med. 2003; 81: 678-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar, 48Kayed R. Sokolov Y. Edmonds B. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Hall J.E. Glabe C.G. J. Biol.

Wopfner F. Grosclaude J. Schätzl H. Lasmézas C.I. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e125Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The fast leakage kinetics observed here (within a few seconds) suggests the formation of β-amyloid pore structures rather than the generation of long fiber aggregates. The high activity of PB1-F2 on membranes (with pores formed at nanomolar concentrations) suggests that PB1-F2 within an infected cell may contribute to perturbation of the intracellular ionic homeostasis, leading ultimately to cell death.Our results do not rule out the possibility that free or membrane-bound PB1-F2 interacts with cellular and/or viral proteins. Actually, PB1-F2 was shown to interact with the mitochondrial proteins VDAC-1 and ANT-3 and to enhance the opening of the permeability transition pore complex (17Zamarin D. García-Sastre A. Xiao X. Wang R. Palese P. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: e4Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). It has also been recently proposed that PB1-F2 could be involved in interactions with members of the Bcl-2 family known to regulate mitochondrially mediated apoptosis (50McLean J.E. Datan E. Matassov D. Zakeri Z.F. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 8233-8246Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PB1-F2 was shown to regulate viral polymerase activity by interaction with the PB1 protein in the nucleus (19Mazur I. Anhlan D. Mitzner D. Wixler L. Schubert U. Ludwig S. Cell Microbiol. 2008; 10: 1140-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The natively disordered state of PB1-F2 in aqueous solutions could allow interactions with all of these proteins and lipids. Proteins other than PB1-F2 have also been shown to require a high degree of structural disorder to fulfill their functions and need to undergo disorder-order transition during or prior to their biological function (51Uversky V.N. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 739-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). Such proteins are frequently involved in some of the most important regulatory functions in the cell, and the lack of intrinsic structure in many cases is relieved when the protein binds to its target molecule (52Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (2303) Google Scholar).A critical finding of our work is that PB1-F2 forms amyloid-like fibers in infected cells. Although amyloidosis is mainly implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, fibrillization of some viral or cellular proteins has been evidenced in viral infections. Recently, semen-derived amyloid fibrils were shown to drastically enhance human immunodeficiency virus infection (53Münch J. Rücker E. Ständker L. Adermann K. Goffinet C. Schindler M. Wildum S. Chinnadurai R. Rajan D. Specht A. Giménez-Gallego G. Sánchez P.C. Fowler D.M. Koulov A. Kelly J.W. Mothes W. Grivel J.C. Margolis L. Keppler O.T. Forssmann W.G. Kirchhoff F. Cell. 2007; 131: 1059-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). This capability is not restricted to retroviruses and suggests a possible role of amyloids in the transmission and pathogenesis of other enveloped viruses (54Wojtowicz W.M. Farzan M. Joyal J.L.

Viral proteins by themselves can also initiate protein aggregation and regulate amyloid formation (55Pulliam L. J. Neuroimmune Pharmacol. 2009; 4: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recent work suggests that highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus or other neurotropic influenza viruses could initiate central nervous system disorders, including Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases (56Jang H. Boltz D. Sturm-Ramirez K. Shepherd K.R. Jiao Y. Webster R. Smeyne R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 14063-14068Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Our observation that PB1-F2 is able to form amyloidal fibers in virus-infected cells may be related to the nervous system disorders observed with influenza neurotropic viruses and opens the way for further studies of the role of PB1-F2 in the pathogenesis of the influenza virus.Overall, our results provide new insights into structural behavior of PB1-F2 able to switch from a disordered state to α-helix and to β-sheet structures in membranes. We demonstrate that PB1-F2 forms amyloid fibers in infected cells, an observation that explains the pathogenicity associated with this protein. These observations open the way for further studies to elucidate the role of PB1-F2 in the influenza virus cycle. IntroductionInfluenza A virus (IAV) 3The abbreviations used are: IAVinfluenza A virusTFEtrifluoroethanolDLSdynamic light scatteringThTthioflavin TThSthioflavin SSPRsurface plasmon resonance. is a major pathogen of humans and animals responsible for three main pandemics of the last century: 1957, 1968, and the most severe in 1918 with 20–40 million deaths reported (1Lamb R.A. Takeda M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1286-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Every year, influenza epidemics cause considerable illness and death. Since 2003, one of the greatest worldwide pandemic threats remains the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian viruses that display a high lethality rate (60% of the 438 cases resulted in death) (2Lipatov A.S. Govorkova E.A. Webby R.J. Ozaki H. Peiris M. Guan Y. Poon L. Webster R.G. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 8951-8959Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 3Gambotto A.

Since its identification in April 2009, a novel swine origin influenza A virus H1N1 is currently causing a pandemic as declared by the WHO in June 2009 (around 1% of the 300,000 cases resulted in death) (4Garten R.J.

IAV belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae viral family, and its genome is composed of eight negative-strand RNA gene segments encoding 11 proteins (5Palese P. Cell. 1977; 10: 1-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The virulence of IAV is complex and can be influenced by each of the eight viral segments and notably the HA, NA, and PB1 segments (6Pappas C. Aguilar P.V. Basler C.F. Solórzano A. Zeng H. Perrone L.A. Palese P. García-Sastre A. Katz J.M. Tumpey T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 3064-3069Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).PB1-F2, the 11th discovered IAV protein, is translated from an alternative reading frame in the PB1 gene (+1 reading frame of PB1, PB1-Frame 2) (7Chen W. Calvo P.A. Malide D. Gibbs J. Schubert U. Bacik I. Basta S. O'Neill R. Schickli J. Palese P. Henklein P. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1306-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). PB1-F2 is expressed by many IAV isolates from a wide range of hosts and in nearly all avian and human strains (8Pancuchárová H. Russ G. Acta Virol. 2006; 50: 269-272PubMed Google Scholar, 9Zell R. Krumbholz A. Wutzler P. Emerg. Infect.

Gen Virol. 2007; 88: 536-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Recent studies have described the influence of PB1-F2 on viral pathogenesis in mouse models (11Zamarin D. Ortigoza M.B. Palese P. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 7976-7983Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 12Conenello G.M. Zamarin D. Perrone L.A. Tumpey T. Palese P.

Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 2: 240-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Loss of PB1-F2 expression results in attenuation of the virus and in a more rapid clearance of the virus from the lungs of infected mice. Insertion of a single N66S mutation present in the PB1-F2 of the 1918 pandemic strain is sufficient to increase virulence of a low pathogenic IAV in mice (12Conenello G.M. Zamarin D. Perrone L.A. Tumpey T. Palese P. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: 1414-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Moreover, a mouse model of secondary Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia following A/PR/834 virus infection shows greater weight loss of infected mice, more severe pneumonia, and a higher lethality with the virus expressing PB1-F2 compared with the PB1-F2 knock-out virus (13Conenello G.M. Palese P. Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 2: 207-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 14McAuley J.L. Hornung F. Boyd K.L. Smith A.M. McKeon R. Bennink J. Yewdell J.W. McCullers J.A. Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 2: 240-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In addition, contemporary H1N1 strains that no longer express PB1-F2 seem to be less virulent. PB1-F2 is considered as one of the factors that contribute to IAV virulence (15Basler C.F. Aguilar P.V. Antiviral Res. 2008; 79: 166-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).Compared with the other IAV proteins, PB1-F2 shows several distinct features. PB1-F2 is expressed differently among infected cells and independently of the expression level of other viral proteins. PB1-F2 has a short half-life and is rapidly degraded (7Chen W. Calvo P.A. Malide D. Gibbs J. Schubert U. Bacik I. Basta S. O'Neill R. Schickli J. Palese P. Henklein P. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1306-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). PB1-F2 is generally described as a proapoptotic factor that could facilitate evasion of host defenses (with NS1), allowing the virus to escape from the immune system by inducing apoptosis in macrophages and monocytes (1Lamb R.A. Takeda M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1286-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 7Chen W. Calvo P.A. Malide D. Gibbs J. Schubert U. Bacik I. Basta S. O'Neill R. Schickli J. Palese P. Henklein P.

Thus, PB1-F2 is thought to compromise the ability of the host to mobilize adaptive immune responses (18Coleman J.R. Virol. J. 2007; 4: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Another specific feature is the mitochondrial tropism of PB1-F2, which is only partial because PB1-F2 can also be present in the nucleus and cytoplasm of infected cells, depending on the cell type (7Chen W. Calvo P.A. Malide D. Gibbs J. Schubert U. Bacik I. Basta S. O'Neill R. Schickli J. Palese P. Henklein P. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1306-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 19Mazur I. Anhlan D. Mitzner D. Wixler L. Schubert U. Ludwig S. Cell Microbiol. 2008; 10: 1140-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal domain of the protein, containing the mitochondrial targeting signal, is capable by itself to interfere with mitochondrial function and cellular viability (20Gibbs J.S. Malide D. Hornung F. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 7214-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 21Yamada H. Chounan R. Higashi Y. Kurihara N. Kido H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 578: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Studies of the interaction of a synthetic form of PB1-F2 with membrane showed that PB1-F2 was able to create pores of variable size in planar lipid membranes, suggesting that PB1-F2 could oligomerize to permeabilize membranes (22Chanturiya A.N. Basañez G. Schubert U. Henklein P. Yewdell J.W. Zimmerberg J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 6304-6312Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). PB1-F2 was also shown to interact with two proteins implicated in the formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore complex, ANT-3 (adenine nucleotide translocator 3), and VDAC-1 (voltage-dependent ion channel 1) (17Zamarin D. García-Sastre A. Xiao X. Wang R. Palese P. PLoS Pathog. 2005; 1: e4Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar).Although new insights have been gained in understanding the function of PB1-F2, very little structural information is available. Bruns and co-workers (23Henklein P. Bruns K. Nimtz M. Wray V. Tessmer U. Schubert U. J. Pept. Sci. 2005; 11: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 24Röder R. Bruns K. Sharma A.

The stability of the structured regions of PB1-F2 was shown to be dependent on the hydrophobicity of the solvent: random coil in aqueous solution and α-helical structure upon the addition of trifluoroethanol (TFE). This α-helical structure present in the positively charged C-terminal domain of PB1-F2 was described as not a true amphipathic helix and is more compact than previously predicted. In an effort to obtain deeper insight into the structure-function of PB1-F2 and to better understand its role in the virus cycle, we produced and compared PB1-F2 originating from seven IAV isolates, including the highly pathogenic strain H5N1, the 1918 Brevig Mission strain, and two apathogenic avian strains, in biochemical and biophysical assays. We showed that PB1-F2 can be classified in the newly described group of intrinsically disordered proteins, capable of conformation changes switching from a random to an α-helical or β-sheet secondary structure. PB1-F2 is able to oligomerize to form amyloid fibers upon different environmental conditions. The presence of amyloid PB1-F2 structures was also evidenced in infected cells. Moreover, functional tests showed that the seven variants of PB1-F2 efficiently permeabilized membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2050036331,"Background The appropriate control of mitotic entry and exit is reliant on a series of interlocking signaling events that coordinately drive the biological processes required for accurate cell division. Overlaid onto these signals that promote orchestrated cell division are checkpoints that ensure appropriate mitotic spindle formation, a lack of DNA damage, kinetochore attachment, and that each daughter cell has the appropriate complement of DNA. We recently discovered that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) modulates the G2/M phase of cell cycle progression in part through its suppression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. AMPK directly phosphorylates the critical mTOR binding partner raptor inhibiting mTORC1 (mTOR-raptor rapamycin sensitive mTOR kinase complex 1). As mTOR has been previously tied to mitotic control, we examined further how raptor may contribute to this process. Methodology/Principal Findings We have discovered that raptor becomes highly phosphorylated in cells in mitosis. Utilizing tandem mass spectrometry, we identified a number of novel phosphorylation sites in raptor, and using phospho-specific antibodies demonstrated that raptor becomes phosphorylated on phospho-serine/threonine-proline sites in mitosis. A combination of site-directed mutagenesis in a tagged raptor cDNA and analysis with a series of new phospho-specific antibodies generated against different sites in raptor revealed that Serine 696 and Threonine 706 represent two key sites in raptor phosphorylated in mitosis. We demonstrate that the mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase cdc2/CDK1 is the kinase responsible for phosphorylating these sites, and its mitotic partner Cyclin B efficiently coimmunoprecipitates with raptor in mitotic cells. Conclusions/Significance This study demonstrates that the key mTOR binding partner raptor is directly phosphorylated during mitosis by cdc2. This reinforces previous studies suggesting that mTOR activity is highly regulated and important for mitotic progression, and points to a direct modulation of the mTORC1 complex during mitosis."

The receptor transduces the hormone binding signals across the membrane to heterotrimeric G proteins. The oligomeric state of the receptor and the stoichiometry of the receptor-G protein complex is a topic of considerable debate (1Fotiadis D. Jastrzebska B. Philippsen A. Müller D.J. Palczewski K.

It often is assumed to be the dimer, although evidence for higher order arrays of receptors also exists (6Fotiadis D. Liang Y. Filipek S. Saperstein D.A. Engel A. Palczewski K.

The most convincing argument for a functional role for oligomerization comes from studies of the class C γ-aminobutyric acid, type B receptor (14White J.H. Wise A. Main M.J. Green A. Fraser N.J.

Nature. 2006; 444: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar), which function as obligate heterodimers. In addition, the class A leukotriene B4 and dopamine D2 receptors have been shown to couple to G protein as dimers (18Banères J.L. Parello J. J. Mol.

These studies suggested that the pentameric complex of a GPCR dimer and a single G protein heterotrimer is the minimal functional signaling unit. However, several rigorous biochemical studies have shown that the β2-adrenergic receptor and rhodopsin, both class A receptors, are capable of functionally coupling to G proteins as monomers (20Whorton M.R. Bokoch M.P. Rasmussen S.G. Huang B. Zare R.N. Kobilka B. Sunahara R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7682-7687Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 21Whorton M.R. Jastrzebska B.

Perhaps the only recurring theme to emerge from these studies is that, whereas GPCRs oligomerize, the receptor domains that mediate oligomerization, the ligand effects on oligomerization, and the functional consequences of oligomerization vary depending on the receptor family or even on the individual subtype of the receptor.

The class B or secretin family GPCRs constitute a small peptide binding family that includes the receptors for secretin, parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, glucagon, corticotropin-releasing factor, and several other clinically important peptides. Several class B GPCRs have been shown to homo-oligomerize, including the secretin receptor (SecR) (12Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. J. Biol.

Comps-Agrar L. Brock C. Rives M.L. Bourrier E. Ayoub M.A. Bazin H. Tinel N. Durroux T. Prézeau L. Trinquet E. Pin J.P. Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar); several of the members can also form hetero-oligomers (29Harikumar K.G. Morfis M.M. Sexton P.M. Miller L.J. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2008; 36: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Class B GPCRs consist of an N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) of roughly 160 amino acids in addition to the 7-TM domain. Ligand binding is characterized by a two-domain model whereby the C-terminal portion of the peptide interacts with the ECD to impart high affinity receptor binding and the N-terminal portion interacts with the 7-TM domain and is responsible for receptor activation (30Hoare S.R. Drug Discov. Today. 2005; 10: 417-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Class B GPCRs primarily signal through the stimulatory Gs protein to increase intracellular cAMP, but activation of other pathways can also occur. Of the class B receptors, SecR oligomerization has been most extensively characterized using bioluminescence (BRET) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) techniques that enable the study of receptor oligomerization in living cells. The SecR forms homodimers (31Harikumar K.G. Happs R.M. Miller L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 2555-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) that are mediated by the lipid-exposed face of transmembrane helix IV (12Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30363-30372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and secretin binding does not affect the dimeric status (9Harikumar K.G. Morfis M.M. Lisenbee C.S. Sexton P.M. Miller L.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Competitive disruption of SecR dimerization by a synthetic helix IV peptide reduced secretin-stimulated cAMP accumulation, suggesting that the dimer activates Gs better than the monomer (12Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30363-30372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It is unclear if the SecR findings will be consistent for other members of the family, but if GPCRs from class A provide any guide, it seems likely that diverse mechanisms of receptor oligomerization will be observed in the class B GPCRs. The parathyroid hormone receptor (PTH1R) is a class B GPCR that mediates the actions of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH-related protein (PTHrP), two peptides that have distinct biological actions (32Gardella T.J. Jüppner H. Rev. Endocr. Metab. Disord. 2000; 1: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 33Jüppner H. Abou-Samra A.B. Freeman M. Kong X.F. Schipani E. Richards J. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Hock J. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Science. 1991; 254: 1024-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar). PTH is an endocrine hormone that is produced by the parathyroid glands and secreted into the circulation in response to low calcium levels; it maintains calcium and phosphate homeostasis by activating PTH1R expressed in bone and kidney tissues (34Potts J.T. Gardella T.J. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2007; 1117: 196-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Sustained elevation of PTH in the circulation restores calcium levels by stimulating catabolic bone resorption and reabsorption of calcium, inhibition of phosphate reabsorption, and synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in the kidneys. Paradoxically, PTH also has anabolic effects on bone via a direct effect on osteoblasts when administered intermittently to osteoporosis patients, providing the basis for its clinical use to treat osteoporosis (35Neer R.M. Arnaud C.D. Zanchetta J.R. Prince R. Gaich G.A. Reginster J.Y. Hodsman A.B. Eriksen E.F. Ish-Shalom S. Genant H.K. Wang O. Mitlak B.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 344: 1434-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (3895) Google Scholar). PTHrP was originally isolated as the factor secreted by various tumors that caused humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (36Suva L.J. Winslow G.A. Wettenhall R.E. Hammonds R.G. Moseley J.M. Diefenbach-Jagger H. Rodda C.P. Kemp B.E. Rodriguez H. Chen E.Y. Science. 1987; 237: 893-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar) and was subsequently shown to be a locally produced paracrine factor that is a critical regulator of bone development (37Karaplis A.C. Luz A. Glowacki J. Bronson R.T. Tybulewicz V.L. Kronenberg H.M. Mulligan R.C. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 277-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar, 38Kronenberg H.M. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2006; 1068: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). PTHrP also has anabolic effects on bone when administered to osteoporosis patients (39Horwitz M.J. Tedesco M.B. Gundberg C. Garcia-Ocana A. Stewart A.F. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 88: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). A detailed structural and mechanistic understanding of the receptor activation and G protein-coupling mechanisms is critical for elucidating how PTH and PTHrP elicit their distinct functions via a common receptor and for aiding the rational development of optimized therapeutics targeting PTH1R. The oligomeric state of PTH1R, the effects of PTH/PTHrP on receptor oligomeric state, and the stoichiometry of the PTH1R-G protein complex remain poorly understood. We previously devised a method that allowed us to purify the PTH1R ECD and to crystallize and determine structures of the ECD bound to synthetic fragments of PTH and PTHrP (40Pioszak A.A. Parker N.R. Gardella T.J. Xu H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 28382-28391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 41Pioszak A.A. Xu H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5034-5039Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). These studies each revealed a monomeric PTH1R ECD in a 1:1 complex with the ligand. Structures of several other class B GPCR ECD-ligand complexes have been reported, and in all cases the complexes are monomeric (42Parthier C. Kleinschmidt M. Neumann P. Rudolph R. Manhart S. Schlenzig D. Fanghänel J. Rahfeld J.U. Demuth H.U. Stubbs M.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 13942-13947Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 43Pioszak A.A. Parker N.R.

Chem. 2008; 283: 11340-11347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Here we present the crystal structure of the PTH1R ECD in the absence of bound ligand. Surprisingly, the ligand-free PTH1R ECD dimerizes by a structural mimicry of endogenous ligand binding mechanism; the ECD C-terminal segment (which connects the ECD core domain to the first transmembrane helix) forms an α-helix that occupies the peptide binding groove of the opposing subunit, mimicking PTH/PTHrP binding. We confirmed ECD-mediated oligomerization of intact PTH1R in living cells by BRET and FRET experiments and we show that, as predicted by the structure, PTH disrupted the oligomerization of PTH1R. Guided by the structure, we made specific amino acid substitutions in the ECD designed to disrupt the dimer, and we show that one of these altered receptors failed to oligomerize but retained wild-type PTH binding and cAMP signaling ability, suggesting that a PTH1R monomer is capable of functionally coupling to Gs. The maltose-binding protein (MBP)-PTH1R ECD-His6 fusion protein, containing residues 29–187 of human PTH1R fused to the C terminus of bacterial MBP, was previously described (41Pioszak A.A. Xu H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5034-5039Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The protein is not glycosylated because it is expressed in Escherichia coli. Peptides were custom-synthesized and high performance liquid chromatography-purified by SynBioSci (Livermore, CA). MBP-PTH1R ECD-H6 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm maltose, and 1 mm EDTA was spin-concentrated to 18.7 mg/ml (about 310 μm) for crystallization. Rectangular, rod-shaped crystals were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C with drops containing equal volumes of the protein sample and a reservoir solution of 2 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m sodium HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm sodium acetate, 2% polyethylene glycol 400, and 3% cadaverine dihydrochloride. The crystals were transferred into a cryoprotectant solution of 3 m sodium malonate, pH 7.0, 0.1 m ammonium sulfate, 2% polyethylene glycol 400, and 0.7% cadaverine dihydrochloride by quick soak and then were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. A data set was collected from a single crystal at LS-CAT beamline 21-ID-F of the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne, IL) at a wavelength of 0.9785 Å and a temperature of 100 K. The HKL2000 package (45Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38572) Google Scholar) was used to process the data, and the Scalepack intensities were converted to structure factor amplitudes with the CCP4 suite (46(1994) Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr., 50, 760–763Google Scholar). The structure was solved by molecular replacement with Phaser (47McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14559) Google Scholar) using separate search models for MBP and the PTH1R ECD from PDB coordinate file 3C4M (41Pioszak A.A. Xu H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 5034-5039Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). There are two MBP-PTH1R ECD molecules in the asymmetric unit that compose the dimer. Manual rebuilding in O (48Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr.

TLS refinement (50Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol.

Structure validation with Procheck (51Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl.

The data collection and refinement statistics are listed in Table 1. Analysis of solvent-accessible surface area was performed within the CCP4 suite.

Open table in a new tab The expression plasmids were constructed starting with a pcDNA3.1 plasmid encoding human PTH1R obtained from the Missouri S&T cDNA Resource Center. PTH1R constructs fused in-frame at their C terminus with Rlu, YFP, or CFP were prepared by cloning the respective Rlu, YFP, or CFP fragment into the Nhe1/Xba1 restriction sites before the TGA stop codon. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a QuikChange kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All constructs were verified by automated DNA sequencing. COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. For transient transfections, 500,000 cells were seeded in a 10-cm dish and transfected the following morning by the DEAE-dextran method with 3 μg of the indicated PTH1R expression construct. Bioluminescence and fluorescence measurements were performed with ∼25,000 receptor-bearing COS cells in suspension as described previously (12Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30363-30372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In brief, 48 h after transfection, the receptor-bearing COS cells were lifted using nonenzymatic cell dissociation solution (Sigma) and washed with Krebs-Ringers-HEPES buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 104 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4) before the assay. The BRET assay was started by adding 5 μm coelenterazine h, the cell-permeant Renilla luciferase-specific substrate, to the cell suspension in a 96-well white Optiplate. The BRET signal was acquired by using the dedicated BRET protocol (emission filter sets for luminescence (460 nm, bandwidth 25 nm) and for fluorescence (535 nm, bandwidth 25 nm) with a mirror (<700 nm)) in the 2103 Envision fluorescence plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The BRET ratio was calculated based on the ratio of emission as described previously (12Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30363-30372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For saturation BRET assays, COS cells were transiently co-transfected with a fixed amount of Rlu-tagged wild-type or mutant receptor constructs (1.0 μg DNA/dish) and with increasing amounts of YFP-tagged wild-type or mutant receptor constructs (0.3–6 μg of DNA/dish). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were detached using cell dissociation medium and were used in BRET assays, as described above. Curves were fit to these data and evaluated for quality of fit based on R2 values using Prism 3.0. FRET microscopy was performed as described previously (12Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30363-30372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). COS cells were transfected with CFP- and YFP-tagged PTH1 receptor constructs. Imaging was performed with an Axiovert 200M inverted epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) equipped with fixed filter sets for CFP (excitation, 436/20 nm; dichroic mirror, 455 dichroic long pass; emission, 480/40 nm), YFP (excitation, 500/20 nm; dichroic mirror, 515 dichroic long pass; emission, 535/30 nm), and FRET (excitation, 436/20 nm; dichroic mirror, 455 dichroic long pass; emission, 535/30 nm) (Chroma Technology Corp., Brattleboro, VT). Images were collected after fixed-length exposures with an ORCA-12ER CCD camera (Hamamatsu, Bridgewater, NJ) and QED-InVivo 2.039 software (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Silver Springs, MD). The FRET analysis was performed using the sensitized emission method in Metamorph Version 6.32 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) after correcting for donor and acceptor bleed-through into the FRET channel, as described previously (12Harikumar K.G. Pinon D.I. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30363-30372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Publication images were prepared using Adobe Photoshop Version 7.0 (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA). Approximately 50,000 transfected cells were seeded in each well of a 24-well plate 24 h post-transfection. At 72 h post-transfection the cells were rinsed twice with binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated horse serum, 0.5% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor). 125I-[Nle8,18,Tyr34]hPTH-(1–34)OH (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to ∼20,000 cpm per well (∼20 pm) in the absence or presence of varying amounts of PTH-(1–34)NH2 competitor in binding buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The binding mixture was removed by aspiration, and the cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold binding buffer and then lysed with 0.5 ml of 0.5 m NaOH. Radioactivity in the cell lysates was quantified by liquid scintillation counting in UltimaGold mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with a Microbeta Trilux LSC. Curve-fitting was performed with Prism 5.0 software (Graph Pad Software, San Diego, CA) using a one-site competitive binding equation to fit the log IC50. Bound radioactivity was typically less than 10% of the total counts added. Approximately 40,000 transfected cells were seeded in each well of a 96-well plate 24 h post-transfection. At 48 h post-transfection the cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and stimulated for 30 min at 37 °C with PTH-(1–34)NH2 in Krebs-Ringers-HEPES buffer supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% soybean trypsin inhibitor, 0.1% bacitracin, and 2 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. The reactions were stopped with ice-cold 6% perchloric acid, and the cell lysates were neutralized with KHCO3. cAMP was measured with a LANCE cAMP kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Curve-fitting was performed with Prism 5.0 software using a fixed-slope dose-response stimulation equation. The human PTH1R ECD (residues 29–187) was prepared as a fusion protein with an N-terminal MBP tag and a C-terminal His6 tag. The fusion protein was crystallized in the absence of ligand in the C2221 space group, and the structure was solved by molecular replacement and refined to a Rwork value of 22.5% (Rfree of 25.8%) at 3.24 Å resolution (Table 1). The crystallographic refinement was aided by the availability of the high resolution MBP and PTH1R ECD models used for molecular replacement. The low B-factors (Table 1) and excellent Ramachandran plot statistics (“Experimental Procedures”) attest to the high quality of the refined model. Surprisingly, the structure revealed an ECD dimer in which the C-terminal segment (residues 173–187) forms an α-helix (α2) that occupies the peptide binding site of the opposing subunit (Fig. 1A). In our previous structures of the ECD in complex with PTH or PTHrP, the ECD was monomeric, and residues 176–187 were disordered (40Pioszak A.A. Parker N.R. Gardella T.J. Xu H.E. J. Biol.

In the current ligand-free structure, clear electron density was observed for the C-terminal α-helix and the first two residues of the His6 tag (Fig."
https://openalex.org/W2077685873,"Background Therapeutic approaches to preserve fertility in females undergoing cancer treatments are currently ineffective. This is partly due to limited knowledge of the molecular mechanisms that injured germ cells elicit to repair damage and survive or to abort repair and activate biochemical pathways leading to death. So far, we know that following spontaneously occurring or drug-induced DNA damage, the efficiency of DNA repair is a critical determinant of the cell's fate. The protein encoded by the Rad51 gene is one of several components recruited for homologous recombination-dependent DNA double-strand break repair in both somatic cells and germ cells. Recently, we showed that microinjection of recombinant Rad51 into AKR/J mouse oocytes decreased the extent of spontaneous DNA double-strand breaks, suppressed apoptosis, and restored the developmental competence in AKR/J embryos. Herein we characterized the nature of chemotherapy-induced lesions in oocytes, and the associated individual components of the DNA damage sensor and repair apparatus. For comparison, we also assessed parallel spontaneous changes in aging oocytes. Methods Data collected were derived from: analysis of apoptosis; immunodepletion; oocyte microinjections; immunocytochemistry; immunofluorescence; and CHIP-like assays. Results Our data show that: (i) DNA damage in oocytes can be induced by both chemotherapy and spontaneously by the aging process; (ii) oocytes possess the machinery and capability for repairing such DNA damage; (iii) Rad51 is a critical player in the repair of both chemotherapy-induced and spontaneously-sustained DNA damage; and (iv) in response to damage, oocytes exhibit an inverse functional relationship between presence of Bax and activity of Rad51. Conclusion/Significance Our results establish Rad51 and/or Bax as potential candidates that can be targeted for development of individualized chemotherapeutic interventions that are effective, but minimal in toxicity. The use of Rad51 and Bax modulating compounds could offer women the opportunity to maintain fully functional germ cells despite cancer treatments or aging."
https://openalex.org/W2066966127,"The holotype of the theropod non-avian dinosaur Microraptor gui from the Early Cretaceous of China shows extensive preservation of feathers in a halo around the body and with flight feathers associated with both the fore and hindlimbs. It has been questioned as to whether or not the feathers did extend into the halo to reach the body, or had disassociated and moved before preservation. This taxon has important implications for the origin of flight in birds and the possibility of a four-winged gliding phase.Examination of the specimen under ultraviolet light reveals that these feathers actually reach the body of the animal and were not disassociated from the bones. Instead they may have been chemically altered by the body tissues of the animal meaning that they did not carbonise close into the animal or more likely were covered by other decaying tissue, though evidence of their presence remains.These UV images show that the feathers preserved on the slab are genuinely associated with the skeleton and that their arrangement and orientation is likely correct. The methods used here to reveal hidden features of the specimen may be applicable to other specimens from the fossil beds of Liaoning that produced Microraptor."
https://openalex.org/W2127910910,"The most rapidly expanding habitat globally is the urban habitat, yet the origin and life histories of the populations of native species that inhabit this habitat remain poorly understood. We use DNA barcoding of the COI gene in the widespread native pest ant Tapinoma sessile to test two hypotheses regarding the origin of urban populations and traits associated with their success. First, we determine if urban samples of T. sessile have a single origin from natural populations by looking at patterns of haplotype clustering from across their range. Second, we examine whether polygynous colony structure--a trait associated with invasion success--is correlated with urban environments, by studying the lineage dependence of colony structure. Our phylogenetic analysis of 49 samples identified four well supported geographic clades. Within clades, Kimura-2 parameter pairwise genetic distances revealed <2.3% variation; however, between clade genetic distances were 7.5-10.0%, suggesting the possibility of the presence of cryptic species. Our results indicate that T. sessile has successfully colonized urban environments multiple times. Additionally, polygynous colony structure is a highly plastic trait across habitat, clade, and haplotype. In short, T. sessile has colonized urban habitats repeatedly and appears to do so using life history strategies already present in more natural populations. Whether similar results hold for other species found in urban habitats has scarcely begun to be considered."
https://openalex.org/W1978106259,"Initially detected in leukocytes and cancer cells derived from solid tissues, L-plastin/fimbrin belongs to a large family of actin crosslinkers and is considered as a marker for many cancers. Phosphorylation of L-plastin on residue Ser5 increases its F-actin binding activity and is required for L-plastin-mediated cell invasion.To study the kinetics of L-plastin and the impact of L-plastin Ser5 phosphorylation on L-plastin dynamics and actin turn-over in live cells, simian Vero cells were transfected with GFP-coupled WT-L-plastin, Ser5 substitution variants (S5/A, S5/E) or actin and analyzed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). FRAP data were explored by mathematical modeling to estimate steady-state reaction parameters. We demonstrate that in Vero cell focal adhesions L-plastin undergoes rapid cycles of association/dissociation following a two-binding-state model. Phosphorylation of L-plastin increased its association rates by two-fold, whereas dissociation rates were unaffected. Importantly, L-plastin affected actin turn-over by decreasing the actin dissociation rate by four-fold, increasing thereby the amount of F-actin in the focal adhesions, all these effects being promoted by Ser5 phosphorylation. In MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment induced L-plastin translocation to de novo actin polymerization sites in ruffling membranes and spike-like structures and highly increased its Ser5 phosphorylation. Both inhibition studies and siRNA knock-down of PKC isozymes pointed to the involvement of the novel PKC-delta isozyme in the PMA-elicited signaling pathway leading to L-plastin Ser5 phosphorylation. Furthermore, the L-plastin contribution to actin dynamics regulation was substantiated by its association with a protein complex comprising cortactin, which is known to be involved in this process.Altogether these findings quantitatively demonstrate for the first time that L-plastin contributes to the fine-tuning of actin turn-over, an activity which is regulated by Ser5 phosphorylation promoting its high affinity binding to the cytoskeleton. In carcinoma cells, PKC-delta signaling pathways appear to link L-plastin phosphorylation to actin polymerization and invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2037544215,"Human genetic variation is the incarnation of diverse evolutionary history, which reflects both selectively advantageous and selectively neutral change. In this study, we catalogue structural and functional features of proteins that restrain genetic variation leading to single amino acid substitutions. Our variation dataset is divided into three categories: i) Mendelian disease-related variants, ii) neutral polymorphisms and iii) cancer somatic mutations. We characterize structural environments of the amino acid variants by the following properties: i) side-chain solvent accessibility, ii) main-chain secondary structure, and iii) hydrogen bonds from a side chain to a main chain or other side chains. To address functional restraints, amino acid substitutions in proteins are examined to see whether they are located at functionally important sites involved in protein-protein interactions, protein-ligand interactions or catalytic activity of enzymes. We also measure the likelihood of amino acid substitutions and the degree of residue conservation where variants occur. We show that various types of variants are under different degrees of structural and functional restraints, which affect their occurrence in human proteome."
https://openalex.org/W1972252928,"Previous findings support the concept that IL-9 may play a significant role in mediating both pro-inflammatory and changes in airway responsiveness that characterizes the atopic asthmatic state. We previously demonstrated that human airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells express a functional IL-9R that mediate CCL11 expression. However, the signaling pathway governing this effect is not well understood.In this study, we showed that IL-9 mediated CCL11 expression in ASM cells does not rely on STAT6 or STAT5 but on STAT3 pathway. IL-9 induced rapid STAT3 activation in primary ASM cells that was not observed in case of STAT6 or STAT5. STAT3 binding to CCL11 promoter was also observed in vivo upon IL-9 stimulation of ASM cells. Disruption of STAT3 activity with SH2 domain binding inhibitory peptide results in significant reduction of IL-9 mediated CCL11 promoter activity. DN STAT3beta over-expression in ASM cells, but not Ser 727 STAT3 or STAT6 DN, abolishes IL-9 mediated CCL11 promoter activity. Finally, STAT3 but not STAT6 silenced ASM cells showed significant reduction in IL-9 mediated CCL11 promoter activity and mRNA expression.Taken together, our results indicate that IL-9 mediated CCL11 via STAT3 signalling pathway may play a crucial role in airway inflammatory responses."
https://openalex.org/W2081211841,"Entecavir (ETV) is a deoxyguanosine analog competitive inhibitor of hepatitis B virus (HBV) polymerase that exhibits delayed chain termination of HBV DNA. A high barrier to entecavir-resistance (ETVr) is observed clinically, likely due to its potency and a requirement for multiple resistance changes to overcome suppression. Changes in the HBV polymerase reverse-transcriptase (RT) domain involve lamivudine-resistance (LVDr) substitutions in the conserved YMDD motif (M204V/I +/- L180M), plus an additional ETV-specific change at residues T184, S202 or M250. These substitutions surround the putative dNTP binding site or primer grip regions of the HBV RT.To determine the mechanistic basis for ETVr, wildtype, lamivudine-resistant (M204V, L180M) and ETVr HBVs were studied using in vitro RT enzyme and cell culture assays, as well as molecular modeling. Resistance substitutions significantly reduced ETV incorporation and chain termination in HBV DNA and increased the ETV-TP inhibition constant (K(i)) for HBV RT. Resistant HBVs exhibited impaired replication in culture and reduced enzyme activity (k(cat)) in vitro. Molecular modeling of the HBV RT suggested that ETVr residue T184 was adjacent to and stabilized S202 within the LVDr YMDD loop. ETVr arose through steric changes at T184 or S202 or by disruption of hydrogen-bonding between the two, both of which repositioned the loop and reduced the ETV-triphosphate (ETV-TP) binding pocket. In contrast to T184 and S202 changes, ETVr at primer grip residue M250 was observed during RNA-directed DNA synthesis only. Experimentally, M250 changes also impacted the dNTP-binding site. Modeling suggested a novel mechanism for M250 resistance, whereby repositioning of the primer-template component of the dNTP-binding site shifted the ETV-TP binding pocket. No structural data are available to confirm the HBV RT modeling, however, results were consistent with phenotypic analysis of comprehensive substitutions of each ETVr position.Altogether, ETVr occurred through exclusion of ETV-TP from the dNTP-binding site, through different, novel mechanisms that involved lamivudine-resistance, ETV-specific substitutions, and the primer-template."
https://openalex.org/W2070142310,"Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs (ribonucleic acids) that regulate translation. Several miRNAs have been shown to be altered in whole cancer tissue compared to normal tissue when quantified by microarray. Based on previous such evidence of differential expression, we chose to study the functional significance of miRNAs miR-30a and -191 alterations in human lung cancer. Methodology/Principal Findings The functional significance of miRNAs miR-30a and -191 was studied by creating stable transfectants of the lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 and the immortalized bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B with modest overexpression of miR-30a or -191 using a lentiviral system. When compared to the corresponding controls, both cell lines overexpressing miR-30a or -191 do not demonstrate any significant changes in cell cycle distribution, cell proliferation, adherent colony formation, soft agar colony formation, xenograft formation in a subcutaneous SCID mouse model, and drug sensitivity to doxorubicin and cisplatin. There is a modest increase in cell migration in cell lines overexpressing miR-30a compared to their controls. Conclusions/Significance Overexpression of miR-30a or -191 does not lead to an alteration in cell cycle, proliferation, xenograft formation, and chemosensitivity of A549 and BEAS-2B cell lines. Using microarray data from whole tumors to select specific miRNAs for functional study may be a suboptimal strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2010518744,"In the fly Drosophila melanogaster, neuronal plasticity of synaptic terminals in the first optic neuropil, or lamina, depends on early visual experience within a critical period after eclosion [1]. The current study revealed two additional and parallel mechanisms involved in this type of synaptic terminal plasticity. First, an endogenous circadian rhythm causes daily oscillations in the volume of photoreceptor cell terminals. Second, daily visual experience precisely modulates the circadian time course and amplitude of the volume oscillations that the photoreceptor-cell terminals undergo. Both mechanisms are separable in their molecular basis. We suggest that the described neuronal plasticity in Drosophila ensures continuous optimal performance of the visual system over the course of a 24 h-day. Moreover, the sensory system of Drosophila cannot only account for predictable, but also for acute, environmental changes. The volumetric changes in the synaptic terminals of photoreceptor cells are accompanied by circadian and light-induced changes of presynaptic ribbons as well as extensions of epithelial glial cells into the photoreceptor terminals, suggesting that the architecture of the lamina is altered by both visual exposure and the circadian clock. Clock-mutant analysis and the rescue of PER protein rhythmicity exclusively in all R1-6 cells revealed that photoreceptor-cell plasticity is autonomous and sufficient to control visual behavior. The strength of a visually guided behavior, the optomotor turning response, co-varies with synaptic-terminal volume oscillations of photoreceptor cells when elicited at low light levels. Our results show that behaviorally relevant adaptive processing of visual information is performed, in part, at the level of visual input level."
https://openalex.org/W2053435596,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), a dreaded pathogen, has a unique cell envelope composed of high fatty acid content that plays a crucial role in its pathogenesis. Acetyl Coenzyme A Carboxylase (ACC), an important enzyme that catalyzes the first reaction of fatty acid biosynthesis, is biotinylated by biotin acetyl-CoA carboxylase ligase (BirA). The ligand-binding loops in all known apo BirAs to date are disordered and attain an ordered structure only after undergoing a conformational change upon ligand-binding. Here, we report that dehydration of Mtb-BirA crystals traps both the apo and active conformations in its asymmetric unit, and for the first time provides structural evidence of such transformation. Recombinant Mtb-BirA was crystallized at room temperature, and diffraction data was collected at 295 K as well as at 120 K. Transfer of crystals to paraffin and paratone-N oil (cryoprotectants) prior to flash-freezing induced lattice shrinkage and enhancement in the resolution of the X-ray diffraction data. Intriguingly, the crystal lattice rearrangement due to shrinkage in the dehydrated Mtb-BirA crystals ensued structural order of otherwise flexible ligand-binding loops L4 and L8 in apo BirA. In addition, crystal dehydration resulted in a shift of ∼3.5 Å in the flexible loop L6, a proline-rich loop unique to Mtb complex as well as around the L11 region. The shift in loop L11 in the C-terminal domain on dehydration emulates the action responsible for the complex formation with its protein ligand biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) domain of ACCA3. This is contrary to the involvement of loop L14 observed in Pyrococcus horikoshii BirA-BCCP complex. Another interesting feature that emerges from this dehydrated structure is that the two subunits A and B, though related by a noncrystallographic twofold symmetry, assemble into an asymmetric dimer representing the ligand-bound and ligand-free states of the protein, respectively. In-depth analyses of the sequence and the structure also provide answers to the reported lower affinities of Mtb-BirA toward ATP and biotin substrates. This dehydrated crystal structure not only provides key leads to the understanding of the structure/function relationships in the protein in the absence of any ligand-bound structure, but also demonstrates the merit of dehydration of crystals as an inimitable technique to have a glance at proteins in action."
https://openalex.org/W2077727437,"Kaiso is a BTB/POZ zinc finger protein known as a transcriptional repressor. It was originally identified through its in vitro association with the Armadillo protein p120ctn. Subcellular localization of Kaiso in cell lines and in normal and cancerous human tissues revealed that its expression is not restricted to the nucleus. In the present study we monitored Kaiso's subcellular localization during the cell cycle and found the following: (1) during interphase, Kaiso is located not only in the nucleus, but also on microtubular structures, including the centrosome; (2) at metaphase, it is present at the centrosomes and on the spindle microtubules; (3) during telophase, it accumulates at the midbody. We found that Kaiso is a genuine PCM component that belongs to a pericentrin molecular complex. We analyzed the functions of different domains of Kaiso by visualizing the subcellular distribution of GFP-tagged Kaiso fragments throughout the cell cycle. Our results indicate that two domains are responsible for targeting Kaiso to the centrosomes and microtubules. The first domain, designated SA1 for spindle-associated domain 1, is located in the center of the Kaiso protein and localizes at the spindle microtubules and centrosomes; the second domain, SA2, is an evolutionarily conserved domain situated just before the zinc finger domain and might be responsible for localizing Kaiso towards the centrosomal region. Constructs containing both SA domains and Kaiso's aminoterminal BTB/POZ domain triggered the formation of abnormal centrosomes. We also observed that overexpression of longer or full-length Kaiso constructs led to mitotic cell arrest and frequent cell death. Knockdown of Kaiso accelerated cell proliferation. Our data reveal a new target for Kaiso at the centrosomes and spindle microtubules during mitosis. They also strongly imply that Kaiso's function as a transcriptional regulator might be linked to the control of the cell cycle and to cell proliferation in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2001081139,"Human concentrative nucleoside transporter-3 (hCNT3) is a sodium-coupled nucleoside transporter that exhibits high affinity and broad substrate selectivity, making it the most suitable candidate for mediating the uptake and cytotoxic action of most nucleoside-derived drugs. The drug of this class most commonly used in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the pro-apoptotic nucleoside analog fludarabine (Flu), which enters CLL cells primarily through human equilibrative nucleoside transporters (hENTs). Although CLL cells lack hCNT3 activity, they do express this transporter protein, which is located mostly in the cytosol. The aim of our study was to identify agents and mechanisms capable of promoting hCNT3 trafficking to the plasma membrane. Here, we report that all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), currently used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), increases hCNT3-related activity through a mechanism that involves trafficking of pre-existing hCNT3 proteins to the plasma membrane. This effect is mediated by the autocrine action of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, which is transcriptionally activated by ATRA in a p38-dependent manner. TGF-beta1 acts through activation of ERK1/2 and the small GTPase RhoA to promote plasma membrane trafficking of the hCNT3 protein."
https://openalex.org/W2012043851,"The Type III secretion system (TTSS) is a protein secretion machinery used by certain gram-negative bacterial pathogens of plants and animals to deliver effector molecules to the host and is at the core of the ability to cause disease. Extensive molecular and biochemical study has revealed the components and their interactions within this system but reductive approaches do not consider the dynamical properties of the system as a whole. In order to gain a better understanding of these dynamical behaviours and to create a basis for the refinement of the experimentally derived knowledge we created a Boolean model of the regulatory interactions within the hrp regulon of Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato strain DC3000 Pseudomonas syringae. We compared simulations of the model with experimental data and found them to be largely in accordance, though the hrpV node shows some differences in state changes to that expected. Our simulations also revealed interesting dynamical properties not previously predicted. The model predicts that the hrp regulon is a biologically stable two-state system, with each of the stable states being strongly attractive, a feature indicative of selection for a tightly regulated and responsive system. The model predicts that the state of the GacS/GacA node confers control, a prediction that is consistent with experimental observations that the protein has a role as master regulator. Simulated gene ""knock out"" experiments with the model predict that HrpL is a central information processing point within the network."
https://openalex.org/W1966361844,"Background Human promoter polymorphisms in the chemokine co-receptor 5 gene (CCR5) have been noted for association with mother-to-child transmission of HIV (HIV MTCT) as well as reduced receptor expression in vitro, but have not been clearly associated with CCR5 expression in vivo. Placental expression of CCR5 may be influenced by such polymorphisms as well as other in vivo regulatory factors. Methodology/Principal Findings We evaluated the associations between infant CCR5 polymorphisms, measures of maternal infection, and placental expression of CCR5 among mother-infant pairs in Blantyre, Malawi. RNA was extracted from placental tissue and used in multiplex real-time PCR to quantify gene expression. Through linear regression, we observed that CCR5-2554T (β = −0.67, 95% CI = −1.23, −0.11) and -2132T (β = −0.75, 95% CI = −0.131, −0.18) were significantly associated with reduced placental expression of CCR5. An incremental increase in CCR5 expression was observed for incremental increases in expression of two heparan sulfate genes involved in viral infection, HS3ST3A1 (β = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.18, 0.35) and HS3ST3B1 (β = 0.11, 95% CI = 0.06, 0.18). Among HIV infected mothers, an incremental increase in maternal HIV viral load was also associated with higher CCR5 expression (β = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.12, 1.39). Maternal HIV status had no overall effect (β = 0.072, 95% CI = −0.57, −0.72). Higher CCR5 expression was observed for mothers with malaria but was not statistically significant (β = 0.37, 95% CI = −0.43, 1.18). Conclusions/Significance These results provide in vivo evidence for genetic and environmental factors involved in the regulation of CCR5 expression in the placenta. Our findings also suggest that the measurement of placental expression of CCR5 alone is not an adequate indicator of the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV."
https://openalex.org/W1966447531,"The present study explored the effect of speaker prosody on the representation of words in memory. To this end, participants were presented with a series of words and asked to remember the words for a subsequent recognition test. During study, words were presented auditorily with an emotional or neutral prosody, whereas during test, words were presented visually. Recognition performance was comparable for words studied with emotional and neutral prosody. However, subsequent valence ratings indicated that study prosody changed the affective representation of words in memory. Compared to words with neutral prosody, words with sad prosody were later rated as more negative and words with happy prosody were later rated as more positive. Interestingly, the participants' ability to remember study prosody failed to predict this effect, suggesting that changes in word valence were implicit and associated with initial word processing rather than word retrieval. Taken together these results identify a mechanism by which speakers can have sustained effects on listener attitudes towards word referents."
https://openalex.org/W2063325659,"Exposure to bright light such as sunlight elicits a sneeze or prickling sensation in about one of every four individuals. This study presents the first scientific examination of this phenomenon, called 'the photic sneeze reflex'.In the present experiment, 'photic sneezers' and controls were exposed to a standard checkerboard stimulus (block 1) and bright flashing lights (block 2) while their EEG (electro-encephalogram) was recorded. Remarkably, we found a generally enhanced excitability of the visual cortex (mainly in the cuneus) to visual stimuli in 'photic sneezers' compared with control subjects. In addition, a stronger prickling sensation in the nose of photic sneezers was found to be associated with activation in the insula and stronger activation in the secondary somatosensory cortex.We propose that the photic sneeze phenomenon might be the consequence of higher sensitivity to visual stimuli in the visual cortex and of co-activation of somatosensory areas. The 'photic sneeze reflex' is therefore not a classical reflex that occurs only at a brainstem or spinal cord level but, in stark contrast to many theories, involves also specific cortical areas."
https://openalex.org/W2087897421,"Platelet-activating factor (PAF) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of sepsis, and the level of plasma PAF acetylhydrolase (pPAF-AH), which inactivates PAF, decreases in sepsis patients except for the sepsis caused by severe leptospirosis. Usually, increase of pPAF-AH activity was observed in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced Syrian hamster and rat sepsis models, while contradictory effects were reported for mouse model in different studies. Here, we demonstrated the in vivo effects of LPS upon the change of pPAF-AH activity in C57BL/6 mice and Mongolian gerbils. After LPS-treatment, the clinical manifestations of Mongolian gerbil model were apparently similar to that of C57BL/6 mouse sepsis model. The pPAF-AH activity increased in C57BL/6 mice after LPS induction, but decreased in Mongolian gerbils, which was similar to that of the human sepsis. It thus suggests that among the LPS-induced rodent sepsis models, only Mongolian gerbil could be used for the study of pPAF-AH related to the pathogenesis of human sepsis. Proper application of this model might enable people to clarify the underline mechanism accounted for the contradictory results between the phase II and phase III clinical trials for the administration of recombinant human pPAF-AH in the sepsis therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2010219856,"Successful object manipulation relies on the ability to form and retrieve sensorimotor memories of digit forces and positions used in previous object lifts. Past studies of patients affected by Parkinson's disease (PD) have revealed that the basal ganglia play a crucial role in the acquisition and/or retrieval of sensorimotor memories for grasp control. Whereas it is known that PD impairs anticipatory control of digit forces during grasp, learning deficits associated with the planning of digit placement have yet to be explored. This question is motivated by recent work in healthy subjects revealing that anticipatory control of digit placement plays a crucial role for successful manipulation.We asked ten PD patients off medication and ten age-matched controls to reach, grasp and lift an object whose center of mass (CM) was on the left, right or center. The only task requirement was to minimize object roll during lift. The CM remained the same across consecutive trials (blocked condition) or was altered from trial to trial (random condition). We hypothesized that impairment of the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits in PD patients would reduce their ability to anticipate digit placement appropriate to the CM location. Consequently, we predicted that PD patients would exhibit similar digit placement in the blocked vs. random conditions and produce larger peak object rolls than that of control subjects. In the blocked condition, PD patients exhibited significantly weaker modulation of fingertip contact points to CM location and larger object roll than controls (p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively). Nevertheless, both controls and PD patients minimized object roll more in the blocked than in the random condition (p<0.01).Our findings indicate that, even though PD patients may have a residual ability of anticipatory control of digit contact points and forces, they fail to implement a motor plan with the same degree of effectiveness as controls. We conclude that intact basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits are necessary for successful sensorimotor learning of both grasp kinematics and kinetics required for dexterous hand-object interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2082518038,"Background We test whether the phenotypic variance of symbionts (Symbiodinium) in corals is closely related with the capacity of corals to acclimatize to increasing seawater temperatures. Moreover, we assess whether more specialist symbionts will increase within coral hosts under ocean warming. The present study is only applicable to those corals that naturally have the capacity to support more than one type of Symbiodinium within the lifetime of a colony; for example, Montastraea annularis and Montastraea faveolata. Methodology/Principal Findings The population dynamics of competing Symbiodinium symbiont populations were projected through time in coral hosts using a novel, discrete time optimal–resource model. Models were run for two Atlantic Ocean localities. Four symbiont populations, with different environmental optima and phenotypic variances, were modeled to grow, divide, and compete in the corals under seasonal fluctuations in solar insolation and seawater temperature. Elevated seawater temperatures were input into the model 1.5°C above the seasonal summer average, and the symbiont population response was observed for each location. The models showed dynamic fluctuations in Symbiodinium populations densities within corals. Population density predictions for Lee Stocking Island, the Bahamas, where temperatures were relatively homogenous throughout the year, showed a dominance of both type 2, with high phenotypic variance, and type 1, a high-temperature and high-insolation specialist. Whereas the densities of Symbiodinium types 3 and 4, a high-temperature, low-insolation specialist, and a high-temperature, low-insolation generalist, remained consistently low. Predictions for Key Largo, Florida, where environmental conditions were more seasonally variable, showed the coexistence of generalists (types 2 and 4) and low densities of specialists (types 1 and 3). When elevated temperatures were input into the model, population densities in corals at Lee Stocking Island showed an emergence of high-temperature specialists. However, even under high temperatures, corals in the Florida Keys were dominated by generalists. Conclusions/Significance Predictions at higher seawater temperatures showed endogenous shuffling and an emergence of the high-temperature Symbiodinium specialists, even though their phenotypic variance was low. The model shows that sustaining these “hidden” specialists becomes advantageous under thermal stress conditions, and shuffling symbionts may increase the corals' capacity to acclimatize but not adapt to climatechange–induced ocean warming."
