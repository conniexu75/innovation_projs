https://openalex.org/W3000145087,"Arrestin proteins bind to active, phosphorylated G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), thereby preventing G-protein coupling, triggering receptor internalization and affecting various downstream signalling pathways1,2. Although there is a wealth of structural information detailing the interactions between GPCRs and G proteins, less is known about how arrestins engage GPCRs. Here we report a cryo-electron microscopy structure of full-length human neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1) in complex with truncated human β-arrestin 1 (βarr1(ΔCT)). We find that phosphorylation of NTSR1 is critical for the formation of a stable complex with βarr1(ΔCT), and identify phosphorylated sites in both the third intracellular loop and the C terminus that may promote this interaction. In addition, we observe a phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate molecule forming a bridge between the membrane side of NTSR1 transmembrane segments 1 and 4 and the C-lobe of arrestin. Compared with a structure of a rhodopsin-arrestin-1 complex, in our structure arrestin is rotated by approximately 85° relative to the receptor. These findings highlight both conserved aspects and plasticity among arrestin-receptor interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2999487242,"After activation by an agonist, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) recruit β-arrestin, which desensitizes heterotrimeric G-protein signalling and promotes receptor endocytosis1. Additionally, β-arrestin directly regulates many cell signalling pathways that can induce cellular responses distinct from that of G proteins2. In contrast to G proteins, for which there are many high-resolution structures in complex with GPCRs, the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction of β-arrestin with GPCRs are much less understood. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy structure of β-arrestin 1 (βarr1) in complex with M2 muscarinic receptor (M2R) reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs. The M2R–βarr1 complex displays a multimodal network of flexible interactions, including binding of the N domain of βarr1 to phosphorylated receptor residues and insertion of the finger loop of βarr1 into the M2R seven-transmembrane bundle, which adopts a conformation similar to that in the M2R–heterotrimeric Go protein complex3. Moreover, the cryo-electron microscopy map reveals that the C-edge of βarr1 engages the lipid bilayer. Through atomistic simulations and biophysical, biochemical and cellular assays, we show that the C-edge is critical for stable complex formation, βarr1 recruitment, receptor internalization, and desensitization of G-protein activation. Taken together, these data suggest that the cooperative interactions of β-arrestin with both the receptor and the phospholipid bilayer contribute to its functional versatility. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of β-arrestin 1 in complex with the M2 muscarinic receptor reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs is reported."
https://openalex.org/W2999084078,"Neurodegeneration is a major age-related pathology. Cognitive decline is characteristic of patients with Alzheimer’s and related dementias and cancer patients after chemo- or radio-therapies. A recently emerged driver of these and other age-related pathologies is cellular senescence, a cell fate that entails a permanent cell cycle arrest and pro-inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Although there is a link between inflammation and neurodegenerative diseases, there are many open questions regarding how cellular senescence affects neurodegenerative pathologies. Among the various cell types in the brain, astrocytes are the most abundant. Astrocytes have proliferative capacity and are essential for neuron survival. Here, we investigated the phenotype of primary human astrocytes made senescent by X-irradiation, and identified genes encoding glutamate and potassium transporters as specifically downregulated upon senescence. This down regulation led to neuronal cell death in co-culture assays. Unbiased RNA sequencing of transcripts expressed by non-senescent and senescent astrocytes confirmed that glutamate homeostasis pathway declines upon senescence. Our results suggest a key role for cellular senescence, particularly in astrocytes, in excitotoxicity, which may lead to neurodegeneration including Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias."
https://openalex.org/W2999088319,"The ventral pallidum (VP) is critical for invigorating reward seeking and is also involved in punishment avoidance, but how it contributes to such opposing behavioral actions remains unclear. Here, we show that GABAergic and glutamatergic VP neurons selectively control behavior in opposing motivational contexts. In vivo recording combined with optogenetics in mice revealed that these two populations oppositely encode positive and negative motivational value, are differentially modulated by animal's internal state, and determine the behavioral response during motivational conflict. Furthermore, GABAergic VP neurons are essential for movements toward reward in a positive motivational context but suppress movements in an aversive context. In contrast, glutamatergic VP neurons are essential for movements to avoid a threat but suppress movements in an appetitive context. Our results indicate that GABAergic and glutamatergic VP neurons encode the drive for approach and avoidance, respectively, with the balance between their activities determining the type of motivational behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2999464699,"Currently prescribed medications for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that are based on acetylcholinesterase inhibition only offer symptomatic relief but do not provide protection against neurodegeneration. There appear to be an intense need for the development of therapeutic strategies that not only improve brain functions but also prevent neurodegeneration. The oxidative stress is one of the main causative factors of AD. Various antioxidants are being investigated to prevent neurodegeneration in AD. The objective of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of naringenin (NAR) against AlCl3+D-gal induced AD-like symptoms in an animal model. Rats were orally pre-treated with NAR (50 mg/kg) for two weeks and then exposed to AlCl3+D-gal (150 mg/kg + 300 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for one week to develop AD-like symptoms. The standard drug, donepezil (DPZ) was used as a stimulator of cholinergic activity. Our results showed that NAR pre-treatment significantly protected AD-like behavioral disturbances in rats. In DPZ group, rats showed improved cognitive and cholinergic functions but the neuropsychiatric functions were not completely improved and showed marked histopathological alterations. However, NAR not only prevented AlCl3+D-gal induced AD-like symptoms but also significantly prevented neuropsychiatric dysfunctions in rats. Results of present study suggest that NAR may play a role in enhancing neuroprotective and cognition functions and it can potentially be considered as a neuroprotective compound for therapeutic management of AD in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2946990124,"Functional coupling between the amygdala and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) has been implicated in the generation of negative affective states; however, the mechanisms by which stress increases amygdala-dmPFC synaptic strength and generates anxiety-like behaviors are not well understood. Here, we show that the mouse basolateral amygdala (BLA)-prelimbic prefrontal cortex (plPFC) circuit is engaged by stress and activation of this pathway in anxiogenic. Furthermore, we demonstrate that acute stress exposure leads to a lasting increase in synaptic strength within a reciprocal BLA-plPFC-BLA subcircuit. Importantly, we identify 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG)-mediated endocannabinoid signaling as a key mechanism limiting glutamate release at BLA-plPFC synapses and the functional collapse of multimodal 2-AG signaling as a molecular mechanism leading to persistent circuit-specific synaptic strengthening and anxiety-like behaviors after stress exposure. These data suggest that circuit-specific impairment in 2-AG signaling could facilitate functional coupling between the BLA and plPFC and the translation of environmental stress to affective pathology."
https://openalex.org/W3000219451,"Objective Amniotic fluid cytokines have been implicated in the mechanisms of preterm labor and birth. Cytokines can be packaged within or on the surface of extracellular vesicles. The main aim of this study was to test whether the protein abundance internal to and on the surface of extracellular vesicles changes in the presence of sterile intra-amniotic inflammation and proven intra-amniotic infection in women with preterm labor as compared to the women with preterm labor without either intra-amniotic inflammation or proven intra-amniotic infection. Study design Women who had an episode of preterm labor and underwent an amniocentesis for the diagnosis of intra-amniotic infection or intra-amniotic inflammation were classified into three groups: 1) preterm labor without either intra-amniotic inflammation or proven intra-amniotic infection, 2) preterm labor with sterile intra-amniotic inflammation, and 3) preterm labor with intra-amniotic infection. The concentrations of 38 proteins were determined on the extracellular vesicle surface, within the vesicles, and in the soluble fraction of amniotic fluid. Results 1) Intra-amniotic inflammation, regardless of detected microbes, was associated with an increased abundance of amniotic fluid cytokines on the extracellular vesicle surface, within vesicles, and in the soluble fraction. These changes were most prominent in women with proven intra-amniotic infection. 2) Cytokine changes on the surface of extracellular vesicles were correlated with those determined in the soluble fraction; yet the magnitude of the increase was significantly different between these compartments. 3) The performance of prediction models of early preterm delivery based on measurements on the extracellular vesicle surface was equivalent to those based on the soluble fraction. Conclusions Differential packaging of amniotic fluid cytokines in extracellular vesicles during preterm labor with sterile intra-amniotic inflammation or proven intra-amniotic infection is reported herein for the first time. The current study provides insights into the biology of the intra-amniotic fluid ad may aid in the development of biomarkers for obstetrical disease."
https://openalex.org/W2999373107,"Poxviruses replicate in cytoplasmic structures called factories and each factory begins as a single infecting particle. Sixty-years ago Cairns predicted that this might have effects on vaccinia virus (VACV) recombination because the factories would have to collide and mix their contents to permit recombination. We've since shown that factories collide irregularly and that even then the viroplasm mixes poorly. We've also observed that while intragenic recombination occurs frequently early in infection, intergenic recombination is less efficient and happens late in infection. Something inhibits factory fusion and viroplasm mixing but what is unclear. To study this, we've used optical and electron microscopy to track factory movement in co-infected cells and correlate these observations with virus development and recombinant formation. While the technical complexity of the experiments limited the number of cells that are amenable to extensive statistical analysis, these studies do show that intergenic recombination coincides with virion assembly and when VACV replication has declined to ≤10% of earlier levels. Along the boundaries between colliding factories, one sees ER membrane remnants and other cell constituents like mitochondria. These collisions don't always cause factory fusion, but when factories do fuse, they still entrain cell constituents like mitochondria and ER-wrapped microtubules. However, these materials wouldn't seem to pose much of a further barrier to DNA mixing and so it's likely that the viroplasm also presents an omnipresent impediment to DNA mixing. Late packaging reactions might help to disrupt the viroplasm, but packaging would sequester the DNA just as the replication and recombination machinery goes into decline and further reduce recombinant yields. Many factors thus appear to conspire to limit recombination between co-infecting poxviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2999734283,"Focused-ion beam lift-out and annular milling is the most common method used for obtaining site specific specimens for atom probe tomography (APT) experiments and transmission electron microscopy. However, one of the main limitations of this technique comes from the structural damage as well as chemical degradation caused by the beam of high-energy ions. These aspects are especially critical in highly-sensitive specimens. In this regard, ion beam milling under cryogenic conditions has been an established technique for damage mitigation. Here, we implement a cryo-focused ion beam approach to prepare specimens for APT measurements from a quadruple cation perovskite-based solar cell device with 19.7% efficiency. As opposed to room temperature FIB milling we found that cryo-milling considerably improved APT results in terms of yield and composition measurement, i.e. halide loss, both related to less defects within the APT specimen. Based on our approach we discuss the prospects of reliable atom probe measurements of perovskite based solar cell materials. An insight into the field evaporation behavior of the organic-inorganic molecules that compose the perovskite material is also given with the aim of expanding the applicability of APT experiments towards nano-characterization of complex organo-metal materials."
https://openalex.org/W2999873106,"Objective The aim of the present study is to examine how moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC) is currently managed in real-world clinical practice across the United States (US) and European Union Five (EU5; France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom). Methods Data from the 2017 Adelphi Inflammatory Bowel-Disease Specific Programme (IBD-DSP) were used. The IBD-DSP is a database of patient chart information abstracted by selected gastroenterologists across the US and EU5. Eligible gastroenterologists who agreed to participate were asked to complete patient record forms for the next seven consecutive eligible adult patients with UC. Only charts from patients with moderate-to-severe UC were included in the analysis (defined as those with documented administration of either an immunosuppressant [IM] or a biologic). Treatment patterns were reported descriptively. Results 411 and 1191 patient charts were included in the US and EU5 (mean ages 44.2 and 39.6 years; 53.0% and 43.5% female), respectively. For those with complete treatment history, 40.7% and 52.9% used either an IM or biologic as their first treatment (with or without steroids). Usage of these therapies increased in subsequent lines. The percentage of patients treated with combination therapy (i.e., biologic therapy with a concomitant IM) in first line generally varied between 10–20% (e.g., US: adalimumab (ADA), 10.8%; infliximab (IFX), 18.2%; EU5: ADA, 12.5%; IFX, 19.9%), though increased in later lines in the EU5. Among patients currently using a biologic therapy, between 10–40% of patients used a higher than indicated dose or greater than indicated dosing frequency during maintenance (e.g., US: IFX, 37.1%; ADA, 13.4%; EU5: IFX, 39.1%; ADA, 36.1%). In both the US and EU5, the primary reason for switching therapy was efficacy-related. Conclusions In this analysis, many patients with moderate-to-severe UC use an IM or biologic as their first therapy after diagnosis. Combination therapy and dose escalation are also common, and underscore the challenges with managing this patient population."
https://openalex.org/W2999956251,"Arctic tourism has rapidly increased in the past two decades. We used social media data to examine localized tourism booms and quantify the spatial expansion of the Arctic tourism footprint. We extracted geotagged locations from over 800,000 photos on Flickr and mapped these across space and time. We critically examine the use of social media as a data source in data-poor regions, and find that while social media data is not suitable as an early warning system of tourism growth in less visited parts of the world, it can be used to map changes at large spatial scales. Our results show that the footprint of summer tourism quadrupled and winter tourism increased by over 600% between 2006 and 2016, although large areas of the Arctic remain untouched by tourism. This rapid increase in the tourism footprint raises concerns about the impacts and sustainability of tourism on Arctic ecosystems and communities. This boom is set to continue, as new parts of the Arctic are being opened to tourism by melting sea ice, new airports and continued promotion of the Arctic as a ‘last chance to see’ destination. Arctic societies face complex decisions about whether this ongoing growth is socially and environmentally sustainable."
https://openalex.org/W3000656673,"Objective To quantify patient preferences for maintenance therapy of Crohn’s disease and understand the impact on treatment selection. Methods We conducted a discrete-choice experiment in patients with Crohn’s disease (n = 155) to measure the importance of attributes relevant to choosing between different medical therapies for maintenance of Crohn’s disease. The attributes included efficacy and withdrawals due to adverse events, as well as dosing and other rare risks of treatment. From the discrete-choice experiment we estimated the part-worth (importance) of each attribute level, and explored preference heterogeneity through latent class analysis. We then used the part-worths to apply weights across each outcome from a prior network meta-analysis to estimate patients’ preferred treatment in pairwise comparisons and for the overall group of treatments. Results The discrete-choice experiment revealed that maintaining remission was the most important attribute. Patients would accept a rare risk of infection or cancer for a 14% absolute increased chance of remission. Latent class analysis demonstrated that 45% of the cohort was risk averse, either to adverse events or requiring a course of prednisone. When these preferences were used in modelling studies to compare pairs of treatments, there was a ≥ 78% probability that all biologic treatments were preferred to azathioprine and methotrexate, based on the balance of benefits and harms. When comparing all treatments, adalimumab was preferred by 53% of patients, who were motivated by efficacy, and vedolizumab was preferred by 30% who were driven by the preference to avoid risks. However, amongst biologic treatment options, there was considerable uncertainty regarding the preferred treatment at the individual patient level. Conclusion Patients with Crohn’s disease from our population were, on average, focused on the benefits of treatment, supporting intensive treatment approaches aimed at maintaining remission. Important preference heterogeneity was identified, however, highlighting the importance of shared decision making when selecting treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2998785496,"Rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) is one of the most economically important oilseed crops worldwide. In Japan, it has been cultivated for more than a century and has formed many feral populations. The aim of this study was to elucidate the genetic diversity of feral rapeseeds by genotyping 537 individuals (among which 130 were determined to be genetically modified) sampled from various regions in Japan. Analysis of 30 microsatellite markers amplified 334 alleles and indicated moderate genetic diversity and high inbreeding (expected heterozygosity, 0.50; observed heterozygosity, 0.16; inbreeding coefficient within individuals, 0.68) within the feral populations. The Mantel test showed only an insignificant weak positive correlation between geographic distance and genetic distance. Analysis of molecular variance showed a greater genetic diversity among individuals than between populations. These results are in accordance with population structure assessed by using principal coordinate analysis and the program STRUCTURE, which showed that the 537 individuals could be assigned to 8 genetic clusters with very large genetic differences among individuals within the same geographic population, and that among feral individuals, many are closely related to rapeseed accessions in the NARO Genebank but some have unknown origins. These unique feral rapeseeds are likely to be affected by strong selection pressure. The results for genetically modified individuals also suggest that they have two different sources and have a considerable degree of diversity, which might be explained by hybridization with nearby individuals and separation of hybrid cultivars. The information obtained in this study could help improve the management of feral rapeseed plants in Japan."
https://openalex.org/W2999766319,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex group of heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders the prevalence of which has been in the rise in the past decade. In an attempt to better target the basic causes of ASD for diagnosis and treatment, efforts to identify reliable biomarkers related to the body's metabolism are increasing. Despite an increase in identifying biomarkers in ASD, there are none so far with enough evidence to be used in routine clinical examination, unless medical illness is suspected. Promising biomarkers include those of mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, energy metabolism, and apoptosis.Sodium (Na+), Potassium (K+), glutathione (GSH), glutathione-s-transferase (GST), Creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Coenzyme Q10, and melatonin (MLTN) were evaluated in 13 participants with ASD and 24 age-matched healthy controls. Additionally, five ratios, which include Na+/K+, GSH:GST, CK:Cas7, CoQ10: Cas 7, and Cas7:MLTN, were tested to measure their predictive values in discriminating between autistic individuals and controls. These markers, either in absolute values, as five ratios, or combined (9 markers + 5 ratios) were subjected to a principal component analysis and multidimensional scaling (MDS), and hierarchical clustering, which are helpful statistical tools in the field of biomarkers.Our data demonstrated that both PCA and MDS analysis were effective in separating autistic from control subjects completely. This was also confirmed through the use of hierarchical clustering, which showed complete separation of the autistic and control groups based on nine biomarkers, five biomarker ratios, or a combined profile. Excellent predictive value of the measured profile was obtained using the receiver operating characteristics analysis, which showed an area under the curve of 1.The availability of an improved predictive profile, represented by nine biomarkers plus the five ratios, inter-related different etiological mechanisms in ASD and would be valuable in providing greater recognition of the altered biological pathways in ASD. Our predictive profile could be used for the diagnosis and intervention of ASD."

Although some studies of the mummies were conducted, a thorough investigation has never been made. Thus, an interdisciplinary team of experts studied the remains using the most recent analytical methods in order to provide an exhaustive analysis of the remains. The bodies were submitted for osteological and archaeothanatological study, radiological investigation, AMS radiocarbon dating, chemical and textile analyses, 3D modelling, entomological as well as aDNA investigation. Here we synthesize the results of one of the most extensive multidisciplinary analyses of ancient Egyptian child mummies, adding significantly to our knowledge of such examples of ancient funerary practices."
https://openalex.org/W2998981899,"Background Parents’ underestimation of their child’s weight status can hinder active participation in overweight prevention programs. We examined the level of agreement between the parents’ perception of their child’s weight status and the child’s actual weight status, moderating factors, and change over time. Methods This cross-sectional study used data collected in 2009 (n = 8105), 2013 (n = 8844) and 2017 (n = 11,022) from a community-based survey conducted among parents of children age 2–12 years in the Netherlands. Parents classified their perception of their child’s weight status on a 5-point Likert scale. In 2009 and 2013, the child’s BMI was calculated from self-reported data by parents. The level of agreement between the parent’s perception of the weight status and the actual weight status was examined using Cohen’s kappa. The role of demographic factors on parents’ perception were examined using logistic regression. Results In 2009, 2013 and 2017, 6%, 6% and 5% of the parents, respectively, classified their child as heavy/extremely heavy. In 2009 and 2013, 64.7% and 61.0% of parents, respectively, underestimated the weight status of their overweight child. This was even higher among parents of obese children. Overall, the agreement between the parents’ perception and the actual weight status improved from 2009 (kappa = 0.38) to 2013 (kappa = 0.43) (p<0.05), but remained unsatisfactory. The parents’ underestimation of their child’s overweight/obesity status was associated with the child’s age in 2009 and 2013 (2–7 years; OR: 0.18), the child’s gender in 2009 (male; OR: 0.55), and the parents’ education level in 2009 (middle and high education; OR: 0.56 and 0.44 respectively). Conclusions Parents’ underestimation of their child’s weight status remains alarmingly high, particularly among parents of young, obese children. This underestimation is a barrier to preventing childhood overweight/obesity. Healthcare professionals should take this underestimation into consideration and should actively encourage parents to take steps to prevent overweight/obesity in their children."
https://openalex.org/W3013184437,"Objectives Incidence of oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas is rising worldwide, and population characterization is important to follow for future trends. The aim of this retrospective study was to present a large cohort of primary oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma from all four health regions of Norway, with descriptive clinicopathological characteristics and five-year survival outcomes. Materials and methods Patients diagnosed with primary treatment-naïve oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas at all four university hospitals in Norway between 2005–2009 were retrospectively included in this study. Clinicopathological data from the electronic health records were compared to survival data. Results A total of 535 patients with primary treatment-naïve oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas were identified. The median survival follow-up time was 48 months (range 0–125 months) after treatment. The median five-year overall survival was found to be 47%. Median five-year disease-specific survival was 52%, ranging from 80% for stage I to 33% for stage IV patients. For patients given treatment with curative intent, the overall survival was found to be 56% and disease-specific survival 62%. Median age at diagnosis was 67 years (range 24–101 years), 64 years for men and 72 years for women. The male: female ratio was 1.2. No gender difference was found in neither tumor status (p = 0.180) nor node status (p = 0.266), but both factors influenced significantly on survival (p<0.001 for both). Conclusions We present a large cohort of primary treatment-naïve oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas in Norway. Five-year disease-specific survival was 52%, and patients eligible for curative treatment had a five-year disease-specific survival up to 62%."
https://openalex.org/W3000588133,"The Ribosome-associated Quality Control (RQC) pathway co-translationally marks incomplete polypeptides from stalled translation with two signals that trigger their proteasome-mediated degradation. The E3 ligase Ltn1 adds ubiquitin and Rqc2 directs the large ribosomal subunit to append carboxy-terminal alanine and threonine residues (CAT tails). When excessive amounts of incomplete polypeptides evade Ltn1, CAT-tailed proteins accumulate and can self-associate into aggregates. CAT tail aggregation has been hypothesized to either protect cells by sequestering potentially toxic incomplete polypeptides or harm cells by disrupting protein homeostasis. To distinguish between these possibilities, we modulated CAT tail aggregation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae with genetic and chemical tools to analyze CAT tails in aggregated and un-aggregated states. We found that enhancing CAT tail aggregation induces proteotoxic stress and antagonizes degradation of CAT-tailed proteins, while inhibiting aggregation reverses these effects. Our findings suggest that CAT tail aggregation harms RQC-compromised cells and that preventing aggregation can mitigate this toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2998818842,"Background Due to substantial improvements in prevention and therapy, stroke incidence and mortality rates have decreased during the last decades, but evidence is still lacking on whether all socioeconomic groups benefited equally and how the length of life affected by stroke developed over time. Our study investigates time trends in stroke-free life years and life years affected by stroke. Special emphasis is given to the question whether trends differ between income groups, leading to decreasing or increasing social inequalities. Methods The analyses are based on claims data of a German statutory health insurance company of the two time periods 2006–2008 and 2014–2016. Income inequalities and time trends in incidence and mortality risks were estimated using multistate survival models. Trends in stroke-free life years and life years affected by stroke are analysed separately for income groups by applying multistate life table analyses. Results Stroke incidence and mortality risks decreased in men and women in all income groups. While stroke-free lifetime could be gained in men having higher incomes, improvements in mortality counterbalanced decreasing incidences, leading to increases in life years affected by stroke among men of the lower and higher income group. Among women, no significant changes in life years could be observed. Conclusions Changes in stroke-affected life years occur among men in all income groups, but are more pronounced in the higher income group. However, irrespective of the income group the proportion of stroke-affected life years remains quite stable over time, pointing towards constant inequalities. Further research is needed on whether impairments due to stroke reduced over time and whether all socioeconomic groups are affected equally."
https://openalex.org/W2999070109,"Limb remote ischemic postconditioning (LRIP) has been reported as an effective method to reduce the induced experimental stroke damage after ischemic reperfusion (IR) injury. Studies suggest that anesthetics used during induction of ischemic stroke can reduce IR injury, which could affect the actual mechanisms of neuroprotection by LRIP. This study focuses on the comparative effects of anesthetics such as isoflurane and ketamine-xylazine on ischemic injury when used during LRIP. Adult C57BL/6 mice were anesthetized by isoflurane or halothane, and transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was induced through insertion of the filament. Under isoflurane or ketamine-xylazine anesthesia, LRIP was performed after 90 min of reperfusion by carrying out three cycles of 5 min ischemia/5 min reperfusion of the bilateral hind limbs for one session per day for a total of 3 days. Results showed that the use of different anesthetics—isoflurane or ketamine-xylazine—during LRIP had no effects on body weight. However, LRIP was able to improve neurological function as observed by the neurological deficit score in ischemic mice. Interestingly, the neurological deficit in the group where ketamine-xylazine was used was better than the group where isoflurane was used during LRIP. Furthermore, the LRIP was able to prolong the period of the ischemic mice on the rotarod and this effect was more significant in the groups where ketamine-xylazine was used during LRIP. Moreover, LRIP significantly attenuated the infarction volume; however, this effect was independent of the anesthetic used during LRIP. From these results, we conclude that ischemic mice that were subjected to LRIP under ketamine-xylazine anesthesia had better neurological deficit outcomes after stroke."

A panel of biomarkers with potential relevance to enhance knowledge on the pathophysiology of PTS was investigated.This case-control study included 93 patients with DVT in the lower limbs, 31 with severe PTS (cases) and 62 with mild/no PTS (controls), over 24 months after an acute episode. Thirty-one healthy individuals (HI) with no history of DVT were included as a reference to the population. FVIII activity, D-dimer, inflammatory cytokines, endothelial dysfunction markers, matrix metalloproteinases, and their inhibitors, tissue remodeling and growth factor levels were evaluated. The classification of PTS was, by the Villalta scale.Patients with severe PTS showed elevated levels of CRP, sICAM-1, sE-selectin, and decreased MMP-9 and MCP-1 levels when compared to patients with mild/no PTS. Moreover, DVT patients presented higher levels of FVIII and D-dimer when compared to HI.DVT patients present an inflammatory status, endothelial dysfunction and altered proteolysis MMPs activity, even a long time after the acute thrombotic episode, which is more significant in severe PTS. These results suggest a possible role of these mediators in the maintenance and worsening of PTS severity."
https://openalex.org/W3000316360,"Neonates are at high risk for central line associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI). Biofilm formation is universal on indwelling catheters but why some biofilms seed the bloodstream to cause CLABSI is not clearly understood. With the objective to test the hypothesis that catheter biofilm microbiome in neonates with CLABSI differs than those without infection, we prospectively enrolled neonates (n = 30) with infected and uninfected indwelling central catheters. Catheters were collected at the time of removal, along with blood samples and skin swabs at the catheter insertion sites. Microbiomes of catheter biofilms, skin swabs and blood were evaluated by profiling the V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene using Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform. The microbial DNA load was higher from catheter biofilms of CLABSI patients without differences in alpha diversity when compared to that of the non-CLABSI neonates. Proteus and unclassified Staphylococcaceae were more abundant in infected catheter biofilms while Bradyrhizobium, Cloacibacterium, and Sphingomonas were more abundant in the uninfected catheters. A blood microbiome was detected in uninfected samples. The blood microbiome in CLABSI neonates clustered separately from the uninfected blood samples in beta diversity plots. We found that the microbiome signature in catheter biofilm and blood of neonates with CLABSI is different than the microbiomes of non-CLABSI neonates."
https://openalex.org/W3000596652,"Dof transcription factors plant-specific and associates with growth and development in plants. We conducted comprehensive and systematic analyses of Dof transcription factors in sugarcane, and identified 29 SsDof transcription factors in sugarcane genome. Those SsDof genes were divided into five groups, with similar gene structures and conserved motifs within the same groups. Segmental duplications are predominant in the evolution of Dof in sugarcane. Cis-element analysis suggested that the functions of SsDofs were involved in growth and development, hormones and abiotic stresses responses in sugarcane. Expression patterns indicated that SsDof7, SsDof23 and SsDof24 had a comparatively high expression in all detected tissues, indicating these genes are crucial in sugarcane growth and development. Moreover, we examined the transcription levels of SsDofs under four plant hormone treatments, SsDof7-3 and SsDof7-4 were down-regulated after ABA treatment, while SsDof7-1 and SsDof7-2 were induced after the same treatment, indicating different alleles may play different roles in response to plant hormones. We also analyzed SsDofs' expression profiling under four abiotic stresses, SsDof5 and SsDof28 significantly responded to these four stresses, indicating they are associate with abiotic stresses responses. Collectively, our results yielded allele specific expression of Dof genes responding to hormones and abiotic stresses in sugarcane, and their cis-elements could be crucial for sugarcane improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2998946380,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a stem cell disease of the bone marrow where mechanisms of inter-leukemic communication and cell-to-cell interactions are proposed to be important for optimal therapy response. Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) are novel intercellular communication structures transporting different cargos with potential implications in therapy resistance. Here, we have investigated TNTs in CML cells and following treatment with the highly effective CML therapeutics tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and interferon-α (IFNα). CML cells from chronic phase CML patients as well as the blast crisis phase cell lines, Kcl-22 and K562, formed few or no TNTs. Treatment with imatinib increased TNT formation in both Kcl-22 and K562 cells, while nilotinib or IFNα increased TNTs in Kcl-22 cells only where the TNT increase was associated with adherence to fibronectin-coated surfaces, altered morphology, and reduced movement involving β1integrin. Ex vivo treated cells from chronic phase CML patients showed limited changes in TNT formation similarly to bone marrow cells from healthy individuals. Interestingly, in vivo nilotinib treatment in a Kcl-22 subcutaneous mouse model resulted in morphological changes and TNT-like structures in the tumor-derived Kcl-22 cells. Our results demonstrate that CML cells express low levels of TNTs, but CML therapeutics increase TNT formation in designated cell models indicating TNT functionality in bone marrow derived malignancies and their microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2999151798,"Background Racial disparities are common in healthcare. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a leading cause of preventable harm, and disparities observed in prevention practices. We examined the impact of a patient-centered VTE education bundle on the non-administration of preventive prophylaxis by race. Methods A post-hoc, subset analysis (stratified by race) of a larger nonrandomized trial. Pre-post comparisons analysis were conducted on 16 inpatient units; study periods were October 2014 through March 2015 (baseline) and April through December 2015 (post-intervention). Patients on 4 intervention units received the patient-centered, nurse educator-led intervention if the electronic health record alerted a non-administered dose of VTE prophylaxis. Patients on 12 control units received no intervention. We compared the conditional odds of non-administered doses of VTE prophylaxis when patient refusal was a reason for non-administration, stratified by race. Results Of 272 patient interventions, 123 (45.2%) were white, 126 (46.3%) were black, and 23 (8.5%) were other races. A significant reduction was observed in the odds of non-administration of prophylaxis on intervention units compared to control units among patients who were black (OR 0.61; 95% CI, 0.46–0.81, p<0.001), white (OR 0.57; 95% CI, 0.44–0.75, p<0.001), and other races (OR 0.50; 95% CI, 0.29–0.88, p = 0.015). Conclusion Our finding suggests that the patient education materials, developed collaboratively with a diverse group of patients, improved patient’s understanding and the importance of VTE prevention through prophylaxis. Quality improvement interventions should examine any differential effects by patient characteristics to ensure disparities are addressed and all patients experience the same benefits."
https://openalex.org/W2999560549,"Intelligent biorefinery design that addresses both the composition of the biomass feedstock as well as fermentation microorganisms could benefit from dedicated tools for computational simulation and computer-assisted optimization. Here we present the BioLego Vn2.0 framework, based on Microsoft Azure Cloud, which supports large-scale simulations of biomass serial fermentation processes by two different organisms. BioLego enables the simultaneous analysis of multiple fermentation scenarios and the comparison of fermentation potential of multiple feedstock compositions. Thanks to the effective use of cloud computing it further allows resource intensive analysis and exploration of media and organism modifications. We use BioLego to obtain biological and validation results, including (1) exploratory search for the optimal utilization of corn biomasses—corn cobs, corn fiber and corn stover—in fermentation biorefineries; (2) analysis of the possible effects of changes in the composition of K. alvarezi biomass on the ethanol production yield in an anaerobic two-step process (S. cerevisiae followed by E. coli); (3) analysis of the impact, on the estimated ethanol production yield, of knocking out single organism reactions either in one or in both organisms in an anaerobic two-step fermentation process of Ulva sp. into ethanol (S. cerevisiae followed by E. coli); and (4) comparison of several experimentally measured ethanol fermentation rates with the predictions of BioLego."
https://openalex.org/W2999957722,"Blood flow in an artery is a fluid-structure interaction problem. It is widely accepted that aneurysm formation, enlargement and failure are associated with wall shear stress (WSS) which is exerted by flowing blood on the aneurysmal wall. To date, the combined effect of aneurysm size and wall elasticity on intra-aneurysm (IA) flow characteristics, particularly in the case of side-wall aneurysms, is poorly understood. Here we propose a model of three-dimensional viscous flow in a compliant artery containing an aneurysm by employing the immersed boundary-lattice Boltzmann-finite element method. This model allows to adequately account for the elastic deformation of both the blood vessel and aneurysm walls. Using this model, we perform a detailed investigation of the flow through aneurysm under different conditions with a focus on the parameters which may influence the wall shear stress. Most importantly, it is shown in this work that the use of flow velocity as a proxy for wall shear stress is well justified only in those sections of the vessel which are close to the ideal cylindrical geometry. Within the aneurysm domain, however, the correlation between wall shear stress and flow velocity is largely lost due to the complexity of the geometry and the resulting flow pattern. Moreover, the correlations weaken further with the phase shift between flow velocity and transmural pressure. These findings have important implications for medical applications since wall shear stress is believed to play a crucial role in aneurysm rupture."
https://openalex.org/W2999219102,"Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with poor quality of life, hospitalization and mortality. COPD phenotype includes using pulmonary function tests to determine airflow obstruction from the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1):forced vital capacity. FEV1 is a commonly used value for severity but is difficult to identify in structured electronic health record (EHR) data. Data source and methods Using the Microsoft SQL Server’s full-text search feature and string functions supporting regular-expression-like operations, we developed an automated tool to extract FEV1 values from progress notes to improve ascertainment of FEV1 in EHR in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS). Results The automated tool increased quantifiable FEV1 values from 12,425 to 16,274 (24% increase in numeric FEV1). Using chart review as the reference, positive predictive value of the tool was 99% (95% Confidence interval: 98.2–100.0%) for identifying quantifiable FEV1 values and a recall value of 100%, yielding an F-measure of 0.99. The tool correctly identified FEV1 measurements in 95% of cases. Conclusion A SQL-based full text search of clinical notes for quantifiable FEV1 is efficient and improves the number of values available in VA data. Future work will examine how these methods can improve phenotyping of patients with COPD in the VA."
https://openalex.org/W3000225702,"Centromeres are prerequisite for accurate segregation and are landmarks of primary constrictions of metaphase chromosomes in eukaryotes. In melon, high-copy-number satellite DNAs (SatDNAs) were found at various chromosomal locations such as centromeric, pericentromeric, and subtelomeric regions. In the present study, utilizing the published draft genome sequence of melon, two new SatDNAs (CmSat162 and CmSat189) of melon were identified and their chromosomal distributions were confirmed using fluorescence in situ hybridization. DNA probes prepared from these SatDNAs were successfully hybridized to melon somatic and meiotic chromosomes. CmSat162 was located on 12 pairs of melon chromosomes and co-localized with the centromeric repeat, Cmcent, at the centromeric regions. In contrast, CmSat189 was found to be located not only on centromeric regions but also on specific regions of the chromosomes, allowing the characterization of individual chromosomes of melon. It was also shown that these SatDNAs were transcribed in melon. These results suggest that CmSat162 and CmSat189 might have some functions at the centromeric regions."
https://openalex.org/W3000382312,"The immune-regulatory compound histamine is involved in the metabolism of the essential skin component hyaluronan (HA). We previously reported that histamine up-regulates the expression of HYBID (hyaluronan-binding protein involved in hyaluronan depolymerization, also called CEMIP or KIAA1199), which plays a key role in HA degradation. However, no information is available about histamine's effects on HA synthase (HAS) expression, the molecular sizes of HA species produced, and histamine receptors and their signaling pathways in skin fibroblasts. Moreover, histamine's effects on photoaged skin remain elusive. Here, we show that histamine increases HA degradation by up-regulating HYBID and down-regulating HAS2 in human skin fibroblasts in a dose- and time-dependent manner and thereby decreases the total amounts and sizes of newly produced HA. Histamine H1 blocker abrogated the histamine effects on HYBID up-regulation, HAS2 suppression, and HA degradation. Histamine H1 agonist exhibited effects on HA levels, composition, and breakdown similar to those of histamine. Of note, blockade of protein kinase Cδ or PI3K–Akt signaling abolished histamine-mediated HYBID stimulation and HAS2 suppression, respectively. Immunohistochemical experiments revealed a significant ∼2-fold increase in tryptase-positive mast cells in photoaged skin, where HYBID and HAS2 expression levels were increased and decreased, respectively, compared with photoprotected skin. These results indicate that histamine controls HA metabolism by up-regulating HYBID and down-regulating HAS2 via distinct signaling pathways downstream of histamine receptor H1.

https://openalex.org/W3000495686,"Objectives Dental caries is the most common chronic childhood disease that occurs in a continuum and can be prevented by children and their parents’ adherence to recommended oral health behaviors. Theory-driven tools help practitioners to identify the causes for poor adherence and develop effective interventions. This study examined the Expanded Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) Model by adding the concept of Sense of Coherence (SOC) to predict parental adherence to preschooler’s preventive dental visits. Methods Data regarding socio-economic demographics were collected from parents of children aged 2–6 years. Constructs of TPB including parental attitudes, subjective norms (SN), Perceived Behavioural Control (PBC), and intention to attend preventive dental visits for their preschoolers were collected by questionnaire, alongside parents’ sense of coherence (SOC). Dental attendance was measured by asking if the child had a regular dental visit during the last year. Structural Equation Modeling Analysis (SEMA) was carried out to identify significant direct and indirect (mediated) pathways in the extended TPB model. Results Three hundred and seventy-eight mothers (mean age = 34.41 years, range 22–48) participated in the study. The mean age of children was 3.92 years, range: 2–6), and 75.9% had dental insurance. Results of the final model showed that predisposing factors (child’s birthplace and mother’s birthplace) significantly predicted enabling resources (family monthly income and child’s dental insurance status); both predicted the TPB components (PBC, SN, and attitude). TPB components, in turn, predicted behavioural intention. However, contrary to expectation, intention did not significantly predict dental attendance in the past 12 months. Parent’s SOC significantly predicted TPB components and dental attendance. Overall, 56% of the variance in dental attendance was explained by the expanded TPB model. Conclusions The expanded TPB model explained a great deal of variance in preschooler’s dental attendance. These findings suggest that the expanded model could be used as the framework for designing interventions or strategies to enhance dental attendance among preschoolers; in particular, such strategies should focus specifically on enhancing parental SOC including empowerment."
https://openalex.org/W3000486153,"Purpose This qualitative study identifies difficulties and unmet needs in psychosocial aspect that Korean cancer survivors reported. Materials and Methods We enrolled 18 cancer survivors who agreed to participate in the focus groups. Each focus group consisted of four to six cancer survivors, considering homogeneity of sex and age. Participants were asked to freely describe the practical difficulties they faced and their unmet needs when living as cancer survivors. A cross-case interview analysis was used to identify major themes. Consensual qualitative research analysis was applied to complement the objectivity of results obtained from participants’ interviews. Results We identified three major themes: 1) shifts what cancer connotes, 2) development of government policies regarding integrative management for cancer survivors, and 3) preparing for cancer survivors’ future through vocational rehabilitation or career development. Conclusion Korean cancer survivors had difficulties in psychosocial adjustment even after the completion of anti-cancer treatments. We identified several unmet needs among participants who were living as cancer survivors. This qualitative study may expand the view of cancer survivorship in Korea by incorporating their voices and experiences to facilitate the development of a more holistic cancer survivorship program."

Both gelled DEs showed a predominantly elastic behavior, in contrast with DE-CP. The degradation rate constant of betanin was significantly higher in DE-CP-GT (90.2 x 10−3 days-1) than in DE-CP-G (11.0 x 10−3 days-1) and DE-CP (14.6 x 10−3 days-1) during cold-storage (4 °C). A shift towards yellow color was found in all the systems during cold-storage (4 °C) and after thermal treatment (70°C/30 min), especially in DE-CP-GT, denoting a higher degradation of betanin. Betalamic acid, cyclo-Dopa 5-O-β-glucoside, 17-decarboxy-betanin and neobetanin were identified by UHPLC-MS/MS as degradation products of betanin."

To analyse and compare the differences in microbial communities in different compartments of Chinese chives, high-throughput sequencing technology was employed to amplify and sequence the V5-V6 region of the 16S rDNA of microorganisms in the leaves, phylloplanes, stems, roots and rhizospheres of Chinese chives. The sequences were clustered by operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and the community composition of bacteria between the endosphere (inner tissues) and ectosphere (outer surfaces) of Chinese chives was analysed based on the OTU. Overall, the results indicated that the endophytic bacteria in Chinese chives mainly include Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Actinomycetes. Alpha diversity index analysis and OTU number analysis showed that the bacterial diversity and richness of the underground plant compartments were higher than those of the above-ground parts. PCoA based on the OTU level showed that the vertical stratification structure of plants and compartments had significant effects on the bacterial community structure. The richness of endophytic bacteria also varied greatly among the different varieties of Chinese chive. A considerable number of endophytic bacteria form symbiotic and mutually beneficial relationships with host plants, which play an important role in regulating host growth, metabolism and stress resistance. Further investigations are needed to uncover the evolution of interactions between plants and endophytes."
https://openalex.org/W2999372828,"Recent evidence shows that the disruption of constitutive insulated neighbourhoods might lead to oncogene dysregulation. We present here a systematic pan-cancer characterisation of the associations between constitutive boundaries and genome alterations in cancer. Specifically, we investigate the enrichment of somatic mutation, abnormal methylation, and copy number alteration events in the proximity of CTCF bindings overlapping with topological boundaries (junctions) in 26 cancer types. Focusing on CTCF motifs that are both in-boundary (overlapping with junctions) and active (overlapping with peaks of CTCF expression), we find a significant enrichment of somatic mutations in several cancer types. Furthermore, mutated junctions are significantly conserved across cancer types, and we also observe a positive selection of transversions rather than transitions in many cancer types. We also analyzed the mutational signature found on the different classes of CTCF motifs, finding some signatures (such as SBS26) to have a higher weight within in-boundary than off-bounday motifs. Regarding methylation, we find a significant number of over-methylated active in-boundary CTCF motifs in several cancer types; similarly to somatic-mutated junctions, they also have a significant conservation across cancer types. Finally, in several cancer types we observe that copy number alterations tend to overlap with active junctions more often than in matched normal samples. While several articles have recently reported a mutational enrichment at CTCF binding sites for specific cancer types, our analysis is pan-cancer and investigates abnormal methylation and copy number alterations in addition to somatic mutations. Our method is fully replicable and suggests several follow-up tumour-specific analyses."

Feline panleukopenia virus (FPLV) in domestic cats is genetically diverse and some strains may differ from those used for vaccination. The presence of FPLV in two domestic cats from Hebei Province in China was identified by polymerase chain reaction. Samples from these animals were used to isolate FPLV strains in CRFK cells for genome sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to compare our isolates with available sequences of FPLV, mink parvovirus (MEV) and canine parvovirus (CPV). The isolated strains were closely related to strains of FPLV/MEV isolated in the 1960s. Our analysis also revealed that the evolutionary history of FPLV and MEV is characterized by local adaptations in the Vp2 gene. Thus, it is likely that new FPLV strains are emerging to evade the anti-FPLV immune response."

The aim of the present study is to assess the interaction effect of ETS exposure and high-perceived work stress on the risk of hyperlipidemia.A total of 11,875 middle-aged civil servants from 647 registered institutions employed by the Taiwan government were randomly selected using multistage stratified cluster sampling based on proportional probabilistic sampling. Each participant anonymously and independently filled out a web-based questionnaire and informed consent.The prevalence of hyperlipidemia in middle-aged civil servants diagnosed by physicians was 11.5% for men and 6.1% for women. Hyperlipidemia was significantly associated with smoking, alcohol consumption, betel nut chewing, weight gain and perceived work stress. In both the obesity and smoking groups, there were consistent interaction effects of ETS exposure and perceived work stress on hyperlipidemia for middle-aged civil servants. Non-obese and non-smoking groups were more at risk for hyperlipidemia from exposure to both ETS and high-perceived work stress.There is an interaction effect of ETS exposure and high-perceived work stress on hyperlipidemia, regardless of obesity and smoking. It is crucial to immediately reduce ETS exposure and stressful work by enforcing smoke-free policies and reducing pressure for civil servants."
https://openalex.org/W2999659678,"Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to atherosclerosis is a major cause of death in renal allograft recipients. Recently, C1q/TNF-α related protein-9 (CTRP9), which is a paralog of adiponectin (ADPN), has been suggested to be related to the prevention of atherosclerosis and the occurrence of CVD, but this relationship has not been confirmed in renal allograft recipients. Subjects and methods The relationships among the serum CTRP9 concentration, serum ADPN concentration, and vascular calcification were investigated in 50 kidney transplantation recipients at our hospital. Calcification of the abdominal aorta was evaluated according to the aortic calcification area index (ACAI) calculated from CT images. Changes in the serum CTRP9 and ADPN fractions and ACAI were examined for 8 years. In addition, the expression of CTRP9 and ADPN and their respective receptors AdipoR1 and R2 in muscular arteries of the kidney was examined by immunofluorescence. Results In renal allograft recipients, the serum CTRP9 concentration at the start of the observation was not significant correlated with eGFR or serum high-molecular-weight (HMW)-ADPN concentration (rS = -0.009, p = 0.950; rS = -0.226, p = 0.114, respectively). However, the change in the serum CTRP9 concentration was positively correlated with the change in the serum HMW-ADPN concentration (rS = 0.315, p = 0.026) and negatively correlated with the change in ACAI (rS = -0.367, p = 0.009). Multiple regression analysis revealed that the serum HMW-ADPN concentration was a significant positive factor for the change in the serum CTRP9 concentration. Moreover, for ACAI, an increase in the serum CTRP9 concentration was an improving factor, but aging was an exacerbating factor. Furthermore, colocalization of CTRP9 and AdipoR1 was noted in the luminal side of intra-renal arterial intima. Conclusion In renal allograft recipients, both CTRP9 and HMW-ADPN were suggested to prevent the progression of aortic calcification through AdipoR1."
https://openalex.org/W3000030406,"Here we characterized the development of the trypanosomatid Blastocrithidia raabei in the dock bug Coreus marginatus using light and electron microscopy. This parasite has been previously reported to occur in the host hemolymph, which is rather typical for dixenous trypanosomatids transmitted to a plant or vertebrate with insect's saliva. In addition, C. marginatus has an unusual organization of the intestine, which makes it refractory to microbial infections: two impassable segments isolate the anterior midgut portion responsible for digestion and absorption from the posterior one containing symbiotic bacteria. Our results refuted the possibility of hemolymph infection, but revealed that the refractory nature of the host provokes very aggressive behavior of the parasite and makes its life cycle more complex, reminiscent of that in some dixenous trypanosomatids. In the pre-barrier midgut portion, the epimastigotes of B. raabei attach to the epithelium and multiply similarly to regular insect trypanosomatids. However, when facing the impassable constricted region, the parasites rampage and either fiercely break through the isolating segments or attack the intestinal epithelium in front of the barrier. The cells of the latter group pass to the basal lamina and accumulate there, causing degradation of the epitheliocytes and thus helping the epimastigotes of the former group to advance posteriorly. In the symbiont-containing post-barrier midgut segment, the parasites either attach to bacterial cells and produce cyst-like amastigotes (CLAs) or infect enterocytes. In the rectum, all epimastigotes attach either to the cuticular lining or to each other and form CLAs. We argue that in addition to the specialized life cycle B. raabei possesses functional cell enhancements important either for the successful passage through the intestinal barriers (enlarged rostrum and well-developed Golgi complex) or as food reserves (vacuoles in the posterior end)."
https://openalex.org/W3000168872,"Pharyngeal gonorrhoea is a common sexually transmitted infection among 'men having sex with other men' (MSM). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) pharyngeal infections are usually characterized by the absence of symptoms, acting as an important reservoir for their further spread. To the best of our knowledge, no information about the composition of the pharyngeal microbiome during an ongoing NG infection is currently available. Therefore, in this study, we characterized the pharyngeal bacterial community profiles associated with NG infection in a well-selected cohort of HIV-negative MSM reporting unsafe oral intercourse. A total of 70 pharyngeal swabs were considered, comparing non-infected subjects (n = 45) versus patients with pharyngeal gonorrhoea (n = 25) whose microbiota composition was analyzed from pharyngeal swabs through sequencing of hypervariable V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. The pharyngeal microbiome of all subjects was dominated by Prevotellaceae, Veillonellaceae and Streptococcaceae families. Patients with pharyngeal gonorrhoea harboured a pharyngeal microbiome quite similar to negative subjects. Nevertheless, when looking to less-represented bacterial species (relative abundance approximately 1% or less), an imbalance between aerobe and anaerobe microorganisms was observed in NG-infected patients. In particular, the pharyngeal microbiome of NG-positive individuals was richer in several anaerobes (e.g. Treponema, Parvimonas, Peptococcus, Catonella, Filifactor) and poorer in various aerobe genera (i.e. Pseudomonas, Escherichia), compared to non-infected controls. No significant differences were noticed in the distribution of commensal Neisseria species of the oropharynx between NG-positive and negative subjects. Metabolic variations induced by changes in the microbiome abundance were assessed by a functional prediction of the bacterial metabolic pathways: a more abundant involvement of D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, as well as a greater activation of the energy metabolism was observed in patients with pharyngeal gonorrhoea compared to non-infected individuals. Information about the bacterial composition of the pharyngeal microbiome in case of gonorrhoea could shed light on the pathogenesis of the infection and open new perspectives for the prevention and control of this condition."
https://openalex.org/W3006250941,"Background Khat abuse and psychopathy are both strongly related to criminal activity. Higher rates of substance use in people with psychopathy are hypothesized to be related to psychopathic personality traits, which include high sensation seeking, low conscientiousness and neuroticism, impulsivity, and irresponsibility. Little is known, however, about the association between psychopathy and khat abuse among prisoners in Ethiopia. Therefore, we evaluated the presence of these two factors in prisoners in the correctional institution in Jimma, Southwest Ethiopia. Materials and methods We used a cross-sectional study design to collect data from 336 prisoners from June 5 to July 5, 2017. Study participants were selected by a systematic random sampling technique. Khat abuse was assessed with the Drug Abuse Screening Tool and psychopathy with the Psychopathy Checklist: Screening Version. We also assessed nicotine dependence with the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence; alcohol use disorder, with the alcohol use disorder identification test; adverse traumatic life events, with the Life Events Checklist; and social support, with the Oslo 3-Item Social Support Scale. Data were entered into EpiData version 3.1 and analyzed in bivariate and multivariable logistic regression models. Variables with a P value < 0.05 in the final fitted model were declared to be significantly associated with the outcome variable. Results The overall prevalence of lifetime khat use was 59.9%, and the prevalence of khat abuse in prisoners with psychopathy was 78.0%. Prisoners with psychopathy had a three times higher odds ratio of abusing khat than those without psychopathy (AOR = 3.00 [1.17–7.67]). Among the confounders, a family history of substance use (AOR = 2.50 [1.45–4.31]), poor support (AOR = 2.28 [1.11–4.67]), alcohol use disorder (AOR = 7.78 [4.16–14.53]), and suicidal ideation and suicide attempts (AOR = 2.26 [1.45–4.31]) were also positively associated with khat abuse. Conclusions The prevalence of khat abuse was higher in prisoners with possible or probable psychopathy."
https://openalex.org/W2999627574,"We used three complementary methods to assess the diet of two insectivorous bat species: one an obligate aerial hunter, Miniopterus natalensis, and the other Myotis tricolor whose morphology and taxonomic affiliation to other trawling bats suggests it may be a trawler (capturing insects from the water surface with its feet and tail). We used visual inspection, stable isotope values and fatty acid profiles of insect fragments in bat faeces sampled across five sites to determine the contribution of aquatic and terrestrial arthropods to the diets of the two species. The niche widths of M. tricolor were generally wider than those of Miniopterus natalensis but with much overlap, both taking aquatic and terrestrial insects, albeit in different proportions. The diet of M. tricolor had high proportions of fatty acids (20:5ω3 and 22:6ω3) that are only obtainable from aquatic insects. Furthermore, the diet of M. tricolor had higher proportions of water striders (Gerridae) and whirligig beetles (Gyrinidae), insects obtainable via trawling, than Miniopterus natalensis. These results suggest both species are flexible in their consumption of prey but that M. tricolor may use both aerial hawking and trawling, or at least gleaning, to take insects from water surfaces. The resultant spatial segregation may sufficiently differentiate the niches of the two species, allowing them to co-exist. Furthermore, our results emphasize that using a combination of methods to analyse diets of cryptic animals yields greater insights into animal foraging ecology than any of them on their own."
https://openalex.org/W3000125014,"The phenomenon of aging arises from multiple, complex interactions causing dysfunction in cells and organs. In particular, fertility drastically decreases with age. Previously, we have demonstrated that the functional characteristics of the bovine oviduct and uterus change with the age-dependent upregulation of inflammation and noted that S100A9 triggers inflammatory responses in oviduct epithelial cells. In the present study, we investigated the hypothesis that S100A9 affects reproductive events to aspect such as sperm function, fertilization, and the development of the embryo in cows. To investigate the effect of S100A9 on bovine sperm, we incubated sperms in vitro with S100A9 for 5 h and observed significantly decreased sperm motility and viability. During in vitro fertilization, S100A9 treatment for 5 h did not affect the rate of fertilization, time of first division of embryos, or embryo development to blastocyst stage. Treatment of 2-cell stage embryos with S100A9 for 5 h significantly reduced the proportion of cells undergoing normal division (4-8 cell embryos) and embryo development to the blastocyst stage. In experiment involving 24 h treatment of 2-cell embryos, the development of all embryos stopped at the 2-cell stage in the S100A9-treated group. In blastocyst-stage embryos, S100A9 treatment significantly stimulated the expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the mRNA expression of ER stress markers, and activated caspase-3 with subsequent nuclear fragmentation. Pre-treatment with an ER stress inhibitor significantly suppressed caspase-3 activation by the S100A9 treatment, suggesting that S100A9 induces blastocyst dysfunction by apoptosis (via caspase-3 activation) depending on ER stress. These results indicate that direct exposure to S100A9 exerted adverse effects on sperm function and embryo development. These findings suggest that excessive dose of S100A9 may have an adverse effect to the reproductive machinery by inducing inflammation and tissue dysfunction."

Smoking habits and obesity have jointly great impact on mortality, however mechanisms behind the effect and variables involved in the obesity paradox is still unknown. Objectives This study examines risk factors for all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality in males and females with high cardiovascular risk, mediated by smoking habits, body mass index (BMI, kg/m2), and serum phosphate (S-P) levels. Methods Patients were admitted to the Vindeln Patient Education Center in groups of 30 for a four-week residential comprehensive program (114 hours) focusing on smoking cessation, stress reduction, food preferences and selections, and physical exercise. The follow-up, in years from 1984 to 2014 corresponds to 30 years. This study included 2,504 patients (1,408 females and 1,096 males). Cox regression analysis was used to assess mortality risk associated with smoking habits, low and high BMI, and low and high S-P levels. Results High BMI (>34,2 kg/m2), current smoking, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), high serum calcium (S-Ca), mmol/L and high systolic blood pressure (SBP, mmHg) were associated with all-cause mortality irrespective of sex. Former and current smoking females had a high all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.581; 95% CI 1.108–2.256, adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.935; 95% CI 1.461–2.562, respectively) while current smoking and high BMI increased risk for cardiovascular mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 3.505; 95% CI 2.140–5.740 and [HR] 1.536; 95% CI 1.058–2.231, respectively). Neither low nor high levels of S-P predicted all-cause, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer mortality in males or females while low levels of S-P predicted all-cause mortality in smokers (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.713; 95% CI 1.211–2.424). In non-smokers, low BMI (<27.6 kg/m2) was protecting and high BMI a risk for all-cause mortality. In males, ischemic heart disease (IHD), and low serum albumin (S-Alb) were associated with all-cause mortality. In females, an interaction between high BMI and smoking (HbmiSM) decreased the cardiovascular mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.410; 95% CI 0.179–0.937, respectively). Conclusions High BMI and current smoking were associated with all-cause mortality in both males and females in the present high cardiovascular-risk cohort. In current smokers and non-smokers, T2DM and high S-Ca were associated with an increase in all-cause mortality, while low S-P was associated with all-cause mortality in smokers. Interaction between high BMI and smoking contribute to the obesity paradox by being protective for cardiovascular mortality in females."
https://openalex.org/W2999190209,"Although rotation of the distal portion of the tibia below the osteotomy site is considered an inevitable change in the axial plane in open wedge high tibial osteotomy (HTO), several studies on this issue have shown contradictory results. The purpose of this study was, therefore, to determine the direction and amount of distal tibial rotation following open wedge HTO using a three-dimensional reconstructed model.This study involved 41 patients (42 knees) undergoing open wedge HTO for primary medial osteoarthritis. Distal tibial rotation was measured on the overlaid tibial plateau of a preoperative and postoperative 3-dimensional reconstructed model based on computed tomography.The mean distal tibial external rotation was 2.7° ± 2.3° (range, -0.9° to 9.9°), and the opening gap was larger in the group with > 3° distal tibial rotation than in the group with ≤ 3° distal tibial rotation (11.4 mm vs. 9.6 mm, P = 0.027). Multiple regression analysis showed that the opening gap was the only predictor of distal tibial rotation. On receiver operating characteristics analysis, an opening gap of 10 mm was found to be the optimal cutoff value for achieving greater than 3° of distal tibial rotation.Following medial opening wedge HTO, the distal tibial portion below the osteotomy site rotated approximately 3° externally. The magnitude of the external rotation of the distal tibia was affected by the opening gap width."

Although the general pathway of Type-I sex pheromone biosynthesis is well established, only a handful of genes encoding enzymes involved in this pathway have been characterized. Streltzoviella insularis is a destructive wood-boring pest of many street trees in China, and the female sex pheromone of this species comprises a blend of (Z)-3-tetradecenyl acetate, (E)-3-tetradecenyl acetate, and (Z)-5-dodecenyl acetate. This organism therefore provides an excellent model for research on the diversity of genes and molecular mechanisms involved in pheromone production. Herein, we assembled the pheromone gland transcriptome of S. insularis by next-generation sequencing and identified 74 genes encoding candidate key enzymes involved in the fatty acid biosynthesis, β-oxidation, and functional group modification. In addition, tissue expression patterns further showed that an acetyl-CoA carboxylase and two desaturases were highly expressed in the pheromone glands compared with the other tissues, indicating possible roles in S. insularis sex pheromone biosynthesis. Finally, we proposed putative S. insularis biosynthetic pathways for sex pheromone components and highlighted candidate genes. Our findings lay a solid foundation for understanding the molecular mechanisms underpinning S. insularis sex pheromone biosynthesis, and provide potential targets for disrupting chemical communication that could assist the development of novel pest control methods."
https://openalex.org/W3000286465,"The engraftment of human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hSC-CMs) is a promising treatment for remuscularizing the heart wall post-infarction, but it is plagued by low survival of transplanted cells. We hypothesize that this low survival rate is due to continued ischemia within the infarct, and that increasing the vascularization of the scar will ameliorate the ischemia and improve hSC-CM survival and engraftment. An adenovirus expressing the vascular growth factor Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) was injected into the infarcted myocardium of rats immediately after ischemia/reperfusion, four days prior to hSC-CM injection. By two weeks post-cell injection, Shh treatment had successfully increased capillary density outside the scar, but not within the scar. In addition, there was no change in vessel size or percent vascular volume when compared to cell injection alone. Micro-computed tomography revealed that Shh failed to increase the number and size of larger vessels. It also had no effect on graft size or heart function when compared to cell engraftment alone. Our data suggests that, when combined with the engraftment of hSC-CMs, expression of Shh within the infarct scar and surrounding myocardium is unable to increase vascularization of the infarct scar, and it does not improve survival or function of hSC-CM grafts."
https://openalex.org/W3000563456,"Mistreatment during childbirth occurs across the globe and endangers the well-being of pregnant women and their newborns. A gender-sensitive approach to mistreatment during childbirth seems relevant in Ethiopia, given previous research among Ethiopian midwives and patients suggesting that male midwives provide more respectful maternity care, which is possibly mediated by self-esteem and stress. This study aimed a) to develop a tool that assesses mistreatment appraisal from a provider's perspective and b) to assess gender differences in mistreatment appraisal among Ethiopian final-year midwifery students and to analyze possible mediating roles of self-esteem and stress. First, we developed a research tool (i.e. a quantitative scale) to assess mistreatment appraisal from a provider's perspective, on the basis of scientific literature and the review of seven experts regarding its relevance and comprehensiveness. Second, we utilized this scale, the so-called Mistreatment Appraisal Scale, among 390 Ethiopian final-year midwifery students to assess their mistreatment appraisal, self-esteem (using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale), stress (using the Perceived Stress Scale) and various background characteristics. The scale's internal consistency was acceptable (α = .75), corrected item-total correlations were acceptable (.24 - .56) and inter-item correlations were mostly acceptable (.07 - .63). Univariable (B = 3.084, 95% CI [-.005, 6.173]) and multivariable (B = 1.867, 95% CI [-1.472, 5.205]) regression analyses did not show significant gender differences regarding mistreatment appraisal. Mediation analyses showed that self-esteem (a1b1 = -.030, p = .677) and stress (a2b2 = -.443, p = .186) did not mediate the effect of gender on mistreatment appraisal. The scale to assess mistreatment appraisal appears to be feasible and reliable. No significant association between gender and mistreatment appraisal was observed and self-esteem and stress were not found to be mediators. Future research is needed to evaluate the scale's criterion validity and to assess determinants and consequences of mistreatment during childbirth from various perspectives."

Ecological niche models provide estimates of species presence at different time intervals. The avifauna of La Brea includes approximately 120 species dating to approximately 15,000 years ago. Niche models predicted presence at the Last Glacial Maximum for over 90% of 89 landbird species. This confirms that niche modeling produces sensible range estimates at the Last Glacial Maximum. For 97 currently local species that are as yet undocumented at La Brea over 90% were predicted to occur; absence is due to insufficient study, lack of the ecological niche, transient occurrence or a behavioral ability to avoid entrapment. Our 366 niche models provide a prospective checklist of the landbird fauna of La Brea. The models indicate fluidity in life history strategies and a higher proportion of resident birds at the LGM (88% to 60%). We evaluated a subset of 103 species in breeding and winter periods using two climate models (MIROC-ESM, CCSM4) with a variety of differing parameters, finding differences in 5% of the niche models. Niche breadths in bark-foraging birds changed little between the present and LGM, suggesting that greater species diversity at the LGM was due to greater niche availability rather than contractions of niche breadths (i.e., niche partitioning)."
