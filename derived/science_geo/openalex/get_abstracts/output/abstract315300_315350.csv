https://openalex.org/W2057171590,"The heat content of copepods and other microcrustaceans and two species of algae in calories per gram varied from 4427 for immature crayfish to 5643 for the female Diaptomus siciloides. The algae, cladoceran, anostracan, conchostracan, and immature crayfish were all below 5000, whereas all the copepods were above 5300 (x 5467); thus copepods may contribute more energy to the food chain on a weight basis than other lower forms of crustacea."
https://openalex.org/W2056541897,An aluminosilicate of novel crystal structure has been synthesized. It has molecular-sieve properties that permit separation of straight-chain from branched-chain and cyclic hydrocarbons. This zeolite is unusually stable in solutions of low pH.

Knowledge of these behavioral patterns helps to combat insects of economic importance. For example, attractants in traps offer a remarkably simple means of detecting insects and may even be useful in direct control. They are increasing the efficiency of insecticide applications because treatments need be applied only where insects are caught and only as long as they are caught."

https://openalex.org/W1995311785,Eleven monkeys were subjected to avoidance stress for 24 hours followed immediately by intravenous inoculation with type I poliovirus. Twelve control monkeys not so stressed were similarly inoculated. Seven of 11 stressed animals survived the infection while only one of the controls lived and their average incubation period was significantly longer than the average for controls. The number of circulating lymphocytes decreased significantly in experimental animals during and immediately after exposure to stress.
https://openalex.org/W1968709469,"Genetic recombination was demonstrated in the bacterial genus Nocardia. The compatibility mechanism governing recombination differs from that of Escherichia coli and the streptomycetes. Mutants of N. erythropolis or N. canicruria, of homologous origin, were incompatible, but mutants of heterologous origin were compatible. Such a compatibility system is suggestive of classic heterothallism which up to now has not been known among the bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2063149542,"Progenies of a doubled haploid from Pima S-1, a commercial variety of Gossypium barbadense L., contained a very high frequency of haploid plants. The haploid plants, in contrast with those previously reported in cotton, originated from single- rather than twin-embryo seeds. Apparently the haploid-producing ability of this line of cotton is inherited."
https://openalex.org/W1973270531,"Whereas intact antibody to rat kidney (7S) produced immediate and sustained proteinuria in rats, univalent fragments (papain digests) of the antibody did not, and divalent fragments (pepsin digests) produced only transitory proteinuria. The antibody fragments differed from the intact antibody in fixing little, if any, complement in vivo which may explain why they did not cause serious renal damage."

https://openalex.org/W2018219967,"Planktonic foraminifera occur in the limy sediment of a manganese-coated breccia from the top of Erben Guyot, a sunken island which is located about 800 miles west of San Diego, California. The fauna suggests an age of Early Miocene (Aquitanian Stage), which represents an absolute age of more than 25 million years. Bathyal foraminifera in the sample indicate considerable subsidence between the suggested time of truncation (Oligocene) of the seamount and the accumulation of the foraminiferal fauna."
https://openalex.org/W2039221859,"The critical night length of the short-day plant Lemna perpusilla, grown with sucrose, increases roughly 3 hours under cycles with ""light periods"" composed of darkness preceded and ended by brief exposures to light. Although plants so grown are white, the effect is due neither to the absence of photosynthesis nor to insufficient total energy. It is inconsistent with current ideas on photoperiodic timing but may be explained by a hypothesis based on reported properties of phytochrome."
https://openalex.org/W1969094588,"Groups and individuals of diverse species of turtles have been distinguished by selective agglutinations of their washed red blood cells when undiluted normal serums or plant extracts are used as agglutinins. During these studies, production of hemagglutinins and precipitins has been induced in turtles and certain other poikilotherms."
https://openalex.org/W2011115445,"Rhodium-102 was produced as a tracer for U.S. high-altitude detonations in August 1958 and has been detected and monitored in precipitation since October 1960. Between January and September 1961, when atmospheric tests were resumed, the contribution of this high-altitude debris in fallout increased."

https://openalex.org/W2007019001,"Data obtained by field work and from engineers and operators, have revealed some important facts about jointing in the coal beds of Ohio. The joints show remarkable uniformity in trend, and the direction of the cleat joints appears to be the same even though more than one bed of coal is involved. In the northern part of the coal mining area, the joints occur usually in two sets known as the face and the butt joints which lie at right angles to each other. One set extends in a northeast-southwest direction and the other has a northwest-southeast trend. Farther south, one set extends in a direction a few degrees west of north and the other set, at right angles, has a trend a few degrees north of east, or nearly east and west. The joints are arranged in an arc, the convex side to the west. This curve corresponds to the curve in the folded Appalachians in central and eastern Pennsylvania, in the same latitude.There is varied opinion as to the origin of the cleat in coal, but it is difficult to explain the remarkable uniformity in direction of the joints, the fact that in successive coal beds in the same area the cleat joints have approximately the same trend, and the parallelism with the folded Appalachians to the east in the same latitude, unless one believes in the theory of tectonic origin. The joints were probably formed by deformation at the time the folded Appalachians were formed, although one must admit that shrinkage has taken place to some extent and that this fact cannot be denied."
