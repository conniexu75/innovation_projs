https://openalex.org/W2097660065,"Obesity is a serious international health problem that increases the risk of several common diseases. The genetic factors predisposing to obesity are poorly understood. A genome-wide search for type 2 diabetesâsusceptibility genes identified a common variant in the FTO (fat mass and obesity associated) gene that predisposes to diabetes through an effect on body mass index (BMI). An additive association of the variant with BMI was replicated in 13 cohorts with 38,759 participants. The 16% of adults who are homozygous for the risk allele weighed about 3 kilograms more and had 1.67-fold increased odds of obesity when compared with those not inheriting a risk allele. This association was observed from age 7 years upward and reflects a specific increase in fat mass."

Research is increasingly done in teams across nearly all fields. Teams typically produce more frequently cited research than individuals do, and this advantage has been increasing over time. Teams now also produce the exceptionally high-impact research, even where that distinction was once the domain of solo authors. These results are detailed for sciences and engineering, social sciences, arts and humanities, and patents, suggesting that the process of knowledge creation has fundamentally changed."
https://openalex.org/W1989896216,"Three-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) were synthesized by targeting two nets based on triangular and tetrahedral nodes: ctn and bor . The respective 3D COFs were synthesized as crystalline solids by condensation reactions of tetrahedral tetra (4-dihydroxyborylphenyl) methane or tetra (4-dihydroxyborylphenyl)silane and by co-condensation of triangular 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene. Because these materials are entirely constructed from strong covalent bonds (C-C, C-O, C-B, and B-O), they have high thermal stabilities (400° to 500°C), and they also have high surface areas (3472 and 4210 square meters per gram for COF-102 and COF-103, respectively) and extremely low densities (0.17 grams per cubic centimeter)."
https://openalex.org/W2125548284,"The rhesus macaque ( Macaca mulatta ) is an abundant primate species that diverged from the ancestors of Homo sapiens about 25 million years ago. Because they are genetically and physiologically similar to humans, rhesus monkeys are the most widely used nonhuman primate in basic and applied biomedical research. We determined the genome sequence of an Indian-origin Macaca mulatta female and compared the data with chimpanzees and humans to reveal the structure of ancestral primate genomes and to identify evidence for positive selection and lineage-specific expansions and contractions of gene families. A comparison of sequences from individual animals was used to investigate their underlying genetic diversity. The complete description of the macaque genome blueprint enhances the utility of this animal model for biomedical research and improves our understanding of the basic biology of the species."
https://openalex.org/W2003118297,"Unconscious motivation in humans is often inferred but rarely demonstrated empirically. We imaged motivational processes, implemented in a paradigm that varied the amount and reportability of monetary rewards for which subjects exerted physical effort. We show that, even when subjects cannot report how much money is at stake, they nevertheless deploy more force for higher amounts. Such a motivational effect is underpinned by engagement of a specific basal forebrain region. Our findings thus reveal this region as a key node in brain circuitry that enables expected rewards to energize behavior, without the need for the subjects`awareness."
https://openalex.org/W2040583506,"Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), the rate-limiting enzyme in heme degradation, is an integral membrane protein of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. However, we detected an HO-1 immunoreactive signal in the nucleus of cultured cells after exposure to hypoxia and heme or heme/hemopexin. Under these conditions, a faster migrating HO-1 immunoreactive band was enriched in nuclear extracts, suggesting that HO-1 was cleaved to allow nuclear entry. This was confirmed by the absence of immunoreactive signal with an antibody against the C terminus and the lack of a C-terminal sequence by gas chromatographymass spectrometry. Incubation with leptomycin B prior to hypoxia abolished nuclear HO-1 and the faster migrating band on Western analysis, suggesting that this process was facilitated by CRM1. Furthermore, preincubation with a cysteine protease inhibitor prevented nuclear entry of green fluorescent protein-labeled HO-1, demonstrating that protease-mediated C-terminal cleavage was also necessary for nuclear transport of HO-1. Nuclear localization was also associated with reduction of HO activity. HO-1 protein, whether it was enzymatically active or not, mediated activation of oxidant-responsive transcription factors, including activator protein-1. Nevertheless, nuclear HO-1 protected cells against hydrogen peroxide-mediated injury equally as well as cytoplasmic HO-1. We speculate that nuclear localization of HO-1 protein may serve to up-regulate genes that promote cytoprotection against oxidative stress.

It is highly inducible in response to various stimuli, including oxidative stress, heavy metals, UV radiation, and inflammation (1Alam J. Shibahara S. Smith A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6371-6375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Applegate L.A. Luscher P. Tyrrell R.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 974-978PubMed Google Scholar, 3Keyse S.M. Tyrrell R.M. Proc.

Cytoprotective roles for HO have been demonstrated in many models; however, the mechanisms by which this occurs are still under intensive study. Many have speculated that either heme catabolites, such as biliverdin, or its derivative, bilirubin, and carbon monoxide or the degradation of the pro-oxidant heme results in cytoprotection against oxidative stress (5Otterbein L.E.

Science. 1987; 235: 1043-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (2942) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, all of the by-products of the HO reaction, despite being potentially cytoprotective, are also cytotoxic. Bilirubin is a potent neurotoxin (8Brodersen R. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2364-2369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as is carbon monoxide (9Zhang J. Piantadosi C.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1193-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the HO reaction releases iron, which could interact with cellular oxidants to generate the hydroxyl radical (10Keyse S.M. Tyrrell R.M. Carcinogenesis. 1990; 11: 787-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Transfection with an inactive HO-1 mutant protein results in cytoprotection against chemically induced oxidative stress (11Hori R. Kashiba M. Toma T. Yachie A. Goda N. Makino N. Soejima A. Nagasawa T. Nakabayashi K. Suematsu M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10712-10718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Because this effect of the mutant HO-1 could not be attributable to changes in heme catabolites, it alludes to a role for the HO-1 protein itself. Furthermore, the inactive form of HO-1 increased catalase and glutathione content (11Hori R. Kashiba M. Toma T. Yachie A. Goda N. Makino N. Soejima A. Nagasawa T. Nakabayashi K. Suematsu M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10712-10718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This suggests that the HO-1 protein itself may play a role in cellular signaling. If this were true, HO-1 would need to migrate to the nucleus or produce nuclear changes that affect transcription. There are several examples of cytoplasmic enzymes serving in nuclear functions. The steroid regulatory element-binding protein is usually bound to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (sER) at its C terminus and locates to the nucleus after proteolytic cleavage (12Feramisco J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8487-8496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The amphitrophic protein, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase is activated when bound to the sER but is enzymatically inactive in a nuclear reservoir (13Cornell R.B. Northwood I.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 441-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The transcription factor ATF6 is a type II transmembrane (TM) glycoprotein that is usually anchored to the sER, but it can be proteolytically cleaved at its N terminus and migrate to the nucleus in response to ER stress (14Yoshida H. Okada T. Haze K. Yanagi H. Yura T. Negishi M. Mori K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6755-6767Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). HO-1 was first identified as an integral type I membrane protein of the sER, oriented such that most of the protein, including the active site, resides in the cytoplasm. A short C terminus resides within the lumen of the sER (15Yoshinaga T. Sassa S. Kappas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7803-7807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Translocation of HO-1 to the nucleus would require one or more proteolytic cleavages, on the cytosolic side of the TM region and/or within the TM domain to release a large HO-1 fragment, containing the N terminus, into the cytosol. In vitro experiments document tryptic cleavage of the C terminus of purified HO-1 protein (16Yoshida T. Ishikawa K. Sato M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Whether this occurs in intact cells is still unknown. Most proteins that migrate to the nucleus have nuclear localization sequences (NLSs) that are essential for nuclear uptake (reviewed in Ref. 17Schlenstedt G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, small proteins (less than 50 kDa) that lack an NLS do migrate to the nucleus (18Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). So far, no NLS has been identified on HO-1. In addition to NLSs, nuclear export sequences (NESs) are also important for the proper localization of some cytoplasmic proteins (19Connor M.K. Kotchetkov R. Cariou S. Resch A. Lupetti R. Beniston R.G. Melchior F. Hengst L. Slingerland J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). These are leucine-rich regions, which bind with the export receptor CRM1, forming a complex with Ran-GTP. This allows for passage through the nuclear pore (20Yan C. Lee L.H. Davis L.I. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7416-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Leptomycin-B (LMB) can inhibit the binding of CRM1 to the NES region (19Connor M.K. Kotchetkov R. Cariou S. Resch A. Lupetti R. Beniston R.G. Melchior F. Hengst L. Slingerland J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 20Yan C. Lee L.H. Davis L.I. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7416-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). This block in nuclear export results in a predominant nuclear expression of a protein. No one has evaluated whether HO-1 has a functional NES; however, there is a highly conserved region on the rat HO-1 protein at amino acids 207-221 (LNIELSEELQALL) with greater than 90% homology to the NES motif (LX1-3LX2-3LXL) on the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Rev protein (HIV-Rev), which binds to unspliced HIV-1 pre-mRNA and exports it from the nucleus (21Henderson B.R. Percipalle P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 693-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Once HO-1 accesses the nucleus, it is important to understand how it affects cellular functions. One likely signaling mechanism is modulation of gene transcription. Kravets et al. (22Kravets A. Hu Z. Miralem T. Torno M.D. Maines M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19916-19923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) reported that biliverdin reductase, which catalyzes reduction of the HO activity product, biliverdin, to bilirubin, can induce the expression of HO-1 protein, suggesting that various components of the bilirubin system could regulate the expression of genes in the pathway. This occurred through activation of transcription factors found within the genomic sequence upstream of the HO-1 gene. Distal enhancer 1 (DE1) and DE2 located at -4 and -10 kb upstream of the transcription start site, respectively, are critical for HO-1 induction by most oxidative stimuli, including heme, heavy metals, and hydrogen peroxide (2Applegate L.A. Luscher P. Tyrrell R.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 974-978PubMed Google Scholar, 23Alam J. Cook J.L. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2003; 9: 2499-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 24Keyse S.M. Applegate L.A. Tromvoukis Y. Tyrrell R.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4967-4969Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 25Ricchetti G.A. Williams L.M. Foxwell B.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2004; 76: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Both the DE1 and DE2 regions contain multiple stress-responsive elements that represent binding sites of regulatory proteins, such as activator protein (AP)-1, Jun, cAMP-response element-binding protein, Maf, and the Cap'n'collar/basic leucine zipper (CNC-bZIP) transcription factors (26Alam J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25049-25056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Alam J. Stewart D. Touchard C. Boinapally S. Choi A.M. Cook J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26071-26078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). Unlike biliverdin reductase, HO-1 is not a transcription factor; therefore, it is more likely to have an indirect effect on gene transcription, perhaps through modulation of transcription factor binding. Here, we demonstrate that, in response to three different stimuli (hypoxia (3% oxygen) or incubation with hemin or heme-hemopexin (H/HPX)), HO-1 can migrate to the nucleus. Nuclear translocation is associated with truncation of the C terminus of HO-1. In addition, a motif, which we term a putative “nuclear shuttling sequence (NSS),” is important for nuclear import of HO-1. Furthermore, C-terminal truncation of the protein and nuclear migration is also modified by proteolytic cleavage. Nuclear migration resulted in loss of HO activity. We further show that inntracytoplasmic delivery of HO-1 protein activated several transcription factors involved in oxidative stress and that delivery of HO-1 protein or transfection of HO-1 cDNA resulted in activation of a 15-kb oxidant-responsive HO-1 promoter attached to luciferase and protected against hydrogen peroxide-mediated injury, whether the HO-1 protein was active or not. The NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast (3T3) cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA). The cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic. Mouse hepatoma cells (Hepa) were cultured in DMEM containing 2% FBS and 0.5% gentamicin as described (28Smith A. Ledford B.E. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 941-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Human HEK293 cells were stably transfected with a FLAG tag at the N terminus of the rat HO-1 cDNA (293 FLAGHO-1) and were similarly maintained in DMEM as with the 3T3 cells. NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with a 15-kb oxidant-responsive HO-1 promoter-luciferase construct (3T3-HO-1/luc cells) were also maintained in DMEM. To obtain mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), mice heterozygous for HO-1 mutant allele were timely mated. Embryonic day 13.5 embryos were collected and minced in PBS. The minced tissue was placed in trypsin/EDTA and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The suspension was spun at 1000 rpm for 5 min at 10 °C. The pellet was resuspended in DMEM with 10% FBS, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic and plated on a cell culture flask. The medium was changed the next day to remove cellular debris. Cells were maintained at subconfluence by passaging every 3-4 days with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA. Approximately 48 h prior to the start of experiments, cells were plated to a confluence of 60-70%. All cells were grown in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C in 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks. Hypoxic Exposure—3T3 and the 293 FLAGHO-1 cells were exposed to hypoxia (3% O2) for 0-48 h. Incubation with Hemin in Vitro—3T3 cells were incubated with hemin 30 μm for 0-48 h. Incubation with H/HPX in Vitro—Intact rabbit hemopexin was purified, and stoichiometric 1:1 H/HPX complexes (>90-95% saturation) were characterized and quantitated using heme dissolved in Me2SO, as previously described (28Smith A. Ledford B.E. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 941-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 29Wilks A. Medzihradszky K.F. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2889-2896Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The extinction coefficients used were 1.1 × 105 m-1 cm-1 at 280 nm for apohemopexin, 1.2 × 105 m-1 cm-1 at 280 nm, and 1.4 × 105 m-1 cm-1 at 405 nm for rabbit mesoheme-hemopexin. Mesoheme was used, because it is more soluble than protoheme and has been shown to have similar biological and regulatory effects in the hemopexin system (30Morgan W.T. Alam J. Deaciuc V. Muster P. Tatum F.M. Smith A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8226-8231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heme-hemopexin complexes were dialyzed against PBS at 4 °C before use. While in exponential growth, Hepa cells were rinsed and then incubated for up to3hin serum-free HEPES-buffered DMEM, pH 7.4, supplemented with heme-hemopexin (10 μm), heme (10 μm), or equivalent volumes of their control solvents: PBS or Me2SO, respectively. Heme induction of HO-1 in whole cell extracts was used as a control. For this, cells were incubated in serum-free HEPES-buffered DMEM, pH 7.4, supplemented with heme (10 μm) for 3 h. This was performed according to published methods (31Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) with modifications (32Yang G. Abate A. George A.G. Weng Y.H. Dennery P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To determine which regions of the protein are responsible for nuclear localization, various rat HO-1 cDNA constructs were inserted into a pEGFP-c1 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). A mutant expressing an HO-1 protein lacking the C-terminal amino acids 267-289 fused to EGFP protein (EGFPHO-1CΔ23) was generated with appropriate primers (see Table 1). The PCR product was cloned into the BglII/BamHI site of the pEGFP-C1 vector.TABLE 1Primer sequences for HO-1 constructsHO-1 cDNA constructsPrimer sequencespEGFPHO-15′-TTCAGATCTATGGAGCGCCCACAGCAC-3′3′-TGGGAATTTATCGCATGTAAGGATCCACC-5′pEGFPHO-1CΔ235′-TTCAGATCTATGGAGCGCCCACAGCAC-3′3′-ACTAGTTCATCCCAGACACCGGGATCCACC-5′pEGFPHO-1ΔNSS5′-TTCAGATCTATGGAGCGCCCACAGCAC-3′ (first step)3′-AGAAGAGGCTAAGACCGCCTTCGGTACCTTA-5′5′-ATAGGTACCACAGAGGAACACAAAGACCA-3′ (second step)3′-TGGGAATTTATCGCATGTAAGGATCCACC-5′pEGFPHO-1CΔ23ΔNSS5′-TTCAGATCTATGGAGCGCCCACAGCAC-3′ (first step)3′-AGAAGAGGCTAAGACCGCCTTCGGTACCTTA-5′5′- ATAGGTACCACAGAGGAACACAAAGACCA -3′ (second step)3′-ACTAGTTCATCCCAGACACCGGGATCCACC-5′pEGFPHO-1ΔRandom5′-TTCAGATCTATGGAGCGCCCACAGCAC-3′ (first step)3′-TCTCAGGGGGTCAGGTCCTGGGTACCTTA-5′5′-ATAGGTACCATGGCCTTGCCAAGCTCT-3′ (second step)3′-TGGGAATTTATCGCATGTAAGGATCCACC-5′pcDNA3.1/HisHO-1myc5′-AGGATCCAGATGGAGCGCCCACAG-3′3′-GACTCGAGCCAGATCCTCTTCTGAGATG-3′pEGFP NSS5′-TTCAGCAGATCTTTCCTGCTCAACATTGAGCTGTTTGAGGAG CTGCAGGCACTGCTGACAGATATCGGTACCATCATA-3′3′-TATGATGGTACCGATATCTGTCAGCAGTGCCTGCAGCTCCTC AAACAGCTCAATGTTGAGCAGGAAAGATCTGCTGAA-5′ Open table in a new tab A mutant expressing HO-1 protein lacking amino acids 207-221 with >90% homology to a known NES (termed NSS; EGF-PHO-1ΔNSS) was also generated in a two-step process with PCR primer pairs (see Table 1). The first PCR product was cloned into the BglII/KpnI site, and the second PCR fragment was cloned into the KpnI/BamHI site of the pEGFP-c1 vector. A double deletion mutant lacking the C terminus and the NSS (EGFPHO-1CΔ23ΔNSS) was generated as above with substitution of the last PCR primer as shown in Table 1. Full-length rat HO-1 cDNA (1-867 bp) was amplified by PCR (see Table 1). The PCR product was cloned into the BamHI/XhoI site of pcDNA3.1/His (Invitrogen) to generate the HisHO1myc construct. The HisHO1myc fragment was then subcloned into p3XFLAGCMV (Sigma) to generate HisHO1FLAG. A rat HO-1 cDNA (HisHO1mutFLAG) expressing an enzymatically inactive HO-1 with a substitution of histidine 25 to alanine was derived from the HisHO1FLAG by PCR using a site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (QuikChange II; catalog number 200523-4). These constructs were verified by DNA sequencing and then transfected into 3T3 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The transfected cells were grown on slides and visualized by conventional fluorescence microscopy or laser confocal microscopy as previously described (33Dennery P.A. Spitz D.R. Yang G. Tatarov A. Lee C.S. Shegog M.L. Poss K.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1001-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Fluorescence in the 484 nm excitation and 510 nm emission ranges was used to detect EGFP. To test whether the NSS alone mediates compartmentalization of protein into the nucleus, an oligonucleotide containing the NSS sequence corresponding to amino acids 206-222 of rat HO-1 was generated (see Table 1). This sequence was fused to the C terminus of the EGFP protein (NSSEGFP), and the sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The NSS EGFP or EGFP were transiently transfected into the 3T3 cells. The localization of the EGFP protein was determined using immunocytostaining with the GFP antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene, OR). Co-staining with the cytoplasmic protein marker calnexin and nuclear marker 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was performed to demonstrate the subcellular localization using fluorescence microscopy. Cultured 3T3 cells were exposed to hypoxia as described above. The media were changed to DMEM containing 0.5% FBS. Cells were then incubated with a 50 μm concentration of the cysteine protease inhibitor E64d (catalog number E 3132; Sigma) 20 min prior to exposure to hypoxia. Cells were visualized by fluorescent microscopy after immunohistochemical staining with HO-1 antibodies. Cell lysates and nuclear extracts were also subjected to Western analysis. An antibody specific for the C-terminal amino acids of the HO-1 protein (M19) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). An N-terminal antibody to a 30-residue synthetic peptide based on the human HO-1 (SPA-896) was obtained from Stressgen (Assay Designs). In order to characterize the nuclear HO-1, 293 FLAGHO-1-transfected cells were exposed to hypoxia. The nuclear FLAGHO-1 was isolated and enriched using a FLAG affinity column as per the manufacturer's instruction (anti-FLAG M2; catalog number A 2220; Sigma). Molecular mass of the nuclear HO-1 was determined using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (ABI/PerSeptive Voyager DE-PRO MALDI-TOF; Framingham, MA). Identity of the protein was obtained by trypsin digestion of the colloidal blue-stained protein band followed by liquid chromatography/MS/MS analysis (ThermoElectron LTQ ion trap mass spectrometer; Wistar Proteomic Core Facility, Wistar institute, Philadelphia, PA). The resulting masses and MS/MS spectra were searched against the nonredundant NCBI data base using the TurboSEQUEST browser. Heme oxygenase activity was measured by detecting the amount of carbon monoxide generated from cell lysates, as previously described (34Vreman H.J. Stevenson D.K. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). A GST HO-1 fusion construct was expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (Invitrogen). Bacteria were grown to an OD of 0.6-0.8. Thereafter, the fusion protein was induced with 100 μm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C. After 5 h, bacteria were harvested and sonicated for 5 min. The fusion protein was purified using a GST purification module (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ten μg of GST HO-1 protein was delivered in the 3T3-HO-1/luc or MEF cells using the Pro-Ject™ system (Pierce) as per the manufacturer. Briefly, the Pro-Ject™ reagent was solubilized in 250 μl of methanol. The methanol was evaporated overnight under a sterile hood, and the dried Pro-Ject™ was stored at -20 °C until use. Purified HO-1 protein was diluted in PBS and added to the dried Pro-Ject™ reagent. After a 5-min incubation, the mixture was added to the cell culture medium with 5% serum. After 3 h, cells were washed with PBS and maintained in serum-free medium for the first4hofthe incubation. Thereafter, 5% FBS was reincorporated. In other experiments, purified mutant HO-1 protein (H25A) devoid of catalytic activity (gift of Paul Ortiz de Montellano, University of California, San Francisco) was delivered to the cells as described above. Transient transfection was performed in NIH3T3 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Briefly, 1 day before transfection, 105 cells were seeded in 24-well plates with antibiotic-free growth medium. DNA (0.8 μg) and 2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent were diluted into 50 μl of DMEM separately. After a 5-min incubation, the DNA and Lipofectamine solution were mixed and incubated for additional 20 min at room temperature. The DNA-Lipofectamine complex was then added to the cells. Cells were grown for 48 h before being subjected to assays. To determine whether HO-1 modulates cellular signaling, lysates from cells receiving GST-purified wild type and mutant HO-1 protein were evaluated for changes in transcription factor activation compared with controls. This was done using a commercially available kit (TransSignal™ Protein/DNA array I, Panomics, Redwood City, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This array did not include Nrf2 or Bach-1. Activations observed with the transcription factor array were verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using the appropriate transcription factor consensus DNA binding sequence. After protein delivery, cells were harvested, and the nuclear extract was obtained using a commercially available kit (Pierce) after the addition of a protease inhibitor mixture solution (Sigma). The 32P-labeled probes were incubated with 20 μg of the nuclear protein in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA, 80 mm KCl, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 4% Ficoll. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min and electrophoresed on 6% polyacrylamide gels. To distinguish nonspecific binding of the nuclear proteins, competition reactions were performed by adding either a 10- or 100-fold excess of nonradiolabeled probe or of a mutated probe to exclude nonspecific binding. Oligonucleotides with the consensus DNA binding sequences for the given transcription factors were synthesized by the PAN Facility at Stanford University (see Table 2).TABLE 2Transcription factor consensus sequences used for EMSATranscription factorConsensus binding sequenceMutant sequenceCBFaAll oligonucleotides other than AP-1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

The cultures were imaged using the IVIS (In Vivo Imaging System) camera system (Xenogen, Alameda, CA). Pseudoimages of the photon emission were generated, and light intensity was expressed as a ratio to cell counts, as previously described (32Yang G. Abate A. George A.G. Weng Y.H. Dennery P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). For comparison between treatment groups, the null hypothesis that there is no difference between treatment means was tested by a single factor analysis of variance for multiple groups or unpaired t test for two groups (Statview 4.02; SAS, Berkeley, CA). Statistical significance (p < 0.05 or p < 0.001) between and within groups was determined by means of the Fischer method of multiple comparisons. HO-1 Protein Localizes to the Nucleus after Hypoxic Exposure—In cultured 3T3 cells, nuclear localization of HO-1 protein was observed after hypoxic exposure (Fig. 1A). The HO-1 signal was enriched in the nucleus as with other known nuclear proteins, such as acetylated histone 3 and CRM1 (data not shown). In the sER, HO-1 is oriented such that most of the protein, including the active site, resides in the cytoplasm. A short C terminus resides within the lumen of the sER (35Yoshinaga T. Sassa S. Kappas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7778-7785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With hypoxic exposure, two HO-1 immunoreactive bands were observed upon Western analysis in the whole cell extract, with one band migrating at ∼28 kDa and the other migrating at 32 kDa (Fig. 1B). Using the M19 antibody directed toward the C terminus of HO-1, loss of all HO-1 immunoreactivity was noted in the nuclear extracts, whereas one immunoreactive band migrating at 32 kDa was observed in the whole cell extracts (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that the nuclear HO-1 immunoreactive form does not contain the C terminus. Lack of nuclear localization of the M19 immunoreactive signal by fluorescence microscopy provides further evidence that the nuclear form of HO-1 is devoid of the C terminus (Fig. 1C). HO-1 Protein Localizes to the Nucleus after Hemin or H/HPX Incubation—To address whether the generation of a nuclear form of HO-1 was a general phenomenon, we also investigated whether other known inducers of HO-1 had a similar effect on HO-1 nuclear migration as hypoxia. In cultured Hepa cells, increased signal intensity and nuclear localization of HO-1 immunoreactive protein was observed after incubation with 10 μm heme for 4 h or 20 μm H/HPX for 5 h (Fig. 2A). Using confocal microscopy and co-staining with propidium iodide, the M19 immunoreactive signal was never localized to the nucl"

We used mass spectrometry to obtain protein sequences from bones of a 160,000- to 600,000-year-old extinct mastodon ( Mammut americanum ) and a 68-million-year-old dinosaur ( Tyrannosaurus rex ). The presence of T. rex sequences indicates that their peptide bonds were remarkably stable. Mass spectrometry can thus be used to determine unique sequences from ancient organisms from peptide fragmentation patterns, a valuable tool to study the evolution and adaptation of ancient taxa from which genomic sequences are unlikely to be obtained."

The vibrational transitions associated with the shared proton, which provide a direct probe of this interaction, have been extensively studied in the condensed phase but have yielded only limited detailed information because of their diffuse character. We exploited recent advances in gas-phase ion spectroscopy to identify sharp spectral features that can be assigned to both the shared proton and the two tethered molecules in a survey of 18 cold, isolated [A.H+.B] ions. These data yield a picture of the intermolecular proton bond at a microscopic scale, facilitating analysis of its properties within the context of a floppy polyatomic molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2020280797,"The combinatorial action of separate cis-acting elements controls the cell-specific expression of type I collagen genes. In particular, we have shown that two short elements located between -3.2 and -2.3 kb and named TSE1 and TSE2 are needed for expression of the mouse COL1a1 gene in tendon fibroblasts. In this study, we analyzed the trans-acting factors binding to TSE1 and TSE2. Gel shift experiments showed that scleraxis (SCX), which is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is expressed selectively in tendon fibroblasts, binds TSE2, preferentially as a SCX/E47 heterodimer. In transfection experiments, overexpression of SCX and E47 strongly enhanced the activity of reporter constructs harboring either four copies of TSE2 cloned upstream of the COL1a1 minimal promoter or a 3.2-kb segment of the COL1a1 proximal promoter. Analysis of TSE1 showed that it contains a consensus binding site for NFATc transcription factors. This led us to show that the NFATc4 gene is expressed in tendons of developing mouse limbs and in TT-D6 cells, a cell line that has characteristics of tendon fibroblasts. In gel shift assays, TSE1 bound NFATc proteins present in nuclear extracts from TT-D6 cells. In transfection experiments, overexpression of NFATc transactivated a reporter construct harboring four copies of TSE1 cloned upstream of the COL1a1 minimal promoter. By contrast, inhibition of the nuclear translocation of NFATc proteins in TT-D6 cells strongly inhibited the expression of the COL1a1 gene.

Type I collagen is the most abundant extracellular matrix protein in vertebrates. It is composed of two α1 chains and one α2 chain that are coiled around each other in an uninterrupted triple helix. In the extracellular space, type I collagen molecules self-assemble into highly organized fibrils and then into fibers. The high tensile strength of these fibers is essential to provide mechanical strength to tissues and in particular to bone, tendon, and ligament. This is exemplified by the dramatic consequences of genetic diseases resulting from mutations in one of the genes encoding type I collagen, such as osteogenesis imperfecta or Ehlers-Danlos syndromes type VIIA and VIIB (1Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Ann. Med. 2001; 33: 7-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The hallmark of osteogenesis imperfecta is brittle bones, but the disease can also involve other tissues rich in type I collagen, such as ligaments, tendons, fascia, sclerae, and teeth. Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are characterized by skin hyperextensibility, vascular fragility, and increased ligament elasticity responsible for joint hypermobility. Although type I collagen is widely distributed throughout the body, it is produced by a discrete subset of cells, including fibroblasts, osteoblasts, and odontoblasts. Studies performed using transgenic mice harboring various segments of the mouse, rat, or human type I collagen promoters cloned upstream of a reporter gene have shown that the cell-specific expression of type I collagen genes is based on a modular organization of separate cell-specific cis-acting elements (2Pavlin D.

In particular, the segment of the mouse pro-α1(I) collagen (COL1a1) promoter located downstream of -2.3 kb induces high level expression of reporter genes in osteoblasts of transgenic mice, whereas the segment of COL1a1 located between -3.2 and -2.3 kb drives high level expression of the lacZ reporter gene specifically in tendon, ligament, and fascia fibroblasts (4Rossert J.

Analysis of this latter segment has shown that two short cis-acting elements, named TSE1 4The abbreviations used are: TSE1, tendon-specific element 1; SCX, scleraxis; AgE, E-box-containing sequence of the aggrecan promoter; bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; CsA, cyclosporin A; LacZ, E. coli β-galactosidase; TSE2, tendon-specific element 2; RT, reverse transcription; ANOVA, analysis of variance; DTT, dithiothreitol; E15.5, embryonic day 15.5. and TSE2, are necessary for activation of the COL1a1 promoter in tendon fibroblasts (8Terraz C. Brideau G. Ronco P. Rossert J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19019-19026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). TSE2 is located between -2,363 and -2,316 bp. It contains a consensus E-box (CACGTG) that is located at -2,325 bp, and it binds a tendon-specific nuclear protein (8Terraz C. Brideau G. Ronco P. Rossert J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19019-19026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). TSE1 is located between -2,845 and -2,741 bp, and its 3′-half is necessary for expression of the lacZ reporter gene in tendons of transgenic mice (8Terraz C. Brideau G. Ronco P. Rossert J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19019-19026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Molecular mechanisms responsible for the differentiation of mesenchymal cells into tendon fibroblasts are still largely unknown (9Edom-Vovard F. Duprez D. Dev. Dyn. 2004; 229: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Few DNA-binding proteins have a pattern of expression restricted to developing tendons, which suggests that they could regulate tendon cell fate. The Eya1, Eya2, and Six2 genes are expressed in limb tendons, with Eya1 and Six2 being largely restricted to the flexor tendons and Eya2 to the extensor tendons (10Oliver G. Wehr R. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Cheyette B.N. Hartenstein V. Zipursky S.L. Gruss P. Dreyer S.D. Naruse T. Morello R. Zabel B. Winterpacht A. Johnson R.L. Lee B. Oberg K.C.

Scleraxis (SCX), which is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors, is specifically expressed in tendons and ligaments, where it can be detected from early progenitor cells to mature fibroblasts (12Cserjesi P.

Cell. 2003; 113: 235-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). As most bHLH transcription factors that have a restricted pattern of expression, SCX heterodimerizes with the E2A gene products and binds E-boxes as SCX/E12 or SCX/E47 heterodimers (12Cserjesi P.

Recently, it has been shown that overexpression of SCX in tendon fibroblasts up-regulates the expression of the tenomodulin gene (17Shukunami C. Takimoto A. Oro M. Hiraki Y. Dev. Biol. 2006; 298: 234-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). This latter gene encodes a transmembrane protein that is expressed selectively in tendons, ligaments, and epimysium of skeletal muscle and can be considered as a phenotypic marker of tendon fibroblasts (18Shukunami C. Oshima Y. Hiraki Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, tenomodulin may not be a direct target of SCX. It has also been shown that a biologically active variant of Smad8 promotes the differentiation of C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal cells into tendon fibroblasts in the presence of bone morphogenetic protein 2, indicating that this Smad pathway is involved in the differentiation of mesenchymal cells into tendon fibroblasts (19Hoffmann A. Pelled G. Turgeman G. Eberle P. Zilberman Y. Shinar H. Keinan-Adamsky K. Winkel A. Shahab S. Navon G. Gross G. Gazit D. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 940-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In particular, it induced the expression of the SCX, EphA4, and COL1a1 genes. However, the genes that are direct targets of Smad8 have not been identified. The NFATc family of transcription factors is composed of five members, NFATc1/NFAT2/NFATc, NFATc2/NFAT1/NFATp, NFATc3/NFAT/NFATx, NFATc4/NFAT3, and the atypical member NFAT5. There is a tight regulation of the subcellular localization of these proteins through the action of calcineurin, a calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase. Under basal conditions, NFATc proteins are localized in the cytoplasm in a hyperphosphorylated latent form. Sustained increase in intracellular calcium concentration leads to calcineurin activation, and subsequently NFATc dephosphorylation and translocation into the nucleus where they bind to cis-acting elements (20Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 707-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar). Although originally described in immune cells, members of the NFATc family are expressed in many cell types outside of the immune system and are involved in processes such as heart valve development, chondrogenesis, skeletal muscle growth, and angiogenesis (21Crabtree G.R. Olson E.N. Cell. 2002; 109: S67-S79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar, 22Horsley V. Pavlath G.K. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that SCX binds TSE2, preferentially as a SCX/E47 heterodimer, and activates the COL1a1 proximal promoter in transient transfection experiments. We also show that DNA-binding proteins of the NFATc family are present in tendon fibroblasts, bind TSE1, and transactivate the COL1a1 proximal promoter in transient transfection experiments. Conversely, inhibition of the nuclear translocation of these proteins strongly decreases the expression of COL1a1 in tendon fibroblastic cells. Taken together, these data suggest that SCX and NFATc activate the COL1a1 gene in tendon fibroblasts, and are part of a regulatory network involved in differentiation of mesenchymal cells into tendon fibroblasts. DNA Constructs—For transfection experiments, various segments of the COL1a1 proximal promoter were cloned upstream of the lacZ gene in the placH reporter plasmid (4Rossert J. Eberspaecher H. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1421-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). pJ320 contains a segment of the COL1a1 promoter extending from -3,150 to +110 bp. p4TSE1mp contains four copies of TSE1 (i.e. the COL1a1 promoter sequence extending from -2,790 to -2,741 bp) cloned upstream of the COL1a1 minimal promoter that extends from -220 to +110 bp. p4TSE2mp contains four copies of TSE2 (i.e. the sequence of the COL1a1 promoter extending from -2,363 to -2,316 bp) cloned upstream of the COL1a1 minimal promoter. pJ320-MTSE2 is identical to pJ320, except that the E-box in TSE2 was mutated (CACGTG → GGATCC) by site-directed mutagenesis using the Quick-Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and following the manufacturer's instructions. The mouse cDNA encoding SCX (a gift from E. Olson, Southwestern University, Dallas, TX) was cloned in the pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen), which contains an Xpress tag upstream of the multiple cloning site, to generate pcDNA-SCX. The mouse cDNAs encoding E12 and E47 (a gift from C. Murre, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA) were cloned into the pCI expression vector (Promega), generating pCI-E12 and pCI-E47, respectively. The expression vectors pREP-NFATc1, pREP-NFATc3, and pREP-NFATc4 were given by C. Wilson (University of Washington, Seattle). pGL3 control vector (Promega), containing the SV40 promoter/enhancer cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene, was used as efficiency control for transfection experiments. Cell Cultures—NIH/3T3 fibroblasts and COS-7 cells were obtained from ATCC-LGC Promochem and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. C2 myoblastic cells, a gift of H. Alameddine (INSERM U582, Paris), were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with glutamax-I, 4.5 g/liter glucose, and 20% fetal bovine serum, at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. TT-D6 tendon fibroblasts were cultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 0.5% fetal bovine serum, at 33 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere (23Salingcarnboriboon R. Yoshitake H. Tsuji K. Obinata M. Amagasa T. Nifuji A. Noda M. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 287: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Gel Shift Assays—For gel shift assays, we used nuclear extracts from TT-D6 cells or from COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA, pCI, pcDNA-SCX, pCI-E47 or pcDNA-SCX, and pCI-E47. The nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously but were not dialyzed (24Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar). The probes were end-labeled by filling in with [α-32P]dCTP using the Klenow fragment of the Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (Invitrogen). The following double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides were used as probes or competitors: TSE1 (5′-GGTTGGGAAAATTTGGAGAGAGACAGAACTCAGAGCT-3′); TSE2 (5′-GGGAGTAGAGAGTGGCAGAGGAGGTCCTGAGCTGCAGCTCCATGCCACGTGTAAAGG-3′); ΔTSE1 (5′-GGTTGATTTGGAGAGAGACAGAACTCAGAGCT-3′); AgE (5′-GATCTCGGCTAGCATCTGACGCAGGTGCCGAGGGA-3′); IL-4wt (5′-GTACATTGGAAAATTTTATTACAC-3′); and IL-4mut (5′-TACATTCCTTAATTTTATTACAC-3′). To study the binding of SCX to TSE2, the TSE2 probe was incubated with 5 μg of nuclear extracts from transfected COS-7 cells for 30 min at room temperature in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 10 μm ZnSO4, 1 mm DTT, in the presence of 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Sigma). The complexes were fractionated on 4% polyacrylamide gels in 1× TBE. Because SCX binds the AgE sequence of the aggrecan promoter, we used it as a competitor (25Liu Y. Watanabe H. Nifuji A. Yamada Y. Olson E.N. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29880-29885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For competition experiments, a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were added to the reaction mixture. In some cases, nuclear extracts from COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA-SCX and pCI-E47 were preincubated with 2 μg of anti-Xpress antibody (Invitrogen) for 30 min at room temperature, before addition of labeled probe. To analyze the binding of NFATc proteins to TSE1, the TSE1 probe was incubated with 5 μg of nuclear extracts from TT-D6 cells, for 30 min at room temperature in a reaction mixture containing 50 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES, 0.05 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 100 ng of bovine serum albumin and in the presence of 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) (Sigma). Because NFATc proteins bind the IL-4wt sequence (26Hoey T. Sun Y.L. Williamson K. Xu X. Immunity. 1995; 2: 461-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), we used it as a competitor. The same sequence but with a mutated GGAAA motif (IL-4mut) was used as control. For competition experiments, different amounts of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were added to the reaction mixture. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide gels in 1× TBE. Transfection Experiments—Transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen) and following the manufacturer's instructions. For stable transfection experiments, NIH/3T3 fibroblasts were cotransfected in triplicate with linearized pJ320 plasmid and linearized plasmid expressing the neomycin resistance gene (pSVneo, Promega). Starting 48 h later, pools of resistant clones (NIH/3T3-pJ320 clones) were selected by treatment with G418 (Invitrogen). For transient transfection experiments, cells were cotransfected with various amounts of expression vectors, 100 ng of pGL3 control vector, and 900 ng of a lacZ reporter construct, except for the NIH/3T3-pJ320 cells that already harbored a reporter construct. Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were lysed in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 1 mm DTT, and the β-galactosidase and luciferase activities were assessed using the β-galactosidase reporter gene assay (Roche Diagnostics) and the luciferase assay system (Promega), respectively. For cells transiently transfected with a lacZ reporter construct, β-galactosidase activities were normalized to luciferase activities to compensate for variations in transfection efficiency. For the stably transfected NIH/3T3-pJ320 cells, β-galactosidase activities were normalized to the amount of protein. All transient transfection experiments were done in triplicate and repeated at least three times. RT-PCR Assays—To prepare total RNA, cells were lysed in TRIzol (Invitrogen), whereas tissue samples were homogenized in the presence of TRIzol. Total RNA was then isolated following the manufacturer's instructions and treated with DNase I (Invitrogen). It was reverse-transcribed using random primers (Invitrogen) and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). As a control, an RT reaction was always performed after omitting the reverse transcriptase. All RT reactions were tested for DNA contamination. PCRs specific for each NFATc were carried out for 30 cycles, using the primers listed in Table 1. To monitor the efficiency of the RT-PCRs, PCR with primers corresponding to the constitutively expressed β-actin gene (Table 1) were systematically performed.TABLE 1Sequences and annealing temperatures of the primers that were used in RT-PCR experimentsGenePrimerAnnealing temperature°CCOL1a1Forward, 5′–ATGTTCAGCTTTGTGGACCT–3′60Reverse, 5′–CAGCTGACTTCAGGGATGT–3′COL1a2Forward, 5′–GAACGGTCCACGATTGCATG–3′60Reverse, 5′–GGCATGTTGCTAGGCACGAAG–3′NFATc1Forward, 5′–CGGCGGGAAGAAGATGGTG–3′60Reverse, 5′–CTCTGGTTGCGGAAAGGTGGT–3′NFATc2Forward, 5′–CTTCTACTCTGGACCGCTTCT–3′60Reverse, 5′–GTGGGCTATCGCAGTTTCT–3′NFATc3Forward, 5′–CCCATTATGAAACTGAAGGT–3′60Reverse, 5′–CTGGCGATTATTATCTCTTGA–3′NFATc4Forward, 5′–GGAAGAGGCGGCGGTGAA–3′62Reverse, 5′–ACTGAAGGTAGGCGGGCACAA–3′β-actinForward, 5′–TGGCACCACACCTTCTACAA–3′60Reverse, 5′–ATGGCGTGAGGGAGAGCATA–3′ Open table in a new tab For real time RT-PCR experiments, PCR assays were performed in a LightCycler system (Roche Diagnostics), using the LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I kit, 0.3 μm of β-actin primers, and 0.4 μm of COL1a1 or COL1a2 primers (Table 1). Amplification of β-actin was used for normalization. Normalized data are expressed as a percentage of COL1a1 or COL1a2 mRNA expression in untreated cells. In some experiments, 70–80% confluent TT-D6 or NIH/3T3 cells were treated with different amounts of either cyclosporin A (CsA, Sandimmun®, Novartis) or INCA-6 (27Roehrl M.H. Kang S. Aramburu J. Wagner G. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7554-7559Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) before harvesting RNA. When INCA-6 was used, the medium containing INCA-6 was replaced by fresh cell culture medium after 1 h. Total RNA was extracted after 72 h when cells were treated with CsA or after 48 h when they were treated with INCA-6 and used for real time RT-PCR assays. All experiments were done in triplicate and repeated at least three times. Western Blot Experiments—For Western blot analyses, we used nuclear extracts from TT-D6 cells and NIH/3T3 fibroblasts, which were prepared as described above, and total cell lysates from COS-7 cells transfected with an expression vector encoding NFATc1, NFATc3, or NFATc4 as positive controls. Briefly, COS-7 cells were transfected with pREP-NFATc1, pREP-NFATc3, or pREP-NFATc4 as described above. After 48 h, the cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, supplemented with protease inhibitors. Then 25 μg of nuclear proteins or 10 μg of cell lysates were fractionated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond™-ECL™, Amersham Biosciences), incubated with a monoclonal antibody directed against the mouse NFATc1 (sc-7294, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), NFATc3 (sc-8405, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or NFATc4 (sc-13036, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) protein and then with a peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody. Specific immune complexes were visualized by chemiluminescence using the Western lightning chemiluminescence reagent plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In Situ Hybridization Experiments—E15.5 mouse embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for in situ hybridization to wax sections as described previously (28Edom-Vovard F. Schuler B.

Mech. Dev. 2005; 122: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The probes for NFATc1, NFATc3, and NFATc4 originate from the UNIGENE data base. Probes were transcribed in the presence of digoxigenin coupled to uridine. The digoxigenin-labeled probes were revealed by immunohistochemistry using nitro blue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indodyl phosphate (28Edom-Vovard F. Schuler B. Bonnin M.A. Teillet M.A. Duprez D. Dev. Biol. 2002; 247: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Differentiated muscle cells were detected after in situ hybridization using the MF20 monoclonal antibody against sarcomeric myosin heavy chain (Developmental Hybridoma Bank), a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and diaminobenzidine as substrate (28Edom-Vovard F. Schuler B. Bonnin M.A. Teillet M.A. Duprez D. Dev. Biol. 2002; 247: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Statistical Analyses—Results are presented as mean ± S.D. Statistical analyses were performed by one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc tests, or by unpaired Student's t test, as appropriate using Statview 5.0 software (SAS, Cary, NC). p values <0.05 were considered as significant. TSE2 Contains an E-box That Binds the Heterodimer Scleraxis/E47—Gel shift assays have shown that TSE2 binds a tendon-specific nuclear protein and that the binding site for this protein encompasses a consensus E-box (CACGTG) located at -2,325 bp (8Terraz C. Brideau G. Ronco P. Rossert J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19019-19026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because E-boxes are known to bind bHLH transcription factors, we speculated that TSE2 might bind SCX. To test this hypothesis, we performed gel shift assays using an end-labeled TSE2 probe. Because SCX can bind DNA as an homodimer or as a SCX/E12 or SCX/E47 heterodimer (12Cserjesi P. Brown D. Ligon K.L. Lyons G.E. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Olson E.N. Development (Camb.). 1995; 121: 1099-1110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Carlberg A.L. Tuan R.S. Hall D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 2000; 3: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), this probe was incubated with reticulocyte lysates containing SCX alone, SCX and E12, or SCX and E47. A retarded band was observed when TSE2 was incubated with reticulocyte lysates containing SCX plus E47 but not when it was incubated with reticulocyte lysates containing SCX plus E12 or containing only SCX, E47, or E12 (data not shown). Similar results were obtained when gel shift assays were repeated using TSE2 and nuclear extracts from COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA, pCI, pcDNA-SCX, pCI-E47, or pcDNA-SCX plus pCI-E47 (Fig. 1A). Incubation of TSE2 with nuclear extracts from COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA-SCX plus pCI-E47 (Fig. 1A, lane 5) induced the formation of a complex that was not observed with nuclear extracts from COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA (lane 1), pCI (lane 2), pcDNA-SCX (lane 3), or pCI-E47 (lane 4). This suggests that TSE2 binds the heterodimer SCX/E47. The presence of an Xpress tag at the N-terminal end of SCX enabled us to perform experiments in the presence of anti-Xpress antibodies. The addition of an anti-Xpress antibody (Invitrogen) to the reaction mixture largely decreased the formation of the retarded complex (Fig. 1A, lane 6). In addition, as shown in Fig. 1B, the shifted complex induced by incubation of TSE2 with nuclear extracts from COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA-SCX plus pCI-E47 was competed by addition of unlabeled TSE2 but also of unlabeled AgE. AgE is a sequence of the aggrecan promoter that has been shown to bind SCX. Taken together, these results indicate that TSE2 can bind SCX when it is heterodimerized with E47. The Binding of SCX/E47 Heterodimers to TSE2 Enhances the Activity of the COL1a1 Promoter—The ability of SCX/E47 heterodimers to bind TSE2 and enhance the activity of the COL1a1 minimal promoter was tested in transient transfection experiments. Eukaryotic expression vectors encoding SCX (pcDNA-SCX) and E47 (pCI-E47) were cotransfected with a reporter plasmid containing four copies of TSE2 cloned upstream of 220 bp of the mouse COL1a1 proximal promoter and of the lacZ reporter gene (p4TSE2mp), in NIH/3T3 cells. This 220-bp segment of the COL1a1 proximal promoter has been shown to have characteristics of a minimal promoter (6Rossert J.A. Chen S.S. Eberspaecher H. Smith C.N. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1027-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The NIH/3T3 cells are embryonic fibroblastic cells that synthesize type I collagen but do not express SCX (data not shown). Cotransfection of pcDNA-SCX plus pCI-E47 induced a strong and dose-dependent increase in the levels of expression of p4TSE2mp (Fig. 2A). When 200 ng of each of these two expression vectors were cotransfected, the levels of expression of p4TSE2mp were increased about 15-fold. Transfection of pcDNA-SCX had significant but weaker enhancing effects (Fig. 2A). Transfection of E47 had almost no transactivating effects (Fig. 2A). Transfection experiments were then repeated using pJ320 instead of p4TSE2mp. pJ320 contains a 3.2-kb segment of the mouse COL1a1 proximal promoter cloned upstream of the lacZ reporter gene, and it is expressed at high levels in tendons and ligaments of transgenic mice (4Rossert J.

The alpha and beta polypeptide chains form the six catalytic domains required for fatty acid synthesis and numerous expansion segments responsible for extensive intersubunit connections. Detailed views of all active sites provide insights into substrate specificities and catalytic mechanisms and reveal their unique characteristics, which are due to the integration into the multienzyme. The mode of acyl carrier protein attachment in the reaction chamber, together with the spatial distribution of active sites, suggests that iterative substrate shuttling is achieved by a relatively restricted circular motion of the carrier domain in the multifunctional enzyme."

The results indicate that collagen I, the main organic component of bone, has been preserved in low concentrations in these tissues. The findings were independently confirmed by mass spectrometry. We propose a possible chemical pathway that may contribute to this preservation. The presence of endogenous protein in dinosaur bone may validate hypotheses about evolutionary relationships, rates, and patterns of molecular change and degradation, as well as the chemical stability of molecules over time."
https://openalex.org/W2005749687,"Necrotic cells release inflammatory mediators that activate cytokine production from innate immune cells. One mediator of this activation is high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1). HMGB1 is normally a chromatin-associated protein and is sequestered at condensed chromatin during apoptosis. How it is released from chromatin during necrotic cell death is not known. Here we show that after DNA-alkylating damage, the activation of poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP) regulates the translocation of HMGB1 from the nucleus to the cytosol. This displaced HMGB1 is subject to release if the cell then loses plasma membrane integrity as a result of necrosis. Both full-length HMGB1 and a truncated form of HMGB1 lacking the highly conserved glutamate-rich C-terminal tail can induce macrophage activation and tumor necrosis factor-α production. However, displacement of HMGB1 from the nucleus following PARP activation requires the presence of the glutamate-rich C-terminal tail. Although the C-terminal tail is not the sole substrate for PARP modification of HMGB1, it appears to be required to destabilize HMGB1 association with chromatin following PARP-dependent chromatin modifications.

However, most cancer cells harbor defects in apoptotic signaling pathways (1Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22628) Google Scholar) and are still effectively treated with DNA-damaging agents. By studying cells that are deficient in Bax and Bak, key regulators of apoptosis, we have previously shown that DNA-alkylating agents are effective inducers of non-apoptotic cell death (2Zong W.X. Ditsworth D. Bauer D.E. Wang Z.Q. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1272-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar).

PARP is a nuclear enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of ADP-ribose moieties from NAD+ to itself and other acceptor proteins in response to DNA damage (3Kim M.Y. Zhang T. Kraus W.L. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1951-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Of the many PARP family members, PARP-1 accounts for ∼90% of the poly(ADP)-ribosylation reactions in the cell (4Smith S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 174-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Although PARP initially functions to alter chromatin structure and facilitate DNA repair following low levels of DNA damage, sustained PARP activity can lead to depletion of nuclear-cytosolic NAD+ and subsequent necrotic cell death. Parp-1-/- cells are initially protected from alkylating DNA damage but ultimately undergo apoptosis. Interestingly, following alkylating DNA damage, medium from parp-1-/- cells lacks the ability to stimulate inflammation (2Zong W.X. Ditsworth D. Bauer D.E. Wang Z.Q. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1272-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). High mobility group protein 1 (HMGB1) is a nuclear protein that when released into the extracellular space can elicit a potent inflammatory response (5Scaffidi P. Misteli T. Bianchi M.E. Nature. 2002; 418: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (3394) Google Scholar). Originally identified as an architectural chromatin-associated protein, HMGB1 contains two HMG box domains and an acidic C terminus, binding DNA and nucleosomes without sequence specificity. Although other family members HMGB2 and HMGB3 are restricted to expression primarily during embryonic development, HMGB1 is nearly ubiquitously expressed and is one of the most abundant proteins in the nucleus (6Thomas J.O. Travers A.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 167-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 7Travers A.A. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In healthy cells, HMGB1 moves between chromatin bound and unbound states and serves many purposes in the nucleus, facilitating transcription factor binding, nucleosome remodeling (8Bonaldi T. Langst G. Strohner R. Becker P.B. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6865-6873Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and DNA repair processes (9Bergeron S. Madathiparambil T. Swanson P.C. J. Biol.

Following apoptosis, HMGB1 has been shown to be selectively retained in the nucleus by condensed chromatin (5Scaffidi P. Misteli T. Bianchi M.E. Nature. 2002; 418: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (3394) Google Scholar). However, necrotic cells have been reported to release HMGB1 into the extracellular space. HMGB1 is thought to be a key mediator of inflammation because necrotic hmgb1-/- cells are unable to activate macrophages (5Scaffidi P. Misteli T. Bianchi M.E. Nature. 2002; 418: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (3394) Google Scholar). Once outside the cell, HMGB1 can mediate inflammation through binding a variety of receptors on innate immune cells (11Lotze M.T. Tracey K.J. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar). HMGB1 is one of a few endogenous danger signals that can alert the innate immune system of self-injury, among others such as uric acid and heat shock proteins (12Skoberne M. Beignon A.S. Bhardwaj N. Trends Mol. Med. 2004; 10: 251-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Extracellular HMGB1 directly binds the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) (13Merenmies J. Pihlaskari R. Laitinen J. Wartiovaara J. Rauvala H. J. Biol.

In myeloid cells, HMGB1 secretion is thought to be regulated by acetylation and relocalization to secretory lysosomes (21Bonaldi T. Talamo F. Scaffidi P. Ferrera D. Porto A. Bachi A. Rubartelli A.

Because of this paracrine feedback loop, extracellular HMGB1 greatly amplifies an inflammatory response. The clinical implications of blocking extracellular HMGB1 signaling have recently been appreciated as monoclonal antibodies against HMGB1 can protect against sepsis and other conditions in preclinical models (19Wang H.

Although HMGB1 release from cells undergoing necrosis is believed to occur through passive diffusion, the mechanism by which HMGB1 is released from chromatin during necrosis remains an open question.

Interleukin-3-(IL-3)-dependent bax-/-bak-/- hematopoietic cells and the murine pro-B cell line FL5.12 were cultured as described previously (2Zong W.X. Ditsworth D. Bauer D.E. Wang Z.Q. Thompson C.B.

For IL-3 withdrawal experiments, cells were washed three times in RPMI alone and then resuspended in complete medium lacking IL-3 and cultured for 11 days prior to treatment. Cell viability was assessed by exclusion of 1 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) (Molecular Probes) using a FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Cells were treated with 1-methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG, Sigma) as described in Ref. 2Zong W.X. Ditsworth D. Bauer D.E. Wang Z.Q. Thompson C.B.

Briefly, cells were treated with 0.5 mm MNNG for 15 min and then washed and fed with fresh medium containing no MNNG for indicated periods of time. PARP inhibitor 1,5-isoquinolinediol (DHIQ, Sigma) (300 μm) was added 30 min prior to MNNG and kept in the medium throughout the course of the experiment when used. In experiments testing the conditioned medium, cells were cultured in a reduced volume of medium after treatment (∼1.5 × 106 cells/ml for suspension cells, ∼700 μl/well for adherent cells in 6-well plates), supernatants were centrifuged to clear intact cells, and samples containing equal volumes were prepared for immunoblotting. When indicated, cells were pretreated with leptomycin B (20 ng/ml, Sigma) for 1 h prior to the addition of MNNG, washed at 15 min, and then replenished with medium containing leptomycin B. MEFs were transiently transfected with plasmids using Geneporter2 (Gene Therapy Systems) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Transfection in FL5.12 and IL-3-dependent bax-/-bak-/- cells was performed using the Nucleofector system (Amaxa). Single cell clones were generated by limited dilution following selection with Blasticidin (5 μg/ml). Plasmids—All constructs were generated by reverse transcription-PCR of total RNA from FL5.12 cells.

For protein expression, full-length and truncated HMGB1 were generated using reverse primers 5′-GCGGATCCTTATTCATCATCATCATCTTC-3′ for full-length HMGB1 or 5′-GCGGATCCTTACTTCTTTTTCTTGCTCTT-3′ for HMGB1-ΔC, with the same forward primer as above. All untagged constructs were expressed in the pEF6/V5-His-TOPO vector and then subcloned into the His6 N-terminal tagged expression vector pET16b (Novagen) using XhoI/BamH1 sites for HMGB1. All constructs were verified by nucleotide sequencing. Cell Lysis and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% sodium deoxycholine, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris at pH 8.0, 0.14 m NaCl) with protease inhibitor complex (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentration was determined using BCA protein assay reagents (Pierce). Samples were loaded onto precast 4-12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) at 10 or 20 μg/well, and Western blotting was performed with the following antibodies: HMGB1 (BD Biosciences or Abcam), PAR (BD Biosciences), PARP (clone C2-10, BD Biosciences), tubulin (Sigma), FLAG (M2 or rabbit, Sigma), actin (I-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), His probe (H-15, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), streptavidin (Upstate Biotechnology), and nucleolin (H-250, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunofluorescence—For immunofluorescence of suspension cells, at each experimental time point, 50,000 cells were placed onto multiple tissue culture grade coverslips in a 24-well plate and centrifuged for 5 min at 1500 rpm prior to fixation. For immunofluorescence of adherent cells, cells were seeded onto glass coverslips prior to experimentation, and at each time point, they were transferred to a 24-well plate with medium containing propidium iodide for 5 min. After dipping coverslips in PBS, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and washed in PBS containing 0.02% Triton, 1.5% FBS. For both cell types, permeabilized cells were incubated with antibodies against HMGB1 (1:500, Abcam) or FLAG (1:400, M2, Sigma). Cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:100, Jackson ImmunoResearch or Molecular Probes) or counterstained for actin using TRITC-phalloidin (1:500, Chemicon). Nuclei were visualized by staining with 1 μg/ml DAPI. Cells were imaged using ×100 oil immersion lens on a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope. For scoring, HMGB1 localization was determined to be nuclear or diffuse regardless of PI staining, and mitotic cells were excluded. At least 300 cells were counted per sample in each experiment. Cell Fractionation—Suspension cells (4 × 107 cells) or adherent cells (1 × 107 cells) were treated with MNNG for each time point. Cells were resuspended in five pellet volumes of hypotonic buffer A (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1× protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)) on ice for 20 min. Cells were disrupted by passing through 23-gauge needles 20 times or until complete lysis as determined by trypan blue exclusion. Cells were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C and then saved as the cytosol fraction. The pellet was resuspended in two pellet volumes of buffer B (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 0.42 m NaCl, 2.5% v/v glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1× protease inhibitors) and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C while rotating at 60 rpm. The sample was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was saved as the nuclear fraction. Samples were prepared with equivalent protein amounts for immunoblotting. Protein Expression and Purification—Bacterially produced His-tagged HMGB1 full-length and truncated proteins were expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli and purified according to Ref. 26Muller S. Bianchi M.E. Knapp S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10254-10261Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar. Purified His-Bcl-xL was generated by similar methods according to Ref. 27White C. Li C. Yang J.

Briefly, Luria broth containing carbenicillin (50 μg/ml) was inoculated with a freshly transformed colony and grown overnight at 37 °C with shaking. The culture was gradually increased to a volume of 1 liter and allowed to grow until reaching optical density A595 ∼ 0.7. Cultures were then induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a final concentration of 0.5 mm and continued growth for 4 h at 37 °C with shaking. Cells were pelleted at 5000 rpm and lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm imidazole, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail. Purification of His6-tagged HMGB1 proteins was performed using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads according to the QIAexpressionist protocol (Qiagen). His-tagged protein was eluted from the column using increasing concentrations of imidazole, and fractions containing protein were dialyzed overnight in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, 20% glycerol, pH 7.2. Final protein concentration was approximated by comparison with bovine serum albumin standards on a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel, using NIH Image J to quantitate band optical density. In Vitro Poly(ADP)-ribosylation Assay—For in vitro poly-(ADP)-ribosylation assays, we adapted methods from previous studies (28Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar), using 6-biotin-17-nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotide (biotin-NAD) instead of [32P]NAD (29Zhang J. Snyder S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2228-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Reactions included 0.3 μg each of purified recombinant His-HMGB1-FL, His-HMGB1-ΔC, or His-Bcl-xL or 1 μg of histone H1 (purified calf thymus, Calbiochem) as substrates. The final reaction was performed in a 50-μl mix containing buffer 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm MgCl2, adding 5 μg of PARP-activated DNA (R&D), 20 μm biotin-NAD (R&D), or 1 mm NAD+ (Calbiochem) and 300 μm DHIQ where indicated. PARP (1 μl, R&D, high specific activity enzyme) was the last component added to each reaction, and mixed samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. To stop the reaction, SDS loading dye was added, and samples were boiled for 5 min prior to loading on 8-16% Tris-Glycine or 4-12% Bis-Tris precast gels (Invitrogen). Proteins modified by biotin-NAD were detected by immunoblot with streptavidin antibody (Upstate Biotechnology), or samples were loaded for Coomassie Blue staining or immunoblot with the indicated antibodies. Cell-based Poly(ADP)-ribosylation Assay—In cells, PAR-modified proteins were detected using biotin-NAD with FLAG immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting for streptavidin, based on previous studies that used biotin-NAD for immunofluorescence (30Bakondi E. Bai P. Szabo E.E. Hunyadi J. Gergely P. Szabo C. Virag L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 50: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed in stable clones derived from bax-/-bak-/- IL-3-dependent cells or FL5.12 cells expressing FLAG-HMGB1-FL, FLAG-HMGB1-ΔC, and FLAG-α4. For each sample, 1 × 107 cells were resuspended in 100 μl of PARP buffer (56 mm Hepes, 28 mm KCl, 28 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2), which was freshly supplemented with 0.01% digitonin (Calbiochem) and 50 μm biotin-NAD (R&D Systems). Samples were preincubated in buffer alone or in buffer containing 300 μm DHIQ for 30 min prior to the addition of 500 μm MNNG for the indicated times at 37 °C. Following treatment, cells were lysed with 250 μl of buffer IP-400 (400 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% deoxycholate, 1× protease inhibitor cocktail) and incubated on ice for 20 min. Samples were then diluted 1:1 v/v with IP-0 buffer (containing no NaCl) for a final concentration of 200 mm NaCl. Lysates were sonicated at 20% output for 10 s and then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Samples were incubated with pre-equilibrated M2 agarose beads (Sigma) while rotating overnight at 4 °C. After washing the beads with IP buffer containing 200 mm NaCl five times, beads were resuspended in 1× SDS dye and boiled prior to loading on 4-12% Bis-Tris NuPAGE gels for immunoblotting with antibodies against streptavidin or FLAG. Stimulation of RAW Macrophages—RAW264.7 cells were treated with fresh medium containing His-HMGB1-FL or -ΔC at 1 μg/ml or lipopolysaccharide (Sigma L4516) at 0.1 μg/ml, each in the presence of brefeldin A (2 μg/ml). Four hours following stimulation, RAW cells were harvested and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. After washing cells twice with PBS containing 1% FBS, cells were permeabilized in PBS containing 1% FBS, 0.2% saponin, 0.1% NaAc for 15 min at 4 °C. Immunostaining was performed using 1:100 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated TNF-α antibody (BD Biosciences) in permeabilization buffer, and intracellular TNF-α content was assessed by flow cytometry. Statistical Analysis—All data are presented as the mean ± S.D. Differences between means were considered significant when p < 0.05 using the Student's t test. HMGB1 Translocates from the Nucleus to the Cytoplasm following Alkylating DNA Damage—The nuclear protein HMGB1 has been reported to be found in the supernatant of cells treated with alkylating agents such as MNNG (2Zong W.X. Ditsworth D. Bauer D.E. Wang Z.Q. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1272-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). However, it was unclear whether HMGB1 release is an active or a passive process. To explore this question, we investigated whether HMGB1 undergoes evidence of nuclear-cytosolic relocalization in response to treatment with DNA-alkylating drugs, utilizing a cell culture model that allows prolonged cell viability following DNA damage (Fig. 1). Upon growth factor withdrawal, IL-3-dependent Bax/Bak-deficient cells were protected from DNA-damage induced cell death because of their quiescent metabolic status (Fig. 1A) (2Zong W.X. Ditsworth D. Bauer D.E. Wang Z.Q. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1272-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 31Bauer D.E. Harris M.H. Plas D.R. Lum J.J. Hammerman P.S. Rathmell J.C. Riley J.L. Thompson C.B. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1303-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To detect the relative amount of HMGB1 released into the extracellular space of proliferating or vegetative cells following MNNG treatment, immunoblotting was performed on cell culture medium. The appearance of HMGB1 in the medium occurred within 5 h after MNNG treatment in proliferating cells but not in vegetative cells (Fig. 1B). HMGB1 appearance in the medium correlated with time of cell death as measured by PI exclusion, indicating loss of plasma membrane integrity (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, relocalization of HMGB1 from the nucleus to the cytosol occurred equally in proliferating and vegetative cells following MNNG treatment (Fig. 1, C and D). HMGB1 exhibited a primarily nuclear localization in untreated cells and appears aqua in the overlay used to quantitate redistribution because of the merged green fluorescence of the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody used to detect HMGB1 and the blue fluorescence of the DNA-bound DAPI. At early time points following MNNG treatment, ∼35-40% of cells showed a loss of nuclear HMGB1 staining in both +IL-3 and -IL-3 conditions (arrows, blue in overlay images). In both populations, this redistribution was apparent at 0.5 and 2 h after treatment with MNNG, although over 90% of cells excluded PI and thus had intact plasma membranes. This relocalization of HMGB1 from the nucleus to the cytosol following MNNG treatment was not restricted to hematopoietic cells and was observed in MEFs as well (Fig. 2). Although MNNG treatment killed proliferating cells much more effectively, MNNG treatment resulted in equivalent HMGB1 relocalization in both proliferating and vegetative cells with similar kinetics. In addition, both populations displayed similar levels of PARP activation. In both conditions, poly(ADP)-ribosylation levels were increased at 30 min after MNNG and returned to basal levels by 8 h (Fig. 1E). Subcellular Relocalization of HMGB1 during Necrosis Is PARP-dependent—Previous work has shown that MNNG-induced cell death and inflammation are PARP-dependent (2Zong W.X. Ditsworth D. Bauer D.E. Wang Z.Q. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1272-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). To determine whether PARP-1 regulates subcellular relocalization of HMGB1 after MNNG treatment, immunofluorescence was performed in parp-1-/- MEFs or in wild-type MEFs in the presence of the general PARP inhibitor DHIQ. Following MNNG treatment, redistribution of HMGB1 was observed in wild-type cells, whereas HMGB1 remained nuclear in cells lacking PARP-1 (Fig. 2A). Visualization of HMGB1 in adherent cells provided additional examples where cytosolic HMGB1 staining occurred in cells that remained PI-negative (arrow) or where HMGB1 nuclear staining was lost or dim in cells that were PI-positive (arrowheads). Cytosolic HMGB1 staining was not observed in cells lacking PARP activity. Although a few cells exhibited loss of nuclear HMGB1 in the absence of PARP-1, these cells had dim or no staining. Consistent with cell viability following MNNG treatment, the relative amount of HMGB1 found in the culture medium was reduced by PARP inhibitors or in parp-1-/- MEFs (Fig. 2B). PARP Modifies Both Full-length and Truncated HMGB1 in Vitro—HMGB1 and other high mobility group proteins have previously been characterized as acceptor proteins for poly(ADP)-ribosylation (32Poirier G.G. Niedergang C. Champagne M. Mazen A. Mandel P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 127: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 33Tanuma S. Johnson G.S. J. Biol.

We next sought to determine whether PARP regulates HMGB1 localization via direct modification. The amino acid sequence of HMGB1 contains a highly conserved stretch of 30 glutamate and aspartic acid residues at the C terminus (Fig. 3A). Since PARP primarily modifies itself and other proteins at glutamate residues (35Ogata N. Ueda K. Hayaishi O. J. Biol. Chem. 19"
https://openalex.org/W2001860318,"Cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) is a key enzyme in the trans-sulfuration pathway, which uses l-cysteine to produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Functional changes of pancreatic beta cells induced by endogenous H2S have been reported, but the effect of the CSE/H2S system on pancreatic beta cell survival has not been known. In this study, we demonstrate that H2Sat physiologically relevant concentrations induced apoptosis of INS-1E cells, an insulin-secreting beta cell line. Transfection of INS-1E cells with a recombinant defective adenovirus containing the CSE gene (Ad-CSE) resulted in a significant increase in CSE expression and H2S production. Ad-CSE transfection also stimulated apoptosis. The other two end products of CSE-catalyzed enzymatic reaction, ammonium and pyruvate, had no effects on INS-1E cell apoptosis, indicating that overexpression of CSE may stimulate INS-1E cell apoptosis via increased endogenous production of H2S. Both exogenous H2S (100 μm) and Ad-CSE transfection inhibited ERK1/2 but activated p38 MAPK. Interestingly, BiP and CHOP, two indicators of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, were up-regulated in H2S-and CSE-mediated apoptosis in INS-1E cells. After suppressing CHOP mRNA expression, H2S-induced apoptosis of INS-1E cells was significantly decreased. Inhibition of p38 MAPK, but not of ERK1/2, inhibited the expression of BiP and CHOP and decreased H2S-stimulated apoptosis, suggesting that p38 MAPK activation functions upstream of ER stress to initiate H2S-induced apoptosis. It is concluded that H2S induces apoptosis of insulin-secreting beta cells by enhancing ER stress via p38 MAPK activation. Our findings may help unmask a novel role of CSE/H2S system in regulating pancreatic functions under physiological condition and in diabetes.

Endogenous productions of H2S in different organs and tissues as well as the circulatory concentration of H2S have been elucidated, and the physiological importance of H2S has gained increasing recognition (2.Wang R.

Vence L. Benoist C. Nature. 2001; 414: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Any change in beta cell mass must reflect an imbalance between proliferation (neogenesis or replication) and cell death (necrosis or apoptosis) (7.Scaglia L. Cahill C.J. Finegood D.T. Bonner-Weir S. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1736-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Excessive loss of beta cells constitutes one of the causes of diabetes, and apoptosis is considered to be the main mode of beta cell death in type I and type II diabetes (8.Lipson K.L. Fonseca S.G. Urano F. Curr. Mol. Med. 2006; 6: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In recent years, pathophysiological implications of the CSE/H2S system in diabetes have been reported (9.Jia X. Yang W. Jakic Z. Wang R. Wu L. Can. J. Cardiol. 2004; 20: 56Google Scholar, 10.Yusuf M. Kwong-Huat B.T. Hsu A. Whiteman M. Bhatia M. Moore P.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Endogenous production of H2S together with the expression of CSE and cystathionine β-synthase (CBS), another H2S-producing enzyme, was identified in rat pancreatic tissues (9.Jia X. Yang W. Jakic Z. Wang R. Wu L. Can. J. Cardiol. 2004; 20: 56Google Scholar, 10.Yusuf M. Kwong-Huat B.T. Hsu A. Whiteman M. Bhatia M. Moore P.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

CSE mRNA expression and H2S formation in the rat pancreas were significantly increased after diabetes induction by streptozotocin injection (10.Yusuf M. Kwong-Huat B.T. Hsu A. Whiteman M. Bhatia M. Moore P.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 1146-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Pancreatic H2S level in Zuker diabetic fatty rats was significantly higher than that in nondiabetic Zuker fatty rats (9.Jia X. Yang W. Jakic Z. Wang R. Wu L. Can. J. Cardiol. 2004; 20: 56Google Scholar). Inhibition of CSE activity by dl-propargylglycine (PPG) significantly decreased production of H2S and increased plasma insulin levels in Zuker diabetic fatty rats (9.Jia X. Yang W. Jakic Z. Wang R. Wu L. Can. J. Cardiol. 2004; 20: 56Google Scholar). Increased CSE and CBS activity or decreased homocysteine levels in diabetic animals and human have also been observed in different laboratories (10.Yusuf M. Kwong-Huat B.T. Hsu A. Whiteman M.

In vitro studies showed that incubation of INS-1E cells (an insulin-secreting beta cell line) with H2S drastically decreased insulin secretion because of the activation of plasma ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels (14.Yang W. Yang G. Jia X. Wu L. Wang R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 569: 519-531Crossref Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Given the importance of pancreatic β cell mass for the pathogenesis of diabetes and altered endogenous pancreatic production of H2S in diabetes, it becomes imperative to understand whether the apoptotic status of pancreatic β cells is regulated by H2S and the underlying signaling cascade.In this study, we overexpressed the CSE gene in INS-1E cells using a highly effective replication-deficient adenovirus expression system. The successful adenovirus-mediated overexpression of CSE was confirmed by measuring CSE protein levels and endogenous H2S production. Cell survival was examined and compared after the increased CSE expression. Whether CSE overexpression-induced changes in cell survival were because of overproduced H2S was determined and compared with the effect of exogenously applied H2S. Finally, the involvement of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress on the effect of the CSE/H2S system on INS-1E cell apoptosis was examined. Our findings support the hypothesis that H2S plays a fundamental role in regulating pancreatic β cell apoptosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture−INS1-E cells derived from a rat insulinoma (kindly provided by Dr. C. B. Wollheim, Geneva, Switzerland) were cultured with RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, as described previously (14.Yang W. Yang G. Jia X. Wu L. Wang R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 569: 519-531Crossref Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The experiments were performed when the cells reached 70-80% confluence between passages 56 and 70. In all studies, cells were first incubated in the serum-free medium for 12 h and then 10% serum added together with different treatments.Construction of a Recombinant CSE Adenovirus and Gene Transfer−Recombinant adenovirus containing the CSE gene (Ad-CSE) was prepared as described previously (14.Yang W. Yang G. Jia X. Wu L. Wang R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 569: 519-531Crossref Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The recombinant adenovirus encoding bacterial β-galactosidase (Ad-lacZ) derived from the same vector was used as control. For adenoviral transfection, subconfluent INS-1E cells were incubated with Ad-CSE or Ad-lacZ at 50 multiplicities of infection (m.o.i.) in serum-free media (14.Yang W. Yang G. Jia X. Wu L. Wang R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 569: 519-531Crossref Scopus (413) Google Scholar). After 4 h of incubation, media were removed, and cells were incubated in appropriate media for another 44 h.Cellular Viability Assays−Cell viabilities were assessed based on conversion of trazolium salt 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) to formazan, according to manufacturer’s instruction (CellTiter96®, Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, cells at equal number were plated onto each well of 96-well plates for 24 h. At different time points after treatment with different concentrations of H2S or transfection with adenovirus, 0.5 mg/ml MTT was added to each well. The cells were then cultured at 37 °C for 4 h, and absorbance of formazan products at 570 nm was measured in a Multiskan spectrum microplate spectrophotometer (Thermo Labsystems, Frankin, MA). The cells incubated with control medium were considered 100% viable.Apoptosis Assays−Apoptosis was monitored by measuring nuclear condensation by Hoechst 33258 staining and DNA fragmentation by the terminal deoxyribonucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL), and DNA electrophoresis was performed on 1.8% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide as described previously (15.Yang G. Sun X. Wang R. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1782-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar).GSH Level Measurement−GSH levels were determined by using the high pressure liquid chromatography method described as before (16.Wu L. Noyan Ashraf M.H. Facci M. Wang R. Paterson P.G. Ferrie A. Juurlink B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 18: 7094-7099Crossref Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Protein content was determined by using the bicinchoninic acid procedure with bovine serum albumin as reference.Measurement of H2S Production and Concentration−H2S production rate was measured as described previously (4.Zhao W. Zhang J. Lu Y. Wang R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6008-6016Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar, 17.Siegel M. Anal. Biochem. 1965; 11: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Briefly, after different treatments, the cells were collected and homogenized in 50 mm ice-cold potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). The flasks containing reaction mixture (100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, 10 mml-cysteine, 2 mm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, and 10% (w/v) cell homogenates) and center wells containing 0.5 ml 1% zinc acetate and a piece of filter paper (2 × 2 cm) were flushed with N2 and incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.5 ml of 50% trichloroacetic acid, and the flasks were incubated at 37 °C for another 60 min. The contents of the center wells were transferred to test tubes each containing 3.5 ml of water. Then 0.5 ml of 20 mm N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine sulfate in 7.2 m HCl and 0.5 ml 30 mm FeCl3 in 1.2 m HCl were added. The absorbance of the resulting solution at 670 nm was measured 20 min later with a Multiskan spectrum microplate spectrophotometer.To measure H2S concentration, 200 μl of culture media from each treatment were collected and added to microcentrifuge tubes containing zinc acetate (1% w/v, 600 μl) to trap H2S. After 5 min, the reaction was terminated by adding 400 μl of N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine sulfate (20 μm in 7.2 m HCl) and 400 μl of FeCl3 (30 mm in 1.2 m HCl). After the mixture was kept in the dark for 20 min, 300 μl of trichloroacetic acid (10% w/v) was added to precipitate any protein that might be present in the culture media. Subsequently, the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. H2S in the sampled culture media interacts with N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine sulfate to form methylene blue, and the absorbance of the resulting solution was determined at 670 nm (17.Siegel M. Anal. Biochem. 1965; 11: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). H2S concentration in the culture media was calculated against the calibration curve of standard H2S solutions.CSE Activity Measurement−CSE activity was determined by a sensitive method using a colorimetric assay for the determination of pyruvate formation (18.Yang G. Wu L. Wang R. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 553-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Briefly, after different treatments the cells were collected and homogenized in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8), and the homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Twenty microliters of supernatants were added into 170 μl of 100 mm Tris phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 2.35 mm EDTA, 35 μm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, and 13.7 mm β-chloro-l-alanine, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 200 μl of 6.5 mm PPG. After 5 min, the resulting solution was well mixed with 1.4 ml of color-producing reagent containing 0.1 m PIPES (pH 6.4), 0.82 mm thiamine pyrophosphate, 6.86 mm MgCl2, 0.27 units/ml peroxidase, 0.27 mm N-(carboxymethylamino)-4,4′-bis(dimethylamino)-diphenylamine, and 10.97 units/ml pyruvate oxidase, and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The mixture containing no cell sample was used as a blank control. The absorbance of green dye at 727 nm was measured in a Multiskan spectrum microplate spectrophotometer. The CSE-specific activity was expressed as the optical density unit of absorbance at 727 nm per mg of protein.Western Blot Analysis−Cultured cells were harvested and lysed. Equal amounts of proteins were boiled and separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane as described previously (14.Yang W. Yang G. Jia X. Wu L. Wang R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 569: 519-531Crossref Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The primary antibody dilutions were 1:500 for anti-CSE antibody or BiP, 1:1000 for phosphorylated or total extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 MAPK, or c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and 1:5000 for β-actin. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was used at 1:5000. The immunoreactions were visualized by ECL and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak Scientific Imaging film).Short Interfering RNA (siRNA) Transfection−Pre-designed CHOP-targeted siRNA (CHOP-siRNA) was purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). Negative siRNA (Neg-siRNA), a 21-nucleotide RNA duplex with no known sequence homology with all the genes, was also from Ambion. Transfection of siRNA into INS-1E cells was achieved using the siPORT™ lipid transfection agent from Ambion (14.Yang W. Yang G. Jia X. Wu L. Wang R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 569: 519-531Crossref Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were plated overnight to form 60-70% confluent monolayers. CHOP-siRNA or Neg-siRNA at different concentrations and transfection reagent complex were added to the cells in serum-free medium for 4 h. Fresh normal growth medium was then added, and the cells were incubated for another 20 h. As control, Neg-siRNA was used to transfect INS-1E cells.Determination of mRNA Level by Real-time PCR−After treatment with H2S or transfection with adenovirus or siRNA, the cells were harvested from 100-mm culture dishes. Total RNA was prepared using TriReagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati) and DNA-free kit (Ambion), and then 2 μg of total RNA was reversetranscribed into cDNA with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase using random hexamer primers according to manufacturer’s protocol (Roche Applied Science). Controls containing no reverse transcriptase were used to safeguard for genomic DNA contamination in each sample. Real-time PCR was performed in an iCycler iQ apparatus (Bio-Rad) associated with the iCycler optical system software (version 3.1) using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, as described previously (19.Yang G. Cao K. Wu L. Wang R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49199-49205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Briefly, all PCRs were performed in a volume of 20 μl, using 96-well optical-grade PCR plates and an optical sealing tape. The cycling was conducted at 95 °C for 90 s followed by 38 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and at 60 °C for 20 s. The primers of CSE (GenBank™ accession number AY032875) were 5′-AGCGATCACACCACA-GACCAAG-3′ (sense, position 432-453) and 5′-ATCAGCACCCAGAGCCAAAGG-3′ (antisense, position 589-609). These primers produced a product of 178 bp. The primers of BiP (GenBank™ accession number M14050) were 5′-TCCGGCGTGAGGTAGAAAAG-3′ (sense, position 422-441) and 5′-GAGTAGATCCGCCAACCAGAACAA-3′ (antisense, position 635-658) with a product of 236 bp. The primers of CHOP (GenBank™ accession number BC100664) were 5′-CAGAGGTCACAAGCACCT-3′ (sense, position 338-355) and 5′-TCCCTGGTCAGGCGCTC-3′ (antisense, position 562-578) with a product of 240 bp. The primers of SREBP-1c (Gen-Bank™ accession number XM213329) were 5′-GGAGCCATGGATTGCACATT-3′ (sense, position 95-115) and 5′-AGGAAGGCTTCCAGAGAGGA-3′ (antisense, position 267-286) with a product of 191 bp. The primers of β-actin were purchased from Ambion, which produce a product of 295 bp. A standard curve was constructed using a series of dilution of total RNA (Ambion) transcribed to cDNA using the same protocol outlined above to confirm the same amplifying efficiency in the PCR. A standard melting curve analysis was performed using the following thermal cycling profile: 95 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 15 s, and ramping to 95 °C at 1° increments to confirm the absence of primer dimers. Relative mRNA quantification was calculated by using the arithmetic formula “2-ΔΔCT” (18.Yang G. Wu L. Wang R. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 553-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), where ΔCT is the difference between the threshold cycle of a given target cDNA and an endogenous reference β-actin cDNA. Based on the calculated ΔCT value, the target mRNA level in the treated carotid arteries was subsequently expressed as the percentage of that in the untreated controls.Reagents and Chemicals−H2S stock solution was freshly prepared by directly bubbling distilled water with pure H2S gas (Praxair) to make the saturated H2S solution (0.09 m at 30 °C) (4.Zhao W. Zhang J. Lu Y. Wang R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6008-6016Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar). H2S stock solution was diluted to different concentrations into cell culture medium, and the pH of medium was adjusted to 7.4. The anti-CSE antibody was homemade. Briefly, synthesized and conjugated targeted peptide VGLEDEQDLLEDLD (GenBank™ accession number AAL99218.1, position 377-390) was used to immunize male New Zealand rabbits. After the titer of anti-CSE antisera reached 1:4,000, the antisera were purified by protein G affinity. Purified antibody was eluted with 0.1 m glycine buffer (pH 2.5) and stored at -80°C for later use. The anti-MAPK antibodies and U0126 were obtained from New England Biolabs (Camarillo, CA). Anti-BiP antibody was from StressGen (San Diego, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody and goat anti-mouse IgG antibody were from Bio-Rad. All other chemicals were from Sigma or New England Biolabs.Statistical Analysis−All data are expressed as means ± S.E. and represent at least three independent experiments. Statistical comparisons were made using Student’s t test or one-way analysis of variance followed by a post hoc analysis (Tukey test) where applicable. Significance level was set at p < 0.05.RESULTSOverexpression of CSE in INS-1E Cells−Transfection efficiency was first determined using the control adenovirus, Ad-lacZ. INS-1E cells were transfected with Ad-lacZ at an m.o.i. ranging from 10 to 200 for 48 h. At an m.o.i. of 50, >90% cells showed nuclear staining for β-galactosidase (data not shown). All subsequent experiments were performed at an m.o.i. of 50. The Ad-CSE-transfected cells or nontransfected control cells did not exhibit any intrinsic β-galactosidase activity or falsepositive staining.After 48 h of transfection of INS-1E cells with Ad-CSE, the incubation medium was removed, and cell lysates were prepared. As shown in Fig. 1A, CSE mRNA expression level in Ad-CSE-transfected cells was 1.87 ± 0.21 times higher than that in Ad-lacZ-transfected cells or control cells (p < 0.05). Significant increase in CSE proteins was also detected after transfection with Ad-CSE (Fig. 1B). As expected, the cells transfected with Ad-CSE exhibited marked increases in CSE activity and H2S production rate, 4.2 ± 0.4 and 2.4 ± 0.5 times that in Ad-lacZ-transfected cell (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1, C and D). The concentrations of H2S of culture media, in which different types of INS-1E cells were incubated, were further tested. It was found Ad-CSE-transfected cells produced and released much higher concentration of H2S in their culture media than that of control cells or Ad-LacZ-transfected cells (p < 0.05). H2S concentration of the culture medium of control cells is 17.4 ± 1.6 μm, although it is 31.0 ± 1.3 μm for CSE overexpressed cells (Fig. 1E).Effects of Exogenous Applied H2S and CSE Overexpression on Cell Viability and Apoptosis−As shown in Fig. 2A, exogenously applied H2S at 50-200 μm reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner, and the cell viability with 100 μm H2S treatment was only 78.9 ± 1.9% that in the absence of H2S (p < 0.05). The cells transfected with Ad-CSE also had reduced cell viability in comparison with that of Ad-lacZ-transfected or control cells. At 48 h after Ad-CSE transfection, cell viability was 80.9 ± 2.6% that observed in Ad-lacZ-transfected cells (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Exogenously applied H2S or CSE overexpression decreased viability of INS-1E cells.

When incubated with 100 μm H2S, the cells exhibited increased condensed apoptotic nuclei and the morphological changes typical of apoptosis (Fig. 3A, panels b and e). Similar apoptotic changes occurred in Ad-CSE-transfected cells (Fig. 3A, panels c and f). Pro-apoptotic effect of H2S was further evidenced by TUNEL assay. TUNEL-positive staining increased in H2S-treated cells (Fig. 3A, panel h) and Ad-CSE-transfected cells (Fig. 3A, panel i) compared with the control cells (Fig. 3A, panel g). INS-1E cell apoptosis induced by H2S and Ad-CSE was also confirmed by internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation was observed in the presence of 100 μm H2S or transfection of Ad-CSE for 48 h but not in control cells or Ad-lacZ-transfected cells (Fig. 3B). Ammonium and pyruvate, another two products of CSE-catalyzed cysteine degradation, had no effect on cell viability and apoptosis at 100 μm (data not shown).FIGURE 3Exogenously applied H2S or CSE overexpression induced apoptosis of INS-1E cells. A, after incubation with 100 μm H2S for 12 h or transfection at 50 m.o.i. with Ad-CSE for 48 h, the cells were fixed and processed for Hoechst 33258 staining or TUNEL assay. Cell morphologies are shown in panels a-c observed under light microscope. Stained nuclear chromatin with Hoechst 33258 are shown in panels d-f. TUNEL staining results are presented in panels g-i.

Whether MAPKs were phosphorylated and activated by exogenously applied H2S or CSE, overexpression in INS-1E cells was examined using anti-phospho-MAPK antibodies. The same blots were later stripped and re-probed with an antibody that recognized both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of MAPK. As shown in Fig. 4A, ERK1/2 activation was decreased during the first 30 min of H2S treatment and continued to decline for 4 h. Conversely, p38 MAPK activation was induced by H2S during the first 30 min, peaked at 2 h, and later subsided (Fig. 4A). Reduced ERK1/2 activation and increased p38 MAPK activation were also observed in Ad-CSE-transfected cells compared with Ad-lacZ-transfected cells and the control cells (Fig. 4B). JNK activity, however, was quiescent during the period of H2S treatment or Ad-CSE transfection (Fig. 4, A and B). The total amounts of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and JNK proteins remained unchanged with H2S stimulation or Ad-CSE transfection. U0126 (an inhibitor of MEK/ERK) and SB203580 (a p38 MAPK inhibitor) were used in the following experiments. As shown in Fig. 4C, 10 μm U0126 augmented the inhibitory effect of H2S on ERK1/2 activity but had no effect on H2S-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. SB203580 at 20 μm completely inhibited H2S-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK but had no effect on the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 4C).FIGURE 4Activation of MAPK pathway by H2S in INS-1E cells.

https://openalex.org/W2033443315,"In the multifunctional fungal fatty acid synthase (FAS), the acyl carrier protein (ACP) domain shuttles reaction intermediates covalently attached to its prosthetic phosphopantetheine group between the different enzymatic centers of the reaction cycle. Here, we report the structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae FAS determined at 3.1 angstrom resolution with its ACP stalled at the active site of ketoacyl synthase. The ACP contacts the base of the reaction chamber through conserved, charge-complementary surfaces, which optimally position the ACP toward the catalytic cleft of ketoacyl synthase. The conformation of the prosthetic group suggests a switchblade mechanism for acyl chain delivery to the active site of the enzyme."

Population genetic analyses of the 1467 single-nucleotide polymorphisms discovered suggest that the two populations separated about 162,000 years ago, with the Chinese population tripling in size since then and the Indian population eventually shrinking by a factor of four. Using coalescent simulations, we confirmed that these inferred demographic events explain a much faster decay of LD in Chinese ( r 2 ≈ 0.15 at 10 kilobases) versus Indian ( r 2 ≈ 0.52 at 10 kilobases) macaque populations."
https://openalex.org/W2089783252,"In most mammalian cells, insulin and glucocorticoids promote anabolism and catabolism, respectively. Whereas the opposing effects of insulin and glucocorticoids on catabolic gene expression have been explained at the molecular level, comparatively little is known about how these hormones alter anabolic gene expression. These studies identify ATF4 as an anabolic transcription factor that is repressed by glucocorticoids and induced by insulin. Insulin-mediated induction of ATF4 required the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1, was required for the activation of a genetic program for the cellular uptake of essential amino acids and the synthesis of nonessential amino acids and aminoacyl-tRNAs, and was coupled to the repression of Foxo-dependent genes needed for protein and lipid catabolism. These results suggest that ATF4 plays a central role in hormonal regulation of amino acid and protein anabolism by coupling amino acid uptake and synthesis, as well as the generation of charged tRNAs, to mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1-mediated mRNA translation.

Insulin levels rise after feeding, promoting anabolic processes (such as the uptake of amino acids, glucose, and lipid and the synthesis of protein, glycogen, and lipid), while inhibiting catabolic processes (such as protein breakdown, gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, lipolysis, fatty acid oxidation, and ketogenesis) (1Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Griffin J.E. Ojeda S.R. Textbook of Endocrine Physiology. Oxford University Press, New York1996: 309-332Google Scholar). In contrast to insulin, glucocorticoids inhibit anabolism while promoting catabolism (2Leung K. Munck A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1975; 37: 245-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These effects of glucocorticoids are required for human survival during times of prolonged fasting or stress, when protein and lipid are mobilized from peripheral tissues and utilized for gluconeogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, and ketogenesis. Human health requires that the opposing metabolic effects of insulin and glucocorticoids remain in net balance, yet a number of pathological conditions tip the balance toward catabolism, resulting in atrophy of peripheral tissues. These conditions include starvation, glucocorticoid excess (Cushing syndrome), absolute or relative insulin deficiency (as in uncontrolled type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus), critical illnesses (such as burns, trauma, or sepsis), or chronic illnesses (such as uremia, cancer, AIDS, or tuberculosis). Indeed, atrophy of skin, muscle, and bone are predictable side effects when supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids are used clinically to suppress the immune response. Insulin and glucocorticoids induce many of their metabolic effects by altering the expression of key genes needed for anabolic and catabolic processes. Transcriptional control of catabolic gene expression by these hormones has been extensively studied, leading to a generalized molecular model that explains how catabolic genes are induced by glucocorticoids and repressed by insulin. Under fasting conditions, the presence of glucocorticoids coupled with lower levels of insulin permits the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) 2The abbreviations used are: GR, glucocorticoid receptor; PDK4, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isoenzyme 4; Glul, glutamate-ammonia ligase (glutamine synthase); MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; FBS, fetal bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; siRNA, small interfering RNA; RNAi, RNA interference; qPCR, quantitative PCR; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1. and Foxo transcription factors to bind cis-acting DNA regulatory elements present in genes encoding key proteins needed for protein catabolism (atrogin-1 and muscle-specific RING finger protein 1 (MuRF1)), lipid catabolism (pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (PDK4)), and gluconeogenesis (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK)). All of these catabolic genes require the combined presence of the GR and Foxo proteins to become transcriptionally active (3Sandri M. Sandri C. Gilbert A. Skurk C. Calabria E. Picard A. Walsh K.

Accili D. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2003; 423: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar). Conversely, after feeding, high levels of insulin initiate a signal transduction cascade that includes activation of the protein kinase Akt (9Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3973) Google Scholar). Akt phosphorylates the Foxo proteins, causing them to release from their DNA-binding sites and translocate out of the nucleus (10Accili D. Arden K.C. Cell. 2004; 11: 421-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1115) Google Scholar), thus de-activating the catabolic genes. Importantly, under physiologic conditions, insulin has a dominant effect, overriding glucocorticoids to turn off catabolism (11Pilkis S.J. Granner D.K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 885-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Conversely, when insulin levels are low, the continued presence of glucocorticoids provides the default setting of metabolism (toward catabolism), maintaining homeostasis in the absence of feeding, which may occur with unpredictable frequency. In contrast to our current understanding of how catabolic genes are regulated by glucocorticoids and insulin, relatively little is known of how these hormones regulate anabolic gene expression. This is particularly true of anabolic genes that might augment insulin-mediated protein synthesis or might be repressed during glucocorticoid-mediated protein catabolism. The anabolic genes encoding amino acid biosynthetic enzymes, amino acid transporters, and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are known to be activated by ATF4 (also known as CREB2), a basic leucine zipper transcription factor that is increased when cultured cells are deprived of amino acids or subjected to endoplasmic reticulum stress (12Harding H.P.

The studies presented here had two principal goals: first, to examine whether glucocorticoid- and insulin-mediated effects on catabolic gene expression might be accompanied by reciprocal effects on anabolic gene expression; and second, to begin to understand the molecular pathways used by glucocorticoids and insulin to regulate genes involved in amino acid and protein anabolism. Materials and Buffers—Dexamethasone, insulin (from bovine pancreas), rapamycin, and mouse recombinant insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) were obtained from Sigma. [3H]Leucine was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (ARC). The following buffers were used. Buffer A contains 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm sodium EDTA, 5 mm sodium EGTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (25 μg/ml N-acetyl-leucinal-leucinal-norleucinal, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Buffer B contains 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) SDS, and protease inhibitor mixture. Buffer C contains 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mm sodium EGTA, and protease inhibitor mixture. Buffer D contains 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 25% glycerol, 0.2% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 5% (w/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. Cell Culture—Tissue culture medium A is Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 1 g/liter glucose (Mediatech 10-014) plus 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS). Medium B is DMEM containing 4.5 g/liter glucose (Mediatech 10-013) plus 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 10% FBS. Medium C is DMEM containing 4.5 g/liter glucose (ATCC 30-2002) plus 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 10% FBS. Mouse L cells (D9 strain (19Lobel P. Fujimoto K. Ye R.D. Griffiths G. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1989; 57: 787-796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar)) were kindly provided by Dr. Stuart Kornfeld (Washington University, St. Louis, MO) and were maintained in monolayer in medium A at 37 °C and an atmosphere of 8–9% CO2. MEF-1 cells (20Willnow T. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained in monolayer in medium B at 37 °C and an atmosphere of 8–9% CO2. With the exception of experiments using RNA interference (as described below), mouse L cells and MEF cells were set up for experiments in medium A or medium B, respectively, at a density of 7 × 105 cells/100-mm dish. Two days later, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then subjected to the incubation protocols described in the figure legends. C2C12 mouse myoblasts (ATCC) were maintained in medium C, set up for experiments at a density of 7 × 105 cells/100-mm dish, and induced to differentiate into myotubes by replacing 10% FBS with 2% horse serum, as described (3Sandri M. Sandri C. Gilbert A. Skurk C. Calabria E. Picard A. Walsh K. Schiaffino S. Lecker S.H. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 2004; 117: 399-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2226) Google Scholar). After 4 days in differentiation medium, myotubes were washed twice with PBS and then subjected to the incubation protocols described in the figure legends. RNA Interference—Mouse L cells were set up at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/60-mm dish on day 0. On day 1, cells were washed with PBS, re-fed with medium A lacking penicillin and streptomycin (3 ml/dish), followed by the addition of a mixture containing 1 ml of OptiMEM (Invitrogen), 10 μl Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), and 200 nm siRNA duplex (to give a final siRNA concentration of 50 nm). Control cells were transfected with siCONTROL nontargeting siRNA (Dharmacon). The siRNA duplex targeting ATF4 contained the following nucleotide sequence (5′ to 3′), sense GAGCAUUCCUUUAGUUUAGUU and antisense CUAAACUAAAGGAAUGCUCUU. On day 2 (24 h after transfection), cells were re-fed with serum-free medium A and then subjected to varying conditions of incubation as described in the figure legends. Following incubation, the cells from two identically treated dishes were pooled and harvested for total cellular protein extracts; the cells from three identically treated dishes were pooled and harvested for total cellular RNA, followed by qPCR analysis; or the cells from two identically treated dishes were harvested for analysis of intracellular free amino acids. Analysis of Cellular mRNAs Using Oligonucleotide Microarrays—Following incubation, the cells from three identically treated 100-mm dishes were pooled, and total cellular RNA was harvested using STAT-60 reagent (Tel-Test), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA was then subjected to microarray analysis using established protocols (21Horton J.D. Shah N.A. Warrington J.A. Anderson N.N. Park S.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12027-12032Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar), GeneChip mouse genome 430 2.0 microarrays, and a GeneChip 3000 scanner (Affymetrix). Data were analyzed using GeneChip operating software (version 1.1.1, from Affymetrix), and the final results represent the average fold change in mRNA levels obtained from three independent experiments. Analysis of Cellular mRNAs by qPCR—Total cellular mRNA was isolated using the RNAeasy kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. In experiments using C2C12 myotubes, total cellular RNA was first extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions prior to purification on RNAeasy columns. cDNA synthesis, qPCR, and data analysis were performed as described previously (22Liang G. Yang J. Horton J.D. Hammer R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9520-9528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). All qPCRs were performed in triplicate, and the cycle threshold values were averaged to give the final results. mRNA encoding 36B4 was used as the invariant control in all studies. qPCR primer sequences may be found in the Supplemental Material. Analysis of Cell Number and Viability—Following incubation, mouse L cells were washed with PBS, lifted from 100-mm dishes using 2 ml of trypsin/EDTA solution (Mediatech 25-052), followed by the immediate addition of 18 ml of medium A containing 1% FBS. An aliquot of resuspended cells was then stained with trypan blue and counted using a hemocytometer. Metabolic Labeling—[3H]Leucine (120 Ci/mmol; 20 μCi/dish) was added directly to the cell culture medium, after which one dish from each experimental condition was placed at 4 °C (to measure background incorporation of [3H]leucine), whereas three dishes from each condition were placed back in the 37 °C incubator. Following incubation, cells were washed twice with PBS and then harvested, and an aliquot of cells was subjected to precipitation using 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid in the presence of 0.45% salmon sperm DNA. Trichloroacetic acid precipitates were then applied to glass fiber filters set upon a vacuum manifold. Filters were sequentially washed with 10% trichloroacetic acid, 5% trichloroacetic acid, and 95% ethanol and then placed in scintillation mixture for measurement of acid-insoluble radioactivity. The final results were obtained by averaging the counts obtained from the three dishes in each condition that were incubated at 37 °C, then subtracting the background count obtained from the dish incubated at 4 °C, and then normalizing the counts to the total milligrams of protein/dish under each condition. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Because ATF4 has an extremely short half-life (30–60 min) secondary to proteosomal degradation (23Yang X. Karsenty G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47109-47111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), the cells were treated with the proteosome inhibitor N-acetyl-leucinal-leucinal-norleucinal (25 μg/ml), for the final 1 h of incubation, as is routinely done in studies of proteins with rapid turnover, such as sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (24Adams C.M. Reitz J. De Brabander J.K. Feramisco J.D. Li L. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52772-52780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Following incubation, the cells from three identically treated 100-mm dishes of cells were washed once with cold PBS, scraped, pooled into 50-ml tubes on ice, and then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 1.2 ml of Buffer A and then passed through a 22-gauge needle 22 times, followed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. The 1000 × g pellet was resuspended in 250 μl of Buffer C, rotated at 4 °C for 1 h, and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min to remove insoluble material. The protein concentration was then measured using the BCA kit (Pierce), after which a 25-μg aliquot was mixed with 0.25 volume of Buffer D and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. Preparation of Total Cell Extracts—25 μg/ml N-acetyl-leucinal-leucinal-norleucinal was added directly to the medium for the last 1 h of incubation. Following incubation, the cells were washed once with cold PBS, then treated with Buffer B (150 μl/60-mm dish or 500 μl/100-mm dish), and scraped into 1.5-ml tubes on ice. The cells were then passed through a 22-gauge needle 11 times and then shaken for 20 min at room temperature using a Vortex Genie 2 (Fisher). The protein concentration of each total cell extract was measured using the BCA kit, after which an aliquot of cell extract (50 μg) was mixed with 0.25 volume of Buffer D and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis—Samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to Hybond-C extra nitrocellulose filters (Millipore). Immunoblots were performed at room temperature using a 1:1000 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal antiserum SC-200 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), which recognizes the COOH terminus of mouse ATF4. Measurement of Intracellular Free Amino Acids—Following incubation, cells were washed three times with cold PBS and scraped into 10% (v/v) methanol (150 μl/60-mm dish). Lysates from two identically treated dishes of cells were pooled, and protein concentrations were determined using the BCA method, and free (nonhydrolyzed) amino acid concentrations were determined using cation exchange chromatography (Hitachi L-8800 amino acid analyzer). Glucocorticoids Induce Mouse L Cell Fibroblasts to Enter a Metabolically Quiescent, Long Lived State That Is Reversed by Insulin—Mouse L cell fibroblasts were used to study the metabolic effects of glucocorticoids and insulin. These immortalized cells contain high levels of endogenous GR and resemble nontransformed peripheral mammalian cells in their capacity to slow their rate of anabolism in response to glucocorticoids (25Pratt W.B. Aranow L. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 5244-5250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, dexamethasone dramatically prolonged cell survival when mouse L cells were cultured in the absence of serum (which was omitted to prevent interference with any subsequent studies using insulin). In this experiment, cells were incubated in the absence or presence of dexamethasone and re-fed with fresh culture medium every 2 weeks. After various times of incubation, dishes of cells from each group were harvested for analysis of cell number and viability. In the absence of dexamethasone, cells initially proliferated but then died within 10 days of incubation. In contrast, if dexamethasone was present, the number of cells per dish did not increase, and many cells remained viable for >85 days of incubation. These effects of dexamethasone were reversible, as removal of dexamethasone from the cell culture medium after 15 days of incubation allowed the cells to initially proliferate, but ultimately led to cell death. The promotion of cell survival under these conditions was a specific effect of GR agonists (including corticosterone, the major endogenous glucocorticoid hormone in mice), required only low, physiologic concentrations of glucocorticoids (the EC50 for dexamethasone was < 3 nm), and was not reproduced by other steroid hormones such as progesterone, estradiol, or testosterone (data not shown). Interestingly, the addition of insulin (in the continued presence of dexamethasone) had the same effect as the removal of dexamethasone, inducing cell death (Fig. 1A), although insulin did not elicit the same degree of cellular proliferation as was observed when dexamethasone was removed. To test the idea that dexamethasone and insulin might have opposing effects on metabolism under serum-free conditions, mouse L cells were incubated in the absence or presence of dexamethasone for 48 h, followed by an additional 6 h of incubation in the absence or presence of insulin, which was directly added to the cell culture medium in the continued presence of dexamethasone. Dexamethasone decreased global protein synthesis (as assessed by the incorporation of [3H]leucine into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble cellular protein), and under these conditions, insulin induced a 4-fold increase in protein synthesis (Fig. 1B). These data indicate that GR activation causes serum-starved mouse L cells to enter a metabolically quiescent, long lived state. Under these conditions, insulin overrides the effects of glucocorticoids on both cell survival and protein synthesis. To test the hypothesis that glucocorticoids and insulin might have opposing effects on metabolic gene expression, global gene expression was examined using oligonucleotide microarrays. Serum-starved L cells were incubated for 54 h in the absence or presence of dexamethasone, or 54 h in the presence of dexamethasone with insulin also present for the final 6 h of incubation. To identify mRNA transcripts that may have important roles in metabolism, the analysis focused on transcripts that were subject to opposing regulation by dexamethasone and insulin. Fig. 1C describes mRNA transcripts that were either repressed ≥50% by dexamethasone and then induced ≥2-fold by insulin (class I transcripts, which consisted of 54 mRNAs) or induced ≥2-fold by dexamethasone and then repressed ≥50% by insulin (class II transcripts, which consisted of 82 mRNAs). The complete microarray data has been deposited in GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus), and the complete list of class I and II transcripts is provided in supplemental Table 1. Many of the class I transcripts encoded proteins with clear roles in anabolism, including 4 amino acid transporters, 5 amino acid biosynthetic enzymes, 4 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, as well as 12 proteins required for lipid synthesis or uptake. In contrast, several of the class II transcripts encoded proteins with established roles in catabolism and the cellular response to starvation, including Atrogin-1, MuRF1, and PDK4, as well as the mRNA encoding glutamine synthetase (Glul). Thus, dexamethasone induced catabolic gene expression, while suppressing anabolic gene expression; and insulin overcame the catabolic effects of dexamethasone, shifting the balance back toward anabolic gene expression. The 13 class I transcripts encoding amino acid transporters, amino acid biosynthetic enzymes, or aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases were particularly interesting, as this group of mRNAs was not previously known to be regulated by insulin or glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids Repress Expression of ATF4 and mRNAs Involved in Amino Acid and Protein Anabolism—Of the 13 class I transcripts involved in amino acid and protein anabolism, 7 are known to be induced through the actions of ATF4 when cells are deprived of amino acids (12Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Norova I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N. Yun C. Popko B. Paules R. Stodji D.F. Bell J.C. Hettmann T. Leiden J.M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 619-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2410) Google Scholar). Moreover, all of the genes encoding these 13 class I transcripts contained potential ATF-binding sites (shown in supplemental Table 2). This suggested the hypothesis that ATF4 might be required for expression of these mRNAs and thus that glucocorticoids might exert an inhibitory effect on ATF4. To test this hypothesis, mRNA levels were measured using quantitative real time RT-PCR, and ATF4 protein levels were analyzed by immunoblot. Fig. 2A shows that dexamethasone repressed levels of two representative class I transcripts (encoding asparagine synthetase (Asns) and phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (Psat1)) and also repressed levels of ATF4 mRNA and protein. The effect of dexamethasone occurred at low concentrations, approximating a physiologic concentration of glucocorticoid hormone, and was mimicked by corticosterone. Moreover, the effect of dexamethasone was blocked by the GR antagonist RU 486 and was not reproduced by progesterone. Fig. 2B shows that the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on ATF4 and mRNAs encoding asparagine synthetase and Psat1 only occurred when mouse L cells were incubated in the absence of serum. This finding is consistent with the notion that serum contains growth factors (such as insulin) that likely override the effect of dexamethasone. Indeed, dexamethasone-mediated induction of PDK4 mRNA levels was also blocked by the presence of serum (Fig. 2B). The effect of dexamethasone on ATF4 mRNA and ATF4-dependent mRNAs was slow, requiring 48 h for maximal effect, and was temporally dissociated from the induction of PDK4 mRNA, which was maximal within 12–24 h of dexamethasone treatment (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these data indicate that GR activation suppresses ATF4 and ATF4-dependent mRNAs and induces catabolic mRNAs, provided that anabolic stimuli (such as insulin or serum) are not present. ATF4 Is Required for the Expression of mRNAs Involved in Amino Acid and Protein Anabolism—To determine whether ATF4 might be required for the expression of mRNAs involved in amino acid and protein anabolism, RNAi was used to knockdown ATF4 expression. In cells that were incubated in serum-free medium lacking dexamethasone, an siRNA targeting the coding region of ATF4 mRNA mimicked the effect of dexamethasone, reducing levels of ATF4 mRNA and protein as well as 13 mRNA transcripts encoding amino acid biosynthetic enzymes, amino acid transporters, or aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the siRNA targeting ATF4 did not significantly alter levels of control transcripts (desmin and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)), mRNAs encoding PDK4 and Glul (class II transcripts), mRNA encoding glutamine dehydrogenase (Glud1) (another amino acid biosynthetic enzyme), or mRNAs encoding the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) (two representative class I transcripts involved in lipid anabolism). Similar results were obtained using an siRNA targeting the 5′-untranslated region of the ATF4 mRNA transcript (not shown). RNAi was also used to test the role of a closely related basic leucine zipper transcription factor, ATF5, which was encoded by a class I transcript and has been shown to activate a reporter construct containing the asparagine synthetase gene promoter (26Sarraj J.A. Vinson C. Thiel G. Biol. Chem. 2005; 386: 873-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The siRNA targeting ATF5 produced >80% knockdown of ATF5 mRNA, but there was no effect on either ATF4 or ATF4-dependent mRNAs (not shown). These data indicate that ATF4 is required for expression of mRNAs involved in amino acid and protein anabolism and that glucocorticoids repress these mRNAs at least in part by decreasing ATF4 expression. In mouse L cells, the following eight amino acids are nonessential: Glu, Gln, Asp, Asn, Ala, Ser, Gly, and Pro (27Eagle H. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 214: 839-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ATF4-dependent transcripts encode seven enzymes (Asns, Psat1, Phgdh, Psph, Shmt2, Mthfd2, and Pycr1) necessary for the synthesis of four of these nonessential amino acids (Asn, Ser, Gly, and Pro) (Fig. 3B). The ATF4-dependent transcripts also encode three amino acid transporters (Slc1a4, Slc7a1, Slc7a5) sufficient for the uptake of the 12 essential amino acids (28Hyde R. Taylor P.M. Hundal H.S. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). This suggested the hypothesis that ATF4 expression might be required to maintain intracellular levels of Asn, Ser, Gly, Pro, and the 12 essential amino acids. To test this idea, ATF4 expression was reduced using RNAi, and intracellular free amino acids were measured using ion exchange chromatography. This technique measures levels"
https://openalex.org/W2063674761,"Hyperlipidemia, one of the most important risk factors for coronary heart disease, is often associated with inflammation. We identified lymphotoxin (LT) and LIGHT, tumor necrosis factor cytokine family members that are primarily expressed on lymphocytes, as critical regulators of key enzymes that control lipid metabolism. Dysregulation of LIGHT expression on T cells resulted in hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia. In low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice, which lack the ability to control lipid levels in the blood, inhibition of LT and LIGHT signaling with a soluble lymphotoxin beta receptor decoy protein attenuated the dyslipidemia. These results suggest that the immune system directly influences lipid metabolism and that LT modulating agents may represent a novel therapeutic route for the treatment of dyslipidemia."
https://openalex.org/W2096499490,"The regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) has been studied extensively due to the fundamental roles these zinc-endopeptidases play in diverse physiological and pathological processes. However, phosphorylation has not previously been considered as a potential modulator of MMP activity. The ubiquitously expressed MMP-2 contains 29 potential phosphorylation sites. Mass spectrometry reveals that at least five of these sites are phosphorylated in hrMMP-2 expressed in mammalian cells. Treatment of HT1080 cells with an activator of protein kinase C results in a change in MMP-2 immunoreactivity on 2D immunoblots consistent with phosphorylation, and purified MMP-2 is phosphorylated by protein kinase C in vitro. Furthermore, MMP-2 from HT1080 cell-conditioned medium is immunoreactive with antibodies directed against phosphothreonine and phosphoserine, which suggests that it is phosphorylated. Analysis of MMP-2 activity by zymography, gelatin dequenching assays, and measurement of kinetic parameters shows that the phosphorylation status of MMP-2 significantly affects its enzymatic properties. Consistent with this, dephosphorylation of MMP-2 immunoprecipitated from HT1080 conditioned medium with alkaline phosphatase significantly increases its activity. We conclude that MMP-2 is modulated by phosphorylation on multiple sites and that protein kinase C may be a regulator of this protease in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1995003386,"Recognition of double-stranded RNA by Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) will increase the production of cytokines and chemokines through transcriptional activation by the NF-κB protein. Over 136 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TLR3 have been identified in the human population. Of these, four alter the sequence of the TLR3 protein. Molecular modeling suggests that two of the SNPs, N284I and L412F, could affect the packing of the leucine-rich repeating units in TLR3. Notably, L412F is reported to be present in 20% of the population and is higher in the asthmatic population. To examine whether the four SNPs affect TLR3 function, each were cloned and tested for their ability to activate the expression of TLR3-dependent reporter constructs. SNP N284I was nearly completely defective for activating reporter activity, and L412F was reduced in activity. These two SNPs did not obviously affect the level of TLR3 expression or their intracellular location in vesicles. However, N284I and L412F were underrepresented on the cell surface, as determined by flow cytometry analysis, and were not efficiently secreted into the culture medium when expressed as the soluble ectodomain. They were also reduced in their ability to act in a dominant negative fashion on the wild type TLR3 allele. These observations suggest that N284I and L412F affect the activities of TLR3 needed for proper signaling.

Innate immunity is responsible for the initial detection and response to pathogen infection (1Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8899) Google Scholar). The process can be generally divided into several major steps, starting with the recognition of pathogen molecules by cellular receptors, the activation of a signaling cascade resulting in changes in gene expression, and production of effector and co-stimulatory molecules (2Uematsu S. Akira S. Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. 2006; 6: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The degree of activation of the innate immunity process can dictate not only the outcome of infection but also the degree of T- and B-lymphocyte activation in the adaptive immunity pathways. Receptors that recognize the microbial components are localized in the plasma membrane, in intracellular vesicles, or in the cytoplasm (3Cook D.N. Pisetsky D.S. Schwartz D.A. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 975-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar) and include the Toll-like receptors (TLRs). 3The abbreviations used are: TLR, Toll-like receptor; SNP, single-nucleotide polymorphism; WT, wild type; ECD, ectodomain; mAb, monoclonal antibody; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; poly (I:C), polyinosic acid, polycytidylic acid. At least 11 TLRs have been identified in the mammalian genome (4Lancaster G.I. Khan Q. Drysdale P. Wallace F. Jeukendrup A.E. Drayson M.T. Gleeson M. J. Physiol.

Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4959) Google Scholar), presumably formed during viral infection. TLR3 binding to cognate ligands modulates downstream cytokine and chemokine production through the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, which translocates to the nucleus to modulate gene expression (5Alexopoulou L.

A role for TLR3 in viral infection has been suggested based on the demonstration that TLR3 knock-out mice were unable to mount a full response to cytomegalovirus infection (7Tabeta K. Georgel P.

Studies of bacterial infection of Drosophila lines homozygous for a wild chromosome 2 documented that SNPs in a number of molecules associated with microbial recognition and response are linked with the susceptibility to bacterial infection (15Lazzaro B.P. Seurman B.K. Clark A.G. Science. 2004; 303: 1873-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrate that genetic makeup of individuals will affect the ability to survive infections. Specifically, genetic variations in the TLRs have been correlated with disease susceptibility, including sepsis, immunodeficiencies, atherosclerosis, and asthma (1Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8899) Google Scholar, 2Uematsu S. Akira S. Expert Opin. Biol.

For TLR3, polymorphisms at nucleotides 2593C/T, 2642C/A, 2690A/G have been reported to be linked to Type 1 diabetes in South African populations (16Pirie F.J. Pegoraro R. Motala A.A. Rauff S. Rom L. Govender T. Esterhuizen T.M. Tissue Antigens. 2005; 66: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These studies are primarily correlative. In this work, we examined the distribution of SNPs in the human population and determined whether four known human SNPs that we predicted to cause changes in the TLR3 protein molecule will affect TLR3 structure and function in cell-based assays. Analysis of the Evolutionary Conservation of the SNPs—Fourteen sequence homologs to human TLR3 were identified using the PipeAlign package (17Plewniak F. Bianchetti L. Brelivet Y. Carles A. Chalmel F. Lecompte O. Mochel T. Moulinier L. Muller A. Muller J. Prigent V. Ripp R. Thierry J.C. Thompson J.D. Wicker N. Poch O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3829-3832Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), which identifies a cluster of homologs ranging from fish to mammals. The sequences were subsequently aligned using M-Coffee (18Wallace I.M. O'Sullivan O. Higgins D.G. Notredame C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1692-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The resulting alignment was manually refined and used to direct the alignment of the corresponding coding sequences using PAL2NAL (19Suyama M. Torrents D. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 609-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (1838) Google Scholar). A maximum likelihood tree for the amino acid data set was determined using the PHYML program (20Guindon S. Gascuel O. Syst. Biol. 2003; 52: 696-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (14311) Google Scholar). Site-specific variation rates of the TLR3 amino acid sequences were calculated using the Bayesian method as implemented in Rate4site (21Pupko T. Bell R.E. Mayrose I. Glaser F. Ben-Tal N. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: S71-S77Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). The evolutionary conservation scores and the functional/structural importance of each residue were assessed using Conseq (22Berezin C. Glaser F. Rosenberg J. Paz I. Pupko T. Fariselli P. Casadio R. Ben-Tal N. Bioinformatics. 2004; 20: 1322-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Site-specific rate variations at the nucleotide level were calculated using maximum likelihood as implemented in the codeml program of the PAML package (23Yang Z. Nielsen R. Goldman N. Pedersen A.M. Genetics. 2000; 155: 431-449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which estimates synonymous versus nonsynonymous substitution rates (Ka/Ks, or ω) of the aligned nucleotide data set. Bayesian posterior probabilities of each codon being positively selected were assessed using either a simple or a complex model: M03, single ω ratio modeled with three categories of sites, or M08, single ratio with 10 categories of sites with a discrete β distribution (24Yang Z. Bielawski J.P. Trends Ecol. Evol. 2000; 15: 496-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). Molecular Modeling—The model of the TLR3 ectodomain was based on the crystal structure determined by Bell et al. (Ref. 11Bell J.K. Botos I. Hall P.R. Askins J. Shiloach J. Segal D.M. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10976-10980Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar; Protein Data Bank code 2A0Z). The transmembrane helix was predicted using Phobius (phobius.cgb.ki.se/). The cytosolic portion was modeled based on sequence homology with a similar domain from human TLR1, whose crystal structure was determined (Protein Data Bank code 1FYV, alignment not shown). The structural fragments were subsequently assembled to form a single model with the Quanta molecular modeling package (version 2000, Accelrys). Plasmid Construction—The wild type (WT) TLR3 plasmid was the one previously described by Sun et al. (12Sun J.C. Duffy K.E. Xiong J. Lamb R.J. Santos J. Masarapu H. Cunningham M. Holzenburg A. Sarisky R.T. Mbow M.L. Kao C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11144-11151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Plasmids containing SNPs were made by site-directed mutagenesis using oligonucleotides annealed to the target sequence and the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Sequences of the oligonucleotides will be made available upon request. All of the constructs containing SNPs were sequenced in their entirety to confirm that no unintended mutations were made. The sequence of the cyan fluorescent protein and yellow fluorescent protein were fused to the last coding codon of the WT TLR3 to generate plasmids pTLR3-CFP and pTLR3-YFP constructs, respectively. Briefly, the CFP and YFP DNA sequence was amplified via PCR from the plasmids PAmCyan1-C1 and pZsYellow1-C1 (Clontech Inc., Mountain View, CA) using primers to introduce an EcoRI site on the 5′ end and a XhoI site on the 3′ end of each CFP and YFP. The primer sequences will be made available upon request. The resulting fragments were cloned in frame at the C-terminal end of TLR3 in pcDNA using existing restriction sites. The TLR3-CFP and TLR3-YFP plasmids were then used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis to create the N284I-CFP, L412F-CFP, N284I-YFP, and L412F-YFP SNP constructs. Alternately N284I constructs were created using the internal restriction sites NheI and AflII to swap the WT section of the TLR3 sequence with the same region of untagged N284I-TLR3. TLR3ΔTIR mutant was generated by amplifying TLR3 DNA sequence corresponding to 756 amino acids from the N terminus and cloned using NheI and XhoI restriction sites. The resultant clone was used as template for generating N284I ΔTIR and L412F ΔTIR. Cell-based Assays—HEK 293T cells were harvested from an actively growing culture and plated in CoStar White 96-well plates at 4.4 × 104/ml for transfection. When the cells were ∼60-80% confluent, they were transfected with a mixture of the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) and plasmids pNF-κB-Luc (30 ng; Stratagene), pFL-TLR3 (15 ng), and phRL-TK (5 ng; Promega) that, respectively, code for the firefly luciferase reporter, full-length WT, and/or TLR3s with mutations in the ectodomain, and the Renilla luciferase transfection control. The cells were incubated for 24 h to allow expression from the plasmids. Poly(I·C) (2.5 μg/ml, unless stated otherwise) was then added to appropriate sets of transfected cells to induce TLR3-dependent NF-κB activity. After another incubation for 24 h, the cells were harvested using the Dual Glo luciferase assay system reagents (Promega). Luminescence was quantified using the FLUOstar OPTIMA Plate Reader (BMG Labtech, Inc.). Western Blots—293T cells were transiently transfected with WT, mutant TLR3, or control pcDNA as described above. Unless stated otherwise, the cells were lysed 36 h after transfection using passive lysis buffer (Promega) and sonicated to degrade chromosomal DNA. Equal amounts of proteins from each sample, as determined by staining with Coomassie Blue, were separated on NuPAGE 4-12% bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The anti-TLR3 antibody IMG315A (Imgenex Inc.) was used in Western blots because the mAb used in the FACS analysis was unable to detect denatured TLR3. The blots were developed with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). FACS Analysis—FACS analyses were performed with 293T cells grown in 6-well collagen-coated plates (BD Biosciences) at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/well. The cells were transfected with 1 μg of the appropriate plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For staining of cell surface-associated TLR3, the cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and washed twice with ice-cold FACS buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, 3% fetal bovine serum, 0.04% sodium azide) before suspension at ∼2 × 107 cells/ml in FACS buffer. The cells were stained for 30 min at 4 °C with 1 μg of phycoerythrin-labeled anti-human TLR3 mAb (clone TLR3.7, purchased from eBioscience, San Diego, CA) or a negative control mouse IgG1 control antibody. The antibodies were added to aliquots of the cells in 96-well plates and incubated for 30 min on ice in the dark. The cells were washed twice with FACS buffer to remove unbound antibody and then resuspended in FACS buffer. Viaprobe (BD Biosciences) was added to the cultures to exclude dead cells. The cells were transferred to the appropriate tubes and analyzed using a FACS Calibur machine (BD Biosciences). For intracellular staining, cells transfected for 24 h were fixed and permeabilized by incubation in Cytofix/Cytoperm™ buffer (BD Biosciences) for 40 min at 4 °C. The cells were then washed and stained in Perm/Wash™ buffer (BD Biosciences) as above. After staining, the cells were washed twice in Perm/Wash buffer and then resuspended in FACS buffer for acquisition. Data analysis was performed using FCS Express (De Novo Software, Thornhill, Canada). Microscopy—The cells were plated on LabTek II CC2-treated chamber slides (Nunc Intl., Naperville, IL) and transfected with plasmids in Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). CFP, YFP, TLR3-CFP/YFP, N284I-CFP/YFP, and L412F-CFP/YFP were all visualized 24 h post-transfection with a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescent microscope. TLR3, N284I, and L412F constructs not tagged with a fluorescent protein were also visualized via immunofluorescence. Briefly, cells transfected for 24 h were removed from the incubator and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline before being fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. After this treatment the cells were incubated at room temperature and protected from light for at least1hin anti-TLR3 fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated monoclonal antibody (Imgenex, San Diego, CA). The cells were washed and counterstained with Hoechst 33342 dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) before mounting in a buffered glycerol aqueous mounting medium. The cells were then imaged with a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescent microscope. SNPs of TLR3—Sequencing of genomic DNA from individuals of different ethnic groups has provided insight into the relationship between gene polymorphisms and disease. The recent elucidation of the x-ray structure of the human TLR3 ectodomain allowed the ability to model whether or not mutations in TLR3 may cause structural changes. At least 136 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) exist in the TLR3 gene (25Lazarus R. Vercelli D. Palmer L.J. Klimecki W.J. Silverman E.K. Richter B. Riva A. Ramoni M. Martinez F.D. Weiss S.T. Kwiatkowski D.J. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 190: 9-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Seven SNPs are within protein-coding sequences, but only four (N284I, Y307D, L412F, and S737T) resulted in amino acid substitutions (Fig. 1A). The four mutations are found in independent genetic backgrounds and are not linked. Furthermore, L412F is a prevalent allele, represented in ∼20% of the population sampled (Fig. 1A) (25Lazarus R. Vercelli D. Palmer L.J. Klimecki W.J. Silverman E.K. Richter B. Riva A. Ramoni M. Martinez F.D. Weiss S.T. Kwiatkowski D.J. Immunol. Rev. 2002; 190: 9-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Also, N284I and L412F affect residues that are conserved in the TLR3 orthologs from human to fish, whereas the remaining Y307D and S737T affect residues conserved only in mammals (Fig. 1B). Analysis of the Functional Significance of the SNPs—Relative functional significance of amino acid residues can often be determined by combining the information for sequence conservation and protein structures in a method called evolutionary tracing (26Lichtarge O. Bourne H.R. Cohen F.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 342-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). We performed such analysis using the seven SNPs that are located in the TLR3 protein coding sequence. In the TLR3 amino acid data set, evolutionary tracing using Conseq identified Asn284, Leu412, and Ala888 as the most conserved residues (Fig. 1A). Using the Bayesian method, we calculated the ω values of the seven SNP sites under two rate variation models. The result was obtained using the single ratio model plus three categories of sites to model the ω ratios among site (M03; Fig. 1A) or the single ratio plus 10 categories of sites with a discrete β distribution (M08; data not shown). The M03 model (lnL =-25,334) appears to fit the data set better than the M08 model (lnL = -25,339). A χ2 test indicates a significant difference between the two models with p < 0.001. However, both models indicate that the relative substitution rates of Leu204, Asn284, Leu412, and Ala888 were the lowest and approached zero. Tyr307, Phe459, and Ser737 were less conserved and had higher substitution rates. However, none of the rates were >1, suggesting that the residues were all neutrally selected and not under the influence of positive selection. Because the four nonsynonymous SNP residues were not selected as the sites for functional innovation during evolution, mutations at these sites in the human population tend to be either deleterious or neutral depending on the extent of sequence conservation. Asn284 and Leu412 have the highest purifying selection pressure, and therefore, mutations at these sites should be disruptive on the structure and function of the protein. Frequencies of the SNPs in Human Populations—Genotype information to determine the distribution of the four SNP alleles in human ancestry was extracted from the InnateImmunity (IIPGA) 4SNP information for this paper was retrieved from the Innate Immunity PGA, NHLBI Program in Genomic Applications (innateimmunity.net/data/homology (12/2006)). and Hapmap websites (27The International HapMap ConsortiumThe International HapMap ProjectNature. 2003; 426: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar) and formatted for Convert (29Glaubitz J.C. Mol. Ecol. Notes. 2004; 4: 309-310Crossref Scopus (491) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). The demographics for the sampling were as follows: the European and African-American data from the HapMap project was taken from families, meaning parent:child sampling groups. Therefore, the effective population size of the sample is smaller and may bias the allele frequencies in these populations. The African group is composed of 90 individuals from sub-Saharan Africa from the HapMap data and 24 African-American individuals from the IIPGA data. The data for the Asian population came from random unrelated individuals, half Chinese (from Beijing area) and half Japanese (from Tokyo) and are from the Hapman site. The European population consists of European Americans (90 from Hapman and 23 from IIPGA). Some gaps in the data such as Y307D in the Asian population were assumed to be missing data rather than assumed to be WT. One potentially important feature revealed by these studies is that the L412F allele frequency is 41% in the asthmatic population tested 4SNP information for this paper was retrieved from the Innate Immunity PGA, NHLBI Program in Genomic Applications (innateimmunity.net/data/homology (12/2006)). (Fig. 1C). This is significantly higher than the allele frequency of European American (26.97%) and the Asian (30.1%) populations and the overall population (20%). Although this result suggests a possible link to asthma, we note that the number of asthmatics analyzed is relatively low (n = 18) (Fig. 1C). Molecular Modeling of the SNPs—The interesting distributions of the TLR3 SNPs, especially the L412F SNP, led us to ask whether the resultant changes in the TLR3 protein sequence would affect the function of TLR3. We first modeled the four SNPs for possible effects on TLR3 structure. Three SNPs, N284I, Y307D, and L412F, exist within the TLR3 ectodomain, whose structure is known, whereas S737T lies outside of the ectodomain, whose structure is unknown. Therefore, we modeled the entire structure of TLR3 to examine the possible effects of all four SNPs. A helical conformation was assigned to the transmembrane domain, and the cytosolic domain model was based on sequence homology with the closely related cytosolic domain of the TLR1 molecule (Fig. 2A). Asn284 is at the end of the type VI β-turn regions (consensus motif position Asn10) of leucine-rich repeat 10, on the concave surface of the TLR3 ECD, facing the inner portion of the solenoid. The side chain of this asparagine forms five hydrogen bonds to amide and carbonyl groups of nearby residues from the same and neighboring leucine-rich repeat motifs (10Choe J. Kelker M.S. Wilson I.A. Science. 2005; 309: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 11Bell J.K. Botos I. Hall P.R. Askins J. Shiloach J. Segal D.M. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10976-10980Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). We predicted that a change to an isoleucine at this position could partially destabilize the solenoid structure (Fig. 2B). Tyr307 is an exposed residue located at the concave surface of the ectodomain stacked with Tyr283 in the exposed inner surface of the solenoid. A change to an aspartate should alter the positions of the side chain of Arg331, although Arg331 would remain as a surface-exposed residue (Fig. 2B). Leu412 is near the concave surface of the TLR3 ectodomain, but it is buried within the solenoid. Mutant L412F, like N284I, could alter the hydrophobic interaction environment by the more bulky substitution. We predict that this substitution would destabilize the solenoid structure and may also affect potential glycosylation of neighboring residue Asn413, which was observed to have N-acetylglucosamines attached in the crystal structure of TLR3 ectodomain (10Choe J. Kelker M.S. Wilson I.A. Science. 2005; 309: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 11Bell J.K. Botos I. Hall P.R. Askins J. Shiloach J. Segal D.M. Davies D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10976-10980Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Last, Ser737 lies within an exposed portion of the model for the TIR domain and is not predicted to interact with other residues of the TIR domain. These modeling results, along with the observations that Asn284 and Leu412 are invariant in all species (Fig. 1B), suggest that these two SNPs could affect TLR3 activity. Effects of SNPs on TLR3 Activity—To determine whether four SNPs that alter TLR3 amino acids affect function, we used a cell-based assay to assess TLR3-dependent activation of a firefly luciferase reporter driven by an NF-κB-dependent promoter (12Sun J.C. Duffy K.E. Xiong J. Lamb R.J. Santos J. Masarapu H. Cunningham M. Holzenburg A. Sarisky R.T. Mbow M.L. Kao C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 11144-11151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The HEK 293T cells do not have detectable endogenous levels of TLR3 (9Matsumoto M. Funami K.

Furthermore, the addition of poly(I·C) is required to activate firefly luciferase activity, demonstrating that the assay responds to exogenous ligand (Fig. 3A). All of the results are measured as a ratio of the firefly luciferase to a transfection control, the Renilla luciferase expressed from the herpesvirus thymidine kinase promoter and plotted as fold induction in the presence of poly(I·C) over untreated control. For clarity, the results will be stated as “reporter activity.” We routinely obtained between 4- and 10-fold reporter activity with WT TLR3 when the cells were induced with poly(I·C). Although there is some variation that could be due to the cell growth, the signal above background is easily discernable in all experiments. Y307D and S737T had the same level of activity as the WT (Fig. 3A). L412F had reduced reporter activity by ∼30%, and N284I reduced activity to background (Fig. 3A). To determine whether the reduced activity observed was statistically significant, p values were determined for the difference in activity of SNP mutants in comparison with WT TLR3. p values less than 0.05 are considered statistically significant. The p value of the activities of N284I and L412F relative to WT were both less than 0.001. Y307D and S737T had p values of 0.5 and 0.2, respectively (Fig. 3A). Similar results are reproducible in over a dozen independent experiments. To conf"
https://openalex.org/W2081702101,"Dipyrone (INN, metamizol) is a common analgesic used worldwide. Its widespread prescription or over-the-counter use in many countries (e.g., Brazil, Israel, Mexico, Russia, Spain) requires insight into its mode of action. This study therefore addressed the impact of its metabolites 4-methyl-amino-antipyrine (MAA) and 4-amino-antipyrine (AA) on peripheral cyclooxygenases (COX). Pharmacokinetics of metabolites and ex vivo COX inhibition were assessed in five volunteers receiving dipyrone at single oral doses of 500 or 1000 mg. Coagulation-induced thromboxane B2 formation and lipopolysaccharide-induced prostaglandin E2 synthesis were measured in vitro and ex vivo in human whole blood as indices of COX-1 and COX-2 activity. In vitro, metabolites elicited no substantial COX-1/COX-2 selectivity with MAA (IC50=2.55 micromol/L for COX-1; IC50=4.65 micromol/L for COX-2), being approximately 8.2- or 9-fold more potent than AA. After administration of dipyrone, MAA plasma concentrations remained above the IC50 values for each isoform for at least 8 h (500 mg) and 12 h (1000 mg) postdose. COX inhibition correlated with MAA plasma levels (ex vivo IC50 values of 1.03 micromol/L [COX-1] and 0.87 micromol/L [COX-2]). By contrast, plasma peak concentrations of AA after the 1000 mg dose were 2.8- and 6.5-fold below its IC50 values for COX-1 and COX-2, respectively. Maximal inhibitions of COX-1 and COX-2 were 94% and 87% (500 mg), 97% and 94% (1000 mg). Taken together, dipyrone elicits a substantial and virtually equipotent inhibition of COX isoforms via MAA. Given the profound COX-2 suppression by dipyrone, which was considerably above COX-2 inhibition by single analgesic doses of celecoxib and rofecoxib, a significant portion of its analgesic action may be ascribed to peripheral mechanisms. In view of the observed COX-1 suppression, physicochemical factors (lack of acidity) rather than differential COX-1 inhibition may be responsible for dipyrone's favorable gastrointestinal tolerability compared with acidic COX inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2084161942,"The completion of the draft sequence of the rhesus macaque genome allowed us to study the genomic composition and evolution of transposable elements in this representative of the Old World monkey lineage, a group of diverse primates closely related to humans. The L1 family of long interspersed elements appears to have evolved as a single lineage, and Alu elements have evolved into four currently active lineages. We also found evidence of elevated horizontal transmissions of retroviruses and the absence of DNA transposon activity in the Old World monkey lineage. In addition, approximately 100 precursors of composite SVA (short interspersed element, variable number of tandem repeat, and Alu) elements were identified, with the majority being shared by the common ancestor of humans and rhesus macaques. Mobile elements compose roughly 50% of primate genomes, and our findings illustrate their diversity and strong influence on genome evolution between closely related species."
https://openalex.org/W2092033381,"The pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR) serves as a checkpoint in B cell development. In the 2.7 angstrom structure of a human pre-BCR Fab-like fragment, consisting of an antibody heavy chain (HC) paired with the surrogate light chain, the “unique regions” of VpreB and λ5 replace the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) loop of an antibody light chain and appear to “probe” the HC CDR3, potentially influencing the selection of the antibody repertoire. Biochemical analysis indicates that the pre-BCR is impaired in its ability to recognize antigen, which, together with electron microscopic visualization of a pre-BCR dimer, suggests ligand-independent oligomerization as the likely signaling mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2121416942,"Purine nucleotide-binding proteins build the large family of P-loop GTPases and related ATPases, which perform essential functions in all kingdoms of life. The Obg family comprises a group of ancient GTPases belonging to the TRAFAC (for translation factors) class and can be subdivided into several distinct protein subfamilies. The founding member of one of these subfamilies is the bacterial P-loop NTPase YchF, which had so far been assumed to act as GTPase. We have biochemically characterized the human homologue of YchF and found that it binds and hydrolyzes ATP more efficiently than GTP. For this reason, we have termed the protein hOLA1, for human Obg-like ATPase 1. Further biochemical characterization of YchF proteins from different species revealed that ATPase activity is a general but previously missed feature of the YchF subfamily of Obg-like GTPases. To explain ATP specificity of hOLA1, we have solved the x-ray structure of hOLA1 bound to the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue AMPPCP. Our structural data help to explain the altered nucleotide specificity of YchF homologues and identify the Ola1/YchF subfamily of the Obg-related NTPases as an exceptional example of a single protein subfamily, which has evolved altered nucleotide specificity within a distinct protein family of GTPases.

To explain ATP specificity of hOLA1, we have solved the x-ray structure of hOLA1 bound to the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue AMPPCP. Our structural data help to explain the altered nucleotide specificity of YchF homologues and identify the Ola1/YchF subfamily of the Obg-related NTPases as an exceptional example of a single protein subfamily, which has evolved altered nucleotide specificity within a distinct protein family of GTPases. In all organisms, P-loop NTPases play a pivotal role in the regulation of diverse cellular processes such as protein translation, intracellular transport, signal transduction, cell motility, cell division, growth, and others. Most P-loop GTPases act as molecular switches such that the GTP-bound form constitutes the active state and triggers the biological output whereas the GDP-bound form is inactive (for review see Refs. 1Paduch M. Jelen F. Otlewski J. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2001; 48: 829-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 2Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar, 3Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). The guanine nucleotide-binding domain (G domain) is about 20 kDa in size and structurally conserved. The G domain adopts an α,β fold, typical for many nucleotide-binding proteins, formed by six central β-strands surrounded by five α-helices. At the sequence level, the G domain contains five characteristic sequence motifs, termed G1-G5, involved in nucleotide binding and hydrolysis (2Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). The G1/Walker A motif (GXXXXGK(S/T)), also referred to as P-loop (4Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar), helps to position the triphosphate moiety of the bound nucleotide. The G2 (X(T/S)X) and G3/Walker B (hhhDXXG) motifs are involved in the coordination of a Mg2+ ion that is required for nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. Specificity in nucleotide binding is conferred by the G4 motif, which has a (N/T)KXD signature in guanine nucleotide binding P-loop NTPases. The G5 motif ((T/G)(C/S)A) supports guanine base recognition (2Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). The conformational switch between the GDP- and GTP-bound forms of P-loop GTPases manifests itself in two peptide segments defined as switch I and switch II. The switch I region, a loop preceding strand β2, has also been termed the effector loop because it exerts downstream functions in many GTPases by binding to effector molecules. The switch I and II regions interact with the γ-phosphate of the bound GTP, resulting in a protein conformation that is highly responsive to GTP hydrolysis and loss of the γ-phosphate. Upon GTP hydrolysis, the molecule undergoes a conformational change, and the switch domains move into a different position and conformation, a mechanism that has been compared with the relaxation of a loaded spring (3Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). P-loop GTPases can be classified into TRAFAC (translation factor-related) and SIMIBI (signal recognition particle, MinD, and BioD) NTPases (5Leipe D.D. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 41-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Based on conserved sequence motifs and structural features, these two classes are further split into more than 20 distinct families and about 60 subfamilies (5Leipe D.D. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 41-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Bacteria contain fewer GTPases than eukaryotes, with less diverse functions (6Caldon C.E. March P.E. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 7Caldon C.E. Yoong P. March P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 8Mittenhuber G. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 21-35PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from those involved in translation, bacteria possess very few GTPases, and archaea have even fewer. Bacteria with small genomes (e.g. Mycoplasma genitalium) contain as few as 11 GTPases (6Caldon C.E. March P.E. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 9Fraser C.M. Gocayne J.D. White O. Adams M.D. Clayton R.A. Fleischmann R.D. Bult C.J. Kerlavage A.R. Sutton G. Kelley J.M.

Smith H.O. Hutchison III, C.A. Venter J.C. Science. 1995; 270: 397-403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strikingly, most of these GTPases are universally conserved and can be assigned to four main ancestral groups: elongation factors (EF-G, EF-Tu, and IF2), protein secretion factors (FtsY and Ffh), Era-related GTPases (Era, EngA, and ThdF/TrmE), and Obg-related proteins (Obg and YchF) (5Leipe D.D. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 41-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar, 6Caldon C.E. March P.E. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2003; 6: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Mutational analyses in many organisms have shown that most of these GTPases are essential (7Caldon C.E. Yoong P. March P.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 10Morimoto T. Loh P.C. Hirai T. Asai K. Kobayashi K. Moriya S. Ogasawara N. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3539-3552Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). YchF is one of the highly conserved GTPases (Escherichia coli to Homo sapiens: 45% identity, 62% similarity) belonging to the Obg-related GTPase family. The Obg protein family is thought to comprise five ancient subfamilies, namely Obg/CgtA, YchF/YyaF, Drg/Rbg, Nog1, and Ygr210 (5Leipe D.D. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 41-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Functionally, the Obg-like GTPases are poorly characterized. The best-studied member is the essential Obg/CgtA (SpoOB-associated GTP-binding protein) from Bacillus subtilis (11Trach K. Hoch J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1362-1371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Obg and its homologues have been implicated to function in cellular processes as diverse as sporulation, stress response, control of DNA replication, and ribosome assembly (for review see 12). In contrast to Obg, YchF/YyaF has been hardly investigated, and functional information on YchF homologues is scarce. In Brucella melitensis, the YchF homologue DugA has been suggested to be involved in iron metabolism and may be a regulator of the Ton system (13Danese I. Haine V. Delrue R.M. Tibor A. Lestrate P. Stevaux O. Mertens P. Paquet J.Y. Godfroid J. De Bolle X. Letesson J.J. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 5783-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Structural analysis of yeast and bacterial YchF revealed a modular organization formed by three domains, a central G domain, flanked by a coiled-coil domain and a TGS (ThrRS, GTPase, SpoT) domain of unknown function (14Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Chu S.Y. Toedt J. Eisenstein E. Howard A.J. Gilliland G.L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4031-4037Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). One anomaly in YchF and its homologues is the unusual G4 motif, which strongly diverges from the (N/T)KXD consensus, suggesting that guanine nucleotide binding specificity of YchF homologues might be either governed by other means or altered. We have biochemically characterized the human homologue of YchF and found that it binds and hydrolyzes ATP more efficiently than GTP. For this reason, we have termed the protein hOLA1, for human Obg-like ATPase 1. To explain ATP specificity of hOLA1, we have solved the x-ray structure of hOLA1 bound to the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue AMPPCP. 5The abbreviations used are: AMPPCP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylenetriphosphate); HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; RMSD, root mean square deviation; GMPPNP; guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido) triphosphate. 5The abbreviations used are: AMPPCP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylenetriphosphate); HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; RMSD, root mean square deviation; GMPPNP; guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido) triphosphate. Our structural data help to explain the altered nucleotide specificity of YchF homologues. Biochemical characterization of YchF proteins from different species revealed that ATPase activity is a general but previously missed feature of the YchF subfamily of Obg-like GTPase. Phylogenetic Tree Construction and Sequence Alignment—Phylogenetic distribution and multiple sequence alignment of Obg-like proteins were calculated with ClustalW (www.ebi-.ac.uk/clustalw) and displayed using TreeView (15Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar) or JalView. Cloning and Site-directed Mutagenesis—For hOLA1 cloning, the human gene PTD004 coding region was amplified by PCR using cDNA from HeLa cells. The PCR product was digested with NcoI and BamHI and inserted into the pQE60 protein expression vector (Qiagen) to allow for the expression of a C-terminally hexahistidine-tagged protein. The coding regions of S. cerevisiae Ybr025c (yOla1p) was amplified by PCR from yeast genomic DNA. The PCR product was digested with NcoI/BamHI and inserted into pQE60. Point mutations were generated using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. DNA oligonucleotides used for PCRs and mutagenesis are listed in supplemental Table S1. Protein Expression and Purification—Expression and purification of B. subtilis Obg and Hemophilus influenzae YchF was performed as described elsewhere (14Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Chu S.Y. Toedt J. Eisenstein E. Howard A.J. Gilliland G.L. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4031-4037Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 16Buglino J. Shen V. Hakimian P. Lima C.D. Structure. 2002; 10: 1581-1592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Expression of all other proteins was done in E. coli BLR (pRep4). Protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and performed overnight at 19 °C. The cells were lysed by cell cracking (EmulsiFlex-5C, Avestin) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 700 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol (w/v). The bacterial cell lysate was cleared by ultracentrifugation (90 min, 48,000 rpm, Ti70; Beckman) and was passed over nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). After intense washing with lysis buffer, bound protein was subjected to buffer exchange (hOLA1 elution buffer: 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol (w/v); yOla1 elution buffer: 50 mm Tris, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol (w/v)) and then eluted with 400 mm imidazole in the corresponding elution buffer. The eluted protein was subsequently bound to a Hi Trap SP Sepharose HP column (GE Healthcare) and eluted in a gradient (buffer A: 50 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol (w/v); buffer B: 50 mm Tris, 1 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol (w/v) at the respective pH). Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated by Centricon centrifugation (Milian) prior to gel filtration on a Superdex 200 10/30 column (GE Healthcare) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2. Peak fraction were pooled and supplemented with 2 mm dithiothreitol and 250 mm sucrose. Purified proteins were 98-99% pure and 95-98% nucleotide-free, as analyzed by SDS-PAGE and HPLC analysis, respectively. Fluorescence Spectrometry—Nucleotide binding of 2′/3′-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-labeled nucleotides (mant-nucleotides; Jena Bioscience) was examined by fluorescence spectrometry (Cary Eclipse, Varian). All of the assays were performed at 25 °C, and mant-nucleotide fluorescence was monitored at an excitation wavelength of 355 nm (slit width, 5 nm) and an emission wavelength of 448 nm (slit width, 10 nm). The experiments were carried out in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2. hOLA1 was titrated to a 0.5 μm mant-nucleotide solution up to a final concentration of 15 μm. Alternatively, nucleotide binding was followed by polarization measurement with a Fluoromax 2 spectrofluorometer (Spex Industries). Mant-nucleotides were used at a concentration of 0.2 μm. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Nucleotide binding affinity was determined by isothermal titration calorimeter (MCS-ITC, MicroCal, Inc.). Calorimetric experiments were performed at 25 °C in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol. The concentration of protein in the sample cell was 58 μm, and the titrated nucleotide were used at 600 μm. The data were analyzed using the manufacturer's software. Curve fitting were done according to single ligand binding equations. Nucleotide Hydrolysis Assay—To quantify nucleotide hydrolysis, 5 μm protein was incubated with an excess of either ATP or GTP (125 μm) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2 at 25 °C. At various time points, nucleotide diphosphate production was analyzed by HPLC (Shimadzu). The nucleotides were separated on a hydrophobic C18-column (Macherey-Nagel) with 50 mm potassium-phosphate, pH 6.5, 10 mm tetrabutylammonium bromide, 5% acetonitrile as polar, mobile phase. Protein was denatured on a C-18 precolumn (Bischoff-Chromatography). For Fig. 7B, the nucleotides were separated by anion exchange chromatography on a Nucleosil 4000-7 PEI column (Macherey-Nagel) using a linear salt gradient (buffer A: 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5; buffer B: 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 1.5 m NaCl). Alternatively, nucleotide hydrolysis was quantified using [γ-32P]ATP/GTP. In brief, the proteins were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP/GTP (50 μm, 0.05 μCi), and nucleotide hydrolysis reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 ml of a charcoal suspension. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g, release of [32P]phosphate was determined by scintillation counting of the supernatant. Competition was done with 50 μm of unlabeled nucleotides. Crystallization and Data Collection—hOLA1 was incubated with 0.5 mg/ml trypsin to remove flexible parts of the protein and subsequently purified by gel filtration. Rod-like crystals of hOLA1 approximately 0.4 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm in size were obtained at 4 °C by vapor diffusion using the hanging drop method and 12% polyethylene glycol 3350, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 10 mm MgCl2 as crystallization buffer. The nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue AMPPCP was added to the protein drop to a final concentration of 1 mm. The crystals were soaked with 30% glycerol as cryo-protectant, mounted using a nylon-fiber loop (Hampton Research), and flash-cooled to 100 K in a nitrogen stream. The data were collected at Beamline X06SA (SLS, Villigen) as consecutive series of 0.5° rotation images on a MARMOSAIC 225 detector. The data sets were indexed and integrated with XDS (17Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3216) Google Scholar), scaled with XSCALE, and converted to CCP4, XPLOR, or SHELX format with XDSCONV.

Open table in a new tab Molecular Replacement, Model Building, and Refinement—Molecular replacement was performed with the programs MOLREP (18Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) and PHASER (19McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1597) Google Scholar) and homologous YchF proteins (Protein Data Bank codes 1JAL and 1NI3) as search models. The search models were modified with CHAINSAW (20Schwarzenbacher R. Godzik A. Grzechnik S.K. Jaroszewski L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1229-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) after sequence alignment with the hOLA1 target sequence. Both MOLREP and PHASER gave the same clear molecular replacement solutions for both search models. The initial phases were improved by non-crystallographic symmetry averaging and solvent flattening with DM (21Cowtan K.D. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 43-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in an interpretable electron density map with reduced model bias. The correct side chains were modeled into the electron density map followed by real space refinement using the computer graphics programs COOT (22Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23004) Google Scholar) and MOLOC (23Gerber P.R. Muller K. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1995; 9: 251-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Modeling of the cofactor AMPPCP was performed by superposition of the putative nucleotide-binding site of hOLA1 with that of GTP-bound p21-H-Ras (Protein Data Bank code 121P; (24Krengel U. Schlichting L. Scherer A. Schumann R. Frech M. John J. Kabsch W. Pai E.F. Wittinghofer A. Cell. 1990; 62: 539-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), using the position and conformation of GTP as a starting point. The model was improved by iterative rounds of model building using COOT and MOLOC and of restrained maximum-likelihood refinement using REFMAC5. 2 including TLS refinement (25Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar). The quality of the final model was checked with MOLPROBITY (molprobity.biochem.duke. edu/) (26Davis I.W. Murray L.W. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 615-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 27Lovell S.C. Davis I.W. Arendall III, W.B. de Bakker P.I. Word J.M. Prisant M.G. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Proteins. 2003; 50: 437-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (3817) Google Scholar). The refinement statistics are given in Table 1. The figures were prepared with PyMOL (pymol.sourceforge.net). Superpositions—Superpositions were performed with the SSM superpose function within Coot. Briefly, hOLA1 full protein or the individual domains (G domain: residues 16-44, 58-65, 87-95, 107-126, and 198-305; coiled-coil: residues 139-171 and 180-195; TGS domain: residues 66-87 and 306-388) were superposed on full-length Thermus thermophilus YchF (Protein Data Bank code 2DBY), Schizosaccharomyces pombe YchF (Protein Data Bank code 1NI3), H. influenzae YchF (Protein Data Bank code 1JAL), and B. subtilis Obg (Protein Data Bank code 1LNZ). The quality of the superposition was judged on the sequence and optical alignment. Core root mean square deviation (RMSD) values are in Angstroms. hOLA1 is closely related to the bacterial protein YchF, a member of the TRAFAC class of P-loop NTPases (5Leipe D.D. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 41-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar) that constitutes one of four evolutionary conserved subfamilies belonging to the family of Obg-related GTPases (Fig. 1). The other three subfamilies comprise the Obg-, Nog1-, and Drg-like GTPases. Previously, the Obg family had been divided into five subfamilies, with the group of Ygr210-like proteins defining an independent fifth subfamily. Our phylogenetic comparison revealed that the Ygr210 branch and the Ola1/YchF branch are closely related and group together into one subfamily (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). In general, Obg-related proteins share two conserved sequence features, namely an YXF(T/C)TXXXXXG segment in the switch I region and a glycine-rich motif in the switch II region (GAXXGXGXGXXX(I/L/V)). A distinguishing feature of the Ola1/YchF subfamily is a noncanonical G4 motif, distinct from the (N/T)KXD consensus (Fig. 1B). The G4 motif in the Ola1/YchF subfamily is as variable as NVNE in bacteria (YchF), NMSE in yeast (Ybr025cp/yOla1p), and NLSE in human (hOLA1). Both, the conserved lysine and aspartate are replaced. In contrast, the G1, G2, G3, and G5 motifs match the signature found in other P-loop GTPases (Fig. 1B). The variation of the G4 motif may lead to an altered nucleotide binding specificity. Indeed, when we analyzed nucleotide binding of recombinant, highly purified hOLA1 using fluorescent, mant-labeled nucleotides by polarization analysis, we noticed that hOLA1 bound ATP. In contrast, we hardly observed GTP binding at a micromolar concentration of hOLA1 (Fig. 2A). Even binding of a nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue such as mant-GMPPNP was not saturable as shown by the linear dependence on hOLA1 concentration and failed to reach the level of ATP binding (see Fig. 6B). Further evidence that ATP is the preferred nucleotide-binding partner of hOLA1 stems from the observation that only ATP but not GTP could efficiently displace mant-ATP from hOLA1 (Fig. 2B). Together, this analysis shows that purified hOLA1 is an ATP-binding protein rather than a GTP-binding protein.FIGURE 6Mutations in the nucleotide-binding pocket of hOLA1 impair ATP binding. A, binding of mant-labeled ATP to hOLA1 (wild type (wt)), hOLA1 (F127A), and hOLA1 (N230A) was analyzed by fluorescence measurement as in Fig. 2. Both mutations impair binding of mant-ATP. B, combining the F127A and hOLA1-NKXD mutations prevents binding of both ATP and GTP. Binding of the indicated mant-labeled nucleotides to hOLA1 wild-type and hOLA1 F127A-NKXD was analyzed by fluorescence measurements. Note that the hOLA1 F127A-NKXD is impaired in both ATP and GMPPNP binding.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Isothermal titration calorimetry was used to determine the relative binding affinities for ATP and GTP. The dissociation constant (KD) for ATP was calculated to be 8 μm (Fig. 2C), whereas the KD for GTP could not be determined exactly because of its low affinity for hOLA1 (data not shown). Curiously, when the G4 motif of hOLA1 was reverted to the G4 consensus NKXD by site-directed mutagenesis, the hOLA1-NKXD mutant retained ATP-binding specificity (Fig. 2D), suggesting that the overall fold of the nucleotide-binding pocket in hOLA1 might define nucleotide specificity (see below). To test whether hOLA1 hydrolyzes ATP, we used HPLC analysis to assess the intrinsic ATP hydrolysis rate of hOLA1. Recombinant hOLA1 was incubated with an excess of ATP, and the amount of ADP production was measured at different time points (Fig. 3). The hydrolysis rate of hOLA1 was calculated to 0.050 ± 0.002 min-1. The affinity of hOLA1 for ATP and the intrinsic ATP hydrolysis rate are comparable with the GTP binding and hydrolysis properties of other Obg family members (28Welsh K.M. Trach K.A. Folger C. Hoch J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7161-7168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Lin B. Covalle K.L. Maddock J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5825-5832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Sikora A.E. Datta K. Maddock J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 339: 1165-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). hOLA1 might therefore constitute a novel group of ATPases, with biochemical features resembling those of related Obg-like low affinity GTPases (16Buglino J. Shen V. Hakimian P. Lima C.D. Structure. 2002; 10: 1581-1592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 28Welsh K.M. Trach K.A. Folger C. Hoch J.A. J.

To obtain structural insight into ATP binding of hOLA1, we determined the crystal structure of hOLA1 complexed with AMPPCP, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue, at a resolution of 2.7 Å. The protein crystallized in space group C2221 (No. 20) with one monomer in the asymmetric unit and no obvious formation of higher oligomeric states in the crystal packing, consistent with the observation that the protein is a monomer in solution (static light scattering; data not shown). We could build 327 of 396 amino acids into the electron density map. Missing are the N-terminal residues 1-15, the switch I and switch II regions with residues 45-57 and 96-106, respectively, some disordered loop regions with residues 127-138, 172-179, 196-197, and the C-terminal residues 389-396. The model was completed by building AMPPCP and 26 water molecules into the electron density maps. The final model has a crystallographic R factor of 0.23 and a free R factor of 0.29 with very good stereochemistry (Table 1). hOLA1 consists of an N-terminal G domain, flanked on either side by an inserted coiled-coil and a C-terminal TGS domain (Fig. 4), as was reported for the homologous bacterial and yeast YchF proteins (Ref. 14Teplyakov A.

The structures of hOLA1 and of the homologous H. influenzae YchF protein are quite similar with an RMSD value of 1.9 Å for all Cα atoms. The Cα atoms of the individual domains can be superimposed with RMSD values of 1.8 Å (G domain), 2.2 Å (coiled-coil domain), and 1.1 Å (TGS domain). Differences are more pronounced between hOLA1 and the GDP bound T. thermophilus YchF (Protein Data Bank code 2DBY, overall RMSD value 2.3 Å), the largest changes being observed for the coiled-coil domain (RMSD 2.5 Å), as well as helices α8b and α10 (for secondary structure assignment; see supplemental Fig. S3).

https://openalex.org/W1993865166,"Phospholipase C-ζ (PLC-ζ) is a sperm-specific enzyme that initiates the Ca2+ oscillations in mammalian eggs that activate embryo development. It shares considerable sequence homology with PLC-δ1, but lacks the PH domain that anchors PLC-δ1 to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, PIP2. Thus it is unclear how PLC-ζ interacts with membranes. The linker region between the X and Y catalytic domains of PLC-ζ, however, contains a cluster of basic residues not present in PLC-δ1. Application of electrostatic theory to a homology model of PLC-ζ suggests this basic cluster could interact with acidic lipids. We measured the binding of catalytically competent mouse PLC-ζ to phospholipid vesicles: for 2:1 phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine (PC/PS) vesicles, the molar partition coefficient, K, is too weak to be of physiological significance. Incorporating 1% PIP2 into the 2:1 PC/PS vesicles increases K about 10-fold, to 5 × 103 m-1, a biologically relevant value. Expressed fragments corresponding to the PLC-ζ X-Y linker region also bind with higher affinity to polyvalent than monovalent phosphoinositides on nitrocellulose filters. A peptide corresponding to the basic cluster (charge =+7) within the linker region, PLC-ζ-(374-385), binds to PC/PS vesicles with higher affinity than PLC-ζ, but its binding is less sensitive to incorporating PIP2. The acidic residues flanking this basic cluster in PLC-ζ may account for both these phenomena. FRET experiments suggest the basic cluster could not only anchor the protein to the membrane, but also enhance the local concentration of PIP2 adjacent to the catalytic domain.

In mammalian eggs, fertilizing sperm trigger a series of oscillations in the intracellular free calcium concentration, [Ca2+]i, because of release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum; the oscillations initiate the major events of egg activation (1.Stricker S.A.

Several lines of evidence indicate PLC-ζ fulfills the main criteria for the sperm factor: injection of either recombinant PLC-ζ or its RNA produces Ca2+ oscillations similar to those seen after sperm extract injection, and immunoprecipitation to remove PLC-ζ from sperm extracts abolishes their Ca2+-releasing activity (13.Saunders C.M.

Membrane interactions are important because when PLCs bind to the plasma membrane, they experience a ∼1000-fold higher local concentration of their PIP2 substrate, which increases the hydrolysis rate significantly (18.Rebecchi M.J.

Sequence alignment analysis of PLC isoforms indicates that PLC-ζ has the greatest homology with PLC-δ1 (47% similarity, 33% identity) (13.Saunders C.M. Larman M.G. Parrington J. Cox L.J. Royse J. Blayney L.M. Swann K. Lai F.A. Development. 2002; 129: 3533-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but lacks the PH domain that mediates PLC-δ1 interactions with the plasma membrane. How then is PLC-ζ targeted to membranes? Does it use protein-protein interactions like the β, γ, and ε isoforms, or protein-lipid interactions like the δ1 isoform? Alignment analysis (13.Saunders C.M. Larman M.G. Parrington J. Cox L.J. Royse J. Blayney L.M. Swann K. Lai F.A. Development. 2002; 129: 3533-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also reveals differences in the apparently unstructured linker region between the conserved X and Y catalytic domains of PLC-ζ and PLC-δ1: the PLC-ζ linker region proximal to the Y domain contains a cluster of basic residues (15.Saunders C.M. Swann K. Lai F.A. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2007; : 23-36PubMed Google Scholar) not found in the homologous region of PLC-δ1 (29.Essen L.O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L.

Scheme 1 below compares these sequences of the X-Y linker region of mouse PLC-ζ and rat PLC-δ1; basic residues are underlined and acidic residues are italicized. Unstructured clusters of basic residues similar to the one in PLC-ζ help anchor proteins such as Src (30.Murray D. Hermida-Matsumoto L. Buser C.A. Tsang J. Sigal C.T. Ben-Tal N. Honig B.

These clusters may target proteins to the plasma membrane for two reasons. First, it has more monovalent acidic lipids (and thus a more negative electrostatic surface potential) than internal membranes (32.Okeley N.M. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21833-21840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 33.Cho W. Stahelin R.V. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

Science. 2006; 313: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Second, it has a higher fraction of polyphosphoinositides, such as PIP2 (35.Heo W.D. Inoue T. Park W.S. Kim M.L. Park B.O. Wandless T.J. Meyer T. Science. 2006; 314: 1458-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Although there is good evidence the basic cluster in the X-Y linker region of PLC-ζ acts as a nuclear localization sequence (36.Swann K. Saunders C.M. Rogers N.T. Lai F.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 17: 264-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 37.Kuroda K. Ito M. Shikano T. Awaji T. Yoda A. Takeuchi H. Kinoshita K. Miyazaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27794-27805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we hypothesized it could also interact with acidic lipids to help anchor the enzyme to biological membranes. We tested this hypothesis by measuring the binding of (a) catalytically active PLC-ζ to phospholipid vesicles, (b) a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion construct containing the PLC-ζ X-Y linker region to phosphoinositide-impregnated nitrocellulose filters, and (c) a peptide corresponding to the basic cluster within the X-Y linker, PLC-ζ-(374-385), to phospholipid vesicles. We also constructed homology models of PLC-ζ and PLC-ζ-(374-385) and used them to calculate whether the basic cluster can interact electrostatically with acidic lipids. Finally, we used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements to examine the lateral interaction of membrane-bound PLC-ζ-(374-385) with PIP2. Materials−We purchased 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (PC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylserine (PS), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] (PG), and the triammonium salt of l-α-phosphatidyl-d-myo-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). [Inositol-2-3H]-l-α-phosphatidyl-d-myoinositol 4,5-bisphosphate ([3H]PIP2) and [ethyl-1, 2-3H]N-ethylmaleimide ([3H]NEM) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). Non-radioactive NEM was from Sigma. Bodipy-TMR-PIP2 (see Ref. 38.Gambhir A. Hangyas-Mihalyne G. Zaitseva I. Cafiso D.S. Wang J. Murray D. Pentyala S.N. Smith S.O. McLaughlin S. Biophys.

Peptides−Peptides, purchased from American Peptide Co., Inc. (Sunnyvale, CA), were blocked with an acetyl group at the N terminus and an amide at the C terminus. An N-terminal cysteine was added to facilitate covalent attachment of either a radioactive ([3H]NEM) or a fluorescent (Texas Red) label. The designations and sequences of the peptides are: PLC-ζ-(374-385), acetyl-CKKRKRKMKIAMA-amide; PLC-δ-(480-491), acetyl-CKPKEDKLKLVPE-amide; Asp3Lys13Asp3, acetyl-CDDDKKKKKKKKKKKKKDDD-amide. Peptide Labeling−We labeled peptides with radioactive NEM by placing 250 μCi of [3H]NEM in pentane on top of 20 μl of dimethyl formamide (DMF), evaporating the pentane with argon gas, then mixing the [3H]NEM in DMF with 1 ml of a ∼0.1 mm peptide solution. We then added an excess of unlabeled NEM (molar ratio of 1.5:1 NEM:peptide) to block unlabeled cysteines. We labeled peptides with Texas Red, a thiol-reactive fluorescent probe, using a modified version of the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Briefly, we mixed 1 ml of a ∼0.1 mm peptide solution (10 mm K2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.0) with the appropriate volume of probe solution (N,N′-dimethylformamide) to give a molar ratio of 1:1 probe:peptide and let the reaction proceed for 1 h at room temperature. We purified the labeled peptides using HPLC and determined the final purity (>95%) by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy. Expression Constructs of PLC-ζ and PLC-δ1−Mouse PLC-ζ and its corresponding X-Y linker region were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the original clone cDNA (GenBank™ accession no. AF435950; (13.Saunders C.M. Larman M.G. Parrington J. Cox L.J. Royse J. Blayney L.M. Swann K. Lai F.A.

The primer pairs used for PLC-ζ, and the corresponding XY linker were, respectively, 5′-AATCGAATTCTCATGGAAAGCCAACTTCATGAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ATGG TCGACATGCGTCACTCTCTGAAGTA-3′ (reverse); and 5′-TAGAATTCGGAAAGTGGGAACCTTATCTGAAAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AATGGTCGACAAGGCCATGGCTATTTTCATCT-3′ (reverse). The PCR products were then cloned into pGEX-5X2 (Amersham Biosciences). The rat PLC-δ1 clone (GenBank™ accession no. M20637) was kindly provided by Matilda Katan (Institute for Cancer Research, London, UK) in plasmid vector pGEX-1λt. Appropriate primers were designed to incorporate a SalI site at the 5′-end and a NotI site at the 3′-end of PLCδ1. PLCδ1 and the XY linker of PLC-δ1 were amplified by PCR and the amplicon was cloned into pGEX-5X2 vector using these SalI and NotI restriction sites. The primers used for PLCδ1 and for the corresponding XY linker, respectively, were 5′-CTTCGTCGACCATGGACTCGGGTAGGGAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CACCGCGGCCGCTTAGTCCTGGATGGAGATCTTC-3′ (reverse), and 5′-TAGAATTCGGAAGAAGCTGGGAGGGCTGCTGCCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGGTCGACTCCGGCACCAGCTTTAGTTTATCC-3′ (reverse). Protein Expression and Purification−For bacterial expression of the GST-tagged fusion proteins, Escherichia coli (BL21 strain, Novagen) was transformed with the appropriate construct cloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-5X2 (39.Nomikos M.

Cultures were incubated at 30 °C until the A600 reached 0.5, expression was induced at 25 °C with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, Promega) for 4 h, and bacteria were harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4 × 7H2O, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) containing 20% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The suspension was sonicated 3 times for 20 s on ice and centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 × g at 4 °C to pellet unlysed cells and cellular debris. GST-tagged recombinant proteins were purified from the soluble lysate using glutathione-Sepharose™ 4B (GS4B, Amersham Biosciences), 2-ml bed volume/liter starting culture. The GS4B was washed three times with 10 ml of PBS, mixed with lysate, and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h, and then centrifuged at 5000 rpm (5 min at 4 °C). The supernatant was discarded, and the GS4B was washed four times with 25 ml of PBS at 4 °C. Proteins were eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. Eluates were placed in snake-skin dialysis tubing (10,000 dalton cut off; Pierce) and dialyzed against 4 liters of PBS overnight at 4 °C. Dialyzed GST fusion proteins were concentrated and stored at -80 °C, in buffer containing 40% glycerol, 2 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors. Vesicle Preparations−We used 100 nm sucrose-loaded large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) for centrifugation experiments. As described previously (40.Buser C.A. McLaughlin S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 84: 267-281PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Wang J. Gambhir A. Hangyas-Mihalyne G. Murray D. Golebiewska U. McLaughlin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34401-34412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), we added solutions of PC, PS, and PIP2 dissolved in 1-2 ml chloroform to a 50-ml round-bottomed flask, which was then immersed into a 30-35 °C water bath and attached to a rotary evaporator. After ∼5 min rotation to allow thermal equilibration of the flask and lipid solution, we applied the maximum vacuum that does not boil the chloroform and rapidly evaporated most of the solvent to produce a uniform thin dry film of the lipid mixture; we then maintained the flask under full vacuum for ∼30 min. Adding a buffer solution containing 176 mm sucrose, 1 mm MOPS at pH 7.0 produces a multilamellar vesicle solution, which we then froze and thawed five times. We formed 100-nm diameter LUVs by extruding the solution through polycarbonate filters, then resuspended the sucrose-loaded vesicles in a 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MOPS, pH 7.0 buffer. Centrifugation Binding Experiments−We used the centrifugation technique described in detail elsewhere (40.Buser C.A. McLaughlin S. Methods Mol.

In brief, we mixed LUVs with trace concentrations (2-10 nm) of radiolabeled peptide and centrifuged the mixture at 100,000 × g for 1 h (we added sonicated unilamellar PC vesicles to the lipid-peptide mixtures, which reduces loss of peptide on the walls of the centrifuge tubes). We compared the radioactivity counts of the supernatant (free peptide) and pellet (peptide bound to sucrose-loaded vesicles) to determine the percentage of peptide bound. We describe the binding using the molar partition coefficient K, given by Equation 1,[Pm][Ptotal]=K[L](1+K[L]) where [Pm] is the molar concentration of peptide partitioned onto the membrane; [Ptotal] is the total concentration of peptide in solution and [L] is the accessible lipid concentration, which is one-half the total lipid concentration because we add radioactive peptide to preformed vesicles. We applied Equation 1 to the experimental data and obtained a value for K. It is apparent from Equation 1 that K is the reciprocal of the accessible lipid concentration required to bind 50% of the peptide. The derivation of Equation 1 makes no assumption about the mechanism by which the peptide binds to the membrane (43.Peitzsch R.M. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10436-10443Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). An identical equation is obtained if one assumes (incorrectly) that the unstructured basic peptide forms a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with a lipid in the outer leaflet of the vesicle. Thus, 1/K may be considered an effective dissociation constant of the peptide with a lipid. PIP2 Hydrolysis Assay−We also used the centrifugation technique to measure the binding of catalytically active GST-PLC-ζ to LUVs. We mixed ∼5 nm GST-PLC-ζ with sucrose-loaded LUVs in a Ca2+-free solution (100 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES, 2 mm DTT, 100 μm EGTA, pH 7.0) and collected the supernatant, which contained the unbound enzyme, following the procedure described above. We used a PIP2 hydrolysis assay to determine the concentration of PLC-ζ in the supernatant, adding aliquots of the supernatant to 33:33:33:1 PC/PS/PE/PIP2 100 nm LUVs containing a trace amount of [3H]PIP2, then initiating hydrolysis by adding calcium chloride (total [CaCl2] 110 μm; free [Ca2+] ∼ 10 μm). We removed 75-μl samples at different times and terminated the reaction by adding 375 μl of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid and 50 μl of 10% Triton X-100, then incubated the samples on ice until a white precipitate formed. Following centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min, we removed the supernatant and mixed it with 1 ml of 2:1 chloroform/methanol. We used scintillation counting of the upper phase of this mixture to determine the concentration of methanol-soluble [3H]IP3 products. We used different known concentrations of PLC-ζ to determine calibration curves: the initial slopes of curves illustrating %[3H]PIP2 hydrolysis versus time (as in Fig. 1A for binding data) are directly proportional to the [PLC-ζ] over the concentration range we used. We measured the initial slopes of the experimental curves (e.g. Fig. 1A), and compared them to the calibration curves to determine the concentration of active PLC-ζ in the supernatants. The experimental points in Fig. 1A are fit with a hyperbola. Fig. 1B plots % bound enzyme against the accessible lipid concentration; the curve is the best fit of Equation 1 to the data. We measured hydrolysis by PLC-δ1 in control experiments and observed no significant binding to PC/PS vesicles, consistent with previous measurements (44.Rebecchi M. Peterson A. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12742-12747Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). GST-PLC-δ1, however, bound with a Kd of ∼2 μm to vesicles containing PIP2 (not shown), a value similar to that reported for PLC-δ1 and the PH domain of PLC-δ1 (23.Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. O'Brien R.

Electrostatic Calculations and Potentials−We used a modified version of the DelPhi program (45.Gallagher K. Sharp K. Biophys J. 1998; 75: 769-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) to solve the nonlinear Poisson Boltzman (PB) equation for the model peptide/membrane systems considered in this study (46.Ben-Tal N. Honig B. Peitzsch R.M. Denisov G. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 561-575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). DelPhi produces finite difference solutions to the PB equation for a system where the solvent is described in terms of bulk dielectric constant and concentrations of mobile ions, whereas solutes (peptides and phospholipid membranes) are described in terms of coordinates of individual atoms as well as atomic radii and partial charges. Our calculations assume PIP2 has a valence of -4 and basic peptides are in their minimum free energy orientation. We followed the protocol outlined in Ref. 47.Wang J. Gambhir A. McLaughlin S. Murray D. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 1969-1986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar to calculate the interaction of the peptides with membranes containing PIP2. We used the Modeler 8v1 (48.Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10446) Google Scholar) program to construct the homology models for mouse PLC-ζ (GenBank™ accession number: Q3KPE5) based on the crystal structure of rat PLC-δ1 (pdb_id: 1djx:b) (29.Essen L.O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The PLC-δ1 structure did not include coordinates for a portion of the catalytic linker region spanning residues 446-483, which correspond to the mouse PLC-ζ segment 313-377. We modeled the catalytic linker residues HKPKE (479-483 in PLC-δ1) and VKKRK (373-377 in PLC-ζ) de novo into the structure and homology model, respectively, using the program Loopy (49.Petrey D. Xiang Z. Tang C.L. Xie L. Gimpelev M. Mitros T. Soto C.S. Goldsmith-Fischman S. Kernytsky A. Schlessinger A. Koh I.Y. Alexov E. Honig B. Proteins. 2003; 53: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) so that the regions corresponding to the experimental peptides were included in both the available structure and the model. However, we did not include other residues in the linker region of PLC-δ1 not visible in the structure, i.e. residues 446-478 for the PLC-δ1 structure and residues 313-372 for the PLC-ζ model are not shown. Hence, the electrostatic maps in panels B and C of Fig. 2 do not reflect these missing linker regions. Electrostatic maps adjacent to full models of human PLC-δ1 and PLC-ζ are in supplemental materials. The electrostatic potentials were calculated by solving the PB equation and visualized using GRASP (50.Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5314) Google Scholar). FRET Experiments−We used an SLM-AMINCO spectrofluorometer to measure FRET between a Bodipy-TMR-PIP2 and a Texas red label on the membrane-adsorbed basic peptides. We prepared PC/PS/Bodipy-TMR-PIP2 (70:30:0.1) LUVs as describe"
https://openalex.org/W1970164658,"Rat RoDH performs efficiently (V(m)/K(m)) in a pathway of all-trans-retinoic acid biosynthesis in cells and recognizes the physiological form of vitamin A, i.e., retinol bound with cellular retinol binding-protein, type I. Here we report that mouse embryo (e7.5 to e18.5) and liver (e12.5 to P2M) display inversely related mRNA expression of an Rodh ortholog, rdh1, and a major retinoic acid catabolic enzyme, cyp26a1, suggesting coordinate modulation of retinoic acid homeostasis. Rdh1 inactivation by homologous recombination produces mice with decreased liver cyp26a1 mRNA and protein and increased liver and kidney retinoid stores, when fed vitamin A-restricted diets. Thus, null mice autocompensate by down-regulating cyp26a1 and sparing retinoids, indicating that rdh1 metabolizes retinoids in vivo. Surprisingly, rdh1-null mice grow longer than wild type, with increased weight and adiposity, when restricted in vitamin A. Liver, kidney, and multiple fat pads increase in weight. Some differences reflect the larger sizes of rdh1-null mice, but mesentery, femoral, and inguinal fat pads grow disproportionately larger. These data reveal an unexpected contribution of Rdh1 to size and adiposity and provide the first genetic evidence of a candidate retinol dehydrogenase affecting either vitamin A-related homeostasis physiologically or vitamin A-related gene expression or biological function in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2010828866,"Among the multiple cellular effects mediated by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), the effect on cell proliferation has extensively been investigated. A recent study showed that LPA-mediated proliferation of colon cancer cells requires activation of β-catenin. However, the majority of colon cancer cells have deregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. This prompted us to hypothesize the presence of additional pathway(s) activated by LPA resulting in an increase in the proliferation of colon cancer cells. Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) is a transcriptional factor highly expressed in the crypt compartment of the intestinal epithelium. In this work, we investigated a role of KLF5 in LPA-mediated proliferation. We show that LPA stimulated the expression levels of KLF5 mRNA and protein in colon cancer cells and this stimulation was mediated by LPA2 and LPA3. Silencing of KLF5 expression by small interfering RNA significantly attenuated LPA-mediated proliferation of SW480 and HCT116 cells. LPA-mediated KLF5 induction was partially blocked by inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase and protein kinase C-δ. Moreover, we observed that LPA regulates KLF5 expression via eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2k). Inhibition of calmodulin or silencing of eEF2k blocked the stimulation in KLF5 expression. Knockdown of eEF2k specifically inhibited KLF5 induction by LPA but not by fetal bovine serum or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.

Signaling by LPA is mediated through LPA1, LPA2, and LPA3, which are members of a family of G protein-coupled receptors (1An S. Dickens M.A. Bleu T. Hallmark O.G. Goetzl E.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Jalink K. Eichholtz T. Moolenaar W.H. Cell. 1989; 59: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar), a growing body of work describes the effect of LPA on cell proliferation. LPA stimulates proliferation of many cell types, including fibroblasts, breast cancer cells, mesangial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, neuronal cells and others (5Tigyi G. Dyer D.L. Miledi R.

However, in some cases, LPA has a negative effect on cell growth. For example, LPA inhibits the proliferation of myeloma (5Tigyi G. Dyer D.L. Miledi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1908-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In mesangial cells, LPA shows a positive effect to cell growth at micromolar concentrations but inhibits cell proliferation at a higher concentration (7Gaits F. Salles J.P. Chap H. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1022-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The mechanisms underlying the proliferative effect by LPA are diverse, and in many cases the mitogenic effects of LPA are mediated through multiple pathways that work independently. Activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), protein kinase C (PKC), the phosphoinositide 3 kinase-Akt pathway, hydrolysis of phosphoinositide, Ca2+ mobilization, and activation of RhoA mediated by both pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive and -insensitive pathways have all been involved (5Tigyi G.

The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene is an important tumor suppressor for colorectal cancer and is mutated in 80% of colorectal cancer (15Smith K.J. Johnson K.A. Bryan T.M. Hill D.E.

The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is activated upon binding of Wnt to a member of the Frizzled family of seven transmembrane receptors. In the absence of Wnt, the cytoplasmic level of β-catenin is kept low via a multiprotein complex consisting of APC, axin, and the glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β). GSK-3β phosphorylates β-catenin, directing it to degradation by proteosome (17Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3517) Google Scholar). When activated, β-catenin accumulates in the nucleus where it binds to the transcription factors, T-cell factor, and lymphoid enhancer-binding protein, leading to transcriptional activation of multiple target genes, such as c-myc and cyclin D (17Morin P.J.

This work defines another entry point to the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and adds a new dimension to the biological effects by LPA. However, the majority of colon cancer cells have mutations that result in inactivation of APC or activation of β-catenin and, hence, it is expected that β-catenin is constitutively activated in these cells. Therefore, it remains to be determined whether LPA can further activate the β-catenin pathway in these cells. Krüppel is a zinc finger-containing transcription factor that is responsible for segmentation of the Drosophila melanogaster embryo (19Schuh R. Aicher W. Gaul U. Cote S. Preiss A. Maier D.

In mammals, there are at least 16 Krüppel-like factors (KLFs) that exhibit homology to Kruppel from Drosophila (22Feinberg M.W. Lin Z. Fisch S. Jain M.K. Trends Cardiovas. Med. 2004; 14: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In the intestine, two KLFs, KLF4 and KLF5, are highly expressed (23Ghaleb A.M. Nandan M.O. Chanchevalap S. Dalton W.B. Hisamuddin I.M. Yang V.W. Cell Res. 2005; 15: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). KLF4 expression is enriched in differentiated enterocytes found in the upper villus region, whereas KLF5 is found mainly in the proliferating crypt cell population where it positively regulates cell proliferation (24Conkright M.

Despite the effect of LPA on proliferation of many types of cells, the mechanism of LPA-mediated proliferation is not fully elucidated and led us to hypothesize that KLF5 might be required for LPA-mediated signaling. In this work, we report that LPA stimulates the expression level of KLF5 in colon cancer cells. LPA-mediated induction of KLF5 is observed in intestinal cells regardless of the mutational status of APC and KLF5 plays a crucial role in LPA-induced proliferation of colon cancer cells. Furthermore, we found that LPA induces KLF5 via pathways dependent on MEK1/2, PKC, and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2k). Materials—1-Oleoyl LPA (18:1 LPA) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids. All antibodies were from Cell Signaling. LY290042, U0126, GF109203X, rotterlin, trifluoperazine, and rapamycin were from Calbiochem. All kinase inhibitors were added to the culture medium 10 min before the addition of LPA. PTX was added 14 h before LPA treatment. The concentrations used are as follow: GF109203X at 5 μm, rottlerin at 10 μm, LY294002 at 50 μm, SB203580 at 5 μm, U0126 at 10 μm, rapamycin at 100 nm, U73122 at 5 μm, AG1478 at 250 nm, PTX at 50 ng/ml, trifluoperazine at 3 μm, and calmidazolium at 6 μm. Stock solutions were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide at a 1,000× concentration with respect to the working concentrations indicated above and dimethyl sulfoxide alone was added to control cells. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Cell Culture—SW480 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere as previously described (27Yun C.C. Chen Y. Lang F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7676-7683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). For Caco-2 cells, RPMI 1640 was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5% non-essential amino acids. HCT116 cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2. IEC6 cells were obtained from the Emory Digestive Disease Research Development Center and cultured at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% FBS, 0.1 unit/ml insulin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin. All the cells were serum starved 24 h before LPA treatment in their appropriate media without FBS. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA from intestinal cells was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Thirty μg of total RNA for each sample was hybridized with [α-32P]dATP-labeled full-length mouse KLF5 cDNA probe (28Chanchevalap S. Nandan M.O. McConnell B.B. Charrier L. Merlin D. Katz J.P.

Washing was performed at 50 °C with 3 changes of washing solution. Phosphoprotein 36B4 (29Laborda J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 193998Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) was used as a loading control to normalize the expression levels of KLF5 mRNA. siRNA Transfection—Double-stranded siRNA oligonucleotides targeting LPA2, LPA3, PKCα, and eEF2k were from Dharmacon. siRNA targeting KLF5 or PKCδ was purchased from Invitrogen and Upstate, respectively. As a control, a scrambled 21-nucleotide RNA duplex was used. Cells seeded at 60% confluence on 60-mm culture plates were transfected with 40 nm siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were serum deprived for 16–24 h and then treated with LPA or carrier. The efficacy of gene silencing of LPA2 and LPA3 was determined by reverse transcriptase-PCR using a primer set specific for LPA2 and LPA3, respectively (30Yun C.C. Sun H. Wang D. Rusovici R. Castleberry A. Hall R.A. Shim H. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C2-C11Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Expression of KLF5, PKC, and eEF2k was determined by Western blot. Luciferase Assay—The promoter of KLF5 was previously described (31Du J.X. Yun C.C. Bialkowska A. Yang V.W. J. Biol.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 562-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A Renilla luciferase control vector was co-transfected to normalize the transfection efficiency. Cell lysis and reporter assay were performed 2 days after the transfection with the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorter Analysis—Cell cycle analysis was performed as previously described (33Yoon H.S. Chen X. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2101-2105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Cells were rinsed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), treated with trypsin, and resuspended in their corresponding medium containing 10% FBS. Cells were then collected by centrifugation, washed with PBS, collected again by centrifugation, resuspended in 70% ethanol, and fixed at -20 °C overnight. Cells were pelleted once again by centrifugation and resuspended in a solution containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 50 μg/ml RNase A, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mm EDTA at room temperature for 30 min. Flow cytometry was performed on a FACSCalibur cytometer (BD Biosciences). Cell Proliferation—Cells were seeded at 20,000 cells/well in a 24-well plate. Cells were serum starved 24 h and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.1% FBS supplemented with either 0.1% bovine serum albumin/PBS or 0.1–10 μm LPA in 0.1% bovine serum albumin/PBS for up 3 days. On the day of cell counting, cells were trypsinized and the number of cells was counted by using a hemacytometer. Nuclear Extraction—SW480 and HCT cells were serum starved for 24 h followed by exposure to LPA. Nuclear proteins were isolated using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents Kit (Pierce). Western Immunoblot—Cells were rinsed three times with ice-cold PBS buffer, and lysed in lysis buffer composed of 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma). The equal amount of lysate in 2× Laemmli sample buffer was resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and Western immunoblot analysis was performed as previously described (30Yun C.C. Sun H. Wang D. Rusovici R. Castleberry A. Hall R.A. Shim H. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C2-C11Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The amount of KLF5 protein was determined using polyclonal anti-KLF5 antibody generated against amino acids 106–122 of the mouse KLF5 (24Conkright M. Wani M. Anderson K. Lingrel J. Nucleic. Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1263-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The expression level of KLF5 was normalized against the expression levels of β-actin. Densitometric analyses were performed using ImageJ (Scion Corp). Statistical significance was assessed by one-way analysis of variance using Origin software (OriginLab). Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. LPA Induces KLF5 Expression—Previous studies have shown that LPA promotes proliferation of colon cancer cells, such as DLD1 and HCT116 (12Yang M. Zhong W.W. Srivastava N. Slavin A. Yang J. Hoey T. An S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6027-6032Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 34Shida D. Kitayama J. Yamaguchi H. Okaji Y. Tsuno N.H. Watanabe T. Takuwa Y. Nagawa H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1706-1711PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, we found that LPA stimulated the rate of proliferation of human colon cancer Caco-2 and SW480 cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1). It has recently been reported that LPA-mediated signaling activates β-catenin in HCT116 and LS174T cells, which express wild type APC gene, and a decrease in β-catenin expression attenuates LPA-mediated proliferation of HCT116 cells (12Yang M. Zhong W.W. Srivastava N. Slavin A. Yang J. Hoey T. An S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6027-6032Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The APC gene is the most commonly mutated gene in colorectal cancer with the mutations resulting in deregulation of β-catenin activity (35Ilyas M. Tomlinson I.P.M. Rowan A. Pignatelli M. Bodmer W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10330-10334Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). To determine whether LPA can also activate β-catenin in colon cancer cells with the mutated APC gene, we examined nuclear translocation of β-catenin in SW480 cells. As shown in Fig. 2, LPA treatment of serum-starved SW480 cells did not induce the nuclear translocation of β-catenin. In contrast, LPA treatment resulted in an increase in β-catenin expression in nuclear fractions in HCT116 cells, which have the wild type APC gene, consistent with a previous report (12Yang M. Zhong W.W. Srivastava N. Slavin A. Yang J. Hoey T. An S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6027-6032Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). These data suggest that an alternative pathway(s) is responsible for the proliferation of SW480 and others, in which the APC gene is mutated. KLF5 is a transcription factor highly expressed in epithelial cells in the proliferating compartment of the gastrointestinal tract (24Conkright M. Wani M. Anderson K. Lingrel J. Nucleic. Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1263-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), but whether KLF5 plays a role in LPA-mediated proliferation has not been studied. To test this, we first determined whether LPA induces KLF5 gene expression. Fig. 3A shows that LPA treatment led to an increase in the KLF5 mRNA level in Caco-2 and SW480 cells within 1–2 h of treatment, which was sustained for at least 24 h. The induction of KLF5 mRNA by LPA was not limited to cancer cells but also observed in the nontransformed rat intestinal cell line IEC-6 as well. We next determined the levels of the KLF5 protein. In SW480, Caco-2, and IEC6 cells LPA treatment resulted in a sustained increase in KLF5 protein level in these cells following 2–4 h treatment (Fig. 3B). It is noteworthy that the increase at 2 h was not always observed but the increase much more consistently occurred after 4 h of treatment. Interestingly, LPA also induced the expression level of KLF5 protein in HCT116 cells, in which LPA induced nuclear translocation of β-catenin (Fig. 2). The induction of KLF5 was maximal at 10 μm LPA, whereas submaximal activation was observed at 0.1–1.0 μm LPA (data not shown). To further substantiate the increase in KLF5 expression by LPA, a luciferase reporter driven by a KLF5 promoter was transiently transfected in SW480 or HCT116 cells for the reporter gene assay (31Du J.X. Yun C.C. Bialkowska A. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4782-4793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Exposure of SW480 cells to LPA for 2 h had a minimal effect on promoter activity (Fig. 3C), as we observed that a similar treatment resulted in an inconsistent increase in KLF5 protein level (Fig. 3B). In contrast, there was a significant increase at 4 h, which further increased after 7 h of treatment. Similarly, LPA treatment of HCT116 stimulated the luciferase activity by 85% at 3 h and 152% at 5 h (Fig. 3D). As a control, 4 h incubation with 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), a known agonist of KLF5 expression (26Sun R. Chen X. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6897-6900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), resulted in an increase in the KLF5 promoter activity in both cell lines (Fig. 3, D–E). A previous report showed that another lysophospholipid S1P induces KLF5 expression (36Usui S. Sugimoto N. Takuwa N. Sakagami S. Takata S. Kaneko S. Takuwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12300-12311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Hence, we next compared the induction of KLF5 expression by LPA and S1P. As shown in Fig. 3E, S1P did not show a significant effect on the expression level of KLF5 in SW480 cells (upper panel). On the other hand, we observed an increase in KLF5 expression in HCT116 cells (lower panel) treated with S1P, but the effect of S1P was relatively smaller and was short lived compared with LPA. Induction of KLF5 Is Important for LPA-mediated Proliferation—Previous findings that KLF5 positively regulates cell proliferation led us to hypothesize that KLF5 may be a mediator of LPA-mediated cell proliferation (26Sun R. Chen X. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6897-6900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 37Chanchevalap S. Nandan M.O. Merlin D. Yang V.W.

FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 4757-4762Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Because many colon cancer cells such as Caco-2 and SW480 have high basal levels of KLF5 expression, we examined the role of KLF5 via silencing of the KLF5 gene using siRNA. Fig. 4A shows that KLF5 siRNA decreased KLF5 expression by ∼90% compared with control siRNA-transfected SW480 cells (Fig. 4A). Despite the knockdown, LPA treatment led to an increase in KLF5 expression in siKLF5-treated cells. Silencing of the KLF5 gene resulted in a significant decrease in LPA-induced proliferation of SW480 cells (Fig. 4B). Similarly, knockdown of KLF5 decreased the rate of LPA-mediated proliferation of HCT116 cells (Fig. 4C). However, LPA treatment resulted in a significant increase in cell numbers in siKLF5-treated cells compared with untreated cells, which may be attributed to the small induction of KLF5 observed in these cells (Fig. 4A). To further understand the role of KLF5, we performed cell-cycle analysis on cells treated with siKLF5 or control siRNA. Following LPA treatment for 72 h, the population of cells in S phase is almost 2-fold greater in control cells compared with siKLF5-treated cells (15.55 versus 8.29%). These data indicate that the induction of KLF5 is important for LPA-mediated proliferation of colon cancer cells and it stimulates cell proliferation by promoting G1/S transition. LPA2 and LPA3 Receptor Mediate LPA-induced KLF5 Induction—We previously reported that colon cancer cells, such as SW480 and HCT116, overexpress LPA2 (30Yun C.C. Sun H. Wang D. Rusovici R. Castleberry A. Hall R.A. Shim H. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C2-C11Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). At the same time, LPA1 expression was significantly decreased in these cells compared with normal colon epithelial cells (30Yun C.C. Sun H. Wang D. Rusovici R. Castleberry A. Hall R.A. Shim H. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C2-C11Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We next sought to determine which LPA receptors, LPA2 or LPA3, are responsible for the induction of KLF5. We omitted LPA1 based on the previous finding that the level of LPA1 in these cells is low (30Yun C.C. Sun H. Wang D. Rusovici R. Castleberry A. Hall R.A. Shim H. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C2-C11Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). LPA2 and LPA3 expression in HCT116 cells was blocked using siRNA specific for LPA2 or LPA3. Silencing of either LPA2 or LPA3 markedly decreased activation of ERK 1 and 2 in these cells. Similarly, the induction of KLF5 by LPA was abrogated by knockdown of either LPA2 or LPA3 and when combined a greater inhibition was achieved (Fig. 5). Induction of KLF5 Is Dependent on PKCδ and MEK1/2—A myriad of signaling pathways regulates LPA-mediated cell proliferation. Earlier studies have indicated involvement of ERK1/2, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt cascade, and in some cases the p38 group of protein kinases. To determine the signal transduction pathway involved in the induction of KLF5, we used pharmaceutical inhibitors specific against these protein kinases. The specific Gαi/o inhibitor PTX, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor LY290042, the p38 inhibitor SB203580, the phospholipase Cβ inhibitor U37122, and the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor inhibitor AG1478 did not block the induction of KLF5 in SW480 and HCT116 cells (Fig. 6, A and B). On the other hand, the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 was able to partially block the effect of LPA on KLF5 protein expression in both SW480 and HCT116 cells (Fig. 6, C and D). Previous studies have shown that LPA regulates PKC (12Yang M. Zhong W.W. Srivastava N. Slavin A. Yang J. Hoey T. An S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 6027-6032Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 40Fang X. Yu S. Tanyi J.L. Lu Y. Woodgett J.R. Mills G.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2099-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Moreover, LPA induces interleukin-8 secretion via a PKCδ-dependent mechanism (41Cummings R. Zhao Y. Jacoby D. Spannhake E.W. Ohba M. Garcia J.G.N. Watkins T. He D. Saatian B. Natarajan V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41085-41094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 42Zachos N.C. Tse M. Donowitz M. Ann. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 411-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined whether PKC is involved in the activation of KLF5. SW480 cells were treated with LPA in the presence or absence of the broad-spectrum PKC inhibitor GF109203X or the PKCδ-specific inhibitor rottlerin. GF109203X showed a modest inhibitory effect in both SW480 and HCT116 cells (Fig. 6, C and D). Interestingly, when the cells were pretreated with both U0126 and GF109203X, the inhibitory effect on KLF5 was substantially greater than with each inhibitor in both cell lines. The effects of the inhibitors were confirmed by the KLF5 promoter reporter assay, which shows a significant decrease in the luciferase activity in the presence of U0126, GF109203X, or both (Fig. 6E). This indicates that the effects of these inhibitors are additive. In addition to GF109203X, 10 μm rottlerin drastically blocked the i"

Despite the critical regulatory role of WT1, the pathways and mechanisms by which WT1 orchestrates development remain elusive. To identify WT1 target genes, we performed a genome-wide expression profiling analysis in cells expressing inducible WT1. We identified a number of direct WT1 target genes, including the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-family ligands epiregulin and HB-EGF, the chemokine CX3CL1, and the transcription factors SLUG and JUNB. The target genes were validated using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, small interfering RNA knockdowns, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and luciferase reporter analyses. Immunohistochemistry of fetal kidneys confirmed that a number of the WT1 target genes had overlapping expression patterns with the highly restricted spatiotemporal expression of WT1. Finally, using an in vitro embryonic kidney culture assay, we found that the addition of recombinant epiregulin, amphiregulin, CX3CL1, and interleukin-11 significantly enhanced ureteric bud branching morphogenesis.

The importance of WT1 during development is further demonstrated in mouse studies where Wt1-null embryos die in utero with agenesis of kidneys, gonads, adrenal glands, and spleen (7.Kreidberg J.A.

Similar to WAGR patients, Wt1 haploinsufficiency in mouse also leads to a kidney failure due to glomerular dysfunction (11.Guo J.K. Menke A.L. Gubler M.C. Clarke A.R. Harrison D. Hammes A.

WT1 encodes a Kruppel-like zinc finger protein that functions as a transcription factor but may also have a non-transcriptional role (2.Rivera M.N. Haber D.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 699-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 13.Lee S.B. Haber D.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 74-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 14.Wagner K.D. Wagner N.

Multiple WT1 isoforms can be generated from two alternative splicing events (16.Haber D.A. Sohn R.L. Buckler A.J. Pelletier J. Call K.M. Housman D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9618-9622Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) and the use of multiple translation initiation sites (17.Bruening W. Pelletier J. J. Biol.

The first alternative splice event inserts or omits 17 amino acids encoded by exon 5, and the second alternative splice determines the inclusion of three amino acids termed KTS (Lys, Thr, and Ser) between zinc fingers 3 and 4. Although the physiological significance of the first splicing event is perhaps compromised by the fact that mice with deletion of exon 5 develop normally (19.Natoli T.A. McDonald A. Alberta J.A. Taglienti M.E. Housman D.E. Kreidberg J.A. Mol. Cell.

Homozygous animals lacking either the +KTS or the –KTS isoforms fail to develop functional kidneys and gonads and die soon after birth, demonstrating the requirement of both the –KTS and the +KTS isoforms of Wt1 to fully develop functional kidneys and gonads. This also clearly demonstrates that there are distinct functions mediated by each isoform that cannot be compensated for by the presence of a single isoform. However, unlike Wt1–/– embryos (7.Kreidberg J.A. Sariola H. Loring J.M. Maeda M. Pelletier J. Housman D. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1993; 74: 679-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar), normal progression of the early steps of metanephric kidney induction and development of the heart, adrenal gland, and spleen occur in both isoform-specific knock-out mice (20.Hammes A.

The diversity of WT1 proteins is further expanded by an epigenetically regulated variant, designated AWT1, which is transcribed from an alternative promoter located within WT1 intron 1 and encodes amino-terminal truncated proteins (21.Dallosso A.R.

The detailed mechanisms and pathways by which WT1 orchestrates organogenesis in different tissues remain largely undefined. Due to the function of WT1(–KTS) as a transcription factor, much effort has been directed at identifying the target genes of WT1(–KTS). These include amphiregulin (AREG) (22.Lee S.B. Huang K.

In this report we perform a genome-wide expression profiling analysis of cells expressing inducible WT1(–KTS) and identify a number of new WT1 target genes. We also provide evidence for their role in kidney development. Cell Culture−UB27 cells derived from human osteosarcoma U2OS with tetracycline-repressible expression of WT1(–KTS) were maintained as described (35.Englert C. Hou X. Maheswaran S. Bennett P. Ngwu C. Re G.G. Garvin A.J. Rosner M.R. Haber D.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4662-4675Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). UD29 cells, also derived from U2OS, expressing WT1(+KTS) under the tetracycline-repressible promoter, were generated as described (35.Englert C. Hou X. Maheswaran S. Bennett P. Ngwu C. Re G.G. Garvin A.J. Rosner M.R. Haber D.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4662-4675Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). WT1 expression was induced in UB27 and UD29 cells by three washes with phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen) followed by incubation in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium without tetracycline. T5A1 cells are human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably transfected with an inducible WT1(–KTS) expression vector and were maintained as described (36.Malik K.T. Poirier V. Ivins S.M. Brown K.W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). WT1 expression was induced with the addition of 1 μm cadmium chloride to the media. WiT49 cells (kindly supplied by Dr. Herman Yeger, University of Toronto) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, 100 μl/ml l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 1.1 μg/ml insulin (Sigma), and 4 μl/liter β-mercaptoethanol. RNA Purification and Microarray Analysis−At indicated times after WT1 induction, total RNA was isolated using RNA STAT-60 (Tel-Test, INC. Friendswood, TX), and further purified with RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Double-stranded cDNA synthesized from total RNA was in vitro transcribed, and biotin-labeled cRNA was then fragmented into strands of about 200 bases in length and hybridized to HG133A and HG133B Chips from Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA). Chips were scanned on an Agilent Gene Array Scanner (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). The data were analyzed using the standard MAS 5.0 algorithm by Affymetrix and selected by having consistent change calls in all three time-points; one sample was assayed per time point. The details of the Affymetrix algorithm can be found in the Statistical Algorithms Reference Guide, found online. Routine array quality check was performed, and all arrays were found in the normal range (raw Q values ranged between 2.12 and 2.56, which is below the cutoff of 3.0, and the scaling factor ranged between 2.17 and 3.14). Microarray data have been submitted to GEO data base (accession number GSE5117). Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase-PCR−To validate the microarray data, qRT-PCR was performed using assay-on-demand TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Equal amounts of first-strand cDNA synthesized from total RNA were mixed with each TaqMan probe Mix and TaqMan Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and amplified using ABI prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Data were analyzed by comparative Ct method using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as an endogenous control (37.Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (120841) Google Scholar) and expressed as -fold differences to a reference value of each gene’s expression in the presence of tetracycline. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Knockdown Assay−500,000 WiT49 cells per well were seeded in 6-well plates 48 h before transfection. 50–100 nm WT1 SMARTpool or non-targeting control siRNAs (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) were combined in serum-free medium with the transfection reagent Dharma-FECT 1 (Dharmacon) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The mixture was then added dropwise to the cells in complete WiT49 medium and mixed by gentle swirling. RNA and protein were harvested at 48 h. Experiments were performed in duplicate with similar results. RNA extraction was performed by Tri reagent (Sigma) and DNase I treatment (Ambion, Austin, TX). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay−ChIP assay was performed following the method of Wells and Farnham (38.Wells J. Farnham P.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. After WT1 induction for 12–14 h by tetracycline withdrawal, formaldehyde (1% of final concentration, Sigma) was added to the culture media for 10 min, and cells were lysed in SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0). Genomic DNA was fragmented to lengths of 200–1000 bp by sonication (Branson 450, Danbury, CT), diluted 10-fold with ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl), and subsequently incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-WT1 antibody (C19, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz) as a negative control overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes pulled down with protein G-agarose were eluted with elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3) and incubated for 4 h at 65 °C to reverse the cross-linking. The eluates were treated with proteinase K, and released DNA was purified using Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and amplified by PCR with each primer set corresponding to promoter subregions. Luciferase Reporter Assays−ChIP-positive promoter fragments were cloned into a promoterless pGL3 plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI). NIH3T3 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of cytomegalovirus-driven WT1(–or +KTS) or the empty vector along with both 0.05 μg of cloned promoter-reporter construct and 0.005 μg of Renilla luciferase (Promega) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using the Dual Luciferase kit (Promega) and expressed as relative luciferase activity. Cotransfected Renilla luciferase was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. Immunohistochemistry of Rat Embryonic Kidney−Rat embryonic kidneys at 18.5 days post-coitum (dpc) were isolated, fixed, and embedded in paraffin. After tissue sectioning, slides were heated in 0.01 m citrate buffer, pH 6.0, using a microwave oven after deparaffinization and rehydration. Tissue sections were hybridized with the indicated antibodies and developed according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA). Tissue sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. The antibodies used were WT1 (BD Bioscience) 10 μg/ml, SLUG (Santa Cruz) 1:100 dilution, IL1RAP (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA) 1:1000 dilution, CX3CL1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) 1:100 dilution, and JUNB (Calbiochem) 10 μg/ml. Primary antibody was omitted in the negative control. Embryonic Kidney Organ Culture−Pregnant female Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Harlan Inc. (Indianapolis, IN). Embryonic kidney rudiments were isolated from 13.5-dpc embryos and cultured on Isopore polycarbonate filters (5 μm pore-size, Millipore, Billerica, MA) as described (39.Perantoni A.O. Dove L.F. Williams C.L. Differentiation. 1991; 48: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Indicated (Fig. 5B) concentrations of recombinant AREG, EREG, HB-EGF, CX3CL1, and IL-11 (R&D Systems) were added to the culture medium. After 72 h cultured embryonic kidneys were fixed, incubated with anti-laminin antibody (Sigma), and then incubated with Alexa 594-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) to visualize ureteric bud branching. The tips of ureteric bud branches were counted by fluorescence microscopy (Leica DMLB, Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL). Animals were handled as described in the approved animal study proposal following the guidelines provided by the National Institutes of Health Animal Research Advisory Committee. Identification and Validation of WT1 Target Genes−We previously identified amphiregulin (AREG) as a direct WT1(–KTS) target gene using an inducible-WT1 expression cell line UB27, which is derived from a human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS, coupled with microarray analysis (22.Lee S.B. Huang K. Palmer R. Truong V.B. Herzlinger D. Kolquist K.A. Wong J. Paulding C. Yoon S.K. Gerald W. Oliner J.D. Haber D.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 663-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Although successful, only 6800 genes were examined with the prototype expression array, and the analysis of a single induction time point resulted in significant noise in the expression data. To this end we decided to perform a comprehensive screen for WT1(–KTS) target genes using multiple induction time points. Examining expression profiles at multiple time points permits us to eliminate stochastic changes and significantly reduce the amount of noise associated with microarray experiments. As shown in supplemental Fig. 1, A and B, the presence of tetracycline led to a tight repression of WT1 expression, and removal of tetracycline led to a gradual temporal accumulation of both WT1 transcript and protein. We decided to restrict our analysis to early time points after WT1 induction to identify genes that are immediately affected by WT1 expression. Using total RNA isolated at 0, 4, 8, and 12 h after WT1 induction, we interrogated the Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Genechip, representing more than 39,000 transcripts. In our data analysis, we limited our search to those genes whose expression was altered at all three time points compared with the uninduced sample. Among 39,000 transcripts evaluated, only 23 known genes and 10 ESTs exhibited increased expression at all times upon WT1 induction (Table 1), whereas 10 genes were consistently repressed (supplemental Table S2). WT1 was the highest induced transcript (14- to 21-fold) and previously described WT1(–KTS) targets, such as AREG, acidic FGF (FGF-1), and IL-11, were also identified (22.Lee S.B. Huang K. Palmer R. Truong V.B. Herzlinger D. Kolquist K.A. Wong J. Paulding C. Yoon S.K. Gerald W. Oliner J.D. Haber D.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 663-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Expression of other previously reported WT1 targets such as HSP70 (40.Maheswaran S. Englert C. Zheng G. Lee S.B. Wong J. Harkin D.P. Bean J. Ezzell R. Garvin A.J. McCluskey R.T. DeCaprio J.A. Haber D.A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1108-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), podocalyxin (30.Palmer R.E. Kotsianti A. Cadman B. Boyd T. Gerald W. Haber D.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1805-1809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), CSF-1 (25.Thate C. Englert C. Gessler M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1287-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and BAK (33.Morrison D.J. English M.A. Licht J.D. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8174-8182Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) were not increased at all three time points. Expression of HSP70, CSF-1, and podocalyxin was only induced after 8 and 12 h of induction, whereas BAK was induced only at the 12-h time point (supplemental Table S1). This suggests that some of the authentic WT1 targets whose expression was not continuously up-regulated or down-regulated may have been overlooked in our analysis but further indicates the high signal to noise ratio in our microarray analysis. Consistent with this view, qRT-PCR analysis confirmed the expression changes in many of the genes tested (Table 1 and supplemental Table S2). About two-thirds of the up-regulated genes (16 of 23, including WT1) and all of the 8 down-regulated genes tested, showed significant expression changes by qRT-PCR that were consistent with the microarray data, although the magnitude of expression changes was variable. In subsequent analyses we focused on the 10 known genes whose expression was increased greater than 2-fold by qRT-PCR (Table 1). The up-regulated EST transcripts and the down-regulated genes were not examined further.TABLE 1Validation of WT1(−KTS)-induced target genes by qRT-PCRGene accession numberGene nameFold induction by microarray analysisaData from U133A and U133B DNA chip hybridizations were analyzed by Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 software.Fold induction by real-time RT-PCR assaybQuantitative RT-PCR was performed using assay-on-demand TaqMan probes (ABI).4 h8 h12 h4 h8 h12 hS75264.1WT113.919.721.1214.9 ± 20.3300.4 ± 36.1308.6 ± 43.7NM_002182.1IL1RAP7.48.03.33.0 ± 1.34.2 ± 3.13.4 ± 1.1NM_001432.1EREG3.03.52.68.1 ± 2.47.5 ± 0.96.7 ± 1.5NM_001657.1AREG1.72.31.73.0 ± 1.32.8 ± 1.62.4 ± 1.2NM_001945.1HB-EGF3.32.51.611.8 ± 2.73.9 ± 0.62.7 ± 0.3U84487CX3CL11.21.52.35.4 ± 2.15.8 ± 3.06.8 ± 2.9NM_000641.1IL-112.81.61.313.3 ± 10.15.7 ± 3.44.2 ± 2.4AI572079Slug2.02.61.96.7 ± 1.83.6 ± 1.12.2 ± 0.7NM_005415.2SLC20A12.12.11.45.0 ± 1.52.9 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.3NM_001897.1CSPG41.31.72.11.6 ± 0.21.7 ± 0.51.3 ± 0.1NM_000362.2TIMP31.92.32.02.0 ± 0.52.0 ± 0.61.6 ± 0.3NM_001975.1ENO21.11.62.00.9 ± 0.21.1 ± 0.41.9 ± 0.8AL023553clone RP3-347H131.31.51.9NTNTNTNM_006275.1SFRS61.61.61.61.3 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.3X59065FGF gene, exon 31.71.91.53.3 ± 0.41.7 ± 0.31.3 ± 0.2NM_002229.1JUNB1.51.61.53.8 ± 1.32.1 ± 0.22.1 ± 0.1NM_025246.1TMEM221.11.51.42.0 ± 0.61.9 ± 0.71.9 ± 0.4AL562152SH3BP51.11.41.41.5 ± 0.51.4 ± 0.11.7 ± 0.4AF070622.1RAI171.01.61.31.6 ± 0.31.4 ± 0.41.2 ± 0.1AI346835TM4SF11.11.31.31.4 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.31.4 ± 0.2NM_000346.1SOX91.01.21.31.1 ± 0.21.3 ± 0.61.6 ± 0.5NM_000602.1SERPINE12.12.11.22.9 ± 0.61.6 ± 0.21.1 ± 0.2D86962.1GRB 101.21.51.21.2 ± 0.82.0 ± 2.00.7 ± 0.5X16135hnRNP0.91.41.21.2 ± 0.31.4 ± 0.01.2 ± 0.3AK001782.1EST4.62.32.8NTNTNTBC006428.1EST3.31.42.0NTNTNTAI885015EST1.72.01.9NTNTNTBC002490.1EST2.51.41.6NTNTNTBC004270.1EST1.61.21.5NTNTNTAV721528EST1.91.61.4NTNTNTAI859242EST2.11.41.4NTNTNTBG231494EST2.51.21.2NTNTNTAI832118EST1.21.21.2NTNTNTBF739767EST1.51.41.5NTNTNTa Data from U133A and U133B DNA chip hybridizations were analyzed by Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 software.b Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using assay-on-demand TaqMan probes (ABI). Open table in a new tab Target Gene Regulation by WT1 in Human Kidney Cells−To examine whether the target genes identified in U2OS cells can be regulated by WT1(–KTS) in renal cells, we used the T5A1 cell line, a human embryonic kidney cell line with cadmium-inducible WT1(–KTS) expression (36.Malik K.T. Poirier V. Ivins S.M. Brown K.W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). WT1 expression was induced by the addition of cadmium (supplemental Fig. 1C), and the target gene expression was examined by qRT-PCR analysis. Consistent with our previous results, induction of AREG, EREG, HB-EGF, and IL-11 was observed 9 h after WT1(–KTS) expression (Fig. 1A). We note that IL-11 expression was highly induced by WT1(–KTS) expression, whereas the expression of SLUG was only marginally increased. Expression of IL1RAP, CX3CL1, SCL20A1, JUNB, and TIMP3 remained unchanged. This apparent discrepancy might be due to a modest WT1 induction (5-fold) in T5A1 cells compared with UB27 cells (200- to 300-fold, Table 1) or promoter saturation resulting from leaky WT1 expression in the T5A1 cells (supplemental Fig. 1C). Inhibition of WT1 Expression in Wilms’ Tumor Cell Line WiT49 Results in a Concomitant Decrease in Target Gene Expression−To examine target gene expression after modulation of endogenous WT1, we used WT1 knockdown with siRNA to further validate our target genes. WiT49 is a Wilms’ tumor-derived cell line with a high level of wild type WT1 expression and, thus, provides an ideal environment to study acute loss of WT1 function. Introduction of WT1 siRNAs in WiT49 cells led to a sharp decline in WT1 expression (supplemental Fig. 1D). Importantly, knockdown of WT1 expression in WiT49 cells led to a significant reduction in most of the identified target genes, with the exception of CX3CL1 and, to a lesser degree, IL-11 and TIMP3, as examined by qRT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1B), indicating that the expression of these genes is regulated by WT1. Of note, AREG expression was most severely affected (90% reduced) by the loss of WT1 expression. These results demonstrate that the WT1-induced genes examined represent physiologically relevant targets with possible roles in nephrogenesis and Wilms’ tumorigenesis. To determine whether the identified target genes are also regulated by the WT1(+KTS) isoform, we performed qRT-PCR with the tetracycline-regulated cell line UD29 expressing the WT1(+KTS) isoform. As shown in Table 2, most of the genes were not transcriptionally activated throughout all time points by the +KTS isoform. The only target gene that showed a sustained induction over time was EREG. Some of the genes were induced briefly at 4 h after WT1(+KTS) expression, but the expression level returned rapidly to a basal level. This result suggests that the majority of these target genes are preferentially transactivated by the –KTS isoform, but some of these genes may also be transcribed at low levels by WT1(+KTS), consistent with the idea that the + and the –KTS isoforms might have partially overlapping functions (20.Hammes A.

https://openalex.org/W1998383874,"Talin1 is a large cytoskeletal protein that links integrins to actin filaments through two distinct integrin binding sites, one present in the talin head domain (IBS1) necessary for integrin activation and a second (IBS2) that we have previously mapped to talin residues 1984-2113 (fragment J) of the talin rod domain (1 Tremuth, L., Kreis, S., Melchior, C., Hoebeke, J., Ronde, P., Plancon, S., Takeda, K., and Kieffer, N. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 22258-22266), but whose functional role is still elusive. Using a bioinformatics and cell biology approach, we have determined the minimal structure of IBS2 and show that this integrin binding site corresponds to 23 residues located in α helix 50 of the talin rod domain (residues 2077-2099). Alanine mutation of 2 highly conserved residues (L2094A/I2095A) within this α helix, which disrupted the α-helical structure of IBS2 as demonstrated by infrared spectroscopy and limited trypsin proteolysis, was sufficient to prevent in vivo talin fragment J targeting to αIIbβ3 integrin in focal adhesions and to inhibit in vitro this association as shown by an αIIbβ3 pulldown assay. Moreover, expression of a full-length mouse green fluorescent protein-talin LI/AA mutant in mouse talin1-/- cells was unable to rescue the inability of these cells to assemble focal adhesions (in contrast to green fluorescent protein-talin wild type) despite the presence of IBS1. Our data provide the first direct evidence that IBS2 in the talin rod is essential to link integrins to the cytoskeleton.

Partridge A.W. Ginsberg M.H. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2005; 3: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In vivo, talin is found in equilibrium between a functionally inactive cytoplasmic form and a membrane-bound active form (3Goldmann W.H. Bremer A. Haner M. Aebi U. Isenberg G. J. Struct.

Chem. 1987; 262: 7790-7795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Talin activation is a complex process that is still poorly understood. In some cells, integrin outside-in signaling leads to association of the large isoform of type 1 phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase with talin. This activates the phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase, and together they translocate to the plasma membrane (5Ling K. Doughman R.L. Iyer V.V. Firestone A.J. Bairstow S.F. Mosher D.F. Schaller M.D. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 1339-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Local phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate production by the phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase is then thought to activate talin (6Martel V. Vignoud L. Dupe S. Franchet P. Block M.R. Albiges-Rizo C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1951-1961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), possibly by relieving an autoinhibitory head-tail association unmasking the integrin binding site in the talin head (IBS1). In platelets, talin becomes activated through a protein kinase C α-dependent signaling pathway that stimulates activation and translocation of the small GTPase Rap1 to the plasma membrane where it interacts with its effector Riam, leading to the recruitment of talin and the unmasking of its integrin binding site in the head domain (7Han J.

These include three well characterized vinculin binding sites (VBS1-3) (13Gilmore A.P. Wood C. Ohanian V. Jackson P. Patel B. Rees D.J. Hynes R.O. Critchley D.R. J.

We have previously localized IBS2 to residues 1984-2113 of the talin rod (talin rod fragment J) and demonstrated direct interaction of recombinant talin fragments containing IBS2 with native platelet integrin αIIbβ3 or a recombinant β3 integrin subunit cytoplasmic tail, either in vivo, by intracellular fluorescence resonance energy transfer, or in vitro, by surface plasmon resonance and liquid phase pulldown assays (1Tremuth L.

We now report the minimal structure of talin IBS2 and provide evidence that a 2-amino acid point mutation (LI/AA) in this minimal structure inactivates the integrin binding capacity of IBS2. In addition, we show that a full-length green fluorescent protein (GFP)-talin LI/AA mutant is unable to rescue the cell spreading-defective phenotype of talin1-/- cells, despite the presence of a functional IBS1 site. Our data provide the first direct evidence that IBS2 in the talin rod is essential to link integrins to the actin cytoskeleton. Antibodies and Reagents—The following monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were used: mouse anti-talin (TD77), rabbit anti-GST (Chemicon International, Inc., Temecula, CA); mouse anti-β3 (P37), a kind gift from Dr. J. Gonzalez-Rodriguez (Instituto de Quimica Fisica, Madrid, Spain); goat anti-β3 (C20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); mouse anti-αIIbβ3 (PAC-1) (BD Biosciences); mouse anti-Myc tag (9B11) (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA); tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA); horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse IgG, anti-rabbit IgG, and anti-goat IgG (Amersham Biosciences). Rhodamine phalloidin was purchased from Molecular Probes. Diphenylcarbamyl chloride-treated trypsin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. CHO-αIIbβ3 Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) stably expressing recombinant αIIbβ3-GFP or wild type αIIbβ3 integrin (19Plançon S. Morel-Kopp M.C. Schaffner-Reckinger E. Chen P. Kieffer N. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 529-536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and transfected as previously described (1Tremuth L.

For each cDNA construct, 1.5 × 106 adherent cells were transfected with 3-15 μg of cDNA using Lipofectamine™ (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fetal calf serum (10% final concentration) was added after 3 h of transfection. Generation of the Talin1 Null Mouse Embryo Fibroblasts—Mice possessing a conditional allele of talin1 where the first 5 coding exons were flanked with loxP sites (Tln1 fl) were crossed with mice possessing an allele encoding a Cre integrase-estrogen receptor (CreER) fusion protein that renders Cre activity tamoxifen (TM) inducible (20Hayashi S. McMahon A.P. Dev. Biol. 2002; 244: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar) in order to generate embryos and then mouse embryo fibroblasts with one talin1 null allele and one talin1 floxed allele (Tln1fl/-) along with one copy of the CreER transgene. These Tln1fl/- CreER mouse embryo fibroblasts were immortalized by transfection with a temperaturesensitive SV40 large T antigen construct. Clones were selected and grown routinely at 33 °C (permissive for T antigen expression). Treatment of these cells with 1 μm 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OHT) deletes the “floxed” talin1 region, converting the cells to the talin1-/- genotype within 24 h. Cells were then transfected either with GFP-talin WT or mutant GFP-talin LI/AA, replated on glass coverslips, and analyzed for assembly of focal adhesions 24-48 h later. Mammalian Cell cDNA Expression Constructs—The cDNAs encoding C-terminal DsRed-tagged talin fragments G (aa 1984-2344), J (aa 1977-2113), B (aa 430-1076), and Myc-tagged talin fragment J have been previously described (1Tremuth L.

The cDNAs encoding talin residues 1977-2018 (J1), 2010-2049 (J2), 2042-2080 (J3), and 2072-2113 (J4) were generated using talin fragment G cDNA as a template and were inserted into the mammalian cell expression vector pcDNA4/TO/myc-HIS (Invitrogen), generating recombinant polypeptides with a C-terminal Myc-His tag. For site-directed mutagenesis, the pDsRed-N1 vector with the cDNA encoding either talin fragment J (aa 1977-2113) or talin fragment B (aa 430-1076) was used as template (1Tremuth L. Kreis S.

The single and double amino acid substitutions P2109A, L2094A/I2095A, T2098A/K2099A were introduced into talin fragment J and the double amino acid substitutions L622A/L623A and M870A/V871A into talin fragment B using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Full-length wild type mouse talin1 cDNA, a generous gift from Dr. A. Huttenlocher (University of Wisconsin, Departments of Pediatrics and Pharmacology, Madison, WI) was cloned into the pEGFP-C1 vector (Invitrogen) in-frame with the upstream GFP coding sequence to generate GFP-talin1 WT. GFP-talin L2094A/I2095A was subsequently generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Successful mutagenesis of all constructs was confirmed by automated sequencing (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Indirect Immunofluorescence—Transiently transfected cells were detached with EDTA buffer (50 mm Hepes, 126 mm NaCl, 5mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5), washed, resuspended in serum-free Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, and seeded onto glass coverslips coated with fibrinogen (20 μg/ml). After a 2-h adhesion at 37 °C, the cells were fixed for 15 min at 4 °C in fixation buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 3% paraformaldehyde, 2% sucrose) and washed four times in washing buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% bovine serum albumin). For indirect immunofluorescence staining of the Myc-tagged talin fragments J, J1, J2, J3, and J4, the fixed cells were incubated for 40 min with a monoclonal mouse anti-Myc antibody followed by a 30-min incubation with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Immunofluorescent staining of β3 integrin was performed using the monoclonal antibody P37 and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated IgG antibody. Polymerized actin was stained with rhodamine phalloidin. After each incubation step the coverslips were washed three times for 5 min in washing buffer. Finally, the coverslips were mounted on microscopy glass slides using Mowiol/DABCO (Sigma). Single fluorescent images were collected on a conventional fluorescence microscope (Leica Leitz DMRB) with a ×63 oil immersion objective and a Leica DC 300F camera using the Leica IM1000 1.20 software. Images were processed digitally with Photoshop 6.0 (Adobe Systems). Western Blotting—CHO-αIIbβ3 cells transfected with full-length GFP-talin WT or GFP-talin LI/AA were detached with EDTA buffer, washed three times in PBS washing buffer, and lysed on ice in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 7 μm E64d, and 25 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation (4 °C, 10 min, 13,000 rpm), and protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Equal amounts of total protein (100 μg) were denatured in 1% SDS sample buffer (95 °C, 5 min), resolved by 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Western blot analysis of the transferred proteins was performed with the monoclonal anti-talin rod antibody TD77 according to standard procedures. Talin Peptide Dot Blot Overlay Assay—The cDNAs encoding the cytoplasmic tail of wild type β3(β3cyto, aa 716-762) or calcium and integrin-binding protein (CIB) inserted in the pGEX-4T-2 bacterial expression vector have been previously described (1Tremuth L.

Expression of GST alone and GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) was induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37°C. Cells were lysed as previously described (34Patel B. Gingras A.R. Bobkov A.A. Fujimoto L.M. Zhang M. Liddington R.C. Mazzeo D. Emsley J. Roberts G.C. Barsukov I.L. Critchley D.R. J. Biol.

Fusion proteins from the soluble fraction were affinity-purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Overlapping talin peptides 1 (aa 2077-2099), 2 (aa 2070-2091), and 3 (aa 2094-2115) were purchased from Neosystem SA, Strasbourg, France. The peptides were dotted on a nitrocellulose membrane with 0.5 or 1.5 nmol of peptide/spot. The membrane was blocked for 5 h in Trisbuffered saline (TBS) (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7) containing 1% of heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and overlaid overnight at 4 °C with GST-β3cyto or GST-CIB at 150 nm in TBS-T (5% nonfat milk and 0.1% Tween 20). The membrane was then rinsed three times for 5 min with TBS-T (5% nonfat milk, 0.05% Tween 20) and blocked for 1 h in TBS-T (5% nonfat milk, 0.1% Tween 20). Bound GST-β3cyto or GST-CIB was detected using polyclonal antibodies to GST or the integrin β3 subunit cytoplasmic tail and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies that were visualized using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce), according to the manufacturer's procedure. Limited Proteolysis of Wild Type and Mutant Talin Fragment G—The cDNA encoding talin fragment G was subcloned into the bacterial pET-29b+ vector (Invitrogen) to generate recombinant talin fragment G with a His tag at its C terminus (TalinG-His). Mutant L2094A/I2095A talinG-His fragment was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of recombinant talinG-His using the pET-29b+/talinG vector as a template. The L2094A/I2095A mutation was inserted as described above. Successful mutagenesis of the construct was confirmed by automated sequencing. Expression of His-tagged proteins was induced in E. coli BL21(DE3) bacteria with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The recombinant proteins were affinity purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Wild type and mutant L2094A/I2095A talinG-His fragments were subjected to limited trypsin proteolysis for 5 min, 30 min, or 4 h at room temperature using a trypsin/talin ratio of 1/100 (w/w). The proteolytic protein profile was resolved under reducing conditions on 12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blotting using a polyclonal anti-talin rod antibody raised in-house against a recombinant 7-kDa talin rod fragment comprising helices 50 and 51 (aa 2071-2135). In Vitro αIIbβ3-Talin Fragment G Pulldown Assay—The cDNA encoding talin fragment G inserted in the pGEX-4T-2 (GST-talin G) bacterial expression vector has been previously described (1Tremuth L. Kreis S. Melchior C. Hoebeke J. Ronde P. Plancon S. Takeda K. Kieffer N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22258-22266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced into GST-talin G cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis as described above, and successful mutagenesis was confirmed by automated sequencing. For direct protein-protein interaction assays, 200 μl of crude bacterial lysates containing GST-talin G WT, GST-talin G LI/AA, or GST alone were each mixed with 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads overnight at 4 °C and subsequently washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline (0.05% Tween 20). The precoated beads were then incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with 15 μg of integrin αIIbβ3 that was purified from outdated platelets (provided by Dr. J.-C. Faber, Luxembourg Red Cross Blood Transfusion Center) by Concanavalin A affinity chromatography and activated with 0.5 mm Mn2+ and the monoclonal antibody PAC-1 (5 μg/ml). Unbound proteins were washed off and the trapped proteins extracted with 25 μl of denaturing SDS-PAGE loading buffer (5 min, 100 °C) and submitted to 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Precipitated proteins were visualized by Western blot using antibodies to GST and integrin β3. Infrared Spectroscopy—For infrared spectroscopy, synthetic peptides (Neosystem SA, Strasbourg, France) (23 mers) corresponding to wild type helix 50 (peptide 1, aa 2077-2099) or the L2094A/I2095A mutated helix 50 of the human talin rod domain were used. Attenuated total reflection infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectra were obtained on a Bruker IFS55 FTIR spectrophotometer (Ettlingen, Germany) equipped with a mercurycadmium-telluride detector (broad band 12000-420 cm-1, liquid N2-cooled, 24-h hold time) at a resolution of 2 cm-1 with an aperture of 3.5 mm. The spectrometer was continuously purged with dry air (Whatman 75-62, Haverhill, MA). The internal reflection element was a 52 × 20 × 2-mm trapezoidal germanium ATR plate (ACM, Villiers St. Frédéric, France) with an aperture angle of 45° yielding 25 internal reflections. The germanium crystals were washed in Superdecontamine (Intersciences, AS, Brussels, Belgium), rinsed with distilled water, washed with methanol, then with chloroform, and finally placed for 2 min in a plasma cleaner PDC23G (Harrick, Ossining, NY) working under reduced air pressure. The peptides were dissolved in H2O at 10 mg/ml. Films were obtained by evaporating 5 μl (50 μg) or 20 μl of a 1 mg/ml solution (20 μg) on one side of the ATR plate under a stream of nitrogen. No difference related to the concentration could be detected. The germanium crystal was then placed in an ATR holder for liquid sample with an in- and outlet (Specac, Orpington, UK). The liquid cell was placed at 45° incidence on a Specac vertical ATR setup. For hydrogen/deuterium exchange, nitrogen gas was saturated with 2H2O by bubbling through a series of four vials containing 2H2O. The flow rate of 50 ml/min was controlled by a flowtube (Fisher Bioblock Scientific, Illkirch, France). Bubbling was started at least 1 h before starting the experiments. At the zero time, the tubing was connected to the cavity of the liquid cell chamber surrounding the film. 20 scans were recorded and averaged for each time point. All the software used for data processing was written under MatLab 7.1 (Mathworks Inc., Natick, Ma). Tentative Localization of the Talin IBS2 Site by a Bioinformatics Approach—Talin is an ancient, conserved cytoskeletal protein that is found in organisms ranging from the amoebozoan protozoa Dictyostelium discoideum to mammals (22Hemmings L. Rees D.J. Ohanian V. Bolton S.J. Gilmore A.P. Patel B. Priddle H. Trevithick J.E. Hynes R.O. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2715-2726PubMed Google Scholar, 23Senetar M.A. McCann R.O. Gene. 2005; 362: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Considering the similar functional properties and modular organization of invertebrate versus vertebrate talins, we hypothesized that functional domains in this protein including IBS2 should be conserved throughout evolution and that these domains could be identified by multiple sequence alignment. As shown in Fig. 1A, the overall sequence identity between human and Drosophila is only 47% but increases to 56% for the highly conserved C-terminal I/LWEQ actin binding domain (THATCH domain, aa 2339-2533) (23Senetar M.A. McCann R.O. Gene. 2005; 362: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24Brett T.J. Legendre-Guillemin V. McPherson P.S. Fremont D.H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To test our hypothesis, we performed sequence alignment of human talin residues 1974-2276 with the equivalent talin sequence of different species and searched for stretches of highest sequence identity. The sequence shown in Fig. 1B corresponds to the overlapping talin subfragment J (aa 1977-2113), which contains IBS2, and subfragment L (aa 2093-2270), previously shown not to localize in focal adhesions (1Tremuth L. Kreis S. Melchior C. Hoebeke J. Ronde P. Plancon S. Takeda K. Kieffer N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22258-22266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Interestingly, two separate regions could be clearly identified, one of 69% sequence identity (aa 1974-2169) corresponding roughly to talin fragment J and the second with only 36% sequence identity (aa 2170-2276), corresponding to fragment L (Fig. 1A). The structural organization of talin and the different recombinant talin fragments used in this study are shown in Fig. 1C. Expression of Overlapping Myc Fusion Proteins Covering Residues 1977-2113 of Fragment J in CHO-αIIbβ3-GFP Cells—To extend these in silico data, talin fragment J and four overlapping peptides of fragment J with a Myc-His tag at the C-terminal end, corresponding to talin residues 1977-2018 (J1), 2010-2049 (J2), 2042-2080 (J3), and 2072-2113 (J4), were transiently expressed in CHO cells stably transfected with integrin αIIbβ3-GFP. The subcellular localization of the recombinant fragments was visualized with an anti-Myc antibody. As previously reported by us, talin fragment J colocalized with integrin αIIbβ3 in focal adhesions (Fig. 2A) (1Tremuth L. Kreis S. Melchior C. Hoebeke J. Ronde P. Plancon S. Takeda K. Kieffer N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22258-22266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). When talin fragments J1, J2, J3, and J4 were tested, only fragment J4 exhibited a punctate fluorescence (red) that clearly colocalized with autofluorescent αIIbβ3-GFP (green) as demonstrated by the shift in color of the dots from green to yellow in the merged fluorescent picture, whereas fragments J1, J2, and J3 revealed a diffuse overall cytoplasmic staining and absent colocalization with β3-GFP (Fig. 2B). These data provide evidence that talin fragment J4 contains IBS2. Not surprisingly, fragment J4 corresponds to a highly conserved sequence identified by our bioinformatics approach and overlaps with α helix 50 of the talin rod domain (12Gingras A.R. Ziegler W.H. Frank R. Barsukov I.L. Roberts G.C. Critchley D.R. Emsley J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37217-37224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Delineation of the Integrin Binding Site in Talin Fragment J4 to the α Helix 50—To further delineate IBS2, three synthetic peptides covering the amino acid sequence of talin fragment J4 were used in an in vitro dot blot assay (Fig. 3). The synthetic peptides were spotted on a nitrocellulose membrane and overlaid with the recombinant integrin β3 subunit cytoplasmic tail fused to GST. Bound GST-β3cyto was detected using a polyclonal antibody to GST or to the β3-cytoplasmic tail. A specific interaction was observed for talin peptide 1, but not for peptide 2, whereas a weak interaction was seen for peptide 3, which overlaps for 6 residues with peptide 1 but has no sequence identity with peptide 2. No antibody binding was observed when the spotted membrane was overlaid with GST-CIB, a protein interacting with the integrin αIIb subunit cytoplasmic tail and used here as a negative control. Increased antibody binding was only observed for peptides 1 and 3 with an increase of peptide concentration (result not shown). These data provide evidence that talin peptide 1 corresponding to residues 2077-2099 of the talin rod domain interacts with the integrin β3 subunit cytoplasmic tail and thus contains the IBS2 site. This minimal IBS2 sequence corresponds exactly to the α helix 50 of the talin rod (12Gingras A.R. Ziegler W.H. Frank R. Barsukov I.L. Roberts"

The 700-kDa assembly is comprised of 14 α-type and 14 β-type subunits, which form a cylindrical architecture composed of four stacked heptameric rings (α7β7β7α7). The formation of the 20 S proteasome is a complex process that involves a cascade of folding, assembly, and processing events. To date, the understanding of the assembly pathway is incomplete due to the experimental challenges of capturing short-lived intermediates. In this study, we have applied a real-time mass spectrometry approach to capture transient species along the assembly pathway of the 20 S proteasome from Rhodococcus erythropolis. In the course of assembly, we observed formation of an early α/β-heterodimer as well as an unprocessed half-proteasome particle. Formation of mature holoproteasomes occurred in concert with the disappearance of half-proteasomes. We also analyzed the β-subunits before and during assembly and reveal that those with longer propeptides are incorporated into half- and full proteasomes more rapidly than those that are heavily truncated. To characterize the preholoproteasome, formed by docking of two unprocessed half-proteasomes and not observed during assembly of wild type subunits, we trapped this intermediate using a β-subunit mutational variant. In summary, this study provides evidence for transient intermediates in the assembly pathway and reveals detailed insight into the cleavage sites of the propeptide.

Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1932) Google Scholar). In mammals, complexity is enhanced further by three γ-interferon inducible subunits, which are incorporated into the proteasome during the immune response (for a review, see Ref. 8Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 739-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). The bacterial proteasome from the actinomycetes Rhodococcus erythropolis is intermediate in complexity, consisting of two α-type and two β-type subunits. Any of the four possible combinations of α- and β-type subunits assembles to fully active proteasomes in vivo and in vitro (9Zuhl F. Tamura T. Dolenc I. Cejka Z. Nagy I. De Mot R. Baumeister W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).β-subunits of 20 S proteasomes from both eukaryotes and prokaryotes are expressed in a precursor form, with a propeptide sequence at the N terminus. Interestingly, the propeptides from different organisms are highly divergent and are thought to play different roles in proteasome assembly and activation (10Kruger E. Kloetzel P.M. Enenkel C. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 11Seemuller E. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. The Enzymes.3rd Ed. XXII. Academic Press, Orlando, FL2001: 335-371Google Scholar). During the course of assembly, they are post-translationally processed and removed (12Seemuller E. Lupas A. Baumeister W. Nature. 1996; 382: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This autocatalytic mechanism exposes the catalytic nucleophile (i.e. the N-terminal threonine) and ensures that active sites are formed only after completion of the assembly process (13Zuhl F. Seemuller E. Golbik R. Baumeister W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In contrast to the short and often dispensable propeptides of the archaeal β-type subunits (14Wilson H.L. Ou M.S. Aldrich H.C. Maupin-Furlow J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1680-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 15Maupin-Furlow J.A. Aldrich H.C. Ferry J.G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1480-1487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Zwickl P. Kleinz J. Baumeister W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), the Rhodococcus β1- and β2-subunits are translated as precursor proteins with relatively long propeptides of 65 and 59 residues, respectively. In the absence of these propeptides, the rate of formation of the proteasome complex is retarded (13Zuhl F. Seemuller E. Golbik R. Baumeister W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In general, the propeptide sequence of eubacteria comprises a region of about 15 amino acids near the center of the propeptide (Ser-42 to Pro-27), which exhibits significant conservation (17Nagy I. Tamura T. Vanderleyden J. Baumeister W. De Mot R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5448-5453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Designated the “central box,” this region is assumed to be important for propeptide function. Similarly, propeptides from eukaryotic β-type subunits comprise more than 70 residues and have been shown to be essential for proteasome biogenesis and cell viability (18Schmidtke G. Kraft R.

Cell. 1996; 86: 961-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar).The relatively low complexity of archaeal 20 S proteasomes has allowed the first studies of assembly. When archaeal proteasomal α- and β-subunits are co-expressed in Escherichia coli, mature and fully active 20 S proteasomes are formed (16Zwickl P. Kleinz J. Baumeister W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 21Groll M. Brandstetter H. Bartunik H. Bourenkow G. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In vitro studies of subunits individually produced demonstrate that the archaeal assembly appears to be conserved (12Seemuller E. Lupas A. Baumeister W. Nature. 1996; 382: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 14Wilson H.L. Ou M.S. Aldrich H.C. Maupin-Furlow J. J.

Maack S. Puhler G. Wiegand G. Baumeister W. Jaenicke R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 1061-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with the formation of seven-membered α-subunit rings providing a platform or template onto which the β-sub-units are mounted (Fig. 1, pathway a). Nevertheless, it is note-worthy that there is no evidence for rings of α-subunits forming as intermediates in the in vivo assembly pathway of archaebacterial proteasomes. In contrast, in vitro assembly experiments of recombinant Rhodococcus proteasomes (9Zuhl F. Tamura T. Dolenc I. Cejka Z. Nagy I. De Mot R. Baumeister W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 23Mayr J. Seemuller E. Muller S.A. Engel A. Baumeister W. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 124: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) showed that individual α- and β-subunits remain monomeric and inactive, whereas they spontaneously form active proteasomes when allowed to interact. Therefore, it is likely that the first intermediates in the assembly pathway are α/β-subunit precursor heterodimers (Fig. 1, pathway b). However, this early intermediate species has not been identified experimentally. It is established, however, that the assembly proceeds via the formation of half-proteasomes composed of one α-subunit ring and one unprocessed β-subunit ring (α7β7). Two half-proteasomes assemble further to form a preholoproteasome, a species that still contains the unprocessed β-subunits (13Zuhl F. Seemuller E. Golbik R. Baumeister W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 23Mayr J. Seemuller E. Muller S.A. Engel A. Baumeister W. J. Struct.

Finally, processing of the β-subunits occurs, and the mature holoproteasome (α7β7β7α7) is formed (9Zuhl F. Tamura T. Dolenc I. Cejka Z. Nagy I. De Mot R. Baumeister W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 20Chen P. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1996; 86: 961-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Recently, the study of mutational variants from Rhodococcus proteasomes revealed that the dimerization and self-processing of the β-subunit precursors is accompanied by a conformational change of the β-subunit and that this is needed for the correct coordination of the active site residue (25Witt S.

Structure (Camb.). 2006; 14: 1179-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).The aim of the present study was to investigate the assembly pathway of the 20 S proteasome from Rhodococcus, using an approach not applied previously to the assembly of the proteasome, that of mass spectrometry (MS) 7The abbreviations used are: MS, mass spectrometry; Suc, succinyl; AMC, amido-4-methylcoumarin. 7The abbreviations used are: MS, mass spectrometry; Suc, succinyl; AMC, amido-4-methylcoumarin. of protein complexes in their native state (26van den Heuvel R.H. Heck A.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2004; 8: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 27Benesch J.L. Robinson C.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2006; 16: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We report here the in vitro assembly of α- and β-subunits expressed separately, incubated together and monitored in real-time by MS. This approach enables time-dependent mass changes to be recorded directly by continuous sampling into the gas phase where the reaction is quenched. This method has been applied previously to smaller oligomeric complexes than the proteasome (28Fandrich M. Tito M.A. Leroux M.R. Rostom A.A. Hartl F.U. Dobson C.M. Robinson C.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14151-14155Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 29Remaut H. Rose R.J. Hannan T.J. Hultgren S.J. Radford S.E. Ashcroft A.E. Waksman G. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 831-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). By recording mass spectra throughout the reaction time course, we were able to monitor the formation of an early assembly intermediate, namely the α/β-heterodimer, the half-proteasomes, as well as mature 28-subunit 20 S proteasomes. In addition, we were able to determine in great detail the sites that are cleaved within the β-subunit propeptides during the different assembly states. More generally, besides providing valuable insight into the assembly process, the results highlight the power of this method for structural biology and biogenesis studies of macro-molecular complexes in particular.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and Mutagenesis—For reasons of simplicity and the availability of the crystal structure of a simplified α1β120S proteasome from R. erythropolis (24Kwon Y.D. Nagy I. Adams P.D. Baumeister W. Jap B.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), only one type of α-subunit and one type of β-subunit was used for the in vitro and in vivo assembly experiments. The single gene constructs pT7-7 α1His6 and pT7-7 β1His6 encoding the C-terminal His-tagged α- and β-subunit, respectively, where used for the in vitro assembly experiments. For the in vivo assays, the bicistronic expression plasmid (pT7-7 β1His6-α1) was used for recombinant co-expression of the genes encoding the α1- and the β1-subunit (tagged with a C-terminal His6 tag) leading to active, mature proteasomes assembled in vivo. All plasmids were a kind gift of Dr. Frank Zühl.The latter plasmid was also used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis experiments. The β1His6-subunit residues Asp-173 and Asp-176 were mutated to alanines in the single gene construct using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. The experiments were performed according to the manufacturer's manual. The sequence of the mutant construct was verified by non-radioactive DNA sequencing.Expression and Purification—Cells of the E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) (Stratagene) were transformed with the respective expression plasmid and grown in 6 liters LB medium to mid-log phase at 30 °C. After induction with a final concentration of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 5 h, cells were harvested and resuspended in sonication buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete EDTA-free (Roche Applied Science) used according to the manufacturer's specifications), treated for 30 min on ice with lysozyme 1 mg/ml (Sigma) and a few grains of DNase I (Roche Applied Science), and sonicated for 15 min (Sonifier 250, Branson). The lysate was further fractionated first by a low speed spin (6000 × g, 15 min) followed by a high-speed spin (30, 000 × g, 30 min). The supernatant was filtered and directly loaded onto a 1-ml His-trap column (GE Healthcare), previously equilibrated with buffer A (20 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.4). Protein bound nonspecifically was removed with 10 column volumes of buffer A. Assembled proteasomes as well as single subunits were eluted with a gradient of 20-500 mm imidazole. Fractions were analyzed by 12% Schaegger SDS-PAGE and 4-20% Novex Tris-glycine native PAGE (Invitrogen). Fractions containing the designated proteins were pooled, concentrated, dialyzed against gel filtration buffer (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5), and applied to a High Load 16/60 Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) previously equilibrated with gel filtration buffer. Fractions were analyzed by 12% Schaegger SDS-PAGE and 4-20% Novex Tris-glycine native PAGE (Invitrogen). Those fractions containing 20 S proteasomes or the individual subunits were pooled, concentrated, and used for subsequent analysis.Native PAGE Analysis—4-20% Novex Tris-glycine native PAGE (Invitrogen) was used to probe the assembly state of in vitro assembled α- and β-subunits. 1 nm of each individually purified subunit was mixed in a final total volume of 250 μl of the assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 s, 2 min, 5 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, or overnight. Reactions were quenched by flash-freezing the samples in liquid nitrogen, and the samples were applied to the native PAGE system run at 4 °C. The in vivo assembled wild type proteasome and the individual purified subunits were used as controls.Proteolysis Assay—The synthetic fluorogenic peptide Suc-LLVY-AMC (Bachem, Heidelberg, Germany), dissolved in Me2SO, was used as a substrate for measuring the proteolytic activity (13Zuhl F. Seemuller E. Golbik R. Baumeister W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity was measured by a FluoStar Optima spectrophotometer at a reaction temperature of 37 °C ± 0.5 °C. Either 200 pmol of β-subunit or 14.3 pmol of in vivo assembled holoproteasomes was equilibrated with assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) in 96-well micro-titer plates at 37 °C. After about 10 min, 50 μl of 40 μm substrate solution (0.5% final concentration Me2SO) was added to the assay solution containing the individual β-subunit and incubated for a further 10 min. The reaction was initiated by the addition of either 200 pmol of α-subunit to the β-subunit/substrate solution or 50 μl of 40 μm substrate solution (0.5% final concentration of Me2SO) to the holoproteasome, resulting in equimolar amounts of either in vitro or in vivo assembled proteasomes and a final concentration of 10 μm Suc-LLVY-AMC in a total final volume of 200 μl. Fluorescence of the reaction mixture was assayed immediately. Reaction progress was monitored at 53-s intervals by measuring the relative fluorescence of each well using excitation and emission wavelengths of 320 and 460 nm, respectively. Each experiment was repeated at least three times.Mass Spectrometry—Nanoflow electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS and tandem MS experiments were conducted on a high mass Q-TOF type instrument (30Sobott F. Hernandez H. McCammon M.G. Tito M.A. Robinson C.V. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 1402-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) adapted for a QSTAR XL platform (31Chernushevich I.V. Thomson B.A. Anal. Chem. 2004; 76: 1754-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Conditions were carefully chosen to allow the ionization and detection of proteasome assemblies without disrupting non-covalent interactions. Prior to MS analysis, 0.3-0.6 mg/ml aliquots of α- and β-subunits samples were concentrated 5-10 times and buffer-exchanged into 1 m ammonium acetate solution using Nanosep (Pall) columns. Subsequently, the concentrations of the α- and β-subunit-containing solutions were determined by UV absorbance. The assembly reaction was analyzed at 4, 25, and 37 °C after mixing equimolar quantities of the α- and β-subunits at various time intervals until the reaction was complete. The first time point was taken 2 min after incubating the two subunits.Typically, aliquots of 2 μl of solution were electrosprayed from gold-coated borosilicate capillaries prepared in-house as described (32Hernandez H. Robinson C.V. Nat. Protocols. 2007; 2: 715-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The following experimental parameters were used: capillary voltage up to 1.2 kV, declustering potential 100-150 V, focusing potential 200-250 V, declustering potential two 15-55 V, and collision energy up to 130 V, MCP 2350 V. In tandem MS experiments, the relevant m/z value was isolated, and argon gas was admitted to the collision cell with an acceleration potential of up to 180 V. All spectra were calibrated externally by using a solution of cesium iodide (100 mg/ml). Spectra are shown here with minimal smoothing and without background subtraction.RESULTSBiochemical Analysis of the in Vitro Assembly—The formation of the fully assembled proteasome complex was monitored initially in a time-dependent manner by native PAGE analysis (Fig. 2A). The individual α1- and β1-subunits give rise to bands corresponding to trimeric α1-subunits and individual β1-subunits, which appear as more than one distinct band, indicating some proteolysis. Assembly was probed at several time points between 30 s and 16 h after introducing the α1- and β1-subunits at 37 °C (Fig. 2A). Two bands appear initially, one in the molecular mass range of a half-proteasome (∼440 kDa). The second band has a higher molecular mass (>669 kDa) and corresponds to the holoproteasome (α7β7β7α7). Despite the fact that aliquots of the assembly assay were flash-frozen, the only detectable intermediate by native PAGE is the half-proteasome. The appearance of fully assembled proteasomes is in accord with the disappearance of half-proteasomes, and depletion of the individual subunits is in agreement with previous results (13Zuhl F. Seemuller E. Golbik R. Baumeister W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Biochemical analysis of the in vitro assembly process. A, Coomassie Blue-stained native PAGE of the time-dependence of in vitro assembly. Equimolar quantities of individually purified wild type α1- and β1-subunits were incubated at 37 °C for 30 s (lane 1), 2 min (lane 2), 5 min (lane 3), 30 min (lane 4), 1 h (lane 5), 2 h (lane 6), or overnight (lane 7) and applied to PAGE analysis. The “high molecular weight calibration kit” for native electrophoresis (Amersham Biosciences) was used: tyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferrodoxin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (140 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (67 kDa) (M). B, proteolytic activity occurring during the in vitro assembly process is assayed by the time-dependent relative increase in fluorescence caused by the release of the fluorescent dye during hydrolysis of the Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC. The reaction progress curve is referred to as α1+β1 in vitro.Asa control, the reaction progress curve for the proteolytic activity of the in vivo assembled proteasome, referred to as (α1β1 in vivo), was probed under the same conditions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To compare the activity of proteasomes assembled in this in vitro assembly reaction with those isolated after assembly in vivo, we used a fluorescence-based assay. We compared the rate of proteolysis of a fluorogenic peptide substrate during in vitro assembly with that of active, mature proteasomes assembled in vivo. Prior to cleavage of the peptide substrate, fluorescence is quenched, whereas upon proteolytic cleavage, an increase in fluorescence can be monitored. For in vivo assembled proteasomes, this proteolysis assay is characterized by a steep initial increase in fluorescence. The slope can be fitted to a first order kinetic whose saturation (at ∼250 s) is due to substrate depletion (Fig. 2B). This demonstrates that there is no lag phase in the cleavage reaction under these conditions. Rather, cleavage is initiated immediately after the in vivo assembled proteasome is introduced to the peptide. By contrast, for the in vitro assembly reaction, in which individual α-subunits are introduced to β-subunits together with the fluorogenic substrate, an initial lag phase is clearly observed. Moreover, activity is found to increase five times more slowly than for the corresponding reaction with in vivo assembled proteasomes. This shows that despite the assembly reaction producing high molecular weight species after ∼120 s (Fig. 2A), activity is gained at a much slower rate, with saturation occurring after ∼1400 s. This difference between assembly rate and activity can be explained by the requirement for processing of β-subunits before full proteolytic function of the proteasome is achieved in vitro.Monitoring the in Vitro Assembly by MS—Nanoflow ESI mass spectra were recorded for the individual subunits of the proteasome, the α1- and β1-subunits, prior to carrying out the assembly reaction, Fig. 3. For the α1-subunit, only one major series of peaks is observed (Fig. 3A), with a measured mass consistent with that calculated for an α1-subunit without the first Met residue and including a C-terminal His6 (Table 1). Additional series of peaks are assigned to minor populations of α/α-homodimers and trimers, emphasizing the tendency of the α1-subunit to aggregate. This observation is in agreement with the native PAGE analysis of α1-subunits. In the spectrum recorded for the β1-subunits (Fig. 3B), we could not identify full-length β1-subunits (31,983 Da including the His6 tag). However, a set of 12 degradation products was assigned, corresponding to removal of the first 18, 22, 23, 25, 28, 29, 32, 36, 40, 42, 48, and 50 residues of the propeptide, denoted Δ18, Δ22, etc. (Table 1). The predominant degradation product is the Δ18 species. From the masses of these species, we can determine that all the cleavage sites in these degradation products are located within the propeptide sequence, residues Ser-48 to Thr-16 (Table 1, Fig. 3E).FIGURE 3Electrospray MS analysis of the monomeric α1-and β1-subunits during the assembly reaction.

TA2.A1 and comparison with other atp operons from alkaliphilic bacteria reveals the presence of a conserved lysine residue at position 180 (Bacillus sp. TA2.A1 numbering) within the a subunit of these F1Fo-ATP synthases. We hypothesize that the basic nature of this residue is ideally suited to capture protons from the bulk phase at high pH. To test this hypothesis, a heterologous expression system for the ATP synthase from Bacillus sp. TA2.A1 (TA2F1Fo) was developed in Escherichia coli DK8 (Δatp). Amino acid substitutions were made in the a subunit of TA2F1Fo at position 180. Lysine (aK180) was substituted for the basic residues histidine (aK180H) or arginine (aK180R), and the uncharged residue glycine (aK180G). ATP synthesis experiments were performed in ADP plus Pi-loaded right-side-out membrane vesicles energized by ascorbate-phenazine methosulfate. When these enzyme complexes were examined for their ability to perform ATP synthesis over the pH range from 7.0 to 10.0, TA2F1Fo and aK180R showed a similar pH profile having optimum ATP synthesis rates at pH 9.0–9.5 with no measurable ATP synthesis at pH 7.5. Conversely, aK180H and aK180G showed maximal ATP synthesis at pH values 8.0 and 7.5, respectively. ATP synthesis under these conditions for all enzyme forms was sensitive to DCCD. These data strongly imply that amino acid residue Lys180 is a specific adaptation within the a subunit of TA2F1Fo to facilitate proton capture at high pH. At pH values near the pKa of Lys180, the trapped protons readily dissociate to reach the subunit c binding sites, but this dissociation is impeded at neutral pH values causing either a blocking of the proposed H+ channel and/or mechanism of proton translocation, and hence ATP synthesis is inhibited.

For nearly all aerobic life on earth, the F1Fo-ATP synthases are the major enzymes responsible for providing ATP to drive endergonic reactions of the cell. These two domain membrane-bound enzymes are found in mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria, coupling protons or Na+ ions to the synthesis of ATP (1Dimroth P. von Ballmoos C. Meier T.

The intracellular water-soluble F1 domain contains the catalytic sites of the enzyme, while the bulk of the hydrophobic Fo domain is embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane and contains the functional center for the capture and translocation of protons. The bacterial F1 domain has a stoichiometry of α3β3γδ∈ in which the catalytic nucleotide-binding sites are formed by each of the β subunits and the non-catalytic nucleotide-binding sites are located in the α subunits (3Abrahams J.P.

The Fo domain consists of one a subunit, two b subunits making the stator, and a ring of 10–15 c subunits depending on the species (6Meier T. Ferguson S.A. Cook G.M. Dimroth P. Vonck J. J.

The coupling of ion translocation to the rotational mechanism of the Fo c-ring forces open, loose, or tight conformational changes within the β subunits of the F1 domain, driving the synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (13Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). Conversely, the F1 domain can hydrolyze ATP causing the reverse rotation of the c-ring and pumping protons into the bulk phase, a mechanism that is absent in aerobic alkaliphilic organisms (14Cook G.M.

With F1Fo-ATP synthases that operate in a neutral to acidic pH environment, proton coupling is an energetically favorable process as the proton concentration outside the cell exceeds that in the cytoplasm. For example, at pH 7.1 Escherichia coli generates an electrochemical gradient of protons (ΔμH+) 4The abbreviations used are: ΔμH+, electrochemical proton gradient; Δψ, transmembrane electrical potential; ΔpH, transmembrane pH gradient; TA2F1Fo, F1Fo-ATP synthase from Bacillus sp.

Annu. Rev. Micro. 1985; 39: 219-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In bacteria that inhabit alkaline pH environments, the magnitude of the ΔμH+ is markedly lower (in the range –50 to –100 mV) because of the inverted pH gradient (acidicin, alkalineout) (19Olsson K. Keis S. Morgan H.W. Dimroth P. Cook G.M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20Hoffmann A. Dimroth P. Eur. J.

Despite this apparent thermodynamic problem, the aerobic alkaliphilic bacteria studied to date employ a proton-coupled ATP synthase (14Cook G.M. Keis S. Morgan H.W. von Ballmoos C. Matthey U. Kaim G. Dimroth P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4442-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 15Hicks D.B. Krulwich T.A. J. Biol.

The apparent thermodynamic problem is based on a mechanism with a delocalized ΔμH+ in the bulk phase but could be overcome by a more localized proton pathway between the respiratory chain and the ATP synthase. Support for such a model has been provided by Guffanti et al. (22Guffanti A.A. Chiu E. Krulwich T.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 239: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 23Guffanti A.A. Fuchs R.T. Schneier M. Chiu E. Krulwich T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2971-2975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who demonstrated in Bacillus firmus RAB that a respiration-derived ΔμH+ could drive ATP synthesis at pH 9.0, but a valinomycin-mediated potassium-diffusion potential could not. Apart from the thermodynamic problem of synthesizing ATP at high environmental pH, the alkaliphilic ATP synthase must also solve the problem of proton capture from an alkaline environment and subsequent translocation to the binding sites on the c-ring. Sequence analysis reveals that the atp operon gene arrangement and deduced primary structure of the ATP synthase from alkaliphilic bacteria and other eubacteria are similar (24Ivey D.M. Krulwich T.A. Res. Microbiol. 1992; 143: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 25Ivey D.M. Krulwich T.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 26Keis S. Kaim G. Dimroth P. Cook G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1676: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). As reported by Ivey and Krulwich (24Ivey D.M. Krulwich T.A. Res. Microbiol. 1992; 143: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 25Ivey D.M. Krulwich T.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), greatest variation from amino acid consensus is observed in the a and c subunits that are crucial for proton translocation. The E. coli a subunit is a hydrophobic protein, spanning the membrane five to six times (27Valiyaveetil F.I. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol.

Angevine C.M. Dmitriev O.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 29Angevine C.M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol.

A. 2003; 100: 13179-13183Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the a subunits of alkaliphilic ATP synthases (Fig. 1), an invariant lysine residue at position 180 (Lys180) (Bacillus pseudofirmus OF4 numbering) is located in transmembrane helix 4 (aTMH4) (24Ivey D.M. Krulwich T.A. Res. Microbiol. 1992; 143: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 25Ivey D.M. Krulwich T.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 229: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Moreover, a glycine is also found in alkaliphiles at position 212 (B. pseudofirmus OF4 numbering) in aTMH5 opposite Lys180. Wang et al. (31Wang Z. Hicks D.B. Guffanti A.A. Baldwin K. Krulwich T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26546-26554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have proposed that these residues form a gated channel residing within the proton uptake pathway of the a subunit through which protons pass onto the neighboring c subunit. In studying the role of these residues in growth of the facultative alkaliphile B. pseudofirmus OF4 on fermentable and non-fermentable carbon sources at pH 7.5 and pH 10.5 (31Wang Z. Hicks D.B. Guffanti A.A. Baldwin K. Krulwich T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26546-26554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the authors demonstrate that when Lys180 is substituted for glycine, B. pseudofirmus OF4 is no longer able to grow at high pH (i.e. 10.5) on non-fermentable malate. However, the cells still grow on a fermentable carbon source at both pH 7.5 and 10.5 (31Wang Z. Hicks D.B. Guffanti A.A. Baldwin K. Krulwich T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26546-26554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This also correlated with low rates of ATP synthesis performed by right-side-out (RSO) membrane vesicles of the aK180G mutant at pH 10.5 when energized by ascorbate-phenazine methosulfate. Interestingly, when ATP synthesis was energized via a valinomycin-mediated potassium diffusion potential, the rates of ATP synthesis were ∼2-fold higher in the aK180G mutant at pH 8.3, compared with the wild type, suggesting that a lysine was less effective at lower pH values (31Wang Z.

We have recently initiated studies on the F1Fo-ATP synthase from the thermoalkaliphile Bacillus sp. TA2.A1 (14Cook G.M. Keis S. Morgan H.W. von Ballmoos C. Matthey U. Kaim G. Dimroth P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4442-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 19Olsson K. Keis S. Morgan H.W. Dimroth P. Cook G.M. J.

Like other alkaliphilic ATP synthases, the a subunit of strain TA2.A1 also harbors a conserved lysine residue at position 180 (Bacillus sp. TA2.A1 numbering) (Fig. 1) and we hypothesize that its side chain amino group acts as a base to capture protons at high environmental pH. In this communication, we report on the development of a heterologous expression system to overproduce and purify recombinant F1Fo-ATP synthase from Bacillus sp. TA2.A1 (TA2F1Fo) to address this hypothesis. Various amino acid substitutions in the a subunit were introduced to replace the lysine at position 180 (viz. glycine, histidine, and arginine) and the effect of external pH on ATP synthesis was studied in ADP plus Pi-loaded right-side-out membrane vesicles of E. coli DK8 expressing TA2F1Fo. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—E. coli DH10B (34Hanahan D. Jessee J. Bloom F.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 63-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) was used for all cloning experiments and E. coli DK8 (35Klionsky D.J. Brusilow W.S.A. Simoni R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 1055-1060Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), lacking the ATP synthase genes encoding the unc operon (Δatp), was used to overproduce the F1Fo-ATP synthase of Bacillus sp. TA2.A1 (TA2F1Fo) and the E. coli F1Fo-ATP synthase (ECF1Fo). Plasmids used were pUC19 (36Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11464) Google Scholar) for cloning, pTrc99A (Amersham Biosciences) for overexpression of TA2F1Fo enzymes, and pBWU13 (37Moriyama Y. Iwamoto A. Hanada H. Maeda M. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22141-22146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which carries the unc operon coding for ECF1Fo. To overproduce ATP synthases, transformants of E. coli DK8 were routinely grown in 2× YT medium (38Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 2 g/liter glucose and 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. For complementation studies, transformants of E. coli DK8 were selected on M13 minimal media (39Kaim G. Dimroth P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 726-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) supplemented with 10 μg/ml thiamine, 50 μg/ml each of alanine, valine, asparagine, and isoleucine, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, and 35 mm succinate as a non-fermentable carbon and energy source over a pH range of 7–9.5. Control plates contained the same amount of glucose in lieu of succinate. Plates were incubated for 2–5 days at 37 °C before scoring for growth. Construction of an Expression Plasmid for TA2F1Fo—In a previous study (26Keis S. Kaim G. Dimroth P. Cook G.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1676: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the Bacillus sp. TA2.A1 genes encoding for the subunits of the F1Fo-ATP synthase were cloned in pUC8 as three overlapping fragments in plasmids pF10 (containing atpIBEFH), pB9 (containing atpHAGD′), and pA3 (containing atpGDC). To assemble the atp genes atpIBEFHAG and part of atpD, a 2.3-kb SalI-BamHI fragment from pF10 and a 3.4-kb BamHI-SacI fragment from pB9 were simultaneously cloned into pUC19 (36Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11464) Google Scholar) digested with SalI and SacI to create plasmid pContigW1. The remainder of the atp genes (viz. atpD and atpC) were inserted as a 1.5-kb SacI-EcoRI fragment from pA3 into pContigW1 digested with the same restriction enzymes, to create plasmid pTA2ATP. Subsequently, the entire atp operon was cloned as a 7.2-kb SalI fragment from pTA2ATP into the expression vector pTrc99A (Amersham Biosciences) under the control of the strong tryptophan promoter to create plasmid pTrcATP9. To facilitate purification of TA2F1Fo, a 960-bp SspI-SacI fragment, coding for a hexa-histidine tag at the N terminus of the β subunit, was cloned simultaneously with a 1.7-kb BglII-SspI fragment from pB9, and a 1.3-kb SacI-ClaI fragment from pA3, into pTrcATP9 digested with BglII and ClaI. This expression plasmid was designated pATPHis5. The fragment containing the hexa-histidine tag was created by the overlap extension PCR method (40Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar) as follows. Two pairs of primers, A3fwd2 (5′-CTACATGGTGATCACCTCAG-3′) with atpDHisrev (5′-GTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGCACGCGTTTTCCCTCCTCGCTTTA-3′) and atpDHisfwd (5′-GTGCACCACCACCACCACCACAATAAAGGACGTATCATCCAAGTT-3′) with A3rev3(5′-GGAGCCAAAAGGTCAATCAC-3′) were used to generate DNA fragments with six histidine codons (correspond to underlined nucleotides). These overlapping fragments were then used for overlap extension PCR with the external primers A3fwd2 and A3rev3, and the product obtained was digested with SspI and SacI. Expression and Purification of TA2F1Fo—DK8 harboring plasmid pATPHis5 was grown to an A600 of 0.35 to 0.4. The culture was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and incubation continued for 5 h. Cells were harvested, washed with pre-cooled resuspension buffer A (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2), and resuspended in the same buffer. Phenylmethylsulfonyl flouride was added to 0.1 mm, and the cells were disrupted by two passages through a French pressure cell at 20,000 psi. Pancreatic DNaseI was added to 0.1 mg/ml, and the mixture was kept on ice for 1 h or until viscosity decreased. Lysate was cleared of debris by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 10 min and the inverted membrane vesicles were pelleted from the supernatant at 180,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Inverted membrane vesicles were washed in resuspension buffer A, followed by another wash in resuspension buffer A containing 1% (w/v) sodium cholate. To extract TA2F1Fo from the cytoplasmic membrane, membrane vesicles were diluted to 5 mg of protein/ml in solubilization buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 2% dodecyl maltoside (DDM), 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole) and incubated at room temperature with gentle stirring for 1 h. The non-solubilized material was removed by ultracentrifugation (180,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C), and the supernatant was incubated with gentle agitation for 45 min at room temperature with a slurry of Nickel-Sepharose High Performance (Amersham Biosciences), that was previously washed with water and equilibrated with IMAC buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.05% DDM, 500 mm NaCl) containing 10 mm imidazole. To remove contaminating proteins, the resin was washed with IMAC buffer containing 40 mm imidazole, and TA2F1Fo was eluted with IMAC buffer supplemented with 150 mm imidazole. To remove excess salt, the eluted TA2F1Fo was precipitated with 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000 overnight on ice. The precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation at 54,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and resuspended in resuspension buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.05% DDM). The PEG-precipitated enzyme was applied to a POROS 50 HQ (Applied Biosystems) anion-exchange column, which was equilibrated with resuspension buffer B. Bound proteins were eluted with twelve column volumes of a linear gradient of 0–600 mm NaCl in the same buffer containing 0.05% DDM. The ATPase-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated to 30 mg/ml using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter devices (molecular weight cutoff ((MWCO), 100,000). The concentrated sample was then applied to a Superose 6 (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column and fractionated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl buffer containing 0.05% DDM. The eluted TA2F1Fo-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated to 10 mg/ml using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter devices (MWCO, 100,000). Native TA2F1Fo was purified from Bacillus sp. TA2.A1 as described previously (14Cook G.M. Keis S. Morgan H.W. von Ballmoos C. Matthey U. Kaim G. Dimroth P. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4442-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Construction and Purification of aK180 Mutants—To substitute the Lys180 residue (Bacillus sp. TA2.A1 numbering) in the a subunit of TA2F1Fo, oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the reverse primer 5′-CCTGTGCTGTTGCTTTATTG-3′, located upstream from a PstI site, and Phusion DNA polymerase (Finnzymes) that produces blunt-ended amplification products. Mutagenic forward primers were as follows: 5′-ATTTTTGCCGGAGAAACATT-3′ for aK180G; 5′-ATTTTTGCCCACGAAACATT-3′ for aK180H; and 5′-ATTTTTGCCCGCGAAACATT-3′ for aK180R, where the first three nucleotides in each primer comprise the 3′-half of the blunt-ended SspI recognition site and the underlined nucleotides introduce the mutation. Each of the amplified products was digested with PstI, and the resulting 370-bp product was simultaneously cloned with a 1.1-kb XbaI-SspI fragment and a 1.5-kb PstI-BglII fragment from pTrcATP9, into pATPHis5 digested with XbaI and BglII. The new plasmids were designated pK180G, pK180H, and pK180R. The regions amplified by PCR were confirmed by DNA sequencing, and the recombinant plasmids were transformed into E. coli DK8. The aK180 mutants were expressed and extracted from DK8 inverted membrane vesicles, followed by purification and PEG precipitation as outlined above for TA2F1Fo. Preparation of RSO ADP plus Pi-loaded Membrane Vesicles—Plasmid transformants of E. coli DK8 were grown to an A600 of 0.25, before addition of 1 mm IPTG to induce expression. RSO membrane vesicles were prepared from mid-log phase cultures (A600 of 1.1) by previously described methods (41Kaback H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 22: 99-120Crossref Scopus (554) Google Scholar, 42Short S.A. Kaback H.R. Kohn L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4291-4296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception that cellular debris and unbroken spheroplasts were removed by low speed centrifugation at 480 × g, 15 min, instead of 730 × g, 30 min. Spheroplasts were prepared in a hypertonic buffer (33 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 22% sucrose, 20 mm EDTA) containing 1.0 mg/ml lysozyme and gently stirred at room temperature for 40 min. Spheroplasts were pelleted by centrifugation at 11,600 × g, resuspended with an 18-gauge needle in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) containing 20 mm MgSO4, 20% sucrose (pH 7.8), and 5 mg/ml DNaseI and lysed by osmotic shock, by diluting 100-fold into 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) containing 5 mm ADP. The suspension was stirred for 15 min at room temperature before the addition of 10 mm EDTA and 15 mm MgSO4, stirring for 15 min at room temperature between steps. The suspension was centrifuged at 22,300 × g, and the pellet was resuspended in pre-cooled 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) containing 10 mm EDTA and 5 mm ADP. Cellular debris and unbroken spheroplasts were removed by low speed centrifugation (480 × g, 15 min). RSO membrane vesicles were harvested by centrifuging the supernatant at 180,000 × g for 45 min and resuspending in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) containing 2 mm MgCl2 and 10% glycerol. Estimates of the fraction of vesicles in the opposite orientation using these methods vary, but they generally range from 10 to 20% (43Short S.A. Kaback H.R. Kaczorowski G. Fisher J. Walsh C.T.

Bacteriol. 1974; 117: 888-899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm vesicle orientation, NADH oxidation activity was measured in RSO membrane vesicles and compared with the same activity in inverted membrane vesicles. NADH (final concentration 0.25 mm) oxidation activity was monitored continuously at 340 nm. Functional Assays—ATP hydrolysis activity was measured using a spectrophotometric ATP-regenerating assay at 45 °C. The assay mixture contained 100 mm Bis-Tris propane (various pH values), 2 mm MgCl2, 3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.25 mm NADH, 0.57 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 3.2 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and 2.5 mm ATP. The reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme into 1 ml of assay mixture, and the rate of NADH oxidation was monitored continuously at 340 nm using a Cary 50 (Varian) spectrophotometer. Approximately 21 μg of recombinant TA2F1Fo was used for measurements. The activity that hydrolyzed 1 μmol of ATP per min is defined as 1 unit. ATP synthesis in inverted membrane vesicles was carried out by the method of Tomashek et al. (45Tomashek J.J. Glagoleva O.B. Brusilow W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4465-4470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) at 37 °C in 1 ml of 10 mm MOPS/Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 2 mm MgCl2 with stirring. Approximately 0.5 mg of membrane vesicles were incubated with stirring at 37 °C for 2 min, followed by incubation in the presence of 2.5 mm NADH for 2 min. When performing inhibition experiments, 100 μm DCCD was added 1 min prior to the addition of NADH. ATP synthesis was initiated with the concurrent addition of 0.75 mm ADP and 2.5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8.0). At various time intervals, 100-μl aliquots were removed and transferred to 400 μl of stop solution (1% trichloroacetic acid, 2 mm EDTA). Each sample was diluted 500-fold in water prior to the measurement of ATP (see below). ATP synthesis in ADP (5 mm) plus Pi (50 mm)-loaded RSO membrane vesicles was based on the protocol of Tsuchiya (46Tsuchiya T. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5315-5320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane vesicles were diluted 20-fold to a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml into prewarmed (35 °C) 25 mm Bis-Tris propane buffer (various pH values) containing 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, and 200 mm K2SO4. When performing inhibition experiments, membranes were incubated with 100 μm DCCD for 2 min prior to dilution. The reaction was initiated within 10 s of dilution by energizing the system with 20 mm potassium ascorbate and 0.1 mm phenazine methosulfate (ascorbate-PMS) with aerated vesicles. Aliquots were removed at various time points, transferred to precooled stop solution (30% perchloric acid, 9 mm Na2EDTA), and incubated on ice for 20 min. Denatured protein was removed by centrifugation (13,000 × g for 5 min), and the supernatant neutralized by the addition of 1 m NaOH plus 0.5 m NaCO3, followed by snap freezing. Salt was removed from the frozen supernatant by rapid thawing and centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 × g. To ensure residual perchloric acid did not inhibit subsequent ATP measurements, each sample was diluted 50-fold in water. Using the diluted samples from inverted and RSO membrane vesicle preparations, the amount of ATP was determined by the luciferin-luciferase assay as de"
https://openalex.org/W2000588392,"We describe the existence of a potassium ion transport mechanism in the mitochondrial inner membrane of a lower eukaryotic organism, Acanthamoeba castellanii. We found that substances known to modulate potassium channel activity influenced the bioenergetics of A. castellanii mitochondria. In isolated mitochondria, the rate of resting respiration is increased by about 10% in response to potassium channel openers, i.e. diazoxide and BMS-191095, during succinate-, malate-, or NADH-sustained respiration. This effect is strictly dependent on the presence of potassium ions in an incubation medium and is reversed by glibenclamide (a potassium channel blocker). Diazoxide and BMS-191095 also caused a slight but statistically significant depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential (measured with a TPP+-specific electrode), regardless of the respiratory substrate used. The resulting steady state value of membrane potential was restored after treatment with glibenclamide or 1 mm ATP. Additionally, the electrophysiological properties of potassium channels present in the A. castellanii inner mitochondrial membrane are described in the reconstituted system, using black lipid membranes. Conductance from 90 ± 7to166 ± 10 picosiemens, inhibition by 1 mm ATP/Mg2+ or glibenclamide, and activation by diazoxide were observed. These results suggest that an ATP-sensitive potassium channel similar to that of mammalian mitochondria is present in A. castellanii mitochondria.

These results suggest that an ATP-sensitive potassium channel similar to that of mammalian mitochondria is present in A. castellanii mitochondria. The mitochondrial inner membrane was originally thought to have a low permeability to ions. This was based on the assumption that ion flux would lead to energy dissipation and depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ). However, there is now clear evidence that anion, monovalent, and divalent cation channels exist in the inner membrane of mitochondria (1Bernardi P. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1127-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar, 2O'Rourke B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2007; 69: 23.1-23.31Google Scholar). These channels have profound effects on mitochondrial metabolism and the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, it is now known that the opening of these channels can have either detrimental (leading to apoptosis or necrosis) or beneficial effects on the cell (protection against ischemic damage, apoptosis, oxidative stress (for review see Refs. 3Tsujimoto Y.

Schindler P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8796-8799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The molecular identity of the mitoKATP channel is unknown. Several observations on the pharmacological profile and immunoreactivity with specific antibodies suggest that the mitoKATP channel belongs to the inward rectifier K+ channel family Kir6.x (17Suzuki M. Kotake K. Fujikura K. Inagaki N. Suzuki T. Gonoi T. Seino S. Takata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 693-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 18Zhou M. Tanaka O. Sekiguchi M. Sakabe K. Anzai M. Izumida I. Inoue T. Kawahara K. Abe H. Brain Res. 1999; 74: 15-25Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been hypothesized that succinate dehydrogenase forms part of a structure that constitutes the mitoKATP channel (19Ardehali H. Chen Z. Ko Y. Mejia-Alvarez R. Marban E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11880-11885Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar).The primary function of the mitoKATP channel is to allow K+ transport into the mitochondrial matrix. This can lead to an increase in matrix volume and matrix alkalinization as well as an increase in reactive oxygen species production by mitochondria (for review see Ref. 20Garlid K.D. Paucek P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1606: 23-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Additionally, in mammalian cells, it is now well established that mitoKATP channels play an important role in protecting cells against ischemia-reperfusion-induced injury. It has been found that an increase in the inner mitochondrial membrane permeability to K+ ions improves cellular tolerance to ischemia-reperfusion injury in various tissues, including liver, gut, brain, kidney, and heart (for review see Ref. 2O'Rourke B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2007; 69: 23.1-23.31Google Scholar).Although we now have quite a breadth of knowledge about ion transport in mammalian mitochondria, thus far nothing has been elucidated about cation-transporting systems in the mitochondria of unicellular eukaryotes. Acanthamoeba castellanii, a non-photosynthesizing amoeboid protozoon, is an especially interesting example of eukaryotic microorganisms, as in molecular phylogenesis appears on a branch basal to the divergence points of the animal, plant, and fungal kingdoms (21Grey M.W. Burger G. Lang B.F. Science. 1999; 283: 1476-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). A. castellanii and higher plants share several common features at the level of the respiratory chain of the inner mitochondrial membrane, such as the presence of an alternative cyanide-resistant ubiquinol oxidase and nonphosphorylating rotenoneinsensitive internal (matrix face) and external (cytosolic face) NADH dehydrogenases (22Jarmuszkiewicz W. Wagner A.M. Wagner M.J. Hryniewiecka L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 11: 110-114Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 23Jarmuszkiewicz W. Sluse-Goffart C.M. Hryniewiecka L. Michejda J. Sluse F.E. J. Biol.

On the contrary, recent studies on the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex of A. castellanii mitochondria suggest that it could be rather similar to the animal-fungal TOM proteins (25Wojtkowska M. Szczech N. Stobienia O. Jarmuszkiewicz W. Budzinska M. Kmita H. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2005; 37: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As mitochondrial potassium channels are present in higher plant mitochondria and animal mitochondria, it is of special interest to explore its existence in ameboid protozoon. Identification and characterization of the mitoKATP channel in A. castellanii mitochondria, the subject of the present study, indicate that the K+ transporting system emerged early during phylogenesis, prior to the divergence of eukaryotes into animals and plants.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—l-α-Phosphatidylcholine (asolectin), diazoxide, glibenclamide, and n-decane were from Sigma-Aldrich. All other chemicals were of the highest purity available commercially.Cell Culture and Isolation of Mitochondria—The soil amoeba A. castellanii, strain Neff, was cultured as described by Jarmuszkiewicz et al. (22Jarmuszkiewicz W. Wagner A.M. Wagner M.J. Hryniewiecka L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 11: 110-114Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Trophozoites of the amoeba were collected between 44 and 48 h following inoculation at the middle exponential phase (at a density of about 4–6 × 106 cells/ml). Mitochondria were isolated and purified on a self-generating Percoll gradient (30%) as described earlier (21Grey M.W. Burger G. Lang B.F. Science. 1999; 283: 1476-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial protein concentration was determined by the biuret method.Preparation of Submitochondrial Particles—Freshly prepared mitochondria were diluted to about 8 mg of protein/ml with 0.25 m sucrose and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and subsequently frozen at –20 °C. After thawing, the suspension was sonicated five times for 30 s and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min to pellet the unbroken mitochondria. The supernatant was centrifuged at 34,000 × g (30 min) to pellet submitochondrial particles (SMP), fraction 1 (smaller particles). The supernatant was again centrifuged at 200,000 × g (2 h) to collect fraction 2 of SMP (larger particles). Fractions of SMP, which are the mitochondrial inner membrane-enriched fractions, were resuspended in 0.3 m sucrose and 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.2, at a concentration of 5 mg of protein/ml.Black Lipid Membrane (BLM) Measurements—Experiments were performed by using the black lipid membrane technique as described previously (26Bednarczyk P. Kicinska A. Kominkova V. Ondrias K. Dolowy K. Szewczyk A. J. Membr. Biol. 2004; 199: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 27Hordejuk R. Lobanov N.A. Kicinska A. Szewczyk A. Dolowy K. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2004; 21: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In brief, BLMs were formed in a 250-μm-diameter hole drilled in a Delrin cup (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT), which separated two chambers (cis and trans, each 1 ml internal volume). The chambers contained 50/450 mm KCl (cis/trans) and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. The outline of the aperture was coated with a lipid solution and N2 dried prior to bilayer formation to improve membrane stability. BLMs were painted using asolectin in n-decane at a final concentration of 25 mg of lipid/ml. Amoeba A. castellanii SMP (about 5 μg of protein/ml, 0.5–1.5 μl/reconstitution) were added to the trans compartment (Fig. 4C). Incorporation of the potassium channel into the BLM was usually observed within a few minutes. The studied compounds were added to the cis and trans compartments. All measurements were carried out at 24 °C. The formation and thinning of the bilayer were monitored by capacitance measurements and optical observations. Final accepted capacitance values ranged from 110 to 180 picofarads. Electrical connections were made by Ag/AgCl electrodes and agar salt bridges (3 m KCl) to minimize liquid junction potentials. Voltage was applied to the cis compartment of the chamber, and the trans compartment was grounded (Fig. 4C). The current was measured using a bilayer membrane amplifier (BLM-120, BioLogic). Signals were filtered at 500 Hz. The current was digitized at a sampling rate of 100 kHz (A/D converter PowerLab 2/20, ADInstruments) and transferred to a PC for off-line analysis by Chart version 5.2 (PowerLab, ADInstruments) and pCLAMP 8.1 (Axon Laboratory). The pCLAMP 8.1 software package was used for data processing. The channel recordings presented are representative of the most frequently observed conductance values under the given conditions. The conductance was calculated from the currentvoltage relationship. The permeability ratios for K+ and Cl– were calculated according to the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz voltage equation (28Hille B.

Benzohydroxymate was used to inhibit the alternative oxidase activity. Succinate (5 mm) plus rotenone (4 μm), malate (5 mm), or NADH (1 mm) was used as the respiratory substrate. Measurements of the respiratory rate were performed in the absence of added ADP, i.e. in the resting state (state 4). To exclude the activity of an ATP/ADP antiporter, 1.8 μm carboxyatractylozide (CATR) was used. State 3 (phosphorylating) respiration measurements were performed (in the high KCl medium with 0.65 MgCl2 (23Jarmuszkiewicz W. Sluse-Goffart C.M. Hryniewiecka L. Michejda J. Sluse F.E. J. Biol.

Only high quality mitochondria preparations, i.e. with an ADP/O value of around 1.40 and a respiratory control ratio of around 3 (with succinate), were used in all experiments. Values of O2 uptake are presented in nmol of oxygen × min–1 × mg–1 protein.FIGURE 1Influence of potassium channel activity modulating substances (diazoxide, glibenclamide, BMS-191095, and 5-HD) on resting (state 4) respiratory rate and membrane potential (ΔΨ) in isolated A. castellanii mitochondria.

(29Kamo N. Muratsugu M. Hongoh R. Kobatake Y. J. Membr. Biol. 1979; 49: 105-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Measurements were performed in the presence of 1.3 μm TPP+. For calculation of the ΔΨ value, the matrix volume of amoeba mitochondria was assumed to be 2.0 μl × mg–1 protein. Calculation assumes that TPP+ distribution between mitochondria and medium followed the Nernst equation. Corrections were made for the binding of TPP+ to mitochondrial membranes. Values of ΔΨ are presented in mV.SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Protein content was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Samples (150 μg) of isolated mitochondrial proteins or SMP were solubilized in sample buffer containing 2% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 0.004% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 8% mercaptoethanol) and subsequently were boiled for 4 min. Proteins were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and, after separation, electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were then hybridized with anti-Kir6.1 and anti-Kir6.2 antibodies (at dilutions of 1:100) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in the presence or absence of blocking peptide. Protein bands were visualized using the GE Healthcare ECL system.RESULTSActivation of K+ Flux through the A. castellanii Mitochondrial Membrane by Potassium Channel Openers—The addition of a mitochondrial potassium channel opener, 100 μm diazoxide, increases the rate of mitochondrial state 4 oxygen uptake (with succinate) by 10.0 ± 1.6% (n = 9, S.D.). This effect is reversed to the control value by a potassium channel blocker, 10 μm glibenclamide. At the same time, ΔΨ decreases after addition of diazoxide by 1.2 ± 0.4 mV (n = 9, S.D.) and afterward is restored to the resting state value by glibenclamide. An example of simultaneously performed measurements of the resting respiratory rate and ΔΨ under the conditions described is shown in Fig. 1A. These results suggest that diazoxide stimulates the K+ ion flux into A. castellanii mitochondria, decreasing the steady state ΔΨ and thus causing the acceleration of mitochondrial respiration rate. To further test this hypothesis, we performed the same experiments in media deprived of K+ ions. In a sucrose (0.25 m) medium (data not shown) and in NaCl (0.12 m) medium (Fig. 2, A and B) the addition of either diazoxide or glibenclamide did not change the control values of resting respiration and ΔΨ in A. castellanii mitochondria. Another potassium channel opener, described previously as specific for the mitoKATP channel (30Grover G.J. D'Alonzo A.J. Garlid K.D. Bajgar R. Lodge N.J. Sleph P.G. Darbenzio R.B. Hess T.A. Smith M.A. Paucek P. Atwal K.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 297: 1184-1192PubMed Google Scholar), BMS-191095, also was applied in our studies. Similar to diazoxide, 3 μm BMS-191095 stimulated mitochondrial resting oxygen uptake by 8.9 ± 2.5% (n = 4, S.D.) and decreased ΔΨ by 1.2 ± 0.1 mV (n = 4, S.D.). Both effects were reversed by the addition of 10 μm glibenclamide. A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 1B.Fig. 1C shows that another previously described potassium channel blocker, 5-hydroxydecanoic acid (5-HD) (16Garlid K.D. Paucek P. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Sun X. Schindler P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8796-8799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), is not active when used with amoeba mitochondria. The addition of 500 μm 5-HD did not change the mitochondrial respiration rate and ΔΨ accelerated by diazoxide (Fig. 1C).Fig. 2, A and B, shows the diazoxide concentration-dependent effects on resting respiratory rate (stimulation) and ΔΨ (depolarization) with succinate-oxidizing A. castellanii mitochondria in the KCl-based medium. The apparent 50% maximal effect of diazoxide (K0.5) is reached at 43–45 μm. Concentrations of diazoxide higher than 100 μm were described to have nonspecific effects on mitochondria (31Kowaltowski A.J. Seetharaman S. Paucek P. Garlid K.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H649-H657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and therefore have not been used in this study. Moreover, it is clear from Fig. 2, A and B, that the effects of diazoxide action are strictly dependent on the K+ ion presence in the incubation medium (no effects in a NaCl-based medium) and reversed by 10 μm glibenclamide. Furthermore, the dose-dependent and glibenclamide-blocked influence of diazoxide on mitochondrial bioenergetics is also observed during malate-sustained respiration (Fig. 2, C and D). In the case of malate, mitochondrial respiration is stimulated up to about 11%, whereas ΔΨ is maximally decreased by 1.5 mV. The apparent value of K0.5 is observed at 52–53 μm diazoxide.The inhibitory effect of ATP on K+ transport into A. castellanii mitochondria has been studied with external NADH as a respiratory substrate in order to exclude the influence of the nucleotide on malate and succinate dehydrogenase activities (23Jarmuszkiewicz W. Sluse-Goffart C.M. Hryniewiecka L. Michejda J. Sluse F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10174-10180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). With mitochondria oxidizing external NADH, 100 μm diazoxide stimulates respiration by 15.7 ± 2.5% (n = 9, S.D.) and decreases ΔΨ by 1.30 ± 0.45 mV (n = 9, S.D.). The apparent value of K0.5 is estimated at around 50 μm diazoxide (Fig. 3C). The effect of diazoxide is abolished by the addition of 1 mm ATP (Fig. 3, A and C). Moreover, diazoxide was not able to activate potassium transport (no effect on either respiratory rate or ΔΨ was observed) when added after ATP (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that the nucleotide is an inhibitor of potassium transport in A. castellanii mitochondria. Moreover, in the K+ ion-deprived medium (0.25 m sucrose), the inhibitory effect of ATP was not observed (data not shown). The presence of 1.8 μm CATR in experiments where ATP was applied is especially important to exclude the adenine nucleotide translocator action and thereby ATP uptake into mitochondrial matrix. The same results were also observed in the presence of oligomycin (1 μg/mg of protein), a F1F0-ATP synthase inhibitor.The above functional characterization, drawn from experiments performed with isolated mitochondria, suggests that the potassium transport mechanism, similar to that observed in mitochondria of higher eukaryotes (plants and mammals), is present in A. castellanii mitochondria. To support these results, a further characterization of potassium transport with the inner mitochondrial membrane-enriched fractions (SMPs) reconstituted in a planar lipid bilayer was performed.Characterization of Potassium Channel from A. castellanii Mitochondrial Membrane in BLMs—The particular inner mitochondrial membrane-enriched fractions (SMP fractions 1 and 2) from the amoeba A. castellanii were reconstituted into BLMs as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results obtained upon reconstitution indicate no functional distinction between both fractions of particles. A variety of channel-like activities has been observed, both anion- and cation-selective (n = 117). Among them, we have focused on the K+ ion transport. Fig. 4A shows representative current-time traces and current-voltage relationship for potassium channel opening at different voltages in the 50/450 mm KCl (cis/trans) gradient solutions. The calculated channel conductance is equal to 166 ± 10 pS for potential from –30 to +30 mV and 90 ± 7 pS for potential from 50 to 110 mV. The reversal potential of 47 mV (Fig. 4B) has been calculated from measurements in the 50/450 mm KCl gradient solutions and curve fitting to the experimental data. This value indicates that the examined ion channel is a cation-selective. The calculated permeability ratio for K+ and Cl– is equal to 20.4 according the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz voltage equation (28Hille B. Selective Permeability: Independence. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA2001: 441-470Google Scholar) (see Equation 1 under “Experimental Procedures”).Substances known to modulate the mitoKATP channel activity have been used to examine the properties of the K+ ion channel observed in our experiments. Fig. 5A shows the single channel recordings in the 50/450 mm KCl (cis/trans) gradient solutions at 0 mV, before and after the addition of 1 mm ATP/Mg2+ to both chambers (cis/trans). ATP/Mg2+ causes a complete inhibition of the channel. The effect has usually been observed after about 5 min following ATP/Mg2+ addition. The result is clearly depicted in histograms shown below the current-time trace (Fig. 5A). The number of observations of the channel being in an open state changes from 61% to zero. The next recording (Fig. 5B) presents the inhibitory effect of 50 μm glibenclamide after its addition to the cis and trans compartments. Again, we observe the complete transition of the channel protein into a closed state, a few seconds after the inhibitor addition. The number of open state events changes from 50% to zero after glibenclamide addition, as illustrated in the histogram (Fig. 5B). The last trace on Fig. 5C shows that the inhibitory effect of ATP/Mg2+ is reversed by the addition of 30 μm diazoxide (cis/trans) in the presence of ATP/Mg2+ (cis/trans). The effect of diazoxide was usually evident within a few seconds after its application. Diazoxide causes the transition into an open state in 67% of events (histogram below the trace, Fig. 5C).FIGURE 5Influence of ATP/Mg2+, glibenclamide, and diazoxide on the activity of potassium channel from A. castellanii mitochondria.

The determination of the NTP specificity of the model thymidylyltransferase RmlA revealed RmlA to utilize all eight naturally occurring NTPs with varying levels of catalytic efficiency, even in the presence of nonnative sugar-1-phosphates. Guided by structural models, active site engineering of RmlA led to alterations of the inherent pyrimidine/purine bias by up to three orders of magnitude.

These proteins represent a new family of glycosyltransferases, found exclusively within the fungal kingdom. The basidomycetous fungus Cryptococcus neoformans causes a variety of maladies, including an often fatal meningoencephalitis (1Chayakulkeeree M. Perfect J.R. Infect. Dis. Clin. North Am. 2006; 20 (v-vi): 507-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Currently available chemotherapeutic agents are unable to completely clear the infection, necessitating long term treatment in those patients that survive (1Chayakulkeeree M. Perfect J.R. Infect. Dis. Clin. North Am. 2006; 20 (v-vi): 507-544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The main virulence factor of this opportunistic pathogen is the large polysaccharide capsule that envelops the cell. Strains of C. neoformans that lack this capsule are avirulent in animal models (2Kwon-Chung K.J. Rhodes J.C. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 218-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the synthesis of this structure could be targeted therapeutically (3Bose I. Reese A.J. Ory J.J. Janbon G. Doering T.L. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 655-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Two xylose-containing polysaccharides, termed glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) 2The abbreviations used are: GXM, glucuronoxylomannan; GalXM, galactoxylomannan; XT, xylosyltransferase; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; PMAA, partially methylated alditol acetate; MS, mass spectrometry; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. and galactoxylomannan (GalXM), make up ∼97% of the mass of the capsule, with the remaining mass contributed by mannoproteins (3Bose I. Reese A.J. Ory J.J. Janbon G. Doering T.L. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 655-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The biochemical structures of both GXM and GalXM have been determined. GXM, with a molecular mass of 1-7 megadaltons (4McFadden D.C. De Jesus M. Casadevall A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1868-1875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), is composed of a backbone of α-1,3-linked mannan substituted with glucuronic acid and xylose residues (5Cherniak R. Valafar H. Morris L.C. Valafar F. Clin. Diagn. Lab. Immunol. 1998; 5: 146-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). GalXM is a smaller polymer (100 kDa), consisting of an α-1,6-galactan backbone with galactomannan side chains that are decorated with xylose residues (6Vaishnav V.V. Bacon B.E. O'Neill M. Cherniak R. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 306: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Repeating unit of GalXM from C. neoformans. Open circles, galactose; filled circles, mannose; stars, xylose.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) There are four serotypes of C. neoformans (A-D) (7Wilson D.E. Bennett J.E. Bailey J.W. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1968; 127: 820-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) that differ with respect to virulence and the amount of xylose present within GXM (Fig. 1, panels A-D). Serotype D GXM has the simplest xylosylation pattern, with only one β-1,2-linked xylose residue (Fig. 1, panel D), and is also the least virulent of the serotypes. Serotype A GXM has two β-1,2-linked residues (Fig. 1, panel A), and this serotype is more virulent than serotype D strains (8Barchiesi F. Cogliati M. Esposto M.C. Spreghini E. Schimizzi A.M. Wickes B.L. Scalise G. Viviani M.A. J. Infect. 2005; 51: 10-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The GXM of serotypes B and C, which can cause disease in immunocompetent patients, contains additional β-1,4-linked xylose residues (Fig. 1, panels B and C). The structure of GalXM has only been studied in serotype D strains (6Vaishnav V.V. Bacon B.E. O'Neill M. Cherniak R. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 306: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). GXM mediates a variety of detrimental effects on the host immune response that allow for the in vivo survival of C. neoformans (9Vecchiarelli A. Curr. Mol. Med. 2005; 5: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition to the correlation between increased GXM xylosylation and virulence among the four serotypes described above, there is further evidence that capsular xylose participates in these immunological effects. A mutant strain of C. neoformans lacking UDP-xylose, the activated donor for xylose transfer, has a general defect in xylosylation (10Bar-Peled M. Griffith C.L. Doering T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Three phenotypic variants of one C. neoformans strain differ with respect to virulence and the arrangement of xylose moieties within GXM (15Fries B.C. Goldman D.L. Cherniak R. Ju R. Casadevall A.

Cell. 2004; 3: 1513-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) identified a number of genes that appear to be involved in capsule synthesis. Disruption of any one of the four CAP genes (CAP10, CAP59, CAP60, and CAP64) yields an acapsular phenotype, suggesting that these each play a central role in capsule synthesis (16Chang Y.C. Kwon-Chung K.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4912-4919Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 17Chang Y.C. Kwon-Chung K.J. Infect.

Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1977-1983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Five homologs of CAP10 (CAP1-5) have also been identified, but the biochemical functions of the CAP genes and these homologs have remained undefined (22Okabayashi K. Hasegawa A. Watanabe T. Mycopathologia. 2007; 163: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Glycosyltransferases catalyze the specific transfer of a monosaccharide from an activated donor, such as a nucleotide disphosphosugar, to an acceptor. These enzymes are typically 30-50-kilodalton type II membrane proteins (23Klutts J.S. Yoneda A. Reilly M.C. Bose I. Doering T.L. FEMS Yeast Res. 2006; 6: 499-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Glycosyltransferases have been organized into families based on sequence similarity (24Coutinho P.M. Deleury E. Davies G.J. Henrissat B. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar) and can be broadly divided into two superfamiles (GT-A and GT-B) based on structural patterns. Most members of the GT-A group contain a DXD motif that is involved in the binding of a divalent cation cofactor important for catalytic activity (25Busch C. Hofmann F. Selzer J. Munro S. Jeckel D.

Although a few GT-A enzymes lack the DXD motif and cation requirement, this is more typical of the GT-B glycosyltransferases. The synthesis of large glycans such as GXM or GalXM generally requires the sequential action of several glycosyltransferases. Thus, it is likely that a number of these enzymes, including up to seven xylosyltransferases, are actively involved in capsule synthesis. It is also reasonable to suggest that some of the previously identified capsule synthesis associated genes may encode glycosyltransferases, especially as one of them, CAP59, encodes a homolog to a known mannosyltransferase (32Sommer U. Liu H. Doering T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47724-47730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, no glycosyltransferase with a defined role in capsule synthesis has been identified. Capsule synthesis offers a potential target for antifungal chemotherapy. To understand this process, we must identify the glycosyltransferases involved in GXM and GalXM production. Because of the importance of xylose residues within these structures, we have focused on identifying xylosyltransferases (XTs) involved in capsule biosynthesis. As no homologs to known mammalian or plant XTs exist within the C. neoformans data base, we took a biochemical approach to this question. Here we describe the discovery, purification, characterization, and expression of Cxt1p, a β-1,2-XT from C. neoformans with activity appropriate for the synthesis of either GXM or GalXM. Cxt1p is a large, apparently cation-independent glycosyltransferase that defines a new family of glycosyltransferases. This family includes C. neoformans Cap10p and its homologs and is exclusive to fungi. Materials—Unless otherwise noted, all chemicals were from Sigma. Strains and Cell Growth—C. neoformans wild-type strain JEC21 (serotype D MATα) was provided by Joseph Heitman (Duke University). C. neoformans ags1Δ strain was generated in our laboratory (serotype D MATα ags1Δ) (33Reese A.J. Yoneda A. Breger J.A. Beauvais A. Liu H. Griffith C.L. Bose I. Kim M.J. Skau C. Yang S. Sefko J.A.

For activity analysis, 50 ml of minimal medium minus uracil (URA-) (34Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Albright L.M. Coen D.M. Varki A. Chanda V.B.

For purification, such a culture of ags1Δ was then inoculated into 3 liters of the same medium and grown at 30 °C with continuous shaking for 3-4 days until the A600 was between 4 and 5. TDY172 was grown at 30 °C with continuous shaking in 50 ml of minimal broth media supplemented with uracil to an A600 of 1-2. Xylosyltransferase (XT) Enzyme Assays—Activity was assayed by monitoring the transfer of [14C]xylose from UDP-[U-14C]xylose (264.4 mCi/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to α-1,3-mannobiose (α-1,3-Man2; Carbohydrate Synthesis, Oxford, UK). Standard assay mixtures (50 μl) included 15 μl of protein sample, 8.5 mm α-1,3-Man2 (0.43 μmol), 57 nmol of UDP-[U-14C]xylose (15 nCi), and 100 mm Tris, pH 6.5. The reaction was incubated for 4 h at 20 °C and terminated by applying the assay mixture to a small disposable column containing 0.6 ml of AG2X-50 resin (Bio-Rad), followed by 30 μl of deionized water to ensure the sample was fully loaded into the resin. 600 μl of deionized water was then applied to the column, and the eluate collected and spun at 13,000 × g for 5 min to remove particulate materials, and the supernatant fraction removed to another tube. 14C-Labeled trisaccharide product was detected either by scintillation counting or TLC. For the latter, all or part of the supernatant was dried under N2 at 50 °C, resuspended in 15 μl of 40% n-propyl alcohol, and applied to a dried (70 °C for 30 min) 20 × 20-cm Silica Gel-60 TLC plate (EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ). The plate was developed in 5:4:2 n-propyl alcohol:acetone:water for 2 h, dried, and then developed for an additional 2 h in the same solvent. After drying, the standards were visualized by spraying with 0.2% orcinol in 75:15:10 ethanol:sulfuric acid:water and incubating for 5-10 min at 70 °C. The sample lanes were sprayed with Enhance surface autoradiography spray (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and allowed to dry, and the radioactive products were visualized by autoradiography. Production and Purification of Trisaccharide Product for Analysis—To generate product for structural analysis, XT reactions were scaled up. Ten 70-μl reactions (20 μl of partially purified enzyme (post Sephacryl S-300, see below), 12.5 mm α-1,3-Man2 (0.88 μmol), 12.8 mm UDP-xylose (0.9 μmol) (Carbosource Services, Athens, GA), 57 nmol of UDP-[U-14C]xylose (0.015 μCi), and 147 mm Tris, pH 6.5) were incubated at 20 °C for 30 h and applied to AG2X-50 columns as above. Each column was eluted with 700 μl of deionized water, and the eluates were pooled, lyophilized, resuspended in 100 μl of 40% n-propyl alcohol, streaked onto two Silica Gel 60 TLC plates, and developed as above. The radioactive trisaccharide was localized using a TLC plate scanner (System 200A imaging scanner; Bioscan Inc., Washington, D.C.), and the corresponding area of silica was recovered. The product was eluted from the silica powder by vortexing for 1 min with 5 ml of water and allowing the mixture to remain for 1 h at room temperature. The silica was sedimented (10,000 × g, 10 min, room temperature), and the supernatant was lyophilized and resuspended in 1 ml of water. The product was then purified by solid phase extraction using a protocol adapted from Ref. 35Packer N.H. Lawson M.A. Jardine D.R. Redmond J.W. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar. Briefly, the suspension was applied to a 0.25 g (1 ml) Envi-Carb solid phase extraction column (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) that had been preconditioned with 3 ml of 80% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid followed by 2 ml of water. The loaded column was washed with 3 ml of water, and the product was eluted with 3 ml of 25% acetonitrile in water (v/v). The acetonitrile in the eluate was removed by evaporation under N2 at 50 °C, and the remainder of the sample was lyophilized. α-Mannosidase Treatment of the XT Product—XT product was partially purified by TLC as described above. The product was then incubated with jack bean α-mannosidase (Oxford Glycosystems, Oxford, UK) for 18 h at 37 °C in buffer supplied by the manufacturer. One-dimensional 1H and Two-dimensional 1H-1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy—Samples of the XT product and the α-1,3-Man2 substrate (∼0.3-1.0 mg) were deuterium-exchanged by repeated lyophilization from D2O and then dissolved in 0.5 ml of D2O for NMR analysis. One-dimensional 1H NMR, two-dimensional 1H-1H-gCOSY, two-dimensional 1H-1H-TOCSY, and one-dimensional 1H-1H nuclear Overhauser effect spectra were acquired at 25 °C on a Varian Unity Inova 500-MHz spectrometer (Department of Chemistry, University of New Hampshire), using standard acquisition software available in the Varian VNMR software package. Proton chemical shifts are referenced to internal acetone (δ = 2.225 ppm). Permethylation and Linkage Analysis—A portion of the XT product was permethylated using the method of Ciucanu and Kerek (36Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3215) Google Scholar) with the modification of Ciucanu and Costello (37Ciucanu I. Costello C.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 16213-16219Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). An aliquot of the permethylated product was further treated (by hydrolysis, reduction, and per-O-acetylation) for analysis of partially methylated alditol acetates (PMAAs), using the protocols described by Levery and Hakomori (38Levery S.B. Hakomori S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The PMAAs were analyzed on an Rtx-5MS-bonded phase-fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm; 0.25 μm phase thickness; Restek Corp., Bellefonte, PA) in the splitless mode using a Trace GC ultra gas chromatograph interfaced to a Polaris Q ion trap mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT, San Jose, CA), with MS operated in electron ionization mode, and gas chromatography programmed as described previously (38Levery S.B. Hakomori S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The derivatives were identified by retention times and characteristic electron impact mass spectra compared with standards (39Hellerqvist C.G.

Positive Ion Mode Electrospray-Ionization Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectrometry was performed in the positive ion mode on a linear ion trap (LTQ, ThermoFinnigan San Jose, CA), with sample introduction via direct infusion in 50% MeOH-H2O (for the native XT product) or 100% MeOH (for the permethylated XT product), and a sample concentration of ∼100 ng/μl. Xylosyltransferase Purification—All steps were carried out on ice or at 4 °C, unless otherwise indicated. Q-Sepharose, DEAE, and Sephacryl S-300 chromatography were carried out on an ÄKTAFPLC (GE Healthcare). Protein was measured with the Bio-Rad DC protein reagent (Bio-Rad) using IgG as the standard.

The cells were resuspended in 30 ml of Buffer A (total volume ≈ 75 ml), divided into three 50-ml conical tubes, and mixed with 12 ml of 0.5-mm glass beads. Cells were broken by vortex mixing six times for 2 min, with 2 min on ice between each mixing, and cell lysates were transferred to fresh 50-ml conical tubes. The beads were washed with 15 ml of Buffer A, and this wash was pooled with the lysate. To sediment broken cells and debris, each pool was centrifuged (1,200 × g, 20 min), and membranes were recovered from the supernatant fraction by ultracentrifugation (60,000 × g, 45 min). The supernatants were discarded, and each membrane pellet was suspended in 50 ml of Buffer A, resedimented (60,000 × g, 30 min), and resuspended in 2 ml of Buffer A. For smaller scale membrane preparations, glass bead lysis was performed, either in a Mini-Bead Beater 8 (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK) or by vortex mixing as in Ref. 42Doering T.L. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5482-5488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Solubilization—Pooled crude membranes were mixed with 20% Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1% and incubated on ice for 30 min, with brief vortex mixing every 5 min. This solution was cleared by centrifugation (60,000 × g, 30 min), and the supernatant fraction (SolZ) was recovered. Q-Sepharose Chromatography—The SolZ fraction (2-3 ml) was filtered using 0.45-μm spin filters and promptly applied to a 20-ml HiPrep 16/10 Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare) that had been pre-equilibrated with Buffer B. The column was then washed with 200 ml of Buffer B, and activity was eluted with a 200-ml gradient from Buffer B to Buffer C. 4-ml fractions were assayed as above, and the activity peak was pooled and concentrated to ∼500 μl (SolQ) using a 15-ml Amicon Ultra 10-kDa molecular mass cutoff spin concentrator. Sephacryl S-300 Gel Filtration Chromatography—The Sol Q fraction was filtered and applied to a 316-ml HiPrep 26/60 Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) that was pre-equilibrated with Buffer D. The column was eluted with a 253-ml (0.8 column volume) isocratic gradient of Buffer D, with the first 95 ml going to waste (void volume). The remaining 158 ml were collected into 4-ml fractions and assayed, and the activity peak was concentrated to 1 ml (SolS). Concanavalin A Chromatography—The SolS fraction was diluted to 10 ml with Buffer E, reconcentrated to 1 ml, and diluted back to 2.5 ml with Buffer E. This was then applied to a 2.5-ml column of concanavalin A-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) that had been pre-equilibrated with Buffer E. The column was capped and allowed to rock at 4 °C overnight. The flow-through was then collected and the column washed with 60 ml of Buffer E. 50 ml of Buffer F was then added to the column. After 10 ml of Buffer F had passed through and been collected, the column was capped and allowed to rock for 30 min at 4 °C. The remainder of the Buffer F was then allowed to elute, pooled with the first 10 ml, and concentrated to 1 ml (SolC). DEAE Chromatography—To desalt SolC, it was diluted to 10 ml with Buffer G, concentrated to 1 ml, rediluted to 10 ml, and concentrated to 0.8 ml. The final solution was filtered and applied to a 1-ml HiTrap DEAE-Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with 15 ml of Buffer H and eluted with a 20-ml gradient from Buffer H to Buffer I. 1-ml fractions were assayed, and the activity peak was concentrated to 1 ml (SolD). α-1,3-Man2 Affinity Chromatography—The SolD fraction was diluted to 15 ml with Buffer G and extensively desalted with three successive concentrations and dilutions, to a final volume of 1 ml. This was mixed with 1 ml of Buffer J and loaded onto a column containing 5 ml of a custom-synthesized α-1,3-Man2-agarose resin (Carbohydrate Synthesis, Oxford, UK) that had been pre-equilibrated with Buffer J. The column was capped, allowed to rock at 4 °C for 30 min and then at 25 °C for 90 min, and then washed with 30 ml of Buffer K at 25 °C. The column was then moved to 4 °C and eluted with a 44-ml gradient from Buffer K to Buffer L, collecting 0.85-ml fractions. The activity peak was combined into two pools that were each concentrated to 25 μl; one pool that consisted of the shoulders of the peak and the other the middle of the peak. Protein Analysis—The two pools from the α-1,3-Man2 column were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 12% gel, which was stained with SYPRO Ruby (Bio-Rad) as per the manufacturer's instructions and visualized on a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX. An ∼90-kDa band of interest was excised and submitted to the Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory at Washington University School of Medicine for trypsin digestion followed by HPLC separation and mass spectrometry analysis of the resulting fragments. The mass spectra were compared with the C. neoformans protein data base, and the protein sequence corresponding to the band of interest was then analyzed using the Prosite domain prediction server and the TMpred transmembrane domain prediction server. Expression in S. cerevisiae—CXT1 was amplified from JEC21 cDNA by PCR using primers Exp-sense and Exp-antisense (Table 2) to incorporate a His6 tag at the C terminus, as well as HindIII and BamHI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. The product was cloned into a TOPO pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced (Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Laboratory, Washington University School of Medicine). A Topo-CXT1 clone with the correct sequence was then digested with HindIII and BamHI, and the released fragment was cloned into a2-μm yeast expression vector between the promoter and terminator of phosphoglycerate kinase (plasmid pPGK (43Kang Y.S. Kane J. Kurjan J. Stadel J.M. Tipper D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2582-2590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); from K. Blumer, Washington University School of Medicine).

However, the molecular basis of its COX-2 inhibition has not been completely defined. Using standard assays, lumiracoxib was found to be a poor inhibitor of purified ovine COX-1 and a relatively weak inhibitor of purified human COX-2. The extent of COX-2 inhibition plateaued at around 50% and suggested that the inhibitor may be reversibly bound to the enzyme. Kinetic studies with lumiracoxib demonstrated that it was a time-dependent and slowly reversible inhibitor of human COX-2 that exhibited at least two binding steps during inhibition. Derivatives of lumiracoxib were synthesized with or without the methyl group on the phenylacetic acid ring and with various substitutions on the lower aniline ring. Inhibition studies demonstrated that the methyl group on the phenylacetic acid ring is required for COX-2 selectivity. The chemical identity and position of the substituents on the lower aniline ring were important in determining the potency and extent of COX inhibition as well as COX-2 selectivity. Mutation of Ser-530 to Ala or Val-349 to Ala or Leu abolished the potent inhibition observed with wild-type human COX-2 and key lumiracoxib analogs. Interestingly, a Val-349 to Ile mutant was inhibited with equal potency to human COX-2 with 2,6-dichloro-, 2,6-dimethyl-, or 2-chloro-6-methyl-substituted inhibitors and, in the case of lumiracoxib, actually showed an increase in potency. Taken together with a recent crystal structure of a lumiracoxib-COX-2 complex, the kinetic analyses presented herein of the inhibition of mutant COX-2s by lumiracoxib allows the definition of the molecular basis of COX-2 inhibition.

Lumiracoxib is a highly selective COX-2 inhibitor that is weakly acidic and displays a unique pharmacological profile that includes rapid absorbance and a relatively short plasma half-life (1.Lyseng-Williamson K.A. Curran M.P. Drugs. 2004; 64: 2237-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Lumiracoxib displays a 500-fold greater selectivity for COX-2 than COX-1 in vivo (2.Tannenbaum H. Drugs. 2004; 64: 2247-2248Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and in clinical studies has shown a 3–4-fold reduction in ulcer complications versus classical NSAIDs (3.Farkouh M.E. Kirshner H. Harrington R.A. Ruland S. Verheugt F.W. Schnitzer T.J. Burmester G.R. Mysler E. Hochberg M.C. Doherty M. Ehrsam E. Gitton X. Krammer G. Mellein B. Gimona A. Matchaba P. Hawkey C.J. Chesebro J.H.

Lumiracoxib lacks the tricyclic structure of the diarylheterocycle class of COX-2-selective inhibitors (e.g. celecoxib and rofecoxib) and does not contain a sulfonamide or sulfone group. Instead, lumiracoxib is a close structural analog of diclofenac (Fig. 1). Although lumiracoxib and diclofenac share structural similarities, they exhibit large differences in the selectivity of COX-2 inhibition. The molecular basis for this difference in the selectivity of COX inhibition is not entirely understood. Previous crystal structures of COX enzymes with carboxylic acid-containing NSAIDs reveal that the inhibitors are typically positioned with their carboxylates coordinated to Arg-120 and their aromatic functional groups projecting up into the cyclooxygenase active site (5.Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar, 6.Kurumbail R.G. Stevens A.M. Gierse J.K. McDonald J.J. Stegeman R.A. Pak J.Y. Gildehaus D. Miyashiro J.M. Penning T.D. Seibert K. Isakson P.C. Stallings W.C. Nature. 1996; 384: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). However, a crystal structure of diclofenac bound in the active site of COX-2 (Fig. 2B) revealed an inverted binding mode of the molecule with its carboxylic acid moiety coordinated to Ser-530 and Tyr-385 (7.Rowlinson S.W. Kiefer J.R. Prusakiewicz J.J. Pawlitz J.L. Kozak K.R. Kalgutkar A.S. Stallings W.C. Kurumbail R.G. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45763-45769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Structure-activity studies have found that another distinctive binding mode is exhibited by indomethacin, a nonselective NSAID that is a time-dependent, functionally irreversible inhibitor of COX enzymes (8.Prusakiewicz J.J. Felts A.S. Mackenzie B.S. Marnett L.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15439-15445Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Indomethacin binds in the cyclooxygenase active site with its carboxylic acid group ion-pairing and hydrogenboding with Arg-120 and Tyr-355 (Fig. 2A). In addition, its 2′-methyl group binds in a hydrophobic pocket composed of Ala-527, Val-349, Ser-530, and Leu-531 (6.Kurumbail R.G. Stevens A.M. Gierse J.K. McDonald J.J. Stegeman R.A. Pak J.Y. Gildehaus D. Miyashiro J.M. Penning T.D. Seibert K. Isakson P.C. Stallings W.C. Nature. 1996; 384: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). Mutations of Val-349 in this methyl-binding pocket to alanine or leucine alter the size of the pocket and lead to an increase or decrease in the potency of indomethacin, respectively. The 2′-des-methyl analog of indomethacin does not inhibit COX-1 and is a very weak, rapidly reversible inhibitor of COX-2 (8.Prusakiewicz J.J. Felts A.S. Mackenzie B.S. Marnett L.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15439-15445Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of murine COX-2 with lumiracoxib was solved and revealed that lumiracoxib binds in an inverted orientation similar to that of diclofenac (9.Clark K. Kulathila R. Koehn J. Rieffel S. Strauss A. Hu S. Kalfoglou M. Szeto D. Lasala D. Sabio M. Wang X. Marshall P. American Chemical Society: Book of Abstracts. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.2004: 22-26Google Scholar). The carboxylate of lumiracoxib forms hydrogen-bonding interactions with Ser-530 and Tyr-385 at the top of the active site. From this crystal structure, it was proposed that the COX-2 selectivity of lumiracoxib arises from the insertion of the methyl group on the phenylacetic acid ring into a small groove provided by the movement of Leu-384 in the COX-2 active site. The movement of this leucine residue is restricted in the COX-1 active site due to the presence of bulky secondary shell residues behind Leu-384 (Ile-525 and Phe-503) that prevent the movement of this residue with inhibitor bound. The corresponding secondary shell residues are Leu-525 in mCOX-2 and Val-525 in hCOX-2 and Leu-503 in both m/hCOX-2 enzymes. The crystal structure failed to elucidate the precise binding sites of the halogens on the lower aniline ring of lumiracoxib, although it appears that either atom could have accessibility to the small hydrophobic pocket utilized by the 2′-methyl group of indomethacin (Ala-527, Val-349, Ser-530, and Leu-531). Although the selectivity of lumiracoxib for COX-2 has been determined in vivo and the crystal structure of lumiracoxib-bound mCOX-2 has been solved, structure-activity relationship studies (SARs) have not been performed, and the chemical and structural basis for the balance that exists between potency and COX-2 selectivity remains unknown for this inhibitor. Therefore, we undertook the synthesis and characterization of a number of lumiracoxib analogs in an attempt to uncover the chemical determinants for selective COX-2 inhibition. In addition, the molecular basis for the selectivity of lumiracoxib was investigated by probing these chemical derivatives against Val-349 and Ser-530 mutants in the COX-2 active site. Materials and Enzymes−The starting materials, ligands, and catalysts for all chemical reactions were commercially available and were purchased from Sigma and Alfa Aesar (Ward Hill, MA). The synthesis and purification of both methylated and des-methyl lumiracoxib analogs was carried out as described in the supplemental materials with only minor modifications to the reaction conditions being necessary for individual compounds. The expression and purification of murine COX-2 and human COX-2 from insect cells and of ovine COX-1 from ram seminal vesicles was performed according to published methods (10.Rowlinson S.W. Crews B.C. Lanzo C.A. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23305-23310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis on murine COX-2 to generate V349A, V349I, V349L, and S530A mutants was performed as described by Prusakiewicz et al. (8.Prusakiewicz J.J. Felts A.S. Mackenzie B.S. Marnett L.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15439-15445Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). [1-14C]AA was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Synthesis and Structural Characterization of Lumiracoxib Analogs−Various 5′-methylated and des-methyl lumiracoxib analogs were synthesized as described in the supplemental materials (sections A and B) according to supplemental Schemes 1 and 2. Following synthesis, the mass of the purified product was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectra, and the structure was confirmed by one-dimensional 1H NMR. The purity of the product was assessed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a light scattering detector. The chemical characterization of each lumiracoxib analog is summarized in the supplemental materials (section C). Enzymes−All activity or inhibition studies were performed in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 500 μm phenol with hematin-reconstituted protein. All inhibitors were dissolved in Me2SO. Reactions were run with hematin-reconstituted proteins at final enzyme concentrations adjusted to give ∼30–35% substrate consumption (hCOX-2 = 145 nm, mCOX-2 = 63 nm, oCOX-1 = 22.5 nm, S530A = 165 nm, V349A = 250 nm, V349I = 268 nm, and V349L = 113 nm). Competitive Inhibition Assays for COX−Several assays were used to determine whether the various lumiracoxib analogs were competitive inhibitors of COX. In one assay, the dual administration of inhibitor and different concentrations of [1-14C]AA (6–50 μm) was performed following a 3-min equilibration of enzyme at 37 °C. In another method, inhibitor was prebound to enzyme for 3 min at 37 °C, followed by the addition of [1-14C]AA at different concentrations for 30 s. In an additional assay that examined the reversibility of COX inhibition, [1-14C]AA was added at a range of concentrations and incubated with inhibitorbound enzyme for different times (30 s to 5 min) to assess the ability of the substrate to compete off the inhibitor. All assays were terminated and analyzed for substrate consumption by TLC as previously described (11.Kalgutkar A.S. Crews B.C. Rowlinson S.W. Marnett A.B. Kozak K.R. Remmel R.P. Marnett L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 925-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The values reported were the average of two or more independent determinations. COX Inhibition Screening Assay−Concentration-dependent inhibition reactions were performed by preincubating the inhibitor and enzyme for 17 min at 25 °C, followed by 3 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of 50 μm [1-14C]AA for 30 s at 37 °C. Assays were terminated and analyzed for substrate consumption by TLC as described above. All inhibitor concentrations for 50% enzyme activity (IC50) were determined graphically using Prism and were the average of at least two independent determinations. Time-dependent COX Inhibition Assays−Time-dependent inhibition assays were conducted by preincubating increasing concentrations of the inhibitor with m/hCOX-2, oCOX-1, or the Val-349 mutants (V349A, V349I, and V349I) for various times (0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min) at 37 °C prior to the addition of 50 μm [1-14C]AA for 30 s at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated and analyzed by TLC as described above. The values of the kinetic parameters were the average of three independent determinations. Synthesis of Lumiracoxib and a Series of Lumiracoxib Analogs−A series of lumiracoxib analogs that varied in the substituents on the phenylacetic acid ring and on the lower aniline ring were synthesized (Table 1). Lumiracoxib itself (compound 1) was synthesized according to a previously published multistep synthetic method that is described in Scheme 1 of the supplemental materials (12.Acemoglu M. Allmendinger T. Calienni J. Cercus J. Loiseleur O. Sedelmeier G.H. Xu D. Tetrahedron. 2004; 60: 11571-11586Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The various structural analogs of lumiracoxib were also synthesized according to Scheme 1 (methyl derivatives; illustrated for compound 1) or Scheme 2 (des-methyl derivatives; illustrated for compound 11). Mass spectral analysis, one-dimensional proton NMR spectroscopic, and HPLC analyses were performed on each of the lumiracoxib analogs to confirm both the structure and purity of the compounds. The 1H NMR spectrum of each lumiracoxib derivative was compared with previously published spectra where available (12.Acemoglu M. Allmendinger T. Calienni J. Cercus J. Loiseleur O. Sedelmeier G.H. Xu D. Tetrahedron. 2004; 60: 11571-11586Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 13.Moser P. Sallmann A. Wiesenberg I. J. Med. Chem. 1990; 33: 2358-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and each of the analogs was shown by HPLC analysis with evaporative light scattering detection to elute as a single peak. The spectral characterization of each lumiracoxib analog is provided in the supplemental materials.TABLE 1Determination of IC50 values of lumiracoxib analogs with COX Each lumiracoxib analog was screened against purified oCOX-1, mCOX-2, and hCOX-2 as described under “Experimental Procedures” for COX inhibition assays. The lined symbol indicates less than 20% inhibition up to inhibitor concentrations of 4 μm. Where appropriate, the values in parentheses indicate the extent of inhibition (where the plateau for inhibition is reached) associated with each inhibitor. Evaluation of COX Inhibition by Lumiracoxib−The kinetic basis for lumiracoxib inhibition was determined. Following a 3-min equilibration of purified, hematin-reconstituted m/hCOX-2 or oCOX-1 at 37 °C, lumiracoxib and [1-14C]AA were added simultaneously and incubated for 30 s. No significant inhibition was observed over a wide range of inhibitor and substrate concentrations, indicating that lumiracoxib is not a pure competitive inhibitor (supplemental materials, section D, Fig. 1). We next tested lumiracoxib against purified m/hCOX-2 and oCOX-1 using a standard time-dependent protocol designed to determine IC50 values for enzyme inhibition. Fig. 3A shows the inhibition curve for lumiracoxib (compound 1). Lumiracoxib did not inhibit oCOX-1 to any appreciable extent, consistent with prior studies (14.Esser R. Berry C. Du Z. Dawson J. Fox A. Fujimoto R.A. Haston W. Kimble E.F. Koehler J. Peppard J. Quadros E. Quintavalla J. Toscano K. Urban L. van Duzer J. Zhang X. Zhou S. Marshall P.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 144: 538-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, however, lumiracoxib proved to be a poor inhibitor of both mCOX-2 (∼15% inhibition) and hCOX-2 (∼50% inhibition). Prior in vitro and in vivo experiments with lumiracoxib have demonstrated that the inhibitor exhibits slow, time-dependent inhibition of purified hCOX-2 with a Ki of 60 nm and IC50 values of 130 and 140 nm, respectively, for the inhibition of COX-2 in cell-based assays and human whole blood assays (14.Esser R. Berry C. Du Z. Dawson J. Fox A. Fujimoto R.A. Haston W. Kimble E.F. Koehler J. Peppard J. Quadros E. Quintavalla J. Toscano K. Urban L. van Duzer J. Zhang X. Zhou S. Marshall P.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 144: 538-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In our study, the inhibition of hCOX-2 activity plateaus at ∼50% inhibition and displays characteristics of a reversible inhibitor. Although the extent of inhibition of the human isoform is only 50%, our results do support the fact that lumiracoxib exhibits selectivity for hCOX-2 over COX-1, since no appreciable inhibition of oCOX-1 was observed even with very high concentrations of inhibitor (100 μm). The standard IC50 assay described above uses levels of arachidonic acid (50 μm) that are well above saturation. Thus, if inhibition of m/hCOX-2 by lumiracoxib is readily reversible, lumiracoxib would not be expected to strongly inhibit the COX activity at high substrate concentrations. To probe the effect of substrate concentration on enzyme inhibition, we incubated lumiracoxib with different concentrations of murine or human COX-2 for 3 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of [1-14C]AA (6–50 μm) for 30 s. Fig. 3B shows that lumiracoxib competes moderately with substrate at 50 μm AA but inhibits hCOX-2 to nearly 100% at high inhibitor concentrations and low arachidonate concentrations. Fig. 3C shows a similar profile for lumiracoxib and mCOX-2. Lumiracoxib is a weaker inhibitor of the murine enzyme, as demonstrated by the low extent of inhibition at 25 and 50 μm AA. In addition, lumiracoxib was not able to fully inhibit mCOX-2 even at the lowest substrate concentrations and highest inhibitor concentrations. Lumiracoxib, at a concentration of 1 μm, was prebound to purified enzymes for 3 min at 37 °C, followed by the addition of arachidonate at 50 μm for increasing times (30 s to 5 min). The time course for oxidation of arachidonate is a reflection of the dissociation of lumiracoxib; it exhibited rate constants of 0.0098 s-1 and 0.020 s-1 for hCOX-2 and mCOX-2, respectively (Fig. 4). These results corroborate the inhibition plateaus (15% for mCOX-2 and 50% for hCOX-2) that were initially observed with the IC50 screen and indicate a more rapid reversibility for the murine enzyme. Diclofenac was tested in the same assay and showed off-rates from murine and human COX-2 in the range of 2 × 10-5 s-1, suggesting a much more tightly bound inhibitor. The Kinetics of COX Inhibition by Lumiracoxib−The dependence of COX inhibition by lumiracoxib on time and inhibitor concentration was determined by adding arachidonic acid to wild-type COX preparations following preincubation with inhibitor for various times. The decrease in substrate conversion at different inhibitor concentrations was plotted against the preincubation times and fit to a single-exponential decay with a plateau to determine a value for kobs. The dependence of kobs on inhibitor concentration is represented by Equation 1, where KI corresponds to the inhibitor concentration that yields a rate equal to half the limiting rate, and k2 represents the limiting forward rate constant for inhibition (8.Prusakiewicz J.J. Felts A.S. Mackenzie B.S. Marnett L.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15439-15445Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The reverse rate constant, k-2, is equal to the y intercept and is zero for compounds that display functionally irreversible inhibition. kobs=((k2×[I])/(KI+[I]))+k-2(Eq.1) Table 2 shows the kinetic parameters for the time- and concentration-dependent inhibition of wild-type COX enzymes by lumiracoxib. The values for the inhibition of hCOX-2 were in good agreement with previously reported values of KI (0.06 μm) and k2 (0.005 s-1) (14.Esser R. Berry C. Du Z. Dawson J. Fox A. Fujimoto R.A. Haston W. Kimble E.F. Koehler J. Peppard J. Quadros E. Quintavalla J. Toscano K. Urban L. van Duzer J. Zhang X. Zhou S. Marshall P.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 144: 538-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Since different experimental assays were used to determine the kinetic parameters for COX inhibition, the present values of KI and k2 for lumiracoxib inhibition of hCOX-2 are slightly higher (0.32 μm and 0.087 s-1) than the values noted above. As indicated by a plateau at 50% activity remaining in the IC50 curve, the time-dependent inhibition of hCOX-2 by lumiracoxib resulted in a measurable k-2 (0.0017 s-1), which indicated that the second binding step was reversible. This k-2 is close to the off-rate for lumiracoxib from hCOX-2 measured from the time course of arachidonic acid oxygenation described above (0.0098 s-1) (Fig. 4). Not surprisingly, the kinetic parameters for the inhibition of murine COX-2 by lumiracoxib could not be determined at either room temperature or 37 °C due to poor inhibition of this enzyme by lumiracoxib at high arachidonate concentrations. This is in agreement with the attempted IC50 determination for lumiracoxib inhibition of mCOX-2 where a plateau was reached at 85% remaining activity.TABLE 2Kinetic parameters of time-dependent inhibition of COX enzymes and mutants by lumiracoxib (1.Lyseng-Williamson K.A.

Kulathila R. Koehn J. Rieffel S. Strauss A. Hu S. Kalfoglou M. Szeto D. Lasala D. Sabio M. Wang X. Marshall P. American Chemical Society: Book of Abstracts. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.2004: 22-26Google Scholar). The role of the halogen substituents on the lower aniline ring and the nature of their interactions with COX-1 or COX-2 has not been investigated. Hypothetically, the fluorine or chlorine substituents of lumiracoxib may also contribute to COX-2 selectivity and/or to the potency of inhibition. Purified and hematin-reconstituted hCOX-2, mCOX-2, and oCOX-1 were screened against lumiracoxib and the various synthetic analogs (compounds 1–22; Table 1) in our standard time dependence IC50 assay. Several compounds were additionally screened in separate assays to rule out COX inhibition at low arachidonate concentrations (data not shown). Fig. 5 shows the inhibition curves for diclofenac (A), lumiracoxib (B), and three lumiracoxib analogs (C–E) against purified COX-1 and COX-2. As expected from previously reported inhibition studies (7.Rowlinson S.W. Kiefer J.R. Prusakiewicz J.J. Pawlitz J.L. Kozak K.R. Kalgutkar A.S. Stallings W.C. Kurumbail R.G. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45763-45769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), diclofenac (compound 10) was a potent, nonselective inhibitor of all three cyclooxygenase isoforms. Replacement of the hydrogen with a methyl group at the 5′-position on the phenylacetic acid ring of diclofenac yields compound 2. Compound 2 appears to reversibly inhibit COX-1 (50% inhibition) but potently inhibits both mouse and human COX-2 in a functionally irreversible manner (nearly 90% inhibition) with IC50 values of 63 and 47 nm, respectively (Fig. 5D and Table 1). From these data, it appears that the addition of the methyl group on the phenyl acetic acid ring of compound 2 introduces COX-2 selectivity. In support of this hypothesis, a des-methyl lumiracoxib analog (compound 11) exhibits nonselective inhibition of all COX isoforms (Fig. 5C) compared with the selective hCOX-2 inhibition demonstrated by compound 1. A fluorine-to-chlorine substitution (compound 1 to compound 2) on the lower aniline ring significantly changes the potency of COX inhibition. Compound 1 inhibits hCOX-2 to only 50%, whereas inhibition of hCOX-2 by compound 2 results in nearly 90% inhibition (Fig. 5, B and D). Although diclofenac and compound 11 are both nonselective inhibitors, diclofenac demonstrates potent inhibition against all COX isoforms (∼90%) compared with its 6-fluoro counterpart (25–40%), supporting a role for the chemical substituents on the lower aniline ring in the potent inhibition of COX (Fig. 5, A and C). An additional substitution at the para position on the aniline ring (compound 6) abrogates the COX-2 selectivity observed with compound 2, suggesting that the precise positioning of substituents on the lower ring is required for selective inhibition of COX-2 (Fig. 5E). Replacement of the fluorine atom on lumiracoxib with hydrogen to give the monochlorinated compound 3 negates any of the hCOX-2 selectivity observed with lumiracoxib and yields a compound that is a very poor inhibitor of all three COX enzymes (Table 1). The monofluorinated compound 4 and the nonhalogenated compound 5 were similarly shown to be very poor, nonselective COX-1/2 inhibitors in this assay. The des-methyl versions of these mono- or nonhalogenated derivatives (compounds 12–14) showed identical results (Table 1), suggesting that a 2,6 substitution on the lower aniline ring is required for COX inhibition. However, derivatives that contained a 2,6-difluoro or 2-fluoro-6-methyl substitution did not inhibit any of the COX isoforms (compounds 7, 8, 15, and 16). Interestingly, a 2-chloro-6-methyl (compounds 9 and 17) or 2,6-dimethyl (compound 20) substitution restored potent and time-dependent COX inhibition. The addition of larger alkyl groups, such as ethyl (compound 21) and isopropyl (compound 22), to the ortho positions on the lower aniline ring resulted in a reduction of inhibitor potency (Table 1). Less potent inhibition of COX also was observed with derivatives that contained a trifluoromethyl substitution. Combined, these data indicate that a 2,6-dichloro, 2,6-dimethyl, or 2-chloro-6-methyl substitution is preferred for potent, time-dependent inhibition of COX. In addition, our SAR analysis corroborates the requirement for a methyl group on the phenylacetic acid ring to generate COX-2 selectivity when there is an appropriate 2,6 substitution on the lower aniline ring. Interestingly, a comparison between the 2,6-difluoro (compound 7) and 2-fluoro-6-chloro and (compound 1) substitution suggests a contributory role for the chlorine atom in COX-2 selectivity. Compound 7 does not inhibit COX, whereas lumiracoxib (compound 1) is selective for hCOX-2 over oCOX-1. This potential role for the chlorine atom in selectivity is further supported by a comparison between compounds 8 and 9 (a 2-fluoro-6-methyl substitution versus a 2-chloro-6-methyl substitution). Here again, the replacement of a fluorine atom with a chlorine"

NF-κB activation requires the IκB kinase (IKK) complex containing two catalytic subunits named IKKα and IKKβ that regulate distinct NF-κB pathways. IKKβ is critical for classical signaling that induces pro-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic gene profiles, whereas IKKα regulates the non-canonical pathway involved in lymphoid organogenesis and B-cell development. To determine whether IKKα and IKKβ differentially function in rescuing cells from death induced by activators of the classical and non-canonical pathways, we analyzed death after ligation of the TNF and lymphotoxin-β receptors, respectively. Using murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking each of the IKKs, the caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone, and dominant negative Fas-associated death domain protein, we found that deletion of these kinases sensitized MEFs to distinct cell death pathways. MEFs lacking IKKα were sensitized to death in response to both cytokines that was entirely caspase-dependent, demonstrating that IKKα functions in this process. Surprisingly, death of IKKβ–/– MEFs was not blocked by caspase inhibition, demonstrating that IKKβ negatively regulates caspase-independent cell death (CICD). CICD was strongly activated by both TNF and lymphotoxin-β receptor ligation in IKKβ–/– MEFs and was accompanied by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the generation of reactive oxygen species. CICD was inhibited by the anti-oxidant butylated hydroxyanosole and overexpression of Bcl-2, neither of which blocked caspase-dependent apoptosis. Our findings, therefore, demonstrate that both IKKα and IKKβ regulate cytokine-induced apoptosis, and IKKβ additionally represses reactive oxygen species- and mitochondrial-dependent CICD.

Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3391) Google Scholar). In addition to inducing pro-inflammatory gene transcription, NF-κB also regulates the transcriptional activation of many anti-apoptotic genes including the caspase-8 inhibitor c-FLIP, the caspase inhibitors c-IAP1 and -2, the Bcl-2 homologue A1, and the signal inhibitor A20 (2.Hu X.

Induction of this anti-apoptotic gene profile is pivotal for the prevention of programmed cell death initiated in response to TNF and ligation of other death receptors. Ligation of the TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) by TNF initiates its ligand-induced trimerization leading to the recruitment of adapter proteins named TNFR-1-associated death domain protein and Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD). FADD initiates the recruitment and autocatalytic activation of procaspase-8 via its death effector domain, or alternatively, it may bind the caspase-8 inhibitor c-FLIP, thereby preventing the activation of this protease (5.Boldin M.P.

In the absence of NF-κB activation and induction of c-FLIP, caspase-8 activation results in proteolytic activation of effector caspases including caspase-3. This process occurs either directly or via a mitochondrial amplification process dependent upon the cleavage of Bcl-2 homology domain (BH)3-only-containing proteins such as Bid that bind and oligomerize the “multidomain” proteins Bax or Bak (7.Wei M.C.

The mechanisms through which the TNF family member lymphotoxin-β (LTβ) activates NF-κB and initiates apoptosis are less well defined. The LTβ receptor does not contain a death domain; however, the death process is dependent upon self-association of the receptor, TRAF3, TRAF2, c-IAP1, and SMAC (9.Force W.R. Cheung T.C. Ware C.F. J.

It is clear, however, that for both TNF receptor- and LTβ receptor-induced signaling, the precise series of biochemical events upstream of NF-κB activation is critical for both the control of inflammation and the regulation of apoptosis. NF-κB proteins are retained inactive in the cytosol through interaction with members of the IκB family of proteins typified by IκBα (1.Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3391) Google Scholar). Activation of NF-κB requires the signal-induced phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of IκBs, thereby allowing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus. IκB phosphorylation is facilitated by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex that contains two catalytic subunits named IKKα and IKKβ and a regulatory subunit named NEMO (NF-κB essential modulator) (13.Scheidereit C. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6685-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Genetic studies manipulating components of the IKK complex revealed that NF-κB activation induced by the rapid and transient degradation of IκB family members in response to pro-inflammatory cytokines is dependent upon IKKβ and NEMO (13.Scheidereit C. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6685-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). This “classical” NF-κB pathway is largely independent of IKKα (14.Bonizzi G. Karin M. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2112) Google Scholar). In contrast, IKKα is critical for activation of the “non-canonical” NF-κB pathway that involves IKKα-dependent processing of NF-κB2/p100 to generate p52 (15.Bonizzi G. Bebien M. Otero D.C.

Activation of the non-canonical pathway occurs in response to a limited number of ligands including lymphotoxin α1β2 (LTα1β2), CD40L, and BAFF and functions primarily in the maturation of B cells and the development of organized secondary lymphoid tissue (14.Bonizzi G. Karin M. Trends Immunol. 2004; 25: 280-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2112) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in the noncanonical pathway, IKKα functions in the nucleus to regulate NF-κB-dependent target genes by a number of mechanisms including promoter-associated histone H3 phosphorylation (17.Anest V.

Nature. 2005; 434: 1138-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar) have also been described. Current evidence, therefore, indicates that signals induced by distinct cytokines utilize separate components of the IKK complex. In this regard TNF strongly activates the classical pathway but does not induce non-canonical signaling, suggesting that this cytokine predominately activates IKKβ. However, LTα1β2 only moderately activates the classical pathway but strongly stimulates the non-canonical pathway, suggesting that it predominantly signals via IKKα. We, therefore, sought to determine whether IKKα and IKKβ play separate or overlapping roles in regulating apoptosis in response to TNF and LTα1β2. Using IKKα–/– and IKKβ–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), the broad range caspase inhibitor zVADfmk, and transduction with dominant negative FADD to block receptor-induced caspase activation, we found that deletion of these kinases sensitized MEFs to distinct cell death pathways. Thus, MEFs lacking IKKα were sensitized to death that was entirely caspase-mediated, whereas the death of IKKβ–/– cells was not blocked by caspase inhibition. Interestingly, we did not observe similar caspase-independent cell death (CICD) in NEMO-deficient cells, demonstrating that IKKβ normally represses CICD in a NEMO-independent manner. We further found that CICD in IKKβ–/– MEFs was dependent upon the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and could be blocked by overexpression of Bcl-2. Our findings, therefore, demonstrate that both IKKα and IKKβ regulate cytokine-induced apoptosis, and IKKβ additionally represses ROS and mitochondrial-dependent CICD.

Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2173) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after transfection, phoenix cells were selected using growth media supplemented with puromycin (1 μg/ml). After expansion of the cell population, media supplemented with puromycin was removed, and cells were washed then returned to normal growth media for a period of 12–24 h. This media was collected, supplemented with Polybrene (8 μg/ml), filtered, and used immediately or stored at –80 °C. MEFs were retrovirally transduced by 2–3 rounds of incubation with retroviral-conditioned media for 6–12 h at 37 °C. This procedure resulted in infection of at least 95% of the population. Cell Viability Assays−In all assays floating cells were collected and pooled with remaining attached cells that were harvested using trypsin/EDTA. Annexin V Staining−Cells were washed in PBS, and each sample was re-suspended in 100 μl of annexin V staining buffer (10 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) containing Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated annexin V (5 μl/sample). Samples were incubated at room temperature for 15–20 min before the addition of a further 400 μl of annexin V staining buffer and immediate analysis by FACS using Cell Quest software (FACSort, BD Biosciences). Propidium Iodide (PI) Permeabilization Assay−Cells were washed once in PBS before the addition of PBS containing PI (25 μg/ml). After incubation for 20 min at 37 °C, the cells were analyzed by FACS. Cell Cycle and Hypodiploid DNA Analysis−Harvested cells were washed in PBS and fixed for 30–60 min in 70% ethanol at 4 °C. After fixation, samples were washed once more before incubation in PBS containing PI (50 μg/ml) and RNase A (1 μg/ml) for at least 1 h. DNA analysis was performed by FACS. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (ΔΨ) Analysis−Floating and attached cells were harvested following the procedures described above. Cells were washed once in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin before re-suspension in 200 μl of PBS/bovine serum albumin containing JC-1 (10 μg/ml). After 15 min of incubation at 37 °C MEFs were washed, re-suspended in PBS, and analyzed by FACS. Western Blotting−For all immunoblots, each well of a 12-well plate was treated as described. After experimental manipulation, any detached cells were collected, washed in PBS, and pooled with the lysate from the same well prepared by washing the adherent cells twice in ice-cold PBS before the addition of 100–200 μl of TNT lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100) containing complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), NaF (2 mm), and β-glycerophosphate (2 mm). Protein content was determined using Coomassie Plus Reagent (Pierce), and for each sample an equal amount of protein (10–20 μg) was fractionated by SDS-PAGE then transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore, Milford, MA) and immunoblotted with the appropriate primary and species-specific horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Westgrove, PA). Detection of the bound antibody by chemiluminescence was performed using Luminol reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Santa Cruz). ROS Measurement−After experimental manipulation, floating and attached cells were harvested and pooled, then washed once in PBS before incubation in prewarmed PBS containing H2DCFDA (10 μm) for 20 min at room temperature. Samples were then washed once in PBS before re-suspension in PBS. After incubation at room temperature for a further 10–15 min, samples were analyzed by FACS. TNF and LTα1β2 Induce Cell Death in IKKα–/– and IKKβ–/– MEFs−To compare the mechanisms of cell death induced by TNF and LTα1β2, we utilized MEFs lacking either IKKα or IKKβ. Although IKKβ critically regulates the classical NF-κB pathway and induction of anti-apoptotic genes, we found that deletion of either kinase sensitized MEFs to cell death in response to both TNF and LTα1β2. Death was detected by detachment of MEFs from the culture dish (not shown), an increase in annexin V staining (Figs. 1, A and B), and an increase in membrane permeability determined by uptake of propidium iodide (Fig. 1, C and D). Interestingly, MEFs lacking IKKβ were less sensitive to death in response to LTα1β2 than TNF. In contrast, MEFs lacking IKKα were equally sensitive to either TNF or LTα1β2. Caspase Inhibition Does Not Prevent Death in IKKβ–/– MEFs−To determine whether the cell death we observed in response to cytokine treatment of IKKα-orIKKβ-deficient MEFs was caspase-dependent apoptosis, we employed the broad range caspase inhibitor zVADfmk. To confirm its activity, we determined the effects of zVADfmk on cell death in HUVEC induced by TNF plus cycloheximide as this death is well characterized as apoptosis (22.Madge L.A. Li J.H. Choi J. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21295-21306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Treatment of HUVEC with TNF plus cycloheximide resulted in apoptosis measured by increased uptake of PI that was completely blocked by co-treatment with zVADfmk (25 μm) (Figs. 2, A and B). zVADfmk also effectively blocked DNA fragmentation in HUVEC (Fig. 2C). MEFs lacking IKKα behaved in a similar manner to HUVEC. Thus, LTα1β2 induced death characterized by PI uptake that was completely blocked by incubation with zVADfmk (Figs. 2, D and E). Similar effects were observed when IKKα–/– MEFs were treated with TNF (not shown). Surprisingly, however, the death of IKKβ-deficient cells in response to TNF was unaffected by co-treatment with zVADfmk. We did not observe any inhibition of cell detachment from the culture plate (not shown) or uptake of PI (Fig. 3, A and open bars in B) at any concentration of zVADfmk tested (up to 50 μm). Remarkably, the extent of LTα1β2-induced cell death in IKKβ–/– MEFs actually increased in the presence of zVADfmk (Fig. 3, A and gray bars in B). Despite failing to inhibit cell death, zVADfmk prevented the generation of hypodiploid DNA in IKKβ–/– MEFs (Fig. 3C), indicating that the death mechanism was not apoptosis. Because zVADfmk is a relatively poor inhibitor of caspase-2, we also used the caspase-2 inhibitor zVDVADfmk. Treatment of IKKβ–/– MEFs with TNF in the presence of zVDVADfmk (25 μm) either alone or in combination with zVADfmk (25 μm) did not prevent cell death (data not shown). Hence, a lack of caspase-2 inhibition and escape from protease inhibition was unlikely to account for the failure of zVADfmk to prevent cell death. IKKβ Represses Death in zVADfmk-treated MEFs in a NEMO-independent Manner−To determine whether the TNF-induced death of zVADfmk-treated IKKβ–/– cells could be repressed by exogenous IKKβ, we reconstituted IKKβ-deficient MEFs by retroviral transduction with LZRS-IKKβ. As shown in Figs. 4, A and B, transduction with IKKβ but not LZRS alone markedly reduced the TNF-induced cell death observed in the presence of zVADfmk. The activity of IKKβ in regulating the classical NF-κB pathway is critically dependent upon its interaction with NEMO. We, therefore, questioned whether the death observed in zVADfmk-treated IKKβ–/– MEFs also occurred in cells lacking NEMO. Interestingly, TNF-induced death of NEMO–/– MEFs was completely blocked by ZVADfmk (Fig. 4, C and D), demonstrating that IKKβ functions independently of NEMO to repress cell death in zVADfmk-treated cells. Dominant Negative FADD Recapitulates the Effects of zVADfmk in IKKβ–/– MEFs−Our findings strongly suggest that the cell death observed in zVADfmk-treated cells lacking IKKβ is caspase-independent. However, to ensure that the effects were not an artifact of the inhibitor and could be recapitulated by non-pharmacological caspase inhibition, we transduced IKKα–/– and IKKβ–/– cells with a dominant negative version of FADD (FADDDN) to prevent receptor-mediated caspase activation. Similar to zVADfmk, FADDDN prevented TNF-induced death of IKKα–/– MEFs but exacerbated the death observed in IKKβ–/– cells (Figs. 5, A and B). Taken together, the findings in Figs. 3, 4, 5 lead us to conclude that cell death induced in IKKβ–/– cells by TNF and LTα1β2 in the presence of ZVADfmk is caspase-independent cell death (CICD). CICD in IKKβ–/– MEFs Is Dependent on the Mitochondria−To characterize the CICD induced in the absence of IKKβ, we explored the effects of TNF on mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ). Using the ΔΨ-sensitive dye JC-1, we found that treatment of IKKβ–/– MEFs with TNF caused a loss of ΔΨ that could not be prevented by co-incubation with zVADfmk (Fig. 6A). Treatment with LTα1β2 and zVADfmk led to a similar loss of ΔΨ (not shown). We next questioned whether TNF and/or zVADfmk treatment affected the levels of the mitochondrial regulatory proteins Bcl-2, Bax, and Bcl-2-binding protein beclin-1. The expression levels of each of these proteins were unaffected by treatment of either WT or IKKβ–/– MEFs with TNF in the absence or presence of zVADfmk (data not shown). Overexpression of Bcl-2 prevents mitochondria-dependent cell death in response to a wide range of stimuli and conditions including treatment with the DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agent etoposide (23.Elliott M.J. Murphy K.M. Stribinskiene L. Ranganathan V. Sturges E. Farnsworth M.L. Lock R.B. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1999; 44: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 24.Murphy K.M. Ranganathan V. Farnsworth M.L. Kavallaris M. Lock R.B. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). We confirmed that etoposide induced death in IKKβ–/– MEFs and that Bcl-2 overexpression effectively inhibited this process (Fig. 6B). We, therefore, investigated the effect of Bcl-2 overexpression on the death of IKKβ–/– MEFs in response to TNF and LTα1β2 plus ZVADfmk. As shown in Fig. 6, C and D, Bcl-2 overexpression did not affect the death of IKKβ–/– MEFs treated with LTα1β2 or TNF alone; however, it did prevent death in response to these cytokines in the presence of zVADfmk (Figs. 6, C and D). This, therefore, suggests that the death pathway in IKKβ–/– MEFs treated with cytokines changes in the presence of zVADfmk to one that is dependent upon the mitochondria. CICD in IKKβ–/– MEFs Is Dependent on the Generation of ROS−Because mitochondrial function is closely linked to the generation of ROS, we questioned whether TNF treatment induced ROS in IKKβ–/– MEFs and whether scavenging such species could inhibit death. Using the dye H2DCFDA, we found that TNF treatment of WT MEFs did not lead to ROS generation, whereas a significant increase was observed in MEFs lacking IKKβ (Figs. 7, A and B). In WT MEFs, treatment with zVADfmk caused an increase in the generation of ROS in that it was reduced by co-treatment with TNF (Figs. 7, A and B). In contrast, treatment of IKKβ–/– MEFs with zVADfmk alone had no effect on ROS, and co-treatment with zVADfmk plus TNF still resulted in increased ROS levels (Figs. 7, A and B). To determine whether the generation of ROS contributed to TNF-induced cell death in IKKβ–/– MEFs, we utilized the ROS scavenger BHA. Pretreatment of IKKβ–/– MEFs with BHA significantly diminished the death of IKKβ–/– cells treated with TNF plus ZVADfmk but did not affect the death induced by TNF treatment alone (Figs. 7, C and D). Similar effects were observed when cells were treated with LTα1β2 and zVADfmk (not shown). Together with the data in Fig. 6, C and D, these findings further support a model in which the death pathway activated in IKKβ–/– MEFs by TNF or LTα1β2 alters the phenotype after the addition of zVADfmk to become dependent on the mitochondria and the generation of ROS. ROS levels can be regulated by the expression of scavenging enzymes. We, therefore, questioned whether treatment of IKKβ–/– MEFs with TNF and zVADfmk affected the expression of Mn-SOD and catalase that have been implicated recently in the regulation of cell death in response to both of these mediators (25.Kamata H. Honda S. Maeda S. Chang L. Hirata H. Karin M. Cell. 2005; 120: 649-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar, 26.Yu L. Wan F. Dutta S. Welsh S. Liu Z. Freundt E. Baehrecke E.H. Lenardo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4952-4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Mn-SOD expression was induced by TNF in WT MEFs, and this was not affected by the presence of zVADfmk (Fig. 8A; lanes 1–4). In MEFs lacking IKKβ, basal Mn-SOD expression was significantly reduced and was not modulated by TNF either alone or in combination with zVADfmk (Fig. 8A; lanes 5–8). Despite the recent report that zVADfmk decreases catalase levels by a posttranscriptional mechanism (26.Yu L. Wan F. Dutta S. Welsh S. Liu Z. Freundt E. Baehrecke E.H. Lenardo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 4952-4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), we did not observe any clear effect of TNF, zVADfmk, or TNF plus zVADfmk on its expression in either WT or IKKβ–/– MEFs (Fig. 8B). We did observe modification of catalase resulting in the appearance on immunoblots of bands both above and below the catalase band (lanes 3 and 4). The nature of these modifications remains unclear; however, no such modified catalase was detected in IKKβ–/– cells treated with zVADfmk (lanes 7 and 8), suggesting that this is dependent upon functional IKKβ. Cell death is a highly regulated process necessary for development. Dysregulation of the signals that control cell death can result in either failure to die or enhanced death that in turn supports tumor growth or leads to excessive tissue damage, respectively. To develop a clearer picture of the death signals induced by TNF family members, we utilized MEFs lacking either IKKα or IKKβ to determine whether these kinases played distinct roles in regulating death induced by TNF or LTα1β2. We found that cells lacking either kinase were sensitized to death in response to both cytokines, although more death occurred in IKKβ–/– MEFs incubated with TNF than those treated with LTα1β2. Conversely, LTα1β2 treatment caused greater cell death in IKKα–/– MEFS than TNF. We, therefore, conclude that signaling through IKKα and IKKβ differentially predominates to counteract the cell death signaling pathways induced by the separate cytokines. Our finding that both TNF and LTα1β2 induce apoptosis in IKKα–/– cells was surprising in light of previous studies of mice lacking each of the IKK subunits. Animals lacking either NEMO or IKKβ die during development from massive hepatocyte apoptosis (27.Li Z.W. Chu W. Hu Y. Delhase M. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. J. Exp.

https://openalex.org/W2165943471,"Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neuropsychiatric disorder of complex pathogenesis caused by acute or chronic liver failure. We studied the etiology of cerebral dysfunction in a murine model of HE induced by either bile duct ligation or thioacetamide administration. We report that stimulation of cerebral AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a major intracellular energy sensor, is a compensatory response to liver failure. This function of AMPK is regulated by endocannabinoids. The cannabinoid system controls systemic energy balance via the cannabinoid receptors CB-1 and CB-2. Under normal circumstances, AMPK activity is mediated by CB-1 while CB-2 is barely detected. However, CB-2 is strongly stimulated in response to liver failure. Administration of delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) augmented AMPK activity and restored brain function in WT mice but not in their CB-2 KO littermates. These results suggest that HE is a disease of energy flux. CB-2 signaling is a cerebral stress response mechanism and makes AMPK a promising target for its treatment by modulating the cannabinoid system."

Hormones and cytokines in circulation represent a typical mode of cell-cell communication via diffusible extracellular signal molecules. Extracellular concentrations and affinities to cell-surface receptors are the major determinants of the potency of signaling proteins. However, with the exception of hematopoietic and/or blood cells, all single cells throughout the various organs receive their signaling cues from the extracellular matrix (ECM). 3The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; rhFGF-2, recombinant human fibroblast growth factor-2; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; BmCPV, Bombyx mori cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; FBS, fetal bovine serum; DME medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GFP, green fluorescence protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ITS, insulin, transferrin, and selenite. 3The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; rhFGF-2, recombinant human fibroblast growth factor-2; FGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor; BmCPV, Bombyx mori cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus; BrdUrd, bromodeoxyuridine; FBS, fetal bovine serum; DME medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GFP, green fluorescence protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ITS, insulin, transferrin, and selenite. The basal lamina underlying the epithelial cell sheets and the specialized ECM in the mesenchyme, such as cartilage and bone, play a crucial role in this regard during the regulation of cellular behavior (1Ramirez F. Rifkin D.B. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The ECM provides a supramolecular architecture for the disposition of specific accessory molecules that exist in low abundance, such as growth factors, which are released after proteolytic cleavage to effect a downstream alteration in the behavior of the responding cells. Conversely, cells that regulate remodeling (or degradation under certain conditions) of the ECM do so via the production and secretion of proteases and protease inhibitors (2Sternlicht M.D. Werb Z. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 463-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (3193) Google Scholar). Thus, each individual cell sends and receives spatiotemporally restricted signals from its extracellular environment. However, only limited tools are currently available that can generate signaling cues in a spatially restricted manner, at the cellular or subcellular level in vitro, to enable further studies of these events.Previously, we developed a novel protein expression system that enables us to immobilize foreign proteins on insect virus occlusion bodies of protein crystals, termed polyhedra (3Ikeda K.

Proteomics. 2006; 6: 54-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Polyhedra are the main vectors of virus particles from insects and are also the main agents that facilitate the survival of the virus, as they stabilize the virions allowing them to remain viable for very long periods in the environment (5Rohrmann G.F.

As polyhedra are quite stable and are virtually insoluble at physiological pH, infection occurs by the release of the virus particles at high pH in the insect intestine after ingestion. Recently we resolved the 2-Å crystal structure of recombinant and infectious Bombyx mori cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (BmCPV) polyhedra, which are the smallest proteinous crystals yet used for de novo x-ray protein crystallography (7Coulibaly F.

In this expression system, the foreign proteins containing the immobilization signal are produced under the control of the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter and are occluded into BmCPV polyhedra comprising crystallized recombinant BmCPV polyhedrin protein (Fig. 1A) (8Mori H.

As fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) is one of the well characterized heparin-binding growth factors and regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration (10Thisse B. Thisse C. Dev. Biol. 2005; 287: 390-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), here we attempted to produce polyhedra-immobilized growth factors using this technology, including human FGF-2.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Recombinant human fibroblast growth factor-2 (rhFGF-2) was purchased from R&D Systems. PD98059 and SU5402 were purchased from New England Biolabs and Calbiochem, respectively. Affi-Gel blue gel was purchased from Bio-Rad Laboratories. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) was purchased from Roche Applied Science.Virus and Cells—The Spodoptera frugiperda cell line IPLB-Sf21-AE (Sf21) was maintained in tissue culture flasks in TC-100 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). A recombinant form of BmCPV (AcCP-H), which produces cubic polyhedra (8Mori H. Ito R. Nakazawa H. Sumida M. Matsubara F. Minobe Y. J. Gen.

NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's (DME) medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS (Biological Industries) and 50 μg/ml kanamycin (Sigma) at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air. ATDC5 cells were grown in a 1:1 mixture of DME and Ham's F-12 (DME/F-12) medium (Asahi Techno Glass Corp.) containing 5% FBS (Biological Industries), 10 μg/ml human insulin (Roche Applied Science), 10 μg/ml human transferrin (Roche Applied Science), and 3 × 10-8 m sodium selenite (Sigma) at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air as described previously (11Shukunami C.

The culture medium was replaced three times a week.Construction of Recombinant Baculoviruses—A cDNA fragment (nucleotides 135-292) derived from BmCPV segment 4 and encoding the N-terminal sequence (amino acids 42-93) of VP3 was amplified using the primers 5′-ATGCAGATCTATGCTAGCTTTCAACTCACAACGACGATCAACAACGTTA-3′ and 5′-ATGCGGATCCTTTATTCCGCCGTTACTAGTGTAAATTGTCAATTAA-3′. The PCR products were then digested with NheI and BamHI and cloned into the XbaI and BglII sites of the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1393 (Pharmingen) to generate the pVL1393/VP3 construct. GATE-WAY cloning technology (Invitrogen) was then used to facilitate the high throughput expression and immobilization of FGF-2. A “destination vector” was constructed by inserting a cassette consisting of an attR1 site at the 5′-end, the chloramphenicol resistance gene, the ccdB gene, and an attR2 site at the 3′-end into the SmaI site of pVL1393/VP3. The ORF of the FGF-2 gene was then amplified by PCR, in which the attB1 and attB2 sequences were included in the primers 5′-GGGGACAAGTTTGTACAAAAAAGCAGGCTTCATGGGGGACCGCGGGCGCGGCCGC-3′ and GGGGACCACTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTCGCTCTTAGCAGACATTGGAAGAAA-3′. The resulting attB-flanked PCR products were then cloned into a donor vector containing an attP1 site at its 5′-end, the chloramphenicol resistance gene, the ccdB gene, and an attP2 site at the 3′-end by BP reactions of GATEWAY cloning technology (Invitrogen) using the BP clonase enzyme mixture. The open reading frame insert of FGF-2 in the resulting “entry” vector was then transferred to the destination vector via LR clonase reactions. The resulting “expression” vector pAcFGF-2/VP3 consisted of the N terminus of VP3 fused in-frame to the open reading frame of FGF-2 in the background of the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1393. The recombinant transfer vector pAcFGF-2/VP3 was co-transfected into Sf21 cells together with linearized AcNPV DNA (Baculogold baculovirus DNA, Pharmingen). The recombinant AcNPVs produced by rescue of the linearized viral DNA were then harvested and isolated by plaque purification to obtain the recombinant baculovirus AcFGF-2/VP3.Purification of Polyhedra—Sf21 cells were inoculated with recombinant AcCP-H virus to generate normal polyhedra at a multiplicity of infection of 10 plaque-forming units/cell. For double infections with AcCP-H and AcFGF-2/VP3 to obtain FGF-2 polyhedra, each virus was added at a multiplicity of infection of 5 plaque-forming units/cell. The infected cells were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 20 mm NaH2PO4, 20 mm Na2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH7.2), and homogenized to remove the cell membrane and nuclear envelope using the ultrasonic homogenizer VP-5S (Taitec). The polyhedra preparations were then washed with sterile water containing penicillin (10,000 unit/ml) and streptomycin (10 mg/ml) by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. The size of each polyhedron was determined using a microscope equipped with a scale bar.F-actin Staining—ATDC5 cells were seeded onto a collagen-coated 8-well Lab-Tek II chamber slide (Nalge Nunc International) at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well and cultured to confluence in DME/F-12 medium containing ITS and 5% FBS for 3 days. GFP polyhedra (1 × 107) were then added to the confluent cells, which were incubated for a further 10 min. The cells were then washed twice with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. After fixation, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 1% of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and subjected to staining with Alexa Fluor 594 phalloidin (Molecular Probes) and 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with PBS three times, the cells were mounted using a ProLong Antifade kit (Molecular Probes). Fluorescent micrographs were captured on a DM IRBE fluorescence microscope (Leica) using a charge-coupled device camera (CCD; Hamamatsu Photonics), and image analysis was performed with IPLabs software (Solution Systems).In Vitro BrdUrd Labeling—ATDC5 cells were seeded onto a collagen-coated 8-well Lab-TeK II chamber slide at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well and grown to confluence in DME/F-12 medium containing ITS and 5% FBS. Cells were incubated to quiescence in the culture medium supplemented with 0.5% FBS for 24 h. The cultures were then treated with normal polyhedra (2 × 104), FGF-2 polyhedra (2 × 104), bovine serum albumin (10 μg/ml), or rhFGF-2 (5 ng/ml) for a further 15 h. BrdUrd (10 μm) was added to the cultures and incubated for another hour at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air. The cultures were washed three times with PBS and fixed with 70% ethanol containing 50 mm glycine-HCl buffer (pH 2.0) at room temperature. The fixed cells were washed with 10% FBS containing DME/F-12 medium and incubated with 4 m HCl for 15 min at room temperature. The BrdUrd-labeled DNA was detected by using a primary anti-BrdUrd antibody (Dakocytomation) and a secondary goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes).DNA Synthesis—NIH3T3 cells were grown to confluence in DME medium containing 10% FBS and then starved in medium supplemented with 0.5% FBS only for a further 40 h. The ATDC5 cells were allowed to reach confluence in DME/F-12 medium containing 5% FBS and ITS for 3 days and then serumstarved in DME/F-12 medium containing 0.5% FBS for 22 h. The cultures were then treated with 1 ng/ml rhFGF-2 and with different amounts of normal or FGF-2 polyhedra. PD98059 and SU5402 were used at a concentration of 50 and 20 μg/ml, respectively. BrdUrd incorporation was determined with a bromo-2′-deoxyuridine labeling kit III (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Absorbances at 405 and 490 nm were determined using a model 450 microplate reader (Bio-Rad).Western Blot Analysis—Purified polyhedra were dissolved in sample buffer by heating at 100 °C for 5 min. The dissolved proteins were then resolved via 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transblotted electrophoretically onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was saturated with washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl) containing 1% gelatin and incubated overnight at 25 °C with monoclonal antibody against FGF-2 bFM-2 (100 ng/ml). After several washes, the membrane was then incubated for 1 h at 25 °C with a 1:3000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horse-radish peroxidase (Bio-Rad). NIH3T3 cells and ATDC5 cells were washed twice with PBS twice dissolved in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol. The resulting cell lysates were then harvested, sonicated, and cleaned by centrifugation. Samples were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). After preincubation with blocking buffer containing 5% non-fat milk, 0.1% Tween 20, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, the membranes were incubated with either p44/42 MAP kinase or phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibodies, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (New England Biolabs). Peroxidase activity was detected and visualized by ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions.Quantification of FGF-2 by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—ATDC5 cells were plated into a 24-well at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well and grown to confluence in DME/F-12 medium containing ITS and 5% FBS. Normal polyhedra (0.5 × 105) or FGF-2 polyhedra (0.5 × 105) were added to a well with or without cells and incubated for 24 h in DME/F-12 medium containing ITS and 5% FBS. Five hundred μl of conditioned medium or medium without cells was collected. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min, 100 μl of medium was used to determine the quantity of FGF-2 using a Quantikine human FGF basic immunoassay kit (R&D Systems). Absorbance at 450 and 570 nm was determined using a model 450 microplate reader (Bio-Rad).RESULTSThe virion outer capsid protein VP3 of BmCPV encoding the immobilization signal was fused to the 18-kDa form of FGF-2 at either the N or C terminus for the production of polyhedra containing immobilized FGF-2. This chimeric protein was then co-expressed with a BmCPV polyhedrin using a baculovirus expression vector system (Fig. 1A). The polyhedra were then purified from the co-infected host cells. A band of ∼35 kDa was detectable for both BmCPV polyhedra that did not harbor any foreign proteins and for the polyhedra containing FGF-2 fused to VP3 at the C terminus (Fig. 1B, left panel). Although we could not readily distinguish the FGF-2 fusion protein (with an estimated size of ≈30 kDa) from the large quantities of co-existing polyhedra by SDS-PAGE, the expression of FGF-2 could be detected as an ∼30 kDa band by Western blotting using a specific monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1B, right panel) (13Matsuzaki K. Yoshitake Y. Matuo Y. Sasaki H. Nishikawa K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9911-9915Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, only degradation products of FGF-2 were found in polyhedra where FGF-2 was fused with VP3 at the N terminus (data not shown). We therefore used the C-terminally fused FGF-2 polyhedra in our subsequent analyses and employed the non-fused polyhedra as negative controls.Fig. 1C indicates the size distribution of purified normal and FGF-2 polyhedra determined by microscopy. Most of these complexes were found to be within the 2-7 μm size range. To further visualize these dimensions, polyhedra containing immobilized enhanced GFP were added to confluent cultures of mouse chondrogenic ATDC5 cells (Fig. 1D) (11Shukunami C. Shigeno C. Atsumi T. Ishizeki K. Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 12Shukunami C. Ishizeki K. Atsumi T. Ohta Y. Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1174-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The nuclei and actin filaments of these cells were then stained by phalloidin and 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole, respectively, and each of the enhanced GFP polyhedra was detectable as green fluorescent cubes of less than 10 μm in size (Fig. 1D). In addition, these polyhedra showed an affinity for cell surfaces, an association that was not disrupted by either medium changes or extensive rinsing with PBS prior to fixation and staining. This adhesive characteristic of polyhedra is a favorable property that enabled us to target these complexes to a specific site in cultured cells and thus examine the dynamic cellular behavior at the single cell level.To evaluate the biological activity of FGF-2, we studied the effects of FGF-2 polyhedra on the proliferation of mouse chondrogenic ATDC5 cells in culture. Undifferentiated ATDC5 cells are known to express FGFR1 and FGFR2, and the expression of FGFR3 is induced during chondrogenic differentiation (14Shimizu A. Tada K. Shukunami C. Hiraki Y. Kurokawa T. Magane N. Kurokawa-Seo M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11031-11040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). When FGF-2 polyhedra were added to the undifferentiated quiescent ATDC5 cells at confluence, proliferating cells were detected by in situ BrdUrd labeling (Fig. 2B). In contrast to quiescent flat cells making close contacts with one another (Fig. 2E), BrdUrd-labeled growing cells lost their contacts and took on spindle-like morphology (Fig. 2F). In contrast, normal polyhedra did not show any growth stimulatory activity (Fig. 2A). Recombinant human FGF-2 in solution similarly stimulated the growth of ATDC5 cells (Fig. 2D) and induced morphological change (Fig. 2H) as compared with those treated with BSA only (Fig. 2C). Next, we studied the effects of FGF-2 polyhedra on DNA synthesis of mouse fibroblasts in culture. FGF-2 polyhedra were found to stimulate DNA synthesis of NIH3T3 cells in a dose-dependent manner to an extent that was comparable with 10% FBS supplementation, whereas normal polyhedra did not exert any such growth effects (Fig. 3A). We found in our current experiments that dissolved rhFGF-2 at a dose of 1 ng/ml similarly stimulates DNA synthesis in ATDC5 cells, whereas SU5402, a synthetic inhibitor of the FGF signaling, efficiently blocks this effect (Fig. 3B). Moreover, when we added 5 × 103 and 1 × 104 FGF-2 polyhedra to serum-starved ATDC5 cells, BrdUrd incorporation was found to be 3.6 and 4.6 times higher, respectively, than in the nonstimulated cells (Fig. 3B). SU5402 exposure also clearly inhibited this FGF-2 polyhedra stimulation of DNA synthesis in these experiments (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that FGF-2 polyhedra stimulate the growth of ATDC5 cells through FGF receptor-mediated signaling, which triggers downstream signal transduction cascades including the RAS-MAP kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) pathways (15Eswarakumar V.P.

Cells were then incubated to be quiescent in 0.5% FBS-containing DME/F-12 medium for 24 h and further cultured in the presence of normal polyhedra (NP, 2 × 104 polyhedra), FGF-2 polyhedra (F2P, 2 × 104 polyhedra), BSA (10 μg/ml), or FGF-2 (F2, 5 ng/ml) for 15 h. For detection of proliferating cells, BrdUrd solution was added to each well at a final concentration of 10 μm, and cells were incubated for an additional hour at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air. BrdUrd-labeled DNA was then detected by using a primary anti-BrdUrd antibody and a secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa 488 fluorescent dye. The labeled cells were analyzed under a fluorescent microscope (A-D) and a phase-contrast microscope (E-H).

The rate of DNA synthesis was evaluated by BrdUrd incorporation (A and B). A, NIH3T3 cells were plated into a 96-well plate at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well and cultured to confluence in DME medium containing 10% FBS. Cells were serum-starved in 0.5% FBS-containing DME medium for 40 h and then incubated with either 10% FBS or the indicated amounts of normal polyhedra (NP) or FGF-2 polyhedra (F2P). B, ATDC5 cells were plated into a 96-well plate at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well and cultured to confluence in DME/F-12 medium containing ITS and 5% FBS. Cells were then serum-starved in 0.5% FBS-containing DME/F-12 medium for 22 h and incubated with BSA (10 μg/ml), FGF-2 (F2, 1 ng/ml), SU5402 (20 μg/ml), or various concentrations of normal or FGF-2 polyhedra.

Shigeno C. Atsumi T. Ishizeki K. Suzuki F. Hiraki Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). However, the nodule formation is strongly inhibited by the application of growth stimuli such as FGF-2 treatment during induction of chondrogenesis (17Shukunami C. Ohta Y. Sakuda M. Hiraki Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). As the nodule formation was easily visualized by Alcian blue staining, we assessed the bioactivity of FGF-2 polyhedra in terms of the formation of Alcian blue-positive cartilage nodules in ATDC5 culture (Fig. 4). Normal polyhedra do not affect the formation of nodules, whereas FGF-2 polyhedra blocked chondrogenic differentiation in a dose-dependent manner. A single addition of rhFGF-2 (1 ng/ml) to the confluent ATDC5 cells resulted in a partial inhibition of differentiation. In contrast, the formation of cartilage nodules was almost completely blocked when rhFGF-2 was added to the culture on every occasion of medium change.FIGURE 4Effects of FGF-2 polyhedra on the differentiation of ATDC5 cells (Alcian blue staining). ATDC5 cells were plated into a 12-well plate at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well and cultured to confluence in DME/F-12 medium containing ITS and 5% FBS. Cells were then incubated with or without normal polyhedra (NP), FGF-2 polyhedra (F2P), BSA (10 μg/ml), or FGF-2 (F2, 1 ng/ml) and maintained in DME/F-12 medium containing ITS and 5% FBS for another 2 weeks to induce chondrogenic differentiation; the culture medium was replaced twice a week. Polyhedra or FGF-2 were added to the confluent cells only once except for the different experimental setting in which cells were treated with FGF-2 (1 ng/ml) at every change of medium. Alcian blue staining of each culture is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further examine the downstream signaling pathways activated by FGF-2 polyhedra, the phosphorylation of P44/P42 MAP kinase was analyzed in both NIH3T3 cells and ATDC5 cells (Fig. 5). The phosphorylated forms of the p44 and p42 MAP kinases were detectable in NIH3T3 cells that had been incubated with 5 ng/ml rhFGF-2 or FGF-2 polyhedra (Fig. 5A). Likewise, phosphorylation of p44/p42 MAP kinases was observed in ATDC5 cells incubated with 5% FBS, 1 ng/ml rhFGF-2, or FGF-2 polyhedra for 30 min (Fig. 5B). In contrast, these phosphorylation events were not evident in cells incubated with normal polyhedra. Moreover, when ATDC5 cells were pretreated with SU5402, the phosphorylation of p44/p42 was found to be efficiently inhibited (Fig. 5B), which is concomitant with the blocked increase in DNA synthesis following exposure of these cells to this agent (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, phosphorylation of p44/p42 in ATDC5 cells incubated with FGF-2 polyhedra could be detected at a higher level even at 12 h after treatment, whereas only low levels of p44/p42 phosphorylation were evident in ATDC5 cells treated with 1 ng/ml FGF-2 (Fig. 5C).FIGURE 5Effects of FGF-2 polyhedra on the phosphorylation of p44/42 MAP kinase in both NIH3T3 and ATDC5 cells.

Seismic imaging can reveal structures associated with key dynamic processes occurring in the upper-mantle wedge above the sinking oceanic slab. Three-dimensional images of reflecting interfaces throughout the upper-mantle wedge above the subducting Tonga slab were obtained by migration of teleseismic recordings of underside P- and S -wave reflections. Laterally continuous weak reflectors with tens of kilometers of topography were detected at depths near 90, 125, 200, 250, 300, 330, 390, 410, and 450 kilometers. P- and S- wave impedances decreased at the 330-kilometer and 450-kilometer reflectors, and S -wave impedance decreased near 200 kilometers in the vicinity of the slab and near 390 kilometers, just above the global 410-kilometer increase. The pervasive seismic reflectivity results from phase transitions and compositional zonation associated with extensive metasomatism involving slab-derived fluids rising through the wedge."

https://openalex.org/W2085997276,"HoxA10 is a homeodomain transcription factor that is frequently overexpressed in human acute myeloid leukemia. In murine bone marrow transplantation studies, HoxA10 overexpression induces a myeloproliferative disorder with accumulation of mature phagocytes in the peripheral blood and tissues. Over time, differentiation block develops in these animals, resulting in acute myeloid leukemia. In immature myeloid cells, HoxA10 represses transcription of some genes that confer the mature phagocyte phenotype. Therefore, overexpressed HoxA10 blocks differentiation by repressing myeloid-specific gene transcription in differentiating myeloid cells. In contrast, target genes involved in myeloproliferation due to HoxA10 overexpression have not been identified. To identify such genes, we screened a CpG island microarray with HoxA10 co-immunoprecipitating chromatin. We identified the DUSP4 gene, which encodes mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 2 (Mkp2), as a HoxA10 target gene. We analyzed the DUSP4 5′-flank and identified two proximal-promoter cis elements that are activated by HoxA10. We find that DUSP4 transcription and Mkp2 expression decrease during normal myelopoiesis. However, this down-regulation is impaired in myeloid cells overexpressing HoxA10. In hematopoietic cells, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (Jnk) are the preferred substrates for Mkp2. Therefore, Mkp2 inhibits apoptosis by dephosphorylating (inactivating) Jnk. Consistent with this, HoxA10 overexpression decreases apoptosis in differentiating myeloid cells. Therefore, our studies identify a mechanism by which overexpressed HoxA10 contributes to inappropriate cell survival during myelopoiesis.

The 39 human and murine HOX genes are arranged in four paralog groups on four different chromosomes These genes encode homeodomain transcription factors that are highly conserved from Drosophila to humans. During embryogenesis, HOX gene transcription is activated 3′ to 5′ with the 3′-most genes regulating cephlad development and the 5′-most genes regulating caudal development (1.Acampora D. D'Esposito M. Faiella A. Pannese M. Migliaccio E. Morelli F. Stornaiuolo A. Nitro V. Simeone A. Boncinelli A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10385-10400Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Transcription of the HOX genes is also tightly regulated during definitive hematopoiesis. Genes 3′ in the locus (HOX1 to -4) are actively transcribed in hematopoietic stem cells, and more 5′ genes (HOX5 to -11) are actively transcribed in lineage-committed progenitors (2.Sauvageau G. Lansdorp P.M. Eaves C.J. Hogge D.E. Dragowska W.H. Reid D.S. Largman C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12223-12227Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Therefore, HOX1 to -4 genes are transcribed in CD34+CD38– cells. In contrast, HOX5 to -11 genes (also referred to as ABD HOX genes) are transcribed throughout the CD34+ compartment and down-regulated in CD34– cells. In poor prognosis AML, the normal decrease in HoxA7, A9, and A10 expression in CD34– cells does not occur (3.Kawagoe H. Humphries R.K. Blair A. Sutherland H.J. Hogge D.E. Leukemia. 1999; 13: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 4.Drabkin H.A. Parsy C. Gerguson K. Guilhot F. Lacotte L. Roy R. Zeng C. Baron A. Hunger S.P. Varella-Garcia M. Gemmill R.

Consistent with this, mice transplanted with bone marrow overexpressing either HoxA9 or HoxA10 rapidly develop a myeloproliferative disorder, which evolves to acute myeloid leukemia over time. This myeloproliferative disorder is characterized by an increase in mature phagocytes in the peripheral blood and tissues. Murine studies also indicate that forced overexpression of HoxA9 or 10 has a common effect of expanding the bone marrow myeloid progenitor pool (5.Calvo K.R. Sykes D.B. Pasillas M. Kamps M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3274-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 6.Lawrence H.J. Helgason C.D. Sauvageau G. Fong S. Izon D.J. Humphries R.K. Largman C.

Blood. 2001; 97: 2286-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In contrast, the effect of HoxA9 and HoxA10 on myeloid differentiation is nonredundant. HoxA9 expression appears to be necessary for acquisition of the myeloid phenotype in normal and leukemic cells (5.Calvo K.R. Sykes D.B. Pasillas M. Kamps M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3274-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In contrast, HoxA10 overexpression is associated with differentiation block in animal studies and in vitro (7.Buske C. Feuring-Buske M. Antonchuk J. Rosten P. Hogge D.E. Eaves C.J. Humphries R.K. Blood. 2001; 97: 2286-2292Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Despite the many elegant studies of the role of Abd HoxA proteins in myelopoiesis and leukemogenesis, relatively few genuine target genes have been identified for these homeodomain transcription factors. To address this issue, initial studies were performed to derive consensus sequences for HoxA protein-DNA binding. These studies identified consensus sequences for DNA binding of Hox-Pbx heterodimers (8.Chang C.P. Brocchieri L. Shen W.F. Largman C. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1734-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Pbx proteins are homeodomain transcription factors that increase the affinity of Hox proteins for DNA-binding sites. Based on the results of these studies, HoxA9 and HoxA10 target genes were identified that encode proteins involved in phagocyte functions. For example, a HoxA9/Pbx1 heterodimer activates homologous cis elements in the genes encoding the respiratory burst oxidase proteins gp91phox and p67phox in differentiating myeloid cells (9.Bei L. Lu Y.F. Eklund E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12359-12370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Additional studies determined that transcription of these two oxidase genes is repressed by interaction of a HoxA10/Pbx1 heterodimer with the same cis elements in undifferentiated myeloid cells (10.Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 11.Eklund E.A. Goldenberg I. Lu Y. Andrejic J. Kakar R. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2005; 175: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a HoxA10/Pbx2 heterodimer activates transcription of the gene encoding β3 integrin in endometrial cells (13.Daftary G.S. Troy P.J. Bagot C.N. Young S.L. Taylor H.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Since β3 integrin is expressed in myeloid cells, these results suggest the possibility that HoxA10 is a multifunction transcription factor during myelopoiesis. In contrast, relatively few target genes that encode proteins involved in regulating cell proliferation or survival have been identified for any Abd HoxA protein. In hematopoietic stem cells and myeloid progenitor cells, these functions are regulated by a variety of different mechanisms. To identify HoxA10 target genes involved in myeloproliferation in differentiating myeloid cells, we coupled chromatin co-immunoprecipitation with high throughput screening of a CpG island microarray (14.Oberley M.J. Farnham P.J. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). By this approach, we identified DUSP4 as a potential HoxA10 target gene in undifferentiated myeloid cells. This gene encodes Dusp4 (dual specific phosphatase 4), also known as Mkp2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 2). Mkp1 and -2 are structurally related proteins that are expressed in hematopoietic cells but have different substrate specificities. In vivo, Mkp2 preferentially dephosphorylates (and therefore inactivates) c-Jun N-terminal kinases 1 and 2 (Jnk1 and -2) but not p38 or extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinases (15.Cadalbert L. Sloss C.M. Cameron P. Plevin R. Cell. Signal. 2005; 17: 1254-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Jnk1 is activated (phosphorylated) in response to genotoxic stress or hematopoietic cytokines and mediates apoptosis in differentiating myeloid cells (16.Yoshizumi M. Abe J. Haendlerer J. Huang Q.

Therefore, if HoxA10 activates DUSP4 transcription, HoxA10 overexpression in myeloid malignancy might increase cell survival during cytokine-induced myelopoiesis. In this study, we investigate the role of HoxA10 in DUSP4 transcription and in regulation of apoptosis. DUSP4 5′-Flank Reporter Constructs−Genomic clones for the DUSP4 5′-flank were obtained by PCR using genomic DNA isolated from U937 cells. The 3′-primer for each of the reactions encompassed +30 to 0 relative to the ATG start codon. A series of 5′-primers were generated to amplify 5′-flank sequences, including –2933 to +30 bp, –1772 to +30 bp, –1722 to +30 bp, –1205 to +30 bp, and –1142 to +30 bp. These genomic sequences were subcloned into the pCATE reporter vector (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX). Clones were completely sequenced on both strands, and the sequence was compared with the NCBI Human Genome Data Base to ensure that no mutations had been introduced. Artificial Promoter Constructs−Artificial promoter/reporter constructs were generated as previously described (10.Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2551-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) (obtained from Dr. A. Kraft (Hollings Cancer Center at the Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC)). Constructs were generated with four copies (in the forward direction) of the –1755 to –1717 bp sequence (referred to as “A”) or the –1174 to –1136 bp sequence (referred to as “B”) from the DUSP4 promoter (p-ADUSP4-TATACAT and BDUSP4-TATACAT, respectively). cDNA Sequences−The cDNA for human HoxA10 was obtained from C. Largman (University of California, San Francisco, CA) (19.Lowney P. Corral J. Detmer K. Le Beau M.M. Deaven L. Lawrence H.J. Largman C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3443-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This cDNA sequence represents the major transcript in mammalian hematopoietic cells, encoding a 393-amino acid, 55-kDa protein (20.Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisajwa J.-I. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K.-I. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type HoxA10 cDNA sequence was subcloned into the pSRα vector for expression in mammalian cells (per the manufacturer’s instructions (Stratagene)). The human Mkp2 cDNA was obtained from Clontech (Mountain View, CA) and subcloned into the pSRα vector for expression in mammalian cells. Plasmids for Short Hairpin RNA (shRNA) 2The abbreviations used are: shRNA, short hairpin RNA; IFNγ, interferon γ; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay(s); CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; Jnk, c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Expression−Plasmids were generated to express shRNA to human Mkp2 using the pLKO.1 vector (kindly provided by Dr. K. Rundell, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL). Oligonucleotide sequences for Mkp2-specific shRNA or scrambled control shRNA were designed with the assistance of the software on the Promega Web site (Promega, Madison, WI). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Core Facility of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center at Northwestern University. Double-stranded, synthetic oligonucleotides were generated representing the –1755 to –1717 bp “A” sequence from the DUSP4 promoter (5′-TAACTCCCTTGCTCTGTGATTAATTCTCACTAACAAGA-3′), the –1174 to –1136 bp “B” sequence from the DUSP4 promoter (5′-CTATAAAACTGATTTAATGGCTTTAGATGAAAATCGATC-3′), or the –94 to –134 bp sequence of the CYBB promoter (5′-ttcagttgaccaatgattattagccaattttctgataaaa-3′). In these oligonucleotides, the HoxA10 core is in boldface type, and the Pbx core is in italic type. The human myelomonocytic cell line U937 (22.Larrick J.W. Anderson S.J. Koren H.S. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 6-14PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from Andrew Kraft. Cells were maintained and differentiated as described (10.Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol.

U937 cells were treated with 500 units/ml human recombinant IFNγ for 24 or 48 h, as indicated (Hoffman-LaRoche). U937 cells were cultured with or without IFNγ for 48 h, as described (10.Eklund E.A.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation and CpG island microarray hybridization were performed as described (14.Oberley M.J. Farnham P.J. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with formaldehyde and lysed, and lysates were sonicated to generate chromatin fragments with an average size of 2.0 kb. Lysates were precipitated with HoxA10 antiserum (Covance) or control preimmune serum. Chromatin was recovered by precipitation, proteins were stripped from the chromatin, and the chromatin was PCR-amplified. Several batches of immunoprecipitated, amplified chromatin were combined for each experiment. Aliquots of HoxA10-specific and preimmune serum control-precipitated, amplified chromatin were labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 by the random primer method. Labeled DNA was used to probe a CpG island microarray, as described (14.Oberley M.J. Farnham P.J. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). CpG island microarrays were obtained from the Microarray Center, University Health Network (Ontario Cancer Institute, Ontario, Canada). “Spots” with 3-fold enhancement in HoxA10-specific versus control preimmune serum-precipitated chromatin in three independent hybridization experiments were further considered. Dye swapping experiments were performed as controls for differences in efficiency in incorporation of Cy3 versus Cy5 into DNA. Arrays were scanned using an Agilent microarray scanner (G2565BA, Wilmington, DE), and feature intensity statistics were extracted using GenePix (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA). The GenBank™ accession number from the array was used to search the NCBI human genome data base for adjacent genes. Specificity of chromatin immunoprecipitation was confirmed by independent chromatin immunoprecipitation with HoxA10-specific antiserum or preimmune serum control. Precipitated chromatin was PCR-amplified with overlapping primer sets that were designed to encompass the proximal 4 kb of 5′-flank sequences, based on location of the CpG island (–1734 to –2025 bp relative to the ATG start codon). Primer sets were designed to amplify –2025 to +30 bp or –2025 to –3613 bp. Nuclear extract proteins were prepared by the method of Dignam (24.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 11: 1475-1479Crossref Scopus (9150) Google Scholar) with protease inhibitors (as described) (10.Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides probes were prepared, and EMSA and antibody supershift assays were performed, as described (10.Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 12.Lindsey S. Zhu C. Lu Y.F. Eklund E.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For all experiments, at least three independent batches of nuclear proteins were tested in at least two independent experiments. Integrity of the nuclear proteins and equality of protein loading was determined in control EMSA with a classical CCAAT box from the α globin gene promoter. Antiserum to HoxA10 (not cross-reactive with other Hox proteins) was obtained from Covance Research Products (Richmond, CA) and from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies to Pbx1 and Pbx2 (not cross-reactive with each other or other Pbx proteins) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. All EMSA were performed several times with at least two different batches of nuclear proteins, and representative data are shown. Reporter Gene Assays−Cells were transfected by electroporation as described (10.Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 12.Lindsey S. Zhu C. Lu Y.F. Eklund E.A. J.

U937 cells (32 × 106 cells/sample) were transfected with 70 μg of reporter plasmid with various truncations of the DUSP4 5′-flank (or empty vector control), 50 μg of HoxA10/pSRα or control pSRα, and 15 μg of p-CMVβ-gal (to normalize for transfection efficiency). In other experiments, cells were transfected with p-TATACAT, ADUSP4-TATACAT, or BDUSP4-TATACAT minimal promoter reporter vectors, 50 μg of HoxA10/pSRα or control pSRα, and 15 μg of p-CMVβ-gal (to normalize for transfection efficiency). Transfectants were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, with and without IFNγ (500 units/ml). Preparation of cell extracts, β-galactosidase, and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assays were performed as described (10.Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 12.Lindsey S. Zhu C. Lu Y.F. Eklund E.A. J.

Stable Transfectants−Stable U937 transfectants were generated with pSRα vectors to overexpress HoxA10, Mkp2, or empty vector control. Stable transfectants were selected in G418, as previously described (10.Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). At least three transfectant pools were tested for each construct. In some experiments, U937 cells were transfected with PLKO.1 vectors to express shRNA for Mkp2 or scrambled shRNA control and selected with puromycin. Total cell lysate proteins from U937 cells or U937 stable transfectants (50 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blots were serially probed with antibodies to various proteins. Antibodies to tubulin, HoxA10, Jnk1, and phospho-Jnk were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Each experiment was performed several times, and representative blots are shown. In some experiments, RNA was isolated from U937 cells using the Triazol reagent, according to manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen). RNA was tested by denaturing gel electrophoresis to determine the integrity of the 18 and 28 S ribosomal bands. Primers were designed with the software from Integrated DNA Technologies, and real time PCR was performed using SYBR green according to the “standard curve” method. Results were normalized to 18 S and actin to control for RNA abundance in various samples. In other experiments, chromatin co-immunoprecipitating from U937 cells with antibody to HoxA10, anti-acetyl-histone 3, or control preimmune serum was analyzed by real time PCR. Primers were designed to amplify ∼80 bp centered around the A and B HoxA10 DNA-binding consensus sequences using the Integrated DNA Technologies software, as above. Results were normalized to PCR product abundance in nonprecipitated, total chromatin samples. Experiments were performed in triplicate for each of three different immunoprecipitation experiments. Annexin V/propidium iodide (Beckman) double staining was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cells were washed with ice-cold culture medium, adjusted to a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml, and incubated with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate solution (2.5 μg/ml) and propidium iodide (12.5 μg/ml) on ice for 15 min, and cell preparations were analyzed on a BD Biosciences FACScan flow cytometer. Statistical significance of comparisons between two groups was determined by Student's t test. Statistical significance of comparisons between larger groups was determined using analysis of variance. Statistical calculations were performed using the SigmaPlot and SigmaStat software. HoxA10 Interacts with the DUSP4 Promoter in Vitro and in Vivo−HoxA10 target genes were identified by chromatin co-immunoprecipitation from U937 myeloid leukemia cells. This myeloid cell line undergoes differentiation in response to various cytokines, including IFNγ (22.Larrick J.W. Anderson S.J. Koren H.S. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 6-14PubMed Google Scholar). U937 differentiation is characterized by acquisition of mature phagocyte characteristics, including respiratory burst activity and phagocytosis (10.Eklund E.A. Jalava A. Kakar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20117-20126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 12.Lindsey S. Zhu C. Lu Y.F. Eklund E.A. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22.Larrick J.W. Anderson S.J. Koren H.S. J. Immunol. 1980; 125: 6-14PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Levy R. Rotrosen D. Nagauker O. Leto T.L. Malech H.L. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 2595-2601PubMed Google Scholar). Differentiation is also characterized by cell cycle arrest within 24 h and programmed cell death over 72 h. Therefore, this cell line provides a reasonable model of the events of myelopoiesis. For these studies, U937 cells were treated with formaldehyde to generate in vivo DNA-protein cross-links, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antiserum to HoxA10 or control preimmune serum. Prior to immunoprecipitation, the lysates were sonicated to generate 2.0-kb chromatin fragments (14.Oberley M.J. Farnham P.J. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Precipitated chromatin was labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 and used to hybridize a human CpG island microarray, as described (14.Oberley M.J. Farnham P.J. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Triplicate array experiments were performed (with independent co-precipitations), and only “spots” with at least 3-fold enhancement in all three were further considered. One of the identified CpG islands localized to chromosome 8 in the 5′-flank of the DUSP4 gene (Fig. 1A; location of the CpG island is –2025 to –1734 bp relative to the ATG start codon). This gene encodes dual specific phosphatase 4, also known as Mkp2 (mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 2). This result was of considerable interest, since Mkp2 has been implicated in regulating apoptosis in myeloid cells via inactivation (dephosphorylation) of proapoptotic Jnk proteins (14.Oberley M.J. Farnham P.J. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Since co-precipitating DNA was sheared to generate 2.0-kb fragments, the location of the CpG island (∼–2.0 kb) indicated that the HoxA10 binding site(s) should be within the proximal 4.0 kb of the DUSP4 5′-flank. Therefore, we performed initial experiments to verify interaction of HoxA10 with the DUSP4 5′-flank and to locate the binding site within either the proximal –2.0 kb of the 5′-flank or between –2.0 and –4.0 kb. To determine the impact of differentiation stage on HoxA10-binding, chromatin was co-immunoprecipitated from U937 cells with and without 48 h of IFNγ differentiation. Precipitating chromatin was amplified by PCR, separated by acrylamide gel electrophoresis, and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Two primer sets were used to amplify fragments from –2025 bp to +30 bp (relative to the ATG) or from –2025 to –3613 bp. For these experiments, nonprecipitated chromatin was a positive control, and chromatin co-precipitating with preimmune serum was a negative control. We found specific amplification of HoxA10 co-precipitating chromatin with the proximal primer set (Fig. 1B). Although not quantitative, these studies also suggested that HoxA10 interaction with the DUSP4 5′-flank decreased during U937 differentiation. In contrast, HoxA10 antibody did not co-precipitate chromatin with the more distal 5′-flank sequence (not shown). The results of these chromatin immunoprecipitation studies suggest that HoxA10 interacts with a binding site within the proximal 2.0 kb of DUSP4 5′-flank in vivo. Therefore, we analyzed this 2.0-kb sequence to determine if it contained any HoxA10 DNA-binding consensus sequences. This analysis resulted in identification of two sequences that conform to the derived consensus for DNA binding of HoxA10-Pbx heterodimers. These sequences were found at –1731 to –1738 bp (referred to as “A”) and –1158 to –1166 bp (referred to as “B”) relative to the ATG start codon in the DUSP4 5′-flank (Fig. 1C). These results provided initial evidence in support of our hypothesis that DUSP4 is a HoxA10 target gene. Therefore, we performed additional experiments to determine the impact on Mkp2 expression of myeloid differentiation and HoxA10 overexpression. Mkp2 Expression Is Decreased by Differentiation and Increased by HoxA10 Overexpression in Myeloid Cells−Mkp2 is expressed in myeloid cells, but differentiation stage-specific regulation of Mkp2 expression has not been previously investigated (14.Oberley M.J. Farnham P.J. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 371: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Differentiation of U937 cells is associated with increased Jnk activation (phosphorylation) and Jnk-induced apoptosis. Since Mkp2 dephosphorylates Jnk, one might anticipate a decrease in Mkp2 expression as differentiation proceeds. Therefore, we initially investigated the impact of IFNγ differentiation on Mkp2 mRNA abundance in U937 cells. For these studies, expression was analyzed by real time PCR using RNA isolated from U937 cells over a 72-h period of differentiation. We found that Mkp2 mRNA abundance in U937 cells decreased significantly after 24 h of IFNγ treatment but did not decrease further between 24 and 72 h post-IFNγ (F = 0.40, p = 0.68, n = 4) (Fig. 2A). Based on these results, we investigated the impact of U937 differentiation and HoxA10 overexpression on Mkp2 protein abundance. For these studies, stable U937 transfectant pools were generated with a vector to overexpress HoxA10 or empty control vector. Transfectants were analyzed with and without IFNγ differentiation. Three independent transfectant pools were selected, and the results of representative experiments are presented. Western blots of total cell lysates were serially probed with antibodies to Mkp2, HoxA10 (to verify overexpression), Jnk and phospho-Jnk (as a downstream Mkp2 target), and tubulin (as a loading"
https://openalex.org/W2082543680,"Dendritic cells (DCs) and natural killer (NK) cells are essential components of the innate immunity and play a critical role in the first phase of host defense against infection. Interactions between DCs and NK cells have been demonstrated in a variety of settings, with evidence emerging of complex bidirectional crosstalk between the two cell types. The accessory HIV-1 Nef protein is a crucial determinant for viral replication and pathogenesis. We previously demonstrated that Nef, hijacking DC functional activity, subverts the DC arm of immune response to escape the adaptive immune attack. Here, we monitor the effect of Nef on the outcome of the innate immune response, focusing on the impact of Nef on DC/NK crosstalk. We demonstrate that Nef up-regulates the ability of DCs to stimulate the immunoregulatory NK cells (CD56(bright)) as assessed by the activated phenotype, up-regulation of their proliferative response and INF-gamma release. On the other hand, Nef-pulsed DCs inhibit cytotoxic NK cells (CD56(dim)), as assessed by the reduced HLA-DR surface expression, reduced proliferation and cytotoxic activity. Moreover, in the presence of Nef-pulsed DCs, we found a significant up-regulation of TNF-alpha secretion and a significant reduction of IL-10, GM-CSF, MIP-1alpha and RANTES secretion. Our findings suggest that the Nef-induced dysregulation in the DC/NK cell crosstalk may represent a potential mechanism through which HIV escapes innate immune surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W2092016944,"The specificity of thrombin for procoagulant and anticoagulant substrates is regulated allosterically by Na+. Ordered cleavage of prothrombin (ProT) at Arg320 by the prothrombinase complex generates proteolytically active, meizothrombin (MzT), followed by cleavage at Arg271 to produce thrombin and fragment 1.2. The alternative pathway of initial cleavage at Arg271 produces the inactive zymogen form, the prethrombin 2 (Pre 2)·fragment 1.2 complex, which is cleaved subsequently at Arg320. Cleavage at Arg320 of ProT or prethrombin 1 (Pre 1) activates the catalytic site and the precursor form of exosite I (proexosite I). To determine the pathway of expression of Na+-(pro)exosite I linkage during ProT activation, the effects of Na+ on the affinity of fluorescein-labeled hirudin-(54–65) ([5F]Hir-(54–65)(SO–3)) for the zymogens, ProT, Pre 1, and Pre 2, and for the proteinases, MzT and MzT-desfragment 1 (MzT(–F1)) were quantitated. The zymogens showed no significant linkage between proexosite I and Na+, whereas cleavage at Arg320 caused the affinities of MzT and MzT(–F1) for [5F]Hir-(54–65)(SO–3) to be enhanced by Na+ 8- to 10-fold and 5- to 6-fold, respectively. MzT and MzT(–F1) showed kinetically different mechanisms of Na+ enhancement of chromogenic substrate hydrolysis. The results demonstrate for the first time that MzT is regulated allosterically by Na+. The results suggest that the distinctive procoagulant substrate specificity of MzT, in activating factor V and factor VIII on membranes, and the anticoagulant, membrane-modulated activation of protein C by MzT bound to thrombomodulin are regulated by Na+-induced allosteric transition. Further, the Na+ enhancement in MzT activity and exosite I affinity may function in directing the sequential ProT activation pathway by accelerating thrombin formation from the MzT fast form.

In the absence of factor Va, the alternative, slower pathway of bond cleavage predominates, in which initial cleavage at Arg271 forms the inactive intermediate prethrombin 2 (Pre 2), bound noncovalently to fragment 1.2, followed by cleavage at Arg320 to form thrombin. Recent studies of the sequential pathway of ProT activation indicate that substrates are bound to prothrombinase in two alternate conformations that present the two peptide bonds sequentially to factor Xa for cleavage (7.Krishnaswamy S.

On conversion of ProT to thrombin, two electropositive surface sites, exosites I and II, become expressed on thrombin, which provide recognition sites for specific physiological substrates, inhibitors, and regulatory molecules (7.Krishnaswamy S.

Exosite I mediates fibrinogen and protease-activated receptor-1 and -4 substrate interactions, fibrin binding, and binding of the COOH-terminal hirudin-(54–65)-peptide (Hir-(54–65) (SO–3)). Exosite II binds heparin and the fragment 2 domain of ProT. Both exosites are involved in factor V and VIII activation, glycoprotein Ib binding, thrombomodulin binding, and inactivation of thrombin by heparin cofactor II (15.Page M.J. Macgillivray R.T.

The substrate specificity of MzT is different from that of thrombin, in that it exhibits ≤10% activity toward fibrinogen and ≤2% activity in activating platelets (19.Doyle M.F. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

MzT, however, is a potent procoagulant activator of factor V and factor VIII in reactions that are dependent on phospholipid membranes (21.Tans G. Nicolaes G.A. Thomassen M.C.

MzT bound to thrombomodulin activates the anticoagulant, protein C, at a rate equal to or greater than thrombin. Protein C activation by thrombomodulin-bound MzT is also stimulated by membranes (19.Doyle M.F. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

Binding of Na+ converts thrombin from a “slow” to a “fast” form (25.Wells C.M. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11721-11730Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The fast form has higher catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for the procoagulant substrates, fibrinogen and protease-activated receptor-1, greater reactivity toward antithrombin, and increased amidolytic chromogenic substrate activity, notably toward d-Phe-Pro-Arg-pNA (15.Page M.J.

Comparison of these structures with those of thrombin, either inactivated with the transition state analog, d-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl (FPR-CH2Cl), or in which exosite I is occupied by the COOH-terminal hirudin peptide, hirugen (hirudin-(53–64)), shows that thrombin adopts the fast conformation in these complexes (27.Pineda A.O.

Previous studies of exosite I expression on ProT activation intermediates characterized a precursor form of exosite I on ProT (proexosite I), with a ∼100-fold lower affinity for the model exosite I-specific ligand Hir-(54–65)(SO–3) (34.Anderson P.J.

Removal of fragment 1 from ProT to form prethrombin 1 (Pre 1) is accompanied by a ∼7-fold increase in proexosite I affinity (35.Anderson P.J. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44489-44495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The further 11- to 20-fold increase in affinity, representing full exosite I expression, occurs in concert with expression of catalytic activity during formation of MzT and thrombin (35.Anderson P.J.

Quantitative analysis of binding of the ProT activation fragments 2 and 1.2 to exosite II on Pre 2 and thrombin indicates that this exosite becomes unmasked upon cleavage at Arg271 and subsequent dissociation of the fragments (35.Anderson P.J. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44489-44495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 36.Anderson P.J. Nesset A. Bock P.E. J. Biol.

How linkage between the Na+ site and (pro)exosite I is expressed during ProT activation has not been investigated. In the present studies, fluorescein-labeled Hir-(54–65)(SO–3) ([5F]Hir-(54–65)(SO–3)) was used as a (pro)exosite I-specific probe to examine the linkage between Na+ binding and (pro)exosite I affinity (34.Anderson P.J.

The goal was to determine if Na+ regulates the affinity of proexosite I for ProT, Pre 1, and Pre 2 zymogen forms, and the catalytically active intermediates of ProT and Pre 1 activation, MzT and meizothrombin desfragment 1 (MzT(–F1)), respectively. The results demonstrate no significant effect of Na+ on ProT, Pre 1, or Pre 2 proexosite I affinity for [5F]Hir-(54–65)(SO–3). Allosteric linkage between Na+ binding and exosite I affinity occurred concomitantly with activation to MzT and MzT(–F1). The Na+ enhancement of the rate of chromogenic substrate hydrolysis for MzT compared with MzT(–F1) and thrombin, however, followed a kinetically different mechanism. The results demonstrate for the first time that MzT and MzT(–F1) are allosterically regulated by Na+-exosite I interactions, suggesting that the unique substrate specificity of MzT may be Na+-regulated. Protein and Peptide Purification and Characterization−Human ProT, factor Xa, and thrombin were purified and characterized as described previously (38.Bock P.E. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1989; 273: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Pre 1 was purified from products of ProT cleavage by thrombin (38.Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14963-14973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FPR-MzT(–F1) was prepared by activation of 20 μm Pre 1 with 2 units/ml (based on the manufacturer’s specifications) of purified ecarin from Echis carinatus venom (Sigma) in the presence of a 10-fold excess of FPR-CH2Cl (40.Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14974-14981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FPR-MzT was prepared from ProT at the same reactant concentrations followed by chromatography on Resource Q (Amersham Biosciences) in 20 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0. The column was washed with 10 ml of equilibration buffer and eluted with a 50-ml NaCl gradient in the same buffer up to 0.5 m to remove ecarin. Pre 2 was purified from factor Xa-ProT activation reactions as described (36.Anderson P.J. Nesset A. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44482-44488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The R155A substitution mutant of ProT (ProTR155A) was prepared as described (21.Tans G. Nicolaes G.A.

Protein concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm using the following absorption coefficients ((mg/ml)–1cm–1) and molecular weights (Mr) (4.Krishnaswamy S. Church W.R. Nesheim M.E.

[5F]Hir-(54–65)(SO–3) was prepared as described previously (37.Bock P.E. Olson S.T. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19837-19845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Titrations−Binding of [5F]Hir-(54–65)(SO–3) was measured by titrating the labeled peptide with the protein of interest and monitoring the change in fluorescence at 520 nm with excitation at 491 nm (4 or 8 nm band passes), using acrylic cuvettes coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) 20,000. Fluorescence changes expressed as (Fobs – Fo)/Fo =ΔF/Fo, as a function of total protein concentration were fit by the quadratic binding equation to obtain the maximum fluorescence change ((Fmax – Fo)/Fo =ΔFmax/Fo), and the dissociation constant (KD), with the stoichiometric factor fixed at 1 (37.Bock P.E. Olson S.T. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19837-19845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were corrected for background signal by subtraction of a buffer blank, and for dilution, which was not more than 10%. Exosite Linkage Analysis−The effect of Na+ on binding of [5F]Hir-(54–65)(SO–3) to (pro)exosite I was characterized in fluorescence titrations with ProT species in 50 mm Tris-Cl, 110 mm NaCl or 110 mm choline chloride (ChCl), 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mg/ml PEG 8000, pH 7.4, at 25 °C. Linkage between Na+ and [5F]Hir-(54–65)(SO–3) (H) binding to thrombin, MzT(–F1), and MzT (designated P) was analyzed according to the thermodynamic cycle in Scheme 1, where Na+ binding affects the affinity of peptide binding and vice versa. Because of the relatively small differences in fluorescence between titrations in NaCl and ChCl, it was not possible to determine accurately the dissociation constant for Na+ binding from the Na+ concentration dependence at a fixed thrombin concentration. Titrations in 110 mm NaCl and 110 mm ChCl were fit independently by the quadratic binding equation to obtain the maximum fluorescence change ΔFmax, P·H/Fo and KH, Ch from the titration in ChCl, and ΔFmax, P·Na·H/Fo and KH, Na from the titration in the presence of NaCl. Kinetic and End Point Fluorescence Titrations−To quantitate the effects of Na+ on binding of [5F]Hir-(54–65)(SO–3) to exosite I on active MzT(–F1) and MzTR155A, it was necessary to employ a kinetic approach to separate the ecarin-catalyzed formation of MzT(–F1) and MzTR155A from slower autocatalytic cleavages that process the products further (43.Petrovan R.J. Govers-Riemslag J.W. Nowak G. Hemker H.C. Tans G. Rosing J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed for Pre 1 by measuring Fo for 20 nm [5F]Hir-(54–65)(SO–3), the instantaneous decrease in fluorescence on addition of Pre 1 due to peptide binding to (pro)exosite I, and the time dependence of the subsequent fluorescence decrease initiated by addition of 2 units/ml of ecarin. The ecarin-initiated fluorescence time courses were fit by the sum of a single exponential decay and a straight line to determine the fluorescence end point corrected for any slow linear drift, and the results were expressed as ΔF/Fo. For analysis of the progress curves, the integrated Michaelis-Menten equation was used to represent the ecarin (E)-catalyzed conversion of Pre 1 or ProTR155A (C) into MzT(–F1) or MzTR155A (P), respectively (Scheme 2). Comparison of this analysis with the integrated rate equation including competitive product inhibition showed no evidence for product inhibition with MzT(–F1), whereas including product inhibition for MzTR155A improved the fit modestly. Under the experimental conditions used, the fluorescence change accompanying peptide (H) binding is not a linear function of the concentration of P or C. Moreover, these species compete for the peptide, and binding is accompanied by unequal fluorescence changes for the P·H and C·H complexes (Scheme 3). To analyze the time courses, the cubic competitive binding equation derived previously for Scheme 3 (44.Dharmawardana K.R. Olson S.T. Bock P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18635-18643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) in combination with the integrated Michaelis-Menten equation was used for nonlinear least-squares fitting. Fluorescence versus time data, collected as a function of the concentration of C (Pre 1) in NaCl- or ChCl-containing buffers, were analyzed with the parameters determined independently for H ([5F]Hir-(54–65)(SO–3)) binding to C (Pre 1) fixed. The fitted parameters were the maximum fluorescence change for the MzT(–F1)·[5F]Hir-(54–65)(SO–3) complex (ΔFmax, P·H/Fo), KP·H, Km, and Vmax. The fluorescence and binding parameters determined from this analysis were compared with those obtained by fitting of the quadratic binding equation to the reaction end points as a function of C (Pre 1) concentration determined in a model-independent manner by the exponential fit described above. The same approaches were used in kinetic and end point titrations of the activation of ProTR155A to MzTR155A by ecarin and FPR-MzT(–F1) from activation of Pre 1 in the presence of 24 μm FPR-CH2Cl. The presence of 20 nm [5F]Hir-(54–65)(SO–3) in these reactions did not influence the results, because ≤6% of the total Pre 1 or ProTR155A was bound at any time, over the protein concentration range studied. Pre 1 Activation Assay−Assays specific for MzT(–F1) were performed by modifications of the published methods (2.Rosing J. Zwaal R.F. Tans G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4224-4228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Tans G. Janssen-Claessen T. Hemker H.C. Zwaal R.F. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21864-21873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This approach enables differential measurement of thrombin and MzT(–F1) based on the much faster rate of thrombin inactivation by antithrombin·heparin complex compared with MzT(–F1). Aliquots of activation reactions of Pre 1 in the buffers containing NaCl or ChCl initiated at 25 °C by addition of ecarin were quenched by dilution to 10 nm Pre 1 in 250 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 75 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml PEG 8000, pH 7.70 (for NaCl reactions) or 250 mm Hepes, 590 mm NaCl, 75 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml PEG 8000, pH 7.65 (for ChCl reactions) containing 50 nm antithrombin and 18 μg/ml heparin (Sigma) for exactly 30 s. An aliquot of the quenched reaction was diluted 10-fold in 50 mm Hepes, 125 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml PEG 8000, pH 7.4, containing 100 μm d-Phe-Pip-Arg-pNA, and the initial rate of chromogenic substrate hydrolysis was measured from the linear increase in absorbance at 405 nm. Thrombin was confirmed to be >99.9% inactivated during the 30-s quenching time. To correct for the differences in kinetic parameters of thrombin and MzT(–F1) and the small loss of MzT(–F1) during quenching, the rates obtained for Pre 1 fully activated by incubation with 2 units/ml ecarin for 60 min were measured as a function of time after quenching, relative to an equivalent concentration of thrombin. Extrapolation of the slow, linear decrease in MzT(–F1) activity with time due to antithrombin·heparin inactivation and possible autocatalytic thrombin formation to zero time was taken to represent the total MzT(–F1) concentration. The extrapolated chromogenic substrate activity of MzT(–F1) relative to thrombin was determined to be 1.21 and 1.23 in the NaCl and ChCl experiments, respectively, and the correction for loss of MzT(–F1) activity was 10 and 6% in the NaCl and ChCl experiments, respectively. Na+ Dependence of Chromogenic Substrate Hydrolysis−Initial rates of hydrolysis of 200 μm (saturating) d-Phe-Pip-Arg-pNA were measured at 25 °C as a function of Na+ concentration using mixtures of buffers containing 110 mm NaCl or ChCl. These experiments measured the Na+ dependence of kcat, reflecting Na+ binding to the enzyme·substrate complex. The initial rates at zero and saturating Na+ concentration, and the apparent KD for Na+ binding were obtained by least-squares fitting of the hyperbolic titrations. To estimate the affinities of Na+ for the free enzymes, kcat, Km, and Ki for product were determined by full progress curve analysis of d-Phe-Pip-Arg-pNA hydrolysis as a function of Na+ concentration (45.Di Cera E. Hopfner K.P. Dang Q.D. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 174-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Five progress curves at 5–15 μm substrate were fit simultaneously to obtain the kinetic parameters. The KD for Na+ binding to thrombin and MzT(–F1) was obtained by fitting the hyperbolic dependence of kcat/Km on Na+ concentration (45.Di Cera E. Hopfner K.P. Dang Q.D. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 174-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the case of MzTR155A for which this was not possible, an estimate of the KD for Na+ binding to the free enzyme was obtained from the dependence of the observed Km (Km,obs) on Na+ concentration, where Km was assumed to be equivalent to the dissociation constant for substrate binding.

https://openalex.org/W2054584544,"We have determined the thermodynamics of binding for the interaction between TEM-1 β-lactamase and a set of alanine substituted contact residue mutants ofβ-lactamase-inhibitory protein (BLIP) using isothermal titration calorimetry. The binding enthalpies for these interactions are highly temperature dependent, with negative binding heat capacity changes ranging from -800 to -271 cal mol-1 K-1. The isoenthalpic temperatures (at which the binding enthalpy is zero) of these interactions range from 5 to 38 °C. The changes in isoenthalpic temperature were used as an indicator of the changes in enthalpy and entropy driving forces, which in turn are related to hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions. A contact residue of BLIP is categorized as a canonical residue if its alanine substitution mutant exhibits a change of isoenthalpic temperature matching the change of hydrophobicity because of the mutation. A contact position exhibiting a change in isoenthalpic temperature that does not match the change in hydrophobicity is categorized as an anti-canonical residue. Our experimental results reveal that the majority of residues where alanine substitution results in a loss of affinity are canonical (7 of 10), and about half of the residues where alanine substitutions have a minor effect are canonical. The interactions between TEM-1β-lactamase and BLIP canonical contact residues contribute directly to binding free energy, suggesting potential anchoring sites for binding partners. The anti-canonical behavior of certain residues may be the result of mutation-induced modifications such as structural rearrangements affecting contact residue configurations. Structural inspection of BLIP suggests that the Lys74 side chain electrostatically holds BLIP loop 2 in position to bind to TEM-1 β-lactamase, explaining a large loss of entropy-driven binding energy of the K74A mutant and the resulting anti-canonical behavior. The anti-canonical behavior of the W150A mutant may also be due to structural rearrangements. Finally, the affinity enhancing effect of the contact residue mutant Y50A may be due to energetic coupling interactions between Asp49 and His41.

Protein-protein interactions are critical for any living organism. Their roles are vital in most biological processes, including metabolism, immune responses, signal transduction, gene regulation, and enzymatic regulation. Most noncovalent protein-protein interactions involve many contacts and interactions, which in turn combine into a macromolecular binding interaction with the needed specificity and affinity. Understanding the principles behind the affinities and specificities of protein-protein interactions will provide leads in developing new methods and reagents for protein-protein interactions. Recent advances in the structural biology of protein-protein interactions have revealed the complexity of structure-function relationships (1Nooren I.M. Thornton J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3486-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). In general, a protein-protein binding interaction involves a relatively planar interface with a large contact interface area (typically >1000 Å2) and a large number of contact residues (>10) (2Janin J. Proteins. 1995; 21: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 3Lo Conte L. Chothia C. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 2177-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar, 4Nooren I.M. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 991-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). With a maximal contribution of 120 cal/(mol Å2), the typical interaction strength of -13 kcal/mol is only a fraction of the maximum available (5Brooijmans N. Sharp K.A. Kuntz I.D. Proteins. 2002; 48: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). One major consistent observation of many studies is the presence of so-called “hotspots” in protein-protein interactions (6Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8509-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 7Schreiber G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 478-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 8Zhang Z. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45706-45712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 9Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar). Among all of the contact residues, only a small subset (called hotspot residues) contributes the majority of the binding free energy (9Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar). The alanine substitution of any of these hotspot contact residues results in a significant loss of binding free energy, whereas the alanine substitution of other contact residues does not change the binding free energy. Based on simple physical considerations, the side chain of a contact residue could contribute to the binding energy of a complex either directly or indirectly or in both ways (10Bogan A.A. Thorn K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar, 11Chothia C. Janin J. Nature. 1975; 256: 705-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar, 12Sundberg E.J. Mariuzza R.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 2002; 61: 119-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Direct contributions are the result of the favorable interactions between the side chain and the interacting protein partner. Indirect contributions result from the enhancement by the contact residue to other contact residues (energetic coupling) and/or the alteration of contact interactions due to structural rearrangements. With limited structural and binding information, predicting the direct and indirect contributions from a contact residue is difficult. In this study, the binding thermodynamics (binding enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity change in addition to binding free energy) of alanine substitutions of contact residues was determined to assess how individual contact residue contribute to the final binding free energy. The binding thermodynamics of the mutants not only describe the changes in binding affinity but also changes in the nature of the driving forces of binding (13Stites W.E. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 1233-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). For instance, a mutation that decreases the binding free energy could do so either via changes in the enthalpy or entropy driving forces or a combination of both. For residues in which side chains contribute directly to binding through interaction with the target protein, the changes in binding thermodynamics should approximately correlate with the expected changes in the physiochemical nature of mutation (e.g. a polar to nonpolar mutation should increase entropy driving forces). We have categorized the contact residues with mutations that exhibit this correlation as canonical residues. For residues that make an indirect contribution to binding, the thermodynamics may not correlate with the physiochemical nature of the mutation. For example, an alanine substitution that decreases residue hydrophicity but exhibits changes in the enthalpy rather than the entropy driving forces may be the result of a change in the positioning of a neighboring polar residue due to the mutation of the residue under study. These contact residues are categorized as anti-canonical. The scenario of the structural rearrangement can be established with detailed structural information. The analysis of thermodynamic and structural information could provide detailed information of the role of interface residues for binding interactions, and this information could be used in the future design of tight binding peptides or small molecules that could serve as inhibitors of β-lactamase. β-Lactam-based antibiotics specifically inactivate glycopeptide transpeptidases to prevent the formation of bacterial cell walls thereby leading to the lysis of the bacteria. This group of antibiotics is currently among the most widely used antimicrobial therapeutics. β-Lactamases provide for resistance to these antibiotics by selectively cleaving the amide bond in the β-lactam ring. There are four major classes of β-lactamases (A–D) (14Bush K. Jacoby G.A. Medeiros A.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar). Class A β-lactamases are prevalent in the clinical setting and confer infectious bacteria with resistance to β-lactam-based antibiotics. Among the class A β-lactamases, TEM-1 β-lactamase is the most prevalent among Gram-negative bacteria and has been a subject of concern because of its ability to hydrolyze a range of β-lactam-based antibiotics (15Majiduddin F.K. Materon I.C. Palzkill T.G. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2002; 292: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). BLIP 2The abbreviations used are: BLIP, β-lactamase-inhibitory protein; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry/calorimeter/calorimetric. is a 165-amino acid protein produced by the soil bacterium Streptomyces clavuligerus, which potently inhibits the TEM-1 β-lactamase (16Doran J.L. Leskiw B.K. Aippersbach S. Jensen S.E. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4909-4918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BLIP has a tandem repeat structure of a 76-amino acid αβ domain (17Strynadka N.C. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These two tandem domains form a β-saddle with a relatively hydrophobic concave surface. The saddle-like concave surface of BLIP binds on the loop-helix region of TEM-1 and extends two loops around the edge of the loop-helix section into the substrate binding pocket of the TEM-1. The Asp49 residue of BLIP on one of the loops (loop 1) occupies the catalytic site of TEM-1 β-lactamase (17Strynadka N.C. Jensen S.E. Alzari P.M. James M.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The BLIP system is a protein-protein interaction model for which a relatively complete set of data of alanine-scanning experiments exists (18Zhang Z. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42860-42866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Alanine-scanning analysis has revealed that: 1) there are two hotspots on the interacting surface of BLIP, and 2) one mutation (Y50A) actually increases binding affinity for TEM-1 β-lactamase by 50-fold (8Zhang Z. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45706-45712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Several weak binding peptide inhibitors for TEM-1 have been generated, among which two are the TEM-1-contacting fragments of BLIP (19Rudgers G.W. Palzkill T. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 20Rudgers G.W. Huang W. Palzkill T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 3279-3286Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The contacts of these peptides potentially can be strengthened to create tight binding inhibitors with appropriate enhancement of binding forces. This study provides a detailed thermodynamic characterization of the interactions between TEM-1 β-lactamase and the BLIP alanine-scanning mutants. The measurements and analysis have categorized the BLIP contact residues into four types: canonical hotspot, canonical non-hotspot, anti-canonical hotspot, or anti-canonical non-hotspot residues. The information generated here provides insight into the determinants of molecular recognition between BLIP and β-lactamase that should be useful in the design of BLIP derivatives with altered binding specificity. Materials—Talon resin was purchased from Clontech (Mountain View, CA). Ion exchange media and columns (Mono Q 5/50 GL, HighTrap Q, Q Sepharose Fast Flow) and sizing columns (Superdex 75 10/300, Superdex 75 prep grade) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. All other reagents are reagent grade from Sigma. Protein Expression and Purification—All expression DNA clones were constructed previously (8Zhang Z. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45706-45712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and the proteins were expressed and purified using a previously described procedure with minor modifications. Briefly, Escherichia coli bacteria (strain RB791) containing BLIP mutant expression plasmid were grown in LB medium containing 17.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C from a single clone and induced with 2 mm lactose and 1% glycerol instead of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the A600 nm was ∼1.2. The culture was incubated at room temperature for 6 h and harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 6 °C. The bacterial pellets were resuspended in bacterial protein extraction solution (B-PER, Pierce) or a prepared equivalent (1% Triton-X 100 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) at a ratio of 15 ml/1 g of bacterial pellet. The resuspensions were vigorously shaken for 20 min at room temperature and then centrifuged at high speed (15,000 rpm in a Beckman type 35 rotor) for 30 min. The supernatants were mixed by stirring with Talon cobalt resin overnight. The Talon cobalt resin was allowed to settle by gravity and then collected and washed three times. The bound BLIP mutant proteins were eluted from the Talon cobalt resins using 150 mm imidazole in Tris-buffered saline. The bacteria containing TEM-1 β-lactamase expression plasmid DNA was grown at 37 °C and induced at A600 nm ∼0.6 with 0.3 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. The expressed periplasmic protein TEM-1 was extracted by osmotic shock in which bacteria were soaked with 20% sucrose solution at room temperature and then centrifuged, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 5 mm ice cold magnesium sulfate. The osmotic shock fluid was fractionated on a DEAE column in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7, with 100 mm NaCl. Flow-through material was diluted 10-fold with distilled water and refractionated on the DEAE column. TEM-1 β-lactamase was eluted with a 0–2 M NaCl gradient in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0. The protein was further purified using a Superdex-75 sizing column in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, with 150 mm NaCl. The purity of the proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis. Protein concentrations were determined using optical density measurements at 280 nm with 8 m guanidine HCl-denatured protein based on the theoretically calculated extinction coefficients according to the amino acid sequence. Isothermal Titration Calorimetric Measurement—The binding enthalpy measurements were carried out using a VP-ITC isothermal titration calorimeter from MicroCal LLC (Northampton, MA). Data processing was performed using the manufacturer-supplied software package, Origin 7.0 (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA) with an ITC add-on. Typical titration experiments were carried out by titrating 40 μm TEM-1 β-lactamase into 4 μm BLIP mutant in PBS (50 mm phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl). To avoid inconsistencies in different protein preparations, we pooled enough TEM-1 β-lactamase (∼60 mg) to titrate many BLIP mutants and enough wild type BLIP (∼7 mg) to use as the reference for every mutant titration. For this purpose, about 70 mg of TEM-1 was made and stored in PBS. The proton linkage effect was tested by measuring the binding enthalpies of some BLIP mutants and TEM-1 β-lactamase in Tris buffer. The binding enthalpy in Tris buffer was identical to that in phosphate buffer, suggesting that there is a minimal proton linkage effect for the determinations. ITC experiments of each BLIP mutant binding to TEM-1 β-lactamase were done in no less than three different temperatures within the range of 6 to 30 °C. The typical injection volume was 15 μl with a 300-s gap between consecutive injections. Because of diffusion around the tip of the injection syringe during the lengthy waiting time before a titration starts, the first injection tends to have a lesser signal. To minimize this effect and preserve materials, we set the first injection volume to 3 μl. During data processing, the data points from the first injections were normally removed. Binding affinities could not be determined accurately by standard ITC for mutants exhibiting a binding affinity to the TEM-1 β-lactamase higher than 108 m-1; however their binding enthalpies are still valid. A displacement ITC was used to determine the values for high affinity binding mutants. Displacement titrations were used to determine the binding affinities for the mutants having binding affinity to TEM-1 of 108 m-1 or more. For each tight binding mutant, we looked for a proper low affinity mutant as the competitive displaced mutant in order to adjust the overall binding constant value to between 105 and 107 m-1 with appropriate enthalpy signals. The tight binding affinity mutant was titrated into the preformed complex between TEM-1 and the lower binding affinity mutant. The resulting apparent K value and ΔH were used to calculate the K and ΔH of the tight mutant. The following equations were used to calculate K and ΔH of the tight mutant provided the displacement ITC were competitive (21Sigurskjold B.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 277: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 22Zhang Y.L. Zhang Z.Y. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 261: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar): ΔHapparent=ΔHtight-ΔHlowKlow[mutantlow]1+Klow[mutantlow](Eq. 1) Kapparent=Ktight1+Klow[mutantlow](Eq. 2) where ΔHapparent, ΔHtight, andΔHlow are the apparent enthalpy of the displacement ITC, the binding enthalpy of the tight mutant, and the binding enthalpy of the low affinity mutant, respectively. Kapparent, Ktight, and Klow are the apparent K of the displacement ITC, the K of the tight mutant, and the K of the low affinity mutant, respectively. All parameters except Ktight are measured either from displacement ITC or standard ITC. The first equation (Equation 1) provides a convenient diagnostic tool to confirm that the displacement ITC is competitive. Only when the first equation (Equation 1) was satisfied by the results of our measurements from displacement ITC and standard ITC were we confident that the displacement ITC was competitive and the Ktight could be estimated correctly using the second equation (Equation 2). We also processed the displacement ITC data using the manufacturer-supplied subroutine that was incorporated into the program package, and we found the two results to be virtually identical when the displacement was competitive (less than 5% difference). In several cases, the displacement ITC failed to show competitiveness between the high affinity mutant and the low affinity mutant for the binding of TEM-1. We did not incorporate those data in our analysis. Structure-based Estimation of Thermodynamic Parameters—The solvent-accessible surface areas of the protein complexes of TEM-1 and BLIP mutants were calculated as follows. The structures of the complexes of TEM-1 and BLIP mutants were modeled by simple mutation on Coot (23Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar) with the most favorable rotamer. The accessible surface areas were calculated from these modeled structures and the wild type structure (Protein Data Bank code 1JTG) using the program AREAIMOL from the CCP4 suite of programs with a probe of 1.4 Å (24Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar). Hydrophobicity Calculations of the Mutants—The hydrophobicity scale of the mutation was calculated according to the scale reported by Black and Mould (25Black S.D. Mould D.R. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 193: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). For each mutant, the hydrophobicity change was calculated by the difference between the hydrophobicity of the wild type amino acid and that of alanine. Thermodynamics of Binding of TEM-1 β-Lactamase and Wild Type BLIP—Isothermal titration calorimetric measurements of the binding of TEM-1 β-lactamase to wild type BLIP (Fig. 1A) were performed. At 10 °C, at which the binding enthalpy is highly unfavorable (ΔH =+5.4 ± 0.2 kcal mol-1). The binding enthalpy is, however, strongly temperature-dependent. For temperatures below 15 °C, the binding enthalpy is positive; however, at temperatures higher than 25 °C, the binding enthalpy becomes negative (ΔH =-3.9 ± 0.1 kcal mol-1 at 25 °C). Based on these results, we determined that the binding heat capacity change for this interaction (ΔCp) is -672 ± 35 cal·mol-1·K-1. Using the results for the temperature dependence of the binding enthalpy of this interaction, we extrapolated an isoenthalpic temperature (at which ΔH = 0) of 19 ± 1 °C for formation of a complex between TEM-1 β-lactamase and wild type BLIP (Fig. 1B). At temperatures near 19 °C (15–22 °C), we found that titrations are difficult to interpret because of the low signal. It was further found that standard isothermal calorimetric measurements underestimated the binding affinity of this interaction (K was determined to ∼108 m-1). The actual binding affinity is 2 × 109 m-1 (26Petrosino J. Rudgers G. Gilbert H. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2394-2400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 27Strynadka N.C. Jensen S.E. Johns K. Blanchard H. Page M. Matagne A. Frere J.M. James M.N. Nature. 1994; 368: 657-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar); because titration conditions limited the number of data points that could be obtained in the transition region, the accuracy of the curve fitting used to obtain a binding affinity was also limited. This is a well documented limitation in ITC titration (K > 109 m-1) (28Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar). Because of the underestimation, the binding entropy obtained from these standard ITC measurements is unreliable. The enthalpy measurements obtained, however, are accurate. To determine the binding affinity more accurately, a displacement scheme was used (29Velazquez-Campoy A. Leavitt S.A. Freire E. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 261: 35-54PubMed Google Scholar). For these experiments, a solution of known concentration of a complex of TEM-1 β-lactamase and a low affinity BLIP mutant was placed in the sample cell of the calorimeter and titrated with wild type BLIP. The injected wild type BLIP displaced the lower affinity BLIP mutant from the complex. The observed calorimetric enthalpy and K value were used to calculate the K value of the binding of wild type BLIP and TEM-1 β-lactamase-based on competitive binding kinetics according to published methods (21Sigurskjold B.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 277: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Thermodynamics of Binding between TEM-1 β-Lactamase and BLIP Mutants—We further carried out systematic isothermal calorimetric determinations of the binding thermodynamics for the interaction of TEM-1 β-lactamase with 20 alanine substitution mutants of BLIP contact residues. Fig. 2 shows representative raw titration curves of the binding interaction between a low affinity BLIP mutant and TEM-1 β-lactamase. The binding thermodynamics of 20 contact residue mutants with TEM-1 are listed in Table 1. The binding thermodynamics of hotspot residue mutants were determined by standard ITC measurements. The typical “c values” (defined as K multiplied by the concentration of protein in the sample cell) of these mutants range from 100 to 300. It has been suggested that c values should range from 5 to 500 for accurate determination of K values (30Turnbull W.B. Daranas A.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 14859-14866Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Based on this criterion, the hotspot mutants are well within the appropriate range for accurate determination of binding thermodynamics (binding free energy, enthalpy, and entropy). For the high affinity mutants (K > 109 m-1), the c values are 2000 or higher, and the K values determined by standard ITC are highly inaccurate because of the limited number of data points in the transition region of the binding curve. The standard ITC-determined K values for these high affinity mutants are at least 10-fold less than expected from the reported Ki values (8Zhang Z. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45706-45712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 18Zhang Z. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42860-42866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As in case of wild type BLIP, the binding enthalpies of these high affinity mutants are accurate using standard ITC measurements.TABLE 1Thermodynamic parameters for wild type BLIP and alanine substitution mutants of BLIP contact residues Ki values are the previously reported inhibition concentrations (8Zhang Z.

For high affinity BLIP mutants, no entropy is calculated because of the potential errors of the K values. WT, wild type.

https://openalex.org/W2079322590,"Metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGlu1) has a discrete distribution in the central nervous system restricted to neurons. Its expression undergoes important changes during development and in response to physiological and pathological modifications. Here, we have determined the structure of the mGlu1 gene and demonstrated that mGlu1 transcription takes places at alternative first exons. Moreover, we have identified active promoter regions upstream from the two most expressed first exons by means of luciferase reporter gene assays performed in primary cerebellar granule neurons. Targeted mutations of active elements constituting the core promoter and electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that the factors thyroid transcription factor-1 and CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins β act synergistically to promote mGlu1 transcription. We have also elucidated the molecular bases for the neuron-specific expression of mGlu1 identifying a neural restrictive silencing element and a regulatory factor for X box element, which suppressed mGlu1 expression in nonneuronal cells. These results reveal the molecular bases for cell- and context-specific expression of an important glutamate receptor critically involved in synaptogenesis, neuronal differentiation, synaptic transmission, and plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2042266790,"We report regular and symmetric structure around dust-enshrouded Be star MWC 922 obtained with infrared imaging. Biconical lobes that appear nearly square in aspect, forming this ""Red Square"" nebula, are crossed by a series of rungs that terminate in bright knots or ""vortices,"" and an equatorial dark band crossing the core delimits twin hyperbolic arcs. The intricate yet cleanly constructed forms that comprise the skeleton of the object argue for minimal perturbation from global turbulent or chaotic effects. We also report the presence of a linear comb structure, which may arise from optically projected shadows of a periodic feature in the inner regions, such as corrugations in the rim of a circumstellar disk. The sequence of nested polar rings draws comparison with the triple-ring system seen around the only naked-eye supernova in recent history: SN1987A."
https://openalex.org/W2077761502,"Calcium- and voltage-gated (BK) K+ channels encoded by Slo1 play an essential role in nervous systems. Although it shares many common features with voltage-dependent KV channels, the BK channel exhibits differences in gating and inactivation. Using a mutant in which FWI replaces three residues (FIW) in the NH2 terminus of wild-type β2-subunits, in conjunction with alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the Slo1 S6 segment, we identify that the NH2 terminus of β2-subunits interacts with the residues near the cytosolic superficial mouth of BK channels during inactivation. The cytosolic blockers did not share the sites with NH2 terminus of β2-subunits. A novel blocking-inactivating scheme was proposed to account for the observed non-competition inactivation. Our results also suggest that the residue Ile-323 plays a dual role in interacting with the NH2 terminus of β2-subunits and modulating the gating of BK channels."
https://openalex.org/W4240737392,"The rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) facilitates an extraordinary range of biomedical and basic research, and the publication of the genome only makes it a more powerful model for studies of human disease; moreover, the macaque's position relative to humans and chimpanzees affords the opportunity to learn about the processes that have shaped the last 25 million years of primate evolution. To allow users to explore these themes of the macaque genome, Science has created a special interactive version of the poster published in the print edition of the 13 April 2007 issue. The interactive version includes additional text and exploration, as well as embedded video featuring seven scientists discussing the importance of the macaque and its genome sequence in studies of biomedicine and evolution. We have also created an accompanying teaching resource, including a lesson plan aimed at teachers of advanced high school life science students, for exploring what a comparison of the macaque and human genomes can tell us about human biology and evolution. These items are free to all site visitors."
