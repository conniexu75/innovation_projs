https://openalex.org/W3144689495,"Biological invasions are responsible for substantial biodiversity declines as well as high economic losses to society and monetary expenditures associated with the management of these invasions1,2. The InvaCost database has enabled the generation of a reliable, comprehensive, standardized and easily updatable synthesis of the monetary costs of biological invasions worldwide3. Here we found that the total reported costs of invasions reached a minimum of US$1.288 trillion (2017 US dollars) over the past few decades (1970–2017), with an annual mean cost of US$26.8 billion. Moreover, we estimate that the annual mean cost could reach US$162.7 billion in 2017. These costs remain strongly underestimated and do not show any sign of slowing down, exhibiting a consistent threefold increase per decade. We show that the documented costs are widely distributed and have strong gaps at regional and taxonomic scales, with damage costs being an order of magnitude higher than management expenditures. Research approaches that document the costs of biological invasions need to be further improved. Nonetheless, our findings call for the implementation of consistent management actions and international policy agreements that aim to reduce the burden of invasive alien species. Analysis of the InvaCost database shows that the costs of biological invasions have markedly increased between 1970 and 2017 and show no sign of slowing down, highlighting the importance of evidence-based and cost-effective management actions."
https://openalex.org/W3140243987,"Year-to-year changes in carbon uptake by terrestrial ecosystems have an essential role in determining atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations1. It remains uncertain to what extent temperature and water availability can explain these variations at the global scale2-5. Here we use factorial climate model simulations6 and show that variability in soil moisture drives 90 per cent of the inter-annual variability in global land carbon uptake, mainly through its impact on photosynthesis. We find that most of this ecosystem response occurs indirectly as soil moisture-atmosphere feedback amplifies temperature and humidity anomalies and enhances the direct effects of soil water stress. The strength of this feedback mechanism explains why coupled climate models indicate that soil moisture has a dominant role4, which is not readily apparent from land surface model simulations and observational analyses2,5. These findings highlight the need to account for feedback between soil and atmospheric dryness when estimating the response of the carbon cycle to climatic change globally5,7, as well as when conducting field-scale investigations of the response of the ecosystem to droughts8,9. Our results show that most of the global variability in modelled land carbon uptake is driven by temperature and vapour pressure deficit effects that are controlled by soil moisture."
https://openalex.org/W3141947465,"Amorphous solids such as glass, plastics and amorphous thin films are ubiquitous in our daily life and have broad applications ranging from telecommunications to electronics and solar cells1-4. However, owing to the lack of long-range order, the three-dimensional (3D) atomic structure of amorphous solids has so far eluded direct experimental determination5-15. Here we develop an atomic electron tomography reconstruction method to experimentally determine the 3D atomic positions of an amorphous solid. Using a multi-component glass-forming alloy as proof of principle, we quantitatively characterize the short- and medium-range order of the 3D atomic arrangement. We observe that, although the 3D atomic packing of the short-range order is geometrically disordered, some short-range-order structures connect with each other to form crystal-like superclusters and give rise to medium-range order. We identify four types of crystal-like medium-range order-face-centred cubic, hexagonal close-packed, body-centred cubic and simple cubic-coexisting in the amorphous sample, showing translational but not orientational order. These observations provide direct experimental evidence to support the general framework of the efficient cluster packing model for metallic glasses10,12-14,16. We expect that this work will pave the way for the determination of the 3D structure of a wide range of amorphous solids, which could transform our fundamental understanding of non-crystalline materials and related phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W3140601242,"Cognitive control guides behaviour by controlling what, when, and how information is represented in the brain1. For example, attention controls sensory processing; top-down signals from prefrontal and parietal cortex strengthen the representation of task-relevant stimuli2-4. A similar 'selection' mechanism is thought to control the representations held 'in mind'-in working memory5-10. Here we show that shared neural mechanisms underlie the selection of items from working memory and attention to sensory stimuli. We trained rhesus monkeys to switch between two tasks, either selecting one item from a set of items held in working memory or attending to one stimulus from a set of visual stimuli. Neural recordings showed that similar representations in prefrontal cortex encoded the control of both selection and attention, suggesting that prefrontal cortex acts as a domain-general controller. By contrast, both attention and selection were represented independently in parietal and visual cortex. Both selection and attention facilitated behaviour by enhancing and transforming the representation of the selected memory or attended stimulus. Specifically, during the selection task, memory items were initially represented in independent subspaces of neural activity in prefrontal cortex. Selecting an item caused its representation to transform from its own subspace to a new subspace used to guide behaviour. A similar transformation occurred for attention. Our results suggest that prefrontal cortex controls cognition by dynamically transforming representations to control what and when cognitive computations are engaged."
https://openalex.org/W3146218867,"Interaction-driven spontaneous symmetry breaking lies at the heart of many quantum phases of matter. In moir\'e systems, broken spin/valley 'flavour' symmetry in flat bands underlies the parent state out of which ultimately correlated and topological ground states emerge. However, the microscopic mechanism of such flavour symmetry breaking and its connection to the low-temperature many-body phases remain to be understood. Here, we investigate the symmetry-broken many-body ground state of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) and its nontrivial topology using simultaneous thermodynamic and transport measurements. We directly observe flavour symmetry breaking as a pinning of the chemical potential $\mu$ at all integer fillings of the moir\'e superlattice, highlighting the importance of flavour Hund's coupling in the many-body ground state. The topological nature of the underlying flat bands is manifested upon breaking time-reversal symmetry, where we measure energy gaps corresponding to Chern insulator states with Chern numbers $C=3,2,1$ at filling factors $\nu=1,2,3$, respectively, consistent with flavour symmetry breaking in the Hofstadter's butterfly spectrum of MATBG. Moreover, our concurrent measurements of resistivity and chemical potential allow us to obtain the temperature dependence of the charge diffusivity of MATBG in the strange metal regime, a quantity previously explored only in ultracold atom systems. Our results bring us one step closer to a unified framework for understanding interactions in the topological bands of MATBG, both in the presence and absence of a magnetic field."
https://openalex.org/W3152029580,"Determine the diagnostic accuracy of two antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDT) for SARS-CoV-2 at the point of care and define individuals' characteristics providing best performance.We performed a prospective, single-center, point of care validation of two Ag-RDT in comparison to RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs.Between October 9th and 23rd, 2020, 1064 participants were enrolled. The PanbioTM Covid-19 Ag Rapid Test device (Abbott) was validated in 535 participants, with 106 positive Ag-RDT results out of 124 positive RT-PCR individuals, yielding a sensitivity of 85.5% (95% CI: 78.0-91.2). Specificity was 100.0% (95% CI: 99.1-100) in 411 RT-PCR negative individuals. The Standard Q Ag-RDT (SD Biosensor, Roche) was validated in 529 participants, with 170 positive Ag-RDT results out of 191 positive RT-PCR individuals, yielding a sensitivity of 89.0% (95%CI: 83.7-93.1). One false positive result was obtained in 338 RT-PCR negative individuals, yielding a specificity of 99.7% (95%CI: 98.4-100). For individuals presenting with fever 1-5 days post symptom onset, combined Ag-RDT sensitivity was above 95%. Lower sensitivity of 88.2% was seen on the same day of symptom development (day 0).We provide an independent validation of two widely available commercial Ag-RDTs, both meeting WHO criteria of ≥80% sensitivity and ≥97% specificity. Although less sensitive than RT-PCR, these assays could be beneficial due to their rapid results, ease of use, and independence from existing laboratory structures. Testing criteria focusing on patients with typical symptoms in their early symptomatic period onset could further increase diagnostic value."
https://openalex.org/W3151018308,"Rapid cell type identification by new genomic single-cell analysis methods has not been met with efficient experimental access to these cell types. To facilitate access to specific neural populations in mouse cortex, we collected chromatin accessibility data from individual cells and identified enhancers specific for cell subclasses and types. When cloned into recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) and delivered to the brain, these enhancers drive transgene expression in specific cortical cell subclasses. We extensively characterized several enhancer AAVs to show that they label different projection neuron subclasses as well as a homologous neuron subclass in human cortical slices. We also show how coupling enhancer viruses expressing recombinases to a newly generated transgenic mouse, Ai213, enables strong labeling of three different neuronal classes/subclasses in the brain of a single transgenic animal. This approach combines unprecedented flexibility with specificity for investigation of cell types in the mouse brain and beyond."

https://openalex.org/W3148710064,"Chronic, sustained exposure to stressors can profoundly affect tissue homeostasis, although the mechanisms by which these changes occur are largely unknown. Here we report that the stress hormone corticosterone-which is derived from the adrenal gland and is the rodent equivalent of cortisol in humans-regulates hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) quiescence and hair growth in mice. In the absence of systemic corticosterone, HFSCs enter substantially more rounds of the regeneration cycle throughout life. Conversely, under chronic stress, increased levels of corticosterone prolong HFSC quiescence and maintain hair follicles in an extended resting phase. Mechanistically, corticosterone acts on the dermal papillae to suppress the expression of Gas6, a gene that encodes the secreted factor growth arrest specific 6. Restoring Gas6 expression overcomes the stress-induced inhibition of HFSC activation and hair growth. Our work identifies corticosterone as a systemic inhibitor of HFSC activity through its effect on the niche, and demonstrates that the removal of such inhibition drives HFSCs into frequent regeneration cycles, with no observable defects in the long-term."
https://openalex.org/W3146683553,"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health, physical activity, and sedentary behavior of people worldwide. According to the Health Belief Model (HBM), health-related behavior is determined by perceived barriers and motivators. Using an online survey with 1669 respondents, we sought to understand why and how physical activity and sedentary behavior has changed by querying about perceived barriers and motivators to physical activity that changed because of the pandemic, and how those changes impacted mental health. The following results were statistically significant at p &lt; .05. Consistent with prior reports, our respondents were less physically active (aerobic activity, -11%; strength-based activity, -30%) and more sedentary (+11%) during the pandemic as compared to 6-months before. The pandemic also increased psychological stress (+22%) and brought on moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression. Respondents’ whose mental health deteriorated the most were also the ones who were least active (depression r = -.21, anxiety r = -.12). The majority of respondents were unmotivated to exercise because they were too anxious (+8%,), lacked social support (+6%), or had limited access to equipment (+23%) or space (+41%). The respondents who were able to stay active reported feeling less motivated by physical health outcomes such as weight loss (-7%) or strength (-14%) and instead more motivated by mental health outcomes such as anxiety relief (+14%). Coupled with previous work demonstrating a direct relationship between mental health and physical activity, these results highlight the potential protective effect of physical activity on mental health and point to the need for psychological support to overcome perceived barriers so that people can continue to be physically active during stressful times like the pandemic."

https://openalex.org/W3142230270,"Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory intestinal disease that is frequently accompanied by aberrant healing and stricturing complications. Crosstalk between activated myeloid and stromal cells is critical in the pathogenicity of Crohn's disease1,2, and increases in intravasating monocytes are correlated with a lack of response to anti-TNF treatment3. The risk alleles with the highest effect on Crohn's disease are loss-of-function mutations in NOD24,5, which increase the risk of stricturing6. However, the mechanisms that underlie pathogenicity driven by NOD2 mutations and the pathways that might rescue a lack of response to anti-TNF treatment remain largely uncharacterized. Here we use direct ex vivo analyses of patients who carry risk alleles of NOD2 to show that loss of NOD2 leads to dysregulated homeostasis of activated fibroblasts and macrophages. CD14+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells from carriers of NOD2 risk alleles produce cells that express high levels of collagen, and elevation of conserved signatures is observed in nod2-deficient zebrafish models of intestinal injury. The enrichment of STAT3 regulation and gp130 ligands in activated fibroblasts and macrophages suggested that gp130 blockade might rescue the activated program in NOD2-deficient cells. We show that post-treatment induction of the STAT3 pathway is correlated with a lack of response to anti-TNF treatment in patients, and demonstrate in vivo in zebrafish the amelioration of the activated myeloid-stromal niche using the specific gp130 inhibitor bazedoxifene. Our results provide insights into NOD2-driven fibrosis in Crohn's disease, and suggest that gp130 blockade may benefit some patients with Crohn's disease-potentially as a complement to anti-TNF therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3144044361,"Across a range of motor and cognitive tasks, cortical activity can be accurately described by low-dimensional dynamics unfolding from specific initial conditions on every trial. These “preparatory states” largely determine the subsequent evolution of both neural activity and behavior, and their importance raises questions regarding how they are, or ought to be, set. Here, we formulate motor preparation as optimal anticipatory control of future movements and show that the solution requires a form of internal feedback control of cortical circuit dynamics. In contrast to a simple feedforward strategy, feedback control enables fast movement preparation by selectively controlling the cortical state in the small subspace that matters for the upcoming movement. Feedback but not feedforward control explains the orthogonality between preparatory and movement activity observed in reaching monkeys. We propose a circuit model in which optimal preparatory control is implemented as a thalamo-cortical loop gated by the basal ganglia."
https://openalex.org/W3140493829,"The photon-the quantum excitation of the electromagnetic field-is massless but carries momentum. A photon can therefore exert a force on an object upon collision1. Slowing the translational motion of atoms and ions by application of such a force2,3, known as laser cooling, was first demonstrated 40 years ago4,5. It revolutionized atomic physics over the following decades6-8, and it is now a workhorse in many fields, including studies on quantum degenerate gases, quantum information, atomic clocks and tests of fundamental physics. However, this technique has not yet been applied to antimatter. Here we demonstrate laser cooling of antihydrogen9, the antimatter atom consisting of an antiproton and a positron. By exciting the 1S-2P transition in antihydrogen with pulsed, narrow-linewidth, Lyman-α laser radiation10,11, we Doppler-cool a sample of magnetically trapped antihydrogen. Although we apply laser cooling in only one dimension, the trap couples the longitudinal and transverse motions of the anti-atoms, leading to cooling in all three dimensions. We observe a reduction in the median transverse energy by more than an order of magnitude-with a substantial fraction of the anti-atoms attaining submicroelectronvolt transverse kinetic energies. We also report the observation of the laser-driven 1S-2S transition in samples of laser-cooled antihydrogen atoms. The observed spectral line is approximately four times narrower than that obtained without laser cooling. The demonstration of laser cooling and its immediate application has far-reaching implications for antimatter studies. A more localized, denser and colder sample of antihydrogen will drastically improve spectroscopic11-13 and gravitational14 studies of antihydrogen in ongoing experiments. Furthermore, the demonstrated ability to manipulate the motion of antimatter atoms by laser light will potentially provide ground-breaking opportunities for future experiments, such as anti-atomic fountains, anti-atom interferometry and the creation of antimatter molecules."

Identification of clinical phenotypes may facilitate tailored therapy and improve outcomes. The purpose of this study is to identify specific clinical phenotypes across COVID-19 patients and compare admission characteristics and outcomes.This is a retrospective analysis of COVID-19 patients from March 7, 2020 to August 25, 2020 at 14 U.S. hospitals. Ensemble clustering was performed on 33 variables collected within 72 hours of admission. Principal component analysis was performed to visualize variable contributions to clustering. Multinomial regression models were fit to compare patient comorbidities across phenotypes. Multivariable models were fit to estimate associations between phenotype and in-hospital complications and clinical outcomes.The database included 1,022 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Three clinical phenotypes were identified (I, II, III), with 236 [23.1%] patients in phenotype I, 613 [60%] patients in phenotype II, and 173 [16.9%] patients in phenotype III. Patients with respiratory comorbidities were most commonly phenotype III (p = 0.002), while patients with hematologic, renal, and cardiac (all p<0.001) comorbidities were most commonly phenotype I. Adjusted odds of respiratory, renal, hepatic, metabolic (all p<0.001), and hematological (p = 0.02) complications were highest for phenotype I. Phenotypes I and II were associated with 7.30-fold (HR:7.30, 95% CI:(3.11-17.17), p<0.001) and 2.57-fold (HR:2.57, 95% CI:(1.10-6.00), p = 0.03) increases in hazard of death relative to phenotype III.We identified three clinical COVID-19 phenotypes, reflecting patient populations with different comorbidities, complications, and clinical outcomes. Future research is needed to determine the utility of these phenotypes in clinical practice and trial design."
https://openalex.org/W3140554209,"Pandemics have historically had a significant impact on economic inequality. However, official inequality statistics are only available at low frequency and with considerable delay, which challenges policymakers in their objective to mitigate inequality and fine-tune public policies. We show that using data from bank records it is possible to measure economic inequality at high frequency. The approach proposed in this paper allows measuring, timely and accurately, the impact on inequality of fast-unfolding crises, like the COVID-19 pandemic. Applying this approach to data from a representative sample of over three million residents of Spain we find that, absent government intervention, inequality would have increased by almost 30% in just one month. The granularity of the data allows analyzing with great detail the sources of the increases in inequality. In the Spanish case we find that it is primarily driven by job losses and wage cuts experienced by low-wage earners. Government support, in particular extended unemployment insurance and benefits for furloughed workers, were generally effective at mitigating the increase in inequality, though less so among young people and foreign-born workers. Therefore, our approach provides knowledge on the evolution of inequality at high frequency, the effectiveness of public policies in mitigating the increase of inequality and the subgroups of the population most affected by the changes in inequality. This information is fundamental to fine-tune public policies on the wake of a fast-moving pandemic like the COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3144914457,"Innate vocal sounds such as laughing, screaming or crying convey one’s feelings to others. In many species, including humans, scaling the amplitude and duration of vocalizations is essential for effective social communication1–3. In mice, female scent triggers male mice to emit innate courtship ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs)4,5. However, whether mice flexibly scale their vocalizations and how neural circuits are structured to generate flexibility remain largely unknown. Here we identify mouse neurons from the lateral preoptic area (LPOA) that express oestrogen receptor 1 (LPOAESR1 neurons) and, when activated, elicit the complete repertoire of USV syllables emitted during natural courtship. Neural anatomy and functional data reveal a two-step, di-synaptic circuit motif in which primary long-range inhibitory LPOAESR1 neurons relieve a clamp of local periaqueductal grey (PAG) inhibition, enabling excitatory PAG USV-gating neurons to trigger vocalizations. We find that social context shapes a wide range of USV amplitudes and bout durations. This variability is absent when PAG neurons are stimulated directly; PAG-evoked vocalizations are time-locked to neural activity and stereotypically loud. By contrast, increasing the activity of LPOAESR1 neurons scales the amplitude of vocalizations, and delaying the recovery of the inhibition clamp prolongs USV bouts. Thus, the LPOA disinhibition motif contributes to flexible loudness and the duration and persistence of bouts, which are key aspects of effective vocal social communication. A population of neurons is identified in the lateral preoptic area that can drive the full range of social communication sounds with affective scaling during mating in mice."

We aimed to explore the seroprevalence of hospital staff in the area with zero confirmed COVID-19 case to shed light on the situation of COVID-19 infection in zero or low infection rate countries where mass screening was not readily available. Methods A locally developed rapid immunoglobulin M (IgM)/immunoglobulin G (IgG) test kit was used for hospital staff screening of Ranong hospital which is located in a province with zero COVID-19 prevalence in Thailand from 17 th April to 17 th May 2020. All staff was tested, 100 of which were randomly invited to have a repeating antibody test in one month. (Thai Clinical Trials Registry: TCTR20200426002) Results Of 844 hospital staff, 82 were tested twice one month apart (response rate for repeating antibody test 82%). Overall, 0.8% of the participants (7 of 844) had positive IgM, none had positive IgG. Female staff had 1.0% positive IgM (95% CI: 0.5–2.1%) while male had 0.5% positive IgM (95% CI: 0.1–2.6%). No participants with a history of travel to the high-risk area or close contact with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 case developed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Among 844 staff, 811 had no symptoms and six of them developed IgM seropositive (0.7%) while 33 had minor symptoms and only one of them developed IgM seropositive (3.0%). No association between SARS-CoV-2 IgM status and gender, history of travel to a high-risk area, close contact with PCR-confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case, presence of symptoms within 14 days, or previous PCR status was found. None of the hospital staff developed SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Conclusions COVID-19 antibody test could detect a considerable number of hospital staff who could be potential silent spreaders in a province with zero COVID-19 cases. Accurate antibody testing is a valuable screening tool, particularly in asymptomatic healthcare workers.

https://openalex.org/W3151060651,"Cannabis sativa has been cultivated since antiquity as a source of fibre, food and medicine. The recent resurgence of C . sativa as a cash crop is mainly driven by the medicinal and therapeutic properties of its resin, which contains compounds that interact with the human endocannabinoid system. Compared to other medicinal crops of similar value, however, little is known about the biology of C . sativa . Glandular trichomes are small hair-like projections made up of stalk and head tissue and are responsible for the production of the resin in C . sativa . Trichome productivity, as determined by C . sativa resin yield and composition, is only beginning to be understood at the molecular level. In this study the proteomes of glandular trichome stalks and heads, were investigated and compared to the proteome of the whole flower tissue, to help further elucidate C . sativa glandular trichome biochemistry. The data suggested that the floral tissue acts as a major source of carbon and energy to the glandular trichome head sink tissue, supplying sugars which drive secondary metabolite biosynthesis. The trichome stalk seems to play only a limited role in secondary metabolism and acts as both source and sink."
https://openalex.org/W3146315608,"Innate social behaviours, such as mating and fighting, are fundamental to animal reproduction and survival1. However, social engagements can also put an individual at risk2. Little is known about the neural mechanisms that enable appropriate risk assessment and the suppression of hazardous social interactions. Here we identify the posteromedial nucleus of the cortical amygdala (COApm) as a locus required for the suppression of male mating when a female mouse is unhealthy. Using anatomical tracing, functional imaging and circuit-level epistatic analyses, we show that suppression of mating with an unhealthy female is mediated by the COApm projections onto the glutamatergic population of the medial amygdalar nucleus (MEA). We further show that the role of the COApm-to-MEA connection in regulating male mating behaviour relies on the neuromodulator thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). TRH is expressed in the COApm, whereas the TRH receptor (TRHR) is found in the postsynaptic MEA glutamatergic neurons. Manipulating neural activity of TRH-expressing neurons in the COApm modulated male mating behaviour. In the MEA, activation of the TRHR pathway by ligand infusion inhibited mating even towards healthy female mice, whereas genetic ablation of TRHR facilitated mating with unhealthy individuals. In summary, we reveal a neural pathway that relies on the neuromodulator TRH to modulate social interactions according to the health status of the reciprocating individual. Individuals must balance the cost of social interactions relative to the benefit, as deficits in the ability to select healthy mates may lead to the spread of disease. A circuit in the amygdala uses thyrotropin-releasing hormone to suppress male mating when a female mouse is unhealthy."

PC is produced by methylation of PE, whereas phosphatidylserine (PS) is produced by an exchange mechanism whereby the Etn moiety of PE is replaced with serine and free Etn is released. PC could also produce PS by a similar exchange mechanism, with free Cho being released. The metabolically released Cho and Etn need to be transported in and out of the cytosol and mitochondria or reincorporated into the Kennedy pathway (3Michel V. Yuan Z. Ramsubir S. Bakovic M.

Here, we demonstrate that CTL1/SLC44A1 and CTL2/SLC44A2 are authentic Etn transporters at the cell surface and mitochondria. We examined the kinetics of Etn transport in CTL1 and CTL2 depleted conditions and overexpressing cells. We characterized Etn transport in human skin fibroblasts that maintain CTL2 but lack CTL1 function due to inherited CTL1/SLC44A1 frameshift mutations (M1= SLC44A1 ΔAsp517 and M2= SLC44A1 ΔSer126) (15Fagerberg C.R.

We employed pharmacological and antibody-induced inhibition to separate the contributions of the CTL1 and CTL2 to Etn transport and PE synthesis. This study is the first to demonstrate that the CTL1 and CTL2 are high- and low- to medium-affinity cellular and mitochondrial Etn transporters. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that, as intrinsic Etn transporters, CTL1 and CTL2 regulate the supply of extracellular Etn for the CDP-Etn pathway, redistribute intracellular Etn, and balance the CDP-Cho and CDP-Etn arms of the Kennedy pathway. To assess the magnitude by which CTL1/2 inhibition affects PE and PC levels, two types of cells were characterized for phospholipid metabolism (MCF-7 and MCF-10) (16Pavlovic Z. Zhu L. Pereira L. Singh R.K. Cornell R.B. Bakovic M. Isoform-specific and protein kinase C-mediated regulation of CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase phosphorylation.J. Biol.

The cells were treated for 24 h with [3H]-glycerol, to label the entire glycerolipid pools (steady-state levels) in the presence and absence of CTL1 transport inhibitor hemicholinium-3 (HC-3) or CTL1 specific antibody (Fig. 1, A and B). It is surprising that HC-3 reduced the steady-state levels not only of PC (25%–50%) but also of PE (50%) in both cell types. CTL1 antibody similarly reduced PC and PE levels (40%–50%), further indicating that CTL1 could be involved in the transport of Etn, in addition to its well-characterized function in Cho transport (15Fagerberg C.R.

[3H]-Cho and [14C]-Etn transport were similarly inhibited with the CTL1 inhibitor HC-3 (Fig. 1C), and they compete for the same transport system (Fig. 1D). [14C]-Etn and [3H]-Cho transports were similarly diminished when equal, 200 μM, Etn, Cho, and Etn + Cho were applied, respectively (Fig. 1D). Furthermore, CTL1 antibody inhibited 14C-Etn transport in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 of 50 ng (Fig. 1E). CTL2 antibody also inhibited both 14C-Etn and 3H-Cho transports in a concentration-dependent manner with LC50 50 ng (Fig. 1, F and G). Together, the data showed that Etn is a substrate for CTL1- and CTL2-mediated transports, in addition to already known functions in Cho transport. We studied the kinetics of Etn transport in monkey COS-7 cells and control (Ctrl) and CTL1 deficient (M1=SLC44A1ΔAsp517 and M2=SLC44A1Ser126) primary human fibroblasts. As expected, COS-7 cells and Ctrl fibroblasts expressed CTL1 and CTL2 proteins, whereas CTL1 mutant fibroblasts M1 and M2 only expressed CTL2 protein (Fig. 2A). 14C-Etn transport rates (V) plotted against [Etn] produced a series of saturation curves, as expected for protein-mediated transports (Fig. 2B). Vmax values were nearly identical in Ctrl and COS-7 cells (Vmax = 26.9 and 26.3 nmol/mg protein/min) and CTL-deficient M1 and M2 cells had reduced but similar Vmax = 20.6 to 21.2 nmol/mg protein/min (Fig. 2B), apparently caused by the absence of the CTL1 transport component. Indeed, the Eadie–Hofstee plots derived from the saturation curves were biphasic in Ctrl fibroblasts and COS-7 cells and linear for M1 and M2 cells (Fig. 2C). This type of behavior indicated the presence of two distinct transport systems in Ctrl and COS-7 cells with two binding constants, of high and low affinity for Etn, and one transport system of a lower affinity in M1 and M2 cells. As further shown in Figure 2C, Ctrl fibroblasts, high-affinity (K1 = 66.5 ± 8.5 μM) and low-affinity (K2 = 299.0 ± 13.1 μM) Etn bindings were similar to COS-7 cells bindings (K1 = 55.6 ± 14.8 μM and K2 = 277.3 ± 7.9 μM). On the other hand, CTL1-deficient M1 and M2 cells are characterized by a single transport with a binding constant for Etn of 275.4 to 279.6 μM, which is the second (K2), low-affinity, binding constant as determined in Ctrl and COS-7 cells (Fig. 2C). M1 and M2 cells only express CTL2 and at levels similar to Ctrl and Cos 7 cells, and do not have a functional CTL1 protein (Fig. 2, A and D), strongly implicating CTL2 as responsible for the low-affinity Etn transport. Indeed, CTL2 depletion by siRNA knockdown in Ctrl cells abolished the low-affinity transport component while the high-affinity component remained intact (Fig. 2E). This analysis also confirmed that the high-affinity transport (K1), which is absent in M1 and M2 cells and remained intact in CTL2 siRNA-treated Ctrl, is CTL1-mediated Etn transport. Since the effects of pH and [Na+] ions on choline transport are well established (19Iwao B. Yara M. Hara N. Kawai Y. Yamanaka T. Nishihara H. Inoue T. Inazu M. Functional expression of choline transporter like-protein 1 (CTL1) and CTL2 in human brain microvascular endothelial cells.Neurochem. Int. 2016; 93: 40-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), their effects on Etn transport were also investigated (Fig. 2, F and G). Etn transport in Ctrl (CTL1 + CTL2 transport) and CTL1-deficient M2 fibroblasts (CTL2 transport) (Fig. 2F) was reduced when extracellular pH was lowered from 7 to 5.5 and stimulated when pH was increased to 8.5. In addition (Fig. 2G), as expected, the rate of Etn transport in Ctrl cells was higher than in M2 cells but the rates were not modified when Na+ ions were replaced by Li+ ions in the uptake buffer. Altogether, the data established that CTL1 and CTL2 acts as Etn/H+ antiporters, driven by a proton gradient, and they are both independent of Na+, as in case of Cho transport (19Iwao B. Yara M. Hara N. Kawai Y. Yamanaka T. Nishihara H. Inoue T. Inazu M. Functional expression of choline transporter like-protein 1 (CTL1) and CTL2 in human brain microvascular endothelial cells.Neurochem. Int. 2016; 93: 40-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Since this is the first time that Etn transporters are identified, it is important to establish if they are functionally linked to the CDP-Etn Kennedy pathway for PE synthesis. We performed pulse (synthesis) and pulse-chase (degradation) radiolabeling with [14C]Etn in Ctrl and CTL1-deficient M2 cells, to establish the contributions of total and CTL2 transport to the CDP-Etn Kennedy pathway (Fig. 3, A and B). As shown in (Fig. 3A), the total incorporation of [14C]Etn and the rates of synthesis (slopes) of the pathway intermediates phospho-Etn (P-Etn) and CDP-Etn and the final product PE were lower in M2 cells than in Ctrl cells. Similarly reduced was the [14C]Etn incorporation and P-Etn and CDP-Etn disappearance in M2 cells in the pulse-chase experiments (Fig. 3B). In addition, the [3H]glycerol radiolabeling of glycerolipid equilibrium pools (the steady-state levels) showed unchanged PC; reduced PE, PS, and DAG; and increased triglycerides (TAGs) in M2 cells (Fig. 3, C and D). Therefore, reduced Etn transport and slower P-Etn and CDP-Etn formation collectively slowed the CDP-Etn pathway (Fig. 3, A and B) and reduced PE levels (Fig. 3C) in M2 cells. Reduced DAG and increased TAG in M2 cells indicate DAG switching toward TAG synthesis. DAG is a common substrate for phospholipids and TAG, and under conditions of reduced PE synthesis by the CDP-ethanolamine Kennedy pathway (Fig. 3, A and B) the majority of DAG is directed toward TAG synthesis (Fig. 3D), as established in three CDP-ethanolamine Kennedy pathway knockout mouse models (20Fullerton M.D. Hakimuddin F.

In addition to reduced DAG and increased TAG, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylinositol were also increased in CTL1-deficient cells (15Fagerberg C.R. Taylor A. Distelmaier F.

Lipids. 2020; 230: 104914Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) when Etn transport and CDP-Eth Kennedy pathway are impaired. The CDP-Etn formation from PEtn is usually the rate-regulatory step in the Kennedy pathway and is controlled by Pcyt2 (CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase) (11Pavlovic Z. Bakovic M. Regulation of phosphatidylethanolamine homeostasis – the critical role of CTP:phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase (Pcyt2).Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2013; 14: 2529-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Indeed, in accordance with reduced CDP-Etn formation above, the activity and expression of Pcyt2 were also reduced in M2 cells (Fig. 3, E and F). The expression of Etn kinase (EK) was similarly decreased by 25% (Fig. 3F), explaining why the formation of P-Etn was reduced in M2 cells (Fig. 3, A and B). In addition to PE levels, PS levels were reduced in M2 cells, but the expression of PS synthesis (PS syntase1/2-PSS1/2) and PS degradation (PS decarboxylase-PSD) genes (Fig. 3F) was unaltered (Fig. 3C). The expression of the PC synthesis genes Pcyt1 (CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase) was decreased by 70% and that of choline kinase (CK) by 25% in M2 cells (Fig. 3F), yet unexpectedly PC levels were unchanged (Fig. 3C). We previously established (15Fagerberg C.R. Taylor A. Distelmaier F. Schrøder H.D. Kibæk M. Wieczorek D. Tarnopolsky M. Brady L. Larsen M.J. Jamra R.A. Seibt A. Hejbøl E.K. Gade E. Markovic L. Klee D. et al.Choline transporter-like 1 deficiency causes a new type of childhood-onset neurodegeneration.Brain. 2020; 143: 94-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) that the constant PC levels in CTL1-deficient M1 and M2 cells are maintained by reduced PC turnover and increased formation from other phospholipids (PC is made at the expanse of PE and PS), as the main mechanism to maintain PC as a source of choline in a new neurodegenerative disorder caused by frame-shift mutations in the CTL1 gene M1=SLC44A1ΔAsp517 and M2=SLC44A21Ser126 (15Fagerberg C.R. Taylor A. Distelmaier F. Schrøder H.D. Kibæk M. Wieczorek D. Tarnopolsky M. Brady L. Larsen M.J. Jamra R.A. Seibt A. Hejbøl E.K. Gade E. Markovic L. Klee D. et al.Choline transporter-like 1 deficiency causes a new type of childhood-onset neurodegeneration.Brain. 2020; 143: 94-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These data collectively provided strong genetic and metabolic evidence that CTL1 and CTL2 independently contribute not only to the CDP-Cho but also to the CDP-Etn Kennedy pathway. CTL2 is not overexpressed in deficient M1 and M2 cells (Fig. 2A), and as such it cannot compensate for the absence of CTL1 in those cells and affected individuals (15Fagerberg C.R. Taylor A. Distelmaier F. Schrøder H.D. Kibæk M. Wieczorek D. Tarnopolsky M. Brady L. Larsen M.J. Jamra R.A. Seibt A. Hejbøl E.K. Gade E. Markovic L. Klee D. et al.Choline transporter-like 1 deficiency causes a new type of childhood-onset neurodegeneration.Brain. 2020; 143: 94-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that CTL1 and CTL2 are both Etn and Cho transporters, the cells were transiently transfected with CTL1 cDNA or CTL2 cDNA and the protein expression and transport determined after 48 h. M2 cells lack endogenous CTL1 protein, as demonstrated in the left panel in Figure 4A. CTL1 cDNA increased CTL1 protein in both cells with a higher abundance in transfected Ctrl than in M2. In the transfected cells, the CTL1 antibody detects total CTL1 protein, from endogenously present CTL1 and plasmid DNA; Myc antibody on the other hand detects only transfected CTL1-Myc in similar levels since equal amounts of plasmid DNA were used in transfections (Fig. 4A-right panel). Ctrl and M2 cells already have endogenous CTL2, and transfection with CTL2 cDNA further increased the CTL2 levels. On the other hand, when cells were treated with CTL2 siRNA, the treatment reduced CTL2 protein and diminished the low-affinity Etn transport described in Figure 2E. Accordingly, CTL1 cDNA increased Etn transport by 100% and CTL2 cDNA increased Etn transport 25% in M2 cells 48 h post transfection (Fig. 4B). In Ctrl cells, CTL1 cDNA increased Cho (Fig. 4C, upper panel) and Etn (Fig. 4D, upper panel) transport by 50% and 25%, respectively. CTL2 cDNA similarly increased Cho and Etn transport by 25% (Fig. 4, C and D-lower panels). Overall, the transfection data corroborated the kinetic data in Figures 1 and 2 and showed that CTL1 and CTL2 promote transport with similar affinities for Cho and Etn, further showing their functional connection with both arms of the Kennedy pathway. To establish if the overexpression of CTL1 in mutant cells can facilitate the CDP-Etn Kennedy pathway, CTL1 cDNA-transfected (M2+CTL1) and CTL1-deficient (M2) cells were monitored with [14C]Etn radiolabeling in pulse (Fig. 4E) and pulse-chase (Fig. 4F) experiments. As expected, the incorporation of the [14C] in Etn, CDP-Etn, and PE was significantly increased in CTL1 cDNA-transfected relative to untransfected M2 cells. Both types of labelling experiments showed increased P-Etn and CDP-Etn degradation and increased PE synthesis and turnover in M2 transfected cells. Overall, these data demonstrated that the stimulated Etn transport by CTL1 expression increased the flux through the CDP-Etn pathway in CTL1-deficient M2 cells. It is well known that various organic cations can inhibit CTL1-mediated Cho transport (25Kouji H. Yamada T. Tajima H. Aoki T. Matsumiya T. Molecular and functional characterization of choline transporter in human colon carcinoma HT-29 cells.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2009; 483: 90-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We assessed the inhibitory effect of organic cations and CTL2 knockdown on Etn transport in Ctrl and M2 cells (Fig. 5). This helped us understand the magnitude at which CTL1 and CTL2 contributed to Etn transport. Total (CTL1+CTL2) transport present in Ctrl cells (Fig. 5A), CTL1-mediated transport in Ctrl treated with CTL2 siRNA (Fig. 5B), CTL2-only transport in M2 cells (Fig. 5C), and residual, CTL1- and CTL2-independent transport present in CTL2 siRNA-treated M2 cells (Fig. 5D) were quantified. In each case, the inhibitory constants Ki were deduced from semi-log plots (% of remaining Etn transport versus logM concentration) and compared between different transport conditions. As expected, the CTL1- and CTL2-specific inhibitor HC-3 strongly inhibited Etn transport with Ki values of 3.52 μM (CTL1), 9.14 μM (CTL2), and 5.10 μM for the total (CTL1 + CTL2) transport. Nifedipine (a calcium channel blocker) was as potent as HC-3 with Ki = 8.07 to 8.48 μM. Verapamil (a calcium channel blocker) was an intermediate CTL1/2 inhibitor with Ki = 20 to 62 μM. In addition, quinine (antimalaria drug) with Ki = 33 to 38 μM was a medium CTL1/2 inhibitor, whereas the Cho oxidation product betaine was a poor inhibitor (Ki = 5806–6216 μM) of CTL1 and CTL2 Etn transports (Fig. 5, B and C). The inhibition of CTL1-specific transport (Fig. 5B) with excess choline and Etn was similar, with Ki = 282 to 284 μM. The Ki, however, differed for CTL2-specific transport (Fig. 5C), with Ki = 1214 μM for Cho and 550 μM for Etn. The Ki value for the total (CTL1 + CTL2) transport (Fig. 5A) was 226 μM for Cho and 701 μM for Etn. Thus, the Ki values indicated that Cho and Etn are transported similarly by the high-affinity transporter CTL1. The low-affinity transporter CTL2, however, had reduced and different affinity for Cho and Etn, with more preference for Etn as its substrate. Residual Etn transport (unrelated to CTL1 and CTL2) was distinguished by CTL2 siRNA treatment of M2 cells (Fig. 5D). This residual transport component has a low affinity for Cho and Etn (Ki = 1029–1394 μM) and three orders of magnitude higher Ki = 1869 μM for HC-3 showing that is not a CTL-related transport. Finally, comparison of all transport velocities (Fig. 5E) showed a general order of contributions, from the high-affinity CTL1 (Ctrl + CTL2 siRNA), low-affinity CTL2 (M2), and the residual very-low-affinity (M2+CTL2 siRNA) transports for Etn. CTL1(Ctrl) contributed 80% and CTL2 (M2) 12.5%, and the unrelated residual transport (M2 + CTL2 siRNA) accounted for 7.5% to the total transport. The Ctrl and M2 cells express various unspecific transporters that could be contributing to this residual transport (15Fagerberg C.R. Taylor A. Distelmaier F. Schrøder H.D. Kibæk M. Wieczorek D.

https://openalex.org/W3141755651,"Skeletal muscle ischemia is a major consequence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) or critical limb ischemia (CLI). Although therapeutic options for resolving muscle ischemia in PAD/CLI are limited, the issue is compounded by poor understanding of the mechanisms driving muscle vascularization. We found that nuclear receptor estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα) expression is induced in murine skeletal muscle by hindlimb ischemia (HLI), and in cultured myotubes by hypoxia, suggesting a potential role for ERRα in ischemic response. To test this, we generated skeletal muscle-specific ERRα transgenic (TG) mice. In these mice, ERRα drives myofiber type switch from glycolytic type IIB to oxidative type IIA/IIX myofibers, which are typically associated with more vascular supply in muscle. Indeed, RNA sequencing and functional enrichment analysis of TG muscle revealed that ""paracrine angiogenesis"" is the top-ranked transcriptional program activated by ERRα in the skeletal muscle. Immunohistochemistry and angiography showed that ERRα overexpression increases baseline capillarity, arterioles and non-leaky blood vessel formation in the skeletal muscles. Moreover, ERRα overexpression facilitates ischemic neo-angiogenesis and perfusion recovery in hindlimb musculature of mice subjected to HLI. Therefore, ERRα is a hypoxia inducible nuclear receptor that is involved in skeletal muscle angiogenesis and could be potentially targeted for treating PAD/CLI."

Following an initial identification of α-1-Antitrypsin (AAT) during the resolution phase of acute inflammation, we report here the properties of this protein in the context of cartilage protection, joint inflammation, and associated pain behavior. Intra-articular and systemic administration of AAT reversed joint inflammation, nociception, and cartilage degradation in the KBxN serum and neutrophil elastase models of arthritis. Ex vivo analyses of arthritic joints revealed that AAT promoted transcription of col2a1, acan, and sox9 and downregulated mmp13 and adamts5 gene expression. In vitro studies using human chondrocytes revealed that SERPINA1 transfection and rAAT protein promoted chondrogenic differentiation through activation of PKA-dependent CREB signaling and inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin pathways. Thus, AAT is endowed with anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and chondroprotective properties that are partially inter-related. We propose that AAT could be developed for new therapeutic strategies to reduce arthritic pain and repair damaged cartilage."
https://openalex.org/W3145352412,"Uranium, perhaps the most strategically important component of heavy minerals, finds particular significance in the nuclear industry. In prospecting trenches, the radioactivity of 238 U and 232 Th provides a good signature of the presence of heavy minerals. In the work herein, the activity concentrations of several key primordial radionuclides ( 238 U, 232 Th, and 40 K) were measured in prospecting trenches (each of the latter being of approximately the same geometry and physical situation). All of these are located in the Seila area of the South Eastern desert of Egypt. A recently introduced industry standard, the portable hand-held RS-230 BGO gamma-ray spectrometer (1024 channels) was employed in the study. Based on the measured data, the trenches were classified as either non-regulated (U activity less than 1000 Bq kg -1 ) or regulated (with 238 U activity more than 1000 Bq kg -1 ). Several radiological hazard parameters were calculated, statistical analysis also being performed to examine correlations between the origins of the radionuclides and their influence on the calculated values. While the radioactivity and hazard parameters exceed United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) guided limits, the mean annual effective doses of 0.49 and 1.4 mSv y -1 in non-regulated and regulated trenches respectively remain well below the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) recommended 20 mSv/y maximum occupational limit.

We investigated the efficacy of the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant MitoQ in preventing cardiovascular dysfunction in adult rat offspring exposed to gestational hypoxia, integrating functional experiments in vivo, with those at the isolated organ and molecular levels. Rats were randomized to normoxic or hypoxic (13%-14% O2 ) pregnancy ± MitoQ (500 μM day-1 ) in the maternal drinking water. At 4 months of age, one cohort of male offspring was chronically instrumented with vascular catheters and flow probes to test in vivo cardiovascular function. In a second cohort, the heart was isolated and mounted onto a Langendorff preparation. To establish mechanisms linking gestational hypoxia with cardiovascular dysfunction and protection by MitoQ, we quantified the expression of antioxidant system, β-adrenergic signaling, and calcium handling genes in the fetus and adult, in frozen tissues from a third cohort. Maternal MitoQ in hypoxic pregnancy protected offspring against increased α1 -adrenergic reactivity of the cardiovascular system, enhanced reactive hyperemia in peripheral vascular beds, and sympathetic dominance, hypercontractility and diastolic dysfunction in the heart. Inhibition of Nfe2l2-mediated oxidative stress in the fetal heart and preservation of calcium regulatory responses in the hearts of fetal and adult offspring link molecular mechanisms to the protective actions of MitoQ treatment of hypoxic pregnancy. Therefore, these data show the efficacy of MitoQ in buffering mitochondrial stress through NADPH-induced oxidative damage and the prevention of programmed cardiovascular disease in adult offspring of hypoxic pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W3147152452,"Background Households are important sites for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and preventive measures are recommended. This study aimed to 1) investigate the impact of living with a person infected with SARS-CoV-2; 2) understand how household members implemented infection control recommendations in their home; and 3) identify the information and support needs of household members. Methods For this observational mixed-methods study, households with a person with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited via drive-through testing sites of Municipal Health Services, healthcare worker screening or hospital emergency visits in the University Medical Centre Utrecht, the Netherlands and via primary care physicians, hospital emergency visits or preoperative screening in the University Hospital of Antwerp, Belgium. We recorded household characteristics, including characteristics of all household members, together with their views on prevention measures. In a subset of households one adult household member was asked to participate in an interview investigating their views on preventive measures. Survey data were analysed using descriptive statistics and interview data by rapid framework analysis. A triangulation protocol was used to integrate findings. Results Thirty-four households (120 household members) were included in the quantitative survey. Twenty-two households were invited to be interviewed, of which 18 completed an interview (response 81.8%). Survey data showed that almost all households implemented some preventive measures, the use of face masks being least frequently reported. Measures taken depended on what was physically possible, the perceived severity of illness of the index patient and to what extent household members were willing to limit social interaction. Respondents did not believe in the effectiveness of wearing face masks within the house, and from the interviews this was explained by media coverage of face masks, impracticality and the stigma associated with wearing masks. Interviewees reported that quarantine had a high emotional burden and wished to have more information about the exact duration of quarantine, their own COVID-19 status, symptoms and when to seek medical help. Conclusion People were willing to implement prevention measures, however actual adherence depended on perceived severity of illness and the perceived risk of becoming infected. Homes are social environments and recommendations for infection prevention should account for this context. Incorporating our findings into policy making could provide households with more relevant and actionable advice."
https://openalex.org/W3143863809,"Some Plasmodium falciparum repetitive interspersed families of polypeptides (RIFINs)-variant surface antigens that are expressed on infected erythrocytes1-bind to the inhibitory receptor LAIR1, and insertion of DNA that encodes LAIR1 into immunoglobulin genes generates RIFIN-specific antibodies2,3. Here we address the general relevance of this finding by searching for antibodies that incorporate LILRB1, another inhibitory receptor that binds to β2 microglobulin and RIFINs through their apical domains4,5. By screening plasma from a cohort of donors from Mali, we identified individuals with LILRB1-containing antibodies. B cell clones isolated from three donors showed large DNA insertions in the switch region that encodes non-apical LILRB1 extracellular domain 3 and 4 (D3D4) or D3 alone in the variable-constant (VH-CH1) elbow. Through mass spectrometry and binding assays, we identified a large set of RIFINs that bind to LILRB1 D3. Crystal and cryo-electron microscopy structures of a RIFIN in complex with either LILRB1 D3D4 or a D3D4-containing antibody Fab revealed a mode of RIFIN-LILRB1 D3 interaction that is similar to that of RIFIN-LAIR1. The Fab showed an unconventional triangular architecture with the inserted LILRB1 domains opening up the VH-CH1 elbow without affecting VH-VL or CH1-CL pairing. Collectively, these findings show that RIFINs bind to LILRB1 through D3 and illustrate, with a naturally selected example, the general principle of creating novel antibodies by inserting receptor domains into the VH-CH1 elbow."
https://openalex.org/W3144324722,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation is the most prevalent RNA modification, and it emerges as an important regulatory mechanism of gene expression involved in many cellular and biological processes. However, the role of m6A methylation in vascular development is not clear. The m6A RNA methylation is regulated by dynamic interplay among methyltransferases, binding proteins, and demethylases. Mettl3 is a member of the mettl3-mettl14 methyltransferase complex, referred to as writers that catalyze m6A RNA methylation. Here, we used CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing to develop two lines of knockout (KO) zebrafish for mettl3. Heterozygous mettl3+/− KO embryos show defective vascular development, which is directly visible in fli-EGFP and flk-EGFP zebrafish. Alkaline phosphatase staining and whole mount in situ hybridization with cdh5, and flk markers demonstrated defective development of intersegmental vessels (ISVs), subintestinal vessels (SIVs), interconnecting vessels (ICVs) and dorsal longitudinal anastomotic vessels (DLAV) in both heterozygous mettl3+/− and homozygous mettl3−/− KO zebrafish embryos. Similar phenotypes were observed in zebrafish embryos with morpholino knockdown (KD) of mettl3; however, the vascular defects were rescued fully by overexpression of constitutively active AKT1. KD of METTL3 in human endothelial cells inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and capillary tube formation. Mechanistically, mettl3 KO and KD significantly reduced the levels of m6A RNA methylation, and AKT phosphorylation (S473) by an increase in the expression of phosphatase enzyme PHLPP2 and reduction in the phosphorylation of mTOR (S2481), a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase family of protein kinases. These data suggest that m6A RNA methylation regulates vascular development via PHLPP2/mTOR-AKT signaling."
https://openalex.org/W3145638868,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) are two common diabetic complications. However, their pathogenesis remains elusive and current therapies are only modestly effective. We evaluated genome-wide expression to identify pathways involved in DKD and DPN progression in db/db eNOS-/- mice receiving renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS)-blocking drugs to mimic the current standard of care for DKD patients. Diabetes and eNOS deletion worsened DKD, which improved with RAS treatment. Diabetes also induced DPN, which was not affected by eNOS deletion or RAS blockade. Given the multiple factors affecting DKD and the graded differences in disease severity across mouse groups, an automatic data analysis method, SOM, or self-organizing map was used to elucidate glomerular transcriptional changes associated with DKD, whereas pairwise bioinformatic analysis was used for DPN. These analyses revealed that enhanced gene expression in several pro-inflammatory networks and reduced expression of development genes correlated with worsening DKD. Although RAS treatment ameliorated the nephropathy phenotype, it did not alter the more abnormal gene expression changes in kidney. Moreover, RAS exacerbated expression of genes related to inflammation and oxidant generation in peripheral nerves. The graded increase in inflammatory gene expression and decrease in development gene expression with DKD progression underline the potentially important role of these pathways in DKD pathogenesis. Since RAS blockers worsened this gene expression pattern in both DKD and DPN, it may partly explain the inadequate therapeutic efficacy of such blockers."
https://openalex.org/W3144627909,"Breast cancer (BC) patients have an increased risk of developing cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) and cardiovascular morbidity, which seems to have a substantial prognostic impact. Oncologists, in collaboration with dedicated cardiologists, have the opportunity to perform cardiovascular risk stratification. Despite guideline recommendations, strategies to detect cardiac damage at an early stage are not structurally implemented in clinical practice. The perspectives of oncology professionals regarding cardiac surveillance in BC patients have not been qualitatively evaluated. We aim to explore the perceptions of oncology professionals regarding cardiac surveillance in BC patients and, more specifically, the influencing factors of delivering cardiac surveillance. A qualitative study with semi-structured interviews was conducted and thematically analyzed. Twelve oncology professionals participated in this study. Four themes were selected to answer the study objectives: (1) sense of urgency, (2) multidisciplinary collaboration, (3) patient burden, and (4) practical tools for cardiac surveillance. Most professionals did not feel the need to deliver cardiac surveillance as they considered the incidence of CTRCD as rare. Multidisciplinary collaboration was also perceived as unnecessary, and cardiac surveillance was considered disproportionately burdensome with respect to its benefits. Nevertheless, professionals affirmed the need for practical tools to deliver cardiac surveillance. Most professionals are currently unaware of CTRCD incidence and cardiac surveillance benefits. Encouraging multidisciplinary collaboration and improving their knowledge of cardiotoxic effects of treatments and possibility of early detection can lead to structured cardiac surveillance for breast cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W3142349660,"Mas-related G-protein-coupled receptor X1 (MrgprX1) is a human-specific Mrgpr and its expression is restricted to primary sensory neurons. However, its role in nociception and pain signaling pathways is largely unknown. This study aims to investigate a role for MrgprX1 in nociception via interaction with the pain receptor, Transient Receptor Potential Ankyrin 1 (TRPA1), using in-vitro and in-vivo human neuronal models. MrgprX1 protein expression in human trigeminal nociceptors was investigated by the immunolabeling of the dental pulp and cultured peripheral neuronal equivalent (PNE) cells. MrgprX1 receptor signaling was monitored by Fura-2-based Ca2+ imaging using PNEs and membrane potential responses were measured using FluoVoltTM. Immunofluorescent staining revealed MrgprX1 expression in-vivo in dental afferents, which was more intense in inflamed compared to healthy dental pulps. Endogenous MrgprX1 protein expression was confirmed in the in-vitro human PNE model. MrgprX1 receptor signaling and the mechanisms through which it couples to TRPA1 were studied by Ca2+ imaging. Results showed that MrgprX1 activates TRPA1 and induces membrane depolarization in a TRPA1 dependent manner. In addition, MrgprX1 sensitizes TRPA1 to agonist stimulation via Protein Kinase C (PKC). The activation and sensitization of TRPA1 by MrgprX1 in a model of human nerves suggests an important role for this receptor in the modulation of nociception."
https://openalex.org/W3148120435,"Students with poor reading skills and reading difficulties (RDs) are at elevated risk for bullying involvement in elementary school, but it is not known whether they are at risk also later in adolescence. This study investigated the longitudinal interplay between reading skills (fluency and comprehension), victimization, and bullying across the transition from elementary to middle school, controlling for externalizing and internalizing problems. The sample consists of 1,824 students (47.3% girls, T1 mean age was 12 years 9 months) from 150 Grade 6 classrooms, whose reading fluency and comprehension, self-reported victimization and bullying, and self-reported externalizing and internalizing problems were measured in Grades 6, 7, and 9. Two cross-lagged panel models with three time-points were fitted to the data separately for reading fluency and comprehension. The results indicated that poorer fluency and comprehension skills in Grade 6 predicted bullying perpetration in Grade 7, and poorer fluency and comprehension skills in Grade 7 predicted bullying perpetration in Grade 9. Neither fluency nor comprehension were longitudinally associated with victimization. The effects of reading skills on bullying perpetration were relatively small and externalizing problems increased the risk for bullying others more than poor reading skills did. However, it is important that those who struggle with reading get academic support in school throughout their school years, and social support when needed."
https://openalex.org/W3151290635,"Female carriers of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) presenting with DMD symptomology similar to males with DMD, such as skeletal muscle weakness and cardiomyopathy, are termed manifesting carriers. There is phenotypic variability among manifesting carriers including the age of onset, which can range from the first to fourth decade of life. In females, estrogen levels typically begin to decline during the fourth decade of life and estrogen deficiency contributes to loss of muscle strength and recovery of strength following injury. Thus, we questioned whether the decline of estrogen impacts the development of DMD symptoms in females. To address this question, we studied 6-8 month-old homozygous mdx female mice randomly assigned to a sham or ovariectomy (OVX) surgical group. In vivo whole-body plethysmography assessed ventilatory function and diaphragm muscle strength was measured in vitro before and after fatigue. Anterior crural muscles were analyzed in vivo for contractile function, fatigue, and in response to eccentric contraction (ECC)-induced injury. For the latter, 50 maximal ECCs were performed by the anterior crural muscles to induce injury. Body mass, uterine mass, hypoxia-hypercapnia ventilatory response, and fatigue index were analyzed by a pooled unpaired t-test. A two-way ANOVA was used to analyze ventilatory measurements. Fatigue and ECC-injury recovery experiments were analyzed by a two-way repeated-measures ANOVA. Results show no differences between sham and OVX mdx mice in ventilatory function, strength, or recovery of strength after fatigue in the diaphragm muscle or anterior crural muscles (p ≥ 0.078). However, OVX mice had significantly greater eccentric torque loss and blunted recovery of strength after ECC-induced injury compared to sham mice (p ≤ 0.019). Although the results show that loss of estrogen has minimal impact on skeletal muscle contractile function in female mdx mice, a key finding suggests that estrogen is important in muscle recovery in female mdx mice after injury."
https://openalex.org/W3142222349,"Background Methyl Jasmonate (MeJA) could promote the opening of sorghum florets, but the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Objective We aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism of exogenous MeJA in promoting the opening of sorghum florets. Methods Hybrid sorghum Aikang-8 was selected as the test material in this study. Sorghum plants of uniform growth with approximately 20%-25% florets open were selected and treated with 0, 0.5 and 2.0 mmol/L of MeJA. Totally there were 27 samples with lodicules removed were obtained at different time points and used for the transcriptome analysis using the BGISEQ_500RS platform. Results The results showed the sorghum florets opened earlier than the control after the treatment with exogenous MeJA, and the promotive effect increased along with the increase of exogenous MeJA concentration. The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in plasma cells increased with the increase of MeJA concentration, whether up- or down-regulated, after the exogenous MeJA treatment. Besides, the number of metabolic pathways was also positively correlated with the concentration of MeJA. GO and KEGG analysis suggested the DEGs were mainly enriched in starch and sucrose metabolism-related pathways (i.e., LOC8063704, LOC8083539 and LOC8056206), plant hormone signal transduction pathways (i.e., LOC8084842, LOC8072010, and LOC8057408), energy metabolic pathway (i.e., LOC8076139) and the α-linolenic acid metabolic pathway (i.e., LOC8055636, LOC8057399, LOC8063048 and LOC110430730). Functional analysis of target genes showed that two genes named LOC-1 (LOC8063704) and LOC-2 (LOC8076139) could induce the earlier flowering of Arabidopsis thaliana . Conclusion The results of this study suggest that exogenous MeJA treatments could induce the up- or down- regulation of genes related to starch and sucrose metabolism, -linolenic acid metabolism and plant hormone signal transduction pathways in the plasma cells of sorghum florets, thereby promoting the opening of sorghum florets."
https://openalex.org/W3145250670,"Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is an important regulator of the cell cycle and it is frequently overexpressed in cancer cells. Several small molecule inhibitors have been developed to target Plk1 and some of them have reached clinical trials in adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Pediatric AML patients have a poor prognosis and survivors suffer from long-term side effects. As adult AML cells have an elevated expression of Plk1, AML is a disease candidate for Plk1 inhibition. However, the relative success of clinical trials have been hampered by adverse reactions. Herein, PLK1-targeting RNA interference (RNAi) prodrugs that enter cells without a transfection reagent are used to target PLK1 selectively in primary cells from pediatric AML patients. We show that PLK1 and PLK4 mRNA expression are significantly higher in pediatric AML patients when compared to healthy donors and that PLK1 is downregulated by on average 50% using RNAi prodrugs without a significant effect on other PLK family members. In addition, the RNAi prodrug-induced decrease in PLK1 can be used to potentiate the effect of cytarabine. In summary, PLK1-targeting RNAi prodrugs can decrease the elevated levels of PLK1 in primary cells from pediatric AML patients and sensitize pediatric AML cells to chemotherapeutics."

Understanding the semantic and emotional impact of the words used by patients to describe their pain may further improve its assessment in the ePSC setting. Psycholinguistics assumes that the semantic and affective properties of words affect the ease by which they are processed and comprehended. Therefore, in this cross-sectional survey study we collected normative data about the semantic and affective properties of words associated to physical and social pain, in order to investigate how patients with cancer pain on ePSC process them compared to healthy, pain-free individuals. One hundred ninety patients and 124 matched controls rated the Familiarity, Valence, Arousal, Pain-relatedness, Intensity, and Unpleasantness of 94 words expressing physical and social pain. Descriptive and inferential statistics were performed on ratings in order to unveil patients’ semantic and affective representation of pain and compare it with those from controls. Possible effects of variables associated to the illness experience were also tested. Both groups perceived the words conveying social pain as more negative and pain-related than those expressing physical pain, confirming previous evidence of social pain described as worse than physical pain. Patients rated pain words as less negative, less pain-related, and conveying a lower intense and unpleasant pain than controls, suggesting either an adaptation to the pain experience or the role played by ePSC in improving patients’ ability to cope with it. This exploratory study suggests that a chronic pain experience as the one experienced by cancer patients on ePSC affects the semantic and affective representation of pain words."
https://openalex.org/W3150412066,"In addition to maintaining cellular ER Ca2+ stores, store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) regulates several Ca2+-sensitive cellular enzymes, including certain adenylyl cyclases (ADCYs), enzymes that synthesize the secondary messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP). Ca2+, acting with calmodulin, can also increase the activity of PDE1-family phosphodiesterases (PDEs), which cleave the phosphodiester bond of cAMP. Surprisingly, SOCE-regulated cAMP signaling has not been studied in cells expressing both Ca2+-sensitive enzymes. Here, we report that depletion of ER Ca2+ activates PDE1C in human arterial smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). Inhibiting the activation of PDE1C reduced the magnitude of both SOCE and subsequent Ca2+/calmodulin–mediated activation of ADCY8 in these cells. Because inhibiting or silencing Ca2+-insensitive PDEs had no such effects, these data identify PDE1C-mediated hydrolysis of cAMP as a novel and important link between SOCE and its activation of ADCY8. Functionally, we showed that PDE1C regulated the formation of leading-edge protrusions in HASMCs, a critical early event in cell migration. Indeed, we found that PDE1C populated the tips of newly forming leading-edge protrusions in polarized HASMCs, and co-localized with ADCY8, the Ca2+ release activated Ca2+ channel subunit, Orai1, the cAMP-effector, protein kinase A, and an A-kinase anchoring protein, AKAP79. Because this polarization could allow PDE1C to control cAMP signaling in a hyper-localized manner, we suggest that PDE1C-selective therapeutic agents could offer increased spatial specificity in HASMCs over agents that regulate cAMP globally in cells.

Although SOCE reduces cAMP synthesis in cells heterologously expressing ADCY5 or ADCY6, Ca2+-inhibited forms of ADCY (13Motiani R.K. Tanwar J. Raja D.A. Vashisht A. Khanna S. Sharma S. Srivastava S.

Interestingly, cAMP levels and PKA activity are also increased in certain cell types in response to ER(Ca2+) store depletion, independently of changes in cytosolic Ca2+ (8Lefkimmiatis K.

In this case, plasma membrane translocation of STIM1 seems to be critical, and evidence indicates that another ADCY variant, ADCY3, may be involved (17Maiellaro I. Lefkimmiatis K. Moyer M.P. Curci S.

Human arterial smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) in healthy arteries express a “contractile” phenotype. “Contractile” HASMCs are excitable cells with limited proliferative or migratory capacities (18Bennett M.R. Sinha S. Owens G.K. Vascular smooth muscle cells in atherosclerosis.Circ. Res. 2016; 118: 692-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). In response to stressors in vivo or exposure to growth factors in culture in vitro, HASMCs can adopt an “activated” phenotype (18Bennett M.R. Sinha S. Owens G.K. Vascular smooth muscle cells in atherosclerosis.Circ. Res. 2016; 118: 692-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). “Activated” HASMCs are nonexcitable cells with marked proliferative and migratory capacities (18Bennett M.R. Sinha S. Owens G.K. Vascular smooth muscle cells in atherosclerosis.Circ. Res. 2016; 118: 692-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar). Compared with contractile HASMCs, activated HASMCs express elevated levels of the elements required for SOCE (Orai1, STIM1, and inositol trisphosphate receptors) but reduced levels of the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels which dominate in contractile HASMCs (19Berra-Romani R. Mazzocco-Spezzia A. Pulina M.V. Golovina V.A. Ca2+ handling is altered when arterial myocytes progress from a contractile to a proliferative phenotype in culture.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 295: C779-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In addition, these phenotypically distinct HASMCs also differentially express variants of enzymes involved in cAMP-signaling. Thus, while the Ca2+-inhibited ADCY6 is dominant in both contractile and activated HASMCs (20Gros R. Ding Q. Chorazyczewski J. Pickering J.G. Limbird L.E. Feldman R.D. Adenylyl cyclase isoform-selective regulation of vascular smooth muscle proliferation and cytoskeletal reorganization.Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 845-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), induction of the Ca2+/CaM-activated ADCY8 accompanies adoption of the activated HASMC phenotype (21Gueguen M. Keuylian Z. Mateo V.

In addition, contractile and activated HASMCs each express unique combinations of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs), the sole intracellular enzymes capable of hydrolyzing and inactivating cAMP or cGMP. HASMCs expressing either contractile or activated phenotypes express a cGMP-hydrolyzing Ca2+/CaM-activated PDEs (PDE1B) and numerous Ca2+-insensitive cAMP-hydrolyzing PDEs (PDE3, PDE4, and PDE5). In contrast, only phenotypically activated HASMCs express a Ca2+/CaM-activated cAMP PDE (i.e., PDE1C) (22Dunkerley H.A. Tilley D.G. Palmer D. Liu H. Jimmo S.L. Maurice D.H.

Although PDE1C is readily activated by Ca2+/CaM in vitro, the intracellular sources of Ca2+ that activate this enzyme in cells are less clear. To date, few studies have comprehensively investigated the impact of SOCE on cAMP-signaling in HASMCs. Further, no studies have assessed how expression of a Ca2+/CaM-activated, cAMP-hydrolyzing, PDE (i.e., PDE1C) in cells would influence SOCE-mediated changes in cAMP synthesis in cells expressing Ca2+-sensitive ADCYs. Herein, we describe results of experiments aimed at answering each of these important questions. First, we show that depleting ER(Ca2+) stores activates PDE1C. Second, we show that inhibiting this PDE1C activation reduces SOCE as well as SOCE-dependent ADCY8 activation in these cells. Functionally, we show that PDE1C-mediated cAMP hydrolysis, through its impact on SOCE-mediated activation of ADCY8 in HASMCs, controls formation of actin-rich leading-edge protrusions (LEPs) in polarized migrating HASMCs. Taken together, our findings identify a novel signaling system through which it may be possible to promote the healing functions associated with HASMC migration and to limit the maladaptive effects of exaggerated HASMC migration in vascular conditions, including atherosclerosis or poststenting restenosis. HASMC cAMP levels were monitored in cells expressing a validated cAMP sensor (mTurq2ΔEPACcp173Ven_Ven; (H134)) (30Klarenbeek J. Goedhart J. van Batenburg A. Groenewald D. Jalink K. Fourth-generation epac-based FRET sensors for cAMP feature exceptional brightness, photostability and dynamic range: Characterization of dedicated sensors for FLIM, for ratiometry and with high affinity.PLoS One. 2015; 10e0122513Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). As predicted, decreases in fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) (i.e., increases in cAMP) were recorded in H134-expressing HASMCs incubated with the ADCY activator forskolin (Fsk), and these responses were blocked by the transmembrane ADCY inhibitor, SQ22536 (Fig. S1, A and B). ER(Ca2+) store depletion (Ca2+-free Krebs buffer + cyclopiazonic acid (CPA, 10 μM) also decreased FRET (i.e., increased cAMP) (area “B” in representative trace, Fig. 1B) in H134-expressing HASMCs. Indeed, in the 139 cells studied, ER(Ca2+) store depletion increased cAMP by an average of 8.3 ± 0.7% (mean ± SEM). Subsequent SOCE (Krebs + CPA) caused temporally biphasic changes in cAMP in these H134-expressing HASMCs (areas “C” and “D” in representative trace, Fig. 1B). SOCE was associated with an initial transient decrease in cAMP (5.2 ± 0.7%, mean ± SEM) which was followed by larger and longer-lived increase in cAMP (22.1 ± 1.2%, mean ± SEM). Of note, SOCE-associated increases in HASMC cAMP were on average 46.5 ± 1.4% (mean ± SEM) of the maximum increase recorded in these cells [Fsk (10 μM) + 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX, 100 μM)] (area “E”, representative trace, Fig. 1B). Transmembrane ADCY inhibition with SQ22536 did not alter cAMP changes associated with ER(Ca2+) store depletion [Fig. 1C (representative tracings), Fig. 1D (quantitation)]. While the initial transient decrease in cAMP associated with SOCE was reduced somewhat by SQ22536, this did not reach significance (Fig. 1, C and E). In contrast, SQ22536 did reduce markedly the magnitude and rate of the increase in cAMP observed later during SOCE (Fig. 1, C, F and G). To determine whether these effects reflected Ca2+-mediated effects on the activities of the Ca2+-sensitive ADCYs expressed in HASMCs (i.e., ADCY6 and ADCY8), experiments were also conducted in ADCY6-silenced or ADCY8-silenced HASMCs, respectively. Silencing ADCY6, but not ADCY8, blunted cAMP increases associated with ER(Ca2+) store depletion (compare Fig. 1, H and I and Fig. 1, M and N). Similarly, SOCE-associated changes in cAMP were also differentially affected by silencing of ADCY6 or ADCY8. Indeed, while silencing either of these ADCYs did significantly reduce the magnitude of the early SOCE-associated decrease in cAMP (compare Fig. 1J and Fig. 1O), only silencing ADCY8 significantly reduced the subsequent SOCE-associated increase in cAMP (compare Fig. 1K and Fig. 1P). Interestingly, although ADCY6 did not reduce the magnitude of the SOCE-associated increase in cAMP, it did reduce the rate at which cAMP accumulated during this phase of the response (Fig. 1L). Because the silencing efficiency of the ADCYs were similar (Fig. 1, R and S), we suggest this did not represent an important factor in the different responses seen in these experiments. Taken together, our data show that ADCY6 activity was involved in regulating changes in HASMC cAMP observed during ER(Ca2+) store depletion and early during SOCE and that ADCY8 activity was dominant in regulating the cAMP increases triggered by SOCE in these cells. Previous reports indicated that SOCE-mediated activation of ADCY8 could increase cellular PKA activity (16Zhang X. Pathak T. Yoast R. Emrich S. Xin P. Nwokonko R.M. Johnson M. Wu S. Delierneux C.

Store-operated Ca(2+) entry in tumor progression: From molecular mechanisms to clinical implications.Cancers (Basel). 2019; 11: 899Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To determine if HASMC PKA was activated during ER(Ca2+) store depletion or in response to SOCE, we monitored PKA activity in cells expressing a PKA activity sensor (AKAR4 FRET sensor (32Depry C. Allen M.D. Zhang J. Visualization of PKA activity in plasma membrane microdomains.Mol. Biosyst. 2011; 7: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar)) (Fig. S2, A and B). In these experiments, we observed that PKA activity was elevated during both ER(Ca2+) store depletion and SOCE (Fig. S2, B and C), with a larger fractional increase being associated with SOCE (Fig. S2, D and E). ER(Ca2+) store depletion and SOCE each increased cAMP PDE activity in HASMCs (Fig. 2A) and silencing the Ca2+-sensitive cAMP PDE (i.e., PDE1C) obviated these effects (Fig. 2, B and D). Because silencing PDE1C did not alter Ca2+-insensitive cAMP PDE activity levels in these cells (Table S4), these data indicated that HASMC PDE1C was activated in response to these treatments. To investigate whether PDE1C activation reciprocally regulated ER(Ca2+) store depletion, or SOCE, we next studied how its inhibition or silencing altered their associated intracellular Ca2+ transients. For these experiments, PDE1C was inhibited using either one of two structurally distinct PDE1-family selective inhibitors, C33 or PF-04827736 (Fig. S3, Fig. 2C) [34–35], and PDE1C was silenced with one of two selective PDE1C-targetting siRNAs (Fig. 2D and Fig. S7). PDE1C inhibition did not alter the maximum increase or rate of rise in intracellular Ca2+ during ER(Ca2+) store depletion (Fig. 3A (representative traces), Fig. 3, B and C (quantitation)). In contrast, PDE1C inhibition did reduce the maximum level of Ca2+ entry detected during SOCE and its rate of entry in HASMCs (Fig. 3, A, D and E). Consistent with the idea that PDE1 inhibitors acted specifically on PDE1C, silencing this PDE significantly reduced SOCE in these cells [Fig. 3F (representative traces), Fig. 3, G–J (quantitation)]. Because inhibition or silencing of the dominant Ca2+-insensitive PDEs only modestly altered maximal Ca2+ increases during SOCE in HASMCs (Fig. S4, A–C), our data identify PDE1C as a selective regulator of cAMP’s actions on SOCE in these cells.Figure 3PDE1C inhibition or PDE1C silencing reduces SOCE in HASMCs.

While our analysis confirmed that ER(Ca2+) store depletion did promote formation of Orai-1/Stim-1-containing puncta in HASMCs, silencing PDE1C did not alter their numbers or the expression of the ER luminal Ca2+-sensing protein, Stim-1 (Fig. S5, A–D). These findings indicate that PDE1C is unlikely to regulate HASMC SOCE by altering ER(Ca2+) sensing or the dynamics of Orai1-Stim-1 interactions in these cells. PDE1C inhibition did not alter basal HASMC cAMP (0 Ca2+) nor the increase caused by ER(Ca2+) store depletion (0 Ca2+ + CPA) (Fig. 4A (representative traces), Fig. 4B (quantitation)). In contrast, inhibiting PDE1C reduced the early SOCE-associated decrease in cAMP (Fig. 4, A and C) and the rate at which cAMP accumulated during the latter phase of SOCE (Fig. 4, A, D and E). Similarly, silencing PDE1C did not alter cAMP increases caused by HASMC ER(Ca2+) store depletion (Fig. 4, F and G)"
https://openalex.org/W3139564779,"The respiratory pathogens Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella bronchiseptica employ a type III secretion system (T3SS) to inject a 69-kDa BteA effector protein into host cells. This effector is known to contain two functional domains, including an N-terminal lipid raft targeting (LRT) domain and a cytotoxic C-terminal domain that induces nonapoptotic and caspase-1-independent host cell death. However, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction of BteA with plasma membrane (PM) as well as its cytotoxic activity in the course of Bordetella infections remain poorly understood. Using a protein-lipid overlay assay and surface plasmon resonance, we show here that the recombinant LRT domain binds negatively charged membrane phospholipids. Specifically, we determined that the dissociation constants of the LRT domain-binding liposomes containing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, phosphatidic acid, and phosphatidylserine were ∼450 nM, ∼490 nM, and ∼1.2 μM, respectively. Both phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate were required to target the LRT domain and/or full-length BteA to the PM of yeast cells. The membrane association further involved electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions of LRT and depended on a leucine residue in the L1 loop between the first two helices of the four-helix bundle. Importantly, charge-reversal substitutions within the L1 region disrupted PM localization of the BteA effector without hampering its cytotoxic activity during B. bronchiseptica infection of HeLa cells. The LRT-mediated targeting of BteA to the cytosolic leaflet of the PM of host cells is, therefore, dispensable for effector cytotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W3144247462,"Mycotoxins are toxic secondary metabolites produced by food-contaminating fungi, which lead to global epigenetic changes and cause toxicity to both farm animals and humans. However, whether mycotoxins induce gene-specific epigenetic alterations associated with inducible downstream gene expression is unclear as are the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Here, we found that T-2 toxin and its deacetylated metabolites but not deoxynivalenol (DON) or other representative mycotoxins highly induced the expression of cytochrome P450 1A4 (CYP1A4) in both Leghorn male hepatoma (LMH) cells and chicken primary hepatocytes, and this effect was related to the regulation of both aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and DNA methylation. We used methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme digestion-qPCR (MSRE-qPCR) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays and found that the binding of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) to highly methylated CpG island 3-2 at the enhancer of CYP1A4 was accompanied by the recruitment of the repressive histone modification marker H3K27me3, inducing a silent state. In turn, T-2 toxin stimulation enriched the binding of AhR to demethylated CpG island 3-2, which facilitated p300 and H3K9ac recruitment and ultimately generated an activated chromatin structure at the enhancer by increasing the active histone modification markers, including H3K4me3, H3K27ac, and H3K14ac. Interestingly, T-2 toxin-induced AhR activation also facilitated RNA polymerase II binding to CpG island 2, which may form a transcriptionally active chromatin structure at the promoter and ultimately transactivate CYP1A4. Our findings provide novel insights into the epigenetic regulation of T-2 toxin-induced gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W3146334878,"Among calcium homeostasis modulator (CALHM) family members, CALHM1 and 3 together form a voltage-gated large-pore ion channel called CALHM1/3. CALHM1/3 plays an essential role in taste perception by mediating neurotransmitter release at channel synapses of taste bud cells. However, it is poorly understood how CALHM1/3 is regulated. Biochemical analyses of the two subunits following site-directed mutagenesis and pharmacological treatments established that both CALHM1 and 3 were N-glycosylated at single Asn residues in their second extracellular loops. Biochemical and electrophysiological studies revealed that N-glycan acquisition on CALHM1 and 3, respectively, controls the biosynthesis and gating kinetics of the CALHM1/3 channel. Furthermore, failure in subsequent remodeling of N-glycans decelerated the gating kinetics. Thus, the acquisition of N-glycans on both subunits and their remodeling differentially contribute to the functional expression of CALHM1/3. Meanwhile, metabolic labeling and acyl-biotin exchange assays combined with genetic modification demonstrated that CALHM3 was reversibly palmitoylated at three intracellular Cys residues. Screening of the DHHC protein acyltransferases identified DHHC3 and 15 as CALHM3 palmitoylating enzymes. The palmitoylation-deficient mutant CALHM3 showed a normal degradation rate and interaction with CALHM1. However, the same mutation markedly attenuated the channel activity but not surface localization of CALHM1/3, suggesting that CALHM3 palmitoylation is a critical determinant of CALHM1/3 activity but not its formation or forward trafficking. Overall, this study characterized N-glycosylation and S-palmitoylation of CALHM1/3 subunits and clarified their differential contributions to its functional expression, providing insights into the fine control of the CALHM1/3 channel and associated physiological processes."
https://openalex.org/W3148989863,"Paraquat (PQ) is a highly lethal herbicide. Ingestion of large quantities of PQ usually results in cardiovascular collapse and eventual mortality. Recent pieces of evidence indicate possible involvement of oxidative stress- and inflammation-related factors in PQ-induced cardiac toxicity. However, little information exists on the relationship between hemodynamic and cardiac electromechanical effects involved in acute PQ poisoning. The present study investigated the effects of acute PQ exposure on hemodynamics and electrocardiogram (ECG) in vivo , left ventricular (LV) pressure in isolated hearts, as well as contractile and intracellular Ca 2+ properties and ionic currents in ventricular myocytes in a rat model. In anesthetized rats, intravenous PQ administration (100 or 180 mg/kg) induced dose-dependent decreases in heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac contractility (LV +d P /d t max ). Furthermore, PQ administration prolonged the PR, QRS, QT, and rate-corrected QT (QTc) intervals. In Langendorff-perfused isolated hearts, PQ (33 or 60 μM) decreased LV pressure and contractility (LV +d P /d t max ). PQ (10–60 μM) reduced the amplitudes of Ca 2+ transients and fractional cell shortening in a concentration-dependent manner in isolated ventricular myocytes. Moreover, whole-cell patch-clamp experiments demonstrated that PQ decreased the current amplitude and availability of the transient outward K + channel ( I to ) and altered its gating kinetics. These results suggest that PQ-induced cardiotoxicity results mainly from diminished Ca 2+ transients and inhibited K + channels in cardiomyocytes, which lead to LV contractile force suppression and QTc interval prolongation. These findings should provide novel cues to understand PQ-induced cardiac suppression and electrical disturbances and may aid in the development of new treatment modalities."
https://openalex.org/W3151302034,"The distinct ways the COVID-19 pandemic has been unfolding in different countries and regions suggest that local societal and governmental structures play an important role not only for the baseline infection rate, but also for short and long-term reactions to the outbreak. We propose to investigate the question of how societies as a whole, and governments in particular, modulate the dynamics of a novel epidemic using a generalization of the SIR model, the reactive SIR (short-term and long-term reaction) model. We posit that containment measures are equivalent to a feedback between the status of the outbreak and the reproduction factor. Short-term reaction to an outbreak corresponds in this framework to the reaction of governments and individuals to daily cases and fatalities. The reaction to the cumulative number of cases or deaths, and not to daily numbers, is captured in contrast by long-term reaction. We present the exact phase space solution of the controlled SIR model and use it to quantify containment policies for a large number of countries in terms of short and long-term control parameters. We find increased contributions of long-term control for countries and regions in which the outbreak was suppressed substantially together with a strong correlation between the strength of societal and governmental policies and the time needed to contain COVID-19 outbreaks. Furthermore, for numerous countries and regions we identified a predictive relation between the number of fatalities within a fixed period before and after the peak of daily fatality counts, which allows to gauge the cumulative medical load of COVID-19 outbreaks that should be expected after the peak. These results suggest that the proposed model is applicable not only for understanding the outbreak dynamics, but also for predicting future cases and fatalities once the effectiveness of outbreak suppression policies is established with sufficient certainty. Finally, we provide a web app ( https://itp.uni-frankfurt.de/covid-19/ ) with tools for visualising the phase space representation of real-world COVID-19 data and for exporting the preprocessed data for further analysis."

Multivariate analyses indicated that DNS development was related to the score, peak CK (U/L) + 40 × the number of days in which walking was impossible. The model demonstrated an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.96 (95% CI, 0.91-1.00), and DNS was predicted with 100% sensitivity and 82% specificity.An indicator that incorporates the number of days that walking is impossible for a patient could be useful in planning therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3149658771,"Human parechoviruses (HPeVs) are human pathogens that usually cause diseases ranging from rash to neonatal sepsis in young children. HPeV1 and HPeV3 are the most frequently reported genotypes and their three-dimensional structures have been determined. However, there is a lack of systematic research on the antigenic epitopes of HPeVs, which are useful for understanding virus-receptor interactions, developing antiviral agents or molecular diagnostic tools, and monitoring antigenic evolution. Thus, we systematically predicted and compared the conformational epitopes of HPeV1 and HPeV3 using bioinformatics methods in the study. The results showed that both epitopes clustered into three sites (sites 1, 2 and 3). Site 1 was located on the ""northern rim"" near the fivefold vertex; site 2 was on the ""puff""; and site 3 was divided into two parts, of which one was located on the ""knob"" and the other was close to the threefold vertex. The predicted epitopes highly overlapped with the reported antigenic epitopes, which indicated that the prediction results were accurate. Although the distribution positions of the epitopes of HPeV1 and HPeV3 were highly consistent, the residues varied largely and determined the genotypes. Three amino acid residues, VP3-91N, -92H and VP0-257S, were the key residues for monoclonal antibody (mAb) AM28 binding to HPeV1 and were also of great significance in distinguishing HPeV1 and HPeV3. We also found that two residues, VP1-85N and -87D, might affect the capability of mAb AT12-015 to bind to HPeV3."

NAD+ regulates multiple cellular processes controlling energy metabolism. Yet, its role in hypothalamic AgRP neurons to control food intake is poorly understood. Here, we aimed to assess whether genetic deletion of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt), a rate-limiting enzyme in NAD+ production, affects AgRP neuronal function to impact whole-body metabolism and food intake. Metabolic parameters during fed and fasted states, and upon systemic ghrelin and leptin administration were studied in AgRP-specific Nampt knockout (ARNKO) mice. We monitored neuropeptide expression levels and density of AgRP neurons in ARNKO mice from embryonic to adult age. NPY cells were used to determine effects of NAMPT inhibition on neuronal viability, energy status, and oxidative stress in vitro. In these cells, NAD+ depletion reduced ATP levels, increased oxidative stress, and promoted cell death. Agrp expression in the hypothalamus of ARNKO mice gradually decreased after weaning due to progressive AgRP neuron degeneration. Adult ARNKO mice had normal glucose and insulin tolerance, but exhibited an elevated respiratory exchange ratio (RER) when fasted. Remarkably, fasting-induced food intake was unaffected in ARNKO mice when evaluated in metabolic cages, but fasting- and ghrelin-induced feeding and body weight gain decreased in ARNKO mice when evaluated outside metabolic cages. Collectively, deletion of Nampt in AgRP neurons causes progressive neurodegeneration and impairs fasting and ghrelin responses in a context-dependent manner. Our data highlight an essential role of Nampt in AgRP neuron function and viability."
https://openalex.org/W3147385546,"Shortages of opioid analgesics are increasingly common, interfere with patient care and increase healthcare cost. This study characterized the incidence of shortages of opioid analgesics in the period 2015-2019 and evaluated potential predictors to forecast the risk of shortages.This was an observational retrospective study using the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug shortages data. All FDA approved opioids were included in the study. Opioid analgesics were identified using the FDA National Drug Codes (NDC) and classified according to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) schedule. We conducted Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator logistic regression analysis to assess direction of the association between risk of shortage and potential predictors. We used multivariable penalized logistic regression analysis to model predictors of shortages. We split the dataset into training and validation sets to evaluate the performance of the model.The FDA approved 8,207 unique NDCs for opioid analgesics; 3,017 (36.8%) were in the market as of April 30, 2019 and 91(3.0%) of them were listed as in shortage by the FDA. All NDCs in shortage were schedule II opioids; 86 (94.5%) were injectable and 84 (92.3%) generics. There were 418 companies with at least one opioid NDC listed by the FDA. Three companies accounted for more than 4 in 5 of the schedule II active injectable opioids. For each unit increase in the number of prior instances of shortages of a company, the likelihood of an NDC shortage for that company increased by 3.4%. For each unit increase in number of NDCs marketed by a company, the odds of an NDC shortage for that company decreased by 1%.In the period 2015-2019, shortages of opioid analgesics disproportionally impacted schedule II and injectable opioids. The risk of shortage of opioid analgesics significantly increased with the incidence of previous instances of shortages of a manufacturing company and decreased with the number of NDCs marketed by a company. The characteristics of the manufacturing company, rather than the number of companies, might be the missing piece to the complex puzzle of drug shortages in the US."
https://openalex.org/W3150079793,"Multiple cilia-associated genes have been shown to affect hair cells in zebrafish ( Danio rerio) , including the human deafness gene dcdc2 , the radial spoke gene rsph9 , and multiple intraflagellar transport (IFT) and transition zone genes. Recently a zebrafish alms1 mutant was generated. The ALMS1 gene is the gene mutated in the ciliopathy Alström Syndrome a disease that causes hearing loss among other symptoms. The hearing loss seen in Alström Syndrome may be due in part to hair cell defects as Alms1 mutant mice show stereocilia polarity defects and a loss of hair cells. Hair cell loss is also seen in postmortem analysis of Alström patients. The zebrafish alms1 mutant has metabolic defects similar to those seen in Alström syndrome and Alms1 mutant mice. We wished to investigate if it also had hair cell defects. We, however, failed to find any hair cell related phenotypes in alms1 mutant zebrafish. They had normal lateral line hair cell numbers as both larvae and adults and normal kinocilia formation. They also showed grossly normal swimming behavior, response to vibrational stimuli, and FM1-43 loading. Mutants also showed a normal degree of sensitivity to both short-term neomycin and long-term gentamicin treatment. These results indicate that cilia-associated genes differentially affect different hair cell types."
