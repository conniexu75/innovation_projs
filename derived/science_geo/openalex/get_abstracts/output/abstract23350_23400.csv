https://openalex.org/W2018527149,"Previously we described joining of DNA in the beta T cell receptor gene to DNA of an uncharacterized locus in a t(7;9)(q34;q34.3) chromosomal translocation from a case of human T lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). We now show that the locus on chromosome 9 contains a gene highly homologous to the Drosophila gene Notch. Transcripts of the human gene, for which we propose the name TAN-1, and its murine counterpart are present in many normal human fetal and adult mouse tissues, but are most abundant in lymphoid tissues. In t(7;9)(q34;q34.3) translocations from three cases of T-ALL, the breakpoints occur within 100 bp of an intron in TAN-1, resulting in truncation of TAN-1 transcripts. These observations suggest that TAN-1 may be important for normal lymphocyte function and that alteration of TAN-1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of some T cell neoplasms."
https://openalex.org/W1593385535,"The role of ATP-dependent calcium uptake into intracellular storage compartments is an essential feature of hormonally induced calcium signaling. Thapsigargin, a non-phorboid tumor promoter, increasingly is being used to manipulate calcium stores because it induces a hormone-like elevation of cytosolic calcium. It has been suggested that thapsigargin acts through inhibition of the endoplasmic reticulum calcium pump. We have directly tested the specificity of thapsigargin on all of the known intracellular-type calcium pumps (referred to as the sarcoplasmic or endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase family (SERCA]. Full-length cDNA clones encoding SERCA1, SERCA2a, SERCA2b, and SERCA3 enzymes were expressed in COS cells, and both calcium uptake and calcium-dependent ATPase activity were assayed in microsomes isolated from them. Thapsigargin inhibited all of the SERCA isozymes with equal potency. Furthermore, similar doses of thapsigargin abolished the calcium uptake and ATPase activity of sarcoplasmic reticulum isolated from fast twitch and cardiac muscle but had no influence on either the plasma membrane Ca-ATPase or Na,K-ATPase. The interaction of thapsigargin with the SERCA isoforms is rapid, stoichiometric, and essentially irreversible. These properties demonstrate that thapsigargin interacts with a recognition site found in, and only in, all members of the endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump family."

https://openalex.org/W2064249717,"Entry into the mitotic cycle (START) requires a protein kinase encoded by the CDC28 gene and one of three redundant G1-specific cyclins encoded by CLN1, −2, and −3. SWI4 and SWI6 are transcription factors required for the START-dependent activation of the HO endonuclease gene. They also fulfill an overlapping but essential role for cell division since cells deleted for both genes are inviable. We show that the essential role of SWI4 and SWI6 is to ensure the activity of G1-specific cyclin genes. SWI4 and SWI6 appear necessary for the transcription of CLN1 and CLN2 but not for that of CLN3. CLN3 function is, however, also dependent on SWI4 and SWI6"
https://openalex.org/W2043038579,"SWI4 of budding yeast codes for a component of a transcription factor (cell cycle box factor, or CCBF) necessary for G1-specific expression of HO. We show that SWI4 is essential for haploid cell viability at high temperature and in a/alpha cells at all temperatures: SWI4-deficient cells arrest as large unbudded cells. Eight high copy number plasmids were identified that allow swi4- strains to grow under nonpermissive conditions. Two carry G1 cyclin genes, CLN1 and CLN2; another carries HCS26, coding for a putative cyclin, a/alpha swi4- mutants exhibit 3- to 20-fold reductions in the levels of CLN1, CLN2, and HCS26 transcripts. The requirement of SWI4 for transcription appears to be direct: each gene contains sites similar to the CCBF-binding site; CCBF binds to the upstream region of HCS26. We propose that SWI4 participates in a positive feedback loop by which CLN1, CLN2, and possibly HCS26 promote their own transcription in G1."
https://openalex.org/W1504256022,"In this paper we demonstrate that a vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase energizes secondary active transport in an insect plasma membrane and thus we provide an alternative to the classical concept of plasma membrane energization in animal cells by the Na+/K(+)-ATPase. We investigated ATP-dependent and -independent vesicle acidification, monitored with fluorescent acridine orange, in a highly purified K(+)-transporting goblet cell apical membrane preparation of tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta) midgut. ATP-dependent proton transport was shown to be catalyzed by a vacuolar-type ATPase as deduced from its sensitivity to submicromolar concentrations of bafilomycin A1. ATP-independent amiloride-sensitive proton transport into the vesicle interior was dependent on an outward-directed K+ gradient across the vesicle membrane. This K(+)-dependent proton transport may be interpreted as K+/H+ antiport because it exhibited the same sensitivity to amiloride and the same cation specificity as the K(+)-dependent dissipation of a pH gradient generated by the vacuolar-type proton pump. The vacuolar-type ATPase is exclusively a proton pump because it could acidify vesicles independent of the extravesicular K+ concentration, provided that the antiport was inhibited by amiloride. Polyclonal antibodies against the purified vacuolar-type ATPase inhibited ATPase activity and ATP-dependent proton transport, but not K+/H+ antiport, suggesting that the antiporter and the ATPase are two different molecular entities. Experiments in which fluorescent oxonol V was used as an indicator of a vesicle-interior positive membrane potential provided evidence for the electrogenicity of K+/H+ antiport and suggested that more than one H+ is exchanged for one K+ during a reaction cycle. Both the generation of the K+ gradient-dependent membrane potential and the vesicle acidification were sensitive to harmaline, a typical inhibitor of Na(+)-dependent transport processes including Na+/H+ antiport. Our results led to the hypothesis that active and electrogenic K+ secretion in the tobacco hornworm midgut results from electrogenic K+/nH+ antiport which is energized by the electrical component of the proton-motive force generated by the electrogenic vacuolar-type proton pump."
https://openalex.org/W1989875191,"The expression of the V(D)J [variable (diversity) joining elements] recombination activating genes, RAG-1 and RAG-2, has been examined during T cell development in the thymus. In situ hybridization to intact thymus and RNA blot analysis of isolated thymic subpopulations separated on the basis of T cell receptor (TCR) expression demonstrated that both TCR- and TCR+ cortical thymocytes express RAG-1 and RAG-2 messenger RNA's. Within the TCR+ population, RAG expression was observed in immature CD4+CD8+ (double positive) cells, but not in the more mature CD4+CD8- or CD4-CD8+ (single positive) subpopulations. Thus, although cortical thymocytes that bear TCR on their surface continue to express RAG-1 and RAG-2, it appears that the expression of both genes is normally terminated during subsequent thymic maturation. Since thymocyte maturation in vivo is thought to be regulated through the interaction of the TCR complex with self major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens, these data suggest that signals transduced by the TCR complex might result in the termination of RAG expression. Consistent with this hypothesis, thymocyte TCR cross-linking in vitro led to rapid termination of RAG-1 and RAG-2 expression, whereas cross-linking of other T cell surface antigens such as CD4, CD8, or HLA class I had no effect."

https://openalex.org/W1582738866,"The DnaK protein of Escherichia coli and its eukaryotic hsp70 analogues are known to bind some polypeptides and to release or dissociate from them following ATP hydrolysis. Here we demonstrate that hydrolysis (and not simply binding) of nucleotide triphosphates leads to a change in the DnaK protein, from the to the conformation. A conformational change is not observed with the mutant DnaK756 protein, which is always found in the open conformation. Although ATP is the preferred substrate, the hydrolysis of CTP, GTP, UTP, and dATP also results in DnaK's conversion from a closed to an open conformation. The ability of DnaK to hydrolyze various triphosphates correlates perfectly with its ability to release the bound denatured bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor polypeptide."

https://openalex.org/W1570068227,"In addition to utilizing glycosylated phosphatidylinositols (GPIs) as anchors for surface proteins, protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania synthesize two novel classes of GPI: the polydisperse lipophosphoglycans (LPGs) and a family of low molecular weight glycoinositol phospholipids (GIPLs). We now show that LPG is expressed in high copy number (6 x 10(6) molecules/cell) in the promastigote (insect) stage of L. donovani but not in the amastigote stage, which infects mammalian macrophages. Detection of these molecules was by gas chromatography-mass spectrometric analyses and by a sensitive radiolabeling procedure. In contrast, a novel family of GIPLs was present in high copy number (approximately 10(7) molecules/cell) in both promastigote and amastigote stages of L. donovani. These glycolipids were purified and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, methylation analysis, and by chemical and enzymatic sequencing after deamination and NaB3H4 reduction. Promastigotes contained three major GIPLs species with the following generalized structure [formula: see text] where R = H for isoM2, Man alpha 1- for isoM3 or Man alpha 1-2Man alpha 1- for isoM4. Amastigotes contained two major GIPL species that lacked the alpha 1-3-linked mannose branch and had the linear structures Man alpha 1-6Man alpha 1-4GlcN (M2) and Man alpha 1-2Man alpha 1-6Man alpha 1-4GlcN (M3) linked to alkylacyl-PI. The 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-PI moieties of all these species contained predominantly C18:0 alkyl chains and C16:0 or C18:0 fatty acids. Amastigotes contained, in addition, a GalNAc beta 1-3 terminating glycosphingolipid with homology to the mammalian para Forssman glycolipid. This glycolipid appeared to be a constituent of the parasite membrane but was not metabolically labeled with [3H]glucose, suggesting that it was acquired from host cells. These results suggest that LPG may not be required for amastigote survival in the mammalian host and that the GIPLs are likely to be major components on the surface membrane in both stages."
https://openalex.org/W1495423595,"Protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes comprise a family of cytosolic enzymes that translocate to different intracellular sites on activation. We have recently characterized at least two intracellular receptor proteins for PKC (termed RACKs for receptors for activated C-kinase) in the Triton-insoluble material of the particulate fraction from neonatal rat heart. Here, we identify a sequence that appears to resemble the PKC binding site on these RACKs. A peptide (peptide I) with the sequence KGDYEKILVALCGGN bound PKC, and binding was markedly increased in the presence of PKC activators. Furthermore, peptide I inhibited PKC binding to RACKs in a dose-dependent manner. These data suggest that these RACKs have a common PKC binding sequence. Since peptide I inhibited PKC binding to RACKs in vitro, it may be a useful tool to inhibit PKC translocation and subsequent function in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1503240365,"Factor H is a regulator of complement activation and, in this capacity, it prevents activation of the alternative pathway on host cells and tissues when it recognizes markers on these surfaces. This report describes the binding characteristics and location of the site on factor H that is responsible for host recognition. Factor H was found to bind a variety of polyanions, including heparin, heparan sulfate, dextran sulfate, and clusters of sialic acid. In heparin-agarose binding assays it exhibited an affinity for heparin only 2-fold weaker than that of antithrombin III. Factor H exhibited little or no affinity for polyaspartic acid or bacterial colominic acid (polysialic acid). Factor H (Mr 150,000 with approximate dimensions of 30 x 600 A) is composed of 20 highly homologous domains (SCRs) that are arranged as beads on a string. Polyanions were found to block a tryptic cleavage site in domain 15, and a photoaffinity-tagged heparin probe labeled the region between domains 12 and 15. Affinity chromatography of tryptic fragments on heparin-Sepharose confirmed that this region contained the heparin-binding site. CNBr cleavage at Met787 located between SCRs 13 and 14 split the photoaffinity-tagged region. Sequence analysis strongly suggests that domain 13 contains the primary site of polyanion binding. Factor H expresses its complement regulatory function through a site located in domains 4-6 where C3b binds. Thus, the polyanion-binding site that regulates the affinity of factor H for C3b appears to reside more than 200 A away from the C3b-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W2062362728,"The tissue-specific extinguisher locus TSE1, a dominant negative regulator of transcription in somatic cell hybrids, acts via a cAMP response element (CRE) to repress activity of a hepatocyte-specific enhancer. Guided by the antagonism between TSE1 and cAMP-mediated signal transduction, we identified the regulatory subunit RI alpha of protein kinase A (PKA) as the product of the TSE1 locus. The evidence derives from concordant expression of RI alpha mRNA and TSE1 genetic activity, high resolution mapping of the RI alpha gene and TSE1 on human chromosome 17, and the ability of a transfected RI alpha cDNA to generate a phenocopy of TSE1-mediated extinction. The mechanism of TSE1/RI alpha-mediated extinction involves repression of basal PKA activity, reduced phosphorylation of CREB at Ser-133, and a corresponding reduction of in vivo protein binding at the target CRE."

https://openalex.org/W1535534510,"Depletion of intracellular calcium stores appears to increase plasma membrane permeability for calcium by an as yet obscure mechanism. We found that the Ca2+ ionophore, A23187, and thrombin elevate cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+]i) equally and cause tyrosine phosphorylation of a 130-kDa protein and to a lesser extent 80- and 60-kDa proteins. Chelation of [Ca2+]i by 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxyethane)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid/acetomethoxy ester decreased thrombin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation responses. These results suggested that [Ca2+]i elevation promotes tyrosine phosphorylation. Tyrosine phosphorylation persisted in the presence or absence of extracellular calcium after thrombin stimulation but subsided rapidly after A23187 addition if extracellular calcium was present. When Ca2+/ATPase activity, which is apparently required to maintain calcium stores, is inhibited by low temperature, tyrosine phosphorylation of the 130-kDa protein occurs. Rewarming platelets reverses tyrosine phosphorylation only if extracellular calcium is present. Thapsigargin, a calcium ATPase inhibitor, also induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the 130-kDa protein and prevents dephosphorylation of this protein when added prior to rewarming. These observations suggest that homeostatic levels of calcium in storage compartments favor tyrosine dephosphorylation of specific proteins. Thus the levels of [Ca2+]i and stored calcium appear to control tyrosine phosphorylation antagonistically. Tyrosine phosphorylation may play a role in regulating calcium channel function."

https://openalex.org/W1586649084,"In mixed membrane vesicles prepared from human platelets, the presence of two distinct calcium pump enzymes (molecular mass 100 and 97 kDa) was demonstrated by 32P autoradiography, immunoblotting, and thapsigargin inhibition. Both the 100- and 97-kDa membrane proteins showed calcium-dependent phosphoenzyme formation and reacted with a polyclonal anti-sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump antiserum, while only the 100-kDa protein reacted with the antiserum specific for the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum-type calcium transport ATPase 2b isoform. Thapsigargin, inhibiting active calcium transport in platelet membrane vesicles, predominantly blocked the phosphoenzyme formation of the 100-kDa isoform and of the tryptic calcium pump fragments of 55 and 35 kDa, while lanthanum specifically increased the phosphoenzyme formation of the 97-kDa enzyme and of the tryptic fragment of 80 kDa. These results indicate the presence of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum-type calcium transport ATPase 2b isoform and of a yet unidentified, 97-kDa calcium pump protein in human platelet membranes."

(1989) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 106, 808-813). Analysis of S-pyridylethylated IX/X-bp by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed a 16.0-kDa band (designated the A chain) and a 15.5-kDa band (designated the B chain). These two chains were separated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, and their complete amino acid sequences were determined by sequencing of the peptides obtained after digestion with lysyl endopeptidase, chymotrypsin, and V8 protease from Staphylococcus aureus and after chemical cleavage with cyanogen bromide. The A chain had an amino-terminal sequence of Asp-Cys-Leu-Ser-Gly- and consisted of 129 residues with Mr 14,830. The B chain has an amino-terminal sequence of Asp-Cys-Pro-Ser-Asp- and consists of 123 residues of Mr 14,440. There was 47% identity between the A and the B chain. The sequence of IX/X-bp showed 25-37% identity with that of the C-type carbohydrate recognition domain-like structure of acorn barnacle lectin, human and rat asialoglycoprotein receptors, the human lymphocyte Fc epsilon receptor for immunoglobulin E, proteoglycan core protein, pancreatic stone protein, and tetranectin. The sequences of the first 18 amino acid residues of both the A and B chains were also, to a certain extent, homologous to the partial amino acid sequence of the b subunit of factor XIII, a member of the beta 2-glycoprotein I-like family. In this region, some similarity with the amino-terminal amino acid sequence of botrocetin was also observed."

https://openalex.org/W1565119049,"Site-specific mutagenesis of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase was used to investigate the functional roles of 18 amino acid residues located at or near the hinge-domain, a highly conserved region of the cation-transporting ATPases. Mutation of Lys684 to arginine, alanine, histidine, and glutamine resulted in complete loss of calcium transport function and ATPase activity. For the Lys684----Ala, histidine, and glutamine mutants, this coincided with a loss of the ability to form a phosphorylated intermediate from ATP or Pi. The Lys684----Arg mutant retained the ability to phorphorylate from ATP with normal apparent affinity, demonstrating the importance of the positive charge. On the other hand, no phosphorylation was observed with Pi as substrate in this mutant. Examination of the partial reactions after phosphorylation from ATP in the Lys684----Arg mutant demonstrated a reduction of the rate of transformation of the ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme intermediate (E1P) to the ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme intermediate (E2P), which could account for the loss of transport function. Once accumulated, the E2P intermediate was able to decompose rapidly in the presence of K+ at neutral pH. These results may be interpreted in terms of a preferential destabilization of protein phosphate interactions in the E2P form of this mutant. The Asp703----Ala and Asn-Asp707----Ala-Ala mutants were completely inactive and unable to form phosphoenzyme intermediates from ATP or Pi. In these mutants as well as in the Lys684----Ala mutant, nucleotides were found to protect with normal affinity against intramolecular cross-linking induced with glutaraldehyde, indicating that the nucleotide binding site was intact. Mutation of Glu646, Glu647, Asp659, Asp660, Glu689, Asp695, Glu696, Glu715, and Glu732 to alanine did not affect the maximum rates of calcium transport and ATP hydrolysis or the apparent affinities for calcium and ATP. Mutation of the 2 highly conserved proline residues, Pro681 and Pro709, as well as Lys728, to alanine resulted in partially inhibited Ca(2+)-ATPase enzymes with retention of the ability to form a phosphoenzyme intermediate from ATP or Pi and with normal apparent affinities for ATP and calcium. The proline mutants retained the biphasic ATP concentration dependence of ATPase activity, characteristic of the wild-type, and therefore the partial inhibition of turnover could not be ascribed to a disruption of the low affinity modulatory ATP site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1547270718,"The microsomal Ca-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin induces in rat salivary acinar cells [Ca2+]i oscillations which, though similar to those activated by agonists, are independent of inositol phosphates or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores (Foskett, J. K., Roifman, C., and Wong, D. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 2778-2782). To examine whether the oscillation mechanism resides in another, thapsigargin- and IP3-insensitive intracellular store, we examined the effects of caffeine and ryanodine, known modulators of Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum in excitable cells. Oscillations were induced by caffeine (1-20 mM) in nonoscillating thapsigargin-treated acinar cells, which required the continued presence of caffeine, whereas caffeine was without effect or reduced oscillation amplitude in oscillating cells. Ryanodine (10-50 microM) inhibited oscillations in most of the cells. These results suggest that Ca2+ oscillations in parotid acinar cells are driven by periodic Ca2+ release from an IP3-insensitive Ca2+ store with properties similar to sarcoplasmic reticulum of excitable cells."
https://openalex.org/W1531393147,"Stimulation of T cell antigen receptor (TCR/CD3) following the recognition of peptide-major histocompatibility antigen complex induces phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) hydrolysis. However, the phospholipase C (PLC) enzyme mediating this process has not been identified. We report that PLC gamma 1 protein is expressed in human T cells. It is a phosphoprotein, and the activation of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) or of protein kinase C (PKC) with forskolin or phorbol ester, respectively, increases the level of phosphorylation. CD3 stimulation of T cells induces tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC gamma 1 and causes 8-10-fold higher yield of PLC activity with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (APTyr Ab) from activated cells than from non-activated cells. Genistein, an inhibitor of protein tyrosine kinase, decreases this yield of AP-Tyr Ab-bound PLC activity from activated cells and lowers the level of Ca2+ mobilization. Furthermore, phorbol ester and forskolin treatment of cells before CD3 stimulation reduces the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC gamma 1 and the PLC activity associated with APTyr Ab. These results suggest that CD3 stimulation activates PIP2 hydrolysis by inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC gamma 1, which is regulated negatively by PKC and PKA."

Lang) have been obtained. A synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to a region of the bovine proteolipid cDNA (Mandel, M., Moriyama, Y., Hulmes, J.D., Pan, Y.-C.E., Nelson, H., and Nelson, N. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85, 5521-5524) was used to screen an oat cDNA library constructed in lambda gt11. The nucleotide sequences of several positive clones (VATP-P1, clones 12, 54, 93) demonstrated the presence of a small multigene family. The four clones showed extensive divergence in their codon usage and their 3'-untranslated regions; however, the deduced amino acid sequences of the proteins were 97-99% identical. These clones encoded the proteolipid subunit as one of them (clone 12) expressed a fusion protein that reacted with an antibody to the 16-kDa proteolipid. The open reading frame of one cDNA clone (VATP-P1) predicted a polypeptide of 165 amino acids with a molecular mass of 16,641. Based on hydropathy plots, a molecule with four membrane-spanning domains was predicted, in which domain IV was especially conserved among different species. This domain showed 80% identity in nucleotide or amino acid sequences between the oat and the bovine proteolipids and contained a glutamate residue that is the putative N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-binding residue. The presence of a small multigene family of the 16-kDa proteolipid was confirmed by Southern blot analysis showing that several distinct restriction fragments of oat nuclear DNA hybridized with the VATP-P1 cDNA."

Its NH2-terminal serine is blocked by an N-acetyl group, and the protein has no processed NH2-terminal sequence other than the removal of the initiator methionine. The protein is predominantly hydrophilic. The amino acid sequence is 22% identical and 44% homologous to bovine subunit d. A null mutant was constructed. The mutant strain was unable to grow on glycerol medium.

In this study, we constructed a plasmid carrying all the F0F1 genes. This plasmid gave the highest membrane ATPase activity so far reported. Substitution of beta Gly149 by Ser suppressed the effect of the beta Ser174----Phe mutation (defective H(+)-ATPase), but beta Gly150----Ser substitution did not have this effect. A single mutation (beta Gly149----Ser or beta Gly150----Ser) gave active enzyme with altered divalent cation dependency and azide sensitivity: the beta Gly149----Ser mutant enzyme had 100-fold lower azide sensitivity and essentially no Ca(2+)-dependent activity, but had the wild-type level of Mg(2+)-dependent activity with active oxidative phosphorylation. Introduction of a beta Gly149----Ser or beta Gly150----Ser mutation with the beta Ser174----Phe mutation also lowered the Ca(2+)-dependent activity and azide sensitivity. Consistent with our previous findings (Takeyama, M., Ihara, K., Moriyama, Y., Noumi, T., Ida, K., Tomioka, N., Itai, A., Maeda, M., and Futai, M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 21279-21284), a beta Thr156----Ala or Cys mutation impaired ATPase activity, suggesting that the hydroxyl moiety at position 156 is essential for the catalytic activity. The possible location of the catalytic site including divalent cation binding site(s) is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1495731043,"A conserved 21-base pair element, designated as hex-1, located between -180 and -160 of the wheat histone H3 promoter, is known to interact with two tobacco nuclear factors, activating sequence factor 1 and hex-1-specific binding factor. We have shown previously that a mutant sequence (hex-3), which differs from hex-1 by three base pairs, can no longer bind these two factors significantly. In the present work, we examined the functional characteristics of these two sequences in transgenic tobacco. Surprisingly, we found that a tetramer of hex-3, but not of hex-1, confers high level expression in mature seeds. Expression of this synthetic promoter rapidly diminishes upon germination but can be reactivated in young seedlings and mature leaves by desiccation, NaCl, or the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA). Treatment with auxin or cytokinin has no apparent effect on the expression. Since the endogenous ABA level of plant cells is known to increase upon water stress, our data suggest that hex-3, the mutated hex-1 sequence, is an abscisic acid-responsive element (abre). We propose that a tobacco nuclear factor, distinct from activating sequence factor 1 and hex-1-specific binding factor, interacts with this sequence and is involved in mediating the effects of ABA and water stress on gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1587076945,"The membrane-bound enzyme 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta 5 -delta 4 isomerase (3 beta-HSD) catalyzes the conversion of delta 5 -3 beta-hydroxysteroid precursors into delta 4-ketosteroids, thus representing an essential step in the biosynthesis of all classes of hormonal steroids. We have recently characterized two types of cDNA clones encoding rat 3 beta-HSD proteins, the rat type I protein being much more active than type II. In order to characterize further the functional difference between these two 3 beta-HSD types, transient expression of type I and type II 3 beta-HSD cDNAs was performed in HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells. The present study demonstrates that the type I 3 beta-HSD protein has a relative specificity 64- and 46-fold higher than type II protein for pregnenolone (PREG) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) as substrates, respectively. The Km values of type I and type II enzymes were calculated at 0.74 and 14.3 microM, respectively, using PREG as substrate whereas the respective Km values were 0.68 and 12.9 microM when DHEA was used, thus showing that their different relative specificity results largely from a different affinity for substrates. Since the change of 4 amino acid residues in type II could prevent the formation of a putative membrane-spanning domain (MSD) predicted between amino acid residues 75 and 91, chimeric cDNAs containing either type I MSD in type II (II + MSD) or an absence of this MSD in type I (I-MSD) were constructed and transiently expressed. The addition of MSD intype II 3 beta-HSD markedly increased the affinity leading to Km values similar to those found in type I 3 beta-HSD, namely 0.36 and 0.40 microM for PREG and DHEA, respectively. II + MSD chimera thus encodes a protein having a relative specificity for PREG and DHEA of 58 and 73%, respectively, to that of native type I 3 beta-HSD. Moreover, removal of MSD in the type I protein (I-MSD chimera) decreased the relative specificity of type I 3 beta-HSD protein for PREG and DHEA to only 0.37 and 0.48%, with respective Km values of 11.7 and 11.0 microM, thus strongly indicating the functional importance of this putative MSD which is predicted in wild type rat type I as well as in macaque and human 3 beta-HSD proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2159177456,"We present evidence that over-expression of human plasminogen, the precursor to the serine protease plasmin, can be cytotoxic to mammalian cells. When an expression vector containing plasminogen cDNA is transfected into baby hamster kidney cells, the number of drug-resistant colonies as well as the levels of plasminogen secreted by those colonies is lower than observed in similar transfections of other protease precursor genes. The recombinant plasminogen accumulates intracellularly as degraded NH2-terminal fragments. In contrast, a mutant of plasminogen that produces inactive plasmin (active site Ser740 changed to Ala) is synthesized by these cells as a full-length plasminogen molecule, and the colony numbers and expression levels are normal. Thus, the generation of plasmin activity is responsible for the cytotoxic phenomena and the degradation associated with plasminogen expression. In addition, experiments using a plasminogen mutant that cannot be activated to plasmin (activation cleavage site Arg560 to Gly) or using coexpression of antisense urokinase RNA indicate that an endogenous plasminogen activator is responsible for converting newly synthesized plasminogen to plasmin. Finally, coexpression of plasminogen with alpha 2-plasmin inhibitor, a serpin which is the physiologic inhibitor of plasmin, prevents the toxic effects of intracellular plasmin activity and allows the synthesis and secretion of native human plasminogen."
https://openalex.org/W1536375200,"Annexin II, a major cytoplasmic substrate of the src tyrosine kinase, is a member of the annexin family of Ca2+/phospholipid-binding proteins. It is composed of a short N-terminal tail (30 residues) followed by four so-called annexin repeats (each 70-80 residues in length) which share sequence homologies and are thought to form (a) new type(s) of Ca(2+)-binding site(s). We have produced wild-type and site specifically mutated annexin II molecules to compare their structure and biochemistry. The recombinant wild-type annexin II displays biochemical and spectroscopical properties resembling those of the authentic protein purified from mammalian cells. In particular, it shows the Ca(2+)-induced blue shift in fluorescence emission which is typical for this annexin. Replacement of the single tryptophan in annexin II (Trp-212) by a phenylalanine abolishes the fluorescence signal and allows the unambiguous assignment of the Ca(2+)-sensitive spectroscopic properties to Trp-212. This residue is located in the third annexin repeat in a highly conserved stretch of 17 amino acids which are also found in the other repeats and known as the endonexin fold. To study the precise architecture of the Ca2+ site which must reside in close proximity to Trp-212, we changed several residues of the endonexin fold in repeat 3 by site-directed mutagenesis. An analysis of these mutants by fluorescence spectroscopy and Ca(2+)-dependent phospholipid binding reveals that Gly-206 and Thr-207 seem indispensible for a correct folding of this Ca(2+)-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W2102714558,"Lysosomes purified by Percoll gradient from normal human fibroblasts (GM0010A) show uptake of Ca2+ in a mediated manner. The uptake is linear over the first 1.5 min and approaches a steady state by 10 min. Uptake is saturable, displaying a Vmax of about 10 pmol/min/unit hexosaminidase at 20 mM Ca2+ (7 nmol/min/mg protein), and a Km of 5.7 mM. Ca2+ uptake increases with increasing extralysosomal pH from 5.0 to 8.5. The Q10 is 1.6, and Ea 8.7 kcal/mol. Uptake of 0.1 mM Ca2+ was inhibited to the extent indicated by 1.0 mM of the following: Cd2+, 100%; Hg2+, 100%; Zn2+, 89%; Mg2+, 77%; Ba2+, 60%; Sr2+, 37%; Fe2+, 20%; Cu2+, 0%. Mono- and trivalent cations had no effect. ATP (1.0 mM) inhibited uptake by 80%, and chloroquine (0.1 mM) inhibited by 60%, as did 1.0 mM L-cystine. Cysteamine, N-ethylmaleimide, and the anions Cl-, SO(2-)4, and acetate had no effect. The calcium ionophore A23187 augmented uptake by 10-fold at 10 microM. Surprisingly, Pb2+ greatly augmented lysosomal Ca2+ uptake in a concentration-dependent manner. Pb2+, however, adversely affected lysosomal latency. Lysosomal calcium uptake was not affected by inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate, and calcium-induced calcium release from lysosomes was not observed. A role for lysosomes in cellular calcium homeostasis has not been previously suggested. This work shows that Ca2+ can be transported into and out of lysosomes and could assist in lysosomal proteolysis. The extent of further lysosomal participation in cellular calcium regulation is unclear."
https://openalex.org/W1522355351,"Tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins was examined in NIH3T3 cells transformed by an oncogenic form of the trk protein. Proteins of 148, 140, 70, and 55 kDa were phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in trk-transformed cells but not control NIH3T3 cells. The 70-kDa protein may represent the trk oncogene protein itself which was shown to be tyrosine-phosphorylated in vivo using trk-specific antiserum. Phospholipase C-gamma 1 (PLC-gamma 1) was also found to be constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated in trk-transformed cells and the trk protein co-immunoprecipitated with PLC-gamma. The GTPase-activating protein of ras (GAP) and the 62-kDa GAP-associated protein were tyrosine-phosphorylated in trk-transformed cells, and a lesser amount of trk co-immunoprecipitated with GAP relative to with PLC-gamma. The trk oncogene product bound specifically to a bacterially expressed fusion protein containing the src homology domains of PLC-gamma. The data suggest a significant role for PLC-gamma in intracellular signaling by the trk oncogene."
https://openalex.org/W1529549063,"Abstract Reconstituted proteoliposomes containing functional Neurospora crassa plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase molecules oriented predominantly with their cytoplasmic surface exposed were treated with trypsin and then subjected to Sepharose CL-6B column chromatography to remove the liberated peptides. The peptides remaining associated with the liposomes were then separated from the phospholipid by Sephadex LH-60 column chromatography and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Six H(+)-ATPase peptides with approximate molecular masses of 7, 7.5, 8, 10, 14, and 21 kDa were found to be tightly associated with the liposomal membrane. Amino acid sequencing of the 7-, 7.5-, and 21-kDa peptides in the LH-60 eluate identified them as H(+)-ATPase fragments beginning at residues 99 or 100, 272, and 660, respectively. After further purification, the approximately 10- and 14-kDa peptides were also similarly identified as beginning at residues 272 and 660. The approximately 8-kDa fragment was purified further but could not be sequenced, presumably indicating NH2-terminal blockage. To identify which of the liposome-associated peptides are embedded in the membrane, H(+)-ATPase molecules in the proteoliposomes were labeled from the hydrophobic membrane interior with 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine and cleaved with trypsin, after which the membrane-associated peptides were purified and assessed for the presence of label. The results indicate that the approximately 7-, 7.5-, and 21-kDa peptides are in contact with the lipid bilayer whereas the approximately 8-kDa peptide is not. Taken together with the results of our recent analyses of the peptides released from the proteoliposomes, this information establishes the transmembrane topography of nearly all of the 919 residues in the H(+)-ATPase molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1501608258,"Oscillatory behavior of glycolysis in cell-free extracts of skeletal muscle involves repeated bursts of phosphofructokinase activity and associated oscillations in the [ATP]/[ADP] ratio. Addition of citrate, a potent physiological inhibitor of phosphofructokinase, decreased the frequency of the oscillations and delayed the first burst of phosphofructokinase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Citrate decreased the trigger point [ATP]/[ADP] ratio at which bursts of phosphofructokinase activity were initiated but had a much smaller effect on the average [ATP]/[ADP] ratio and did not decrease the peak values of the ratio. When oscillations were prevented by addition of fructose-2,6-P2, the decrease in the [ATP]/[ADP] ratio caused by citrate in the steady state system was similar to the decrease in the trigger point [ATP]/[ADP] ratio in the oscillatory system. The decrease in the average [ATP]/[ADP] ratio was greater in the steady state system than in the oscillating system. These results demonstrate advantages of oscillatory behavior of glycolysis in the regulation of carbohydrate utilization and the maintenance of a high [ATP]/[ADP] ratio."
https://openalex.org/W1497819832,"Abstract Lysosomal beta-hexosaminidase (EC 3.2.1.52) occurs as two major isoenzymes, hexosaminidases A (alpha beta) and B (beta beta). The alpha- and beta-subunits are encoded by the HEXA and HEXB genes, respectively. Extensive homology in both the gene structures and deduced primary sequences demonstrate their common evolutionary origin. Defects in the alpha- or beta-subunits lead to Tay-Sachs of Sandhoff disease, respectively. The B1 variant of Tay-Sachs disease is characterized by an unusual phenotype. Patient samples contain both isoenzymes; however, hexosaminidase A lacks activity toward alpha-specific substrates. In a previous report, we analyzed the biochemical consequences of an Arg178----His substitution in the alpha-subunit, causing the B1 phenotype, by in vitro mutagenesis of the homologous codon for Arg211 in the beta-subunit to produce His. We found that the substitution did not affect dimer formation or cellular targeting but caused a near total loss of activity toward a common alpha- and/or beta-substrate. Additional effects were also noted that suggested a perturbation had occurred to the protein's secondary structure. In this report, we investigate further the role of Arg in the catalysis of hexosaminidase substrates. The introduction of more or less conservative amino acid substitutions at the beta-Arg211 site were evaluated in terms of their effects on the protein's catalytic activity and susceptibility to the arginine-specific reagents and on its stability and rate of maturation in the cell's lysosome. These data demonstrate that the changes in the in vivo stability and rate of maturation, previously noted with the Arg211----His substitution, are independent of the loss in enzymatic activity. Whereas treatment of purified normal human placental hexosaminidases A and B with arginine-specific modifying reagents produced a time-dependent loss of enzymatic activity toward both alpha-specific and common substrates, these reagents failed to significantly decrease the residual activities of mutant proteins lacking Arg at position 211. Kinetic analysis of the residual enzyme activity from our most conservative construct, Arg211----Lys, determined an apparent Vmax approximately 400-fold reduced from that of the wild type enzyme but detected no change in the apparent Km. Additionally, the pH optimum of this mutant enzyme was narrower and slightly more basic than that of the normal enzyme. Thus, Arg211 in the beta-subunit and, by extrapolation, the Arg178 in the alpha-subunit of beta-hexosaminidase are active residues, i.e. part of the catalytic sites, but do not participate in substrate binding."
https://openalex.org/W1583908084,"Phosphorylase kinase from rabbit skeletal muscle has been found to have an intrinsic ATPase activity that occurs at a rate approximately 0.2% of that of its phosphorylase conversion activity and about three times that of its autophosphorylation activity. The characteristics of this ATPase activity were in all aspects tested essentially the same as the kinase's phosphorylase conversion activity. The ATPase requires Mg2+ and is dramatically stimulated by Ca2+ ions. At neutral pH there is a pronounced lag in the rate of product formation that is not present at alkaline pH, a condition that greatly stimulates both the phosphorylase conversion and ATPase activities. ATP is preferentially hydrolyzed over GTP and the Km for MgATP determined in the ATPase assay is 0.14 mM. ADP, an allosteric activator of phosphorylase conversion, also stimulates the ATPase activity, whereas beta-glycerophosphate, an inhibitor of phosphorylase conversion, is an inhibitor of the ATPase activity. Phosphorylation or partial proteolysis of the kinase, which are known to activate phosphorylase conversion, also activate the ATPase activity. Because the phosphorylase conversion and ATPase activities are regulated in parallel, we conclude that activation of the two catalytic activities must share a common underlying basis, namely an enhanced phosphotransferase activity that is independent of the phosphoryl acceptor."
https://openalex.org/W1517780720,"We investigated which is the shortest fragment of the interferon gamma receptor with ligand binding capacity. A recombinant soluble interferon gamma receptor produced in Escherichia coli was subjected to controlled digestion with several proteolytic enzymes. The fragments generated were assayed by four approaches for interferon gamma binding. A 25-kDa polypeptide comprising residues 6-227 of the mature protein was produced by sequential digestion with trypsin and proteinase K. It was identified as the shortest receptor domain with full interferon gamma binding capacity as judged by ligand blots. The proteolytic fragments were further tested for ligand binding by interferon gamma affinity chromatography. A 15-kDa polypeptide comprising amino acids 94-227 produced by digestion with endoproteinase Glu-C was found to bind with low affinity to immobilized interferon gamma. This fragment, which does not show ligand binding capacity on protein blots, was immunoprecipitated as a complex with interferon gamma by anti-interferon gamma antibodies. It also competed for the binding of radiolabeled interferon gamma to the cell surface receptor when it was assayed as a mixture of the proteolytic products, but not after separation from the cleaved rest of the molecule. The 15-kDa polypeptide probably carries the ligand-binding domain or part of it, but it lacks sequences essential for full interferon gamma binding capacity. The stretch between amino acids 6 and 21 which does not include any disulfide bonds seems to be essential for the receptor to show full activity. The digestion with endoproteinase Glu-C revealed that cysteine residues 60 and 68 of the interferon gamma receptor form a disulfide bond."
https://openalex.org/W1545935811,"Aggregation of immunoglobulin E-receptor complexes on the surface of rat basophilic leukemia cells stimulates an increase in plasma membrane K+ permeability that is monitored as an increase in the rate of efflux of preloaded 86Rb+. A major component of this stimulated 86Rb+ efflux appears to be due to a Ca(2+)-activated K+ channel because it is inhibited by quinidine in parallel with the inhibition of degranulation and membrane potential repolarization, it is blocked by 0.1 mM La3+, and it is dependent on external Ca2+. Depolarization of the plasma membrane by carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone inhibits stimulated Ca2+ influx and prevents antigen-induced 86Rb+ efflux, and increased external Ca2+ partially restores 86Rb+ efflux under these conditions. In addition, potentiation of antigen-stimulated Ca2+ influx by pretreatment with cholera toxin increases the initial rate of stimulated 86Rb+ efflux. Another component of antigen-stimulated K+ efflux appears to be mediated by a guanine nucleotide-binding protein because pretreatment of rat basophilic leukemia cells with pertussis toxin decreases the initial rate of antigen-stimulated 86Rb+ efflux to 40% of that for the untreated cells. Stimulated 86Rb+ efflux is also observed when ionomycin is used to increase cytoplasmic Ca2+ and to trigger membrane depolarization. The efflux stimulated by ionomycin is inhibited by quinidine but not by pertussis toxin pretreatment; thus, it appears to occur through the Ca(2+)-activated K+ efflux pathway. It is proposed that these K+ efflux pathways serve to sustain the Ca2+ influx that is necessary for receptor-mediated triggering of cellular degranulation."

https://openalex.org/W1526375777,"The trans-acting response element (TAR) within the long terminal repeat of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is present in all 5' termini of HIV mRNAs and is recognized by the viral Tat protein. Now we describe that the 59-nucleotide-long TAR-RNA exists as a ribonucleoprotein particle in polysomal and heterogeneous nuclear RNP fractions of HIV-1-infected HeLa-T4+ cells. Applying an immunoprecipitation technique this Tat.TAR complex could be isolated from total cell extracts as well as from polysomal or heterogeneous nuclear RNP fractions. The chain length and the identity of the TAR-RNA were established by RNase protection assays while the Tat protein was confirmed by Western blotting technique. The TAR-RNA in this complex was sequenced and found to comprise nucleotides +2 to +61 and hence includes the 3-nucleotide bulge (nucleotides +23 to +25) and the loop sequence of the TAR stem-and-loop structure. The Tat.TAR complex is present in cells at low abundance (12.5 x 10(3) copies/cell). In contrast to the TAR-containing mRNAs, which decay very rapidly after incubation of cells with actinomycin D (half-life of approximately 120 min) the half-life of TAR in the Tat.TAR complex is greater than 180 min. Alignment studies revealed that TAR-RNA (positive strand) has a potential binding ability to the U5 region within the long terminal repeat (DNA negative strand; nucleotides +107 to +147); a complementary binding with a continuous homology of 16 nucleotides was identified. It is proposed that the Tat.TAR complex functions as a small ribonucleoprotein particle during transcription initiation of HIV mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1588818258,"One of the two mutations responsible for the classical infantile Jewish form of Tay-Sachs disease is a four-base insertion in exon 11 of the beta-hexosaminidase alpha subunit gene. The gene is known to be transcribed normally, but the mRNA is essentially undetectable. It is not clear why such a relatively minor abnormality results in complete failure to generate stable mRNA. The four-base insertion was introduced into the normal beta-hexosaminidase cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis. When COS-1 cells were transfected with the resultant mutant cDNA, it generated stable mRNA and a truncated, relatively stable but catalytically inactive enzyme protein. The mutant enzyme protein was not processed nor released into the culture medium. The mutant cDNA also generated the truncated enzyme protein in an in vitro translation system with rabbit reticulocyte lysate. COS-1 cells transfected with a 3' end of the gene segment, from intron 8 through the 3' terminus, generated processed RNA of approximately 2 kilobases, the size expected from normal splicing, irrespective of presence or absence of the four-base insertion in exon 11. These results indicate that the four-base insertion does not destabilize properly spliced mRNA, nor does it interfere with normal splicing of the transcript, at least in the expression system utilized. If the four-base insertion is responsible for the undetectable mRNA in the mutant cells, it must interfere with some other steps in the processing/splicing/transport of the primary transcript yet to be examined. On the other hand, the possibility cannot be excluded definitively that another still unidentified abnormality in the same allele might be responsible for the nearly complete absence of mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W86587201,"The adenovirus single-stranded DNA-binding protein (DBP) is an essential factor in viral DNA replication. Three temperature-sensitive (ts) adenoviruses (Ad2+ND1ts23, Ad2ts111A, and Ad5ts125) are known to have single amino acid substitutions in their DBPs that result in defective DNA replication at the nonpermissive temperature. To elucidate the mechanism(s) involved in the ts phenotype, we purified the three mutant DBPs and studied their DNA-binding properties and their ability to support DNA replication in an in vitro system. The results confirm that the three ts DBPs were incapable of supporting DNA replication at the nonpermissive temperature (40 degrees C). The defect was found at both the initiation and elongation steps of DNA replication. The 2-fold stimulation of pTP.dCMP formation by the DBP was lost by prior heating of the ts DBPs. The pronounced effect of the DBP on the early elongation process was severely diminished, but not abolished, by prior heating to 40 degrees C. The functional change at 40 degrees C was irreversible, as the ts DBPs preincubated at 40 degrees C were no longer active when assayed at 30 degrees C. Upon heating to 40 degrees C, all three ts DBPs lost their ability to bind to oligonucleotides, although they still retained some binding activity for large single-stranded DNAs such as M13 DNA. Thus, the inability of these three ts DBPs to support DNA replication is attributable to their altered DNA-binding properties."

https://openalex.org/W1593155348,"It has been postulated that a protein with a molecular mass of 29,000 daltons (p29), which copurifies with hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate (P-enolpyruvate) carboxykinase, forms a complex with the enzyme and stabilizes its sensitivity to Mn2+ activation by protecting critical sulfhydryl groups from oxidation (Brinkworth, R. I., Hanson, R. W., Fullin, F. A., and Schramm, V. L. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 10795-10802). In this paper we demonstrate that p29 is not only expressed in tissues which contain high amounts of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase, such as liver and kidney, but also in brain and muscle, which have no gluconeogenic function. Furthermore, p29 is expressed in rat liver prenatally, whereas P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase is induced only after birth. The effect of p29 to protect P-enopyruvate carboxykinase against aerobic oxidation during in vitro incubation was also observed for ovalbumin and bovine albumin. Peptide sequencing of the p29 and search in a protein data bank revealed a high homology to the muscle-specific subunit of human phosphoglycerate mutase (EC 2.7.5.3). Determination of the enzyme activity confirms the identification of the p29 as the rat liver isoform of phosphoglycerate mutase. Taking all these findings together, it is concluded that this protein has no specific effect on P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase."
https://openalex.org/W1600086728,"Abstract Unlike skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum, canine cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum hydrolyzes GTP in ways that are similar and different from ATP hydrolysis. Also, ATP and ATP analogues inhibit GTPase activity noncompetitively with a Ki compatible with the high affinity ATP-binding site (c.f. Tate, C.A., Bick, R.J., Blaylock, S., Youker, K., Scherer, N.M., and Entman, M.L. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 7809-7813). This suggested that ATP and GTP may enter the reaction pathway at separate nucleotide-binding sites on the CaATPase. To test this hypothesis, cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum was incorporated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), which apparently binds at or near the ATP-binding site of the enzyme, preventing ATP binding. After FITC incorporation, calcium-dependent ATPase activity, but not GTPase activity, was completely inhibited. Adenyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (AMP-P(NH)P), but not guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate, protected against FITC incorporation and the inhibition of calcium-dependent ATPase activity; at least 100 microM AMP-P(NH)P was required for some protection. Despite FITC incorporation, AMP-P(NH)P still inhibited the GTPase activity with a Ki of 3-7 microM. Direct photo-affinity labeling with either 0.2 microM [alpha-32P]ATP or 0.2 microM [alpha-32P]GTP demonstrated that FITC incorporation did not prevent ATP or GTP binding. The mechanism of FITC inhibition of calcium-dependent ATPase activity was related to the prevention of all calcium-dependent, but not calcium-independent, reactions with both nucleotides."
