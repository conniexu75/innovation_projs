However, the signal-transducing events that connect ER stress to cell death pathways are incompletely understood. To discern the pathway by which ER stress-induced cell death proceeds, we performed studies on Apaf-1−/− (null) fibroblasts that are known to be relatively resistant to apoptotic insults that induce the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. While these cells were resistant to cell death initiated by proapoptotic stimuli such as tamoxifen, they were susceptible to apoptosis induced by thapsigargin and brefeldin-A, both of which induce ER stress. This pathway was inhibited by catalytic mutants of caspase-12 and caspase-9 and by a peptide inhibitor of caspase-9 but not by caspase-8 inhibitors. Cleavage of caspases and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase was observed in cell-free extracts lacking cytochrome c that were isolated from thapsigargin or brefeldin-treated cells. To define the molecular requirements for this Apaf-1 and cytochrome c-independent apoptosis pathway further, we developed a cell-free system of ER stress-induced apoptosis; the addition of microsomes prepared from ER stress-induced cells to a normal cell extract lacking mitochondria or cytochromec resulted in processing of caspases. Immunodepletion experiments suggested that caspase-12 was one of the microsomal components required to activate downstream caspases. Thus, ER stress-induced programmed cell death defines a novel, mitochondrial and Apaf-1-independent, intrinsic apoptotic pathway.

Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Perturbation of Ca2+ homeostasis, increased production of free radicals, inhibition of protein glycosylation, and accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER can all elicit cellular stress responses, particularly ER stress signals, to protect cells against changes in Ca2+ levels and toxic buildup of misfolded proteins (1Paschen W.

Prolonged ER stress leads to cell death and is linked to the pathogenesis of some neurodegenerative disorders that feature misfolded proteins, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (3Mattson M.P.

Neuron. 2001; 29: 15-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Activation of caspases, a family of cysteine proteases with aspartate P1 specificity, is a central mechanism in the apoptotic cell death process (5Alnemri E.S. Livingston D.J. Nicholson D.W. Salvesen G. Thornberry N.A. Wong W.W. Yuan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2129) Google Scholar). The extrinsic pathway of caspase activation involves signal transduction through cellular death receptors such as Fas, resulting in caspase-8 activation, which in turn activates downstream effector caspases such as caspase-3 and caspase-7 (6Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar). The intrinsic pathway involves release of the mitochondrial protein cytochrome c, which forms an oligomeric complex with dATP and Apaf-1 (7Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). It is this oligomeric complex that recruits procaspase-9 directly, activates it, and then releases active caspase-9 from the complex to set in motion the caspase-9-dependent activation of effector caspases such as caspase-3, -6, and -7 (6Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar, 8Zou H., Li, Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol.

Once active, the effector caspases cleave various cellular targets, including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (10Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2339) Google Scholar) and other substrates (6Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar), ultimately leading to cell death. Earlier studies have demonstrated a molecular link between ER stress and caspase-12 activation, resulting in increased cell death (11Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar, 12Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N., Li, E., Xu, J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J.

Ellerby H.M. Bredesen D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). However, the downstream targets of caspase-12 yet remain to be identified. Therefore, the question arose as to whether activation of downstream caspases and cell death following ER stress involves the previously described extrinsic pathway, the mitochondria-dependent intrinsic apoptotic pathway, or an alternate pathway (16Sperandio S. de Belle I. Bredesen D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14376-14381Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 17Leist M. Jaattela M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar).In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of ER stress-induced activation of caspases and cell death in Sak2 cells, which are Apaf-1 null cells (18Yoshida H. Kong Y.Y. Yoshida R. Elia A.J. Hakem A. Hakem R. Penninger J.M. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 94: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar, 19Cecconi F. Alvarez-Bolado G. Meyer B.I. Roth K.A. Gruss P. Cell. 1998; 94: 727-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Sak2 cells are generally more resistant to cell death initiated by various apoptotic agents, including those that utilize Fas or ceramide-mediated pathways (18Yoshida H. Kong Y.Y. Yoshida R. Elia A.J. Hakem A. Hakem R. Penninger J.M. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 94: 739-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar,19Cecconi F. Alvarez-Bolado G. Meyer B.I. Roth K.A. Gruss P. Cell. 1998; 94: 727-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that treatment of Sak2 cells with thapsigargin or brefeldin-A induces ER stress, activation of caspase-12, and cell death. ER stress-induced caspase-12-mediated cell death proceeds in a caspase-9-dependent pathway yet by a mechanism that is independent of the previously described intrinsic (mitochondria-dependent) apoptotic pathway (7Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar, 8Zou H., Li, Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar). ER stress-induced cell death was inhibited by catalytic mutants of caspase-12 and caspase-9 and by the peptide inhibitor of caspase-9 but not by inhibition of caspase-8. We also developed a cell-free model of ER stress-induced cell death that involves the addition of microsomes to a 300,000 × g cell-free extract that not only lacks Apaf-1 but also cytochrome c, both of which are required for activating caspase-9 and other downstream caspases through the previously described intrinsic apoptotic pathway. This system was capable of reproducing a key element of apoptosis, namely caspase processing and activation. Caspase-12 was identified as one of the microsomal components required for downstream caspase processing. Thus, ER stress-induced caspase-12 activation defines a novel, ER-based intrinsic pathway for apoptosome-independent effector caspase activation and cell death.DISCUSSIONApoptosis typically proceeds through one of two general signaling pathways, namely the extrinsic apoptotic pathway or the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. In the former case, binding of specific death ligands to their receptors causes oligomerization of death receptors, resulting in recruitment of adaptor molecules involved in activation of caspase-8. In the latter case, when the mitochondrion receives appropriate apoptotic signals, cytochrome c is released into the cytosol (6Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar, 32Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have shown that together with dATP and cytochrome c, Apaf-1 forms a multimeric complex that activates procaspase-9 (8Zou H., Li, Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar, 9Saleh A. Srinivasula S.M. Acharya S. Fishel R. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17941-17945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The formation of this complex occurs through a multistep process and serves as a key commitment step for activation of caspase-9 and downstream caspases. Caspase-9 activation and its release from the multimeric complex requires a fully functional Apaf-1 protein (8Zou H., Li, Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1783) Google Scholar, 9Saleh A. Srinivasula S.M. Acharya S. Fishel R. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17941-17945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Activated caspase-8 and caspase-9 in turn activate executioner caspases, including caspase-3. Cell death is thought to result from the proteolysis of cellular substrates by active caspase-3 and -7 (6Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar, 33Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5112) Google Scholar, 34Song Z. Steller H. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: M49-M52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). There has been some controversy over the role of mitochondria in apoptosis; it is believed by some that the primary apoptotic signals communicate directly with the cytosolic caspases, with the mitochondria contributing only a secondary role in the apoptotic process (35Finkel E. Science. 2001; 292: 624-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Therefore, in addition to Apaf-1 and cytochrome c, alternate mechanisms may be involved in the activation of procaspase-9.Like the mitochondria, the endoplasmic reticulum is a repository for both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic molecules. The known proapoptotic molecules include caspase-12 (11Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar, 12Nakagawa T. Zhu H.

Biol. 2000; 220: 76-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Despite the identification of these apoptotic regulators, the pathways that connect ER stress to apoptotic cell death remain unclear. Earlier reports indicated that ER stress induces the formation of a GRP78·procaspase-12·procaspase-7 complex (15Rao R. Peel A. Logvinova A. del Rio Guerra G. Hermel E. Yokota T. Goldsmith P. Ellerby L. Ellerby H.M. Bredesen D. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Prolonged stress can result in the disruption of this multimeric complex and the release of active caspase-12 that may activate caspase-9 and lead to apoptosis (14Rao R.V. Hermel E. Castro-Obregon S. del Rio G. Ellerby L.M. Ellerby H.M. Bredesen D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33869-33874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 15Rao R. Peel A.

Other activators of caspase-12 include the IRE1-TRAF2 complex (13Yoneda T. Imaizumi K. Oono K. Yui D. Gomi F. Katayama T. Tohyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13935-13940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar) and calpain (11Nakagawa T. Yuan J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar), both in response to ER stress. However, earlier studies have also suggested that calpains act as negative regulators of caspase processing by inactivating caspase-9 and -3 (41Chua B.T. Guo K. Li P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5131-5135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 42Lankiewicz S. Marc Luetjens C. Truc Bui N. Krohn A.J. Poppe M. Cole G.M. Saido T.C. Prehn J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17064-17071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Thus, while calpains may be required for caspase-12 activation, they may not have a role in the caspase cascade leading to cell death. Activation of caspase-12, by any of the above mechanisms, may therefore initiate downstream caspase processing, activation, and cell death. It is thus important to understand how the caspase-7/caspase-12 pathway differs from the calpain/caspase-12 pathway as well as the relevance of each of these pathways in ER stress-induced cell death. Studies employing calpain and caspase site-specific antibodies to caspase-12 may prove useful to elucidate these specific pathways.The present study was undertaken to characterize the biochemical pathway by which ER stress leads to apoptosis. The studies were carried out in Apaf-1−/− cells that are known to be relatively resistant to apoptotic insults that induce the intrinsic pathway. The cell-free extracts from these cells lacked mitochondria and cytochromec and thus provided a system to assess whether ER stress-mediated apoptosis is triggered by the activation of caspases without the involvement of the apoptosome. Our studies indicate that Apaf-1−/− cells are sensitive to ER stress inducers, undergo classical apoptosis, and possess features typical of caspase activation. Studies on whole cells, cell-free cytosolic extracts, and cell-free extracts containing primed microsomes suggest a role for caspase-12 in caspase-9 activation that is independent of Apaf-1 and mitochondria. Studies are in progress to identify other microsomal components that act in concert with caspase-12 to mediate ER stress-induced cell death.Whereas our studies rule out a requirement for cytochromec in the activation of caspases by ER stress, it is possible that prolonged ER stress may involve the concerted action of mitochondria and cytochrome c in caspase activation and cell death. In this context, several reports have demonstrated that thapsigargin induces cytochrome c release from mitochondria in murine and human cells (43Koya R.C. Fujita H. Shimizu S. Ohtsu M. Takimoto M.

However, in these studies, the activation of downstream caspases proceeded with the active involvement of cytochrome c and Apaf-1 (apoptosome). In the absence of Apaf-1, other modes of caspase activation may exist. The current studies involving caspase-12 highlight one such mechanism. In addition to our present work, other studies have also demonstrated alternative mechanisms for caspase activation in the absence of Apaf-1 and cytochrome c (16Sperandio S. de Belle I. Bredesen D.E.

However, earlier observations in HeLa cells (12Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N., Li, E., Xu, J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar), A549 human lung carcinoma cells (49Bitko V. Barik S. J. Cell.

The human caspase-12 like protein has a similar molecular mass as the mouse caspase-12 and exists as a phosphorylated protein. 2R. V. Rao, S. Castro-Obregons, H. Frankowski, M. Schuler, V. Stoka, G. del Rio, D. E. Bredesen, and H. M. Ellerby, unpublished data. Studies are in progress to further characterize and identify this protein, which may have a key role in ER stress and neurodegeneration. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 is a principal site for protein synthesis and folding and also serves as a cellular storage site for calcium (1Paschen W. Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Perturbation of Ca2+ homeostasis, increased production of free radicals, inhibition of protein glycosylation, and accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER can all elicit cellular stress responses, particularly ER stress signals, to protect cells against changes in Ca2+ levels and toxic buildup of misfolded proteins (1Paschen W.

Prolonged ER stress leads to cell death and is linked to the pathogenesis of some neurodegenerative disorders that feature misfolded proteins, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (3Mattson M.P.

The extrinsic pathway of caspase activation involves signal transduction through cellular death receptors such as Fas, resulting in caspase-8 activation, which in turn activates downstream effector caspases such as caspase-3 and caspase-7 (6Earnshaw W.C. Martins L.M. Kaufmann S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2428) Google Scholar). The intrinsic pathway involves release of the mitochondrial protein cytochrome c, which forms an oligomeric complex with dATP and Apaf-1 (7Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M.

It is this oligomeric complex that recruits procaspase-9 directly, activates it, and then releases active caspase-9 from the complex to set in motion the caspase-9-dependent activation of effector caspases such as caspase-3, -6, and -7 (6Earnshaw W.C.

Therefore, the question arose as to whether activation of downstream caspases and cell death following ER stress involves the previously described extrinsic pathway, the mitochondria-dependent intrinsic apoptotic pathway, or an alternate pathway (16Sperandio S. de Belle I.

https://openalex.org/W2096541685,"Mitochondria are key players of apoptosis and can irreversibly commit the cell to death by releasing cytochrome c (Cyt.c) to the cytosol, where caspases 9 and 3 subsequently get activated. Under conditions of oxidative stress, opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) represents an early trigger and is crucial in causing Cyt.c release. To account for the latter, current models propose that PTP gating would result, as is the case in vitro, in the rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane caused by mitochondrial matrix swelling. Using live cell imaging and recombinant fluorescent probes based on the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and its mutants, we report that directed repetitive gating of the PTP triggers a delayed Cyt.c efflux, which is not associated with mitochondrial swelling. Instead, subcellular imaging shows that PTP opening signals the redistribution of the cytosolic protein Bax to the mitochondria, where it secondarily forms clusters that appear to be a prerequisite for Cyt.c release. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging further reveals that Bax clustering coincides with the formation of Bax multimers. We conclude that the PTP is not itself a component of the Cyt.c release machinery, but that it acts indirectly by signaling Bax translocation and multimerization."

In vertebrate DNA cytosine residues are modified by cytosine-C5 methylation mainly at CG sequences (reviewed in Refs. 1Robertson K.D. Wolffe A.P. Nat. Rev.

Methylation is involved in epigenetic processes like gene regulation during the embryonic development and cell differentiation, genomic imprinting, and X-inactivation. By silencing the expression of repetitive sequences, DNA methylation protects the genome against selfish genetic elements and helps to maintain genomic integrity. Hypermethylation and hypomethylation of DNA contributes to cancerogenesis and tumor progression (reviewed in Refs. 4Jones P.A. Laird P.W. Nat.

Depending on the developmental state of the cell, the DNA methylation pattern either has to be created de novo, or the existing pattern of methylation has to be maintained. To accomplish this purpose, vertebrates contain a maintenance methyltransferase, Dnmt1, and de novo methyltransferases, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, although there is now evidence accumulating that the functions of these proteins overlap (8Okano M.

Dnmt1 is responsible for propagation of methylation pattern through cell generations by methylating the hemimethylated sites created after every round of replication.

Transgenic mice lacking Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, singly and in combination, are hypomethylated and die at embryonic stages (Dnmt3a−/−/Dnmt3b−/−, Dnmt3b−/−) or shortly after the birth (Dnmt3a−/−), indicating the critical role of these enzymes during the development (33Li E.

When combined, the results obtained with Dnmt3b−/− mice and ICF patients strongly suggest that Dnmt3b is responsible for methylation of minor satellite sequences like satellite 2 in vivo and that Dnmt3a cannot replace Dnmt3b in this function. In this work we investigate whether the isolated C-terminal domains of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are catalytically active DNA MTases. We characterize the enzymes and show that the enzymatic properties of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b might contribute to the functional specificity of Dnmt3b to methylate DNA at satellite 2 repeats in vivo and explain why Dnmt3a cannot substitute Dnmt3b in this function. Finally, we determined the catalytic activities of several Dnmt3b variants, which carry amino acid exchanges observed in ICF patients. Purified oligonucleotides were purchased from MWG (Ebersberg, Germany). Duplex oligonucleotides were prepared by annealing equimolar amounts of complementary strands. 30_GpC (Bt-GAAGCTGGGACTTCCGGGAGGAGAGTGCAA/TTGCACTCTCCTCCCGGAAGTCCCAGCTTC) contains one central CG site. To test for methylation of satellite sequences, we used SAT (Bt-CGAATGGTATCGAATGGAATCATCGAATA/TATTCGATGATTCCATTCGATACCATTCG), which has the consensus sequence of human satellite 2 repeats. The 33_2CpG oligonucleotide (Bt-TGGGACTTCCGGGAGCTTCCGGGAGGAGAGTG/CACTCTCCTCCCGGAAGCTCCCGGAAGTCCCA), a 33-mer that also has two CG sites was used as a control for CG methylation in a non-satellite sequence context. Murine Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b cDNA clones (Entrez accession numbers: AAC40177 and AAF74515) were kindly provided by Dr. En Li (Charlestown, MA). Catalytic domains (CD) of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b were cloned into pET28a as N-terminal His6 fusion proteins. CD-3b variants carrying the mutations identified in ICF patients (A609T, G669S, L670T, V726G, D823G, and V824M in mouse Dnmt3b) were prepared using a PCR megaprimer mutagenesis method (41Roth M.

The overexpressed proteins were purified over Ni-NTA agarose as described for the full-length Dnmt3a (12Gowher H. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In general, protein preparations were >90% pure. Protein concentration was quantified from A280 nm using calculated extinction coefficients for each protein. Western blots were carried out using an α-His6 tag antibody (Amersham Biosciences) according to the instructions of the supplier. DNA methylation was measured by the incorporation of tritiated methyl groups from labeled [methyl-3H]AdoMet (3048 GBq/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) into biotinylated oligonucleotides as described (43Roth M. Jeltsch A. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The methylation reactions were usually carried out at concentrations of 1 and 0.76 μm of DNA and labeled AdoMet, respectively, in methylation buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl) at room temperature using enzyme concentrations of 0.5–2 μm. The amount of radioactivity incorporated into 2 pmol of oligonucleotide substrate DNA was analyzed. Methylation of λ-DNA was analyzed by the DEAE filter binding assay using 300 ng of λ-phage DNA substrate at an enzyme concentration of 1 μm in 10 μl of methylation buffer. The reaction mixes were spotted on DEAE filters (Whatmann), which were washed five times with chilled 0.3 m ammonium bicarbonate solution, followed by a wash with 98% ethanol to remove water. The filters were dried and placed in scintillation fluid for the measurement of bound radioactivity. The methylation-dependent restriction protection analysis was performed using an 850-bp and a 430-bp fragment of the Dnmt3b gene as a target for methylation. These fragments contain 4 (3Cheng X.

A 50 nmconcentration of each PCR fragment labeled with [α-32P]ATP was incubated with enzyme in methylation buffer containing 100 μm AdoMet (Sigma). Aliquots were removed at defined times, and the reaction was stopped by addition of 3 volumes of ethanol. After precipitation, the DNA was dissolved in HhaI cleavage buffer (50 mm) potassium acetate, 20 mm Tris acetate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.9), and the samples were incubated with 10 units of HhaI for 1 h at 37 °C. Cleavage products were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel run in TPE buffer (80 mm Tris phosphate, 20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). The radioactivity was analyzed using an Instant Imager (Canberra Packard). Long and short versions of the Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b catalytic domains (CD-3a, CD-3b) were cloned as N-terminal His6 tag fusion proteins (Fig. 1). The proteins were overexpressed and purified over Ni-NTA-agarose to >90% as estimated from Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gels (Fig. 2). The identities of the proteins were confirmed by anti-His6antibody staining. The catalytic activity was determined by incorporation of tritiated methyl groups from [methyl-3H]AdoMet into the DNA using an unmethylated oligonucleotide substrate with a single CpG site. All the four proteins were enzymatically active. However, both Dnmt3a enzymes were about 2-fold more active their the Dnmt3b counterparts. This result is in agreement to the kinetic properties of the full-length enzymes (17Aoki A. Suetake I. Miyagawa J. Fujio T. Chijiwa T. Sasaki H. Tajima S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3506-3512Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Since the small version of CD-3a and the long version of CD-3b showed relatively higher activities, these proteins were used for most further investigations. The catalytic activity of the enzymes was tested at different salt concentrations and different pH, and the optimum activity was found at pH 7.0 in 20 mm HEPES buffer and at low KCl concentration (data not shown). We chose to use 100 mm KCl in our methylation buffer to stay close to physiological conditions.Figure 2Purification and catalytic activity of the large and small versions of the catalytic domains of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3B. The upper panel shows a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gel of the large and small versions of the catalytic domains of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b (CD-3aL, CD-3aS, CD-3bL, CD-3bS).

Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3784-3795Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 44Cheng X. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

World Scientific Publishing, Singapore1999: 283-340Crossref Google Scholar). It is in sharp contrast to the observation that the C-terminal part of Dnmt1 was repeatedly found not to be an active methyltransferase, although it harbors all the catalytic amino acid motifs characteristic for cytosine-C5 MTases (21Fatemi M. Hermann A. Pradhan S. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1189-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 29Zimmermann C. Guhl E. Graessmann A. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 297: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Since the catalytic domains of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b resemble prokaryotic DNA Mtases, which in general methylate DNA at defined recognition sequences, the preference of Dnmt3b for methylation at satellite 2 sequences could be due to an intrinsic preference of its catalytic domain for the nucleotide sequence of the satellite repeat. To test this model, a 29-mer oligonucleotide substrate was designed to have a consensus satellite 2 sequence. This substrate carried two centrally placed CG sites and one right at the end. As control the 33_2CpG substrate was employed that also carries two centrally placed CpG sites but in a random sequence context. As shown in Fig. 3, the catalytic domain of Dnmt3b clearly shows no preference for methylation at the satellite 2 sequence. Therefore, simple recognition of the satellite sequence cannot explain the in vivo role of Dnmt3b. The processivity of enzymatic turnover is an important mechanistic parameter for enzymes like DNA Mtases, which act on linear substrates containing several target site for the enzyme. Processive and distributive modes of DNA methylation can be distinguished on the basis that they result in a completely different distribution of unmodified, partially modified, and fully modified substrate molecules during the reaction. Processive methylation converts the unmodified substrate directly into fully modified products without allowing the intermediates to populate, whereas a distributive methylation leads to an accumulation of partially methylated DNA molecules as reaction intermediates. We checked the processivity of DNA methylation by CD-3a and CD-3b using two substrates varying in length, one 850-mer and one 430-mer. We investigated the protection of a these DNA fragments against HhaI digestion by CG methylation. The 430-bp substrate DNA contains three HhaI sites. HhaI cleavage of the 430-mer can result in up to 10 different fragments (four substrate cleavage fragments, five intermediates, one full-length fragment), eight of which can be observed in polyacrylamide gels. As shown in Fig. 4, CD-3a methylates the 430-mer in a distributive fashion. There is a continuous increase in the amount of the partially methylated DNA during the time course of the reaction, and fully protected DNA is only observed after almost complete disappearance of the substrate cleavage fragments. This reaction profile clearly shows that CD-3a treats each target site independently and is mechanistically distributive as already shown by us for the Dnmt3a full-length protein (12Gowher H. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In contrast, not many intermediates appear after methylation of the same fragment by CD-3b, and large amounts of fully protected DNA and substrate cleavage fragments are present at the same time in the reaction mixture. Therefore, CD-3b appears be much more processive than CD-3a. Similar results were obtained with an 850-mer that contains 5 HhaI and 27 CG sites (data not shown). This difference in the reaction mechanism of CD-3a and CD-3b was observed with different enzyme preparations and also with a buffer containing no KCl. It is not due to the fact that we used the long version of the catalytic domain of Dnmt3b and the short version of Dnmt3a for these experiments, because similar experiments with the longer version of Dnmt3a also showed a distributive reaction mechanism (data not shown), and also the full-length Dnmt3a enzyme methylates DNA in a distributive fashion (12Gowher H. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). To analyze the processivity of DNA methylation of both enzymes in more quantitative terms, we determined the relative amounts of all fragments in methylation reactions with CD-3a and CD-3b (Fig. 4 and Supplemental Fig. 1) (in Supplemental Fig. 1 the relative amounts of all the different species are shown, in Fig. 4 the amounts of all substrate cleavage fragments and all intermediates are added to obtain a graph the is less complicated). The data were fitted to a model, which uses six different rate constants to describe the reactions: three distributive rate constants (k1, methylation at site 1; k2, methylation at site 2; and k3, methylation at site 3), two partially processive ones (k12, coupled methylation at sites 1 and 2;k23, coupled methylation at sites 2 and 3), and one fully processive one (k123, coupled methylation at all three sites). It should be noticed that this model does not make any initial assumptions on the degree of processivity of the methylation reaction. Both reaction profiles could be nicely fitted (Fig. 4 and Supplemental Fig. 1) yielding the following rate constants for CD-3a: k1, 3.1 × 10−2min−1; k2, 8.6 × 10−3 min−1; k3, 2.4 × 10−2 min−1;k12, 0 min−1;k23, 6.2 × 10−4min−1; k123, 0 min−1. This result shows that CD-3a methylates DNA in an almost completely distributive reaction, because 99% of the activity is assigned to k1, k2, and k3 and only 1% to a coupled methylation of two sites (k23). This outcome confirms the qualitative interpretation of the gel figures that CD-3a works in an almost purely distributive manner. For CD-3b a completely different result was obtained: k1, 0 min−1;k2, 0 min−1;k3, 6.3 × 10−3min−1; k12, 0 min−1;k23, 2.9 × 10−3min−1; k123, 0.12 min−1. Here 93% of the total activity is assigned to k123, which corresponds to a processive methylation of all three sites. Similar results were obtained in repeated analyses, where processive activity of CD-3a never went beyond 5%, and processivity of CD-3b never was below 80%. As the 430-mer contains nine CG sites, and the three HhaI sites are a representative subset of all the CG sites, our results mean that CD-3b methylates all nine CG sites on the 430-mer processively. Since almost complete processivity of DNA methylation also was observed with the 850-mer, we conclude that CD-3b is able to methylate at least 27 CG sites without dissociating from the DNA. These analyses also show that the total activity of CD-3b (0.36 sites/min) is much higher than that of CD-3a (0.06 site/min) with the macromolecular substrate, although with oligonucleotides that contain only one target site, CD-3a is about 2-fold more efficient. This result clearly demonstrates that a processive reaction mechanism accelerates methylation of macromolecular substrates, which contain more than one target site. Specific point mutations have been mapped in the DNMT3B gene of ICF patients, which are located in or close to the catalytic domain of the Dnmt3b protein (34Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E.

Here we investigated the biological activity and intracellular signaling of S1P on human dendritic cells (DC), which are specialized antigen presenting cells with the ability to migrate into peripheral tissues and lymph nodes, as well as control the activation of naive T cells. We show that immature and mature DC express the mRNA for different S1P receptors, such as endothelial differentiation gene (EDG)-1, EDG-3, EDG-5, and EDG-6. In immature DC, S1P stimulated pertussis toxin-sensitive Ca2+ increase actin-polymerization and chemotaxis. These responses were lost by DC matured with lipopolysaccharide. In maturing DC, however, S1P inhibited the secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin (IL)-12, whereas it enhanced secretion of IL-10. As a consequence, mature DC exposed to S1P showed a reduced and increased capacity to generate allogeneic Th1 and Th2 responses, respectively. In summary, our study implicates that S1P might regulate the trafficking of DC and ultimately favor Th2 lymphocyte-dominated immunity."

These studies indicate that targeted repression involves recruitment of active HDACs to promoter sequences via heterologous DNA-binding protein factors. Although such findings have established the importance of HDAC recruitment to DNA through specific DNA-binding complexes, little is understood about how the assembly or deacetylase activity of these complexes is regulated. Phosphorylation is a prominent post-translational mechanism for controlling enzyme activities, localization, and protein interactions. Recent studies have begun to reveal mechanisms for regulating activities of HDAC complexes by signal-dependent phosphorylation. For example, phosphorylation of pRb by cyclin D/cdk4 negatively regulates the interaction of pRB complexes with HDACs (35Harbour J.W. Luo R.X. Dei Santi A. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of the MEF2 transcription factor by calmodulin-dependent kinase inhibits interaction with HDACs 4 and 5 (36Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Nicol R.L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4070-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In addition, HDAC4 and 5 are phosphorylated at three sites that control their cytoplasmic localization and interaction with 14-3-3 proteins (37Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7835-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 38Wang A.H. Kruhlak M.J., Wu, J. Bertos N.R. Vezmar M. Posner B.I. Bazett-Jones D.P. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6904-6912Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Most recently, HDAC1 has been reported to be a phosphoprotein, and mutation of identified sites reduces enzymatic activity (39Cai R. Kwon P. Yan-Neale Y. Sambuccetti L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 445-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 40Pflum M.K. Tong J.K. Lane W.S. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47733-47741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In this study we have extended such observations by examining alterations in HDAC1 and 2 activities and complex formation after induction of phosphorylation. Here we show that HDAC1 and 2 are basally phosphorylated in resting cells and hyperphosphorylated in response to inhibition of protein phosphatase by okadaic acid (OA). Phosphorylation of HDAC2 is also observed in mitotically arrested cells and appears to be regulated by protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). Reversal of hyperphosphorylation in vitro leads to a small but significant reduction in deacetylase activity, indicating that phosphorylation positively regulates HDAC specific activity. Importantly, treatment of cells with OA disrupts complex formation between HDAC1 and HDAC2, and between HDAC1 and mSin3A or YY1. These findings indicate that phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms disrupt HDAC and repressor complexes, suggesting potential control of targeted transcriptional repression by phosphorylation.

K562 cells were grown in Spinner cultures at 37 °C, 5% CO2 at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml in RPMI (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and penicillin. MCF10A and WM35 cells were grown on 10-cm plates in 10% fetal calf serum, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and penicillin. Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of OA (Alexis) dissolved in Me2SO, and control treatments received the same volume of Me2SO. Other cell treatments used cycloheximide at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml, taxol at a final concentration of 400 ng/ml, nocodazole at 500 ng/ml, or thymidine at 2 mm(Sigma). The acetylation state of K562 histones under these conditions was described previously (1Galasinski S.C. Louie D.F. Gloor K.K. Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2579-2588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Histones were prepared as deacetylase substrates by in vivo radiolabeling for 16 h in the presence of 5 mm sodium butyrate and 100 mCi/ml [3H]acetic acid. Histones were isolated from 2.5 × 107 cells following the method of Johns (42Johns E.W. Biochem. J. 1967; 105: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested by centrifugation (2,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 1% sodium deoxycholate, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 100 μm Na2MoO4, 1 mmNa3VO4, 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm benzamidine). Lysates were prepared by 20 strokes in a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer followed by three 20-s pulses of sonication on ice. Pellets were collected by centrifugation (17,000 × g, 10 min), resuspension in buffer B (8 M urea, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% Triton X-100), and incubation for 10 min at room temperature. After centrifugation (17,000 × g, 10 min), the loose, viscous pellet was transferred to a new tube, and 0.1× volume of 0.3n HCl was added, followed by incubation at 4 °C with vortexing for 1 h. The insoluble pellet was separated from the supernatant by centrifugation (17,000 × g, 10 min). Histones and chromatin-associated proteins were precipitated from the supernatant by the addition of 10 volumes of cold acetone and incubation overnight at –20 °C. Proteins were collected by centrifugation (17,000 × g, 10 min). The pellets were lyophilized and resuspended in 100 μl of 10 mm HEPES (pH 8.0) with protease inhibitors. The histone H4 peptide (representing NH2-terminally acetylated H4 residues 2–19; Ac-NH-S-G-R-G-K-G-G-K-G-l-G-K-G-G-A-K-R-H-R-COOH; bold indicates acetylation sites) was synthesized (Research Genetics) and purified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. The peptide was chemically acetylated in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), with 25 mCi of [3H]acetic anhydride, layered with argon, and incubated 10 h at 4 °C. Unreacted [3H]acetate was removed by two passes through a G10 desalting column (Bio-Rad, 180 × 1 cm). The purified peptide substrate was lyophilized and resuspended in 10 mm HEPES (pH 8.0). Stoichiometric acetylation (4 mol/mol) was verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and acetylation of lysines was confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry sequencing (data not shown). 8 × 107cells were treated with 1,000 nm OA or Me2SO for 2 h, harvested, resuspended in 10 ml of column buffer (25 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 8.0), 1.5 mm EGTA, 100 μm Na3VO4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A), and lysed with 10 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer and three 20-s pulses of sonication. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation (55,000 × g for 15 min), and supernatants were loaded at 0.5 ml/min onto a Mono Q HR5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) preequilibrated in column buffer. Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1–0.4 mNaCl in column buffer and collected in 180 1-ml fractions. Conductivity was measured in every fifth fraction to verify consistency in gradients among different runs. Deacetylase assays were carried out using 30 μl of fractionated extract or immunoprecipitated material and 10 μg of 15,000–20,000 dpm 3H-acetylated mixed histones or 100,000 dpm 3H-acetylated histone H4 peptide in a final volume of 50 μl. Reactions were carried out for 2 h at 37 °C and stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 0.1 m acetic acid and 700 μl of ethyl acetate. Samples were vortexed and centrifuged (17,000 × g, 5 min), and the organic layer containing released [3H] acetate was removed and counted. Some reactions were inhibited by preincubation in 500 nmtrichostatin-A (TSA) (Wako) for 10 min at 4 °C before the deacetylase assays. Reaction time courses confirmed linearity of deacetylase initial rate measurements (data not shown). Antibodies to HDAC1 (H-51, rabbit polyclonal), HDAC2 (H-54, rabbit polyclonal), mSin3A (K-20, rabbit polyclonal) and YY1 (H-10, mouse monoclonal) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies to RbAp46/48 were a kind gift from Dr. Alain Verrault. Immunoprecipitations were carried out with 1 × 107 cells that were harvested, washed, and lysed in RIPA buffer (100 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 100 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μmNa3VO4, 1 μm OA, and protease inhibitors). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation (17,000 ×g, 15 min), and immune complexes were formed by the addition of 1–2 μg of antibody and 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose (AmershamBiosciences) to the supernatants, followed by nutation at 4 °C for 16 h. Immune complexes were isolated by centrifugation and washed three times with 1 ml of RIPA buffer and twice with 1 ml of 10 mm HEPES (pH 8.0). Low bisacrylamide gels (acrylamide:bisacrylamide 29:0.1) were used to enhance the gel mobility retardation resulting from phosphorylation. For Western blotting, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore), blocked for 1 h in 3% nonfat milk, and incubated with primary antibodies (1:1,000 dilution) followed by a 1-h incubation with goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000 dilution) (Jackson Laboratories). After extensive washing, blots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminmSscence (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions were desalted using 1-ml Sephadex G-50 columns, or alternatively, immunoprecipitated material was exchanged into 10 mm HEPES (pH 8.0) plus protease inhibitors. Dephosphorylation reactions contained calf alkaline intestinal phosphatase (Promega), λ-phosphatase (Invitrogen), PP1, or PP2A (Promega) at 5, 200, 0.5, and 10 units/reaction, respectively, and were carried out for 30 min at 30 °C. Control reactions contained the same phosphatases that had been inactivated by heating at 90 °C for 15 min. MnCl2 or MgCl2, which were inhibitory to deacetylase activity, were omitted from reactions. Immunoprecipitations were washed twice with 1 ml of RIPA buffer and twice with 1 ml of 10 mm HEPES (pH 8.0) before deacetylase activity assays. After treating K562 cells for 2 h with 1 μm OA, clarified cell extracts were fractionated by anion exchange chromatography, and fractions were assayed for rate of deacetylation of 3H-acetylated histones. The histone deacetylase activity eluted in four peaks (P3–P6) from control extracts and four peaks (P10–P13) from OA-treated extracts (Fig. 1 A). The reproducible variation in elution of peaks between control versusOA-treated cells suggested that inhibiting intracellular phosphatase activity alters the pI of deacetylase complexes through changes in protein composition and/or covalent modification. Furthermore, integrating the total amount of deacetylase activity over the whole profile showed a 30% increase in the total amount of deacetylase activity from OA-treated extracts compared with controls. Fractions were next assayed for deacetylase activity using an3H-acetylated peptide substrate corresponding to residues 2–19 of histone H4. The peptide substrate revealed differences in activity between cell treatment conditions that were not observed using histone proteins (Fig. 1 B). For example, fraction 8 from control and OA-treated samples (P1 and P7, respectively) showed little difference in deacetylase activity toward acetylated histones but significantly increased activity toward the acetylated peptide in OA-treated samples, suggesting that histone H4 is a preferred substrate for OA-sensitive deacetylases. Use of the peptide substrate also revealed new peaks corresponding to P2 in control fractions and P8 and P9 in OA fractions (Fig. 1 B). Comparison of activity profiles in Fig. 1, A and B, showed that for the most part, similar deacetylase peaks were detected with both protein and peptide substrates but with enhanced activity toward the H4 peptide. To confirm that these measurements reflected deacetylase activities, each peak was tested for inhibition by the deacetylase inhibitor TSA (Fig. 2). The activities in P2–P6 and P8–P13 were inhibited by at least 10-fold with TSA, indicating that each peak contains TSA-sensitive deacetylases. Peaks P1 and P7 were inhibited only 2-fold, indicating that the enhanced release of [3H]acetate in P7 compared with P1 is partly the result of TSA-sensitive deacetylase and partly different enzymes. Peak P12 showed higher activity after desalting (compare Fig. 1 B with Fig. 2), which most likely reflects salt inhibition of deacetylase activity in this pool. HDAC1 and 2, which represent major deacetylase forms, were detected by Western blotting in all peaks except P1 and P7 (Fig. 3). This implies that HDAC1 and 2 are found in distinct complexes separable by ion exchange chromatography. Importantly, in peaks P2–P6 and P8–P13 the HDAC1:HDAC2 ratios were constant, and the total reactivities of HDAC1 + HDAC2 were proportional to the deacetylase activities in each pool, measured in Fig. 2. Fractions outside of the major activity peaks showed little or no reactivity with anti-HDAC1 or 2 (data not shown). In Western blots, increased reactivity of both HDAC1 and 2 was observed in the OA-treated fractions (peaks P8–P13) compared with controls (peaks P2–P6), although cell numbers and extract volumes were equal between experiments. It was unlikely that a 2-h treatment with OA increased HDAC expression, therefore we investigated the possibility that OA affected the solubility of HDACs and their subsequent recovery from cell lysates. Immunoblots in Fig. 4show recovery of HDAC1 and 2 from control versus OA-treated cells after lysis, Dounce homogenation, sonication, and separation of soluble versus insoluble proteins by centrifugation. Although significant amounts of HDAC1 and 2 remained insoluble in control cell extracts (Fig. 4 A), both enzymes were completely recovered in soluble pools after treatment of cells with OA (Fig. 4 B). The insoluble pool of HDACs in controls most likely represents enzyme that remained tightly bound to chromatin or nuclear matrix proteins, as reported previously (40Pflum M.K. Tong J.K. Lane W.S. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47733-47741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Thus, the increased deacetylase activity observed in fractionated extracts of OA-treated cells was at least partly the result of increased solubility and recovery, indicating reduced interactions of HDACs with chromatin or matrix. After OA treatment (Figs.3 and 4) HDACs 1 and 2 migrated as doublets, reminiscent of gel mobility changes caused by post-translational modification. Because OA enhances protein phosphorylation, we examined whether HDACs were phosphorylated in intact cells. HDAC1 and 2 were immunoprecipitated from control or OA-treated cells, treated with a mixture of PP1, calf alkaline intestinal phosphatase, and λ-phosphatase and analyzed by Western blotting. Negative controls were performed by treating immunoprecipitates with buffer alone or with the same phosphatase mixture that was heat-inactivated at 90 °C for 15 min. Phosphatase treatment of HDAC1 caused a small reduction in mobility not observed in negative controls (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 5 versus lanes 1, 3, 4, and 6), suggesting that phosphorylation increases the gel mobility of HDAC1. In addition, HDAC1 from OA-treated cells migrated slightly faster than from control cells (Fig. 5, compare lanes 3 and 4). These data indicate three phosphorylation states of HDAC1, corresponding to basally phosphorylated (lanes 1 and 3), hyperphosphorylated (lanes 4 and 6), and dephosphorylated (lanes 2 and 5) forms of HDAC1. Phosphatase treatment resulted in faster mobility of HDAC2 from control immunoprecipitations (Fig. 5, lane 2 versus lanes 1 and 3) and collapse of the doublet in the OA-treated sample into a single, faster migrating band (Fig. 5, lane 5 versus lanes 4 and 6). HDAC2 from control and OA samples migrated identically after phosphatase treatment. These data indicate basally phosphorylated, hyperphosphorylated, and dephosphorylated states of HDAC2 (Fig. 5). Taken together, the experiments demonstrate that both HDAC1 and 2 are phosphoproteins that are phosphorylated under basal conditions and undergo increased phosphorylation after OA treatment. The regulated HDAC phosphorylation was characterized further by assaying changes in gel mobility in varying cellular states. Phosphorylation of HDAC2 occurs in the presence of cycloheximide (Fig. 6 A, lane 2), indicating that protein synthesis is not required and that the kinase(s) involved are expressed prior to OA treatment. Significant hyperphosphorylation of HDAC2 was also apparent within 1 h of treatment with OA and increasing over 3 h (Fig. 6 B, lanes 1–4), and dephosphorylation occurred upon removal of OA and exchange into fresh medium (Fig. 6 B, lanes 5 and 6). This indicates that hyperphosphorylation is rapid and reversible in vivo. Similar gel mobility shifts of HDAC2 were also observed in MCF10A breast epithelial cells and WM35 melanoma cells (Fig. 6 C), indicating that the response to OA is general to several cell types. Varying cell cycle conditions were examined for regulated HDAC phosphorylation in the absence of OA. K562 cells were synchronized at the G1/S boundary by double thymidine arrest or in prometaphase with the microtubule poisons nocodazole and taxol. Mitotic arrest resulted in hyperphosphorylation of HDAC2, although no change in HDAC1 mobility was observed (Fig. 6 D, lanes 3 and 4). No effect on mobility of either enzyme was observed in thymidine-treated cells arrested in G1/S (Fig. 6 D, lane 2). Thus, spindle checkpoint activation provides a physiological stimulus that leads to significant hyperphosphorylation of HDAC2. The OA concentration range used in these experiments is known to inhibit both PP1 and 2A (40Pflum M.K. Tong J.K. Lane W.S. Schreiber S.L. J. Biol.

Acta. 1992; 1130: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), thus it was likely that either or both enzymes are involved in HDAC regulation. To test sensitivities to specific phosphatases, HDAC1 and 2 were"

Cultured on a three-dimensional clinostat, ML-1 cells formed three-dimensional MCTSs (MCTS diameter: 0.3 +/- 0.01 mm). After 24 and 48 h of clinorotation, the cells significantly decreased fT3 and fT4 secretion but up-regulated the thyroid-stimulating hormone-receptor expression as well as the production of vimentin, vinculin, and extracellular matrix proteins (collagen I and III, laminin, fibronectin, chondroitin sulfate) compared with controls. Furthermore, ML-1 cells grown on the clinostat showed elevated amounts of the apoptosis-associated Fas protein, of p53, and of bax but showed reduced quantities of bcl-2. In addition, signs of apoptosis became detectable, as assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP digoxigenin nick end labeling, 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining, DNA laddering, and 85-kDa apoptosis-related cleavage fragments. These fragments resulted from enhanced 116-kDa poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) activity and apoptosis. These observations suggest that clinorotation elevates intermediate filaments, cell adhesion molecules, and extracellular matrix proteins and simultaneously induces apoptosis in follicular thyroid cancer cells. In conclusion, our experiments could provide a regulatory basis for the finding that astronauts show low thyroid hormone levels after space flight, which may be explained by the increase of apoptosis in thyrocytes as a result of simulated 0g."

Serial analysis of gene expression in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs), monocytes, and macrophages revealed that 7 of the 19 C-type lectin mRNA were present in immature DCs. Two of these, the macrophage mannose receptor and the macrophage lectin specific for galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine (MGL), were found only in immature DCs, as confirmed by reverse transcriptase-PCR and flow cytometric analysis. By subcloning and sequencing the amplified mRNA, we obtained nucleotide sequences encoding seven different human MGL (hMGL) subtypes, which were apparently derived from alternatively spliced mRNA. In addition, the hMGL gene locus on human chromosome 17p13 contains one gene. A single nucleotide polymorphism was identified at a position in exon 3 that corresponds to the cytoplasmic region proximal to the transmembrane domain. Of all the splicing variants, the hMGL variant 6C was expressed at the highest levels on immature DCs from all donors tested. Immature DCs could incorporate α-GalNAc-modified soluble acrylamide polymers, and this was significantly inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with an anti-hMGL monoclonal antibody that blocks the lectin-carbohydrate interaction.

The uptake of exogenous antigens is the first step in this process and is therefore a critical event that influences DC function. The uptake of glycoconjugates by DCs is potentially mediated by lectins, which are carbohydrate-binding proteins. There are at least four distinct lectin families in animal cells known as the C-type, S-type, P-type, and I-type lectins (2Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Some lectins are known to participate in molecular and cellular trafficking in a manner that is dependent on the lectin type, its molecular architecture, and its subcellular localization. DCs are known to express a variety of lectins, particularly C-type lectins, but as yet their biological roles in DC function are unclear. dendritic cell antigen-presenting cell carbohydrate-recognition domain fetal calf serum fluorescein isothiocyanate monoclonal antibody(s) macrophage colony-stimulating factor granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor macrophage C-type galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine-specific lectin human MGL macrophage macrophage mannose receptor peripheral blood mononuclear cell reverse transcriptase-PCR serial analysis of gene expression dendritic cell antigen-presenting cell carbohydrate-recognition domain fetal calf serum fluorescein isothiocyanate monoclonal antibody(s) macrophage colony-stimulating factor granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor macrophage C-type galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine-specific lectin human MGL macrophage macrophage mannose receptor peripheral blood mononuclear cell reverse transcriptase-PCR serial analysis of gene expression How glycosylated antigen presentation is regulated and how this affects the subsequent immune responses has not yet been clarified. This is an important issue to investigate as it may improve our understanding of, for example, anti-tumor immunity to MUC1. MUC1 is a glycosylated membrane protein that frequently expresses truncated O- glycans such as the T (Galβ1–3GalNAc-Thr/Ser) and Tn (GalNAc-Thr/Ser) antigens. MUC1 is an important candidate vaccine antigen as it is an antigen that is often overexpressed in solid tumors, including carcinoma of the breast, lung, pancreas, colon, and ovaries. MUC1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes have been isolated from draining lymph nodes of pancreatic and breast cancer patients, ascitic fluids of ovarian cancer patients, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of multiple myeloma patients (3Barnd D.L.

Nakagawa N. Imai K. Yachi A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2102-2109PubMed Google Scholar). It is important to understand how this naturally acquired MUC1-specific immune response is raised as this might allow us to optimize MUC1 immunization strategies for cancer immunotherapy. Thus, how glycosylated antigens are recognized by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), how they are taken up by lectin-dependent pathways, and how these antigens can be processed and presented with MHC molecules are all important issues that deserve investigation. A unique C-type lectin specific for clusters of galactose and/or N-acetylgalactosamine has been identified in mice (7Sato M. Kawakami K. Osawa T. Toyoshima S. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), rats (8Ii M. Kurata H. Itoh N. Yamashina I. Kawasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11295-11298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and humans (9Suzuki N. Yamamoto K. Toyoshima S. Osawa T. Irimura T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 128-135PubMed Google Scholar). This molecule has been denoted the macrophage (MØ) galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine (Gal/GalNAc)-specific C-type lectin (MGL). Molecular cloning and characterization of both the human and murine MGLs revealed that MGL is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein with a single extracellular C-type carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (7Sato M. Kawakami K. Osawa T. Toyoshima S. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 9Suzuki N. Yamamoto K. Toyoshima S. Osawa T. Irimura T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 128-135PubMed Google Scholar). MGL is unique among the mammalian lectins because its capacity for carbohydrate recognition has been extensively examined. MGL can recognize carbohydrate-bearing terminal Gal/GalNAc residues, especially clusters of truncated O- linked carbohydrate chains such as the T and Tn antigen in mucins (9Suzuki N. Yamamoto K. Toyoshima S. Osawa T. Irimura T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 128-135PubMed Google Scholar, 10Yamamoto K. Ishida C. Shinohara Y. Hasegawa Y. Konami Y. Osawa T. Irimura T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8159-8166Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Recombinant human MGL (hMGL) was able to bind to a glycopeptide highly glycosylated with truncated carbohydrate chains derived from a mucin (11Iida S. Yamamoto K. Irimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10697-10705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Such carbohydrate binding capacity would provide MGLs with a dual function as a recognition molecule and as an endocytic receptor for glycosylated antigens. Supporting its role as a recognition molecule are our previous studies that showed that MGL+ cells bound to and captured malignant cells via a lectin-carbohydrate interaction (12Kawakami K. Yamamoto K. Toyoshima S. Osawa T. Irimura T. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1994; 85: 744-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 13Sakamaki T. Imai Y. Irimura T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 57: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In tumor-bearing mice, endogenous cells expressing MGL and an adoptively transferred T-cell line expressing MGL both accumulate in a tumor site-selective manner (14Imai Y. Akimoto Y. Mizuochi S. Kimura T. Hirano H. Irimura T. Immunology. 1995; 86: 591-598PubMed Google Scholar, 15Ichii S. Imai Y. Irimura T. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1997; 62: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This accumulation could be partially inhibited by the administration of an anti-murine MGL antibody that blocks MGL-carbohydrate interactions (16Ichii S. Imai Y. Irimura T. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 2000; 49: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition MGL-mediated recognition may also participate in cell migration. When hapten or organic solvents are administered epicutaneously, murine MGL+ cells in the dermis disappear rapidly from the application site (17Mizuochi S. Akimoto Y. Imai Y. Hirano H. Irimura T. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 18Sato K. Imai Y. Irimura T. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6835-6844PubMed Google Scholar, 19Chun K.H. Imai Y. Higashi N. Irimura T.

Such MGL+ cell migration has also been observed in response to interleukin-1β or irritant stimulation, and this could be suppressed by the administration of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that blocks the carbohydrate binding of MGL. It is possible that MGL recognizes extracellular matrices or stromal cells and thus regulates migration in the body. With regard to the second role of MGL as and endocytic receptor for Gal/GalNAc-modified proteins, MGL+ cells and MGL-transfected cells have been shown to internalize glycosylated proteins via MGL-dependent endocytosis (12Kawakami K. Yamamoto K. Toyoshima S. Osawa T. Irimura T. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1994; 85: 744-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 21Ozaki K., Ii, M. Itoh N. Kawasaki T. J. Biol.

Supporting this proposed function of MGL is the fact that MGL and its rat counterpart contain in their cytoplasmic regions the tyrosine motif that is required for interaction with clathrin-coated vesicles and thus endocytosis (7Sato M. Kawakami K. Osawa T. Toyoshima S. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 8Ii M. Kurata H. Itoh N. Yamashina I. Kawasaki T. J. Biol.

Given these dual roles, MGL may facilitate both the close contact with tumor cells and the subsequent uptake of glycosylated tumor antigens by DCs if it is expressed on these cells. Thus, the identification of MGL is an important goal, as it should help to understand the regulatory mechanism of the immune system and aid the development of vaccination protocols. We report here the identification of MGL on various potential APCs in humans by serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) (22Hashimoto S.I. Suzuki T. Nagai S. Yamashita T. Toyoda N. Matsushima K. Blood. 2000; 96: 2206-2214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Hashimoto S. Suzuki T. Dong H.Y. Nagai S. Yamazaki N. Matsushima K. Blood. 1999; 94: 845-852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hashimoto S.

Matsushima K. Blood. 2000; 96: 2584-2591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MGL and the macrophage mannose receptor (MMR) were found to be expressed exclusively on immature DC as far as the cell populations we tested. The MGL on immature DCs was observed to act as an endocytic receptor. Spliced MGL variants in immature DCs were also identified and their relative frequencies in the cells determined. The possibility that targeting MGL by attaching Gal/GalNAc residues to a candidate antigen might improve specific antigen presentation by DCs and thus improve vaccine immunogenicity is discussed. PBMCs were isolated from venous blood drawn from normal healthy volunteers at the Tokyo Metropolitan Red Cross Blood Center (Tokyo, Japan) (24Hashimoto S. Suzuki T. Dong H.Y. Yamazaki N. Matsushima K. Blood. 1999; 94: 837-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, PBMCs were isolated by centrifugation on a Ficoll-Metrizoate density gradient (d = 1.077 g/ml; Lymphoprep, Nycomed, Oslo, Norway) and suspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 7.5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) (Invitrogen; The FCS contained <3 pg/ml of lipopolysaccharide as assessed by a Limulus amoebocyte assay), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. To purify monocytes, the PBMCs were incubated with an anti-CD14 mAb-coated microbeads and then passed through a magnetic cell separation system (MACS, Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) with column-type VR. The cell suspensions were then aliquotted into plastic tissue culture plates and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2 to obtain highly purified cells. More than 99% of the cells were monocytes as determined by their morphology, positive staining with a CD14 mAb (LeuM3, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA), and nonspecific esterase staining (24Hashimoto S. Suzuki T. Dong H.Y. Yamazaki N. Matsushima K. Blood. 1999; 94: 837-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MØs were prepared from the CD14+ monocytes by culturing them for 7 days in RPMI 1640 medium with 7.5% FCS and 100 units/ml of M-CSF (Morinaga Milk Industry Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) or 500 units/ml of GM-CSF (Kirin Brewery Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The purity of the MØ cell population was confirmed by morphology and flow cytometric analysis using specific markers as described in a previous article (24Hashimoto S. Suzuki T. Dong H.Y. Yamazaki N. Matsushima K. Blood. 1999; 94: 837-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immature DCs were prepared from the CD14+ monocytes by culturing them for 7 days in RPMI 1640 medium containing 7.5% FCS, 500 units/ml of GM-CSF (Kirin Brewery Co.), and 100 units/ml of interleukin-4 (Ono Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Mature DCs were induced from immature DCs by culturing them for 48 h in RPMI 1640 medium containing 7.5% FCS and lipopolysaccharide (100 μg/ml). Expression of DC cell surface markers was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis with mAbs to the following antigens: CD86 (2331; PharMingen, San Diego, CA), CD1a (HI 149; PharMingen), HLA-DR (4C3; PharMingen), CD80 (MAB104; Coulter, Fullerton, CA), CD83 (HB15a; Coulter), and CD33 (B8.12.2; Immunotech, Marseille, France). Down-regulation of CD14 was detected with an anti-CD14 mAb (M5E; PharMingen). The flow cytometric analyses were performed with the Epics Elite (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) (23Hashimoto S. Suzuki T. Dong H.Y. Nagai S. Yamazaki N. Matsushima K. Blood. 1999; 94: 845-852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA from monocytes, MØs, and monocyte-derived DCs obtained from at least six donors was isolated by direct lysis in RNAzol B (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX). Poly(A) RNA were isolated using the FastTrac mRNA purification kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The SAGE was performed as described (26Velculescu V.E. Zhang L. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1995; 270: 484-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (3544) Google Scholar, 27Velculescu V.E. Zhang L. Zhou W. Vogelstein J. Basrai M.A. Bassett D.E., Jr. Hieter P.

Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 276: 1268-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar). SAGE libraries were generated using 2.5 μg of poly(A) RNA, which was converted to cDNA with an Invitrogen synthesis kit following the manufacturer's protocol, with the inclusion of primer biotin-58-T18–38. The cDNA was cleaved with NlaIII restriction enzyme, and the 38-terminal cDNA fragments were bound to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway). After ligation to oligonucleotides containing recognition sites for BsmF1, the linked cDNAs were released from the beads by BsmF1digestion. The released tags were ligated to one another, concatemerized, and cloned into the SphI site of pZero, version 1.0 (Invitrogen). Colonies were screened with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using M13 forward and M13 reverse primers. PCR products containing inserts that were greater than 400 bp were sequenced with the TaqFS Dye terminator kit and analyzed using a 377-ABI automated sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All electropherograms were reanalyzed by visual inspection to check for ambiguous bases and to correct misreadings. Sequence files were analyzed with the SAGE software, CGAP SAGE data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SAGE/), the NCBI's sequence search tool (Advanced BLAST search, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/), and DNAsis software (Takara, Shiga, Japan). After the elimination of linker sequences and the repeated ditags, a total of 261,256 tags, which included 57,560, 57,463, 55,856, 58,540, and 31,837 tags from monocytes, GM-CSF-induced MØs, M-CSF-induced MØs, immature DCs, and mature DCs, respectively, were analyzed (22Hashimoto S.I.

Total RNAs (200 ng) were prepared using RNAzol B. The RNA was reverse-transcribed in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 6.5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 10 mmdithiothreitol, each dNTP at 1 mm, 2 μmrandom hexamer, and 2.4 units/μl Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase for 1 h at 42 °C. cDNA, corresponding to 40 ng of total RNA, was boiled for 3 min and quenched on ice before amplification by PCR. The PCR was performed in a 20-μl reaction with each primer at 0.15 μm, dGTP, dATP, dCTP, and dTTP each at 200 μm (Amersham Biosciences), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1.5 mmMgCl2, and 0.1 μl of Ampli Taq polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Tokyo). The PCR primers used were: hMGL, sense 5′-TCATCTGTGTGGTTGGATTCCA-3′ and antisense 5′-GCATAGTCTGTTCCATCCACCC-3′; adenylyl cyclase-associated protein, sense 5′-GCACTGTTCGCGCAGATTAA-3′ and antisense 5′-ACAATGCCCACCACGTCAT-3′. Reaction mixtures were incubated in a PerkinElmer DNA Thermal Cycler (33 cycles, denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 58 °C for 45 s, extension at 72 °C for 60 s). PCR was performed in a 20-μl solution containing 2 μl of template cDNA from monocytes, MØs, or DCs, 2 μl of 10× buffer, 2 μl of 2.5 mm each dNTP, 1 unit of Ampli Taq polymerase, and 0.5 μm hMGL primers (sense, 5′-AATCACACCCTCCAGACCTCCC-3′; and antisense, 5′-TCCCACCAAAGGCAGCTCAGTG-3′). The PCR was performed with 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at for 58 °C, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. The amplified products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels. Bands corresponding to the products were recovered and ligated into the pGEM-T-easy vector. Competent Escherichia coli cells of the JM109 strain were transformed with the ligated constructs and plated onto 2× YT ampicillin plates for colorimetric selection. The subcloned nucleotides were sequenced by the dideoxy method. mAbs were raised against recombinant hMGL that was derived from cDNA encoding the putative extracellular region of hMGL as described (9Suzuki N. Yamamoto K. Toyoshima S. Osawa T. Irimura T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 128-135PubMed Google Scholar). Soluble recombinant hMGL purified by affinity chromatography on a column of galactose-Sepharose 4B was mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant and injected intraperitoneally in BALB/c mice. After repeated immunization, the splenocytes were fused with SP2/0 myeloma cells by addition of polyethylene glycol in a standard protocol. Ten hybridomas producing antibody to recombinant hMGL were established. mAb MLD-1 was identified as a mAb that blocks the carbohydrate recognition of MGL. The mAb MLD-1 was then obtained as ascites, purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation and affinity chromatography with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and used in the present work. Labeling of mAb MLD-1 with digoxigenin was carried out with the digoxigenin protein-labeling kit according to the manufacturer's procedure (Pierce). Flow cytometric analysis of MGL expression on DCs was performed using mAb MLD-1. DCs were incubated first with 50 μg/ml mAb MLD-1 or control IgG1 (mAb 91.9H) for 60 min on ice, then with diluted (1/100) biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse IgG+A+M for 60 min, and finally with diluted (1/100) FITC-streptavidin for 30 min. The staining was analyzed on an EPICS XL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). FITC-conjugated soluble polyacrylamide polymers were obtained from Glycotech (Rockville, MD). Immature DCs were harvested and suspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS (1.5 × 105 cells/100 μl). The cells were incubated with the mAb MLD-1 (5 μg/100 μl) for 30 min at 4 °C and then mixed with FITC-conjugated soluble polyacrylamide polymers (α-GalNAc or β-GlcNAc polymers, 1 μg/100 μl) and incubated at 37 °C for 120 min. The cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5 mm EDTA to detach the soluble polyacrylamide polymers on the cell surface and were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Uptake of the FITC-labeled soluble polyacrylamide polymers was analyzed on an EPICS XL flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter). Similar experiments were performed with DCs in Lab-Tek chamber slides (catalog no. 153437, Nalge Nunc Int. Corp., Naperville, IL). Here, DCs adhering in the wells were incubated for 120 min, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1m phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and observed by confocal microscopy (MRC-1024, BioRad). The mRNA expression frequencies of candidate endogenous lectins in monocytes, MØ, and DCs prepared from human PBMCs were determined by SAGE. Results were obtained from 57,560 monocyte tags, 57,463 GM-CSF-induced MØ tags, 55,856 M-CSF-induced MØ tags, 58,540 immature DC tags, and 31,837 mature DC tags derived from six donors. The expression frequency of mRNAs for the lectins was normalized and quantified as shown in Table I. Among the lectins analyzed, two were found to be specifically expressed in immature DCs, namely, the MMR and the macrophage lectin specific for galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine (hMGL). Five other lectins, namely, CLECSF6 (DCIR), CLECSF12 (dectin-1), DC-SIGN, CD23, and CD94, were also preferentially expressed on immature DCs, but they were also expressed in other cells of the same lineage, albeit to a less extent.Table ISAGE analysis of endogenous lectinsLectinsMonocytesGM-CSF M⊘sM-CSF M⊘sImmature DCsMature DCsSAGE tagUniGene clusterDEC-20500017AAGGAAAGTG153,563M⊘ mannose receptor, C-type 1000170TGCAGAAGAA75,182Langerin00000AATTCACCTT199,731DC-SIGN003170CCTCACTACC278,694hMGL00080AAGGTATAAT54,403CLECSF100000GTCACGGAAG287,364CLECSF220000AGAGGGAGTG85,201CLECSF5, MDL-100000TGACATCAGC126,355CLECSF6, DCIR702240AGTCTCTCTT115,515CLECSF12, dectin-1330151TGCTGATTTG161,786CD23002201GATACAGCCA1,416CD62L, L-selectin70300CAATTTTGCA82,848CD6920000CATTTGCACT82,401CD9444285ACTGTAATCC41,682asialoglycoprotein receptor 100000ACCAAGGAGT12,056asialoglycoprotein receptor 200000GTCTGCTTCA1,259endocytic receptor (M⊘ mannose receptor family)00110GCCCTTTCTC7,835Scavenger receptor with C-type lectin,00200GAGCCAAAGA29,423Stem cell growth factor; lymphocyte secreted C-type lectin00110GGGCTCGGGG105,927Man-6-P receptor (cation-dependent)21815712GCTCCACTGG75,709Sialoadhesin00217CTCCATTGCC31,869CD3311170GAAAACACCA83,731Ficolin 124431300CCCACAACCT252,136Ficolin 310000GACACCGAGG333,383Galectin 19817022576127GCCCCCAATA198,261Galectin 2120341TCCTCTTTCA113,987Galectin 3291802116916TTCACTGTGA621Galectin 800204GCACCCACAC4,082Galectin 99138712CTCAGTCCCC81,337CLECSF, C-type lectin superfamily member; Man-6-P, mannose-6-phosphate.

The SAGE tags for DC-SIGNR and CLECSF9 correspond to multiple proteins, and therefore the observed expression cannot be considered to represent these lectins exclusively. Although MMR and MGL are both C-type lectins, their molecular architectures are distinct. MMR has been well characterized as being an endocytic receptor on DCs (29Sallusto F. Cella M. Danieli C. Lanzavecchia A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar, 30Avrameas A. McIlroy D. Hosmalin A. Autran B. Debre P. Monsigny M. Roche A.C. Midoux P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) whereas the expression profiles and functions of MGL were unknown. The SAGE analysis clearly showed that MGL expression occurs exclusively in immature DCs. However, as the analyzed mRNA specimens were derived from at least six volunteers, it was not clear whether all humans express MGL in their immature DCs. It is possible that the positive MGL tags could have been derived from only one donor because of genetic polymorphism or a subclinical disease. To confirm that MGLs are expressed in immature DCs in at least the majority of human individuals, we performed RT-PCR and flow cytometric analyses on the various APC populations from three individuals. The RT-PCR analysis showed that all three individuals had MGL mRNA expression in their immature DCs and that this expression was lacking in mature DCs and monocytes. Interestingly, however, the PCR-amplified products were heterogeneous in size. All five individuals showed a major band at the position of 530 bp and a minor band at the position of 610 bp. In addition, immature DCs derived from six donors examined by flow cytometric analysis using an anti-MGL mAb all expressed MGL protein on their cell surface. Thus, hMGL is expressed at the mRNA and protein levels in immature DCs from all subjects examined (Fig. 1). The diversity of the PCR-amplified products suggested that at least two different subtypes of hMGL are expressed in the immature DC preparation. To identify these hMGL subtypes, we recovered the PCR-amplified products, subcloned them into the pGEM-T-easy vector, and determined their nucleotide sequences. We obtained nucleotide sequences encoding seven different hMGL subtypes that result from various deletions at three potential deletion sites, namely, either a 81-bp deletion in the neck domain, a 9-bp deletion at the beginning of the CRD, or a 12-bp deletion inside the CRD. As discussed further below, the human genome has only one hMGL, and thus the heterogeneity of the PCR-amplified products reflects alternatively spliced mRNAs that encode hMGL. The nucleotide structures of the seven variants are indicated in Fig. 2 B. This shows that three of the variants, namely, hMGL(8A), -(6A/8A), and -(6C/8A), apparently differ from the others in their CRDs in that four amino acids are missing. The frequencies of each of the seven hMGL mRNA species in the immature DCs from five individuals was determined by sequencing a number of PCR-amplified products ligated into the"

We have investigated the involvement of caspase-9 in the UV death effector pathway in human keratinocytes, since this is the initiating caspase in the mitochondrial pathway required for UV-induced apoptosis in some, but not all, cell types. UV radiation triggered activation of caspase-3, caspase-9, and caspase-8 with similar kinetics, although the rank order of activation was caspase-3 > caspase-9 > caspase-8. Inhibition of caspase-9 with either the peptide inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Glu(OCH3)-His-Asp(OCH3)-fluoromethyl ketone, or expression of a catalytically inactive caspase-9 by retroviral transduction, protected normal keratinocytes from UV-induced apoptosis. HaCaT keratinocytes harboring mutant p53 alleles were also protected from UV-induced apoptosis by the dominant negative caspase-9. The dominant negative caspase-9 blocked UV-induced activation of caspase-3, caspase-9, and caspase-8, and also protected cells from the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. In contrast, the dominant negative caspase-9 did not protect from anti-Fas-induced apoptosis or caspase activation. These results identify caspase-9 as the critical upstream caspase initiating apoptosis by UV radiation in human keratinocytes, the relevant cell type for this important environmental carcinogen.

These results identify caspase-9 as the critical upstream caspase initiating apoptosis by UV radiation in human keratinocytes, the relevant cell type for this important environmental carcinogen. The induction of programmed cell death, or apoptosis, by UV radiation is an important protective mechanism from neoplastic transformation for the skin. UV radiation from the sun is the main environmental carcinogen responsible for the formation of basal and squamous cell carcinomas, the most common human cancer types (1Kraemer K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Epidermal keratinocytes are efficiently protected from the mutagenic effect of UV by undergoing apoptosis; however, prior sun exposure, which causes mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene, or expression of antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, prevents apoptosis and leads to increase skin cancer incidence (2Rodriguez-Villanueva J.

Understanding the molecular and cellular regulation of UV-induced apoptosis is thus a major focus of skin carcinogenesis research. UV radiation has multiple cellular targets that trigger different signaling cascades leading to apoptosis. UV radiation is a DNA-damaging agent that activates a p53-dependent apoptotic response (1Kraemer K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The role of the death receptor pathway in UV apoptosis in keratinocytes has also been supported by irradiation of cells at 10 °C to inhibit receptor clustering and by expressing a dominant negative FADD to prevent coupling of death receptors to initiator caspases such as caspase-8. Both of these approaches to block death receptor signaling provided partial protection from UV-induced apoptosis in keratinocytes (17Aragane Y. Kulms D. Metze D. Wilkes G. Poppelmann B. Luger T.A.

Embryonic stem cells and fibroblasts require caspase-9 for UV apoptosis, whereas thymocytes and splenocytes lacking caspase-9 are still sensitive to UV (24Hakem R. Hakem A. Duncan G.S. Henderson J.T. Woo M. Soengas M.S. Elia A.X. Pompa J.L. Kagi D. Khoo W. Potter J. Yoshida R. Kaufman S.A. Lowe SW Penninger J.M. Mak T.W.

Given this cell type specificity, it is critical to evaluate the role of caspase-9 in UV-induced apoptosis in relevant cell types. To this end, we have evaluated the role of caspase-9 in UV apoptotic signaling in human keratinocytes using peptide and dominant negative inhibitors of caspase-9. We have also assayed the activity of multiple caspase following UV exposure to better understand the relationships among different caspases in the caspase activation cascade. Our results indicate that caspase-9 activation is a major determinant of UV-induced keratinocyte apoptosis independent of p53 status and reveals potential positive feedback regulation between caspase-3 and caspase-8. For Western detection and immunofluorescence staining of procaspase-9, rabbit polyclonal antibody 9502 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) was used. For Western analysis of procaspase-9 processing, the cleavage-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody 9501S (Cell Signaling) was used. Protein kinase Cδ was detected with rabbit polyclonal antibody sc-937 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). For induction of apoptosis in keratinocytes via activation of Fas receptor, 5 μg/ml of cyclohexamide (CHX 1The abbreviations used are: CHXcyclohexamideCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidDTTdithiothreitolD/Ndominant negativePKCδprotein kinase CδAFCamino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarinZ-LEHD-FMKbenzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Glu(OCH3)-His-Asp(OCH3)-fluoromethyl ketone ; Sigma) and an anti-Fas IgM antibody at 100 ng/ml (CH11; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) were used. For caspase assays, the fluorogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-AFC (for caspase-3), Ac-IETD-AFC (for caspase-8), and Ac-LEHD-AFC (for caspase-9) (Enzyme Systems Products, Livermore, CA) were prepared as 20 mm stock in Me2SO. cyclohexamide 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid dithiothreitol dominant negative protein kinase Cδ amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Glu(OCH3)-His-Asp(OCH3)-fluoromethyl ketone Normal human epidermal keratinocytes were isolated from neonatal foreskin following routine circumcision, as previously described (25Mitra R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 29995-30002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). After isolation, the cells were cultured in Medium 154 CF (Cascade Biologics, Inc., Portland, OR) containing 0.07 mm CaCl2, human keratinocyte growth supplement, and penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B (Medium 154) until they reached 40–50% confluence. For expansion, the cells were trypsinized with 0.03% trypsin, 0.01% EDTA and plated in Medium 154. Each experiment was performed on the cells isolated from a single foreskin and were used at passages 1–2. The immortalized human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT, which has two mutant p53 alleles, was kindly provided by Dr. Norbert Fusening (German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany) and was also grown in Medium 154 (27Boukamp P.

Keratinocytes were irradiated with a Panelite Unit (Ultralite Enterprises, Inc., Lawrenceville, GA) equipped with four UVB bulbs (FS36T12/UVB-VHO), which have the majority of their output in the UVB range (∼65%), with minor output in the UVA and UVC wavelengths (∼34 and 1%, respectively). The cells were exposed with the dish lids removed, with a 30 mJ/cm2 dose requiring about 1 min of exposure. The UV dose was monitored with an International Light Inc. (Newburyport, MA) radiometer fitted with a UVB detector. For experiments with the caspase-9 peptide inhibitor, 10 μmZ-LEHD-FMK (catalog no. FK-022; Enzyme System Products, Livermore, CA), was added to cells immediately after UV exposure. For anti-Fas induction of apoptosis, the cells were pretreated with the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX at 5 μg/ml for 2 h before anti-Fas antibody was added at 100 ng/ml to the medium. CHX pretreatment was necessary to get significant induction of apoptosis in keratinocytes (29Qin J.Z. Chaturvedi V. Denning M.F. Choubey D. Diaz M.O. Nickoloff B.J. J. Biol.

Before making the protein extract, floating cells were collected and combined with cells growing on the dish and washed two times with cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were lysed in 2× caspase lysis buffer: 25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol. Cell lysates were spun for 3 min in a microcentrifuge, and a Bradford protein assay was performed on the supernatant. 50 μg of total protein was mixed with 2× caspase assay buffer: 25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 5 mm DTT and a 100 μm concentration of one of the following caspase fluorogenic substrates: Ac-DEVD-AFC (for caspase-3), Ac-IETD-AFC (for caspase-8), and Ac-LEHD-AFC (for caspase-9). After incubation at 37 °C for 3 h, the fluorometric detection of cleaved AFC product was performed on a CytoFluor Multi-Well Plate Reader Series 4000 (PerSeptive Biosystems) using a 400-nm excitation filter and a 530-nm emission filter. For preparation of the AFC calibration curve, 80 μm free AFC was diluted in the caspase assay buffer without substrate to give 1.6, 3.2, and 4.8 μmol of free AFC, and fluorescence was measured on the fluorometer. For the in vitro caspase-8 activation assays, 50 ng of caspase-3 (catalog no. 201-038-C005; Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA), 50 μg of total protein and 100 nm caspase-9 Z-LEHD-FMK peptide inhibitor were used. The caspase-9 dominant negative (D/N) cDNA containing a mutation of Cys287 to Ser, (C287S) cloned in EcoRI/XhoI sites of pMARX IVrPuro (31Fearnhead H.O. Rodriguez J. Govek E.E. Guo W. Kobayashi R. Hannon G. Lazebnik Y.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13664-13669Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. Yuri A. Lazebnik (Cold Spring Harbor, NY). For construction of the episomal retroviral expression vector containing the caspase-9 D/N cDNA, two primers (cgf, 5- AGCTCGGATCCACTAGTAACGGCCGCC-3 containing a BamHI site (underlined), and cgf2, 5-ATAGTTAGCGGCCGCATTAAGTTTAAACGGGCCCTC-3, containing a NotI site (underlined)) were used to amplify the cDNA, and the PCR product after restriction digestion and purification was cloned into the BamHI/NotI sites of the retroviral vector LZRS-Linker (32Kinsella T.M. Nolan G.P. Hum. Gene Ther. 1996; 7: 1405-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). After cloning, the insert was verified by sequencing, and the presence of the C287S mutation was confirmed. For production of retrovirus, the LZRS-caspase-9 D/N DNA was transfected into the Phoenix-Ampho retroviral packaging cell line using calcium phosphate as described (30Qin J.Z. Bacon P. Chaturvedi V. Nickoloff B.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 117: 898-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Packaging cells were selected and expanded in the presence of 1 μg/ml puromycin, and virus was harvested from confluent dishes cultured for 24–48 h at 32 °C. For infection, keratinocytes were plated in six-well dishes at 105/well, and the following day viral supernatant was added in the presence of 4 μg/ml polybrene (hexadimethrine bromide; Sigma). The cells were infected by spinning the plates at 300 ×g for 1 h at 32 °C, and the viral supernatants were replaced with fresh Medium 154. The day after infection, cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline and fed with Medium 154. For the caspase assay, infected cells were expanded for 2 days by plating them in p60 dishes. For immunofluorescence, cells were grown on glass coverslips, and 1 day after infection, they were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in −20 °C acetone/methanol (1:1) for 10 min. The cells were stained with human caspase-9 primary antibody (9502; Cell Signaling) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (1:250) with normal goat serum (1:20 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature, washed with FA buffer (Difco), and incubated with secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibody at 1:40 dilution. Cells were washed in FA buffer and mounted in 40% polyvinyl alcohol (molecular weight 300–70,000) in glycerol containing 100 mg/ml 1,4-diazabicyclo octane to reduce fading of the fluorescence. The cells were viewed with an Olympus AX80 fluorescence microscope. Apoptosis was routinely measured by determining DNA content of cells by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry, as previously described (26Denning M.F. Wang Y. Nickoloff B.J. Wrone-Smith T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29995-30002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were trypsinized, fixed with ethanol, and stained with propidium iodide before being analyzed on a Coulter Epics XL-MCL flow cytometer. Cells with DNA content less than the G1 amount of untreated cells were considered apoptotic. Mitochondria membrane potential was measured by rhodamine 123 fluorescence (33Shapiro H.M. Methods. 2000; 21: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Cells were trypsinized and incubated for 20 min in 1 ml of room temperature medium containing 5 μmrhodamine 123. The cells were then washed and analyzed on a Coulter Epics XL-MCL flow cytometer for reduced rhodamine 123 fluorescence, indicating loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. The protein samples were loaded on 8.5 or 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane BA83 (Schleicher and Schuell). Protein bands were visualized with Ponceau S staining, and the membrane was blocked in 5% nonfat powdered milk in TBS (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). The membrane was incubated with the primary antibody in 2.5% powdered milk in TBS, washed extensively with TBS, and then incubated with 1:1000 diluted secondary anti-rabbit or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody (AmershamBiosciences). The membrane was washed with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h. Bands were visualized with ECL (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To determine the relative extent and kinetics of caspase activation in response to UV radiation, normal human keratinocytes were exposed to 30 mJ/cm2 UV light, and the activities of caspase-3, -8, and -9 measured using specific fluorogenic substrates. Fig. 1A shows the kinetics of these caspase activities. The induction of all three caspases begins 6–9 h after UV exposure. At 18 h after UV exposure, the activities of caspase-9, caspase-3, and caspase-8 were induced 4.8-, 21.7-, and 2.2-fold, respectively (Fig. 1A). Caspase-3 was the only effector caspase assayed and was activated to the greatest extent. Between the two initiator caspases (caspase-9 and caspase-8), caspase-9 activity increased more, suggesting that the intrinsic pathway plays a predominant role in UV–induced apoptosis. To determine the role of caspase-9 in UV-induced apoptosis, we used two approaches to block its activity. One was the treatment of cells with the specific irreversible peptide inhibitor Z-LEHD-FMK; the other was expressing a dominant-negative form of caspase-9. Fig. 1B shows that in keratinocytes treated with the caspase-9 peptide inhibitor, UV-induced apoptosis was inhibited 66%, as measured by sub-G1 DNA. Using a caspase-9 D/N retrovirus, we were able infect normal keratinocytes and detect expression of the dominant negative form of the caspase-9 protein in the majority of cells by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2A). Protein expression was confirmed by Western blot with the major 47-kDa procaspase-9 band detected (Fig. 2B). Higher molecular weight protein bands detected on the blot may represent aggregated caspase-9. Keratinocytes expressing the caspase-9 D/N appeared resistant to UV-induced cell death by morphology (Fig. 3A) and were 81% resistant to UV-induced apoptosis by sub-G1 DNA content (Fig. 4, A and B). Caspase-9 D/N-infected HaCaT cells, which have mutant p53 genes, show the same level of protection as normal keratinocytes (Figs.3B and 4C). These results indicate that caspase-9 activation is a required component of the UV death effector pathway in keratinocytes, independent of p53 status.Figure 3Caspase-9 D/N expression protects normal human keratinocytes and HaCaT cells from UV-induced morphological cell death. Keratinocytes were infected with either LZRS-Linker control virus or LZRS-caspase-9 D/N (LZRS-C9 D/N) virus. Two days after infection, cells were exposed to 30 mJ/cm2 of UV light. 18 h after UV exposure, cells were photographed.

We have used rhodamine 123 as a molecular probe to assay the mitochondrial membrane potential in keratinocytes expressing caspase-9 D/N and exposed to UV. As shown in Fig. 5, normal keratinocytes and HaCaT cells are protected from losing mitochondrial membrane potential by caspase-9 D/N expression (p < 0.05 for both cell types). The protection was 77% for both normal keratinocytes and HaCaT cells. To determine whether caspase-9 D/N expression was blocking the activation of caspases in cells following UV exposure, we assayed caspase activity in UV-irradiated keratinocytes infected with either Linker or caspase-9 D/N virus. The proteolytic activities of caspase-3, -8, and -9 were more than 87% inhibited in keratinocytes expressing caspase-9 D/N protein (Fig. 6A), and the inhibition of each caspase was statistically significant (p < 0.01). Western blot analysis of caspase-9 D/N-infected keratinocytes showed that caspase-9 is cleaved following UV exposure (Fig. 6B) but not catalytically activated due to the C287S mutation (Fig. 6A). Cleaved caspase-9 was also detected in the caspase-9 D/N-expressing cells, and cleavage was increased further by UV (Fig. 6B). PKCδ is a downstream substrate of caspase-3 (26Denning M.F. Wang Y.

Med. 1996; 184: 2399-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) and was not proteolytically processed in caspase-9 D/N-infected cells after UV irradiation (Fig. 6B, bottom panel). The caspase assays in Fig. 6A demonstrated inhibition of UV-induced caspase-8 activity in caspase-9 D/N-infected cells. This was unexpected, since caspase-8 is an initiator caspase, and its activation is not reported to be dependent on caspase-9. One possible explanation of this data is that caspase-3 may be able to activate procaspase-8, and the caspase-9 D/N protein blocked processing and activation of procaspase-3, thereby preventing activation of procaspase-8. To explore this possibility, we tested whether recombinant, catalytically active caspase-3 can activate procaspase-8 in vitro and whether this procaspase-8 activation can be blocked by caspase-9 inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 7, the addition of recombinant caspase-3 to normal protein extracts and to protein extracts from caspase-9 D/N-expressing keratinocytes activated caspase-8 2.8- and 2.3-fold, respectively. The presence of specific caspase-9 peptide inhibitor Z-LEHD-FMK or caspase-9 D/N protein in the assay did not affect the procaspase-8 activation by caspase-3. These results demonstrate that caspase-3 can directly or indirectly activate caspase-8 independent of caspase-9. These results also validate the specificity of our caspase assays, since no caspase-8 activity was detected in the recombinant caspase-3 preparation, and the peptide caspase-9 inhibitor (Z-LEHD-FMK) did not reduce the activity of caspase-8 (Ac-IETD-AFC cleavage). To determine whether caspase-9 D/N virus can protect from apoptosis induced by death receptor stimulation (30Qin J.Z. Bacon P. Chaturvedi V. Nickoloff B.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 117: 898-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we used CHX plus an anti-Fas antibody (CH11) to induce apoptosis. Morphological examination of the cells expressing caspase-9 D/N protein and stimulated with anti-Fas showed no protection from apoptosis (data not shown). The level of apoptosis was also assayed by DNA staining and flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 8A, although caspase-9 D/N protected keratinocytes from UV-induced apoptosis (81% inhibition), cells were not protected from anti-Fas-induced apoptosis by the caspase-9 D/N protein. We also measured the specific activities of caspases in this experiment. Treatment of keratinocytes with CHX and anti-Fas antibody caused 6.1-fold induction of caspase-3, 1.1-fold induction of caspase-8, and no induction of caspase-9 activity (Fig. 8B). All three caspase activities were unaffected by the presence of caspase-9 D/N for anti-Fas-induced apoptosis, in contrast to UV-induced apoptosis, where they were all inhibited (Figs.6A and 8B). Thus, the caspase-9 D/N protein does not block anti-Fas-induced apoptosis or caspase activation. We undertook this study to determine the involvement of caspase-9 activation in apoptosis induced by UV in human epidermal keratinocytes. UV initiates two major proapoptotic signaling pathways involving either death receptor activation, which couple to the activation of initiator caspases such as caspase-8, or DNA damage/cell stress, which activates the initiator caspase-9 via the intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway (36Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar,37Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the selectivity for the initiator caspase-9 and caspase-8 activation by either the mitochondrial or death receptor apoptotic pathway, respectively (38Sun X.M. MacFarlane M. Zhuang J. Wolf B.B. Green D.R. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5053-5060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar), we analyzed caspase activation during UV-induced apoptosis in human keratinocytes. The activities of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 were all induced with similar kinetics following UV irradiation, with significant increases in activity detected 6–9 h after exposure (Fig. 1A). Caspase-3 was activated by far the greatest, and we attribute its large activation to its being an effector caspase at the end of a caspase cascade that amplifies the proteolytic activation of caspases. Caspase-8 consistently had the highest basal activity; however, caspase-9 was activated more than caspase-8 by UV radiation, suggesting a stronger upstream signal for caspase-9 activation. It is unclear why there is a delay of up to 6 h before caspase activation, but this delay is consistent with a series of events, such as gene transcription or apoptosome complex formation, occurring prior to activation of the caspase cascade. The delayed onset of caspase activation may also reflect the relatively slow zymogen activation of procaspase-9 relative to procaspase-8 (39Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10964-10967Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Taken together, the delayed activation of caspases and the greater activation of caspase-9 relative to caspase-8 suggest that UV primarily signaling through the intrinsic pathway rather than the death receptor pathway. The dramatic inhibition of UV-induced apoptosis by both the Z-LEHD-FMK peptide caspase-9 inhibitor (Fig. 1B) and the caspase-9 D/N (Figs. 3, 4, and 8A) strongly suggest that caspase-9 is the dominant upstream caspase in UV keratinocyte apoptosis. The caspase-9 D/N virus afforded >80% protection from UV-induced apoptosis (Figs.4, B and C, and 8A) but did not protect from anti-Fas apoptosis (Fig. 8A), demonstrating high efficacy and specificity. Transient transfection of a dominant negative FADD into keratinocytes to preferentially block the death receptor signaling resulted in only modest (30–40%) protection from UV-induced apoptosis (17Aragane Y. Kulms D. Metze D. Wilkes G. Poppelmann B. Luger T.A. Schwarz T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). The caspase-9 D/N blocked many UV-induced apoptotic endpoints, including morphological cell death (Fig. 3), sub-G1 DNA (Figs. 4 and 8A), loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 5), caspase activation (Fig. 6A), and cleavage of death substrates (Fig. 6B). None of the endpoints measured were blocked during anti-Fas-induced apoptosis (Fig. 8). The ability of the caspase-9 D/N to block UV apoptosis in HaCaT cells indicates that this pathway is p53-independent, at least in cell culture. This is relevant to skin photocarcinogenesis, where many premalignant lesions have mutant p53 and are thought to be relatively resistant to UV apoptosis. While UV radiation triggered activation of caspase-3, -9, and -8, the expression of caspase-9 D/N protein led to almost complete inhibition of all three caspase activities induced by UV, consistent with data from cell-free extracts demonstrating caspase-9-dependent activation of multiple caspases (Fig. 6A) (40Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of protein used in the caspase assay with an antibody specific for cleaved caspase-9 revealed the cleavage of procaspase-9 after UV in Linker virus-infected cells and in both unexposed and UV-exposed caspase-9 D/N-expressing cells (Fig. 6B). Despite the cleavage of procaspase-9 detected in all LZRS-C9 D/N virus-infected keratinocytes, caspase-9 activity was not observed, verifying the catalytic inactivity of the C287S mutant caspase-9 (Fig. 6A). We demonstrated that caspase-9 D/N was selective for the intrinsic death effector pathway by its inability to block apoptosis induced by CHX/anti-Fas (Fig. 8A). The inability of caspase-9 D/N to block anti-Fas-induced apoptosis was not due to inhibition of caspase-9 D/N protein synthesis by CHX, since CHX did not reduce the levels of caspase-9 D/N protein significantly over the course of these experiments (data not shown). Although CHX/anti-Fas treatment induced caspase-3 activation, which was not blocked by caspase-9 D/N expression, we did not detect activation of either caspase-8 or caspase-9 (Fig. 8B). The lack of caspase-8 activation is surprising, since Fas is coupled to caspase-8 via the adaptor protein FADD (41Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1999; 281: 1305-1308Crossref Scopus (5169) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism of caspase-3 activation following anti-Fas treatment in our system is unclear, but it may involve activation of other potential initiator caspases such as caspase-10, which contains two death effector domains homologous to those found in caspase-8 and could potentially substitute for caspase-8 (42Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4146) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6A, expression of caspase-9 D/N also blocked the induction of caspase-8 activity by UV. This was unexpected, since the caspase-9 D/N should not interfere with caspase-8 activation via death receptors and did not prevent anti-Fas-induced apoptosis (Fig. 8A). One possible explanation is that the caspase-8 activation seen following UV exposure is not due to death receptor activation but results from activation of other caspases that are dependent on caspase-9, such as caspase-3. To explore this possibility, we determined whether procaspase-8 could be activated by recombinant catalytically active caspase-3 in vitro (Fig. 7). Activation of caspase-8 activity by recombinant caspase-3 in vitro was 2–3-fold in our experiments and was not blocked by the caspase-9 peptide inhibitor or in lysates from caspase-9 D/N-expressing cells. Theoretically, caspase-8 (isoform A) has a potential caspase-3 cleavage site at position DEAD398↓, and cleavage at this site would generate fragments in good agreement with the sizes of known caspase-8 cleaved products (18 and 43 kDa) (43Grenet J. Teitz T. Wei T. Valentine V. Kidd V.J. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 226: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 7also validate the specificity of our caspase assays, since no caspase-8 activity (Ac-IEDT-AFC cleavage) was detected in the recombinant caspase-3-alone assay (second bar), and the caspase-9 inhibitory peptide Z-LEHD-FMK did not inhibit caspase-8 activity. In some cells, cross-talk exists between the death receptor and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways. For example, cleavage of BID by caspase-8 can promote cytochrome c release (44Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3798) Google Scholar), and mitochondria are required for amplification of caspase-8-initiated apoptosis (45Kuwana T. Smith J.J. Muzio M. Dixit V. Newmeyer D.D. Kornbluth S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16589-16594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In keratinocytes, death receptor to mitochondria cross-talk may not be functional, since Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL do not prevent TRAIL-induced apoptosis (46Bacon P. Panella J. Denning M. Nickoloff B.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 114: 763Google Scholar) and our caspase-9 dominant negative did not block anti-Fas apoptosis (Fig. 8). By integrating the available data, we propose the UV apoptotic signaling pathway outlined in Fig. 9. UV radiation activates primarily the mitochondrial or intrinsic apoptotic pathway, resulting in activation of procaspase-9, whereas activation of procaspase-8 via death receptors is a relatively minor pathway. The procaspase-9 activation may be mediated by apoptosome complex formation, since cytochrome c release is an early, caspase-independent event in UV apoptotic signaling (47Du C. Fang M., Li, Y., Li, L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar). Once activated, the initiator caspases cleave and activate effector caspases, such as procaspase-3, which cleave a large number of death substrates, including PKCδ. As shown in Fig. 7, active caspase-3 may also be able to directly or indirectly activate caspase-8. The proteolytic activation of PKCδ is involved in triggering loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis in keratinocytes (8Denning M.F. Wang Y. Alkan S. Nickoloff B.J. Qin J.Z. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 40-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar,26Denning M.F. Wang Y. Nickoloff B.J. Wrone-Smith T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29995-30002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and the data in Fig. 6B indicate that PKCδ cleavage also requires caspase-9 activation. In summary, these studies establish that procaspase-9 activation is required for the activation of other caspases by UV radiation and thus has a role in triggering caspase-dependent apoptotic events, such as loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and DNA fragmentation in human keratinocytes. Furthermore, caspase-9 is a major determinant of UV-induced apoptosis in keratinocytes with mutant p53 and thus may have potential as a therapeutic target for triggering apoptosis in premalignant actinic keratosis that harbor mutant p53.

Macromolecules on host cell surfaces such as laminin, thrombospondin, heparan sulfate, and fibronectin are believed to be important in mediating parasite-host cell adhesions and in the invasion process of the host cell by the parasite. The SELEX technique (systematic evolution of ligands byexponential enrichment) was used to evolve nuclease-resistant RNA ligands (aptamer = to fit) that bind with affinities of 40–400 nm to parasite receptors for the host cell matrix molecules laminin, fibronectin, thrombospondin, and heparan sulfate. After eight consecutive rounds of in vitro selection four classes of RNA aptamers based on structural similarities were isolated and sequenced. All members of each class shared a common sequence motif and competed with the respective host cell matrix molecule that was used for displacement during the selection procedure. RNA pools following seven and eight selection rounds as well as individual aptamers sharing consensus motifs were active in inhibiting invasion of LLC-MK2 monkey kidney cells by T. cruzi in vitro.

Trypanosoma cruzi, the protozoan causing Chagas' disease, must invade host cells to complete its biological cycle. The parasite exists in three developmental forms. Epimastigotes extracellularly multiply in the gut of insect vectors. The mammalian stage of the parasite life cycle includes amastigotes, an intracellular form that replicates, an epimastigote-like form and trypomastigotes, released to the extracellular milieu to invade new cells or biting insects, thus propagating the infection (1Brener Z.

Ref. 23Kusser W. J. Biotechnol. 2000; 74: 27-38PubMed Google Scholar).Nuclease-resistant RNA and DNA aptamers selected to block cell adhesion events involved in disease have gained importance in the last years. The biological activity of such aptamers have been shown in in vitro assays where RNA antagonists inhibited selectin-dependent adhesion (17Jenison R.D. Jennings S.D. Walker D.W. Bargatze R.F.

Furthermore, combinatorially synthesized nuclease-resistant RNA and DNA ligands are promising candidates for use in pharmaceutical and therapeutic applications (cf. Refs. 26Jayasena S.M. Clin. Chem. 1999; 45: 1628-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar and 27Brody E.N. Gold L. J. Biotechnol. 2000; 74: 5-13PubMed Google Scholar).The SELEX technique was used to evolve nuclease-resistant RNA aptamers that block in vitro receptor-ligand interactions between T. cruzi trypomastigotes and epithelial monkey kidney LLC-MK2 host cells and partially inhibit cell invasion by these parasites.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials[32P]ATP was purchased from Pharmacia Biosciences. Two′-fluoro-pyrimidines (2′F-dCTP and 2′F-dUTP) were from TriLink BioTechnologies (San Diego, CA). Heparan sulfate was purified from bovine mucosa and kindly provided by Professor Helena B. Nader (Universidade Federal de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil).Culture of Trypomastigotes and Epimastigotes of T. cruzi (Strain Y)Trypomastigotes from T. cruzi were obtained by infection of confluent monkey kidney epithelial cells (LLC-MK2) as described previously (28Andrews N.W. Colli W. J. Protozool. 1982; 29: 264-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). LLC-MK2 cells infected with trypanosomes were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% of fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The trypomastigotes released from the infected cells after 5–6 days are washed three times in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, purified by differential centrifugation through lymphoprep (Nycomed, Oslo, Norway) and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 20 mm glucose at a density of 5 × 106parasites per microliter.SELEX for Isolation of Aptamers That Displace Matrix Molecules from Cell Surfaces of T. cruzi TrypomastigotesLaminin (human placenta) and fibronectin (human plasma) were purchased from Invitrogen and thrombospondin (human platelets) from Sigma. The following oligonucleotide, consisting of 108 nucleotides with a 40-nucleotide randomized region flanked on both sides by constant sequences, was synthesized at a 200 nm scale by Biomol, Berlin, Germany: 5′-ACCGAGTCCAGAAGCTTGTAGTACT(N40)GCCTAGATGGAGTTGAATTCTCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAC-3′ (19Ulrich H. Ippolito J.E. Pagan O.R. Eterovic V.E. Hann R.M. Shi H. Lis J.T. Eldefrawi M.E. Hess G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14051-14056Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The product of the oligonucleotide synthesis was purified on a denaturing PAGE. To create the initial DNA pool for transcription of partial randomized RNA molecules, 10.8 nmol of purified DNA were amplified in a total volume of 12 ml using 11 rounds of error-prone PCR in the presence of 0.5 mm MnCl2 and 7 mm MgCl2. The primers used for amplification were 5′-GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAATTCAACTGCCATCTA-3′ and 5′-ACCGAGTCCAGAAGCTTGTAGT-3′. The PCR product was gel-purified and ethanol-precipitated. For in vitro selection, 20 μg of the synthetic DNA pool were transcribed using 1,000 units of T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of 50 μCi of [α-32P]ATP and 1 mm 2′-OH-(ATP and GTP) and 3 mm2′-F-(dCTP and dUTP), the latter to provide stability of the transcript against RNase activity (29Ito Y. Teramoto N. Kawazoe N. Inada K. Imanishi Y. J. Bioact. Compat. Polymers. 1998; 13: 114-123Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The RNA pool was diluted to a final concentration of 50 μm in the reaction mixture containing 20 mm glucose and heat denatured and renatured to allow for proper secondary structure formation. T. cruzi trypomastigotes, purified by differential centrifugation, were resuspended in 200 μl at an approximate concentration of 500 nm possible binding sites for host cell matrix molecules and incubated for 60 min with 100 μl of the RNA pool. T. cruzi trypomastigotes and RNA molecules bound to their surfaces were pelleted by centrifugation for 45 s at 13,000 ×g, washed once with 500 μl of binding buffer, and incubated for 20 min in 50 μl of a solution containing 1 μm each laminin and fibronectin and 5 μmheparan sulfate and 100 nm thrombospondin. The trypomastigotes were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant containing displaced RNA molecules was collected. The collected eluate was phenol-chloroform- and chloroform-extracted using 1:1 supernatant:solvent volume ratios and ethanol-precipitated (80%) in the presence of 10 μg of yeast tRNA.In round seven of SELEX a preselection procedure was employed to remove RNA molecules from the SELEX pool that also bind to non-infective epimastigote surfaces. The RNA pool (3 nmol) that had been obtained by collection and amplification from SELEX round seven was incubated for 60 min with 3 × 108 epimastigotes in a total reaction volume of 300 μl. The supernatant containing 1.95 nmol of unbound RNA was collected after centrifugation, phenol-chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and used for selection of cell matrix molecule-displaceable RNA molecules bound to trypomastigotes as described.Following each round of selection, the ethanol-precipitated RNA was reverse-transcribed using avian myeloblastoma reverse transcriptase and amplified. The obtained DNA pools were transcribed for the next round of selection using an input of 10 μg of DNA, 1 mm of 2-OH′ purines and 3 mm of 2-F′ pyrimidines, and 500 units of T7 RNA polymerase (Invitrogen). Following transcription, the RNA was phenol-chloroform- and chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in diethylpyrocarbonate water.Individual Aptamer CharacterizationAfter SELEX cycle 8, the cDNAs of the pools of aptamers that were eluted using laminin, fibronectin, heparan sulfate, or thrombospondin as a displacement agent were cut with EcoRI and HindIII at the constant regions and ligated into pGEM-3Z plasmids (Promega) (19Ulrich H. Ippolito J.E. Pagan O.R. Eterovic V.E. Hann R.M. Shi H. Lis J.T. Eldefrawi M.E. Hess G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14051-14056Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The recombinant vectors were transformed into Escherichia coli strains JM109 or DH5α and plated on selective medium. Colonies were picked, and inserts were determined by automatic sequencing using the ABI PRISM big dye terminator kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The sequences of the previously random inserts were aligned and searched for sequence similarities. RNA structures were predicted by using the MFOLD program (30Zuker M. Mathews D.H. Turner D.H.

Academic Publishers, 1999: 11-43Google Scholar) at bioinfo.math.rpi.edu/∼mfold/RNA/form1.cgi.Binding AnalysisIC50 DeterminationsThe IC50 value is the concentration at which a competitor displaces 50% of a radioactive ligand from its receptor. One microgram of DNA template of SELEX RNA pool-5, -7, or -8 or individual aptamers containing consensus motifs in 20 μl of transcription buffer was transcribed in the presence of 0.5 mm GTP, 1.5 mm 2-F′ pyrimidines, and 50 μCi of [α-32P]ATP and purified on a Spin Column 30 (Sigma). 32P-Labeled RNA (2 × 105 cpm) diluted with unlabeled RNA to a final concentration of 20 nm was incubated for 60 min at room temperature with 5 × 107 trypomastigotes (130 μg of protein) or with 1 × 107 epimastigotes (92 μg of protein) in the presence of 0.1 μg/μl t-RNA and increasing concentrations of fibronectin from 0 to 10 μm in 45 μl of selection buffer. The reaction mixtures were separated by centrifugation (45 s, 12,000 × g). The pellets containing parasites and RNA bound to their surfaces were washed once with 1 ml of selection buffer and scintillation counted.Saturation AnalysesFor saturation binding analysis, constant amounts (2 × 107 or 5 × 107 trypomastigotes) were incubated with increasing concentrations of 32P-labeled SELEX pool-7 or individual cloned RNAs falling into structural classes in the presence of 0.1 μg/μl yeast t-RNA in 60 μl of selection buffer for 60 min at room temperature. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 8 μm unlabeled RNA. The Kd was estimated by fitting the data to the equation y = (x +Bmax)/(x ×Kd), where Bmax is the concentration of binding sites for the RNA molecules.Inhibition of Cell InvasionPrior to infection, T. cruzi trypomastigotes were preincubated for 15 min with the aptamer solution containing SELEX RNA pool-0, -7, or -8 or individual pooled RNAs based on their consensus sequences in PBS, 20 mm glucose. LLC-MK2 cells attached to eight-well dishes were infected in a 100:1 parasites/cell ratio with trypomastigotes in the absence or presence of SELEX RNA pools for 2 h at 37 °C. The incubation was terminated by removing the medium containing free trypomastigotes and washing twice with PBS. The non-adherent parasites were removed by 5-min incubation with lymphoprep (Nycomed), followed by two washes with PBS. The cells were incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum for 48 h at 37 °C, fixed with 100% methanol, and stained with chromomycin A (Molecular Probes), as described previously (4Magdesian M.H.

All experiments were done in duplicates, and 12 photos of each replicate were made, enabling the counting of infected and non-infected cells in samples containing 100 cells each. The data were compared for statistical significance by the unpaired Student's t test. The viability of cells and trypomastigotes in the presence of aptamer solution was confirmed by staining with trypan blue and microscopic analysis.DISCUSSIONThe present work demonstrates the importance of the interaction between host cell matrix molecules such as fibronectin, laminin, thrombospondin, and heparan sulfate with their respective host cell receptors on infective trypomastigote forms of T. cruzi. Thrombospondin is a family of secreted proteins widely distributed in the extracellular matrices of several tissues. Whereas fibronectin (5Ouaissi M.A. Cornette J. Afchain D. Capron A. Gras-Masse H.

Invasion of Plasmodia is mediated by a thrombospondin-related adhesive protein (TRAP) (31Sultan A.A. Int. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 155-160PubMed Google Scholar), and thrombospondin is involved somehow with tumor progression (32Sargiannidou I. Zhou J. Tuszynski G.P. Exp. Biol. Med. 2000; 226: 726-733Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 33Rodriguez-Manzaneque J.C. Lane T.F. Ortega M.A. Hynes R.O. Lawler J. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12485-12490Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Notwithstanding, present evidence favors fibronectin, laminin, and heparan sulfate as more important molecules in host cell invasion by T. cruzi than thrombospondin.It is known that trypomastigotes shed molecules bound to their cell surface (34Gonçalves M.F. Umezawa E.S. Katzin A.M. de Souza W. Alves M.J.M. Zingales B. Colli W. Exp. Parasitol. 1991; 72: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), which may explain quantitative differences between binding affinity and biological effect in vitro. The failure of the selected RNA aptamers, even in higher concentrations, to inhibit completely the invasion of the host cell by the parasite suggests that T. cruzi may use several different mechanisms to invade host cells. This is expected due to the large repertoire of molecules described in the literature as involved in host cell invasion by the parasite (3Pereira M.E.A.

As T. cruzi invades nearly every cell type except erythrocytes, it may express a variety of receptors and ligands to ensure its interaction with different pattern of molecules expressed on the surface of the respective cell type.Thus, the SELEX method opens new avenues to block pathogen-host cell interactions. Considering that the 2′-hydroxyl group of the ribose is substituted by fluorine, the RNA aptamers are less amenable to RNase attack and, therefore, are ideal for in vivo experiments. Thus, stable oligonucleotides that may inhibit parasite-host cell interaction could be used to develop administrable drugs that would hopefully halt the progress of disease.Combinatorial library approaches have been successfully employed to block ligand-receptor interactions that are necessary for completion of the life cycle of other parasites such as Plasmodium. Selection in vitro of peptide ligands from a combinatorial phage display library that block adhesion and invasion of insect midgut cells by Plasmodium was described previously (39Ghosh A.K. Ribolla P.E.M. Jacobs-Lorena M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13278-13281Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Combinatorial libraries may be advantageous for drug development when compared with the rational drug design approach, as the selection of aptamers, for instance, do not require a full understanding of infection by pathogens.The development of agents that block adhesion events between parasites and host cells have not only become important regarding protection of cells against invasion by pathogens but also to prevent metastatic cancer cells from adhering to endothelial cells of blood vessels and invading the respective tissues. Interestingly the same host cell matrix molecules involved in cell invasion by T. cruzi as shown in this study are used as adhesion ligands by tumor cells (40Armstrong P.B. Armstrong M.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1470: 9-20Google Scholar,41Gianelli G. Antonaci S. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2000; 18: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).Recently, the in vivo use of aptamers is providing more consistent results by improving aptamer pharmacokinetics. Keeping intact aptamers in the blood from hours to days has been accomplished by conjugation with high molecular weight carriers, such as polyethyleneglycol, or by embedding into liposomes (42Willis M.C. Collins B.D. Zhang T. Green L.S. Sebesta D.P. Bell C. Kellogg E. Gill S.C. Magallanez A. Knauer S. Bendele R.A. Gill P.S. Janjic N. Collins B. Bioconjug. Chem. 1998; 9: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). As an example, one aptamer to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), patented as NX 1838 is currently been used in clinical trials as a potential therapeutic agent for age-related macular degeneration (27Brody E.N. Gold L. J. Biotechnol. 2000; 74: 5-13PubMed Google Scholar). Several aptamers that inhibit adhesion events have been shown to be effective in animal models such as those directed against VEGF (43Ostendorf T. Kunter U. Eitner F. Loos A. Regele H. Kerjaschki D.

Thus, it should be feasible to find active aptamers against in vivo infection by T. cruzi that may open new perspectives to future approaches in the treatment of Chagas' disease. Trypanosoma cruzi, the protozoan causing Chagas' disease, must invade host cells to complete its biological cycle. The parasite exists in three developmental forms.

Three of the family members are defective in heritable diseases characterized by abnormal growth, premature aging, and predisposition to malignancies. These include the WRN and BLMgene products that are defective in Werner and Bloom syndromes, disorders which share many phenotypic and cellular characteristics including spontaneous genomic instability. Here, we report a physical and functional interaction between BLM and WRN. These proteins were coimmunoprecipitated from a nuclear matrix-solubilized fraction, and the purified recombinant proteins were shown to interact directly. Moreover, BLM and WRN colocalized to nuclear foci in three human cell lines. Two regions of WRN that mediate interaction with BLM were identified, and one of these was localized to the exonuclease domain of WRN. Functionally, BLM inhibited the exonuclease activity of WRN.

Schellenberg G.D. Harris C.C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1355-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Some of these interactions are not only physical but are also functional. Each of these binding proteins is involved in some form of DNA metabolism, such as DNA recombination, replication, and repair, and in the resolution of alternative DNA structures (1Oshima J. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 894-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 2Bohr V.A. Cooper M. Orren D. Machwe A. Piotrowski J. Sommers J. Karmakar P. Brosh R. Exp. Gerontol. 2000; 35: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This suggests that WRN plays a role in a number of key DNA metabolic pathways. Bloom syndrome (BS) is a highly cancer-prone disease associated with increased genomic instability and elevated sister chromatid exchanges. The protein defective in this disorder, Bloom syndrome protein (BLM), is a 3′-5′-helicase (9Karow J.K. Chakraverty R.K. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30611-30614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). BLM binds to RPA, p53, topoisomerase IIIα, and RAD51 and is a component of the BRCA1-associated genome surveillance complex (10Mohaghegh P. Hickson I.D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). This links BLM with proteins implicated in several aspects of DNA metabolism (DNA recombination, replication, and repair). BLM and WRN both belong to the RecQ family of helicases, which are conserved from Escherichia coli to human (11Karow J.K., Wu, L. Hickson I.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). WRN is unique among the human RecQ helicases in having an exonuclease domain in the N-terminal region of the protein. A number of the RecQ helicases have been purified, and their biochemical properties have been characterized (11Karow J.K., Wu, L. Hickson I.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). There is considerable interest in the substrate specificities of each of these enzymes and in possible differences between them. However, so far there has been no indication of any interaction between different RecQ helicases and no focus on the potential modulation of their catalytic activities when present together in a complex. Based on their shared helicase sequences, WRN and BLM are expected to exhibit similar biochemical properties (12Brosh R.M., Jr. Karow J.K. White E.J. Shaw N.D. Hickson I.D. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2420-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Our recent studies demonstrate that BLM and WRN are structure-specific helicases that demonstrate a marked similarity in DNA substrate preference (13Mohaghegh P. Karow J.K. Brosh R.M., Jr. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2843-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Also, WS and BS patients share a number of phenotypic characteristics (14Lindor N.M. Furuichi Y. Kitao S. Shimamoto A. Arndt C. Jalal S. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2000; 90: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), indicating a possible “cross-talk” in the intracellular pathways in which BLM and WRN function. In this context, as mentioned above, both helicases have common interacting partners (p53, RPA). In the present work, we demonstrate that BLM and WRN colocalize in three different human cell lines and interact physically and functionally. These results suggest that these and possibly other RecQ helicases exist in complexes and that their functions should be considered in this context. Recombinant, hexahistidine-tagged BLM and WRN proteins were purified as described previously (9Karow J.K. Chakraverty R.K. Hickson I.D. J. Biol.

The insoluble pellet (containing chromatin, nuclear envelope, and nuclear matrix proteins) resulting from the second sucrose cushion extraction was resuspended in 4 ml (1 volume) of Tween 20 buffer (1% Tween 20, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 15 mm MgCl2, 60 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 100 μmNa3VO3, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 450 mm NaCl, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The suspension was sonicated twice (5 s each), dounced four times in a glass Dounce homogenizer (tight pestle, B type), and incubated on ice for 20 min. The suspension was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g(Ti-60 rotor, Beckman) for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted with 8 ml (2 volumes) of Tween 20 buffer without NaCl (150 mm NaCl final concentration). Prior to binding assays, the supernatant was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was defined as the nuclear matrix (NM) solubilized fraction. Twelve μg of HeLa S3 nuclear extracts, nuclear matrix-solubilized fraction, and cytoplasmic extracts (S100) were loaded onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) at 250 mA for 2 h at room temperature. Before blocking, the membranes were stained with Amido Black to verify the amount of proteins loaded into each well. Before incubation with the primary antibodies, the membranes were incubated in blocking buffer (5% non-fat milk, 0.5% Tween 20 in 1× PBS) for 1.5 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated with rabbit anti-BLM (1:1000, Novus), rabbit anti-WRN (1:1000, Novus), anti-β-Tubulin (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, S100 marker), or goat anti-lamin B (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, NM marker) polyclonal antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. After washing two times (10 min each) with blocking buffer, the membranes were incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies horseradish peroxidase-labeled (1:10,000, Vector Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes (15 min each), the horseradish peroxidase signal was detected using ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. The nuclear matrix-solubilized fraction (500 μl) was precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads (30 μl) (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C and then incubated with either rabbit anti-BLM antibodies (19Brosh R.M., Jr., Li, J.L. Kenny M.K. Karow J.K. Cooper M.P. Kureekattil R.P. Hickson I.D. Bohr V.A. J. Biol.

After the incubation, 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose were added to each sample, and the sample was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Then the beads were pelleted (2000 × g, 2 min at 4 °C) and washed four times with 500 μl of Tween 20 buffer (see above). Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in protein sample buffer and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot as described above. In this experiment, we used as primary antibodies either mouse anti-WRN (1:250, Becton Dickinson) or mouse anti-BLM (1:50 (20Wu L. Davies S.L. North P.S. Goulaouic H. Riou J.F. Turley H. Gatter K.C.

HeLa, U-2 OS, and SV40-transformed WS (AG11395) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal bovine serum. For expression as GFP fusion protein in mammalian cells, the PCR fragment containing the full-length sequence of WRN (aa 1–1432) was subcloned into the XhoI-XmaI sites of vector pEGFPC3 (CLONTECH). Cells growing on coverslips were transfected with a pEGFPC3-WRN (1–1432) expression vector using the Calphos mammalian transfection kit (CLONTECH). After 15 h, the cells were fixed and permeabilized with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma), 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in 1× PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Then the coverslips were washed three times with PBS followed by incubation with blocking buffer (0.1% Tween 20, 2% BSA in 1× PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the coverslips were incubated with rabbit anti-BLM antibodies (1:200 dilution in blocking buffer) for 4 h at room temperature. After washing two times (10 min each, constant shaking) with blocking buffer, the coverslips were incubated with donkey anti-rabbit Texas Red (The Jackson Laboratory) (1:200 in blocking buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times (15 min each, constant shaking), the coverslips were mounted on Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and viewed under a laser scan confocal microscope (Zeiss 410) in separate channels (green, 488 nm; red, 568 nm). The images were then overlaid and analyzed with Metamorph imaging system 4.1 (Universal Imaging Corp.). Representative photographs from three independent experiments are shown in the figures. ELISA was done as described previously (19Brosh R.M., Jr., Li, J.L. Kenny M.K. Karow J.K. Cooper M.P. Kureekattil R.P. Hickson I.D. Bohr V.A. J. Biol.

The blocking and binding steps were performed with the same buffer: 3% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS. In the coating step, WRN was diluted in carbonate buffer at 2 ng/ml. Then BLM was added at 1 ng/ml in the binding step. DNase I (Calbiochem) was included (5 μg/ml) in the incubation time in the corresponding wells. The absorbance (490 nm) values were corrected for background signal (absorbance signal of anti-BLM antibodies with WRN-coated wells, optical density, 0.1). For heat-denatured BLM, the diluted protein was incubated at 100 °C for 5 min prior to adding to the corresponding wells. The WRN fragments were generated by PCR using the gene encoding human WRN protein kindly provided by Dr. Junko Oshima (University of Washington Medical School, Seattle, WA) as template. The PCR products were subcloned into the NcoI-BamHI and NcoI-XmaI (for fragments encoding aa 1–51 and aa 1–120) sites of vector pGEXCS. The WRN expression plasmids were sequenced to verify their integrity. The expression of GST-WRN recombinant fragments was as described previously (21Schmitt C. von Kobbe C. Bachi A. Pante N.

For the pull-down experiment using HeLa nuclear extract, 40 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads were saturated with the different GST-WRN fragments. The recombinant fragments were then incubated with 500 μg of HeLa nuclear extract for 2 h at 4 °C. After extensive washes, the bound proteins were analyzed by Western blot with anti-BLM antibodies. Human BLM cDNA was obtained by PCR using a cDNA library as the template and using Expand high fidelity enzyme (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The PCR fragments were cloned into the XhoI-KpnI sites of vector pRSETA (Invitrogen) to generate the plasmid pRSETA-BLM for expression as radiolabeled, in vitro translated BLM ([35S]BLM). The 100-bp M13mp18 partial duplex DNA substrate was constructed with a 100-mer oligonucleotide (Loftsrand Laboratories Ltd.) complementary to positions 6038–6137 of M13mp18 (New England Biolabs). The 100-mer was 32P-labeled at its 5′ end and annealed to the M13mp18 single-stranded DNA circle and subsequently purified as described previously (4Brosh R.M., Jr. Orren D.K. Nehlin J.O. Ravn P.H.

WRN and BLM were preincubated at 24 °C for 4 min. The reactions were initiated by the addition of the DNA substrate and incubated for 30 min at 24 °C. Helicase reactions with the M13mp18 partial duplex substrates were terminated as described previously (4Brosh R.M., Jr. Orren D.K. Nehlin J.O. Ravn P.H. Kenny M.K. Machwe A. Bohr V.A. J. Biol.

The 53-mer (7 pmol) was 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (60 μCi, 3000 Ci/mmol) and polynucleotide kinase (10 units) using standard conditions. Construction and purification of double-stranded DNA substrates containing a 5′ overhang and the conditions for the exonuclease reactions were as described previously (5Cooper M.P. Machwe A. Orren D.K. Brosh R.M. Ramsden D. Bohr V.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 907-912PubMed Google Scholar). Colocalization of WRN and BLM has been reported in human primary fibroblasts (24Yankiwski V. Marciniak R.A. Guarente L. Neff N.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5214-5219Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), but no data have appeared using other human cell lines. We used an N-terminal GFP-tagged WRN construct to specifically label the WRN protein. After transfection with the GFP-WRN expression vector, HeLa cells were fixed, permeabilized, and probed with specific anti-BLM antibodies. As shown in Fig.1A, GFP-WRN and endogenous BLM colocalized in nuclear foci. In the transfected cells that show GFP-WRN nuclear foci staining (∼20%), we found almost 100% colocalization with BLM. A low percentage of transfected cells showed no colocalization (Fig. 1A, panel c, white arrows) of WRN and BLM proteins.FIG. 1Colocalization of GFP-WRN and BLM in human cell lines. Exponentially growing HeLa cells (A), SV40-transformed WS cells (AG11395 cell line)(B), and U-2 OS cells (C) were transfected with the pEGFPC3-WRN (aa 1–1432) vector and processed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Panels d, h, and l in A and panels dand h in B and C represent the transmitted image. These pictures correspond to two representative GFP-WRN transfected cells from each cell line. As shown inA–C, the calibration bar (right, bottom panel) corresponds to 10 μm. White triangles represent examples of BLM/GFP-WRN foci that are not colocalizing.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We also examined two additional human cell lines (U-2 OS and AG11395) for colocalization of WRN and BLM. As seen in Fig. 1, B and C, both cell lines showed strong colocalization of GFP-WRN and endogenous BLM in nuclear foci. However, some BLM nuclear foci and GFP-WRN nuclear foci did not colocalize (Fig. 1, panels cand g, white arrows), suggesting that the WRN-BLM association is dynamic. In the course of these experiments, we detected both a strong nuclear punctuate staining and either weaker or no nucleolar staining of GFP-WRN and BLM in U-2 OS and AG11395 cells (compare the number of nuclear foci corresponding to both GFP-WRN and the red BLM staining in Fig. 1A with Fig. 1, Band C). These cell lines are telomerase-negative cells (ALT cells), whereas HeLa cells are telomerase-positive (25Johnson F.B. Marciniak R.A. McVey M. Stewart S.A. Hahn W.C. Guarente L. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 905-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 26Yeager T.R. Neumann A.A. Englezou A. Huschtscha L.I. Noble J.R. Reddel R.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4175-4179PubMed Google Scholar). The colocalization of GFP-WRN and BLM in the ALT cell lines was not affected by whether endogenous WRN was present (U-2 OS cells) or absent (AG11395, SV40-transformed WS cells). Thus, these results indicated that GFP-WRN and BLM colocalized in nuclear foci. Furthermore, this colocalization was almost 100% when both proteins were in these foci. The colocalization between GFP-WRN and BLM was more evident in ALT cells where the two proteins particularly localized to the nuclear foci. To explore whether a physical (direct) interaction exists between WRN and BLM, we performed ELISA with purified recombinant proteins. The results demonstrated that BLM specifically binds with WRN (Fig. 2). This interaction was not mediated by DNA since the binding was largely unaffected by the presence of DNase I (Fig. 2, bar 3). The WRN-BLM binding was highly dependent on the BLM conformation because when BLM was heat-denatured, the interaction was greatly reduced (bar 4). This reduced absorbance signal was not due to the lack of the recognition of heat-inactivated BLM by anti-BLM antibodies (data not shown). These experiments clearly demonstrated that WRN and BLM interact directly. Since WRN and BLM helicases colocalized to the same subcellular fraction in vivo, we next sought to verify this colocalization biochemically. Solubilized cellular fractions representing nuclear, cytoplasmic (S100), and NM extracts from exponentially growing HeLa cells were analyzed by Western blot for the presence of WRN and BLM. The localization patterns of WRN and BLM were very similar with both proteins primarily found in the nuclear matrix-solubilized fraction (Fig.3A, lane 2). A small amount of each protein was found in the nucleoplasm (Fig.3A, lane 1), whereas there was little (WRN) or no (BLM) signal in the cytoplasm (S100) (Fig. 3A, lane 3). The subcellular localization pattern of BLM agrees with previous studies (27Bischof O. Kim S.H. Irving J. Beresten S. Ellis N.A. Campisi J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 367-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 28Gharibyan V. Youssoufian H. Mol. Carcinog. 1999; 26: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The next step was to perform coimmunoprecipitation experiments using the nuclear matrix-solubilized fraction. Previous studies have failed to detect a possible WRN-BLM interaction (28Gharibyan V. Youssoufian H. Mol. Carcinog. 1999; 26: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), maybe because the nuclear matrix solubilization method used involved SDS, urea, and/or ammonium sulfate, which can destabilize protein-protein interactions. Here, we solubilized the nuclear matrix components in a buffer suitable for immunoprecipitation analysis (see “Materials and Methods”). Under these conditions, WRN coimmunoprecipitated with anti-BLM antibodies and not with control antibodies (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 3). The fraction of WRN molecules that immunoprecipitated with anti-BLM antibodies was only about 5%. This may be due to differences in WRN and BLM expression patterns during the cell cycle. WRN is expressed constitutively, whereas BLM is expressed during the S/G2 phase (29Dutertre S. Ababou M. Onclercq R. Delic J. Chatton B. Jaulin C. Amor-Gueret M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2731-2738Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the lack of binding by the antibody could be due to blocking of the binding site by WRN. We were not able to detect the reverse immunoprecipitation (anti-WRN, blot anti-BLM), possibly for similar reasons. The complex containing WRN and BLM proteins may only contain a limited fraction of the cellular amounts of these proteins, but it is also possible that the WRN-BLM association is destabilized during the cellular fractionation steps (see “Materials and Methods”). However, as will be described later (see Fig. 4D), we were able to pull down BLM from HeLa nuclear extract using a GST-tagged C-terminal fragment of WRN. In conclusion, WRN and BLM localized to the same subcellular compartment, and fractions of the two proteins are associated with each other. To map the BLM binding domain(s) of WRN, we cloned and expressed a battery of WRN fragments as GST fusion proteins (Fig. 4, A and B). Some of the bands in the gel (Fig. 4A, lanes 5 and 6) are of smaller molecular weight than the full-length GST-WRN domains (helicase and C-terminal domains, respectively). They were identified by anti-GST Western blot to be degradation products (data not shown). The recombinant proteins were used in a series of binding assays with radiolabeled, in vitro translated BLM ([35S]BLM). As shown in Fig.4C, [35S]BLM bound to three different domains of WRN. Although the first 51 aa of WRN failed to bind [35S]BLM (lane 2), a domain that overlaps with the exonuclease domain (first 120 aa) clearly showed binding to [35S]BLM (Fig. 4C, lane 3). The [35S]BLM binding efficiency of this N-terminal fragment was about 15% of the input. The acidic region of WRN was unable to bind [35S]BLM (Fig. 4C, lane 4). All the proteins containing a portion of the conserved RQC terminal motif (Fig. 4, B and E, red box) bound to [35S]BLM (Fig. 4C, lanes 5–8). The [35S]BLM binding efficiency of the RQC-containing C-terminal fragment of WRN (lane 6) was about 30% of the input. In contrast, a C-terminal region of WRN, lacking the RQC motif, failed to bind [35S]BLM (lane 9). Importantly, a small WRN region of 144 aa (aa 949–1092, lane 8) was able to bind [35S]BLM, although less efficiently (about 8% of input) than the full-length C-terminal fragment (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 6 and 8). Confirming this physical interaction, the small fragment of WRN (aa 949–1092) was able to pull down BLM from HeLa cell nuclear extract (Fig. 4D). This also ruled out the possibility that the binding of this fragment to [35S]BLM was restricted to recombinant proteins. We have recently demonstrated (30Brosh R.M., Jr. von Kobbe C. Sommers J.A. Karmakar P. Opresko P.L. Piotrowski J. Dianova I. Dianov G.L. Bohr V.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5791-5801Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) that this same WRN region (aa 949–1042) functionally interacts with flap endonuclease 1 (FEN-1). This result, together with the binding to BLM described here, indicates that this domain plays a central role in the regulation of WRN-interacting proteins. Based on the above results, we conclude that [35S]BLM binds to the N-terminal domain (aa 51–120) and to all fragments containing the RQC domain sequences of WRN. We cannot rule out that there may be additional binding sites in the WRN helicase domain (Fig. 4E). These results were confirmed with ELISA analysis, which showed a direct binding of recombinant BLM to both the exonuclease and the RQC-containing regions of WRN (data not shown). The WRN binding domain(s) of BLM may reside in the central region of the BLM protein. A 35S-labeled C-terminal truncated BLM mutant (aa 1–435) failed to bind to any of the WRN fragments, whereas the first 901 aa of BLM (aa 1–901) were able to bind both the WRN N-terminal and the RQC-containing domains (data not shown). To investigate a functional interaction between BLM and WRN, we tested for a potential cooperation/synergism of the two helicases using several double-stranded DNA substrates. We have shown previously that WRN and BLM helicases unwind short (28-bp) M13 partial duplex substrates (4Brosh R.M., Jr. Orren D.K. Nehlin J.O. Ravn P.H. Kenny M.K. Machwe A. Bohr V.A. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2135931990,"A role for choline during early stages of mammalian embryogenesis has not been established, although recent studies show that inhibitors of choline uptake and metabolism, 2-dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE), and 1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine (ET-18-OCH3), produce neural tube defects in mouse embryos grown in vitro. To determine potential mechanisms responsible for these abnormalities, choline metabolism in the presence or absence of these inhibitors was evaluated in cultured, neurulating mouse embryos by using chromatographic techniques. Results showed that 90%-95% of 14C-choline was incorporated into phosphocholine and phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), which was metabolized to sphingomyelin. Choline was oxidized to betaine, and betaine homocysteine methyltransferase was expressed. Acetylcholine was synthesized in yolk sacs, but 70 kDa choline acetyltransferase was undetectable by immunoblot. DMAE reduced embryonic choline uptake and inhibited phosphocholine, PtdCho, phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn), and sphingomyelin synthesis. ET-18-OCH3 also inhibited PtdCho synthesis. In embryos and yolk sacs incubated with 3H-ethanolamine, 95% of recovered label was PtdEtn, but PtdEtn was not converted to PtdCho, which suggested that phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase (PeMT) activity was absent. In ET-18-OCH3 treated yolk sacs, PtdEtn was increased, but PtdCho was still not generated through PeMT. Results suggest that endogenous PtdCho synthesis is important during neurulation and that perturbed choline metabolism contributes to neural tube defects produced by DMAE and ET-18-OCH3."

Ets factors regulate matrix turnover by activating transcription of several metalloproteinases (MMPs) and are frequently overexpressed in aggressive tumors and arthritis. Because of the prominent role of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) in ECM synthesis, this study was undertaken to determine the possible interactions between Ets1 and the TGF-β pathway. Experiments using adenoviral delivery of Ets1 in human fibroblasts have established that Ets1 strongly suppresses TGF-β induction of collagen type I and other matrix-related genes and reverses TGF-β-dependent inhibition of MMP-1. Subsequent experiments utilizing COL1A2 promoter demonstrated that Ets1 in the presence of TGF-β signaling interferes with the stimulatory role of p300. To gain further insight into the mechanism of Ets1 inhibition of the TGF-β signaling, the protein levels and post-translational modifications of Ets1 after TGF-β treatment were analyzed. The level of total Ets1 protein was not affected after 24 h of TGF-β stimulation. Moreover, TGF-β did not affect either serine or threonine phosphorylation levels of Ets1. However, TGF-β induced rapid and prolonged lysine acetylation of Ets1. In addition, analyses of endogenous p300·Ets1 complexes revealed that acetylated Ets1 is preferentially associated with the p300/CBP complexes. TGF-β treatment leads to dissociation of Ets1 from the CBP/p300 complexes.

Controlled ECM synthesis, deposition, and degradation occur during embryogenesis, the female reproductive cycle, angiogenesis, and tissue repair, but in the majority of normal adult tissues, only limited turnover of the ECM takes place. In contrast, the balance between ECM synthesis and degradation is disrupted under many pathological conditions, leading to abnormal ECM remodeling. Excessive matrix synthesis and deposition is characteristic for fibrotic diseases such as systemic sclerosis, liver cirrhosis, and glomerulosclerosis. Unbalanced matrix degradation takes place in rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, as well as tumorigenesis and is associated with cartilage and bone destruction, tumor invasion, and metastasis (1Trojanowska M.

TGF-β is one of the most potent inducers of ECM proteins, and its role in the pathogenesis of fibrosis is well established (2Blobe G.C. Schiemann W.P. Lodish H.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 1350-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar). TGF-β up-regulates ECM deposition via several different mechanisms, including stimulation of collagen synthesis, induction of the profibrotic cytokine CTGF, and up-regulation of certain ECM receptors and protease inhibitors (e.g. PAI-1, TIMP-1) (3Massague J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar, 4Abraham D.J. Shiwen X. Black C.M., Sa, S., Xu, Y. Leask A. J. Biol.

Although the role of TGF-β in arthritis and cancer is less clear, it is believed that TGF-β plays a dual role in these pathological conditions. In rheumatoid arthritis, TGF-β is a major contributor to synovial fibroblast hyperplasia, and it is abundant in rheumatoid joints (5Lafyatis R. Thompson N.L. Remmers E.F. Flanders K.C. Roche N.S. Kim S.J. Case J.P. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Wilder R.L. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1142-1148PubMed Google Scholar). Locally, TGF-β may promote reparative processes and prevent cartilage destruction. However, in chronic lesions, overproduction of TGF-β contributes to ongoing damage by recruiting monocytes and promotion of angiogenesis (6Feldmann M. Brennan F.M. Maini R.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 397-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar). In early stages of tumor development, TGF-β is anti-tumorigenic, acting as a growth inhibitor to epithelial cells. In many advanced tumors, TGF-β promotes tumorigenicity by stimulating angiogenesis, inducing extracellular matrix degradation, and inhibiting anti-tumor immune responses (7Reiss M. Barcellos-Hoff M.H. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1997; 45: 81-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The positive role of TGF-β in tumor promotion is well documented in vivo in human breast cancer, where TGF-β expression positively correlates with the rate of disease progression (8Gorsch S.M. Memoli V.A. Stukel T.A. Gold L.I. Arrick B.A. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6949-6952PubMed Google Scholar, 9Dalal B.I. Keown P.A. Greenberg A.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1993; 143: 381-389PubMed Google Scholar). These apparently divergent abilities of TGF-β to promote tumor invasion and metastasis and its strong profibrotic activities are likely to be related to distinct properties of the target cells. For example, the altered or lost sensitivity to TGF-β of various neoplastic cells and stromal mesenchymal cells has been linked to loss or mutation of TGF-β receptors or dysregulation of TGF-β signal transduction pathways (10Taipale J.

A number of in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that the Ets family of transcription factors plays an important role in ECM turnover. There is increasing evidence that some Ets factors, particularly members of the Ets1 and E1AF/PEA3 subfamilies, play important roles in transcriptional activation of ECM-degrading enzymes, including serine proteases (uPA) and matrix metalloproteinases (e.g. MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9) (12Wasylyk C.

For these studies, we utilized human fibroblasts, because in vivo studies have demonstrated that Ets1 is expressed at elevated level in fibroblastic cells. We have identified a possible interaction between Ets1 and the TGF-β signaling pathway. Based on our results, we postulate that Ets1 is a potent and selective suppressor of TGF-β-induced genes, and therefore, that altered or lost sensitivity of stromal mesenchymal cells to TGF-β may be mediated at least in part by Ets1 overexpression.

Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3253) Google Scholar). Briefly, Ets1 cDNA from pGEXp51 (29Watson D.K. Seth A. Smyth F.E. Schweinfest C.W. Papas T.S. Papas T.S. Oncogenesis. Gulf Publishing Co., Houston1990: 221-232Google Scholar) was PCR-amplified with an Ets1F primer, which contains the Ets1 sequence and a BglII adapter, 5′-gagaagatctatgaaggcggccgtcg-3′, and the Ets1R primer with a NotI adapter, 5′-gaggcggccgctcactcgtcggcatctggc-3′, and subcloned into a modified pcDNA3 vector between BamHI and NotI. This vector (provided by Dr. C. Hauser, Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA) allowed incorporation of a FLAG epitope tag at the N terminus to monitor protein expression. The sequence of the PCR-generated insert was verified and recloned into the Shuttle plasmid, pAdTrackCMV, using Hin dIII-EcoRV. For homologous recombination, PmeI-digested shuttle plasmid bearing the kanamycin resistance gene was co-electroporated with the circular adenoviral genome plasmid pAdEasy-1 (E1A deleted) into competent BJ5183 bacterial cells (Stratagene) and plated on kanamycin medium. Recombinant adenoviral DNA was purified, linearized with PacI, and transfected into the 293A cells using FuGene6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Recombinant adenoviruses were plaque-purified and screened for the expression of the Ets1 construct by Western blot using M5 FLAG antibody (Sigma). Following large scale preparation, adenoviruses were purified by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation, dialyzed, and titered using the TCID50method. Analysis of proline incorporation into secreted protein was performed as described previously (30Ichiki Y. Smith E.A. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Rheumatol. 1997; 24: 90-95PubMed Google Scholar). Fibroblasts were grown to visual confluency in 12-well plates. The medium was changed to serum-free medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid for the duration of the experiment, and cells were transduced with Ets1/GFP-adenovirus or control GFP-adenovirus (multiplicity of infection = 100). This condition allowed >95% of the cells to be transduced with virus as visualized by expression of GFP. 18 h after infection, fibroblasts were stimulated with 2 ng/ml human recombinant TGF-β1 (R&D Systems), and 6 h later, 20 μCi/ml [3H]proline (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the medium for 24 h. Medium was harvested from each well, and cells were trypsinized and counted. Medium was dehydrated in a SpeedVac (Savant) and resuspended in 2× SDS/dithiothreitol sample buffer. Aliquots of conditioned media normalized for cell number were denatured and loaded on a 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis the gel was enhanced by Fluoro-Hance (Research Products International Corp.) and visualized by autoradiography. The intensity of bands of collagenous protein was quantitated using NIH Image (Densitometry Software, version 1.55). Fibroblasts were grown to confluency in 60-mm2 dishes, incubated in serum-free DMEM and transduced with control GFP- or Ets1/GFP-adenoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 100. 18 h after infection fibroblasts were stimulated with TGF-β1 for 24 and 48 h. Total RNA was extracted and analyzed by Northern blotting as previously described (31Ishikawa O. Yamakage A. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 169: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Filters were hybridized sequentially with radioactive probes for COL1A2, COL1A1, TIMP-1, CTGF, MMP-1, and 18 S rRNA. The filters were scanned with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) for mRNA quantitation. Fibroblasts were seeded on 6-well plates (105 cells/well) and transfected 24h later. Transient transfections with the indicated reporter, expression, and control constructs were performed in duplicate using FuGene 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to manufacturer's specification. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, cells were stimulated with 2 ng/ml TGF-β1 for an additional 48 h. Transfections were repeated at least four times using two different plasmid preparations. Luciferase activities in aliquots containing equal amounts of protein were determined 48 h after TGF-β1 stimulation using the Luciferase Assay System from Promega. Confluent, serum-starved dermal fibroblasts cultured on 100 mm2 dishes were treated with 2 ng/ml TGF-β1 for different time periods. To determine the levels of Ets1 and Smad3 and their post-translational modifications after TGF-β treatment, total cell lysates were used. For direct Western analyses, 100 μg of total cell lysate was used. For IP, 400 μg of total cell protein were used. Cells were lysed in buffer A containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with protease inhibitors (Mixture Set III, Calbiochem). Protein concentration was determined by BCA Protein Assay (Pierce). Complex formation was performed overnight at 4 °C using 7 μg of each antibody followed by precipitation with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h in 4 °C. For IP, the following antibodies were used: monoclonal Ets1 (E44; described previously (32Koizumi S. Fisher R.J. Fujiwara S. Jorcyk C. Bhat N.K. Seth A. Papas T.S. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 675-681PubMed Google Scholar)), polyclonal Ets1 (C-20), polyclonal Smad2/3 (N-19 and FL-425, Santa Cruz), or monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (M5, Sigma). Negative controls were performed using normal rabbit or mouse IgG. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times in buffer A, eluted by boiling for 5 min in 2× SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by Western blot. Samples were electrophoresed in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). After blocking with 3% milk or 3% bovine serum albumin, the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies (polyclonal or monoclonal anti-acetylated lysine IgG (Ac-K-103, Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-phosphoserine, rabbit anti-phosphothreonine (Zymed Laboratories), or mouse anti-phosphothreonine (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)) overnight, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and washing with Tween/Tris-buffered saline solution. Proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Total protein was detected by Western blotting on the same membranes after striping, using appropriate antibodies: monoclonal Ets1 and monoclonal Smad2/3 (Transduction Laboratories), polyclonal Ets1 (C-20), polyclonal Smad3 (FL-425), or monoclonal β-actin (clone AC-150, Sigma). Co-immunoprecipitation-recapture was performed as described elsewhere (67Bonifacino. J. S., Dasso, M., Harford, J. B., Lippincott-Schwartz, J., and Yamada, K. (eds) (2000) Current Protocols in Cell Biology, pp. 7.2.11–7.2.14, John Wiley & Sons, New YorkGoogle Scholar). Fibroblasts were lysed in nondenaturing buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with protease inhibitors for 1 h on ice. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 ×g for 10 min; 1.5 mg of total cell lysate was used for each condition. Co-IP was performed at 4 °C overnight with 20 μg of mouse anti-human p300 antibody (PharMingen). “Free” Ets1 and Smad3 were immunoprecipitated sequentially from the supernatant using 10 μg of polyclonal Ets1 antibody (C-20) and Smad3 (FL-425, Santa Cruz), respectively. p300 immunocomplexes were disrupted by denaturing in 1% SDS and boiling for 5 min to release bound Ets1 and Smad3. Supernatants were then transferred to new tubes containing 10 volumes of buffer B without SDS, and Ets1 and Smad3 were sequentially immunoprecipitated with polyclonal Ets1 (C-20) and Smad3 (FL-425) antibodies. WB was used to determine the amount and the acetylated status of Ets1, as well as the amount of Smad3 in p300 complexes and supernatant (free) fractions. The loading control for the p300 complex and free fraction was performed with p300 (N-15, Santa Cruz) and monoclonal β-actin (clone AC-150, Sigma) antibodies, respectively, in corresponding fractions. In vitro transcribed and translated human Ets1 protein using the TNT-coupled Reticulocyte lysates system (Promega) was used as the control for WB. Paired analyses were performed using the Wilcoxon test to evaluate statistical significance. Data values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was defined as a p value of 0.05 or less. In the first set of experiments, we asked whether Ets1 regulates ECM production in human dermal fibroblasts in the presence of TGF-β by utilizing an adenovirus expressing Ets1. To assess the effect of Ets1 on newly synthesized collagenous proteins, including procollagens type I and III and fibronectin, conditioned media from cells metabolically labeled with [3H]proline were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, collagenous proteins were induced by TGF-β in control fibroblasts infected with the GFP-adenovirus but not in cells infected with the Ets1-adenovirus. Ets1 expression almost completely abrogates the stimulatory effect of TGF-β on collagenous protein synthesis. Thus, these data indicate that Ets1 is a potent inhibitor of TGF-β-induced synthesis of collagenous proteins. Decreased levels of the collagenous proteins in conditioned media may result from the activation of the degradative pathways (e.g. MMPs), decreased collagen synthesis, or both. Overexpression of Ets1 in dermal fibroblasts did not affect cell viability or proliferation rate up to 48 h-post infection (data not shown). To determine whether Ets1 directly affects type I collagen gene induction by TGF-β, COL1A1, and COL1A2 mRNA levels were compared in dermal fibroblasts infected with either Ets1 or control adenovirus. As shown in Fig. 2, A–C, Ets1 suppressed TGF-β-dependent stimulation of COL1A1 and COL1A2 mRNAs. Both messages were decreased to or below basal level. These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of Ets1 on TGF-β-dependent type I collagen synthesis occurs primarily via the regulation of COL1A1 and COL1A2 mRNA levels. In addition, other TGF-β target genes, including CTGF and TIMP-1, were examined. In agreement with previously published results, TGF-β strongly induced the expression of CTGF (4Abraham D.J. Shiwen X. Black C.M., Sa, S., Xu, Y. Leask A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15220-15225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and TIMP-1 (33Overall C.M. Wrana J.L. Sodek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1860-1869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in control GFP-adenovirus-infected fibroblasts. Significantly, this response was abrogated in cells overexpressing Ets1. These findings indicate that elevated Ets1 expression in human fibroblasts can inhibit the profibrotic effects of TGF-β. It is noteworthy that overexpression of Ets1 did not significantly affect basal levels of type I collagen and other ECM-related genes in unstimulated cells, suggesting that the inhibitory function of Ets1 manifests itself in the context of the TGF-β signaling pathway. Following TGF-β stimulation, Ets1 becomes a strong inhibitor of ECM synthesis, since COL1A2 and TIMP-1 mRNA levels were significantly below the control levels of expression. It has been demonstrated previously that TGF-β abrogates basal and interleukin 1β-dependent stimulation of MMP-1 in dermal fibroblasts (34Yuan W. Varga J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38502-38510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 35Mauviel A. Chung K.Y. Agarwal A. Tamai K. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10917-10923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Ets1 is a well characterized activator of MMP-1 transcription (36Westermarck J. Seth A. Kahari V.M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2651-2660Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of Ets1 on TGF-β inhibition of MMP-1. In agreement with previous studies, we observed that TGF-β inhibits the expression of MMP-1 mRNA in fibroblasts in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2 F, insert) (34Yuan W. Varga J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38502-38510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), whereas in cells overexpressing Ets1, MMP-1 mRNA levels were strongly induced (up to 30-fold) (Fig. 2, A and F). TGF-β had little effect on Ets1-dependent induction of MMP-1. Our results confirm that Ets1 is a potent activator of MMP-1 gene expression, and moreover, that Ets1 expression is able to overcome TGF-β-dependent inhibition of MMP-1 expression. Collectively, our data indicate that Ets1 strongly suppresses TGF-β induction of collagen type I and other matrix-related genes and reverses TGF-β-dependent inhibition of MMP-1. To further analyze the interactions between Ets1 and the TGF-β signaling pathway, we utilized the COL1A2 promoter. In agreement with published observations, TGF-β stimulated the COL1A2 promoter, and this stimulation was further enhanced by overexpression of p300 (Fig. 3 A) (37Ghosh A.K. Yuan W. Mori Y. Varga J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3546-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, Ets1 was a weak inducer of COL1A2 promoter as shown previously by our laboratory (25Czuwara-Ladykowska J. Shirasaki F. Jackers P. Watson D.K. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20839-20848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, in TGF-β-stimulated cells, Ets1 inhibited TGF-β-p300-induced responses. Note that in the absence of TGF-β, Ets1 did not interfere with the p300-dependent up-regulation of COL1A2, suggesting that TGF-β signaling is required for inhibitory activity of Ets1. When p300 was substituted by a histone acetyltransferase-deficient mutant of p300 (p300ΔHAT), both basal transcription and TGF-β-dependent activation of COL1A2 were substantially reduced (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that HAT activity of p300 is required for maximal TGF-β stimulation of this promoter. Previous studies have shown that Ets1 positively regulates the MMP-1 promoter (12Wasylyk C. Gutman A. Nicholson R. Wasylyk B. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In addition, CBP/p300 is known to bind to Ets1 and facilitate the Ets1 trans-activating function (38Yang C. Shapiro L.H. Rivera M. Kumar A. Brindle P.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2218-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We have tested the effects of TGF-β on the Ets1·p300-dependent activation of the MMP-1 promoter in HepG2 cells and dermal fibroblasts. B"

As a model for other evolutionarily conserved Y family members that perform translesion DNA synthesis and have low fidelity, we describe here the base substitution and frameshift fidelity of DNA synthesis by Dpo4. Dpo4 generates all 12 base-base mismatches at high rates, 11 of which are similar to those of its human homolog, DNA polymerase κ. This result is consistent with the Dpo4 structure, implying lower geometric selection for correct base pairs. Surprisingly, Dpo4 generates C·dCMP mismatches at an unusually high average rate and preferentially at cytosine flanked by 5′-template guanine. Dpo4 also has very low frameshift fidelity and frequently generates deletions of even noniterated nucleotides, especially cytosine flanked by a 5′-template guanine. Both unusual features of error specificity suggest that Dpo4 can incorporate dNTP precursors when two template nucleotides are present in the active site binding pocket.

These results have implications for mutagenesis resulting from DNA synthesis by Y family polymerases. Our understanding of spontaneous mutagenesis and lesion bypass during DNA replication has been expanded in the last several years by the discovery of a number of novel DNA polymerases in the Y family (1Ohmori H.

These polymerases all lack intrinsic 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity, and several of them can copy DNA templates containing lesions that slow down or arrest synthesis by polymerases in other families. Among several subdivisions of the Y family, the DinB subfamily consists of enzymes sharing significant sequence homology with the product of the Escherichia coli dinB gene, DNA polymerase IV (2Wagner J.

It is therefore of great interest to understand the molecular basis of low fidelity synthesis by Y family polymerases, especially since they are conserved in all three kingdoms of life. Indeed, the genome of the archaeal aerobic thermophile Sulfolobus solfataricus P2 also contains a DinB homolog designated DNA polymerase IV (Dpo4) (15Boudsocq F. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Woodgate R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4607-4616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, high resolution crystal structures have been described of a ternary complex consisting of Dpo4, primer-template DNA, and a correct nucleotide bound at the active site (16Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Cell. 2001; 107: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). In this structure, the nascent base pair binding pocket is relatively open and has increased solvent accessibility in comparison with polymerases in other families. This predicts that Dpo4 will synthesize DNA with low base substitution fidelity. In support of this possibility, kinetic analysis revealed that Dpo4 inserts incorrect nucleotides at rates ranging from 3 × 10−4 to 8 × 10−3 (15Boudsocq F. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Woodgate R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4607-4616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also of interest is the frameshift fidelity of DinB polymerases. The mesophilic DinB polymerases, E. coli Pol IV and mammalian pol κ, both contribute to single base deletion mutagenesis in vivo (3Kim S.R. Maenhaut-Michel G. Yamada M. Yamamoto Y. Matsui K.

Friedberg E.C. Ohmori H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39678-39684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Early studies (20Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13581-13587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of the error specificity of exonuclease-deficient eukaryotic DNA polymerases α (B family) and β (X family) considered three possible mechanisms for how single base deletions might be generated during DNA synthesis. Deletions in homopolymeric runs could be explained by the classical strand slippage hypothesis (21Streisinger G. Okada Y. Emrich J. Newton J. Tsugita A. Terzaghi E. Inouye M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1966; 31: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). However, deletions of noniterated nucleotides were also generated that were inconsistent with misaligned substrate stability imparted by the correct base pairing possible in repetitive sequences. Thus, two additional hypotheses were put forth. One suggested that some frameshift errors might be initiated by nucleotide misinsertion, followed immediately by primer relocation to create a misaligned deletion intermediate stabilized by one or more correct terminal base pairs (22Kunkel T.A. Soni A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14784-14789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4946-4950Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The other idea (20Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13581-13587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was that a noniterated nucleotide might assume a stable conformation in the active site such that it would not template an incorporation event itself but would not interfere with its neighbor's ability to do so. Support for this hypothesis was provided by kinetic analysis of insertion by human pol β with substrates containing abasic sites (24Efrati E. Tocco G. Eritja R. Wilson S.H. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2559-2569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) or propanodeoxyguanosine adducts (25Hashim M.F. Schnetz-Boutaud N. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20205-20212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Those modified template nucleotides were suggested to be misaligned at the active site, with the misalignment stabilized by the incoming dNTP paired with the next template base. Direct support for misalignment in the active site binding pocket is the structure of Dpo4 in which a template guanine at the active site is unpaired, with incoming dCTP paired with the next template guanine (Fig. 6 b in Ref. 16Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Cell. 2001; 107: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The fact that the active site of Dpo4 can accommodate an unpaired template nucleotide suggests that this polymerase could have low frameshift fidelity, even for loss of noniterated nucleotides. To test these ideas and to establish a comprehensive view of Dpo4 fidelity that can be used in future structure-function studies of this enzyme and other Y family polymerases, here we report the error rates for all 12 base substitutions and for single base deletions in a variety of sequence contexts. The results reveal the generally inaccurate DNA synthesis capacity of Dpo4, and they strongly suggest that many single base deletions and a subset of base substitutions may result from the ability of Dpo4 to polymerize despite the presence of an extra, unpaired template base in the active site. Materials for the forward mutation assay were from previously described sources (26Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). S. solfataricus P2 Dpo4 polymerase was prepared as described previously (15Boudsocq F. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Woodgate R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4607-4616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (30 μl) contained 1 nm gel-purified M13mp2 gapped DNA substrate, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0 at 22 °C), 5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 7.5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2.5% glycerol, and 1 mm dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP. Polymerization reactions were initiated by adding 3.3–10 nm Dpo4, incubated at 70 °C for 1 h, and terminated by adding EDTA to 15 mm. DNA products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis as described (26Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Reaction products were assayed for the frequency of lacZ mutants as described (26Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). DNA from independent lacZ mutant phage was sequenced to identify the types of sequence changes generated during gap-filling synthesis. Since an average of 2.6 errors was identified per lacZ mutant, many of the mutants contained both phenotypically detectable and silent changes. Here the error rates are described as the number of observed mutations divided by the number of nucleotides sequenced. The resulting values are similar to those obtained using the error rate calculation for higher fidelity DNA polymerases described earlier (26Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), which uses only the phenotypically detectable sites, the lacZ mutant frequency, and the value for expression of the nascent strand in E. coli. The 5′-GC substrate was constructed by annealing the following oligonucleotides: 5′-GGT GCG GGC CTC TTC GCT ATT ACG CCA-3′ (primer) and 5′-CCT TTC GCC AG C TGG CGT AAT AGC GAA GAG GCC CGC ACC-3′ (template). A 5′-AC substrate used the same primer and a template in which the G (in boldface type) was replaced by A. Oligonucleotides were annealed by mixing 5′-32P-labeled primer with template in a 1:2 ratio. Mixtures were incubated at 85 °C and slowly cooled to 25 °C. Reaction mixtures (30 μl) contained the same components used for the gap-filling assay except for 170 nm template, 1.1–6.7 nm Dpo4 and seven different concentrations of each individual dNTP. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 70 °C, aliquots were removed at 2-, 4-, 6-, and 8-min time intervals, and the reactions were terminated with adding an equal volume of 95% formamide in 20 mm EDTA. Reaction products were fractionated on a 16% (w/v) denaturing polyacrylamide gel and quantified using a PhosphorImager. Kinetic constants were derived as previously described (27Lewis D.A. Bebenek K. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32924-32930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The fidelity of DNA synthesis by Dpo4 was examined using a forward mutation assay that scores a variety of substitution and frameshift errors generated during copying of a lacZ template in a single-stranded gap in M13mp2 DNA. Correct polymerization produces DNA that yields blue M13 plaques in an E. coliα-complementation strain. Errors are scored as light blue or colorless plaques, and error specificity is defined by sequencing DNA isolated from independent lacZ mutants. Dpo4 copied the 275-nucleotide mutational target sequence and continued to fill the 407-nucleotide gap to apparent completion as determined by agarose gel electrophoresis (data not shown, but see typical analysis in Ref. 26Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The DNA products yielded a lacZ mutant frequency of 16%, a value that is similar to results with human pol κ (5Ohashi E. Bebenek K. Matsuda T. Feaver W.J. Gerlach V.L. Friedberg E.C. Ohmori H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39678-39684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and substantially higher than for polymerases in the A, B, or X families. Sequence analysis of the 275-nucleotide lacZ target in 182 independent lacZ mutants (50,050 total nucleotides) revealed 476 sequence changes (i.e. 2.6 changes per mutant). Among these, 326 (70%) were single base substitutions (Fig. 1), and 116 (25%) were single base deletions (open triangles in Fig. 1). The remaining changes included nine single base additions (Fig. 1,slashes), nine tandem double base substitutions, and 16 other examples of one or a few two-base deletions, two-base additions, combined substitution-additions, combined substitution-deletions, large deletions, and more complex changes (not shown). Fig. 2 compares the average error rates of Dpo4 with those of other exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerases obtained using the M13mp2 forward mutation assay. The substitution error rate for Dpo4 is 6.5 × 10−3 (326/50,050). This is comparable with the rate for the homologous human pol κ (5Ohashi E. Bebenek K. Matsuda T. Feaver W.J. Gerlach V.L. Friedberg E.C. Ohmori H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39678-39684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and 4–5-fold lower than for mouse and human pol η. All four Y family enzymes listed have substantially higher substitution rates than do polymerases in the A, B, and X families (DNA polymerases γ, α, and β, respectively) (Fig. 2 A). Thus, Dpo4 serves as a good model for the generally low base substitution fidelity of Y family polymerases in the DinB and Rad30A subfamilies. Dpo4 generated all 12 single base-base mismatches (Table I), and these were widely distributed in many different sequence contexts throughout the target sequence (Fig. 1). As is the case with other DNA polymerases, the highest Dpo4 error rate was observed for the T-dGMP mismatch, 4.7 × 10−3. The lowest error rate was 0.6 × 10−3 for the G·dAMP mismatch, yielding a range of error rates of only 8-fold. The error rates for Dpo4 are similar to those for the human DinB homolog, pol κ (5Ohashi E. Bebenek K. Matsuda T. Feaver W.J. Gerlach V.L. Friedberg E.C. Ohmori H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39678-39684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), except for the C-dCMP rate, which was unusually high with Dpo4 (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, C-dCMP is the most common misinsertion event generated by the homologous Dbh pol from Sso strain P1 (28Silvian L.F. Toth E.A. Pham P. Goodman M.F. Ellenberger T. Nat. Struct.

Open table in a new tab The template target sequence contains 68 adenines, 67 thymines, 61 guanines, and 79 cytosines. The single base deletion error rate for Dpo4 is 2.3 × 10−3. This is comparable with the deletion error rates of other Y family enzymes and is much higher than for polymerases in other families (Fig. 2 C). To consider whether the deletions generated by Dpo4 might be initiated by strand slippage, we used the information in Fig. 1 and Table I to calculate subclasses of deletions in different sequence contexts. The average rate for deleting any of the 97 noniterated template nucleotides in the target was calculated to be 1.7 × 10−3. This is similar to the rates at which nucleotides were deleted from repetitive sequence tracts of 2–5 nucleotides (Fig. 3 A). A similar, minimal dependence of error rate on repeat tract length has previously been observed for human pol κ (5Ohashi E. Bebenek K. Matsuda T. Feaver W.J. Gerlach V.L. Friedberg E.C. Ohmori H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39678-39684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and pol η (29Matsuda T. Bebenek K. Masutani C. Rogozin I.B. Hanaoka F. Kunkel T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In contrast, deletion error rates for polymerases in other families are lower, and those rates typically increase with increasing repetitive tract length. As one example, the rate of single base deletions by exonuclease-deficient human pol γ (A family) within iterated tracts of 4 or 5 nucleotides is 26 times greater than the rate in noniterated DNA (Fig. 3 B). The smaller dependence of single-base deletion error rate on repetitive sequence length by Dpo4 implies that most deletions are initiated by a mechanism other than strand slippage. In consideration of what the deletion mechanism might be, we analyzed the two unusual features of Dpo4 error specificity in greater detail. Surprisingly, 54% of the nonreiterated nucleotides deleted by Dpo4 were cytosine, a preference not seen in previous studies of any other polymerase. Cytosine deletions were not randomly distributed in the target; 19 of the 26 noniterated cytosines that were deleted were flanked by a 5′-template guanine (Fig. 1). Equally surprisingly, the third most common base substitution error indicated formation of a C-dCMP mismatch (Table I, column 4). This mismatch is rarely produced by polymerases in other families (e.g. see Ref. 30Mendelman L.V. Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14415-14423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, the C·dCMP intermediate is generated by Dpo4 at a rate that is 12-fold higher than for pol κ and even higher than for pol η (Fig. 2 B), despite the fact that pol η has lower base substitution fidelity overall (Fig. 2 A). As observed for the noniterated cytosine deletions, 30 of 34 C·dCMP errors generated by Dpo4 were flanked by a 5′-template guanine (Fig. 1, Table I). This strong preference for a flanking template guanine for both errors and the misaligned ternary complex structure previously observed (16Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Cell. 2001; 107: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) suggest a common mechanism in which Dpo4 skips the template cytosine and incorporates dCTP when paired with the flanking guanine (Fig. 4). If dCMP incorporation is immediately followed by correct synthesis, a deletion will result from the extended misalignment (pathway F, forframeshift). However, realignment prior to further incorporation (pathway B, for base substitution) will generate a C·C mismatch at the primer terminus whose extension will result in a C to G substitution. To test this transient misalignment model for formation of C·dCMP mismatches, we determined steady state parameters for insertion of each of the four dNTPs with a cytosine (we used lacZ template position 146; Fig. 1) present as the first template nucleotide in an oligonucleotide substrate. The Km and Vmaxvalues (Table II) were used to calculate the ability of Dpo4 to discriminate between correct incorporation of dGMP and “apparently incorrect” incorporation of dCMP when the template contained either a 5′-flanking guanine or adenine. With the 5′-GC template, discrimination (fins) between insertion of dGMP and dCMP was 0.042 (Table II, line 2). This is similar to the value of 0.027 for stable misincorporation (i.e. insertion plus mismatch extension) of dCMP opposite this same template cytosine during gap-filling synthesis, where five C to G substitutions were observed at position 146 among 182 lacZ mutants (Fig. 1). The active site misalignment model predicts that changing the flanking template base to adenine should decrease dCMP insertion because dCTP opposite template A would be incorrect. This prediction is fulfilled with the 5′-AC template, where discrimination against dCMP insertion was increased by 18-fold (fins = 0.0023, Table II). As an internal control, note that discrimination against insertion of dAMP opposite C was similar using the 5′-GC and 5′-AC templates (0.0084 and 0.012, respectively), as predicted by the model.Table IINucleotide insertion by Dpo4 opposite template cytosineTemplatedNTPKmkcatkcat/Kmfinsμmmin−1(μm · min)−15′-GC-3′dGTP1.6 ± 0.15.0 ± 0.53.1 ± 0.11.0dCTP26 ± 4.93.3 ± 0.70.13 ± 0.010.042dATP76 ± 162.0 ± 0.00.026 ± 0.0060.0084dTTP140 ± 442.3 ± 0.10.017 ± 0.0050.00555′-AC-3′dGTP1.9 ± 0.35.3 ± 0.92.8 ± 0.91.0dCTP120 ± 360.77 ± 0.010.0065 ± 0.00220.0023dATP82 ± 122.9 ± 0.10.035 ± 0.0040.012dTTP75 ± 5.73.1 ± 0.40.041 ± 0.0080.015Reactions were performed and kinetic constants were calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Reactions were performed and kinetic constants were calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To see if this misalignment mechanism could theoretically explain other substitutions, we analyzed the sequence contexts for all 12 mismatches produced by Dpo4 (Table I). As mentioned above, 88% (30/34) of all C to G substitutions occurred at a 5′-GC-3′ template sequence. This is a greater proportion than would be expected by chance, since only 22 of 79 cytosines in the target (28%) are flanked by a 5′-G (Table I, line 12). As a consequence, the average rate of C to G substitutions flanked by G is 75 × 10−4, which is 19-fold higher than the rate of 3.3 × 10−4 for all other template cytosines. The 19-fold difference in rate at 5′-GC sequences compared with 5′-(A/T/C)C sequences (Table I, last line, last column) is similar to the 18-fold decrease in dCMP misinsertion resulting from replacement of the flanking G with A (Table II). A similar analysis of T to G transversions (Table I, line 6) indicates that T·dCMP mismatches are also preferentially generated in a manner consistent with active site misalignment. Thus, 79% of these substitutions were at the 19% of template thymines flanked by a 5′-G, yielding an error rate that is 15-fold higher than for the same substitution flanked by the other three bases. This substitution also involves a template pyrimidine and incoming dCTP. It is notable that dCMP incorporated opposite a template G is the most catalytically favored event for Dpo4 among the four possible correct base pairs (15Boudsocq F. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Woodgate R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4607-4616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the reciprocal error involving a template C and incoming dTMP revealed a 3-fold sequence-dependent bias in error rate. A 3-fold sequence-dependent bias was also seen with the A·dCMP mismatch, the third possible error involving incoming dCTP, as well as with the A·dAMP mismatch. This study provides a comprehensive view of the fidelity of DNA synthesis by Sso Dpo4, a DinB DNA polymerase in the Y family. When copying undamaged DNA, Dpo4 is highly inaccurate for essentially all types of single base substitutions and deletions in a large number of different sequence contexts. This generally low fidelity was anticipated by homology to other Y family members that also have low fidelity (5Ohashi E. Bebenek K. Matsuda T. Feaver W.J. Gerlach V.L. Friedberg E.C. Ohmori H.

Biol. 2001; 312: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In fact, Dpo4 and its human homolog DNA polymerase κ generate most base substitutions at remarkably similar rates, and these rates are much higher than those generated by polymerases in the A, B, and X families. Like human pol κ and pol η, Dpo4 also generates an unusually high rate of single base deletions, including deletions of noniterated bases whose loss is not predicted by the classical strand slippage hypothesis. These common fidelity characteristics are interesting in light of recently published structures of Y family polymerases. These include the apoenzyme structures of S. cerevisiae pol η (31Trincao J. Johnson R.E. Escalante C.R. Prakash S. Prakash L. Aggarwal A.K. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 417-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and the full-length (28Silvian L.F. Toth E.A. Pham P. Goodman M.F. Ellenberger T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 984-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and N-terminal fragment of S. solfataricus P1 Dbh polymerase (32Zhou B. Pata J.D. Steitz T.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 427-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Most relevant to this study are the structures of two different ternary complexes of SsoDpo4 with primer-template DNA and a nucleotide bound at the active site (16Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Cell. 2001; 107: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). These structures reveal that Y family members have the same general right hand shape and thumb, fingers, and palm subdomains found in polymerases in other families. The structures of the palms suggest that Y family members have a catalytic mechanism in common with other polymerases. However, several structural features of Y family polymerases are distinctive. Dpo4 has a “little finger” subdomain that is not present in other polymerase families but is present in Sso Dbh (designated “wrist” in Ref. 28Silvian L.F. Toth E.A. Pham P. Goodman M.F. Ellenberger T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 984-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and in yeast pol η (designated “PAD” in Ref. 31Trincao J. Johnson R.E. Escalante C.R. Prakash S. Prakash L. Aggarwal A.K. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 417-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The Dpo4 little finger fits into the major groove upstream of the active site and contacts the backbone of both strands. It is tethered to the thumb via a positively charged loop that contacts the template strand backbone. The Dpo4 thumb is smaller than that observed in polymerases in other families and it contacts the backbone of both strands on the opposite (minor groove) side of the duplex. The primer-template is B-form, with a minor groove that is deeper and narrower than in most other polymerase-DNA structures. Dpo4 does not contact any bases in the minor groove upstream of the active site, which differs from other polymerases (e.g. see Fig. 2 in Ref. 33Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2000; 65: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which may use such contacts to probe for base pairing correct geometry. The fingers domain of Dpo4 that contacts the incoming nucleotide and the single-stranded template is unusually small and lacks the α-helix in other polymerases (34Sawaya M.R. Pelletier H. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1930-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 35Doublié S. Tabor S. Long A.M. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T.

Nature. 1998; 391: 304-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) that has a critical role in fidelity (reviewed in Ref. 33Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2000; 65: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The side chains surrounding the nascent base pair in Dpo4 are small and hydrophobic, in contrast to the larger side chains present in other polymerases. Thus, the nascent base pair binding pocket in Dpo4 is relatively open and has increased solvent accessibility in comparison with polymerases in other families. These structural features are consistent with the ability of Dpo4 to incorporate various mismatches in different sequence contexts at relatively high rates (Fig. 1 and Table I), regardless of differences in mismatch shape, size, orientation, or base hydrogen bonding, stacking, or hydration potential. Pyrimidine·pyrimidine mispairs have been suggested to be sterically excluded from polymerase active site binding pockets by the increased bulk resulting from bound water molecules that are not efficiently displaced during noncomplementary base pairing (37Kool E.T. Biopolymers. 1998; 48: 3-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Consistent with this is the observation that C·dCMP is usually the least frequent mismatch generated by DNA polymerases, including pol α and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (30Mendelman L.V. Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14415-14423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Mendelman L.V. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2338-2346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and pol η (29Matsuda T. Bebenek K. Masutani C. Rogozin I.B. Hanaoka F. Kunkel T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and pol κ (5Ohashi E. Bebenek K. Matsuda T. Feaver W.J. Gerlach V.L. Friedberg E.C. Ohmori H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39678-39684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Thus, we were surprised to see that the average C·dCMP error rate for the 79 cytosines monitored in this study was unusually high (Table I, last line, and Fig. 2 B). Five observations suggest that most of these errors involve correct dCMP incorporation opposite the template guanine flanking a preceding, unpaired cytosine, followed by realignment and mismatch extension (Fig. 4, pathway B). The first is the structure of a ternary complex of Dpo4 revealing an unpaired template strand base in the active site binding pocket and the next template base correctly paired with an incoming dNTP (Fig. 6 b in Ref. 16Ling H. Boudsocq F. Woodgate R. Yang W. Cell. 2001; 107: 91-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The second is the fact that the error rate for C to G transversions is 19-fold higher when C is flanked by G rather than the other bases (Table I). The third is the observation that discrimination against dCMP insertion is 18-fold lower when cytosine is flanked by G than when flanked by A (Table II). Fourth is the fact that template cytosine flanked by guanine is the most frequently deleted nucleotide. This is consistent with pathway F of the model (Fig. 4), wherein dCMP incorporation is simply followed by continued correct synthesis without realignment. Finally, the limited effect of increasing repeat sequence length on the deletion error rate of Dpo4 (Fig. 3) suggests that an unpaired nucleotide can exist in the substrate (e.g. as seen in the misaligned Dpo4 structure) without being stabilized by the correct base pairing that is possible in repetitive DNA. How general is the misalignment mechanism for different errors and different polymerases? The branched pathway in Fig. 4 can account for a substantial proportion of errors generated by Dpo4. Among base substitutions (Table I), pathway B can account for almost all errors involving incoming dCTP opposite C or T, a smaller portion of the third mismatch involving dCTP opposite A and possibly some mismatches involving incoming dATP opposite A. Dpo4 crystal structures with the inferred misaligned intermediates might provide insights into why template pyrimidines and incoming dCTP seem to be particularly preferred. Pathway F (Fig. 4) can readily account for deletions of noniterated nucleotides, and it may also contribute to deleting iterated nucleotides as well. This mechanism may be common to other Y family polymerases, since the limited effect of repeat sequence length on Dpo4 deletion rate (Fig. 3 A) is shared by human pol κ (5Ohashi E. Bebenek K. Matsuda T. Feaver W.J. Gerlach V.L. Friedberg E.C. Ohmori H. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39678-39684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and pol η (29Matsuda T. Bebenek K. Masutani C. Rogozin I.B. Hanaoka F. Kunkel T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 335-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Since these human polymerases and Dpo4 were assayed for fidelity at 37 and 70 °C, respectively, this further suggests that active site misalignment readily occurs at both temperatures during replication. This does not exclude the possibility that reaction temperature may affect the rate of misalignment or the balance between extension of mispaired versus mismatched termini (see branch point of Fig. 4). In addition, since mutations consistent with active site misalignment are observed at much lower frequencies during replication at 70 °C by the A family Taq polymerase (39Eckert K.A. Kunkel T.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3739-3744Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), it is likely that unique structural elements associated with Dpo4 and other Y family polymerases stabilize the misalignment. Interestingly, the error spectrum in Fig. 1 indicates that certain 5′-GC-3′ sequences yield C to G substitutions (e.g. nucleotide 146), whereas others yield deletions of C (e.g. nucleotide 9). Thus, additional sequence contexts, such as the identity of the primer terminal base pair, may determine whether realignment (Fig. 4, pathway B) or direct primer extension (pathway F) occurs. This balance may differ among polymerases, even those in the same family. Thus, Dpo4, pol κ, and pol η share common frameshift error rates (Fig. 2 C) and limited response to increasing run length, yet the latter two enzymes do not share with Dpo4 the preferential formation of C·dCMP or T·dCMP mismatches in specific sequence contexts. However, C·dCMP and T·dCMP have the highest relative misincorporation efficiencies of formation among all mispairs for the Dbh polymerase of Sso P1. It is speculated that these mispairs may arise from misalignments in either the 5′ or 3′ direction and over more than one base along the template strand (28Silvian L.F. Toth E.A. Pham P. Goodman M.F. Ellenberger T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 984-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Therefore, enhanced formation of these specific mispairs by strand misalignment may be a common property of archaeal DinB polymerases. Finally, the ability of Dpo4 and perhaps other Y family members to incorporate a dNTP while an unpaired template strand nucleotide is located in the active site binding pocket may be relevant to their ability to bypass certain lesions and to sometimes generate deletions while doing so (10Levine R.L.

https://openalex.org/W2061599671,"Cell adhesion-dependent signaling implicates cytoplasmic proteins interacting with the intracellular tails of integrins. Among those, the integrincytoplasmic domain-associatedprotein 1α (ICAP-1α) has been shown to interact specifically with the β1 integrin cytoplasmic domain. Although it is likely that this protein plays an important role in controlling cell adhesion and migration, little is known about its actual function. To search for potential ICAP-1α-binding proteins, we used a yeast two-hybrid screen and identified the human metastatic suppressor protein nm23-H2 as a new partner of ICAP-1α. This direct interaction was confirmed in vitro, using purified recombinant ICAP-1α and nm23-H2, and by co-immunoprecipitation from CHO cell lysates over-expressing ICAP-1α. The physiological relevance of this interaction is provided by confocal fluorescence microscopy, which shows that ICAP-1α and nm23-H2 are co-localized in lamellipodia during the early stages of cell spreading. These adhesion sites are enriched in occupied β1 integrins and precede the formation of focal adhesions devoid of ICAP-1α and nm23-H2, indicating the dynamic segregation of components of matrix adhesions. This peripheral staining of ICAP-1α and nm23-H2 is only observed in cells spreading on fibronectin and collagen and is absent in cells spreading on poly-l-lysine, vitronectin, or laminin. This is consistent with the fact that targeting of both ICAP-1α and nm23-H2 to the cell periphery is dependent on β1 integrin engagement rather than being a consequence of cell adhesion. This finding represents the first evidence that the tumor suppressor nm23-H2 could act on β1 integrin-mediated cell adhesion by interacting with one of the integrin partners, ICAP-1α.

This finding represents the first evidence that the tumor suppressor nm23-H2 could act on β1 integrin-mediated cell adhesion by interacting with one of the integrin partners, ICAP-1α. Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix is mediated mainly by integrin clusters organized in transient focal complexes and more stable focal adhesions (1Clark E.A. King W.G. Brugge J.S. Symons M. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 2Zamir E. Geiger B. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3583-3590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Ridley A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F107-F109Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These structures are linked physically to the actin cytoskeleton. Besides being the mechanical anchors of the cells, focal adhesions participate in outside-in and inside-out signaling. Integrin cytoplasmic domains have no known catalytic function, but they play a key role in the control of cytoskeleton organization and in signal transduction by recruiting many structural and signaling proteins (4Calderwood D.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22607-22610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Although it is well documented that the adhesive function of most members of the integrin family can be activated in a phenotypically similar fashion, it is unclear whether common or independent cellular pathways underlie this apparent uniformity. Several proteins interacting with specific integrin cytoplasmic tails have been identified recently, suggesting that although the cytoplasmic domains of integrin β subunits are quite similar, they are coupled to distinct functional pathways. For instance, β3-endonexin binds specifically to the β3 integrin cytoplasmic tail (5Shattil S.J. O'Toole T. Eigenthaler M. Thon V. Williams M. Babior B.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and increases the affinity of the integrin αIIbβ3 (6Kashiwagi H. Schwartz M.A. Eigenthaler M. Davis K.A. Ginsberg M.H.

A β2 integrin cytoplasmic domain-binding protein, cytohesin-1, has been found to increase αLβ2-mediated cell adhesion (7Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B. Zeitlmann L. Godar S. Stockinger H. Seed B.

TAP-20 interacts with the β5 integrin and negatively regulates αvβ5-dependent adhesion and focal adhesion assembly (8Tang S. Gao Y. Ware J.A. J.

To elucidate the molecular basis of the ICAP-1α signaling pathway, we have carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify its binding partners. Here we report that ICAP-1α interacts with the human metastatic suppressor protein nm23-H2 (called also NDP kinase B) (12Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Flint S.J. Ferrone C.A. Science. 1993; 261: 478-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), a cellular protein belonging to a family of highly conserved proteins in eukaryotes. Nm23 family proteins possess a nucleoside diphosphate kinase activity (13Parks R.E.J. Argawal R.P. The Enzymes. 8. Academic Press, New York1973: 307-334Google Scholar, 14Wagner P.D. Vu N.D. J. Biol.

Bioenerg. 2000; 32: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Eight different genes of this family have now been identified in humans and were named nm23-H1, nm23-H2, to nm23-H8 (16Lacombe M.L. Milon L. Munier A. Mehus J.G. Lambeth D.O. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Apart from their role in nucleotides metabolism, nm23 isoforms are reportedly involved in a variety of cellular functions (17Lombardi D. Lacombe M.L. Paggi M.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 144-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Nm23-H2 has been shown to bind to the nuclease hypersensitive element of the c-myc and PDGF-A (platelet-derived growth factor A) promoter (12Postel E.H. Berberich S.J. Flint S.J. Ferrone C.A.

Interestingly, expression of the nm23 genes is linked to suppression of tumor metastasis, differentiation, apoptosis, proliferation, and DNA mutation (19de la Rosa A. Williams R.L. Steeg P.S.

Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1971-1973PubMed Google Scholar) report that murine melanoma cell lines and human breast carcinoma cells stably transfected with nm23-H1 lose their ability to migrate in response to different factors. Zhu et al. (25Zhu J. Tseng Y.H. Kantor J.D. Rhodes C.J. Zetter B.R. Moyers J.S. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14911-14918Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) report that nm23-H1 interacts with the Ras-related GTPase member Rad and reversibly converts GDP-Rad to GTP-Rad, thus acting as an exchange factor and a GTPase-activating protein for Rad. More recently, an association between nm23-H1 and Tiam1, a product of an invasion and metastasis-inducing gene, has been shown. This interaction could lead to the down-regulation of Rac1 activity (26Otsuki Y. Tanaka M. Yoshii S. Kawazoe N. Nakaya K. Sugimura H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4385-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The mechanism of tumor suppression by nm23 is still poorly understood, although some speculations about the role of the enzyme have been presented (19de la Rosa A. Williams R.L. Steeg P.S. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that ICAP-1α and nm23-H2 interact directly, co-localize and concentrate in peripheral ruffles, and are recruited to β1 integrin-rich cell adhesion sites in cells spreading on fibronectin and collagen. This particular cell localization supports the view that this association is relevant to a physiological process during the early stages of cell adhesion. It is the first report linking the tumor suppressor protein nm23-H2 to the cell adhesion and migration machinery. Human fibroblasts (Hs-68) were kindly provided by Dr. C. Gauthier-Rouvière (Montpellier, France). Fibronectin was extracted from human plasma as described previously (27Engvall E. Ruoslahti E. Int. J. Cancer. 1977; 20: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar). The pAS2-1/ICAM-1 and pACT2/α-actinin-1 vectors were kindly provided by Dr. A. Duperray (Grenoble, France). Monoclonal antibodies against nm23-H1 or -2 were purchased from Seigakaku (distributed by Coger, Paris, France). Rhodamin-phalloidin was from Sigma-Aldrich. Rabbit anti-ICAP-1α antiserum was raised in our laboratory by immunizing rabbits with purified recombinant ICAP-1α as described previously (11Bouvard D. Block M.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies directed against nm23-H2, provided by Dr. I. Lascu (University of Bordeaux, France), were affinity-purified and depleted of antibodies cross-reacting with nm23-H1. The monoclonal antibody 12G10 directed against β1 integrin was kindly provided by Dr. M. J. Humphries (University of Manchester, UK). The monoclonal antibody 4B7R, directed against human β1 integrin, was purchased from Neomarkers (distributed by MedGene Science, Pantin, France), monoclonal antibody anti-Rac1 was from Transduction Laboratories (distributed by Interchim, Montlucon, France), monoclonal antibody directed against tubulin and vimentin were from Sigma-Aldrich and Roche Molecular Biochemicals, respectively. Goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase were from Bio-Rad Laboratories and Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (distributed by Beckman Coulter, Roissy, France), respectively. Laminin, vitronectin, polylysine, and collagens I and IV were from Sigma-Aldrich. Mouse monoclonal anti-ICAP-1α antibodies (4D1D6 and 9B10) were prepared using recombinant His-tagged ICAP-1α protein as antigen. Briefly, hybridoma supernatants were screened initially by ELISA and Western blotting using recombinant His-tagged ICAP-1α protein. The monoclonal antibody 4D1D6 was further selected for reactivity in immunofluorescence studies. Recombinant His-tagged ICAP-1α protein was also used for the production of rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Elevage des Dombes, Romans, France) that have been tested by Western blot using recombinant ICAP-1α and mammalian cell lysates. A cDNA fragment encoding the full-length human ICAP1-α protein was inserted into the NdeI/BamHI sites of pAS2-1 vector (CLONTECH distributed by Ozyme, Montigny le Bretonneux, France). The sequence of the bait construct was verified by DNA sequencing, and the construct was introduced into Y190 yeast cells using a lithium acetate transformation protocol. The resulting construct (pAS2-1/ICAP-1α) was used as bait to screen a human placenta MATCHMAKER cDNA library (6 × 106 independent clones) according the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, Y190 (pAS2-1/ICAP1α) cells transformed by the library plasmids were selected by plating on SD medium lacking tryptophan and leucine (SD-WL). Interaction of proteins encoded by pAS2-1/ICAP-1α and by the pACT2 library vectors was tested by growing the cells in the presence of 25 mm 3′-amino-1,2,4,-triazole (SD − WLH + 3AT). Histidine-positive colonies were further tested for LacZ activation. The growth of blue colonies in the histidine-deficient medium indicated a positive interaction. 42 positive yeast colonies, as indicated by activation of both reporter genes (histidine and lacZ) were independently identified and isolated. Plasmids were isolated from positive yeast clones by a glass beads/phenol-chloroform extraction protocol provided by the manufacturer (CLONTECH). Escherichia coli 1066 bacteria were then electroporated with purified plasmids according to the protocol provided by Qiagen. The pACT2 plasmids were isolated from E. coli 1066 and restriction (Hin dIII)-mapped. Subsequently, the sequences of the inserts were determined by DNA sequencing (Genaxis, Nimes, France). The specificity of positive colonies with respect to the protein/protein interaction was further confirmed by testing ICAM-1 cytoplasmic domain inserted in pAS2-1, an irrelevant protein in this context and α-actinin-1 inserted in pACT2, a protein present in focal adhesions. Recombinant His-tagged ICAP-1α protein was purified from BL21(DE3) E. coli strain transformed with the prokaryotic expression vector pET19b/ICAP-1α (pET19b plasmid purchased from Novagen). The expression of ICAP-1α was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 3–5 h. Bacteria resuspended in PBS were sonicated and centrifuged (20,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). Soluble His-tagged ICAP-1α protein was purified by affinity for nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Ni-NTA, Qiagen), washed with 40 ml of wash buffer (60 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9), and eluted with elution buffer (1 mimidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9). After dialysis against PBS to eliminate imidazole, the protein purity was checked on SDS-PAGE. The same protocol was used for ICAP-1α fragments. Recombinant Nm23-H2 protein and NDPK from Dictyostelium discoideum, provided by Dr. I. Lascu, were prepared as described previously (28Gonin P., Xu, Y. Milon L. Dabernat S. Morr M. Kumar R. Lacombe M.L. Janin J. Lascu I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7265-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The interaction between recombinant ICAP-1α and recombinant nm23-H2 was analyzed using a solid phase assay. Briefly, a 96-well tray (MaxiSorp, Nunc) was coated with either ICAP-1α proteins (40 μg/ml) or NDPK proteins (nm23-H2 or NDPK from D. discoideum; 10 μg/ml), for 16 h at 4 °C and blocked with a PBS, 3% BSA solution for 1 h at room temperature. Increasing concentrations of soluble nm23-H2 or ICAP-1α were incubated for 1 h. After three washes in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, detection of bound nm23-H2 or ICAP-1α was performed using the affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies directed against nm23-H2 or monoclonal antibody 9B10 directed against ICAP-1α. Nonspecific binding to BSA-coated wells was subtracted from the results as background. His-tagged ICAP-1α fragments, cloned into pET19 vectors (Novagen), were purified from the soluble fraction of BL21(DE3) E. coli strains by affinity for cobalt-charged TALON resin (CLONTECH). The ICAP-1α-bound resin was washed with PBS, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, blocked with PBS, 3% BSA, and used for pull-down experiments. Interaction assays were performed for 30 min at room temperature using recombinant nm23-H2 or HeLa cell lysates as the source of cellular nm23-H2. Purified recombinant nm23-H2 (5 μg) was diluted in PBS, 3% BSA, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mmimidazole, and HeLa cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 20 mm Tris, pH 8, 137 mm NaCl containing protease inhibitors. Bound proteins were washed with PBS, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting using an affinity-purified anti-nm23 polyclonal antibodies specific to nm23-H2. CHO cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1/ICAP-1α or pcDNA3.1 vector using Exgen (Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim, France). Twenty-four hours after the transfection, the cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40/glycerol buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors for 45 min. The cell lysates (500 μg of proteins) were incubated with 20 μl of 9B10 ascites containing anti-ICAP-1α monoclonal antibody for 2 h. Subsequently, the samples were mixed with 60 μl of immobilized protein G (Sigma-Aldrich). After incubation for 1 h, the beads were washed four times with the lysis buffer, and the bound proteins were released from the beads by boiling in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min. The samples were analyzed by Western blotting with either rabbit polyclonal anti-ICAP-1α antibodies (to check the immunoprecipitation of ICAP-1α) or affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti–nm23-H2 antibodies (to evaluate the interaction between ICAP-1α and endogenous nm23-H2). Immunological detection was achieved with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and the staining was carried out with ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Hs68 cells were cultured as a monolayer in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and harvested with trypsin/EDTA. The cells were plated on coverslips that were precoated with 25 μg/ml human plasma fibronectin and incubated for different lengths of times (as specified for each experiment) in a 37 °C incubator under a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere to obtain cells at different stages of spreading. Within the first hour of plating, extensive membrane ruffling was observed in many of the cells that were spreading on fibronectin. Under these experimental conditions, most of the cells were fully spread within 4 h. The cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. Nonspecific sites were blocked in 10% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were stained for 1 h with either monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies in a moist chamber. Anti-nm23-H2 monoclonal (Seigakaku) and polyclonal antibodies were used at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. Anti ICAP-1α 4D1D6 monoclonal from hybridoma supernatant was used at a ratio of 1:3 and anti ICAP-1α polyclonal antibodies were used at 1:500. The 4B7R monoclonal antibody specific for human β1 integrin was used at 5 μg/ml, anti-Rac1 was used at 2.5 μg/ml, and anti-tubulin at 1:100. After rinsing, coverslips were incubated with appropriate Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, distributed by Interchim) for 30 min. For actin staining, coverslips were incubated with TRITC-phalloidin. The cells were mounted in Mowiol solution and viewed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss LSM 410). To identify the proteins directly involved in ICAP-1α-mediated transduction signals, we used the full-length ICAP-1α cDNΑ fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain as bait in a yeast two-hybrid system to screen a human placenta cDNA library. Forty-two positive clones were obtained and sequenced. BLAST searches in cDNA data bases revealed that four inserts overlap with the cytoplasmic domain of β1 integrin, confirming the reported ICAP-1α/β1 integrin interaction already described (9Chang D.D. Wong C. Smith H. Liu J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1149-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Four additional inserts coded for the human protein named nm23-H2. Introduction of only pAS-2/ICAP-1α or pACT2/nm23-H2 construction did not result in activation of both reporter genes, indicating that neither ICAP-1α nor nm23-H2 can activate the reporter genes in the absence of the other binding partner (Fig. 1). In additional control experiments, another “bait,” the cytoplasmic domain of ICAM-1, and another “prey,” α-actinin-1, were tested for interaction with nm23-H2 and ICAP-1α, respectively. In all of these cases, no detectable β-galactosidase activity was observed, characterizing the specificity of our screen. To confirm the direct interaction of nm23-H2 with ICAP-1α, we carried out an ELISA-based solid phase binding assay. These experiments revealed a saturable binding of ICAP-1α to nm23-H2 and vice versa (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, NDPK from D. discoideum did not bind to ICAP-1α. In an independent approach to corroborate these results, we incubated recombinant His-tagged ICAP-1α bound to a cobalt chelating resin with a solution of purified recombinant nm23-H2 protein or with HeLa cell lysates containing endogenous nm23-H2 (Fig. 2 B). In both cases, nm23-H2 bound to ICAP-1α protein as revealed by Western blot analysis. The results obtained with these pull-down assays indicate that recombinant ICAP-1α interacts with recombinant nm23-H2 protein detected as a monomer and an SDS-resistant dimer. When endogenous nm23-H2 from HeLa cells was used instead, only the dimeric form of nm23-H2 was retained by ICAP-1α. We presume that this dimer is due to oxidative conditions in our experimental procedure. 2TALON resin should not be exposed to high concentrations of a strong reducing agents such as dithiothreitol, dithioerythritol, or β-mercaptoethanol. These reagents reduce the cobalt ions and thereby prevent them from binding His-tagged proteins. The interaction with nm23-H2 was also tested with recombinant protein containing the N-terminal (1–99) or C-terminal (100–200) half of ICAP-1α protein by pull-down assay (Fig. 2 B) and solid phase assay (Fig. 2 C). Only the C-terminal polypeptide was able to interact strongly with recombinant or cellular nm23-H2, supporting the idea that the nm23-H2 binding site is localized at the ICAP-1α C-terminal half. To determine whether the interaction between ICAP-1α and nm23-H2 also occurred ex vivo, we expressed ICAP-1α by transient transfection in CHO cells. Soluble extracts were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Only in ICAP-1α-transfected cells, immunoprecipitation of ICAP-1α using the anti-ICAP-1α 9B10 monoclonal antibody resulted in a co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous nm23-H2 as detected by Western blot analysis using an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody (Fig. 2 D). Thus, consistent with ICAP-1α/nm23-H2 interaction detected in yeast cells and in vitro, ICAP-1α and nm23-H2 form a complex in mammalian cells. To ascribe a physiological role to the association between ICAP-1α and nm23-H2, we examined their co-localization in vivo. To analyze the subcellular localization of ICAP-1α, we generated a monoclonal ICAP-1α antibody that recognizes both recombinant and endogenous human ICAP-1α in immunofluorescence studies. By immunoblotting with His-tagged fusion proteins containing different domains of the ICAP-1α protein, we showed that this antibody recognizes an epitope located within the N-terminal 100 amino acid residues (not shown). This antibody was specific because it reacted neither with a His-tagged fusion protein containing the C-terminal region of ICAP-1α nor with other irrelevant His-tagged fusion proteins (data not shown). Despite the observed association of ICAP-1α with the cytoplasmic domain of β1 integrin, we obtained no evidence for ICAP-1α accumulation at β1 integrin- or vinculin-rich focal adhesion sites in fully spread cells. ICAP-1α was found primarily in the cytosol, with some concentrations in the perinuclear or nuclear region. We therefore analyzed the subcellular localization of ICAP-1α in cells during the early stages of spreading. Hs68 cells newly plated on fibronectin-coated coverslips were stained with either polyclonal or monoclonal anti-ICAP-1α antibodies. ICAP-1α was observed to be highly concentrated at the edge or at peripheral ruffles of spreading cells (Fig. 3). A similar localization of nm23-H2 was observed with the monoclonal as well as the specific polyclonal antibodies. Noticeably, until 45 min of adhesion, ICAP-1α co-localized with nm23-H2 in many cell adhesion sites resembling ruffles or lamellipodia at the cell periphery, suggesting that ICAP-1α and nm23-H2 are involved in integrin-mediated cell spreading (Fig. 3). As cells spread further (1 h after seeding), both ICAP-1α and nm23-H2 staining at the cell edges decreased. Thus, high concentrations of ICAP-1α and nm23-H2 appear transiently at the cell periphery during the process of spreading. We noted that immunostaining with anti-ICAP-1α antibodies showed a labeling similar to that of stress fibers in fully spread cells. Previous studies have shown that α5β1integrins accumulate in the peripheral ruffles of cells spreading on fibronectin (29Tawil N. Wilson P. Carbonetto S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We confirmed such a localization of β1integrin at the edge of the spreading cells and showed in addition co-localization of β1 integrins with ICAP-1α in the peripheral ruffles by co-staining the cells with a monoclonal anti-β1 integrin antibody (Fig. 4). When Hs68 fibroblasts adhered to the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin, F-actin-containing membrane ruffling was stimulated as the initial response upon Rac1 activation as described by others (1Clark E.A. King W.G. Brugge J.S. Symons M. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Indeed, additional co-staining in the early state of spreading (30 min of spreading) showed the peripheral co-localization of ICAP-1α with actin and Rac1, but not with tubulin or vimentin, allowing a better characterization of these areas (Fig. 4). Like other integrins, β1integrins can exist in different functional states with respect to ligand binding. These changes involve both affinity modulation, by which conformational changes in the integrin heterodimer govern affinity for individual extracellular matrix proteins, and avidity modulation, by which changes in lateral mobility and integrin clustering affect the binding of cells to multivalent matrices. Here we used the monoclonal antibody 12G10, which recognizes a ligand-induced binding site (30Mould A.P. Garratt A.N. Askari J.A. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), to investigate the functional state of β1 integrins co-localized with ICAP-1α and nm23-H2. During initial cell spreading, the 12G10 monoclonal antibody recognized engaged integrins at the cell edge after 30 min of spreading (early spreading) and in focal adhesions after 4 h of spreading (late spreading).

We investigated the effects of ethanol (EtOH) treatment on the cell survival-promoting phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Exposure of cells to 2–20 mm EtOH resulted in rapid (<10 min) induction of Akt phosphorylation that could be prevented by pertussis toxin or the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002. Among the downstream effectors of PI3K/Akt, p70S6 kinase, glycogen synthase kinase 3α/β, and IκB-α were phosphorylated, the latter resulting in 3-fold activation of NF-κB. EtOH also activated p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase in a PI3K-dependent manner. Low concentrations of EtOH increased endothelial nitric-oxide synthase activity, which could be blocked by transfection of HUVEC with dominant-negative Akt, implicating the PI3K/Akt pathway in this effect. The adenosine A1 receptor antagonist 1,3-dipopylcyclopentylxanthine prevented the phosphorylation of Akt observed in the presence of EtOH, adenosine, or the A1 agonist N6-cyclopentyladenosine. Incubation of HUVEC with 50–100 mm EtOH resulted in mitochondrial permeability transition and caspase-3 activation followed by apoptosis, as documented by DNA fragmentation and TUNEL assays. EtOH-induced apoptosis was unaffected by DPCPX and was potentiated by wortmannin or LY294002. We conclude that treatment with low concentrations of EtOH activates the cell survival promoting PI3K/Akt pathway in endothelial cells by an adenosine receptor-dependent mechanism and activation of the proapoptotic caspase pathway by higher concentrations of EtOH via an adenosine-independent mechanism can mask or counteract such effects.

Alcohol has been the most widely used and misused drug throughout human history. Aside from its well known neurobehavioral effects, alcohol also influences cardiovascular variables. The ingestion of one or two alcohol-containing drinks has acute effects on heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output, myocardial contractility, and regional blood flow (1Kunos G. Varga K. NIAAA Res. Monogr. 1996; 31: 243-261Google Scholar), actions that are generally not clinically important. During the last few decades, moderate alcohol consumption has been associated with a reduced risk for ischemic cardiovascular disease (2Tansescu M. Hu F.B. Willett W.C. Stampfer M.J. Rimm E.B. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2001; 38: 1836-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 3Van Tol A. Hendriks H.F. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), whereas chronic heavy drinking was found to increase cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (3Van Tol A. Hendriks H.F. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although the cardioprotective effect of moderate drinking is generally attributed to an elevation of high density lipoproteins and reduced platelet aggregation (4Constant J. Coron. Artery Dis. 1997; 8: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), alcohol has been shown to alter endothelial function (5Davda R.K. Chandler L.J. Crews F.T. Guzman N.J. Hypertension. 1993; 21: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); such changes may also contribute to its cardioprotective effects. Vascular endothelial cells, because of their location at the interface of blood and the vessel wall, are susceptible to the influence of various blood-borne agents. The endothelium is now recognized as an important regulator of vascular tone, and the controlled proliferation of vascular endothelial cells is a key step in angiogenesis. In the present study we examined the hypothesis that ethanol may influence both pro- and antiapoptotic pathways in the vascular endothelium in ways that could contribute to its dose-dependent effects on cardiovascular morbidity. The serine/threonine protein kinase Akt was originally discovered as the cellular homolog (c-Akt) of the transforming retrovirus AKT8 (6Staal S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5034-5037Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). It is a novel kinase with similarities to both protein kinase C and protein kinase A, so it is also referred to as protein kinase B (7Jones P.F. Jakubowicz T. Pitossi F.J. Maurer F. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4171-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar).

Salim K. Panayotou G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 165-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Akt is a multifunctional mediator of PI3K-dependent signaling and functions to promote cell survival as well as the transcription and translation of proteins involved in cell cycle progression (9Vanhaesebroeck B. Aless D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar).

Another major downstream effector is p70S6 kinase, which phosphorylates the ribosomal S6 protein in response to stimulation with mitogens and preferentially increases the translation of mRNAs containing 5′-terminal oligopolypyrimidine tracts (14Burgering B.M.T.

Immunol. 1999; 163: 1894-1905PubMed Google Scholar). Akt is well established as a mediator of cell survival, as its activation protects against apoptosis induced by withdrawal of growth factor or serum (27Madge L.A. Pober J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15458-15465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). NF-κB is a downstream mediator of Akt in anti-apoptotic signaling (28Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar). When bound to its cytosolic inhibitor, IκB, NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm. Upon its phosphorylation by IκB kinases, IκB is degraded, which allows NF-κB to move to the nucleus and activate the transcription of anti-apoptotic proteins (29Foo S.Y. Nolan G.P. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 229-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Here we report that in the presence of low concentrations (2–20 mm) of ethanol, the cell survival-promoting PI3K/Akt pathway and several of its downstream effectors, including eNOS, GSK-3, p70S6 kinase, and NF-κB, are activated via an adenosine-dependent mechanism, whereas at concentrations of 50–100 mm, ethanol promotes serum deprivation-induced endothelial cell apoptosis independently of adenosine by activating caspase-3 and its downstream target, PARP-1. These dose-dependent, opposing effects on endothelial cell survival pathways may contribute to the bimodal effects of ethanol consumption on cardiovascular morbidity. Ethanol, pertussis toxin (PTX), GF 109203X, wortmannin, and LY294002,N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA), 1,3-dipopylcyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX), and adenosine were purchased from Sigma. Rabbit anti-human antibodies to native and phosphorylated forms of Akt (Ser-473; catalog No. 9272 and 9271), IκB-α (catalog No. 9242 and 9246), GSK-3α/β (Ser-219; catalog No. 9331), p70S6 kinase (catalog No. 9205), p44/42 MAP kinase (catalog No. 9102 and 9101), and caspase-3 (catalog No. 9662) were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP; catalog no. SA-253) and caspase-3 cellular activity assay kits were purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Anti-rabbit IgG (horseradish peroxidase-linked) and enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL) detection system were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [35S]GTPγS was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and [α-32P]ddATP was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. TdT recombinant was purchased from Invitrogen. Primary cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were purchased from ATCC. The plastic culture flask was precoated with 0.2% gelatin for at least 1 h prior to seeding the cells. HUVEC were maintained in EBM-2 medium (Clonetics) supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum and growth factors such as hydrocortisone, hFGF-B, VEGF, R3-IGF-1, ascorbic acid, hEGF, GA-1000, and heparin plus 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. All experiments were performed using HUVEC at 2–4 passages, with no cells being used beyond the fourth passage. For serum starvation, the regular medium was removed and replaced with medium 199. Western immunoblotting was done as previously described (30Liu J. Gao B. Mirshahi F. Sanyal A.J. Khanolkar A.D. Makriyannis A. Kunos G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). HUVEC cells were cultured in serum-free medium overnight, prior to the addition of ethanol, to reduce the basal levels of Akt phosphorylation. Cell lysate protein (60 μg) from an equal number of cells was size-fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked by incubation for 2 h in TPBS buffer (1× PBS, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk at room temperature and then immunoblotted with primary antibody (at 1:1000 dilution in TPBS plus 3% bovine serum albumin) overnight at 4 °C and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000 in blocking buffer) for 2 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using an ECL detection system. Confluent HUVEC were rinsed twice in PBS and harvested by scraping. The cells were then homogenized in TME-Na buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), and the homogenate was centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in TME-Na, homogenized, and adjusted to a protein concentration of 1 μg/μl with TME-Na. The membrane homogenate was then used for measuring agonist-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding according to Griffin et al. (31Griffin G. Tao Q. Abood M.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 292: 886-894PubMed Google Scholar). HUVEC membranes (100 μg) were incubated in TME-Na buffer containing 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin with 30 μm GDP, 0.1 nm[35S]GTPγS, and different concentrations of ethanol in silanized glass tubes with or without 100 ng/ml PTX or 100 nm DPCPX. The total assay volume was 0.5 ml, and triplicate aliquots were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 ml of ice-cold wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) followed by vacuum filtration through glass fiber (type B) filters. Filters were rinsed three more times with wash buffer, and the retained radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Basal binding was assayed in the absence of ethanol and in the presence of GDP. Plasmids pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH) and dominant-negative Akt were co-transfected into HUVEC P2 cells. Using an initial seeding density of 1 × 104 cells/cm2, HUVEC were ready for transfection at 18–24 h post-seeding. For each 75-cm2flask of cells to be transfected, 30 μl of Lipofectin and 5 μg of each DNA were diluted separately in 500 μl of Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium. Solutions were combined, gently mixed, and incubated for 45 min at room temperature to allow formation of DNA-lipid complexes. The normal medium was replaced with 8 ml of Opti-MEM I reduced medium, and the DNA-lipid complexes were added subsequently to each flask and mixed gently by rocking the plate back and forth. Cells were incubated for 3 to 4 h at 37 °C in humidified air in 5% CO2. The transfection mixture was replaced with basal media containing supplements. Transfected cells were identified by cell sorting at 18–24 h post-transfection, and only the positive cells were used for the eNOS activity assay. eNOS activity was measured by monitoring the conversion of l-[3H]arginine tol-[3H]citrulline (eNOSdetect Assay Kit, Stratagene). Cells were trypsinized and washed with PBS and lysed in an adequate volume of homogenization buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA). The supernatant was separated from the homogenate, and protein concentration was adjusted to 5 μg/μl. The reaction mixture was prepared on ice by adding the following components: 25 μl of 2 reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 6 μm BH4, 2 μm flavin adenine dinucleotide, 2 μm flavin adenine mononucleotide), 5 μl of 10 mm NADPH (freshly prepared in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), 1 μl of [3H]arginine (50 μCi/ml), 5 μl of 6 mmCaCl2, and 4 μl of H2O. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of protein extract (total volume of 50 μl) and carried out for 30 min at 37 °C. Rat cerebellum extract and Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester HCl were used as positive or inhibitory control. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 400 μl of stop buffer containing 50 mmHEPES, pH 5.5, and 5 mm EDTA. The reaction mixture was then passed through a provided resin. The [3H]citrulline generated was quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The NF-κB luciferase promoter construct was purchased from Stratagene. Transient transfection was performed as described above. The transfection mixture was replaced with medium M199 overnight. Cells were stimulated for another 8 h with ethanol and then washed twice with PBS and lysed in 200 μl (for 12-well culture plate) of 1× passive lysis buffer. Cell lysates were centrifuged for 30 s at top speed in a refrigerated microcentrifuge, the cleared lysates were transferred to a fresh tube, and protein content was determined. Equal amounts of protein were used for reporter enzyme analyses using the Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) and a luminometer. ΔΨmand ROS generation were measured according to (32Guo T.L. Miller M.A. Datar S. Shapiro I.M. Shenker B.J. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1998; 152: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). HUVEC were treated with or without ethanol for 6 h under standard conditions and harvested by trypsinization. ΔΨm was measured directly by using 40 nm 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine (DiOC6 (3Van Tol A. Hendriks H.F. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Fluorescence was measured after staining the cells for 15 min at 37 °C. To assess ROS generation by flow cytometry, cells were treated with 2 μm hydroethidine (Molecular Probes) for 15 min at 37 °C. The probes were excited with a laser at 488 nm (250 milliwatts), and emission was measured through a 530/30 nm (DiOC6 (3Van Tol A. Hendriks H.F. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)) or a 575/26 nm (ethidium) bandpass filter. Logarithmic amplification was used to detect the fluorescence of the probes. Following treatment, DNA was isolated using a DNA Isolation Kit (Gentra, Minneapolis, MN). Briefly, 300 μl of cell lysates were incubated with 1.5 μl of RNase A solution at 37 °C for 5 min. 100 μl of protein precipitation solution was added to each sample, and after centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 1 min, the supernatant containing the DNA was precipitated by 300 μl of isopropanol and washed by 70% ethanol. DNA pellets were rehydrated using DNA hydration solution and incubated at 65 °C for 1 h. DNA was end-labeled with 0.5 μCi of [α-32P]ddATP using 25 units of terminal transferase enzyme at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was terminated by the addition of EDTA (pH 8.0) to a final concentration of 25 mm. Labeled DNA was separated from unincorporated radionucleotide by chroma-spin columns (CLONTECH) by agarose gel electrophoresis. The gel was transferred onto Whatman No. 3MM chromatography paper, dried, and analyzed by phosphorimaging (Typhoon, Molecular Dynamics). A TUNEL apoptosis detection kit (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) was used for DNA fragmentation fluorescence staining according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, following treatment the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1m NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, and incubated with a reaction mix containing biotin-dUTP and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase for 60 min. Fluorescein-conjugated avidin was applied to the sample, which was then incubated in the dark for 30 min. Positively stained fluorescein-labeled cells were visualized and photographed by fluorescence microscopy. Caspase-3 activity was measured using a colorimetric assay kit (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and their protein content determined (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of cell lysates were incubated with Ac-DEVD-p nitroanilide substrate at 37 °C, and the absorbance at 405 nm was measured in a microtiter plate reader. The kinetic curve was obtained by recording data at 10-min intervals for 4 h. Data are reported as means ± S.E. of at least three separate experiments, each performed in triplicate. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test. A blood alcohol level of 0.1%, the legal limit for driving in many states, is equivalent to ∼22 mm ethanol. The ethanol concentrations used in this study were 10 μm–100 mm, which spans the range of behaviorally sub-threshold to severe intoxicating levels. Ethanol treatment caused strong, concentration-dependent activation of Akt in HUVEC (Fig. 1A), activation being evident in the presence of as little as 10 μm ethanol. The time course is illustrated in Fig. 1B, with activation beginning at 5 min after the addition of ethanol and peaking at 30 min. Furthermore, the time- and concentration-dependent activation of Akt was evident both in the absence (upper panels) and in the presence of serum and growth factors (lower panels). Additionally, activation of Akt following ethanol treatment was completely antagonized by two structurally dissimilar inhibitors of PI3K, wortmannin and LY294002 (Fig. 1C); the ethanol metabolite acetaldehyde was inactive in this pathway (Fig. 1D). Since the p44/42 MAP kinase can be activated by PI3K (33Toker A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), we tested whether ethanol treatment can activate MAP kinase in HUVEC. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, treatment with 20 mm ethanol results in rapid phosphorylation of MAP kinase within 5 min, an effect that is abrogated in the presence of the PI3K inhibitors wortmannin or LY294002 (Fig. 2B). To explore the mechanism by which ethanol treatment induces PI3K/Akt activation, we examined the effect of ethanol on GTPγS binding in HUVEC membranes. As shown in Fig. 3A, in the presence of 2–100 mm ethanol GTPγS binding in HUVEC membranes was increased by up to 25%. This effect was largely inhibited by PTX, a Gi/o protein inhibitor, or by DPCPX, an A1 adenosine receptor inhibitor. This indicates the possible involvement of Gi/o protein(s) and A1 adenosine receptors in the activation of Akt phosphorylation by ethanol treatment. The mechanisms involved in Akt phosphorylation were further examined by Western blot analyses. As shown in Fig. 3B, Akt phosphorylation in response to ethanol treatment was largely inhibited by PTX but not by GF 109203X, a protein kinase C inhibitor. We next investigated ethanol activation of pathways downstream of Akt. As shown in Fig. 4A, p70S6 kinase, GSK-3α/β, and IκB-α can all be phosphorylated by treatment with 10 mm ethanol. Further experiments with transfected NF-κB promoter/luciferase constructs indicated NF-κB promoter activity was increased by up to 3-fold in the presence of 2–20 mmethanol, but with higher concentration of ethanol (50 mm) the activity declined (Fig. 4B). Similar results have been obtained for eNOS activity (Fig. 5). The increase in eNOS activity was dependent on ethanol concentration and on the duration of ethanol exposure. A time course study showed that eNOS activity peaked at 10 min following ethanol exposure (Fig. 5A). eNOS activity in HUVEC was increased by treatment with 20 mm ethanol, but activity declined toward basal levels with increasing ethanol concentrations (Fig. 5B). This ethanol-induced increase in eNOS activity could be blocked by transfection of HUVEC cells with dominant-negative Akt, implicating the PI3K/Akt pathway in eNOS activation by ethanol (Fig. 5C).Figure 5Ethanol treatment activates eNOS by an Akt-dependent mechanism. HUVEC were treated with 20 mm ethanol for various time points (A) or with various concentrations of ethanol for 10 min (B). eNOS activity was measured in cell extracts as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, plasmids pEGFP-N1 and dominant-negative Akt were cotransfected into HUVEC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Transfected cells were identified and sorted by flow cytometry and were then treated with buffer (Control) or 20 mm ethanol for 10 min before measuring eNOS activity.

As shown in Fig. 6, incubation of HUVEC with adenosine or the selective A1 adenosine receptor agonist CPA results in increased phosphorylation of Akt. Furthermore, pretreatment of HUVEC with the selective A1 receptor antagonist DPCPX almost completely prevented the increased Akt phosphorylation caused by ethanol, adenosine, or CPA, which implicates adenosine in this effect of ethanol. Fetal alcohol syndrome induced by maternal drinking has been linked to apoptotic cell death in the central nervous system. Therefore, we tested whether treatment with high concentrations of alcohol can also lead to apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells. Because there is increasing evidence that altered mitochondrial function is linked to apoptosis (40Higuchi H. Adachi M. Miura S. Gores G.J. Ishii H.

The receptor complex for HIV entry consists of the CD4 molecule and at least one of the members of the chemokine receptor family; CCR5 is the major coreceptor for macrophage-tropic HIV-1 isolates (R5), whereas that for T-lymphocyte-tropic isolates is CXCR4 (1Nisole S.

Although both CD4 and CXCR4/CCR5 are essential for the HIV entry process, the initial association of HIV particles to cells (referred to as attachment) could occur in the absence or blockade of these receptors (2Ugolini S.

Accordingly, HIV attachment occurs efficiently in CD4− human cells and even in heterologous cells albeit in the absence of membrane fusion and viral entry (4Nisole S. Krust B. Callebaut C.

Consequently, targeting any one of these components could result in the inhibition of HIV attachment. Indeed, HIV attachment could be blocked either by the fibroblast growth factor 2 that binds heparan sulfate proteoglycans or by the anti-HIV pseudopeptide HB-19 that binds nucleolin (3Callebaut C.

Recombinant preparations of HIV-1 gp120 bind partially purified preparations of nucleolin with a high affinity, comparable with that observed for the binding of gp120 to soluble CD4. Such binding is inhibited either by HB-19 or monoclonal antibodies against the V3 loop in gp120, thus suggesting that the interaction of HIV with nucleolin might occur through interactions implicating the V3 loop (3Callebaut C.

By studies using electron and confocal laser immunofluorescence microscopy, we have confirmed that nucleolin is expressed at the cell surface where it exists in close association with the intracellular actin cytoskeleton. Cell-surface expression of nucleolin is highly increased a few hours following stimulation of cell proliferation due to induction of nucleolin mRNA and protein synthesis. Interestingly, incubation of cells with a monoclonal antibody specific to nucleolin leads to the clustering of nucleolin at the external side of the plasma membrane as revealed by electron microscopy (20Hovanessian A.G.

The mechanism by which nucleolin is expressed on the cell surface still remains to be elucidated. It should be noted, however, that nucleolin is tightly associated with the cell surface, but it is readily solubilized by the non-ionic detergent Triton X-100 (20Hovanessian A.G. Puvion-Dutilleul F.

Three main structural domains have been determined in nucleolin as follows: 1) the N-terminal domain containing several long stretches of acidic residues; 2) the central globular domain containing four RNA binding domains (RBDs); and 3) the extreme C-terminal domain containing nine repeats of the tripeptide motif arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG domain) (14Ginisty H.

Irreversible association of HIV particles in the plasma membrane of target cells, referred here as anchorage, requires at least the implication of heparan sulfate proteoglycans, surface-expressed nucleolin, the CD4 receptor, and one of the members of the chemokine receptor family. Interestingly, despite the attachment of HIV to cells of different species not expressing CD4, anchorage of virus particles does not occur in CD4− cells. Anchorage of virus particles on CD4+ cells can be prevented in the presence of neutralizing anti-V3 loop or anti-CD4 antibodies or treatment of cells with HB-19. Here we have used a new generation of the HB-19 pseudopeptide 5(Kψ(CH2N)PR)-TASP (10Callebaut C. Jacotot E. Guichard G. Krust B. Rey-Cuille M.A. Cointe D. Benkirane N. Blanco J. Muller S. Briand J.P. Hovanessian A.G.

HB-19A has anti-HIV properties identical to HB-19. Consistent with our previous results obtained with HB-19 (4Nisole S. Krust B. Callebaut C. Guichard G. Muller S. Briand J.P. Hovanessian A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27875-27884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we show that HB-19A binds the cell-surface-expressed nucleolin independent of the expression of cell-surface heparan and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. Furthermore, cross-linking of surface-bound HB-19A results in capping of surface nucleolin and its colocalization with the pseudopeptide. By using deletion constructs of nucleolin, the C-terminal tail of nucleolin containing the nine repeats of the RGG motif was identified as the HB-19A-binding site. Moreover, this domain in nucleolin inhibited HIV-1 infection in a dose-dependent manner by preventing attachment of virus particles to cells. Our results confirm that nucleolin is the target of the anti-HIV pseudopeptide HB-19A and point out that the RGG domain provides a model for the development of novel inhibitors of HIV infection.

Mazie. mAb 110-4 against HIV-1 LAI V3 loop was the generous gift of the Genetic Systems. mAb HB10 AB2A against CD45 was provided by Dr. R. Siraganian. HIV-1 neutralizing serum 1 and serum 2 and control human IgG were obtained from Dr. L. Vujcic through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, AIDS Program, NIAID, National Institutes of Health. Rabbit anti-biotin concentrate (IgG fraction) was obtained from Enzo Dioagnostics, Inc., New York. FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was purchased from Sigma. FITC-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment rabbit anti-human Ig and Texas Red dye-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Texas Red dye-conjugated goat anti-human IgG was from Vector Laboratories. Goat anti-rabbit antibodies coupled to gold beads of 10 nm in diameter and goat anti-human antibodies coupled to gold beads of 15 nm in diameter were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. In these experiments a new generation of the HB-19 pseudopeptide 5(Kψ(CH2N)PR)-TASP (10Callebaut C. Jacotot E. Guichard G. Krust B. Rey-Cuille M.A. Cointe D. Benkirane N. Blanco J. Muller S.

The five Kψ(CH2N)PR moieties were then assembled on the α-amino groups of the four lysine residues and on the ε-amino group of the N-terminal lysine residue. This anti-HIV pseudopeptide with the modified TASP template is referred here as HB-19A. The synthesis of HB-19A was performed according to the protocol described previously (1Nisole S. Krust B.

The reduced amide bond between Lys and Pro was formed on the resin by reductive amination of the nitrogen-protected aminoaldehyde t-butoxycarbonyl-Lys(t-butoxycarbonyl)-CHO (2.5-fold excess, twice) in dimethylformamide containing 1% acetic acid along 1 h (10Callebaut C.

For the synthesis of the biotinylated HB-19A, the biotin moiety was coupled after the C-terminal Ala using a N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-Lys(biotin)-OH derivative. A 6-aminohexanoic acid was introduced as a spacer between Lys(biotin) residue and the polylysine template (1Nisole S. Krust B. Dam E. Bianco A. Seddiki N. Loaec S. Callebaut C. Guichard G. Muller S.

The TW70 peptide has the amino acid sequence RRWCYRKDKPYRKCR; the DK has been introduced in the sequence of this peptide to stabilize the β-turn in the final structure.

HB-19A was iodinated (5 × 103 μCi/μmol) using the Bolton-Hunter reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by a procedure as recommended by the manufacturer. CEM (clone 13) and MT-4 T-lymphocyte human cell lines were propagated in RPMI 1640 (BioWhittaker, Verviers, Belgium). Human HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). Human HeLa-CD4-LTR-lacZ expressing or not expressing CCR5 were referred to as HeLa P4-C5 and HeLa P4, respectively. These HeLa cells (provided by Drs. P. Charneau and O.

The HIV-1 LAI isolate was propagated and purified as described previously (1Nisole S. Krust B. Dam E. Bianco A. Seddiki N. Loaec S. Callebaut C. Guichard G. Muller S. Briand J.P. Hovanessian A.G.

The m.o.i. of the HIV-1 for different infections was 1. For the assay of HIV-1 LAI attachment, anchorage and colocalization studies purified virus was used at an m.o.i. of 3. HIV-1 LAI infection was monitored indirectly in HeLa-CD4-LTR-lacZ cells (HeLa P4 cells) containing the bacterial lacZ gene under the control of HIV-1 LTR. HIV-1 entry and replication result in the activation of the HIV-1 LTR leading to the expression of β-galactosidase. At 48 h post-infection, cells were lysed and assayed for β-galactosidase activity using the chlorophenol red β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm (1Nisole S.

Cells were then washed extensively with culture medium containing 10% FCS to eliminate unbound HIV particles, and the amount of p24 associated with cells was measured in nucleus-free cell extracts as an estimate for the amount of HIV attached to cells by p24 Core Profile enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (5Valenzuela A.

To demonstrate that most of the p24 associated with cells represented HIV particles bound on the surface of cells, samples of cells incubated with virus were washed with PBS (containing 1 mm EDTA) before treatment with trypsin to eliminate virus bound on the cell surface as described before (1Nisole S.

Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). To regulate Hsp70 ATPase activity Hsp40 proteins utilize a conserved region, which was identified in Escherichia coli DnaJ and is termed the J-domain (12Georgopoulos C.P. Lundquist-Heil A. Yochem J. Feiss M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1980; 178: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Zylicz M. Yamamoto T. McKittrick N. Sell S. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7591-7598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The J-domain, found in all Hsp40s, is around 70 amino acids in length and contains a conserved HPD tripeptide that is the signature motif of this protein family (14Cyr D.M. Gething M.-J. Guidebook to Molecular Chaperones and Protein Folding Factors. Sambrook & Tooze at Oxford University Press, Oxford1997: 89-95Google Scholar). The NMR structure of the J-domain shows it to contain four α-helical regions with the HPD motif being located in a loop that connects Helix II and Helix III (15Szyperski T. Pellecchia M. Wall D.

How the J-domain regulates Hsp70 ATPase activity is not entirely clear, but a surface formed by helix II and the HPD motif is proposed to bind a cleft at the base of the Hsp70 ATPase domain and thereby stimulates ATP hydrolysis (18Greene M.K.

Energy derived from ATP hydrolysis then drives a conformational change in Hsp70 that is proposed to involve the closure of a lid structure that covers the peptide-binding groove and stabilizes Hsp70-peptide complexes (6Bukau B.

How Hsp40s function as molecular chaperones to bind and deliver non-native proteins to Hsp70 is not well established (23Rudiger S. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1042-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The study of the mechanism for Hsp40 chaperone function is complicated by the fact that Type I, II, and III Hsp40s are not functionally equivalent (24Caplan A.J. Douglas M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 609-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 25Luke M.M. Sutton A. Arndt K.T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 623-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 26Terada K.

Biol., 10, 1349, 1349, 1358.Google Scholar). Biochemical studies with purified Type I Hsp40s such asE. coli DnaJ, human Hdj-2, and yeast Ydj-1 demonstrate that these proteins function as chaperones independent of Hsp70 to suppress protein aggregation (11Langer T., Lu, C. Echols H. Flanagan J. Hayer M.K. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1992; 356: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 29Cyr D.M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Type II Hsp40s such as human Hdj-1 and yeast Sis1 appear to be less efficient as chaperones and need to act with Hsp70 to suppress protein aggregation (27Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27824-27830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 30Minami Y. Hohfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19617-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Type III Hsp40s do not appear capable of suppressing protein aggregation or facilitating protein folding and, therefore, may not function as molecular chaperones (2Cheetham M.E. Caplan A.J. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Differences in the structures of Type I, II, and III Hsp40s appear to account for the differences in chaperone activity exhibited by these co-chaperone proteins. Type I Hsp40s are modeled after DnaJ and contain a J-domain, a Gly and Phe (G/F)-rich region, a zinc finger-like domain, and a conserved carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD).1 Biochemical and genetic studies suggest that Type I Hsp40s utilize the zinc finger-like region and portions of CTD to bind non-native proteins (31Szabo A. Korszun R. Hartl F.U. Flanagan J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 408-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 32Banecki B. Liberek K. Wall D. Wawrzynow A. Georgopoulos C. Bertoli E. Tanfani F. Zylicz M. J.

Type II Hsp40s contain the J-domain, G/F-rich region, and the CTD but lack the zinc finger-like region, which is replaced in part by a Gly and Met (G/M)-rich region (2Cheetham M.E. Caplan A.J. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Biochemical and genetic studies suggest that the G/F region and portions of the conserved carboxyl terminus enable Type II Hsp40s to function as chaperones (4Sondheimer N. Lopez N. Craig E.A. Lindquist S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2435-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 27Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol.

Type III Hsp40s contain the J-domain and other specialized structures that enable them to bind specific proteins, nucleic acids, and insert into intracellular membranes (2Cheetham M.E. Caplan A.J. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Thus, Hsp40s have evolved to contain different types of polypeptide-binding domains, and this structural divergence enables them to direct Hsp70 to bind a broad range of substrates. To investigate the mechanism for the chaperone function of Type II Hsp40s, we utilized the yeast Sis1 protein as a model protein (25Luke M.M. Sutton A. Arndt K.T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 623-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Sis1 is an essential 352-amino acid residue protein that functions in the cytosol with members of the Hsp70 Ssa family (27Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27824-27830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 35Horton L.E. James P. Craig E.A. Hensold J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14426-14433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies show that the polypeptide binding activity of Sis1 is retained by a fragment of the protein that contains residues 171–352 (Sis1-(171–352)) (27Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27824-27830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Consistent with these data, genetic studies have demonstrated that the CTD of Sis1 carries out functions that are essential to support cell viability (36Johnson J.L. Craig E.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 851-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which Sis1 binds and delivers non-native polypeptides to Hsp70 is not clear. Insight into the nature of the Sis1 peptide-binding site was provided by the crystal structure of Sis1-(171–352), which reveals that CTD of Sis1 forms a crystallographic homodimer that has a wishbone-like structure (37Sha B.D. Lee S. Cyr D.M. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 799-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Sis1-(171–352) monomers have an elongated shape and contain two barrel-like domains, CTDI and CTDII, and a C-terminal dimerization motif that correspond to residues 180–255, 260–329, and 330–352, respectively (37Sha B.D. Lee S. Cyr D.M. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 799-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Deletion of the dimerization domain of Sis1 reduces its ability to help Hsp70 refold luciferase (37Sha B.D. Lee S. Cyr D.M. Struct. Fold.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 851-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, Sis1 can carry out its essential functions as a monomer, and contrary to a previous suggestion (23Rudiger S. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1042-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), the dimerization domain is not likely to play a direct role in polypeptide binding. To bind non-native polypeptides, chaperone proteins typically utilize regions enriched in solvent-exposed hydrophobic amino acid side chains (38Saibil H.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Analysis of the Sis1-(171–352) structure revealed the existence of a hydrophobic patch of amino acids located on the surface of domain I, which was predicted to participate in Sis1 chaperone function (37Sha B.D. Lee S. Cyr D.M. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 799-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To test this model, we carried out a mutational analysis of residues present in the hydrophobic patch in CTDI of Sis1. The results reported herein demonstrate that highly conserved residues within CTDI are essential for cell viability and are required for Sis1 to bind non-native polypeptides. To produce a vector to drive the overexpression of Sis1 in E. coli, the coding sequence of Sis1 was amplified from yeast genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the 5′-primer, SIS-N (5′-ACAGAACTAACCATGGTCAAGGAGACAAACT T-3′), and the 3′-prime primer, SIS-C (5′-TGCTTAGGATCCCTATTAAAAATTTTCATCTAT AGC-3′). This PCR product was then cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites present in the polylinker of the E. coli expression vector pET9a (39Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar) to generate pET9aSis1. To express Sis1 from a plasmid in yeast under the control of its own promoter the primers SIS-UN (5′-ATGACCATCGATCATCCATCTGTTGTCCTGTGAAAAGA-3′) and SIS-C were utilized to generate a PCR fragment that contained bases that were –772 to 1056 from the Sis1 start codon (25Luke M.M. Sutton A. Arndt K.T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 623-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This PCR fragment contains both the Sis1 promoter and open reading frame and was subcloned into the SpeI and BamHI sites present in the polylinkers of the centromeric yeast expression plasmids pRS314 and pRS315 (40Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate pRS314Sis1 and pRS315Sis1. To construct the Sis1 point mutants characterized in this study (see Fig. 2), a 4-primer PCR-based mutagenic protocol was utilized (41Caplan A.J. Cyr D.M. Douglas M.G. Cell. 1992; 71: 1143-1155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Briefly, the primers, SIS1-N and SIS1-C were employed in combination with a set of internally overlapping mutagenic primers to generate PCR products that contained a single point mutation in Sis1. The mutated Sis1 PCR products were then digested withStuI and BamHI to generate a DNA fragment that contained bases 148–1056 of Sis1. pET9aSIS1, pRS314Sis1, and pRS315SIS1 were then digested with StuI and BamHI, and the mutated and digested Sis1 PCR fragments were utilized to replace the region of the wild-typeSis1 open reading frame present in these plasmids that corresponded to bases 148 to 1056. Yeast Hsp70 Ssa1 was purified from yeast strain MW141 (42Werner-Washburne M. Stone D.E. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2568-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) grown in YP medium containing 2% galactose to an A600 of 3. Hsp70 Ssa1 was then purified using ATP-agarose, ion exchange, and hydroxyapatite chromatography as described previously (9Cyr D.M., Lu, X. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20927-20931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant Sis1 were overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLys by induction with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside followed by growth for 3 h at 30 °C. Purification of Sis1 was then carried out by ion exchange and hydroxyapatite chromatography as described previously (27Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27824-27830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were stored on ice or at –80 °C prior to use. The ability of Sis1 to cooperate with Hsp70 Ssa1 to facilitate the refolding of chemically denatured luciferase was monitored as described previously (27Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27824-27830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The ability of Sis1 to stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsp70 Ssa1 was monitored by thin layer chromatography with polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates as previously described (9Cyr D.M., Lu, X. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20927-20931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified Sis1 (0.3 mg/ml) was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. in 30 ml of buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, and 5 mm DTT) that was supplemented with proteinase K (0.01–1.0 mg/ml). Digestions were terminated by the addition of 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and samples were immediately added to SDS-PAGE sample buffer and run out on 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Previous studies have demonstrated that the proteolytic products liberated from Sis1 to be a 21-kDa band that corresponds to residues 171–352 and a pair of 7–9-kDa bands that represent fragments containing the J-domain (27Lu Z. Cyr D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27824-27830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To compare the peptide binding activity of Sis1 and the Sis1 mutants, a binding assay representing a modified version of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method for detecting complex formation between DnaJ and its substrates was established (43Wawrzynow A. Banecki B. Wall D. Liberek K. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19307-19311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The assay is based on the ability of purified Sis1 to bind non-native proteins immobilized on the surface microtiter plate wells with the retained protein being detected via ELISA. To immobilize firefly luciferase in the wells of microtiter plates, it was first chemically denatured by incubation at 5 mg/ml in 3 m guanidine HCl, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, and 5 mm DTT for 1 h at room temperature. Then, 0.2 mg of denatured luciferase-made 0.1m NaHCO3 (pH 8.6) was added to wells and incubated for 30 min at 25 °C. Dot blot analysis demonstrated that under these conditions more than 90% of the added luciferase was retained in the wells. When the immobilization reaction was complete, wells were washed twice with PBS (50 mm phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) and then blocked with 150 μl of 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. Wells were then washed three times with PBST (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20). Sis1 or Sis1 mutants were then added to the wells in PBST supplemented with 0.2% BSA (PBST/BSA). After a 1-h incubation at 25 °C, the wells were washed five times with PBST. α-Sis1 rabbit polyclonal sera in 50 ml of PBST/BSA was added to the wells at a 1:5000 dilution and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. Wells were washed five times, and then goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution in 50 ml PBST/BSA) was added, and incubations were carried out for 45 min. After five washes, peroxidase substrate solution was added to each well, and color formation was determined using microplate reader (Bio-Rad) set at 415 nm. Peroxidase substrate solution was prepared immediately prior to use by mixing 36 μl of 30% H2O2 and 21 ml of filtered ABTS stock solution (22 mg of ABTS/100 ml of 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.0). Results from control experiments demonstrated that Sis1 could be detected via ELISA over a 0.1 to 100 ng range of concentrations. In addition, we demonstrated via Western blot that all of the Sis1 mutants exhibited the same immunoreactivity to α-Sis1 as to Sis1. In experiments where reduced α-lactalbumin (LA) was utilized as the immobilized substrate of Sis1 the following protocol was employed to generate this substrate. Bovine α-LA (type III, Ca2+-depleted; Sigma) at 5 mg/ml was incubated in 10 mm DTT, 0.1 m Tris (pH 8.7), 0.2 mKCl, and 1 mm EDTA for 15 min at °C. Then 0.4 μg of reduced LA (R-LA) was added to the wells of microtiter plates in 0.1m NaHCO3 (pH 8.6) supplemented with 5 mm DTT in a volume of 50 μl. Complex formation between immobilized R-LA and Sis1 was then monitored as described above, except R-LA was maintained in its reduced stated by the addition of 2 mm DTT to all reaction mixtures. The in vivo function of theSis1 CTDI mutants was analyzed by determining whether they could support the growth of a sis1Δ strain (MATaade2-1 his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 ura3-1 trp1-1 ssd1-D2 can1-100 sis1::His3; (25Luke M.M. Sutton A. Arndt K.T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 623-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) or asis1Δ::ydj1Δ strain (JJ1146;MATatrp1-1 ura3-1 leu2-3,112 his3-11,15 ade2-1 can1-100 met2-D1 lys2-D2 ydj1::His3 sis1::Leu2(36Johnson J.L. Craig E.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 851-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The viability of these respective strains was supported bySis1 supplied on the low copy Ura3 plasmid pRS316 (40Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To swap wild-type Sis1 for its mutant forms the plasmid shuffle technique was utilized (44Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). The sis1Δstrain was transformed with wild-type or mutant Sis1 that was supplied on a low copy Leu2 plasmid pRS315 (40Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thesis1Δ::ydj1Δ strain was transformed with wild-type or mutant SIS1 that was supplied on a low copy Trp1 plasmid pR314 (40Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To counter select for theSis1 present on the Ura plasmid transformants were grown on media that contained 5-fluoroorotic acid (44Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Strains were grown at 25 °C for 7 days, and the plates were then photographed. The steady state expression levels of Sis1 mutants were analyzed by Western blot of yeast extracts with a rabbit polyclonal Sis1 antibody. Freshly selected strains were grown in selective media to anA600 of 2. Yeast cells were fixed with 5% trichloroacetic acid for 5 min, and then cell pellets were twice washed with 80% acetone and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Lysate proteins (5 mg) were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. To examine the influence of wild-type Sis1 expression on the steady state level of the respective Sis1 mutants, asis1Δ strain that harbored Sis1-His6 on low copy pRS316 was generated. This strain was then transformed with wild-type and mutant forms of Sis1 on low copy pRS315 and transformants were selected on synthetic medium that was devoid of leucine and uracil. When extracts of these strains were prepared and run on 15% gels the Sis1-His6 protein migrated with a slower mobility than Sis1. This allowed for the visualization of the expression levels of non-tagged Sis1 mutants and Sis1-His6in Western blots of cell extracts. To identify regions in Sis1-(171–352) that might function in peptide-binding, GRASP analysis was utilized to probe the structure of this fragment for solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues (Fig.1, A and B) and contours (Fig. 1C). This analysis identified an unoccupied solvent-exposed patch of hydrophobic amino acid residues located on CTDI of Sis1 monomers. This patch represented the largest solvent-exposed hydrophobic region on the surface of Sis1 and is formed by residues that are contributed by β-strands 1, 2, and 5 (Fig. 1, C and D). A distinguishing feature of this patch is that it contains a 5-Å deep depression in which the solvent-exposed surface is lined by highly conserved residues that are both aliphatic and aromatic in nature (Fig. 1C). Sequence alignment of CTDI from Sis1 with similar regions from other Type II Hsp40 proteins demonstrates that residues Leu-186, Lys-199, Ile-203, and Phe-251 are 100% conserved (Fig. 1D). Whereas Val-184 and Phe-201 are found in only 20% of the Type II Hsp40s analyzed. However, in 80% of the cases a methionine residue has conservatively replaced Phe-201. Thus, CTDI of Sis1 contains a patch of solvent-exposed residues in which lies a depression that is primarily lined by conserved hydrophobic amino acids having the potential to be involved in substrate binding. To determine whether the surface-exposed residues that form the hydrophobic patch on CTDI are involved in Sis1 chaperone function, a series of point mutants was constructed (Fig.2). Then we examined the ability of purified forms of these Sis1 mutants to cooperate with Hsp70 Ssa1 in the refolding of chemically denatured luciferase (Fig. 2, Aand B). When paired with Hsp70 Ssa1, Sis1 K199A, F201H, I203T, and F251S exhibited 70–90% less folding activity than Sis1. In contrast, the protein folding activity of Sis1 V184T and L86Q was similar to that of Sis1. These data demonstrate that Lys-199, Phe-201, Ile-203, and Phe-251 are important for Sis1 to function as a co-chaperone of Hsp70 Ssa1. However, Val-184 and Leu-186 do not appear to be critical for Sis1 to function in the refolding of luciferase. For Hsp40 proteins to facilitate luciferase folding they must be able to interact with Hsp70 to stimulate its ATPase activity. To assure that the Sis1 CTDI mutants that exhibited defects in chaperone function retained the ability to interact with Hsp70, their ability to stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsp70 Ssa1 was examined (Fig. 3A). All of the Sis1 mutants tested were observed to stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsp70 Ssa1 to the same degree as Sis1. Thus, defects in regulation of Hsp70 ATPase activity do not appear to be responsible for the observed reductions in the protein folding activity of the Sis1 CTDI mutants. To rule out the possibility that mutation of CTDI caused Sis1 to misfold, thereby hindering its ability to function as a chaperone, we evaluated the folded state of the different Sis1 CTDI mutants. This was accomplished by analyzing the pattern of proteolytic fragments that were liberated by limited digestion of the respective Sis1 mutants by proteinase K. Proteinase K digestion of Sis1 generates proteolytic fragments that correspond to the J-domain and Sis1-(171–352) (Fig. 3B). When the protease resistance of purified Sis1 K199A, F201H, and I203T mutants were compared with that of Sis1, we observed no difference in the pattern of fragments formed. In contrast, Sis1 F251S was more sensitive to digestion than the other mutants. The crystal structure of Sis1-(171–352) shows that Phe-251 is located on B5 and forms the base of the depression identified in Sis1 CTDI. Phe-251 is positioned between B1 and B3 and is predicted to promote interactions between these β-strands that stabilize the Sis1 structure (37Sha B.D. Lee S. Cyr D.M. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 799-807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Therefore, the observation that Sis1 F251S exhibits increased sensitivity to proteinase K was not surprising. However, this result does hinder our ability to make interpretations as to whether Phe-251 is directly involved in Sis1 chaperone function or simply plays a structural role. Nonetheless, defects in the chaperone function observed for Sis1 K199A, F201H, and I203T do not appear to be a result of their defective folding. To test whether the Sis1 CTDI mutants exhibited defects in polypeptide binding, we utilized a"

All expressed VSGs are telomeric, and differential activation involves recombination into the telomeric environment or silencing/activation of subtelomeric promoters. A number of pathogen contingency gene systems associated with immune evasion involve telomeric loci, which has prompted speculation that chromosome ends provide conditions conducive for the operation of rapid gene switching mechanisms. Ku is a protein associated with eukaryotic telomeres that is directly involved in DNA recombination and in gene silencing. We have tested the hypothesis that Ku in trypanosomes is centrally involved in differential VSG expression. We show, via the generation of null mutants, that trypanosome Ku is closely involved in telomere length maintenance, more so for a transcriptionally active than an inactive telomere, but exhibits no detectable influence on DNA double strand break repair. The absence of Ku and the consequent great shortening of telomeres had no detectable influence either on the rate of VSG switching or on the silencing of the telomeric promoters of theVSG subset that is expressed in the tsetse fly.

Recently, homologues possibly associated with DNA repair have been discovered also in prokaryotes (6Aravind L. Koonin E.V.

Ku is central to the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)1 pathway for DNA double strand break repair in which double strand breaks with dissimilar ends can be rejoined with minimal error (8Milne G.T. Jin S.F. Shannon K.B. Weaver D.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4189-4198Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). A main function of Ku is to bind to DNA and recruit proteins, such as the catalytic subunit of mammalian DNA-dependent protein kinase, that catalyze steps in the repair process, although a weak helicase activity has been ascribed by some to Ku itself (1Featherstone C. Jackson S.P. Mutat. Res. 1999; 434: 3-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Ku also plays a major role in telomere length maintenance in yeasts such that the deletion of Ku genes causes shortening of the telomere tract (9Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P.

Cooper J.P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 55-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and indeed the presence of Ku is required for the prevention of recombination at the free ends of telomeres (15Difilippantonio M.J.

In the phenomenon known as telomere position effect (TPE), telomere-proximal genes in yeast become transcriptionally silent in a reversible manner (17Gottschling D.E. Aparicio O.M. Billington B.L. Zakian V.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 751-762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). The deletion of KU genes inSaccharomyces cerevisiae prevents the silencing (18Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P.

Although TPE has been demonstrated where reporter genes have been inserted experimentally into telomeres (17Gottschling D.E. Aparicio O.M. Billington B.L. Zakian V.A.

Science. 2001; 292: 2075-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), there is only one example of it occurring naturally. A screen of telomere-proximal genes on a number of S. cerevisiaechromosomes revealed that, although generally they are not subject to TPE, one does appear to be silenced in that way (20Vega-Palas M.A. Venditti S. DiMauro E. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 232-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Pathogenic microorganisms commonly use contingency gene systems that, by undergoing random and rapid mutational events, create phenotypic diversity during infection and can enable evasion of host immune systems (21Moxon E.R. Rainey P.B. Nowak M.A. Lenski R.E. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 24-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 22Deitsch K.W. Moxon E.R. Wellems T.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Contingency genes often are members of large gene families of which only one is expressed at a time, and the mutational events can include a random switch between expression of individual members of the family. It is common for contingency genes, including the one that is expressed, to be located at telomeres (24Rudenko G. Cross M. Borst P. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 113-117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 25Scherf A. Figueiredo L.M. Freitas-Junior L.H. Curr. Opin.

Just why telomeres are so popular for such genes is unknown, but it has been speculated that the high rates of recombination between telomeres contribute to diversification within the family. It has also been proposed that telomeric location is more directly involved in phenotype switching by using effects such as TPE to enable transcriptional switching between members of the family (25Scherf A.

When antibodies kill trypanosomes expressing a specific VSG, a minority of cells that have switched to expression of a distinct VSG survive and multiply. Each trypanosome has a family of probably hundreds of VSG genes, most of which are located in tandem arrays within chromosomes, but a sizeable minority of which are located at the many telomeres in this genome. To obtain exclusive expression ofVSGs, trypanosomes transcribe them singly and only at telomeric sites known as bloodstream expression sites (BESs). Although there can be occasional transcriptional switches between BESs, the main route to VSG switching is the replacement of the VSG in the BES with a copy of a silent VSG (33Robinson N.P. Burman N. Melville S.E. Barry J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5839-5846Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), probably by homologous recombination (34McCulloch R. Barry J.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2875-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, it is not known yet whether special, telomere-associated mechanisms enhance recombination into BESs, and a role for telomere-associated recombination-promoting proteins is a possibility. Ku, interacting with proteins other than those preventing recombination at the free end of the telomere, is a candidate. It is also possible to invoke Ku, in its role as mediator of TPE, as a candidate for regulating differential expression and repression of the distinct set of VSGs employed when the VSG coat first appears in the metacyclic trypanosome stage in the salivary glands of the tsetse (Glossina) vector (reviewed in Refs. 29Barry J.D. Graham S.V. Fotheringham M. Graham V.S. Kobryn K. Wymer B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar and 35Donelson J.E. Hill K.L. Elsayed N.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 51-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In that stage, a subset of telomeric genes known as MVSGs becomes differentially activated at the transcriptional level, generating a population diverse for VSGs. As these are the only trypanosome protein-coding genes known to have their own promoters, and to be subject to absolute control by transcription initiation, it has been speculated that they have achieved such control through the operation of a TPE on the MVSG promoters, which are only ∼5 kb from the telomere tract (29Barry J.D. Graham S.V. Fotheringham M. Graham V.S. Kobryn K. Wymer B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Here, we examine the functions of Ku in trypanosomes and test the hypothesis that it is important for VSG switching in the bloodstream stage and that it is also important for the silencing of MVSG genes prior to the metacyclic stage. Bloodstream form cells (T. brucei 221a trypanosomes (MITat 1.2a) of strain S427 (36Cross G.A.M. Parasitology. 1975; 71: 393-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar)) were grown in vitro at 37 °C in HMI-9 medium (37Hirumi H. Hirumi K. J. Parasitol. 1989; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). For study of MVSGs, we used the procyclic stage ofT. brucei EATRO 795 (38Graham S.V. Matthews K.R. Shiels P.G. Barry J.D. Parasitology. 1990; 101: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) maintained in vitro at 27 °C in SDM-79 medium (39Brun R. Schonenberger M. Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar). For trypanosome transformations, 5 × 107 cells were electroporated with ∼5 μg of restriction-digested, phenol/chloroform-extracted, and ethanol-precipitated plasmid DNA. Electroporation was performed as described previously (34McCulloch R. Barry J.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2875-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Cells were allowed to recover for 18 h before drug selection. Bloodstream form transformants were selected on semisolid agarose plates. Procyclic transformants (105cells) were selected in 10 ml of liquid medium supplemented with ∼106 untransformed cells. Transformant populations were subsequently cloned using conditioned SDM-79 medium in 96-well plates. Using detailed searching of the Sanger and TIGR trypanosome genome databases, we obtained entries recognized as putative KU70 and KU80 homologue short fragments (see “Results”). From these, we designed the following oligonucleotides:KU705′ CCGAATTCGGGGAGGGTACGTCAGCGGG;KU703′ CCAAGCTTCAAGCTCTCGATTTGGATAGC;KU805′ GAATTCTTCCTCTGCGTGCCGTTGAC; KU803′GAATTCGCACCTCTTCACCTACCGTC (EcoRI underlined, HindIII in bold). PCR was carried out with ∼3 pmol of each primer with an initial 10-min denaturation at 95 °C followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 65 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. Products of 248 bp (KU70) and 214 bp (KU80) were cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene). The sequence was determined on both strands using ABI-PRISM automated sequencing with custom-designed primers. An insert sequence was subsequently used to probe a T. brucei ILTat 1.2 genomic library (Sau3A partial digests in λ-GEM-12; gift of Nils Burman). This initially allowed the isolation of two DNA fragments for each gene believed to contain putative KU70 and KU80 sequence. Once again, these clones were sequenced on both strands by ABI-PRISM automated sequencing, yielding the open reading frames (ORFs) described under “Results.” Two constructs were used to delete each gene, using two rounds of transformation. Each construct contained ∼400 bp of targeting sequence derived from sequences immediately upstream and downstream of either ORF, meaning that transformants delete the entire ORF. Targeting flanks for each gene were amplified by PCR using genomic DNA and Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene).KU70 5′ flank primers: 5′-CCTCTAGAGAGGCGCTTCTCAATCTAAT-3′; 5′-CCTCTAGATATCACGCGGTACCCAGGTT-3′. KU70 3′ flank primers: 5′-CCTTGGGCCCAACCATTGCGAGTGCGCGTT-3′; 5′-CCTTGGGCCCAGAACTCGAGCCTTGCAGTGGGATTCTCTA-3′.KU80 5′ flank primers: 5′-CCTCTAGACAGCCAGCAGCGCTTCAATA-3′; 5′-CCTCTAGAACGGAAAGCCATATTGGAG-3′. KU80 3′ flank primers: 5′-CCTTGGGCCCGAGAAACAAAGTCACATATAAATA-3′; 5′-CCTTGGGCCCAGAACTCGAGTGAGATGTGGCGAACAGAGGAGTA-3′ (ApaI underlined, XhoI in bold, and XbaI italicized). Each 5′ flank product was digested withXbaI and cloned independently into both pTBT and pTPT (gifts of M. Cross and P. Borst, the Netherlands Cancer Institute). pTBT contains the 400-bp blasticidin S deaminase ORF (BSR) flanked by 240 bp of 5′ and 330 bp of 3′ processing signals derived from the 5′ and 3′ flanks of T. brucei α-tubulin ORF. pTPT contains identical processing signals flanking the 600-bp puromycinN-acetyltransferase (PAC) ORF . Amplified 3′-targeting flanks for each gene were independently digested with ApaI and cloned into both pTBT and pTPT already containing the respective 5′-targeting flank. The final transformation constructs were digested with NotI and XhoI prior to being transformed into T. brucei, and transformants were selected with 10 μg·ml−1 blasticidin or 1 μg·ml−1puromycin. Correct integration of cassettes into both KU loci was determined by Southern blot analysis. Genomic DNA from KUwild type and mutant cell lines was digested with EcoRI and separated on a 0.6% agarose gel. The gel was subsequently Southern-blotted onto Hybond XL (Amersham Biosciences) and probed with the same KU70 and KU80 ORF-derived sequences used to probe the genomic library. Following hybridization, the blots were washed to a final stringency of 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. A 12-kb fragment corresponding to intact KU70 was detected in both wild type and heterozygous cell lanes but was absent in the homozygous mutants. Two bands were present in KU80wild type lanes due to allelic differences (∼9 and 15 kb). One of these bands was lost upon disruption of the first allele, whereas both were lost in ku80 homozygous mutants. Probing the blots withKU70 and KU80 5′-flanking sequence confirmed the correct integration of the BSR and PAC resistance cassettes. Again, the blots were washed to a final stringency of 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Construct pCC101 was used to reintroduce KU70 to its original locus. The entire KU70 ORF, along with 620 bp of 5′-flanking sequence, was isolated as a 2.9-kb PCR-amplified fragment using the following primers: KU70RE-EXPFOR, 5′-GGCCAAGTTAACGCTTCAGCTGATGGTCGCC-3′, KU70RE-EXPREV; 5′-GGATCGGTTAACGCGCAACCGAGGAGGAAACC-3′ (ApaI underlined). The fragment was amplified using a 10-min denaturation step followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 6 min at 72 °C. This was followed by 10 min at 72 °C. This reaction was carried out using Pfu DNA polymerase, and the fragment was cloned into a unique HpaI restriction enzyme site in pNR101. This placed the KU70sequence upstream of a construct with ∼400 bp of actin intergenic sequence at the 5′ flank of the bleomycin resistance gene and 330 bp of an α-β-tubulin intergenic region at the 3′end. In the homozygous mutants, the 620 bp of KU70 5′ flank and α-β intergenic region act as targeting flanks, allowing KU70 to be reintroduced into the disrupted locus. The only potential difference in expression is that 3′ processing is provided by the actin intergenic region rather than the natural KU70 3′ signals. The pCC101 was linearized with NotI prior to electroporation, and transformants were selected on semisolid agarose plates containing 2.0 μg·ml−1 bleomycin (Invitrogen). Integration of re-expression cassettes was tested by Southern blot analysis; genomic DNA was digested with EcoRI, separated on a 0.6% agarose gel, Southern-blotted, and probed with the KU70 ORF sequence. Each transformant had integrated the KU70re-expression cassette, as expected. The control construct used in this analysis (pRM450) contains the bleomycin-resistant gene (BLE) surrounded by the same processing signals as in pTBT/pTPT and targets the tubulin array. This was cut withNotI and XhoI for transformation and targets the tubulin locus. The method used to measure frequencies at which the various cell lines switch their VSG coat has been described previously (34McCulloch R. Barry J.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2875-2888Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Mice immunized against the VSG221 coat were injected with 5 × 107 trypanosomes of the clones 3174.2 wild type (wt), 70Pac3.1+/−, 70Pac4.2+/−, 70Pac3.1B−/−, or 70Pac4.2B−/−. The mice were sacrificed by cardiac puncture 24 h later, and trypanosomes were isolated and cloned in 96-well plates as described previously (40McCulloch R. Rudenko G. Borst P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The number of switched clones that grew through was used to calculate the frequency of switching events and assumed an in vivo doubling time of 8 h. To test the ability of ku70 mutants to grow and divide in the presence of the DNA damaging agents methyl methanesulfonate (MMS; Sigma) or phleomycin (Cayla), a subclonal viability assay was adopted. Cell lines were grown to a maximum density of 2 × 106 cells·ml−1but more typically from 5 × 105 to 1 × 106 cells·ml−1. Each cell line was then diluted to a concentration of 25 cells·ml−1 in HMI-9 with or without MMS or 50 cells·ml−1 for phleomycin. Each mutagen was titrated against wild type trypanosomes to determine the sublethal range. To assess the effect of MMS on growth, the diluted cells were spread over a 96-well culture dish (5 cells/well for MMS, 2 cells/well for phleomycin, minimum densities giving reproducible growth data), and the number of wells with growing trypanosome populations were counted after 7–9 days. In vitro growth rates were measured by diluting mid-log bloodstream trypanosomes to a concentration of 1 × 105·ml−1 in 1.5 ml of HMI-9 medium in 24-well culture dishes. Cell concentrations were measured using a hemocytometer (Sigma). Wild type, heterozygotic, and homozygotic KU70 and KU80 cell lines were subcloned on semisolid agarose HMI-9 plates. Multiple clones for each were then grown to a density of 2 × 106trypanosomes·ml−1, and genomic DNA was prepared and digested with EcoRI or AgeI depending on the expression site under analysis. EcoRI cuts 3 kb upstream ofVSG221, which is located in the active expression site.AgeI cuts just within the 5′ end of the coding sequence of the VO2 gene in the transcriptionally inactive expression site analyzed. Genomic DNA digests were separated on a 0.6% agarose gel, Southern-blotted onto Hybond XL (Amersham Biosciences), and probed with the amino terminus region of either VO2 orVSG221. Three previously characterized metacyclic VSG loci were used to analyze the transcriptional status of MVSGs in the procyclic stage. Total RNA from KU70 wild type, heterozygous, and homozygous mutant cell lines was prepared using TRIzol. cDNA was generated using random hexamers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (following protocols from Invitrogen). Integrity of cDNA was tested using a control PCR on cDNA to amplify RNA polymerase I mRNA as described previously (41Blundell P.A. Rudenko G. Borst P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 76: 215-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Three characterizedMVSG loci, MVSG1.22, 1.61, and 1.63, were examined by PCR for the presence of transcripts both proximal to the promoter and around the VSG. PCR was carried out on the cDNAs with ∼3 pmol of upstream and downstream primers with an initial 10-min denaturation at 95 °C followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. These reactions were carried out using TaqDNA polymerase (Abgene Ltd.) for each locus except the MVSG1.61promoter proximal region, where Pfu DNA polymerase was used with 2 mm MgSO4 and a lower annealing temperature of 50 °C. The PCR primers were designed as follows:MVSG1.22 promoter proximal, primer 5′ ends were +29 and +214 from the transcription start site defined from metacyclic nascent transcripts, 2M. L. Ginger, P. A. Blundell, and J. D. Barry, unpublished results. and VSG coding sequence primer 5′ ends were +426 and +666 from the ATG start codon, which is 2934 bp from the transcription start;MVSG1.61 proximal promoter ends were +28 and +287 from transcription start, and coding sequence ends were −5 and +305 from ATG, which is 2783 bp from the transcription start; MVSG1.63proximal promoter ends were +59 and +230 from transcription start, and coding sequence ends were +621 and +837 from ATG, which is 2988 bp from the transcription start. As neither Ku70 nor Ku80 has a high degree of interspecies similarity even at the polypeptide level (42Gell D. Jackson S.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3494-3502Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), the T. brucei genome sequence databases were blast-searched individually with all known homologues. Although most hits were unique to each query sequence, some were shared by more than one. Detailed searching of databases, using Smith-Waterman algorithms, supported the view that these common hits did indeed correspond to Ku homologues. Using PCR-amplified fragments based on these sequences as probes, full-length trypanosome sequences were obtained by the isolation of overlapping genomic clones from our existing genomic library. Sequence analysis revealed complete open reading frames (trypanosomes are almost fully intronless) potentially encoding polypeptides of 81 kDa for the Ku70 homologue and 69 kDa for the Ku80 homologue. It was possible to align parts of those sequences with the primary homology regions (PHRs) of other Ku homologues by Clustal W analysis (Fig.1). The predicted sizes of the trypanosome Ku proteins are the inverse of what occurs in other organisms, and their designation is complicated further by the general relatedness of Ku70 and Ku80 and the dispersion of homologous sequences throughout the proteins. Our belief that the larger protein corresponds to Ku70 relies on the outcome of blastp and PSI-blast searching, which routinely place it closer to Ku70 than Ku80 proteins, and the presence at its carboxyl-terminal of a partial putative DNA binding SAP domain (6Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1365-1374Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 43Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 112-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) that has the secondary structure potential of other SAP sequences. Trypanosome Ku80 likewise detects mainly Ku80 sequences in blast searching. It does not have a recognizable DNA-dependent protein kinase binding sequence found at the end of vertebrate Ku80 proteins, but neither do the yeast Ku80 proteins. Homology-based modeling using JPRED (jura.ebi.ac.uk:8888/) reinforced the similarity of the trypanosome sequences to known Ku proteins of other organisms and also suggested a likely reason for most of the extra length of the trypanosome Ku70. Essentially all α helices and β strands in the crystal structure of the human protein (44Walker J.R. Corpina R.A. Goldberg J. Nature. 2001; 412: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar) are present in the predicted trypanosome Ku70 structure, except in the region of the ring that encircles DNA. Although in other species there are about 50 residues between the βG and βM strands, the trypanosome has about 120 amino acids. It is intriguing that trypanosome Ku80 has a typical 75 residues in the corresponding region, revealing an asymmetry between the two monomers in the ring region. To analyze the function of Ku, initially looking for general phenotypes described previously in other organisms and then questioning possible specific roles inVSG switching, we adopted the approach of deleting both alleles of either KU to generate null mutants. Genomic Southern analysis revealed that both KU70 and KU80 probably are single copy genes (data not shown), an interpretation subsequently confirmed during gene knockouts. Initially, we deleted genes in bloodstream stages of T. brucei S427 grown in vitro. In the 3174.2 strain, which is marked with the HYG and NEO antibiotic resistance genes in its transcriptionally active telomere, we deleted the first KU70 copy using the puromycin resistance cassette (PAC), obtaining the independent clones, 70P3.1(+/−) and 70P4.2(+/−). Both then had the second allele deleted with the blasticidin resistance cassette (BSR), generating the clones 70P3.1B(−/−) and 70P4.2B(−/−). A number of subclones of each of these were derived, enabling the study of events in individual sublineages. A similar approach was used for KU80, except that blasticidin resistance was used first, followed by puromycin. This generated the independent heterozygotic clones 80B1.1(+/−) and 80B1.3(+/−), from which were derived the homozygous mutant clones 80B1.1P(−/−) and 80B1.3P(−/−), respectively. The first phenotype examined was growth. The population doubling time of wild type 3174 trypanosomes (9.35 and 9.75 h in two experiments) compared well with those of the heterozygous mutants 70P3.1(+/−) (10.25 h), 70P4.2(+/−) (10.25 h), 80B1.1(+/−) (10 h), and 80B1.3(+/−) (9.12 h), as well as those of the null mutants 70P3.1B(−/−) (9.75 h), 70P4.2B(−/−) (10 h), 80B1.1P(−/−) (9 h), and 80B1.3P(−/−) (9.25 h). Ku therefore is not essential for bloodstream trypanosome growth, and its absence causes no detectable increase in population doubling time, indicating that there is neither a general delay in the cell cycle nor chronical d"

Kidney dysfunction might be correlated with changes in sulfatides, the major acidic glycosphingolipids in this organ. To elucidate their in vivo metabolic pathway these compounds were analyzed in mice afflicted with inherited glycosphingolipid disorders. The mice under study lacked the genes encoding either β-hexosaminidase α-subunit (Hexa−/−), the β-hexosaminidase β-subunit (Hexb−/−), both β-hexosaminidase α and β-subunits (Hexa−/− and Hexb−/−), GD3 synthase (GD3S−/−), GD3 synthase and GalNAc transferase (GD3S−/− and GalNAcT−/−), GM2 activator protein (Gm2a−/−), or arylsulfatase A (ASA−/−). Quantification of the sulfatides,I3SO 3− -GalCer (SM4s), II3SO 3− -LacCer (SM3),II3SO3−-Gg3Cer (SM2a), and IV3,II3-(SO3−)2-Gg4Cer (SB1a), was performed by nano-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. We conclude for the in vivo situation in mouse kidneys that: 1) a single enzyme (GalNAc transferase) is responsible for the synthesis of SM2a and GM2 from SM3 and GM3, respectively. 2) In analogy to GD1a, SB1a is degraded via SM2a. 3) SM2a is hydrolyzed to SM3 by β-hexosaminidase S (Hex S) and Hex A, but not Hex B. Both enzymes are supported by GM2-activator protein. 4) Arylsulfatase A is required to degrade SB1a. It is probably the sole sphingolipid-sulfatase cleaving the galactosyl-3-sulfate bond. In addition, a human Tay-Sachs patient's liver was investigated, which showed accumulation of SM2a along with GM2 storage. The different ceramide compositions of both compounds indicated they were probably derived from different cell types. These data demonstrate that in vivo the sulfatides of the ganglio-series follow the same metabolic pathways as the gangliosides with the replacement of sulfotransferases and sulfatases by sialyltransferases and sialidases. Furthermore, a novel neutral GSL, IV6GlcNAcβ-Gb4Cer, was found to accumulate only in Hexa−/− and Hexb−/− mouse kidneys. From this we conclude that Hex S also efficiently cleaves terminal β1–6-linked HexNAc residues from neutral GSLs in vivo.

In addition, complex sulfatides have been recognized to rank among the strongest ligands for NKR-P1. This membrane protein, with an extracellular Ca2+-dependent lectin domain, is expressed on natural killer cells that display innate immunity (4Bezouska K. Yuen C.T. O'Brien J. Childs R.A. Chai W.

This relationship is further suggested by largely identical carbohydrate substitution positions for sulfate and sialic acid. These mouse kidney sulfatides include lactosylceramide-II3sulfate (SM3), SM2a, and gangliotetraosylceramide-II3, IV3 bis-sulfate (SB1a) (8Tadano-Aritomi K. Hikita T. Fujimoto H. Suzuki K. Motegi K. Ishizuka I. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1237-1243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In general, GSLs are synthesized from a ceramide core by modification with glycosyl- and sulfotransferases in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi. Degradation of GSL takes place at the surface of intra-lysosomal vesicles by the action of exoglycosidases, sulfatases, and sialidases. For several of these degradation steps, the presence of one of the five known lysosomal activator proteins is required (9Kolter T. Sandhoff K. Angew. Chem. Int. Edit. 1999; 38: 1532-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Defects in the lysosomal enzymes or activator proteins that degrade GSLs are the cause of severe human inherited diseases such as metachromatic leukodystrophy and the different forms of GM2 gangliosidosis. Deficiency in arylsulfatase A in metachromatic leukodystrophy leads to lethal demyelination in the central and peripheral nervous systems. This disease is characterized by the lysosomal accumulation of the sulfatides SM4s, SM4g, and SM3 (10von Figura K. Gieselmann V. Jaeken J. Scriver C.R.

Chem. 1974; 355: 744-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Defects in the β-hexosaminidase isozymes (Hex S, (α/α); Hex A, (α/β); and Hex B, (β/β)) or in the GM2 activator protein lead to GM2 gangliosidosis, in which ganglioside GM2 and related glycolipids accumulate in lysosomes mainly of neuronal cells. The GM2 gangliosidoses include Tay-Sachs disease (B-variant), due to mutations in the HEXA gene encoding the α-subunit of β-hexosaminidase, Sandhoff disease (0-variant), due to mutations in the HEXB gene encoding the β-subunit, and the AB-variant characterized by mutations in the GM2A gene. For all three enzyme defects, the severe infantile forms result in rapidly progressing neurodegeneration, culminating in death before age 4 years (12Gravel R.A. Kaback M.M. Proia R.L. Sandhoff K.

The human Tay-Sachs liver material was from a girl that died at the age of 2 years and 10 months. The girl was affected with the classical form of Tay-Sachs and symptoms were apparent from 8 months of age including hyperaccusis. The control liver material was from a healthy 42-year-old male donor who died in an accident. All chemicals and solvents were of p.A. grade. Gold-sputtered borosilicate glass capillaries, type D, were purchased from Teer Coatings Ltd. (Worcestershire, UK). Lyso-sulfatide (lyso-SM4s), sulfatide (SM4s), GlcCer, GalCer, LacCer, GM3, Gg3Cer, and bovine brain gangliosides were obtained from Matreya Inc. (Chalfont, PA), sphingosyl-phosphorylcholine, Forssman glycolipid, triethylamine, myristic acid, nonadecanoic acid, heptacosanoic acid,N-hydroxysuccinimide,N, N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, anthrone, taurodesoxycholate, orcinol, absolute tetrahydrofuran, as well as, absolute N,N-dimethylformamide, both over molecular sieve from Sigma-Aldrich (Deisenhofen, Germany), SCDase (sphingolipid ceramide N-deacylase) from Takara Shuso (Otsu, Shiga, Japan), DEAE-Sephadex A-25 from Amersham Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden), ammonia solution 25% p.A., LiChroprep RP-18 and LiChroprep Si 60 Silica Gel from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), and dialysis tubes, Visking type 27/32 from Roth (Karlsruhe, Germany). GM2 was isolated from human GM2 gangliosidosis brain. SM3 was extracted from human kidney. SM2a and SB1a were isolated from rat kidney. In general, 100 g of tissue was homogenized on ice in 100 ml of distilled water with an Ultra Turrax T25 basic from IKA Labortechnik (Staufen, Germany) (6 × 2 min of homogenizing at 24,000 rpm with pauses of 2 min in between). The homogenate was freeze-dried and subsequently extracted with acetone. The freeze-dried tissue then was extracted for GSL, 2 times with chloroform/methanol/water (C/M/W) (10/10/1) and once with C/M/W (30/60/8). The combined C/M/W extracts were concentrated and dialyzed against 5 × 5 liters of distilled water. The dialyzed extract was lyophilized, dissolved in C/M/W (30/60/8) and loaded on DEAE A-25 column to separate neutral and acidic lipids. Elution was with a stepwise gradient of 20, 80, 200, 500, and 1000 mmmethanolic potassium acetate (KAc). SM3 was eluted with the 200 mm, SM2a with the 80 mm, and SB1a in the 500 mm KAc fraction. The fractions were desalted by dialysis with 5 × 5 liters of distilled water and lyophilized. From the corresponding fractions, the sulfated GSLs were further purified by repeated silica gel flash column chromatography with the appropriate mixtures of n-hexane/isopropyl alcohol/water or C/M/W as running solvent systems. Commercially available, or from tissue isolated and purified, GSLs were dissolved in C/M/W (10/10/1). Aliquots in the range of 5–20 nmol were dried in an 1.5-ml test tube with a gentle stream of nitrogen. 100 μl of water and 500 μl of anthrone reagent were added. Then the cups were sealed and clamped in between two metal plates so that the lids could not open. One of the plates had appropriate holes for the lower part of the cups to fit through. The cups were incubated for 15 min at 100 °C and then cooled in a water bath at room temperature for further 20 min. Calibration curves were obtained with samples containing a mixture of the free sugars in the appropriate equimolar ratio equaling the ratio of the individual GSL to be quantified (as an example: for SB1a quantification, Glc, Gal, and GalNAc were mixed in the ratio 1:2:1). 300 μl of each sample was placed into a flat-bottomed transparent 96-well microtiter plate. Absorption was measured at 620 nm. Lyso-SM3, lyso-SM2a, and lyso-SB1a as well as lyso-GM3 and lyso-GM2 were obtained by treatment of the purified compounds with SCDase according to Ref. 26Kurita T.

The crude products were purified by silica gel column flash chromatography using an appropriate mixture of C/M/W as running solvent system. (Prior to activation 2-hydroxy fatty acids were esterified with acetic anhydride as follows: 2-hydroxy-myristinic acid was dissolved in 200 μl of anhydrous and alcohol-free chloroform + 50 μl of acetic anhydride + 50 μl of 0.1% N, N-dimethylaminopyridine in chloroform. The reaction mixture was incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Then 500 μl of toluol were added and the sample dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen at 37 °C. The sample was dissolved again in 200 μl of toluol and dried again as before.) Fatty acids (65 μmol) were dissolved in 4 ml of dry tetrahydrofuran under nitrogen gas and activated with 0.82 equivalents of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and 0.93 equivalents of N-hydroxysuccinimide. Reaction took place overnight at room temperature. For condensation, about 100 nmol of lyso-GSL was dissolved in 2 ml of dry N, N-dimethylformamide and 4 μl of triethylamine. Then 2 ml of the activated fatty acid were added. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 2–5 days and monitored by TLC. Upon the long incubation some GSL were also acylated at hydroxyl groups. This resulted in a smear on TLC, running faster than the GSL standard. The reaction mixtures were, therefore, treated with 0.1 m methanolic KOH for 2 h at room temperature. This mild base treatment was also necessary to remove the acetate ester from the 2-hydroxy group of SM4s (18:1,h14:0). The crude products were purified by silica gel column flash chromatography. Aliquots of the synthesized GSL MS standards in the range of 0.3–1.0 nmol were spotted on TLC using a Linomat IV from CAMAG (Muttenz, Switzerland). On adjacent lanes corresponding GSL TLC standards were spotted in different concentrations to obtain calibration curves. After development in chloroform, methanol, 0.2% aqueous CaCl2 (60/35/8) GSL bands were developed with orcinol/sulfuric acid spray reagent at 110 °C for 20 min or with 10% CuSO4 in 8% H3PO4 at 150 °C for 20 min. The amount of the GSL compounds was determined by densitometric scanning of each lane at a wave length of 440 nm (Shimadzu CS-9301 TLC scanner). For each GSL the C14, C19, and C27 fatty acid containing compounds were mixed in an equimolar ratio resulting in the ready-to-use MS standard of known concentration. Kidneys wet weight was determined, and the kidney homogenized on ice in 5 ml of distilled water with a Ultra Turrax T25 basic (6 × 30 s of homogenizing at 24,000 rpm with pauses of 30 s in between). GSL MS standards were transferred to glass tubes and the solvent was evaporated with a gentle nitrogen stream. An aliquot of the aqueous kidney homogenate, equal to 20 mg of organ wet weight, was added, and the sample was sonicated for 5 min. Thereafter, the sample was lyophilized and extracted 2 times with 2 ml of acetone. The residual pellet then was extracted twice with 1.5 ml C/M/W (10/10/1) and with 2 ml of C/M/W (30/60/8) for GSL. Neutral and acidic GSL of the combined C/M/W extracts were separated on DEAE A-25 columns (bed volume: 300 μl). The flow-through and wash yielded fraction 1, containing the neutral GSL. Acidic GSL, collected as fraction 2, were eluted with 4 ml of 500 mm methanolic potassium acetate. Solvent was evaporated and acid GSL (fraction 2) desalted with RP-18 (200 mg RP-18 material per column) column chromatography. Fraction 1 was dissolved in 100 μl of 5 mm methanolic ammonium acetate, and fraction 2 in 100 μl of methanol. If necessary, samples were further diluted for nano-ESI-MS/MS. Human liver GSLs were extracted in analogy to the mouse kidney protocol. Since the Tay-Sachs liver was stored frozen for more than 25 years it lost barely any weight by freeze drying. Therefore GSL concentrations were calculated per mg dry weight. Extraction without MS standards was carried out with 150 mg dry weight, introducing MS standards with 20 mg. All analyses were performed with a triple quadrupole instrument (VG micromass (Cheshire, UK) model Quattro II) equipped with a nano-electrospray source operating at an estimated flow rate of 20–50 nl/min. Usually, 10 μl of a samples, dissolved in methanol or methanolic ammonium acetate (5 mm), was filled into a gold-sputtered capillary. The capillary was positioned at a distance of 1–3 mm in front of the cone. The source temperature was set to 30 °C and the spray was started by applying 800–1200 V to the capillary. For each spectrum 20–50 scans of 15–30 s duration were averaged. All tandem MS experiments were performed with argon as collision gas at a nominal pressure of 2.2–2.7 × 10−3 mbar. The parameters for the cone voltage and the collision energy of the different scan-modes are listed in Table I.Table IParameters used with the different scan-modi of nano-ESI-MS/MS[Polarity] and scan modusCharge of detected ionsMeasured substancesConeCollision energyVeV[−] Precursor ion m/z97(−)Sulfatides by [HSO4]−fragment 70–105 60–115[−] Precursor ion m/z 220(−)Sphingolipids containing HexNAc12558[−] Precursor ion m/z405(−)Sphingolipids containing (HexNAc)212550[−] Precursor ion m/z322(−)IV6-GlcNAcβ-Gb4Cer compared to Forssman glycolipid12558[−] Product ion(−)Fragments of sulfatides 70–10540–60[−] Product ion(−)Fragments of Forssman glycolipid and IV6GlcNAcβ-Gb4Cer12558[+] Precursor ion m/z 264(+)Neutral sphingolipids containing C18-sph or C18-phyto by fragment from sphingoid base35–7044–90[+] Precursor ion m/z 204(+)Sphingolipids containing HexNAc55–9065–75[+] Precursor ion m/z 407(+)Sphingolipids containing (HexNAc)27540[+] Product ion(+)Fragments of Forssman glycolipid or IV6GlcNAcβ-Gb4Cer7040 Open table in a new tab Quantitative spectra were measured with an average mass resolution of 1200 (ion mass/full width half-maximum). Peak height values of the first mono-isotopic peak of each compound were taken for evaluation. From the peak intensities of the corresponding internal standard lipids a linear trend was calculated. The obtained calibration curve represented the intensity of the internal standard molar amount at a given m/z value. In addition, a linear trend for n+2 molecular isotopic signal intensities (molecules containing either two13C-atoms or one 34S-atom, and, thereby, shifted by m/z 2 upwards) was calculated from the internal standards. If necessary, signal intensities were corrected first from influence of n+2 signal overlap. This overlap appears if lipids, that contain one additional double bond, are present. Then their n+2 signal overlaps with the main signal of the lipid without this double bond. From the corrected intensity ratio (sample lipid/internal standard trend) and the amount of internal standard added the quantity of the individual molecular species (e.g. SM4s (18:1, 16:0) or SM4s (18:1, 24:1)etc.) was calculated. From the sum of individual molecular species then the amount of a lipid (SM4s) resulted. Endogenous SB1a, GM3, and GM2 were correlated to the sole corresponding standard. For TLC analysis, 50 mg of kidney wet weight were extracted as above using the appropriate volumes. The neutral and acidic GSL fractions were each taken up in 100 μl of C/M/W (10/10/1). Aliquots according to the Figure legends were spotted on TLC plates with a Linomat IV from CAMAG (Muttenz, CH). A pre-run was performed with chloroform/alcohol (C/A) (1/1). Then the plates were dried and GSL were separated with the running solvent chloroform, methanol, 0.2% aqueous CaCl2(60/35/8), if not otherwise noted.

This allowed selective analysis of the structure of starch formed within a 30-s period. This time frame is shorter than the period required for the formation of a single crystalline amylopectin lamella and consequently permits a direct analysis of intermediary structures during granule formation. Analysis of chain length distribution showed that the most recently formed outer layer of the granules has a structure different from the mature starch. The outer layer is enriched in short chains that are 6–11 glucose residues long. Side chains with 6 glucose residues are the shortest abundant chains formed, and they are formed exclusively by transfer from donor chains of 12 glucose residues or longer. The labeling pattern shows that chain transfer resulting in branching is a rapid and efficient process, and the preferential labeling of shorter chains in the intermediary granule bound glucan is suggested to be a direct consequence of efficient branching. Although similar, the short chain intermediary structure is not identical to phytoglycogen, which is an even more highly branched molecule with very few longer chains (more than 40 glucose residues). Pulse and chase labeling profiles for the dbe mutant showed that the final structure is more highly branched than the intermediary structures, which implies that branching of phytoglycogen occurs over a longer time period than branching of starch. The formation of intermediary glucans, mature starch, and phytoglycogen was studied using leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana wild type and dbe mutant, which lacks plastidic isoamylase (Zeeman, S.

Starch is the major carbohydrate reserve in many plant storage organs, including specialized roots, stems, and endosperms in which starch may accumulate to high levels and be stored over long time periods. The stored starch provides the energy reserve that allows plants to survive under unfavorable conditions and serves as the carbon source during germination. In contrast, transitory leaf starch is accumulated during the photoperiod and remobilized during the following night. Thereby, starch serves as a buffer for assimilates, which enable leaves to continue the export of sugars during the night period. This is essential for plant performance, as demonstrated by the poor growth mutants, which are deficient in starch formation (1Lin T.P. Caspar T. Somerville C. Preiss J. Plant Physiol. 1988; 86: 1131-1135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Caspar T. Huber S.C. Somerville C Plant Physiol. 1985; 79: 11-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or starch remobilization (3Zeeman S.C. Northrop F. Smith A.M. ap Rees T. Plant J. 1998; 15: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 4Zeeman S.C. Umemoto T. Lue W.L., Au- Yeung P. Martin C. Smith A.M. Chen J. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1699-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Starch, deposited as well defined granules inside plastids, is composed of two types of polysaccharides, amylose and amylopectin. Amylose consists of predominantly linear α-1,4-glucans with a molecular mass in the range of 105 to 106. Amylopectin is a highly branched structure containing shorter chains of α-1,4-glucans and frequent α-1,6 branch points (5Manners D.J. Carbohyd. Polym. 1989; 11: 87-112Crossref Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of amylopectin is 107-108 (6Kossmann J. Lloyd J. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 2000; 19: 171-226Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Typically amylopectin constitutes 70–80% of the starch. However, transitory starch appears to contain almost exclusively amylopectin (4Zeeman S.C. Umemoto T. Lue W.L., Au- Yeung P. Martin C. Smith A.M. Chen J. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1699-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 7Tomlinson K.L. Lloyd J.R. Smith A.M. Plant J. 1997; 11: 34-43Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar) Starch granules are highly organized structures, with densely (1.4 g ml−1) packed molecules. At the supramolecular level, large granules are clearly ordered in layers, so-called growth rings, readily visible by light microscopy. The granules are semicrystalline, and the amylopectin molecules account for this crystallinity. According to the current understanding, the amylopectin glucan chains are radially arranged and ordered in alternating amorphous and crystalline lamellae. The amorphous lamellae are regions with more abundant α-1,6 branch points, whereas the crystalline lamellae consist of the linear α-1,4-glucan chains organized in parallel double helices congregated into clusters, which form crystalline lattices (8Buléon A. Colonna P. Planchot V. Ball S. Int. J. Biol. Mol. 1998; 23: 85-112Google Scholar). The width of the repeated crystalline and amorphous layers is 9 nm, a feature that is highly conserved for starches from many botanical sources (9Jenkins P.J. Cameron R.E. Donald A.M. Starch Staerke. 1993; 45: 417-420Crossref Scopus (325) Google Scholar). By specific hydrolysis of the α-1,6 branch point using isoamylase (debranching) and chromatographic separation of the derived linear glucan chains, it is possible to obtain a branch length distribution profile of the amylopectin. No matter what the botanical source or organ, these profiles are polymodal, which is a direct reflection of the repeated lamellar structure of the starch granule. The profile may vary with the botanical source but is highly conserved for specific types of starch (10Blennow A. Engelsen S.B. Munck L. Møller B.L. Carbohyd. Polym. 2000; 41: 163-174Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The molecular structure of starch directly affects its functionality, and because starch is of immense agronomic importance as a major constituent of many crops, there has been great interest in understanding the details of the biosynthesis and structure of starch. A large body of research has been directed at investigating starch biosynthesis in major crops including cereal seeds and potato tubers, as well as in important model systems such as Arabidopsis and the green algae Chlamydomonas. The major enzymes responsible for starch biosynthesis and its regulation have been identified (6Kossmann J. Lloyd J. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 2000; 19: 171-226Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 11Preiss J. Preiss J. The Biochemistry of Plants, Carbohydrates. 14. Academic Press, San Diego1988: 181-254Google Scholar, 12Smith A.M. Denyer K. Martin C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 67-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), and the formation of the precise structure has proved to be a complex process that requires the concerted action of several isoforms of starch synthases and branching enzymes and most likely also other modifying enzymes. Despite considerable progress in understanding the molecular basis of starch formation, we still do not know precisely the parameters defining the specific molecular structures and the three-dimensional organization of amylopectin molecules. A specific aspect that has prompted recent re-evaluation of how the final starch structure may be achieved is the apparent contribution of isoamylase. Mutants of maize (13James M.G. Robertson D.S. Myers A.M. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), rice (14Kubo A. Fujita N. Harada K. Matsuda T. Satoh H. Nakamura Y. Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 15Nakamura Y. Kubo A. Shimamune T. Matsuda T. Harada K. Satoh H. Plant J. 1997; 12: 143-153Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar),Chlamydomonas (16Mouille G. Maddelein M.L. Libessart N. Talaga P. Decq A. Delrue B. Ball S. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1353-1366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Arabidopsis (4Zeeman S.C. Umemoto T. Lue W.L., Au- Yeung P. Martin C. Smith A.M. Chen J. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1699-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), which all lack plastidic isoamylase activity, accumulate a more highly branched polysaccharide, phytoglycogen, which is not organized in well defined granules. This suggests a close relationship between the packaging of the amylopectin molecules and the branching and chain length distribution; that debranching may be essential in determining the final amylopectin structure. Isoamylase has been proposed to remove excess of highly branched molecules, and two models of its action have been proposed. According to the first model, based on work with Chlamydomonas, debranching is an integrated element in formation of the final amylopectin structure. The model suggests the formation of highly branched “preamylopectin” on the outer surface of growing granules (16Mouille G. Maddelein M.L. Libessart N. Talaga P. Decq A. Delrue B. Ball S. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1353-1366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the final structure requires trimming of excessive short chains followed by elongation of the remaining chains. This “trimming” model would predict the structure of the outermost layer of a starch grain to be different from the final structure. An alternative model was proposed for the Arabidopsis system, where data suggest that starch and phytoglycogen represent two independent polysaccharides, which may accumulate simultaneously (4Zeeman S.C. Umemoto T. Lue W.L., Au- Yeung P. Martin C. Smith A.M. Chen J. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1699-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that isoamylase is required to prevent accumulation of intermediary soluble highly branched glucans (17Smith A.M. Biomacromolecules. 2001; 2: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). This model does not directly predict a specific structure of the outer amylopectin layer but suggests that smaller phytoglycogen-like molecules may exist as a separate short-lived glucan pool. To understand starch biosynthesis it would therefore be valuable to know specifically the structure of the outermost amylopectin layer and to investigate the potential formation of intermediary pools of glucan polymers. Because of the technical difficulties, there are as yet no direct observations of the structure of the most recently formed layer of amylopectin. We embarked on developing a method to reveal immature amylopectin structures, which would provide novel information on possible intermediate steps in achieving the final amylopectin structure. Based on pulse labeling of leaf starch through photosynthesis in 14CO2 we examined herein the structures of starch and phytoglycogen formed within a 30-s period. This corresponds to a time frame shorter than the period required for the formation of a single crystalline amylopectin lamella. The labeling pattern reveals that the outer layer of the granules has a different structure from the final starch, showing preferential formation of shorter chains (DP6–11). This new approach to the study of starch biosynthesis provides novel detailed information on starch and phytoglycogen biosynthesis.

For each labeling four uniform leaves (each with a lamina area of about 1–2 cm2) were excised from young vegetative plants at the end of the photoperiod. The leaves were kept in a transparent box on a humidified paper towel in light for about 10 min before the experiment was initiated. The leaves were then placed on a stainless steel grid in a 15-ml labeling chamber made of a polystyrene Petri dish.14CO2 was evolved from 0.5 ml of a [14C]bicarbonate solution by the addition of 10-fold excess acid (HCl) and shaking the final solution with 1 ml of air contained in a 5-ml syringe fitted with a injection needle. The resulting radioactive air was injected into the labeling chamber, and the air in the chamber was immediately agitated efficiently for 2–3 s by an electric fan fitted beneath the grid. In total, 3.7 MBq of14CO2 was injected resulting in a specific activity of 0.16 GBq mmol−1 CO2 in the chamber. During both labeling and pre-incubation, 200 μmol s−1 m−2 light was provided by fluorescent light tubes. Labeling was continued for periods of 30 s to 10 min. The labeling was initiated by injection and terminated by opening the chamber and immediately transferring the leaves to hot extraction medium as described below. Other leaves were transferred to a humid transparent box on a wet paper towel and left in light for 2–20 min before extraction (chase by photosynthesis in nonlabeled air). The labeled leaves were each extracted first in 3× 5 ml of 90% (v/v) ethanol at 80 °C, then in 4× 5 ml of 80% (v/v) ethanol 40 °C, and finally in 5× 5 ml of 50 mm sodium acetate-HCl (pH 5.0) at 40 °C. The extracted insoluble leaf material was transferred to a 1.5-ml screw-cap microtube with 300 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate-HCl (pH 5.0), and the starch in the sample was gelatinized by heating it for 10 min at 90 °C. The sample was then cooled to room temperature, added to 0.7 units of Pseudomonas isoamylase (2 μl of enzyme in 3.2 m NH4SO4) (Megazyme), incubated at 42 °C 1 h, and heated for 2 min to 95 °C to inactivate remaining enzyme. Anionic compounds were removed by applying 270 μl of the solution to a 100-μl anion-exchange column (OH− form of AG 2-X8; BioRad) and eluting the neutral glucans with an additional two more times with 100 μl of distilled water. All fractions containing neutral glucans (470 μl) were collected together and stored at ice until further analysis. Five 14C-labeled leaves were homogenized for 30 s at 0 °C in 30 ml of a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and 5 mm EDTA using a Polytron PT 3000 (Kinematica AG) homogenizer. Cell debris was filtered off through glass wool and the starch granules collected by centrifugation. The starch granules were washed three times with distilled water before being dried at room temperature. HPAEC separation with on-line pulsed amperometric detection (PAD) of debranched neutral glucans, integration of chromatograms, and subsequent correction for varying PAD detector response was performed as described (18Blennow A. Bay-Smidt A.M. Wischmann B. Olsen C.E. Møller B.L. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 307: 45-54Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). An aliquot (100 μl) of isoamylase-debranched starch or phytoglycogen was used for each chromatographic analysis. Fractions were collected either by automated collection (0.25- or 2-ml fractions) or by manual collection of individual peaks, each representing a defined degree of polymerization (DP, number of glucose residues in chain). The fractions were made acidic by addition of 200 μl of 2 m HCl to 0.8 ml of each fraction, and 3 ml scintillation liquid (Ecoscint A, National Diagnostics) was added to the mixture. Radioactivity in the samples was determined with a liquid scintillation counter (Wallac). For manually collected fractions, which varied in size, the whole fraction was counted after acidification and the addition of 10 ml of scintillation liquid. Leaves were extracted, washed, and then gelatinized in 270 μl of buffer as indicated above. Radioactivity released to the buffer by heating the leaf samples was negligible (below 0.1% of label released by the following enzyme treatments). Outer chains were degraded by the addition of 2 μl (4 units) of barley β-amylase (Megazyme) and incubation for 1 h at 40 °C; radioactivity released to the solution was determined by counting the total radioactivity in five successive washes with 2 ml of buffer. The radioactivity of the fifth wash was in all cases below 0.3% of the total label released by the enzyme treatments. The remaining starch was then degraded and released from the leaf sample by incubating it for 1 h with an additional 2 μl (2 units) of Aspergillus niger amyloglucosidase (Megazyme) at 40 °C. The radioactivity released was determined in three successive washes with 2 ml of buffer, and total released activity was calculated from these data. A procedure was developed for in vivo pulse labeling of starch in Arabidopsis leaves during photosynthesis in14CO2. The procedure was optimized to allow very short pulses (30 s or less), rapid quenching of the labeled plant material, and incorporation of sufficient radioactivity for structural analysis. This was achieved by using ample14CO2 and a minimized labeling chamber volume with efficient stirring. Direct extraction of whole leaves in hot ethanol (80 °C, 90% v/v) secured immediate quenching. To facilitate handling of the leaf material during extraction, samples were not homogenized or frozen before extraction. As we observed that freezing of the debranched starch samples occasionally influenced the HPAEC separation, the debranched samples were kept on ice but never frozen. For the very short pulses, the major fraction of the fixed14C was recovered in few metabolites, presumably in the Calvin cycle, disturbing the glucan HPAEC profiles. To completely remove these compounds the extensive washing procedure was followed by ion-exchange purification of each sample. Large amounts of radioactivity were fixed in the leaves during 15–60 s of pulse labeling (Fig. 1A). Essentially all of the radioactivity was found in ethanol-soluble, water-soluble, or starch fractions, and only insignificant amounts remained in the insoluble fraction (cell walls, data not shown). Radioactivity incorporated per leaf increased with pulse time (Fig. 1A). Leaves were chosen to be of similar size (∼1 cm2), but to minimize the disturbance of the leaves after harvest the area was not determined. With increasing pulse time the fraction of 14C found in starch increased from 3 (15 s) to 18% (60 s). During the following 10-min chase period (photosynthesis in nonradioactive CO2), the fraction of label recovered in starch increased to ∼50%. The low14CO2 fixation combined with low incorporation into the starch fraction during the 15–20-s pulses resulted in radioactivity levels too low for structural analysis, because this requires considerable radioactivity in even less abundant individual unit chains. Labeling for 30 s gave sufficient radioactivity in each unit chain to allow a detailed structural analysis. Hence, the following labeling experiments were all performed with a 30 s pulse period. Starch is organized in crystalline lamellae with a 9-nm pitch; and the labeling procedure was developed to analyze selectively the structure of the outermost layer. Ideally, the pulse label should be located exclusively at the end sections of glucan unit chains, which are not yet substituted with an α-1,6-linked side chain, i.e. at the outer chains. Degradation with β-amylase, an enzyme that cannot bypass the α-1,6 branch points and thus produces remaining glucans called β-limit dextrins, confirmed that after a 30-s pulse 94% of the radiolabel is located in the outer chains beyond the last branching points (Fig. 2). During the following 10–20-min chase period the fraction of 14C released by β-amylase decreased to 51%, as expected for carbon remaining in β-limit dextrin of uniformly labeled starch. Having confirmed that pulse and pulse-chase labeling represents outer and inner (mature) lamellae, we proceeded to analyze the starch structure during its formation. The individual unit chains of the starch were separated by HPAEC (Fig. 3A, PAD trace) and 2-ml fractions were collected over 84 ml. The radioactivity of each fraction was determined, and the value was normalized to the total radioactivity in the 42 fractions. This allowed a comparison of the distribution profile for individual samples. It should be noted that the 2-ml fractions do not correspond to specific unit chain length, because these do not elute equidistantly. A clear difference in distribution of radioactivity was consistently observed when comparing pulse and pulse-chase samples. Leaves labeled for 30 s and quenched after a 10- or 20-min chase period showed a similar and characteristic distribution (Fig. 3, B and C). This is reminiscent to the PAD response, which corresponds to the total starch fraction and is similar for all leaves (only shown in Fig. 3A). There was a peak plateau in radioactivity around 19–27 min (at approximately DP11–15), a valley starting at 32–33 min (DP 18) and a second peak at 40–44 min (around DP 23). On average, the radioactivity peaked later (longer chains) as compared with the PAD response. This difference is due to the fact that the PAD response primarily detects the glucose residue at the reducing end and therefore does not reflect the size of the molecules. The labeling profiles demonstrate that a uniform label of the chains was obtained after a 10-min chase period. Leaves quenched immediately after a 30-s pulse had a different distribution of label. Radioactivity was present over the entire elution profile (Fig. 3A) but with a preferential labeling of the shorter chains (DP 6–12) and a generally lower incorporation in the longest chains. To evaluate the 14C distribution in individual unit chains, fractions were collected at short intervals for a pulse-labeled sample in which the amount of 14CO2 used during labeling was increased (Fig. 4). The refined fractions reveal that radioactivity elutes as peaks corresponding exactly to the PAD-detected unit chains. A high incorporation in short chains was observed in agreement with the results presented in Fig. 3. The reason for the more extreme peak in the short-chain area in Fig. 3A is that the smaller unit chains elute close to each other and are collected in fewer fractions than the longer chains. Collection of smaller fractions prevents this effect (Fig. 4). The first large peak of radioactivity corresponds exactly to DP6. Only minute amounts of radioactivity are found at DP3, DP4, and DP5. For a more robust comparison of the starch structure and distribution of radiolabel, peaks corresponding to individual unit chains were collected separately (Fig. 5). Consistent with the refined automatic sampling (Fig. 4), this analysis showed that the shortest chains, which contained a considerable amount of14C after 30 s, were DP6 (Fig. 5A). After a 10-min chase period the label distribution shifted to longer chains (Fig. 5, B and C), and the distribution was similar to the relative corrected weight distribution of carbohydrate (Fig. 5D). Collecting individual unit chains permits calculation of the differential distribution between the pulse and pulse-chase samples (Fig. 5C). This clearly shows that during the 30-s pulse there is a relatively higher label in chains DP6–11 and a lower label in chains above DP12, with the largest difference at DP15–16. The very long chains (>DP40) showed little difference in relative intensity of label. To gain more information on a possible phytoglycogen-like fraction and to validate that the labeling procedure will identify differences in glucan structures formation, we applied the procedure to the dbe mutant of Arabidopsis, which accumulates phytoglycogen (4Zeeman S.C. Umemoto T. Lue W.L., Au- Yeung P. Martin C. Smith A.M. Chen J. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1699-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The labeling profiles showed a markedly different distribution of label in the dbe mutant, with higher density of label in the short chains, DP6–11, and a lower radioactivity in longer chains, especially above DP40, than in the WT plants (compare Fig. 5, A and F). This difference became even more pronounced after the 10-min chase period (compare Fig. 5,B and G). These data reflect the fact that accumulated glucans in the dbe mutant are composed of shorter chains and a very low abundance of the longest chains as demonstrated for the corresponding distributions of total carbohydrate (Fig. 5, I and J). The calculated relative molar distributions of individual unit chains (Fig. 5, E and J) clearly illustrates that the short chains (DP3–10) are more abundant in the dbe mutant. The difference in distribution of radiolabel between pulse and pulse-chase for the dbe mutant (Fig. 5H) was less prominent than for the WT plants, but we consistently observed a shift in labeling pattern toward shorter chains during the chase period. Although higher in the dbe mutant than in WT plants, the carbon accumulated in the very short chains (DP2–5) was still neither abundant (Fig. 5I) nor heavily labeled (Fig. 5, F and G). The preferential pulse labeling of short chains could represent either soluble or granule-bound glucans. To investigate this possibility, pulse-labeled leaf batches were divided in halves, and starch grains were isolated by mild centrifugation after homogenization of a half-sample, whereas the other half-sample was analyzed as described above (nonhomogenized leaves). The samples were each analyzed for distribution of radiolabel in unit chains. The recovery of radiolabel was considerably lower in the isolated starch grains, but distribution was almost identical to the nonhomogenized samples (data not shown). The ratio of label in chains ≤11 and chains ≥12 is diagnostic for the chase shift in distribution (Fig. 5C). This ratio was very similar for the two types of samples, as 29 and 30% of label in chains ≤11 was found in isolated starch granules and extracted leaf samples, respectively. For a comparison, 17% of label was found in chains ≤11 in the 10-min chased leaf sample. During the last decade, considerable progress has been made in the understanding of starch biosynthesis. In general, the biochemical mechanisms responsible for starch formation are conserved from algae to higher plants (19Buleon A. Gallant D.J. Bouchet B. Mouille C. D'Huls C. Kossmann J. Ball S. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, starch structure varies with tissue and species, and our understanding of the formation of the precise structures remains incomplete. Different models have been proposed to account for the highly organized structures (17Smith A.M. Biomacromolecules. 2001; 2: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 20Myers A.M. Morell M.K. James M.G. Ball S.G. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 989-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), and work done with mutants of Chlamydomonas, Arabidopsis, maize, and rice suggests that isoamylase may play a general role in determining starch structure. These studies have clearly demonstrated the value of specific mutants, and targeted selection of further mutants will be important in promoting a comprehensive understanding of starch formation. However, new approaches such as our very short pulse labeling technique will be essential to the realization of this research potential. The current models for amylopectin biosynthesis predict that intermediary structures are formed during starch biosynthesis. We decided to develop a method that would specifically radiolabel the most recently deposited starch, corresponding to only one 9-nm lamella. The intensity should be sufficient to allow determination of radioactivity in each unit chain after debranching. Transitory starch is formed during the photoperiod and degraded during the following night.Arab"
https://openalex.org/W2137052570,"Annexin 6 is one of a widely expressed family of calcium-binding proteins found in most mammalian tissues, including the heart. Several studies have implicated annexin 6 in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ signaling, and it has been shown in vitro to act as a modulator of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-release channel, cardiac L-type calcium channel, and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. To investigate the role of annexin 6 in intact cardiomyocytes, we used mice containing a targeted disruption of the annexin 6 gene. Compared with controls, the myocytes of annexin 6 null-mutant mice demonstrated a significant increase in the rates of shortening and relengthening. Intracellular Ca2+ transients in fura-2-loaded cardiomyocytes induced by caffeine showed a normal baseline and amplitude, whereas the rate of decay was doubled in annexin 6-/- myocytes compared with control mice. These results show that annexin 6 knockout in the mouse leads to an increase in myocyte contractility and faster diastolic Ca2+ removal from the cytoplasm. In light of published findings showing annexin 6 to be down-regulated in end-stage heart failure, these results are consistent with a role for annexin 6 as a negative inotropic factor in the regulation of cardiomyocyte mechanics."
https://openalex.org/W2133393212,"ATP and creatine phosphate (PCr) are prime myocardial high-energy phosphates. Their relative concentrations are conserved among mammalian species and across a range of physiologic cardiac workloads. The cardiac PCr/ATP ratio is decreased with several pathologic conditions, such as ischemia and heart failure, but there are no reports of an increase in the cardiac PCr/ATP ratio in any species or with interventions. We studied the in vivo energetics in transgenic mice lacking expression of the glucose transport protein GLUT4 (G4N) and observed a significant 60% increase in the myocardial PCr/ATP ratio in G4N that was confirmed in three different experimental settings including intact animals. The higher PCr/ATP in G4N is cardiac-specific and is due to higher total cardiac creatine (CR) concentrations in G4N than in wild-type (WT). However, [ATP], [ADP], and -DG(-ATP) did not differ between the strains. Expression of the creatine transport protein (CreaT) that is responsible for creatine uptake in myocytes was preserved in G4N cardiac tissue. These observations demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, that G4N manifest a unique increase in the cardiac PCr/ATP ratio, which suggests a novel genetic strategy for increasing myocardial creatine levels."
https://openalex.org/W2039903787,"The α4 integrins play important roles in embryogenesis, hematopoiesis, cardiac development, and the immune responses. The α4 integrin subunit is indispensable for these biological processes, possibly because the α4 subunit regulates cellular functions differently from other integrin α subunits. We have previously reported that the α4 cytoplasmic domain directly and tightly binds paxillin, an intracellular signaling adaptor molecule, and this interaction accounts for some of the unusual functional responses to α4 integrin-mediated cell adhesion. We also have identified a conserved 9-amino acid region (Glu983-Tyr991) in the α4cytoplasmic domain that is sufficient for paxillin binding, and an alanine substitution at either Glu983 or Tyr991within this region disrupted the α4-paxillin interaction and reversed the effects of the α4 cytoplasmic domain on cell spreading and migration. In the current study, we have mapped the α4-binding site within paxillin using mutational analysis, and examined its effects on the α4tail-mediated functional responses. Here we report that sequences between residues Ala176 and Asp275 of paxillin are sufficient for binding to the α4 tail. We found that the α4 tail, paxillin, and FAT, the focal adhesion targeting domain of pp125FAK, could form a ternary complex and that the α4-binding paxillin fragment, P(Ala176–Asp275), specifically blocked paxillin binding to the α4 tail more efficiently than it blocked binding to FAT. Furthermore, when expressed in cells, this α4-binding paxillin fragment specifically inhibited the α4 tail-stimulated cell migration. Thus, paxillin binding to the α4 tail leads to enhanced cell migration and inhibition of the α4-paxillin interaction selectively blocks the α4-dependent cellular responses. The α4 integrins play important roles in embryogenesis, hematopoiesis, cardiac development, and the immune responses.

The α4 integrin subunit is indispensable for these biological processes, possibly because the α4 subunit regulates cellular functions differently from other integrin α subunits. Indeed, the α4 integrin promotes increased cell migration and less cell spreading and focal adhesion formation relative to most other β1 integrins.

Paxillin also interacts with pp125FAK, a molecule strongly implicated in the regulation of cell migration (23Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Norura S. Fujimoto J.

Furthermore, the α4 cytoplasmic domain markedly enhances activation of pp125FAK. The enhanced pp125FAK phosphorylation depends on the integrity of the paxillin-binding site in the α4 tail (10Liu S.

These results suggest that the direct association of paxillin with the α4 cytoplasmic domain might facilitate the rapid recruitment and activation of paxillin-binding proteins such as pp125FAK, thus accounting for some of the unusual biological properties of α4 integrins. In the current study, we have tested this idea by examining the capacity of the α4 tail to form ternary complex with paxillin and pp125FAK. Furthermore, we have mapped the α4-binding site to a 100-amino acid fragment within the N-terminal domain of paxillin. This α4-binding fragment blocked the binding of paxillin to the α4 tail to a much greater extent than to FAT. Furthermore, when expressed in cells, this α4-binding paxillin fragment inhibited α4tail-stimulated cell migration, but not migration mediated by integrin α5β1. Thus, the binding of paxillin to the α4 tail leads to enhanced cell migration and specific inhibition of α4-paxillin interaction selectively blocks α4-dependent cellular responses. focal adhesion targeting Chinese hamster ovary glutathione S-transferase focal adhesion kinase fibronectin bovine serum albumin 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays phosphate-buffered saline hemagglutinin focal adhesion targeting Chinese hamster ovary glutathione S-transferase focal adhesion kinase fibronectin bovine serum albumin 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays phosphate-buffered saline hemagglutinin Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing αIIbα4β3β1Achimeric integrin or α4β1 integrin have been described previously (10Liu S.

Recombinant full-length paxillin (GST-free) was produced by thrombin digestion of recombinant GST-paxillin fusion protein and purification through glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences). C-terminal truncation mutants of N-terminal domain of paxillin were created by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). Primers for QuikChange reactions were designed so that at each truncation site, the amino acid codon was replaced with a stop codon. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using wild-type GST-paxillin cDNA construct as a template following the manufacturer's instruction. Each site-directed mutation was then confirmed by cDNA sequencing, and expression and isolation of the mutant protein were performed as described (11Liu S. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

Briefly, aliquots of recombinant GST fusion protein of paxillin or its mutants were mixed with 300 μl of buffer A: 10 mm Pipes, 50 mmNaCl, 150 mm sucrose, 1 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm sodium pyrophosphate, pH 6.8, plus 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Triton X-100, 3 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), added to 20 μl of model protein-loaded resins, and incubated at room temperature with rotation for 2 h. Resins were then washed three times with the same buffer. Bound proteins were extracted with reducing SDS sample buffer, separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (PAGE), and detected with antibodies specific for HA-tag or GST followed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Wells of Ni-NTA HisSorb strips (Qiagen) were coated with 100 μl of His-tagged integrin model proteins or His-tagged FAT, a recombinant protein derived from the focal adhesion targeting sequence of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) plus 0.2% BSA at 4 °C overnight. The next day, wells were washed with PBS three times and blocked with 150 μl of 1% (w/v) heat-denatured BSA at room temperature for 1 h. The wells were then washed with PBS three times. 100 μl of recombinant paxillin or its mutants at different concentrations dissolved in PBS plus 0.2% (w/v) BSA was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Unbound proteins were washed out with PBS three times. Bound proteins were stained with mouse anti-HA tag (1:1,000 dilution in PBS plus 1% BSA) or mouse anti-GST antibodies (1:1,000 dilution in PBS plus 1% BSA) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by 1 h incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:1,000 dilution in PBS plus 1% BSA) (BioSource). After three washes, bound proteins were assayed by measuring peroxidase activity with o- phenylenediamine as a substrate and quantified by reading its optical density at 490 nm. For competition assays using paxillin fragment, P(Ala176–Asp275), or recombinant full-length paxillin (GST-free), the same modified ELISA assays were performed except that different concentrations of this fragment was included in the paxillin solution added to the integrin model protein- or FAT-coated wells. Data were expressed as percentage of inhibition: (1 − B/B0) × 100%; where B = A490 in the presence of the competitor and B0 = A490in its absence. For construction of mammalian expression vectors encoding paxillin fragments, PCR was used to generate an XhoI-HindIII fragment including Myc tag, EQKLISEEDL, sequence at the 3′ end of each paxillin fragment sequence. Each PCR product was ligated into the pCR vector using a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). After confirmation by cDNA sequencing, each fragment was ligated into XhoI-Hind III sites of pcDNA3.1(−) vector (Invitrogen). αIIbα4β3β1A-expressing CHO cells were co-transfected with vector encoding each paxillin fragment plus vector encoding GFP (cDNA ratio of paxillin fragment to GFP; 50:1), or a control vector plus GFP at the same ratio, using LipofectAMINE transfection (LipofectAMINE PLUS, Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were trypsinized and resuspended. Aliquots of cells were used for cell adhesion or migration as described below, and other cells were lysed using RIPA buffer.

Equal numbers of αIIbα4β3β1A-expressing CHO cells transfected with different cDNA constructs as described were plated on the fibrinogen- or FN-coated wells and incubated in a 37 °C incubator for 30 min. At the end of the experiment, unattached cells were washed away with PBS. Attached cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, washed twice with PBS, and counted under a microscope with high magnification. For cell migration using Transwell chambers (8 μm, Costar), both sides of chambers were coated with 10 μg/ml fibrinogen or FN overnight at 4 °C. The coated chambers were blocked with 1% heat-denatured BSA. 100 μl of transfected cells (1.0 × 105 cells) resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 0.5% FBS were added to the upper chamber and 500 μl of same medium added to the lower chamber. The cells were then allowed to migrate at 37 °C for 4 h. At the end of the experiment, the cells migrated to the lower side were collected and counted either under a microscope with high magnification or counted using fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. For cell migration assay using real time video phase-contrast microscopy, cells (2.0 × 104) were plated on coverslips coated with 10 μg/ml fibrinogen or FN. Dishes for cell migration were prepared as described previously (30Kiosses W.B. Daniels R.H. Otey C. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. J.

Dishes were placed in an open chamber with atmospheric and temperature control and cell movement viewed with a Nikon DiaPhot Microscope equipped with a SenSys cooled CCD video camera linked to a Silicon Graphics work station running the Inovision ISEE software program. αIIbα4β3β1AExpressing CHO cells transfected with vectors encoding paxillin fragment plus GFP, or a control vector plus GFP as described above were detected by immunofluorescence and random cell migration of these cells were assessed by time-lapse imaging beginning 45 min after cell plating, and followed by recoding of every 5–10 min intervals for 5 h. At the end of the experiment, images of cells were outlined and the centroid (cell center) calculated. Displacement of the centroid was then used to determine cell movement over time. Paxillin binding to the α4cytoplasmic domain accounts for some of unusual biological properties of the α4 integrins (10Liu S. Thomas S.M. Woodside D.G. Rose D.M. Kiossess W.B. Pfaff M. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 11Liu S. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

We employed integrin tail model protein affinity chromatography to identify the regions of paxillin responsible for binding to the α4 cytoplasmic domain. The N-terminal half of paxillin, P(Met1–Gly315), bound to the α4cytoplasmic tail to the same extent as the full-length protein (Fig. 1, B and C). In contrast, the C-terminal half, comprised of four LIM domains, P(Gly326–Cys557), failed to bind (Fig. 1,B and C). Thus, the N-terminal region of paxillin is necessary and sufficient for paxillin binding. The N-terminal half of paxillin contains several regions known to mediate protein-protein interactions. This includes a Pro-rich domain responsible for its interaction with the SH3 domains of Src and Crk family members (31Weng Z. Taylor J.A. Turner C.E. Brugge J.S. Seidel-Dugan C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 268: 14956-14963Google Scholar), however, removal of this domain, PΔ(Ile43–Gly60) (Fig. 1 B), was without effect on binding to the α4 tail. The N terminus of paxillin also contains 5 LD repeats known to be involved in its interactions with binding partners (14Brown M.C. Curtis M.S. Turner C.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 677-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). An internal deletion that disrupts LD repeats LD2 and LD3, PΔ(Gln101–Glu226), partially blocked binding to the α4 tail (Fig. 1, B and C), In contrast, a further N-terminal deletion, PΔ(Ala57–Asn99), did not abolish α4 binding activity (Fig. 1, B and C). In addition, paxillin contains multiple tyrosines that can become phosphorylated to mediate binding to Crk adaptors or Csk kinase (12Turner C.E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 13Turner C.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E231-E236Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). However, alanine substitutions at these Tyr residues, P(Y31A,T118A, T181A), did not affect the α4binding (Fig. 1, B and C). These data indicate that the α4 binding function of paxillin can be separated from many of its other binding activities and that residues contained in the Gln101–Glu226 interval contribute to this activity. To further narrow the localization of the paxillin-binding site, we analyzed sequential C-terminal truncation mutants of the N-terminal half of paxillin. P275X bound to the α4 tail, suggesting that the last 50 amino acid residues of N-terminal region of paxillin are dispensable for the α4 binding (Fig. 2). However, removal of 50 more residues (P225X) markedly reduced the binding to ∼25% of that of N terminus. An additional 50-residue truncation (P175X) blocked binding completely (Fig. 2). Thus, these data show that sequences between residues Ala176–Asp275 are required for paxillin to bind"

In cultured cybrid cells it causes a 70% decrease in tRNASer(UCN) abundance and mild respiratory impairment, previously suggested to be due to decreased tRNA stability. When mitochondrial transcription was blocked by ethidium bromide treatment, the half-life of the mutant tRNA was not significantly different from that of wild-type tRNASer(UCN). Over-expression of mitochondrial translational elongation factor EF-Tu also had no effect on the mutant phenotype. However, during recovery from prolonged ethidium bromide treatment, the synthesis of the mutant tRNASer(UCN) was specifically impaired, without polarity effects on downstream tRNAs of the light strand transcription unit. We infer that the mutation acts posttranscriptionally to decrease tRNASer(UCN) abundance by affecting its synthesis rather than its stability. The extent of aminoacylation of the mutant tRNA was also decreased by ∼25%. In contrast, the mutation had no detectable effect on tRNASer(UCN) base modification or structure other than the insertion of an extra guanosine templated by the mutation, which was structurally protected from nuclease digestion like the surrounding nucleotides.

By contrast, mutations affecting tRNASer(UCN), which are frequently homoplasmic or implicated pathologically only at high levels of heteroplasmy, have rather modest effects on mitochondrial function and are generally associated with mild or tissue-restricted pathological states, principally sensorineural deafness. The 7472insC mutation is one such mutation. Clinically, most subjects have an apparently non-syndromic hearing impairment (16Verhoeven K. Ensink R.J. Tiranti V. Huygen P.L. Johnson D.F. Schatteman I.

In 143B osteosarcoma-derived cybrid cells, homoplasmy for the 7472insC mutation produces only a very modest biochemical phenotype, comprising a small decrease in complex I activity (17Tiranti V. Chariot P. Carella F. Toscano A. Soliveri P. Girlanda P. Carrara F. Fratta G.M. Reid F.M. Mariotti C. Zeviani M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and a growth deficit in galactose medium when the mutation is present in combination with a diminished copy number of mtDNA (19Toompuu M. Tiranti V. Zeviani M. Jacobs H.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2275-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Effects on mitochondrial protein synthesis are minimal, with only a slight quantitative decrease in mitochondrial translation products detectable by pulse labeling (19Toompuu M. Tiranti V. Zeviani M. Jacobs H.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2275-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), an effect mildly exacerbated by doxycycline treatment (19Toompuu M. Tiranti V. Zeviani M. Jacobs H.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2275-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The only clear molecular effect of the mutation that can be seen in cybrid cells is a decrease of ∼70% in the steady-state level of tRNASer(UCN) (19Toompuu M. Tiranti V. Zeviani M. Jacobs H.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2275-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), an effect shared with the A7445G deafness-associated mutation (20Reid F.M. Rovio A. Holt I.J. Jacobs H.T. Hum. Mol.

Biol. 1998; 18: 5868-5879Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Unlike the case of the latter, which has been studied only in lymphoblastoid cells, 7472insC produces no systematic change to the level of the upstream (ND6) mRNA, leading to the suggestion that its effects are most likely on the half-life of tRNASer(UCN) rather than on its processing (19Toompuu M. Tiranti V. Zeviani M. Jacobs H.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2275-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic analysis of [14C]serine-labeled tRNA also suggested only a minimal effect on aminoacylation. To investigate in further detail the molecular effects of the 7472insC mutation, we applied a variety of assays. These compared 143B osteosarcoma-derived cybrid cell lines homoplasmic for the mutation with those containing only wild-type mtDNA derived from the same patient. Mitochondrial tRNA half-lives and synthesis rates were measured via the use of ethidium bromide (EtBr) to block new transcription of mtDNA (8Yasukawa T. Suzuki T. Suzuki T. Ueda T. Ohta S. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4251-4257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Effects on aminoacylation were studied using oxidation-circularization of tRNA (12Börner G.V. Zeviani M. Tiranti V. Carrara F. Hoffmann S. Gerbitz K.D. Lochmuller H. Pongratz D. Klopstock T. Melberg A. Holme E. Pääbo S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) combined with minisequencing to determine the ratio of mutant to wild-type tRNA in the final product mixture. Effects on base modification were studied by primary sequence determination of tRNASer(UCN) (22Donis-Keller H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 3133-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 23Kuchino Y. Hanyu N. Nishimura S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 379-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and on secondary/tertiary structure by partial RNase digestion under non-denaturing conditions. Possible effects on tRNA stability were also investigated by overexpression of mitochondrial EF-Tu. These assays revealed a pronounced decrease in the rate of synthesis but not the half-life of the mutant tRNA, combined with a small but clear decrease in the extent of aminoacylation. Because of the absence of polarity effects on the synthesis of downstream tRNAs of the light strand transcription unit, the mutation is inferred to act posttranscriptionally. Only very subtle effects on structure or stability were found. Considered alongside previous findings on the A7445G mutation (20Reid F.M. Rovio A. Holt I.J. Jacobs H.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 21Guan M.X. Enriquez J.A. Fischel-Ghodsian N. Puranam R.S. Lin C.P. Maw M.A. Attardi G. Mol. Cell.

The final yield of tRNASer(UCN) for sequencing was estimated at ∼0.5–1 μg. RT-PCR used 0.0125A 260 units of random hexamers and Invitrogen M-MLV-RTase.

The nucleotide-specific RNases used for partial digestion were RNase T1 (USB), specific for G, RNase U2 (Amersham Biosciences) specific for A > G, RNase CL, i.e. from chicken liver (Sigma), specific for C, RNase A (USB), which cuts at C and U, RNase PhyM (Amersham Biosciences), which cuts at A and U, plus RNase ONE (Promega) and RNase T2 (Sigma), both of which are not base-specific. The procedures for the chromatographic method were as described previously (8Yasukawa T. Suzuki T. Suzuki T. Ueda T. Ohta S. Watanabe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4251-4257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Briefly, the tRNA was incubated at 95 °C for 1.5 min in water to induce single site, random cleavage. The 3′-half-fragments were 5′-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and electrophoresed in denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The ladders of 5′-32P-labeled fragments were then cut out one by one and eluted from the gel. Each of the 5′-labeled fragments was then digested completely by RNase P1. The resultant 5′-labeled nucleotides from each fragment were analyzed individually by two-dimensional TLC with two different solvent systems (23Kuchino Y. Hanyu N. Nishimura S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 379-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) on 10 × 10-cm plates. Solvent system A consisted of isobutyric acid/concentrated ammonia/H2O (66:1:33 by volume) in the first dimension and 2-propanol/HCl/H2O (70:15:15 by volume) in the second dimension. In solvent system B, the first dimension was the same as that used for system A, but 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.8/ammonium sulfate/1-propanol (100 ml:60 mg:2 ml) was used for the second dimension. For enzymatic probing of differences in secondary/tertiary structure, the 5′ end-labeled tRNA was refolded in 20–30 μl of renaturation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.5) by cooling from 95 to 35 °C at 2 °C per min and then digested with specific RNases at 37 °C in the same buffer. Approximately 5000 cpm of labeled RNA was used in each reaction. Alkaline digestions (in 50 mm Na2CO3, pH 9.0) were carried out on non-renatured tRNA heated to 95 °C and immediately quenched on ice. Intactness of the RNA to be used in enzymatic digests was checked electrophoretically after renaturation. The extent of aminoacylation of tRNASer(UCN)was measured using the oxidation-circularization assay, essentially as described by Börner et al. (12Börner G.V. Zeviani M. Tiranti V. Carrara F. Hoffmann S. Gerbitz K.D. Lochmuller H. Pongratz D. Klopstock T. Melberg A. Holme E. Pääbo S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) but with the following modifications. Total RNA was isolated by Trizol extraction from cells grown to 90% confluence and dissolved on ice in 0.1 mNaOAc, pH 5.0. In some experiments, small RNAs were isolated from 25 μg of total RNA, using chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose fast flow (Amersham Biosciences). Eluates were divided into four aliquots, precipitated, and used for two sets of oxidation-circularization reactions. RNA preparations from control and mutant cybrids were mixed in various arbitrary proportions, giving ratios of wild-type to mutant signal in the final assay of between 0.2 and 3. cDNA was synthesized from circularized tRNASer(UCN) using primer cser1 and then amplified with primers cser1 and cser2 (92 °C, 2 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C, 30 s, 55 °C, 30 s, 72 °C, 30 s; final extension at 72 °C, 5 min). RT-PCR products were isolated by 10% PAGE, eluted, and purified (PCR purification kit, Qiagen). Quantitation of the ratio of mutant to wild-type product from total and aminoacylated (oxidation-resistant) RNA was carried out by minisequencing using the ABI Prism SNaPshot ddNTP primer extension kit (PE Biosystems) under the conditions recommended by the supplier. Extension primers cser3 and cser4 (for opposite strands) were used to analyze all products. For half-life measurements, cell cultures were seeded at equal densities, giving 60–70% confluence, on 6-cm plates 14–16 h before the experiment. They were then incubated in fresh medium containing 250 ng/ml of EtBr for the times indicated in the figures. For synthesis measurements, cells were seeded at 50% confluence on 9-cm plates 14–16 h before the experiment and then incubated in medium containing 250 ng/ml of EtBr for two days after which they were passaged into fresh medium on 6-cm plates. Medium was again replaced after 5–6 h of recovery and then daily until cells were harvested at the times indicated in figures. Cells were either seeded initially at different densities so that they reached approximately the same final densities at the time of harvesting or else were passaged once more, reaching different final densities according to the time at which they were harvested. The two sets of data thus obtained were indistinguishable. Total RNA was isolated by Trizol extraction, separated on 12% PAGE/7 murea/TBE gels, and analyzed by Northern hybridization. Northern blots were quantitated by phosphorimaging as described previously (19Toompuu M. Tiranti V. Zeviani M. Jacobs H.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 2275-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial EF-Tu cDNA was amplified from human HEK293T cell cDNA in an RT-PCR reaction using the primers BamHI/TufA51 and HindIII/TufA33 (4 min at 94 °C, then 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 58 °C, 3 min at 72 °C, with a final extension of 15 min at 72 °C). The product was digested with BamHI and HindIII and cloned intoBamHI/HindIII-digested pcDNA3.1(-) Myc/His A (Invitrogen). Clones were sequence-verified against GenBank accession no. X84694 using BigDye terminator chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with a combination of vector-specific and mtDNA-specific primers. Sequencing products were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis on an Applied Biosystems 310 Genetic Analyzer using the manufacturer's software. The final TUFM clone (or empty vector) was transfected into 143B osteosarcoma cybrid cell lines 43 (control) and 47 (7472insC mutant), seeded on 9-cm plates and grown to 50–60% confluence. For each transfection, 4 μg of DNA and 40 μg of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) were diluted in 4 ml of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and added to cells washed with Opti-MEM. After 5 h 8 ml of fresh medium was added, and after 24 h cells were placed under selection in 1.6 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). After 1 week of selection cells were passaged to obtain single clones, which were picked and regrown in 6-well plates. The presence and expression of a transgene was tested by PCR and RT-PCR, using the primers described above. Whole cell lysates from transfected cell clones were processed for Western blotting essentially as described previously (27Spelbrink J.N. Toivonen J.M. Hakkaart G.A.J. Kurkela J.M. Cooper H.M.

Cells from a 6-cm plate were lysed in 50 μl of PBS/1% Triton-X100/2.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, vortexed, incubated on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged for 2 min at 14,000 × g max. Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford method (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214159) Google Scholar). For detection of EF-Tu mouse monoclonal mAb-68 (1:500 dilution) (Ref. 29Wells J. Henkler F. Leversha M. Koshy R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, a kind gift of Frank Henkler) and goat or horse anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (1:10000 dilution) antibodies were used. Detection of PAK1 (p21-associated kinase) used rabbit polyclonal PAKαC-19 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:5000 dilution) and horse anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (1:10000 dilution) antibodies. Fluorographs were analyzed by densitometry. To evaluate the structural effects of the 7472insC mutation, the primary sequence of tRNASer(UCN) from two different control cybrid cell lines was first determined (Fig. 1) via a combination of partial RNase digestion of end-labeled tRNAs (Donis-Keller method, see Ref. 22Donis-Keller H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 3133-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and TLC of postlabeled mononucleotides derived from a standard, stepwise degradation procedure (Kuchino method, see Ref. 23Kuchino Y. Hanyu N. Nishimura S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 379-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The tRNA was first purified by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography, followed by affinity hybridization to a specific biotinylated oligonucleotide immobilized on streptavidin-coated beads (26Wakita K. Watanabe Y. Yokogawa T. Kumazawa Y. Nakamura S. Ueda T. Watanabe K. Nishikawa K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Modifications of four kinds were detected at five positions of the tRNA. Two pseudouridines were found, one located in the anticodon stem (conventional position 28 based on the scheme given in Ref. 30Sprinzl M. Horn C. Brown M Ioudovitch A. Steinberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar, actual position 25 numbered from the 5′ end), the other in the T-loop at conventional position 55 (actual position 51), adjacent to a ribothymidine (conventional position 54, actual position 50), giving the conventional TΨC motif. In the anticodon loop, two additional modifications similar to those found previously in bovine mitochondrial tRNASer(UCN) (31Yokagawa T. Watanabe Y.I. Kumazawa Y. Ueda T. Hirao I Miura K.I.

We observed elevated plasma SP levels in HIV-infected men compared with uninfected subjects. In the present study, we investigated the possible cellular source of the increased SP level caused by HIV infection. Using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, we demonstrated that monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) and lymphocytes from both placental cord blood and adult peripheral blood expressed SP mRNA, which was significantly increased by HIV infection. HIV-induced SP expression was positively related to virus replication in the infected MDM. Purified recombinant HIV envelope glycoprotein 120 (gp120) derived from both the macrophage-tropic strain (MN) and the T lymphocyte-tropic strain (IIIB), when added to MDM cultures, enhanced SP mRNA expression. The gp120-induced SP expression was abrogated by pretreating the cells with soluble CD4. Furthermore, the activation of HIV in the latently infected promonocytic cell line (U1) and T-cell line (ACH-2) up-regulated SP mRNA expression. These data support the hypothesis that interaction of HIV and SP may have significant in vivo relevance to the immunopathogenesis of HIV infection and AIDS."

https://openalex.org/W2003611935,"WT1 was originally identified as a Wilms' tumor suppressor gene, but it may have oncogenic potential in leukemia and in some solid tumors. WT1 is a transcription factor that has been implicated in the regulation of target genes related to apoptosis, genitourinary differentiation, and cell cycle progression. Because induction of WT1 leads indirectly to increased p21 expression in osteosarcoma cells, we investigated the possibility that other genes involved in the G1/S phase transition might also be WT1 targets. Cyclin E plays a crucial role in the cell cycle by activating cyclin-dependent kinase 2, which phosphorylates Rb, leading to progression from G1 into S phase. We identified several WT1 binding sites in the cyclin E promoter. We demonstrate that WT1 binds to these sites and that in transient transfection assays WT1 represses the cyclin E promoter. This activity is dependent on the presence of a binding site located downstream of the transcription start site. In intact cells, induction of WT1 expression down-regulates cyclin E protein levels. These results provide the first demonstration that WT1 can directly modulate the expression of a gene involved in cell cycle progression.

These results provide the first demonstration that WT1 can directly modulate the expression of a gene involved in cell cycle progression. WT1 was originally identified as a tumor suppressor gene in hereditary cases of Wilms' tumor. This gene encodes a 57-kDa protein with an amino-terminal transcriptional regulatory domain and a carboxyl-terminal zinc finger DNA binding domain (1Call K.M. Glaser T. Ito C.Y. Buckler A.J.

Bruns G.A.P. Nature. 1990; 343: 774-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). WT1 mRNA is subject to two alternative splicing events leading to the generation of four distinct transcripts (3Haber D.A. Sohn R.L. Buckler A.J. Pelletier J. Call K.M. Housman D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9618-9622Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The first alternative splice involves exon 5, which is either included in or excluded from the mature message. The other alternative splice involves a choice between two 3′ splice acceptor sites at the beginning of exon 10. Selection of the more 5′ splice acceptor site adds nine base pairs (referred to as the KTS insert for the 3 amino acids encoded by these base pairs) to exon 10. These 3 additional amino acids alter the spacing between the third and fourth zinc fingers, changing the DNA recognition site of the protein (4Bickmore W.A. Oghene K. Little M.H. Seawright A. van Heyningen V. Hastie N.D. Science. 1992; 257: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 5Wang Z.Y. Qiu Q.Q. Huang J. Gurrieri M. Deuel T.F. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 415-422PubMed Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of WT1 and its association with RNA splicing factors are also affected by the presence or absence of the KTS insert (6Larsson S.H. Charlieu J.P. Miyagawa K. Engelkamp D.

Lamond A.I. Hastie N.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3217-3225Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). There are two classes of genes regulated by WT1. The first of these is composed of genes critical for the differentiation of the specific cell types that express WT1, in particular, the regulation of sex determination. For example, the Dax-1 promoter is dramatically up-regulated by the WT1 isoform lacking both exon 5 and the KTS insert (designated WT1(−/−)) and by the isoform that contains exon 5 but lacks the KTS insert (designated WT1(+/−)), whereas the isoforms containing the KTS insert (designated WT1(−/+)) and both exon 5 and the KTS insert (designated WT1(+/+)) have little effect (8Kim J. Prawitt D. Bardeesy N. Torban E. Vicaner C. Goodyer P. Zabel B. Pelletier J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2289-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A similar pattern is seen in the regulation of the mullerian inhibitory substance and SRY promoters by WT1 (9Hossain A. Saunders G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16817-16823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 10Nachtigal M.W. Hirokawa Y. Enyeart-VanHouten D.L. Flanagan J.N. Hammer G.D. Ingraham H.A. Cell. 1998; 93: 445-454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Each of these target genes is important in differentiation of the genitourinary system. The second class of genes regulated by WT1 includes those involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is up-regulated when WT1(−/−) is induced, although there is no evidence that this is a direct effect of WT1 on the p21 promoter (11Englert C. Maheswaran S. Garvin A.J. Kreidberg J. Haber D.A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1429-1434PubMed Google Scholar). Bcl-2 is also up-regulated by WT1(−/−), and this is a direct result of WT1 binding to sites in the bcl-2 promoter (12Mayo M.W. Wang C.Y. Drouin S.S. Madrid L.V. Marshall A.F. Reed J.C. Weissman B.E. Baldwin A.S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3990-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). These genes, despite serving more general roles in cellular function than Dax-1 and SRY, might also be important in terminal differentiation. The identification of p21 as a WT1-responsive gene led us to hypothesize that WT1 might also regulate the expression of other mediators of cell cycle progression. Here we present evidence that WT1 inhibits the expression of cyclin E and that the cyclin E promoter is a direct target of transcriptional regulation by WT1. The generation of 32D cl3 transfectants stably expressing an inducible human WT1(−/−) cDNA under the control of the sheep metallothionein promoter is described elsewhere. 1D. M. Loeb, J. L. Summers, A. D. Friedman, and S. Sukumar, submitted for publication. These cells were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 1 ng/ml interleukin 3 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and 1 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. pCB6WT1(−/−) contains the WT1(−/−) cDNA cloned downstream of the CMV immediate-early promoter, and pCB6WT1(+/+) contains the cDNA encoding WT1(+/+). Plasmid 2-3 (a kind gift from Dr. R. Weinberg, Whitehead Institute, Cambridge, MA) contains 2.2 kb of the human cyclin E promoter and first exon cloned into the multiple cloning site of pGL2basic, driving the expression of the cDNA for firefly luciferase (Promega, Madison, WI). The plasmid pRL-SV40 contains the cDNA for Renilla luciferase under the control of the SV40 early enhancer/promoter region. Transient transfection assays were performed using TransIT LT-1 (PanVera, Madison, WI) following the manufacturer's protocol. NIH 3T3 cells were plated in 6-well plates at 105 cells/well. Each well was transfected with 2.5 μg of plasmid 2-3, 0.7 μg of either the WT1 construct or the pCB6 vector, and 0.1 μg of pRL-SV40 as an internal control. 32D cl3 cells were plated in 100-mm tissue culture plates at 2 × 105cells/plate and were transfected with 10 μg of plasmid 2-3. Luciferase assays were performed using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega), and results were normalized by cotransfection with the pRL-SV40 Renilla luciferase plasmid. Mutagenesis of the WT1 cDNA was performed using the GeneEditor site-directed mutagenesis kit (Promega). The mutagenic oligonucleotide, 5′-GCGACGTGTT GCCTGGAGTAG-3′ (inserted T is in bold type), was synthesized based on the published sequence of a WT1 mutation present in a patient (case 126) with acute myeloid leukemia (13King-Underwood L. Pritchard-Jones K. Blood. 1998; 91: 2961-2968Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Successful mutagenesis was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Total cellular protein was isolated from cell lines by solubilizing cells in 1× Laemmli sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Protein was quantified using the Noninterfering Protein Assay (Geno Technology, St. Louis, MO). 15 μg of protein/lane was used for standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose using the Mini-PROTEAN II system (Bio-Rad). Nonspecific protein binding was prevented by blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk. Antibodies against WT1(C-19), Cdk2 (M2), cyclin D3 (C-16), Cdc25a (144), JAK3 2The abbreviations used are: JAKJanus kinaseCdkcyclin-dependent kinase (N-15), and cyclin E (M20) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

Appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were fromAmersham Biosciences, and antibody binding was revealed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Western blotting analysis system, AmershamBiosciences). Janus kinase cyclin-dependent kinase Nuclear extracts were prepared by a modification of the method of Schreiber et al.(14Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 μg/ml pepstatin A (all obtained from Sigma). The buffer contained additional protease inhibitors added by dissolving 1 complete Mini Protease Inhibitor Mixture tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)/7 ml of buffer. Cells were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C and then lysed by vortexing after the addition of Nonidet P-40 to a concentration of 0.5%. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 μg/ml pepstatin A with additional protease inhibitors as described above. Nuclei were extracted at 4 °C for 15 min, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Oligonucleotides (Operon Technologies, Alameda, CA) were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The sequences of the oligonucleotides are as follows (putative WT1 binding sites are in bold type and mutations in italics; only the sense strand is given, although each oligonucleotide was annealed to its complement): site 1, 5′-GCCAGGAAGGGCTTGCGGGGGAG GGGCGCATATGG-3′; mutant site 1, 5′-GCCAGGAAGGGCTTGC CAGGGAG GGGCGCATATGG-3′; site 2, 5′-AACTCGGCGTCTCGGGGGCG GGGAGGGCGTGCT-3′; mutant site 2, 5′-AACTCGGCGTCTCG AGGGCG GGGAGGGCGTGC-3′; site 3, 5′-GGAGCTGGGTGGGGGCG GGGTGCGGCCGGGTCGC-3′; mutant site 3, 5′-GGGGAGCTGGGTG ACCGCG GGGTGCGGCCGGGTCGC-3′. Nuclear extracts and the appropriate unlabeled oligonucleotides were mixed with 2× binding buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 22% glycerol, 120 mm KCl, and 10 mm ZnCl2) and 100 mg/ml poly(dI-dC) and incubated at room temperature for 10 min (30 min for supershift assays). Radiolabeled oligonucleotide was then added, and the incubation was continued for 15 min at room temperature. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE (0.045 M Tris borate, 0.001 m EDTA) at 200 V for 2 h and revealed by autoradiography. To generate expression constructs containing the cyclin E promoter lacking various WT1 binding sites, short deletions were made. To delete putative WT1 binding site 1 (nucleotides −745 to −737, the promoter was digested with BstXI (at position –868) and NdeI (at position –731), and the ends were made blunt with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase and religated together. To delete putative WT1 binding site 2 (nucleotides −507 to –499) the promoter was digested with BstEII (at position –559) and BlpI (at position –417), and the ends were made blunt with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase and religated. These constructs, missing both sites 1 and 2, were a gift from Dr. R. Weinberg (Whitehead Institute, Cambridge, MA) and contain a smaller fragment of the cyclin E promoter (positions –364 to + 1007) controlling the expression of firefly luciferase. Deletion of putative WT1 binding site 3 (nucleotides +262 to +270) was accomplished by digesting the plasmids with AccI (at position +204) and SrfI (at position +368), making the ends blunt with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, and religating. Promoter mutants containing deletions of multiple sites were generated by serial restriction digests and religations as described for the individual sites. All mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Among the proposed targets of WT1 is the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 (11Englert C. Maheswaran S. Garvin A.J. Kreidberg J. Haber D.A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1429-1434PubMed Google Scholar). Because p21 participates in the G1/S transition, we hypothesized that other regulators of this phase of the cell cycle might also be affected by WT1. To examine this possibility, we utilized a stably transfected cell line, designated 32DWT1.1, expressing an inducible human WT1(−/−) cDNA. The details of this cell line are described elsewhere,1 but briefly, the cell line was generated by transfecting 32D cl3 cells with a plasmid encoding the WT1(−/−) cDNA under the control of the sheep metallothionein promoter and selecting stable transformants in a mass culture. Treating 32DWT1.1 cells with 100 μm ZnCl2 overnight induces significant expression of the WT1(−/−) protein (Fig. 1). 32DWT1.1 cells and the control cell line 32DV4 (which was stably transfected with an empty metallothionein promoter-containing expression vector) were treated overnight with or without ZnCl2, and lysates were subjected to Western blotting with antibodies against a variety of proteins involved in cell cycle progression. In 32DWT1.1 cells, which express low levels of WT1(−/−) in the uninduced state, the basal level of p21WAF1/CIP1 was less than the basal level in 32DV4 cells, but induction of WT1(−/−) did not alter p21WAF1/CIP1protein expression. This suggests that the ability of WT1 to induce p21 expression is cell type-specific. Induction of WT1(−/−) by ZnCl2 also did not affect p27Kip1 expression and had no effect on the expression of a number of other mediators of cell cycle progression, including Cdk2, Cdk3, Cdk4, cyclin D3, Cdc25a, JAK3 (Fig. 1), or cyclin D2 (data not shown). Under the same experimental conditions, however, the level of cyclin E protein in WT1(−/−)-expressing cells was reduced by almost 4-fold (Fig. 1). Next, we sought to determine whether the decrease in the level of cyclin E protein upon induction of WT1(−/−) expression occurs through direct transcriptional suppression of the cyclin E promoter by WT1 (−/−). A reporter plasmid containing firefly luciferase under the control of the human cyclin E promoter was transfected into NIH 3T3 cells. Cotransfection of WT1(−/−) under the control of the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter resulted in a 4-fold decrease in luciferase activity (Fig. 2B). There was some variability in the degree of suppression in different experiments, with a range of 2.5- to 5-fold, although in most experiments there was a 4- to 5-fold suppression. In the same cells, the WT1(+/+) isoform was a much less efficient repressor of the cyclin E promoter, suppressing transcription by only 30% (Fig. 2B). A truncated form of WT1 lacking the carboxyl-terminal zinc finger region, which is required for DNA binding, had no effect on the cyclin E promoter in this assay (Fig. 2B). There was a clear dose-related suppression of the promoter by WT1(−/−), with decreasing luciferase activity as the ratio of WT1(−/−) to reporter plasmid increased (Fig. 2C). Because the ability of WT1 isoforms to modulate the activity of some promoters can vary by cell type, we wanted to determine whether the cyclin E promoter is also suppressed by WT1(−/−) in hematopoietic cells. Accordingly, we transiently transfected 32DWT1.1 cells with the cyclin E promoter-luciferase reporter construct and then treated the cells with ZnCl2 to induce the expression of the transfected WT1(−/−). Just as in the NIH 3T3 cells, the WT1(−/−) suppressed the cyclin E promoter in the 32DWT1.1 cells (Fig. 2D). No suppression was seen in the control 32DV4 cells transfected with the same construct and treated with ZnCl2. These findings suggest that WT1(−/−) efficiently and specifically down-regulates cyclin E levels, possibly by directly binding to the promoter and repressing transcription. Because WT1 has been shown to act as a dimer (15Reddy J.C. Morris J.C. Wang J. English M.A. Haber D.A. Shi Y. Licht J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10878-10884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), we investigated the possibility that the WT1(+/+) isoform could interfere with the ability of the WT1(−/−) isoform to repress the cyclin E promoter in this assay. NIH 3T3 cells were therefore transfected with the cyclin E reporter plasmid and WT1 (−/−), WT1(+/+), or a combination of the two isoforms in two different ratios. WT1(−/−) again efficiently repressed the cyclin E promoter, whereas WT1(+/+) was much less effective. Remarkably, the degree of promoter repression was less with increasing ratio of WT1(+/+) to WT1(−/−) (Fig. 2E). This is unlikely to represent competitive DNA binding, because WT1(+/+) has only weak affinity for WT1(−/−) binding sites. More likely, this reflects the ability of WT1(+/+) to heterodimerize with WT1(−/−) and to thereby inhibit DNA binding by the WT1(−/−) isoform. There are three potential binding sites in the cyclin E promoter for this isoform of WT1 (Fig. 2A); two sites are 5′ of the transcription start site, and one is within exon 1 (although 5′ of the translation start site), an arrangement seen in other promoters, such as the insulin-like growth factor I receptor, that are repressed by WT1(−/−). To confirm that WT1(−/−) binds to the putative binding sites identified in the cyclin E promoter, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Nuclear extracts were made from 32DV4 cells and from stably transfected cells treated overnight with ZnCl2to induce a high level of WT1(−/−) expression. The presence of WT1 protein in the extracts from the transfected cells was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 3A). Nuclear extract from the control cells contains an activity that binds to and retards the migration of a radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing WT1 binding site 1 (Fig. 3B). Nuclear extracts from WT (−/−)-expressing cells also contain DNA binding activity that recognizes this oligonucleotide. In contrast to the control cells, nuclear extracts from the WT1-expressing cells generate two distinct species in this assay. One of these species comigrated with the complex derived from the 32DV4 cells, and the second complex migrated slightly more rapidly (Fig. 3B). Inclusion of an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide in the reaction blocked the formation of both complexes. Strikingly, inclusion of an excess of an unlabeled oligonucleotide containing two point mutations that abrogate WT1 binding specifically eliminated the formation of the more slowly migrating complex, with no effect on the more rapidly migrating complex. These findings demonstrate that the slower migrating species represents a nonspecific protein-oligonucleotide complex, whereas the more rapidly migrating complex represents WT1(−/−) binding to the labeled oligonucleotide. Identical results were seen with a radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing WT1 binding site 2. A single species was found in the nuclear extract from the control cells, whereas two species, one of which migrated more rapidly than the species from the control cells, were found in the extracts from the WT1-expressing cells. Both species were inhibited by an excess of the unlabeled oligonucleotide, but only the more slowly migrating species was inhibited by an oligonucleotide containing a mutation that abrogates binding by WT1 (Fig. 3C). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was also carried out using these nuclear extracts and an oligonucleotide containing the third putative WT1 binding site, this one located in the 5′ untranslated portion of the mRNA. Unlike the other two sites, there was no activity in the nuclear extract from the control 32DV4 cells capable of retarding the migration of the oligonucleotide containing binding site 3 (Fig. 3D). An activity capable of binding this oligonucleotide was present in the nuclear extract from WT1(−/−)-expressing cells (Fig. 3D). This activity was inhibited by an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide but not by an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide containing a mutation that abrogates binding by WT1. Thus, this sequence is also bound by WT1(−/−), but unlike the other two binding sites, it is not bound by an activity present in the untransfected cells. Having demonstrated that WT1(−/−) can bind to each of the putative binding sites in the cyclin E promoter, we wanted to determine the relative importance of each of these sites for the regulation of the promoter. We therefore generated deletion mutants of the cyclin E promoter lacking each binding site alone and in combination. Luciferase reporter constructs containing these deletion mutants were cotransfected into NIH 3T3 cells with the plasmid encoding WT1(−/−). Similar to what was seen with the full-length promoter, deletion mutants lacking site 1, site 2, or both of these sites, were strongly repressed by WT1(−/−). In contrast, deletion mutants lacking site 3 alone, or in combination with the other binding sites, were no longer repressed by this isoform of WT1 (Fig. 4). Although the basal activity of the constructs lacking binding site 3 was significantly less than the other constructs (which might reflect an effect on either RNA stability or on the basal rate of transcription), there was still sufficient activity present compared with the promoterless pGL2basic (Fig. 4) that an effect of WT1(−/−) could have been observed. This finding suggests that transcriptional repression of the cyclin E promoter requires the presence of a WT1 binding site downstream of the transcription start site. Although WT1 was originally identified as a tumor suppressor gene, recent literature supports the view that it may have oncogenic potential in acute leukemia and in breast cancer (16Inoue K.

Niranjan B. Buluwela L. Weitzman S.A. Korz D. Sukumar S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 921-925PubMed Google Scholar). The protein product of the WT1 gene has transcriptional regulatory activity. A number of target genes have been identified that might be important for neoplasia. Because induction of WT1 expression leads to up-regulation of p21, we examined the promoters of other genes that function in the G1/S transition for the presence of the well defined consensus DNA binding sequence for the WT1(−/−) isoform. We discovered that the promoter for cyclin E, another key regulator of cell cycle progression, contains three potential WT1(−/−) binding sites. Cyclin E functions by binding to and activating Cdk2 (18Ohtsubo M. Theodoras A.M. Schumacher J. Roberts J.M. Pagano M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2612-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar, 19Koff A. Giordano A. Desai D. Yamashita K. Harper J.W. Elledge S. Nishimoto T. Morgan D.O. Franza B.R. Roberts J.M. Science. 1992; 257: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). The cyclin E-Cdk2 complex is a critical promoter of initiation of the S phase of the cell cycle. We have demonstrated here that WT1(−/−) binds to all three consensus binding sites in the cyclin E promoter, negatively regulates the promoter in transient transfection assays, and in intact cells, down-regulates cyclin E protein levels. These findings support the idea that cyclin E is a direct target of the transcriptional regulatory activity of WT1. This conclusion is strengthened by our finding that deleting the binding site from the 5′ untranslated region of exon 1 eliminates the ability of WT1 to repress the promoter in transient transfection assays. Deletion of the region surrounding this site clearly decreases the basal level of promoter activity substantially; nevertheless, there is still significant residual activity, which WT1(−/−) does not suppress. Our finding that WT1(−/−) directly suppresses cyclin E complements the published observation that induction of WT1(−/−) in Saos2 cells up-regulates the expression of p21WAF1/CIP1 (11Englert C. Maheswaran S. Garvin A.J. Kreidberg J. Haber D.A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1429-1434PubMed Google Scholar). Those studies were limited in that no evidence, such as promoter reporter assays or electrophoretic mobility shift assays, was presented to support the conclusion that WT1(−/−) directly affects the p21 promoter, leaving open the possibility that some other WT1 target is a p21 transcriptional activator. The present report, therefore, contains the first demonstration that the WT1(−/−) isoform is a direct transcriptional regulator of a key gene involved in cell cycle progression. Interestingly, in our 32D cl3 cells stably transfected with an inducible WT1(−/−) construct, we saw no evidence that induction of WT1(−/−) alters p21 expression (Fig. 1). There are two possible explanations for this observation. One possibility is that WT1 is not the direct transcriptional activator of p21. In this case, the WT1 target that mediates the up-regulation of p21 may not be expressed in hematopoietic cells. Alternatively, this may represent a cell type-specific effect of WT1 on the p21 promoter. There is precedence for this with bcl-2. In transient transfection assays, WT1(−/−) activates the bcl-2 promoter in Saos2 and CV-1 cells but represses the identical reporter construct in HeLa cells (12Mayo M.W. Wang C.Y. Drouin S.S. Madrid L.V. Marshall A.F. Reed J.C. Weissman B.E. Baldwin A.S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3990-4003Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Cyclin E and p21 are both key regulators of progression from G1 into S phase. Cyclin E is a positive regulator of this process, binding to and activating cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2). Activated Cdk2 phosphorylates Rb, which is necessary for progression from G1 into the S phase of the cell cycle (19Koff A. Giordano A. Desai D. Yamashita K. Harper J.W. Elledge S. Nishimoto T. Morgan D.O. Franza B.R. Roberts J.M. Science. 1992; 257: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). One of the roles of p21, on the other hand, is to inhibit the activity of Cdk2 (20Ball K.L. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1997; 3: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). There have been other reports in the literature suggesting that the G1/S phase transition is regulated, at least in part, by WT1 (21Kudoh T. Ishidate T. Moriyama M. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4517-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Evidence that WT1(−/−) up-regulates an inhibitor of G1/S progression (p21) and down-regulates a promoter of cell cycle progression (cyclin E) strongly suggests that inhibition of this point of the cell cycle is a critical role for WT1. How does the finding that WT1(−/−) is a negative regulator of cell cycle progression fit with a putative oncogenic role? WT1 is overexpressed in the majority of cases of acute leukemia (16Inoue K. Sugiyama H. Ogawa H. Nakagawa M. Yamagami T. Miwa H. Kita K. Hiraoka A. Masaoka T. Nasu K. Blood. 1994; 84: 3071-3079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and mutant forms of WT1 encoding nonsense mutations predicted to encode truncated proteins lacking the DNA binding domain have been cloned from the leukemic blasts of several patients (13King-Underwood L. Pritchard-Jones K. Blood. 1998; 91: 2961-2968Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar mutations have been identified in patients with Denys-Drash syndrome, and these mutants have dominant negative activity in vitro (8Kim J. Prawitt D. Bardeesy N. Torban E. Vicaner C. Goodyer P. Zabel B. Pelletier J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2289-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). WT1 functions as a dimer, and both homo- and heterodimers can form (15Reddy J.C. Morris J.C. Wang J. English M.A. Haber D.A. Shi Y. Licht J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10878-10884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In leukemias that overexpress wild type WT1, the most abundant isoform is WT1(+/+), which not only suppresses the cyclin E promoter poorly as a homodimer but also inhibits the ability of WT1(−/−) to repress this promoter (presumably through heterodimerization). Overexpression of this isoform could “derepress” cyclin E transcription, resulting in inappropriate overexpression of this target. In cases of acute myeloid leukemia involving a truncated WT1, this dominant negative form of the molecule should also inhibit the activity of full-length WT1(−/−) toward target promoters such as cyclin E through heterodimer formation. In fact, cyclin E is reported to be overexpressed in the majority of cases of acute myeloid leukemia (22Iida H. Towatari M. Tanimoto M. Morishita Y. Kodera Y. Saito H. Blood. 1997; 90: 3707-3713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that this may be a major mechanism contributing to leukemogenesis. Furthermore, we have found that induction of WT1(−/−) in the stably transfected cell line described in this paper potentiates granulocyte-colony stimulating factor-mediated differentiation,1 whereas another group reported that constitutive expression of WT1(+/+) in 32D cl3 cells interferes with differentiation (23Inoue K. Tamaki H. Ogawa H. Oka Y. Soma T. Tatekawa T. Oji Y. Tsuboi A. Kim E.H. Kawakami M. Akiyama T. Kishimoto T. Sugiyama H. Blood. 1998; 91: 2969-2976Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of cyclin E protein levels has recently been a prominent focus of cancer researchers. Cyclin E levels vary with the cell cycle, with low levels present in early G1, rising through G1 to peak at the G1/S transition, falling rapidly during early S phase, and remaining low through G2, M, and early G1 phases. This precise regulation of the protein is achieved by balancing transcription and proteasome-dependent degradation. Dysregulation of cyclin E is associated with premature entry into S phase, genomic instability, and tumorigenesis. An F-box protein, which mediates association with ubiquitin ligase, specific for cyclin E has recently been described (24Koepp D.M. Schaefer L.K., Ye, X. Keyomarsi K. Chu C. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 25Strohmaier H. Spruck C.H. Kaiser P. Won K.A. Sangfelt O. Reed S.I.

Nature. 2001; 413: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), and mutations in the gene encoding this protein, which would lead to elevated cyclin E levels, have been implicated in breast and ovarian cancer (25Strohmaier H. Spruck C.H. Kaiser P. Won K.A. Sangfelt O. Reed S.I. Nature. 2001; 413: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 26Moberg K.H. Bell D.W. Wahrer D.C. Haber D.A. Hariharan I.K. Nature. 2001; 413: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Our discovery that WT1(−/−) is a transcriptional repressor of cyclin E suggests a complementary mechanism by which cyclin E might be aberrantly overexpressed in tumors through derepression of the cyclin E promoter by either overexpression of the WT1(+/+) isoform or by expression of a dominant-negative WT1 mutant. Experiments to further define the interactions between the different isoforms of WT1 in regulating the cyclin E promoter are ongoing. WT1 has been implicated in a variety of solid tumors other than Wilms' tumor. For example, WT1, predominantly the (+/+) isoform, is overexpressed in a significant proportion of breast cancers (17Loeb D.M. Evron E. Patel C.B. Sharma P.M. Niranjan B. Buluwela L. Weitzman S.A. Korz D. Sukumar S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 921-925PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of this isoform to derepress the cyclin E promoter might be a contributory factor in mammary carcinogenesis. Whether cyclin E derepression is involved in other WT1-associated tumors such as malignant mesothelioma remains to be determined. We thank Dr. R. Weinberg for the cyclin E-luciferase plasmid and Dr. Alan Rein for critical reading of the manuscript."

Upon Ca2+binding, CaM undergoes a large conformational change exposing two hydrophobic patches that allow for target-protein interaction (7James P. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 38-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). CaM binding to its targets does not operate through a conserved motif, because CaM binding regions on target proteins show little sequence homology. Many Ca2+-dependent CaMBPs have one or more CaM-binding domains characterized by a basic amphipathic helix commonly with positively charged residues interspersed among hydrophobic and aromatic residues (7James P.

Despite their number and essential roles in a number of events, only a few CaMBPs have been characterized fully in Dictyostelium. Myosin heavy chain kinase, a Ca2+/CaM-dependent enzyme involved in myosin assembly, has been shown to be integral in cell motility (27Kolman M.F. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol.

Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 310-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Knockout mutants for α-actinin, a Ca2+/CaM-dependent CaMBP that binds actin, show defects in motility and orientation (29Rivero F. Koppel B. Peracino B. Bozzaro S. Siegart F. Weijer C. Schleicher M. Albrecht R. Noegel A.A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2679-2691PubMed Google Scholar). Knockout mutants for Dictyostelium IQGAP, a Ca2+-independent CaMBP, are unable to complete cytokinesis (30Adachi H. Takahashi Y. Hasebe T. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Sutoh K. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 891-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).Dictyostelium CN has been extensively characterized (31Dammann H.

FK506 and cyclosporin A do not inhibit growth or aggregation but do affect cell differentiation, yet the regulation and roles of Dictyostelium CN are still under analysis (34Horn F. Gross J. Differentiation. 1996; 60: 269-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Kessen U. Schaloske R. Aichem A. Mutzel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37821-37826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition to acting as CaM's effectors, CaMBPs bind different targets based upon cytosolic Ca2+ levels; they localize CaMs to subcellular locales and act as capacitators in CaM function (36Tsvetkov P.O. Protasevich I.I. Gilli R. Lafitte D. Lobachov V.M. Haiech J. Briand C. Makarov A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18161-18164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Until all of the CaMBPs have been revealed and their functions elucidated, any model of cellular processes involving Ca2+ and CaM will remain incomplete. Our approach has been to screen a λZAP cDNA expression library of cAMP-chemoresponsive cells from multicellular development using a recombinant CaM probe (35S-VU1-CaM) to isolate cDNAs encoding putative CaMBPs. This approach was validated when the first cDNA that we isolated and sequenced encoded calcineurin A (GenBankTM accession number U22397), the sole Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein phosphatase of eukaryotes. Similar approaches have been used to identify novel CaMBPs in plants, including maize pollen calmodulin-binding protein, and a tobacco plasma membrane calmodulin-binding channel protein (37Safadi F. Reddy V.S. Reddy A.S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35457-35470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 38Arazi T. Sunkar R. Kaplan B. Fromm H. Plant J. 1999; 20: 171-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report on the isolation of a 1119-bp cDNA encoding a novel, acidic, nuclear protein of 340 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 38.7 kDa that contains several nuclear localization sequences (NLS) plus an extensive, continuous 52-amino acid inverted repeat of glutamic and aspartic acid residues (DEED repeat). This region is characteristic of the conserved nucleoplasmin domain suggesting it is a member of the nucleoplasmin superfamily of nuclear proteins. We have named this gene numA fornucleomorphin. Southern blotting and PCR indicate that a single gene exists in the genome of D. discoideum. Binding assays using truncated fusion proteins show nucleomorphin to be a Ca2+-dependent CaM target protein that contains at least two CaM-binding domains. Nucleomorphin mRNA and protein are each expressed continuously throughout development. GFP-NumA localized specifically to several arc-like, heterochromatic regions along the periphery of the nucleus. GFP-NumA lacking the putative transmembrane domain and the DEED repeat still accumulated at the periphery of the nucleus; however, removal of the acidic region leads to an increase in multinuclearity. Together these data indicate that nucleomorphin is a nuclear calmodulin-binding protein and is related to nucleoplasmin, which may be involved in nuclear structure in Dictyostelium. All restriction enzymes used were purchased fromAmersham Biosciences, Inc. T4 DNA ligase and T4 polynucleotide kinase were purchased from New England BioLabs. All chemicals, including media reagents, were purchased from BioShop Canada, VWR Scientific Products, or Sigma-Aldrich. TRIzol RNA isolation reagent and low DNA mass ladders were purchased from Invitrogen. Expand High Fidelity PCR kit, High Pure PCR Template purification kit, DIG DNA Labeling and Detection kit, DIG Easy-Hyb, nylon membranes, PCR molecular weight markers, and DIG-labeled DNA and RNA molecular weight markers were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. PCR primers were purchased from Sigma-Genosys. Qiaex II Gel Extraction system was purchased from Qiagen. The pET21-b(+) vector was obtained from Novagen. Titration of bacteriophage and screening of the cDNA library were essentially carried out as described previously (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Variations in protocol were implemented with respect to the use of 35S-radiolabeled recombinant CaM as a probe. An overnight culture of an XL1-Blue strain of Escherichia coli in LB media containing 0.2% maltose was pelleted and resuspended in 10 mm MgSO4. Serial dilutions of bacteriophage ranging from 10−4 to 10−6 were prepared in SM buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mmMgSO4·7H2O, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.01% gelatin). Diluted phage was mixed 1:1 with XL1-Blue E. coli and incubated at 37 °C. Three milliliters of liquid LB top agarose was added and spread evenly over a 90-mm LB agar plate then incubated at 42 °C for 2 h. Nitrocellulose membranes were soaked in 10 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), dried, and placed over the surface of the agar plates, and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Membranes were removed from the plates, dried, and then washed in CaM-probing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 200 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.05% Tween 20). Membranes were blocked for 2–3 h in CaM-probing buffer with 3% BSA and 0.05% sodium azide added, then probed at room temperature for 3 h with 3 ml of recombinant 35S-VU1-CaM (3.6 × 105 to 9.0 × 105 cpm/ml) dissolved in CaM-probing buffer supplemented with 3% BSA and 0.05% sodium azide. The production of 35S-VU1-CaM is detailed elsewhere (40Lydan M. O'Day D.H. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 31: 389-396PubMed Google Scholar). The membranes were then washed with CaM-probing buffer four consecutive times for a period of 10 min each. Membranes were dried and exposed to autoradiography film (Kodak X-Omat AR Scientific Imaging film) for 1–2 days. Single plaques corresponding to positive signals on the autoradiography film were located and subjected to three successive screens before being referred to as cDNA inserts coding for putative calcium-dependent calmodulin-binding proteins. Excision of the pBluescript phagemid and infection of host bacterial cells was conducted according to the protocol provided with the ExAssist Interference-Resistant Helper Phage kit purchased from Stratagene. Plasmids were isolated from positive clones by way of alkali lysis (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and subjected to restriction analysis using StyI, Hin dIII, BstEII, and PstI. Clones with dissimilar restriction enzyme fragments were sequenced at the Core Molecular Biology Facility, York University. Sequences were compared with those in the GenBankTM Data base using BLAST (41Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70619) Google Scholar). Protein motifs were identified, and the predicted molecular weight and isoelectric point were determined from the deduced amino acid sequences using the programs PSORT, version 6.4 (42Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar), Prosite, and the ExPASy Molecular Biology Server (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics). D. discoideum AX3 was used as the wild type strain. Cells were cultured axenically in HL-5 at 22 °C. For development, spores were mixed with a suspension of E. coli B/r and spread onto SM plates incubated at room temperature for 40 h. Plates were flooded with lower pad solution (LPS), and the cells were transferred to 50-ml centrifuge tubes.Dictyostelium amoebae were washed free of bacteria with fresh LPS by repetitive centrifugation. Cells were suspended at a density of 1 × 108cells/ml in LPS, deposited evenly onto the surface of Millipore filters over LPS-saturated pads in 60-mm plastic Petri dishes and incubated in a humidity chamber. For the genomic Southern analysis, Dictyostelium nuclear DNA was isolated. Approximately 5 × 107cells were harvested by centrifugation. The cells were resuspended in 1 ml of Nuclei buffer, pH 7.6 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgOAc, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 5% sucrose). A volume of 0.2 ml of 20% Triton X-100 was added, mixed, and incubated on ice for 5 min. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 0.3 ml of Protease K buffer, pH 7.5 (100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K, and 1% SDS) and incubated for 2 h at 65 °C. Samples are extracted once with an equal volume of phenol-chloroform and again with chloroform-isoamyl alcohol. Sodium acetate was added to 0.3m, and the DNA was precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol. The DNA was resuspended in 1× TE supplemented with RNase A. DNA was digested using AseI, BglII,Hin dIII, and EcoRI, and 1 μg was electrophoresed on a 0.7% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DIG-labeled nucleomorphin cDNA was used as a probe. For Northern analysis, total RNA was isolated from both vegetative amoebas, and cells were developed for the indicated times. 30 μg of total RNA was size-fractionated on a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transferred to nylon membrane by capillary blotting (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Both Southern and Northern hybridization and detections were carried out using the DIG DNA labeling and detection kit according to the manufacturer's recommendation. PCR primers were designed to amplify the entire nucleomorphin open reading frame coding for amino acids 1 through 340. EcoRI and Hin dIII sites were added to the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, using the primers 38F-ER1 (5′-TGAATTCATGGATGTTCATTTAACATCAT-3′) and 38R-H3 (5′-TAATTTAAGCTTTTAATTTGAGGGTA-3′). Using the Expand High Fidelity PCR kit from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, PCR was performed in a GeneAmp PCR System 9600 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 25 cycles (each consisting of a denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, annealing at 50 °C for 2 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min). A single 1035-bp fragment was amplified. Prior to sub-cloning into pUC19, which had previously been digested with SmaI, the 5′-ends were phosphorylated using T4 polynucleotide kinase and then ligated to pUC19 using T4 DNA ligase and transformed into E. coli strain DH5α. The recombinant plasmid was purified and was designated pUC38. Digestion of pUC38 with EcoRI and Hin dIII liberated the 1035-bp fragment, which was agarose gel-purified using the Qiagen QIAEX II gel purification kit and ligated into pMALc-2 digested with EcoRI and Hin dIII and transformed into E. coli strain TB1. The recombinant plasmid was purified, sequenced, and designated pMAL-NumA. PCR primers were designed to amplify the region encoding amino acids 1 through 304. EcoRI and Hin dIII sites were added to the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, using the primers 38F-ER1 and 38TM-H3 (5′-AAGCTTACTTTAACTAGATTTGAGTGA-3′). PCR was performed as outlined above generating a single 926-bp fragment that was sub-cloned into pUC19 and pMAL as described, sequenced and named pMAL-NumAΔC36. PCR primers were designed to amplify the region encoding amino acids 1 through 180. EcoRI and Hin dIII sites were added to the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, using the primers 38F-ER1 and 38-CtBR (5′-AAGCTTTTACTTTCCTTTAATAAATCTTG-3′). PCR was performed as outlined above generating a single 551-bp fragment and was subcloned into pUC19 and pMAL as described, sequenced, and named pMAL-NumAΔC160. PCR primers were designed to amplify the region encoding amino acids 1 through 122. EcoRI and Hin dIII sites were added to the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, using primers 38F-ER1 and 38-Nt (5′-AAGCTTCTATTAATCATCATATTTATAC-3′). PCR was performed as outlined above producing a single fragment of 380 bp that was subcloned into pUC19 and pMAL as described, sequenced, and named pMAL-NumAΔC218. PCR primers were designed to amplify the region encoding amino acids 166 through 304. EcoRI and Hin dIII sites were added to the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, using the primers 38-Ct (5′-GAATTCGATTTTGATAGTGATG-3′) and 38TM-H3. PCR was performed and generated a single 437-bp fragment that was sub-cloned into pUC19 and pMAL as described, sequenced, and named pMAL-NumAΔN165. PCR primers were designed to amplify the entire nucleomorphin open reading frame coding for amino acids 1 through 340. To facilitate cloning into pTX-GFP, a SacI site was added to the forward primer (5′-AGAGCTCATGGATGTTCATTTAACATCATCGACATC-3′), and an XhoI site (5′-ACTCGAGTTAATTTGAGGGTAAAGACATAAAAAATGCACT-3′) to the reverse primer. PCR was performed and generated a single 1043-bp fragment that was sub-cloned into pUC19 and pTX-GFP as described, sequenced, and named pGFP-NumA. Removal of residues 118–167 is described below. PCR was performed as outlined for pGFP-NumA. The 905-bp fragment was then cloned into pTX-GFP as described, sequenced, and named pGFP-NumAΔ118–167. Removal of residues 305–340 is described above. PCR was performed as outlined for pGFP-NumA with the exception of the reverse primer. This primer incorporates an XhoI site to (5′-ACTCGAGACTTTAACTAGATTTGAGTGA-3′) facilitate cloning into pTX-GFP. The 926-bp fragment was cloned into pTX-GFP, sequenced, and named pGFP-NumAΔC36. ΔN and ΔC indicate amino- and carboxyl-terminal mutants, and the numbers specify the number of amino acids deleted from the respective end. To express nucleomorphin maximally we used the PCR to remove 46 amino acids between residues 118 and 167. Using the same forward primer for the GFP construct and a mutagenic reverse primer designated mut38N (5′-ATCATCCCATGGATACTCGTTTAATTTGATTGATCT-3′) with a restriction site for NcoI, we amplified a 377-bp fragment, treated the ends with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIAP) (New England BioLabs) and digested it with the enzyme NcoI. A second primer pair consisted of the reverse GFP primer and a mutagenic forward primer designated mut38C (5′-GATGAACCATGGTTTGATAGTGATGAAGATGTTTCA-3′) that contained a restriction site for NcoI. The PCR amplified a 548-bp fragment that was treated with CIAP and digested with the enzyme NcoI. The digested PCR products were purified using the High Pure PCR purification kit, and the fragments were ligated using T4 DNA ligase. The PCR was then used to amplify the desired ligation product using the forward and reverse primers described above in the construction of pGFP-NumA. A single 905-bp fragment was amplified, subcloned into pUC19 and pET21-b(+), and named pETNumAΔ118–167. E. coli strain TB1 expressed only pMAL-NumAΔN165 and pMAL-NumAΔC218 to any detectable levels, and both were purified by maltose affinity chromatography as described by the manufacturer. Each fusion protein was of the expected size viewed on SDS-PAGE (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Four rabbits were each initially immunized with 750 μg of purified recombinant MBP- NumAΔC218. Boosts of 400 μg of purified protein were performed at 3-week intervals, and two rabbits were exsanguinated 11 days after the third boost. Antibodies were affinity purified before use as described previously (43Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Developmental cells were harvested from filters at the various developmental time points indicated, washed in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, solubilized with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and heated to 100 °C for 5 min. Total protein content was measured spectrophotometrically using the Bio-Rad protein dye assay. 20 μg of protein per lane was resolved using 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a PVDF membrane, and blocked overnight in 5% nonfat dry milk in TTBS (20 mmTris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.05% sodium azide). Membranes were incubated with purified primary antibodies directed against NumAΔC218 at a dilution of 1:100 at 37 °C for 1 h. Blots were washed with agitation for 90 min, changing the wash buffer every 10 min. Bound antibody was detected with the ECL Western blotting kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) using HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit-IgG exposed to autoradiography film (1:20,000) (Kodak, USA). Purified fusion proteins MBP-NumAΔC218 and MBP-NumAΔN165 were resolved using 10% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gels were fixed for 30 min in methanol/acetic acid (40%/7%) followed by rinsing with distilled water. Gels were washed overnight in 10% ethanol. Gels were rinsed in 10% ethanol, followed by 100 mm imidazole (pH 7.0), for 30 min; 20 mm imidazole (pH 7.0), for 15 min; and a final incubation with probe buffer (200 mm KCl, 0.1% BSA, and 1 mm CaCl2) for 15 min. For Ca2+-independent assays, 2 mm EGTA is substituted for the 1 mm CaCl2 in the probe buffer. Gels were incubated"
https://openalex.org/W2161895641,"In the heart, in situ local myocardial blood flow (MBF) varies greater than 10-fold between individual areas and displays a spatially heterogeneous pattern. To analyze its molecular basis, we analyzed protein expression of low and high flow samples (300 mg, <50% or >150% of mean MBF, each n=30) of six beagle dogs by 2-D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (380 +/- 78 spots/gel). In low flow samples, dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH1) was increased greatly (+377%, compared with high flow samples). This increase resulted in a 75% reduction of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), the potent endogenous inhibitor of NO synthase, whereas eNOS showed no difference. Low flow samples exhibited enhanced expression of GAPDH (+89%) and phosphoglycerate kinase (+100%), whereas hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, electron transfer flavoprotein, myoglobin, and desmin were decreased. Assessing local MBF on different days within 2 weeks revealed a high degree of MBF stability (r2 > 0.79). Thus, stable differences in local MBF are associated with significant differences in local gene and protein expression. In low flow areas, the increased DDAH1 reduces ADMA concentration and NOS inhibition, which strongly suggests enhanced NO formation. Low flow areas are also characterized by a higher glycolytic and a lower fatty acid oxidation capacity. Both the shift in substrate utilization and the rise in NO may contribute to the known lower oxygen consumption in these areas."
https://openalex.org/W1985649534,"The brain renin-angiotensin system (bRAS) is involved in the control of hydromineral balance. However, little information is available on the functional regulation of the bRAS as a consequence of sodium deficit in the extracellular fluid compartments. We used a pharmacological model of acute Na+ depletion (furosemide injections) to investigate changes of a major component of the bRAS, the hypothalamic angiotensin type 1A (AT(1A)) receptors. Furosemide induced a rapid and long-lasting expression of the AT(1A) mRNA in the subfornical organ, the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO), and the parvocellular division of the paraventricular nucleus (pPVN). Na+ depletion increased the number of cells expressing AT(1A) mRNA in the pPVN, but not in the MnPO. The enhancement of AT(1A) mRNA expression was associated with an increase in AT(1) binding sites in all the regions studied. It is of interest that in the paraventricular nucleus, the majority of the neurons expressing AT(1A) mRNA also showed an increase in metabolic activity (Fos-related antigen immunoreactivity [FRA-ir]). By contrast, in the MnPO, we observe two distinct cell populations. Our data demonstrated that an acute Na+ deficit induced a functional regulation of the hypothalamic AT(1A) receptors, indicating that these receptors are subject to plasticity in response to hydromineral perturbations."
https://openalex.org/W2020704819,"Oncogenic rearrangements of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene, encoding a receptor type tyrosine kinase, are frequently associated with anaplastic large cell lymphomas. Such rearrangements juxtapose the intracellular domain of ALK to 5′-end sequences belonging to different genes and create transforming fusion proteins. To understand how the oncogenic versions of ALK contribute to lymphomagenesis, it is important to analyze the biological effects and the biochemical properties of this receptor under controlled conditions of activation. To this aim, we constructed chimeric receptor molecules in which the extracellular domain of the ALK kinase is replaced by the extracellular, ligand-binding domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Upon transfection in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, the EGFR/ALK chimera was correctly synthesized and transported to the cell surface, where it was fully functional in forming high versus low affinity EGF-binding sites and transducing an EGF-dependent signal intracellularly. Overexpression of the EGFR/ALK chimera in NIH 3T3 was sufficient to induce the malignant phenotype; the appearance of the transformed phenotype was, however, conditionally dependent on the administration of EGF. Moreover, the EGFR/ALK chimera was significantly more active in inducing transformation and DNA synthesis than the wild type EGFR when either was expressed at similar levels in NIH 3T3 cells. Comparative analysis of the biochemical pathways implicated in the transduction of mitogenic signals did not show any increased ability of the EGFR/ALK to phosphorylate PLC-γ and MAPK compared with the EGFR. On the contrary, EGFR/ALK showed to have a consistently greater effect on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity compared with the EGFR, indicating that this enzyme plays a major role in mediating the mitogenic effects of ALK in NIH 3T3 cells.

Over half of these lymphomas are characterized by the chromosomal translocation t(2;5)(p23;q35) that results in the production of an 80-kDa chimeric protein in which the N-terminal region of the nuclear protein nucleophosmin (NPM) (9Borer R.A.

Valentine M.B. Dittmer K.G. Shapiro D.N. Saltman D.L. Look A.T. Science. 1994; 263: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar). Similarly to other genes responsible for activating receptor tyrosine kinase oncogenes, NPM is constitutively expressed in all tissues and activates the catalytic domain of ALK through dimerization (11Bishof D.

ALK is not expressed in normal hematopoietic cells; ectopic expression of the truncated ALK protein in lymphoid cells, as a result of the t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation, is more than coincidental and solidly linked to a mechanistic role for this gene in transformation. Interestingly, several other oncogenic rearrangements of ALK have been recently identified in ALCLs, suggesting multiple mechanisms for ALK activation in lymphomagenesis. Molecular characterization of such alternative chromosomal translocations have identified the nonmuscle tropomyosin gene, the TRK-fused gene, the 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase/IMP cyclohydrolase (ATIC) gene, the clathrin chain polypeptide-like gene, and the moesin gene as variant fusion partners with the ALK gene (14Lamant L.

In addition, somatic rearrangements of ALK, generating ALK fusion oncoproteins, have been detected with a high frequency in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (20Morris S.W. Br. J. Haematol. 2001; 113: 275-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar); these data, together with the observation that ALK is expressed in a significant portion of human cancer cell lines (3Stoica G.E. Kuo A. Aigner A. Sunitha I. Souttou B. Malerczyk C. Caughey D.J. Wen D. Karavanov A. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16772-16779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), suggest a potentially wider role for ALK product in the genesis of neoplastic processes. Very little is known about the physiological role of ALK or how its subversion might contribute to the malignant transformation. In PC12 cells, activation of a chimeric receptor possessing the intracellular domain of ALK induces neurite extensions, suggesting a role in the transduction of differentiative signals (21Souttou B. Brunet-De Carvalho N. Raulais D. Vigny M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9526-9531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The possibility that ALK is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation is suggested by the observation that adoptive expression of either NPM/ALK or ATIC/ALK in an interleukin-3-dependent murine pro-B lymphocyte cell line is sufficient to bypass the events normally regulating cell division, causing sustained proliferation in the absence of interleukin-3 (17Ma Z. Cools J. Marynen P. Cui X. Sieberrt R. Gesk S. Schlegelberger B. Peeters B., De Wolfe-Peeters C. Wlodarska I. Morris S.W. Blood. 2000; 95: 2144-2149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Bai R.Y. Dieter P. Pescel C. Morris S.W. Duyster J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6951-6961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the recent identification of PTN as the ligand for ALK has clearly proved the ability of this receptor to deliver mitogenic signals inside the cells. In contrast to the situation for most of the receptor tyrosine kinases, the biochemical events involved in the signal transduction triggered by normal ALK are largely unknown, except for some evidence deriving from studies of ALK oncogenes (11Bishof D. Puldorf K. Mason D.Y. Morris S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2312-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 12Fujimoto J. Shiota M. Iwahara T. Seki N. Satoh H. Mori S. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl.

This line of investigations, relevant for the comprehension of the molecular basis of ALK-associated diseases, has been so far hampered by the lack of a known ligand for the alk proto-oncogene. A strategy to circumvent this problem derives from the engineering of chimeric molecules containing the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the intracellular region of ALK. Such an approach has been successfully used to analyze the signaling properties of ligand-orphan receptors and the structure-function of several receptor tyrosine kinases (25Riedel H. Dull T.J. Honneger A.M. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2943-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 26Fazioli F. Kim U.-H. Rhee S.G. Molloy C.J. Segatto O. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell.

We have therefore engineered a chimeric EGFR/ALK molecule to study ALK biological and biochemical activities in a fibroblast target cell. We demonstrate that overexpression of such a chimera is associated with a ligand-dependent expression of the transformed phenotype. In addition, the EGFR/ALK chimera was significantly more efficient at inducing cell transformation and DNA synthesis than the wild-type EGFR when activated by EGF. Comparative analysis of the biochemical pathways implicated in the transduction of mitogenic signals did not show any increased ability of the EGFR/ALK to phosphorylate PLC-γ and MAPK compared with the EGFR. On the contrary, EGFR/ALK was much more efficient than EGFR at inducing PI3-K activity; the up-regulation of PI3-K activity following activation of ALK can explain, at least in part, the stronger mitogenic potency of ALK in NIH 3T3 cells. The EGFR/ALK expression vector was engineered starting from a previously described modified version of the long terminal repeat (LTR)-EGFR 5M vector in which a novel SalI site was generated in the sequence of the EGFR cDNA immediately following the transmembrane region (32Lonardo F., Di Marco E. King C.R. Pierce J. Segatto O. Aaronson S.A. Di Fiore P.P. New Biol. 1990; 2: 992-1003PubMed Google Scholar). TheSalI site and a unique MluI site located in the LTR vector downstream of the natural stop codon of the EGFR cDNA were used for the recombination. To obtain the EGFR/ALK chimera, we initially amplified, by recombinant PCR, the entire intracellular domain of ALK in the region corresponding to amino acids 1058–1620 (numbered as specified by Morris et al. (1Morris S.W. Naeve C. Mathew P. James P.L. Kirstein M.N. Cui X. Witte D.P. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2175-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar)). Amplification was carried out with primers designed to introduce an in-frameSalI site at the 5′-end of the amplified sequence and anMluI site at its 3′-end. The sequences of the primers used were TATCGTCGACTGTACCGCCGGAAGCAC (5′ primer) and ATACGCGTCAGGGCCCAGGCTGGTT (3′ primer). After digestion withSalI and MluI, the PCR-amplified sequence was ligated to the 10.4-kb SalI–MluI fragment from the LTR-EGFR 5M, containing the EGFR cDNA depleted of the sequence encoding for its intracellular domain. This recombination procedure generates a modification of the ALK sequence corresponding to codon 1058. To restore the proper amino acid sequence of the intracellular portion of ALK, oligonucleotide-primed site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the method of Kunkel (33Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4897) Google Scholar) using a commercially available kit (Bio-Rad). Single-stranded DNA template was generated by subcloning a BamHI–BamHI fragment from the LTR-EGFR/ALK vector into M13mp18. After modification of the desired sequence, the BamHI–BamHI fragment was cloned back into the vector. The resulting LTR-EGFR/ALK expression vector is predicted to encode a protein containing the entire extracellular and transmembrane domains of the EGFR joined to the intracellular domain of ALK. The LTR-NPM/ALK expression vector was obtained by cloning the open reading frame of pcDNA3-NPM/ALK (a kind gift of Prof. P. G. Pelicci, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy) into the LTR-2 expression vector (34Di Fiore P.P. Pierce J.H. Kraus M.H. Segatto O. King C.R. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1987; 237: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Recombinant PCR was used to amplify the entire NPM/ALK sequence (7Morris S.W. Kirsten M.N. Valentine M.B. Dittmer K.G. Shapiro D.N. Saltman D.L. Look A.T. Science. 1994; 263: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1952) Google Scholar) using primers designed to yield the NPM/ALK cDNA flanked by unique XhoI and MluI sites, at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the PCR product, respectively. The sequence of the primers used were GGAAGATCTATGGAAGATTCGATGGACATG (5′ primer) and ATACGCGTCAGGGCCCAGGCTGGTT (3′ primer). After digestion withXhoI and MluI, the PCR-amplified fragment was cloned between the homologous sites of the LTR-2 vector. This recombination yielded to the LTR-NPM/ALK expression vector. The EGFR/ALK and NPM/ALK expression vectors were sequenced in both strands of the regions that underwent genetic manipulations to verify that the predicted structures were achieved after the recombination procedure. NIH 3T3 and NR6 mouse fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen) and transfected with circular DNA according to the calcium phosphate precipitation technique (35Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6489) Google Scholar) as modified by Wigler et al.(36Wigler M. Silverstein S. Lee L.S. Pellicer A. Cheng Y.-C. Axel R. Cell. 1977; 11: 223-232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Transformed foci were scored at 2–3 weeks. Where indicated, EGF (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) (20 ng/ml) was added at day 14, and foci were scored at day 21. Transforming efficiency was calculated in focus-forming units/pmol of added DNA (FFU/pmol) after correction for the relative molecular weight of the respective plasmid and normalization for the efficiency of colony formation in parallel dishes subjected to selection in mycophenolic acid-containing medium. The expression vectors used in the transfection experiments were LTR-EGFR/ALK (described above), LTR-EGFR 5M (32Lonardo F., Di Marco E. King C.R. Pierce J. Segatto O. Aaronson S.A. Di Fiore P.P. New Biol. 1990; 2: 992-1003PubMed Google Scholar) and LTR-NPM/ALK (described above). All of the vectors contained the eukaryotic resistance marker Escherichia coli gpt. Cells expressing theE. coli gpt gene were selected for their ability to grow in the presence of mycophenolic acid (37Mulligan R.C. Berg P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2072-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). The 3H incorporation assay was performed as described previously (26Fazioli F. Kim U.-H. Rhee S.G. Molloy C.J. Segatto O. Di Fiore P.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2040-2048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, NIH 3T3 transfectants, grown to confluence in 24-well poly–l–lysine-treated plates (Costar), were serum-starved for 72 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing transferrin (5 μg/ml) (Becton Dickinson) and Na2SeO3 (10−8m) and then stimulated for 22 h with either 1% (v/v) FBS or EGF at the indicated concentrations in the presence of 4 μCi/well of [methyl-3H]thymidine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Background was measured in parallel assays in which cells were treated with [methyl-3H]thymidine in the absence of mitogens. Trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity was extracted and determined by scintillation in a Beckman β-counter. Data are expressed as a mitogenic index calculated as the fraction of stimulation obtained in the presence of EGF with respect to the stimulation obtained in the presence of nonsaturating concentrations of an optimal mitogen (1% FBS). The mitogenic index was calculated as follows: ((EGF cpm − background cpm)/(1% serum cpm − background cpm)) × 100. When appropriate, 100 nm wortmannin (Sigma) was added to the serum-starved cells 1 h before the addition of EGF and maintained at the same concentration throughout the experiments. Stock solution of the inhibitor was prepared in Me2SO and diluted so that the final concentration of Me2SO in culture medium never exceeded 0.02%. Single cell suspensions from NIH 3T3 transfectants were plated at 10-fold serial dilutions in semisolid medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.5% sea plaque agarose (FMC BioProducts). Visible colonies comprising >100 cells were scored at 14 days. Where indicated, EGF was added at a concentration of 20 ng/ml. Cells grown to subconfluence in poly-l-lysine-coated dishes were incubated overnight in serum-free medium supplemented with transferrin (5 μg/ml) and Na2SeO3 (10−8m) and then exposed to growth factors at the indicated concentrations for the indicated lengths of time at 37 °C (see figure legends). Lysis was performed in a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 mm NaPPi. For immunoprecipitation procedures, cellular lysates were incubated with appropriate concentrations of antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C under gentle rotation, and immunocomplexes were recovered by adsorption to protein G bound to Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After several washes with buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm HEPES, 10% glycerol, and 150 mm NaCl, SDS-PAGE sample buffer (30% glycerol, 5% SDS, 0.1 m Tris, pH 6.8, 8% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) was added, and samples were boiled for 5 min. Lysates or immunoprecipitated proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. For Western blotting procedures, filters were incubated for 2 h at 42 °C with TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA). Filters were then incubated with a primary antibody at adequate dilutions in TBS containing 0.5% BSA for 2 h at room temperature. Blots were then extensively washed in TTBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and then immunodetected either with 125I-protein A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (0.2 μCi/ml) or with 125I-labeled anti-mouse–IgG (0.2 μCi/ml) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in TBS containing 0.5% BSA. In some experiments, filters were incubated with biotin-labeled GST or GST fusion protein (5 × 10−8m) in TBS containing 0.5% BSA for 2 h at room temperature. Filters were then extensively washed in TTBS and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-neutravidin (Pierce) at 0.025 μg/ml and then subjected to ECL reaction (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's directions. The monoclonal antibody recognizing the intracellular domain of ALK (ALKc) was kindly provided by Prof. B. Falini (Institute of Hematology, University of Perugia, Italy) and Prof. P. G. Pelicci (European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy) and was previously described (38Falini B. Bigerna B. Fizzotti M. Pulford K. Pileri S.A. Delsol G. Carbone A. Paulli M. Magrini U. Menestrina F. Giardini R. Pilotti S. Mezzelani A. Ugolini B. Billi M. Pucciarini A. Pacini R. Pelicci P.G. Flenghi L. Am. J.

Ab-1, the monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain of EGFR, was purchased from Calbiochem. The rabbit anti-peptide polyclonal serum recognizing the EGFR carboxyl-terminal tail (residues 985–996) was previously described (39Di Fiore P.P. Segatto O. Wexler D Fazioli F. Pierce J.H. Aaronson S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2749-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A commercially available anti-phosphotyrosine (anti-Tyr(P)) monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) was also used. Other antibodies used were anti-PLC-γ (mixture of six monoclonal antibodies) and anti-mitogen-activated protein kinase (anti-MAPK), both available from Upstate Biotechnology. For some experiments, we used the anti-phospho-MAPK polyclonal antibody, which specifically detects phospho-p44/p42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) (New England Biolabs, Inc.). For Scatchard analysis, 105cells/well were seeded in 24 poly-l-lysine-treated tissue culture plates (Costar). The day after, culture medium was replaced with binding medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 0.2% BSA). After 2 h of incubation at 37 °C, cells were shifted to 4 °C and incubated with 125I-EGF over a range of concentrations from 0.016 to 16 nm for at least 4 h at 4 °C. Assays were performed in triplicate wells, and specificity of binding was determined by parallel experiments in which a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled EGF was used to compete with the tracer. After incubation with EGF, cells were washed six times with ice-cold binding medium and solubilized with 10 nm NaOH, 1% SDS. Radioactivity was measured in a Packard γ-counter. The number of receptors per cell and their dissociation constants (K d ) for EGF were determined from Scatchard plots. Analysis of the binding was performed with the LIGAND software. For measuring receptor-associated PI3-K activity in vivo, quiescent transfectants were mock–treated or exposed for 10 min to EGF (100 ng/ml) or PDGF-BB (Upstate Biotechnology) (100 ng/ml) at 37 °C and instantly lysed in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (see above). Immunoprecipitation of total cellular protein was then carried out with the anti-Tyr(P) antibody. Following three washes with 1% Nonidet P-40 (Nonidet P-40) in phosphate-buffered saline, two washes with 0.5 m LiCl in 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.6, and two washes with TNE (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA pH 8.0), immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 40 μl of reaction buffer (25 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA) and monitored for PI3-K activity by their ability to phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol (Sigma) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (30 μCi/sample) (Amersham Biosciences), 5 mm MgCl2, and 30 μm ATP, which specifically inhibits phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase activity (40Whitman M. Kaplan D.R. Roberts T. Cantley L. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 15 min at room temperature and was stopped with 100 μl of HCl 1 n. Following organic solvent extraction, the chloroform phase was quantitatively subjected to thin layer chromatography analysis. The pGEX-Grb2 and pGEX-Grb-2/SH2 vectors were kindly provided by Prof. P. G. Pelicci and have been previously described (41Lanfrancone L. Pelicci G. Brizzi M.F. Arouica M.G. Casciari G. Giuli S. Pegoraro L. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 907-917PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of GST and GST fusion proteins was induced in log phase growing bacteria upon treatment with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. Bacteria were recovered by centrifugation, resuspended in 1100volume lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mg/ml lysozyme, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 μg/ml aprotinin), and lysed on ice by sonication. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 8000 rpm in a Sorvall SS34 rotor. The resulting supernatant was incubated with glutathione-agarose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotation. The resin was washed with excess PBS and then incubated with 20 mm glutathione (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature to elute GST proteins. Eluted proteins were then conjugated with biotin as described (42Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 341Google Scholar). To test the biological and biochemical activity of the ALK kinase under conditions of controlled ligand–induced activation, we engineered an EGFR/ALK chimeric molecule possessing the extracellular and transmembrane domain of EGFR and the intracellular portion of ALK (see “Materials and Methods” and Fig.1). The EGFR/ALK recombinant molecule was placed under the transcriptional control of the Moloney murine leukemia virus LTR promoter into the LTR–2 expression vector (34Di Fiore P.P. Pierce J.H.

To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying these multiple functions, we searched for KGF- regulated genes in keratinocytes. Using the differential display reverse transcriptase-PCR technology, we identified the gene encoding the estrogen-responsive B box protein (EBBP) which has as yet not been functionally characterized. The full-length murine and human EBBP cDNAs were cloned and fully sequenced. They were shown to encode 75-kDa proteins, which are mainly localized in the cytoplasm of keratinocytes in vitro and in vivo. In vivo, EBBP was found at high levels in the KGF- and epidermal growth factor-responsive basal keratinocytes of human skin, but the expression was down-regulated in the hyperthickened epithelium of skin wounds. Stable overexpression of EBBP in HaCaT keratinocytes did not affect the proliferation rate of the transfected cells, but enhanced the early differentiation process. These results suggest that the presence of EBBP in basal keratinocytes is important for the differentiation capacity of these cells, and that down-regulation of EBBP expression in a hyperproliferative epithelium is required to maintain the cells in a non-differentiated stage.

The epidermis forms the protective cover of the body surface. It is a multilayered renewal tissue composed mainly of keratinocytes. Terminally differentiated and dead cells are continuously lost from its surface and replaced by cells originating from the basal layer. Under normal conditions only cells touching on the basement membrane are able to proliferate (1Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2807-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Transient hyperproliferation of keratinocytes occurs at the wound margins after skin injury (2Martin P. Science. 1997; 276: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar), and permanent, uncontrolled hyperproliferation, together with abnormal differentiation of keratinocytes is a characteristic feature of major human skin diseases, such as psoriasis and epidermal cancers (3Carter D.M.

Fitzpatrick T.B. Eisen A.Z. Wolff K. Freedberg I.M. Austen K.F. Dermatology in General Medicine. 3rd Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1987: 461-491Google Scholar). Therefore, the balance between proliferation and differentiation must be tightly regulated. Cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, as well as soluble factors such as hormones and growth factors are involved in this process, but the intracellular effectors have only partially been identified. To identify novel regulators of keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, we searched for genes that are regulated by keratinocyte growth factor (KGF). 1The abbreviations used are: KGFkeratinocyte growth factorFGFfibroblast growth factorDDRT-PCRdifferential display RT-PCRFCSfetal calf serumEGFepidermal growth factorHAhemagglutininRBCCRING finger-B box-coiled coilTRIMtripartite motif1The abbreviations used are: KGFkeratinocyte growth factorFGFfibroblast growth factorDDRT-PCRdifferential display RT-PCRFCSfetal calf serumEGFepidermal growth factorHAhemagglutininRBCCRING finger-B box-coiled coilTRIMtripartite motif KGF (fibroblast growth factor 7, FGF-7) is a member of the FGF family, which is predominantly expressed by mesenchymal cells, but not by epithelial cells (5Rubin J.S.

It acts in a paracrine manner by binding to its receptor, a splice variant of FGF receptor 2 that is expressed by different types of epithelial cells, including keratinocytes of the skin (6Miki T. Bottaro D.P. Fleming T.P. Smith C.L. Burgess W.H. Chan A.M. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). This ligand-receptor interaction has been implicated in morphogenetic processes of epithelial tissues and in cell survival under stress conditions (7Werner S. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1998; 9: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar).

Nevertheless, it also induces the expression of differentiation–specific proteins in response to an increase in the extracellular Ca2+ concentration, and it has been suggested that KGF plays a crucial role in the initiation of the early differentiation program (14Marchese C.

To gain insight into the changes in gene expression after binding of KGF to its receptor, we performed differential display RT-PCR (DDRT-PCR) with RNAs from quiescent and KGF-stimulated HaCaT keratinocytes. By this method we identified the ebbp gene as a target of KGF action. The latter was originally identified as a gene, which is regulated by estrogen and tamoxifen in human mammary epithelial cells stably expressing an estrogen receptor mutant (16Liu H.-L. C. Golder-Novoselsky E. Seto M.H. Webster L. McClary J. Zajchowski D.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1733-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues, but the function of the encoded protein is completely unknown. In the present study, we have characterized the EBBP protein, and we demonstrate a novel role of EBBP in the regulation of keratinocyte differentiation. HaCaT keratinocytes (17Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3395) Google Scholar) were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma, Munich, Germany) containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Amimed, Allschwil, Switzerland). They were rendered quiescent by serum starvation for 16 to 24 h, and subsequently treated with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 ng/ml KGF, 10 ng/ml fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF-10), 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), 1 ng/ml transforming growth factor-β1, 100 units/ml interleukin-1β, 300 units/ml tumor necrosis factor-α, or 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), respectively. Cells were harvested at different time points after growth factor or serum stimulation and used for RNA isolation or for preparation of protein lysates. Growth factors and cytokines were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany) or R&D Systems (Abingdon, UK). For transient and stable transfection the LipofectAMINE 2000 Reagent was used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen, Basel, Switzerland). For the generation of stable cell lines HaCaT cells were co-transfected with an expression plasmid that contains the EBBP cDNA under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter together with a plasmid that confers resistance to geneticin (G418). After removal of the transfection mixture cells were trypsinized, re-seeded at lower cell density, and incubated in medium containing 400 mg/liter G418 (Invitrogen) until most of the cells had died and resistant colonies had appeared. The latter were isolated, expanded, and analyzed for the expression of EBBP by Western blotting. Transfected cells were cultured in G418-containing medium for at least 10 passages until used for experiments. Preparation of total cell lysates was performed as described previously (18Wakita H. Takigawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37285-37291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and protein concentrations were determined using the BCA kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Isolation of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins was performed by hypotonic lysis followed by high salt extraction of nuclei (19Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8–12%) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies followed by alkaline phosphatase- or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Antibody-binding proteins were detected with the nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Promega, Madison, WI) or enhanced chemoluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences) detection systems, respectively. The following antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against keratin 10 (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), involucrin (NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA), p53 (Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA), β-actin (Sigma), or the influenza virus hemagglutinin epitope (HA; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), a goat polyclonal antibody against RB (Santa Cruz) and rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against keratin 6 (Babco, Richmond, CA), and against the peptide CKGIDRKGEERNS, corresponding to amino acids 446–458 (Fig. 2 B) EBBP. This peptide is fully conserved in the murine protein. The EBBP antibody was generated and affinity purified by Eurogentec Bel S.A. (Seraing, Belgium). All secondary antibodies for Western blots were from Promega.Figure 2Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of murine EBBP.

Cells or tissue sections were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin, followed by the secondary antibody diluted in 12% bovine serum albumin. The latter were either anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma) or anti-rabbit IgG-Cy3TM (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Isolation of total cellular RNA and RNase protection assays were performed as described (7Werner S. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1998; 9: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 20Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). The following cDNA fragments were used as templates: a fragment corresponding to nucleotides 361–624 of the coding region of the human EBBP cDNA (GenBankTM AF096870), a fragment corresponding to part of the coding region of the murine EBBP cDNA (nucleotides 84–377), a 120-bp fragment corresponding to nucleotides 566–685 of the mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA (GenBankTM M32599), and a 116-bp fragment corresponding to nucleotides 580–695 of the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA (GenBankTM BC 001601). DDRT-PCR was carried out as previously described (21Frank S. Werner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24337-24340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The radioactive band was isolated from the gel, eluted in water, and after dilution, reamplified and cloned. The DDRT-PCR cDNA fragment was used to screen a cDNA library from KGF-stimulated HaCaT keratinocytes (21Frank S. Werner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24337-24340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). 19 positive plaques were recovered from the bacterial dishes, replated, and used for a further round of hybridization. Positive phage plaques were used for an in vivo excision reaction of the pBluescript SK(−) phagemid from the Uni-ZAP vector (according to Stratagene). The rescued phagemids were then used to transform Escherichia coli SOLR and preparations of the plasmids were used for subsequent restriction analysis. The longest cDNAs were fully sequenced in both orientations. For the cloning of the murine cDNA a probe from the coding region of human EBBP was used to screen a mouse skin wound cDNA library (22Madlener M. Werner S. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 202: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Normal human skin was obtained from skin transplants of patients attending the Dermatology Department of the University of Cologne for surgery (n = 6, aged 31–79 years). All samples included the dermis and the epidermis. The biopsies were immediately frozen in tissue freezing medium. All patients signed informed consent for the Department of Dermatology, University of Cologne, approved by the Institutional Commission of Ethics (Az. 9645/96). Two independent wound-healing experiments were performed. For each experiment, 24 BALB/c mice (8–12 weeks of age) were anaesthetized with a single intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine. The hair on the back of the animal was shaved, and the skin was wiped with 70% ethanol. Four full-thickness excisional wounds (4 mm diameter, 3–4 mm apart) were generated on the back of each animal by excising skin and panniculus carnosus. The excised skin served as a control. The wounds were allowed to dry to form a scab. At different time points after injury (1–14 days), animals were sacrificed, and the complete wounds including 2 mm of the margins were isolated. At each time point, the tissue from 4 animals was combined, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and used for RNA isolation or for preparation of protein lysates. For immunohistochemistry, wounds were isolated as described above, bisected, fixed in 95% ethanol, 1% acetic acid, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned. To identify novel KGF-regulated genes in keratinocytes, we used the immortalized, but non-transformed HaCaT cell line, which has been shown to respond to this growth factor (21Frank S. Werner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24337-24340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These cells were grown to confluence, serum-starved overnight, and subsequently stimulated with KGF. Total cellular RNA was isolated 5 and 8 h after KGF addition, and used for DDRT-PCR (21Frank S. Werner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24337-24340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A fragment was amplified predominantly from the control cDNA and to a much lesser extent from cDNAs of KGF-stimulated cells. This fragment was isolated from the gel, re-amplified by PCR, and cloned. Sequencing revealed that the fragment corresponds to part of the 3′ end of the untranslated region of the gene encoding EBBP (16Liu H.-L. C. Golder-Novoselsky E. Seto M.H. Webster L. McClary J. Zajchowski D.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1733-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), which is also called TRIM16 (23Reymond A. Meroni G. Fantozzi A. Merla G. Cairo S. Luzi L. Riganelli D. Zanaria E. Messali S. Cainarca S. Guffanti A. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Ballabio A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2140-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). To confirm the KGF-regulated expression of ebbp we performed RNase protection assays using a template corresponding to part of the coding region of the EBBP cDNA. We observed a biphasic regulation of ebbp expression after addition of KGF to quiescent HaCaT cells (Fig. 1). After a minor initial increase (1 h after KGF stimulation), EBBP mRNA levels declined strongly within 5–8 h. The down-regulation was partially reversible, since the mRNA levels increased again after 24 h. A similar regulation of ebbp expression was also seen with FGF-10, another member of the FGF family, which binds to the same receptor as KGF (24Igarashi M. Finch P.W. Aaronson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13230-13235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In this case, however, the down-regulation occurred later compared with KGF. Treatment of HaCaT cells with EGF, another important mitogen for keratinocytes (25Rheinwald J.G. Green H. Nature. 1977; 265: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar) or with serum, caused a similar biphasic regulation of ebbp expression, although the initial induction was stronger compared with the induction seen with KGF and FGF-10. By contrast, transforming growth factor-β1 had only a minor effect on EBBP mRNA levels (Fig. 1) and interleukin-1β or tumor necrosis factor-α had no effect (not shown). Incubation of the cells in the absence of any growth factor or cytokine resulted in a slight down-regulation of ebbp expression. Thus, regulation of ebbp expression appears to be specific for keratinocyte mitogens. We subsequently isolated the full-length human and murine EBBP cDNAs from cDNA libraries of HaCaT cells or mouse skin wounds, respectively. Several positive clones were obtained, and the longest inserts were completely sequenced in both orientations. The cDNAs isolated from the HaCaT library correspond to the published sequence of the EBBP cDNA (GenBankTM XM052478 and NM006470.2) and to six stretches on human chromosome 17 (GenBankTM AC005324), the known locus of the ebbp gene (17p11.2) (16Liu H.-L. C. Golder-Novoselsky E. Seto M.H. Webster L. McClary J. Zajchowski D.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1733-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that the human ebbp gene includes 6 exons. The 3′ ends of the cDNAs isolated from the mouse skin wound library are identical to a partial cDNA of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein 16 (GenBankTM AF220134.1), the putative murine homologue of human EBBP (23Reymond A. Meroni G. Fantozzi A. Merla G. Cairo S. Luzi L. Riganelli D. Zanaria E. Messali S. Cainarca S. Guffanti A. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Ballabio A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2140-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). The complete open reading frame of the murine ebbp gene is shown in Fig. 2 A. The human EBBP protein consists of 564 amino acids and has an expected molecular weight of 64,000, whereas the mouse EBBP protein is only 558 amino acids in length (Fig. 2 B). The predicted EBBP proteins start at the amino terminus with a region containing a high percentage of negatively charged amino acids (Figs.2, A and B, and 3 A). This region is followed by two B boxes and three coiled-coil domains, which often mediate protein-protein interactions (26Borden K.L.B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The COOH terminus of EBBP is characterized by the presence of a B30.2 domain of as yet unknown function (27Henry J. Mather I.H. McDermott M.F. Pontarotti P. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1998; 15: 1696-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The total sequence identity between the human and mouse EBBP proteins is 77%, ranging from 41% in the acidic domain to 88% in the B30.2 domain. This domain composition is characteristic for members of the RING finger-B box-coiled coil (RBCC) protein family that play important roles in development, differentiation, and disease. To characterize the EBBP proteins we generated a polyclonal rabbit antiserum directed against a 13-amino acid peptide corresponding to the amino-terminal part of the B30.2 domain (amino acids 446–458 in Fig. 2 B). This antibody should recognize both the human and the murine EBBP proteins, which are identical in this part of the B30.2 domain (Fig. 2 B). To determine the specificity of the antibody, we fused the human EBBP cDNA in-frame with a sequence encoding an epitope tag of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) (Fig. 3 B). Full-length EBBP as well as proteins with the HA epitope at the amino terminus (HA-EBBP) or carboxyl terminus (EBBP-HA) were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The calculated molecular mass of the tagged proteins is 66 kDa. Using the HA antibody, proteins of an apparent molecular mass of about 78 kDa were detected in total cell lysates of EBBP-HA and HA-EBBP transfected cells (Fig. 3 C). By contrast, these proteins were not detectable in vector-transfected cells or in cells transfected with the non-tagged proteins, indicating that they represent the tagged versions of EBBP. The affinity purified EBBP antibody recognized proteins of the same size, demonstrating a high specificity of this antiserum (Fig. 3 D). In addition, it also detected the untagged transfected protein and a protein, which migrated slightly faster than the untagged EBBP (75 kDa). The latter is likely to represent endogenous EBBP, since it was also detected in vector-transfected cells (Fig. 3 D) and non-transfected cells (not shown). The reason for the larger size of the untagged, recombinant EBBP compared with the endogenous protein is not known, but the presence of four additional amino acids at the amino terminus of the recombinant protein might at least partially explain this phenomenon. These amino acids result from the presence of a second ATG in the expression vector that is preceded by a KOZAK sequence for optimal translation. Alternatively, the difference in size may be due to different post-translational modification of the endogenous protein. In non-transfected and vector-transfected HaCaT cells, the EBBP antibody also recognized a protein of about 75 kDa (Fig. 3 E) which is likely to represent endogenous EBBP, and a slightly larger protein in HaCaT cells that were transiently transfected with the EBBP-HA cDNA. These proteins were not detected when the antibody was pre-incubated with an excess of the immunization peptide (Fig. 3 F). We subsequently performed immunofluorescence with the monoclonal HA and the polyclonal EBBP antibody. A strong cytoplasmic staining and a weak nuclear staining was observed with the HA antibody in EBBP-HA-transfected COS-1 cells (Fig. 4 A, upper panel) but not in EBBP-transfected cells. A similar localization was observed with the EBBP antibody in vector-transfected, EBBP-HA- and EBBP transfected cells (Fig. 4 A, lower panel, and data not shown). Most importantly, the distribution of EBBP was identical in COS-1 cells, which had been transiently transfected with EBBP, EBBP-HA, or HA-EBBP expression vectors, demonstrating that the HA epitope tag does not affect the localization (data not shown). A similar staining pattern was observed with the EBBP antibody in HaCaT cells (Fig. 4 B, left panel). The staining was strongly reduced after preincubation of the antibody with an excess of the immunization peptide (Fig. 4 B, right panel). The presence of EBBP in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus was also confirmed by Western blot analysis of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of HaCaT cells (not shown), although exact quantification was not possible due to the high insolubility of the protein. These results demonstrate that (i) the antibody is suitable for the specific detection of EBBP by Western blotting or immunofluorescence and that (ii) endogenous and recombinant EBBPs are mainly localized in the cytoplasm of COS-1 and HaCaT cells. To determine a possible regulation of ebbp expression by KGF or EGF at the protein level, serum-starved HaCaT cells were treated with KGF, EGF, or serum using the conditions described for the RNA experiments (Fig. 1). No difference in the expression of EBBP protein was observed within 6–24 h after growth factor or serum addition (Fig. 5). This finding demonstrates that the initial up-regulation and subsequent down-regulation of EBBP mRNA expression upon addition of KGF or EGF does not affect the levels of EBBP protein within this period. However, we observed significant differences between control and FCS/EGF/KGF-stimulated cells after longer incubation periods. Thus, a longer starvation of the cells caused a strong down-regulation of EBBP protein expression (compare control bands after 6, 24, 36, and 48 h in Fig. 5). Within this time frame the down-regulation was prevented by addition of serum and EGF and to a lesser extent also by KGF. Thus, the regulation of ebbp mRNA differed from that of the corresponding protein, demonstrating that ebbp expression is not only regulated at the transcriptional but also at the post-transcriptional level. To determine the in vivo expression of EBBP, we stained frozen sections from human skin with our affinity purified EBBP antibody (Fig. 6 A). EBBP was detected throughout the epidermis of human skin, but the expression in the basal layer was generally higher than in the keratin 10-positive suprabasal layers (Fig. 6, B and C). However, EBBP levels increased again in cells of the cornified layer. Weak signals were also observed in the dermal layer. The specificity of the staining was confirmed by preincubation of the antibody with the immunization peptide. In this case only a very weak background signal was observed, whereas preincubation with a non-related peptide had no effect (data not shown). To determine a possible role of EBBP in cutaneous wound repair, we prepared RNA and protein lysates from full-thickness excisional mouse wounds at different stages of the healing process, and analyzed the levels of EBBP mRNA and protein by RNase protection assay and Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 7 A, the levels of EBBP mRNA decreased slightly within 3 days after injury, and slowly increased again at day 7 after wounding. However, the mRNA levels were still lower than in non-wounded skin at day 13 after injury when the wound was fully healed. In a Western blot analysis of skin and wound lysates, a major protein with an apparent molecular weight of 75,000 was detected with the EBBP antibody. The size of this protein was comparable with the size of the major protein found in lysates of COS-1 cells after transfection with a murine EBBP expression vector (data not shown). This band was not detected when the antibody was pretreated with the immunization peptide (data not shown). The bands migrating at an apparent size of about 60 kDa are unspecific, because they were also detected when the membrane was only incubated with the secondary antibody (not shown). Equal loading was controlled by Ponceau S staining of the membrane after blotting (not shown). As an additional control, the same lysates were analyzed for the presence of β-actin (Fig. 7 B). Interestingly, the levels of EBBP protein declined rapidly after wounding,"
https://openalex.org/W2040720194,"The human inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS or NOSII) gene is regulated through an extended and complex promoter. In this study, the transcriptional regulation of human NOSII is investigated in the human colon cell line HCT-8R. Stimulation with a cytokine mix (interferon-gamma, interleukin 1-beta, and tumor necrosis factor alpha) induces NOSII mRNA accumulation, as well as promoter activity in these cells. Several random deletions were performed within the proximal 7 kb of the promoter, which led to the identification of a region, whose deletion provokes a marked increase in transcriptional activity upon cytokine stimulation. Furthermore, this region is shown to repress a viral-driven luciferase construct, mainly at basal levels. An AP-1-like sequence present in this region that is specifically recognized by nuclear proteins is shown to be involved in the repressive effect. This element is capable of repressing a viral promoter, and its deletion augments cytokine-stimulated transcription. These findings are confirmed in various cell lines and suggest a general mechanism for the control of basal levels of NOSII expression, to avoid unnecessary toxicity under normal conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1973599492,"The retina-specific human ABC transporter (ABCR) functions in the retinal transport system and has been implicated in several inherited visual diseases, including Stargardt disease, fundus flavimaculatus, cone-rod dystrophy, and age-related macular degeneration. We have previously described a general ribonucleotidase activity of the first nucleotide binding domain (NBD1) of human ABCR (Biswas, E. E. (2001)Biochemistry 40, 8181–8187). In this communication, we present a quantitative study analyzing the effects of certain disease-associated mutations, Gly-863 → Ala, Pro-940 → Arg, and Arg-943 → Gln on the nucleotide binding, and general ribonucleotidase activities of this domain. NBD1 proteins, harboring these mutations, were created through in vitrosite-specific mutagenesis and expressed in Escherichia coli. Results of the enzyme-kinetic studies indicated that these mutations altered the ATPase and CTPase activities of NBD1. The G863A and P940R mutations were found to have significant attenuation of the rates of nucleotide hydrolysis and binding affinities. On the other hand, the R943Q mutation had small, but detectable reduction in its nucleotidase activity and nucleotide binding affinity. We have measured the nucleotide binding affinities of NBD1 protein and its mutants quantitatively by fluorescence anisotropy changes during protein binding to ethenoadenosine ATP (εATP), a fluorescent ATP analogue. We have correlated the dissociation constant (KD) and the rates of nucleotide hydrolysis (Vmax) of NBD1 and its mutants with the available genetic data for these mutations. The retina-specific human ABC transporter (ABCR) functions in the retinal transport system and has been implicated in several inherited visual diseases, including Stargardt disease, fundus flavimaculatus, cone-rod dystrophy, and age-related macular degeneration. We have previously described a general ribonucleotidase activity of the first nucleotide binding domain (NBD1) of human ABCR (Biswas, E. E. (2001)Biochemistry 40, 8181–8187). In this communication, we present a quantitative study analyzing the effects of certain disease-associated mutations, Gly-863 → Ala, Pro-940 → Arg, and Arg-943 → Gln on the nucleotide binding, and general ribonucleotidase activities of this domain. NBD1 proteins, harboring these mutations, were created through in vitrosite-specific mutagenesis and expressed in Escherichia coli. Results of the enzyme-kinetic studies indicated that these mutations altered the ATPase and CTPase activities of NBD1. The G863A and P940R mutations were found to have significant attenuation of the rates of nucleotide hydrolysis and binding affinities. On the other hand, the R943Q mutation had small, but detectable reduction in its nucleotidase activity and nucleotide binding affinity. We have measured the nucleotide binding affinities of NBD1 protein and its mutants quantitatively by fluorescence anisotropy changes during protein binding to ethenoadenosine ATP (εATP), a fluorescent ATP analogue. We have correlated the dissociation constant (KD) and the rates of nucleotide hydrolysis (Vmax) of NBD1 and its mutants with the available genetic data for these mutations. retina-specific human ABC transporter ATP binding cassette Stargardt disease amino acid(s) nucleotide binding domain wild-type 1, N6-ethenoadenosine 5′-triphosphate analogue age-related macular degeneration The retinal ATP binding cassette transporter (ABCR)1 protein acts as an outwardly directed flippase for the all-trans-retinal transport in rod (or cone) outer segments cells during the phototransduction cascade, and it was originally discovered inXenopus and bovine retina as rim protein (1Papermaster D.S.

Several inherited visual diseases such as Stargardt disease (STGD), fundus flavimaculatus, cone-rod dystrophy (also known as CORD4), retinitis pigmentosa, and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) have been linked to mutations in the ABCR gene, which encodes a photoreceptor-specific ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter (2–14). This transporter gene was identified in humans and localized to chromosomal position 1p22.1-p21 by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and has been fully characterized (2Allikmets R. Singh N. Sun H.

This gene is expressed at high levels in the retina in rod photoreceptors, although it appears to be expressed also in cone photoreceptors (2Allikmets R. Singh N. Sun H. Shroyer N.F. Hutchinson A.

Typically, ABCR protein exhibits the characteristic features of an ABC transporter; it contains two conserved ATP binding cassettes and uses the energy of nucleotide hydrolysis to transport substrates through the membrane against a concentration gradient (18Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). This protein contains two highly hydrophobic transmembrane domains, each consisting of six α-helical segments that span the membrane (see Fig. 1A). These domains are thought to confer substrate specificity to the ABCR protein. The nature of the substrates of ABC proteins vary enormously and include sugars, peptides, drugs, lipids, steroids, amino acids, and polysaccharides (18Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev.

However, in vitro reconstitution studies carried out using purified bovine ABCR suggest that a retinoid, specifically trans-retinal, is the likely substrate of ABCR (26Sun H. Molday R.S. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8269-8281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In addition to the transmembrane domains, there are two hydrophilic ATP binding domains, one located at the N-terminal region (NBD1) and the other at the C-terminal region (NBD2). Both domains are peripherally located at the cytoplasmic face of the membrane (2Allikmets R. Singh N. Sun H. Shroyer N.F. Hutchinson A. Chidambaram A. Gerrard B. Baird L. Stauffer D. Peiffer A.

Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). Each of these nucleotide binding domains (NBD), includes two short motifs associated with several nucleotide binding proteins and termed as Walker Motif A (GXXGXGKT) and Walker Motif B (RX6–8hyd4D) (27Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar).

Many ABCR mutations related to recessive Stargardt disease, age-related macular degeneration, and fundus flavimaculatus map within nucleotide binding domain 1 or 2, pointing to a defect in the ATP-driven energy transduction process. Previous studies carried out in our laboratory on the first nucleotide binding domain (NBD1) demonstrated that this protein is active as a ribonucleotidase (17Biswas E.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8181-8187Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Using competition binding assays, it was also found that this protein can function as a general nucleotide binding domain that is able to bind and hydrolyze ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP, with a nucleotide preference CTP > GTP > ATP ≫ UTP. In this report, we have focused our analysis on genetic mutations located within the NBD1 domain. We have explored the relationship between specific mutations in this domain with ABCR protein function using recombinant mutant proteins. We have chosen three mutations based on the previously published genetic phenotypes: Gly-863 → Ala, Pro-940 → Arg, and Arg-943 → Gln. The Gly-863 → Ala mutation was first reported as a disease-causing mutation and, subsequently, as one of the most frequently observed mutations in STGD patients (2Allikmets R. Singh N. Sun H.

We have specifically investigated the nucleotidase (ATPase and CTPase) activities of the mutant proteins by kinetic studies and ATP binding affinities (KD) under equilibrium conditions using fluorescence anisotropy and the fluorescent ATP analogue, εATP. The plasmid pET29a containing wild-type DNA corresponding to the N-terminal nucleotide binding domain (NBD1) of the human ABCR gene was obtained in our laboratory as previously described by E. E. Biswas (17Biswas E.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8181-8187Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Ultrapure ribo- and deoxynucleotides were obtained from AmershamBiosciences, Inc. and were used without further purification. [α-32P]ATP and [α-32P]CTP were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). Polyethyleneimine-cellulose TLC strips were purchased from J. T. Baker Chemical Co. (Pittsburgh, PA). The oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) and were of high purity (≥95%) as determined by autoradiography of the phosphorylated products. Oligonucleotides used in PCR were used without additional purification. The T7 expression system vector pET29a, BugBuster protein extraction reagent, and Benzonase Nuclease were purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). The Pfu DNA polymerase for PCR amplification was from Stratagene, Inc. (La Jolla, CA). The fluorescent ATP analogue, εATP, was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Buffer A was 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 15% (v/v) glycerol. Buffer B contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 20 mm EDTA. Buffer C was 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 2 mm EDTA. Buffer D contained 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 ml-arginine, and 2 mmEDTA. Buffer E contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Buffer F was 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mmMgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 0.01% Nonidet P-40. The wild-type construct pET29aNBD1 was available in our laboratory. It was amplified from the human retinal cDNA clone in pRK5 as previously described by Biswas (17Biswas E.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8181-8187Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, the DNA containing this domain was isolated by PCR under high fidelity conditions using Pfu DNA polymerase. Oligonucleotides primers were designed such that a BamHI site with an in-frame ATG (Met) codon was present in the 5′-primer and aHindIII site after the stop codon in the 3′-primer. The region amplified spanned nucleotides 2641–4207, considering the ATG start codon as the first nucleotide of the ABCR gene. The PCR-amplified DNA was cloned into the pET29a expression vector (Novagen Corp., Milwaukee, WI) in the BamHI/HindIII sites. The absence of fortuitous mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing carried out at the Nucleic Acid Core Facility of Thomas Jefferson University. The resulting recombinant plasmid (pET29aNBD1) was used for expression of the wtNBD1 protein in Escherichia coliBL21(DE3) cells, following a procedure described earlier (32Biswas E.E. Chen P.H. Biswas S.B. Protein Expr. Purif. 1995; 6: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This plasmid was also used as the parent of all the mutant clones of NBD1. The NBD1 polypeptide contained 522 amino acids (aa) spanning the entire N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of ABCR, aa 854–1375, and has a deduced molecular mass of 57.8 kDa. The cloning was designed such that NBD1 was expressed as a S-tag fusion protein, which added an additional 30 aa to the polypeptide. Thus, the calculated molecular mass of the NBD1 protein with an S-tag is 62 kDa. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using a mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as previously described (33Biswas E.E. Biswas S.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15879-15886Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Using the NBD1 expression vector pET29aNBD1 as the template, 18 cycles of PCR were performed (each cycle was 50 s at 95 °C, 50 s at 60 °C, and 15 min at 68 °C) using complementary oligonucleotides as mutagenic primers to generate the mutant NBD1 proteins as follows: Gly-863 → Ala (5′-GAT CAG GTG TTT CCA GCA GAC TAT GGA ACC CCA C-3′ and 5′-GTG GGG TTC CAT AGT CTG CTG GAA ACA CCT GAT C-3′), Pro-940 → Arg (5′-GGT AAA GAT TTT TGA GCG CTG TGG CCG GCC AGC TG-3′ and 5′-CAG CTG GCC GGC CAC AGC GCT CAA AAA TCT TTA CC-3′), Arg-943 → Gln (5′-GAT TTT TGA GCC CTG TGG CCA GCC AGC TGT GGA CC-3′ and 5′-GGT CCA CAG CTG GCT GGC CAC AGG GCT CAA AAA TC-3′). The authenticity of the mutations and the absence of other fortuitous mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing carried out by the Nucleic Acid Core Facilities at the Kimmel Cancer Center of Thomas Jefferson University. Following verification of the desired mutations, the pET29a constructs were used to transform E. coli strain BL21(DE3) cells, in which the expression of the recombinant proteins is under control of the lacUV5 promoter. A typical induction was: cultures of BL21(DE3) harboring the desired construct were grown with shaking to A600 = 0.4 at 37 °C, at which time the induction of protein was initiated by adding of IPTG to 0.4 mm, grown, and shaken for 2 h more. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C, and the level of expression was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The wild-type and mutant NBD1 proteins were extracted from inclusion bodies using a protocol, which combines the use of BugBuster protein extraction reagent (Novagen, Madison, WI) to process the insoluble fraction and yield purified inclusion bodies, with the method described by Booth (34Booth C.L. Pulaski L. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5518-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) for solubilization and renaturation of inclusion-body protein. After harvesting the expressed proteins, the cell pellets were resuspended in room temperature BugBuster reagent, and protease inhibitors were added. After incubation, the cell suspension was centrifuged to collect purified inclusion bodies. Following cell lysis, the pellet of inclusion bodies was resuspended in buffer B and centrifuged once more. The inclusion body proteins were solubilized in Buffer C containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride. Protein refolding was achieved by dilution in Buffer D. The renatured protein was sequentially dialyzed in Buffer E. After overnight dialysis, the conductivity of the protein was checked to adjust to that of dialysis buffer, and 15% glycerol (final concentration) was added. The dialyzed protein was concentrated to ∼1 mg/ml approximately using Amicon Ultrafiltration and stored at −80 °C until use. This protein is essentially homogenous as analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The ATPase and CTPase activity assays were carried out as previously described (17Biswas E.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8181-8187Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 33Biswas E.E. Biswas S.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15879-15886Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 35Biswas E.E. Biswas S.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10919-10928Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The amount of NBD1 protein (wild-type and mutants) used in the assays was selected such that the rate of hydrolysis would be linear in the time range examined. A standard 10-μl reaction mixture contained 10 mm MgCl2, 500 μm (or as indicated) [α-32P]ATP, and NBD1wt or NBD1mutant proteins (as indicated) in buffer A, each reaction in these assays was performed in duplicate. All reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min (unless stated otherwise) and terminated by adding 1 μl of 500 mm EDTA followed by chilling on ice. Aliquots (1 μl) of each reaction mixture were applied to the polyethyleneimine-cellulose strips, which were pre-spotted with an ADP and ATP marker. The strips were developed with 1 m formic acid and 0.5 m LiCl and dried. The ADP and ATP spots were located by UV fluorescence. The portions containing ATP and ADP were excised and counted in a Beckman LS500 liquid scintillation counter using a toluene-based scintillator. In the kinetic analyses, reactions were carried out in a single tube and were initiated with the addition of each NBD1 protein studied. At the indicated time points, 10-μl aliquots were removed and transferred to tubes containing 1 μl of 500 mm EDTA, and the tubes were held on ice until completion of the last time point. The remainder of the assay was carried out as described above. CTPase assays were carried out in an analogous manner except that the appropriated ribonucleotides were substituted for ATP and ATP or ADP as required in the procedure. ATP binding to NBD1 proteins was studied using the fluorescent substrate ATP analogue εATP (1, N6-ethenoadenosine 5′-triphosphate). The fluorescence anisotropy studies were performed using the back titration method earlier described by Boyer et al. (36Boyer M. Poujol N. Margeat E. Royer C.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2494-2502Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The fluorescence anisotropy (R) is defined by, R=(Ivv−G×Ivh)/(Ivv+2×G×Ivh)(Eq. 1) where G is the instrumental correction factor for the fluorometer, defined by, G=Ihv/Ihh(Eq. 2) Where Ihh, Ihv, Ivv, and Ivh are the fluorescence intensities with horizontal-horizontal, horizontal-vertical, vertical-vertical, and vertical-horizontal orientations of the excitation and emission polarizers. The fluorescent ATP analogue, εATP, was added to buffer F to 0.05 μm. Each point in the titration curve was obtained by starting with 1.5 ml of a solution of 100 μg/ml (1.73 μm) protein. Aliquots of 100 μl were successively removed from the starter solution containing the protein·εATP complex and replaced by 100 μl of fresh buffer F containing εATP. After incubation of samples at room temperature with constant stirring for 2–3 min in quartz cuvettes, fluorescence anisotropy was measured for each dilution using a custom made Photon Counting Spectrofluorometer equipped with a Glan Thomson polarizer in both excitation and emission channels. The excitation wavelength was set at 300 nm, and fluorescence anisotropy was recorded at an emission wavelength of 412 nm. Global analysis of the data was conducted using BIOEQS and/or PRISM (GraphPad Software Inc.) programs, using a monomer-ligand binding model (37Royer C.A. Smith W.R. Beechem J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 191: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 38Royer C.A. Beechem J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 481-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 39Royer C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). BIOEQS calculates the concentration of various species in the equilibrium-binding curve numerically using a constrained optimization algorithm in which the mass balance constraints are incorporated as Lagrange multipliers (37Royer C.A. Smith W.R. Beechem J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 191: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The program then relates this species concentration vector to the anisotropy observed at each point in the titration and fits the free energy and plateau values by adjusting these floating parameters using a Marquardt-Levenberg nonlinear least squares algorithm (40Ozers M.S. Hills J.J. Ervin K. Wood J.R. Nardulli A.M. Royer C.A. Gorski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30405-30411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The simple binding model was used to determine ΔG for the binding of an NBD1 monomer unit to the εATP. This model includes free εATP, free NBD1, and NBD1·εATP complex (Equation 3), NBD1+εATP⇄(NBD1)·εATP(Eq. 3) Initial values of NBD1, εATP, and NBD1·εATP were 0, 12, and 130 milli-anisotropy (mA), respectively. From the ΔG values, the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) was calculated by the relationship, ΔG°=−RTlnKD(Eq. 4) where R represents the gas constant, and Tis the temperature in kelvin. Homology-based modeling of NBD1 polypeptide was carried out in several discreet steps. First, we aligned the NBD1 sequence with ATP binding domains of ABC transporters with known structures and available crystallographic coordinates. Preliminary structure was generated using the Swiss-PDB program. This structure was refined by using SYBYL6.7 software (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO). Protein concentrations were determined by two methods. The Bradford assay (41Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard and the extinction coefficient method where: εm280 = 4.1 × 104m−1 in Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) and 4.35 × 104m−1 in 0.1m KOH for wild-type NBD1 protein. Protein analysis was performed using SDS-PAGE as described by Laemmli (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 22: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). Analysis of the amino acid sequence of human ABCR protein indicates the presence of two cytoplasmic nucleotide binding motifs (4Nasonkin I. Illing M. Koehler M.R. Schmid M. Molday R.S. Weber B.H.F. Hum. Genet. 1998; 102: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The first cytoplasmic nucleotide binding domain (NBD1) comprises amino acids (aa) 854-1375 (2641–4207 bp) (17Biswas E.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8181-8187Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), is defined as NBD1, and is the focus of our current studies (Fig. 1). The NBD1 domain contains both Walker type A and type B nucleotide binding motifs (Fig.1B) (27Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar). To define this domain more critically we have divided NBD1 in three subdomains α (aa 854–960), β (aa 961–1100, central domain containing the Walker A and B motifs), and γ (aa 1101–1375) as illustrated in Fig. 1B. We have analyzed the nucleotide binding and hydrolysis of three structurally important and disease related mutations: Gly-863 → Ala, Pro-940 → Arg, and Arg-943 → Gln (Table I). All of these mutations are located within the α-domain (Fig. 1C) (17Biswas E.E.

Because Lys-355 is the only charged residue in the hydrophobic sector, we tested the hypothesis that lysine 355 contributes to the binding site for the anionic substrate, oxalate. This idea was supported by mutational analysis, which showed that of five variants studied (Lys-355 → Cys, Gly, Gln, Arg, or Thr), residual function was found for only the K355R derivative, in which catalytic efficiency had fallen 2,600-fold. Further insight came from a study of TM11 single-cysteine mutants, using the impermeant, thiol-specific reagents, carboxyethyl methanethiosulfonate and ethyltrimethylammonium methanethiosulfonate. Of the five reactive positions identified in TM11, four were at the cytoplasmic or periplasmic ends of TM11 (S344C and A345C, and G366C and A370C, respectively), whereas the fifth was at the center of the helix (S359C). Added study with carboxyethyl methanethiosulfonate and ethylsulfonate methylthiosulfonate showed that the attack on S359C could be blocked by the presence of the substrate, oxalate, and that protection could be predicted quantitatively by a kinetic model in which S359C is accessible only in the unliganded form of OxlT. Parallel study showed that the proteoliposomes used in such work contained OxlT of right side-out and inside-out orientations in about equal amounts. Accordingly, full inhibition of S359C by the impermeable methanethiosulfonate-linked probes must reflect an approach from both the cytosolic and periplasmic surfaces of the protein. This, coupled with the finding of substrate protection, leads us to conclude that S359C lies on the translocation pathway through OxlT. Since position 359 and 355 lie on the same helical face, we suggest that Lys-355 also lies on the translocation pathway, consistent with the idea that the essential nature of Lys-355 reflects its role in binding the anionic substrate, oxalate.

OxlT therefore plays a pivotal role in construction of a “virtual” proton pump, an organizational scheme with relevance to several aspects of microbial cell biology (4Maloney P.C. Curr. Opin.

Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), may also serve as a valuable model for more broadly directed studies of membrane transport proteins. For such reasons, further study of OxlT may contribute to ongoing studies of both the biology and biochemistry of membrane transport. Hydropathy analysis of the OxlT amino acid sequence (3Abe K. Ruan Z.-S. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6789-6793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), together with circular dichroism spectroscopy of the purified, solubilized protein (8Fu D. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2129-2135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), suggests the presence of 12 transmembrane α-helices, a characteristic shared by most other members of the major facilitator superfamily (9Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This analysis also predicts that Lys-355 is positioned near the center of transmembrane helix 11 (TM11)1 (3Abe K. Ruan Z.-S. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6789-6793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), an expectation verified by site-directed fluorescent labeling of single-cysteine variants in this vicinity (10Fu D. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17962-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Direct evaluation of OxlT topology 2Ye, L., Jia, Z., Jung, T., and Maloney, P. C. (2001) J. Bacteriol., in press. suggests that Lys-355 does not interact with a nearby anionic residue, thereby raising an apparent paradox. Placement of an uncompensated charge within a hydrophobic environment adds a destabilizing element to membrane protein structure (12Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar, 13Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Goldman A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 321-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar), but OxlT can be remarkably stable in lipid-detergent micelles (7Maloney P.C Anantharam V. Allison M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10531-10536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Fu D. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17962-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This contradiction might be reconciled if the energetic disadvantage contributed by Lys-355 were used to offset the energetic cost of binding and/or transporting substrate anions. Such compensating effects could be achieved in a simple way if TM11 forms part of the substrate translocation pathway, allowing direct interactions between positively charged Lys-355 and negatively charged substrate. That solubilized OxlT is intensely stabilized by the presence of its substrate anions (7Maloney P.C Anantharam V. Allison M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10531-10536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Fu D. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17962-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), gives indirect support to this view, but more concrete observations are necessary if this model is to guide further work. The experiments reported here sought to address such issues by asking if one or more residues on TM11 is involved in substrate binding and/or translocation. To do this, we first examined the role of Lys-355 itself by analysis of site-specific mutants. We then exploited a panel of single-cysteine variants to search throughout TM11 for perturbations attributable to either cysteine substitution or to site-specific chemical modification. Together, these two lines of study provide evidence justifying the idea that as substrate passes through OxlT, it encounters residue(s) along TM11 in the vicinity of Lys-355. Wild type OxlT was encoded within a 1.4-kilobase XbaI-HindIII fragment in pBluescript II SK+; expression of OxlT was regulated by thelac promoter (3Abe K. Ruan Z.-S. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6789-6793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This plasmid also served as the vehicle for site-directed mutagenesis using a double-stranded protocol (Cameleon™, Stratagene) to generate mutants of Lys-355. Similar techniques were used to construct a fully active cysteine-less variant with nine tandem histidine residues added at its C terminus to facilitate protein purification (8Fu D. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2129-2135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10Fu D. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17962-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This latter derivative was used as the template for generation of the panel of single-cysteine derivatives spanning TM11 (10Fu D. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17962-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). OxlT and its mutants were carried inEscherichia coli strain XL-1, together with plasmid pMS421 (Specr, LacIq) to limit inappropriate basal expression (3Abe K. Ruan Z.-S. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6789-6793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). OxlT expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to cells in the mid-exponential phase of growth; cells were harvested after an additional 4 h growth. Membrane ghosts, prepared as described (10Fu D. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17962-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Varadhachary A. Maloney P.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1407-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), were suspended in distilled water; membrane proteins were solubilized by incubating for 20 min on ice in Buffer A (20 mm MOPS/K (pH 7), 20% (v/v) glycerol, 4.2 mg/ml E. coli phospholipid, 10 mm potassium oxalate, and 1.5% (w/v) octylglucoside). Here, and in all work involving thiol labeling (below), the E. coli lipid used for solubilization and reconstitution had been hydrated with distilled water rather than with the usual 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol (1Anantharam V. Allison M.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7244-7250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Solubilized protein (0.7–1 mg/ml) was reconstituted by detergent dilution (10Fu D. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17962-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Ambudkar S.V. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10079-10086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to give proteoliposomes loaded with 100 mm potassium oxalate, 50 mm MOPS/K (pH 7). In most cases, [14C]oxalate transport was measured by a rapid filtration assay. Triplicate 100–200-μl aliquots of proteoliposomes were placed at the center of Millipore GSTF filters (0.22-μm pore size), washed twice with 5 ml of Buffer B (100 mm potassium sulfate, 50 mm MOPS/K, (pH 7) to remove external (unlabeled) oxalate, and after interrupting the vacuum, proteoliposomes trapped on the filter were overlaid with 300 μl of Buffer B containing 100 μm [14C]oxalate. Unless otherwise indicated, the assay was terminated after 20 s by filtration, followed with two washes using 5 ml of iced Buffer B. Depending on experimental design, oxalate transport is given as a fraction of the maximum incorporation or as relative to that of the cysteine-less parental protein, after correction for differences in protein expression (10Fu D. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17962-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This assay provides a wider dynamic range than available earlier (3Abe K. Ruan Z.-S. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6789-6793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 8Fu D. Maloney P.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 17962-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and is especially suited to the parallel study of a large number of samples. [14C]Oxalate transport was also monitored by a traditional filtration assay (1Anantharam V. Allison M.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7244-7250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Abe K. Ruan Z.-S. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6789-6793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In these cases, washed proteoliposomes suspended as a concentrated stock in Buffer B were diluted 10-fold into this same buffer at 23 °C, and the transport reaction was initiated by addition of either 100 μm or 1 mm labeled substrate, as specified. At timed intervals, samples were withdrawn for filtration and washing. To screen for thiol reactivity in the TM11 panel of single-cysteine derivatives, membrane ghosts were placed with excess probe (2 mm MTSCE or 1 mm MTSET) in 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 8) for 1 h at 23 °C. Unreacted probe was removed either by a quench using 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, or by four cycles of washing with 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7), as noted. Subsequently, membrane protein was solubilized and reconstituted as described above. These conditions allow labeling of residues on both intra- and extracellular surfaces2 (10Fu D. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17962-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The orientation of OxlT in proteoliposomes was deduced from the pattern of thiol labeling of cysteines placed at either end of TM11 and also by monitoring the effects on substrate transport of external trypsin. For thiol labeling, the target protein (A345C or A370C) was purified (>95%) by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography, essentially as described (8Fu D. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2129-2135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10Fu D. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17962-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) except that the final elution used a buffer containing 100 mm potassium oxalate, 50 mm potassium acetate, 20% glycerol (v/v), and 5 mg/ml diheptanoylphosphatidylcholine (pH 4.5). Prior to reconstitution, 10 μl of the eluate (5–10 μg of protein), was mixed with 240 μl of Buffer A in which lipid was increased to 10 mg/ml to compensate for that normally contributed by native membranes (see above). Protein concentration (40 μg/ml) was close to that of OxlT in crude extracts, which contained the transporter at 3–5% of membrane protein (8Fu D. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2129-2135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10Fu D. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17962-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After reconstitution, proteoliposomes were washed and finally suspended in 0.5 ml of Buffer B. Cysteines exposed to the suspending medium were blocked by exposure to 2 mm MTSET for 15 min at 23 °C. The probe was removed by a 40-fold dilution with iced Buffer B, followed by centrifugation and resuspension of proteoliposomes to their original volume in Buffer B. MTSET-pretreated proteoliposomes, along with untreated controls, were then incubated with either 400 μm MPB or an equivalent volume of its dimethyl sulfoxide solvent for 60 min at 23 °C. This second reaction was quenched by dilution, centrifugation, and washing, as above. In some cases, MPB labeling was followed by addition of trypsin (1 mg/ml) and further incubation for 90 min at 33 °C, after which protease action was quenched by dilution, centrifugation, and resuspension (as above) using iced Buffer B containing 1 mm AEBSF. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and after transfer to nitrocellulose, the presence of MPB was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce, SuperSignal™) using a horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-biotin antibody (New England Biolabs). To monitor recovery of OxlT, the blot was stripped and reprobed with a polyclonal antibody reactive to the OxlT N terminus (2Ruan Z.-S. Anantharam V. Crawford I.T. Ambudkar S.V. Rhee S.Y.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6789-6793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Signals were captured by an automated documentation system (Fuji Medical Systems, Inc.). The sensitivity of OxlT to external trypsin was monitored using the wild-type protein purified as described (8Fu D. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2129-2135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10Fu D. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17962-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After reconstitution (see above), proteoliposomes were placed in 1 ml of Buffer B with and without trypsin (1 mg/ml) at 33 °C, as described (16Fann M.-C. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33735-33740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). At timed intervals, samples were diluted 25-fold with iced Buffer B containing 0.5 mm PMSF. After centrifugation and resuspension, as above, initial rates of [14C]oxalate transport were determined using the traditional filtration assay with 100 μm labeled substrate. Membrane ghosts prepared using the S359C mutant were extracted and crude extracts were reconstituted as noted above. To characterize the concentration dependence of inhibition by MTS-linked probes, proteoliposomes trapped on a Millipore GSTF filter (0.22-μm pore size) were washed twice with Buffer B and then overlaid (in triplicate) for 5 min with 0.5 ml of Buffer B containing MTSCE, MTSES, or MTSET at the specified concentrations. When protection by substrate was monitored, the 5-min incubation was in the presence of probe and increasing concentrations of potassium oxalate (from 0 to 100 mm); a reciprocal decrease in potassium sulfate (from 100 to 0 mm) served to maintain constant ionic and osmotic strength. Reactions were terminated by rapid filtration, followed by two washes with Buffer B, and residual OxlT function was monitored by a second overlay with labeled substrate, as noted above. Preliminary trials showed that half-maximal inhibition of OxlT required 10–30 μm MTSCE, and that nearly complete inhibition (≥95%) was achieved by raising probe concentration to 300 μm. However, even at such high levels of MTSCE, sufficiently high concentrations of oxalate afforded complete protection. Because 2 mm MTSCE had no effect on oxalate transport by the cysteine-less parent (not shown), inhibition of the S359C derivative was attributed solely to reaction of the probe with the target cysteine at position 359, justifying use of a simple kinetic scheme to model probe inhibition. We assumed unliganded OxlT (C) could interact with either substrate (S) or the probe (P), generating, respectively, either liganded OxlT (CS) or an irreversibly inhibited complex (CP*). C+S↔CSC+P→CP*REACTIONS1AND2 Because inhibition by MTSCE occurs on a time scale of minutes, while turnover for OxlT-mediated exchange takes place in milliseconds or less (1Anantharam V. Allison M.J.

Purified E. coli phospholipid was obtained as a lyophilized powder from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. MTSCE, MTSET, and MTSES were from Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc., and MPB was from Molecular Probes, Inc. Roche-Calbiochem provided octylglucoside, while the trypsin (tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated) was from Worthington. PMSF and AEBSF were from Sigma. [14C]Oxalate was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Two classes of experiments explored the idea that Lys-355 and other residues on TM11 might be associated with substrate binding and translocation. In one group of studies, described immediately below, the role of Lys-355 itself was examined by noting the behavior of its mutants. In a second group of experiments, cysteine-scanning mutagenesis identified a residue, near to Lys-355, which served as an informative target for cysteine-directed agents. Both lines of study provided evidence consistent with the idea that Lys-355 and residues in its vicinity normally serve to aid in the translocation of OxlT substrates. If Lys-355 is essential to OxlT function, substitutions at this position should compromise activity. To test this prediction, we used site-directed mutagenesis to replace Lys-355 with alternate residues, including cysteine, glycine, glutamine, arginine, and threonine. In the usual assays of transport by OxlT (see “Experimental Procedures”), these mutants displayed little or no function. In one case (K355G) this was attributable to lack of expression; all other mutants were found in membranes in amounts comparable to the wild type (data not shown; see Ref. 10Fu D. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17962-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), so that lack of function was due to failure of OxlT itself. We considered the possibility that such null responses might reflect a poor substrate affinity, and for that reason we also measured transport by oxalate-loaded proteoliposomes using external [14C]oxalate at 1 mm rather than the usual 0.1 mm. In only one case (the K355R variant) did this added test reveal a significant activity (Fig.1), although the time course of transport by the mutant was greatly extended relative to that of the parental wild type protein. In separate experiments, we performed a further, kinetic analysis of the K355R derivative. That work showed this mutant to have both an elevated Michaelis constant (Km of 5.4 versus 0.15 mm) and a reduced maximal velocity (Vmax of 66 versus 4,700 nmol/min/mg protein), leading to a 2,600-fold reduction in catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km) relative to the parental protein. Accordingly, because mutants of Lys-355 retained little or no function, we conclude this residue is essential for normal OxlT function. The behavior of Lys-355 mutants (Fig. 1) suggests that OxlT requires (at least) the presence of positive charge at position 355. To ask whether nearby residues might also have functional significance, we analyzed a panel of TM11 single-cysteine variants that had earlier been used to establish topological relationships in this region (10Fu D. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17962-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We first tested [14C]oxalate transport under initial rate conditions during the oxalate self-exchange reaction (Fig.2 A). The N347C, A368C, and I369C variants were too poorly expressed (≤5% the parental level) for this analysis, but all others were present at levels high enough (≥40% normal) (10Fu D. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17962-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) to assess functional status. Among the 27 expressed proteins, two (G349C and K355C) gave undetectable levels of [14C]oxalate transport; three others (A354C, G362C, G363C) gave marginal responses (0.2–1% residual activity). In all other cases, we found activity corresponding to at least 1% of the cysteine-less parental protein, yielding a signal-to-noise ratio of at least 20. Since the turnover number for OxlT is at least 1000-fold greater than usually observed for membrane transporters (1Anantharam V. Allison M.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7244-7250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Maloney P.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 8Fu D. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2129-2135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), even these low relative levels of activity might reflect significant rates of anion exchange. Such findings, including the null behavior of K355C, are consistent with earlier studies (10Fu D. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17962-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and with the results noted above (Fig. 1). In earlier work with this same set of single-cysteine variants, we showed that the TM11 core region (positions 351–361; Fig.2 A) is inaccessible to Oregon Green maleimide, a hydrophilic thiol-reactive agent of moderate size (∼500 daltons) (10Fu D. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17962-17967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The present work shows that, although cysteine substitutions giving reduced function (≤10% parental) are broadly represented throughout TM11, a striking distribution is found in this inaccessible region. Within this core, cysteine substitutions yielding low specific activity are restricted to the helical face containing Lys-355 (Fig. 2 B), indicating a distinct functional asymmetry in this area. The high velocity of OxlT-mediated reactions ensures that even cysteine substitution mutants with low residual activity (Fig. 2 A) show satisfactory signal-to-noise ratios. For this reason we pursued a study of these variants using the thiol-specific probes, MTSCE and MTSET. These agents were chosen for their specificity in modification of cysteine (17Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), because their polar and linear character increases the probability they might have access to regions within OxlT near a substrate binding region (e.g. possibly near Lys-355), and because they generate reaction products of a clearly distinct character-MTSET implants a fixed positive charge (RS-SCH2CH2N(CH3)4+), whereas the reaction with MTSCE results in appearance of a carboxyl group that would carry negative charge at pH 7 (RS-SCH2CH2COO−). Membranes containing TM11 single-cysteine variants were exposed to excess MTSCE or MTSET, with and without tests for reversibility by later exposure to β-mercaptoethanol. Subsequent to this in situ labeling, protein was solubilized, and assays of transport by proteoliposomes recorded residual function. MTSET and/or MTSCE gave significant inhibition at five positions, two each in the TM11 cytoplasmic (S344C, A345C) and perip"

A paired Sp1 element at −73 and −42 mediated responses to glucose and angiotensin II (22Chen Y.Q., Su, M. Walia R.R. Hao Q. Covington J.W. Vaughan D.E. J. Biol.

An Ap-1-like element at −59/−52 was reported to mediate the response of the PAI-1 promoter to D dimer, a proteolytic fragment of fibrin (24Olman M.A. Hagood J.S. Simmons W.L. Fuller G.M. Vinson C. White K.E. Blood. 1999; 94: 2029-2038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and also to mediate effects from PKC and PKA (25Arts J. Grimbergen J. Toet K. Kooistra T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Biochem. 1994; 220: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The response element for transforming growth factor β was sought by a number of groups with conflicting results. One group found an element at −732/−721 that was transforming growth factor β responsive when 6 copies were cloned in front of a heterologous promoter (27Song C.Z. Siok T.E. Gelehrter T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29287-29290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Another group found that duplicate E box sequences between −740/−528 mediated the response to transforming growth factor β (28Hua X. Liu X. Ansari D.O. Lodish H.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3084-3095Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). A glucocorticoid response element was identified at −1212 (29Bruzdzinski C.J. Johnson M.R. Goble C.A. Winograd S.S.

Two hypoxia response elements were identified at −175/−158 whose mutation eliminated the 3-fold response to hypoxia (30Kietzmann T. Roth U. Jungermann K.

Insulin or proinsulin infusion can cause local elevation of PAI-1 detected by analysis of PAI-1 protein levels (33Samad F. Pandey M. Bell P. Loskutoff D. Mol.

Bode C. Sobel B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 1535-1543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Insulin also increases expression of the endogenous PAI-1 gene in HepG2 cells (37Nordt T. Schneider D. Sobel B. Circulation. 1994; 89: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and the transcription of a luciferase reporter plasmid under control of the PAI-1 promoter in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) in culture (38Grenett H.

Brown S. Booyse F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 1504-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The insulin response element was suggested to be in the region −98/−62, but this was never confirmed by mutational analysis of the PAI-1 promoter (40Banfi C. Eriksson P. Giandomenico G. Mussoni L. Sironi L. Hamsten A. Tremoli E. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1522-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, the location of the insulin response element of the PAI-1 promoter has not been well defined.A number of potential transcription factor-binding sites in the proximal PAI-1 promoter were mutated to determine which of these mediated the insulin response. Mutation of a sequence resembling the negative insulin response elements found in the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylkinase/IGF-I-binding protein promoters eliminated insulin activation of PAI-1. Gel mobility shifts demonstrated that GST fusion proteins with the Forkhead DNA-binding domain bound to this element, but did not bind to a non-functional mutant of this sequence. Expression of the DNA-binding domain of Forkhead acted as a dominant negative inhibitor of insulin-increased PAI-1 gene expression. Insulin-increased expression of a LexA-CAT reporter in cells expressing a LexA-Forkhead fusion protein. Finally, PI 3-kinase inhibition abrogated insulin-increased PAI-1 gene transcription. This is consistent with activation through a Forkhead-related protein and with data on insulin activation of PAI-1 (40Banfi C. Eriksson P. Giandomenico G. Mussoni L. Sironi L. Hamsten A. Tremoli E. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1522-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONDeletions and mutations of the PAI-1 promoter have identified the sequence −52/−43 as an insulin response element. Deletions from the 5′ direction retained insulin responsiveness until −52 was reached. This is at the 3′ end of the AP-1 site within the PAI-1 promoter, suggesting that the AP-1 element is not the primary insulin response element. Deletion from the 3′ direction to −7 also retained insulin responsiveness. Mutations of the Ets-related elements, of the AP-1 site, or of the Sp-1 sites of the PAI-1 promoter did not affect insulin signaling. Only mutation of the sequence −52/−43 (TCTATTTCCT) eliminated insulin-increased PAI-1-Cat expression. Thus this sequence constitutes the primary insulin response element.The insulin response element of the PAI-1 promoter resembles that found in genes negatively regulated by insulin such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylkinase (TGGTGTTTTGAC) (54O'Brien R.M. Bonovich M.T. Forest C.D. Granner D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6580-6584Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) or IGF-I binding protein 1 (AACTTATTTTGAA) (55Suwanichkul A. Cubbage M.L. Powell D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21185-21193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This was surprising because all of the positive response elements that we had defined previously had been Ets-related-binding sites and Ets-related sites were present in the PAI-1 promoter (56Jacob K.K. Ouyang L. Stanley F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27773-27779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, specific mutation of these sites demonstrated that they were not the insulin response element of the PAI-1 promoter. It is possible that the context in which the Ets sites are located is important for their being able to function as insulin response elements. The genes in which we have definitively shown that the Ets site constitutes the insulin response element all have important CAAT/enhancer-binding protein sites. The PAI-1 promoter is without such a site and instead has Sp1 and AP1 sites in the promoter. Alternately, the Sp-1 binding may interfere with Ets factor binding.Sp-1- and AP-1-binding sites are present in the PAI-1 proximal promoter. The Sp-1 sites are at −72/−67 and −45/−40 while the AP-1 site is at −61/−54. The AP-1 site was reported to mediate the effects of both cAMP and phorbol esters on PAI-1 transcription (26Knudsen H. Olesen T. Riccio A. Ungaro P. Christensen L. Andreasen P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This site was not important for insulin responses since deletion to −52 had only a slight effect on the insulin response and specific mutation of this sequence in the context of the PAI-1 promoter −245/+72 did not decrease insulin-activated transcription of the PAI-1 promoter. However, it is possible that phorbol esters and cAMP may modulate insulin action through effects mediated by this sequence. We have not yet examined these potential interactions that could be important for explaining how insulin and inflammatory responses combine to effect PAI-1 gene transcription.Several experiments suggested that a winged helix/Forkhead-related transcription factor mediated the effects of insulin on the PAI-1 promoter. First, FKHR bound to the PAI-1 promoter (Fig. 5). Expression of the FKHR dbd (Fig. 6) eliminated insulin-increased PAI-1-CAT activity. Finally, a LexA construct containing the C terminus of FKHR was insulin responsive (Fig. 7). However, studies by others (53Nakae J. Park B.C. Accili D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15982-15985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 57Rena G. Prescott A.R. Guo S. Cohen P. Unterman T.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar,58Tomizawa M. Kumar A. Perrot V. Nakae J. Accili D. Rechler M.M. Kumaro A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7289-7295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) demonstrated that FKHR phosphorylation in response to insulin caused its exclusion from the nucleus. This prevented FKHR from activating transcription and suggested that FKHR was not itself responsible for insulin-increased PAI-1 transcription. The identification of FKHR mRNA in insulin responsive, as well as non-responsive, cell types (Fig. 8) supported this. Thus, it seemed likely that some other member of the Forkhead family mediated insulin-increased PAI-1 gene expression. The FKHR-related family of winged helix transcription factors is large, containing more than 100 members to date (59Kaestner K.H. Knochel W. Martinez D.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 142-146PubMed Google Scholar). This group contains both cell type-specific as well as ubiquitous transcription factors. The insulin-responsive factor responsible for activating PAI-1 expression could be one of these or a novel factor containing the winged helix DNA-binding domain.The insulin responsiveness of the LexA-FKHR construct indicated that this was plausible. LexA-CAT activity was increased 6-fold by insulin in GH4 cells transfected with LexA-FKHR. This was significantly less than the responses seen with LexA-Elk and LexA-Sap under similar conditions, but it is comparable with insulin-increased PAI-1-CAT expression. The LexA-FKHR construct used here did not include serine 253 that was phosphorylated in response to insulin in a PI 3-kinase/Akt-dependent manner (53Nakae J. Park B.C. Accili D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15982-15985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of this serine led to nuclear export of FKRH and inhibition of the activity of the FKHR activated genes. The behavior of the LexA-FKHR fusion protein has important implications for understanding insulin-activated PAI-1 transcription. First, it shows that FKHR and presumably the FKHR related factor that mediates the insulin response can be activated by insulin. This is contrary to previous reports (see below). It also supports the conclusion from experiments with dominant negatives of PKB/AKT that PKB/AKT is not required for insulin-activated PAI-1 transcription.Insulin activation of FKHR was not seen using Gal4-FKHR fusion proteins that contained part of the DNA-binding and the C-terminal activation domains of FKHR (58Tomizawa M. Kumar A. Perrot V. Nakae J. Accili D. Rechler M.M. Kumaro A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7289-7295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It is possible that the discrepancy between our results arise from differences in the LexA and Gal4 DNA-binding and expression systems. Insulin may activate FKHR if its promoter binding is strong enough for it to be retained in the nucleus despite signals for its export. Whether insulin activates or represses a gene could depend on the strength of the response element. The LexA system may provide a stronger DNA binding/dimerization domain than Gal4 or the LexA response element of the reporter may be stronger than the Gal4 response element used in those studies (58Tomizawa M. Kumar A. Perrot V. Nakae J. Accili D. Rechler M.M. Kumaro A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7289-7295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Alternately, an accessory protein may be required for nuclear export of the FKHR fusion proteins and this might not be present in the cell lines that we examined. Studies showing the importance of 14-3-3 proteins for nuclear export of FKHR support this possibility (48Cahill C.M. Tzivion G. Nasrin N. Ogg S. Dore J. Ruvkun G. Alexander-Bridges M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13402-13410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 57Rena G. Prescott A.R. Guo S. Cohen P. Unterman T.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar).The activation of PAI-1-CAT expression by insulin is inhibited by LY294002 and by overexpression of PTEN (Fig. 9, A and B). This implied that insulin signaled through PI 3-kinase activation. PI 3-kinase was shown to activate PDK-1, which activated PKB/Akt. This suggested that protein kinase B/Akt might phosphorylate the insulin-responsive transcription factor. Expression of mutated Akt that acted as a dominant negative in other systems failed to block insulin-increased PAI-1-CAT expression (Fig. 9C) implying either that PKB/Akt does not phosphorylate the insulin-responsive transcription factor or that the PKB/Akt phosphorylation is not functional in the cell lines tested. If insulin acted through a different kinase to phosphorylate FKHR at a site(s) other than Ser253, then the export signal would not be activated while FKHR transcriptional activity increased, explaining how insulin could activate transcription through FKHR.PAI-1-luciferase was expressed in all of the cell lines tested (Fig. 1), while insulin stimulation was only observed in GH4, HeLa, HepG2, 3T3, and HUVEC cells. The lack of insulin stimulation in Rat-2 and CHO cells might be secondary to an incomplete insulin-signaling pathway in those cells. The lack of an important downstream kinase would make the promoter unresponsive to insulin. However, previous experiments demonstrated that CHO and Rat-2 cells exhibited insulin-increased promoter expression using different reporter genes (50Jacob K.K. Stanley F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24931-24936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Another explanation for the lack of insulin-responsive PAI-1-CAT expression is the lack of the insulin-responsive transcription factor. This could be an insulin modified member of the Forkhead family that activates at the sequence −52/−43. It is intriguing to speculate that this might be a cell type-specific factor since PAI-1-luciferase expression was not insulin activated in all cell lines tested. Finally, it might be an accessory factor for the insulin-modified transcription factor that is not present in all cell types.It is important to conclusively identify the insulin-responsive transcription factor. The experiments presented above suggest that this factor may be a forkhead-related/winged helix transcription factor. The cell type experiments suggested that GH4 cells could be the most useful for isolating this factor. Experiments to determine the size of the factor that binds to the insulin response element of the PAI-1 promoter are currently in progress as a prelude to identifying it from an appropriate cDNA library.

A Ca2+ complex is seen in the minor groove opposite the junction but is related to the B conformation of the stacked arms.

Thus, this direct interaction is not absolutely required to stabilize the junction at the previously defined ACC trinucleotide core. The more compact methylated junction forces the Na+ of the protected central cavity of the nonmethylated junction into a solvent cluster that spans the space between the junction crossover and the stacked arms. A series of void volumes within the methylated and the nonmethylated structures suggests that small monovalent cations can fill and vacate this central cavity without the need to unfold the four-stranded Holliday junction completely.

A four-stranded DNA complex was first proposed by Holliday as the key intermediate to effect strand exchange during homologous recombination (1Holliday R. Genet. Res. 1964; 5: 282-304Crossref Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). Consequently, the structure of the Holliday junction is recognized as an important component in a number of cellular processes, including the exchange of genetic material between homologous regions in chromosomes and during repair of or replication through DNA lesions (for review, see Refs. 2Smith G.R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 243-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar and 3Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 53-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the product of the human breast cancer-associated BRCA2 gene (4Xia F. Taghian D.G. DeFrank J.S. Zeng Z.-C. Willers H. Iliakis G. Powell S.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8644-8649Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) has been shown to promote homologous recombination, whereas the BLM gene product associated with Bloom's syndrome displays junction binding and corresponding antirecombinase activity (5Karow J.K. Constantinou A., Li, J.-L. West S.C. Hickson I.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6504-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In recent years, the detailed single crystal structures of junctions have been determined by x-ray crystallography in a series of DNA constructs (for review, see Ref. 6Ho P.S. Eichman B.F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A comparison of these structures shows a certain degree of conformational flexibility and sequence specificity in their formation. We report here a high resolution single crystal structure of the Holliday junction in a sequence that incorporates a methylated cytosine. The structure shows that both the interactions at the core and the geometry relating the DNA arms that extend from the junction are variable, suggesting flexibility in the types of sequences that can be accommodated by the junction and flexibility in the detailed conformation of the junction itself.The structure of Holliday junctions has been the subject of biochemical studies since the 1960s (for recent review, see Ref. 7Lilley D.M.J. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2000; 33: 109-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In solution, the conformation is known to adopt an extended open X form under low salt conditions but will collapse to the more compact stacked X form in the presence of both monovalent and multivalent cations (Fig. 1a). Thus, interaction with ions is important in defining the conformation of these four-stranded complexes. The intrinsic structure of DNA junctions has only recently been seen in detail in the single crystal structures of two DNA·RNA complexes (8Nowakowski J. Shim P.J. Prasad G.S. Stout C.D. Joyce G.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 9Nowakowski J. Shim P.J. Stout C.D. Joyce G.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the mismatched sequence d(CCGGGACCGG) (10Ortiz-Lombardı́a M. González A. Eritja R. Aymamı́ J. Azorı́n F. Coll M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), the symmetric sequence d(CCGGTACCGG) (11Eichman B.F. Vargason J.M. Mooers B.H.M. Ho P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3971-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and the psoralen adducts of the sequences d(CCGGTACCGG) and d(CCGCTAGCGG) (12Eichman B.F. Mooers B.H.M. Alberti M. Hearst J.E. Ho P.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). All of these structures adopt the stacked X form, but comparisons among the different structures clearly show that there is a large degree of conformational variability in four-way junctions. The DNA·RNA complexes show that the orientation between the stacked arms across the junction (the interduplex angle, Fig. 1b) can be either right-handed, as seen in solution, or left-handed. This high degree of flexibility may be associated with one arm being extremely short (1 bp) in these constructs, although an atomic force microscopy study suggests that this angle may be dependent on the local electrostatic interactions between the arms (13Sha R. Liu F. Millar D.P. Seeman N.C. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 743-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This interduplex angle was seen to be affected by drug binding, with a 41° interduplex angle seen in the d(CCGGTACCGG) structure, but a shallower 38° angle in the psoralen adducts of the two related sequences. All of these angles are much shallower than the ∼60° estimated from anomalous gel migration (14Cooper J.P. Hagerman P.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 711-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies in solution (15Clegg R.M. Murchie A.I.H. Zechel A. Carlberg C. Diekmann S. Lilley D.M.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4846-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and by atomic force microscopy (16Mao C. Sun W. Seeman N.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 5437-5443Crossref Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Thus, the Holliday junction shows some degree of conformational flexibility, at least in this angle relating the orientation of the stacked arms.A comparison of the two junction forming sequences d(CCGGGACCGG) and d(CCGGTACCGG) with similar sequences that have been crystallized as standard B-DNA duplexes identified a common A6pC7pC8 trinucleotide core for the Holliday junction in this crystal system (11Eichman B.F. Vargason J.M. Mooers B.H.M. Ho P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3971-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). These crystal structures suggest that a number of interactions are associated with this core sequence, including i) a direct hydrogen bonding interaction between the N4 amino group of cytosine C8 and the phosphate of C7 on the major groove side of the junction crossover; ii) a solvent-mediated hydrogen bond between the keto oxygen of guanine G3 (which complements C8) and the phosphate oxygen of A6 at the opposing minor groove side; and iii) a sodium ion that sits within the junction, coordinated to the two phosphate oxygens at A6 (Fig. 2a). It was clear that these interactions, and thus the significance of the ACC trinucleotide core in fixing the junction, are not affected by perturbations from mismatched base pairs or by covalent cross-links to the drug psoralen. Outside of the crossover strands, the conformations of the stacked arms reflect primarily the sequence dependent behavior of the B-DNA double helix. 1B. Eichman, M. Ortiz-Lombardı́a, J. Aymamı́, M.

The relative rotation between the duplexes is shown to be acute in this parent structure, as can be seen by the angle between the vectors that extend from the center of the junction to the two opposite outside strands (red lines). The water molecule observed at the junction in the structure (11Eichman B.F. Vargason J.M. Mooers B.H.M. Ho P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Interactions between the solvent and the DNA atoms are indicated by dashed lines. b, the methylated structure shows smaller roll between duplexes (Jroll, Fig. 1d), resulting in a shallower angle relating the rotation of the duplexes, as seen again by the vectors that extend from the junction center (red lines are from the nonmethylated structure in a, whereas the blue lines represent the vectors of the current methylated structure).

The prediction was that by modifying cytosine C8 with a bulky methyl group, as in the sequence d(CCGGTACm5CGG) (where m5 represents a methyl modification to the C5 carbon of cytosine at the eighth nucleotide position), the direct hydrogen bond from C8 to the phosphates at the crossover would be disrupted, and consequently, the junction would be disrupted. Ironically, this sequence has provided us with the highest resolution structure of a Holliday junction to date. The structure shows how the methyl modification can be accommodated by distortions to both the detailed and gross conformational features of the junction, including the targeted hydrogen bonding interactions, rotational and translational relationships between the stacked arms, and the interactions of monovalent and divalent cations at the junctions and the stacked arms.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA sequences of d(CCGGTACm5CGG) were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer with the trityl-protecting group left intact to facilitate purification by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. The trityl group was removed with 3% acetic acid, and the DNA was desalted on a Sephadex G-25 (Sigma) column, lyophilized, resuspended in 15 mm sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.0), and used for crystallization without further purification. Crystals were grown at room temperature by vapor diffusion in sitting drop setups with initial solutions containing 0.5 mm DNA, 25 mm sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7), 10 mm CaCl2, and 2 mmspermine·4HCl and equilibrated against a reservoir of 20% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. X-ray diffraction data were collected at liquid nitrogen temperatures using 1.15 Å wavelength radiation from beamline 5.0.2 at the Advanced Light Source in Berkeley, CA (Table I). The data set was reduced using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK from the HKL package (18Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Open table in a new tab Crystals of d(CCGGTACm5CGG) grew as thin diamonds (a crystal measured at 0.25 × 0.25 × 0.05 mm3 was used for data collection) and belong to the space group C2 with unit cell dimensions a = 65.5 Å,b = 24.7 Å, c = 37.0 Å, and β = 110.0°. These dimensions are similar to the nonmethylated sequence d(CCGGTACCGG) (a = 66.5 Å, b = 23.5 Å, c = 76.9 Å, β = 114.8°), except that the c axis in the methylated structure is now nearly half that of the parent sequence. The asymmetric unit of the methylated sequence is thus half that of d(CCGGTACCGG), consisting of two rather than four strands of DNA. However, the methylated and nonmethylated structures are not isomorphous, even when this difference in the asymmetric unit is taken into account. The structure of the methylated structure was solved by molecular replacement by applying a directed real space translation/rotation/rigid body search (X-PLOR 3.851 (19Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.1: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR.

The resulting model consisted of two DNA strands (one crossover strand and one noncrossover strand), with the complete four-stranded junction generated by a crystallographic 2-fold axis.The methylated Holliday junction was initially refined with the program CNS (20Brünger A.T.

This junction shares some similarities to the previous all DNA structures of d(CCGGGACCGG) (10Ortiz-Lombardı́a M. González A. Eritja R. Aymamı́ J. Azorı́n F. Coll M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and d(CCGGTACCGG) (11Eichman B.F. Vargason J.M. Mooers B.H.M. Ho P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3971-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). All three form right-handed stacked X junctions with interduplex angles of ∼41°. The methylated junction is composed of all Watson-Crick base pairs like the parent nonmethylated junction in d(CCGGTACCGG), but the presence of the methyl group significantly affects the local structure and hydration at the junction crossovers, which are associated with a global slide along and roll around the helix axes of the stacked duplexes across the Holliday junction.Simply the observation that this methylated sequence forms a junction obviates the absolute necessity of a direct hydrogen bond between the base of cytosine C8 and the phosphate of C7 for a Holliday junction with an ACC core trinucleotide. This would now appear to lift the requirement that a cytosine occupy the third position of the ACC core, which was thought to be important in the crystallization of d(CCGGGACCGG) and d(CCGGTACCGG) as junctions. In introducing a water molecule to mediate this hydrogen bonding interaction, we would expect that the specificity for the hydrogen bond donating N4 amino group of the cytosine would be lost and could be readily replaced by a hydrogen bond accepting keto oxygen (i.e. this cytosine should be replaceable by a thymine base). However, the single crystal structure of the sequence d(CCAGTACTGG), which replaces cytosine C8 at the ACC core with a thymine, has been solved to 0.74 Å resolution as a standard B-DNA double helix (27Kielkopf C.L. Ding S. Kuhn P. Rees D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 787-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, other interactions, perhaps unique base pair stacking interactions or other base pair-specific effects (for example, the inherent large propeller twist of a TA base pair (29El Hassan M.A. Calladine C.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar)), are important in defining the sequence specificity for fixing the position of the junction in these symmetric DNA sequences.With the direct C8 to phosphate hydrogen bond now disrupted in the methylated structure, we can ask how does cytosine methylation affect the stability of four-way DNA junctions? There are currently no biochemical studies to address this question directly, but from the current structure and by analogy to other DNA conformations, we can speculate on the molecular basis for potential stabilizing effects. For example, the methyl groups of pyrimidine bases have been shown to affect the formation of unusual forms of duplex DNA, including A-DNA (30Frederick C.A. Saal D. van der Marel G.A. von Boom J.H. Wang A.H.-J. Rich A. Biopolymers. 1987; 181: S145-S160Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar), Z-DNA (31Behe M. Felsenfeld G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 1619-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar), and an extended and exposed form of the duplex (32Vargason J.M. Eichman B.F. Ho P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). An argument for why the methyl group contributes to thymine being a base that disfavors A-DNA involves the close packing of the thymine CH3 against the C2′ carbon of the ribose on the 5′-adjacent nucleotide to favor the B-DNA structure through hydrophobic effects (33Tolstorukov M.Y. Ivanov V.I. Malenkov G.G. Jernigan R.L. Zhurkin V.B. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 3409-3421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the current structure of the methylated Holliday junction, the methyl group of the C8 cytosine base appears to stack above the C2′ carbon of the adjacent deoxyribose sugar and could perhaps help to stabilize the junction in a similar fashion; however, the long distance between the two carbons (4.3 Å) would seem to minimize the contribution of such an interaction. In addition, the C5 carbon of the cytosine base that is closest to the sugar is actually slightly further from the C2′ carbon in the methylated as opposed to the nonmethylated parent structure (extending from 3.1 Å to 3.5 Å), suggesting that the steric interaction of the CH3 group with the phosphates of the crossover strands impinges on this interaction.In contrast, the stabilization of Z-DNA by cytosine methylation has been attributed to the methyl group being exposed to solvent in B-DNA but partially buried in a hydrophobic pocket of the left-handed Z form (34Ho P.S. Quigley G.J. Tilton R.F., Jr. Rich A. J. Phys. Chem. 1988; 92: 939-945Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the current junction structure, we see that the methyl group is similarly partially protected by the DNA duplex across the junction. One can therefore make a similar argument on the basis of general solvent accessibility that the m5C nucleotide of the ACm5C core of the current structure would facilitate formation of a junction by burying the methyl group, which would otherwise be exposed in B-DNA, within the space between the junction and the stacked arms.The closest atom to the methyl group of the C8 cytosine is the O2P phosphate oxygen of the crossover strand. We would expect this oxygen to carry a partial negative charge, and therefore, we can speculate on the electrostatic effects associated with the methylated base. The positive Hammet-ς constant makes CH3 an electron donating substituent to an aromatic ring (35Hansch C. Leo A. Substituent Constants for Correlation Analysis in Chemistry and Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1979Google Scholar). That this is also true when that ring is a cytosine base can be seen in the elevated p Ka of the methylated nucleotide, specifically under conditions where favorable stacking interactions facilitate hydrogen bonding to a protonated cytosine (C+) in a base triplet (36Leitner D. Schröder W. Weisz K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5886-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) or four-stranded DNA quadraplexes (37Hardin C.C. Corregan M. Brown B.A., II Frederick L.N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5870-5880Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although we see no evidence for participation of a m5C+ base in the DNA junction (a m5C+·G would adopt a wobble conformation, much like that of a mismatched T·G base pair), we would expect that as an electron-donating substituent, the methyl group would carry a partial positive charge. The close proximity of this electron-deficient methyl to the negatively charged phosphate oxygen (C to O distance of 3.53 Å) could provide some electrostatic stabilization to the junction. Comparisons of cytosine nucleotides in A-DNA single crystals show a shorter distance of the phosphate backbone to the methylated versus the nonmethylated base (38Mayer-Jung C. Moras D. Timsit Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2709-2718Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, although we had expected cytosine methylation at the C8 position to disrupt an apparently important hydrogen bond and, consequently, to destabilize the junction, there may be both hydrophobic and weak electrostatic interactions that can compensate for this loss. The degree to which these compensating interactions contribute to the stabilization or destabilization of the junction is yet to be determined.One of the unexpected results from the current structure is that the sodium ion at the center of the nonmethylated d(CCGGTACCGG) junction (11Eichman B.F. Vargason J.M. Mooers B.H.M. Ho P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3971-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) has been displaced from its protected cavity. The placement of this counterion, which would help to balance the negative potential of the very closely positioned phosphates at the junction crossover, is, as with the direct hydrogen bonding interaction, not absolutely required. Rather, this sodium ion is now apparently expelled to the gap between the junction and the stacked duplex arms and is coordinated to the outer O1P oxygens of the same phosphates. This raises two interesting questions. Is the charge neutralization at the crossovers exactly the same in the methylated and nonmethylated junctions, and can a sodium ion enter and exit the four-stranded junction without unfolding the complex?A comparison of the electron densities of the solvent molecules (S1–S4) at the methylated junction indicates that they are all well ordered but not equally occupied (Fig. 4a). The density around S3 appears to be significantly weaker, and its associated temperature or B factor significantly higher (B factor > 50 Å2) than the surrounding atoms, including those for S1, S2, and S4 (average B factor ≈ 30 Å2). When we assume that the thermal disorder, and thus the B factor of S3 should be similar to the other three solvent molecules in this cluster (which is reasonable because it is interacting with the other solvent molecules and the DNA), the occupancy of S3 can be estimated to be approximately half that of the associated solvent molecules. Furthermore, if our assignment of S3 as a sodium ion is correct, then the total number of monovalent cations at the methylated junction will effectively be identical to that of the nonmethylated junction, which is one sodium ion, either at the central cavity or shared between two sites.There does not appear to be any net change in the neutralization of the negative charges at the junction, with apparently only a single monovalent cation to counterbalance the four negatively charged phosphates. One would expect that sodium ions would be capable of fully occupying both sites available in the methylated junction, thereby reducing the net negative charge of the phosphates at the junction, but we see only a single sodium essentially sharing time in one or the other of the potential sites. Thus, we can ask what is the effective charge of the phosphates at the crossover of the junction in the crystals? At the very most, the two phosphates at A6 would have effective charges of –0.5 to counterbalance the single sodium. The other –0.5 charge must be accounted for somehow to maintain an electrostatically neutral environment. This could come from other, more disordered counterions or, an interesting alternative, from a dramatic shift in the p Ka of the phosphates so that they are partially protonated under neutral conditions. Bringing four negatively charged phosphates in such very close proximity in a solvent-depleted environment could provide sufficient electrostatic energy to perturb the p Ka of the nonesterified oxygens. The more likely explanation is that there are counterions that have not been located even at the high resolution of the current structure. However, each phosphate appears to have a full complement of solvent molecules at its first shell. Thus additional counterions must either be currently assigned as water molecules or acting at a distance (beyond the first hydration shell). This would suggest that direct cation interactions, other than the single sodium ion, are not essential for the crystallization of a stacked X junction.The question of whether the sodium ion is trapped in the nonmethylated d(CCGGTACCGG) structure as the four strands are being assembled cannot be directly addressed here, but a comparison of the void volumes within the methylated and nonmethylated structures (Fig. 5) presents a possible pathway by which a sodium can enter or leave the internal cavity without the need to disassemble the Holliday junction completely. When the junctions were probed with spheres of different sizes, the pocket where the sod"

Messenger RNA degradation is an important mechanism for controlling gene expression in all organisms. The rate of mRNA decay directly affects the steady-state concentration of mRNA, thereby influencing rates of protein synthesis. mRNA lifetimes can differ markedly within a single cell. In Escherichia coli, for example, mRNA half-lives can be as short as a fraction of a minute or as long as an hour, with a typical half-life being 2–4 min (1Belasco J.G. Belasco J.G. Brawerman G. Control of Messenger RNA Stability. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 3-12Crossref Google Scholar). The stability of a given message need not be fixed and may vary in response to growth conditions (2Nilsson G. Belasco J.G. Cohen S.N. von Gabain A.

This endonuclease, 1061 amino acids in length, possesses broad cleavage-site specificity, cutting RNA in a variety of single-stranded regions that are AU-rich (12McDowall K.J. Lin-Chao S. Cohen S.N.

Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1053-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Synthesis of this important endonuclease is tightly controlled by an autoregulatory mechanism that modulates the longevity of the transcript of the RNase E gene (rne) in response to changes in cellular RNase E activity (19Jain C. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 84-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Feedback regulation of RNase E synthesis is mediated in cis by the 361-nucleotide (nt) rne 5′-UTR, which can confer a comparably high degree of sensitivity to cellular RNase E levels onto heterologous mRNAs to which it is fused (19Jain C. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 84-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 20Diwa A. Bricker A.L. Jain C. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1249-1260PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, expression of a reporter gene comprising the rne 5′-UTR and the initial portion of the rne coding region joined in-frame to lacZ can differ by more than 30-fold in cells containing low versus high RNase E activity, and this sensitivity to RNase E is virtually abolished when all of the 5′-UTR upstream of the ribosome binding site is deleted (19Jain C. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 84-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 20Diwa A. Bricker A.L. Jain C. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1249-1260PubMed Google Scholar). The rne 5′-UTR contains six structural domains (Fig. 1), two of which, the stem-loop structures hp2 and hp3, are important for feedback regulation (20Diwa A. Bricker A.L. Jain C. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1249-1260PubMed Google Scholar). Of these two stem-loops, hp2 is the more potent sensor of cellular RNase E activity. When fused directly upstream of the rne ribosome binding site, hp2 alone is sufficient to direct efficient feedback regulation by RNase E (20Diwa A. Bricker A.L. Jain C. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1249-1260PubMed Google Scholar). To better understand the mechanism of RNase E autoregulation, we have used mutational analysis and phylogenetic comparison to examine the features of rne hp2 that are important for its ability to mediate feedback control. These studies indicate that an 8-nt internal loop near the top of hp2 plays a central role in this regulatory process. The isogenic E. coli strains CH1827 (MC1061, rne+zce-726::Tn 10) and CH1828 (MC1061, ams-1 zce-726::Tn 10) are derivatives of MC1061 (araD39 Δ(ara, leu)7697, ΔleuX74 galU−galK− hsr−hsm+ strA) (22Mudd E.A. Higgins C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 557-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). CH1828 carries a chromosomal rne missense mutation (ams-1) that reduces cellular RNase E activity at 37 °C (19Jain C. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 84-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Plasmid pRNE101 is a pACYC177 derivative bearing the wild-type E. coli rne gene; the presence of this multicopy plasmid in CH1827 causes RNase E to be overproduced at ∼2.8 times its normal cellular concentration (19Jain C. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 84-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Plasmid pEZΔ114–337 is a pSC101 derivative bearing an rne-lacZ fusion that comprises the rne promoter, all of the 361-nt rne 5′-UTR except nucleotides 114–337, and the first 181 rne codons fused in-frame to the tenth codon of lacZ (20Diwa A. Bricker A.L. Jain C. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1249-1260PubMed Google Scholar). To construct plasmid pEZ8, a unique ApaI restriction site was created in pEZΔ114–337 by inserting two guanidylate residues between nucleotides 53 and 54 and two cytidylate residues between nucleotides 106 and 107 of the rne 5′-UTR, resulting in two additional G-C base pairs at the base of rne hp2. Plasmid pEZ8hp2Hinf was constructed by inserting a DNA fragment encoding hp2 of Haemophilus influenzae rne mRNA (GGGCCCTGTTGGTGAAAACTCAATGCAGCAATTGGCATAAGACATTGATAATCAACATTAGCTGTACA) between the ApaI and BsrGI restriction sites of pEZ8. In plasmid pEZ8Δhp2, the segment between the ApaI and BsrGI sites of pEZ8, including hp2 and ss2, was replaced with a short linker (GGGCCCGCGGCCCAGTTAGCTGTACA), whereas in pEZ8NcoI, the same pEZ8 segment was replaced with a different linker (GGGCCCGTGCCATGGTGCTGTACA). Plasmids pEZ8hp2mut4, pEZ8hp2mut2T, pEZ8hp2mut3T, and pEZ8hp2mut2B are derivatives of pEZ8 that each encode mutations in the hairpin loop at the top of rne hp2 (AAUG → GGAA, AGAG, AUUCG, and GAUA, respectively). Plasmids pEZ8hp2IL-5U, pEZ8hp2IL-5G, pEZ8hp2IL-2C, and pEZ8hp2IL-2C,3A are derivatives of pEZ8 that each encode mutations in the 8-nt internal loop near the top of rne hp2 (CA—GUAAGA → CA—GUUAGA, CA—GUGAGA, CC—GUAAGA, and CC—AUAAGA, respectively). Plasmid pEZ8hp2+2bp is a pEZ8 derivative encoding a mutant reporter mRNA in which two base pairs have been inserted into the 2-bp stem near the top of rne hp2 (GCAATGGC → GCGCAATGGCGC). Plasmid pEZ8hp2bot-syn was constructed from pEZ8 by replacing the segment between the ApaI and BsrGI sites with the sequenceGGGCCCGCATGCAGCAATGGCGTAAGACATGCGGGCCCAGTTAGCTGTACA. Plasmid pEZ8hp2CG is a pEZ8 derivative that encodes a G-C → C-G base pair substitution just beneath the 8-nt internal loop of hp2. To identify the important nucleotides in the 8-nt internal loop of rne hp2, two combinatorial libraries were created in which the sequence of the top four (hp2IL-top) or bottom four (hp2IL-bot) nucleotides of this internal loop were randomized. Oligonucleotide primer Hp2comp (5′-CGTGGGGGTGTACA-3′, 32 pmol) was annealed to an equimolar amount of either of two complementary primers that encoded the entire hp2-ss2 region: Hp2IL-toplib (5′-CATTTTGGGCCCGACCGATCATCCACGCNGCAATGGCNNNAGACGTATTGATCTTTCAGGCCCAGTTAGCTGTACACCCCCACG-3′) or Hp2IL-botlib (5′-CATTTTGGGCCCGACCGATCATCCACGNAGCAATGGCGTANNNCGTATTGATCTTTCAGGCCCAGTTAGCTGTACACCCCCACG-3′). The annealed oligonucleotides were extended for 1 h at 37 °C with T4 DNA polymerase (10 units) and all four dNTPs (250 μm each) in T4 DNA polymerase buffer (New England BioLabs). The extended products (86 bp) were purified using a High Pure purification kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), digested with ApaI and BsrGI, repurified, and ligated between the ApaI and BsrGI sites of pEZ8NcoI. Each library was transformed into competent E. coli WM1/F′ cells containing plasmid pRNE101, and the cells were plated on LB-agar supplemented with X-gal (60 μg/ml), ampicillin (100 μg/ml), and kanamycin (100 μg/ml). The high level of RNase E activity present in these cells allowed reporter mRNAs sensitive to RNase E overproduction to be identified by their pale color when compared with otherwise identical cells containing pEZ8 (white colonies) or pEZ8Δhp2 (blue colonies). Reporter plasmids sensitive to RNase E overproduction were purified and transformed into E. coli strains CH1828 and CH1827 + pRNE101 for quantitative measurements of β-galactosidase activity. β-Galactosidase assays were performed as previously described (21Jain C. Belasco J.G. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 318: 309-332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For each rne-lacZ reporter, a repression ratio was calculated by dividing the β-galactosidase activity in CH1828 host cells (low RNase E activity) by the β-galactosidase activity in CH1827 + pRNE101 host cells (high RNase E activity). The reported repression ratios are each the average of three or more measurements. Error estimates correspond to the standard deviation of these measurements. The computer program RNAbob (available at www.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/software/#rnabob) was used to search for elements resembling rne hp2 in the genomes of E. coli, Yersinia pestis, and Haemophilus influenzae (genomic sequence files downloaded from ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria). The search parameters specified an 8-nt internal loop consisting of the sequence CD—RUHAGA (where D = A, G, or U; R = A or G; H = A, C, or U), flanked below by a ≥3-bp stem and above by a 2-bp stem and a 4- to 6-nt hairpin loop whose sequence was not constrained. Strict search criteria allowed only canonical base pairs in the 3- and 2-bp stems, as observed in nature. Only elements present on the coding strand of each gene were considered. Autoregulation of RNase E synthesis is mediated by rne hp2, an RNA stem-loop that functions post-transcriptionally as a sensor of cellular RNase E activity (20Diwa A. Bricker A.L. Jain C. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1249-1260PubMed Google Scholar). Elucidating the essential features of this 57-nt 5′-UTR element would be useful not only for understanding the mechanism of RNase E feedback regulation but also for efforts to identify other genes whose expression might be similarly regulated by this important ribonuclease. Despite extensive sequence divergence, the 5′-UTR of the Haemophilus influenzae and E. coli rne transcripts share significant secondary-structure homology (20Diwa A. Bricker A.L. Jain C. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1249-1260PubMed Google Scholar). We first wished to address whether hp2 of Haemophilus rne mRNA could substitute functionally for the corresponding E. coli stem-loop in mediating RNase E feedback regulation in E. coli. These studies were performed in the context of an rne-lacZ reporter (ezΔ114–337; Fig. 2) in which all of the E. coli rne 5′-UTR, except hp3, and the first 181 codons of the rne coding region were fused in-frame to lacZ. Expression of ezΔ114–337 in E. coli is very sensitive to the cellular level of RNase E activity, which modulates the longevity of the reporter transcript (19Jain C. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 84-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 20Diwa A. Bricker A.L. Jain C. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1249-1260PubMed Google Scholar). Previous experiments have shown that, in the absence of hp3, feedback regulation of rne-lacZ expression is almost entirely dependent on the presence of hp2, thereby allowing the effects of hp2 mutations to be fully manifested (20Diwa A. Bricker A.L. Jain C. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1249-1260PubMed Google Scholar). To facilitate the construction of hp2 substitution mutants, we first introduced two additional G-C base pairs at the base of hp2 to create a unique ApaI restriction site (GGGCCC) in the reporter gene (Fig. 2). These additional base pairs did not significantly affect the sensitivity of the reporter mRNA to feedback regulation by RNase E, as determined by comparing β-galactosidase production from this new reporter (ez8) in isogenic lacZ−E. coli host strains with low (CH1828) or high (CH1827 + pRNE101) levels of cellular RNase E activity. The observed repression ratio (R, the ratio of β-galactosidase activity in the CH1828 host versus the CH1827 + pRNE101 host), which is a direct measure of the degree to which expression of the rne-lacZ fusion can be inhibited by RNase E, was approximately the same for ez8 (R = 10.4 ± 2.0) and the original ezΔ114–337 reporter (R = 11.1 ± 2.1). As expected, when hp2 was instead replaced with an unrelated stem-loop (UUGGGCCCGCGGCCCAG), sensitivity to cellular RNase E activity was nearly abolished (R = 2.4 ± 0.2 for ez8Δhp2). We then replaced hp2 of ez8 with the corresponding stem-loop of the H. influenzae rne transcript (ez8hp2Hinf; Fig. 2). Despite numerous differences in sequence and secondary structure between the Haemophilus and E. coli stem-loops, this hp2 replacement had almost no effect on feedback regulation (R = 9.8 ± 2.3). This finding suggests that the features of hp2 that are critical for feedback regulation in E. coli are conserved in the Haemophilus stem-loop. To determine which of the conserved features of rne hp2 are most important for feedback regulation, this stem-loop was divided conceptually into three subdomains. One was an 8-nt internal loop near the top of hp2, a region of the stem-loop whose sequence is especially well conserved between Haemophilus and E. coli(Fig. 2). The other two subdomains were the hairpin loop and 2-bp stem above this internal loop and the long imperfect stem below it. Each of these subdomains was examined by mutational analysis. To identify which nucleotides in the 8-nt internal loop of E. coli rne hp2 (CA—GUAAGA) are most important for feedback regulation, we created two combinatorial libraries in which the sequence of each half of the internal loop was randomized in the context of the ez8 reporter (hp2IL-top: CN2—N3N4N5AGA and hp2IL-bot: N1A—GUAN6N7N8). We chose to divide the internal loop into halves, as the maximum complexity of each library would equal 256 (44), a relatively manageable number of sequence combinations. In contrast, simultaneously randomizing all eight positions in a single library would greatly increase the potential complexity of the library to 65,536 (48), making it much less likely that all sequence combinations would be represented. The libraries were each transformed into E. coli cells containing a high concentration of RNase E due to the presence of a multicopy rne plasmid (pRNE101). The high level of RNase E activity in these cells allowed reporter mRNAs susceptible to feedback repression to be identified on the basis of the pale color of bacterial colonies grown on LB-agar plates containing the chromogenic β-galactosidase substrate X-gal. The color of these transformants was compared with that of colonies with an rne-lacZ reporter either containing (ez8) or lacking (ez8Δhp2) a functional hp2 sequence. Reporter plasmids were purified from colonies that were as pale as those containing the parent plasmid (pEZ8) and retransformed into isogenic E. coli strains containing low or high RNase E activity. For each plasmid, a repression ratio was calculated by comparing levels of β-galactosidase activity in the two host strains. A total of 1202 colonies were screened from the hp2IL-bot library (CA—GUAAGA → N1A—GUAN6N7N8). Nearly all of these colonies were as blue as colonies expressing a reporter deficient for feedback regulation (ez8Δhp2). This finding seemed to imply that the sequence requirements for the bottom half of the internal loop were strict. Indeed, only two colonies in this combinatorial library contained reporters with repression ratios similar to that of a reporter (ez8) that has a wild-type internal loop sequence (R = 12.7 ± 1.9 for hp2IL-bot#7 and 15.2 ± 3.4 for hp2IL-bot#8 versus 10.4 ± 2.0 for ez8; Fig. 3). DNA sequencing revealed that the internal loops of these two reporters were identical in sequence to that of wild-type E. coli hp2. These results indicate that only the wild-type sequence of nucleotides is tolerated at positions N1 (C), N6 (A), N7 (G), and N8 (A) of the internal loop. In contrast to the hp2IL-bot library, the hp2IL-top library (CA—GUAAGA → CN2—N3N4N5AGA) gave rise to colonies with a wide range of color intensities on X-gal plates. Among a total of 3580 colonies, several contained reporter genes that were functional for feedback regulation (defined as having a repression ratio greater than 6.0), with repression ratios ranging from 7 to 15. This variation in the repression ratios suggested more relaxed sequence requirements in the upper half of the internal loop. Sequencing of eleven library members that were functional for feedback regulation confirmed this prediction (Fig. 4). Although the nucleotide at position N4 (U) was invariant, sequence variation was observed at positions N2 (A, G, or U), N3 (A or G), and N5 (A, C, or U). Although the wild-type E. coli sequence was not isolated in this screen, the repeated isolation of four variants (hp2IL-2G, hp2IL-2U, hp2IL-3A, and hp2IL-5C) suggested that we had identified most internal loop sequences in the library that were competent for feedback regulation. Additional information about the key features of the internal loop was gleaned from close inspection of the repression ratios for each functional sequence variant within the hp2IL-top library and from the creation of additional site-directed mutants. For example, the potential for Watson-Crick base pairing between positions N2 and N3 appears to partially impair the ability of hp2 to mediate feedback regulation. In the double mutant hp2IL-2U, 3A (CA—GUAAGA → CU—AUAAGA), where Watson-Crick base pairing is possible between uracil at N2 and adenine at N3, there is a 35% reduction in the repression ratio relative to the wild-type sequence (R = 6.9 ± 0.4 for hp2IL-2U, 3A versus 10.4 ± 2.0 for ez8; Fig. 4). In contrast, the same substitutions made individually at N2 or N3 lack the potential for Watson-Crick base pairing and have no detrimental effect on feedback regulation (R = 10.6 ± 1.3 for hp2IL-2U and 12.6 ± 0.8 for hp2IL-3A; Fig. 4). In none of the functional sequence variants was cytosine observed at N2. Although cytosine at this position would be capable of pairing with a wild-type guanine base at N3, it would not be able to form a Watson-Crick base pair with adenine at N3, a nucleotide substitution that is itself well-tolerated (hp2IL-3A in Fig. 4). To determine the effect of cytosine at N2 in either of these sequence contexts, we constructed two additional variants: hp2IL-2C (CA—GUAAGA → CC—GUAAGA) and hp2IL-2C,3A(CA—GUAAGA → CC—AUAAGA). In the context of guanine at N3, the presence of cytosine at N2 severely impaired feedback regulation, causing the reporter to be scarcely more sensitive to cellular RNase E activity than a reporter lacking hp2 altogether (R = 3.6 ± 0.2 for hp2IL-2C versus 2.4 ± 0.2 for ez8Δhp2; Fig. 5). Eliminating the potential for Watson-Crick base pairing between N2 and N3 by substituting both cytosine at N2 and adenine at N3 resulted in only a partial restoration of feedback regulation (R = 4.7 ± 0.4 for hp2IL-2C,3A versus 3.6 ± 0.2 for hp2IL-2C and 12.6 ± 0.8 for hp2IL-3A; Figs.4 and 5). These findings indicate that cytosine is intrinsically not well tolerated at position N2, quite apart from its base pairing potential. Position N5 shows considerable sequence flexibility, with adenine (wild-type), cytosine, or uracil present at this position in functional transcripts. The reporter transcript with cytosine at position N5 was fully sensitive to feedback repression by RNase E (R = 10.7 ± 0.6 for hp2IL-5C; Fig. 4). The presence of uracil at this position only partially impaired feedback regulation when this substitution was accompanied by guanine at position N2, which by itself does not affect feedback regulation (R = 6.8 ± 0.7 for hp2IL-2G,5U versus 14.7 ± 1.2 for hp2IL-2G; Fig. 4). The same uracil substitution had a more deleterious effect in the context of the naturally occurring adenine at position N2 (R = 4.1 ± 0.2 for hp2IL-5U; Fig. 5). Introducing guanine at position N5 severely impaired feedback regulation (R= 1.9 ± 0.2 for hp2IL-5G; Fig. 5), as expected from the absence of this substitution among the functional reporters in the hp2IL-top library (Fig. 4). Other nucleotide substitutions that did not appear among the functional hp2 variants in the hp2IL-top and hp2IL-bot libraries (IL-4G, IL-6U, IL-7U, IL-7A) were likewise found to be deleterious for feedback regulation (Fig. 5). Other features of rne hp2 that may contribute to feedback regulation include the hairpin loop (AAUG) and 2-bp stem at the top. The importance of the hairpin loop was evaluated by mutational analysis (Fig. 6). Mutating all four nucleotides of this loop (hp2mut4: AAUG → GGAA) significantly impaired but did not abolish feedback regulation (R = 4.7 ± 0.4 for hp2mut4 versus 2.4 ± 0.2 for ez8Δhp2), as did replacing only the top two nucleotides of the loop with two dissimilar nucleotides (hp2mut2T: AAUG → AGAG; R = 4.8 ± 0.5). Nonetheless, there is no sequence feature of the hairpin loop that is absolutely required. Thus, substituting three dissimilar nucleotides for the top two nucleotides of the loop (hp2mut3T: AAUG → AUUCG) did not impair feedback regulation (R = 9.9 ± 1.0), and mutating the bottom two nucleotides of the loop (hp2mut2B:AAUG → GAUA) caused only a mild reduction in the repression ratio (R = 8.4 ± 0.8). These findings indicate that the hairpin loop at the top of rne hp2 makes a significant contribution to feedback regulation by RNase E but in a manner that cannot readily be predicted by merely examining the loop sequence. A significant regulatory defect was also observed when the 2-bp stem that separates the hairpin loop from the 8-nt internal loop was doubled in length (R = 4.0 ± 0.5 for hp2+2bp), suggesting that the distance and orientation of the hairpin loop with respect to the internal loop are also important. The internal loop and hairpin loop of E. coli rne hp2 sit atop a tall, imperfectly base-paired stem. To determine whether the sequence of this lower portion of hp2 contributes to feedback regulation, we replaced all of hp2 below the internal loop (a total of 41 nucleotides, including 14 Watson-Crick and wobble (G-U) base pairs and three small internal loops) with 13 base pairs differing in sequence from wild-type at all but the three bottom-most positions and the position immediately beneath the internal loop (hp2bot-syn; Fig. 7). The resulting reporter transcript remained fully sensitive to feedback regulation (R = 12.1 ± 0.3). The ez8 reporter also retained its sensitivity to feedback regulation when the G-C base pair directly below the internal loop was mutated to a C-G pair (hp2CG; R = 9.1 ± 1.0). These findings indicate that neither the sequence of the stem below the internal loop of rne hp2 nor the base-pairing imperfections within this lower stem are important for efficient feedback regulation in E. coli. The mutational studies described above identify features of rne hp2 that are important for RNase E autoregulation in E. coli. Natural sequence variation among bacterial species provides an independent source of information as to the key features of this stem-loop. We compared the sequences of rne hp2 from nine species (Fig. 8). These phylogenetic data indicate that the sequence and secondary structure of the upper portion of hp2, comprising the internal loop, the hairpin loop, and the 2-bp stem between them, is conserved in evolution and therefore likely to have an important function. Especially well conserved in sequence is the 8-nt internal loop, which has the consensus sequence CD—RUAAGA (where D = A, G, or U and R = A or G, with no potential for Watson-Crick base pairing between these two nucleotides). Except for the absence of phylogenetic variation at N5, this consensus sequence agrees perfectly with the results of mutational analysis. Also well conserved in length and sequence is the 2-bp stem above this internal loop, consistent with our finding that feedback regulation is impaired when this short stem is extended. The hairpin loop at the top of rne hp2 shows somewhat greater evolutionary variation, ranging in size from four to five nucleotides with the consensus sequence AN(N)NG (where N is a nucleotide of unspecified identity). The lack of sequence variation at the first and last positions of the hairpin loop is unexpected in view of our finding that these two nucleotides can be mutated without adversely affecting feedback regulation in E. coli. Except for the highly conserved G-C base pair immediately beneath the internal loop, the lower portion of hp2 shows the greatest variability in sequence and secondary structure, ranging in size from 32 nt (including 12 base pairs) to 41 nt (including 17 base pairs) and bearing diverse internal loops at disparate locations. This high degree of variability is in agreement with our finding that the sequence and secondary structure of the lower stem of hp2 can be changed significantly without impairing feedback regulation. An important step in elucidating post-transcriptional gene regulation is to identify the features of mRNAs that determine their lifetimes in vivo. Previous studies have shown that RNase E tightly autoregulates its synthesis in E. coli via a mechanism in which rne hp2, a sensory element within the 5′-UTR, modulates rne mRNA longevity in response to changes in cellular RNase E activity (19Jain C. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 84-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 20Diwa A. Bricker A.L. Jain C. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1249-1260PubMed Google Scholar). We have now identified evolutionarily conserved features in the upper portion of rne hp2 that are crucial for its ability to mediate efficient feedback regulation of RNase E synthesis. These include an 8-nt internal loop and the 2-bp stem and hairpin loop above it. The core recognition element within rne hp2 is an internal loop comprising two nucleotides on one strand and six nucleotides on the other. Point mutations within this internal loop can abolish hp2 function in E. coli. At five of the eight positions (N1 = C; N4 = U; N6 = A; N7 = G; N8 = A), no sequence variation is tolerated, whereas at three other positions (N2 = A, G, or U; N3 = A or G; N5 = A, C, or U) some sequence variation is permitted (Fig. 9A). Consistent with these findings is the limited sequence variation that occurs naturally for this rne internal loop in several related bacterial species, where the sequence is strictly conserved at six of the eight positions and observed to vary only at positions N2 (A, G, or U) and N3 (A or G) (Fig. 9B). Above the internal loop of rne hp2, between nucleotides N2 and N3, are a 2-bp stem and a 4–5 nt hairpin loop that also contribute to hp2 recognition. In the rne transcripts of related bacterial species, the sequence of this hairpin loop varies at all but the first and last positions (Fig. 9B). Nonetheless, nucleotide substitutions at these two conserved positions can have little effect on hp2 function in E. coli, whereas substitutions at the nonconserved positions can significantly reduce the efficiency of feedback regulation when they deviate from variations observed naturally in other bacterial species (Figs. 6 and 8; note that the hairpin loop of hp2mut3T is identical to that of rne hp2 in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, whereas the hairpin loop of hp2mut2T is unlike any known hp2 variant in nature). The length of the short stem between the hairpin loop and internal loop is critical, hp2 function being markedly impaired by increasing the size of this stem from 2 to 4 bp (Fig. 6). On the other hand, the sequence of this 2-bp stem is inconsequential (20Diwa A. Bricker A.L. Jain C. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1249-1260PubMed Google Scholar) despite its evolutionary conservation. Together, these findings suggest that the shape of the short stem and hairpin loop at the top of hp2 may be more important for recognition than their sequence per se and that the crucial features of this shape have been conserved during evolution despite sequence divergence. The 8-nt internal loop of hp2 is situated atop a tall, imperfectly paired stem whose sequence, mispairings, and length are poorly conserved in evolution. Our data show that the sequence of this lower stem, including a highly conserved G-C base pair directly beneath the 8-nt internal loop, is unimportant (Fig. 7). Consequently, this portion of hp2 can be replaced with a perfectly base-paired stem having a different sequence without affecting feedback regulation. The lower stem of hp2 may serve simply as a pedestal for the upper portion of hp2, helping to ensure its proper folding and to improve its accessibility to the cellular factor that mediates its function. Together, our findings suggest a model for rne hp2 recognition in which RNase E or a hypothetical protein cofactor makes intimate, sequence-specific contact with the 8-nt internal loop and backbone contact with the upper stem and hairpin loop (Fig. 9C). In vitro experiments suggest that hp2 itself is not a target for RNase E cleavage. 2A. Diwa and J. G. Belasco, unpublished data. Nonetheless, by increasing the local concentration of RNase E, binding to hp2 could help the ribonuclease gain access to one or more cleavage sites elsewhere in the rne transcript, thereby accelerating rne mRNA degradation. The fact that base pairs can be removed from (hp2bot-syn) or added to (ez8) the bottom of hp2 without impairing its function suggests that the precise spatial relationship between the upper portion of this stem-loop and other regions of the rne 5′-UTR is relatively inconsequential. Besides hp2, the only other domain of the rne 5′-UTR that is known to contribute appreciably to feedback regulation is rne hp3 (Fig. 1); however, this branched stem-loop is not required, and its role is not known (20Diwa A. Bricker A.L. Jain C. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1249-1260PubMed Google Scholar). Previous experiments have shown that a putative RNase E cleavage site in the single-stranded segment (ss1) that precedes hp2 can be removed without impairing regulation (19Jain C. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 84-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 20Diwa A. Bricker A.L. Jain C. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1249-1260PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, the rne coding region appears not to contribute in cis to feedback regulation, because an rne-lacZ reporter in which the fifth rne codon has been fused to lacZ is tightly regulated by RNase E (23Diwa A. Autoregulation of RNase E: Features of rne Messenger RNA and RNase E That Are Important for Feedback RegulationPh.D. thesis. New York University, 2001Google Scholar). In comparison to a number of other E. coli genes, expression of the rne gene is unusually sensitive to the cellular level of RNase E activity (19Jain C. Belasco J.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 84-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The identification of the key sequence features of rne hp2 provides a basis for searching the genomes of E. coli and related microorganisms for other genes encoding similar elements that may render those genes particularly sensitive to feedback regulation by RNase E. Using strict search criteria based on the essential features of hp2 to examine the sequences of the E. coli, Yersinia pestis, and H. influenzae genomes (see “Experimental Procedures”),rne was the only gene found to encode a hp2-like stem-loop in all three species. Two other mRNAs in E. coli and one in Y. pestis have the potential to form a similar stem-loop, but in each case this potential is of questionable significance due to its lack of conservation in either of the other two bacterial species that were examined. Using more relaxed criteria, additional candidates for possible hp2 homologs were identified, but again none were conserved in all three species. We conclude that hp2 most likely is a unique evolutionary adaptation of the rne gene that enables its expression to be tightly regulated by cellular RNase E activity. Examination of the RNase E genes of bacterial organisms that are only distantly related to E. coli suggests that their rne transcripts may lack a recognizable homolog of hp2 upstream of the coding region. Either RNase E synthesis is not autoregulated in those species, or its autoregulation is mediated in cis by an element distinct from hp2. The precision with which E. coli cells regulate RNase E synthesis is crucial for properly controlling rates of mRNA decay and for sustaining cell growth (18Jain C. Deana A. Belasco J.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 1053-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Knowing the critical features of rne hp2 should be of considerable value in elucidating the molecular mechanism by which this regulatory stem-loop senses the cellular concentration of RNase E and modulates rne gene expression through changes in rne mRNA longevity.

With the use of 15N labeling and site-directed mutagenesis to assign overlapping resonances through the base pair replacement of U71A2 by G2C71, U27A43 by G27C43, and G12C23 by U12A23, the resonances of all 26 observable imino protons in the helical regions and in the tertiary interactions were assigned unambiguously by means of two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy and heteronuclear single quantum coherence methods. When the discriminator base A73and the G12C23 base pair on the D stem, two identity elements on bovine tRNATrp that are important for effective recognition by tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase, were mutated to the ineffective forms of G73 and U12A23, respectively, NMR analysis revealed an important conformational change in the U12A23mutant but not in the G73 mutant molecule. Thus A73 appears to be directly recognized by tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase, and G12C23 represents an important structural determinant. Mg2+ effects on the assigned resonances of imino protons allowed the identification of strong, medium, and weak Mg2+ binding sites in tRNATrp. Strong Mg2+ binding modes were associated with the residues G7, s4U8 (where s4U is 4-thiouridine), G12, and U52. The observations that G42 was associated with strong Mg2+ binding in only the U12A23mutant tRNATrp but not the wild type or G73mutant tRNATrp and that the G7, s4U8, G24, and G22imino protons are associated with a two-site Mg2+ binding mode in wild type and G73 mutant but only a one-site mode in the U12A23 mutant established the occurrence of conformational change in the U12A23 mutant tRNATrp. These observations also established the dependence of Mg2+ binding on tRNA conformation and the usefulness of Mg2+ binding sites as conformational probes. The thermal titration of tRNATrp in the presence and absence of 10 mm Mg2+ indicated that overall tRNATrp structure stability was increased by more than 15 °C by the presence of Mg2+. NMR was used to study the solution structure of bovine tRNATrp hyperexpressed in Escherichia coli.

Thus A73 appears to be directly recognized by tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase, and G12C23 represents an important structural determinant.

These observations also established the dependence of Mg2+ binding on tRNA conformation and the usefulness of Mg2+ binding sites as conformational probes.

It is therefore necessary to characterize for every tRNA-synthetase system the roles of identity elements on the tRNA that are essential for recognition by the synthetase.

However, the assignments of the imino proton resonances remain problematic because of overlapping signals. Multidimensional NMR using stable isotopes such as 15N and 13C facilitates spectral assignments and the study of interactions between tRNAs and cognate synthetases (7Wallis N.G. Dardel F. Blanquet S.

By mutagenizing a base pair with a resonance that overlaps with that of another base pair, the latter resonance may be analyzed unambiguously. Use of this approach has made possible the assignment of almost all of the imino protons in the helical regions and the tertiary base pairs in Bacillus subtilis tRNATrp. two-dimensional one-dimensional tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase heteronuclear single quantum coherence nuclear Overhauser effect NOE spectroscopy 4-thiouridine two-dimensional one-dimensional tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase heteronuclear single quantum coherence nuclear Overhauser effect NOE spectroscopy 4-thiouridine Magnesium ions are essential to tRNA function, and their binding to tRNA has long been investigated (16Schimmel P.R. Redfield A.G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1980; 9: 181-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In tRNA molecules, weak nonspecific Mg2+ binding sites are abundant, primarily based on electrostatic interactions of the ion with backbone phosphates, and relatively weak in binding affinities. Strong binding sites are coordinated, either directly or via water, to phosphates and other ligands (17Jack A. Ladner J.E. Rhodes D. Brown R.S. Klug A. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 111: 315-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 18Quigley G.J. Teeter M.M. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Since the strong Mg2+ binding sites are non-randomly distributed and also few in number, their locations are expected to depend on RNA structure. The distributions of such strong Mg2+ sites therefore may furnish potentially useful structural information. Given the extensive imino proton assignments made possible by a combination of tRNA sequence mutagenesis and 2D1 NMR (15Yan X.Z. Xue H. Liu H.Z. Hang J. Wong J.T. Zhu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6712-6716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), the possible conformational roles of the A73 and G12C23 identity elements on bovine tRNATrp were examined in the present study based on their mutation to the ineffective forms of G73 and U12A23, respectively, and monitoring NMR chemical shift changes of different imino protons in the wild type and mutant molecules. Conformational changes were also detected through changes in the behavior of strong Mg2+ binding sites. Bovine tRNATrp (Fig. 1) was produced from hyperexpressing strains of E. coli JM109 transformed by recombinant pGEM-9Zf(−)-derived plasmid containing synthetic bovine tRNATrp gene and grown in M9-glycerol medium supplemented with 100 μg of ampicillin/ml (15Yan X.Z. Xue H. Liu H.Z. Hang J. Wong J.T. Zhu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6712-6716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The tRNATrp was purified as described by Xue et al. (20Xue H. Shen W. Wong J.T. J. Chromatogr. 1993; 613: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).15N-Labeled tRNATrp was obtained similarly except that NH4Cl was replaced by15NH4Cl (Isotec Inc.) in the growth medium. In addition to wild type bovine tRNATrp, the single base or base pair mutants of G73, G2C71, G27C43, and U12A23, in which the bases at positions 73, 2/71, 27/43, and 12/23 were changed to the designated forms, were also hyperexpressed, labeled, and purified. Tryptophanylation of the wild type and mutant tRNATrp was carried out with human TrpRS purified as described by Guo et al. (21Guo Q. Gong Q. Tong K. Vestergaard B. Costa A. Desgers J. Wong M.

Giege R. Wong J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9316-9322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer at a probe temperature of 30 °C. Jump-and-return sequence was applied in all 1D and 2D NOESY spectra for suppressing solvent signal as described by Yan et al. (15Yan X.Z. Xue H. Liu H.Z. Hang J. Wong J.T. Zhu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6712-6716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Phase-sensitive 2D NOESY spectra were recorded at a 120-ms mixing time with the hypercomplex method for quadrature detection in F1 dimension. A total of 256 t1 experiments with 4096 real points were collected over a spectral width of 12,000 Hz in each dimension. Sensitivity-enhanced gradient 2D 15N-1H HSQC spectra were recorded with a spectral width of 12,000 and 6000 Hz in the proton and nitrogen dimensions, respectively. One hundred and twenty-eight t1 increments were collected, each with 2048 real points. For NMR studies, 13–18 mg of tRNATrp as determined by UV absorbance at 254 nm was dissolved in 0.5 ml of Buffer A containing 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mmsodium chloride, and 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.5. D2O was added to 8% as a lock signal. Magnesium ion was removed from the tRNA samples by dissolving the tRNA in 2 ml of Buffer A containing 100 mm EDTA in place of 10 mmMgCl2 and heating to 50 °C for 5 min. Afterward the solution was concentrated to 20% of the volume using Centracon-10 (Amicon Inc.), washed two to three times with the same EDTA-containing Buffer A, and washed three to four times more with the same buffer without EDTA. The final volumes of tRNA samples were adjusted to 0.45 ml. Titration with Mg2+ was achieved by adding successively small aliquots (5 μl) of a series of MgCl2 solutions of appropriated concentrations directly to the NMR tube. To construct binding curves of Mg2+ to tRNA, the chemical shifts of individual imino protons were plotted as a function of Mg2+concentration. Most data could be fitted to a one-binding-site model by means of software program Xcrvfit (Protein Engineering Network of Centres of Excellence (PENCE)/Medical Research Council of Canada (MRC) Group Joint Software Centre, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada). For binding curves with a clear departure from hyperbolic behavior in the form of a maximum, the data were fitted to a two-binding-site model by means of the same software (23Bradbury E.M. Nicolini C. NMR in the Life Sciences. Plenum Press, New York1986: 93-103Crossref Google Scholar). The usual assignment strategy for the imino proton resonances of nucleic acids was applied to the hydrogen-bonded segments of tRNA. The imino protons in these segments are close enough (≤5 Å) to give NOEs so that assignment of these protons can be achieved via a chain of connectivities provided a suitable starting point or a unique sequence is available (24Roberts G.C.K. NMR of Macromolecules: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Cambridge1993: 217-288Google Scholar). Imino protons involved in hydrogen bonding in base pairs and tertiary interactions are protected from exchange with solvent and therefore visible in the downfield region of the 1H NMR spectrum (25Kearns D.R. Patel D. Shulman R.G. Yamane T. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 61: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Typically ∼28 such imino protons resonances are expected to appear for a canonical tRNA. For wild type bovine tRNATrp, 28 imino protons were distinguished in the region of the 1H NMR spectrum between 9 and 15 ppm (Table I). Two-dimensional 15N-1H HSQC (Fig. 2) and NOESY (Fig. 3) were both used for imino proton assignment. The 15N labeling allowed ready differentiation between UA (15N shifts 156.8–179.4 for UN3) and GC (15N shifts 142.9–148.2 for GN1) base pairs (7Wallis N.G. Dardel F. Blanquet S.

There is no special base in the acceptor stem that can be used as a starting marker for resonance assignment. To identify base pairs in this stem, a 15N-labeled tRNATrp mutant was prepared in which U71A2 was replaced by G2C71. The15N-1H HSQC spectrum of this G2C71 mutant indicated clearly that an imino proton resonance originally located at 14.24 ppm in the UA base pair region disappeared, accompanied by the emergence of a new resonance at 12.16 ppm in the GC base pair region. Based on this observation, the imino proton of U71 was unambiguously assigned. This imino proton gave NOEs to two different GC base pairs at 11.77 and 13.16 ppm, respectively. Since the base pair at 11.77 ppm was very weak in intensity, it was assigned to the imino proton of G1C72, which, being located at the open end of the acceptor stem, might be expected to undergo significant unstacking. The second base pair, which thereupon could be regarded as the imino proton of G70C3, gave rise to a further NOE to the G69C4 base pair. Because GU base pairs contain two hydrogen-bonded imino protons that are strongly dipolar-coupled on account of their close proximity (<3 Å), they usually yield the strongest cross-peaks in the NOESY spectrum (10Hare D.R. Reid B.R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1835-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). On this basis the two GU base pairs in wild type bovine tRNATrp were therefore linked to the two strongest resonances in the upfield imino proton region. One of the base pairs gave NOEs to the identified G69C4, and the next GC base pair in the stem (namely G67C6) was assigned to G68U5. At the end of the acceptor stem, the imino proton of the G7C66 base pair was also connected in turn by NOE to the imino proton of G67C6. Thereby the base pairs in the acceptor stem were completely assigned. Like many other canonical tRNAs, bovine tRNATrp contains a sole ribothymidine residue at position 54. The thymidine methyl group resonates remarkably in the upfield region of 1H NMR spectrum at 0.99 ppm and is thus easily recognized. Since the proton of the methyl group is close to ψ55 and formed the reversed Hoogsteen pair T54A58 crossing the ribothymidine loop, it gave a set of NOE cross-peaks to their imino protons. This characteristic NOE crossing pattern in two-dimensional NOESY helped to assign the imino protons of T54 and ψ55 (15Yan X.Z. Xue H. Liu H.Z. Hang J. Wong J.T. Zhu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6712-6716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The identified T54 imino proton showed a further NOE connectivity to a GC base pair, assignable to the spatially adjacent G53C61. The imino proton of G53 in turn gave a very weak NOE to the AU base pair U52A62, which was confirmed in the15N-1H HSQC spectrum. The next NOE cross-peak between the imino protons of U52 and G51 could be traced out via T54/G53 and onward through G53/U52 NOE cross-peaks. Because there was no more distinct sequential NOE cross-peak available, the last two base pairs could be assigned only from the other end of the ribothymidine stem. Of the two GU base pairs in the tRNA, G68U5 in the acceptor stem was already assigned. Thus the remaining GU base pair could be identified unambiguously as G49U65. Based on the NOE cross-peak between G49U65 and the adjacent G64C50 base pair, the imino proton of G64 also could be assigned. The imino protons of G64 and G51 were too similar in chemical shift to display a distinguishable NOE peak from diagonal peaks. In addition to the three identified UA base pairs in the 15N-1H HSQC spectrum, only one characteristic UA base pair remained to be assigned at 13.08 ppm, which could be attributed unambiguously to U29A41 in the anticodon stem. The imino proton of this UA base pair gave NOEs to two GC base pairs at 12.38 and 11.65 ppm. No further sequential NOE connectivities related to these base pairs was observed. This might be due to the fact that since the UA and ψA base pairs are located at the two ends of the anticodon stem, dynamic fluctuations could cause them to become unstacked. To identify the GC base pairs in the anticodon stem, 15N-labeled mutant tRNATrpwith a base pair change from U27A43 to G27C43 was cloned, expressed, and purified. In the 15N-1H HSQC spectrum, a new GC imino proton resonance appearing at 13.16 ppm was assigned to this G27C43. A GC base pair originally located at 12.38 ppm in the wild type moved to 12.77 ppm in the G27C43 mutant, but no change in chemical shift was observed on another GC base pair located at 11.65 ppm. The 12.38 ppm GC base pair consequently could be assigned to the G42C28 base pair adjacent to U27A43, leaving the 11.65 ppm resonance assignable to G30C40. Another commonly encountered reversed Hoogsteen pair in tRNA, s4U8A14, provided an independent starting point for dihydrouridine stem assignments. Since the imino proton of this tertiary base resonated downfield to all other imino protons in both the 1H and15N dimensions on account of deshielding in thiouridine, it was readily identified at 15N shift 182.4 ppm. Based on the NOE between imino protons of s4U8A14 and its immediate neighbor of the G22C13 base pair (15Yan X.Z. Xue H. Liu H.Z. Hang J. Wong J.T. Zhu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6712-6716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), the G22 imino proton could be assigned to 13.06 ppm. However, no further NOE linked with G22C13 could be detected in the NOESY spectrum. This suggests that the G12/G22 NOE cross-peak was overlapped by diagonal signals because of the close similarity in chemical shifts between the imino protons of G22C13 and G12C23 base pairs. Three unidentified GC base pairs remained to be assigned in the 15N-1H HSQC spectrum. Two potential G12C23 base pairs resonated respectively at 12.96 and 13.22 ppm, yet another GC base pair at 12.72 ppm was connected to the 13.22 ppm base pair by NOE. To distinguish between these three GC base pairs, the15N-labeled U12A23tRNATrp mutant containing U12A23 in place of G12C23 was prepared and analyzed. In the 15N-1H HSQC spectrum of this U12A23 mutant, the wild type GC resonances at 12.96, 13.06, and 13.22 ppm, which would include that of G22C13, were missing from their original positions. Information from the NOESY spectrum suggests that the unaltered 12.72 ppm GC base pair could be assigned as G10C25, and the 13.22 ppm GC base pair to which G10C25 was linked by NOE could be assigned as G24C11. Since G22C13 at 13.06 ppm was already assigned based on its NOE to s4U8A14, the remaining GC base pair at 12.96 ppm was therefore assigned to G12C23. Besides the two assigned reversed Hoogsteen pairs of s4U8A14 and T54A58, wild type tRNATrp also contained the conserved tertiary ψ55G18 base pair between the T loop and D loop. The imino proton of G18resonated at 9.32 ppm, upfield from all other imino proton resonances, and gave an NOE to the ψ55N3 proton at 11.34 ppm, whereas the ψ55N1 proton was assigned on the basis of the mutual NOE at 10.34 ppm between N1 and N3 protons (26Quigley G.J. Rich A. Science. 1976; 194: 796-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The two possible UA resonances at 11.64 and 10.67 ppm in the 15N-1H HSQC spectrum, devoid of any detectable NOE connectivities, yet require further identification. Among the four 15N-labeled tRNATrp mutants G73, G2C71, G27C43, and U12A23, G73 gave 1D spectra most similar to the wild type. Most peaks in G2C71 also could be overlapped by those in wild type except for the evident loss of a UA resonance at 14.24 ppm and the emergence of a GC resonance at 12.16 ppm as expected from the UA to GC mutation. Both G27C43 and U12A23 underwent minor spectral changes, this being especially the case with the U12A23mutant (Fig. 4). Since the major spectral features of all these mutants largely resemble those of the wild type, all four mutant molecules must share with the wild type a closely similar three-dimensional conformation. The individual imino protons in the different mutant structures could be assigned simply by comparing the mutant and wild type 15N-1H HSQC spectra and combining the NOE information from their 2D NOESY spectra. This observation attests to the by and large replaceability of individual base pairs in tRNA with respect to the maintenance of the overall secondary and tertiary structures. It also underlines the straightforward and powerful use of tRNA mutants toward establishing NMR spectral assignments for tRNA molecules. Mg2+ binding curves for wild type tRNATrpand the G73 and U12A23 mutants were obtained by addition of Mg2+ to the tRNA molecules and monitoring the changes in the assigned imino proton chemical shifts. In the wild type and the G73 mutant, the imino protons of U65 and ψ55 in the T stem displayed the largest upfield shift changes followed by those of G67 of the acceptor stem, G53 of the T stem, and U29of the anticodon stem with larger downfield shifts (Fig. 5). These differences in magnitude of Mg2+-induced chemical shift changes could be the result of changes in the local environment of the proton or structural changes in the tRNA molecules (27Gonzales R.L., Jr. Tinoco I., Jr. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1267-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The U12A23 mutant displayed a similar pattern of chemical shift changes with additional large downfield shifts for the imino protons of s4U8 and G10 in the D stem. The majority of Mg2+ binding curves determined from the various assigned imino protons was hyperbolic and could be fitted to a one-binding-site model. Some of the curves, however, displayed a maximum and required fitting to a two-binding-site model (Table II). Because of the lack of a satisfactory procedure for calculating free Mg2+concentration in the face of multiple metal ion binding events (28Rüdisser S. Tinoco I., Jr. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1211-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar,29Maderia M. Hunsicker L.M. DeRose V.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12113-12120Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), no attempt was made to estimate the exact Mg2+ binding dissociation constants. The fitted curves for imino protons associated with tight and medium Mg2+ binding sites are shown in Fig. 6.Table IIThe residues of bovine tRNATrp involved in the Mg2+bindingstRNATrpStrong binding (K1/2 of 1–10 mm)Medium binding (K1/2 of 10–20 mm)Weak binding (K1/2 of 20–500 mm)Marginal binding (K1/2 > 500 mm)WTG7,s4U8, G12,G24U52G1, U71, G70, G69, G10, G22, G18, G30, G42, U65, G64, G51, G53, T54, ψ55N3U5, G67, U29, ψ55N1G73G7,s4U8, G12,G24U52G1, U71, G70, G69, G10, G22, G18, G30, G42, U65, G64, G51, G53, T54, ψ55N3U5, G67, U29, ψ55N1U12A23s4U8, G24, G42U52, ψ55N3, ψ55N1G1, U71, G70, G69, G67, G10, G18, G30, U29, G42, U65, G64, G51, G53, T54G67, U29The residues whose imino proton require a two-binding-site model for description are shown in bold.
