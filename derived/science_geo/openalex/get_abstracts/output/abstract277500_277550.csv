https://openalex.org/W2036091023,"In an earlier paper, Khare and Sagan reported the production of a brownish polymeric material from the near-ultraviolet irradiation of simulated jovian atmospheres with a low hydrogen abundance. Examination of this product indicates that hydrogen sulfide is the initial photon acceptor; the powder resulting after extraction with benzene is 84 percent sulfur, largely S(8). In results reported here, the remaining 16 percent was pyrolyzed and then examined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Pyrolysis at 450 degrees C yielded a series of alkanes, alkenes, C(3)-alkylbenzenes, aromatics, thiophenes, alkylthiophenes, alkylmercaptans, alkyldisulfides, together with the nitrogenous compounds hydrogen cyanide, methyl cyanide, alkylisothiocyanates, acrylonitrile, and allylisothiocyanates. Some of these compounds might be sought on Jupiter and Saturn and their satellites by remote infrared and ultraviolet spectroscopy and directly by entry probes."

These changes are accompanied by a marked reduction in the pantothenic acid content of the liver, and are corrected by the inclusion in such diets of crystalline biotin and ""folic acid"" concentrates. The utilization of pantothenic acid by the rat appears to depend on the availability of biotin and ""folic acid."" Under normal conditions these are supplied by the diet and synthesized by intestinal bacteria. A hypothesis is offered in explanation of the chromotrichial actions of ""folic acid,"" biotin and p-aminobenzoic acid."

https://openalex.org/W1966367358,A Viking orbiting spacecraft successfully obtained pictures of the martian satellite Phobos with Mars in the background. This is the first time that a single picture was obtained from a spacecraft which contained both a planet and a moon and had significant surface detail visible on both. The region of Mars below Phobos included volcanoes in the Tharsis Montes region. These pictures showed Phobos to be smaller than previously thought. The image of Phobos can be used as a control point to determine the map coordinates of surface features on Mars.
