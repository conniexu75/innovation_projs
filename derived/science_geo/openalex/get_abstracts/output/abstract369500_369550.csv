Gansel et al. (p. 1513 , published online 20 August; see the cover) show that the tunable electromagnetic response of metamaterials may offer a route to reduce the amount of material required for strongly optically active materials. Based on the standard metamaterials design of the splitring resonator, photolithography was used to define an array of three-dimensional gold nanocorkscrews. Just a single wavelength thickness of the corkscrew design was required for a circular polarizer operating over an octave of bandwidth."
https://openalex.org/W3037767763,"Tunable Metamaterials The electromagnetic response of metamaterials gives rise to exciting phenomena such as cloaking, negative refraction, and perfect lensing. Their response, however, tends to depend strongly on resonant effects, thereby limiting the application bandwidth. Driscoll et al. (p. 1518 , published online 20 August) combine a split ring resonator array with the phase change material, VO 2 , to form a metamaterial in which the response can be tuned. The heat-induced phase change of VO 2 from an insulator to a metal alters the response of split-ring resonator, and, because it displays a hysteresis, the device can retain a “memory” of the induced change. The results may lead to a flexible method for achieving metamaterials operating over a wide bandwidth and to novel switching applications."

Park et al. (p. 977 ) have developed a series of techniques for depositing and assembling inorganic LEDs onto glass, plastic, or rubber. Conventional processing techniques are used to connect the LEDs in order to create flexible, stretchable displays, which, because the active diode material only covers a small part of the substrate, are mostly transparent."

Here, we report the cloning of a previously unknown type of gene that confers non-race-specific resistance and its successful use in breeding. Pi21 encodes a proline-rich protein that includes a putative heavy metal-binding domain and putative protein-protein interaction motifs. Wild-type Pi21 appears to slow the plant's defense responses, which may support optimization of defense mechanisms. Deletions in its proline-rich motif inhibit this slowing. Pi21 is separable from a closely linked gene conferring poor flavor. The resistant pi21 allele, which is found in some strains of japonica rice, could improve blast resistance of rice worldwide."

The heritable symbiont Hamiltonella defensa protects the aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum from attack by the parasitoid Aphidius ervi by killing developing wasp larvae. In a controlled genetic background, we show that a toxin-encoding bacteriophage is required to produce the protective phenotype. Phage loss occurs repeatedly in laboratory-held H. defensa-infected aphid clonal lines, resulting in increased susceptibility to parasitism in each instance. Our results show that these mobile genetic elements can endow a bacterial symbiont with benefits that extend to the animal host. Thus, phages vector ecologically important traits, such as defense against parasitoids, within and among symbiont and animal host lineages."

Typically, the inversion starts with a simple layered model of the tomographic region. Tape et al. (p. 988 ) show how, starting with a three-dimensional model, based on synthetic seismograms, an improved iterative inversion approach can lead to a much more detailed view of a region. Using the rich data for Southern California, the model reveals details of the geologic history of the crust in this region."
https://openalex.org/W2132592261,"Making Memories Last How can memory traces persist over days or weeks, despite the short-lived nature and rapid turnover of their molecular substrates? It has recently been reported that, in order to persist, an otherwise rapidly forgotten long-term memory requires BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) expression in the hippocampus 12 hours post training. Rossato et al. (p. 1017 ) now show that this mechanism is gated into action by activation of the ventral tegmental area acting upon dopamine D1 receptors in the hippocampus. Time-limited N -methyl- d -aspartate receptor–dependent activity in the ventral tegmental area–hippocampal circuitry underlies the delayed increase in BDNF levels in the hippocampus 12 hours after inhibitory avoidance, a hippocampus-dependent form of learning."
https://openalex.org/W2097289778,"Rethinking Vaccine Distribution The distribution of vaccines is a complex issue lying at the intersection of public health, economics, and ethics and it cannot be decided in hindsight as an epidemic unfolds. Thus, mathematical modeling can be valuable for guiding policy, and Medlock and Galvani (p. 1705 , published online 20 August) present an analysis of how to distribute influenza vaccine among different age groups in a way that will minimize transmission. Scenarios were developed for different outcomes that tell us what happens, in terms of numbers of infections, mortality, and cost, when various cohorts are targeted for vaccination under different epidemic conditions, and compare 1918- and 1957-like epidemics. The scenarios could apply equally well to antiviral drug distribution. The conclusion is that the current recommendations for vaccine distribution from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may need to be revised to include age-related patterns of transmission to minimize the impact of epidemic influenza."

FoxO transcription factors promote autophagy in skeletal muscle and have additional roles in regulation of cell size, proliferation, and metabolism. Here we investigate the role of FoxO transcription factors in regulating autophagy and cell size in cardiomyocytes. In cultured rat neonatal cardiomyocytes, glucose deprivation leads to decreased cell size and induction of autophagy pathway genes LC3, Gabarapl1, and Atg12. Likewise, overexpression of either FoxO1 or FoxO3 reduces cardiomyocyte cell size and induces expression of autophagy pathway genes. Moreover, inhibition of FoxO activity by dominant negative FoxO1 (Δ256) blocks cardiomyocyte cell size reduction upon starvation, suggesting the necessity of FoxO function in cardiomyocyte cell size regulation. Under starvation conditions, endogenous FoxO1 and FoxO3 are localized to the nucleus and bind to promoter sequences of Gabarapl1 and Atg12. In vivo studies show that cellular stress, such as starvation or ischemia/reperfusion in mice, results in induction of autophagy in the heart with concomitant dephosphorylation of FoxO, consistent with increased activity of nuclear FoxO transcription factors. Together these results provide evidence for an important role for FoxO1 and FoxO3 in regulating autophagy and cell size in cardiomyocytes.

The regulation of cell size is finely controlled by the availability of nutrients and growth factors that ultimately control the balance between protein synthesis and degradation. Cardiac myocyte hypertrophy occurs during developmental growth of the heart (1Li F. Wang X. Capasso J.M. Gerdes A.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1996; 28: 1737-1746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) and is induced in response to exercise or pathological conditions (1Li F. Wang X. Capasso J.M. Gerdes A.M. J.

Conversely, the heart can undergo reduction in size in response to starvation, as observed in patients with anorexia nervosa (4de Simone G. Scalfi L. Galderisi M. Celentano A. Di Biase G. Tammaro P.

Hopkins B.E. Taylor R.R. Circ. Res. 1974; 35: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 7Zafeiridis A. Jeevanandam V. Houser S.R. Margulies K.B. Circulation. 1998; 98: 656-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Therefore, multiple stimuli can affect heart size, and maintenance of proper cardiomyocyte size is critical for normal cardiac function. The molecular and physiological regulation of the cardiac hypertrophic response has been studied extensively (3Heineke J. Molkentin J.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 589-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar). Much less is known of the pathways that result in the reduction in cardiomyocyte cell size under conditions of starvation or decreased mechanical load. The autophagic process has been implicated in cellular homeostasis and cell size regulation in multiple organ systems during normal development and in stress conditions, such as starvation (8Meléndez A. Neufeld T.P. Development. 2008; 135: 2347-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 9Levine B. Kroemer G.

Autophagy. 2008; 4: 507-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Autophagy pathway genes, including LC3, Gabarapl1 (homolog to yeast Atg8), Atg12, Atg5, and Atg7, are involved in multiple stages of the formation of the autophagosome (9Levine B. Kroemer G.

Cardiol. 2008; 44: 654-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Autophagy also is a cellular homeostatic process for normal protein turnover and is necessary to eliminate damaged proteins and organelles, which might be toxic or harmful to the cell (11Gustafsson A.B.

Science. 2004; 306: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar). During nutrient deprivation, autophagy is induced in several organ systems as a means of generating intracellular nutrients and energy (9Levine B. Kroemer G.

Cell. 2004; 15: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1948) Google Scholar). Autophagy also is required in the neonatal period of nutrient deprivation after birth and before feeding, as indicated by neonatal lethality of Atg5-null mice (14Kuma A. Hatano M. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakaya H. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. Tokuhisa T. Mizushima N. Nature. 2004; 432: 1032-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar). Autophagy in cardiac myocytes occurs during normal development and homeostasis and also is associated with cardiac disease (11Gustafsson A.B. Gottlieb R.A. J. Mol. Cell.

Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). During the neonatal starvation period, autophagosomes are apparent in the heart muscle of GFP-LC3 transgenic mice (13Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Matsui M. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1948) Google Scholar), and autophagosome formation in the heart is absent in Atg5-null mice (14Kuma A. Hatano M. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakaya H. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. Tokuhisa T. Mizushima N. Nature. 2004; 432: 1032-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar). In the adult heart, autophagy is required for homeostasis, because cardiac specific loss of Atg5 leads to cardiac hypertrophy, left ventricular dilation, contractile dysfunction, and ultimately heart failure (16Nakai A. Yamaguchi O. Takeda T. Higuchi Y. Hikoso S. Taniike M. Omiya S. Mizote I. Matsumura Y. Asahi M. Nishida K. Hori M. Mizushima N. Otsu K. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 619-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). During nutrient deprivation, autophagy is induced in the adult mouse heart in vivo and in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (13Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Matsui M. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. Mol. Biol.

Increased cardiac autophagy also occurs with dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure, ischemia/reperfusion, aortic stenosis, and in hibernating myocardium (11Gustafsson A.B. Gottlieb R.A. J. Mol. Cell.

Autophagy. 2008; 4: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the duration and severity of autophagy may determine whether autophagy is protective or detrimental in response to ischemia/reperfusion in the heart (15Nishida K. Kyoi S. Yamaguchi O. Sadoshima J. Otsu K. Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). However, factors that are responsible for inducing and regulating autophagy in cardiomyocytes have not been reported previously. FoxO transcription factors have been implicated in regulating diverse cellular functions, including differentiation, proliferation, metabolism, and survival (22Greer E.L. Brunet A. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7410-7425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). There are multiple mechanisms that post-translationally regulate transcriptional activity of FoxO transcription factors (23Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J.

The FoxO subfamily of transcription factors consists of FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO4, which are subject to inhibition by growth factors, including insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (25Huang H. Tindall D.J. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2479-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). During growth factor limitation, the inhibition of FoxO activity by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT is relieved, and the dephosphorylated FoxO transcription factors are activated and become localized to the nucleus (23Brunet A.

The function of FoxO1 and FoxO3 in regulation of autophagy pathway genes in cardiomyocytes has not been demonstrated previously. Here we examine the roles of FoxO1 and FoxO3 transcription factors in regulating autophagy in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes as well as in mice subjected to starvation or cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury. Glucose deprivation of cultured cardiomyocytes leads to decreased cell size, induces autophagy, and promotes FoxO nuclear localization and binding to autophagy pathway gene regulatory sequences. Increased expression of FoxO1 or FoxO3 results in decreased cardiomyocyte cell size and activation of autophagic vacuole formation and autophagy pathway gene expression. In addition, using dominant negative FoxO1 (Δ256) adenovirus, we show that FoxO activity is necessary to regulate cell size in starved rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. In vivo, starvation or ischemic injury results in FoxO dephosphorylation and induction of autophagy in the heart. Together, these studies provide evidence that FoxO1 and FoxO3 regulate cardiomyocyte cell size and promote autophagy pathway gene expression in cardiomyocytes. Primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were isolated from hearts of 1–2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat pups as described previously (34De Windt L.J. Lim H.W. Haq S. Force T. Molkentin J.D. J. Biol.

After separation from fibroblasts, enriched cardiomyocytes were plated on 2-well chamber slides for immunofluorescence or on 10-cm diameter dishes for Western blot and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) 2The abbreviations used are: ChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumFBSfetal bovine serumWTwild typeCAconstitutively active3-MA3-methyladenineRTreverse transcriptionGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseANOVAanalysis of varianceAVautophagic vacuole. experiments. Cells were grown in DMEM (catalog number 10-017-CV, Cellgro) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. For starvation experiments, cells were grown in DMEM containing FBS and penicillin/streptomycin for 2 days. On the 3rd day, “starved” cells were replenished with glucose-free (catalog number 11966, Invitrogen) FBS-free medium, in parallel with “fed” cells replenished with medium containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, as reported previously (18Matsui Y.

Additionally, cells were treated with DMEM glucose-supplemented media (4.5 g/liter; catalog number 11965, Invitrogen) and DMEM glucose-depleted media (catalog number 11966, Invitrogen) with no serum for fed and starved experiments with similar results. After 24 h, all cells were harvested either for RNA and protein isolation or fixed for immunofluorescence. In some experiments, the inhibitor of autophagosome formation, 3-methyladenine (3MA, 10 μm), was added to determine the requirement for autophagy in starvation-induced cardiomyocyte cell size reduction. Adenoviral infections were performed as described previously (27Evans-Anderson H.J. Alfieri C.M. Yutzey K.E. Circ.

In some experiments, cardiomyocytes were infected with Ad GFP-LC3 virus along with β-galactosidase, WT-FoxO1, CA-FoxO1, WT-FoxO3, or CA-FoxO3 virus for 48 h to determine the FoxO-mediated induction of autophagy. Autophagic flux was determined by incubating the cells for the last 4 h either in the absence (steady-state autophagosomes) or in the presence (cumulative autophagosomes) of a mixture of lysosomal inhibitors (bafilomycin A1 (10 nm), E64D (5 μg/ml), and pepstatin A methyl ester (5 μg/ml)) to inhibit autophagosome-lysosome fusion (36Hamacher-Brady A. Brady N.R. Gottlieb R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29776-29787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Cardiomyocytes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and observed with fluorescence microscopy. To quantify the autophagic response in a population of cells, the percentage of cells expressing more than five autophagic vacuoles was counted by observing the puncta at ×60 magnification. A minimum of 150 cells was scored for each condition in at least three independent experiments. For quantification of the autophagic response in a single cell, at least 15–20 representative GFP-LC3 puncta-containing cells from each experiment were randomly selected and observed at ×60 magnification to count the total number of LC3 puncta per cell (36Hamacher-Brady A.

Total RNA was isolated from fed and starved rat neonatal cardiomyocytes or adult mouse hearts for quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis (27Evans-Anderson H.J. Alfieri C.M. Yutzey K.E. Circ. Res. 2008; 102: 686-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). 1 μg of total RNA was used to generate cDNA with a Superscript II first strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 1 μl of synthesized cDNA was used for analysis by quantitative RT-PCR (MJ Research Opticon 2) as described previously (37Shelton E.L.

Oligonucleotide primer sequences used for quantification of mouse LC3, Gabarapl1, and Atg12 were described previously (29Zhao J. Brault J.J. Schild A. Cao P. Sandri M. Schiaffino S. Lecker S.H. Goldberg A.L. Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 472-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). Corresponding oligonucleotide primers were designed for rat (r) as follows: rLC3 forward 5′-CGTCCTGGACAAGACCAAGT-3′ and rLC3 reverse 5′-AGTGCTGTCCCGAACGTCTC-3′; rGabarapl1 forward 5′-CATCGTGGAGAAGGCTCCTA-3′ and rGabarapl1 reverse 5′-ATACAGCTGTCCCATGGTAG-3′; and rAtg12 forward 5′-GGCCTCGGAGCAGTTGTTTA-3′ and rAtg12 reverse 5′-CAGCATCAAAACTTCTCTGA-3′. Amplification reactions were performed with 34 cycles of (94 °C for 30 s; 55 °C for 45 s; and 72 °C for 30 s), and normalized to ribosomal protein L7 for mouse (38Hemmerich P. von Mikecz A.

Normalized threshold cycle values of samples amplified in triplicate were used to calculate relative gene expression levels. Statistical significance of observed differences was determined by Student's t test and ANOVA (p < 0.05). Immunofluorescent staining of rat neonatal cardiomyocytes was performed as described previously (27Evans-Anderson H.J. Alfieri C.M. Yutzey K.E. Circ. Res. 2008; 102: 686-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Antibodies used for immunofluorescence include the following: FoxO1 (Upstate) (1:100); FoxO3 (Upstate) (1:100); Gabarapl1 (Proteintech Group, Inc.) (1:100); and sarcomeric α-actinin (Sigma) (1:500). Following primary antibody incubation, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with corresponding Alexa Fluor-488 goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies (1:200, Molecular Probes). As a negative control, all slides were incubated with only secondary antibody but with no primary to detect the background fluorescence (data not shown). Incubation with To-Pro3 (1:1000, Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature was used to visualize nuclei. Immunofluorescence was detected using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope. Images were obtained using Zeiss LSM version 3.2 SP2 software. For cell size determination, Image J software was used to calculate cardiomyocyte surface area of at least 200 cells (α-actinin-positive cells) per experimental group. Statistical significance of observed differences in cardiomyocyte cell size was determined by Student's t test and ANOVA (p < 0.05). Protein lysates were isolated from the ventricles of fed and starved, sham and ischemic/reperfused mouse hearts and rat neonatal cardiomyocytes using ice-cold CelLytic MT tissue lysis buffer or CelLytic-M cell lysis buffer (Sigma), containing protease inhibitor mixture (Pierce) and phosphatase inhibitor (Pierce) according to the manufacturers' instructions. Western blots were performed as described previously (27Evans-Anderson H.J. Alfieri C.M. Yutzey K.E. Circ. Res. 2008; 102: 686-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), except that membranes were incubated with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Thermo Scientific) (1:4000). Immunoblots were developed using chemifluorescent detection with the Vistra ECF reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and scanned using a Storm 860 (Amersham Biosciences). Signal intensities were quantified with ImageQuant 5.0 software (GE Healthcare). Antibodies used for immunoblot analysis included the following: FoxO1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (1:200); phospho-FoxO1 (Ser-256) (Cell Signaling) (1:700); FoxO3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (1:200); phospho-FoxO3 (Ser-318/321) (Cell Signaling) (1:700); LC3 (Nano Tools) (0.5 μg/ml); AKT (Cell Signaling) (1:2000); phospho-AKT (Ser-473) (1:1000); Sirt1 (Millipore) (1:1000). GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) (1:10,000) antibody was used as a loading control. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test (p < 0.05). DNA-protein complexes in fed and starved cultured rat neonatal cardiomyocytes were cross-linked for 10 min by directly adding formaldehyde (Sigma) to the culture medium at a final concentration of 1%. The fixed cells were lysed with lysis buffer (EZ ChIP, Upstate) and sonicated two times for 7 s with output 5 (Virsonic 60; Virtis) with a 2-min refractory period. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were incubated with an antibody against FoxO1 (5 μg; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or FoxO3 (5 μg; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation with normal rabbit IgG was used as a negative control. Immunoprecipitation was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (EZChIP, Upstate) with the exception that protein A-agarose beads were used. The immunoprecipitated and input DNA was subjected to PCR using the following primers: rGabarapl1 5′-TCAAAATGCAAGCACAGGAC-3′ and 5′-TTCCCTCCCCTTCAAGTCTCT-3′ and rAtg12 5′-TCTTCACCATCAAGCCAAAA-3′ and 5′-GTTAATGAGCTCTCATTG-3′ to amplify rat promoter regions corresponding to mouse regulatory sequences that contain previously reported FoxO1- and FoxO3- binding sites (29Zhao J.

Signal intensities were quantified with ImageQuant 5.0 software (GE Healthcare). To assess the effects of short term nutrient deficiency on induction of cardiomyocyte autophagy, adult FVBN mice (3 months old) were fasted for 48 h (40Zhu H. Tannous P. Johnstone J.L. Kong Y.

Throughout this time, animals had no access to food, but did have free access to water. Control mice had access to food and water ad libitum. After 48 h, the mice were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation; the hearts were explanted, and RNA or protein lysates were isolated as described previously (27Evans-Anderson H.J. Alfieri C.M. Yutzey K.E.

In semiconductor nanoparticles doped with magnetic ions, excitons can form a spin state, a magnetic polaron, but often the effect is limited to low temperatures (below 30 kelvin) and does not saturate in the absence of an applied magnetic field. Beaulac et al. (p. 973 ) report the synthesis of Mn-doped CdSe nanocrystals in which the quantum confinement effects lead to long exciton lifetimes. Photoexcitation results in exchange fields that can exceed 30 Tesla at low temperatures and that persist even up to room temperature in the absence of an applied magnetic field."
https://openalex.org/W2057373464,"T reg Responses to Eos CD4 + regulatory T cells (T regs ) are critical for keeping our immune system in check: They prevent immune responses from getting out of hand and keep autoimmunity at bay. By activating the expression of some genes and turning off expression of others, the master regulatory transcription factor of T regs , Foxp3, endows these cells with the appropriate gene expression program to mediate their suppressive effects. Pan et al. (p. 1142 , published online 20 August) now demonstrate that the transcription factor Eos is selectively required for Foxp3-mediated gene suppression in mice. Genes normally suppressed by Foxp3 in T regs remained “on” when Eos expression was suppressed, whereas genes activated by Foxp3 were unaffected. T reg function was also affected by Eos suppression. With half their genetic program disrupted, these cells resembled an intermediate between T regs and conventional CD4 + T cells—unable to suppress immune responses properly and partially responsive to T cell–activating stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2134370272,"Character Transplant When engineering bacteria, it can be advantageous to propagate the genomes in yeast. However, to be truly useful, one must be able to transplant the bacterial chromosome from yeast back into a recipient bacterial cell. But because yeast does not contain restriction-modification systems, such transplantation poses problems not encountered in transplantation from one bacterial cell to another. Bacterial genomes isolated after growth in yeast are likely to be susceptible to the restriction-modification system(s) of the recipient cell, as well as their own. Lartigue et al. (p. 1693 , published online 20 August) describe multiple steps, including in vitro DNA methylation, developed to overcome such barriers. A Mycoplasma mycoides large-colony genome was propagated in yeast as a centromeric plasmid, engineered via yeast genetic systems, and, after specific methylation, transplanted into M. capricolum to produce a bacterial cell with the genotype and phenotype of the altered M. mycoides large-colony genome."
https://openalex.org/W2127220207,"The timing of the formation of the first solids in the solar system remains poorly constrained. Micrometer-scale, high-precision magnesium (Mg) isotopic analyses demonstrate that Earth, refractory inclusions, and chondrules from primitive meteorites formed from a reservoir in which short-lived aluminum-26 (26Al) and Mg isotopes were homogeneously distributed at +/-10%. This level of homogeneity validates the use of 26Al as a precise chronometer for early solar system events. High-precision chondrule 26Al isochrons show that several distinct chondrule melting events took place from approximately 1.2 million years (My) to approximately 4 My after the first solids condensed from the solar nebula, with peaks between approximately 1.5 and approximately 3 My, and that chondrule precursors formed as early as 0.87(-0.16)(+0.19) My after."
https://openalex.org/W1987224264,"Translational Rearrangements Conformational changes in the ribosome are required to translocate messenger RNA and transfer RNA (tRNA) during protein biosynthesis. For example, after peptide bond formation, rotation of the large and small subunits results in a hybrid state of tRNA binding—tRNAs are bound respectively in the aminoacyl-tRNA (A) and peptidyl-tRNA (P) sites in the small subunit, but in the P and exit-tRNA (E) sites on the large subunit. Zhang et al. (p. 1014 ) now describe x-ray structures of the intact Escherichia coli ribosome, either in the apo form or with one or two anticodon stem-loop tRNA mimics bound, which show intermediate states of intersubunit rotation. The structures provide insight into how the interface between the large and small subunits rearranges in discrete steps to reach the hybrid state."
https://openalex.org/W2069524886,"Protein Synthesis Initiation Complex The final step in the initiation phase of protein synthesis is the formation of the first peptide bond, which requires initiator transfer RNA (tRNA) to be bound at the ribosomal P site.

Insight into how this is achieved comes from a structure of Thermus thermophilus 70 S ribosome bound to EF-P, initiator tRNA, and a short piece of messenger RNA presented by Blaha et al. (p. 966 ). EF-P binds between the P and E sites and facilitates proper positioning of initiator tRNA in the P site. A similar mechanism is likely to apply to structurally homologous initiation factors in archea and eukarya."
https://openalex.org/W2008915709,"The beneficial effect of sleep on memory has been well-established by extensive research on humans, but the neurophysiological mechanisms remain a matter of speculation. This study addresses the hypothesis that the fast oscillations known as ripples recorded in the CA1 region of the hippocampus during slow wave sleep (SWS) may provide a physiological substrate for long term memory consolidation. We trained rats in a spatial discrimination task to retrieve palatable reward in three fixed locations. Hippocampal local field potentials and cortical EEG were recorded for 2 h after each daily training session. There was an increase in ripple density during SWS after early training sessions, in both trained rats and in rats randomly rewarded for exploring the maze. In rats learning the place -reward association, there was a striking further significant increase in ripple density correlated with subsequent improvements in behavioral performance as the rat learned the spatial discrimination aspect of the task. The results corroborate others showing an experience-dependent increase in ripple activity and associated ensemble replay after exploratory activity, but in addition, for the first time, reveal a clear further increase in ripple activity related to associative learning based on spatial discrimination."
https://openalex.org/W2140236326,"Chromatin has an impact on recombination, repair, replication, and evolution of DNA. Here we report that chromatin structure also affects laboratory DNA manipulation in ways that distort the results of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments. We initially discovered this effect at the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HMR locus, where we found that silenced chromatin was refractory to shearing, relative to euchromatin. Using input samples from ChIP-Seq studies, we detected a similar bias throughout the heterochromatic portions of the yeast genome. We also observed significant chromatin-related effects at telomeres, protein binding sites, and genes, reflected in the variation of input-Seq coverage. Experimental tests of candidate regions showed that chromatin influenced shearing at some loci, and that chromatin could also lead to enriched or depleted DNA levels in prepared samples, independently of shearing effects. Our results suggested that assays relying on immunoprecipitation of chromatin will be biased by intrinsic differences between regions packaged into different chromatin structures - biases which have been largely ignored to date. These results established the pervasiveness of this bias genome-wide, and suggested that this bias can be used to detect differences in chromatin structures across the genome."
https://openalex.org/W2044187501,"Umami taste (corresponds to savory in English) is elicited by L-glutamate, typically as its Na salt (monosodium glutamate: MSG), and is one of five basic taste qualities that plays a key role in intake of amino acids. A particular property of umami is the synergistic potentiation of glutamate by purine nucleotide monophosphates (IMP, GMP). A heterodimer of a G protein coupled receptor, TAS1R1 and TAS1R3, is proposed to function as its receptor. However, little is known about genetic variation of TAS1R1 and TAS1R3 and its potential links with individual differences in umami sensitivity. Here we investigated the association between recognition thresholds for umami substances and genetic variations in human TAS1R1 and TAS1R3, and the functions of TAS1R1/TAS1R3 variants using a heterologous expression system. Our study demonstrated that the TAS1R1-372T creates a more sensitive umami receptor than -372A, while TAS1R3-757C creates a less sensitive one than -757R for MSG and MSG plus IMP, and showed a strong correlation between the recognition thresholds and in vitro dose-response relationships. These results in human studies support the propositions that a TAS1R1/TAS1R3 heterodimer acts as an umami receptor, and that genetic variation in this heterodimer directly affects umami taste sensitivity."

Consecutive or simultaneous infections with different subtypes of influenza viruses of low pathogenicity (LPAIV) are very common in wild duck populations. To better understand the epidemiology and pathogenesis of HPAIV H5N1 infections in natural ecosystems, we investigated the influence of prior infection of mallards with homo- (H5N2) and heterosubtypic (H4N6) LPAIV on exposure to HPAIV H5N1. In mallards with homosubtypic immunity induced by LPAIV infection, clinical disease was absent and shedding of HPAIV from respiratory and intestinal tracts was grossly reduced compared to the heterosubtypic and control groups (mean GEC/100 microl at 3 dpi: 3.0 x 10(2) vs. 2.3 x 10(4) vs. 8.7 x 10(4); p<0.05). Heterosubtypic immunity induced by an H4N6 infection mediated a similar but less pronounced effect. We conclude that the epidemiology of HPAIV H5N1 in mallards and probably other aquatic wild bird species is massively influenced by interfering immunity induced by prior homo- and heterosubtypic LPAIV infections."
https://openalex.org/W2117115489,"Paranodal myelin damage is observed in white matter injury. However the culprit for such damage remains unknown. By coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering imaging of myelin sheath in fresh tissues with sub-micron resolution, we observed significant paranodal myelin splitting and retraction following glutamate application both ex vivo and in vivo. Multimodal multiphoton imaging further showed that glutamate application broke axo-glial junctions and exposed juxtaparanodal K+ channels, resulting in axonal conduction deficit that was demonstrated by compound action potential measurements. The use of 4-aminopyridine, a broad-spectrum K+ channel blocker, effectively recovered both the amplitude and width of compound action potentials. Using CARS imaging as a quantitative readout of nodal length to diameter ratio, the same kind of paranodal myelin retraction was observed with applications of Ca2+ ionophore A23187. Moreover, exclusion of Ca2+ from the medium or application of calpain inhibitor abolished paranodal myelin retraction during glutamate exposure. Examinations of glutamate receptor agonists and antagonists further showed that the paranodal myelin damage was mediated by NMDA and kainate receptors. These results suggest that an increased level of glutamate in diseased white matter could impair paranodal myelin through receptor-mediated Ca2+ overloading and subsequent calpain activation."
https://openalex.org/W2024319790,"Activation of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling is initiated by a multiprotein complex formation between FGF, FGF receptor (FGFR), and heparan sulfate proteoglycan on the cell membrane. Cross-talk with other factors could affect this complex assembly and modulate the biological response of cells to FGF. We have previously demonstrated that anosmin-1, a glycosylated extracellular matrix protein, interacts with the FGFR1 signaling complex and enhances its activity in an IIIc isoform-specific and HS-dependent manner. The molecular mechanism of anosmin-1 action on FGFR1 signaling, however, remains unknown. Here, we show that anosmin-1 directly binds to FGFR1 with high affinity. This interaction involves domains in the N terminus of anosmin-1 (cysteine-rich region, whey acidic protein-like domain and the first fibronectin type III domain) and the D2-D3 extracellular domains of FGFR1. In contrast, anosmin-1 binds to FGFR2IIIc with much lower affinity and displays negligible binding to FGFR3IIIc. We also show that FGFR1-bound anosmin-1, although capable of binding to FGF2 alone, cannot bind to a FGF2.heparin complex, thus preventing FGFR1.FGF2.heparin complex formation. By contrast, heparin-bound anosmin-1 binds to pre-formed FGF2.FGFR1 complex, generating an anosmin-1.FGFR1.FGF2.heparin complex. Furthermore, a functional interaction between anosmin-1 and the FGFR1 signaling complex is demonstrated by immunofluorescence co-localization and Transwell migration assays where anosmin-1 was shown to induce opposing effects during chemotaxis of human neuronal cells. Our study provides molecular and cellular evidence for a modulatory action of anosmin-1 on FGFR1 signaling, whereby binding of anosmin-1 to FGFR1 and heparin can play a dual role in assembly and activity of the ternary FGFR1.FGF2.heparin complex."

Such methods can be used to characterize the “particle-in-a-box” states created in chains of varying lengths of metal atoms on surfaces. Chen et al. (p. 981 ) were able to spatially resolve photon emission for silver chains up to 10 atoms long, assembled on a nickel-aluminum alloy surface. The emission maxima correlated with the nodes seen in the derivative of STM current with voltage. This correlation follows from Fermi's golden rule, which connects the initial and final states of the radiation transition through the momentum operator and leads to a better understanding of the light-emission process."

In addition, we have shown that Wnt5A acts via protein kinase C (PKC) to mediate the motility of melanoma cells via the inhibition of metastasis suppressors and an initiation of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition, characterized by the loss of E-cadherin and the up-regulation of Snail (2Dissanayake S.K.

Wnt signaling can be mediated by heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) which are important signal transduction modulators.

Little C.B. BioEssays. 2008; 30: 457-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Cell surface HSPGs are glycoproteins with covalently attached unbranched and modified sugar chains known as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). There are two types of cell surface HSPGs, known as glypicans and syndecans (11Filmus J. Capurro M. Rast J. Genome Biol. 2008; 9: 224Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 13Lopes C.C. Dietrich C.P. Nader H.B. Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 2006; 39: 157-167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Glypicans are attached to the cell surface via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, whereas syndecans are type 1 transmembrane proteins. HSPG GAG side chains are unbranched chains of modified repeating disaccharide units of N-acetylglucosamine and glucuronic acid. They are joined to the core protein via a tetrasaccharide linker attached to a serine residue. Following synthesis, these chains undergo modification with the addition of sulfates by N- and O-sulfation (14Habuchi H. Habuchi O. Kimata K. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 21: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The sulfation status determines to which specific portion of the GAG chains ligands, such as Wnt, will attach. The heparan sulfate endosulfatases Sulf1 and Sulf2 are cell surface enzymes that control growth factor signaling. The regulation of the 6-O-sulfation states by these endosulfatases changes the affinity of the GAG chains for ligand binding (15Ai X. Do A.T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Lindahl U. Lu K. Emerson Jr., C.P. J.

Following sulfation modification, HSPGs can regulate signaling by dimerization (with other HSPGs or canonical signaling receptors), stabilization, or transport of the ligand to or away from the high affinity receptors (18Dews I.C.

In addition, studies have suggested that the core proteins themselves may also play an important role in cell phenotype and function (21Kramer K.L. Yost H.J. Annu. Rev.

In addition, HSPGs are overexpressed in many forms of cancer, including prostate cancer and melanoma (25Datta S. Pierce M. Datta M.W. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 1855-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 26Ikuta Y. Nakatsura T. Kageshita T. Fukushima S. Ito S. Wakamatsu K. Baba H. Nishimura Y. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 8079-8088Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Importantly, in cancer, proteoglycans can have both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing activities. This depends on the type of protein core, the GAGs attached, and the localization of the proteoglycan and the molecules they associate with. In addition, the tumor subtype, stages, and degree of tumor differentiation also affect the function of HSPGs (27Fjeldstad K. Kolset S.O. Curr. Drug Targets. 2005; 6: 665-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). HSPGs are cleaved by heparanases or heparin lyases (heparinases), which have been shown to have differing effects on tumor cell activity. For example, treating cancer cells with heparanase-1, which cleaves heparin-like regions (specifically HLGAG sites with O-sulfated l-iduronic acid residues), results in an increase in both tumor growth and metastatic dissemination (28Roy M. Marchetti D. J. Cell. Biochem. 2009; 106: 200-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, treating tumor cells with heparinase III, which more specifically cleaves HSPGs (i.e. unsulfated d-glucorinic acid, heparan-sulfate-like regions) results in an inhibition of their metastatic capacity (29Yang Y. MacLeod V. Dai Y. Khotskaya-Sample Y. Shriver Z. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. Naggi A. Torri G. Casu B. Vlodavsky I. Suva L.J. Epstein J. Yaccoby S. Shaughnessy Jr., J.D. Barlogie B. Sanderson R.D. Blood. 2007; 110: 2041-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Importantly, heparanase I cleaves only certain side chains, where heparinase III treatment cleaves the entire backbone of the HSPG. It is likely that cleavage of specific side chains facilitates cell motility by releasing cells from adhesion to neighboring cells, whereas cleavage of the entire molecule decreases the availability of secreted ligands to their receptors, especially those involved in autocrine signaling, such as Wnt5A. Historically, Wnt5A has been quite difficult to purify from cell culture media, despite the fact that it is a secreted protein. Further, in melanoma cells, Wnt5A appears to be signaling in an autocrine fashion (1Weeraratna A.T. Jiang Y. Hostetter G. Rosenblatt K. Duray P. Bittner M. Trent J.M.

Weeraratna A.T. Methods Mol. Biol. 2008; 468: 157-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), led us to hypothesize that HSPGs might be involved in increasing the availability of Wnt5A to its receptor, resulting in an increase in autocrine signaling and ultimately an increase in cellular invasion. In this study, we explore this hypothesis and investigate the role of HSPGs in the Wnt5A signaling cascade in metastatic melanoma cells. G361 cells were maintained in McCoy's (Invitrogen), and UACC903, M93-047, and UACC647 were maintained in RPMI (Invitrogen). All medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin, and 4 mm l-glutamine. Cell lines were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air, and the medium was replaced every 2–3 days. Cell lines were chosen based on their metastatic potential and Wnt5A levels, as reported previously (1Weeraratna A.T. Jiang Y. Hostetter G. Rosenblatt K. Duray P. Bittner M. Trent J.M.

Cells were then washed with PBS, and medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum and 100 μCi/ml Na235SO4 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added. Cells were then incubated for 24 h and transferred to a microfiber filter using a TomTec Harvester 96. The filter was read using a Wallace 1205 Betaplate liquid scintillation counter to obtain counts/million. An identical plate was set up and used to quantitate protein levels. The counts/million were normalized to protein levels, determined with a BCA protein assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. DMB binding assays were performed to quantify the levels of total GAG chains on the cell surface. Approximately 1 × 106 cells were collected in PBS or radioimmune precipitation buffer. For the cells in PBS, DMB (125 μl/well) was added to 40 μl of sample and quantified at 520 nm using a Bio-Rad 680XR spectrophotometer. For the cells in radioimmune precipitation buffer, protein was extracted and quantified. DMB binding levels were then compared with total protein levels. Cells were seeded at 5 × 105 (G361) and 3 × 105 (UACC903, UACC647, and M93-047) into 1-well chamber slides (Nunc, Rochester, NY) and incubated overnight. Cells were then fixed in ice-cold 95% methanol at room temperature for 20 min, washed in PBS, and blocked using sterile filtered blocking buffer (0.2% Triton X-100, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% casein, 0.2% gelatin, and 0.02% sodium azide) for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies used were as follows: syndecan 1, syndecan 2, syndecan 3, and syndecan 4 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Primary antibodies were added in blocking buffer, and cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Cells were then washed in PBS and treated with the appropriate secondary antibody (1:2000; Alexa fluor-488 or Alexa fluor-555). Cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, washed in PBS, mounted using Prolong Gold anti-fade reagent containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen), and imaged using a Zeiss Meta 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Cells were serum-starved for 1 h and treated with 2 milliunits/ml heparinase III (Sigma) in serum-free media for 24 h. Cells were seeded at 2 × 105 and allowed to reach ∼80% confluence. Cells were then serum-starved for 2 h, and the appropriate concentration of heparin was added. After 6 h, cells were treated with either PBS or 200 ng/ml rWnt5A (R&D Systems) for a further 16 h. Media and cell lysates were then collected, concentrated in Microcon YM10 columns, and subjected to Western analysis. Cell lysates were prepared using radioimmune precipitation buffer as described previously (2Dissanayake S.K. Wade M. Johnson C.E. O'Connell M.P. Leotlela P.D. French A.D. Shah K.V. Hewitt K.J.

Transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane occurred using the i-Blot (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's protocol. Membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T). Membranes were blocked using 5% milk in TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature with agitation. Primary antibodies were added at appropriate dilutions in 5% milk/TBS-T and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Primary antibodies used were biotinylated Wnt5A (1:100; R&D Systems), PO4-PKC (1:1000; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), anti-Δ-heparan antibody (Seikagaku America, Ijamsville, MD), β-catenin (1:1000; BD Biosciences), and β-tubulin (1:1000; Cell Signaling). Membranes were washed in TBS-T (3 × 5 min), and the appropriate secondary antibody was added in 5% milk/TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature with agitation. The membrane was washed in TBS-T and developed using ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). Cells were seeded at 1 × 105 onto fibronectin-coated 24-well plates (BD Biosciences). Once confluent, a 200-μl pipette tip was heat-sealed, and two scratches were made, one horizontal and one vertical. Images were taken of the same field at 0, 9, or 12 h on a light microscope (Zeiss) at a gain of 1 using phased light. For post-transfection wound-healing assays, the transfection reagents were left on the cells for 5 h, removed, and replaced with media containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were then incubated for 48 h, and then a wound-healing assay was performed as described above. Cells were serum-starved for 2 h and treated with 2 milliunits/ml heparinase III for 24 h and/or rWnt5A or rWnt3A for 16 h. Cells were then seeded at 5 × 105 cells/ml in the heparinase III/Wnt5A serum-free media in the transwell insert of a QCM plate (Millipore, Billerica, MA). RPMI containing 10% fetal bovine serum was placed in the bottom of the plate. Plates were then incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. The cells/media were removed, and the invasion chamber insert was placed into a clean well containing cell stain and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The insert was washed in water, and while the insert was still moist, the non-invading cells and extracellular matrix layer were removed from the interior of the insert. The inserts were allowed to air-dry and then placed in extraction buffer for 15 min at room temperature. 100 μl of the dye mixture was transferred to a 96-well microtiter plate suitable for colorimetric measurement, and the optical density was measured at 570 nm. Negative control, SDC1, and SDC4 siRNA (200 nm; Qiagen, Valencia, CA) were transfected into cells using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen) for 48 h as described previously (2Dissanayake S.K. Wade M. Johnson C.E. O'Connell M.P. Leotlela P.D. French A.D. Shah K.V. Hewitt K.J. Rosenthal D.T. Indig F.E. Jiang Y. Nickoloff B.J. Taub D.D. Trent J.M. Moon R.T. Bittner M. Weeraratna A.T. J. Biol.

The siRNAs used were Invitrogen's “HP-validated siRNAs,” which have been validated to perform efficient knockdown with minimal off-target effects, as well as negative control siRNAs from the same company. These siRNAs are designed with unequal stabilities of the base pairs at the 5′-ends. This enables the antisense strand, which is less tightly bound at its 5′-end, to enter RISC while the sense strand is degraded. Asymmetry produces highly functional siRNAs and reduces the risk of off-target effects caused by the incorrect strand entering RISC. siRNA sequences are as follows: SDC1 sense, r(CGACUGCUUUGGACCUAAA)dTdT; SDC1 antisense, r(UUUAGGUCCAAAGCAGUCG)dTdT; SDC4 sense, r(GGGUGAGGUCAACCUAAUA)dTdT; SDC4 antisense, r(UAUUAGGUUGACCUCACCC)dTdT. RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) as described previously (2Dissanayake S.K. Wade M. Johnson C.E. O'Connell M.P. Leotlela P.D. French A.D. Shah K.V.

RNA was quantified using an ND1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop, Wilmington, DE), and using 1 μg of RNA, cDNA was synthesized using an iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad), and gene expression was quantified using the SYBR Green method of real time PCR. PCRs were performed in triplicate with a 100 nm concentration of each primer. Primers were designed to cross exon-intron junctions, using Primer Bank (available on the World Wide Web; see Table 1). Real time PCR was performed on an ABI Prism 7300 sequence detection system using standard (default) conditions. Samples were normalized against the 18 S gene using Universal 18 S primers (Ambion, Austin, TX). Expression was calculated using the standard curve method.TABLE 1Primer sequencesGeneSequenceSyndecan 15′-TGAAACCTCGGGGGAGAATAC-3′Syndecan 13′-GGTACAGCATGAAACCCACC-5′Syndecan 35′-GACATCCCTGAGAGGAGCAC-3′Syndecan 33′-TCTGGCTCATCCCGGATTGT-5′Syndecan 45′-ACTCCATGATCGGCCCTGAA-3′Syndecan 43′-TGGGGATAACCTCATTCTCCTC-5′ Open table in a new tab Surface biotinylation was performed using a cell surface protein isolation kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL), following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cells were grown in four T75 flasks to 90–95% confluence and labeled using sulfosuccinimidyl 2-(biotinamido)-ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate. Cells were lysed and then sonicated on low power and incubated for 30 min on ice. The labeled proteins were then isolated using NeutrAvidin-agarose columns. A trace amount of bromphenol blue was added to eluate. Samples were analyzed by Western blot. Cell membrane proteins were isolated using a MEM-PER kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 5 × 106 cells/sample were incubated on ice with the different components of the kit (reagents A, B, and C) and then incubated for 20 min in a 37 °C water bath. Tubes were centrifuged at room temperature for 2 min at 10,000 × g to isolate the hydrophobic fraction from the hydrophilic fraction. All fractions were diluted 2-fold to prevent band and lane distortion with the membrane fraction. Protein levels were quantified using a BCA protein kit, and 50 μg of protein was run on a 4–20% Tris/glycine gel. Western images were saved as Tiff files and inverted, and integrated density was analyzed. Densitometry was performed on at least three independent experiments using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), and values were normalized to β-tubulin. Student's t test was performed when required in at least three independent experiments. Significance was designated as follows: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001. We have previously described the melanoma cells used in this study as having differing Wnt5A levels and differing metastatic ability (2Dissanayake S.K. Wade M. Johnson C.E. O'Connell M.P. Leotlela P.D. French A.D. Shah K.V. Hewitt K.J. Rosenthal D.T. Indig F.E. Jiang Y. Nickoloff B.J. Taub D.D. Trent J.M. Moon R.T. Bittner M. Weeraratna A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17259-17271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). We used 35S labeling to examine the incorporation of sulfate into HSPG-specific GAG chains. More metastatic cells incorporated more sulfate (Fig. 1A), which may indicate several possible changes in HSPG core levels, side-chain synthesis, or elongation. To determine if total sulfated GAG levels increase in more metastatic cells, we also performed a DMB binding assay. DMB binding was increased in highly metastatic UACC647 cells as compared with less metastatic G361 cells (Fig. 1B). To investigate whether HSPGs could affect downstream Wnt5A signaling, heparinase III treatment was performed to cleave the HSPG backbone. Following treatment, cells were probed with an anti-Δ-heparan sulfate antibody that only recognizes a neo epitope created by heparinase III cleavage, and then analyzed by immunofluorescent confocal microscopy. As shown, only cells treated with heparinase III demonstrate antibody binding by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1C). This same antibody was also used to analyze media from heparinase III-treated cells in order to determine whether cleaved GAG chains could be seen in the media. As shown, increased levels of HSPG GAG chains can be seen in the treated samples as compared with the untreated control (Fig. 1D, upper panels). The lowly metastatic G361 cells have lower amounts of GAG chains. Upon heparinase III treatment, increased levels of Wnt5A can also be seen in the media (Fig. 1D, lower panels) in the Wnt5A high lines but not in the G361 cells, which have low Wnt5A expression. This increase of Wnt5A in the medium suggested one of two scenarios: 1) HSPGs may promote Wnt5A retention at the surface of the cell, in order to promote its internalization for autocrine signaling, and HSPG cleavage released Wnt5A into the medium, or 2) HSPGs may be affecting some other factor that, upon heparinase cleavage, increases Wnt5A production and secretion. To determine which of these scenarios was the case, cells were treated with heparinase III, protein was collected, and Western analysis was performed. We have previously demonstrated that Wnt5A signaling increases PKC activity as well as cell motility (3Dissanayake S.K. Olkhanud P.B. O'Connell M.P. Carter A. French A.D. Camilli T.C. Emeche C.D. Hewitt K.J. Rosenthal D.T. Leotlela P.D. Wade M.S. Yang S.W. Brant L. Nickoloff B.J. Messina J.L. Biragyn A. Hoek K.S. Taub D.D. Longo D.L. Sondak V.K. Hewitt S.M. Weeraratna A.T. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 10205-10214Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Thus, if HSPGs promote the retention and internalization of Wnt5A, increasing its signaling, then heparinase III treatment should release Wnt5A from the surface. This would result in a decreased ability of Wnt5A to signal and mediate motility. If, instead, HSPG cleavage results in increased production of Wnt5A and secretion into the medium, due to the release of a secondary factor, then we should see increased levels of cellular Wnt5A and increased PKC activity. As demonstrated, levels of PO4-PKC did not increase upon treatment with heparinase III (Fig. 1E) and in fact decreased by about 20 and 40%, respectively (based on densitometry). Cellular Wnt5A levels also decreased, confirming that the increased levels of Wnt5A in the media upon heparinase III treatment were not due to increased production of Wnt5A (Fig. 1E). This could be confirmed by immunofluorescent confocal microscopy, where cellular levels of Wnt5A were decreased after treatment with heparinase III (Fig. 1F), indicating a decrease in its internalization in the absence of HS. As we have previously demonstrated, Wnt signaling in melanoma is dependent on its internalization. 4O'Connell, M. P., Fiori, J. L., Xu, M., Carter, A. D., Frank, B. P., Camilli, T. C., French, A.

https://openalex.org/W2140973199,"We previously identified curcumin as a potent inducer of fibroblast apoptosis, which could be used to treat hypertrophic scar formation. Here we investigated the underlying mechanism of this process.Curcumin-induced apoptosis could not be blocked by caspase-inhibitors and we could not detect any caspase-3/7 activity. Curcumin predominantly induced mitochondria-mediated ROS formation and stimulated the expression of the redox-sensitive pro-apoptotic factor p53. Inhibition of the pro-apoptotic signaling enzyme glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) blocked curcumin-induced apoptosis. Apoptosis was associated with high molecular weight DNA damage, a possible indicator of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) activity. Indeed, curcumin caused nuclear translocation of AIF, which could be blocked by the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine. We next investigated how AIF is effluxed from mitochondria in more detail. The permeability transition pore complex (PTPC), of which the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) is a component, could be involved since the VDAC-inhibitor DIDS (4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid) efficiently blocked AIF translocation. However, PTPC is not involved in AIF release since cyclosporine A, a specific inhibitor of the complex did not block apoptosis. Alternatively, the pro-apoptotic protein Bax could have formed mitochondrial channels and interacted with VDAC. Curcumin caused mitochondrial translocation of Bax, which was blocked by DIDS, suggesting a Bax-VDAC interaction. Interestingly, ceramide channels can also release apoptogenic factors from mitochondria and we found that addition of ceramide induced caspase-independent apoptosis. Surprisingly, this process could also be blocked by DIDS, suggesting the concerted action of Bax, VDAC and ceramide in the efflux of AIF from the mitochondrion.Curcumin-induced fibroblast apoptosis is totally caspase-independent and relies on the mitochondrial formation of ROS and the subsequent nuclear translocation of AIF, which is released from a mitochondrial pore that involves VDAC, Bax and possibly ceramides. The composition of the AIF-releasing channel seems to be much more complex than previously thought."

LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1) regulates actin cytoskeletal remodeling by phosphorylating and inactivating cofilin, an actin filament-disassembling factor. In this study, we investigated the role of LIMK1 in calcium signal-induced neurite outgrowth. The calcium ionophore ionomycin induced LIMK1 activation and cofilin phosphorylation in Neuro-2a neuroblastoma cells. Knockdown of LIMK1 or expression of a kinase-dead mutant of LIMK1 suppressed ionomycin-induced cofilin phosphorylation and neurite outgrowth in Neuro-2a cells. Ionomycin-induced cofilin phosphorylation and neurite outgrowth were also blocked by KN-93, an inhibitor of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs), and STO-609, an inhibitor of CaMK kinase. An active form of CaMKIV but not CaMKI enhanced Thr-508 phosphorylation of LIMK1 and increased the kinase activity of LIMK1. Moreover, the active form of CaMKIV induced cofilin phosphorylation and neurite outgrowth, and a dominant negative form of CaMKIV suppressed ionomycin-induced neurite outgrowth. Taken together, our results suggest that LIMK1-mediated cofilin phosphorylation is critical for ionomycin-induced neurite outgrowth and that CaMKIV mediates ionomycin-induced LIMK1 activation.

Actin cytoskeletal remodeling is essential for cell morphological changes, motility, and migration.

Calcium ion is a critical second messenger that mediates a variety of neuronal functions, including neurite outgrowth, axonal guidance, neuronal differentiation, synaptic plasticity, and memory formation.

However, little is known about the signaling pathways that transduce the intracellular Ca2+ elevation into actin cytoskeletal remodeling for neurite outgrowth. In this study, we investigated the role of LIMK1 in the calcium signal-induced neurite outgrowth in Neuro-2a mouse neuroblastoma cells. We provide evidence that LIMK1-mediated cofilin phosphorylation plays a crucial role in ionomycin-induced neurite outgrowth and that CaMKIV mediates the ionomycin-induced LIMK1 activation. Ionomycin and puromycin were purchased from Sigma. KN-93 and STO-609 were purchased from Wako (Osaka, Japan).

A plasmid encoding HA-tagged human MARK2 was constructed by subcloning the PCR-amplified MARK2 cDNA into the pUCD2-2HA vector. The cDNA for the kinase-inactive MARK2(K49A) mutant was constructed using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech). The shRNA-targeting constructs were generated using pSUPER or pSUPER.retro.puro vector plasmids (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA), as described previously (39Horita Y. Ohashi K. Mukai M. Inoue M. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6013-6021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The 19-base sequences targeting mouse LIMK1 were 5′-GAAGGACTACTGGGCCCGC-3′ for the pSUPER-LIMK1 shRNA and 5′-GCTGGAACAATGGCTAGAA-3′ for the pSUPER. retro.puro-LIMK1 shRNA. As a control, we used a nontargeting sequence, 5′-TCTTCCCCCAAGAAAGATA-3′, which does not exist in the mouse genome. Neuro-2a cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CCL-131) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected with expression plasmids or shRNA plasmids using FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). For testing the effect of LIMK1 knockdown on ionomycin-induced cofilin phosphorylation, Neuro-2a cells plated in 100-mm dishes (1.5 × 106 cells/dish) were cultured for 20 h and then transfected with pSUPER.retro.puro-LIMK1 shRNA. Transfected cells were cultured for 24 h and selected by culturing for an additional 48 h with 7 μg/ml puromycin. Then cells were replated on 60-mm dishes (2.0 × 106 cells/dish), cultured for 16 h, serum-starved for 4 h, and then cultured with or without 1.5 μm ionomycin for 30 min. For neurite outgrowth assays, Neuro-2a cells were plated on coverslips (2.5 × 104 cells/35-mm dish), cultured for 24 h, and transfected with pSUPER-LIMK1 shRNA. After incubation for 24 h, the cells were treated with 1.5 μm ionomycin, cultured for 48 h, and then fixed. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation or immunoblot analyses, as described previously (32Okano I. Hiraoka J. Otera H. Nunoue K. Ohashi K. Iwashita S. Hirai M. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31321-31330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Endogenous LIMK1 or Myc-LIMK1 expressed in Neuro-2a cells was immunoprecipitated with an anti-LIMK1 or anti-Myc antibody and then subjected to an in vitro kinase reaction using His6-cofilin as a substrate, as described previously (12Ohashi K. Nagata K. Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3577-3582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). CaMKI- or CaMKIV-catalyzed LIMK1 activation was analyzed in cell-free assays as follows. GFP-tagged CaMKI or CaMKIV mutants were expressed in Neuro-2a cells, immunoprecipitated with an anti-GFP antibody, and incubated in 20 μl of lysis buffer containing 50 μm ATP and 185 kBq of [γ-32P]ATP (110 TBq/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with 1 μg/ml GST-LIMK1 and 2 μg/ml His6-cofilin at 30 °C for 30 min. GST-LIMK1 and His6-cofilin were expressed in Sf21 insect cells, using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen), and purified by glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare), as described (40Kurita S. Watanabe Y. Gunji E. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32542-32552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was separated with SDS-PAGE and analyzed with autoradiography to measure 32P-labeled cofilin and immunoblotting with an anti-P-LIMK1(T508) antibody. Neuro-2a cells (2.5 × 104 cells/35-mm dish) were plated on glass coverslips pretreated with 1 μg/ml poly-l-lysine, cultured for 24 h, and transfected with expression plasmids or pSUPER shRNA plasmids. After incubation for 24 h, cells were treated or not treated with 1.5 μm ionomycin and further cultured for 48 h. Then the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min. The CFP-positive cells with neurites longer than two cell body lengths were scored as neurite-bearing cells. Previous studies showed that ionomycin promotes neurite outgrowth in Neuro-2a cells (23Wu G. Fang Y. Lu Z.H. Ledeen R.W. J. Neurocytol. 1998; 27: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 24Uboha N.V. Flajolet M. Nairn A.C. Picciotto M.R. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4413-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To examine whether LIMK1 is involved in ionomycin-induced neurite outgrowth, we first analyzed changes in the kinase activity of LIMK1 and the level of P-cofilin in ionomycin-stimulated Neuro-2a cells. In an in vitro kinase assay using cofilin as a substrate, the kinase activity of LIMK1 increased 1.6-fold by 30 min after ionomycin stimulation and then gradually decreased (Fig. 1A). The level of P-cofilin, measured by immunoblotting with an anti-P-cofilin antibody, increased 2.2-fold by 30 min after ionomycin treatment and then gradually decreased (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that ionomycin treatment increases both LIMK1 activity and cofilin phosphorylation in Neuro-2a cells. To assess whether LIMK1 is involved in ionomycin-induced cofilin phosphorylation, we knocked down LIMK1 by transfecting Neuro-2a cells with shRNA targeting LIMK1. Neuro-2a cells were transfected with pSUPER.retro.puro plasmids coding for control or LIMK1 shRNA target sequences and selected with puromycin. An immunoblot analysis showed that the LIMK1 shRNA suppressed expression of endogenous LIMK1 in Neuro-2a cells (Fig. 2A). The LIMK1 shRNA but not the control shRNA blocked ionomycin-induced cofilin phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, overexpression of a kinase-dead form of LIMK1, LIMK1(D460A), in which the catalytic Asp-460 was replaced by Ala, significantly suppressed the ionomycin-induced elevation of the P-cofilin level in Neuro-2a cells (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that LIMK1 plays a critical role in ionomycin-induced cofilin phosphorylation in Neuro-2a cells. To examine the role of LIMK1 in ionomycin-induced neurite outgrowth, we analyzed the effect of LIMK1 knockdown on neurite outgrowth in Neuro-2a cells. Neuro-2a cells were cotransfected with CFP and control or LIMK1 shRNA plasmids, cultured for 24 h, and then stimulated with ionomycin for 48 h. The cells were fixed, and the CFP fluorescence of the shRNA-transfected cells was visualized (Fig. 3A, top). We then scored the percentage of neurite-bearing cells with neurites longer than two cell body lengths in CFP-positive cells. Knockdown of LIMK1 almost completely blocked ionomycin-induced neurite outgrowth (Fig. 3A, bottom). Overexpression of kinase-dead LIMK1(D460A) also inhibited ionomycin-induced neurite outgrowth (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that LIMK1 plays a crucial role in ionomycin-induced neurite outgrowth in Neuro-2a cells and that LIMK1(D460A) functions as a dominant negative form. To determine whether CaMKs and CaMKK are involved in ionomycin-induced cofilin phosphorylation and neurite outgrowth, we examined the effects of KN-93 and STO-609. KN-93 inhibits the kinase activities of CaMKI, CaMKII, and CaMKIV, and STO-609 inhibits CaMKK, which activates CaMKI and CaMKIV but not CaMKII. When Neuro-2a cells were pretreated with KN-93 or STO-609, ionomycin-induced cofilin phosphorylation was almost completely blocked (Fig. 4A), and ionomycin-induced neurite outgrowth was significantly suppressed (Fig. 4, B and C). Thus, CaMKK and one or both of its downstream kinases, CaMKI and CaMKIV, are involved in ionomycin-induced cofilin phosphorylation and neurite outgrowth. We next examined whether CaMKI and CaMKIV have the potential to activate LIMK1. We tested the effects of coexpressing constitutively active or kinase-dead forms of CaMKs on the kinase activity of Myc-LIMK1 in Neuro-2a cells. Coexpression of an active form of CaMKIV, CaMKIV-(1–313), increased the kinase activity of Myc-LIMK1 2.7-fold (Fig. 5A). In contrast, coexpression of an active form of CaMKI, CaMKI-(1–293), had no apparent effect on the kinase activity of Myc-LIMK1 (Fig. 5A). Expression of a kinase-dead form of CaMKI, CaMKI-(K49E), or CaMKIV, CaMKIV-(K71E), also did not affect Myc-LIMK1 activity. The kinase-inactive Myc-LIMK1(D460A), when coexpressed with active CaMKs, did not exhibit any cofilin-phosphorylating activity (data not shown). These results indicate that CaMKIV but not CaMKI has the potential to activate LIMK1. To determine whether CaMKIV directly activates LIMK1, GST-LIMK1 was expressed with a baculovirus expression system, purified with glutathione-Sepharose, and incubated with active or inactive CaMKIV. The kinase activity of GST-LIMK1 was measured using cofilin as a substrate. CaMKIV-(1–313) but not CaMKIV-(K71E) increased the kinase activity of GST-LIMK1 (Fig. 5B). Because ROCK and PAK activate LIMK1 by phosphorylating Thr-508 (10Edwards D.C. Sanders L.C. Bokoch G.M. Gill G.N. Nat.

CaMKIV-(1–313) but not CaMKIV-(K71E) increased the level of P-LIMK1(T508) (Fig. 5B, third panel), indicating that CaMKIV phosphorylates LIMK1 at Thr-508. In contrast, neither CaMKI-(1–293) nor CaMKI-(K49E) affected LIMK1 kinase activity or the level of P-LIMK1 (Fig. 5C). These results further indicate that CaMKIV but not CaMKI has the potential to activate LIMK1. CaMKIV is activated by CaMKK-catalyzed phosphorylation at Thr-196 (34Kasahara J. Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 26: 9061-9067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To examine whether CaMKIV is activated by ionomycin stimulation, we analyzed changes in the level of Thr-196 phosphorylation of CaMKIV in ionomycin-stimulated Neuro-2a cells by immunoblotting with an anti-P-CaMKIV(T196) antibody. The level of P-CaMKIV(T196) increased about 2.0-fold by 10 min after ionomycin stimulation (Fig. 6A), which suggests that ionomycin induces CaMKIV activation in Neuro-2a cells. We also analyzed whether active CaMKIV induces cofilin phosphorylation in Neuro-2a cells. Expression of CaMKIV-(1–313) but not CaMKIV-(K71E) increased the level of P-cofilin (Fig. 6B). These results further support the notion that CaMKIV mediates ionomycin-induced cofilin phosphorylation. In addition, we also examined whether CaMKI is activated by ionomycin by measuring the level of Thr-177 phosphorylation of CaMKI (35Han F. Nakano T. Yamamoto Y. Shioda N. Lu Y.M. Fukunaga K. Brain Res. 2009; 1265: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The level of P-CaMKI(T177) increased 5–10 min after ionomycin treatment (Fig. 6C). Thus, CaMKI is also activated by ionomycin treatment in Neuro-2a cells. Previous studies showed that CaMKI is involved in neurite outgrowth (24Uboha N.V. Flajolet M. Nairn A.C. Picciotto M.R. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4413-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 25Wayman G.A. Kaech S. Grant W.F. Davare M. Impey S. Tokumitsu H. Nozaki N. Banker G. Soderling T.R. J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 24064-24072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To further examine the roles of CaMKI and CaMKIV in ionomycin-induced neurite outgrowth in Neuro-2a cells, we analyzed the effects of expressing the constitutively active and dominant negative forms of these CaMKs. Expression of a dominant negative form of either CaMKI or CaMKIV (CaMKI-(K49E) or CaMKIV-(K71E)) significantly suppressed ionomycin-induced neurite outgrowth (Fig. 7). In addition, expression of a constitutively active mutant of CaMKI or CaMKIV (CaMKI-(1–293) or CaMKIV-(1–313)) promoted neurite outgrowth in Neuro-2a cells (Fig. 7). These results suggest that both CaMKI and CaMKIV are involved in ionomycin-induced neurite outgrowth in Neuro-2a cells. A previous study showed that CaMKI induced neurite outgrowth by activating MARK2 (24Uboha N.V. Flajolet M. Nairn A.C. Picciotto M.R. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4413-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In order to understand the mechanism by which active CaMKI induces neurite outgrowth, we examined the effect of a kinase-dead form of MARK2 (MARK2(K49A)) on CaMKI-(1–293)-induced neuritogenesis. Coexpression of MARK2(K49A) significantly suppressed CaMKI-(1–293)-induced neurite outgrowth in Neuro-2a cells (Fig. 8), which suggests that CaMKI-induced neurite outgrowth is mediated by MARK2. In this study, we identified a novel signaling pathway that is crucial for calcium signal-induced neurite outgrowth. We showed that ionomycin induces LIMK1 activation and cofilin phosphorylation and that depletion of LIMK1 or expression of kinase-dead LIMK1 blocks ionomycin-induced cofilin phosphorylation and neurite outgrowth. This indicates that LIMK1 mediates calcium signal-induced cofilin phosphorylation and neurite outgrowth. The findings that ionomycin-induced cofilin phosphorylation and neurite outgrowth were blocked by STO-609 and KN-93 indicate that CaMKK-mediated activation of CaMKI and/or CaMKIV is involved in calcium signal-induced cofilin phosphorylation and neurite outgrowth. Interestingly, an active form of CaMKIV but not CaMKI increased the kinase activity of LIMK1 in both cell-free and coexpression assays. Furthermore, expression of active CaMKIV enhanced cofilin phosphorylation and neurite outgrowth, and a dominant negative form of CaMKIV inhibited ionomycin-induced neurite outgrowth. Based on these observations, we propose a novel signaling pathway composed of CaMKK-CaMKIV-LIMK1-cofilin that plays a crucial role in calcium signal-induced neurite outgrowth in Neuro-2a cells. The level of LIMK1 activation in response to ionomycin is small relative to the effect on neurite extension. This may reflect that ionomycin induces LIMK1 activation in the limited region of the cell, such as the site where neurites start to grow. It has been proposed that the CaMKK-CaMKIV cascade is involved in calcium-induced neurite growth through phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor CREB (27Enslen H. Sun P. Brickey D.

On the other hand, we showed here that the CaMKK-CaMKIV pathway contributes to ionomycin-induced neurite outgrowth through LIMK1 activation and cofilin phosphorylation. These results suggest that CaMKIV plays dual roles in calcium-induced neurite outgrowth: the short term role of promoting the initiation of neurite outgrowth via LIMK1 activation and actin reorganization and the long term role of contributing to neurite extension and maintenance via activation of CREB-dependent gene transcription. Although CaMKIV is predominantly localized in the nucleus, it is also distributed in the cytoplasm and has the potential to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (41Jensen K.F. Ohmstede C.A. Fisher R.S. Sahyoun N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 2850-2853Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 42Wu J.Y. Gonzalez-Robayna I.J. Richards J.S. Means A.R.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 942-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that LIMK1 is activated by CaMKIV in the cytoplasm. On the other hand, given that LIMK1 also shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm using its intrinsic nuclear export and nuclear localization signals (44Yang N. Higuchi O. Mizuno K. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 242-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 45Yang N. Mizuno K. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 793-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), LIMK1 may be activated in the nucleus and then transported to the cytoplasm to regulate actin cytoskeleton in this region. Similar to the effects of CaMKIV mutants, expression of an active form of CaMKI induced neurite outgrowth, and a dominant negative form of CaMKI suppressed ionomycin-induced neurite outgrowth in Neuro-2a cells, thus indicating that CaMKI, like CaMKIV, plays a crucial role in calcium signal-induced neurite outgrowth. Although CaMKI has been shown to activate Rac (an upstream regulator of LIMK1) through activation of Rac-guanine nucleotide exchange factors, such as STEF and βPIX (46Takemoto-Kimura S. Ageta-Ishihara N. Nonaka M. Adachi-Morishima A. Mano T. Okamura M. Fujii H. Fuse T. Hoshino M. Suzuki S. Kojima M. Mishina M. Okuno H. Bito H.

Neuron. 2008; 57: 94-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), CaMKI failed to activate LIMK1 in our coexpression experiments in Neuro-2a cells (Fig. 5A). Thus, CaMKI acts in neurite outgrowth by a mechanism distinct from Rac-mediated LIMK1 activation, at least in Neuro-2a cells. In this respect, previous studies showed that CaMKI induced neurite outgrowth by activating extracellular signal-regulated kinase, which in turn stimulated CREB-dependent transcription (22Wayman G.A. Lee Y.S. Tokumitsu H. Silva A. Soderling T.R. Neuron. 2008; 59: 914-931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 26Schmitt J.M. Wayman G.A. Nozaki N. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24064-24072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), or by activating MARK2 (24Uboha N.V. Flajolet M. Nairn A.C. Picciotto M.R. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4413-4423Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We showed that expression of kinase-dead MARK2 suppressed CaMKI-induced neurite outgrowth, indicating that MARK2 mediates CaMKI-induced neuritogenesis. Because MARK2 regulates microtubule reorganization by phosphorylating microtubule-associated proteins (48Biernat J. Wu Y.Z. Timm T. Zheng-Fischhöfer Q. Mandelkow E. Meijer L. Mandelkow E.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4013-4028Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), it is likely that CaMKI contributes to neurite outgrowth by regulating microtubule dynamics via MARK2, in addition to activating CREB-mediated gene expression. Thus, calcium signals induce neurite outgrowth by stimulating several pathways, including the CaMKIV-mediated LIMK1 activation that induces actin remodeling and the CaMKI-mediated MARK2 activation that regulates microtubule dynamics as well as the CaMKI/CaMKIV-mediated transcriptional activation of CREB. It is thus likely that the coordinated regulation of actin filaments and microtubules is necessary for the induction of neurite outgrowth. Because CaMKIV increased the level of Thr-508 phosphorylation of LIMK1 in a cell-free assay, it is likely that CaMKIV directly activates LIMK1 by Thr-508 phosphorylation. We and other investigators previously showed that ROCK and PAK activate LIMK1 by phosphorylation at Thr-508, which is in the activation loop within the kinase domain of LIMK1 (10Edwards D.C. Sanders L.C. Bokoch G.M. Gill G.N. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 11Maekawa M. Ishizaki T. Boku S. Watanabe N. Fujita A. Iwamatsu A. Obinata T. Ohashi K.

Chem. 2000; 275: 3577-3582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Thus, various signaling pathways, such as Rho-ROCK, Rac-PAK1, and CaMKK-CaMKIV, activate LIMK1 by the same mechanism, Thr-508 phosphorylation. This suggests that LIMK1 activation is a point of convergence that links various signaling pathways to the regulation of actin cytoskeletal reorganization in cells. Previous studies showed that knockdown of LIMK1 or inhibition of LIMK1 activity suppresses neurite outgrowth in PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells, chick dorsal root ganglion neurons, and hippocampal pyramidal neurons (18Rosso S.

Chem. 2007; 282: 13692-13702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), which suggests that LIMK1 has a critical role in neurite outgrowth. On the other hand, overexpression of LIMK1 or depletion of SSH1/SSH2 also suppressed neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells and chick dorsal root ganglion neurons (16Endo M. Ohashi K. Sasaki Y. Goshima Y. Niwa R. Uemura T. Mizuno K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 2527-2537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Endo M. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13692-13702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). These results indicate that a precise level of LIMK1 activation and a proper balance of cofilin phosphorylation and dephosphorylation by LIMK and SSH activities are necessary for neurite outgrowth. We previously showed that calcium signals induce SSH1 activation and cofilin dephosphorylation via calcineurin in other types of cells (49Wang Y. Shibasaki F. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 12683-12689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that calcium signals stimulate both LIMK1 and SSH1 to regulate the actin cytoskeleton and that the spatial and temporal regulation of LIMK1 and SSH1 activities and the balance between them are important for the control of neurite outgrowth. Because LIMK1 depletion inhibits stimulus-induced actin filament assembly (20Endo M. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13692-13702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 50Nishita M. Tomizawa C. Yamamoto M. Horita Y. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), LIMK1 is probably involved in the actin filament assembly and stabilization required for the initial phase of neurite outgrowth. In contrast, cofilin is required for neurite extension because it stimulates actin filament disassembly and thereby supplies actin monomers to the leading edge of the extending growth cones (5Pollard T.D. Borisy G.G. Cell. 2003; 112: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3278) Google Scholar, 51Kiuchi T. Ohashi K. Kurita S. Mizuno K. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar); therefore, SSH is likely involved in the neurite extension by promoting actin filament turnover via cofilin dephosphorylation and reactivation. In conclusion, we have identified a novel signaling pathway that transduces calcium elevations into LIMK1 activation and actin cytoskeletal reorganization via CaMKK and CaMKIV. We have the data that brain-derived neurotrophic factor induces LIMK1 activation in primary rat cortical neurons and that expression of dominant negative CaMKIV or depletion of LIMK1 blocked brain-derived neurotrophic factor-induced dendritogenesis, which suggests that the CaMKIV-LIMK1 pathway is probably involved in brain-derived neurotrophic factor-induced dendritogenesis in primary neurons. In further studies, we will elucidate the roles of this signaling pathway in a variety of calcium-induced actin cytoskeletal responses in neuronal and non-neuronal cells. Calcium signals regulate various important neural functions and development, including axon guidance, dendrite arborization, spine morphology, synaptic plasticity, and learning and memory formation. Actin cytoskeletal remodeling mediated by the LIMK1-cofilin pathway plays an important role in the dynamics of dendritic spine structures, persistence of long term potentiation, and synaptic plasticity (52Meng Y.

Therefore, CaMKIV-mediated LIMK1 activation and cofilin phosphorylation may be among the important mechanisms by which calcium signals regulate synaptic plasticity and higher order brain functions, in addition to those needed for neurite outgrowth. Our identification of the CaMKIV-LIMK1 pathway will help to elucidate the mechanisms by which actin cytoskeletal remodeling is regulated in response to various stimuli mediated by calcium signaling.

The serine/threonine kinase Akt plays a critical role in this process of adaptation. We previously reported that transgenic overexpression of an active form of Akt (Akt-E40K) in mice results in increased cardiac contractility and cell size, as well as improved sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ handling. Because it is not fully elucidated, we decided to study the molecular mechanism by which Akt-E40K overexpression improves SR Ca2+ handling. To this end, SR Ca2+ uptake and the phosphorylation status of phospholamban (PLN) were evaluated in heart extracts from wild-type and Akt-E40K mice and mice harboring inducible and cardiac specific knock-out of phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase-1, the upstream activator of Akt. Moreover, the effect of Akt was assessed in vitro by overexpressing a mutant Akt targeted preferentially to the SR, and by biochemical assays to evaluate potential interaction with PLN. We found that when activated, Akt interacts with and phosphorylates PLN at Thr17, the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent kinase IIδ site, whereas silencing Akt signaling, through the knock-out of phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase-1, resulted in reduced phosphorylation of PLN at Thr17. Furthermore, overexpression of SR-targeted Akt in cardiomyocytes improved Ca2+ handling without affecting cell size. Thus, we describe here a new mechanism whereby the preferential translocation of Akt to the SR is responsible for enhancement of contractility without stimulation of hypertrophy.

Our group has previously described a Tg mouse model (Akt-E40K Tg) expressing an Akt with a mutation (E40K) located in its pleckstrin homology domain. This mutation renders Akt constitutively active in a manner similar to stimulation with growth factor (5Condorelli G. Drusco A. Stassi G. Bellacosa A. Roncarati R. Iaccarino G. Russo M.A. Gu Y. Dalton N. Chung C. Latronico M.V. Napoli C. Sadoshima J. Croce C.M. Ross Jr., J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 12333-12338Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The occurrence of increased CM size with preservation of cardiac contractility constitutes an intriguing aspect of this mouse model. Single cell studies revealed not only increased inotropism but also enhanced lusitropism and an increase in systolic calcium (Ca2+) transients in adult CMs isolated from this Tg mouse (5Condorelli G. Drusco A. Stassi G. Bellacosa A. Roncarati R. Iaccarino G. Russo M.A. Gu Y. Dalton N. Chung C. Latronico M.V. Napoli C. Sadoshima J. Croce C.M. Ross Jr., J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Enhanced contractility secondary to improved Ca2+ handling is also a feature of a Tg mouse line with nuclear overexpression of Akt (16Rota M. Boni A. Urbanek K. Padin-Iruegas M.E. Kajstura T.J. Fiore G. Kubo H. Sonnenblick E.H. Musso E. Houser S.R. Leri A. Sussman M.A. Anversa P. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1332-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the Akt-E40K Tg mouse, an increase in protein kinase A (PKA) activity inducing phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLN) at residue Ser16 was reported to occur in that model. These features raise relevant questions regarding the specific mechanisms by which Akt controls Ca2+ handling. At the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) the activity of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA)2a, a pump that transports Ca2+ from the cytosol to the SR lumenal space, is dependent on PLN. In its dephosphorylated state, PLN binds to SERCA2a and inhibits Ca2+ pump activity, whereas phosphorylation of PLN disrupts the interaction with SERCA2a, relieving Ca2+ pump inhibition and enhancing relaxation rate and contractility (17MacLennan D.H. Kranias E.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 566-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Relief from the inhibitory effects of PLN is the principal contributor to the positive inotropic and lusitropic effects of β-adrenergic agonists (17MacLennan D.H. Kranias E.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 566-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). The activity of PLN is inhibited by protein kinase A (PKA) and Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CAMK)IIδ, which phosphorylate PLN at Ser16 and Thr17, respectively (17MacLennan D.H. Kranias E.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 566-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of PLN by PKA was demonstrated to be a prerequisite for subsequent phosphorylation by CAMKIIδ following β-adrenergic agonist stimulation (18Luo W. Chu G. Sato Y. Zhou Z. Kadambi V.J. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4734-4739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of PLN at Ser16 was also reported to be sufficient to mediate the inotropic responses of the heart to β-adrenergic agonists (19Chu G. Lester J.W. Young K.B. Luo W. Zhai J. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38938-38943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, during other types of stimuli, such as ischemia or frequency-dependent stimuli, Thr17, but not Ser16, becomes phosphorylated, suggesting that phosphorylation at Thr17 is more relevant than that of Ser16 under certain conditions (17MacLennan D.H. Kranias E.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 566-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar, 20Hagemann D. Kuschel M. Kuramochi T. Zhu W. Cheng H. Xiao R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22532-22536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was recently reported that PLN phosphorylation at Ser16 is determined by increased protein levels of adenyl cyclase VI (21Gao M.H. Tang T. Guo T. Miyanohara A. Yajima T. Pestonjamasp K. Feramisco J.R. Hammond H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 33527-33535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This adenyl cyclase overexpression was shown to be associated not with PKA activation but rather with phosphorylation of Akt and its substantial relocalization to the nucleus that, similar to results obtained in nuclear Akt Tg mice (16Rota M. Boni A. Urbanek K. Padin-Iruegas M.E. Kajstura T.J. Fiore G. Kubo H. Sonnenblick E.H. Musso E. Houser S.R. Leri A. Sussman M.A. Anversa P. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1332-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), resulted in Ser16 PLN phosphorylation. In this study, we demonstrate that upon physiological activation Akt translocates to the SR where it interacts with and phosphorylates PLN at Thr17. This leads to improved contractility without stimulating hypertrophic growth normally associated with Akt. All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The generation of Tg mice with cardiac specific overexpression of constitutively active Akt (Akt-E40K) has been described previously (5Condorelli G. Drusco A. Stassi G. Bellacosa A. Roncarati R.

Cardiac specific PDK1-inducible knock-out (KO) mice (MerCreMer α-MHC PDK1) were generated as described elsewhere (11Catalucci D. Zhang D.H. DeSantiago J. Aimond F. Barbara G. Chemin J. Bonci D.

Adult and neonatal mouse CMs were isolated according to published procedures (15Kim Y.K. Kim S.J. Yatani A. Huang Y. Castelli G. Vatner D.E. Liu J. Zhang Q. Diaz G. Zieba R. Thaisz J. Drusco A.

Adult CMs were from age-matched mice between 8 and 13 weeks of age. 1-Day-old neonatal mouse CMs were loaded with the Ca2+ indicator fura 4-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) by incubating the cells in Tyrode's solution (in mm, 121 NaCl, 4.6 KCl, 1.2 CaCl2, 1.2 MgSO4, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 15 glucose, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 2 μmol/liter fura 4-AM for 20 min. The cells were then washed with Tyrode's solution and incubated for 30 min. One more wash was performed before mounting the chamber on an epifluorescence inverted microscope (Nikon TS100) with an attached CCD camera (Ionoptix MyoCam, Ionoptix, Milton, MA). The coverslip was superfused with Tyrode's solution at room temperature at a rate of 20 ml/h. Cells were stimulated using an external stimulator, and Ca2+ concentration was measured using a dual excitation spectrofluorometer that detects the fluorescence excited by UV light at 360 and 380 nm with an emission at 505 nm. Homogenization of pulverized ventricular tissue from WT and Tg mouse hearts, as well as isolation of SR-enriched microsomes and cytosolic fractions, was done according to published procedures (23Said M.

Osada M. Dhalla N.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C384-C391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SR Ca2+ uptake assays were performed on ventricular homogenates at room temperature based on a protocol by Pagani and Solaro (25Pagani E.D. Solaro R.J. Methods Pharmacol. 1984; 5: 49-61Google Scholar) and modified in the Dillmann laboratory (26Zhang T. Johnson E.N. Gu Y. Morissette M.R. Sah V.P. Gigena M.S. Belke D.D. Dillmann W.H. Rogers T.B. Schulman H. Ross Jr., J. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1261-1267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). When used, 40 μm Akt-IV (Calbiochem), 5 μm AIP, or 5 μm KN93 was preincubated with homogenized aliquots at room temperature before adding ATP. CMs were cultured in serum-free medium for 3 h prior to stimulation with 0.1 mm insulin for 40 min. When necessary, cells were pretreated with inhibitors (0.1 mm KN93 or 10 μm AKT inhibitor IV) for 10 min. These reagents were obtained from Calbiochem. At the end of the stimulation period, cells were rinsed in ice-cold PBS and scraped on ice in lysis buffer (in mm, 150 NaCl, 50 Tris, pH 7.5, 30 NaF, 0.1 Na3VO4, and 1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 1% Triton X-100 and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Roche Applied Science). Lysates were cleared (14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C) and analyzed by Western blotting. Hearts from Tg and WT mice were homogenized at 4 °C in 1 ml of homogenization buffer (in mm, 25 imidazole, pH 7.0, 150 KCl, containing 0.1% Triton, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture) with a Teflon glass Thomas tissue grinder. After a 20-min centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C, 50 ml of mono-HA11 beads (Covance Babco, affinity matrix mono-HA11) was added to the supernatant and incubated for 60 min at 4 °C with gentle shaking. For coimmunoprecipitation experiments, beads were washed three times with homogenization buffer and then resuspended in 5× sample buffer without reducent. Samples were boiled and loaded onto SDS-PAGE. For in vitro kinase assay and SR uptake, beads were washed with homogenization buffer and added to the homogenized heart obtained from WT mice in kinase buffer (in mm, 25 imidazole, 10 MgCl2, 0.1 sodium vanadate, 20 NaF, and 0.05 ATP). Reaction mixtures were incubated for 25 min at 30 °C. Subsequently, beads were resuspended in 5× sample buffer without reducent for Western blot analysis or used to measure SR Ca2+ uptake, as described above. An in vitro Akt kinase assay was performed as follows: recombinant PLN was obtained as described previously (27Douglas J.L. Trieber C.A. Afara M. Young H.S. Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 40: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), whereas purified active Akt was purchased from Cell Signaling (Waltham, MA). The kinase assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, with or without active Akt; detection of total PLN and PLN phosphorylated at Ser16 or Thr17 was performed by Western blot analysis. PKA activity was measured using a cAMP assay kit (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis were performed on total cytosolic lysate and the SR fraction from WT, Tg, or KO mouse ventricles. The following antibodies were used: anti-total PLN and anti-phospho Thr17 PLN antibodies (Badrilla, Leeds, UK); anti-phospho-Ser16 PLN antibody (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA); anti-phospho-Ser473 Akt and anti-total Akt antibodies (Cell Signaling); anti-phospho-Thr287 CAMKIIδ antibody (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO); anti-total CAMKIIδ antibody (kindly provided by Dr. Harold Singer) (28Schworer C.M. Rothblum L.I. Thekkumkara T.J. Singer H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14443-14449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and anti-PDK1 antibody (Calbiochem). Three adenoviruses were produced. One (mock) was an infective virus with no transgene expression. The second (Ad Akt-E40K) contained the HA-tagged E40K Akt transgene used for production of our Tg mouse line. The third (Ad Akt-PLN) contained an active form of Akt linked to an SR localization sequence at the C terminus. Constitutive activity of the T308D/S473D Akt mutant, in which the aspartic acid residues mimic phosphorylation, has been described previously (1Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar, 29Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Ahmed N.N. Datta K. Malstrom S. Stokoe D. McCormick F. Feng J. Tsichlis P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). This mutant is biologically active and able to mediate some of the effects of Akt, including transformation of chicken embryo fibroblasts (30Aoki M. Batista O. Bellacosa A. Tsichlis P. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 14950-14955Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To serve as an SR localization signal, amino acids 23–52 of the transmembrane region of PLN were used. In addition, this PLN sequence contained mutations L31A and N34A to eliminate its ability to inhibit SERCA activity. This sequence was obtained from the αMHC-AIP4-SRL vector (kindly provided by Dr. J. R. Dedman, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH) (31Ji Y. Li B. Reed T.D. Lorenz J.N. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25063-25071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Ad Akt-PLN vector was obtained by homologous recombination following cotransformation of a 3′Akt-PLN fragment and Ad Akt-E40K vector into Escherichia coli Bj5183. Three PCR steps were used to amplify the 3′Akt-PLN fragment. First, 5′L-Akt-PLN (5′-GCGGATTCCCCGTGCCAAGAGTGAGATCTTCCGTTTATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACG-3′) and 3′L-Akt-PLN (5′-GATAAATAGGTTCTGGAGATTCTGACGTGCTTGGGCGAGGGCTGTGCCACTGGCTGAGTAGGAG-3′) as well as PLN_5_fw (5′-CACAGCCCTCGCCCAAGCACGTCAGAATCTCCAGAAC-3) and 3′l-PLN-NLS (5′-GATCCGTCGACTCTAGATTTAAATGTTTCGTCTAGATCACAGAAGCATCACAATGATGCAGATCAGCAG-3′) primers were used to amplify Akt and PLN sequences, respectively. Subsequently, because of an introduced overlapping sequence of obtained PCR products, the 3′Akt-PLN fusion fragment was obtained with a final PCR amplification. Finally, viral vectors were amplified and purified in 3% sucrose/PBS by ViraQuest, Inc. (North Liberty, IA). Isolated Ca2+-tolerant CMs were plated on laminin-coated slides and treated as follows: (i) infected with mock (empty vector) or recombinant adenoviral vectors at 100 multiplicity of infection for 1 h and then cultured in serum-free medium for an additional 48 h; (ii) incubated with insulin for 30 min. After the aforementioned treatments, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, rinsed in PBS, and permeabilized with blocking buffer for 20 min (0.1% Triton X-100, 1% normal donkey serum, 1% cold-water fish gelatin, and 20 mm glycine). Cells were then costained overnight at 4 °C with anti-PLN antibody (1:200) and either anti-Akt antibody (1:50) or anti-HA tag antibody (1:50) in diluted working buffer (blocking buffer diluted 10× with PBS). After extensive washing, cells were incubated with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies (anti-mouse rhodamine from Molecular Probes and anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate from Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C in the dark. Subsequently, cells were washed extensively with working buffer and mounted. Slides were stored at 4 °C until imaged using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 Confocal/2-Photon microscope with a ×60 Plan-apochromat 1.4 n.a. objective (Zeiss). Individual images (1024 × 1024) were converted to a tiff format and merged as pseudocolor RGB images using Imaris (Bitplane AG). Experiments were repeated at least twice to confirm the fluorescence patterns. 1-Day-old neonatal mouse CMs were plated in serum-free medium. 24 h after plating CMs were infected with mock, Ad Akt-E40K, or Ad Akt-PLN at a multiplicity of infection of 50. 48 h later, 2.5 μCi/ml [3H]leucine was added to the medium. The assay was terminated after 12 h by washing the cells three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ and Mg2+ and fixing in ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid. Thereafter, proteins were solubilized in 0.5 n NaOH, and radioactivity and protein content were measured. Group data are given as mean ± S.D. and compared using Student's t test or one-way ANOVA as indicated. Analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism version 4.0 for Mac (GraphPad Software, San Diego). We decided first to determine SERCA2a activity in Tg mice by analyzing the phosphorylation status of PLN at Ser16 and Thr17 by Western blotting. We found that in Tg heart extracts phosphorylation of PLN at Thr17 was increased when compared with WT, whereas phosphorylation at Ser16 was unchanged or even reduced (Fig. 1A). The partial reduction of PLN phosphorylation at Ser16 in Tg could be explained by a decrease in PKA activity that we found in these mice compared with WT, as evaluated by measurement of the level of cAMP (0.270 ± 0.025 versus 0.470 ± 0.015 pmol/mg protein, p < 0.05, respectively). Because phosphorylation at Thr17 is an indirect measurement of CAMKIIδ activity, we hypothesized that CAMKIIδ activity might be higher in the hearts of Tg than WT. To test this, cytosolic and SR extracts were probed with antibodies for total and active, Thr286-phosphorylated CAMKIIδ. Surprisingly, phosphorylation of CAMKIIδ at Thr286 was decreased in Tg compared with WT (Fig. 1B). This indicated that CAMKIIδ activity is reduced in Tg mice hearts and, consequently, plays a minor, if any, role in phosphorylation of PLN at Thr17 in this model. The consensus sequence of PLN for CAMKIIδ (RXXT) is similar to the canonical consensus site sequence for Akt phosphorylation (RXRXX(S/T)). We therefore speculated that the Thr17 residue of PLN could also be phosphorylated by Akt. To test this, we first analyzed KO mice harboring a cardiac specific deletion of PDK1, the upstream activator of Akt (11Catalucci D. Zhang D.H. DeSantiago J. Aimond F. Barbara G. Chemin J. Bonci D. Picht E. Rusconi F. Dalton N.D. Peterson K.L. Richard S. Bers D.M. Brown J.H. Condorelli G. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 923-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this model, all three isoforms of Akt are dephosphorylated. We found that phosphorylation at Thr17 was reduced in KO compared with WT, whereas there was no apparent change in phosphorylation at Ser16 (Fig. 2). Revealingly, CAMKIIδ activity, as assessed by the level of phosphorylation at Thr286, was comparable in KO and WT (Fig. 2). These results corroborated the hypothesis that Akt might be involved in PLN phosphorylation at Thr17. Direct phosphorylation of PLN by Akt implies that these two proteins colocalize and physically interact with each other at the SR. In fact, Western blotting with both anti-HA-tagged and anti-phospho-Akt antibodies revealed that Akt-E40K was indeed found at the SR in Tg (Fig. 3A). Importantly, Akt translocates to the SR also in a more physiological setting, i.e. treatment of WT CMs with insulin. In fact, confocal microscopy images of in vitro WT CMs stained for total Akt revealed a rather homogeneous and diffuse staining in untreated CMs but a striated pattern, which was superimposed to that for PLN, after insulin stimulation (Fig. 3B). Further evidence for direct interaction between Akt and PLN came from pulldown experiments in which Akt-E40K was immunoprecipitated from heart extracts with an anti-HA antibody and PLN probed for Western blotting with an anti-PLN antibody. We found that in Tg extracts, PLN coprecipitated with Akt-E40K (Fig. 3C). In addition, in an in vitro kinase assay in which recombinant full-length PLN was incubated with or without a commercially available active Akt, PLN became phosphorylated at Thr17 but not at Ser16 in the presence of active Akt (Fig. 3D). Moreover, stimulation of CMs with insulin in the presence of specific Akt or CAMKII inhibitors suggested that CAMKIIδ and Akt concur in phosphorylating PLN at Thr17 (Fig. 4). The effect of Akt on SR Ca2+ handling was assessed by an SR 45Ca2+ uptake ass"
https://openalex.org/W2094862108,"Background Antibiotic-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections have increased dramatically in the community, yet S. aureus nasal colonization has remained stable. The objectives of this study were to determine if S. aureus colonization is a useful proxy measure to study disease transmission and infection in community settings, and to identify potential community reservoirs. Methodology/Principal Findings Randomly selected households in Northern Manhattan, completed a structured social network questionnaire and provided nasal swabs that were typed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis to identify S. aureus colonizing strains. The main outcome measures were: 1) colonization with S. aureus; and 2) recent serious skin infection. Risk factor analyses were conducted at both the individual and the household levels; logistic regression models identified independent risks for household colonization and infection. Results 321 surveyed households contained 914 members. The S. aureus prevalence was 25% and MRSA was 0.4%. More than 40% of households were colonized. Recent antibiotic use was the only significant correlate for household colonization (p = .002). Seventy-eight (24%) households reported serious skin infection. In contrast with colonization, five of the six risk factors that increased the risk of skin infection in the household at the univariate level remained independently significant in multivariable analysis: international travel, sports participation, surgery, antibiotic use and towel sharing. S. aureus colonization was not significantly associated with serious skin infection in any analysis. Among multiperson households with more than one person colonized, 50% carried the same strain. Conclusions/Significance The lack of association between S. aureus nasal colonization and serious skin infection underscores the need to explore alternative venues or body sites that may be crucial to transmission. Moreover, the magnitude of colonization and infection within the household suggests that households are an underappreciated and substantial community reservoir."

On the other hand, prolyl hydroxylation has attracted attention after the discovery of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) prolyl-hydroxylase and its role in switching of HIF1α functions (12Jaakkola P.

Prolyl hydroxylation in other proteins has been energetically sought, but only a few such proteins have been identified (13Qi H.H. Ongusaha P.P. Myllyharju J. Cheng D. Pakkanen O. Shi Y. Lee S.W. Peng J. Nature. 2008; 455: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Only one study has reported prolyl hydroxylation of fibrinogen at the β chain (14Henschen A.H. Theodor I. Pirkle H.

Here, we report the detection of prolyl 4-hydroxylated α-fibrinogen by plasma proteome analysis, a protein modification that dynamically changes in plasma depending on the clinical status and is a candidate plasma biomarker. Seventy-seven plasma samples (38 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and 39 healthy controls) were obtained from the National Cancer Center Hospital (Tokyo, Japan) (Sets 1 and 2), and 9 plasma samples (5 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and 4 healthy controls) were obtained from the Tokyo Medical University Hospital (Tokyo, Japan) (Set 3) (15Honda K.

Ebihara, T. Kosuge, S. Hirohashi, M. W. Büchler, and T. Yamada, manuscript in preparation. Written informed consent was obtained from every subject. The study was reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of each institute. To 20 μl of a plasma sample, 900 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and 100 μl of Con A-agarose (Vector, Burlingame, CA) were added, and the sample was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. After extensive washing with phosphate-buffered saline, proteins bound to Con A were eluted by competition with 100 mm mannose. To 30 μl of the eluted sample, 10 μl of 5 m urea, 2.5 μl of 1 m NH4HCO3, and 3.3 μg of sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) were added. After digestion at 37 °C for 20 h, peptides were dried with a SpeedVac concentrator (Thermo Electron, Holbrook, NY) and then dissolved in 50 μl of 0.1% formic acid. LC-MS and data acquisition were performed as reported previously (7Ono M. Shitashige M. Honda K. Isobe T. Kuwabara H. Matsuzuki H. Hirohashi S. Yamada T. Mol.

Briefly, the peptide samples were separated with a linear gradient from 0 to 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 200 nl/min for 60 min using the splitless nano-flow HPLC systems (DiNa (KYA, Tokyo, Japan)) (16Shitashige M.

MS spectra were acquired every second in triplicate with nano-electrospray (nanoESI)-QTOF-MS (QTOF Ultima (Waters, Milford, MA)). MS peaks were detected, normalized, and quantified using the in-house 2DICAL software package, as described previously (7Ono M. Shitashige M. Honda K. Isobe T. Kuwabara H. Matsuzuki H. Hirohashi S.

To increase the accuracy of peak alignment across multiple LC-MS runs, we applied a greedy algorithm, which had been used for fast DNA sequence alignment, to supplement our previous method (8Negishi A.

MS and MS/MS data were acquired by preparative LC-MS runs with a tolerance of ±0.1 m/z and ± 0.5 min of RT using QTOF Ultima and linear ion trap (LTQ)-Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) mass spectrometers. The MS/MS data were analyzed with Mascot software (Matrix Sciences, London, UK) including oxidized histidine, oxidized methionine, and hydroxyproline as possible modifications. Chemical formulas were determined with Xcalibur software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with mass tolerance of 5 ppm. Primary cultured normal hepatic cells (hNHeps) were purchased from Takara Bio (Shiga, Japan). KIM-1 was kindly provided by Dr. Masamichi Kojiro (Kurume University, Kurume, Japan). Hep3B was obtained from the Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research, Tohoku University (Sendai, Japan). HLE was obtained from the Health Science Research Resources Bank (Osaka, Japan). SK-Hep-1, Jhh-7, Hep-G2, HuH-7, and HuH-6clone5 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Three siRNAs targeting each of the P4HA1, P4HA2, P4HA3, P4HB, EGNL1, EGNL2, and EGNL3 genes, as well as 2 control RNAs, were designed by Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Cells were transfected with the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) (17Huang L. Shitashige M. Satow R. Honda K. Ono M. Yun J. Tomida A. Tsuruo T. Hirohashi S. Yamada T.

Monoclonal antibodies were generated by a standard cell fusion technique. The reactivity and titer of antibodies to HyP-ESS as well as unmodified (ESS) peptides were assessed by an antibody capture assay (19Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) using OPD (orthophenylenediamine) as a substrate (supplemental Fig. S6A). Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Blots were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (GE Healthcare, Bucks, UK) and quantified as described previously (20Sato S. Idogawa M. Honda K. Fujii G. Kawashima H. Takekuma K.

After extensive washing, wells were incubating with the OPD solution for 10 min, and color absorbance at 490 nm was measured (supplemental Fig. S6D). Mann-Whitney U test was performed with the open-source statistical language R (version 2.7.0) (9Matsubara J. Ono M. Negishi A. Ueno H. Okusaka T. Furuse J. Furuta K. Sugiyama E. Saito Y. Kaniwa N.

We used concanavalin A (Con A) to concentrate plasma glycoproteins (21Ogata S. Muramatsu T. Kobata A. J. Biochem. 1975; 78: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). This “glycocapturing” procedure removed albumin and reduced the concentration of other abundant plasma proteins (22Zhang H. Yi E.C. Li X.J. Mallick P. Kelly-Spratt K.S. Masselon C.D. Camp 2nd, D.G.

Various aberrations of protein glycosylation accumulate in cancer (23Hakomori S. Adv. Cancer Res. 1989; 52: 257-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 24Ono M. Hakomori S. Glycoconj. J. 2004; 20: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Most tumor markers of pancreatic cancer used clinically, including CA19-9, DUPAN-2, and NCC-ST-439, are known to be carbohydrate antigens (23Hakomori S. Adv. Cancer Res. 1989; 52: 257-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar, 25Kumamoto K. Mitsuoka C. Izawa M. Kimura N. Otsubo N. Ishida H. Kiso M. Yamada T. Hirohashi S. Kannagi R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 514-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Each sample was anonymized, randomized, and measured in triplicate by 2DICAL. A total of 115,325 independent MS peaks were detected within mass ranges of 250–1600 m/z and an LC RT of 0–45 min (Fig. 1A). The correlation coefficient (CC) and coefficient of variance (CV) values for the triplicate data were over 0.95 and under 0.15, respectively, in most subjects. To increase statistical robustness, 77 samples were separated at random into two experimental sets (Set 1 (18 pancreatic cancer patients and 19 healthy controls) and Set 2 (20 pancreatic cancer patients and 20 healthy controls)), and the two sets were analyzed independently. We selected 10 peptide peaks showing a statistically significant difference between the cancer patients and controls (>2 fold difference, p < 0.0005 (Mann-Whitney U test), average peak intensity of >10 in either the cancer samples or the control samples) in both sets. We further selected 6 peaks of 412 m/z (RT 13.7 min), 546 m/z (8.3 min), 552 m/z (8.3 min), 827 m/z (8.3 min), 1141 m/z (29.0 min), and 1185 m/z (9.2 min) (supplemental Fig. S1 and Table S1) inspecting the 2DICAL reports with various two-dimensional views (Fig. 1B). The difference between cancer patients and controls was further validated in an independent set (Set 3, consisting of 5 pancreatic cancer patients and 4 healthy controls) obtained from another medical institution (Tokyo Medical University Hospital) (supplemental Fig. S2). Target MS/MS data were acquired from preparative LC-MS. The MS/MS spectra of the peaks of 552 m/z and 827 m/z matched the same ESSSHHP*GIAEFPSR sequence of fibrinogen α-polypeptide isoform α-E preproprotein (NP_000499/NP_068657) with the highest Mascot scores (supplemental Fig. S3 and not shown; * indicates a mismatch (described below)). These peaks were considered to be differently charged masses (triply and doubly charged, respectively) derived from the same peptide. The triple-charged 546 m/z peak is considered to be a mass with neutral loss of H2O, because its appearance was almost identical to the peaks of 552 and 827 m/z. The peak of 1141 m/z matched another peptide sequence of fibrinogen α-polypeptide isoform α-E preproprotein TFP*GFFSPMLGEFVSETESR with the highest Mascot score (supplemental Fig. S4). No significant match was found with the 412 m/z peak despite its highly qualified MS/MS spectrum (data not shown), probably because of an unknown post-translational modification, a non-annotated gene sequence (26States D.J. Omenn G.S. Blackwell T.W. Fermin D. Eng J. Speicher D.W. Hanash S.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2006; 24: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), or proteolysis. Qualified MS/MS spectra were not obtained from the peak of 1185 m/z. We noticed 16-dalton smaller MS peaks at different locations (547 m/z (8.5 min), 819 m/z (8.6 min), and 1133 m/z (30.0 min)) that completely matched the same amino acid sequences of fibrinogen α-polypeptide as the peaks of 552 m/z (8.3 min), 827 m/z (8.3 min), and 1141 m/z (29.0 min), respectively (Fig. 2 and data not shown). However, the intensity of the three 16-dalton-smaller MS peaks did not differ significantly between pancreatic cancer patients and controls (Fig. 2B). To clarify the nature of the 16-dalton increase, the peptides of 827 and 819 m/z as well as 1141 and 1133 m/z were analyzed with a high resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometer. The difference between both the larger and the smaller pairs was 15.995 dalton, considered to be derived exclusively from the addition of one oxygen atom (Fig. 3, A and B). MS/MS revealed that the addition took place on the proline 565 and 530 residues (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. S5A). A 155.0808 m/z fragment observed in the high resolution MS/MS spectrum of the 819 m/z peak and a 171.0762 m/z fragment observed in the spectrum of the 827 m/z peak led to the exclusive identification of their chemical formulas as C7H11O2N2 and C7H11O3N2, respectively (Fig. 3D). Formulas C7H11O3N2 and C7H11O2N2 match hydroxyproline-glycine and unmodified proline-glycine, respectively.FIGURE 3Determination of the 16-dalton increase by high resolution MS.

GANP mice can produce highly diverse antibodies and have been used with success to generate high affinity antibodies to various difficult antigens (18Sakaguchi N. Kimura T. Matsushita S. Fujimura S. Shibata J. Araki M. Sakamoto T. Minoda C. Kuwahara K. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 4485-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We were unable to produce a monoclonal antibody with specificity for TFP(O)GFFSPMLGEFVSETESR (data not shown). Fibrinogen α-polypeptide is produced and secreted mainly by the liver. α-Fibrinogen with hydroxylation of its proline 565 residue (hereafter, αFG-565HyP) as well as 3 polypeptides (the α-, β-, and γ-chains) of fibrinogen were detected in the lysates (Fig. 4A) and supernatants (data not shown) of cultured hepatic cells and several hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines by immunoblotting with 11A5 monoclonal antibody. The 4-hydroxylation of proline is catalyzed by two types of enzymes: collagen-type and HIF1-type prolyl 4-hydroxylases (12Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M. Wilson M.I. Gielbert J. Gaskell S.J.

There are 4 collagen-type (P4HA1, P4HA2, P4HA3, and P4HB) and 3 HIF1-type (EGNL1, EGNL2, and EGNL3) prolyl 4-hydroxylase genes annotated in the human genome, but only knockdown of P4HA1 by siRNA inhibited the production of αFG-565HyP by KIM-1 cells (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. S7A), indicating the involvement of P4HA1 (EC 1.14.11.2) in the 4-hydroxylation of the proline 565 residue of α-fibrinogen, at least in this cell line. The plasma level of αFG-565HyP was increased in pancreatic cancer patients, but the levels of α-, β-, and γ-fibrinogen did not show any differences between pancreatic cancer patients and healthy controls (Fig. 4C). The levels of αFG-565HyP and α-fibrinogen were not significantly correlated (CC = 0.22) (supplemental Fig. S6, B and C). There was a significant correlation (CC = 0.81) between the intensity of the 827 m/z peak detected by 2DICAL and the level of αFG-565HyP determined by immunoblotting with 11A5 antibody (supplemental Fig. S7B), indicating the quantitative accuracy of 2DICAL. A competitive ELISA utilizing anti-HyP-ESS (11A5) monoclonal antibody was constructed (supplemental Fig. S6D), and the plasma level of αFG-565HyP was quantified in 685 individuals (Set 4) (Fig. 5). The plasma samples were collected prospectively from 7 medical institutions to ensure the absence of bias during the process of sample preparation. The ELISA assay showed high reproducibility with a median CV value of 0.079 among triplicates. There was a significant difference (p = 3.80 × 10−15, Mann-Whitney U test) in the plasma level of αFG-565HyP between 160 pancreatic cancer patients (2.26 ± 2.28 arbitrary units) and 113 healthy controls (0.91 ± 1.24) (Fig. 5A). The plasma level of αFG-565HyP was not elevated in patients with Stage IA (UICC, International Union Against Cancer) pancreatic cancer (p = 0.811), but patients with Stage IB or more advanced disease showed a significant increase of plasma αFG-565HyP (p = 2.99 × 10−2 to 1.88 × 10−12) (Fig. 5B and supplemental Table S2). An elevated plasma level of αFG-565HyP was also observed in various cancers and chronic inflammatory disease. Patients with cancers of other organs (including the bile duct (p = 4.24 × 10−5), liver (p = 1.08 × 10−3), esophagus (p = 2.07 × 10−4), stomach (p = 5.95 × 10−4), and colon/rectum (p = 9.29 × 10−6)) as well as patients with chronic pancreatitis (p = 3.89 × 10−2) showed a significant increase in plasma αFG-565HyP (Fig. 5C and supplemental Table S3). Patients with benign pancreatic tumor/cyst (p = 0.216) or cholecystitis (p = 0.111) showed no significant difference from the controls. Plasma proteomics by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has been a challenge because of the complexity and individual diversity of human samples. We developed a simple but robust method that enables the quantitative comparison of multiple LC-MS data. In this study, we identified 6 MS peaks whose intensity was significantly different between 38 cancer patients and 39 healthy controls (Figs. 1 and 2 and supplemental Figs. S1 and S2) among a total of 115,325 peaks derived from Con A-binding plasma glycoproteins. High resolution MS/MS analysis revealed that 4 of 6 peaks were derived from prolyl 4-hydroxylated plasma α-fibrinogen (Fig. 3). Artificial oxidation of peptides/proteins frequently occurs during the preparative procedures for MS analysis, especially during separation by SDS-PAGE. However, the plasma samples from cancer patients and healthy controls used in this study were collected, stored, and processed in an identical manner and were not separated by SDS-PAGE. We deliberately validated the native hydroxylation of the proline residue of plasma α-fibrinogen by immunoblotting and ELISA with a modification-specific monoclonal antibody (Figs. 4 and 5). Prolyl hydroxylation is essential for the folding, secretion, and stability of the collagen triple helix (28Myllyharju J.

Collagen has long been considered to be the only protein that is hydroxylated on its proline residues, but recently the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene product-mediated degradation of HIF1α was revealed to be regulated by prolyl hydroxylation (12Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M. Wilson M.I. Gielbert J. Gaskell S.J. Kriegsheim Av. Hebestreit H.F. Mukherji M. Schofield C.J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J.

However, it is largely unknown which other proteins are prolyl-hydroxylated and how the modification regulates the function of proteins. We found that the collagen-type prolyl 4-hydroxylase P4HA1 is essential for the production of αFG-565HyP (Fig. 4B). Consistently, the consensus Xaa-Pro-Gly sequence of collagen (13Qi H.H.

Prolyl-hydroxylated α-fibrinogen was produced in cultured hepatic cells and several hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines but not in pancreatic cancer cell lines (data not shown). Immunohistochemical study using antibody 11A5 showed that prolyl-hydroxylated α-fibrinogen existed at the inflammation site around the pancreatic cancer cells (data not shown). The modification change in plasma level may be determined by the production and consumption balance in the human body. Hydroxylation at proline 530 of α-fibrinogen was strongly correlated with αFG-565HyP (supplementary Fig. S7C). Multiple biological mechanisms may be involved in the regulation of prolyl-hydroxylated α-fibrinogen. Post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, phosphorylation, and oxidation, cause small differences in the molecular weight of proteins. Prolyl-hydroxylated peptides are 16 daltons larger than their unmodified counterparts, but this small change in molecular weight can readily be detected by 2DICAL as differences in the m/z values as well as the RT of the peptide peaks. The peaks derived from unmodified plasma fibrinogen fragments appeared in different locations (compare Fig. 2, A and B). Such modifications may be overlooked by MS/MS-based identification-oriented proteome approaches (31Gao J. Opiteck G.J. Friedrichs M.S. Dongre A.R. Hefta S.A. J. Proteome.

Microtubule dynamics are essential in many cellular processes, including cell motility, intracellular transport, accurate mitosis, and cytokinesis in all eukaryotes. The regulatory factors for microtubule dynamics can be classified into two main types as follows: microtubule-destabilizing proteins, such as stathmin/Op18 (1Steinmetz M.O. J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 158: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and the Kinesin-13 family (also known as MCAK/KIF2 family) (2Howard J. Hyman A.A. Curr. Opin.

Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2007; 64: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 5Akhmanova A. Steinmetz M.O. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar).The EB1 family is a member of the +TIPs family and consists of three homologs in mammals: EB1, EB2/RP1 (henceforth, EB2), and EB3 (6Juwana J.P. Henderikx P. Mischo A. Wadle A. Fadle N. Gerlach K. Arends J.W. Hoogenboom H. Pfreundschuh M. Renner C. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As EB1 was originally identified as a protein that interacts with the well characterized tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein (7Su L.K. Burrell M. Hill D.E. Gyuris J. Brent R. Wiltshire R. Trent J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2972-2977PubMed Google Scholar), the function of EB1 has been investigated extensively. EB1 interacts with other +TIPs, including APC, p150glued, CLIPs, and CLASP1/2, and the interaction network controls microtubule orientation and microtubule-cortex interaction during cell migration (5Akhmanova A. Steinmetz M.O. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 8Vaughan K.T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 9Lansbergen G. Akhmanova A. Traffic. 2006; 7: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). EB1 functions not only in the regulation of interphase microtubule dynamics but also in mitotic spindle regulation. For accurate chromosomal segregation, sister chromatids become aligned to the metaphase plate during metaphase, and the alignment requires spindle-kinetochore attachment. Two models have been proposed; in the first, termed the “search-and-capture” model, EB1 localized at the growing microtubule plus-ends searches for binding partners located on kinetochores (10Rogers S.L. Rogers G.C. Sharp D.J. Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 873-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 11Tirnauer J.S. Grego S. Salmon E.D. Mitchison T.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3614-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In the second model proposed recently, EB1 makes kinetochore fibers and centrosomal microtubules connect, and it is essential for the formation of a functional bipolar spindle (12Goshima G. Nédélec F. Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Thus, EB1 is thought to be a master controller of microtubule plus-ends; however, little is known about other EB1 family members. Given that EB3 is localized on the microtubule network and binds to APC and CLIPs identically to EB1, it is possible that EB3 acts as an EB1 analog in cells (13Nakagawa H. Koyama K. Murata Y. Morito M. Akiyama T. Nakamura Y. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 14Bu W. Su L.K.

Cell. 2005; 16: 5334-5345Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).Cell division is precisely regulated by several post-translational modifications of proteins, mainly reversible phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which is followed by degradation. Accurate mitotic phase progression requires the appropriate phosphorylation of various proteins by mitotic kinases (16Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar, 17Ferrari S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 781-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). One of the key mitotic kinases is the Aurora family that has been highly conserved from yeast to humans. There are three homologs (Aurora-A, -B, and -C) in human and mouse (18Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 842-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). Although their homology at the protein level is more than 84%, their functions and subcellular localizations are distinct. Aurora-A is located in the centrosomes and spindle and is required for mitotic entry, centrosome maturation/separation, and spindle assembly (19Marumoto T. Zhang D. Saya H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Aurora-B is a chromosomal passenger protein that localizes on the inner centromere of the chromosomes until metaphase to regulate the spindle-kinetochore attachment, and from anaphase, it translocates to the central spindle and then accumulates in the midbody for cytokinesis (20Andrews P.D. Knatko E. Moore W.J. Swedlow J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 672-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 21Ruchaud S. Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 798-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). The numerous substrates of the Aurora family include regulatory factors for microtubule dynamics, such as the microtubule-destabilizing proteins MCAK and stathmin, which help to establish the bipolar attachment and spindle assembly, respectively (22Moore A. Wordeman L. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 537-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 23Kinoshita K. Noetzel T.L. Arnal I. Drechsel D.N. Hyman A.A. J. Muscle Res.

It is possible that the Aurora family regulates the EB1 family by phosphorylation.In this study, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening and obtained the EB1 yeast homolog Bim1 as a protein that interacts with Ipl1, a yeast counterpart of Aurora. Here we demonstrate the novel regulatory mechanisms of EB3 by two cell cycle-dependent post-translational modifications, phosphorylation and ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation.DISCUSSIONHere, we report that the E3 SIAH-1 interacts with EB3 and mediates EB3 polyubiquitination and degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. During mitosis two kinases, Aurora-A and Aurora-B, phosphorylate EB3 at Ser-176, and the resulting phosphorylation disrupts the EB3-SIAH-1 complex. Indeed, EB3 is stabilized during mitosis and facilitates cell cycle progression. Our results on the mitotic regulation of EB3 are summarized in Fig. 7C.Recent publications provide a molecular basis of the recognition/specificity as the hydrophobic interaction between SIAH-1 and its substrates (45House C.M.

Chem. 2005; 280: 34278-34287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Our structure-based modeling reveals that the peptide derived from EB3 forms hydrophobic interactions with SIAH-1 mainly through Val-178 and Pro-180 and that the peptide binding groove is lined by Phe-165 and Trp-178 (supplemental Fig. 8). Ser-176 of EB3 lies close to Met-180 of SIAH-1; its γ-hydroxyl oxygen is located less than 4.0 Å from the sulfur atom. A phosphate group on the Ser residue would clearly prevent a close approach of the peptide to the apolar groove on SIAH-1. Given that most, if not all, SIAH-binding proteins contain phosphorylatable residues within the consensus motif (supplemental Fig. 9) and that conversely the SIAH-1 protein itself is subjected to regulatory phosphorylation (48Winter M.

As the mitotic up-regulation of endogenous SIAH-1 expression (51Frew I.J. Dickins R.A. Cuddihy A.R. Del Rosario M. Reinhard C. O'Connell M.J. Bowtell D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8155-8164Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and SIAH-1 as an established p53 target gene (52Fiucci G. Beaucourt S. Duflaut D. Lespagnol A. Stumptner-Cuvelette P. Géant A.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2736-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) have been previously reported, mitotic and/or unscheduled degradation of EB3 most likely is prevented by the post-translational modification. Two major E3s, APC/C and SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box protein complex), have a role in cell cycle control (54Morgan D.O. The Cell Cycle: Principles of Control.in: Lawrence E. New Science Press Ltd, London2007: 46-49Google Scholar). SIAH-1 may be a third E3 in switch-like cellular events such as cell cycle transitions.EB1 degradation is ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent and regulated by the COP9 signalsome (55Peth A. Boettcher J.P. Dubiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 550-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our findings demonstrate that in contrast to EB3, EB1 and EB2 protein levels are not regulated during the cell cycle, and these two proteins are not substrates for SIAH-1 (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. 4B). As reported previously (56Sun L. Gao J. Dong X. Liu M. Li D. Shi X. Dong J.T. Lu X. Liu C. Zhou J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 7153-7158Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), EB1 is not a substrate of two mitotic kinases, Aurora-A and Aurora-B (Fig. 1C and data not shown). As EB1 family proteins are involved in microtubule dynamics in concert with their binding partners +TIPs, such as APC (57Akhmanova A. Hoogenraad C.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), and SIAH-1 also binds to APC, EB3 might regulate microtubule dynamics and organization, especially during mitosis, coordinating with other functionally redundant EB1 family members.In our EB3 siRNA experiments, we only observe a 2-fold but significant increase in their mitotic index but no further observable phenotype. EB3 can interact to known EB1 partners, such as APC (13Nakagawa H. Koyama K. Murata Y. Morito M. Akiyama T. Nakamura Y. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). EB3 and EB1 can form heterodimers in cells. In HeLa cells EB1 appears to be expressed at higher levels than EB3 (data not shown), in line with the recently published data (58Komarova Y. De Groot C.O. Grigoriev I. Gouveia S.M. Munteanu E.L. Schober J.M. Honnappa S. Buey R.M. Hoogenraad C.C. Dogterom M. Borisy G.G. Steinmetz M.O. Akhmanova A. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 691-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Thus, EB1 may compensate for the lack of EB3. This probably explains why the single depletion of EB3 has little effect on mitosis in these cells, although in the knockdown of EB1 or of both EB1 and EB3, inhibition of EB1 alone could compromise the spindle checkpoint function without arresting cells in mitosis.The question of why EB3 needs to be protected from its degradation during mitosis is an important one. The simplest explanation is that EB3 may be needed for microtubule dynamics and organization in mitosis, depending on tissue specificity or EB1 expression level. Alternatively, it is possible that the regulated destruction of EB3 is required during mitotic exit. The EB3 class harboring both Aurora phosphorylation sites and a potential SIAH-1-binding motif is found only in mammals. EB3 has initially been described to be mostly expressed in brain and muscles (13Nakagawa H. Koyama K. Murata Y. Morito M. Akiyama T. Nakamura Y. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). More recently roles have been attributed to EB3 during myotube differentiation with an EB3 protein up-regulation (59Straube A. Merdes A. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 1318-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and for the regulation of neuritogenesis (60Geraldo S. Khanzada U.K. Parsons M. Chilton J.K. Gordon-Weeks P.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In addition SIAH-1 has also been shown to ubiquitinate α-synuclein and synphilin-1 involved in Parkinson disease (61Engelender S. Autophagy. 2008; 4: 372-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of the regulation of EB3 by SIAH-1 and Aurora kinases might exist in noncycling cells. Future studies are necessary to clarify the detailed cell type- and tissue-specific regulation.Recently, EB1 was reported to be an Aurora-B-interacting activator that prevents Aurora-B from dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 2A (56Sun L. Gao J. Dong X. Liu M. Li D. Shi X. Dong J.T. Lu X. Liu C. Zhou J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 7153-7158Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that EB1 family proteins interact with not only Aurora-B but also with Aurora-A. Additionally, EB1 family proteins cannot activate Aurora-B to prevent its dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 2A in our hands (supplemental Fig. 10). Given that microtubules directly stimulate Aurora-B kinase activity in vitro (62Fuller B.G. Lampson M.A. Foley E.A. Rosasco-Nitcher S. Le K.V. Tobelmann P. Brautigan D.L. Stukenberg P.T. Kapoor T.M. Nature. 2008; 453: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 63Rosasco-Nitcher S.E. Lan W. Khorasanizadeh S. Stukenberg P.T. Science. 2008; 319: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), this mechanism needs further investigation.In summary, we report on two mitotic kinases, Aurora-A and Aurora-B, that regulate the EB3-SIAH-1 interaction through site-specific phosphorylation of EB3 to protect EB3 from SIAH-1-mediated degradation during mitosis. Microtubule dynamics are essential in many cellular processes, including cell motility, intracellular transport, accurate mitosis, and cytokinesis in all eukaryotes. The regulatory factors for microtubule dynamics can be classified into two main types as follows: microtubule-destabilizing proteins, such as stathmin/Op18 (1Steinmetz M.O. J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 158: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and the Kinesin-13 family (also known as MCAK/KIF2 family) (2Howard J. Hyman A.A. Curr. Opin.

Cell. 2005; 16: 5334-5345Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Cell division is precisely regulated by several post-translational modifications of proteins, mainly reversible phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which is followed by degradation. Accurate mitotic phase progression requires the appropriate phosphorylation of various proteins by mitotic kinases (16Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar, 17Ferrari S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 781-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). One of the key mitotic kinases is the Aurora family that has been highly conserved from yeast to humans. There are three homologs (Aurora-A, -B, and -C) in human and mouse (18Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 842-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). Although their homology at the protein level is more than 84%, their functions and subcellular localizations are distinct. Aurora-A is located in the centrosomes and spindle and is required for mitotic entry, centrosome maturation/separation, and spindle assembly (19Marumoto T. Zhang D. Saya H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Aurora-B is a chromosomal passenger protein that localizes on the inner centromere of the chromosomes until metaphase to regulate the spindle-kinetochore attachment, and from anaphase, it translocates to the central spindle and then accumulates in the midbody for cytokinesis (20Andrews P.D. Knatko E. Moore W.J. Swedlow J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 672-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 21Ruchaud S. Carmena M. Earnshaw W.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 798-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). The numerous substrates of the Aurora family include regulatory factors for microtubule dynamics, such as the microtubule-destabilizing proteins MCAK and stathmin, which help to establish the bipolar attachment and spindle assembly, respectively (22Moore A. Wordeman L. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 537-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 23Kinoshita K. Noetzel T.L. Arnal I. Drechsel D.N. Hyman A.A. J. Muscle Res.

It is possible that the Aurora family regulates the EB1 family by phosphorylation. In this study, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening and obtained the EB1 yeast homolog Bim1 as a protein that interacts with Ipl1, a yeast counterpart of Aurora. Here we demonstrate the novel regulatory mechanisms of EB3 by two cell cycle-dependent post-translational modifications, phosphorylation and ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation. DISCUSSIONHere, we report that the E3 SIAH-1 interacts with EB3 and mediates EB3 polyubiquitination and degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. During mitosis two kinases, Aurora-A and Aurora-B, phosphorylate EB3 at Ser-176, and the resulting phosphorylation disrupts the EB3-SIAH-1 complex. Indeed, EB3 is stabilized during mitosis and facilitates cell cycle progression. Our results on the mitotic regulation of EB3 are summarized in Fig. 7C.Recent publications provide a molecular basis of the recognition/specificity as the hydrophobic interaction between SIAH-1 and its substrates (45House C.M.

Chem. 2005; 280: 34278-34287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Our structure-based modeling reveals that the peptide derived from EB3 forms hydrophobic interactions with SIAH-1 mainly through Val-178 and Pro-180 and that the peptide binding groove is lined by Phe-165 and Trp-178 (supplemental Fig. 8). Ser-176 of EB3 lies close to Met-180 of SIAH-1; its γ-hydroxyl oxygen is located less than 4.0 Å from the sulfur atom. A phosphate group on the Ser residue would clearly prevent a close approach of the peptide to the apolar groove on SIAH-1. Given that most, if not all, SIAH-binding proteins contain phosphorylatable residues within the consensus motif (supplemental Fig. 9) and that conversely the SIAH-1 protein itself is subjected to regulatory phosphorylation (48Winter M.

As the mitotic up-regulation of endogenous SIAH-1 expression (51Frew I.J. Dickins R.A. Cuddihy A.R. Del Rosario M. Reinhard C. O'Connell M.J. Bowtell D.D. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2736-2747Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) have been previously reported, mitotic and/or unscheduled degradation of EB3 most likely is prevented by the post-translational modification. Two major E3s, APC/C and SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F-box protein complex), have a role in cell cycle control (54Morgan D.O. The Cell Cycle: Principles of Control.in: Lawrence E. New Science Press Ltd, London2007: 46-49Google Scholar). SIAH-1 may be a third E3 in switch-like cellular events such as cell cycle transitions.EB1 degradation is ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent and regulated by the COP9 signalsome (55Peth A. Boettcher J.P. Dubiel W. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 550-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our findings demonstrate that in contrast to EB3, EB1 and EB2 protein levels are not regulated during the cell cycle, and these two proteins are not substrates for SIAH-1 (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. 4B). As reported previously (56Sun L. Gao J. Dong X. Liu M. Li D. Shi X. Dong J.T. Lu X. Liu C. Zhou J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 7153-7158Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), EB1 is not a substrate of two mitotic kinases, Aurora-A and Aurora-B (Fig. 1C and data not shown). As EB1 family proteins are involved in microtubule dynamics in concert with their binding partners +TIPs, such as APC (57Akhmanova A. Hoogenraad C.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), and SIAH-1 also binds to APC, EB3 might regulate microtubule dynamics and organization, especially during mitosis, coordinating with other functionally redundant EB1 family members.In our EB3 siRNA experiments, we only observe a 2-fold but significant increase in their mitotic index but no further observable phenotype. EB3 can interact to known EB1 partners, such as APC (13Nakagawa H. Koyama K. Murata Y. Morito M. Akiyama T. Nakamura Y. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). EB3 and EB1 can form heterodimers in cells. In HeLa cells EB1 appears to be expressed at higher levels than EB3 (data not shown), in line with the recently published data (58Komarova Y. De Groot C.O. Grigoriev I. Gouveia S.M. Munteanu E.L. Schober J.M. Honnappa S. Buey R.M. Hoogenraad C.C. Dogterom M. Borisy G.G. Steinmetz M.O. Akhmanova A. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 691-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Thus, EB1 may compensate for the lack of EB3. This probably explains why the single depletion of EB3 has little effect on mitosis in these cells, although in the knockdown of EB1 or of both EB1 and EB3, inhibition of EB1 alone could compromise the spindle checkpoint function without arresting cells in mitosis.The question of why EB3 needs to be protected from its degradation during mitosis is an important one. The simplest explanation is that EB3 may be needed for microtubule dynamics and organization in mitosis, depending on tissue specificity or EB1 expression level. Alternatively, it is possible that the regulated destruction of EB3 is required during mitotic exit. The EB3 class harboring both Aurora phosphorylation sites and a potential SIAH-1-binding motif is found only in mammals. EB3 has initially been described to be mostly expressed in brain and muscles (13Nakagawa H. Koyama K. Murata Y. Morito M. Akiyama T. Nakamura Y. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). More recently roles have been attributed to EB3 during myotube differentiation with an EB3 protein up-regulation (59Straube A. Merdes A. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 1318-1325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and for the regulation of neuritogenesis (60Geraldo S. Khanzada U.K. Parsons M. Chilton J.K. Gordon-Weeks P.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In addition SIAH-1 has also been shown to ubiquitinate α-synuclein and synphilin-1 involved in Parkinson disease (61Engelender S. Autophagy. 2008; 4: 372-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The physiological relevance of the regulation of EB3 by SIAH-1 and Aurora kinases might exist in noncycling cells. Future studies are necessary to clarify the detailed cell type- and tissue-specific regulation.Recently, EB1 was reported to be an Aurora-B-interacting activator that prevents Aurora-B from dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 2A (56Sun L. Gao J. Dong X. Liu M. Li D. Shi X. Dong J.T. Lu X. Liu C. Zhou J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 7153-7158Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that EB1 family proteins interact with not only Aurora-B but also with Aurora-A. Additionally, EB1 family proteins cannot activate Aurora-B to prevent its dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 2A in our hands (supplemental Fig. 10). Given that microtubules directly stimulate Aurora-B kinase activity in vitro (62Fuller B.G. Lampson M.A. Foley E.A. Rosasco-Nitcher S. Le K.V. Tobelmann P. Brautigan D.L. Stukenberg P.T. Kapoor T.M.

Science. 2008; 319: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), this mechanism needs further investigation.In summary, we report on two mitotic kinases, Aurora-A and Aurora-B, that regulate the EB3-SIAH-1 interaction through site-specific phosphorylation of EB3 to protect EB3 from SIAH-1-mediated degradation during mitosis. Here, we report that the E3 SIAH-1 interacts with EB3 and mediates EB3 polyubiquitination and degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system.

Recent studies show that LH3 is located not only in the endoplasmic reticulum but also in the extracellular space, and that the GGT activity in serum originates from LH3 (23Salo A.M. Wang C.

Recently, mutations in the human LH3 gene (PLOD3) were shown to cause a severe connective tissue disorder with features that overlap with a number of collagen disorders (27Salo A.M. Cox H. Farndon P.

The presence of LH3 in the intra- and extracellular space and the drastic consequences to the basement membrane when this enzyme is absent during early development suggest that LH3 plays an important role in the deposition of the ECM. To examine this role of LH3 in more detail, we have investigated the affects of the partial loss of LH3 on cells and tissues. We have examined heterozygous LH3 knock-out mice and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF+/−) at the ultrastructural level as well as cells from a human model of LH3 deficiency, an epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) family member known to exhibit a decrease in GGT activity. The decrease in GGT activity in a Finnish family with dominant EBS, accompanied by a markedly decreased urinary excretion of glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine, was reported earlier (28Savolainen E.R. Kero M. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. N. Engl. J. Med. 1981; 304: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Among the families tested, this was the only family with a deficiency of GGT activity, indicating that this feature is unique to this family and does not represent a typical finding in EBS patients (28Savolainen E.R. Kero M. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. N. Engl. J. Med. 1981; 304: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, Savolainen and co-workers (28Savolainen E.R. Kero M. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. N. Engl. J. Med. 1981; 304: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) reported that the decrease in GGT activity correlated with the severity of the disease. We have re-examined a patient of the EBS family and determined that the decrease in GGT activity is due to a transcriptional defect in one LH3 allele. Our results indicate that even a moderate decrease in the amount of intracellular LH3 results in a substantial decrease in LH3 secretion and causes changes in the deposition and organization of the ECM as well as the cytoskeletal arrangement of the cell. This was seen in tissues and cells of heterozygous LH3 knock-out mice, as well as in the EBS patient cells, both representing conditions where only one allele produces LH3. The results reveal an important role of LH3 in the organization of ECM. A fibroblast culture was established from a skin biopsy specimen taken from one patient belonging to the Finnish EBS family detailed elsewhere (28Savolainen E.R. Kero M. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. N. Engl. J. Med. 1981; 304: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The patient marked 10 in the pedigree was re-examined in this study. One control culture was kindly provided by Dr. Kaisa Tasanen-Määttä and two others have been locally established. All samples were obtained after informed consent, according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Heterozygous LH3 knock-out crosses were used to derive mouse embryonic fibroblasts as described earlier (26Sipilä L. Ruotsalainen H. Sormunen R. Baker N.L. Lamandé S.R. Vapola M. Wang C. Sado Y.

All cells were maintained at 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Glutamax (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Promocell), penicillin/streptomycin, and 50 μg/ml of ascorbic acid. The production of the heterozygous LH3 knock-out mice has been previously described (25Ruotsalainen H. Sipilä L. Vapola M. Sormunen R. Salo A.M. Uitto L. Mercer D.K. Robins S.P. Risteli M. Aszodi A.

For transmission electron microscopy, skin and muscle samples from newborn and adult mice were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde, 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in acetone, and embedded in Epon LX 112 (Ladd Research Industries, Williston, VT). Thin sections were cut with a Leica Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome and examined in a Philips CM100 transmission electron microscope. The diameters of 200–250 collagen fibrils were measured from thin sections of the skin of three newborn and adult heterozygous LH3 knock-out and wild-type mice using ITEM Soft Imaging Solutions (Olympus). Statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test. For immunoelectron microscopy, cells on confluent 58-cm2 dishes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in a 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.3), embedded into gelatin, and immersed in 2.3 m sucrose. Thin cryosections were incubated with a polyclonal LH3 antibody (PLOD3 antibody, ProteinTech Group, Inc.) and then with a protein A-gold complex. The sections were examined as above. Cells on a confluent 58-cm2 dish were homogenized as described earlier (4Valtavaara M. Papponen H. Pirttilä A.M. Hiltunen K. Helander H. Myllylä R. J. Biol.

Culture medium collected after 72 h was concentrated to about 250 μl using an Amicon Ultra 10k centrifugal filter device (Millipore). The samples were used in the GGT activity assay based on the transfer of a tritium-labeled sugar from UDP-glucose (139 Ci/mol) to galactosyl hydroxylysyl residues in a calf skin gelatin substrate (29Kivirikko K.I.

Total RNA was isolated from cultured skin fibroblasts with a TRIzol plus RNA purification kit (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized from total RNA with a cloned avian myeloblastosis virus first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) in random hexamer or oligo(dT)20-primed reactions. The expression level of human LH3 was detected using a TaqMan gene expression assay (Hs00153670_m1, PLOD3) (Applied Biosystems) and TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) with a 7500 real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) by the relative standard curve method. A eukaryotic 18 S rRNA endogenous control (Applied Biosystems) was used to normalize the quantities of LH3 expression. Genomic DNA was isolated from cultured skin fibroblasts using proteinase K and phenol extraction (31Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed.

PCR amplification of the LH3 promoter sequence was performed with promoter and exon 1-specific oligonucleotides covering 1043 nucleotides upstream from the translation start site (32Rautavuoma K. Passoja K. Helaakoski T. Kivirikko K.I. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) (AF207069), and the cDNA was amplified with LH3-specific oligonucleotides covering the entire coding region and 303 nucleotides of the 5′- and 259 nucleotides of the 3′-untranslated regions (5Valtavaara M.

The overlapping PCR fragments were directly sequenced using the DYEnamic ET terminator cycle sequencing premix kit (GE Healthcare) and an ABI Prism 377 sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. 95% Ethanol, 5% acetic acid was used for tubulin and vimentin analyses. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% saponin in phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated with monoclonal anti-vimentin (Affinity BioReagents), anti-vimentin (Sigma), or monoclonal anti-α-tubulin (Sigma) primary antibodies diluted in blocking solution. In the collagen and fibronectin experiments, the cells were incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-collagen type I (Rockland), polyclonal rabbit anti-collagen type VI (Rockland), and anti-human fibronectin (Sigma) in the absence of saponin, and nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma). Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, anti-mouse IgG, or anti-goat IgG (Invitrogen) antibodies were used for secondary detection. For actin microfilament staining, the cells were permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 and incubated with Alexa Fluor 568 phalloidin (Invitrogen). The cells were embedded with Immu-Mount (Thermo Shandon) and examined using an Olympus epifluorescence microscope or an Olympus Fluoview 1000 confocal microscope. LH3 was partially purified using UDP-hexanolamine-agarose (Sigma) as described earlier (23Salo A.M. Wang C. Sipilä L. Sormunen R. Vapola M. Kervinen P. Ruotsalainen H. Heikkinen J. Myllylä R. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 207: 644-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of soluble protein from confluent 58-cm2 dishes and equal volumes of the 72-h culture media were analyzed on immunoblots using a mouse LH3 antibody (23Salo A.M. Wang C. Sipilä L.

For collagen analysis, cells on the confluent 58-cm2 dish were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into homogenization buffer (0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 m glycine, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 μm dithiothreitol, 10 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5) and lysed by brief sonication. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The proteins in the 72-h serum-free culture medium were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and redissolved in SDS sample buffer. The samples, 15 μl of cell lysate and 10 or 20 μl of the solubilized trichloroacetic acid precipitate, were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% nonfat milk powder in Tris-buffered saline-Tween. The membranes were incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-collagen type I (Rockland) or polyclonal rabbit anti-collagen type VI (Rockland) and further with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (P.A.R.I.S) secondary antibody. Immunocomplexes were visualized by using ECL+ reagent (GE Healthcare) and Kodak X-AR films. Types I and VI collagen α chain levels were quantified with ImageQuant 5.2 software (GE Healthcare) from the films. The distribution of soluble collagen between cells and medium was compared with control cells and medium. Type VI collagen from EBS and control fibroblasts was biosynthetically labeled with [35S]methionine, immunoprecipitated, and detected as previously described (33Lamandé S.R. Mörgelin M. Adams N.E. Selan C. Allen J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16607-16614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). LH mutant mice showed ultrastructural alterations in their skin and muscle (25Ruotsalainen H. Sipilä L. Vapola M. Sormunen R. Salo A.M. Uitto L. Mercer D.K. Robins S.P. Risteli M. Aszodi A.

Therefore we examined these tissues in newborn and adult heterozygous LH3 knock-out mice by transmission electron microscopy. The muscle tissue had no obvious abnormalities (data not shown). However, the dermis appeared looser and more edematous than the wild-type dermis. Analysis of collagen cross-sections in adult skin showed that the mean fibril diameter was significantly (p < 0.001) decreased in heterozygous LH3 knock-out mice (Fig. 1, A and B) compared with wild-type, being 52 ± 10 and 61 ± 8 nm, respectively. In addition, the relative frequency of collagen fibrils with variable diameters in the skin of adult heterozygous LH3 knock-out mice differed from that in wild-type mice (Fig. 1B). In newborn skin, no variation in mean fibril diameter was observed between the genotypes. However, the skin of newborn heterozygous LH3 knock-out mice contained small diameter fibrils with higher frequency and also the range of the fibril diameter was wider than in wild-type skin, although the changes were not statistically significant (Fig. 1C). These data from the skin of heterozygous LH3 knock-out mice demonstrate that a moderate decrease in the amount of LH3 affects collagen fibrillogenesis in vivo. A Finnish family with EBS (28Savolainen E.R. Kero M. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. N. Engl. J. Med. 1981; 304: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was reported earlier to have reduced GGT activity and a markedly decreased urinary excretion of glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine. We re-examined this family to determine whether a defect in LH3 could explain these observations. Our data (Fig. 2A) are consistent with previous results (28Savolainen E.R. Kero M. Pihlajaniemi T. Kivirikko K.I. N. Engl. J. Med. 1981; 304: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), showing a decrease in the GGT activity of skin fibroblasts (about 70% of control) for patient 10. The GGT activity measured in the 72-h culture medium from confluent cells was 42% of controls. A similar decrease in the GGT level (80% of normal mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF+/+), Fig. 2B) was also found in our heterozygous LH3 knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF+/−). The GGT activity detected in the culture medium of LH3 knock-out MEF+/− (Fig. 2B) was only about 10% of that found in medium from control MEF+/+, indicating that a reduction of GGT/LH3 inside the cells markedly affected the secretion of activity from the cells. This finding is thus consistent with results obtained with EBS patient fibroblasts. We have previously shown that LH3 is the main molecule responsible for GGT activity in mouse embryos and the LH3 protein level correlates with the GGT activity of adult mouse tissues (23Salo A.M. Wang C. Sipilä L. Sormunen R. Vapola M. Kervinen P. Ruotsalainen H. Heikkinen J. Myllylä R. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 207: 644-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 25Ruotsalainen H. Sipilä L.

Therefore the LH3 protein levels in EBS patient fibroblasts and cell culture media were assayed by immunoblotting and immunoelectron microscopy. On immunoblots, the amount of LH3 protein was reduced in EBS patient fibroblasts and also in the cell culture media (Fig. 3A). The molecular weight of LH3 did not differ between the control and EBS patient suggesting that glycosylation and processing of LH3 is normal in the EBS patient. In immunoelectron microscopy (Fig. 3B), LH3 was observed to line the endoplasmic reticulum membranes in both EBS patient and control cells, confirming earlier results from mouse tissues (23Salo A.M. Wang C. Sipilä L. Sormunen R. Vapola M. Kervinen P. Ruotsalainen H. Heikkinen J. Myllylä R. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 207: 644-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). When the gold particles in a 4.4-μm2 area of the endoplasmic reticulum were counted in 30 cells, fewer particles, about 57% of controls, were observed in the EBS fibroblasts, revealing a reduction in the amount of LH3 in these cells. Taken together, these results indicate that although there are no molecular weight differences between the LH3 proteins produced by the EBS patient and control cells, the quantity of LH3, measured either as GGT activity or as LH3 protein, was decreased in the EBS patient and the decrease was more pronounced in the cell culture medium. To study the reason for the reduced amount of LH3 in EBS patient fibroblasts, the expression level of the LH3 gene (PLOD3) was analyzed by quantitative PCR, and the LH3 cDNA and promoter and exon 1 regions of the LH3 gene (PLOD3) were sequenced. Our data indicate that the LH3 mRNA level in the EBS patient was 67% (S.D. ± 11) of the control level. Sequencing of the LH3 cDNA did not reveal any mutations in the LH3 coding region in the EBS patient. In the genomic DNA (Fig. 3C), heterozygous A195G and A434G changes were observed upstream, and heterozygous C882T and A1011G changes were found downstream of the main transcription start site of the PLOD3 (AF207096) in the EBS patient. Changes at positions A195G, A434G, and A1011G were also found in the genomic DNA of healthy controls, which reveals them as polymorphic changes. The heterozygous A1011G change in the genomic DNA was present as A376 in the cDNA (NM_001084) of the EBS patient (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, LH3 cDNA of the EBS patient contained only T at position 247 corresponding to a heterozygous C882T in the genomic DNA (Fig. 3C). Our sequencing data thus indicate that only one of the LH3 alleles is transcribed in the EBS patient. This is in agreement with the reduced amount of LH3 mRNA seen in our quantitative PCR analysis. These findings explain the low level of GGT activity and LH3 protein in EBS patient fibroblasts, and thus represent a human heterozygous null model of LH3 gene (PLOD3). Our recent analysis of LH3 knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts have indicated that a loss of glycosylated hydroxylysines prevents intracellular tetramerization of type VI collagen and leads to impaired secretion of this collagen (26Sipilä L.

Therefore these proteins were also analyzed in the heterozygous LH3 knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF+/−) and in EBS patient fibroblast cultures. Immunofluorescence staining was carried out with non-permeabilized cells cultured for 3 days after confluence to observe the ECM of the cells. In LH3 knock-out MEF+/−, the arrangement of the ECM components, type VI collagen, fibronectin, and type I collagen appeared abnormal when compared with the normal mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF+/+) (Fig. 4). Type VI collagen formed a fine and slightly interconnected three-dimensional network in LH3 knock-out MEF+/− (Fig. 4B), whereas a thick and heavily cross-linked network was observed in control MEF+/+ (Fig. 4A). Subsequently, an abnormal arrangement of fibronectin was also observed in the LH3 knock-out MEF+/− (Fig. 4F). In control MEF+/+, fibronectin formed a three-dimensional network of thick interconnected fibrils arranged in a nest-like pattern (Fig. 4E), whereas, in the LH3 knock-out MEF+/−, thin fibrils with few interconnections in the three-dimensional network were observed (Fig. 4F). Type I collagen was also abnormal in the LH3 knock-out MEF+/− (Fig. 4J); the fibrils were short and faint, differing from the type I collagen fibrils in normal MEF+/+ (Fig. 4I). The findings with the EBS patient fibroblasts (Fig. 4, D, H, and L) were similar to those of the LH3 knock-out MEF+/− that revealed abnormalities in the arrangements of fibronectin, and type VI and I collagens. These data suggest that even a moderate decrease in the amount of LH3 affects the deposition and"

A total of 507 children (ages 1-9 years), from 232 households were included in the study. All children were examined for trachoma by ophthalmic nurses using the WHO simplified clinical grading system. Interviews and observations were used to assess risk factors. Logistic regression procedures were used to determine associations between potential risk factors and signs of active trachoma.Overall, the prevalence of active trachoma was found to be 53.9% (95%CI 49.6%-58.2%). Presence of fly-eye (fly contact with the eyelid margin during eye examination) (Odds Ratio (OR) = 4.03 95% CI 1.40-11.59), absence of facial cleanliness (OR = 7.59; 95%CI 4.60-12.52), an illiterate mother (OR = 5.88; 95%CI 2.10-15.95), lack of access to piped water (OR = 2.19; 95%CI 1.14-6.08), and lack of access to latrine facilities (OR = 4.36; 95%CI 1.49-12.74) were statistically significantly associated with increased risk of active trachoma.Active trachoma among children 1-9 years of age in Ankober is highly prevalent and significantly associated with a number of risk factors including access to water and latrine facilities. Trachoma prevention programs that include improved access to water and sanitation, active fly control, and hygiene education are recommended to lower the burden of trachoma in Ankober, Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W2067949982,"Intracellular Ca2+ mobilization plays an important role in a wide variety of cellular processes, and multiple second messengers are responsible for mediating intracellular Ca2+ changes. Here we explored the role of one endogenous Ca2+-mobilizing nucleotide, cyclic adenosine diphosphoribose (cADPR), in the proliferation and differentiation of neurosecretory PC12 cells. We found that cADPR induced Ca2+ release in PC12 cells and that CD38 is the main ADP-ribosyl cyclase responsible for the acetylcholine (ACh)-induced cADPR production in PC12 cells. In addition, the CD38/cADPR signaling pathway is shown to be required for the ACh-induced Ca2+ increase and cell proliferation. Inhibition of the pathway, on the other hand, accelerated nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neuronal differentiation in PC12 cells. Conversely, overexpression of CD38 increased cell proliferation but delayed NGF-induced differentiation. Our data indicate that cADPR plays a dichotomic role in regulating proliferation and neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells."

https://openalex.org/W2062150380,"Myxobacteria, especially members of the genus Sorangium, are known for their biotechnological potential as producers of pharmaceutically valuable secondary metabolites. The biosynthesis of several of those myxobacterial compounds includes cytochrome P450 activity. Although class I cytochrome P450 enzymes occur wide-spread in bacteria and rely on ferredoxins and ferredoxin reductases as essential electron mediators, the study of these proteins is often neglected. Therefore, we decided to search in the Sorangium cellulosum So ce56 genome for putative interaction partners of cytochromes P450. In this work we report the investigation of eight myxobacterial ferredoxins and two ferredoxin reductases with respect to their activity in cytochrome P450 systems. Intriguingly, we found not only one, but two ferredoxins whose ability to sustain an endogenous So ce56 cytochrome P450 was demonstrated by CYP260A1-dependent conversion of nootkatone. Moreover, we could demonstrate that the two ferredoxins were able to receive electrons from both ferredoxin reductases. These findings indicate that S. cellulosum can alternate between different electron transport pathways to sustain cytochrome P450 activity.

The catalytic versatility of the family members explains their involvement in such diverse biological processes as biosynthesis of steroid hormones, carbon source assimilation, and metabolism of xenobiotics. In addition, cytochrome P450 enzymes have been reported to be involved in the biosynthesis of many pharmaceutically interesting secondary metabolites from a variety of microorganisms (1Bernhardt R. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 127: 137-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Bernhardt R. J. Biotechnol. 2006; 124: 128-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 3Bernhardt R.

Drug Metab. Rev. 2007; 39: 481-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cytochromes P450 are usually dependent on an external electron donor. With respect to their electron transport system they can be divided into several classes, with class I (the mitochondrial/bacterial cytochrome P450 systems) being the predominant form in prokaryotes (5Hannemann F. Bichet A. Ewen K.M. Bernhardt R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1770: 330-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). In this system the electrons required for the enzymatic reaction originate from NAD(P)H and are delivered to the cytochrome P450 via a ferredoxin reductase and a ferredoxin. In a number of examples, the heterologous reconstitution of the electron transfer chain has been shown to be ineffective, if possible at all (5Hannemann F. Bichet A. Ewen K.M. Bernhardt R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1770: 330-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Thus, it is desirable to identify the natural redox partners, especially if genomic sequence information is available. However, even then the identification of the correct interaction partners remains challenging because the encoding genes are frequently located at genomic loci distant to the cytochrome P450 genes (6Bell S.G. Hoskins N. Xu F. Caprotti D. Rao Z. Wong L.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 342: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 7Parajuli N. Basnet D.B. Chan Lee H. Sohng J.K. Liou K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 425: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Interestingly, members of both the [2Fe-2S] and the non-[2Fe-2S] ferredoxins have been reported to sustain cytochrome P450 catalyzed reactions. The latter group is further subdivided into mono- and dicluster ferredoxins (i.e. the [3Fe-4S] or [4Fe-4S] and the [3Fe-4S] + [4Fe-4S] or [4Fe-4S] + [4Fe-4S] ferredoxins). Remarkably, cytochrome P450 systems depending on non-[2Fe-2S] ferredoxins have been found exclusively in bacteria to date (8Sticht H. Rösch P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1998; 70: 95-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 9Meyer J. J. Biol. Inorg.

To fulfill the role as electron mediator, the ferredoxin component of any given cytochrome P450 system has to be reduced. This reduction is achieved by a ferredoxin reductase, which in turn takes up electrons from NAD(P)H. The ferredoxin reductase is often the least characterized constituent of the cytochrome P450 system because these flavoproteins may be unstable (i.e. easily lose their cofactor) and usually show a relatively low level of expression (10Ramachandra M.

Because of their biotechnological potential as producers of secondary metabolites, the myxobacteria attract attention from both the academic community and the pharmaceutical industry.

With a size of more than 13 Mbp, the genome of S. cellulosum So ce56 is to date the largest sequenced prokaryotic genome (12Schneiker S. Perlova O. Kaiser O. Gerth K. Alici A. Altmeyer M.O.

Müller R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2007; 25: 1281-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). It has been shown to harbor 21 cytochrome P450 genes. In light of the significance of S. cellulosum as a viable source of bioactive secondary metabolites (14Reichenbach H. J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 27: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and the role of cytochromes P450 in the synthesis of natural products (2Bernhardt R. J. Biotechnol. 2006; 124: 128-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), it is of great interest to elucidate the function of these enzymes. Therefore, the investigation of the S. cellulosum So ce56 cytochrome P450 systems opens a fascinating field not only with regard to basic research but also to exploit the biotechnological potential of this model strain. To achieve this goal it is important to provide a functional electron transport chain. Thus, the main objective of this work was to identify a myxobacterial ferredoxin/ferredoxin reductase couple able to support reactions catalyzed by S. cellulosum So ce56 cytochromes P450. Putative ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase genes were identified by searching the genome of S. cellulosum So ce56 for sequences similar to those of various known ferredoxins and flavoproteins. Translation of the DNA sequences was performed using the ExPASy Translate tool. Prediction of molecular mass and theoretical pI values was performed using Compute pI/Mw(22Gasteiger E. Hoogland C.

Prediction of the ferredoxin cluster type and checking for the presence of NAD(P)H and flavin binding domains in the flavoproteins was done via Pfam Version 21.0 (23Finn R.D. Mistry J.

Oligonucleotides were purchased from BioTeZ Berlin-Buch GmbH (Berlin, Germany) or Eurofins-MWG (Ebersberg, Germany). The Escherichia coli strains used were from Novagen (affiliate of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), nutrient broth medium was from Sifin (Berlin, Germany), antibiotics were from Carl Roth GmbH (Karlsruhe, Germany), and isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was from Acros Organics. FAD, FMN, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were obtained from Serva Electrophoresis GmbH (Heidelberg, Germany), NADH and NADPH were from GERBU Biochemicals GmbH (Gaiberg, Germany). Glucose 6-phosphate was obtained from Carl Roth GmbH. Nootkatone and sodium dithionite were purchased from Fluka Analytical/Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH (Steinheim, Germany); dithiothreitol and reduced glutathione were likewise from Sigma-Aldrich. Chromatography media for protein purification were purchased from GE Healthcare for glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow and Superdex 75 pg and Clontech Laboratories for Talon Metal Affinity Resin. Other standard chemicals and reagents used were of the highest purity commercially available. Genomic DNA from S. cellulosum So ce56 was isolated using the Puregene® Genomic DNA purification kit (Gentra, Minneapolis, MN) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid DNA purification was performed using either the NucleoSpin Plasmid QuickPure kit or the Nucleobond Plasmid Purification AX 100 kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). DNA fragments encoding the proteins of interest were prepared by polymerase chain reaction using genomic DNA of S. cellulosum So ce56 as template. The PCR primers were designed to introduce an NcoI restriction site at the 5′-end of the fragment and an EcoRI and/or HindIII restriction site at the 3′-end, respectively. Apart from these modifications, fragments with and without a sequence stretch encoding a C-terminal His6 tag were generated. For expression in E. coli, the plasmids pKKHC and pGEX6P1_nco were used. Plasmid pKKHC (24Porter T.D. Larson J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was a gift from Todd Porter (Ann-Arbor, Michigan, MI). Plasmid pGEX6P1_nco was derived from pGEX6P1 (Amersham Biosciences) by introducing an NcoI recognition sequence in the multiple cloning site via site-directed mutagenesis. The fidelity of the PCR amplification was verified by DNA sequencing (performed by Eurofins-MWG, Ebersberg, Germany) after either the subcloning step or in the final expression vector. Precultures of E. coli BL21 harboring a ferredoxin expression plasmid were grown in nutrient broth medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin overnight. They were used to inoculate the 1-liter main culture containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and incubated at 37 °C until absorbance at 600 nm reached ∼1.0. At this point expression was induced by adding 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The incubation was continued for a minimum of 10 h (up to 48 h) at 25 or 37 °C, depending on the protein to be expressed. At the end of the expression period the E. coli cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 20 min, and the cell pellet was stored at −20 °C until further use. All of the following procedures were carried out at 4 °C. In the case of the ferredoxin reductases, overnight cultures of E. coli Rosetta(DE3)pLysS transformed with the adequate expression plasmid were used to inoculate 1 liter medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/liter chloramphenicol. The bacteria were grown at 37 °C under constant shaking until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 1.0. Induction was done as described above; afterward, the cultures were cultivated for another 24–48 h at 37 °C. The bacteria were harvested, and the cell pellet was stored as described above. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (25Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. vol. 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: A1.7Google Scholar) containing 1 mm EDTA. After the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (50 μg/ml), cells were sonicated, the suspension was centrifuged, and the ferredoxin-containing supernatant was loaded onto a column packed with glutathione-Sepharose. Affinity chromatography and cleavage of the glutathione S-transferase tag was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The cleaved-off ferredoxin was collected and concentrated for size exclusion chromatography, which was performed using Superdex 75 pg and 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with a constant flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. Suitable fractions were collected, concentrated, and stored at −20 °C. In the case of the His-tagged proteins, the bacteria were resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm NaCl and 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and disrupted by sonication. After centrifugation the supernatant was loaded onto an IMAC column (TALONTM Resin). Purification was carried out following the manufacturer's instructions. Fractions containing the heterologously expressed protein were collected and concentrated for size exclusion chromatography, which was performed using a Superdex 75 pg column and 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with a constant flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. Suitable fractions were collected, concentrated, and stored at −20 °C. UV-visible spectra from 250 to 700 nm were recorded in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, using a Shimadzu UVPC-2100 double-beam spectrophotometer. Applying the values obtained by total protein quantification of the purified proteins using BC Assay kit (Uptima/Interchim, Montlucon, France), the molar extinction coefficient at the characteristic maxima of the individual proteins was calculated. EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ESP300 spectrometer (X-band, 9.5 GHz) equipped with a continuous flow helium cryostat ESR 900 and an ITC 4 temperature controller (Oxford Instruments) to allow measurements down to 5 K. Parameters in standard measurements were: modulation frequency, 100 kHz; microwave power, 2 milliwatts; modulation amplitude, 5 G; time constant, 41 ms. The microwave frequency was measured by a HP 5350B frequency counter. Other parameters of measurements are given in the legend for Fig. 2. The samples (150 μm) in oxidized form or after reduction with dithionite were transferred in EPR quartz tubes (Wilmad) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The spectral parameters (g-tensor, line width) of the FeS centers were obtained by simulation of the spectra with the programs Simfonia or Xsophe (Bruker). Partial reduction of FdR_A and FdR_B was achieved by titration with NADH or NADPH. For LC-MS analysis of the flavin the purified flavoproteins were diluted to a final concentration of 10 μm with methanol at 23 °C and centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g. In the case of FdR_B, this treatment resulted in the denaturation of the protein and release of the flavin cofactor to the supernatant. The flavin cofactor of FdR_A, however, remained bound to the precipitated protein. To remove the prosthetic group of FdR_A, the protein was diluted in water and denatured by incubation at 100 °C for 10 min in the dark (26Aliverti A. Curti B. Vanoni M.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 131: 9-23PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting flavin-containing supernatant was concentrated by evaporation and afterwards diluted with methanol to a final concentration of 10 μm. Five μl of the flavin solution were analyzed by LC-MS (Agilent 1100 series, Bruker HCT plus Ion Trap mass spectrometer). Chromatography and identification of the flavin species was performed as described previously (27Ewen K.M. Schiffler B. Uhlmann-Schiffler H. Bernhardt R. Hannemann F. FEMS Yeast Res. 2008; 8: 432-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Km values of FdR_A and FdR_B for NADPH were obtained by spectrophotometrically observing the reduction of ferricyanide at 420 nm (ϵ420 = 1020 m−1 cm−1) (28McLean K.J. Scrutton N.S. Munro A.W. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The reduction of ferricyanide was assayed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 23 °C using 1 μm FdR, 2 mm potassium ferricyanide, and different concentrations of NAD(P)H. The reaction was initiated by the addition of NAD(P)H, and the reaction progress was followed over 60 s. Reactions were performed in triplicate. The obtained reaction rates were fitted using Origin software (Microcal) to derive Km values. CYP260A1-dependent conversion of nootkatone was used to investigate the ability of different ferredoxin-ferredoxin reductase combinations to deliver electrons to an actual S. cellulosum So ce56 cytochrome P450. For each combination we prepared at least triplicate reactions. The reaction mixture contained 2 μm FdR, 20 μm ferredoxin, 0.25 μm CYP260A1, 100 μm nootkatone, and a NADPH-regenerating system consisting of 5 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 unit of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The total reaction volume was 500 μl. The reaction was started by the addition of NADPH to a final concentration of 200 μm and incubated at 30 °C for 90 min. Samples were extracted two times with chloroform, and the extracts were dried and resuspended in 200 μl of acetonitrile. HPLC analysis was performed employing a reversed phase column (Waters 3.9 × 150-mm column WAT036975) and an isocratic solvent system containing acetonitrile/water (40:60). Substrate and products were detected at 240 nm. Assuming the absorbance properties of the products are the same as those of the substrate, the peak areas were used to determine the overall product formation. The products of the CYP260A1-dependent conversion of nootkatone were analyzed by LC-MS (Agilent 1100 series solvent delivery system coupled to a Bruker HCT plus ion trap mass spectrometer). Separation was performed on a RP-C18 column (Luna HST, 100 × 2 mm, 2.5-μm particle size; Phenomenex) at 32 °C using a mobile phase gradient from 5 to 95% B at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Solvent A (water) and solvent B (acetonitrile) each contained 0.1% formic acid. Mass spectrometric detection was carried out in positive ionization mode ([M+H]+ = 235 m/z or 251 m/z for mono- or dihydroxylated products, respectively). In the NADPH consumption assay the four combinations, Fdx2-FdR_B, Fdx8-FdR_B, Fdx2-FdR_A, and Fdx8-FdR_A, shown to support the catalytic activity of CYP260A1 were further investigated. The reaction mixture contained 2 μm FdR, 20 μm ferredoxin, and 0.25 μm CYP260A1 in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The substrate (nootkatone) concentration was varied from 0 to 100 μm. After the addition of NADPH to a final concentration of 200 μm, the absorbance at 340 nm was monitored for 5 min. The NADPH consumption rates were calculated using ϵ340 = 6220 m−1 cm−1. For each concentration the NADPH oxidation rates (expressed as mol of NADPH oxidized/s/mol of CYP) from at least three measurements were plotted. The obtained data were fitted hyperbolically using Origin software (Microcal) to derive apparent the Km and kcat values. Searching the genome of S. cellulosum So ce56 for possible interaction partners of cytochrome P450 systems revealed the presence of eight putative ferredoxin genes and two putative ferredoxin reductase genes. Neither flavodoxin-like nor cytochrome P450 reductase-like genes were found. All of the ferredoxin genes are distributed over the whole chromosome and are not in the neighborhood of either one of the putative ferredoxin reductase genes or one of the 21 cytochrome P450 genes in S. cellulosum So ce56 (data not shown). Protein domain analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences of Fdx1–8 using the Pfam Data base indicated that ferredoxins 1 and 5 might harbor a [2Fe-2S] cluster, whereas ferredoxins 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 were predicted to belong to the [4Fe-4S] cluster ferredoxins with Fdx2, -6, and -8 being the monocluster type and Fdx4 and -7 having two clusters (see Table 1). A Pfam match of Fdx3 declared this protein as a “sucrase/ferredoxin-like” protein. As the name indicates, proteins of this type resemble ferredoxins, albeit they are usually considerably larger in size and display sucrolytic activity.TABLE 1Bioinformatic analysis of ferredoxins and ferredoxin reductases from S. cellulosum So ce56Protein nameGene nameUniProt entryNo. amino acidsPredicted molecular massTheoretical pIPfam matches (over residues)kDaFdx1sce7334A9EY1811812.84.94Fer2 (6–89)Fdx2sce8005A9FH2110111.24.29Fer4 (2–25)Fdx3sce9225A9GDT712713.68.34Sucrase/Ferredoxin-like (71–102)Fdx4sce3039A9GFT911111.94.62Fer4 (3–26), Fer4 (34–57)Fdx5sce7304A9EXQ010310.95.47Fer2 (5–88)Fdx6sce5732A9G7R424125.78.16Fer4 (155–180)Fdx7sce2755A9GAV09410.45.61Fer4 (31–55), Fer4 (63–86)Fdx8sce5549A9G31710711.94.32Fer4 (52–75)FdR_Asce7188A9ES5527830.56.01FAD_binding_6 (7–97) NAD_binding_1 (112–231)FdR_Bsce5135A9FRJ024426.77.96FAD_binding_6 (8–104) FAD_binding_9 (10–103) NAD_binding_1 (114–225) Open table in a new tab As it was not possible to deduce the ferredoxin(s) involved in S. cellulosum cytochrome P450 systems by bioinformatic analysis, we set out to heterologously express and characterize the respective proteins.

https://openalex.org/W1975389753,"The human stomatin-like protein-1 (SLP-1) is a membrane protein with a characteristic bipartite structure containing a stomatin domain and a sterol carrier protein-2 (SCP-2) domain. This structure suggests a role for SLP-1 in sterol/lipid transfer and transport. Because SLP-1 has not been investigated, we first studied the molecular and cell biological characteristics of the expressed protein. We show here that SLP-1 localizes to the late endosomal compartment, like stomatin. Unlike stomatin, SLP-1 does not localize to the plasma membrane. Overexpression of SLP-1 leads to the redistribution of stomatin from the plasma membrane to late endosomes suggesting a complex formation between these proteins. We found that the targeting of SLP-1 to late endosomes is caused by a GYXXΦ (Φ being a bulky, hydrophobic amino acid) sorting signal at the N terminus. Mutation of this signal results in plasma membrane localization. SLP-1 and stomatin co-localize in the late endosomal compartment, they co-immunoprecipitate, thus showing a direct interaction, and they associate with detergent-resistant membranes. In accordance with the proposed lipid transfer function, we show that, under conditions of blocked cholesterol efflux from late endosomes, SLP-1 induces the formation of enlarged, cholesterol-filled, weakly LAMP-2-positive, acidic vesicles in the perinuclear region. This massive cholesterol accumulation clearly depends on the SCP-2 domain of SLP-1, suggesting a role for this domain in cholesterol transfer to late endosomes.

The founder of the family, stomatin, is a major protein of the red blood cell membrane (band 7.2) and is ubiquitously expressed (18Salzer U. Mairhofer M. Prohaska R. Dyn. Cell Biol. 2007; 1: 20-33Google Scholar). It is missing in red cells of patients with overhydrated hereditary stomatocytosis, a pathological condition characterized by increased permeability of the red cells for monovalent ions and stomatocytic morphology (19Stewart G.W.

Several interactions of stomatin with membrane proteins have been revealed, notably with the acid sensing ion channels (32Price M.P. Thompson R.J. Eshcol J.O. Wemmie J.A. Benson C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53886-53891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and the glucose transporter GLUT1 (33Zhang J.Z. Hayashi H. Ebina Y. Prohaska R. Ismail-Beigi F. Arch.

Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C1277-C1283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, stomatin functions as a switch of GLUT1 specificity from glucose to dehydroascorbate in the human red blood cell thus increasing vitamin C recycling and compensating the human inability to synthesize vitamin C (35Montel-Hagen A. Kinet S. Manel N. Mongellaz C. Prohaska R. Battini J.L. Delaunay J. Sitbon M. Taylor N. Cell. 2008; 132: 1039-1048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The C. elegans genome contains 10 members of the stomatin family. Defects in three of these genes (mec-2, unc-1, and unc-24) cause distinct neuropathologic phenotypes, namely uncoordinated movement and defect in mechanosensation, respectively (36Zhang S. Arnadottir J. Keller C. Caldwell G.A. Yao C.A. Chalfie M. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1888-1896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 37Huang M. Gu G. Ferguson E.L. Chalfie M. Nature. 1995; 378: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). These are explained by dysfunction of the respective stomatin-like proteins in complex with degenerin/epithelial sodium channels that also affects the sensitivity to volatile anesthetics (38Morgan P.G. Sedensky M. Meneely P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 2965-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 39Rajaram S. Sedensky M.M. Morgan P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 8761-8766Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Importantly, MEC-2 and human podocin bind cholesterol and form large supercomplexes with various ion channels thus modulating channel activity (40Huber T.B. Schermer B. Müller R.U. Höhne M. Bartram M. Calixto A. Hagmann H. Reinhardt C. Koos F. Kunzelmann K. Shirokova E. Krautwurst D. Harteneck C. Simons M. Pavenstädt H. Kerjaschki D. Thiele C. Walz G. Chalfie M. Benzing T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 17079-17086Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The biological functions of the SLP-1 orthologue UNC-24 and stomatin orthologue UNC-1 are associated, because the unc-24 gene controls the distribution or stability of the UNC-1 protein (41Sedensky M.M. Siefker J.M. Morgan P.G. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 280: C1340-C1348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, UNC-24 co-localizes and interacts with MEC-2 and is essential for touch sensitivity (36Zhang S. Arnadottir J. Keller C. Caldwell G.A. Yao C.A. Chalfie M. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1888-1896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we hypothesize that human stomatin and SLP-1 similarly interact and modify the distribution of each other. These proteins may have important functions in regulating the activity of ion channels in the human brain and muscle tissues. Despite its putative role in cellular lipid distribution, SLP-1 has not been studied to date. In this work, we characterized human SLP-1 as a late endosomal protein and identified an N-terminal GYXXΦ motif as the targeting signal. We found that SLP-1 interacts with stomatin in vitro and in vivo and associates with DRMs. Regarding the proposed lipid transfer function, we showed that SLP-1 induces the formation of large, cholesterol-rich vesicles or vacuoles when cholesterol trafficking from the late endosomes is blocked suggesting a net cholesterol transfer to the late endosomes and/or lysosomes. This effect was clearly attributed to the SCP-2/nonspecific lipid transfer protein domain of SLP-1, in line with the original hypothesis. The monoclonal antibody against human stomatin (GARP-50) was described previously (5Hiebl-Dirschmied C.M. Adolf G.R. Prohaska R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1065: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies against LAMP-1 (clone H4A3) and LAMP-2 (clone H4B4) were from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa), the rabbit polyclonal and mouse monoclonal (clone 4A6) antibodies against the myc tag were from Upstate. Monoclonal antibody against flotillin-2 was from BD Transduction Laboratories; monoclonal antibody against cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (clone 2G11), and rabbit antibody against GFP were from Abcam. Monoclonal antibody against GFP (clone B2) and rabbit antibody against the transferrin receptor (TfR) were obtained from Santa Cruz. Fluorescent secondary antibodies (anti-mouse Alexa 488, anti-rabbit Alexa 488, anti-mouse Alexa 596, and anti-rabbit Alexa 596) and LysoTracker Red were from Molecular Probes/Invitrogen. Purified recombinant GFP protein was from Upstate; Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and glutamate stocks were purchased from PAA Laboratories, Inc. (Pasching, Austria). Filipin and TRITC-dextran were from Sigma; U18666A was from Calbiochem. IMAGE-clone number 5185908 carrying the complete coding region for the SLP-1 protein was obtained from the German Resource Center for Genome Research (RZPD). The coding region was amplified by PCR from the vector with the following primers: SLP-1-GFP-NT, CGGAATTCGCCATGCTCGGCAGGTCT and SLP-1-GFP-CT, TCCCCGCGGCTGCGCCCTTCAAGGCCCTGAGGAC. PCR products were digested with restriction enzymes EcoRI and SacII and ligated into the corresponding sites of the pEGFP-N3 vector (BD Biosciences Clontech). To yield myc-tagged SLP-1, a double-stranded oligonucleotide coding for sequence EQKLISEEDL and followed by a stop codon was ligated into the SpeI and EcoRV restriction sites of the pEFBOS-puro vector. The coding region of SLP-1 was amplified by PCR with primers SLP-1-myc-NT, GGACTAGTGCCATGCTCGGCAGGTCT and SLP-1-myc-CT, GGACTAGTCTTCAAGGCCCTGAGGAC, the PCR product was digested with SpeI and ligated into the SpeI restriction site preceding the myc tag. C-terminal deletions SLP-1-(1–288)-GFP and SLP-1-(1–224)-GFP were constructed using SLP-1-GFP-NT as forward primer and the respective reverse primers for PCR: SLP1-T288-GFP, TCCCCGCGGCTGCGCCAGGCTGCTTCGGACTGG and SLP1-T224-GFP, TCCCCGCGGCTGCGCCCGGCTGGAGCACGGCCTC. N-terminal deletions were constructed by PCR amplification with the SLP-1-myc-CT reverse primer and the following forward primers: SLP-1-(43–397)-myc, GGACTAGTCCACCATGGCCGATGTACCCCAGAGC and SLP-1-(11–397)-myc, GGACTAGTCCACCATGCTGGGTGATTTTGACCGC. An overview of the SLP-1 deletion mutants and tagged constructs used in this work are given in Fig. 1. The point mutation Y6A in the GYXXΦ motif was introduced by PCR with the mutagenic forward primer: GGACTAGTCCACCATGCTCGGCAGGCTTGGGGCCCGGGCGCTGCC and the SLP-1-myc-CT primer. The PCR product was digested with SpeI and ligated into the XbaI site of vector pC3HA (based on pcDNA3.1hygro) upstream of a triple HA tag. The point mutation L9S was introduced by amplifying the region between the KpnI and BamHI restriction sites in the SLP-1 coding sequence with the mutagenic 5′ primer, GGTCTGGGTACCGGGCGTCCCCCCTGGGTGATTTTGACC and the non-mutagenic 3′ primer, GCGGATCCGGCCCAGG. This mutagenized fragment was then inserted into the SLP-1-myc construct via these restriction sites, giving rise to SLP-1(L9S)-myc. The chimeric SLP-1-stomatin fusions were prepared as follows. The coding region for amino acids 1–49 was amplified either from WT or Y6A or L9S mutated SLP-1 with the following primers: SLP-1-GFP-NT forward and the SLP-1-(1–49)-CT reverse primer with a SacII restriction site, TCCCCGCGGCTGCGCCGCTCTGGGGTACATCGG, and were inserted into the pEGFP-N3 vector. Then, the STOM-(21–287)-GFP construct (42Umlauf E. Csaszar E. Moertelmaier M. Schuetz G.J. Parton R.G. Prohaska R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23699-23709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) was digested with EcoRI, blunted with Klenow polymerase, and digested with BglII. The inserts with the coding region for amino acids 1–49 of SLP-1 (or point mutants Y6A or L9S) were prepared by digestion with SacII, followed by Klenow incubation, heat inactivation of Klenow enzyme, and subsequent digestion with BglII. The ligation of this insert into the STOM-(21–287)-GFP vector yields an in-frame fusion of the WT or point-mutated N terminus of SLP-1 to the N-terminal-truncated stomatin construct, with an 8-amino acid linker (GAANSATM) between the two sequences. Clones carrying the coding sequences for the different Rab proteins in a pcDNA3.1+ vector were purchased from the Missouri S&T cDNA Resource Center. The coding regions were amplified with primers: GFP-Rab5Aforw, GCCGCTCGAGGCGCTAGTCGAGGCGCA; GFP-Rab5Arev, CGGGGTACCTTAGTTACTACAACACTGA; GFP-Rab7Forw, GCCGCTCGAGGCACCTCTAGGAAGAAAG, GFP-Rab7Rev, CGGGGTACCTCAGCAACTGCAGCTTTCT; GFP-Rab9Forw, GCCGCTCGAGGCGCAGGAAAATCTTCAC; and GFP-Rab9Rev, CGGGGTACCTCAACAGCAAGATGAGCTA. PCR products were digested with XhoI and KpnI and ligated into the pEGFP-C1 vector (BD Biosciences Clontech). HeLa cells, HepG2 cells, and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin under standard conditions. About 5 × 105 cells per well were seeded on 6-well plates, cultivated overnight, and transient transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To obtain cell lines stably expressing tagged fusion proteins, transiently transfected cells were trypsinized and transferred to 100-mm culture dishes. The next day, either puromycin (2 μg/ml) or G418 (700 μg/ml) were added and the cells were cultured for 2–3 weeks until large single clones were visible. Multiple clones were picked with cloning rings (Sigma), expanded, and analyzed for expression of tagged fusion proteins by Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells with high and low expression levels were maintained. HeLa cells stably expressing SLP-1-GFP were grown on gridded Cellocate coverslips (Eppendorf). Cells strongly expressing SLP-1-GFP were selected and phase-contrast and fluorescence images were recorded. Subsequently, the cells were fixed for 1 h in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde, washed for 30 min with 0.1 m phosphate buffer, and then incubated for 2 h in 0.1 m phosphate buffer containing 50 mm glycine. Embedding in LR White, trimming, and thin sectioning was essentially performed as described (43Steiner M. Schöfer C. Mosgoeller W. Histochem. J. 1994; 26: 934-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thin sections were blocked for 1 h in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, containing 0.05% Tween 20, 5% bovine serum albumin, and 1% goat serum. Rabbit anti-GFP (Abcam) was diluted 1/500 in blocking buffer and thin sections were incubated for 2–3 h at room temperature. After washing 3 times with PBS, pH 7.4, 0.05% Tween 20, the thin sections were incubated with a 10-nm gold-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Biocell; diluted 1/40 in PBS, pH 8.0, 0.05% Tween 20) for 2 h. Finally, the thin sections were washed 3 times with PBS, pH 8.0, 0.05% Tween 20, stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 1 h and then analyzed with a Jeol 1200 EXII microscope. Staining of thin sections with blocked anti-GFP (incubated with a 10-fold excess of recombinant GFP for 2 h, 37 °C) showed only minimal background. Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described (42Umlauf E. Csaszar E. Moertelmaier M. Schuetz G.J. Parton R.G. Prohaska R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23699-23709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) except that the paraformaldehyde concentration in the fixing solution was 4%. In some experiments, lysosomes/late endosomes were stained with LysoTracker Red (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For internalization of TRITC-dextran, cells were serum-starved overnight and then incubated at 37 °C in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 5 mg/ml TRITC-dextran for 10 min. After labeling, cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed for fluorescence microscopy or incubated for 30 min in the same medium without TRITC-dextran prior to fixation. HeLa cells stably expressing SLP-1-GFP or GFP-tagged C-terminal truncation mutants of SLP-1 were grown in 150-mm culture dishes. Two dishes were used for each flotation experiment. Isolation of cellular membranes and subsequent density gradient centrifugation was performed as described (28Snyers L. Umlauf E. Prohaska R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 802-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) with some modifications. In brief, the resulting postnuclear supernatant was transferred to a SW55 polyallomer centrifuge tube (Beckman), diluted with 2 volumes of homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, with added protease inhibitors aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin A, and 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride), and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to pellet cellular membranes. The membrane pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors), lysed for 15–20 min on ice, and then mixed with 800 μl of 80% sucrose in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4. After complete mixing, 1.2 ml of the lysate, now containing 50% sucrose, were transferred to the bottom of a SW55 centrifuge tube, overlaid with 0.8 ml of 40% sucrose in Tris-buffered saline, 2 ml of 35% sucrose in Tris-buffered saline, and 0.5 ml of 5% sucrose in Tris-buffered saline. The gradient was centrifuged for 16–18 h at 230,000 × g in a Beckman ultracentrifuge with a SW55 rotor. Nine fractions of 0.5 ml were collected from the top and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Aliquots of the gradient fractions were analyzed for protein (BD protein determination kit, Bio-Rad) and cholesterol (Infinity cholesterol determination kit, Thermo Electron). Fractionation of HeLa cell lysates on Opti-Prep gradients was performed as described (44Meyers J.M. Prekeris R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49003-49010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), with some modifications. In brief, one 150-mm dish with confluent cells was used for preparing lysates. A post-nuclear supernatant was prepared as described above. One ml of this supernatant was loaded on top of an 11-ml linear density gradient from 5 to 20% Opti-Prep (containing 250 mm sucrose, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA) prepared in a SW40 centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 14–16 h. Nineteen fractions of 580 μl were taken from the top and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Aliquots were assayed for alkaline phosphatase activity as described (45Lowry O.H. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 4: 366-381Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). HeLa cells stably expressing GFP fusion proteins were lysed in RIPA buffer and immunoprecipitation was performed by a standard protocol (46Bonifacino J.S. Dell'Angelica E.C. Current Protocols in Cell Biology.in: Bonifacino J.S. Dasso M. Harford J.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yamada K.M. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2001Crossref Google Scholar). Rabbit anti-GFP antibody was used for specific reactions; rabbit preimmune serum was used for the control. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using the respective mouse monoclonal antibodies. Control HeLa cells and HeLa cells stably expressing GFP alone were used as further controls to make sure that co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous stomatin is not due to unspecific binding to the polyclonal antibody. In both controls, no stomatin was precipitated with the anti-GFP antibody (data not shown). A mixture of control HeLa cells and HeLa cells stably expressing the respective fusion protein was seeded onto glass coverslips at about 50% density. Cells were left to adhere overnight and the indicated concentrations of U18666A were added from a 2 mg/ml stock solution in water. Accumulation of cholesterol in perinuclear vesicles was assessed by filipin staining as described (47Kobayashi T. Beuchat M.H. Lindsay M. Frias S. Palmiter R.D. Sakuraba H. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Due to the lack of antibodies against native SLP-1, we prepared myc-, HA-, and GFP-tagged SLP-1 constructs, expressed them transiently and stably in several cell lines, and analyzed the cells by confocal microscopy. Fig. 2A depicts a HeLa cell stably expressing SLP-1-myc, a HepG2 cell transiently expressing SLP-1-GFP, and a Madin-Darby canine kidney cell transiently expressing SLP-1-GFP. In all 3 cell types, we observed perinuclear vesicle staining as for stomatin (48Snyers L. Thinès-Sempoux D. Prohaska R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 281-285PubMed Google Scholar). The same pattern was observed with HA-tagged SLP-1 (data not shown). In contrast to stomatin, we did not see any plasma membrane staining, neither in low expressing nor highly overexpressing cells. Immunoelectron microscopy of HeLa cells stably expressing SLP-1-GFP showed mainly staining of the limiting membrane of multivesicular bodies (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that SLP-1 is targeted to the late endosomal compartment. We performed immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy of HeLa cells stably expressing either SLP-1-GFP or SLP-1-myc and co-stained them with antibodies against early and late endosomal markers. SLP-1 co-localized with the late endosomal marker LAMP-2 and partially with cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor, a marker for a late endosomal subset (Fig. 3A). In contrast, no co-localization was observed with TfR, a marker for early/recycling endosomes. Moreover, we transiently transfected SLP-1-myc expressing HeLa cells with GFP-tagged Rab5A, Rab7, and Rab9 to visualize early (Rab5) and late (Rab7, Rab9) endosomes. SLP-1 clearly co-localized with Rab7 and Rab9 but not with Rab5 (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. S1A). Neither markers for the Golgi apparatus (GM130) nor peroxisomes (PMP70) co-localized with SLP-1 (supplemental Fig. S1B). To functionally confirm the late endosomal localization of SLP-1, we performed internalization studies with TRITC-dextran. After a 10-min incubation with TRITC-dextran, no co-localization with SLP-1-GFP was observed but after a chase time of 30 min, some SLP-1-GFP-positive vesicles were clearly labeled with endocytosed, fluorescent dextran (Fig. 3C) verifying the late endosomal localization. Because of the late endosomal localization of both stomatin and SLP-1, we transiently transfected HeLa cells with myc- or GFP-tagged SLP-1 and analyzed their co-distribution with endogenous stomatin. In untransfected cells, stomatin showed plasma membrane and perinuclear staining as reported previously (28Snyers L. Umlauf E. Prohaska R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 802-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In cells expressing SLP-1, stomatin and SLP-1 co-localized in perinuclear vesicles (Fig. 4A, upper panel).

https://openalex.org/W2033887186,"NUP98-HOXA9 is the prototype of a group of oncoproteins associated with acute myeloid leukemia. It consists of an N-terminal portion of NUP98 fused to the homeodomain of HOXA9 and is believed to act as an aberrant transcription factor that binds DNA through the homeodomain. Here we show that NUP98-HOXA9 can regulate transcription without binding to DNA. In order to determine the relative contributions of the NUP98 and HOXA9 portions to the transforming ability of NUP98-HOXA9, the effects of NUP98-HOXA9 on primary human CD34+ cells were dissected and compared to those of wild-type HOXA9. In contrast to previous findings in mouse cells, HOXA9 had only mild effects on the differentiation and proliferation of primary human hematopoietic cells. The ability of NUP98-HOXA9 to disrupt the differentiation of primary human CD34+ cells was found to depend primarily on the NUP98 portion, whereas induction of long-term proliferation required both the NUP98 moiety and an intact homeodomain. Using oligonucleotide microarrays in primary human CD34+ cells, a group of genes was identified whose dysregulation by NUP98-HOXA9 is attributable primarily to the NUP98 portion. These include RAP1A, HEY1, and PTGS2 (COX-2). Their functions may reflect the contribution of the NUP98 moiety of NUP98-HOXA9 to leukemic transformation. Taken together, these results suggest that the effects of NUP98-HOXA9 on gene transcription and cell transformation are mediated by at least two distinct mechanisms: one that involves promoter binding through the homeodomain with direct transcriptional activation, and another that depends predominantly on the NUP98 moiety and does not involve direct DNA binding."
https://openalex.org/W2078907863,"Rab21, a member of the Rab GTPase family, is known to be involved in membrane trafficking, but its implication in macropinocytosis is unclear. We analyzed the spatiotemporal localization of Rab21 in M-CSF-stimulated RAW264 macrophages by the live-cell imaging of fluorescent protein-fused Rab21. It was demonstrated that wild-type Rab21 was transiently associated with macropinosomes. Rab21 was recruited to the macropinosomes after a decrease in PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 levels. Although Rab21 was largely colocalized with Rab5, the recruitment of Rab21 to the macropinosomes lagged a minute behind that of Rab5, and preceded that of Rab7. Then, Rab21 was dissociated from the macropinosomes prior to the accumulation of Lamp1, a late endosomal/lysosomal marker. Our analysis of Rab21 mutants revealed that the GTP-bound mutant, Rab21-Q78L, was recruited to the macropinosomes, similarly to wild-type Rab21. However, the GDP-bound mutant, Rab21-T33N, did not localize on the formed macropinosomes, suggesting that the binding of GTP to Rab21 is required for the proper recruitment of Rab21 onto the macropinosomes. However, neither mutation of Rab21 significantly affected the rate of macropinosome formation. These data indicate that Rab21 is a transient component of early and intermediate stages of macropinocytosis, and probably functions in macropinosome maturation before fusing with lysosomal compartments."
https://openalex.org/W2006855421,"Background The precise mechanisms involved in the initiation and progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are not known. Early stages of RA often have non-specific symptoms, delaying diagnosis and therapy. Additionally, there are currently no established means to predict clinical responsiveness to therapy. Immune cell activation is a critical component therefore we examined the cellular activation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the early stages of RA, in order to develop a novel diagnostic modality. Methods and Findings PBMCs were isolated from individuals diagnosed with early RA (ERA) (n = 38), longstanding RA (n = 10), osteoarthritis (OA) (n = 19) and from healthy individuals (n = 10). PBMCs were examined for activation of 15 signaling effectors, using phosphorylation status as a measure of activation in immunophenotyped cells, by flow cytometry (phospho-flow). CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+ and CD20+ cells isolated from patients with ERA, RA and OA exhibited activation of multiple phospho-epitopes. ERA patient PBMCs showed a bias towards phosphorylation-activation in the CD4+ and CD20+ compartments compared to OA PBMCs, where phospho-activation was primarily observed in CD8+ cells. The ratio of phospho (p)-AKT/p-p38 was significantly elevated in patients with ERA and may have diagnostic potential. The mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) levels for p-AKT and p-H3 in CD4+, CD8+ and CD20+ T cells correlated directly with physician global assessment scores (MDGA) and DAS (disease activity score). Stratification by medications revealed that patients receiving leflunomide, systemic steroids or anti-TNF therapy had significant reductions in phospho-specific activation compared with patients not receiving these therapies. Correlative trends between medication-associated reductions in the levels of phosphorylation of specific signaling effectors and lower disease activity were observed. Conclusions Phospho-flow analysis identified phosphorylation-activation of specific signaling effectors in the PB from patients with ERA. Notably, phosphorylation of these signaling effectors did not distinguish ERA from late RA, suggesting that the activation status of discrete cell populations is already established early in disease. However, when the ratio of MFI values for p-AKT and p-p38 is >1.5, there is a high likelihood of having a diagnosis of RA. Our results suggest that longitudinal sampling of patients undergoing therapy may result in phospho-signatures that are predictive of drug responsiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2105830428,"The adaptor protein p66shc promotes cellular oxidative stress and apoptosis. Here, we demonstrate a novel mechanistic relationship between p66shc and the kruppel like factor-2 (KLF2) transcription factor and show that this relationship has biological relevance to p66shc-regulated cellular oxidant level, as well as KLF2-induced target gene expression. Genetic knockout of p66shc in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) stimulates activity of the core KLF2 promoter and increases KLF2 mRNA and protein expression. Similarly, shRNA-induced knockdown of p66shc increases KLF2-promoter activity in HeLa cells. The increase in KLF2-promoter activity in p66shc-knockout MEFs is dependent on a myocyte enhancing factor-2A (MEF2A)-binding sequence in the core KLF2 promoter. Short-hairpin RNA-induced knockdown of p66shc in endothelial cells also stimulates KLF2 mRNA and protein expression, as well as expression of the endothelial KLF2 target gene thrombomodulin. MEF2A protein and mRNA are more abundant in p66shc-knockout MEFs, resulting in greater occupancy of the KLF2 promoter by MEF2A. In endothelial cells, the increase in KLF2 and thrombomodulin protein by shRNA-induced decrease in p66shc expression is partly abrogated by knockdown of MEF2A. Finally, knockdown of KLF2 abolishes the decrease in the cellular reactive oxygen species hydrogen peroxide observed with knockdown of p66shc, and KLF2 overexpression suppresses cellular hydrogen peroxide levels, independent of p66shc expression. These findings illustrate a novel mechanism by which p66shc promotes cellular oxidative stress, through suppression of MEF2A expression and consequent repression of KLF2 transcription.—Kumar, A., Hoffman, T.

https://openalex.org/W2141395331,"Hydrogen constitutes nearly half of all atoms in proteins and their positions are essential for analyzing hydrogen-bonding interactions and refining atomic-level structures. However, most protein structures determined by experiments or computer prediction lack hydrogen coordinates. We present a new algorithm, HAAD, to predict the positions of hydrogen atoms based on the positions of heavy atoms. The algorithm is built on the basic rules of orbital hybridization followed by the optimization of steric repulsion and electrostatic interactions. We tested the algorithm using three independent data sets: ultra-high-resolution X-ray structures, structures determined by neutron diffraction, and NOE proton-proton distances. Compared with the widely used programs CHARMM and REDUCE, HAAD has a significantly higher accuracy, with the average RMSD of the predicted hydrogen atoms to the X-ray and neutron diffraction structures decreased by 26% and 11%, respectively. Furthermore, hydrogen atoms placed by HAAD have more matches with the NOE restraints and fewer clashes with heavy atoms. The average CPU cost by HAAD is 18 and 8 times lower than that of CHARMM and REDUCE, respectively. The significant advantage of HAAD in both the accuracy and the speed of the hydrogen additions should make HAAD a useful tool for the detailed study of protein structure and function.

Here we present a behavioural paradigm which offers a direct access to an estimate of voluntary shift time by comparing, in the same task, a situation in which subjects are required to re-engage their attention at the same spatial location with a situation in which they need to shift their attention to another location, all other sensory, cognitive and motor parameters being equal. We show that spatial attention takes on average 55 ms to voluntarily shift from one hemifield to the other and 38 ms to shift within the same hemifield. In addition, we show that across and within hemifields attentional processes are different. In particular, attentional spotlight division appears to be more difficult to operate within than across hemifields."
https://openalex.org/W2088100199,"AKAP-Lbc is a member of the A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) family that has been recently associated with the development of pathologies, such as cardiac hypertrophy and cancer. We have previously demonstrated that, at the molecular level, AKAP-Lbc functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that promotes the specific activation of RhoA. In the present study, we identified the ubiquitin-like protein LC3 as a novel regulatory protein interacting with AKAP-Lbc. Mutagenesis studies revealed that LC3, through its NH2-terminal α-helical domain, interacts with two binding sites located within the NH2-terminal regulatory region of AKAP-Lbc. Interestingly, LC3 overexpression strongly reduced the ability of AKAP-Lbc to interact with RhoA, profoundly impairing the Rho-GEF activity of the anchoring protein and, as a consequence, its ability to promote cytoskeletal rearrangements associated with the formation of actin stress fibers. Moreover, AKAP-Lbc mutants that fail to interact with LC3 show a higher basal Rho-GEF activity as compared with the wild type protein and become refractory to the inhibitory effect of LC3. This suggests that LC3 binding maintains AKAP-Lbc in an inactive state that displays a reduced ability to promote downstream signaling. Collectively, these findings provide evidence for a previously uncharacterized role of LC3 in the regulation of Rho signaling and in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton.

Evidence obtained in recent years indicates that AKAPs can coordinate the regulation of small molecular weight GTPases of the Ras superfamily. This is the case of AKAP-Lbc, which functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for RhoA (9Diviani D. Soderling J. Scott J.D. J. Biol.

On one hand, a deleted form of AKAP-Lbc missing the entire NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal regulatory regions and displaying constitutive Rho-GEF activity was originally isolated as an oncogene from myeloid leukemia patients (16Toksoz D.

On the other hand, in cardiomyocytes, AKAP-Lbc has been shown to assemble a macromolecular signal transduction complex that mediates cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, a pathophysiological condition that is associated with heart failure (17Appert-Collin A.

Interestingly, deletion of the NH2-terminal regulatory region from AKAP-Lbc strongly increases its hypertrophic activity (17Appert-Collin A. Cotecchia S. Nenniger-Tosato M. Pedrazzini T. Diviani D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 10140-10145Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings indicate that unregulated AKAP-Lbc GEF activity can produce deleterious effects. They also strongly suggest that the regulatory elements located outside of the GEF region of AKAP-Lbc play a critical role in the modulation of the signaling properties of the anchoring protein. Therefore, identifying the molecular mechanisms that affect AKAP-Lbc activity will importantly contribute to our understanding of how this anchoring protein modulates pathophysiological responses. In the present study, using a yeast two-hybrid approach, we identified the ubiquitin-like protein LC3 as a novel regulatory protein interacting with AKAP-Lbc. LC3 was originally identified as a subunit of the neuronal microtubule-associated proteins MAP1A and MAP1B in rats (19Mann S.S. Hammarback J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11492-11497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Shirazi A. Iizuka K. Fadden P. Mosse C. Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Haystead T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31598-31606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, experimental evidence collected over the last 10 years demonstrates that LC3 is expressed in many mammalian tissues, where it participates in autophagy, a cellular process that targets cytosolic proteins and organelles to the lysosome for degradation in response to nutrient starvation as well as cellular and tissue remodeling (21Ohsumi Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar, 22Mariño G. López-Otín C. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 1439-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). During autophagy, LC3 is targeted to autophagosomes. These membrane structures engulf cytosolic components and subsequently fuse with the lysosome, where the sequestered material is degraded and recycled (23Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5510) Google Scholar, 24Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. Cell Struct.

Because most studies have focused on the role of LC3 in autophagy, its role in non-autophagic cellular signaling pathways is poorly documented. Here we provide evidence that binding of LC3 to AKAP-Lbc inhibits its ability to activate RhoA and to promote RhoA-dependent reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. These results strongly suggest that LC3 plays a previously unappreciated role in the modulation of the Rho signaling pathway. AKAP-Lbc fragments encoding amino acids 1–503, 504–1000, 1001–1387, 1388–1922, 1923–2336, and 2337–2817 were PCR-amplified from the AKAP-Lbc pEGFPN vector (9Diviani D. Soderling J. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44247-44257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and subcloned at EcoRI/SalI into pLexA, pGEX4T1, and pFLAG-CMV6 vectors to generate protein fragments fused with LexA, GST, and the FLAG epitope, respectively. The full-length cDNA encoding human LC3 (isoform A) was PCR-amplified from library clones isolated in the yeast two-hybrid screen and subcloned at EcoRI-SalI in pACT2 (Clontech), pEGFPC2 (Clontech), pFLAGCMV6c (Sigma), and pET30a (Novagen) vectors to generate fusion proteins with the FLAG epitope, the histidine tag, GAL4, and GFP at the NH2 terminus, respectively. The NH2-terminal (LC3 N-term) and COOH-terminal (LC3 C-term) domains of LC3 were PCR-amplified from the LC3-pFLAGCMV6 vector and subcloned at EcoRII/SalI into the pFLAGCMV6, pET30a, and pEGFPC2 vectors to generate fusion proteins with the FLAG epitope, the histidine tag, and GFP at the NH2 terminus, respectively. For mapping the two LC3-binding sites on AKAP-Lbc, fragments encoding amino acids 1–100, 101–200, 201–300, 301–400, 401–503, 301–503, 320–503, 340–503, 360–503, 201–380, 201–360, 201–340, and 201–320 as well as fragments 1388–1493, 1493–1593, 1593–1693, 1693–1793, 1793–1922, 1388–1550, 1388–1513, 1388–1470, 1388–1450, 1428–1550, 1450–1550, and 1470–1550 were PCR-amplified from the AKAP-Lbc-pEGFP vector and subcloned at KpnI/AgeI into the pEGFPN1 vector to construct fusion proteins with GFP. For determination of the affinity of the interaction between LC3 and AKAP-Lbc, fragments encoding amino acids 301–503, 320–503, 201–360, 201–340, 201–320, 1388–1470, 1388–1450, 1450–1550, and 1470–1550 were PCR-amplified from the AKAP-Lbc-pEGFP vector and subcloned at EcoRI/SalI into the pGEX4T1 vector to construct fusion proteins with GST. FLAG-tagged AKAP-Lbc deletion mutants missing one (AKAP-Lbc Δ1 and AKAP-Lbc Δ2) or both (AKAP-Lbc Δ1,2) LC3 binding domains were generated by deleting the regions encoding amino acids 301–360 and 1450–1513, individually or in combination, by standard PCR-directed mutagenesis, using the FLAG-AKAP-Lbc vector (26Diviani D. Abuin L. Cotecchia S. Pansier L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2811-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) as a template. The GFP-tagged AKAP-Lbc Δ1,2 mutant was generated by excising a SacII/BspEI fragment from the FLAG-AKAP-Lbc Δ1,2 construct and by subcloning it into the AKAP-Lbc-pEGFP vector. The FLAG-RhoA T19N construct was generated by PCR-amplifying the entire coding sequence of RhoA T19N from the RhoA T19N-pCMV5 vector and by subcloning it at EcoRI/SalI into the pFLAGCMV6c vector. The yeast strain L40 was transformed with the AKAP-Lbc-(1–503)-pLexA plasmid encoding a fragment of AKAP-Lbc encompassing residues 1–503 fused to LexA. Clones were selected and subsequently transformed with 250 μg of a human heart Matchmaker cDNA library in the pACT2 vector (Clontech). Of four million double transformants, 15 exhibited moderate to strong growth on histidine-deficient plates. The library plasmids isolated from positive clones were cotransformed in the L40 strain with either the original bait vector or the empty pLexA plasmid, and the specificity of the interactions was confirmed by growth on histidine-deficient plates as well as by β-galactosidase activity (Yeast Protocols Handbook; Clontech). GST fusion proteins of AKAP-Lbc, LC3 and the Rho binding domain (RBD) of Rhotekin were expressed using the bacterial expression vector pGEX-4T1 in the BL21DE3 strain of Escherichia coli and purified. Exponentially growing bacterial cultures were incubated for 16 h at 16 °C with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and subsequently subjected to centrifugation. Pelleted bacteria were lysed in buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% (w/v) Triton-X-100, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), sonicated, and centrifuged at 38,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. After incubating the supernatants with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C, the resin was washed five times with 10 bed volumes of buffer A and stored at 4 °C. Beads containing GST-RBD were used immediately for the Rhotekin RBD pull-down assay. His6-tagged fusion proteins of LC3, LC3 N-term, and LC3 C-term were expressed using the bacterial expression vector pET30 in BL21DE3 bacteria and purified. Bacterial extracts containing His6-tagged fusion proteins were prepared in buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin). After a 1-min sonication, the lysates were centrifuged at 38,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The His6-tagged fusion proteins were purified by incubating the supernatant with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chelating resin (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was then washed five times with 10 bed volumes of buffer B and stored at 4 °C. His6-tagged fusion proteins were eluted from the resin with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 500 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin for 1 h at room temperature, dialyzed, and stored at −20 °C. The protein content of the eluates was assessed by Coomassie staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. HEK293 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and gentamycin (100 μg/ml) and transfected at 50–60% confluence in 100-mm dishes using the calcium-phosphate method. For the overexpression of constructs containing the full-length AKAP-Lbc, HEK293 and NIH3T3 cells were transfected at 80% confluence in 100- or 35-mm dishes using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfection, cells were grown for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum before harvesting. The total amount of transfected DNA was of 10–24 μg/100-mm dish and 1–4 μg/35-mm dish. For in vitro GST pull-downs, increasing concentrations (0.1 nm, 1 nm, 10 nm, 30 nm, 100 nm, 300 nm, 1 μm, and 10 μm) of bacterially purified His6-tagged LC3, LC3 N-term, and LC3 C-term were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) coupled to GST or to different GST-fused AKAP-Lbc fragments in 0.5 ml of buffer C (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed five times with buffer C containing 300 mm NaCl, resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (65 mm Tris, 2% SDS, 5% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8), and boiled for 3 min at 95 °C. Eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For GST pull-down experiments performed from cell lysates, HEK293 cells expressing various constructs grown in 100-mm dishes were lysed in 1 ml of buffer C and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) coupled to the different GST fusion proteins were incubated with 1.5 mg of proteins derived from the cell lysates in a total volume of 1 ml overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed five times with buffer C, and the proteins were eluted and analyzed as indicated above. For immunoprecipitation experiments, HEK293 cells expressing various constructs grown in 100-mm dishes were lysed in 1 ml of buffer C. Cell lysates were incubated 2 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel. The solubilized material was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with 20 μl of anti-FLAGM2 affinity resin (Sigma) to immunoprecipitate overexpressed FLAG-tagged proteins. Following a brief centrifugation on a bench-top centrifuge, the pelleted beads were washed five times with buffer C and twice with PBS, and proteins were eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer by boiling samples for 3 min at 95 °C. Eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Immunoprecipitations of endogenous AKAP-Lbc from HEK293 cells were performed as previously indicated (26Diviani D. Abuin L. Cotecchia S. Pansier L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2811-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) using anti-AKAP13 antibodies from Bethyl Laboratories. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous AKAP-Lbc from HEK293 cell lysates was performed as indicated previously (9Diviani D. Soderling J. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44247-44257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), using 4 μg of affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-AKAP13 antibodies (Bethyl Laboratories). Samples denatured in SDS-PAGE sample buffer were separated on acrylamide gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were incubated with primary antibodies and horseradish-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences), as indicated previously (9Diviani D. Soderling J. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44247-44257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The following affinity-purified primary antibodies were used for immunoblotting: rabbit polyclonal anti-AKAP-Lbc (1 mg/ml, 1:1000 dilution) (9Diviani D. Soderling J. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44247-44257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), rabbit polyclonal anti-AKAP-Lbc (1:1000 dilution; Bethyl Laboratories), mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (4.9 mg/ml, 1:2000 dilution; Sigma), mouse monoclonal anti-GFP (400 μg/ml, 1:500 dilution; Roche Applied Science), rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP (400 μg/ml, 1:1000 dilution; Roche Applied Science), mouse monoclonal anti-RhoA (200 μg/ml, 1:250 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), rabbit polyclonal anti-LC3 (1:200 dilution; a generous gift from Dr. Kominami), and mouse monoclonal anti-histidine tag (100 μg/ml, 1:1000 dilution; Qiagen). HEK293 cells grown in 100-mm dishes were transfected with 16 μg of the cDNAs encoding the various FLAG-AKAP-Lbc constructs in the absence or presence of 8 μg of the cDNAs encoding FLAG-LC3 or FLAG-LC3 C-term. 24 h after transfection, cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum for an additional 24 h. Cells were then treated for 15 min with 10% fetal calf serum and lysed in RBD lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 30 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were subjected to centrifugation at 38,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and incubated with 60 μg of RDB beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed three times with RBD buffer without sodium deoxycholate, resuspended in SDS-sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. NIH3T3 cells grown on coverslips were transfected at 40% confluence using Lipofectamine 2000 with 0.5 μg of the cDNAs encoding AKAP-Lbc-GFP or AKAP-Lbc Δ1,2-GFP in the absence or presence of 0.5 μg of the vectors encoding FLAG-LC3 or FLAG-LC3 C-term; washed twice with PBS; fixed for 10 min in PBS, 3.7% formaldehyde; and permeabilized for 5 min with 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100 in PBS. Cells were blocked for 30 min in PBS, 1% bovine serum albumin and subsequently incubated for 1 h with a 1:2000 dilution of the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated for 1 h with a Cy5-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and Texas Red phalloidin (Molecular Probes). The cells were mounted using Prolong (Molecular Probes). Immunofluorescent staining as well as direct fluorescence of GFP was visualized using a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope. Cy5 and Texas Red staining were detected using the following sets of filters: Cy5 (excitation 640/30 nm; emission 690/50 nm); Texas Red (excitation 565/30 nm; emission 620/60 nm). We have previously shown that truncation of the NH2-terminal region of AKAP-Lbc can significantly increase its basal Rho-GEF activity in the absence of external activating stimuli (9Diviani D. Soderling J. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44247-44257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 27Baisamy L. Jurisch N. Diviani D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15405-15412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This suggested that inhibitory determinants located in the NH2-terminal sequence of AKAP-Lbc maintain the Rho-GEF activity of the anchoring protein low under basal conditions. To identify potential regulatory proteins interacting with this inhibitory region, a fragment of AKAP-Lbc encompassing residues 1–503 (Fig. 1A) was used as bait to screen a human heart cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid system. Two independent positive clones encoding the ubiquitin-like protein LC3 (isoform A) were identified from 4 × 106 cotransformants, as assessed by their ability to grow in the absence of histidine and to produce β-galactosidase. To confirm these interactions, the L40 yeast strain was transformed with the bait plasmid expressing the 1–503 fragment of AKAP-Lbc (AKAP-Lbc-(1–503)-pLexA) in combination with either the pACT2 vector containing the LC3 cDNA (LC3-pACT2) or with the empty pACT2 vector. As shown in Fig. 1B, yeasts transformed with the LC3-pACT2 construct were able to grow in the absence of histidine (top) and to produce β-galactosidase (bottom), whereas those transformed with the empty pACT2 vector did not. To assess whether the association between LC3 and AKAP-Lbc occurs through a direct interaction or whether it is mediated through another protein, we monitored the ability of six purified GST-tagged AKAP-Lbc fragments encompassing residues 1–503, 504–1000, 1001–1387, 1388–1922, 1923–2336, and 2337–2817 to associate with purified His6-tagged LC3 using an in vitro pull-down assay. Interestingly, our results indicate that LC3 can directly bind the AKAP-Lbc fragments 1–503 (Fig. 1C, top, lane 3) but also reveal a second interaction with the AKAP-Lbc fragment encompassing residues 1388–1922 (Fig. 1C, top, lane 6). Control experiments showed that the six AKAP-Lbc fragments used in this study did not interact with an unrelated His6-tagged protein (His6-Rac1) (results not shown). These results strongly suggest that the LC3 can directly interact with AKAP-Lbc through two distinct binding domains. To determine whether LC3 can associate with the full-length AKAP-Lbc inside cells, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments from HEK293 cells that were transiently transfected with the empty FLAG vector or the FLAG-tagged AKAP-Lbc in combination with GFP or GFP-LC3 (Fig. 2A). After immunoprecipitating the anchoring protein using anti-FLAG antibodies, anti-GFP antibodies were used to immunoblot the immunoprecipitated samples. The Western blots revealed that GFP-LC3 could specifically co-immunoprecipitate with AKAP-Lbc, whereas no bands were immunoprecipitated from cells expressing GFP-LC3 or FLAG-AKAP-Lbc alone (Fig. 2A, top). In a similar set of experiments, we determined whether AKAP-Lbc and LC3 endogenously expressed in HEK293 cells could form a complex. As shown in Fig. 2B, endogenous LC3 could be specifically co-immunoprecipitated with AKAP-Lbc, whereas no bands were detected in control immunoprecipitations (Fig. 2B, top). Collectively, these findings strongly suggest that AKAP-Lbc and LC3 form stable complexes inside cells. To identify the two binding sites for LC3 on AKAP-Lbc, we generated two sets of five consecutive GFP-tagged AKAP-Lbc fragments encompassing regions between residues 1 and 503 and residues 1388 and 1922, respectively (supplemental Fig. S1A). The fragments were expressed in combination with FLAG-tagged LC3 in HEK293 cells, and interactions were assessed by coimmunoprecipitation. FLAG-LC3 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using anti-FLAG antibodies, and the presence of associated GFP fragments was detected using anti-GFP antibodies. Our results indicate that the two LC3-binding sites reside within fragments encompassing residues 301–400 and 1388–1493 of AKAP-Lbc (supplemental Fig. S1, B (top, lane 6) and C (top, lane 2)). We have subsequently further narrowed the two LC3-binding sites using shorter GFP-tagged AKAP-Lbc fragments derived from regions 301–400 and 1388–1493 (Fig. 3, A and C). This allowed us to restrict the first LC3-binding site to residues 301–360 (Fig. 3B, top) and the second binding site to residues 1450–1470 (Fig. 3D, top). These experiments indicate that LC3 associates with AKAP-Lbc with molecular determinants that are included in two distinct regions of the AKAP-Lbc molecule. To determine the affinity of LC3 for these two sites, we performed in vitro pull-down experiments by incubating increasing concentrations of purified His6-tagged LC3 ranging from 0.1 nm to 10 μm with various GST-tagged AKAP-Lbc fragments encompassing the LC3 binding domains. Binding of His6-LC3 was a"

Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is the prototypic growth factor for VSMCs and plays a key role in vascular remodeling. Here, we sought to further define ESDN function in primary human VSMCs. ESDN down-regulation by RNA interference significantly enhanced PDGF-induced VSMC DNA synthesis and migration. This was associated with increased ERK1/2, Src, and PDGF receptor (PDGFR)beta phosphorylation, without altering total PDGFRbeta expression levels. In binding assays, ESDN down-regulation significantly increased (125)I-PDGF maximum binding (B(max)) to PDGF receptors on VSMCs without altering the binding constant (K(d)), raising the possibility that ESDN regulates PDGFR processing. ESDN down-regulation significantly reduced ligand-induced PDGFRbeta ubiquitination. This was associated with a significant reduction in the expression level of c-Cbl, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinylates PDGFRbeta. Thus, ESDN modulates PDGF signaling in VSMCs via regulation of PDGFR surface levels. The ESDN effect is mediated, at least in part, through effects on PDGFRbeta ubiquitination. ESDN may serve as a target for regulating PDGFRbeta signaling in VSMCs."
https://openalex.org/W2083651192,"LC8 functions as a dimer crucial for a variety of molecular motors and non-motor complexes. Emerging models, founded on structural studies, suggest that the LC8 dimer promotes the stability and refolding of dimeric target proteins in molecular complexes, and its interactions with selective target proteins, including dynein subunits, is regulated by LC8 phosphorylation, which is proposed to prevent LC8 dimerization. To test these hypotheses in vivo, we determine the impacts of two new LC8 mutations on the assembly and stability of defined LC8-containing complexes in Chlamydomonas flagella. The three types of dyneins and the radial spoke are disparately affected by dimeric LC8 with a C-terminal extension. The defects include the absence of specific subunits, complex instability, and reduced incorporation into the axonemal super complex. Surprisingly, a phosphomimetic LC8 mutation, which is largely monomeric in vitro, is still dimeric in vivo and does not significantly change flagellar generation and motility. The differential defects in these flagellar complexes support the structural model and indicate that modulation of target proteins by LC8 leads to the proper assembly of complexes and ultimately higher level complexes. Furthermore, the ability of flagellar complexes to incorporate the phosphomimetic LC8 protein and the modest defects observed in the phosphomimetic LC8 mutant suggest that LC8 phosphorylation is not an effective mechanism for regulating molecular complexes.

In particular, the amorph mutant is embryonic lethal because of apoptotic death, consistent with the discovery that LC8 helps to sequester the pro-death apoptotic factor Bim (9Puthalakath H.

Open table in a new tab Despite its significance, the function and regulation of LC8 are only partially understood. LC8 functions as a dimer with two identical binding sites for the target proteins (10Benashski S.E. Harrison A. Patel-King R.S. King S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20929-20935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 11Liang J. Jaffrey S.R. Guo W. Snyder S.H. Clardy J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). One model postulates that the dimer tethers dynein motors to various cargoes (12Fan J. Zhang Q. Tochio H. Li M. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, in some systems, the role of LC8 is unrelated to dynein motors (1Pfister K.K. Shah P.R. Hummerich H. Russ A. Cotton J. Annuar A.A. King S.M. Fisher E.M. PLoS Genet. 2006; 2: e1Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 13Ghosh-Roy A. Desai B.S. Ray K. Mol. Biol.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7229-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Another emerging model, founded upon structural analyses, contends that the bivalent structure of the LC8 dimer increases the stability (15Williams J.C. Roulhac P.L. Roy A.G. Vallee R.B. Fitzgerald M.C. Hendrickson W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 10028-10033Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and promotes the refolding of the scaffold proteins in the complex (16Barbar E. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).Additional data indicate that LC8 is regulated by phosphorylation (17Vadlamudi R.K. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Yang Z. Balasenthil S. Nguyen D. Sahin A.A. den Hollander P. Kumar R. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 18Song Y. Benison G. Nyarko A.

Chem. 2008; 283: 4004-4013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The C-terminal Ser88 residue is phosphorylated in tumor cells, and the phosphorylation may promote cell survival by release and subsequent degradation of Bim (17Vadlamudi R.K. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Yang Z. Balasenthil S. Nguyen D. Sahin A.A. den Hollander P. Kumar R. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, a phosphomimetic LC8S88E mutant protein is predominantly monomeric in vitro and cannot bind to Bim or the target peptide from IC74 of cytoplasmic dynein (18Song Y. Benison G. Nyarko A. Hays T.S. Barbar E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17272-17279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 19Song C. Wen W. Rayala S.K. Chen M. Ma J. Zhang M. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4004-4013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, LC8S88E does bind to peptides of Swallow, a target protein in the Drosophila oocyte (18Song Y. Benison G. Nyarko A. Hays T.S. Barbar E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17272-17279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It was postulated that Swallow peptides have a stronger affinity for LC8 and bind to the small dimeric pool of LC8S88E, reversing the monomeric shift, and that LC8 phosphorylation is a selective regulatory mechanism. These observations raise a critical question about LC8 phosphorylation as a regulatory mechanism. How can phosphorylated LC8 promote cell survival while failing to bind vital target proteins, such as intermediate chains in cytoplasmic dynein? Testing these models for functional and regulatory mechanisms ultimately requires in vivo analyses.In this study, we characterize the Chlamydomonas mutant pf5 (20Huang B. Piperno G. Ramanis Z. Luck D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 88: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The PF5 gene product was implicated in integrating the assembly and function of axonemes because in addition to an RS deficiency and the lack of two minor RS proteins, RSP13 and RSP15, pf5 axonemes also lack a small protein and an ∼110-kDa polypeptide of the inner dynein arms. The RS is part of a system that controls the activation of axonemal dynein motors. We discovered that the intriguing phenotype of pf5 is actually caused by a mutation in the LC8 gene FLA14. This new mutant, expressing LC8 with a C-terminal extension (LC8CT), and an additional LC8 phosphomimetic mutant (LC8S90E) were used for analyses of the assembly and stability of the defined LC8-containing dyneins and the RS complexes in the Chlamydomonas flagellum (Table 1). Comparison of the phenotypes from these two new mutants and the LC8 null mutant (6Pazour G.J. Wilkerson C.G. Witman G.B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 979-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) strongly support the predicted structural role of LC8 on target proteins to promote the stability and assembly of individual complexes at various levels. Furthermore, our results suggests that this function and molecular complexes are not significantly altered by LC8 phosphorylation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Culture ConditionsThe following Chlamydomonas strains were used in this study: CC124 (WT mt−), CC1331 (pf5 mt−), and CC3937 (fla14-1 mt+). All strains were obtained from the Chlamydomonas Center (St. Paul, MN) and were cultured as described (21Yang C. Owen H.A. Yang P. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 403-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22Harris H.H. Chlamydomonas Source Book.in: Harris E.H. 2nd Ed. Vol. 1. Elsevier Inc., Oxford, UK2009: 242-259Google Scholar) unless indicated otherwise.The fla14-1 strain was used for transformations with LC8 constructs (described below; see Table 1). Transformants used for this study include fla14-LC8, fla14-LC8CT, fla14-LC8S90A, and fla14-LC8S90E (transformed with WT LC8, LC8CT, LC8S90A, and LC8S90E constructs, respectively).Molecular Biology, LC8 Genomic ConstructsThe paromomycin resistance cassette was amplified from the pSI103 vector (21Yang C. Owen H.A. Yang P. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 403-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and blunt-end cloned into the pBluescript vector at the SmaI site to generate the pPMM plasmid. Subsequently, LC8 genomic fragments, containing 0.55 and 1 kb of 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences (23Lechtreck K.F. Witman G.B. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and the LC8 coding region, were PCR-amplified from WT and CC1331 genomic DNA. The PCR products were cloned into the XhoI site in pPMM to generate pPMM-LC8 and pPMM-LC8CT plasmids.For the LC8S90E phosphomimetic construct, PCR mutagenesis was performed to mutate the Ser90 codon (TCG) to a glutamate codon (GAA) using a primer containing the mutated sequence and a nearby BssHII restriction sequence. The PCR product was used to replace the equivalent fragment in the pPMM-LC8 plasmid to generate the pPMM-LC8S90E plasmid. For the LC8S90A construct, PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuickChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).Expression of His-tagged Recombinant ProteinsLC8 coding sequences were PCR-amplified and cloned into the NdeI and EcoRI sites of pET28(a) vector. The constructs were transformed into BL21(DE3) for expression as described (21Yang C. Owen H.A. Yang P. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 403-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). All constructs were confirmed by restriction digest and sequencing.GeneticsTransformation rescue and genetic crosses were performed as described (21Yang C. Owen H.A. Yang P. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 403-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22Harris H.H. Chlamydomonas Source Book.in: Harris E.H. 2nd Ed. Vol. 1. Elsevier Inc., Oxford, UK2009: 242-259Google Scholar). The experiments in which fla14-1 was transformed with WT and mutant LC8 constructs allow for a direct comparison of the impacts of the LC8 mutations in an identical genetic background.BiochemistryAxoneme IsolationAxoneme isolation, high salt extractions at 5 mg/ml and velocity sedimentation were carried out as described (21Yang C. Owen H.A. Yang P. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 403-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).Analytical Gel Filtration ChromatographyPurified, recombinant LC8 proteins were dialyzed in 50 mm phosphate/citrate buffer, pH 3 or pH 7, for 24 h. 100-μl aliquots of 50 μm protein were fractionated on a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column with the dialysis buffer at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min powered by an AKTA FPLC system.Chemical Cross-linkingIsolated axonemes were treated with 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (Pierce) at a series of concentrations as described (10Benashski S.E. Harrison A. Patel-King R.S. King S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20929-20935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). After treatment, the axonemes were fixed for SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blots.AntibodiesAntibodies were used in Western blots at 1:5000 dilutions to detect the following axonemal structures: for LC8 and the ODA, LC8 and IC78 (Dr. S. M. King, University of Connecticut Health Center) and IC69 (Dr. D. R. Mitchell, SUNY State Medical School); for I1 dynein, IC140, IC138, and IC97 (Dr. W. S. Sale, Emory University); for single-headed IDAs, p28 (Dr. G. Piperno, Mount Sinai Medical School); for the retrograde IFT motor CD1b, DLIC (Dr. M. E. Porter, University of Minnesota); and for the RS, RSP1 and RSP3 (Drs. D. R. Diener; J. L. Rosenbaum, Yale University) and RSP8, RSP11, and RSP16 (24Yang P. Diener D.R. Yang C. Kohno T. Pazour G.J. Dienes J.M. Agrin N.S. King S.M. Sale W.S. Kamiya R. Rosenbaum J.L. Witman G.B. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 1165-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar).Light MicroscopyBright field light microscopy for motility assessment, imaging, and statistics was carried out as described (21Yang C. Owen H.A. Yang P. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 403-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For flagellar length measurement, cells were fixed in 50% Lugol solution (Sigma). Images were magnified ×2 optically and further enlarged ×6 digitally. Flagella were traced on the monitor with a cotton thread, and the length was measured by a ruler. The measurement was converted to actual length by comparison with an image of a micrometer taken in parallel.DISCUSSIONThe major challenges in understanding LC8 function are the severe pleiotropic phenotypes of the previously described LC8 mutants and the lack of in vivo context in the simplified in vitro systems. These constraints are overcome by the two new LC8 mutants and the Chlamydomonas experimental system with defined LC8-containing complexes. The key results are that phosphomimetic LC8S90E, although monomeric in vitro, is a dimer in vivo and only causes minor defects. In contrast, dimeric LC8CT results in disparate assembly deficiencies and the dissociation of complexes that are otherwise rather stable. These results support the proposed structural role of LC8 in forming a core scaffold (15Williams J.C. Roulhac P.L. Roy A.G. Vallee R.B. Fitzgerald M.C. Hendrickson W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 10028-10033Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Barbar E. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and shed new light on the regulation and ultimate function of LC8.LC8 Promotes the Formation of the Retrograde IFT Motor for the Generation of Full-length FlagellaBecause the transient short flagella of fla14-1 lack retrograde IFT and the responsible motor CD1b, it was postulated that retrograde IFT recycled the IFT machinery for flagellar generation and maintenance, and thus fla14 generated short flagella that resorb prematurely because of depleted IFT rafts (6Pazour G.J. Wilkerson C.G. Witman G.B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 979-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Yet defects in multiple axonemal complexes in fla14-1 could result in short flagella (29LeDizet M. Piperno G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 697-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The IFT deficiency model was confirmed by fla14-3 (LC8CT strain) that also displayed a similar length phenotype but milder axonemal defects that are insufficient to affect flagellar length. Interestingly, the amount of DLIC appears normal in LC8CT flagella (Fig. 1B) indicating thatthe retrograde IFT motor can enter flagella, but its function is still impaired. Importantly, the defects in the IFT motor and axonemal complexes appear independent.LC8 Directly Promotes the Proper Assembly of Individual Complexes at Multiple LevelsOne theory proposes that numerous LC8 target proteins are the cargoes of dynein motors and that the bivalent LC8 dimers adhere the motors and the cargoes together. This idea is consistent with the deficiencies of the LC8 null flagella in which the retrograde IFT motor, CD1b, is absent and its putative axonemal cargoes are reduced or absent. However, defective motor-cargo coupling cannot explain the defects in LC8CT-containing flagella in which retrograde IFT is dysfunctional, although the ODA appears largely normal; the RS is unstable (Fig. 5B) and poorly incorporated into axonemes, and I1 is only missing a single subunit (20Huang B. Piperno G. Ramanis Z. Luck D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 88: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), and it dissociates upon extraction (Fig. 5A). Such disparate structural deficiencies in the four flagellar complexes are indicative of individual assembly defects and strongly suggest that LC8, normal or mutated, is in a critical position in each flagellar complex to directly affect the assembly unique to each complex.These deficiencies can be partially explained by the model that the LC8 dimer stabilizes or refolds dimeric scaffold molecules in molecular complexes (15Williams J.C. Roulhac P.L. Roy A.G. Vallee R.B. Fitzgerald M.C. Hendrickson W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 10028-10033Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 16Barbar E. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the LC8 dimer associates with putative scaffold proteins, such as WD-repeat ICs in dyneins (30DiBella L.M. Gorbatyuk O. Sakato M. Wakabayashi K. Patel-King R.S. Pazour G.J. Witman G.B. King S.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5661-5674Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6, left) and unknown proteins in the RS. This binding can enhance the stability of dimeric scaffold proteins and transform the flanking disordered regions into a conformation that favors the association with additional molecules, such as IC97 in I1, the LCs in the ODA (Fig. 4), RSP13/15 in the RS (20Huang B. Piperno G. Ramanis Z. Luck D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 88: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), IFT particle proteins in the case of CD1b, or docking proteins responsible for anchoring axonemal complexes. Thus, through modulation of target proteins, LC8 promotes the assembly of various complexes and higher level complexes. When LC8 is mutated, such as LC8CT, the additional sequence (Fig. 6, right, red triangles) at the dimeric interface may act as a wedge that alters the dimeric conformation or creates steric hindrance, consequently reducing the stability of the complex and interfering with further interactions.As instrumental and important as LC8 is, it is critical to attribute its contribution objectively to understand the grander scheme of molecular assembly. Contrary to the prediction (33Wang W. Lo K.W. Kan H.M. Fan J.S. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41491-41499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), LC8 is not necessary for initiating assembly and may not be involved in the initiation process at all. Studies of fla14-1 showed that without LC8, flagellar LC8 complexes actually assemble, although the process is defective at different steps for each complex. For example, the subunits of CD1b are dispersed in the cell body of a DLIC mutant (25Hou Y. Pazour G.J. Witman G.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4382-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 27Perrone C.A. Tritschler D. Taulman P. Bower R. Yoder B.K. Porter M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 2041-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 34Rompolas P. Pedersen L.B. Patel-King R.S. King S.M. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3653-3665Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), indicating that this subunit is essential for assembly of the retrograde IFT motor. In contrast, in WT and the LC8 null mutant (fla14-1), the other subunits of CD1b are concentrated around the peri-basal body region. Thus, in the absence of LC8, the retrograde IFT motor is assembled into a defective complex that cannot enter flagella. In the case of the RS, the precursor RS complex enters flagella (26Qin H. Diener D.R. Geimer S. Cole D.G. Rosenbaum J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) but cannot be incorporated into axonemes, resulting in the absence of RS structures in fla14-1 axonemes. I1 is assembled in fla14-1 axonemes, although it is less abundant (6Pazour G.J. Wilkerson C.G. Witman G.B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 979-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Thus, the modulation of target proteins by LC8 is to correctly promote further assembly rather than to initiate the assembly of complexes.The unique subunits in I1 also caution the strict interpretation that LC8 target proteins only function as molecular scaffolds (16Barbar E. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The actual target proteins of LC8 in I1 have not been determined. However, neither IC138, a candidate scaffold molecule with WD repeats, nor IC97, which is most sensitive to the LC8 mutations, is required for I1 assembly (31Wirschell M. Yang C. Yang P. Fox L. Yanagisawa H.A. Kamiya R. Witman G.B. Porter M.E. Sale W.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 3044-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 35Bower R. Vanderwaal K. O'Toole E. Fox L. Perrone C. Mueller J. Wirschell M. Kamiya R. Sale W.S. Porter M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 3055-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Instead, both are implicated in phosphoregulation of I1 (31Wirschell M. Yang C. Yang P. Fox L. Yanagisawa H.A. Kamiya R. Witman G.B. Porter M.E. Sale W.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 3044-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 35Bower R. Vanderwaal K. O'Toole E. Fox L. Perrone C. Mueller J. Wirschell M. Kamiya R. Sale W.S. Porter M.E. Mol. Biol.

Cell. 2004; 15: 5431-5442Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These unique subunits explain the less severe defects of I1 in fla14-1 and demonstrate the varied roles of LC8 target proteins.Differential Accommodation of Mutated LC8The scaffold model portrays LC8 actively refolding target proteins (16Barbar E. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This study shows the individual ability of each flagellar complex to accommodate the modified LC8 molecules. For example, the ODA accommodates LC8CT better than LC8S90E, whereas the other complexes accommodate LC8S90E better than LC8CT.Two possibilities can explain these differences. Despite a common LC8-binding motif (37Lo K.W. Kan H.M. Chan L.N. Xu W.G. Wang K.P. Wu Z. Sheng M. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8172-8179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 38Rodríguez-Crespo I. Yélamos B. Roncal F. Albar J.P. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Gavilanes F. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the actual LC8-binding sequences are longer and rather diverged (11Liang J. Jaffrey S.R. Guo W. Snyder S.H. Clardy J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and may have different affinity for mutated LC8 proteins. Furthermore, the molecular context of each LC8 complex, which cannot be tested in vitro, may influence how severe a particular complex will be affected by each LC8 mutation. For example, it was postulated that five tightly packed LC8 dimers promote the folding of the dimeric scaffold proteins in the yeast nuclear pore complex (2Stelter P. Kunze R. Flemming D. Höpfner D. Diepholz M. Philippsen P. Böttcher B. Hurt E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 788-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Similarly, two LC8-binding sites are immediately adjacent to each other in the WD repeat subunit of CD1b (34Rompolas P. Pedersen L.B. Patel-King R.S. King S.M. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3653-3665Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) that is particularly sensitive to LC8CT. It is conceivable that multiple tightly packed LC8CT dimers with additional tails will amplify the impact on the target proteins and complexes.In contrast, the target proteins and neighboring subunits of each complex, which are also involved in assembly of the scaffold (15Williams J.C. Roulhac P.L. Roy A.G. Vallee R.B. Fitzgerald M.C. Hendrickson W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 10028-10033Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 30DiBella L.M. Gorbatyuk O. Sakato M. Wakabayashi K. Patel-King R.S. Pazour G.J. Witman G.B. King S.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5661-5674Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 39Lo K.W. Kan H.M. Pfister K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9552-9559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), may contribute to the ability of each complex in accommodating a particular LC8 mutation, particularly the phosphomimetic LC8 that is inherently monomeric in vitro (Fig. 3), thus reducing or eliminating the impact of modified LC8.Limited Effects of LC8 PhosphoregulationIt has been proposed that LC8 phosphorylation is a selective regulatory mechanism (18Song Y. Benison G. Nyarko A. Hays T.S. Barbar E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17272-17279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The subtle phenotype in the LC8S90E phosphomimetic mutants suggests that the phospho-regulation is more restricted than anticipated. One idea is that LC8 phosphorylation induces a monomeric shift that preferentially interferes with the binding of lower affinitive target proteins, such as the intermediate chain target peptides from Drosophila dynein (18Song Y. Benison G. Nyarko A. Hays T.S. Barbar E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17272-17279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Consistently, the ODA and I1 in Chlamydomonas flagellar are abnormal (this study). However, the important differences are that the flagellar dyneins incorporate LC8S90E as dimers (Fig. 4B), and the defects are insufficient to cause obvious functional deficiencies in Chlamydomonas flagella in standard laboratory growth conditions (Fig. 4A). Although the phosphomimetic mutation is not identical to phosphorylation, these modest effects from LC8S90E raise doubts on the effectiveness of LC8 phosphorylation in regulating flagellar functions and molecular complexes in general. In fact, to date, we have not been able to identify phosphorylated LC8 in Chlamydomonas flagella (data not shown). The strains with LC8S90A that cannot be phosphorylated appear normal as well. This tolerance of phosphorylated LC8 by most complexes could be advantageous such that phosphorylated LC8 could primarily affect a small number of target proteins, like apoptotic factor, to promote cell survival (17Vadlamudi R.K.

The deficiency of S90E flagella became more severe under dimmer light and warmer growth condition that even challenges WT (Fig. 4D) but is not unusual in natural habitats. Yet it is under this condition that the difference between WT and the phosphomimetic mutant becomes evident. Perhaps the phosphomimetic LC8 is less effective in promoting assembly. The inefficiency is masked under ideal laboratory conditions but becomes apparent in challenging situations in which myriads of cellular reactions, such as protein synthesis, are critically reduced. As shown in a structural study, the hydroxyl group of Ser88 at the interface may contribute a hydrogen bond (18Song Y. Benison G. Nyarko A. Hays T.S. Barbar E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17272-17279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) that favors the dimerization to effectively promote the proper assembly of molecular complexes under diverse conditions.As small as LC8 is, it has been assigned an accolade of titles. By taking advantage of Chlamydomonas mutants and the well characterized LC8-containing flagellar complexes, this study has provided the critical in vivo evidence and the molecular context to substantiate the structural model for LC8 function, further revealing the ultimate function for LC8 in fostering the proper assembly of flagellar complexes and the limit of postulated phosphoregulation. These conclusions are likely applicable to diverse complexes as well as higher level complexes that contain LC8 in other systems (40Delanoue R. Herpers B. Soetaert J. Davis I. Rabouille C. Dev.

IntroductionLC8 is an important component of vital complexes such as cytoplasmic dynein, myosin V, neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (1Pfister K.K. Shah P.R. Hummerich H. Russ A. Cotton J. Annuar A.A. King S.M. Fisher E.M. PLoS Genet. 2006; 2: e1Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and the nuclear pore complex (2Stelter P. Kunze R. Flemming D. Höpfner D. Diepholz M. Philippsen P.

In Chlamydomonas flagella, LC8 is found in three types of dynein motors (the outer dynein arm (ODA), 3The abbreviations used are: ODAouter dynein armsRSradial spokesDLICdynein light intermediate chainIDAinner dynein armsIFTintraflagellar transportPMMparomomycinWTwild type. the inner dynein arm (IDA) called the I1 dynein, and the cytoplasmic dynein motor CD1b for intraflagellar transport (IFT)) and in the radial spoke (RS) (3Piperno G.

Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1966-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In particular, the amorph mutant is embryonic lethal because of apoptotic death, consistent with the discovery that LC8 helps to sequester the pro-death apoptotic factor Bim (9Puthalakath H.

Open table in a new tab Despite its significance, the function and regulation of LC8 are only partially understood. LC8 functions as a dimer with two identical binding sites for the target proteins (10Benashski S.E. Harrison A. Patel-King R.S. King S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20929-20935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 11Liang J. Jaffrey S.R. Guo W. Snyder S.H. Clardy J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). One model postulates that the dimer tethers dynein motors to various cargoes (12Fan J. Zhang Q. Tochio H. Li M. Zhang M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, in some systems, the role of LC8 is unrelated to dynein motors (1Pfister K.K. Shah P.R. Hummerich H. Russ A. Cotton J. Annuar A.A. King S.M. Fisher E.M. PLoS Genet. 2006; 2: e1Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 13Ghosh-Roy A. Desai B.S. Ray K. Mol. Biol.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 7229-7234Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Another emerging model, founded upon structural analyses, contends that the bivalent structure of the LC8 dimer increases the stability (15Williams J.C. Roulhac P.L. Roy A.G. Vallee R.B. Fitzgerald M.C. Hendrickson W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 10028-10033Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and promotes the refolding of the scaffold proteins in the complex (16Barbar E. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).Additional data indicate that LC8 is regulated by phosphorylation (17Vadlamudi R.K. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Yang Z. Balasenthil S. Nguyen D. Sahin A.A. den Hollander P. Kumar R. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 18Song Y. Benison G. Nyarko A.

Chem. 2008; 283: 4004-4013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The C-terminal Ser88 residue is phosphorylated in tumor cells, and the phosphorylation may promote cell survival by release and subsequent degradation of Bim (17Vadlamudi R.K. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Yang Z. Balasenthil S. Nguyen D. Sahin A.A. den Hollander P. Kumar R. Cancer Cell. 2004; 5: 575-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, a phosphomimetic LC8S88E mutant protein is predominantly monomeric in vitro and cannot bind to Bim or the target peptide from IC74 of cytoplasmic dynein (18Song Y. Benison G. Nyarko A. Hays T.S. Barbar E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17272-17279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 19Song C. Wen W. Rayala S.K. Chen M. Ma J. Zhang M. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 4004-4013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, LC8S88E does bind to peptides of Swallow, a target protein in the Drosophila oocyte (18Song Y. Benison G. Nyarko A. Hays T.S. Barbar E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17272-17279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It was postulated that Swallow peptides have a stronger affinity for LC8 and bind to the small dimeric pool of LC8S88E, reversing the monomeric shift, and that LC8 phosphorylation is a selective regulatory mechanism. These observations raise a critical question about LC8 phosphorylation as a regulatory mechanism. How can phosphorylated LC8 promote cell survival while failing to bind vital target proteins, such as intermediate chains in cytoplasmic dynein? Testing these models for functional and regulatory mechanisms ultimately requires in vivo analyses.In this study, we characterize the Chlamydomonas mutant pf5 (20Huang B. Piperno G. Ramanis Z. Luck D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 88: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The PF5 gene product was implicated in integrating the assembly and function of axonemes because in addition to an RS deficiency and the lack of two minor RS proteins, RSP13 and RSP15, pf5 axonemes also lack a small protein and an ∼110-kDa polypeptide of the inner dynein arms. The RS is part of a system that controls the activation of axonemal dynein motors. We discovered that the intriguing phenotype of pf5 is actually caused by a mutation in the LC8 gene FLA14. This new mutant, expressing LC8 with a C-terminal extension (LC8CT), and an additional LC8 phosphomimetic mutant (LC8S90E) were used for analyses of the assembly and stability of the defined LC8-containing dyneins and the RS complexes in the Chlamydomonas flagellum (Table 1). Comparison of the phenotypes from these two new mutants and the LC8 null mutant (6Pazour G.J. Wilkerson C.G. Witman G.B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 979-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) strongly support the predicted structural role of LC8 on target proteins to promote the stability and assembly of individual complexes at various levels. Furthermore, our results suggests that this function and molecular complexes are not significantly altered by LC8 phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2138493658,"Studies of animal communication systems have revealed that the perception of a salient signal can cause large-scale changes in brain gene expression, but little is known about how communication affects the neurogenomic state of the sender. We explored this issue by studying honey bees that produce a vibratory modulatory signal. We chose this system because it represents an extreme case of animal communication; some bees perform this behavior intensively, effectively acting as communication specialists. We show large differences in patterns of brain gene expression between individuals producing vibratory signal as compared with carefully matched non-senders. Some of the differentially regulated genes have previously been implicated in the performance of other motor activities, including courtship behavior in Drosophila melanogaster and Parkinson's Disease in humans. Our results demonstrate for the first time a neurogenomic brain state associated with sending a communication signal and provide suggestive glimpses of molecular roots for motor control."

https://openalex.org/W2108486598,"The widely used atypical antipsychotic clozapine is a potent competitive antagonist at 5-HT3 receptors which may contribute to its unique psychopharmacological profile. Clozapine binds to 5-HT3 receptors of various species. However, the structural requirements of the respective binding site for clozapine remain to be determined. Differences in the primary sequences within the 5-HT3A receptor gene in schizophrenic patients may result in an alteration of the antipsychotic potency and/or the side effect profile of clozapine. To determine these structural requirements we constructed chimeras with different 5-HT3A receptor sequences of murine and human origin and expressed these mutants in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Clozapine antagonises recombinant mouse 5-HT3A receptors with higher potency compared to recombinant human 5-HT3A receptors. 5-HT activation curves and clozapine inhibition curves yielded the parameters EC50 and IC50 for all receptors tested in the range of 0.6–2.7 µM and 1.5–83.3 nM, respectively. The use of the Cheng-Prusoff equation to calculate the dissociation constant Kb values for clozapine revealed that an extracellular sequence (length 86 aa) close to the transmembrane domain M1 strongly determines the binding affinity of clozapine. Kb values of clozapine were significantly lower (0.3–1.1 nM) for receptors containing the murine sequence and higher when compared with receptors containing the respective human sequence (5.8–13.4 nM). Thus, individual differences in the primary sequence of 5-HT3 receptors may be crucial for the antipsychotic potency and/or the side effect profile of clozapine."
https://openalex.org/W1998273958,"Post-mitotic reassembly of nuclear envelope (NE) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has been reconstituted in a cell-free system based on interphase Xenopus egg extract. To evaluate the relative contributions of cytosolic and transmembrane proteins in NE and ER assembly, we replaced a part of native membrane vesicles with ones either functionally impaired by trypsin or N-ethylmaleimide treatments or with protein-free liposomes. Although neither impaired membrane vesicles nor liposomes formed ER and nuclear membrane, they both supported assembly reactions by fusing with native membrane vesicles. At membrane concentrations insufficient to generate full-sized functional nuclei, addition of liposomes and their fusion with membrane vesicles resulted in an extensive expansion of NE, further chromatin decondensation, restoration of the functionality, and spatial distribution of the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), and, absent newly delivered transmembrane proteins, an increase in NPC numbers. This rescue of the nuclear assembly by liposomes was inhibited by wheat germ agglutinin and thus required active nuclear transport, similarly to the assembly of full-sized functional NE with membrane vesicles. Mechanism of fusion between liposomes and between liposomes and membrane vesicles was investigated using lipid mixing assay. This fusion required interphase cytosol and, like fusion between native membrane vesicles, was inhibited by guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein, and N-ethylmaleimide. Our findings suggest that interphase cytosol contains proteins that mediate the fusion stage of ER and NE reassembly, emphasize an unexpected tolerance of nucleus assembly to changes in concentrations of transmembrane proteins, and reveal the existence of a feedback mechanism that couples NE expansion with NPC assembly.

On the other hand, membrane targeting to the chromatin and GTP-dependent lipid mixing at the chromatin surface at the early stages of NE assembly do not require transmembrane proteins as demonstrated in an in vitro system in which MVs were replaced by phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposomes with associated cytosolic proteins (29Ramos C. Rafikova E.R. Melikov K. Chernomordik L.V. Biochem. J. 2006; 400: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In this study of ER and NE assembly in the Xenopus egg reconstitution system, we explored the relative contributions of cytosolic proteins (defined here as proteins that are present either only in cytosol or both in cytosol and, as peripheral proteins, at the membranes) and exclusively membrane-residing (MR) proteins, such as transmembrane proteins. To identify the functions that do not require MR proteins to be present on each of the membranes involved, we replaced some of the MVs with MVs functionally impaired by trypsin or N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) treatments or with protein-free PC liposomes. We found that functionally impaired MVs and liposomes in the presence of interphase but not mitotic cytosol undergo fusion with each other and native MVs and participate in the formation of the tubular ER network. Like fusion between native MVs, this cytosol-dependent fusion involving membranes without functional MR proteins was inhibited by nonhydrolyzable forms of GTP, by NEM pretreatment of cytosol, and by addition of soluble NSF-attachment protein (α-SNAP), an inhibitor of SNARE machinery (14Baur T. Ramadan K. Schlundt A. Kartenbeck J. Meyer H.H. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2895-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 30Barszczewski M. Chua J.J. Stein A. Winter U. Heintzmann R. Zilly F.E. Fasshauer D. Lang T. Jahn R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 776-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In NE assembly, vesicle-liposome fusion allowed us to add membrane material without adding transmembrane proteins. Co-incubation of interphase cytosol and chromatin with MVs in concentrations lowered relative to the standard MV concentrations in the NE assembly reconstitution system resulted in formation of nuclei that were smaller than the control ones, had a decreased number of NPCs, and failed to actively replicate DNA and import substrates. Addition of functionally impaired MVs or liposomes to the reaction mixture and their cytosol-dependent fusion to native MVs compensated for the shortage of membrane material and increased the sizes of the nuclei. Furthermore, the liposome-rescued nuclei appeared similar to the control ones in ultrastructure, active nuclear transport, and DNA replication. The recovery required nuclear transport and involved an increase in the number of functional NPCs. Thus, although MR proteins at MVs were required for generating the characteristic morphology of the branched ER network and of fully extended and functional NE, cytosol conferred on liposomes the ability to fuse and, in the presence of native MVs, to participate in formation of ER and NE. In contrast to nuclei formed at a lowered concentration of MVs, liposome-rescued nuclei with most of the membrane material provided by liposomes had normal function and spatial distribution of NPC. Our findings emphasize the mutual dependence of NPC assembly and NE expansion and suggest that interphase cytosol contains proteins that mediate the fusion stage of the envelope growth. All lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. Lipid stocks were dissolved in benzol/methanol mixture (95:5, v/v) and stored at −20 °C under argon. To prepare unilamellar liposomes from dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC), from DOPC and rhodamine-dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (Rd-DOPE) (95:5 mol %), or from DOPC and 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1, 3-diazole-dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (NBD-DOPE) (99:1 mol %) corresponding lipids were mixed and rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Solvents were removed under vacuum overnight. Resulting lipid powder was dissolved in a membrane wash buffer (MWB): 250 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml. Lipid suspension was extruded through double-stacked 100-nm filters (GE Water and Process Technologies) using Lipex extruder (Northern Lipids Inc., Canada). DOPC/NBD-DOPE liposomes with encapsulated dextran were prepared as above, except dried lipids were dissolved in 50 mm Hepes, 100 mm KCl, pH 7.4 buffer, containing 1 mm 70-kDa rhodamine B isothiocyanate-dextran (Sigma). Loaded liposomes were separated from the free dextran by size exclusion on SuperoseTM 6 prep grade (Amersham Biosciences) column. Components of the X. laevis in vitro NE reconstitution system were prepared as described previously (31Powers M. Evans E.K. Yang J. Kornbluth S. Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 11.10.1-11.10.24Crossref Google Scholar). In brief, female frogs were injected with 500 units/ml human chorionic gonadotropin (Sigma), and eggs were collected after 18 h. Dejellied eggs were crushed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g (9,000 rpm, 12 min; SW28, Beckman), and crude nuclear assembly extract was obtained. This extract was further fractionated by centrifugation at 200,000 × g (55,000 rpm, 2 h; rotor TLC-55, Beckman) into cytosolic light membrane and heavy membrane (enriched in mitochondria) fractions. Membrane-free nuclear assembly extract (referred to as “interphase cytosol”) and light membrane fraction (referred to as “MVs”) were stored at −70 °C. To test for the presence of membrane-residing proteins in our cytosolic preparation, we carried out Western blot analysis for the following proteins: p78, reticulon RTN4, Nup210 (supplemental Fig. S1), and ribophorin (see Ref. 29Ramos C. Rafikova E.R. Melikov K. Chernomordik L.V. Biochem. J. 2006; 400: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and as expected, we found these proteins in our MV but not in the cytosol. Mitotic cytosol was prepared as above except EGTA and β-glycerophosphate (Calbiochem) were added before crushing the eggs (31Powers M. Evans E.K. Yang J. Kornbluth S. Curr. Protoc. Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 11.10.1-11.10.24Crossref Google Scholar). Control nuclei were formed by mixing 20 μl of interphase cytosol (∼20 mg/ml total proteins (BCA protein assay kit, Pierce)), 2 μl of MVs (∼20 mg/ml of total proteins (BCA protein assay kit, Pierce)), ∼10 mm lipids, as determined by an assay described previously (32Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and demembraned sperm chromatin (∼3,000 sperms/μl) in the presence of the ATP-regeneration system (1 mm ATP (Roche Applied Science), 10 mm creatine phosphate (Calbiochem), and 50 μg/ml creatine kinase (Calbiochem)) and incubated for 2 h at 23 °C. In most experiments, “undeveloped nuclei” were formed as control ones, except MVs were diluted 10 times (0.1 egg equivalent (EE)) (5Wilson K.L. Newport J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) in MWB. To form “rescued nuclei,” we supplemented 2 μl of 0.1 EE of MVs with 5 μl of 10 mg/ml DOPC liposomes. In this mixture liposomes contain ∼2.5 times more lipids than MVs at 1 EE concentration. Rescue of nuclei formation was observed whether liposomes were added simultaneously with MVs, 30 min before, or after MVs. In another experimental design, we first co-incubated chromatin and cytosol with a standard 1.0 EE amount of MVs for 30 min. Then the chromatin was diluted in MWB, pelleted (10,000 rpm, 10 min; Eppendorf 5417R tabletop centrifuge) through a cushion of 30% (w/v) sucrose in MWB, and resuspended in fresh cytosol. Next, the mixture was divided into three portions, and either MWB buffer or MVs or liposomes was added. Formation of rescued and undeveloped nuclei usually proceeded more slowly than formation of control ones and took up to 3 h. Alexa 488-labeled concanavalin A (Invitrogen), Alexa 488-labeled Ab414, 70-kDa rhodamine B isothiocyanate dextran (Sigma), Alexa 488-labeled BSA with nuclear localization signal (kind gift of Douglass J. Forbes, University of California, San Diego), and fluorescein-12-UTP (Roche Applied Science) were added to the samples 30 min before analysis under microscope. In some experiments at the end of the incubation membranes were stained by adding 0.2 μl of 1 mg/ml 3,3′-dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate (DiO; Invitrogen) or octadecyl rhodamine B chloride (R18; Invitrogen). Cytosol-independent ER reconstitution was performed in high salt buffer (HSB): 250 mm sucrose, 200 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, as described in Ref. 28Voeltz G.K. Prinz W.A. Shibata Y. Rist J.M. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 2006; 124: 573-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar except HSB was supplemented with both ATP-regeneration system and 2 mm GTP (Roche Applied Science). For direct immunofluorescence with Alexa 488-labeled monoclonal 414 antibody against NPC (Covance), labeled nuclei were fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde and 1% glutaraldehyde and subsequently centrifuged (15 min, 10,000 rpm; rotor TY.JS-4.2; Beckman) through a cushion of 30% (w/v) sucrose in MWB onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. Similar results were obtained if Ab414 was applied after fixation. Fluorescence was measured with the same settings for all nuclei preparations and analyzed with ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). For lipid-mixing assay, MVs were labeled with R18. 10 μl of MVs and R18 (0.03 μg final concentration) were mixed in MWB (to final volume of 100 μl) and incubated for 10 min on ice. Column chromatography (Poly-Prep columns, Bio-Rad; 10-μm agarose beads; Agarose Bead Technologies) was used to remove unbound dye. Fluorescence of R18 in labeled MVs was quenched ∼2 times. To label MVs with DiO, we incubated 20 ml of MVs with 0.5 μl of 5% (w/v) dye in 100 μl of MWB for 10 min on ice. Labeled MVs were separated from free dye by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm (rotor TLC 55; Beckman) for 20 min through a cushion of 30% (w/v) sucrose in MWB. Then MVs were resuspended in a small volume of MWB. Trypsin- (Sigma) and NEM-treated (Calbiochem) MVs were prepared as described in Refs. 5Wilson K.L. Newport J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 33Macaulay C. Forbes D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 5-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, respectively. To monitor lipid mixing, R18-labeled and unlabeled MVs (1:10 ratio), labeled (DOPC/Rd-DOPE) liposomes and unlabeled (DOPC) liposomes (1:10 ratio), or labeled (DOPC/Rd-DOPE) liposomes and unlabeled MVs (1:10 ratio) were mixed in 200 μl of HSB or cytosol (pre-warmed to room temperature) in the presence of ATP-regeneration system and 2 mm GTP. An increase in the fluorescence at excitation and emission wavelengths of 550 and 590 nm, respectively, was recorded for 1 h at room temperature with Spectra Max Gemini XS plate reader fluorimeter (Molecular Devices). The percentage of lipid mixing was calculated as 100 × (F − F0)/(Fmax − F0), where F0 is the initial level of the fluorescence, and Fmax is the maximum dequenching of the fluorescent probe measured by solubilizing membranes with 0.03% (final) Triton X-100 (Fluka) at the end of each experiment. Active nuclear transport was blocked with 50 μg/ml wheat germ agglutinin (WGA; Invitrogen). Fusion stages of nucleus assembly were blocked by supplementing cytosol with 1 mm of either ATPγS or GTPγS (Roche Applied Science), or 100 μm (final) lauroyl lysophosphatidylcholine, or 1.5 μm α-SNAP. α-SNAP plasmid DNA was kindly provided by Hemmo Meyer (Institute of Biochemistry, ETH Zurich, Switzerland). Recombinant α-SNAP was purified by Protein One (Bethesda, MD). The same concentrations of ATPγS, GTPγS, lysophosphatidylcholine, and α-SNAP were used in lipid mixing assays. HSB buffer and cytosol were supplemented with these inhibitors before adding MVs or liposomes. Samples were observed using Axiovert 135 microscope (Zeiss, Germany) with ×100/1.3 Plan-NeoFluar objective (Zeiss, Germany) and ORCA II camera (Hamamatsu, Japan). Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments was carried out using ×100/1.4 PlanApochromat (Zeiss, Germany) objective on LSM510 (Zeiss, Germany) confocal microscope. Nuclear pellets were fixed at room temperature in 2.5% glutaraldehyde made in 0.13 m sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, and post-fixed in 2% osmium tetroxide. The pellets were then processed into Embed-812 epoxy (Electron Microscopy Sciences) via increasing concentrations of ethanol followed by propylene oxide and an infiltration series of resin. The epoxy resin was polymerized for 20 h in an oven set at 60 °C. Thin sections were prepared on a Reichert-Jung Ultracut-ultramicrotome (95 nm thick). The grids were post-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in a JEOL 1010 transmission electron microscope operating at 80 kV. Trypsin or NEM treatments of MVs have been shown to inhibit the assembly of ER (10Dreier L. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 883-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and NE (5Wilson K.L. Newport J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 33Macaulay C. Forbes D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 5-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 34Vogel K. Cabaniols J.P. Roche P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2959-2965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As expected, although intact MVs form characteristic ER networks both in cytosol and in HSB (10Dreier L. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 883-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), trypsin-treated MVs formed ER neither in HSB nor in cytosol (not shown). Surprisingly, trypsin-treated fluorescent lipid-labeled MVs joined untreated MVs in ER formation (seen as the development of labeled ER networks) in the presence of cytosol but not in HSB (Fig. 1A). Similarly, although trypsin-treated MVs did not form NE on their own, these MVs supported the formation of nuclei in a reaction mixture containing chromatin, cytosol, and untreated MVs (Fig. 2A). Trypsin-treated R18-labeled MVs co-localized with untreated DiO-labeled MVs and produced nuclei with bright and smooth fluorescent rims, suggesting that trypsin-treated MVs had become a part of the NE. Similar experiments were carried out on MVs treated with NEM and produced similar results; cytosol restored the ability of MVs to participate in ER (Fig. 1B) and NE (Fig. 2B) formation. To summarize, cytosol restores the ability of functionally impaired MVs to participate in the formation of ER and NE.FIGURE 2Functionally impaired MVs participate in NE formation only in the presence of native MVs. To assemble the nuclei, chromatin was incubated with cytosol in the presence of either R18-labeled and trypsin- or NEM-treated MVs (MVs*, red; top panels in A and B, respectively) or a mixture (1:1) of both R18-labeled, treated MVs* (red) and DiO-labeled untreated MVs (green) (A and B, bottom). DNA was labeled with Hoechst (blue). NE formation was analyzed by fluorescent microscopy after 2 h. Scale bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although trypsin and NEM treatments functionally impair MVs, treated vesicles still carry MR proteins. To test whether these proteins are required for cytosol-dependent functional recovery of MVs, we replaced MVs with liposomes. We used liposomes from dioleoyl-PC, which does not promote nonspecific protein-independent fusion between vesicles (35Chernomordik L.V. Kozlov M.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 175-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Our analysis of the lipid composition of MVs indicated that these vesicles, along with PC, contain significant amounts of PE (data not shown; see also Ref. 36Rizzo A.M. Gornati R. Galli C. Bernardini G. Berra B. Cell Biol. Int. 1994; 18: 1085-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To minimize nonspecific fusion (35Chernomordik L.V. Kozlov M.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 175-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) in our liposomes, we did not include PE and had no more than 5% mol of Rd-DOPE. ER network formed in the presence of MVs, liposomes, and cytosol demonstrated co-localization of fluorescent tags of MVs and liposomes (Fig. 3). In contrast, in HSB, ER did not carry fluorescent probe of the liposomes. Thus liposomes, like functionally impaired MVs, participated in ER formation only in the presence of cytosolic factors. In the absence of MVs and, thus of tubule-forming proteins such as reticulon Rtn4a/ NogoA and DP1/Yop1p (28Voeltz G.K. Prinz W.A. Shibata Y. Rist J.M. Rapoport T.A.

To summarize, in the presence of cytosol, liposomes acquire the ability to participate in ER formation. As described earlier (3Lohka M.J. Masui Y. J.
