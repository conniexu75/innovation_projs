https://openalex.org/W2968420254,"Ageing causes a decline in tissue regeneration owing to a loss of function of adult stem cell and progenitor cell populations1. One example is the deterioration of the regenerative capacity of the widespread and abundant population of central nervous system (CNS) multipotent stem cells known as oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs)2. A relatively overlooked potential source of this loss of function is the stem cell ‘niche’—a set of cell-extrinsic cues that include chemical and mechanical signals3,4. Here we show that the OPC microenvironment stiffens with age, and that this mechanical change is sufficient to cause age-related loss of function of OPCs. Using biological and synthetic scaffolds to mimic the stiffness of young brains, we find that isolated aged OPCs cultured on these scaffolds are molecularly and functionally rejuvenated. When we disrupt mechanical signalling, the proliferation and differentiation rates of OPCs are increased. We identify the mechanoresponsive ion channel PIEZO1 as a key mediator of OPC mechanical signalling. Inhibiting PIEZO1 overrides mechanical signals in vivo and allows OPCs to maintain activity in the ageing CNS. We also show that PIEZO1 is important in regulating cell number during CNS development. Thus we show that tissue stiffness is a crucial regulator of ageing in OPCs, and provide insights into how the function of adult stem and progenitor cells changes with age. Our findings could be important not only for the development of regenerative therapies, but also for understanding the ageing process itself. Aged progenitor cells in the rat central nervous system can be made to behave as young cells by reducing the stiffness of the tissue microenvironment, or by inhibiting the mechanosensitive protein PIEZO1."
https://openalex.org/W2968833147,"Protein ubiquitination is a multi-functional post-translational modification that affects all cellular processes. Its versatility arises from architecturally complex polyubiquitin chains, in which individual ubiquitin moieties may be ubiquitinated on one or multiple residues, and/or modified by phosphorylation and acetylation1-3. Advances in mass spectrometry have enabled the mapping of individual ubiquitin modifications that generate the ubiquitin code; however, the architecture of polyubiquitin signals has remained largely inaccessible. Here we introduce Ub-clipping as a methodology by which to understand polyubiquitin signals and architectures. Ub-clipping uses an engineered viral protease, Lbpro∗, to incompletely remove ubiquitin from substrates and leave the signature C-terminal GlyGly dipeptide attached to the modified residue; this simplifies the direct assessment of protein ubiquitination on substrates and within polyubiquitin. Monoubiquitin generated by Lbpro∗ retains GlyGly-modified residues, enabling the quantification of multiply GlyGly-modified branch-point ubiquitin. Notably, we find that a large amount (10-20%) of ubiquitin in polymers seems to exist as branched chains. Moreover, Ub-clipping enables the assessment of co-existing ubiquitin modifications. The analysis of depolarized mitochondria reveals that PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy predominantly exploits mono- and short-chain polyubiquitin, in which phosphorylated ubiquitin moieties are not further modified. Ub-clipping can therefore provide insight into the combinatorial complexity and architecture of the ubiquitin code."
https://openalex.org/W3101814149,"Polarons-electronic charge carriers 'dressed' by a local polarization of the background environment-are among the most fundamental quasiparticles in interacting many-body systems, and emerge even at the level of a single dopant1. In the context of the two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model, polarons are predicted to form around charged dopants in an antiferromagnetic background in the low-doping regime, close to the Mott insulating state2-7; this prediction is supported by macroscopic transport and spectroscopy measurements in materials related to high-temperature superconductivity8. Nonetheless, a direct experimental observation of the internal structure of magnetic polarons is lacking. Here we report the microscopic real-space characterization of magnetic polarons in a doped Fermi-Hubbard system, enabled by the single-site spin and density resolution of our ultracold-atom quantum simulator. We reveal the dressing of doublons by a local reduction-and even sign reversal-of magnetic correlations, which originates from the competition between kinetic and magnetic energy in the system. The experimentally observed polaron signatures are found to be consistent with an effective string model at finite temperature7. We demonstrate that delocalization of the doublon is a necessary condition for polaron formation, by comparing this setting with a scenario in which a doublon is pinned to a lattice site. Our work could facilitate the study of interactions between polarons, which may lead to collective behaviour, such as stripe formation, as well as the microscopic exploration of the fate of polarons in the pseudogap and 'bad metal' phases."
https://openalex.org/W2963244439,"Direct reciprocity is a powerful mechanism for the evolution of cooperation on the basis of repeated interactions1–4. It requires that interacting individuals are sufficiently equal, such that everyone faces similar consequences when they cooperate or defect. Yet inequality is ubiquitous among humans5,6 and is generally considered to undermine cooperation and welfare7–10. Most previous models of reciprocity do not include inequality11–15. These models assume that individuals are the same in all relevant aspects. Here we introduce a general framework to study direct reciprocity among unequal individuals. Our model allows for multiple sources of inequality. Subjects can differ in their endowments, their productivities and in how much they benefit from public goods. We find that extreme inequality prevents cooperation. But if subjects differ in productivity, some endowment inequality can be necessary for cooperation to prevail. Our mathematical predictions are supported by a behavioural experiment in which we vary the endowments and productivities of the subjects. We observe that overall welfare is maximized when the two sources of heterogeneity are aligned, such that more productive individuals receive higher endowments. By contrast, when endowments and productivities are misaligned, cooperation quickly breaks down. Our findings have implications for policy-makers concerned with equity, efficiency and the provisioning of public goods. A framework that includes inequality shows that extreme inequality prevents cooperation, but overall welfare is maximized when endowments and productivities are aligned such that more-productive individuals receive higher endowments."
https://openalex.org/W2968760487,"The Juno mission1 has provided an accurate determination of Jupiter's gravitational field2, which has been used to obtain information about the planet's composition and internal structure. Several models of Jupiter's structure that fit the probe's data suggest that the planet has a diluted core, with a total heavy-element mass ranging from ten to a few tens of Earth masses (about 5 to 15 per cent of the Jovian mass), and that heavy elements (elements other than hydrogen and helium) are distributed within a region extending to nearly half of Jupiter's radius3,4. Planet-formation models indicate that most heavy elements are accreted during the early stages of a planet's formation to create a relatively compact core5-7 and that almost no solids are accreted during subsequent runaway gas accretion8-10. Jupiter's diluted core, combined with its possible high heavy-element enrichment, thus challenges standard planet-formation theory. A possible explanation is erosion of the initially compact heavy-element core, but the efficiency of such erosion is uncertain and depends on both the immiscibility of heavy materials in metallic hydrogen and on convective mixing as the planet evolves11,12. Another mechanism that can explain this structure is planetesimal enrichment and vaporization13-15 during the formation process, although relevant models typically cannot produce an extended diluted core. Here we show that a sufficiently energetic head-on collision (giant impact) between a large planetary embryo and the proto-Jupiter could have shattered its primordial compact core and mixed the heavy elements with the inner envelope. Models of such a scenario lead to an internal structure that is consistent with a diluted core, persisting over billions of years. We suggest that collisions were common in the young Solar system and that a similar event may have also occurred for Saturn, contributing to the structural differences between Jupiter and Saturn16-18."
https://openalex.org/W2969180072,"In the last decades, huge efforts have been made in the bioinformatics community to develop machine learning-based methods for the prediction of structural features of proteins in the hope of answering fundamental questions about the way proteins function and their involvement in several illnesses. The recent advent of Deep Learning has renewed the interest in neural networks, with dozens of methods being developed taking advantage of these new architectures. However, most methods are still heavily based pre-processing of the input data, as well as extraction and integration of multiple hand-picked, and manually designed features. Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSA) are the most common source of information in de novo prediction methods. Deep Networks that automatically refine the MSA and extract useful features from it would be immensely powerful. In this work, we propose a new paradigm for the prediction of protein structural features called rawMSA. The core idea behind rawMSA is borrowed from the field of natural language processing to map amino acid sequences into an adaptively learned continuous space. This allows the whole MSA to be input into a Deep Network, thus rendering pre-calculated features such as sequence profiles and other features calculated from MSA obsolete. We showcased the rawMSA methodology on three different prediction problems: secondary structure, relative solvent accessibility and inter-residue contact maps. We have rigorously trained and benchmarked rawMSA on a large set of proteins and have determined that it outperforms classical methods based on position-specific scoring matrices (PSSM) when predicting secondary structure and solvent accessibility, while performing on par with methods using more pre-calculated features in the inter-residue contact map prediction category in CASP12 and CASP13. Clearly demonstrating that rawMSA represents a promising development that can pave the way for improved methods using rawMSA instead of sequence profiles to represent evolutionary information in the coming years.

https://openalex.org/W2967433988,"Background Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) can cause degeneration in the retina and optic nerve either directly, as a result of amyloid beta deposits, or secondarily, as a result of the degradation of the visual cortex. These effects raise the possibility that tracking ophthalmologic changes in the retina can be used to assess neurodegeneration in AD. This study aimed to detect retinal changes and associated functional changes in three groups of patients consisting of AD patients with mild disease, AD patients with moderate disease and healthy controls by using non-invasive psychophysical ophthalmological tests and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Methods We included 39 patients with mild AD, 21 patients with moderate AD and 40 age-matched healthy controls. Both patients and controls were ophthalmologically healthy. Visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, colour perception, visual integration, and choroidal thicknesses were measured. In addition, OCT and OCT angiography (OCTA) were applied. Findings Visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, colour perception, and visual integration were significantly lower in AD patients than in healthy controls. Compared to healthy controls, macular thinning in the central region was significant in the mild AD patients, while macular thickening in the central region was found in the moderate AD group. The analysis of macular layers revealed significant thinning of the retinal nerve fibre layer, the ganglion cell layer and the outer plexiform layer in AD patients relative to controls. Conversely, significant thickening was observed in the outer nuclear layer of the patients. However, mild AD was associated with significant thinning of the subfovea and the nasal and inferior sectors of the choroid. Significant superonasal and inferotemporal peripapillary thinning was observed in patients with moderate disease. Conclusions The first changes in the mild AD patients appear in the psychophysical tests and in the central macula with a decrease in the central retinal thickness. When there was a disease progression to moderate AD, psychophysical tests remained stable with respect to the decrease in mild AD, but significant thinning in the peripapillary retina and thickening in the central retina appeared. The presence of AD is best indicated based on contrast sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2968461627,"Palliative care aims to improve quality of life for people with serious illness and their families. One potential barrier to palliative care uptake is inaccurate knowledge and/or negative beliefs among the general population, which may inhibit early interest in, communication about, and integration of palliative care following subsequent illness diagnosis. We explored knowledge and beliefs about palliative care among the general public using nationally-representative data collected in 2018 as part of the cross-sectional Health Information National Trends Survey. Only individuals who had heard of palliative care (n = 1,162, Mage = 51.8, 64% female) were queried on knowledge and beliefs. We examined whether self-assessed level of awareness of palliative care (i.e., knowing a little vs. enough to explain it) was associated with the relative likelihood of having accurate/positive beliefs, inaccurate/negative beliefs, or responding “don’t know” to questions about palliative care. Respondents who indicated knowing a lot about palliative care had more accurate versus inaccurate knowledge than those who knew a little on only two of six items and more positive attitudes on only one of three items. In particular, respondents with greater awareness were equally likely to report that palliative care is the same as hospice and requires stopping other treatments, and equally likely to believe that palliative care means giving up and to associate palliative care with death. Those with higher awareness were less likely than those with lower awareness to respond “don’t know,” but greater awareness was not necessarily associated with having accurate or positive beliefs about palliative care as opposed to inaccurate or negative beliefs. Thus, even members of the general public who perceived themselves to know a lot about palliative care were often no less likely to report inaccurate knowledge or negative beliefs (versus accurate and positive, respectively). Findings suggest a need to improve awareness and attitudes about palliative care."
https://openalex.org/W2968789444,"Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are characterized by a chronic inflammation state which prevents cutaneous wound healing, and DFUs eventually lead to infection and leg amputation. Macrophages located in DFUs are locked in an pro-inflammatory phenotype. In this study, the effect of hyperglycemia and hypoxia on the macrophage phenotype was analyzed. For this purpose, a microarray was performed to study the gene expression profile of macrophages cultivated in a high glucose concentration. Hyperglycemia upregulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1, IL-6, chemokines and downregulated the expression of two receptors involved in phagocytosis (CD 36 and Class B scavenger type I receptors). In addition, eleven anti-apoptotic factors were upregulated whereas three pro-apoptotic genes were downregulated. Subsequently, the contribution of hypoxia and hyperglycemia to chronic inflammation and their potential synergistic effect was evaluated on activated THP-1 derived macrophages. A long term post activation effect (17 hours) was only observed on the upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines when hypoxia was combined with a high glucose concentration. In contrast, hyperglycemia and hypoxia did not have any effect on wound healing molecules such as TGF-β1. Taken together, the results show that hyperglycemia acts in synergy with hypoxia to maintain a chronic inflammation state in macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2967498567,"Background The aim of this study is to present average annual healthcare costs for Dutch renal replacement therapy (RRT) patients for 7 treatment modalities. Methods Health insurance claims data from 2012–2014 were used. All patients with a 2014 claim for dialysis or kidney transplantation were selected. The RRT related and RRT unrelated average annual healthcare costs were analysed for 5 dialysis modalities (in-centre haemodialysis (CHD), home haemodialysis (HHD), continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) and multiple dialysis modalities in a year (Mix group)) and 2 transplant modalities (kidney from living and deceased donor, respectively). Results The total average annual healthcare costs in 2014 ranged from €77,566 (SD = €27,237) for CAPD patients to €105,833 (SD = €30,239) for patients in the Mix group. For all dialysis modalities, the vast majority (72–84%) of costs was RRT related. Patients on haemodialysis ≥4x/week had significantly higher average annual costs compared to those dialyzing 3x/week (Δ€19,122). Costs for kidney transplant recipients were €85,127 (SD = €39,679) in the year of transplantation and rapidly declined in the first and second year after successful transplantation (resp. €29,612 (SD = €34,099) and €15,018 (SD = €16,186)). Transplantation with a deceased donor kidney resulted in higher costs (€99,450, SD = €36,036)) in the year of transplantation compared to a living donor kidney transplantation (€73,376, SD = €38,666). Conclusions CAPD patients have the lowest costs compared to other dialysis modalities. Costs in the year of transplantation are 25% lower for patients with kidneys from living vs. deceased donor. After successful transplantation, annual costs decline substantially to a level that is approximately 14–19% of annual dialysis costs."
https://openalex.org/W2967184466,"Substandard and falsified medications pose significant risks to global health. Nearly one in five antimalarials circulating in low- and middle-income countries are substandard or falsified. We assessed the health and economic impact of substandard and falsified antimalarials on children under five in Nigeria, where malaria is endemic and poor-quality medications are commonplace.We developed a dynamic agent-based SAFARI (Substandard and Falsified Antimalarial Research Impact) model to capture the impact of antimalarial use in Nigeria. The model simulated children with background characteristics, malaria infections, patient care-seeking, disease progression, treatment outcomes, and incurred costs. Using scenario analyses, we simulated the impact of substandard and falsified medicines, antimalarial resistance, as well as possible interventions to improve the quality of treatment, reduce stock-outs, and educate caregivers about antimalarial quality.We estimated that poor quality antimalarials are responsible for 12,300 deaths and $892 million ($890-$893 million) in costs annually in Nigeria. If antimalarial resistance develops, we simulated that current costs of malaria could increase by $839 million (11% increase, $837-$841 million). The northern regions of Nigeria have a greater burden as compared to the southern regions, with 9,700 deaths and $698 million ($697-$700 million) in total economic losses annually due to substandard and falsified antimalarials. Furthermore, our scenario analyses demonstrated that possible interventions-such as removing stock-outs in all facilities ($1.11 billion), having only ACTs available for treatment ($594 million), and 20% more patients seeking care ($469 million)-can save hundreds of millions in costs annually in Nigeria.The results highlight the significant health and economic burden of poor quality antimalarials in Nigeria, and the impact of potential interventions to counter them. In order to reduce the burden of malaria and prevent antimalarials from developing resistance, policymakers and donors must understand the problem and implement interventions to reduce the impact of ineffective and harmful antimalarials."

https://openalex.org/W2968661051,"Fatty acid receptors have been recognized as important players in glycaemic control. This study is the first to describe a role for the medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA) receptor G-protein-coupled receptor (Gpr) 84 in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function and insulin secretion. We are able to show that Gpr84 is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. Mice with global deletion of Gpr84 [Gpr84 knockout (KO)] exhibit a mild impairment in glucose tolerance when fed a MCFA-enriched diet. Studies in mice and pancreatic islets suggest that glucose intolerance is accompanied by a defect in insulin secretion. MCFA-fed KO mice also exhibit a significant impairment in the intrinsic respiratory capacity of their skeletal muscle mitochondria, but at the same time also exhibit a substantial increase in mitochondrial content. Changes in canonical pathways of mitochondrial biogenesis and turnover are unable to explain these mitochondrial differences. Our results show that Gpr84 plays a crucial role in regulating mitochondrial function and quality control.-Montgomery, M. K., Osborne, B., Brandon, A. E., O'Reilly, L., Fiveash, C. E., Brown, S. H.

The exploration of the ethnic origin and genetic structure within the Bahraini population is fundamental mainly in the field of population genetics and forensic science. The purpose of the study was to investigate and conduct genetic studies in the population of Bahrain to assist in the interpretation of DNA-based forensic evidence and in the construction of appropriate databases. 24 short-tandem repeats in the GlobalFiler PCR Amplification kit including 21 autosomal STR loci and three gender determination loci were amplified to characterize different genetic and forensic population parameters in a cohort of 543 Bahraini unrelated healthy men. Samples were collected during the year 2017. The genotyping of the 21 autosomal STRs showed all of the loci were in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) after applying Bonferroni’s correction. We also found out no significant deviations from LD between pairwise STR loci in Bahraini population except when plotting for D3S1358-CSF1PO, CSF1PO-SE33, D19S433-D12S391, FGA-D2S1338, FGA-SE33, FGA-D7S820 and D7S820-SE33. The SE33 locus was the most polymorphic for the studied population and THO1 locus was the less polymorphic. The Allele 8 in TPOX scored the highest allele frequency of 0.496. The SE33 locus showed the highest power of discrimination (PD) in Bahraini population, whereas TPOX showed the lowest PD value. The 21 autosomal STRs showed a value of combined match probability (CMP) equal to 4.5633E-27, and a combined power of discrimination (CPD) of 99.99999999%. Off-ladders and tri-allelic variants were observed in various samples at D12S391, SE33 and D22S1045 loci. Additionally, pairwise genetic distances based on FST were calculated between Bahraini population and other populations extracted from the literature. Genetic distances were represented in a non-metric MDS plot and clustering of populations according to their geographic locations was detected. Phylogenetic tree was constructed to investigate the genetic relatedness between Bahraini population and the neighboring populations. Our study indicated that the twenty-one autosomal STRs are highly polymorphic in the Bahraini population and can be used as a powerful tool in forensics and population genetic analyses including paternity testing and familial DNA searching."
https://openalex.org/W2968527992,"Fossilized eyes permit inferences of the visual capacity of extinct arthropods1-3. However, structural and/or chemical modifications as a result of taphonomic and diagenetic processes can alter the original features, thereby necessitating comparisons with modern species. Here we report the detailed molecular composition and microanatomy of the eyes of 54-million-year-old crane-flies, which together provide a proxy for the interpretation of optical systems in some other ancient arthropods. These well-preserved visual organs comprise calcified corneal lenses that are separated by intervening spaces containing eumelanin pigment. We also show that eumelanin is present in the facet walls of living crane-flies, in which it forms the outermost ommatidial pigment shield in compound eyes incorporating a chitinous cornea. To our knowledge, this is the first record of melanic screening pigments in arthropods, and reveals a fossilization mode in insect eyes that involves a decay-resistant biochrome coupled with early diagenetic mineralization of the ommatidial lenses. The demonstrable secondary calcification of lens cuticle that was initially chitinous has implications for the proposed calcitic corneas of trilobites, which we posit are artefacts of preservation rather than a product of in vivo biomineralization4-7. Although trilobite eyes might have been partly mineralized for mechanical strength, a (more likely) organic composition would have enhanced function via gradient-index optics and increased control of lens shape."
https://openalex.org/W2968024762,"Schwann cells (SCs) play an essential role in nerve injury repair. A striking feature of the cellular response to peripheral nerve injury is the proliferation of SCs. Circular (circ)RNAs are enriched in the nervous system and are involved in physiologic and pathologic processes. However, the potential role of circRNAs in SC proliferation post nerve injury remains largely unknown. Using a sciatic nerve crush model, we obtained an expression profiling of circRNAs in injured sciatic nerves in rats by RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, and we further identified a circRNA [circ–ankyrin repeat and in-between Ring finger (IBR) domain containing 1 (Ankib1)] involved in SC proliferation by the transfection of specific small interfering RNAs. Overexpression of circ-Ankib1, which was specifically and highly enriched in SCs, impaired SC proliferation and axon regeneration following sciatic nerve injury. Mechanistically, increased expression of DEx/H-box helicase 9 (DHX9) postinjury might contribute to the down-regulation of circ-Ankib1, which further suppressed cytochrome P450, family 26, subfamily B, polypeptide 1 expression by sponging miR-423-5p, miR-485-5p, and miR-666-3p, leading to the induction of SC proliferation and nerve regeneration.

https://openalex.org/W2967308614,"Emotion recognition plays an important role in human-computer interaction. Previously and currently, many studies focused on speech emotion recognition using several classifiers and feature extraction methods. The majority of such studies, however, address the problem of speech emotion recognition considering emotions solely from the perspective of a single language. In contrast, the current study extends monolingual speech emotion recognition to also cover the case of emotions expressed in several languages that are simultaneously recognized by a complete system. To address this issue, a method, which provides an effective and powerful solution to bilingual speech emotion recognition, is proposed and evaluated. The proposed method is based on a two-pass classification scheme consisting of spoken language identification and speech emotion recognition. In the first pass, the language spoken is identified; in the second pass, emotion recognition is conducted using the emotion models of the language identified. Based on deep learning and the i-vector paradigm, bilingual emotion recognition experiments have been conducted using the state-of-the-art English IEMOCAP (four emotions) and German FAU Aibo (five emotions) corpora. Two classifiers along with i-vector features were used and compared, namely, fully connected deep neural networks (DNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). In the case of DNN, 64.0% and 61.14% unweighted average recalls (UARs) were obtained using the IEMOCAP and FAU Aibo corpora, respectively. When using CNN, 62.0% and 59.8% UARs were achieved in the case of the IEMOCAP and FAU Aibo corpora, respectively. These results are very promising, and superior to those obtained in similar studies on multilingual or even monolingual speech emotion recognition. Furthermore, an additional baseline approach for bilingual speech emotion recognition was implemented and evaluated. In the baseline approach, six common emotions were considered, and bilingual emotion models were created, trained on data from the two languages. In this case, 51.2% and 51.5% UARs for six emotions were obtained using DNN and CNN, respectively. The results using the baseline method were reasonable and promising, showing the effectiveness of using i-vectors and deep learning in bilingual speech emotion recognition. On the other hand, the proposed two-pass method based on language identification showed significantly superior performance. Furthermore, the current study was extended to also deal with multilingual speech emotion recognition using corpora collected under similar conditions. Specifically, the English IEMOCAP, the German Emo-DB, and a Japanese corpus were used to recognize four emotions based on the proposed two-pass method. The results obtained were very promising, and the differences in UAR were not statistically significant compared to the monolingual classifiers."
https://openalex.org/W2968881145,"Co-exposure to pesticides and viruses is likely to occur in honey bee colonies. Pesticides can be present in pollen, nectar, and persist in stored food (honey and bee bread), and viruses can be highly prevalent in honey bee colonies. Therefore, the present study describes the influence of chronic co-exposure to thiamethoxam and Chronic bee paralysis virus (CBPV) on bee survival, virus loads, expression level of immune and detoxication genes, and pesticide metabolism Experiments were performed on honey bees collected from a winter apiary with reduced viral contaminations. No synergistic effect of co-exposure was observed on bee survival, nor on the ability of bees to metabolise the pesticide into clothianidin. However, we found that co-exposure caused an increase in CBPV loads that reached the viral levels usually found in overt infections. The effect of co-exposure on CBPV replication was associated with down-regulation of vitellogenin and dorsal-1a gene transcription. Nevertheless, the observed effects might be different to those occurring in spring or summer bees, which are more likelyco-exposed to thiamethoxam and CBPV and exhibit a different physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2968111994,"Objective To assess the association between body mass index (BMI) and physical fitness index (PFI) among children and adolescents in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China. Methods In total, 17,618 children and adolescents aged 7–18 years from the selected region were enrolled in this cross-sectional study (8,800 boys and 8,818 girls). Participants were stratified by age and sex and divided into five groups by BMI percentiles: very low (BMI <5th percentile); low, (5th ≤ BMI < 15th percentile); normal (15th ≤ BMI < 85th percentile); high (85th ≤ BMI < 95th percentile); and very high (BMI ≥95th percentile). PFI was assessed by height, weight, and five health-related fitness indicators (grip strength, standing long jump, sit and reach, 50 m dash, and endurance run). Results BMI was significantly associated with PFI during adolescence (13–18 years) in boys and pre-adolescence (7–12 years) in girls. Between the ages of 13 and 18 years, an increase in BMI had a greater impact on PFI in boys than girls. PFI showed a parabolic curvilinear relationship with BMI. Conclusion Children and adolescents in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region with a normal BMI demonstrated good physical fitness. A BMI below or above the normal range may contribute to poor physical fitness. The relationship between BMI and PFI shows an inverted U-shaped curve."
https://openalex.org/W2966907348,"Abnormal placental development is one of the main etiological factors for intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Here, we show that LIN28A and LIN28B are significantly lower and lethal-7 (let-7) microRNAs (miRNAs) significantly higher in term human IUGR vs. normal placentas. We hypothesize that let-7 miRNAs regulate genes with known importance for human placental development [high-mobility group AT-hook 1 (HMGA1), transcriptional regulator Myc-like (c-myc), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), and Wnt family member 1 (WNT1)] by targeting the AT-rich interacting domain (ARID)-3B complex. ACH-3P cells with LIN28A and LIN28B knockout (DKOs) significantly increased let-7 miRNAs, leading to significantly decreased ARID3A, ARID3B, and lysine demethylase 4C (KDM4C). Similarly, Sw.71 cells overexpressing LIN28A and LIN28B (DKIs) significantly decreased let-7 miRNAs, leading to significantly increased ARID3A, ARID3B, and KDM4C. In ACH-3P cells, ARID3A, ARID3B, and KDM4C make a triprotein complex [triprotein complex comprising ARID3A, ARID3B, and KDM4C (ARID3B-complex)] that binds the promoter regions of HMGA1, c-MYC, VEGF-A, and WNT1. ARID3B knockout in ACH-3P cells disrupted the ARID3B-complex, leading to a significant decrease in HMGA1, c-MYC, VEGF-A, and WNT1.

https://openalex.org/W2966927263,"The plant genus Ficus is a keystone resource in tropical ecoystems. One of the unique features of figs is the diversity of fruit traits, which in many cases match their various dispersers, the so-called fruit syndromes. The classic example of this is the strong phenotypic differences found between figs with bat and bird dispersers (color, size, presentation, and scent). The ‘bird-fig’ Ficus colubrinae represents an exception to this trend since it attracts the small frugivorous bat species Ectophylla alba at night, but during the day it attracts bird visitors. Here we investigate day to night changes in fruit scent as a possible mechanism by which this ‘bird-fig’ could attract bats despite its fruit traits, which should appeal solely to birds. Analyses of odor bouquets from the bat- and bird-dispersal phases (i.e. day and night) differed significantly in their composition of volatiles. We observed a significant increase in relative amounts of sesquiterpene and aromatic compounds at night while relative amounts of two compounds of the fatty acid pathway were significantly higher during day. This finding raises the question whether Ficus colubrinae, a phenotypically classic ‘bird-fig’, might be able to attract bat dispersers by an olfactory signal at night. Preliminary observations from feeding experiments which indicate that Ectophylla alba is capable of finding ripe figs by scent alone point in this direction. However, additional behavioral experiments on whether bats prefer the ‘night-bouquet’ over the ‘day-bouquet’ will be needed to unequivocally answer this question."
https://openalex.org/W2968294328,"Unmet need for contraception is defined as the proportion of fertile individuals who do not use contraceptives despite wanting to space or limit their childbearing. Studies show that immigrant women in Europe, have higher rates of unintended pregnancies and abortion than native born women. Somali women, have the highest fertility rate in Norway which is much higher than the total fertility rate in Norway (4.0 vs. 1.7). This study investigates the unmet need for contraception among Somali immigrant women in Oslo, Norway, compared to their original population in Mogadishu, Somalia.A community based, cross sectional study was carried out among Somali women in Oslo (N = 228) and Mogadishu (N = 229) from May to December 2018. Pre-structured questionnaires were given to women who were recruited through snow-ball sampling. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 25. We performed a chi-square test for the analyses of categorical variables, a t-test for continuous variables and multivariate logistic analysis to determine the association between exposure and outcome variable.The unmet needs for contraception among Somali women in Oslo was 20.2%, which is similar to unmet needs for contraception of women in many sub-Saharan African countries. The unmet needs for Somali immigrant women in Oslo (20.2) is two times lower than that of their original population in Somalia (48.5). The odds of having unmet needs for contraception was nearly, three times higher among Somali women in Mogadishu compared to those in Oslo (OR: 2.6, CI: 2.56-7.68). The mean intended fertility was 4 among the women in Oslo and 10.8 in Mogadishu. About 13.4% of study participants in Oslo and 86.6% of those in Mogadishu consider modern contraception irrelevant for women's health. Nearly 50% of women in both places had unintended childbirth on one or more occasion.The study results show the prevalence of unmet needs for contraception among Somali immigrant women Oslo, is 4 fold higher than that of Norway (20.2 vs 5.5). Information Education Communication to both men and women, may reduce the high unmet need for contraception and also improve partner communication on family planning among Somali immigrants in Oslo. Training primary health providers for provision of tailored information about the modern contraception to immigrant women, which includes an individualized counselling may improve partners' knowledge, demand and uptake of modern contraception."
https://openalex.org/W2968468595,"Context Xanthone derivatives have been reported to possess a wide range of biological properties. In effort to search new effective antihypertensive compounds, we have synthesizednovel xanthone derivatives (xanthonoxypropanolamines) and got patent for these compounds (The Patent Office, Government of India, S. No.: 011–016308, Patent No.: 250538). Objective In the present work, we attempted to establish the antihypertensive activity, toxicity and molecular docking study forthese newly synthesized compounds (1a, 1b and 2). Materials and method The preliminary antihypertensive screening was performed by administering synthesized compounds and standard drugs intraperitonially and orally into wistar rats. The change in systolic, diastolic and the mean blood pressure before and after the treatment of the drugs was measured on a Digital LE-S100 Blood Pressure Meter by Tail-cuff method non-invasively. Toxicity studies were carried out after oral administration of synthesized compounds to rats at doses of 25, 50, and 100mg/kg. The serum samples were tested for different toxicity parameters such as liver function test, kidney function test etc. The docking simulations of all the compounds were performed using Maestro, version 9.4 implemented from Schrodinger software suite. Results and discussion The result showed that the compound 1a, 1b and 2 have greater antihypertensive activity with almost equal or less toxicity profile in comparison to standard drug Propranolol and Atenolol. The docking score for the compound 1b was found -9.1 while for compound 1a and 2 were found -8.7 and -8.6 respectively. Conclusion These novel compounds i.e. 1a, 1b, and 2 have greater antihypertensive activity in comparison to standard drugs Propranolol and Atenolol. All these compounds do not have any toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2967259501,"A cochlear implant is a small electronic device that provides a sense of sound for the user, which can be used unilaterally or bilaterally. Although there is advocacy for the benefits of binaural hearing, the high cost of cochlear implant raises the question of whether its additional benefits over the use of an acoustic hearing aid in the contralateral ear outweigh its costs. This cost-effectiveness analysis aimed to separately assess the cost-effectiveness of simultaneous and sequential bilateral cochlear implantations compared to bimodal hearing (use of unilateral cochlear implant combined with an acoustic hearing aid in the contralateral ear) in children with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss in both ears from the Singapore healthcare payer perspective. Incremental quality-adjusted life year (QALYs) gained and costs associated with bilateral cochlear implants over the lifetime horizon were estimated based on a four-state Markov model. The analysis results showed that, at the 2017 mean cost, compared to bimodal hearing, patients receiving bilateral cochlear implants experienced more QALYs but incurred higher costs, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of USD$60,607 per QALY gained for simultaneous bilateral cochlear implantation, and USD$81,782 per QALY gained for sequential bilateral cochlear implantation. The cost-effectiveness of bilateral cochlear implants is most sensitive to utility gain associated with second cochlear implant, and cost of bilateral cochlear implants. ICERs increased when the utility gain from bilateral cochlear implants decreased; ICERs exceeded USD$120,000 per QALY gained when the utility gain was halved from 0.03 to 0.015 in both simultaneous and sequential bilateral cochlear implantations. The choice of incremental utility gain associated with the second cochlear implant is an area of considerable uncertainty."
https://openalex.org/W2967300392,"Gene-annotation enrichment is a common method for utilizing ontology-based annotations in gene and gene-product centric knowledgebases. Effective utilization of these annotations requires inferring semantic linkages by tracing paths through edges in the ontological graph, referred to as relations. However, some relations are semantically problematic with respect to scope, necessitating their omission or modification lest erroneous term mappings occur. To address these issues, we created the Gene Ontology Categorization Suite, or GOcats-a novel tool that organizes the Gene Ontology into subgraphs representing user-defined concepts, while ensuring that all appropriate relations are congruent with respect to scoping semantics. Here, we demonstrate the improvements in annotation enrichment by re-interpreting edges that would otherwise be omitted by traditional ancestor path-tracing methods. Specifically, we show that GOcats' unique handling of relations improves enrichment over conventional methods in the analysis of two different gene-expression datasets: a breast cancer microarray dataset and several horse cartilage development RNAseq datasets. With the breast cancer microarray dataset, we observed significant improvement (one-sided binomial test p-value = 1.86E-25) in 182 of 217 significantly enriched GO terms identified from the conventional path traversal method when GOcats' path traversal was used. We also found new significantly enriched terms using GOcats, whose biological relevancy has been experimentally demonstrated elsewhere. Likewise, on the horse RNAseq datasets, we observed a significant improvement in GO term enrichment when using GOcat's path traversal: one-sided binomial test p-values range from 1.32E-03 to 2.58E-44."

Recent studies have suggested that it could be under a process of cryptic speciation, with the possibility to find different species in similar geographic locations. Here we assessed the population structure and genetic diversity of this highly philopatric and non-dispersive species in the Bocas del Toro Archipelago, Panama. Fragments of the mitochondrial genes cytochrome oxidase I and control region, were used to test the genetic structure of adult and juvenile S. tiburo in this area, and were compared with other locations of the Western Atlantic and Belize. We found significant genetic differentiation between Caribbean bonnethead sharks from Bocas del Toro and Belize, when compared to bonnetheads from other locations of the Western Atlantic. These results also suggest that Bocas del Toro could constitute a different genetic population unit for this species, whereby bonnethead sharks in this area could belong to a unique stock. The information obtained in this study could improve our understanding of the population dynamics of the bonnethead shark throughout its distribution range, and may be used as a baseline for future conservation initiatives for coastal sharks in Central America, a poorly studied an often overlooked region for shark conservation and research."
https://openalex.org/W2968530673,"While diaspora communities have become more critical of Female Genital Cutting (FGC), there are also trends of continuity. To explore the interplay between continuity and change, I designed a study among Somali migrants in Norway. A team of six Somali research assistants collected data from 72 male and female research participants between 16 and 57 years of age through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. The aim of the study was to gather knowledge that could improve interventions among migrant populations. The study findings indicate that the experience of FGC as a practice in transition implies that people have to maneuver between different and partly contradictory social norms. The paper first discusses the contradiction between a strong negative attitude toward FGC and very low engagement. The lack of engagement is explained by the increased privatization of FGC and insecurities due to the transition and disempowerment with regard to challenging the FGC practices of relatives based in countries of origin. Second, the paper explores the contradiction between perceptions of FGC as a disappearing practice and the recognition of trends of continuation. Trends of continuation include those related to perceptions of risk during travel to countries of origin, resistance to defibulation, support for sunna circumcision and insecurities regarding the significance of FGC for marriageability. Thus, despite an almost universally negative attitude toward FGC in the form of infibulation, ongoing changes can, to some extent, hamper further change. This suggests that to ensure further progress in the abandonment of the practice, these complex and interconnected expectations must be addressed."
https://openalex.org/W2968474307,"Regulating ecosystem services provided by urban forests are of great importance for the quality of life among city dwellers. To reach a maximum contribution to well-being in cities, the urban regulating ecosystem services (URES) must match with the demands in terms of space and time. If we understand the matches or mismatches between the current urban dwellers' desired quality conditions (demand) and the supply of URES by urban forests (UF) in the cities, this will facilitate integrating the concepts of ecosystem services in urban planning and management, but such an assessment has suffered from major knowledge limitations. Since it is complex and problematic to identify the direct demands for URES and the spatiotemporal patterns therein, improving the demand indicators can help to determine the actual requirements. In this paper, a methodological approach based on indicators is presented and demonstrated for two important URES: air quality improvement and global climate change mitigation provided by urban trees and shrubs. Four air quality standards and greenhouse gas reduction targets were used and compared to supplies of the URES in Tabriz, Iran. Our results show that the mean contribution of the URES supply to air quality standards and greenhouse gas reduction targets is modest. Hence, in Tabriz, there is a strong mismatch between demand and supply. Mismatches at the city scale will have to be reduced by both a reduction in pollutant emissions and an increased provisioning of URES supply through urban greenery. The presented assessment approach and the results for Tabriz make it explicit how different the demands and supplies of the two studied URES are, and we expect similar mismatches in many other cities. Therefore, our approach, relatively simple but still realistic and easy-to-apply, can raise awareness about, and the utility of, the ecosystem services concepts for urban planning and policymaking."

Comparison of bilateral high mechanical index (MI) bolus-kinetics (HighMiB) and unilateral low MI refill-kinetics (LowMiR) performed before specific treatment.In 16/31 patients HighMiB was eligible, in 8/31 patients LowMiR was eligible. In six out of these eight patients both HighMiB and LowMiR were eligible for direct comparison. In MR/CT perfusion imaging of the 16 patients eligible for HighMiB, 29/48 cortical regions of interest (ROIs) (60%) displayed hypoperfusion or ischemia, areas inadequately accessible by LowMiR. These ROIs made up 49% of the 59 ROIs displaying hypoperfusion or ischemia, altogether. Matching of parameters in normal and impaired ROIs between LowMiR and MRI/CT perfusion imaging was significantly poorer than in HighMiB.LowMiR using refill-kinetics potentially has the advantage of real time imaging and better resolution. The diagnostic impact, however, proves inferior to HighMiB both with respect to imaging quality and semi-quantitative evaluation."

There is evidence that SAPP is an interferon-γ, CD4+ T-cell-mediated disorder, with autoreactive T-cells and autoantibodies directed against myelin protein zero involved in its immunopathogenesis. Precise mechanisms leading to peripheral nerve system inflammation and nerve injury including demyelination in this model are not well defined. We examined the role of activating Fc-gamma receptors (FcγRs) by genetically ablating Fcγ-common chain (Fcer1g) shared by all activating FcγRs in the pathogenesis of this model. We have generated B7-2/ Fcer1g-double null animals for these studies and found that the neuropathic disease is substantially ameliorated in these animals as assessed by behavior, electrophysiology, immunocytochemistry, and morphometry. Our current studies focused on characterizing systemic and endoneurial inflammation in B7-2-null and B7-2/ Fcer1g-double nulls. We found that accumulation of endoneurial inflammatory cells was significantly attenuated in B7-2/ Fcer1g-double nulls compared to B7-2-single nulls. Whereas, systemically the frequency of CD4+ regulatory T cells and expression of immunosuppressive cytokine, IL-10, were significantly enhanced in B7-2/ Fcer1g-double nulls. Overall, these findings suggest that elimination of activating FcγRs modulate nerve injury by altering endoneurial and systemic inflammation. These observations raise the possibility of targeting activating FcγRs as a treatment strategy in acquired inflammatory demyelinating neuropathies."
https://openalex.org/W2967842534,"Seven Northern Inuit Dogs (NID) were diagnosed by pedigree analysis with an autosomal recessive inherited oculoskeletal dysplasia (OSD). Short-limbed dwarfism, angular limb deformities and a variable combination of macroglobus, cataracts, lens coloboma, microphakia and vitreopathy were present in all seven dogs, while retinal detachment was diagnosed in five dogs. Autosomal recessive OSD caused by COL9A3 and COL9A2 mutations have previously been identified in the Labrador Retriever (dwarfism with retinal dysplasia 1—drd1) and Samoyed dog (dwarfism with retinal dysplasia 2—drd2) respectively; both of those mutations were excluded in all affected NID. Nine candidate genes were screened in whole genome sequence data; only one variant was identified that was homozygous in two affected NID but absent in controls. This variant was a nonsense single nucleotide polymorphism in COL9A3 predicted to result in a premature termination codon and a truncated protein product. This variant was genotyped in a total of 1,232 dogs. All seven affected NID were homozygous for the variant allele (T/T), while 31/116 OSD-unaffected NID were heterozygous for the variant (C/T) and 85/116 were homozygous for the wildtype allele (C/C); indicating a significant association with OSD (p = 1.41x10-11). A subset of 56 NID unrelated at the parent level were analysed to determine an allele frequency of 0.08, estimating carrier and affected rates to be 15% and 0.6% respectively in NID. All 1,109 non-NID were C/C, suggesting the variant is rare or absent in other breeds. Expression of retinal mRNA was similar between an OSD-affected NID and OSD-unaffected non-NID. In conclusion, a nonsense variant in COL9A3 is strongly associated with OSD in NID, and appears to be widespread in this breed."

Using the slowly varying envelope approximation and neglecting the dispersion of the nonlinear part of the response of the medium we obtain the system of parabolic equations for the envelopes of both harmonics. We also derive integrals of motion of this system. To solve it numerically we construct a nonlinear finite-difference scheme based on the Crank-Nicolson method preserving the integrals. Primarily, we focus our investigations on the processes of a two-component light bullets generation. We demonstrate that the generation of a coupled pair is possible in a planar waveguide even at normal group velocity dispersion."

The aim of this study was to tomographically assess the symmetry and the protrusion of the cheekbone with unstable ZMC fractures that had been treated by ORIF vs. CRWF. Materials and methods Sixty patients exhibiting a surgically unstable tetrapodal ZMC fracture were included in this multicenter retrospective study. The coordinates of 5 landmarks representing the zygomatic protrusion were comparatively studied on the healthy and on the broken side using preoperative and postoperative tridimensional computed tomography (CT) scans or cone beam CT. Results No significant difference was found in the zygomatic protrusion irrespective of the surgical technique that was used. The zygomatico-maxillary ansa was found to be the most complicated area to reduce, particularly in the frontal plane with both the CRWF and the ORIF technique (p1 = 0.001 and p2 = 0.0009, respectively). There was no difference in terms of the level of complications, while the mean duration of the surgery was significantly less for the CRWF group. Conclusion With good postoperative radiographic outcomes, the CRWF can be proposed as an alternative or in association with the ORIF technique for fixation of tetrapodal fractures of the ZMC."

Aegean Sea (Eastern Mediterranean). The model is stage-specific and includes a 'Wisconsin' type bioenergetics, a diel vertical migration and a population dynamics module, with the incorporation of known differences in biological attributes between the anchovy and sardine stocks. A new energy allocation/egg production algorithm was developed, allowing for breeding pattern to move along the capital-income breeding continuum. Fish growth was calibrated against available size-at-age data by tuning food consumption (the half saturation coefficients) using a genetic algorithm. After a ten-years spin up, the model reproduced well the magnitude of population biomasses and spawning periods of the two species in the N. Aegean Sea. Surprisingly, model simulations revealed that anchovy depends primarily on stored energy for egg production (mostly capital breeder) whereas sardine depends heavily on direct food intake (income breeder). This is related to the peculiar phenology of plankton production in the area, with mesozooplankton concentration exhibiting a sharp decrease from early summer to autumn and a subsequent increase from winter to early summer. Monthly changes in somatic condition of fish collected on board the commercial purse seine fleet followed closely the simulated mesozooplankton concentration. Finally, model simulations showed that, when both the anchovy and sardine stocks are overexploited, the mesozooplankton concentration increases, which may open up ecological space for competing species. The importance of protecting the recruit spawners was highlighted with model simulations testing the effect of changing the timing of the existing 2.5-months closed period. Optimum timing for fishery closure is different for anchovy and sardine because of their opposite spawning and recruitment periods."
https://openalex.org/W2968552908,"Increase of peripheral blood CD4 lymphocyte counts is a key goal of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART); most, but not all, recipients respond adequately and promptly. A small number of studies have examined specific genetic factors associated with the extent of CD4 recovery. We report a genome-wide examination of factors that predict CD4 recovery in HIV-infected women. We identified women in in a cohort study who were on cART with viral load below 400 copies, and drew racially and ethnically matched samples of those with good CD4 response over 2 years or poor response. We analyzed the exomes of those women employing next generation sequencing for genes associated with CD4 recovery after controlling for non-genetic factors identified through forward stepwise selection as important. We studied 48 women with good CD4 recovery and 42 with poor CD4 recovery during virologically-suppressive cART. Stepwise logistic regression selected only age as a statistically significant (p<0.05) non-genetic predictor of response type (each additional year of age reduced the odds of good recovery by 11% (OR = 0.89, CI = 0.84-0.96, p = 0.0009). After adjustment for age and genomic estimates of race and ethnicity, 41 genes harbored variations associated with CD4 recovery group (p≤0.001); 5 of these have been previously reported to be associated with HIV infection, 4 genes would likely influence CD4 homeostasis, and 13 genes either had known functions or were members of product families that had functions for which interactions with HIV or effects on lymphocyte homeostasis were biologically plausible. Greater age was the strongest acquired factor that predicted poor CD4 cell recovery. Sequence variations spanning 41 genes were independently predictive of CD4 recovery. Many of these genes have functions that impact the cell cycle, apoptosis, lymphocyte migration, or have known interactions with HIV. These findings may help inform new hypotheses related to responses to HIV therapy and CD4 lymphocyte homeostasis."

Neutralizing antibody responses elicited by measles virus infection or immunization are a serological correlate of protection. We describe a high-throughput neutralization assay to improve surveillance for measles immunity. Measles virus-antibody mixtures were incubated on Vero cell monolayers and 24 hours later cell-lysates harvested and subjected to one-step SYBR green RT-qPCR to amplify a target sequence within the measles virus nucleoprotein gene. Neutralization endpoint titers were interpolated to determine the dilution that inhibited the relative amplicon copy number by at least 90% compared to the mean signal obtained in virus control wells in the absence of serum. Anti-measles virus and anti-measles hemagglutinin antisera specifically neutralized measles virus in the microneutralization RT-qPCR assay while pre-immune sera and sera raised against other viruses did not. The microneutralization RT-qPCR assay obeyed the Percentage Law for measles virus inputs ranging from 100-5000 TCID50/well. The linear range of the assay corresponds to measles antibody concentrations of 30 to 3000 mIU/mL. Bland-Altman analysis and two-way analysis of variance demonstrated that results obtained using the microneutralization RT-qPCR assay were comparable to those obtained using a plaque reduction neutralization test and correctly identified human serum samples that were seropositive (95% and 100%, sensitivity and specificity, respectively). Furthermore, these comparisons suggest that a concentration of 300 mIU/mL may be a conservative cut-point to use to identify individuals likely to be protected against severe measles disease when the endpoint is based on 90% inhibition of virus replication. Measles virus microneutralization RT-qPCR is a rapid, sensitive, specific, and robust assay for detecting measles neutralizing antibodies that may help to improve immunization strategies nationally and achieve measles elimination globally."
https://openalex.org/W2968453555,"Risk management is a problem humans have faced throughout history and across societies. One way to manage risk is to transfer it to other parties through formal and informal insurance systems. One informal method of self-insurance is limited risk pooling, where individuals can ask for help only when in need. Models suggest that need-based transfer systems may require coordination and common knowledge to be effective. To explore the impact of common knowledge on social coordination and risk pooling in volatile environments, we designed and ran a Risk Pooling Game. We compared participants who played the game with no advance priming or framing to participants who read one of two texts describing real-world systems of risk pooling. Players in the primed games engaged in more repetitive asking and repetitive giving than those in the control games. Players in the primed games also gave more in response to requests and were more likely to respond positively to requests than players in the control games. In addition, players in the primed games were more tolerant of wide differences between what the two players gave and received. These results suggest that the priming texts led players to pay less attention to debt and repayment and more attention to the survival of the other player, and thus to more risk pooling. These results are consistent with findings from fieldwork in small-scale societies that suggest that humans use need-based transfer systems to pool risk when environmental volatility leads to needs with unpredictable timing. Models suggest that the need-based transfer strategy observed in this experiment can outperform debt-based strategies. The results of the present study suggest that the suite of behaviors associated with need-based transfers is an easily triggered part of the human behavioral repertoire."
https://openalex.org/W2966955424,"Glioblastoma is the most frequent malignant intra-cranial tumour. Magnetic resonance imaging is the modality of choice in diagnosis, aggressiveness assessment, and follow-up. However, there are examples where it lacks diagnostic accuracy. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy enables the identification of molecules present in the tissue, providing a precise metabolomic signature. Previous research shows that combining imaging and spectroscopy information results in more accurate outcomes and superior diagnostic value. This study proposes a method to combine them, which builds upon a previous methodology whose main objective is to guide the extraction of sources. To this aim, prior knowledge about class-specific information is integrated into the methodology by setting the metric of a latent variable space where Non-negative Matrix Factorisation is performed. The former methodology, which only used spectroscopy and involved combining spectra from different subjects, was adapted to use selected areas of interest that arise from segmenting the T2-weighted image. Results showed that embedding imaging information into the source extraction (the proposed semi-supervised analysis) improved the quality of the tumour delineation, as compared to those obtained without this information (unsupervised analysis). Both approaches were applied to pre-clinical data, involving thirteen brain tumour-bearing mice, and tested against histopathological data. On results of twenty-eight images, the proposed Semi-Supervised Source Extraction (SSSE) method greatly outperformed the unsupervised one, as well as an alternative semi-supervised approach from the literature, with differences being statistically significant. SSSE has proven successful in the delineation of the tumour, while bringing benefits such as 1) not constricting the metabolomic-based prediction to the image-segmented area, 2) ability to deal with signal-to-noise issues, 3) opportunity to answer specific questions by allowing researchers/radiologists define areas of interest that guide the source extraction, 4) creation of an intra-subject model and avoiding contamination from inter-subject overlaps, and 5) extraction of meaningful, good-quality sources that adds interpretability, conferring validation and better understanding of each case."
https://openalex.org/W2967410267,"C. difficile is an endospore-forming pathogen, which is becoming a common cause of microbial health-care associated gastrointestinal disease in the United States. Both healthy and symptomatic patients can shed C. difficile spores into the environment, which can survive for long periods, being resistant to desiccation, heat, and disinfectants. In healthcare facilities, environmental contamination with C. difficile is a major concern as a potential source of exposure to this pathogen and risk of disease in susceptible patients. Although hospital-acquired infection is recognized, community-acquired infection is an increasingly recognized health problem. Primary care clinics may be a significant source of exposure to this pathogen; however, there are limited data about presence of environmental C. difficile within clinics. To address the potential for primary care clinics as a source of environmental exposure to virulent C. difficile, we measured the frequency of environmental contamination with spores in clinic examination rooms and hospital rooms in Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) area of Texas. The ribotypes and presence of toxin genes from some environmental isolates were compared. Our results indicate primary care clinics have higher frequencies of contamination than hospitals. After notification of the presence of C. difficile spores in the clinics and an educational discussion to emphasize the importance of this infection and methods of infection prevention, environmental contamination in clinics was reduced on subsequent sampling to that found in hospitals. Thus, primary care clinics can be a source of exposure to virulent C. difficile, and recognition of this possibility can result in improved infection prevention, potentially reducing community-acquired C. difficile infections and subsequent disease."
https://openalex.org/W2967622998,"Background Based on the association of common GLIS3 variants with various forms of diabetes and the biological role of GLIS3 in beta-cells, we sequenced GLIS3 in non-diabetic and diabetic Danes to investigate the effect of rare missense variants on glucose metabolism. Methods We sequenced 53 patients with maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), 5,726 non-diabetic participants, 2,930 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and 206 patients with glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (GADA) -positive diabetes. Results In total we identified 86 rare (minor allele frequency < 0.1%) missense variants. None was considered causal for the presence of MODY. Among patients with type 2 diabetes, we observed a higher prevalence of rare GLIS3 missense variants (2.5%) compared to non-diabetic individuals (1.8%) (odds ratio of 1.37 (interquartile range:1.01–1.88, p = 0.04)). A significantly increased HbA1c was found among patients with type 2 diabetes and with GADA-positive diabetes carrying rare GLIS3 variants compared to non-carriers of rare GLIS3 variants with diabetes (p = 0.02 and p = 0.004, respectively). One variant (p.I28V) was found to have a minor allele frequency of only 0.03% among patients with type 2 diabetes compared to 0.2% among non-diabetic individuals suggesting a protective function (odds ratio of 0.20 (interquartile range: 0.005–1.4, p = 0.1)), an effect which was supported by publically available data. This variant was also associated with a lower level of fasting plasma glucose among non-diabetic individuals (p = 0.046). Conclusion Rare missense variants in GLIS3 associates nominally with increased level of HbA1c and increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In contrast, the rare p.I28V variant associate with reduced level of fasting plasma glucose and may be protective against type 2 diabetes."

Selecting the most sensitive is difficult as formal methods to compare varied dependent measures have not been developed. The method first converts the outcome measures into standard scores (z‐scores) and then compares them using analysis of variance to determine whether there are differences in how they assess the impact of graded levels of exposure to stress. The analysis detected various significant interactions in several measures and suggests self‐report mood questionnaires were more sensitive to the stressors present in the study than the cognitive or hormonal measures which were used. These findings support the effectiveness of the z‐score based method as a useful procedure for objectively evaluating the differential sensitivity of various metrics. This method could be useful for research on other independent variables when use of multiple assessment strategies is appropriate. It could be used for evaluating studies yielding conflicting results, such as those detecting effects on one parameter but not others. In such instances, cross‐metric inconsistencies may be due to differential sensitivity of measurement strategies rather than actual differences in the effects of the independent‐variable on the domains under investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2968704644,"Data from clinical trials investigating on-demand medication often consist of an intentionally varying number of measurements per patient. These measurements are often observations of discrete events of when the medication was taken, including for example data on symptom severity. In addition to the varying number of observations between patients, the data have another important feature: they are characterized by a hierarchical structure in which the events are nested within patients. Traditionally, the observed events of patients are aggregated into means and subsequently analyzed using, for example, a repeated measures ANOVA. This procedure has drawbacks. One drawback is that these patient means have different standard errors, first, because the variance of the underlying events differs between patients and second, because the number of events per patient differs. In this paper, we argue that such data should be analyzed by applying a multilevel analysis using the individual observed events as separate nested observations. Such a multilevel approach handles this drawback and it also enables the examination of varying drug effects across patients by estimating random effects. We show how multilevel analyses can be applied to on-demand medication data from a clinical trial investigating the efficacy of a drug for women with low sexual desire. We also explore linear and quadratic time effects that can only be performed when the individual events are considered as separate observations and we discuss several important statistical topics relevant for multilevel modeling. Taken together, the use of a multilevel approach considering events as nested observations in these types of data is advocated as it is more valid and provides more information than other (traditional) methods."

https://openalex.org/W2967633348,"Proteasome primarily degrades the unneeded or damaged proteins by proteolysis. Disruption of the brain barrier and its resulting meningoencephalitis caused by Angiostrongylus cantonensis are important pathological events in non-permissive hosts. In this study, the results showed upregulated proteasome during A. cantonensis infection. Occludin degradation and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity were significantly increased in infected mice than in uninfected mice. Moreover, confocal immunoflourescence microscopy showed that occludin was co-localized with MMP-9. The infected-mice were treated with proteasomal activity inhibitor MG132 by 1.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/day, which resulted in significantly reduced protein levels of phosphorylated IκBα (P<0.05) compared with the untreated control. The phosphorylated nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) showed similar result. In addition, MMP-9 activity and occludin degradation were reduced because of MG132 treatment. These results suggested that the proteasome in A. cantonensis infection degraded phosphorylated IκBα, modulated phosphorylated NF-κB, and then regulated the activation of MMP-9 and occludin degradation. Proteasome alterations were presented in eosinophilic meningitis of BALB/c mice and may contribute to the pathophysiology of eosinophilic meningitis by increasing occludin degradation. This molecule would serve as pivotal regulator in A. cantonensis-induced eosinophilic meningoencephalitis."

The concentration of different types of cytokines and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the plasma were measured in 4 groups of women: Group I, normal pregnancy (n = 10); Group II, patients with gestational DM (n = 12); Group III, pregnant patients with preexisting DM (n = 16); and Group IV, diabetic non-pregnant women (n = 22). The plasma VEGF concentration was significantly higher in the women in Group IV than in other groups (P <0.01). The concentration of the soluble form of the VEGF receptor-1 (sVEGFR-1) was significantly higher in Group I than in other groups (P <0.01). The concentration of soluble form of the VEGF receptor-2 (sVEGFR-2) was significantly lower in Groups I than in other groups (P <0.05). The concentrations of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and eotaxin were significantly lower in Group I than in Groups III and IV. The levels of interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were significantly higher in Group I than in Group IV. Both the VEGF-related molecules and the Inflammatory cytokines are altered in pregnant women with the carbohydrate metabolism disorders."

This study aimed to assess whether atopic sensitization and allergic diseases were associated with altered vascular biomarkers in Norwegian adolescents.Distensibility coefficient of the common carotid arteries, carotid intima-media thickness and atopic sensitization (serum total and specific IgEs) were assessed in 95 Norwegian adolescents, who participated in the RHINESSA generation study. Symptoms of allergic disease were assessed by an interviewer-led questionnaire.Atopic sensitization was found in 33 (34.7%) of the adolescents. Symptomatic allergic disease was found in 11 (33.3%) of those with atopic sensitization. Distensibility coefficient of the common carotid arteries appeared to be lower in participants with atopic sensitization than in those without (46.99±8.07*10-3/kPa versus 51.50±11.46*10-3/kPa; p>0.05), while carotid intima-media thickness did not differ between these groups (0.50±0.04mm versus 0.50±0.04mm; p>0.05). Crude, as well as age- and sex-adjusted multiple regression, revealed no significant association, neither of atopic sensitization nor of allergic disease, with distensibility coefficient of the common carotid arteries and carotid intima-media thickness.Our results do not support the assumption of an adverse impact of atopic sensitization and/or allergic disease on distensibility coefficient of the common carotid arteries and carotid intima-media thickness in Norwegian adolescents. Further research is necessary to study whether the clinical severity of allergic diseases might be more important than the status of allergic disease or atopic sensitization."

The telecommunication standards used in these devices includes error correction codes which are integral part of current and future communication systems. To achieve the higher data rate applications, the turbo and Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes are decoded on parallel architecture which in turn raises the memory conflict issue. In order to get the good performance, the simultaneous access to the entire memory bank should be performed without any conflict. In this article we present breadth first technique applied on transportation modeling of the problem for solving the collision issue of Turbo decoders in order to get optimized architecture solution."
https://openalex.org/W2969137615,"CURB65 and CRB65 score are simple and popular methods to estimate the mortality in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Although there has been a global increase in life expectancy and population ageing, we are still using the same age threshold derived from patients in late 1990s to calculate the scores. We sought to assess the implication of using higher age threshold using Korean population data and a single center hospital records.Using Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC), we analyzed annual age distribution of CAP patients in Korea from 2005 to 2013 and report how patients aged >65 years increased over time. We also assessed annual change in test characteristics of various age threshold in Korean CAP population. Using a single center hospital registry of CAP patients (2008-2017), we analyzed test characteristics of CURB65 and CRB65 scores with various age thresholds.116,481 CAP cases were identified from NHIS-NSC dataset. The proportion of patients aged >65 increased by 1.01% (95% CI, 0.70%-1.33%, P<0.001) every year. In the sample Korean population dataset, age threshold showed its peak AUROC (0.829) at 70. In the hospital dataset, 7,197 cases were included for analysis. The AUROC of both CRB65 and CURB65 was maximized at 71. When CRB71 was applied instead of CRB65 for hospital referral using score <1 to define a low-risk case, the potential hospital referral was significantly decreased (72.9% to 64.6%, P<0.001) without any significant increase in 1-month mortality in the low risk group (0.6% to 0.7%, P = 0.690).There was a significant age shift in CAP population in Korea. Increasing the current age threshold of CURB65 (or CRB65) could be a viable option to reduce ever-increasing hospital referrals and admissions of CAP patients."
https://openalex.org/W2968445126,"The current study investigated whether we could encourage Australian residents to become better prepared for floods by inviting them to make a specific commitment to do so. We sampled 374 residents of the state of Victoria (56% male, 81% metropolitan) and 400 residents of the state of New South Wales (45% male, 59% metropolitan) who lived in locations that were potentially at risk of floods. They residents were sampled so that their distributions of ages, genders and living locations were as representative as possible of the population of those two states. These residents completed two surveys that ascertained their preparedness for floods at two points in time, separate by a two-week period. At the end of the first survey all residents received information about how they could better prepare for floods. In addition, approximately half the residents were randomly selected to be invited to commit to becoming better prepared for floods. We found that 74% of residents who were invited to commit to becoming better prepared for floods, were willing to make this commitment. We found that the group that was invited to commit to become better prepared for floods increased their preparedness for floods over the two-week period that separated the two surveys more than the group that was not invited to make this commitment, F(1, 772) = 4.53, p = .034, η2 = .006. We conclude that when emergency services inform residents of flood-prone areas how to better prepare for floods, they should also attempt to elicit from the residents a commitment to become better prepared for floods."
