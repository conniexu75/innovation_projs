https://openalex.org/W4309664456,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of dementia, has an estimated heritability of approximately 70%1. The genetic component of AD has been mainly assessed using genome-wide association studies, which do not capture the risk contributed by rare variants2. Here, we compared the gene-based burden of rare damaging variants in exome sequencing data from 32,558 individuals-16,036 AD cases and 16,522 controls. Next to variants in TREM2, SORL1 and ABCA7, we observed a significant association of rare, predicted damaging variants in ATP8B4 and ABCA1 with AD risk, and a suggestive signal in ADAM10. Additionally, the rare-variant burden in RIN3, CLU, ZCWPW1 and ACE highlighted these genes as potential drivers of respective AD-genome-wide association study loci. Variants associated with the strongest effect on AD risk, in particular loss-of-function variants, are enriched in early-onset AD cases. Our results provide additional evidence for a major role for amyloid-β precursor protein processing, amyloid-β aggregation, lipid metabolism and microglial function in AD."

We introduce Cicero, the first AI agent to achieve human-level performance in Diplomacy, a strategy game involving both cooperation and competition that emphasizes natural language negotiation and tactical coordination between seven players. Cicero integrates a language model with planning and reinforcement learning algorithms by inferring players' beliefs and intentions from its conversations and generating dialogue in pursuit of its plans. Across 40 games of an anonymous online Diplomacy league, Cicero achieved more than double the average score of the human players and ranked in the top 10% of participants who played more than one game."
https://openalex.org/W4309667334,"Interactions between stock and cryptocurrency markets have experienced shifts and changes in their dynamics. In this paper, we study the connection between S&P500 and Bitcoin in higher-order moments, specifically up to the fourth conditional moment, utilizing the time-scale perspective of the wavelet coherence analysis. Using data from 19 August 2011 to 14 January 2022, the results show that the co-movement between Bitcoin and S&P500 is moment-dependent and varies across time and frequency. There is very weak or even non-existent connection between the two markets before 2018. Starting 2018, but mostly 2019 onwards, the interconnections emerge. The co-movements between the volatility of Bitcoin and S&P500 intensified around the COVID-19 outbreak, especially at mid-term scales. For skewness and kurtosis, the co-movement is stronger and more significant at mid- and long-term scales. A partial-wavelet coherence analysis underlines the intermediating role of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) in provoking the Bitcoin-S&P500 nexus. These results reflect the co-movement between US stock and Bitcoin markets beyond the second moment of return distribution and across time scales, suggesting the relevance and importance of considering fat tails and return asymmetry when jointly considering US equity-Bitcoin trading or investments and the policy formulation for the sake of US market stability."

In an analysis of human lymph nodes (LNs) from 84 organ donors aged 11-93 years, we found a specific age-related decline in lung-associated, but not gut-associated, LN immune function linked to the accumulation of inhaled atmospheric particulate matter. Increasing densities of particulates were found in lung-associated LNs with age, but not in the corresponding gut-associated LNs. Particulates were specifically contained within CD68+CD169- macrophages, which exhibited decreased activation, phagocytic capacity, and altered cytokine production compared with non-particulate-containing macrophages. The structures of B cell follicles and lymphatic drainage were also disrupted in lung-associated LNs with particulates. Our results reveal that the cumulative effects of environmental exposure and age may compromise immune surveillance of the lung via direct effects on immune cell function and lymphoid architecture."

https://openalex.org/W4309658444,"We report the engineering and selection of two synthetic proteins-FSR16m and FSR22-for the possible treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. FSR16m and FSR22 are trimeric proteins composed of DARPin SR16m or SR22 fused with a T4 foldon. Despite selection by a spike protein from a now historical SARS-CoV-2 strain, FSR16m and FSR22 exhibit broad-spectrum neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 strains, inhibiting authentic B.1.351, B.1.617.2 and BA.1.1 viruses, with respective IC50 values of 3.4, 2.2 and 7.4 ng ml-1 for FSR16m. Cryo-EM structures revealed that these DARPins recognize a region of the receptor-binding domain (residues 456, 475, 486, 487 and 489) overlapping a critical portion of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-binding surface. K18-hACE2 transgenic mice inoculated with B.1.617.2 and receiving intranasally administered FSR16m showed less weight loss and 10-100-fold lower viral burden in upper and lower respiratory tracts. The strong and broad neutralization potency makes FSR16m and FSR22 promising candidates for the prevention and treatment of infection by SARS-CoV-2."
https://openalex.org/W4309667417,"Early-onset preeclampsia (ePE) originates from abnormal implantation and placentation that involves trophoblast invasion, but its pathophysiology is not entirely understood. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) regulators mediate the progression of various cancers. The invasiveness of trophoblast cells is similar to that of tumor cells. However, little is known regarding the potential role of m6A modification in ePE and the underlying mechanism. This study aimed to explore the m6A level in placental tissue samples collected from ePE patients and to investigate whether m6A modification was an essential part of PE pathogenesis. The m6A level in placental tissue samples of 80 PE participants was examined. MeRIP-microarray, RNA-Seq, luciferase reporter assay, and RNA immunoprecipitation chip (RIP) assay were performed. The m6A level in the ePE group was significantly reduced compared with the control group. Wilms' tumor 1-associating protein (WTAP) regulated trophoblast cell migration and invasion. Mechanistically, the high mobility group nucleosomal binding domain 3 (HMGN3) gene was a target gene of WTAP in trophoblast (p < .05). WTAP enhanced the stability of HMGN3 mRNA through binding with its 3’-UTR m6A site(+485A, +522A). HMGN3 was recognized by m6A recognition protein insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1), which was inhibited when knocking down WTAP. Both m6A and WTAP levels were downregulated in ePE. The m6A modification mediated by WTAP/IGF2BP1/HMGN3 axis might contribute to abnormal trophoblast invasion. Our work provided a foundation for further exploration of RNA epigenetic regulatory patterns in ePE, and indicated a new treatment strategy for ePE."
https://openalex.org/W4309600905,"Early combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), as recommended in WHO's universal test-and-treat (UTT) policy, is associated with improved linkage to care, retention, and virologic suppression in controlled studies. We aimed to describe UTT uptake and effect on twelve-month non-retention and initial virologic non-suppression (VnS) among HIV infected adults starting cART in routine HIV program in Kenya. Individual-level HIV service delivery data from 38 health facilities, each representing 38 of the 47 counties in Kenya were analysed. Adults (>15 years) initiating cART between the second-half of 2015 (2015HY2) and the first-half of 2018 (2018HY1) were followed up for twelve months. UTT was defined based on time from an HIV diagnosis to cART initiation and was categorized as same-day, 1-14 days, 15-90 days, and 91+ days. Non-retention was defined as individuals lost-to-follow-up or reported dead by the end of the follow up period. Initial VnS was defined based on the first available viral load test with >400 copies/ml. Hierarchical mixed-effects survival and generalised linear regression models were used to assess the effect of UTT on non-retention and VnS, respectively. Of 8592 individuals analysed, majority (n = 5864 [68.2%]) were female. Same-day HIV diagnosis and cART initiation increased from 15.3% (2015HY2) to 52.2% (2018HY1). The overall non-retention rate was 2.8 (95% CI: 2.6-2.9) per 100 person-months. When compared to individuals initiated cART 91+ days after a HIV diagnosis, those initiated cART on the same day of a HIV diagnosis had the highest rate of non-retention (same-day vs. 91+ days; aHR, 1.7 [95% CI: 1.5-2.0], p<0.001). Of those included in the analysis, 5986 (69.6%) had a first viral load test done at a median of 6.3 (IQR, 5.6-7.6) months after cART initiation. Of these, 835 (13.9%) had VnS. There was no association between UTT and VnS (same-day vs. 91+ days; aRR, 1.0 [95% CI: 0.9-1.2], p = 0.664). Our findings demonstrate substantial uptake of the UTT policy but poor twelve-month retention and lack of an association with initial VnS from routine HIV settings in Kenya. These findings warrant consideration for multi-pronged program interventions alongside UTT policy for maximum intended benefits in Kenya."

https://openalex.org/W4309600617,"Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Infantis (S. Infantis) is a non-typhoid, zoonotic and foodborne serovar with worldwide distribution, and often associated with increasing antimicrobial resistance. Efflux pumps are antimicrobial resistance mechanisms able to promote and increase resistance levels to multiple distinct drug classes. Heavy metal tolerance genes have been demonstrated to promote resistance against these compounds and act in the co-selection of antimicrobial resistant strains. Despite the relevance of S. Infantis in clinical and non-clinical fields, few studies worldwide have investigated the occurrence of such genes in strains from diverse sources. Therefore, the present study aimed at determining the prevalence of antimicrobial efflux pump and heavy metal tolerance genes and their genomic relatedness through core-genome multi-locus sequence typing (cgMLST) of 80 S. Infantis strains isolated from food, environmental, human and animal sources from 2013 to 2018 in Brazil. Twenty efflux pump encoding genes were detected, with 17 of these (acrA, acrB, baeR, crp, emrB, emrR, hns, kdpE, kpnF, marA, marR, mdtK, msbA, rsmA, sdiA, soxR and soxS) detected in all strains studied, golS in 98.75%, mdfA in 58.75% and tet(A) in 37.5%. Tolerance genes to arsenic (arsR) were detected in 100% of the strains, gold (golS and golT) in 98.75%, silver (silABCDEFPRS) in 36.25% and mercury (merR and merT) in 1.25%. cgMLST demonstrated a closer genetic relationship among strains harboring similar profiles of heavy metal and efflux pump encoding genes, despite their origin. In conclusion, the high prevalence of some efflux pump and heavy metal tolerance encoding genes alert us about the importance of strong surveillance measures to monitor resistance and the transmission of S. Infantis among diverse sources in Brazil."

https://openalex.org/W4309574803,"Skeletal muscle atrophy is a prevalent complication in multiple chronic diseases and disuse conditions. Fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (Fn14) is a member of the TNF receptor superfamily and a bona fide receptor of the TWEAK cytokine. Accumulating evidence suggests that Fn14 levels are increased in catabolic conditions as well as during exercise. However, the role of Fn14 in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass and function remains poorly understood. In this study, through the generation of novel skeletal muscle-specific Fn14-knockout mice, we have investigated the muscle role of Fn14 in the regulation of exercise capacity and denervation-induced muscle atrophy. Our results demonstrate that there was no difference in skeletal muscle mass between control and muscle-specific Fn14-knockout mice. Nevertheless, the deletion of Fn14 in skeletal muscle significantly improved exercise capacity and resistance to fatigue. This effect of Fn14 deletion is associated with an increased proportion of oxidative myofibers and higher capillaries number per myofiber in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that targeted deletion of Fn14 inhibits denervation-induced muscle atrophy in adult mice. Deletion of Fn14 reduced the expression of components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and non-canonical NF-kappa B signaling in denervated skeletal muscle, as well as increased the phosphorylation of Akt kinase and FoxO3a transcription factor. Collectively, our results demonstrate that targeted inhibition of Fn14 improves exercise tolerance and inhibits denervation-induced muscle atrophy in adult mice."
https://openalex.org/W4309600416,"Concerns have been raised that immigrants coming to Europe bring fundamentally different social values, affecting the more liberal receiving societies negatively. However, the topic of immigrants' social values is understudied, and much research studies only one issue at a time, lacking a systematic approach to compare immigrants and native-born across issues. We study the social values of immigrants in Sweden using a large sample of newly arrived immigrants and their opinions on 35 different moral issues. Our results indicate a large heterogeneity across different issues, with, on average, a general tendency towards liberal social values among immigrants. We find that individual characteristics are more important than characteristics of the country of origin in explaining variation of social values between immigrants. Religiosity has the largest effect, with more religious individuals having more conservative stances. Using external data sources, we compare immigrants with native-born regarding both average positions on different issues, and the correlation between issue positions. Compared with the native-born, immigrants have, on average, somewhat more conservative values, but the underlying values structure is the same."
https://openalex.org/W4309600418,"Intact executive functions are characterized by flexible adaptation to task requirements, while these effects are reduced in internalizing disorders. Furthermore, as executive functions play an important role in emotion regulation, deficits in executive functions may contribute to symptom generation in psychological disorders through increased emotional interference. Thus, the present study investigated transfer effects of a three-week executive control training on adaptation to task difficulty and emotional interference in healthy participants ( n = 24) to further explore the training’s suitability for clinical application. To assess the adaptation to task difficulty, the proportion congruency effect on behavioral data (response times, error rates) and ERP measures (N2, CRN) was assessed in a flanker task with varying frequency of incompatible trials (25%, 75%). To quantify emotional interference, flanker stimuli were superimposed on neutral or negative pictures. Replicating previous results, the training increased interference control as indexed by decreased response times and errors rates, increased N2 amplitude and decreased CRN amplitude in incompatible trials after training. Proportion congruency effects were weaker than expected and not affected by the training intervention. The training lead to a shift in the time-point of emotional interference: before training negative pictures lead to a reduction in CRN amplitude, while after training this reduction was observed for the N2. This pattern illustrates that the training leads to a change in task processing mode from predominant response-related cognitive control to predominant stimulus-related cognitive control (N2), indicating a proactive processing mode."
https://openalex.org/W4309600474,"Background The emergence and rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a potentially lethal disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is causing public health issues around the world. In resource-constrained nations, rapid Abbott SARS-CoV-2 antigen test kits are critical for addressing diagnostic gaps in health institutions and community screening. However, there is no evidence or proof of diagnostic performance in Ethiopia. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of PanbioTM Abbott SARS-CoV-2antigen rapid test kit to the gold standard, RT-PCR, in COVID-19 patients with clinical symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. Method A prospective, cross-sectional study was conducted between November 2021 and April 2022, on 120 suspected patients recruited from outpatient, emergency, and intensive care units in one of the tertiary hospitals in Ethiopia. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from suspected cases and were tested using the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 kit, a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and compared to the reference standard RT-PCR. Result The sensitivity and specificity of the RDT were 74.2% and 100%, respectively. A total of 62 samples (51.6%) were RT-PCR positive. Of these, 46 were Ag-RDT positive. Sensitivity among symptomatic patients was 79.4% (95% CI 68.3–90). The Abbot RDT and RT-PCR had a Kappa value of agreement of 0.735 (p &lt; 0.001). These values were acceptable when compared to the WHO’s suggested thresholds. Conclusion The finding from this study support the use of the Abbot RDT as a diagnostic tool in COVID-19 suspects, mainly in those with higher viral loads."
https://openalex.org/W4309600500,"The epigenetics of bacteria, and bacteria with a reduced genome in particular, is of great interest, but is still poorly understood. Mycoplasma gallisepticum, a representative of the class Mollicutes, is an excellent model of a minimal cell because of its reduced genome size, lack of a cell wall, and primitive cell organization. In this study we investigated DNA modifications of the model object Mycoplasma gallisepticum and their roles. We identified DNA modifications and methylation motifs in M. gallisepticum S6 at the genome level using single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing. Only the ANCNNNNCCT methylation motif was found in the M. gallisepticum S6 genome. The studied bacteria have one functional system for DNA modifications, the Type I restriction-modification (RM) system, MgaS6I. We characterized its activity, affinity, protection and epigenetic functions. We demonstrated the protective effects of this RM system. A common epigenetic signal for bacteria is the m6A modification we found, which can cause changes in DNA-protein interactions and affect the cell phenotype. Native methylation sites are underrepresented in promoter regions and located only near the -35 box of the promoter, which does not have a significant effect on gene expression in mycoplasmas. To study the epigenetics effect of m6A for genome-reduced bacteria, we constructed a series of M. gallisepticum strains expressing EGFP under promoters with the methylation motifs in their different elements. We demonstrated that m6A modifications of the promoter located only in the -10-box affected gene expression and downregulated the expression of the corresponding gene."
https://openalex.org/W4309600582,"Background Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, health professionals have been working under extreme conditions, increasing the risk of physical and mental illness. We evaluated the prevalence of burnout and its associated factors among postgraduate student residents in health professions during the global health crisis. Methods Healthcare residents were recruited from all across Brazil between July and September 2020 through digital forms containing instruments for assessing burnout (Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI)), resilience (brief resilient coping scale (BRCS)) and anxiety, stress and depression (depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS-21) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)). Additionally, the relationships between burnout and chronic diseases, autonomy and educational adequacy in the residency programme, personal protective equipment (PPE), workload and care for patients with COVID-19 were evaluated. The chi-square test, Student’s t test, Pearson’s correlation test and logistic regression were performed. Results A total of 1,313 participants were included: mean (standard deviation) age, 27.8 (4.4) years; female gender, 78.1%; white race, 59.3%; and physicians, 51.3%. The overall prevalence of burnout was 33.4%. The odds (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]) of burnout were higher in the presence of pre-existing diseases (1.76 [1.26–2.47]) and weekly work &gt; 60 h (1.36 [1.03–1.79]) and were lower in the presence of high resilience (0.84 [0.81–0.88]), autonomy (0.87 [0.81–0.93]), and educational structure (0.77 [0.73–0.82]), adequate availability of PPE (0.72 [0.63–0.83]) and non-white race (0.63 [0.47–0.83]). Burnout was correlated with anxiety (r = 0.47; p &lt; 0.05), stress (r: 0.58; p &lt; 0.05) and depression (r: 0.65; p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions We observed a high prevalence of burnout among residents during the COVID-19 pandemic.

https://openalex.org/W4309600906,"The occurrence of cancer metastasis may be related to stem cells in normal tissues. We searched for patient IDs with both normal tissue stem cell values and TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) clinical data for pairing and obtained 639 sets of data (stemness index of normal tissue, stemness index of tumor tissue, cancer stage, distant metastasis, tumor size) and invasion, and lymph node involvement). However, clinical data on cancer metastasis are of only four stages (e.g., Stage I, II, III, and IV), which cannot show subtle changes continuously. We need to find an effective data mining method to transform this four-valued clinical description into a numerical curve. We data-mine this data through numericalization, sorting, and noise reduction filtering. The results showed that: as the normal tissue stemness value (NS) increased, the tumor tissue stemness value (TS) increased proportionally (1.26 times NS). When NS >0.5, the rate of change in TS decelerated (0.43 times NS), and tumor metastasis began to occur. Clinical indicators, such as cancer stage, distant metastasis, tumor size and invasion, and lymph node involvement, showed that tumor metastasis became more and more severe with the increase of NS. This study suggests that tumor metastasis is triggered when the NS in the patient's body is more significant than 0.5."

However, data on pet ownership are relatively limited from rural regions, Southern Asia and low-middle-income countries. We aim to report the prevalence and associated factors for pet ownership and veterinary visits in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. A community-based, cross-sectional study was conducted. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used. Binary logistic regression was performed to determine significant associations between variables of interest and pet ownership (p < 0.05). Out of the 532 households, 57% currently owned a pet. The most common pet was the dog owned by 41% of the households and the cat was the second most owned by 17%. Security (69% - 152/220) was the most common role for dogs at home while it was companionship for cats (31% - 27/88) and hobby for both birds (64% - 18/28) and fish (54% - 14/26). Most dogs (54% - 118/220) had one veterinary visit within the last year. Households with >1 adult female [p = 0.02; OR = 1.61 (95% CI 1.09 to 2.36)], participants living alone [p = 0.03; OR = 0.24 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.86)] and Buddhists [p = 0.02; OR = 2.56 (95% CI 1.16 to 5.63)] were significantly associated with pet ownership. Pet ownership is common among people in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka, with a few demographic factors having a significant association with pet ownership. Dogs are the most common type of pet and highlight the opportunity for research related to canine companionship and human health. Future research on such topics should consider the above-mentioned socio-demographic predictors as potential confounders."
https://openalex.org/W4309600450,"Classical aniridia is a congenital and progressive panocular disorder almost exclusively caused by heterozygous loss-of-function variants at the PAX6 locus. We report nine individuals from five families with severe aniridia and/or microphthalmia (with no detectable PAX6 mutation) with ultrarare monoallelic missense variants altering the Arg51 codon of MAB21L1 . These mutations occurred de novo in 3/5 families, with the remaining families being compatible with autosomal dominant inheritance. Mice engineered to carry the p.Arg51Leu change showed a highly-penetrant optic disc anomaly in heterozygous animals with severe microphthalmia in homozygotes. Substitutions of the same codon (Arg51) in MAB21L2 , a close homolog of MAB21L1 , cause severe ocular and skeletal malformations in humans and mice. The predicted nucleotidyltransferase function of MAB21L1 could not be demonstrated using purified protein with a variety of nucleotide substrates and oligonucleotide activators. Induced expression of GFP-tagged wildtype and mutant MAB21L1 in human cells caused only modest transcriptional changes. Mass spectrometry of immunoprecipitated protein revealed that both mutant and wildtype MAB21L1 associate with transcription factors that are known regulators of PAX6 (MEIS1, MEIS2 and PBX1) and with poly(A) RNA binding proteins. Arg51 substitutions reduce the association of wild-type MAB21L1 with TBL1XR1, a component of the NCoR complex. We found limited evidence for mutation-specific interactions with MSI2/Musashi-2, an RNA-binding proteins with effects on many different developmental pathways. Given that biallelic loss-of-function variants in MAB21L1 result in a milder eye phenotype we suggest that Arg51-altering monoallelic variants most plausibly perturb eye development via a gain-of-function mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W4309600473,"Rubbish in a forest environment is a great threat to this ecosystem, but this threat may also apply to the lost benefits for visitors to the forest. Previous studies proved that forest areas have a positive effect on obtaining psychological relaxation in the people visiting them. However, it was not known whether this restorative experience could be disturbed in any way by the presence of an open dump in the forest. To check how the presence of a landfill affects the visitors, an experiment was planned in which the respondents observed a forest area with a landfill and a forest landscape without a landfill for 15 minutes (control). The respondents then assessed the landscape using the semantic differential method and the Perceived Restorativeness Scale (PRS). An analysis of these observations showed that the presence of a landfill in the forest significantly changed the appreciation of the landscape by the respondents, the values of positive experiences decreased, and the negative experiences increased. Restorativeness was also reduced. Based on the results, it can be concluded that the presence of garbage in the forest may interrupt the restorative experience of its visitors."

Automated calculation of warning scores may lead to early recognition, and improvement of RRT effectiveness. Method This was a “Before” and “After” study, in the “Before” period ward nurses activated RRT after manually recording vital signs and calculating warning scores. In the “After” period, vital signs and warning calculations were automatically relayed to RRT through a wireless monitoring network. Results When compared to the before group, the after group had significantly lower incidence and rate of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (2.3 / 1000 inpatient days versus 3.8 / 1000 inpatient days respectively, p = 0.01), significantly shorter length of hospital stay and lower hospital mortality, but significantly higher number of RRT activations. In multivariable logistic regression model, being in the “After” group decreases odds of CPR by 33% (OR = 0.67 [95% CI: 0.46–0.99]; p = 0.04). There was no difference between groups in ICU admission. Conclusion Automated activation of the RRT significantly reduced CPR events and rates, improved CPR success rate, reduced hospital length of stay and mortality, but increased the number of RRT activations. There were no differences in unplanned ICU admission or readmission."

However, a knowledge gap exists about the levels of burnout among Bangladeshi frontline doctors during this COVID-19 pandemic. The study investigated burnout syndrome (BOS) among frontline doctors in two public secondary and tertiary care hospitals in Chattogram, Bangladesh.This cross-sectional study involved frontline doctors working at two hospitals treating COVID-19 and non-COVID patients from June to August 2020. A self-administered questionnaire that included Maslach Burnout Inventory for Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS) was used to capture demographic and workplace environment information. ANOVA and t-test were used to determine the statistical differences in the mean values of the three dimensions of MBI-HSS. Scores for three domains of burnout: emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and personal accomplishment (PA) were calculated. Post-hoc analysis was done to identify the significant pair-wise differences when the ANOVA test result was significant. Multiple logistic regression was performed to determine the influence of factors associated with BOS.A total of 185 frontline doctors were invited to participate by convenience sampling, and 168 responded. The response rate was 90.81%. The overall prevalence of BOS was 55.4% (93/168) (95% CI: 47.5% to 63.0%). Moderate to high levels of EE was found in 95.8% of the participants. High DP and reduced PA were observed in 98.2% and 97% of participants. Younger age (25-29 years), being female, and working as a medical officer were independently associated with high levels of burnout in all three domains. EE was significantly higher in females (P = 0.011). DP was significantly higher in medical officers, those at earlier job periods, and those working more than 8 hours per day.During the COVID-19 outbreak, BOS was common among Bangladeshi frontline doctors. Females, medical officers, and younger doctors tended to be more susceptible to BOS. Less BOS was experienced when working in the non-COVID ward than in the mixed ward."

A cross-sectional study was conducted in slaughtered cattle (n = 300) to determine the seroprevalence of anti- Brucella antibodies using the Rose Bengal Test (RBT), and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (i-ELISA). Corresponding tissues were cultured onto a modified Centro de Investigación y Tecnología Agroalimentaria (CITA) selective medium and analysed for Brucella spp. using the 16S-23S ribosomal interspacer region (ITS), AMOS, and Bruce-ladder PCR assays. The seroprevalence was 20.7% (62/300) with RBT, 2.9% (8/300) with i-ELISA, and 2.9% (8/300) using both tests in series. Brucella -specific 16S-23S ribosomal DNA interspace region (ITS) PCR detected Brucella DNA in 5.6% (17/300; Brucella culture prevalence). AMOS-PCR assay identified mixed B . abortus and B . melitensis (n = 3), B . abortus (n = 3) and B . melitensis (n = 5) while Bruce-ladder PCR also identified B . abortus (n = 5) and B . melitensis (n = 6). The gold standard culture method combined with PCR confirmation identified 5.6% Brucella cultures and this culture prevalence is higher than the more sensitive seroprevalence of 2.9%. This emphasizes the need to validate the serological tests in Rwanda. The mixed infection caused by B . abortus and B . melitensis in slaughtered cattle indicates cross-infection and poses a risk of exposure potential to abattoir workers. It is essential to urgently strengthen a coordinated national bovine brucellosis vaccination and initiate a test-and-slaughter program that is not presently applicable in Rwanda."
https://openalex.org/W4309600581,"The long-sought-after “magic bullet” in systemic therapy remains unrealized for disease targets existing inside most tissues, theoretically because vascular endothelium impedes passive tissue entry and full target engagement. We engineered the first “dual precision” bispecific antibody with one arm pair to precisely bind to lung endothelium and drive active delivery and the other to precisely block TGF-β effector function inside lung tissue. Targeting caveolae for transendothelial pumping proved essential for delivering most of the injected intravenous dose precisely into lungs within one hour and for enhancing therapeutic potency by &gt;1000-fold in a rat pneumonitis model. Ultra-low doses (μg/kg) inhibited inflammatory cell infiltration, edema, lung tissue damage, disease biomarker expression and TGF-β signaling. The prodigious benefit of active vs passive transvascular delivery of a precision therapeutic unveils a new promising drug design, delivery and therapy paradigm ripe for expansion and clinical testing."
https://openalex.org/W4309600585,"Sound localization is crucial for the survival and reproduction of animals, including non-auditory specialist animals such as the majority of avian species. The chicken ( Gallus gallus ) is a well-suited representative of a non-auditory specialist bird and several aspects of its auditory system have been well studied in the last decades. We conducted a behavioral experiment where 3 roosters performed a sound localization task with broad-band noise, using a 2-alternative forced choice paradigm. We determined the minimum audible angle (MAA) as measure for localization acuity. In general, our results compare to previous MAA measurements with hens in Go/NoGo tasks. The chicken has high localization acuity compared to other auditory generalist bird species tested so far. We found that chickens were better at localizing broadband noise with long duration (1 s; MAA = 16°) compared to brief duration (0.1 s; MAA = 26°). Moreover, the interaural difference in time of arrival and level (ITD and ILD, respectively) at these MAAs are comparable to what measured in other non-auditory specialist bird species, indicating that they might be sufficiently broad to be informative for azimuthal sound localization."
https://openalex.org/W4309600586,"The Relative Age Effect (RAE) has been the subject of many studies, but few have focused on professional athletes in individual sports. The aim of this study was to verify the existence of the RAE among elite senior female tennis players (top 100 players) in the WTA Rankings ( n = 1000) in the years 2007–2016. The analysis was performed among top 100, resp. top 10 female tennis players, among players in 4 age subgroups and among left-handed (LH) and right-handed (RH) players. The existence of the RAE was assessed with the use of chi-square test (goodness of fit). More than half of top 100 players were born in first semester: both in individual years (53.0–63.0%) and in the whole observed period (58.4%). Significant RAE (ES medium) was observed in top 100 female players only in 2012 and 2016; significant RAE (ES small) was detected in the period of 2007–2016. Among the top 10 players, significant RAE (ES medium) was demonstrated during the whole period. No significant RAE (ES medium) was detected in the 17–18y subgroups, significant in 19–24y and 25–30y (ES small) as well as in 31–36y (ES medium). Although significant RAE was observed in the subgroups of LH and RH female players, ES was large only in the LH. The results contribute to the expansion of the knowledge about the reduction of the RAE existence in adulthood among coaches, athletes and tennis officials."
https://openalex.org/W4309600622,"This paper tests the impact of local government debt on enterprise innovation based on 2011–2017 A-share non-financial enterprise data from Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges. The results show that the relationship between government debt and enterprise innovation relationship follows an inverted U-shaped pattern. Endogeneity processing and robustness test result confirm the results of the model built for this study. Heheterogeneity analysis finds that the inflection points of local government debt in large enterprises, non-SOEs (non-state-owned enterprises) and poorly financialized regions are lower. Financing constraints and corporate profits play a part of the intermediary effect in the inverted U-shaped relationship between local government debt and enterprise innovation. Further research shows that Digital finance plays a moderating role in the impact of local government debt on enterprise innovation. Therefore, to keep local government debt scale compliant and to maximize the efficiency of digital finance are of great significance in terms of boosting enterprise innovation and improve economic development."

In this study, the central nervous anatomical relationship between the heart and small intestine was studied via a viral tracer. Pseudorabies virus (PRV) syngeneic strains with different fluorescent reporter genes (eGFP or mRFP) were microinjected into the heart walls and small intestinal walls of male C57BL/6J using glass microelectrode. The results showed that the co-labeled nuclei in the brain were lateral periaqueductal gray (LPAG) and ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (VLPAG) in the midbrain, mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus (Me5), and motor trigeminal nucleus anterior digastric Part (5Adi) in the pons. The co-labeled sites in the spinal cord were intermediolateral column (IML) in the second thoracic vertebra, IML and lamina 7 of the spinal gray (7SP) in the third thoracic vertebra, and IML in the fourth thoracic vertebra. Our data show that there is a neuroanatomical connection between the small intestine and the heart in the central nervous system (CNS). Neuroanatomical integration of the heart and small intestine may provide a basis for revealing the physiological and pathological interactions between the circulatory and digestive systems. The interactions may be mediated more effectively through sympathetic nerves."
https://openalex.org/W4309601046,"The nitrogen nutrition status affects the main factors of rice yield. In traditional rice nitrogen nutrition monitoring methods, most experts enter the farmland to observe leaf color and growth and apply an appropriate amount of nitrogen fertilizer according to the results. However, this method is labor- and time-consuming. To realize automatic rice nitrogen nutrition monitoring, we constructed the Jiangxi rice nitrogen nutrition monitoring model based on a convolution neural network (CNN) using the same region rice canopy image in different generation periods. Our CNN model was evaluated using multiple evaluation criteria (Accuracy, Recall, Precision, and F1 score). The results show that the same CNN model could distinguish the rice nitrogen nutrition status in different periods, which can completely realize the automatic discrimination of nitrogen nutrition status so as to guide the scientific nitrogen application of rice in this area. This will greatly improve the discrimination efficiency of the nitrogen nutrition status and reduce the time and labor cost. The application of the proposed method also proved that the CNN model can be applied in the discrimination of the nitrogen nutrition status. Among CNN models, GoogleNet model proposed a CNN architecture named Inception which can improve the depth of the network and extract higher-level features without changing the amount of calculation of the model. The GoogleNet model achieved the highest accuracy, 95.7%."
https://openalex.org/W4309666036,"Background Tobacco consumption is a contributing and modifiable risk factor for non-communicable diseases. In high-income countries, tobacco cessation attempts, and their success, are concentrated among the socio-economically advantaged, resulting in a skewed burden of disease. However, there is a paucity of evidence on the distribution of tobacco cessation in low- and middle-income countries. Objective The objective of this study is to measure and decompose wealth- and education-related inequalities in tobacco cessation in eight Sub-Saharan African countries. Methodology The study applies Erreygers’ corrected concentration indices and decomposition methods to the most recent Global Adult Tobacco Surveys in Botswana, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, and Uganda. Findings We find that across countries, successful tobacco cessation, as well as tobacco cessation attempts, are concentrated among wealthier and better-educated individuals. Differences in socio-economic status, urban or rural residence, and not knowing or believing that tobacco consumption leads to serious illness contributes to these inequalities Conclusion Governments in our sample of countries can do more to support socio-economically disadvantaged smokers in their efforts to quit smoking, including by making an effort to align each country’s smoking cessation strategy with the guidelines outlined in the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control."
https://openalex.org/W4309558883,"Recent studies have demonstrated that epigenetic modifications are deeply involved in neurogenesis; however, the precise mechanisms remain largely unknown. To determine the role of UTX (also known as KDM6A), a demethylase of histone H3K27, in neural development, we generated Utx-deficient mice in neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs). Since Utx is an X chromosome-specific gene, the genotypes are sex-dependent; female mice lose both Utx alleles (UtxΔ/Δ ), and male mice lose one Utx allele yet retain one Uty allele, the counterpart of Utx on the Y chromosome (UtxΔ/Uty ). We found that UtxΔ/Δ mice exhibited fetal ventriculomegaly and died soon after birth. Immunofluorescence staining and EdU labeling revealed a significant increase in NSPCs and a significant decrease in intermediate-progenitor and differentiated neural cells. Molecular analyses revealed the downregulation of pathways related to DNA replication and increased H3K27me3 levels around the transcription start sites in UtxΔ/Δ NSPCs. These results indicate that UTX globally regulates the expression of genes required for proper neural development in NSPCs, and UTX deficiency leads to impaired cell cycle exit, reduced differentiation, and neonatal death. Interestingly, although UtxΔ/Uty mice survived the postnatal period, most died of hydrocephalus, a clinical feature of Kabuki syndrome, a congenital anomaly involving UTX mutations. Our findings provide novel insights into the role of histone modifiers in neural development and suggest that UtxΔ/Uty mice are a potential disease model for Kabuki syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W4309600417,"Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have been evaluated in the Peruvian Amazon region and their performance has been variable. This region is known for being the first with documented evidence of wild Plasmodium falciparum parasites lacking pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes, leading to false-positive results with HRP2-based RDTs. In our attempt to further characterize the deletion pattern of these genes and their evolutionary relationship, 93 P . falciparum samples, collected in different communities from the Peruvian Amazon region between 2009 and 2010, were analyzed in this study. Genomic DNA was used to amplify 18S rRNA, pfmsp2 and pfglurp to confirm the diagnosis and DNA quality, respectively; pfhrp2 , pfhrp3 , and their flanking genes were amplified by PCR to assess the pattern of the gene deletions. In addition, microsatellite analysis were performed using seven neutral microsatellites (MS) and five microsatellite loci flanking pfhrp2 . The data showed the absence of pfhrp3 gene in 53.76% (50/93) of the samples, reflecting a higher frequency than the proportion of pfhrp2 gene deletions (33.33%; 31/93). Among the flanking genes, the highest frequency of deletion was observed in the PF3D7_0831900 gene (78.49%; 73/93) for pfhrp2 . MS marker analysis showed the presence of 8 P . falciparum lineages. The lineage Bv1 was the most prevalent among parasites lacking pfhrp2 and pfhrp3 genes. Additionally, using MS flanking pfhrp2 gene, the haplotypes α and δ were found to be the most abundant in this region. This study confirms the presence in this area of field isolates with deletions in either pfhrp2 , pfhrp3 , or both genes, along with their respective flanking regions. Our data suggest that some pfhrp2/pfhrp3 deletion haplotypes, in special the lineage Bv1, are widely dispersed within the Peruvian Amazon. The persistence of these haplotypes ensures a proportion of P . falciparum parasites lacking the pfhrp2/pfhrp3 genes in this area, which ultimately leads to false-negative results on PfHRP2-detecting malaria RDTs. However, additional studies are needed to not only confirm this hypothesis but also to further delineate the origin and genetic basis for the pfhrp2- and pfhrp3 gene deletions in wild P . falciparum parasites."
https://openalex.org/W4309600469,"Background Little is known about olfactory changes in pediatric COVID-19. It is possible that children under-report chemosensory changes on questionnaires, similar to reports in adults. Here, we aim to describe COVID-19-related olfactory dysfunction in outpatient children. We hypothesized that children with COVID-19 will demonstrate abnormal olfaction on smell-identification testing at a higher rate than children with negative COVID-19 testing. Methods A prospective cross-sectional study was undertaken from June 2020—June 2021 at a tertiary care pediatric hospital. A consecutive sample of 205 outpatients aged 5–21 years undergoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) PCR testing were approached for this study. Patients with prior olfactory dysfunction were excluded. Participants were given a standard COVID-19 symptom questionnaire, a Smell Identification Test (SIT) and home-odorant-based testing within 2 weeks of COVID-19 testing. Prior to study enrollment, power calculation estimated 42 patients to determine difference in rates of SIT results between groups. Data were summarized with descriptive statistics. Results Fifty-one patients underwent smell identification testing (23 positive (45%) and 28 negative (55%) for COVID-19; mean age 12.7 years; 60% female). 92% of all patients denied subjective change in their sense of smell or taste but only 58.8% were normosmic on testing. There was no difference in screening questionnaires or SIT scores between COVID-19 positive and negative groups. Conclusions Unlike adults, there was no statistical difference in olfactory function between outpatient COVID-19 positive and negative children. Our findings suggest a discrepancy between objective and patient-reported olfactory function in pediatric patients, and poor performance of current screening protocols at detecting pediatric COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4309600489,"Hepatitis B viral infection (HBV) in prisons poses serious public health challenges because it significantly contributes to the increase in both morbidity and mortality indicators worldwide. Research has shown high HBV prevalence among inmates when compared to the general population. In this study, we estimated the prevalence of HBV exposure and its risk factors among 1,132 inmates detained in high security institutions. A cross-sectional, epidemiological study was carried out in 11 male-only prisons in the State of Paraná, Brazil, between May 2015 to December 2016. HBV exposure was explored using a variety of methods, including HBsAg, anti-HBs, and total anti-HBc. Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate techniques. The overall prevalence of HBV exposure was 11.9% (95% CI: 10.9-12.8), totaling 135 individuals. In the multivariate analyses, risk factors that remained statistically significant were related to the penitentiary location (Francisco Beltrão; OR = 5.59; 95% CI: 3.32-9.42), age (over 30 years; OR = 5.78; 95% CI: 3.58-9.34), undergoing tattooing procedures in prison (OR = 1.64; 95% CI: 1.03-2.60), self-reported sexual activities with a known drug user (OR = 1.67; 95% CI: 1.12-2.48) and having a history of previous history of hepatitis B or C infection (OR = 2.62; 95% CI: 1.48-4.64). The findings indicate that public policies-including vaccination, early diagnosis, harm reduction strategies, and adequate treatment-should be designed and delivered in the same way for both the incarcerated and the general population in order to reduce the prevalence of HBV and its associated consequences."
https://openalex.org/W4309600497,"To determine the course of treatment while considering the patients' desires, we examined trends regarding patients' perception and expectations over the course of cancer pharmacotherapy. We retrospectively reviewed interview sheets filled in by patients with advanced urogenital cancers when they started a new pharmacotherapy regimen between 2014 and 2020. The responses to the following questions were analyzed: 1) How did your doctor explain the treatment objectives?; 2) Are you willing to receive treatment?; and 3) When the standard treatment becomes difficult to continue, would you like to try another treatment even if it may cause severe side effects? A total of 277 patients answered the interview sheet. The percentage of patients who accurately perceived the treatment objectives among patients receiving 1st, 2nd, and 3rd line regimens was 67%, 79%, and 93%, respectively. The percentage significantly improved over the course of pharmacotherapy (p = 0.0057). The percentage of patients who indicated that they were willing to receive treatment in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd line regimens was 80%, 83%, and 86%, respectively. The percentage of patients who indicated that they wanted to try another treatment when the standard treatment became difficult to continue in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd line regimens was 56%, 64%, and 59%, respectively. The percentage of patients who accurately perceived the objective of pharmacotherapy increased over the course of pharmacotherapy. The rate of patients who were willing to receive treatment and try other treatments when the standard treatment became too difficult to continue remained consistently high."
https://openalex.org/W4309600584,"This study aimed to expand and inform the emerging body of research on the negative experiences of social media use among youths and how youths deal with them, in an Asian setting, using a qualitative approach.Data were collected using 11 focus group discussions (FGDs) and 25 semi-structured interviews (SIs) among youths aged 15 to 24 years residing in Singapore who were recruited via purposive sampling. Data were analysed using thematic analysis.The salient negative effects mentioned by participants include the development of negative reactions and feelings from upward comparisons with others (e.g., others' achievements and lifestyle), receiving hurtful comments, exposure to controversial content (e.g., political events and social movements), as well as the perpetuation of negative feelings, behaviours, and sentiments (e.g., rumination, unhealthy eating behaviour, and self-harm). Participants also described strategies which they have employed or deemed to be useful in mitigating the negative effects of social media use. These include filtering content and users, taking breaks from social media, cognitive reframing, and self-affirmation, where they identify and change stress-inducing patterns of thinking by setting realistic social, physical, and lifestyle expectations for themselves, and focusing on self-development.The current results highlight that while youths experience negative effects of social media use, they have high media literacy and have employed strategies that appear to mitigate the negative effects of social media use. The findings can inform various stakeholders involved in helping youths navigate the harms of social media use or provide directions for intervention studies aimed at reducing the harms of social media use."
https://openalex.org/W4309600589,"To limit an infectious outbreak, the public must be informed about the infection risk and be motivated to comply with infection control measures. Perceiving a situation as threatening and seeing benefits to complying may be necessary to motivate for compliance. The current study used a preregistered survey experiment with a 2-by-2 between-subject design to investigate if emphasizing high infection risk and appealing to societal benefits impacted intention to comply with infection control measures. The results from a representative Norwegian sample (N = 2533) show that describing a high (as opposed to low) personal risk scenario had a small main effect on compliance. Further, appealing to public (as opposed to self-interested) benefits also had a small main effect. There was no interaction between risk scenario and motivational emphasis. The results suggest that to maximize compliance, information about disease outbreak should emphasize the individual risk of contracting the disease, and could also underline the public value of limiting infection spread. These findings can inform health authorities about the motives underlying compliance with infection control measures during an infectious disease outbreak."
https://openalex.org/W4309600594,"Nudging is a method for eliciting a desired behavior. One approach to nudging involves information provision. When information presented for this purpose is designed from an evolutionary perspective, it may reveal a deeper level of rationality within human decision-making that might otherwise appear to be irrational. Based on insights from the evolution of altruism, we previously designed a message to remind people of the benefits they have received from the actions of relatives to realize industrialization. We then demonstrated that using this message in Japan was effective at moderating extreme risk-averse attitudes toward air pollution resulting from industrialization. However, the universality of the intervention effect, including whether it could be affected by exogenous factors, was not explored. Therefore, in the present study, we conducted a randomized controlled trial based on an online survey carried out in Japan, Canada, and the US. The intervention was shown to be effective in all the three countries, but the effect size varied according to segment. Although women showed more intervention effects than men in Japan and the US, no significant sex difference was observed in Canada. In terms of personality traits, higher agreeableness significantly contributed to the intervention effects. The influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, which necessitated many lifestyle changes, was found to weaken the intervention effect by increasing the message effect in the control group. We propose that this effect was caused by an increased perception of familial support in everyday life. These results suggest that the nudge message was universally effective, although the effect size might have been affected by cultural factors and social events."
https://openalex.org/W4309600608,"Several previous studies state that the Islamic Social Finance program has not fully succeeded in creating prosperity, and there are no definite measurements to show the sustainability impact of the program. Thus, a measurement is needed to analyze various aspects in achieving the success and sustainability of Islamic social finance programs. This study developed an index for performance evaluation with an emphasis on the success and sustainability of the Islamic Social Finance program. The study used the Analytical Network Process to determine and analyze priority components. Furthermore, the Multistage Weighted Index method was used to calculate the final index score. The index was built by taking into consideration various factors, stakeholders, aspects, and indicators. This study indicates that aspects of funding contribution from donors (0.22), involvement of donors in giving advice (0.99), and controlling of supervisor (0.08) are priority aspects in the success and sustainability of the program. An empirical investigation was performed on three different programs in Indonesia: A, B, and C. Program A (0.81) and C (0.80) have succeeded in improving the beneficiaries' quality of life to the level of economic resilience, although at a low level of sustainability (76-84.33). On the other hand, program B (0.73) is at the economic reinforcement and has not yet achieved sustainability. This index can be seen as a comprehensive tool for measuring the success and sustainability of the program at several levels."
https://openalex.org/W4309600612,"RB is a well-known cell cycle regulator controlling the G1 checkpoint. Previous reports have suggested that it can influence cell fate decisions not only by regulating cell proliferation and survival but also by interacting with transcription factors and epigenetic modifiers. However, the functional redundancy of RB family proteins (RB, RBL1 and RBL2) renders it difficult to investigate their roles during early development, especially in human. Here, we address this problem by generating human embryonic stem cells lacking RB family proteins. To achieve this goal, we first introduced frameshift mutations in RBL1 and RBL2 genes using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, and then integrated the shRNA-expression cassette to knockdown RB upon tetracycline treatment. The resulting RBL1/2_dKO+RB_iKD cells remain pluripotent and efficiently differentiate into the primary germ layers in vitro even in the absence of the RB family proteins. In contrast, we observed that subsequent differentiation into foregut endoderm was impaired without the expression of RB, RBL1 and RBL2. Thus, it is suggested that RB proteins are dispensable for the maintenance and acquisition of cell identities during early development, but they are essential to generate advanced derivatives after the formation of primary germ layers. These results also indicate that our RBL1/2_dKO+RB_iKD cell lines are useful to depict the detailed molecular roles of RB family proteins in the maintenance and generation of various cell types accessible from human pluripotent stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W4309600710,"Aberration of PI3K signaling pathway has been confirmed to be associated with several hematological malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). FD268, a pyridinesulfonamide derivative characterized by the conjugation of 7-azaindole group, is a newly identified PI3K inhibitor showing high potent enzyme activity at nanomole concentration. In this study, we demonstrated that FD268 dose-dependently inhibits survival of AML cells with the efficacy superior to that of PI-103 (pan-PI3K inhibitor) and CAL-101 (selective PI3Kδ inhibitor) in the tested HL-60, MOLM-16, Mv-4-11, EOL-1 and KG-1 cell lines. Further mechanistic studies focused on HL-60 revealed that FD268 significantly inhibits the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, promotes the activation of pro-apoptotic protein Bad and downregulates the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, thus suppressing the cell proliferation and inducing caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. The bioinformatics analysis of the transcriptome sequencing data also indicated a potential involvement of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. These studies indicated that FD268 possesses high potent activity toward AML cells via inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, which sheds some light on the pyridinesulfonamide scaffold for further optimization and investigation."
https://openalex.org/W4309600824,"Numerical solution of partial differential equations on parallel computers using domain decomposition usually requires synchronization and communication among the processors. These operations often have a significant overhead in terms of time and energy. In this paper, we propose communication-efficient parallel algorithms for solving partial differential equations that alleviate this overhead. First, we describe an asynchronous algorithm that removes the requirement of synchronization and checks for termination in a distributed fashion while maintaining the provision to restart iterations if necessary. Then, we build on the asynchronous algorithm to propose an event-triggered communication algorithm that communicates the boundary values to neighboring processors only at certain iterations, thereby reducing the number of messages while maintaining similar accuracy of solution. We demonstrate our algorithms on a successive over-relaxation solver for the pressure Poisson equation arising from variable density incompressible multiphase flows in 3-D and show that our algorithms improve time and energy efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W4309600908,"Well-established cognitive models coming from anthropology have shown that, due to the cognitive constraints that limit our ""bandwidth"" for social interactions, humans organize their social relations according to a regular structure. In this work, we postulate that similar regularities can be found in other cognitive processes, such as those involving language production. In order to investigate this claim, we analyse a dataset containing tweets of a heterogeneous group of Twitter users (regular users and professional writers). Leveraging a methodology similar to the one used to uncover the well-established social cognitive constraints, we find regularities at both the structural and semantic level. At the former, we find that a concentric layered structure (which we call ego network of words, in analogy to the ego network of social relationships) very well captures how individuals organise the words they use. The size of the layers in this structure regularly grows (approximately 2-3 times with respect to the previous one) when moving outwards, and the two penultimate external layers consistently account for approximately 60% and 30% of the used words, irrespective of the number of the total number of layers of the user. For the semantic analysis, each ring of each ego network is described by a semantic profile, which captures the topics associated with the words in the ring. We find that ring #1 has a special role in the model. It is semantically the most dissimilar and the most diverse among the rings. We also show that the topics that are important in the innermost ring also have the characteristic of being predominant in each of the other rings, as well as in the entire ego network. In this respect, ring #1 can be seen as the semantic fingerprint of the ego network of words."
https://openalex.org/W4309600910,"Rapid identification of potentially life-threatening blood stream infections (BSI) improves clinical outcomes, yet conventional blood culture (BC) identification methods require ~24–72 hours of liquid culture, plus 24–48 hours to generate single colonies on solid media suitable for identification by mass spectrometry (MS). Newer rapid centrifugation techniques, such as the Bruker MBT-Sepsityper ® IVD, replace culturing on solid media and expedite the diagnosis of BCs but frequently demonstrate reduced sensitivity for identifying clinically significant Gram-positive bacterial or fungal infections. This study introduces a protocol that utilises the broad-range binding properties of an engineered version of mannose-binding lectin linked to the Fc portion of immunoglobulin (FcMBL) to capture and enrich pathogens combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionisation time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS for enhanced infection identification in BCs. The FcMBL method identified 94.1% (64 of 68) of clinical BCs processed, with a high sensitivity for both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (94.7 and 93.2%, respectively). The FcMBL method identified more patient positive BCs than the Sepsityper ® (25 of 25 vs 17 of 25), notably with 100% (3/3) sensitivity for clinical candidemia, compared to only 33% (1/3) for the Sepsityper ® . Additionally, during inoculation experiments, the FcMBL method demonstrated a greater sensitivity, identifying 100% (24/24) of candida to genus level and 9/24 (37.5%) top species level compared to 70.8% (17/24) to genus and 6/24 to species (25%) using the Sepsityper ® . This study demonstrates that capture and enrichment of samples using magnetic FcMBL-conjugated beads is superior to rapid centrifugation methods for identification of BCs by MALDI-TOF MS. Deploying the FcMBL method therefore offers potential clinical benefits in sensitivity and reduced turnaround times for BC diagnosis compared to the standard Sepsityper ® kit, especially for fungal diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W4309655307,"Background Despite a well-established cervical cancer (CC) screening program in Norway, the incidence of CC in young women is increasing, peaking at 35 years of age. 25 percent of all women diagnosed with CC had normal cytology within 3 years prior to cancer diagnosis, addressing the need to improve the screening programme to further reduce cancer incidences missed by cytology. Objective We wanted to investigate the detection rate of CIN3+ in women 25–39 years with normal cytology by using a 3-type HPV mRNA test as a targeted quality assurance measure. The control group is women with normal cytology. Methods During 2014–2017, samples from 13,021 women 25–39 years of age attending cervical cancer screening were analysed at Nordlandssykehuset, Bodø, Norway, including 1,896 women with normal cytology and HPV mRNA test (intervention group), and 11,125 women with cytology only (control group). The HPV mRNA testing was performed using a 3-type HPV E6/E7 mRNA test (PreTect SEE; direct genotyping 16, 18 and 45). The women were followed-up according to national guidelines throughout December 2021. Results Of the 13,021 women, 429 women (3.3%) had CIN3+ confirmed by biopsy in the follow-up, including 13 cases of invasive cervical cancer. Of the 1,896 women with normal cytology and HPV mRNA test (intervention group), 49 women (2.6%) had a positive test. The risks of CIN3+ among women with either a positive or negative HPV mRNA test were 28.6% (14/49) and 0.8% (14/1847). None of the women in the intervention group developed cervical cancer during follow-up. Of the 11,125 women with cytology only (control group), 712 women (6.4%) had abnormal cytology (ASC-US+). The risks of CIN3+ among women with abnormal and normal cytology were 17.7% (126/712) and 2.6% (275/10,413). Conclusion By testing women 25–39 years of age with a normal cytology result using a specific 3-type HPV mRNA test, an increase in screening programme sensitivity can be achieved without an excessive additional workload. Women with normal cytology and a negative HPV mRNA test have a very low risk of cervical cancer."

Design This was a prospective and cross-sectional analysis of the sleep characteristics among early kidney transplant recipients through an objective and subjective measurement. Participants Patients with end stage renal disease on the transplant waiting list and after kidney transplantation were from a major organ transplantation center in Southern China (n = 83). Primary and secondary outcome measurements Objective outcomes: PSG, noise and light. Subjective outcomes: demographic and clinical questionnaires, self-reported pain and Richards Campbell sleep questionnaire (RCSQ). After agreement with the informed consent, participants first completed demographic and clinical questionnaires, then worn the PSG within 5–10 days after kidney transplantation. Both noise, light and self-reported pain were monitored during sleep. After completion of PSG, the RCSQs were filled out next morning. Results A total of 298 patients were recruited and 83 participants were finally analyzed. The total RCSQ mean score was 51.0±18.9mm. The prevalence of poor sleep quality among early KTRs was 45.1%. Most of PSG characteristics were significantly correlated with their corresponding RCSQ items. And the total RCSQ scores were significantly correlated with the number of awakenings, the N2 percentage and the total sleep time (r = 0.79, 0.47 and 0.40, P&lt;0.05) respectively. Noise was a statistically significant factor affecting the subjective sleep quality. Conclusions The sleep quality in early KTRs measured by both PSG and RCSQ exhibits consistency with each other. Sleep disruption always remains a substantial problem and is affected by self-reported noise among early KTRs. The RCSQ is easily applicable and interpretable so that it can be used for future daily clinical practice."

Gestational exposure to the air pollutant ozone is associated with fetal growth restriction in humans and rodents. However, the impact of this early life ozone exposure on offspring metabolic risk has not yet been investigated. In this study, fetal growth restriction was induced by maternal inhalation of 0.8 ppm ozone on gestation days 5 and 6 (4 hr/day) in Long Evans rats. To uncover any metabolic inflexibility, or an impaired ability to respond to a high-fat diet (HFD), a subset of peri-adolescent male and female offspring from filtered air or ozone exposed dams were fed HFD (45% kcal from fat) for 3 days. By 6 weeks of age, male and female offspring from ozone-exposed dams were heavier than offspring from air controls. Furthermore, offspring from ozone-exposed dams had greater daily caloric consumption and reduced metabolic rate when fed HFD. In addition to energy imbalance, HFD-fed male offspring from ozone-exposed dams had dyslipidemia and increased adiposity, which was not evident in females. HFD consumption in males resulted in the activation of the protective 5'AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPKα) and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) pathways in the liver, regardless of maternal exposure. Unlike males, ozone-exposed female offspring failed to activate these pathways, retaining hepatic triglycerides following HFD consumption that resulted in increased inflammatory gene expression and reduced insulin signaling genes. Taken together, maternal ozone exposure in early pregnancy programs impaired metabolic flexibility in offspring, which may increase susceptibility to obesity in males and hepatic dysfunction in females."
https://openalex.org/W4309667343,"Tooth loss is an oral health condition with high prevalence and negative impact on quality of life. It is the result of the history of oral diseases and their treatment as well as provision of dental care and access to dental services. Socioeconomic characteristics are determinants of tooth loss and living in rural areas is also a risk factor for its incidence.To identify contextual and individual factors associated with self-reported tooth loss among adults and elderly people living in rural riverside areas.A cross-sectional household-based survey was conducted in 2019 with rural riverside communities on the left bank of the Rio Negro River, Manaus, Amazonas. These communities are covered by a fluvial health team and two riverside health teams. Interviews were conducted in a representative random sample of dwellers aged ≥ 18 years, using electronic forms to obtain information on oral health conditions, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, and use of and access to health services. The outcome was self-reported tooth loss. After the descriptive analysis of the data, a multilevel Poisson regression analysis was performed to estimate the prevalence ratio for the outcome. Variables with p-value ≤0.20 in the bivariate analyses were included in the multiple analysis considering the hierarchy between individual and contextual variables in the multilevel model. Variables with p-value ≤0.10 were kept in the final model and the significance level adopted was 0.05.603 individuals from 357 households were assessed (mean age 44.1 years). The average number of missing teeth was 11.2 (±11.6); 27.4% of individuals had lost more than 20 teeth (non-functional dentition) and 12.1% were completely edentulous. Contextual characteristic of primary healthcare offered was associated with the outcome. The tooth loss was lower in territories covered by riverside health teams. At individual level, tooth loss was greater in older individuals who had experienced dental pain over the past six months and whose sugar consumption was high. Black or brown individuals, individuals whose household income was higher, those who were on the Bolsa Família cash transfer program, those who consulted a dentist over the past year, and those who reported satisfaction with their teeth/oral health reported less tooth loss.Tooth loss was associated with contextual territorial factors related to the healthcare service and individual demographic, behavioral, socioeconomic, and service-related characteristics as well as self-perceived oral health conditions. The findings suggest that actions focused on the oral health of these populations involve not only changes in the healthcare service organization, but also intersectoral policies that contribute to reducing social inequalities."
