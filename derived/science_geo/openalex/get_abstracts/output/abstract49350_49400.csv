https://openalex.org/W1968343429,"The primary structure of the major embryonic Notch transcript is presented, as determined by sequence analysis of overlapping cDNA clones. The 10,148 bp sequence corresponding to this transcript possesses an 8109 bp open reading frame that potentially codes for a 2703 amino acid protein. We show that this polypeptide contains a repeated structure composed of 36 tandemly arranged 40 amino acid long repeats, which show homology to the epidermal growth factor and other proteins containing EGF-like repeats. Hydropathy plots suggest that the putative Notch protein may span the membrane. We relate these findings to the developmental action of Notch and speculate that the locus may be involved in a cell-cell interaction mechanism that is essential for the differentiation of the ectoderm into neural and epidermal precursors."

https://openalex.org/W2018184392,"Fushi tarazu (ftz) is one of the Drosophila homeo-box-containing genes required to establish the segmental pattern. Ftz+ transcripts accumulate in cells that form seven equally spaced bands at the blastoderm stage. We have analyzed cis-acting controlling sequences of the ftz gene by germ line transformation. The functional ftz gene includes a transcription unit of 1.9 kb and approximately 6.1 kb of the 5'-flanking sequences. Fusion of the 5'-flanking sequences to the E. coli lacZ gene directs expression of beta-galactosidase in a ""zebra"" pattern in transformed embryos. The fusion gene is also expressed in certain neuroblasts that contribute to ganglion cells of all segments. Various morphogenetic controlling elements have been identified within the 5'-flanking sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2053352747,"engrailed is required to establish and maintain developmental compartments within each segment of the fly. To understand the role of the engrailed protein in this process, we have raised antibodies against engrailed and have visualized an engrailed protein in embryos by indirect immunofluorescence. The protein accumulates in the nucleus, supporting the notion that engrailed is a regulatory factor. The first pattern of expression is in alternating segments followed by expression in every segment, suggesting that engrailed may be responding to pair-rule segmengation gene products. Overall, engrailed protein levels peak in areas undergoing morphogenesis. Finally, the complex final form of the head and terminalia derive from earlier simple subdivision of these areas into developmental fields by engrailed."
https://openalex.org/W2086248637,"Developmental analysis of a newly isolated maternal effect grandchildless mutant, tudor (tud), in Drosophila melanogaster indicates that tud+ activity is required during oogenesis for the determination and/or formation of primordial germ cells (pole cells) and for normal embryonic abdominal segmentation. Regardless of their genotype, progeny of females homozygous for strong alleles (tud1 and tud3) never form pole cells, apparently lack polar granules in the germ plasm, and approximately 40% of them die during late embryogenesis exhibiting severe abdominal segmentation pattern defects. Females carrying weak allele, tud4, produce progeny with some functional pole cells and form polar granules approximately one-third the size of those observed in wild-type oocytes and embryos. No segmentation abnormalities are observed in the inviable embryos derived from tud4/tud4 females."

In vitro studies indicate that tissue plasminogen activator produced substantial lysis of clots at concentrations comparable to those expected in vivo, suggesting that this may be the mechanism of action of this drug. Drug-induced hemorrhages were not demonstrable. Tissue plasminogen activator may be of value for the immediate treatment of embolic stroke."
https://openalex.org/W1999702908,"The homeotic mutations in the right half of the bithorax complex of Drosophila cause segmental transformations in the second through the eighth segments of the fly. A chromosomal walk in the bithorax complex has now been extended 215 kb through the right half of the complex, and lesions for over 40 mutations have been located on the DNA map. The mutations can be grouped in a series of phenotypic classes, one for each abdominal segment, although each mutation typically affects more than one segment. The mutant lesions of each class are clustered, and they are aligned on the chromosome in the order of the body segments that they affect. Complementation tests suggest interactions between widely spaced DNA regions; indeed, the right half cannot be split anywhere without some loss of function."

https://openalex.org/W1576472122,"Abstract The base substitution fidelity of DNA polymerase-alpha, -beta, and -gamma (pol-alpha, -beta, and -gamma, respectively) has been determined in vitro, for all 12 possible mispairs at 96 sites in a forward mutational target. Averaging all errors over all known detectable sites, pol-gamma is the most accurate enzyme, producing one error for every 10,000 bases polymerized. Pol-beta is much less accurate, with an error rate of 1/1,500, while pol-alpha has an intermediate accuracy of 1/4,000. The relative differences in fidelity between the DNA polymerases are strongly influenced by the nature of the mispair. For example, G(template):dATP mispairs and G:dGTP mispairs are formed with about equal frequency by all three classes of DNA polymerases, yet pol-gamma produces T:dGTP mispairs at a 100-fold lower frequency than does pol-beta. The DNA polymerases exhibit distinct differences in template site preferences as well as substrate insertion preferences. The increase in accuracy apparent in proceeding from the least selective to the most accurate enzyme results primarily from a decrease in mispair formations at template A and T residues and a decrease in misinsertion of pyrimidine deoxynucleotides. These data clearly demonstrate a major role for eucaryotic DNA polymerases in modulating base mispair frequencies at the level of insertion. In addition to direct mispair formation due to an incorrect incorporation event, an examination of the errors produced by each of the three classes of DNA polymerases at two particular sites in the target sequence suggests that some base substitution errors result from transient misalignment of the primer-template. A model is presented to explain this phenomenon, termed Dislocation Mutagenesis. The data are discussed in relation to the extensive literature on base substitution errors and to the origin of spontaneous base substitutions in animal cells."
https://openalex.org/W1527237994,"Increased contractile activity of skeletal muscle augments the volume fraction and enzymatic capacity of mitochondria and suppresses the enzymatic capacity of several cytoplasmic enzymes of glycolysis. To examine the biochemical mechanisms underlying these effects, we measured the concentrations of cytochrome b mRNA and aldolase A mRNA in tibialis anterior muscles of adult rabbits that had been stimulated via the motor nerve to contract continuously at 10 Hz for 5 or 21 days; these were compared with the corresponding levels in the unstimulated limbs of the same animals. After 21 days of stimulation aldolase mRNA had fallen to one-fourth of control levels, while cytochrome b mRNA had increased by 5-fold. A reduction in aldolase mRNA was already evident after only 5 days of stimulation, whereas the level of cytochrome b mRNA was not elevated at this stage. Mitochondrial DNA was unchanged after 5 days but had increased by 4-fold after 21 days. We conclude that contractile activity in skeletal muscle produces reciprocal changes in the expression of these two genes at a transcriptional level but via different regulatory mechanisms. Enhancement of the expression of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene appears to be proportional to the increase in its copy number and may not, therefore, depend upon changes in transcriptional or translational efficiency. The reduction in aldolase A mRNA occurs at an earlier stage in the response to contractile activity and is probably mediated by a reduced transcriptional efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2000871658,"The bithorax complex of Drosophila is composed of three major units of gene function, Ultrabithorax (Ubx), abdominal-A (abd-A), and Abdominal-B (Abd-B), each having a precise realm of action within the thorax and abdomen. Recent molecular studies have established that the transcripts and protein products of the Ubx gene are expressed principally in a restricted portion of the body, beginning in the second thoracic segment and ending in the eighth abdominal segment (i.e., in parasegments 5-13). However, within this region, both show complex, heterogeneous patterns of expression. Using mutations in the abd-A, Abd-B, and esc (extra sex combs) genes we show that these distinct patterns result in large part from regulation of Ubx gene expression by the abd-A and Abd-B gene functions."

https://openalex.org/W1579659728,"In Xenopus oocytes ribosomal protein S6 becomes phosphorylated on serine residues in response to hormones or growth factors and following microinjection of the tyrosine-specific protein kinases associated with Rous sarcoma virus or Abelson murine leukemia virus. To begin characterization of the enzymes responsible for S6 phosphorylation in this system, we have undertaken the purification of S6 protein kinases from unfertilized Xenopus eggs. DEAE-Sephacel chromatography of crude extracts revealed two peaks of S6 kinase activity, and the peak eluting at 160 mM NaCl was chosen for further purification. Successive chromatography on Mono S, Sephacryl S-200, Mono Q, and heparin-Sepharose resulted in purification of the enzyme to a single protein migrating at Mr = 92,000 on polyacrylamide gels. The final preparation was purified about 500-fold from the DEAE-Sephacel peak with a recovery of 10%. Apparent Km values of the enzyme for ATP and 40 S subunits were 28 and 5 microM, respectively, and the specific activity with 330 microM ATP and 5.6 microM 40 S subunits was 300 nmol/min/mg. The enzyme was inhibited by beta-glycerophosphate, sodium fluoride, potassium phosphate, ADP, heparin, quercetin, and spermine. The availability of a purified S6 protein kinase should facilitate elucidation of the molecular mechanism of S6 phosphorylation during growth stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2063550395,"HnRNP particles are located at specific sites on nascent transcripts when chromatin is spread for electron microscopic visualization. To determine if the sequences bound by the particles play a role in RNA processing, we have correlated the nascent transcript morphology of Drosophila chorion s36-1 and s38-1 genes with their nucleotide sequences. We find that RNP particles about 25 nm in diameter are at the splice junctions of the introns in these two transcripts. On the more mature chorion transcripts, a single larger (40 nm) particle is occasionally seen in the same vicinity, which probably results from the coalescence of the two smaller particles. This RNP structure may be involved in bringing splice junctions into close proximity and in maintaining this proximity during the bipartite splicing intermediate stage."

https://openalex.org/W2032166136,"An inversion of chromosome 14, inv(14)(q11,q32), is frequently observed in human T cell tumors; the cytogenetic breakpoints are of interest because the T cell receptor alpha-chain and immunoglobulin heavy chain genes reside on chromosome bands 14q11 and 14q32, respectively. We have investigated the structure of the alpha-chain genes in a T cell line harboring the chromosome 14 inversion. On the normal chromosome 14, a V alpha segment has rearranged nonproductively with a J alpha segment. In contrast, the inverted chromosome features an unprecedented rearrangement in which an immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene segment (VH) on chromosome band 14q32 has joined with a J alpha segment from band 14q11. The VH-J alpha C alpha rearrangement is productive at the genomic level and therefore may encode a hybrid immunoglobulin/T cell receptor polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W2029858462,"We have found that ovulated mouse and rat oocytes contain tissue-type plasminogen activator (PA). Primary oocytes isolated from ovaries did not contain the enzyme. During spontaneous meiotic maturation in vitro, tissue-type PA became detectable 5 hr after germinal vesicle breakdown. Induction of tissue-type PA activity was blocked by dibutyryl-cAMP or isobutylmethyl-xanthine as well as by cycloheximide, but not by actinomycin D or alpha-amanitin. These results suggest that tissue-type PA mRNA is present in primary oocytes, and that translation of this mRNA is triggered upon resumption of meiotic maturation. Tissue-type PA catalyzed proteolysis around live secondary oocytes and fertilized eggs, indicating secretion of the enzyme. Unlike secondary oocytes, fertilized eggs denuded of their zona pellucida no longer contained the enzyme, suggesting that tissue-type PA production stops at or around fertilization, and that the bulk of the enzyme is secreted at this time."
https://openalex.org/W1526346617,"During the transition from the last feeding larval stage to the pupal stage of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, significant changes occur in the properties of lipophorin, the major hemolymph lipoprotein. Within the first 24 h after cessation of feeding, the larval lipophorin (HDLp-L) is first converted to a higher density form (HDLp-W2) and then HDLp-W2 is converted to a lower density form (HDLp-W1). HDLp-W1 remains in the hemolymph until pupation, when another form, HDLp-P, with a density between HDLp-W1 and HDLp-L, is present. Although all the lipophorins contain identical apoproteins, they differ in lipid content and composition; the differences in density being primarily related to diacylglycerol content. The conversion of HDLp-L to HDLp-W1 is accompanied by a loss of hydrocarbon and uptake of carotenes. These latter changes in lipophorin composition reflect alterations in cuticular lipid composition. HDLp-L was radiolabeled in the apoproteins by injecting animals with 3H-amino acids early in the last larval stage. Subsequently HDLp-L was isolated at the end of the larval stage, HDLp-W2 and HDLp-W1 were isolated during the wandering stage, and HDLp-P was isolated after pupation. The specific activity of the apoproteins in the four lipophorins was not significantly different, suggesting that the observed alterations in lipophorin properties do not require synthesis of new apoproteins but result from retailoring the lipid composition of preexisting molecules. Examination of the hemolymph of individual animals during these transitions showed that only one species of lipoprotein was present, never a mixture of two or more species. These observations suggest that the lipoprotein conversions are precisely timed and that lipoprotein metabolism during larval development and pupation cannot be considered a static process. The unique finding of these studies was that synthesis of lipophorin apoproteins proceeds actively during the first part of the fifth instar but then ceases and does not recommence during the wandering or early pupal stages."

https://openalex.org/W2025060557,"We have constructed and transformed into the D. melanogaster germ line a series of hsp26 deletion variants. We show that the region -728 to +14 contains all of the cis-acting sequences necessary for the developmental and heat-inducible transcription of hsp26. Sequences upstream of -341 are not required for heat-inducible expression but are required for ovarian expression. Conversely, sequences between -351 and -53 are unnecessary for ovarian expression but are needed for maximal heat-inducible expression. We conclude that most, or all, of the cis-acting regulatory sequences required for hsp26 gene expression during oogenesis are physically separable from those required for heat-inducible expression. These results suggest that different trans-acting factors bind at different regulatory sites in the 5'-flanking region of the gene, thus activating its transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2015967246,"The molecule is a glycoprotein expressed on T lymphocytes and has classically been considered a marker for the cytotoxic/suppressor T cell subset. It has been postulated to be a receptor for class I major histocompatibility complex proteins. We have used a cDNA clone encoding the analogous human protein, Leu-2/T8, to isolate mouse cDNA clones, which were used as probes to isolate mouse genomic clones. By transfection we have shown that the mouse homologue of Leu-2/T8 is Lyt-2 and not Lyt-3. We have further demonstrated that two Lyt-2 polypeptide chains are encoded by a single gene and result from alternative modes of mRNA splicing. The nucleotide sequence of cDNA clones encoding each of these polypeptide chains has been determined and shows the difference between the two Lyt-2 polypeptide chains to be in the lengths of their cytoplasmic tails."
https://openalex.org/W2081123727,"Cell surface Ia expression was examined following transfection of murine α and β class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes into L cells. Although haplotype-matched (e.g., AβkAαk) gene pairs yielded high expression in primary transfectants, haplotype-mismatched pairs (e.g., AβkAαd) gave unexpectedly low expression. RNA analysis revealed a requirement for greater Aβ, and particularly Aα transcript levels inhaplotype-mismatched vs. haplotype-matched transfectants with similar levels of membrane Ia. Aβ allelic control of this assembly/expression process was mapped to the NH2-terminal (β1) domain, the locus of high intraspecies polymorphism. These data on the effects of allelic variation on Ia levels provide a possible explanation for the strong linkage disequilibrium of Aα and Aβ genes and may account for the current molecular organization of the I region of the MHC."
https://openalex.org/W1504706920,"Cultured extrahepatic cells possess a specific high affinity binding site (receptor) for high density lipoprotein (HDL) that is induced by cholesterol delivery to cells. To characterize the binding recognition site(s) on HDL, the ability of HDL to interact with cultured human fibroblasts was assayed after chemical alteration of specific apoprotein amino acid residues. Reduction and alkylation, acetylation, and cyclohexanedione treatment of HDL3 had little or no effect on its cellular binding. Treatment of HDL3 with tetranitromethane (TNM), however, caused a large dose-dependent decrease in binding, with maximum inhibition at 3 mM. Amino acid analysis of the TNM-treated particles showed specific alteration of tyrosine residues, but sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis demonstrated apoprotein cross-linking coincident with decreased binding. These results suggest that modification of HDL tyrosine residues and/or cross-linking of HDL apoproteins alters the ligand site recognized by the HDL receptor. Gradient gel electrophoresis, molecular sieve chromatography, and electron microscopy showed only minor changes in size distribution and shape of HDL3 particles after treatment with 3 mM TNM, but at higher TNM concentrations, coalescence and aggregation of particles was evident. Treatment of HDL3 with 3 mM TNM affected neither its promotion of the low affinity (receptor-independent) cholesterol efflux from cells nor its ability to accept cholesterol from an albumin suspension, yet promotion of high affinity (receptor-dependent) cholesterol efflux from cells was abolished. The finding that TNM treatment of HDL3 decreases both its receptor binding and its promotion of cholesterol efflux from cells without substantial alteration of its physical properties supports the hypothesis that the HDL receptor functions to facilitate cholesterol transport from cells."
https://openalex.org/W1986121171,"We have introduced four point mutations into the 5' junction (GTATGT) and TACTAAC box of a yeast intron-containing gene coding for beta-galactosidase. To analyze quantitatively mutant combinations, we deliberately avoided nucleotides adjacent to the sites of cleavage (GTATGT) and lariat formation (TACTAAC) and chose positions with expected weak effects on splicing. All four mutants do not affect, or only marginally affect, gene expression. The levels of precursor RNA and intermediates indicate, however, that splicing efficiency is affected in all cases; the first stage of splicing, 5' cleavage and lariat formation, is reduced two to 15-fold in these four mutants. The mutants were combined to generate compensatory and noncompensatory double mutant combinations. No evidence for a specific base-pairing interaction between the 5' junction and TACTAAC box could be obtained. The results suggest that all conserved positions in the 5' junction and TACTAAC box play a role in splicing efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1514817439,"Actophorin is a new actin-binding protein from Acanthamoeba castellanii that consists of a single polypeptide with a molecular weight of 15,000. The isoelectric point is 6.1, and amino acid analysis shows an excess of acidic residues over basic residues. The phosphate content is less than 0.2 mol/mol. There is 0.4 +/- 0.1 mg of actophorin/g of cells, so that the molar ratio of actin to actophorin is about 10:1 in the cell. Unique two-dimensional maps of tryptic and chymotryptic peptides and complete absence of antibody cross-reactivity show that Acanthamoeba actophorin, profilin, capping protein, and actin are separate gene products with minimal homology. Actophorin has features of both an actin monomer-binding protein and an actin filament-severing protein. Actophorin reduces the extent of actin polymerization at steady state in a concentration-dependent fashion and forms a complex with pyrene-labeled actin that has spectral properties of unpolymerized actin. During ultracentrifugation a complex of actophorin and actin sediments more rapidly than either actin monomers or actophorin. Although actophorin inhibits elongation at both ends of actin filaments, it accelerates the late stage of spontaneous polymerization like mechanical shearing and theoretical predictions of polymer fragmentation. Low concentrations of actophorin decrease the length and the low shear viscosity of actin filaments. High concentrations cause preformed filaments to shorten rapidly. Ca2+ is not required for any of these effects. Muscle and amoeba actin are equally sensitive to actophorin."
https://openalex.org/W1606167126,"Hemolymph lipoproteins (lipophorins) of adult Manduca sexta are disinct from larval forms in density, lipid content, composition, and the presence of a third, low molecular weight apoprotein. Generally, only one lipoprotein species exists in M. sexta hemolymph during any given life stage. Progression through the life cycle results in alterations of existing lipoproteins to produce new forms, without new protein synthesis. The observed alterations in lipoprotein density could result from facilitated lipid transfer in insect hemolymph. An in vitro assay of facilitated lipid transfer was developed which employs a high density lipophorin from the wandering larva (density = 1.18 g/ml) as acceptor and adult low density lipophorin (density = 1.03 g/ml) as donor. Adult lipophorin-deficient hemolymph was shown to catalyze a time-dependent equilibration of the starting lipoproteins to produce a new intermediate lipophorin, Lp-I. Hydrodynamic experiments on the donor, acceptor, and product lipoproteins excluded fusion as the mechanism whereby Lp-I is produced. Thus, it is concluded that Lp-I results from facilitated net lipid transfer from low to high density lipoprotein. Furthermore, experiments conducted with radioiodinated donor and radioiodinated acceptor lipoproteins demonstrated that apoprotein exchange does not occur during the lipid transfer reaction. When donor lipoprotein was labeled in the lipid moiety with carbon-14, evidence of diacylglycerol and phospholipid exchange was obtained. Partial characterization of the lipid transfer factor revealed a relationship between incubation time, donor concentration, acceptor concentration, lipophorin-deficient hemolymph concentration, and transfer activity, as measured by Lp-I production. It is concluded that lipophorin-deficient hemolymph contains one or more factor(s) that catalyze net lipid transfer as well as diacylglycerol and phospholipid exchange between lipophorins to produce a single form at equilibrium."
https://openalex.org/W1548496772,"Abstract The chicken delta-crystallin locus consists of 2 nonallelic, tandemly arranged genes (5'-delta 1-delta 2-3'). Only the delta 1 gene is known to be expressed. The nucleotide sequence for the delta 1 gene has been reported recently (Nickerson, J.M., Wawrousek, E.F., Hawkins, J.W., Wakil, A.S., Wistow, G.J., Thomas, G., Norman, B.L., and Piatigorsky, J. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 9100-9105; Ohno, M., Sakamoto, H., Yasuda, K., Okada, T.S., and Shimura, Y. (1985) Nucleic Acids Res. 13, 1593-1606). We now report the sequence for the delta 2 gene and the 4-kilobase intergenic spacer between the two delta-crystallin genes. The delta 2 gene, like the delta 1 gene, has 17 exons and 16 introns. The homologous exons are remarkably similar: exons 3-17 are identical in size between delta 1 and delta 2, and the sequence homology ranges from 70% (exon 2) to 100% (exons 7, 12, and 15), with the remaining exons having 89-98% identity between the delta 1 and delta 2 genes. Consequently, the encoded delta 2 polypeptide is 91% identical to the delta 1 polypeptide. Considerable similarity also exists between homologous introns of delta 1 and delta 2, with most of the differences accounted for by insertions and/or deletions. The presence of a TATA box, consensus splice junctions (almost identical to the delta 1 gene), lariat branch sequences, and a polyadenylation signal strengthen the possibility that delta 2 is a functional gene."
https://openalex.org/W1531087684,"Protein synthesis was drastically inhibited in HeLa cells incubated for 5 min at 42.5 degrees C, but it resumed after 20 min at a rate about 50% that of control cells. After 10 min of heat shock, the binding of Met-tRNAf to 40 S ribosomal subunits was greatly reduced and a polypeptide identified by immunoprecipitation with the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor-2 (eIF-2) was phosphorylated. Extracts prepared from control and heat-shocked cells were assayed for in vitro protein synthesis. Both extracts were active when supplemented with hemin, but the extract from heat-shocked cells had little initiation activity without this addition. A Mr 90,000 polypeptide and eIF-2 alpha were phosphorylated in this extract, but hemin or an antibody which inhibits the protein kinase designated heme-controlled repressor reduced this phosphorylation. These findings implicated heme-controlled repressor as the kinase at least in part responsible for eIF-2 alpha phosphorylation. Furthermore, the initial inhibition of protein synthesis and eIF-2 alpha phosphorylation after heat shock were reduced by adding hemin to intact HeLa cells. These cells synthesized heat-shock proteins with some delay relative to cells without added hemin. The binding of Met-tRNAf to 40 S ribosomal subunits was inhibited by about 50% in extracts prepared from cells heat-shocked for 40 min, and eIF-2 alpha phosphorylation was increased in these cells. These results suggest that heme-controlled repressor is activated in heat-shocked cells and that eIF-2 alpha phosphorylation limits mRNA translation even after partial recovery of protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1558382700,"The messenger RNA cap-binding protein (CBP) was isolated from human erythrocyte, rabbit erythrocyte, and rabbit reticulocyte lysate by affinity chromatography on 7-methylguanosine 5'-triphosphate-Sepharose. The specific activity of binding to capped oligonucleotides was similar for the human erythrocyte and rabbit reticulocyte CBPs. Isoelectric focusing of human and rabbit preparations revealed that each was composed of up to five species. The pI values of human and rabbit CBPs ranged from 5.7 to 6.5. The predominant form in erythrocytes had a pI of 6.3 while in reticulocytes, two major species, having pI values of 5.9 and 6.3, were present. Labeling of rabbit reticulocytes with [32P]orthophosphate revealed that the pI 5.9 but not the pI 6.3 form contained phosphate. All of the phosphate was found in phosphoserine residues. The amino acid compositions of human erythrocyte and rabbit reticulocyte CBPs were quite similar. Both proteins had 7 tryptophanyl and 6 cysteinyl residues. Labeling with [1-14C]iodoacetic acid under native and denaturing conditions provided evidence that 2 of the cysteinyl residues are present in the reduced form and 4 in disulfide bridges. Species of CBP with faster or slower electrophoretic mobilities could be generated by treatment of the protein either with O2 in the presence of a catalyst or with dithiothreitol. The predominant form of the untreated protein migrated between these two forms."
https://openalex.org/W1590534911,"Methotrexate accumulation, subcellular distribution, metabolism, and cytotoxicity were studied in human epidermoid carcinoma (KB) cells that were exposed to a low extracellular concentration of methotrexate (25 nM) following culture in widely differing concentrations of folic acid. KB cells cultured in standard medium with a high folic acid concentration (2.3 microM) had high levels of cellular folate (21.4 pmol/10(6) cells). Five passages through low folate (2.7 nM) medium reduced the level of cellular folate to near physiologic levels (0.4-1.0 pmol/10(6) cells). In contrast to KB cells cultured in standard medium, in KB cells cultured in low folate medium, 1) methotrexate inhibited growth; 2) methotrexate uptake was markedly increased; 3) methotrexate polyglutamation was almost complete; 4) methotrexate binding to dihydrofolate reductase was markedly enhanced; and 5) significant methotrexate binding to a previously undescribed membrane-associated protein occurred. The amount of methotrexate bound to the membrane-associated protein from KB cells cultured in low folate medium equaled the quantities bound by dihydrofolate reductase. Further characterization of this membrane-associated protein indicated that it was soluble in solutions containing Triton X-100, was capable of binding folic acid as well as methotrexate, had an apparent Mr of 160,000 by gel filtration in the presence of Triton X-100, and was precipitated by antiserum to human placental folate receptor. This membrane-associated protein may play an important role in the uptake and metabolism of methotrexate under physiologic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W71984142,"Abstract The lipid binding properties of apolipoprotein (apo) AIMilano, a molecular variant of human apolipoprotein AI, characterized by the Arg173----Cys substitution, was investigated by the use of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine liposomes. Both the variant AIMilano and normal AI are incorporated to the same extent in stable complexes isolated by gel filtration, showing similar dimensions and stoichiometries. A higher affinity of apo-AIMilano for dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine is suggested by the faster association rate of the variant apoprotein compared to normal AI; similarly, apo-AIMilano is more readily displaced by guanidine hydrochloride from the isolated dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine-apoprotein complexes. When the secondary structure of apo-AIMilano was investigated by spectrofluoroscopy and circular dichroism, a higher fluorescence peak wavelength and a lower alpha-helical content were detected in the variant apoprotein compared to normal AI. The substitution Arg173----Cys in the AIMilano dramatically alters the amphipathic nature of the modified alpha-helical fragment of apoprotein AI. The association rate with lipids is accelerated by an increased exposure of hydrophobic residues. The reduced stability of the lipid-apoprotein particles is possibly mediated by a reduction in the number of helical segments involved in lipid association. The high flexibility of the AIMilano apolipoprotein in the interaction with lipids may explain its accelerated catabolism and the possibly improved uptake capacities for tissue lipids."
https://openalex.org/W1602374426,"Cultured cells of the higher plant Corydalis sempervirens Pers. which had been adapted to growing in the presence of 5 mM glyphosate (N-[phosphonomethyl]-glycine), a herbicide and a potent specific inhibitor of the shikimate pathway enzyme 5-enol-pyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase, had a nearly 40-fold increased level of the extractable activity of EPSP synthase. Activities of five other shikimate pathway enzymes were, however, similar in the adapted and nonadapted cells, and the concentrations of the free aromatic amino acids in the two cell lines were also similar. EPSP synthases purified from glyphosate-adapted, as well as nonadapted cells, had identical physical, kinetic, and immunological properties, which indicated that the glyphosate-sensitive enzyme was overproduced in the adapted culture. Overproduction of EPSP synthase in the adapted culture was unequivocally established by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as well as by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-gradient gel electrophoresis and quantitation of EPSP protein by immunoassay after transfer to nitrocellulose membranes. While about 0.06% of the total soluble protein from nonadapted cells was EPSP synthase protein, the proportion was 2.6% in the adapted cells. In vivo pulse-labeling experiments with [35S]methionine established that the adapted cells have an increased rate of EPSP synthase protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1519247927,"Presumptive evidence suggests that the brown fat mitochondrial uncoupling protein, thermogenin, is involved in the mechanism of stimulation of respiration by norepinephrine in the intact tissue. Conflicting data have been reported which suggest involvement of either adenine nucleotides, or fatty acids, or long chain acyl-CoA, or protons in the physiological regulation. We measured the electrical potential gradient across the mitochondrial membrane (delta psi m) in control cells and in cells stimulated with norepinephrine, using the accumulation of lipophilic cation, tetraphenylphosphonium, as an indicator of the potential gradient. The value of delta psi m in the cells in the control state is 116 mV, and in the hormonally stimulated state it is 56.6 mV. This supports the view that the protein is involved in the mechanism of hormone action. Other studies were designed to distinguish between the effects of fatty acids and ATP levels on the uncoupling protein in isolated mitochondria and in the adipocytes. ATP levels and fatty acid levels inside intact cells were independently varied using oligomycin or external fatty acids. Their effect on thermogenin was monitored as the capacity of the cells for reverse electron transport from durohydroquinone. The results suggest that ATP modulates the activity of thermogenin, while fatty acids can alter the relationship between ATP and thermogenin activity such that the protein appears to be activated at a higher cellular ATP level in the presence of fatty acids than in their absence."
https://openalex.org/W1522396495,"The COOH-terminal residue in peptide analogs of the phosphorylation site sequence in smooth muscle myosin light chains, Lys11-Lys12-Arg13-Ala-Ala-Arg16-Ala-Thr-Ser19 -(P)Asn20-Val21-Phe22-Ala23, were shown to have a strong influence on the kinetics of peptide phosphorylation. The peptides 11-19, 11-20, 11-21, 11-22, and 11-23 were all phosphorylated by the myosin light chain kinase with similar apparent Km values in the range 11-17 microM. The Vmax varied 40-fold, with the peptides 11-19, 11-20, 11-21, 11-22, and 11-23 having Vmax values of 0.035, 0.045, 0.32, 1.74, and 1.43 mumol X min-1 X mg-1 respectively. These results indicated that Ala23 was not essential whereas Phe22 and Val21 had a strong influence on the Vmax of peptide phosphorylation. This series of peptides competitively inhibited myosin light chain phosphorylation with Ki values similar to their respective Km values. Peptide 11-19 had a Ki value of approximately 10 microM and a Vmax less than 0.1% of the value with myosin light chains and is therefore an effective inhibitor of the smooth muscle myosin kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1592313469,"Hepatic cholesterol-epoxide hydrolase is a microsomal enzyme which appears to be catalytically distinct from the epoxide hydrolase responsible for the catabolism of a wide variety of aromatic and aliphatic epoxides. The diastereomeric forms of cholesterol epoxide, cholesterol 5 alpha,6 alpha-, and cholesterol 5 beta,6 beta-epoxides are converted to cholestane-3 beta,5 alpha,6 beta-triol with equal facility. Kinetic analysis of cholesterol-epoxide hydrolase demonstrated that both diastereomers bind to a common catalytic site. Apparent Km values of 3.69 and 4.42 microM were derived for cholesterol 5 alpha,6 alpha- and cholesterol 5 beta,6 beta-epoxide, respectively. In addition, enzyme activity with both diastereomers was product-inhibited by cholestanetriol through a competitive mechanism with the apparent Ki for cholestanetriol being 10.8 and 6.8 microM against cholesterol alpha- and beta-epoxides, respectively. This inhibitory effect of cholestanetriol may account for the difference observed in the hydration rates for the cholesterol epoxide isomers when they are incubated together in the presence of liver microsomes. Inhibitors of epoxide hydrolase were studied, and three oxidation products were found to be particularly effective against cholesterol-epoxide hydrolase while producing no significant inhibition of styrene-epoxide hydrolase. These inhibitors were 7-ketocholesterol, 6-ketocholestanol, and 7-ketocholestanol, the latter displaying an apparent Ki lower than the Km for either cholesterol epoxide isomer. None of the xenobiotic epoxide hydrolase inhibitors or activators studied affected cholesterol-epoxide hydrolase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2071452342,"Early embryonic development in Drosophila depends on genes expressed during oogenesis or after zygote formation. We show that the engrailed gene is needed for the processes that organize the embryo during the nuclear divisions that precede cellularization. During the precellular blastoderm stages engrailed mutant embryos show several notable anomalies: the pole cells form at a position slightly displaced from the posterior pole; yolk nuclei continue to divide after the tenth nuclear division cycle, when wild-type yolk nuclei have stopped dividing mitotically; and somatic nuclei are not positioned uniformly along the embryo periphery and do not undergo mitotic divisions in regular waves. This early requirement for engrailed does not appear to be a maternal function, and only genetically engrailed embryos displayed these precellular phenotypes. Synthesis of a 2.7 kb poly(A)+ transcript of the engrailed region was found in precellular embryos."
https://openalex.org/W1659847690,"Abstract The polypeptide product of the gene for the large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase from Euglena gracilis based on the DNA sequence of the chloroplast-encoded gene is described. The large subunit polypeptide of 475 codons is co-linear with the homologous polypeptides from other chloroplasts and cyanobacteria. The amino acid sequence is 92% homologous to that of Chlamydomonas, 84% homologous to spinach, 82% homologous to maize, and 80% homologous to that of the cyanobacterium Anabaena variabilis. Known functional domains of the protein are coded by the larger exons of the gene. Introns in the gene generally occur at coding sequences specifying hydrophilic, presumably surface exposed, regions of the polypeptide. The location of some of the introns may reflect a separation of functional domains. The 5'- and 3'-ends of the rbcL transcript were determined by primer extension sequencing using reverse transcriptase and S1 nuclease protection, respectively. The transcribed but untranslated sequences are quite distinct from those from other rbcL loci."
https://openalex.org/W126980359,"The amino acid residues of the light-harvesting protein B870-alpha of Rhodospirillum rubrum G-9+ that in the chromatophore membranes are in contact with the lipid phase were identified by hydrophobic photolabeling. Three reagents have been used which all contained the trifluoromethyldiazirinylphenyl group as a photo-sensitive precursor of a carbene but which otherwise differed in shape, molecular structure, and in the way they interact with membranes. 3-Trifluoromethyl-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine is a highly lipid-soluble compound, 11-[4-[(trifluoromethyl)diazirinyl]-phenyl]-[10-3H] 9-oxaundecanoic acid is an analogue of a fatty acid, and 1-palmitoyl-2-[11-[(trifluoromethyl)diaziri-nyl] phenyl]-[10-3H]9-oxaundecanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine one of a lecithin. Following labeling of chromatophores with these reagents, B870-alpha was isolated and subjected to (solid phase) Edman degradations in order to determine individual amino acid residues labeled. The main features of these results are as follows. 1) Labeling occurred both within the N-terminal segment (residues 1-8) and within the predominantly hydrophobic transmembrane stretch (residues 14-33). 2) Label distribution patterns within segments are indicative of helical structures to which the reagents had access to one face only of the cylindrical envelopes. 3) With regard to the transmembrane segment, the label distribution patterns were similar for all reagents whereas striking differences were noticed within the N-terminal portion. The labeling patterns are consistent with previous models proposing tight association of the transmembrane helix with that of the B870-beta chain. They also suggest that the N-terminal segment forms an amphipathic helix which interacts with the water-lipid interface of the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1526030514,"Studies were completed to examine the effects of the antineoplastic agent 5-Fluorouridine (FUrd) on the metabolism of the small molecular weight nuclear RNA (snRNA). Cultured Sarcoma-180 murine tumor cells were exposed to FUrd concurrent with [3H]cytidine for 6 h, the drug was removed, and the RNA was isolated at 0, 24, or 48 h following the drug treatment. The results of these studies demonstrated that FUrd produced three dose-dependent changes in snRNA metabolism. The electrophoretic migration of the U4 and U6 snRNA was altered in nondenaturing 10% polyacrylamide slab gels. These results were not observed in denaturing gels or when RNA was extracted at temperatures exceeding 25 degrees C, suggesting that the incorporation of 5-fluorouracil induced secondary structural changes in these RNA. A dose- and time-dependent selective reduction in the turnover of the U1 snRNA synthesized in the presence of FUrd was observed as well, with levels over 100% higher than control cells at 48 h after exposure to 10 microM FUrd. These changes in snRNA metabolism may contribute to the reported alterations in large molecular weight RNA metabolism that also result in fluoropyrimidine-treated cells, or to cytotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1479662782,"Rooster testis cells were separated by sedimentation at unit gravity and the in vivo levels of polymeric ADP-ribose were determined both in intact cells and isolated nuclei by fluorescence methods. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity was assayed after cell permeabilization or after isolation of nuclei. The turnover of ADP-ribosyl residues was determined in isolated nuclei using benzamide. The content of poly(ADP-ribose), the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity, and the turnover of ADP-ribosyl residues, decreased during the differentiation of the germinal cell line, especially at the end of spermiogenesis. Treatment of cells with 1 mM dimethyl sulfate for 1 h resulted in a marked stimulation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity in meiotic and premeiotic cells and also in round and late spermatids. The enzymatic activity was not detected and could not be induced in mature spermatozoa. These cells, however, still contained polymeric ADP-ribose with a 2% of branched form."
https://openalex.org/W1546449844,"The synthetic peptide, L-Val-L-Tyr-L-Pro-L-isoAsp-Gly-L-Ala, is a substrate for the erythrocyte and brain protein carboxyl methyltransferases. These enzymes catalyze the methyl esterification of the free alpha-carboxyl group of the isoaspartyl residue, to which the glycyl residue is linked through the side chain beta-carboxyl group. In this work, we show that the alpha-methyl ester of this peptide was rapidly demethylated (t1/2 = 4 min at 37 degrees C, pH 7.4) in erythrocyte cytosolic extracts and that the product of this reaction appears to be the succinimide ring derivative of the peptide. The rate of demethylation, measured at either pH 6.0 or 7.4, was the same in buffer and erythrocyte extracts, suggesting that succinimide formation was a nonenzymatic reaction. The L-succinimide is more stable than the ester, but can be hydrolyzed in buffer at pH 7.4 (t1/2 = 180 min at 37 degrees C) to give a mixture of about 75% isoaspartyl peptide and 25% normal aspartyl peptide. The metabolism of the succinimide hexapeptide in erythrocyte extracts appears to be more complex, however. The implications of this work for the methylation and demethylation of cellular proteins containing structurally altered aspartyl residues are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1667328849,"Abstract The completion of excision repair patches in human cells, following UV irradiation, was compared to the refolding of these regions into nucleosomes. Incomplete repair patches were detected by their enhanced sensitivity to exonuclease III. This enhanced sensitivity was due to the presence of gaps (or displaced parental strands) at the 3' end rather than unligated nicks, indicating that ligation occurs rapidly after repair synthesis is completed. Different rates of completion were achieved by treatment with the inhibitors hydroxyurea and sodium butyrate, as well as by using a (partially) ligase-deficient human cell strain. Hydroxyurea caused a marked decrease in both the rate of completion and the level of repair incorporation in all three cell types studied, while sodium butyrate yielded different effects in each cell type. In each case, however, a decrease in the rate of repair patch completion resulted in a concomitant decrease in the level of nucleosome formation. To determine the temporal relationship of these two events, the levels of repair-incorporated nucleotides in isolated 146-base pair nucleosome core DNA were compared on native and denaturing gels. The data indicate that little (or no) nucleosome formation occurred in the nascent DNA regions prior to ligation regardless of the cell type or treatment used. Furthermore, comparison of the fraction of unligated repair patches and the fraction of repair patches in a nonnucleosomal state indicated that in the absence of inhibitors there was a significant time lag between ligation and nucleosome formation. This lag time, however, decreased when cells were treated with hydroxyurea. Thus, the formation of nucleosomes in newly repaired regions of DNA occurred after the ligation step in all cases and these two features of the excision repair process are not tightly coupled events."

https://openalex.org/W1522751843,"The primary structure of the procoagulant- and prothrombin-binding domains, the 43- and 30-kDa fragments previously isolated from staphylocoagulase, has been determined by sequencing peptides derived from various chemical (CNBr and 2-(2-nitrophenylsulfenyl)-3-methyl-3-bromoindolenine) and enzymatic (trypsin and alpha-chymotrypsin) cleavages. Carboxypeptidase Y was also used to deduce the COOH-terminal sequence. The 43-kDa fragment contained 324 amino acids and had a calculated molecular weight of 38,098. It included the entire structure of the 30-kDa fragment located in the COOH-terminal portion (positions 126-324). The 43-kDa fragment had an unusual amino acid composition based on the sequence, in which the sum of Asp (28 residues), Asn (22), Glu (35), Gln (9), and Lys (52) residues accounted for more than 45% of the total. In addition, the frequent occurrence of repetitions of the various kinds of dipeptides was found along the whole sequence. Structural comparison of the NH2-terminal portion of the 43-kDa fragment of staphylocoagulase with that of streptokinase did not reveal any obvious sequence homologies. There was also no sequence homology with that of trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin, and elastase."
https://openalex.org/W1488424615,"The import of the precursor of mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase was reconstituted in vitro with isolated mitochondria thus corroborating the earlier conclusion of a post-translational uptake. The higher Mr precursor was synthesized in a reticulocyte lysate programmed with free polysomes from chicken liver. After incubation with intact mitochondria from chicken heart about 50% of the precursor was converted to the mature form in a time-dependent process, its rate being a function of the amount of mitochondria added. The same amount of precursor was processed to the mature form on addition of a mitochondrial extract. No conversion to the mature enzyme took place when the precursor was incubated with intact mitochondria in the presence of the uncoupling agent carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone or of the chelator o-phenanthroline which penetrates the mitochondrial inner membrane. In contrast, the chelator bathophenanthroline disulfonate which does not diffuse into the mitochondrial matrix did not inhibit the appearance of the mature form. The results indicate that that precursor must pass through an energized inner mitochondrial membrane before it is processed by a chelator-sensitive protease in the mitochondrial matrix. Excess mature mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase did not compete with the precursor for its uptake into mitochondria. Mature mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase is an alpha 2-dimer with Mr = 2 X 45,000. Both the precursor synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate and the precursor accumulated in the cytosol of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone-treated chicken embryo fibroblasts were found to exist as homodimer or hetero-oligomer and high Mr complexes (Mr greater than 300,000)."
https://openalex.org/W1540752727,"The regulatory effects of alpha-ketoisovalerate on purified bovine heart pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and endogenous pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase were investigated. Incubation of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex with 0.125 to 10 mM alpha-ketoisovalerate caused an initial lag in enzymatic activity, followed by a more linear but inhibited rate of NADH production. Incubation with 0.0125 or 0.05 mM alpha-ketoisovalerate caused pyruvate dehydrogenase inhibition, but did not cause the initial lag in pyruvate dehydrogenase activity. Gel electrophoresis and fluorography demonstrated the incorporation of acyl groups from alpha-keto[2-14C]isovalerate into the dihydrolipoyl transacetylase component of the enzyme complex. Acylation was prevented by pyruvate and by arsenite plus NADH. Endogenous pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase activity was stimulated specifically by K+, in contrast to previous reports, and kinase stimulation by K+ correlated with pyruvate dehydrogenase inactivation. Maximum kinase activity in the presence of K+ was inhibited 62% by 0.1 mM thiamin pyrophosphate, but was inhibited only 27% in the presence of 0.1 mM thiamin pyrophosphate and 0.1 mM alpha-ketoisovalerate. Pyruvate did not affect kinase inhibition by thiamin pyrophosphate at either 0.05 or 2 mM. The present study demonstrates that alpha-ketoisovalerate acylates heart pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and suggests that acylation prevents thiamin pyrophosphate-mediated kinase inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1482951869,"Glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase has been purified from the post-microsomal supernatant of cocoa seeds using differential ammonium sulfate solubility along with anion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. Chromatofocusing and isoelectric focusing revealed a series of proteins with acyltransferase activity having isoelectric points close to 5.2. Gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300 in 500 mM NaCl, along with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (denaturing and non-denaturing) and immunochemical analysis, gave evidence that the native enzyme has a molecular weight of 2 X 10(5) and consists of an aggregate of 10 Mr 20,000 subunits. The highly purified enzyme carries an acyl donor, probably acyl-CoA, although this is not firmly established. The hydrophobic nature of the purified enzyme was demonstrated by its firm binding to octyl-Sepharose. Mass spectrometric analysis of reaction products revealed the presence of both palmitic and stearic acids. Considering that 1) the fatty acids were derived from the purified enzyme; 2) they were found exclusively in the 1-position of glycerol 3-phosphate; 3) the fatty acid positioning and composition is consistent with that found in cocoa butter, the major storage product of cocoa seeds; and 4) the enzyme is found in the post-microsomal supernatant, it seems reasonable to conclude that the first step in cocoa butter biosynthesis is catalyzed by glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase in the cytoplasm of cocoa cotyledon cells."
https://openalex.org/W2143258122,"A recent report by Lyttle et al. (Lyttle, C. R., Medlock, R. L., and Sheehan, D. M. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 2697-2700) suggested that nuclear type II sites in the rat uterus are of eosinophil origin and may represent [3H]estradiol binding to eosinophil peroxidase. To further evaluate this hypothesis we examined the response of nuclear type II sites to estrogen under conditions where eosinophils are not present. Results of our experiments show that physiological levels of estradiol-17 beta (10 nM for 72 h) will stimulate nuclear type II sites in highly purified cultures (21-25 days; 4 passages) of rat uterine stromal and myometrial cells. The magnitude of the response of type II sites to estradiol in these stromal (4-fold) and myometrial (80-fold) cell cultures was essentially identical to that observed in the uterine cell types following in vivo estrogen treatment. Since these highly purified cultures of uterine cells were prepared from the uterus of a 21-day ovariectomized rat which is devoid of eosinophils, we conclude that estradiol stimulation of nuclear type II sites is a direct intracellular response to estrogen which occurs independent of eosinophil accumulation. Furthermore, we have found that type II sites in the rat uterus are not peroxidase. This was demonstrated by experiments which show type II sites are present in the 39,000 X g supernatant fraction of uterine cytosol, whereas peroxidase activity is quantitatively recovered in the crude mitochondrial (39,000 X g) pellet. Likewise, the small amount of peroxidase activity (approximately 10%) in the total homogenate which contaminates our nuclear pellet preparations was extracted (98-100%) with 0.5 M CaCl2. Type II estrogen-binding sites (95-100%) remained associated with the nuclear pellet fraction after peroxidase extraction. Therefore, stimulation of cytosol and nuclear type II sites by estrogen in the rat uterus is a direct intracellular response to the hormone unrelated to eosinophil accumulation and/or peroxidase activity."

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed an apparent subunit molecular weight of 17,500, but the enzyme was highly aggregated (Mr greater than 450,000) in nondenaturing gels containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The protein band in nondenaturing gels was also stained for activity using NADH and nitro blue tetrazolium. The enzyme showed greatest electron acceptor activity with ferricyanide (100%), followed by cytochrome c (3.5%), dichloroindophenol (2.7%), and cytochrome b5 (0.34%). No activity was seen with oxygen. The Km values for NADH and ferricyanide were 18 and 9.5 microM, respectively, and NAD+ was a weak competitive inhibitor (Ki = 118 microM). No activity was seen with NADPH. No effects were seen with mitochondrial respiratory inhibitors such as azide, cyanide, or rotenone, but p-chloromercuribenzoate was strongly inhibitory and N-ethylmaleimide was weakly inhibitory. No free flavin was detectable in enzyme preparations. Based upon kinetic, physical, and inhibition properties, this NADH dehydrogenase differs from those previously described in microsomes and erythrocyte plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1566103067,"Abstract We describe a unique DNA element with structural features of a processed pseudogene but with important differences. It is located within an 8.4-kilobase pair region of chicken DNA containing five histone genes, but it is not related to these genes. The presence of terminal repeats, an open reading frame (and stop codon), polyadenylation/processing signal, and a poly(A) rich region about 20 bases 3' to this, together with a lack of 5' promoter motifs all suggest a processed pseudogene. However, no parent gene can be detected in the genome by Southern blotting experiments and, in addition, codon boundary values and mid-base correlations are not consistent with a protein coding region of a eukaryotic gene. The element was detected in DNA from different chickens and in peafowl, but not in quail, pheasant, or turkey."
