https://openalex.org/W2140637559,"The NOD-like receptor (NLR) family, pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a component of the inflammatory process, and its aberrant activation is pathogenic in inherited disorders such as cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS) and complex diseases such as multiple sclerosis, type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis. We describe the development of MCC950, a potent, selective, small-molecule inhibitor of NLRP3. MCC950 blocked canonical and noncanonical NLRP3 activation at nanomolar concentrations. MCC950 specifically inhibited activation of NLRP3 but not the AIM2, NLRC4 or NLRP1 inflammasomes. MCC950 reduced interleukin-1β (IL-1β) production in vivo and attenuated the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a disease model of multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, MCC950 treatment rescued neonatal lethality in a mouse model of CAPS and was active in ex vivo samples from individuals with Muckle-Wells syndrome. MCC950 is thus a potential therapeutic for NLRP3-associated syndromes, including autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases, and a tool for further study of the NLRP3 inflammasome in human health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2081262717,"Ketone bodies are elevated in response to fasting, a low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet or high-intensity exercise. Vishwa Deep Dixit and colleagues report that one metabolite, β-hydroxybutyrate, inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome. In vivo, β-hydroxybutyrate is anti-inflammatory and suppresses NLRP3-mediated inflammatory disease. The ketone bodies β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and acetoacetate (AcAc) support mammalian survival during states of energy deficit by serving as alternative sources of ATP1. BHB levels are elevated by starvation, caloric restriction, high-intensity exercise, or the low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet2. Prolonged fasting reduces inflammation; however, the impact that ketones and other alternative metabolic fuels produced during energy deficits have on the innate immune response is unknown2,3,4,5,6. We report that BHB, but neither AcAc nor the structurally related short-chain fatty acids butyrate and acetate, suppresses activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in response to urate crystals, ATP and lipotoxic fatty acids. BHB did not inhibit caspase-1 activation in response to pathogens that activate the NLR family, CARD domain containing 4 (NLRC4) or absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome and did not affect non-canonical caspase-11, inflammasome activation. Mechanistically, BHB inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome by preventing K+ efflux and reducing ASC oligomerization and speck formation. The inhibitory effects of BHB on NLRP3 are not dependent on chirality or starvation-regulated mechanisms like AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), reactive oxygen species (ROS), autophagy or glycolytic inhibition. BHB blocks the NLRP3 inflammasome without undergoing oxidation in the TCA cycle, and independently of uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2), sirtuin-2 (SIRT2), the G protein–coupled receptor GPR109A or hydrocaboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2). BHB reduces NLRP3 inflammasome–mediated interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 production in human monocytes. In vivo, BHB or a ketogenic diet attenuates caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion in mouse models of NLRP3-mediated diseases such as Muckle–Wells syndrome, familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome and urate crystal–induced peritonitis. Our findings suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of caloric restriction or ketogenic diets may be linked to BHB-mediated inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome."

https://openalex.org/W2048122601,"Ovarian tumors with common mutations in the epigenetic regulator ARID1A are shown to be sensitive to inhibition of EZH2, another epigenetic regulator, showing a synthetic lethality that could potentially be exploited therapeutically The gene encoding ARID1A, a chromatin remodeler, shows one of the highest mutation rates across many cancer types. Notably, ARID1A is mutated in over 50% of ovarian clear cell carcinomas, which currently have no effective therapy. To date, clinically applicable targeted cancer therapy based on ARID1A mutational status has not been described. Here we show that inhibition of the EZH2 methyltransferase acts in a synthetic lethal manner in ARID1A-mutated ovarian cancer cells and that ARID1A mutational status correlated with response to the EZH2 inhibitor. We identified PIK3IP1 as a direct target of ARID1A and EZH2 that is upregulated by EZH2 inhibition and contributed to the observed synthetic lethality by inhibiting PI3K–AKT signaling. Importantly, EZH2 inhibition caused regression of ARID1A-mutated ovarian tumors in vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first data set to demonstrate a synthetic lethality between ARID1A mutation and EZH2 inhibition. Our data indicate that pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 represents a novel treatment strategy for cancers involving ARID1A mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2035905956,"N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) has been recently identified as a conserved epitranscriptomic modification of eukaryotic mRNAs, but its features, regulatory mechanisms, and functions in cell reprogramming are largely unknown. Here, we report m(6)A modification profiles in the mRNA transcriptomes of four cell types with different degrees of pluripotency. Comparative analysis reveals several features of m(6)A, especially gene- and cell-type-specific m(6)A mRNA modifications. We also show that microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate m(6)A modification via a sequence pairing mechanism. Manipulation of miRNA expression or sequences alters m(6)A modification levels through modulating the binding of METTL3 methyltransferase to mRNAs containing miRNA targeting sites. Increased m(6)A abundance promotes the reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to pluripotent stem cells; conversely, reduced m(6)A levels impede reprogramming. Our results therefore uncover a role for miRNAs in regulating m(6)A formation of mRNAs and provide a foundation for future functional studies of m(6)A modification in cell reprogramming."
https://openalex.org/W2009490810,"The essential autophagy mediator ATG14 promotes vesicle fusion by forming homo-oligomers, which bind to a component of the SNARE membrane fusion complex and stabilize this complex on autophagosomes. During the process of autophagy, cells break down their own components and sequester them in specialized vesicles called autophagosomes, which eventually fuse with lysosomes for degradation of their content. Membrane fusion is an important event not only during early biogenesis of autophagosomal vesicles but also when autophagosomes unite with lysosomes. Qing Zhong and colleagues show here that the essential autophagy mediator ATG14 promotes vesicle fusion by forming homo-oligomers, which bind to a component of the SNARE membrane fusion complex and stabilize this complex on autophagosomes. Autophagy, an important catabolic pathway implicated in a broad spectrum of human diseases, begins by forming double membrane autophagosomes that engulf cytosolic cargo and ends by fusing autophagosomes with lysosomes for degradation1,2. Membrane fusion activity is required for early biogenesis of autophagosomes and late degradation in lysosomes3,4,5,6,7. However, the key regulatory mechanisms of autophagic membrane tethering and fusion remain largely unknown. Here we report that ATG14 (also known as beclin-1-associated autophagy-related key regulator (Barkor) or ATG14L), an essential autophagy-specific regulator of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex8,9,10,11, promotes membrane tethering of protein-free liposomes, and enhances hemifusion and full fusion of proteoliposomes reconstituted with the target (t)-SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) syntaxin 17 (STX17) and SNAP29, and the vesicle (v)-SNARE VAMP8 (vesicle-associated membrane protein 8). ATG14 binds to the SNARE core domain of STX17 through its coiled-coil domain, and stabilizes the STX17–SNAP29 binary t-SNARE complex on autophagosomes. The STX17 binding, membrane tethering and fusion-enhancing activities of ATG14 require its homo-oligomerization by cysteine repeats. In ATG14 homo-oligomerization-defective cells, autophagosomes still efficiently form but their fusion with endolysosomes is blocked. Recombinant ATG14 homo-oligomerization mutants also completely lose their ability to promote membrane tethering and to enhance SNARE-mediated fusion in vitro. Taken together, our data suggest an autophagy-specific membrane fusion mechanism in which oligomeric ATG14 directly binds to STX17–SNAP29 binary t-SNARE complex on autophagosomes and primes it for VAMP8 interaction to promote autophagosome–endolysosome fusion."
https://openalex.org/W1985734261,"Selective macroautophagy is an important protective mechanism against diverse cellular stresses. In contrast to the well-characterized starvation-induced autophagy, the regulation of selective autophagy is largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Huntingtin, the Huntington disease gene product, functions as a scaffold protein for selective macroautophagy but it is dispensable for non-selective macroautophagy. In Drosophila, Huntingtin genetically interacts with autophagy pathway components. In mammalian cells, Huntingtin physically interacts with the autophagy cargo receptor p62 to facilitate its association with the integral autophagosome component LC3 and with Lys-63-linked ubiquitin-modified substrates. Maximal activation of selective autophagy during stress is attained by the ability of Huntingtin to bind ULK1, a kinase that initiates autophagy, which releases ULK1 from negative regulation by mTOR. Our data uncover an important physiological function of Huntingtin and provide a missing link in the activation of selective macroautophagy in metazoans."
https://openalex.org/W2103393606,"Enhancers regulate spatiotemporal gene expression and impart cell-specific transcriptional outputs that drive cell identity. Super-enhancers (SEs), also known as stretch-enhancers, are a subset of enhancers especially important for genes associated with cell identity and genetic risk of disease. CD4(+) T cells are critical for host defence and autoimmunity. Here we analysed maps of mouse T-cell SEs as a non-biased means of identifying key regulatory nodes involved in cell specification. We found that cytokines and cytokine receptors were the dominant class of genes exhibiting SE architecture in T cells. Nonetheless, the locus encoding Bach2, a key negative regulator of effector differentiation, emerged as the most prominent T-cell SE, revealing a network in which SE-associated genes critical for T-cell biology are repressed by BACH2. Disease-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms for immune-mediated disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis, were highly enriched for T-cell SEs versus typical enhancers or SEs in other cell lineages. Intriguingly, treatment of T cells with the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor tofacitinib disproportionately altered the expression of rheumatoid arthritis risk genes with SE structures. Together, these results indicate that genes with SE architecture in T cells encompass a variety of cytokines and cytokine receptors but are controlled by a 'guardian' transcription factor, itself endowed with an SE. Thus, enumeration of SEs allows the unbiased determination of key regulatory nodes in T cells, which are preferentially modulated by pharmacological intervention."

https://openalex.org/W2015781356,"The ubiquitin-like molecule ATG12 is required for the early steps of autophagy. Recently, we identified ATG3, the E2-like enzyme required for LC3 lipidation during autophagy, as an ATG12 conjugation target. Here, we demonstrate that cells lacking ATG12–ATG3 have impaired basal autophagic flux, accumulation of perinuclear late endosomes, and impaired endolysosomal trafficking. Furthermore, we identify an interaction between ATG12–ATG3 and the ESCRT-associated protein Alix (also known as PDCD6IP) and demonstrate that ATG12–ATG3 controls multiple Alix-dependent processes including late endosome distribution, exosome biogenesis and viral budding. Similar to ATG12–ATG3, Alix is functionally required for efficient basal, but not starvation-induced, autophagy. Overall, these results identify a link between the core autophagy and ESCRT machineries and uncover a role for ATG12–ATG3 in late endosome function that is distinct from the canonical role of either ATG in autophagosome formation. Debnath and colleagues report that the E2-like enzyme ATG3 is a target for ATG12 conjugation. ATG12–ATG3 conjugates interact with the ESCRT-associated protein Alix and regulate late endosome localization and exosome biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2086224292,"The proliferation of genetically modified mouse models has exposed phenotypic variation between investigators and institutions that has been challenging to control. In many cases, the microbiota is the presumed cause of the variation. Current solutions to account for phenotypic variability include littermate and maternal controls or defined microbial consortia in gnotobiotic mice. In conventionally raised mice, the microbiome is transmitted from the dam. Here we show that microbially driven dichotomous faecal immunoglobulin-A (IgA) levels in wild-type mice within the same facility mimic the effects of chromosomal mutations. We observe in multiple facilities that vertically transmissible bacteria in IgA-low mice dominantly lower faecal IgA levels in IgA-high mice after co-housing or faecal transplantation. In response to injury, IgA-low mice show increased damage that is transferable by faecal transplantation and driven by faecal IgA differences. We find that bacteria from IgA-low mice degrade the secretory component of secretory IgA as well as IgA itself. These data indicate that phenotypic comparisons between mice must take into account the non-chromosomal hereditary variation between different breeders. We propose faecal IgA as one marker of microbial variability and conclude that co-housing and/or faecal transplantation enables analysis of progeny from different dams."
https://openalex.org/W2013733230,"Although recent studies have shown that adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing occurs in microRNAs (miRNAs), its effects on tumour growth and metastasis are not well understood. We present evidence of CREB-mediated low expression of ADAR1 in metastatic melanoma cell lines and tumour specimens. Re-expression of ADAR1 resulted in the suppression of melanoma growth and metastasis in vivo. Consequently, we identified three miRNAs undergoing A-to-I editing in the weakly metastatic melanoma but not in strongly metastatic cell lines. One of these miRNAs, miR-455-5p, has two A-to-I RNA-editing sites. The biological function of edited miR-455-5p is different from that of the unedited form, as it recognizes a different set of genes. Indeed, wild-type miR-455-5p promotes melanoma metastasis through inhibition of the tumour suppressor gene CPEB1. Moreover, wild-type miR-455 enhances melanoma growth and metastasis in vivo, whereas the edited form inhibits these features. These results demonstrate a previously unrecognized role for RNA editing in melanoma progression. Bar-Eli and colleagues report that CREB-mediated downregulation of the RNA-editing enzyme ADAR1 results in decreased adenosine-to-inosine editing of miR-455-5p, which enhances melanoma growth and metastasis."

https://openalex.org/W2124411878,"Conventional T (Tcon) cells and Foxp3+ T-regulatory (Treg) cells are thought to have differing metabolic requirements, but little is known of mitochondrial functions within these cell populations in vivo. In murine studies, we found that activation of both Tcon and Treg cells led to myocyte enhancer factor 2 (Mef2)-induced expression of genes important to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Inhibition of OXPHOS impaired both Tcon and Treg cell function compared to wild-type cells but disproportionally affected Treg cells. Deletion of Pgc1α or Sirt3, which are key regulators of OXPHOS, abrogated Treg-dependent suppressive function and impaired allograft survival. Mef2 is inhibited by histone/protein deacetylase-9 (Hdac9), and Hdac9 deletion increased Treg suppressive function. Hdac9-/- Treg showed increased expression of Pgc1α and Sirt3, and improved mitochondrial respiration, compared to wild-type Treg cells. Our data show that key OXPHOS regulators are required for optimal Treg function and Treg-dependent allograft acceptance. These findings provide a novel approach to increase Treg function and give insights into the fundamental mechanisms by which mitochondrial energy metabolism regulates immune cell functions in vivo.—Beier, U.

https://openalex.org/W1966737051,"Aging is a complex process that affects multiple organs. Modeling aging and age-related diseases in the lab is challenging because classical vertebrate models have relatively long lifespans. Here, we develop the first platform for rapid exploration of age-dependent traits and diseases in vertebrates, using the naturally short-lived African turquoise killifish. We provide an integrative genomic and genome-editing toolkit in this organism using our de-novo-assembled genome and the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. We mutate many genes encompassing the hallmarks of aging, and for a subset, we produce stable lines within 2-3 months. As a proof of principle, we show that fish deficient for the protein subunit of telomerase exhibit the fastest onset of telomere-related pathologies among vertebrates. We further demonstrate the feasibility of creating specific genetic variants. This genome-to-phenotype platform represents a unique resource for studying vertebrate aging and disease in a high-throughput manner and for investigating candidates arising from human genome-wide studies."
https://openalex.org/W2001868230,"The present study was designed to investigate the effects of cold on brown adipose tissue (BAT) energy substrate utilization in vivo using the positron emission tomography tracers [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (glucose uptake), 14(R,S)-[18F]fluoro-6-thiaheptadecanoic acid [nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) uptake], and [11C]acetate (oxidative activity). The measurements were performed in rats adapted to 27°C, which were acutely subjected to cold (10°C) for 2 and 6 hours, and in rats chronically adapted to 10°C for 21 days, which were returned to 27°C for 2 and 6 hours. Cold exposure (acutely and chronically) led to increases in BAT oxidative activity, which was accompanied by concomitant increases in glucose and NEFA uptake. The increases were particularly high in cold-adapted rats and largely readily reduced by the return to a warm environment. The cold-induced increase in oxidative activity was meaningfully blunted by nicotinic acid, a lipolysis inhibitor, which emphasizes in vivo the key role of intracellular lipid in BAT thermogenesis. The changes in BAT oxidative activity and glucose and NEFA uptakes were paralleled by inductions of genes involved in not only oxidative metabolism but also in energy substrate replenishment (triglyceride and glycogen synthesis). The capacity of BAT for energy substrate replenishment is remarkable.—Labbé, S. M., Caron, A., Bakan, I., Laplante, M., Carpentier, A. C., Lecomte, R., Richard, D.

Here, we use single-molecule imaging to visualize Rad51 as it aligns and pairs homologous DNA sequences in real time. We show that Rad51 uses a length-based recognition mechanism while interrogating dsDNA, enabling robust kinetic selection of 8-nucleotide (nt) tracts of microhomology, which kinetically confines the search to sites with a high probability of being a homologous target. Successful pairing with a ninth nucleotide coincides with an additional reduction in binding free energy, and subsequent strand exchange occurs in precise 3-nt steps, reflecting the base triplet organization of the presynaptic complex.

These findings provide crucial new insights into the physical and evolutionary underpinnings of DNA recombination. Homologous recombination (HR) is ubiquitous among all three kingdoms of life and serves as a driving force in evolution. HR is a major pathway for repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and single-strand DNA (ssDNA) gaps and plays essential roles in repairing stalled or collapsed replication forks (Heyer et al., 2010Heyer W.D.

Klein H. Mechanism of eukaryotic homologous recombination.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 229-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). HR provides an alternative pathway for telomere maintenance (Eckert-Boulet and Lisby, 2010Eckert-Boulet N. Lisby M. Regulation of homologous recombination at telomeres in budding yeast.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 3696-3702Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), can lead to the duplication of long regions of chromosomes (Smith et al., 2007Smith C.E. Llorente B. Symington L.S. Template switching during break-induced replication.Nature. 2007; 447: 102-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and some organisms utilize HR as the sole means of initiating DNA replication (Hawkins et al., 2013Hawkins M. Malla S. Blythe M.J. Nieduszynski C.A. Allers T. Accelerated growth in the absence of DNA replication origins.Nature. 2013; 503: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). HR also generates genetic diversity and ensures proper chromosome segregation during meiosis (Neale and Keeney, 2006Neale M.J. Keeney S. Clarifying the mechanics of DNA strand exchange in meiotic recombination.Nature. 2006; 442: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and is a major source of phenotypic variation in many organisms (Fraser et al., 2007Fraser C.

Rosenberg S.M. Ira G. Mechanisms of change in gene copy number.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 551-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). In humans, aberrant HR underlies chromosomal rearrangements often associated with cancers, cancer prone syndromes, and numerous genetic diseases (Heyer et al., 2010Heyer W.D. Ehmsen K.T. Liu J. Regulation of homologous recombination in eukaryotes.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2010; 44: 113-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, San Filippo et al., 2008San Filippo J. Sung P. Klein H. Mechanism of eukaryotic homologous recombination.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 229-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). DSB repair in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has long served as paradigm for studying HR (Heyer et al., 2010Heyer W.D. Ehmsen K.T. Liu J. Regulation of homologous recombination in eukaryotes.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2010; 44: 113-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, San Filippo et al., 2008San Filippo J. Sung P. Klein H. Mechanism of eukaryotic homologous recombination.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 229-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). The DNA ends present at DSBs are first processed by 5′ → 3′ strand resection, yielding 3′ ssDNA overhangs whose production coincides with the binding of replication protein A (RPA). RPA is then replaced by Rad51 or the meiosis-specific recombinase Dmc1, which is thought to have arisen by a gene duplication event early in the evolutionary history of eukaryotes (Lin et al., 2006Lin Z. Kong H. Nei M. Ma H. Origins and evolution of the recA/RAD51 gene family: evidence for ancient gene duplication and endosymbiotic gene transfer.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 10328-10333Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Rad51 and Dmc1 are both closely related to Escherichia coli RecA. These proteins are DNA-dependent ATPases that form right-handed helical filaments on ssDNA, and the resulting presynaptic complexes (PCs) display a striking degree of conservation from bacteriophage to humans (Bianco et al., 1998Bianco P.R. Tracy R.B. Kowalczykowski S.C. DNA strand exchange proteins: a biochemical and physical comparison.Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D570-D603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Structural studies have revealed that the presynaptic ssDNA is organized into base triplets that are maintained in near B-form conformation, but there is a 7.8 Å rise between adjacent triplets causing an overall extension of the ssDNA (Chen et al., 2008Chen Z. Yang H. Pavletich N.P. Mechanism of homologous recombination from the RecA-ssDNA/dsDNA structures.Nature. 2008; 453: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Single-molecule force measurements suggest that this ssDNA extension may promote release of nonhomologous double-strand (dsDNA) and facilitate strand exchange with homologous dsDNA (Danilowicz et al., 2014Danilowicz C. Peacock-Villada A. Vlassakis J. Facon A. Feinstein E. Kleckner N. Prentiss M. The differential extension in dsDNA bound to Rad51 filaments may play important roles in homology recognition and strand exchange.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Many proteins participate in HR, including those encoded by the conserved RAD52 epistasis group of genes (Heyer et al., 2010Heyer W.D. Ehmsen K.T. Liu J. Regulation of homologous recombination in eukaryotes.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2010; 44: 113-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, San Filippo et al., 2008San Filippo J. Sung P. Klein H. Mechanism of eukaryotic homologous recombination.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 229-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). Despite these layers of complexity, Rad51, like other members of the Rad51/RecA family, can promote strand invasion in the absence of other proteins, implying that more specialized accessory factors augment the basal recombinase activities without conferring new catalytic properties. Rad51/RecA recombinases must align ssDNA with a homologous duplex elsewhere in the genome. This process is referred to as the “homology search” and it is conceptually similar to target searches conducted by all other site-specific DNA-binding proteins (Barzel and Kupiec, 2008Barzel A. Kupiec M. Finding a match: how do homologous sequences get together for recombination?.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, Renkawitz et al., 2014Renkawitz J.

Chem. 1989; 264: 675-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The principles that govern sequence alignment during HR remain poorly understood because the corresponding intermediates are transient and asynchronous (Barzel and Kupiec, 2008Barzel A. Kupiec M. Finding a match: how do homologous sequences get together for recombination?.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, Renkawitz et al., 2014Renkawitz J. Lademann C.A. Jentsch S. Mechanisms and principles of homology search during recombination.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2014; 15: 369-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). What features are the recombinases searching for within dsDNA? How do they distinguish between nonhomologous and homologous sequences? Over what length scales do they test for homology? What distinguishes search intermediates from the commitment to strand exchange? These questions all pertain to the overarching issue of how homology is efficiently located given the vast sequence space encoded by the genome (Neale and Keeney, 2006Neale M.J. Keeney S. Clarifying the mechanics of DNA strand exchange in meiotic recombination.Nature. 2006; 442: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). We sought to address these questions by visualizing the homology search at the single-molecule level. Our results lead to a model in which 8-nt microhomology motifs serve as the fundamental units of molecular recognition by S. cerevisiae Rad51, and this initial event is distinct from subsequent strand invasion. We show that the physical principles underlying the ability of Rad51 to search for and align homologous DNA sequences are broadly conserved among the Rad51/RecA family members. This mechanism can drastically reduce the amount time necessary to align homologous dsDNA sequences. We used ssDNA curtains and total internal refection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) to visualize Rad51 PCs (Gibb et al., 2014aGibb B. Ye L.F. Gergoudis S.C. Kwon Y. Niu H. Sung P. Greene E.C. Concentration-dependent exchange of replication protein A on single-stranded DNA revealed by single-molecule imaging.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e87922Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The ssDNA was generated using M13mp18 (7,249-nt) as a template for rolling circle replication (Figures 1A and S1) and then anchored to a lipid bilayer within a microfluidic chamber through a biotin-streptavidin linkage and aligned along chromium (Cr) barriers by application of hydrodynamic force. The ssDNA unravels when incubated with RPA-eGFP, and the downstream ends of the RPA-ssDNA are anchored to exposed Cr pedestals.

(G) Quantitation of the Rad51 filament stability in the presence of various nucleotide cofactors. Error bars represent SD. Rad51/RecA recombinases must interrogate nonhomologous dsDNA while attempting to locate and align homologous sequences. We mimicked this process by testing the ability of the Rad51 PCs to interact with nonhomologous 70-base pair (bp) dsDNA oligonucleotides (Figure 1B). To visualize dsDNA binding, we injected Atto565-labeled dsDNA into the sample chamber; for brevity we designated this substrate Atto565-DNA1.0. Following a brief incubation, unbound dsDNA was flushed away and the remaining molecules were visualized by TIRFM. These experiments revealed Atto565-DNA1.0 bound to the PCs with no evident site preference within our resolution limits (Figures 1C–1E), and most of the bound dsDNA (78.4%) exhibited single-step photo-bleaching (not shown). Controls with RPA-ssDNA (minus Rad51) confirmed that dsDNA capture was Rad51-dependent (Figure S3A). In addition, the PCs rapidly disassembled when ATP was replaced with ADP (Figure S2), and the bound dsDNA was also quickly released when reactions were chased with ADP, indicating that dsDNA retention required the continued presence of Rad51 (Figures S3B–S3D). Kinetic measurements yielded a dissociation rate (koff) of 0.062 ± 0.001 min−1 for Atto565-DNA1.0, corresponding to a lifetime of ∼16 min (Figures 1F and 1G). This was an extraordinarily stable interaction for a seemingly nonhomologous dsDNA, and such long-lived intermediates would appear incompatible with an efficient search mechanism. We next sought to understand the physical basis for these long lifetimes. If nonhomologous dsDNA capture primarily involved nonspecific electrostatic contacts with the phosphate backbone, then the lifetime of the bound intermediates should vary with dsDNA length. We tested this possibility with 35-bp and 18-bp dsDNA substrates. Surprisingly, the truncated substrates bound tightly to the PCs, although more substrate and longer incubation times were required for initial engagement (Figure S4). We conclude that substrate length had a modest impact on initial association with the PC, but did not affect retention of the captured dsDNA, suggesting that the observed intermediates were not maintained primarily through nonspecific contacts with dsDNA phosphate backbone. We next asked whether sequence microhomology might contribute to dsDNA capture. Analysis of DNA1.0 revealed many short tracts of microhomology complementary to sequences scattered throughout the M13mp18 ssDNA, including 12 regions with ≥8-nts of microhomology (Figures 2A and 2B ). Previous reports suggested that E. coli RecA can pair DNA substrates perhaps as short as 8-nt in length (De Vlaminck et al., 2012De Vlaminck I. van Loenhout M.T. Zweifel L. den Blanken J. Hooning K.

Based on this knowledge, we designed a new substrate (Atto565-DNA2.0), which retained identical sequence composition as DNA1.0, but lacked microhomology ≥8-nt in length (Figures 2D and 2E). We readily detected capture of Atto565-DNA1.0 (Figure 2C), however, we were unable to detect stable capture of Atto565-DNA2.0 under identical conditions (Figure 2F), despite the fact that this substrate contains numerous tracts of microhomology ≤7-nt in length (Figure 2D). Our results imply that dsDNA capture involves 8-nt or longer tracts of microhomology. This hypothesis predicts that a single 8-nt tract of microhomology added to an otherwise nonhomologous dsDNA should confer stable association with the PC. We tested this prediction with a series of substrates bearing precisely 8-nt of microhomology (Figure 3A). Remarkably, addition of a single 8-nt tract of microhomology was sufficient to confer stable binding of a nonhomologous dsDNA to the PC, and similar results were obtained for 8-nt microhomology motifs at different locations (Figures 3A–3E). The binding site distributions and the pairwise distance distributions of Atto565-dsDNA2.1 revealed a 2.6 ± 0.2 μm periodicity, consistent with the expectation that the dsDNA was captured at a single position on M13mp18, and this conclusion was supported by analysis of a substrate targeted to an alternative location (Figures 1D, 1E, 3F, 3G, and S5).Figure S5Sequence-Dependent dsDNA Binding Distributions, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Schematic depiction of the ssDNA curtains and the predicted relative locations of two different dsDNA substrates (Atto565-DNA2.1 and Atto565-DNA2.1S) bearing a single 8-nt tract of microhomology targeted to different sites on M13mp18.(B) Binding site distribution for Atto565-DNA2.1.

The requirement for microhomology suggested that captured intermediates were retained through Watson-Crick pairing. This hypothesis predicts that the binding lifetime should scale with melting temperature (Tm), which was confirmed using substrates bearing 8-nt tracts of microhomology of varying AT-content (Figure 3H). Moreover, the change in free energy (ΔΔG‡) scaled with hydrogen bonding potential, with each hydrogen bond contributing ∼0.14 kBT to the binding of the 8-nt motif. The modest contribution to overall stability for each hydrogen bond was consistent with the requirement that the homology search be driven by thermal fluctuations and supports the notion that stretch-induced disruption of base stacking destabilizes the Watson-Crick base pairs relative to B-DNA (Chen et al., 2008Chen Z. Yang H. Pavletich N.P. Mechanism of homologous recombination from the RecA-ssDNA/dsDNA structures.Nature. 2008; 453: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). We also tested how microhomology length influenced dsDNA capture (Figure 3I). We were unable to detect any stable binding intermediates when the 8-nt tract of microhomology was decreased to 7-nt (Atto565-DNA2.6), in agreement with the conclusion that 8-nts of microhomology was necessary for stable dsDNA capture (Figure 3I and see below). In contrast, increasing the 8-nt tract of microhomology to 9-nt reduced the dissociation rate, and additional length increases resulted in step-wise reductions in the dissociation rates in precise 3-nt increments (Figure 3I and see below). The microhomology requirement, the periodic binding patterns, and the influence of AT-content and microhomology length all suggested that the bound intermediates were maintained through Watson-Crick interactions. Rad51 did not stably capture dsDNA lacking 8-nt tracts of microhomology, but it must be transiently sampling these molecules. Even microhomology-bearing dsDNA must in most instances be transiently sampled, because the vast majority of bimolecular encounters will occur at nonhomologous sites. Therefore, the 70-bp substrates used in our assays offered the unique potential for exploring how Rad51 samples and rejects dsDNA while searching for homology. We detected these transient intermediates by visualizing reactions in real time at 60-ms resolution (Figures 4A–4D). Remarkably, the survival probabilities of substrates lacking ≥8-nt of microhomology (Atto565-DNA2.0) did not decay exponentially, but rather scaled as a power-law, with 50% of the molecules dissociating within 0.54 s (Figure 4E), even though this substrate harbors numerous ≤7-nt tracts of microhomology (Figure 2D). Power-law dependence was also observed over short time regimes for a substrate bearing a single 8-nt tract of microhomology (Atto565-DNA2.1), whereas the lifetimes were limited by photo-bleaching at longer time scales, as expected (Figure 4E). We next conducted real-time measurements with Atto565-DNA2.6, which differs from Atto565-DNA2.1 by just a single nucleotide (Figure 3I; Supplemental Information); as indicated above, this single nucleotide change reduces the 8-nt tract of microhomology to 7-nt and abolishes stable capture of this substrate by Rad51. Instead, Atto565-DNA2.6 exhibits power-law distributed dissociation kinetics with 50% of the molecules dissociating within 0.82 s (Figure 4E). These findings indicate that all the dsDNA substrates were initially sampled through the same pathway, as revealed by its characteristic power-law dependence, but only substrates bearing 8-nts of microhomology transitioned into the long-lived state. A crucial implication of this power-law behavior is that the transient sampling events cannot be ascribed to a single conformational state that can be assigned a unique dissociation rate constant, but rather reflects the existence of a highly diverse ensemble of states with a correspondingly broad distribution of dissociation rates (Austin et al., 1975Austin R.H.

Dynamics of ligand binding to myoglobin.Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5355-5373Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar, Frauenfelder et al., 1991Frauenfelder H. Sligar S.G. Wolynes P.G. The energy landscapes and motions of proteins.Science. 1991; 254: 1598-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (2611) Google Scholar). The physical basis for this power-law dependence is readily understood given the vast number of potential intermediates. If one assumes recognition involving 8-nt sequence motifs, then a 70-bp dsDNA can be misaligned with a total of 453,652 distinct sites on M13mp18, each of which can give rise to energetically distinct states based on differences in sequence composition. Power-law distributed dissociation kinetics are also consistent with recent molecular dynamics simulations, which suggest a large number of intermediates as RecA probes sequences for homology (M. Prentiss, personal communication). These considerations highlight the tremendous challenge faced during the homology search, even within our simplified experimental system. Our data provide a free energy landscape describing dsDNA sampling and strand invasion by Rad51 (Figure 4F; Supplemental Information). The initial search process is characterized by transient intermediates that encompass a broad distribution of energetic states, which could reflect thousands of distinct complexes as Rad51 interrogates different sequences for homology (Figures 4F and 4G). Recognition of an 8-nt tract of microhomology results in an ∼8.2 kBT drop in free energy (ΔΔG‡) and gives rise to a ≥4 order-of-magnitude decrease in dissociation kinetics, providing a robust length-based mechanism for kinetically discriminating against sequences that are unlikely to be fully homologous (Figures 4F and 4G). This length-based microhomology recognition event is the single largest change in the energy landscape and most likely reflects a conformational transition within the Rad51-ssDNA-dsDNA ternary complex—the exact nature of which remains to be explored. The finding that recognition of an 8-nt tract (as opposed to either 6- or 9-nt) coincided with the largest drop in free energy was not anticipated given that ssDNA within the PC is organized into base triplets (Chen et al., 2008Chen Z. Yang H. Pavletich N.P. Mechanism of homologous recombination from the RecA-ssDNA/dsDNA structures.Nature. 2008; 453: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Following microhomology capture, Rad51 can probe the flanking the DNA for additional homology while attempting strand invasion. Pairing with a ninth nt results in an additional ∼0.4 kBT reduction in free energy, revealing that incorporation of the ninth nt enabled more stable engagement of the third base triplet. All subsequent reductions in free energy occurred in precise 3-nt increments, suggesting that the ssDNA bound by Rad51 was organized into base triplets, as observed for E. coli RecA (Chen et al., 2008Chen Z.

https://openalex.org/W2027451321,"A cardioprotectant at low concentrations, H2S is a toxin at high concentrations and inhibits cytochrome c oxidase. A conundrum in H2S homeostasis is its fate in red blood cells (RBCs), which produce H2S but lack the canonical mitochondrial sulfide oxidation pathway for its clearance. The sheer abundance of RBCs in circulation enhances the metabolic significance of their clearance strategy for H2S, necessary to avoid systemic toxicity. In this study, we demonstrate that H2S generation by RBCs is catalyzed by mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase. Furthermore, we have discovered the locus of sulfide oxidation in RBCs and describe a new role for an old protein, hemoglobin, which in the ferric or methemoglobin state binds H2S and oxidizes it to a mixture of thiosulfate and hydropolysulfides. Our study reveals a previously undescribed route for the biogenesis of hydropolysulfides, which are increasingly considered important for H2S-based signaling, but their origin in mammalian cells is unknown. An NADPH/flavoprotein oxidoreductase system restores polysulfide-carrying hemoglobin derivatives to ferrous hemoglobin, thus completing the methemoglobin-dependent sulfide oxidation cycle. Methemoglobin-dependent sulfide oxidation in mammals is complex and has similarities to chemistry reported for the dissolution of iron oxides in sulfidic waters and during bioleaching of metal sulfides. The catalytic oxidation of H2S by hemoglobin explains how RBCs maintain low steady-state H2S levels in circulation, and suggests that additional hemeproteins might be involved in sulfide homeostasis in other tissues."

To investigate the molecular basis of a bacterial host-switching event in a tractable host species, we traced the evolutionary trajectory of the common rabbit clone of Staphylococcus aureus. We report that it evolved through a likely human-to-rabbit host jump over 40 years ago and that only a single naturally occurring nucleotide mutation was required and sufficient to convert a human-specific S. aureus strain into one that could infect rabbits. Related mutations were identified at the same locus in other rabbit strains of distinct clonal origin, consistent with convergent evolution.

Ribosome stalling at polyproline stretches is common and fundamental. In bacteria, translation elongation factor P (EF-P) rescues such stalled ribosomes, but only when it is post-translationally activated. In Escherichia coli, activation of EF-P is achieved by (R)-β-lysinylation and hydroxylation of a conserved lysine. Here we have unveiled a markedly different modification strategy in which a conserved arginine of EF-P is rhamnosylated by a glycosyltransferase (EarP) using dTDP-L-rhamnose as a substrate. This is to our knowledge the first report of N-linked protein glycosylation on arginine in bacteria and the first example in which a glycosylated side chain of a translation elongation factor is essential for function.

Non-recombining chromosomes in sexual organisms are thought to have degenerated in a similar fashion2; however, it is not clear the extent to which damaging mutations accumulate along chromosomes with highly variable rates of crossing over. Using high-coverage sequencing data from over 1,400 individuals in the 1000 Genomes and CARTaGENE projects, we show that recombination rate modulates the distribution of putatively deleterious variants across the entire human genome. Exons in regions of low recombination are significantly enriched for deleterious and disease-associated variants, a signature varying in strength across worldwide human populations with different demographic histories. Regions with low recombination rates are enriched for highly conserved genes with essential cellular functions and show an excess of mutations with demonstrated effects on health, a phenomenon likely affecting disease susceptibility in humans."

We demonstrated long-lasting oncogenic repression, which was maintained even after suppression of ZF-DNMT3A expression in tumor cells. The de novo DNAme was faithfully propagated and maintained through cell generations even after the suppression of the expression of the chimeric methyltransferase in the tumor cells. Xenograft studies in NUDE mice demonstrated stable SOX2 repression and long-term breast tumor growth inhibition, which lasted for >100 days post implantation of the tumor cells in mice. This was accompanied with a faithful maintenance of DNAme in the breast cancer implants. In contrast, downregulation of SOX2 by ZF domains engineered with the Krueppel-associated box repressor domain resulted in a transient and reversible suppression of oncogenic gene expression. Our results indicated that targeted de novo DNAme of the SOX2 oncogenic promoter was sufficient to induce long-lasting epigenetic silencing, which was not only maintained during cell division but also significantly delayed the tumorigenic phenotype of cancer cells in vivo, even in the absence of treatment.

https://openalex.org/W2047578621,"Aberrant activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is frequent in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and contributes to HCC initiation and progression. This abnormal activation may result from somatic mutations in the genes of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and/or dysregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. The mechanism for the latter remains poorly understood. Prospero-related homeobox 1 (PROX1) is a downstream target of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in human colorectal cancer and elevated PROX1 expression promotes malignant progression. However, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway does not regulate PROX1 expression in the liver and HCC cells. Here we report that PROX1 promotes HCC cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in HCC xenograft mice. PROX1 and β-catenin levels are positively correlated in tumor tissues as well as in cultured HCC cells. PROX1 can upregulate β-catenin transcription by stimulating the β-catenin promoter and enhance the nuclear translocation of β-catenin in HCC cells, which leads to the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Moreover, we show that increase in PROX1 expression renders HCC cells more resistant to sorafenib treatment, which is the standard therapy for advanced HCC. Overall, we have pinpointed PROX1 as a critical factor activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in HCC, which promotes HCC proliferation and sorafenib resistance."

No F-actin stress fibers were detected even after 31 parabolas. Furthermore, mRNA and protein quantifications after the 31st parabola showed a clear up-regulation of cytoskeletal genes and proteins. The mRNAs were significantly up-regulated as follows: TUBB, 2-fold; VIM, 1.3-fold; KRT8, 1.8-fold; ACTB, 1.9-fold; ICAM1, 4.8-fold; OPN, 7-fold; ITGA10, 1.5-fold; ITGB1, 1.2-fold; TGFB1, 1.5-fold; CAV1, 2.6-fold; SOX9, 1.7-fold; BMP-2, 5.3-fold. However, SOX5 (-25%) and SOX6 (-28%) gene expression was decreased. Contrary, no significant changes in gene expression levels were observed during vibration and hypergravity experiments. These data suggest that short-term microgravity affects the gene expression of distinct proteins. In contrast to poorly differentiated follicular thyroid cancer cells or human endothelial cells, chondrocytes only exert moderate cytoskeletal alterations. The up-regulation of BMP-2, TGF-β1, and SOX9 in chondrocytes may play a key role in preventing cytoskeletal alterations.—Aleshcheva, G., Wehland, M., Sahana, J., Bauer, J., Corydon, T. J., Hemmersbach, R., Frett, T., Egli, M., Infanger, M., Grosse, J., Grimm, D. Moderate alterations of the cytoskeleton in human chondrocytes after short-term microgravity produced by parabolic flight maneuvers could be prevented by up-regulation of BMP-2 and SOX-9.

https://openalex.org/W2027578756,"The planetary nebula (PN) stage is the ultimate fate of stars with mass 1 to 8 solar masses (M$_\odot$). The origin of their complex morphologies is poorly understood, although several mechanisms involving binary interaction have been proposed. In close binary systems, the orbital separation is short enough for the primary star to overfill its Roche lobe as it expands during the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase. The excess material ends up forming a common-envelope (CE) surrounding both stars. Drag forces would then result in the envelope being ejected into a bipolar PN whose equator is coincident with the orbital plane of the system. Systems in which both stars have ejected their envelopes and evolve towards the white dwarf (WD) stage are called double-degenerates. Here we report that Henize 2-428 has a double-degenerate core with a combined mass unambiguously above the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 M$_\odot$. According to its short orbital period (4.2 hours) and total mass (1.76 M$_\odot$), the system should merge in 700 million years, triggering a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) event. This finding supports the double-degenerate, super-Chandrasekhar evolutionary channel for the formation of SNe Ia."

Here, we demonstrate that one important mechanism underlying the tumorigenesis of KSHV is through transcriptional repression of the tumor suppressor gene PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein 2 (PDLIM2). PDLIM2 expression is repressed in KSHV-transformed human umbilical vascular endothelial cells as well as in KSHV-associated cancer cell lines and primary tumors. Importantly, PDLIM2 repression is essential for KSHV-induced persistent activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and subsequent tumorigenesis and tumor maintenance. Our mechanistic studies indicate that PDLIM2 repression by KSHV involves DNA methylation. Notably, the epigenetic repression of PDLIM2 can be reversed by 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine and vitamin D to suppress KSHV-associated cancer cell growth. These studies not only improve our understanding of KSHV pathogenesis but also provide immediate therapeutic strategies for KSHV-mediated cancers, particularly those associated with AIDS.

https://openalex.org/W1987467962,"In bacteria, disulfide bonds confer stability on many proteins exported to the cell envelope or beyond. These proteins include numerous bacterial virulence factors, and thus bacterial enzymes that promote disulfide bond formation represent targets for compounds inhibiting bacterial virulence. Here, we describe a new target- and cell-based screening methodology for identifying compounds that inhibit the disulfide bond-forming enzymes Escherichia coli DsbB (EcDsbB) or Mycobacterium tuberculosis VKOR (MtbVKOR), which can replace EcDsbB, although the two are not homologs. Initial screening of 51,487 compounds yielded six specifically inhibiting EcDsbB. These compounds share a structural motif and do not inhibit MtbVKOR. A medicinal chemistry approach led us to select related compounds, some of which are much more effective DsbB inhibitors than those found in the screen. These compounds inhibit purified DsbB and prevent anaerobic growth of E. coli. Furthermore, these compounds inhibit all but one of the DsbBs of nine other Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria tested."
https://openalex.org/W2122492614,"The diffusion of materials from systemic circulation to the central nervous system (CNS) is restricted by the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB). Choroid plexus epithelial cells (CPECs) of the brain ventricles constitute the BCSFB and regulate the infiltration of plasma proteins as well as immune cells into the interstitium of the CNS. The barrier function is altered in pathologic conditions. However, the regulatory mechanism of BCSFB is not fully understood. Here, we investigated the function of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4), a polymodally gated divalent cation channel that is highly expressed in CPECs. TRPV4 was localized broadly on the apical membrane in swine CPECs, in contrast with an intense ciliary localization found on other cell types. Treatment with the TRPV4-specific agonist, GSK1016790A (GSK; EC₅₀ 34 nM), induced a robust calcium influx and an immediate serine/threonine protein phosphorylation. The agonist treatment induced a marked decrease in the amount of filamentous actin and disintegrated the cell junctions in 10-20 minutes. In contrast, inhibition of the basal TRPV4 activity with the TRPV4-specific antagonist, HC067047 (HC; IC₅₀ 74 nM), reduced the basolateral-to-apical transport of α-2-macroglobulin (A2M). Overall, this study demonstrated a novel physiologic function of TRPV4 in the regulation of BCSFB permeability."
https://openalex.org/W2041130165,"Rates of the most common gynecologic cancer, endometrioid adenocarcinoma (EAC), continue to rise, mirroring the global epidemic of obesity, a well-known EAC risk factor. Thus, identifying novel molecular targets to prevent and/or mitigate EAC is imperative. The prevalent Type 1 EAC commonly harbors loss of the tumor suppressor, Pten, leading to AKT activation. The major endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone, GRP78, is a potent pro-survival protein to maintain ER homeostasis, and as a cell surface protein, is known to regulate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway. To determine whether targeting GRP78 could suppress EAC development, we created a conditional knockout mouse model using progesterone receptor-Cre-recombinase to achieve Pten and Grp78 (cPten(f/f)Grp78(f/f)) deletion in the endometrial epithelium. Mice with a single Pten (cPten(f/f)) deletion developed well-differentiated EAC by 4 weeks. In contrast, no cPten(f/f)Grp78(f/f) mice developed EAC, even after more than 8 months of observation. Histologic examination of uteri from cPten(f/f)Grp78(f/f) mice also revealed no complex atypical hyperplasia, a well-established EAC precursor. These histologic observations among the cPten(f/f)Grp78(f/f) murine uteri also corresponded to abrogation of AKT activation within the endometrium. We further observed that GRP78 co-localized with activated AKT on the surface of EAC, thus providing an opportunity for therapeutic targeting. Consistent with previous findings that cell surface GRP78 is an upstream regulator of PI3K/AKT signaling, we show here that in vivo short-term systemic treatment with a highly specific monoclonal antibody against GRP78 suppressed AKT activation and increased apoptosis in the cPten(f/f) tumors. Collectively, these findings present GRP78-targeting therapy as an efficacious therapeutic option for EAC."
https://openalex.org/W2083209557,"The number of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeting drugs in the development for cancer treatment is continuously increasing. Currently used EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors have specific limitations related to toxicity and development of resistance, and there is a need for alternative treatment strategies to maximize the clinical potential of EGFR as a molecular target. This study describes the design and production of a novel EGFR-targeted fusion protein, rGel/EGF, composed of the recombinant plant toxin gelonin and EGF. rGel/EGF was custom-made for administration by photochemical internalization (PCI), a clinically tested modality for cytosolic release of macromolecular therapeutics. rGel/EGF lacks efficient mechanisms for endosomal escape and is therefore minimally toxic as monotherapy. However, PCI induces selective and efficient cytosolic release of rGel/EGF in EGFR-expressing target cells by light-directed activation of photosensitizers accumulated selectively in tumor tissue. PCI of rGel/EGF was shown to be highly effective against EGFR-expressing cell lines, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines resistant to cetuximab (Erbitux). Apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy were identified as mechanisms of action following PCI of rGel/EGF in vitro. PCI of rGel/EGF was further shown as a highly tumor-specific and potent modality in vivo, with growth inhibitory effects demonstrated on A-431 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) xenografts and reduction of tumor perfusion and necrosis induction in SCC-026 HNSCC tumors. Considering the small amount of rGel/EGF injected per animal (0.1 mg/kg), the presented in vivo results are highly promising and warrant optimization and production of rGel/EGF for further preclinical evaluation with PCI."
https://openalex.org/W2062707173,"Excessive nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation should be precisely controlled as it contributes to multiple immune and inflammatory diseases. However, the negative regulatory mechanisms of NF-κB activation still need to be elucidated. Various types of polyubiquitin chains have proved to be involved in the process of NF-κB activation. Many negative regulators linked to ubiquitination, such as A20 and CYLD, inhibit IκB kinase activation in the NF-κB signaling pathway. To find new NF-κB signaling regulators linked to ubiquitination, we used a small scale siRNA library against 51 ubiquitin-associated domain-containing proteins and screened out UBXN1, which contained both ubiquitin-associated and ubiquitin regulatory X (UBX) domains as a negative regulator of TNFα-triggered NF-κB activation. Overexpression of UBXN1 inhibited TNFα-triggered NF-κB activation, although knockdown of UBXN1 had the opposite effect. UBX domain-containing proteins usually act as valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97 cofactors. However, knockdown of VCP/p97 barely affected UBXN1-mediated NF-κB inhibition. At the same time, we found that UBXN1 interacted with cellular inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (cIAPs), E3 ubiquitin ligases of RIP1 in the TNFα receptor complex. UBXN1 competitively bound to cIAP1, blocked cIAP1 recruitment to TNFR1, and sequentially inhibited RIP1 polyubiquitination in response to TNFα. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that UBXN1 is an important negative regulator of the TNFα-triggered NF-κB signaling pathway by mediating cIAP recruitment independent of VCP/p97."
https://openalex.org/W2080258051,"Evasion of extracellular matrix detachment-induced apoptosis (‘anoikis’) is a defining characteristic of metastatic tumor cells. The ability of metastatic carcinoma cells to survive matrix detachment and escape anoikis enables them to disseminate as viable circulating tumor cells and seed distant organs. Here we report that αB-crystallin, an antiapoptotic molecular chaperone implicated in the pathogenesis of diverse poor-prognosis solid tumors, is induced by matrix detachment and confers anoikis resistance. Specifically, we demonstrate that matrix detachment downregulates extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity and increases αB-crystallin protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels. Moreover, we show that ERK inhibition in adherent cancer cells mimics matrix detachment by increasing αB-crystallin protein and mRNA levels, whereas constitutive ERK activation suppresses αB-crystallin induction during matrix detachment. These findings indicate that ERK inhibition is both necessary and sufficient for αB-crystallin induction by matrix detachment. To examine the functional consequences of αB-crystallin induction in anoikis, we stably silenced αB-crystallin in two different metastatic carcinoma cell lines. Strikingly, silencing αB-crystallin increased matrix detachment-induced caspase activation and apoptosis but did not affect cell viability of adherent cancer cells. In addition, silencing αB-crystallin in metastatic carcinoma cells reduced the number of viable circulating tumor cells and inhibited lung metastasis in two orthotopic models, but had little or no effect on primary tumor growth. Taken together, our findings point to αB-crystallin as a novel regulator of anoikis resistance that is induced by matrix detachment-mediated suppression of ERK signaling and promotes lung metastasis. Our results also suggest that αB-crystallin represents a promising molecular target for antimetastatic therapies."

Located 5′ upstream from the “wild-type” CHRNA7 gene that is found in other vertebrates, we demonstrate CHRFAM7A expression in a broad range of epithelial cells and sequenced the CHRFAM7A transcript found in normal human fetal small intestine epithelial (FHs) cells to prove its identity. We then compared its expression to CHRNA7 in 11 gut epithelial cell lines, showed that there is a differential response to LPS when compared to CHRNA7, and characterized the CHRFAM7A promoter. We report that both CHRFAM7A and CHRNA7 gene expression are widely distributed in human epithelial cell lines but that the levels of CHRFAM7A gene expression vary up to 5000-fold between different gut epithelial cells. A 3-hour treatment of epithelial cells with 100 ng/ml LPS increased CHRFAM7A gene expression by almost 1000-fold but had little effect on CHRNA7 gene expression. Mapping the regulatory elements responsible for CHRFAM7A gene expression identifies a 1 kb sequence in the UTR of the CHRFAM7A gene that is modulated by LPS. Taken together, these data establish the presence, identity, and differential regulation of the human-specific CHRFAM7A gene in human gut epithelial cells. In light of the fact that CHRFAM7A expression is reported to modulate ligand binding to, and alter the activity of, the wild-type α7nAChR ligand-gated pentameric ion channel, the findings point to the existence of a species-specific α7nAChR response that might regulate gut epithelial function in a human-specific fashion.— Dang, X., Eliceiri, B.

Although TPX2 contains 747 amino acids that predict a mass of 86 kDa, the observed molecular mass on SDS-PAGE is about 100 kDa. This observation suggests post-translational modifications of the protein (16Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Probability-based protein identification by searching sequence databases using mass spectrometry data.Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6763) Google Scholar). PhosphoSitePlus, an online database providing information on protein post-translational modifications shows that TPX2 has over 40 in vivo putative phosphorylation sites (17Hornbeck P.V. Kornhauser J.M. Tkachev S. Zhang B. Skrzypek E. Murray B. Latham V. Sullivan M.

In Xenopus egg extracts, TPX2 is phosphorylated specifically during mitosis and this can be enhanced by taxol-mediated stabilization of mitotic MTs (18Wittmann T. Wilm M. Karsenti E. Vernos I. TPX2, A novel Xenopus MAP involved in spindle pole organization.J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1405-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Several putative cdc2 and MAP kinase sites were detected on TPX2 from these extracts using mass spectrometry. Human TPX2 is also phosphorylated during M phase (2Heidebrecht H.J. Buck F. Steinmann J.

Parwaresch R. p100: a novel proliferation-associated nuclear protein specifically restricted to cell cycle phases S, G2, and M.Blood. 1997; 90: 226-233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these data indicate that the functions of TPX2 might be regulated by phosphorylation. In particular, numerous high-throughput phosphoproteomic screens and this study identified threonine 72 (Thr72), a highly conserved residue among TPX2 species, as a potential phosphorylation site in human cells (19Franz-Wachtel M.

We propose that phosphorylation at this residue regulates TPX2 localization and impacts spindle morphogenesis via Aurora A and Eg5. HeLa cells were synchronized using 100 ng/ml of nocodazole for 16 h. After three PBS washings, cells were released into fresh DMEM without nocodazole for 30 min. Cells were harvested and washed with PBS twice before addition of lysis buffer. Protein lysate concentrations were measured using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Endogenous TPX2 was immunoprecipitated from 10 mg of total protein lysates using TPX2 Abs (clone 184, Novus Biologicals) and Protein A/G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads. The beads were then washed five times with 500 ml of lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors. The IP samples were run on SDS-PAGE, and Coomassie Blue-stained bands around the expected size of 100 kDa were excised from the gel and sent for mass spectrometry analysis at the University of Victoria Proteomic Center. Another set of IP samples was analyzed by Western blotting using Thr(P)72 and pan-TPX2 Abs. Sample preparation for LC-MS/MS analysis was performed at the University of Victoria Proteomic Center. For mass spectrometry data analysis, raw files analyzed with Proteome Discoverer software (Thermo Scientific) were submitted to Mascot 2.2 and compared with Homo sapiens of Uniprot-Swissprot, Uniprot Trembl, and IPI human database entries. The phosphospecific Abs recognizing phospho-TPX2 at threonine 72 were raised in rabbit against the phosphopeptide (K)LQQAIV(pT*72)PLKPVD that comprises amino acids 66 to 78 of human TPX2. The N-terminal lysine was added to promote solubility. The peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (carrier for the phosphopeptide hapten) and was used for immunization of rabbits. The phosphospecific Abs were affinity purified from the antiserum using standard laboratory protocols. Briefly, non-phosphorylated peptide or phosphorylated peptide was coupled to two different agarose columns of SulfoLink® coupling gel using SulfoLink® Immobilization kits (Pierce). Crude serum was first applied to the column coupled with non-phosphorylated peptide, then the flow-through was applied to the column coupled with the phosphorylated peptide. The phosphospecific Abs were eluted from the phosphorylated peptide column. In vitro kinase assays were performed using active Cdk-cyclin complexes and GST fusion proteins. 10 μg of GST-TPX2 WT, T72A, and T72E fusion proteins were incubated with 1 μg of each active Cdk1-cyclin B or Cdk2-cyclin A in the presence of 1 mm ATP (Sigma) at 30 °C for 30 min in kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2, 8 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 0.2 mm EDTA). As control, 10 μg of GST-TPX2 protein was incubated with 1 mm ATP in the same condition as above without any active Cdk-cyclin complex. Kinase reactions were stopped by adding 5× SDS-PAGE loading buffer into each sample. Western blot analysis was performed with reaction products using TPX2 (clone 184, Novus Biologicals), Thr(P)72, Cdk1, and Cdk2 Abs. Two unique TPX2-specific siRNA oligos were used to knock down endogenous TPX2. The first TPX2 siRNA oligo (5′-GAAUGGAACUGGAGGGCUU-3′; called TPX2 cds siRNA in this paper) has been described previously and specificity has been thoroughly demonstrated (5Gruss O.J. Wittmann M. Yokoyama H. Pepperkok R. Kufer T. Silljé H. Karsenti E. Mattaj I.W. Vernos I. Chromosome-induced microtubule assembly mediated by TPX2 is required for spindle formation in HeLa cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 871-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). This TPX2 cds siRNA targets a coding region of human TPX2 (hTPX2) 160–179 bp from the start codon. The second siRNA oligo (5′-AAGGCTAATAATGAGATCTAA-3′; called TPX2 UTR siRNA in this paper) targets a 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) of hTPX2 mRNA. This TPX2 UTR siRNA was purchased from Qiagen and was validated previously (33Neumayer G. Helfricht A. Shim S.Y. Le H.T. Lundin C. Belzil C. Chansard M. Yu Y. Lees-Miller S.P.

Chem. 2012; 287: 42206-42222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). “AllStars negative control siRNA” (Qiagen) was used as a negative control. To generate the GFP-TPX2 wild-type vector, human TPX2 cDNA (bp 3–2241) was cloned into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out on this plasmid to generate the T72A mutant. GFP-TPX2 T72A was generated by PCR using a mutation primer set (5′ phosphorylated T72A forward primer: CAAGCTATTGTCGCACCTTTGAAACCAG and 5′phosphorylated T72A reverse primer: CTGAAGATTAGCCTTTCTCAAAGGAG) and Phusion Hot Start DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes) to mutate threonine (ACA) to alanine (GCA). Mutated PCR products were circularized by ligation using a Rapid DNA ligation kit (Thermo Scientific). The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. After PBS washing, cells were lysed in an appropriate volume of mild and non-denaturing lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% (v/v) Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), a protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science), and 1 mm microcystin-LR (Cayman chemical)). Lysates were incubated on ice for 10 min and sonicated for 5 s twice using a Sonic Dismembrator Model 100 at level 4. Cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g to get clear supernatants. Supernatants were collected and protein concentrations were quantified using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent) and bovine serum albumin (BSA, EMD Millipore) as a standard. Proteins in SDS gel-loading buffer (4% (v/v) SDS, 0.2% (v/v) bromphenol blue, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol) were run on SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) membranes for Western blot analysis. After blocking in 5% skim milk solution in PBS-T (1× PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20), each membrane was incubated with specific primary Abs overnight at 4 °C. After washing 3 times using PBS-T for 5 min, membranes were incubated in 5% skim milk in PBS-T containing secondary Abs at 1:5000 dilutions for 1 h at room temperature. After PBS-T washing 3 times each for 5 min, Western Lighting® Enhanced Chemiluminescence solution (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added onto membranes for 2 min, and x-ray films (Hyblot CL® autoradiograph film, Denville Scientific, Inc.) were exposed to the membranes. The resulting films were developed using a Kodak X-Omat 2000A processor. To re-probe membranes with other Abs, membranes were incubated in a striping buffer (2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 15 min at 50 °C, washed 3 times with PBS-T, blocked in 5% skim milk in PBS-T, and developed as described above. Results on x-ray films were scanned using a DuoScan T1200 scanner (Agfa). Quantification of each band signal was performed using Quantity One analysis software (Bio-Rad). Signals were normalized to the levels of loading controls (α-actin or non-phosphorylated form of the proteins of interest). Cells were harvested, lysed, and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cell extracts were sonicated twice for 5 s using a Sonic Dismembrator Model 100 at level 4. After clearance by centrifugation at 16,500 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, supernatants were collected for protein quantification. 1 mg of protein of each cell lysate was used for IP. Samples were pre-cleared by incubation with protein A/G-Sepharose for 45 min, and then supernatants were incubated with primary Abs against the target protein for 3 h under gentle rotation at 4 °C. Next, the samples were incubated with protein A/G-Sepharose for an additional hour, continuing rotation at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed in lysis buffer for 5 min four times, resuspended in SDS gel-loading buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting. Immunoprecipitated proteins on beads were washed 4 times with lysis buffer and equally divided into two aliquots. The samples were then washed with 1× λ-protein phosphatase (λ-PPase) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 5 mm DTT, 0.01% (v/v) Brij 35 (pH 7.5)) two times, and treated with or without 400 units of λ-PPase (New England Biolabs) in 1× λ-PPase buffer at 30 °C for 30 min in the presence of 2 mm MnCl2. Reactions were stopped by adding 5× SDS gel-loading buffer. HeLa and HEK-293 cells (catalog numbers CCL-2 and CRL-1573; American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)) were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (all from Gibco). For transient transfection with single siRNA, cells were seeded on 60-mm cell culture dishes shortly before transfection. siRNA transfection was performed using HiPerFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol using 20 nm siRNA and 20 μl of HiPerFect reagent for each dish. Transient transfection of cells with plasmid DNAs alone or co-transfection of siRNA with plasmids was performed using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded on 60-mm cell culture dishes 1 day before transfection. Cells were transfected according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol using 3 μg of plasmids with 10 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent or 20 nm siRNA oligos and 3 μg of plasmids with 10 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent for each dish. HeLa cells were synchronized at S phase by double thymidine block. Cells were treated with 2 mm thymidine for 18 h, followed by 8 h of release in fresh DMEM, and then, re-treated with thymidine for 18 h. For M phase, cells were synchronized using nocodazole treatment. For un-transfected cells, 3–5 h after seeding, cells were treated with"
https://openalex.org/W2025175309,"Osteoclast differentiation and function are highly dependent on the assembly and turnover of actin filaments, but little is known about the roles of actin binding proteins in these processes. Adseverin (Ads), a member of the gelsolin superfamily of actin capping and severing proteins, regulates actin filament turnover and can regulate the turnover of cortical actin filaments of chromaffin cells during exocytosis. Using a conditional Ads knockout mouse model, we confirmed our previous finding in cultured cells that Ads plays a role in osteoclastogenesis (OCG) and actin cytoskeletal organization in osteoclasts. Here we show that Ads is required for osteoclast formation and that when alveolar bone resorption is experimentally induced in mice, genetic deletion of Ads prevents osteoclast-mediated bone loss. Further, when Ads-null osteoclasts are cultured, they exhibit defective OCG, disorganized podosome-based actin filament superstructures, and decreased bone resorption. Reintroduction of Ads into Ads-null osteoclast precursor cells restored these osteoclast defects. Collectively, these data demonstrate a unique and osteoclast-specific role for Ads in OCG and osteoclast function.— Jiang, H., Wang, Y., Viniegra, A., Sima, C., McCulloch, C. A., Glogauer, M.

Here, we describe the first structure of the central AAA+ domain of the flagellar regulatory protein FlrC (FlrCC), a bEBP that controls flagellar synthesis in Vibrio cholerae. Our results showed that FlrCC forms heptamer both in nucleotide (Nt)-free and -bound states without ATP-dependent subunit remodeling. Unlike the bEBPs such as NtrC1 or PspF, a novel cis-mediated “all or none” ATP binding occurs in the heptameric FlrCC, because constriction at the ATPase site, caused by loop L3 and helix α7, restricts the proximity of the trans-protomer required for Nt binding. A unique “closed to open” movement of Walker A, assisted by trans-acting “Glu switch” Glu-286, facilitates ATP binding and hydrolysis. Fluorescence quenching and ATPase assays on FlrCC and mutants revealed that although Arg-349 of sensor II, positioned by trans-acting Glu-286 and Tyr-290, acts as a key residue to bind and hydrolyze ATP, Arg-319 of α7 anchors ribose and controls the rate of ATP hydrolysis by retarding the expulsion of ADP. Heptameric state of FlrCC is restored in solution even with the transition state mimicking ADP·AlF3. Structural results and pulldown assays indicated that L3 renders an in-built geometry to L1 and L2 causing σ54-FlrCC interaction independent of Nt binding.

The conserved AAA+ domain of the bEBPs, which is made of the signature motifs like Walker A, Walker B, sensor I and sensor II (Fig. 1), controls the oligomeric states, nucleotide (Nt) binding, hydrolysis, and/or conformational changes in the loops, implicated in RNAP-σ54 binding to initiate transcription (2Bush M.

Despite the conserved nature of the AAA+ domain, variation in the functional state of oligomerization and mode of Nt-binding of bEBPs emerged as matter of interest. Although Salmonella enterica NtrC and Aquifex aeolicus NtrC1 and NtrC4 are homologs made of regulatory (R), AAA+, and DNA binding domains, structural studies showed that their regulatory mechanisms are significantly different (3De Carlo S.

The ATP-bound AAA+ domain of A. aeolicus NtrC1E239A, revealed a heptameric assembly with asymmetry in the central channel (8Chen B. Sysoeva T.A. Chowdhury S. Guo L. De Carlo S. Hanson J.A. Yang H.

In this study, we have investigated for the first time the state of oligomerization, molecular mechanism of ATP binding, and hydrolysis of a bEBP, FlrC, which is involved in flagellar synthesis of Vibrio cholerae. Transcriptional regulation of the flagellar system of V. cholerae acts as an important signaling component of the pathogenic process positively regulating the factors that assist in arrival at the colonization site (14Syed K.A. Beyhan S. Correa N. Queen J. Liu J. Peng F. Satchell K.J. Yildiz F. Klose K.E. The Vibrio cholerae flagellar regulatory hierarchy controls expression of virulence factors.J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 6555-6570Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The transcription of the flagellar genes is organized in a hierarchy of four classes (15Prouty M.G. Correa N.E. Klose K.E. The novel σ54- and σ28-dependent flagellar gene transcription hierarchy of Vibrio cholerae.Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1595-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The class I gene product FlrA activates σ54-dependent transcription of the class II genes flrBC, which encode FlrC and its cognate kinase FlrB (16Klose K.E. Mekalanos J.J. Distinct roles of an alternative σ factor during both free-swimming and colonizing phases of the Vibrio cholerae pathogenic cycle.Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 501-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The expression of class III genes, which encode the basal body hook and the flagellin FlaA, is controlled by modulation of the activity of FlrC (16Klose K.E. Mekalanos J.J. Distinct roles of an alternative σ factor during both free-swimming and colonizing phases of the Vibrio cholerae pathogenic cycle.Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 501-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Although deletion of flrC produces a nonmotile V. cholerae strain with a modest colonization defect, a strain producing hyperactive FlrC shows altered cell morphology (16Klose K.E. Mekalanos J.J.

Phosphorylation of the flagellar regulatory protein FlrC is necessary for Vibrio cholerae motility and enhanced colonization.Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 743-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Homologs of FlrC that regulate a similar class of flagellar genes are found in all the other Vibrio spp. studied (19McCarter L.L. Polar flagellar motility of the Vibrionaceae.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 445-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), along with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20Dasgupta N. Wolfgang M.C. Goodman A.L. Arora S.K. Jyot J. Lory S. Ramphal R. A four-tiered transcriptional regulatory circuit controls flagellar biogenesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 809-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) and Campylobacter jejuni (21Hendrixson D.R. DiRita V.J.

Roles of rpoN, fliA, and flgR in expression of flagella in Campylobacter jejuni.J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2937-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), suggesting that similar mechanisms underlie the regulation of class III genes in polar flagellates. The σ54-dependent activators typically bind to the sites located upstream of the σ54 holoenzyme-binding site and contact RNAP-σ54 complex by a DNA looping mechanism (23Xu H. Hoover T.R. Transcriptional regulation at a distance in bacteria.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In contrast, FlrC binds the elements located downstream of the σ54 binding and transcriptional start sites of the flaA and flgK promoters (17Correa N.E. Klose K.E. Characterization of enhancer binding by the Vibrio cholerae flagellar regulatory protein FlrC.J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3158-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Although the downstream location of FlrC-binding sites is unusual, similar downstream binding is also observed in FleQ of P. aeruginosa for flhA, fliE, and fliL genes. Ramphal and co-workers (24Jyot J. Dasgupta N. Ramphal R. FleQ, the major flagellar gene regulator in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, binds to enhancer sites located either upstream or atypically downstream of the RpoN binding site.J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5251-5260Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) suggested that the close proximity of FleQ-binding sites to the σ54-dependent transcriptional start sites is incompatible with a DNA looping mechanism and argues for a direct interaction between activator and RNAP without looping, which may occur in the case of FlrC as well. FlrC includes the N-terminal R domain, central AAA+/σ54 interaction domain, and C-terminal DNA binding domain. Phosphorylation occurs on the conserved Asp-54 of the R domain by the cognate kinase, FlrB (18Correa N.E. Lauriano C.M. McGee R. Klose K.E. Phosphorylation of the flagellar regulatory protein FlrC is necessary for Vibrio cholerae motility and enhanced colonization.Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 743-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A V. cholerae strain containing an inactive (D54A) or constitutively active (M114I) FlrC mutant showed more severe colonization defects than strain lacking FlrC entirely, which implies that both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms of FlrC are required for the colonization, and locking FlrC into either an active or an inactive state would send incorrect stimuli into this stepwise colonization process (18Correa N.E. Lauriano C.M. McGee R. Klose K.E. Phosphorylation of the flagellar regulatory protein FlrC is necessary for Vibrio cholerae motility and enhanced colonization.Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 743-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the crystal structure of the central AAA+ domain of FlrC (FlrCC) in Nt-free and AMP-PNP (nonhydrolysable ATP analog)-bound states. Our results provide the first structural evidence for an AAA+-ATPase implicated in flagellar synthesis that forms heptamer both in Nt-free and -bound states without any Nt-dependent subunit remodeling. The major presence of the heptameric species is established in solution by the size exclusion chromatography and dynamic light scattering, in the ground and ADP + AlF3-mediated transition states of FlrCC. Strikingly, in contrast to the other bEBPs, FlrCC does not use any trans-acting residue for Nt binding, and the reason lies in the ATPase site architecture of the individual monomer. A unique “closed to open” conformational change occurs in Walker A of FlrCC to facilitate ATP binding. Structural observations coupled with fluorescence quenching and ATPase assay identified a novel trans-acting “Glu switch” that promotes the displacement of Walker A for ATP binding and hydrolysis. With a relatively wider central channel and an in-built architecture of the L1 loop, heptameric FlrCC interacts with σ54 both in Nt-free and -bound states. These intriguing observations open up a new avenue to further explore σ54-dependent transcriptional mechanism of such activators. The genes of FlrCC (amino acids 132–381) and σ54 (amino acids 1–487) from V. cholerae were cloned in pET28a+ within NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. The recombinant proteins with N-terminal His6 tag were overexpressed in BL21(DE3) and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography as per protocol described in Dey and Dasgupta (25Dey S. Dasgupta J. Purification, crystallization and preliminary x-ray analysis of the AAA+ σ54 activator domain of FlrC from Vibrio cholerae.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2013; 69: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Mutants E286A, R319A and R349A were prepared by two-step PCR. All the mutants were verified by commercial sequencing, and purifications were done following the same protocol as WT protein. Crystals of Nt-free and AMP-PNP-bound FlrCC were grown at 20 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Optimal crystals of Nt-free FlrCC were obtained when 4 μl of the protein solution (12 mg/ml) in a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol was mixed with 2 μl of precipitant solution consisting of 10% (w/v) PEG 6000, 0.1 m MES (pH 6.0) and was incubated over a reservoir solution of same composition. Initially, Nt-free FlrCC crystals diffracted up to 2.8 Å, but after further standardization, the resolution improved to 2.3 Å. AMP-PNP-bound FlrCC was prepared by mixing 20 μl of the protein solution (20 mg/ml) (in the same buffer as for Nt-free FlrCC) with 1 mm AMP-PNP and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. AMP-PNP-bound crystals of FlrCC were grown when 4 μl of the above mixture and 1.5 μl of the precipitant solution (consisting of 10% (w/v) PEG 6000, 0.1 m MES (pH 6.0)) were mixed and equilibrated for 4 days against 12% (w/v) PEG 6000, 0.1 m MES (pH 6.0), 0.1 m NaCl. Crystals were transferred to a cryo-protectant solution consisting of 40% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 2.5% (w/v) PEG 6000, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Crystals were then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and diffraction data were collected to 2.6Å. Diffraction data were collected at BM14 beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) at Grenoble, France. Data were processed and scaled using HKL2000 (26Minor W. Cymborowski M.

The model of Nt-free FlrCC was then used to solve the structure of AMP-PNP-bound FlrCC. Few cycles of simulated annealing, positional refinement, individual B-factor, and TLS refinement were accomplished by PHENIX (28Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N.

The structures were refined well with Rcryst of 19.4% (Rfree = 25.47%) and with Rcryst of 18.63% (Rfree = 24.66%) for Nt-free and AMP-PNP-bound FlrCC, respectively. Data collection and refinement statistics are given in Table 1. Fluorescence measurement was carried out using a spectrofluorometer, Hitachi F-7000. Changes in tryptophan (Trp-299) fluorescence were measured at an excitation wavelength of 295 nm, and the emission spectra were recorded between 300 and 400 nm with slit widths of 2.5 nm for both excitation and emission. All reactions were carried out at 25 °C. Equilibrium titrations of FlrCC, R319A, R349A, and E286A were carried out with AMP-PNP. The reactions were performed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2. For all proteins, the final concentrations were 5 μm and AMP-PNP concentration varied from 0 to 0.39 mm. The binding stoichiometry was determined using the protocol described in Mani et al. (30Mani R.S. Karimi-Busheri F. Fanta M. Cass C.E. Weinfeld M. Spectroscopic studies of DNA and ATP binding to human polynucleotide kinase: evidence for a ternary complex.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12077-12084Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The plot of log(F0 − F)/(F − F∝) against log [AMP-PNP], where F0, F, and F∝ are the fluorescence intensities of FlrCC alone, FlrCC, in the presence of various concentrations of AMP-PNP, and FlrCC saturated with AMP-PNP, respectively, yielded a straight line whose slope was a measure of the binding stoichiometry. The dissociation constant, Kd was determined using nonlinear curve fitting analysis as per Equations 1 and 2 (31Mir M.A. Dasgupta D. Association of the anticancer antibiotic chromomycin A(3) with the nucleosome: role of core histone tail domains in the binding process.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11578-11585Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All experimental points for the binding isotherms were fitted by the least squares methods. Kd=(C0−(ΔF/ΔFmax)C0)(Cp−(ΔF/ΔFmax)C0)/((ΔF/ΔFmax)C0)(Eq. 1) C0(ΔF/ΔFmax)2−(C0+Cp+Kd)(ΔF/ΔFmax)+Cp=0(Eq. 2) Although C0 denotes the input concentrations of the ligand AMP-PNP, Cp denotes the same for FlrCC and its mutants. ΔF is the change in fluorescence intensity at 340 nm (λex = 295 nm) for each point of titration curve, and ΔFmax is the same parameter when ligand is totally bound to the protein. A double-reciprocal plot of 1/ΔF against 1/(Cp − C0), as shown in Equation 3 was used to determine the ΔFmax. 1/ΔF=1/Δmax+Kd/(ΔFmax(Cp−C0))(Eq. 3) ΔFmax was calculated from the slope of the best fit line corresponding to the above plot. All experimental data points of the binding isotherm were fitted by linear fit analysis using Microsoft EXCEL and Origin 8.0. The equilibrium titrations of FlrCC and the mutant R319A were also carried out in the presence of ADP following the same process as of AMP-PNP. ATPase activity was determined with a procedure from the malachite green assay (32Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.M.

A malachite green colorimetric assay for protein phosphatase activity.Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) to monitor the release of inorganic phosphate (Pi). For ATPase assay, reaction mixtures containing FlrCC and the mutants E286A, R319A, and R349A (final concentration of 2.5 μm) were individually incubated with 0.1 mm ATP at 25 °C. The reaction buffer was made of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2. After 25 min of incubation, the reaction mixture was assayed for Pi. FlrCC in the absence of MgCl2 served as a negative control. Colored reagent containing 10 ml of 0.44 g of Malachite green dissolved in 0.3 m H2SO4, 2.5 ml of 7.5% ammonium molybdate, and 0.2 ml of 11% Tween 20 was added to the reaction mixture after 25 min, and the absorbance was measured at 630 nm within 5 min of adding the coloring reagent. The total Pi for each reaction was compared with a Pi standard curve prepared using KH2PO4. All the experiments were minimally performed in triplicates. Probable interactions between His6-tagged σ54 and tag-free FlrCC were monitored using Ni-NTA pulldown assay. 30 μl of Ni2+-NTA slurry (Qiagen) was washed with binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and the resin was then incubated in different batches with 50 μl of purified His6-tagged σ54 protein at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml at 25 °C for 20 min with intermittent gentle shaking. The beads were then washed three times with the binding buffer before adding FlrCC, FlrCC bound to ATP, and AMP-PNP individually. For activation, FlrCC was incubated for 10 min with ATP and AMP-PNP separately (1 mm). The mixture was then added to the σ54-bound Ni2+-NTA resin in molar excess and incubated for another 10 min at 25 °C. The beads were washed with the buffer and then resuspended in 20 μl of 4× SDS-polyacrylamide gel loading buffer and were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis and Coomassie Blue staining. Gel filtration chromatography experiments of FlrCC ± nucleotides were performed at room temperature in the running buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 using a Superdex 200 column (16 × 700 mm, GE Healthcare). A 200-μl sample containing FlrCC in the Nt-free state or with AMP-PNP or ADP.AlFx was injected onto the column and chromatographed at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. For the AMP-PNP-bound state, 0.3 mm FlrCC (0.3 mm) was preincubated for 15 min at 4 °C with 2 mm AMP-PNP. In case of FlrCC-ADP.AlFx state, FlrCC was incubated for 15 min at 4 °C with 2 mm ADP, 4 mm AlCl3, 20 mm NaF. During gel filtration of ADP + AlF3-treated FlrCC, the buffer used for chromatography was mixed with ADP, NaF, and AlCl3 to ensure the stability of the transition state in solution. The peak fractions were collected for SDS-PAGE analysis. Average pseudo partition coefficients were calculated as Kav = (Ve − Vo)/(Vc − Vo), where Ve is the elution volume; Vo is the void volume; and Vc is the total column volume. For calculating Kav, the column was calibrated with standard molecular weight calibration kit (GE Healthcare) made of blue dextran, ferritin (440 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), and conalbumin (75 kDa) (data not shown). DLS measurements were done with FlrCC samples directly"

To understand the helicase stimulatory mechanism of Ssl1/p44, we determined the crystal structure of the N-terminal regulatory domain of Ssl1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ssl1 forms a von Willebrand factor A fold in which a central six-stranded β-sheet is sandwiched between three α helices on both sides. Structural and biochemical analyses of Ssl1/p44 revealed that the β4-α5 loop, which is frequently found at the interface between von Willebrand factor A family proteins and cellular counterparts, is critical for the stimulation of Rad3/XPD. Yeast genetics analyses showed that double mutation of Leu-239 and Ser-240 in the β4-α5 loop of Ssl1 leads to lethality of a yeast strain, demonstrating the importance of the Rad3-Ssl1 interactions to cell viability. Here, we provide a structural model for the Rad3/XPD-Ssl1/p44 complex and insights into how the binding of Ssl1/p44 contributes to the helicase activity of Rad3/XPD and cell viability.

Initiation of eukaryotic transcription requires the assembly of RNA polymerase II and multiple general transcription factors, including TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH, at a promoter region. TFIIH, which possess 10 subunits, exhibits at least four enzymatic activities, including ATPase, helicase, kinase, and ubiquitin ligase, which are responsible for several fundamental cellular functions of TFIIH, such as DNA repair, cell cycle regulation, and transcription (1.Kim T.K.

Yeast/mammalian TFIIH comprises a core complex that is consisted of seven subunits (Rad3/XPD, Ssl2/XPB, Tfb1/p62, Tfb2/p52, Ssl1/p44, Tfb4/p34, and Tfb5/p8) and a Cdk-activating kinase (CAK) 4The abbreviations used are: CAKCdk-activating kinaseVWA or VWFAvon Willebrand factor ANERnucleotide excision repairEMelectron microscopyFOA5-fluoroorotic acidPDBProtein Data BankRMSDroot mean square deviation. complex containing three subunits (Kin28/CDK7, Ccl1/Cylin H, and Tfb3/MAT1).

XPD helicase activity is important for the maintenance of genomic stability, and its mutation causes DNA repair defects and abnormal TFIIH assembly, resulting in the genetic disorders xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne syndrome, and trichothiodystrophy, which cause premature aging and several types of cancer (14.Lehmann A.R.

Furthermore, an archaeal Ssl1/p44 homolog has not been identified. The TFIIH p44 subunit consists of three domains, namely, the N-terminal (residues 1–235), zinc finger (residues 291–308), and ring finger (residues 345–385) domains (10.Coin F. Marinoni J.C.

Xeroderma pigmentosum- and trichothiodystrophy-causing mutations in the N- and C-terminal regions of XPD destabilize its interactions with MAT1 and p44, respectively, and interfere with both transcription and DNA repair (23.Sandrock B.

The overall architectures of the yeast and human TFIIHs have been determined, and the subcomplex structures have been modeled into the overall electron microscopy (EM) density (3.Gibbons B.J. Brignole E.J. Azubel M. Murakami K. Voss N.R. Bushnell D.A. Asturias F.J. Kornberg R.D. Subunit architecture of general transcription factor TFIIH.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Molecular structure of human TFIIH.Cell. 2000; 102: 599-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). However, the structures of only a limited number of individual components are available, which hampers the modeling of complete TFIIH. It is unclear how Ssl1/p44 interacts with and stimulates Rad3/XPD helicase activity and how the disease-causing C-terminal mutations of Rad3/XPD are correlated with its interaction with Ssl1/p44. To address these questions, we have determined the crystal structure of the N-terminal regulatory domain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ssl1. The structure forms a nucleotide-binding fold with a central β-sheet flanked by two helical bundles. We show that the β4-α5 loop of Ssl1/p44 is important for the binding and stimulation of Rad3/XPD, and the interaction between Rad3/XPD and Ssl1/p44 is critical for cell viability. Based on the derived structure, mutation analysis, and genetics studies, we provide a model for the Rad3/XPD-Ssl1/p44 subcomplex. The cDNA encoding residues 1–350 of S. cerevisiae Ssl1 were inserted into the pET28a vector. Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells containing the pET28a (Ssl1 1–350) vector were cultured in Luria broth. After induction with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the cells were incubated at 28 °C for 12 h. Cell pellets were resuspended in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol) and lysed by sonication. The extract was centrifuged at 18,000 rpm for 1 h. The Ssl1 (1–350) protein was first purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography using the His tag at the N terminus of Ssl1 and then eluted with 500 mm imidazole in the same buffer. Fractions containing the Ssl1 (1–350) protein were subsequently purified using anion exchange (Mono Q) and gel filtration chromatography (Superdex 75). To aid crystallization of the Ssl1 N-terminal regulatory domain, the Ssl1 (1–350) fragment was subjected to limited proteolytic digestion by treatment with a 2000:1 ratio of subtilisin for 20 min at 10 °C. N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry analyses of the digested fragment revealed that the resulting Ssl1 fragment contained residues 108–328. The Ssl1(108–328) fragment was inserted into the pET28a vector, and the Ssl1 N-terminal regulatory domain was purified via nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. The protein was purified further using cation exchange (Mono S) and gel filtration chromatography. The selenomethionine-substituted Ssl1(108–328) protein was obtained from E. coli B834 (DE3) cells and purified using the same method as that used for native Ssl1. For biochemical assays, N-terminal histidine-tagged human TFIIH p44 proteins (wild type, T138R, or L174W/T175R) were purified using the same method for Ssl1 purification. Crystals of the Ssl1 N-terminal regulatory domain (108–328) were grown at 18 °C by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The crystallization buffer contained 28% polyethylene glycol 3350 and 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and the concentration of protein was 12 mg/ml. Diffraction data were collected at −170 °C using crystals flash-frozen in crystallization buffer containing 30% (w/v) glycerol. Diffraction data from selenomethionine-substituted Ssl1 core crystals were collected at 0.9791 Å on Beamline 4A using the Pohang Advanced Light Source. The Ssl1 regulatory domain crystals formed in the space group P3221 with the parameters a = 78.6 Å, b = 78.6 Å, c = 83.9 Å, α = 90, β = 90, and γ = 120, and contained one Ssl1 N-terminal regulatory domain protein in an asymmetric unit.

Sf9 cells were infected with baculoviruses expressing His-XPD, WT full-length His-p44, or the His-p44 1–252 or 252–395 fragment at the indicated multiplicity of infection (pfu/cell). In brief, the cells were collected 48 h after infection, washed once with 1× PBS containing 30% glycerol, resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P40, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture), and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min. The S. cerevisiae PDY2 Matα leu2Δ1 ura3–52 trp1Δ63 his3Δ200 Ssl1::Kan (pSsl1/316) haploid strain was a gift from Dr. Charles Cole (Dartmouth University). We generated a mutant plasmid (pSsl1/pRS314) using site-directed mutagenesis. We transformed the PDY2 cells using the pSsl1/pRS314 mutant plasmid and selected transformants on Ura(−)/Trp(−) synthetic complete medium plates. The transformed strains were cultured in YPD broth until they reached an A600 nm of 1.0. The yeast cells were then serially diluted 5-fold and spotted onto Trp(−)/FOA medium. G-Sepharose beads (5 μl) cross-linked with an anti-XPD antibody were washed with buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 150 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P40, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture) and then incubated with a large excess of XPD cell crude extract at 4 °C for 4 h. After the incubation, the beads were washed four times with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 1 m KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P40, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture) and twice with buffer B and then incubated with His-p44 WT or mutant cell crude extracts at 4 °C overnight. The beads were then washed four times with buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 400 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P40, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture) and twice with buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 0.01% Nonidet P40, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture). Following the washes, the beads were incubated in 1× Laemmli SDS buffer for electrophoresis at 95 °C for 30 min. The immobilized XPD-p44 complex was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. G-Sepharose beads bound to human XPD (150 ng) and the 2-fold excess of WT or mutant p44 complex were generated by the procedure described for the XPD-p44 binding assay. Helicase assays were performed as described previously (10.Coin F. Marinoni J.C. Rodolfo C. Fribourg S. Pedrini A.M. Egly J.M. Mutations in the XPD helicase gene result in XP and TTD phenotypes, preventing interaction between XPD and the p44 subunit of TFIIH.Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C in the presence of 4 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 50 mm KCl, 50 μg/ml BSA, and 1–3 ng of radioactive DNA substrate and were stopped by the addition of EDTA and SDS. The samples were loaded onto a 14% nondenaturing acrylamide gel, which was dried and analyzed by autoradiography. The DNA substrate for helicase assays was prepared by mixing oligonucleotides corresponding to fragment 6219–6253 of the single-stranded M13mp18(+) DNA with single-stranded M13mp18(−) DNA. Our initial attempt to crystallize full-length yeast Ssl1 (or human p44) or a fragment containing residues 1–350 was unsuccessful, presumably because of the presence of highly flexible regions. To identify the stable and compact domain of Ssl1, we performed a limited digestion analysis of Ssl1 (1–350) and identified a compact fragment comprising residues 108–328, with which we successfully obtained high diffraction quality crystals. In conjunction with previous results, our analysis showed that the human p44 fragment containing residues 1–252 (corresponding to residues 50–322 of Ssl1) is sufficient to interact with XPD (Fig. 1A, lane 8), whereas the C-terminal fragment (residues 252–395) does not bind to XPD (Fig. 1A, lane 9). Furthermore, residues 1–235 of p44 participate in stimulating the helicase activity of XPD (10.Coin F. Marinoni J.C. Rodolfo C. Fribourg S. Pedrini A.M. Egly J.M. Mutations in the XPD helicase gene result in XP and TTD phenotypes, preventing interaction between XPD and the p44 subunit of TFIIH.Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar); thus we named this region the “regulatory domain.” The structure of the Ssl1 regulatory domain was determined using the selenium single-wavelength anomalous dispersion scattering method at a resolution of 2.4 Å (Table 1). The final structure of Ssl1 contained residues 119–310, of which the N-terminal 11 residues and C-terminal 18 residues were disordered. The overall shape of the Ssl1 regulatory domain is a cuboid with six faces (Fig. 1, B and C). Ssl1 folds into an α/β structure in which a six-stranded sheet (in the order 6, 5, 4, 1, 2, and 3) forms a central core flanked by three amphipathic helices on each side. In addition, a short helix is located at the top of the sheet. With the exception of the β3 strand, all other strands are oriented in a parallel manner. The domain is 40 Å high, 30 Å wide across the β-sheet, and 40 Å broad. The top and bottom of the structure are both comprised of loops that connect the sheet to the helices (Fig. 1B). Because the central sheet is surrounded by helices and loops, fully or partially exposed residues are located primarily in the N-terminal α1-α2 loop, the β3-α3, α3-α4, and β4-α5 loops, the α5 and α6 helices, and the C-terminal end (Figs. 1, B and C, and 2). Among these exposed residues, highly conserved residues are located in the N-terminal region; in the α2-β2, β3-α3, and β4-α5 loops; and at the end of the α7 helix (Fig. 2). A database search using DALI revealed that Ssl1 resembles several members of the von Willebrand factor A (VWA) family proteins, including von Willebrand factor type A (PDB code 4FX5), 26S proteasome regulatory subunit RPN10 (PDB code 2X5N), Ku70 (PDB code 1JEY), TFIIH Tfb4/p34 subunit (PDB code 4PN7), and integrin αLβ2 (PDB code 1T0P), with root mean square deviations of 2.0–2.6 Å for 172–178 Cα atoms (Refs. 28.Holm L.

https://openalex.org/W1997550084,"Background A new CD4 point-of-care instrument, the CyFlow miniPOC, which provides absolute and percentage CD4 T-cells, used for screening and monitoring of HIV-infected patients in resource-limited settings, was introduced recently. We assessed the performance of this novel instrument in a reference laboratory and in a field setting in Senegal. Methodology A total of 321 blood samples were obtained from 297 adults and 24 children, all HIV-patients attending university hospitals in Dakar, or health centers in Ziguinchor. Samples were analyzed in parallel on CyFlow miniPOC, FACSCount CD4 and FACSCalibur to assess CyFlow miniPOC precision and accuracy. Results At the reference lab, CyFlow miniPOC, compared to FACSCalibur, showed an absolute mean bias of -12.6 cells/mm3 and a corresponding relative mean bias of -2.3% for absolute CD4 counts. For CD4 percentages, the absolute mean bias was -0.1%. Compared to FACSCount CD4, the absolute and relative mean biases were -31.2 cells/mm3 and -4.7%, respectively, for CD4 counts, whereas the absolute mean bias for CD4 percentages was 1.3%. The CyFlow miniPOC was able to classify HIV-patients eligible for ART with a sensitivity of ≥ 95% at the different ART-initiation thresholds (200, 350 and 500 CD4 cells/mm3). In the field lab, the room temperature ranged from 30 to 35°C during the working hours. At those temperatures, the CyFlow miniPOC, compared to FACSCount CD4, had an absolute and relative mean bias of 7.6 cells/mm3 and 2.8%, respectively, for absolute CD4 counts, and an absolute mean bias of 0.4% for CD4 percentages. The CyFlow miniPOC showed sensitivity equal or greater than 94%. Conclusion The CyFlow miniPOC showed high agreement with FACSCalibur and FACSCount CD4. The CyFlow miniPOC provides both reliable absolute CD4 counts and CD4 percentages even under the field conditions, and is suitable for monitoring HIV-infected patients in resource-limited settings."
https://openalex.org/W1983138894,"Objectives Long-term magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) follow-up studies regarding cryptogenic nonperimesencephalic subarachnoid hemorrhage (nSAH) are scarce. This single-centre study identified all patients with angiographically verified cryptogenic nSAH from 1998 to 2007: The two main objectives were to prospectively assess the incidence of de novo aneurysm with 3.0-MRI years after cryptogenic nSAH in patients without evidence for further hemorrhage, and retrospectively assess patient demographics and outcome. Methods From prospectively maintained report databases all patients with angiographically verified cryptogenic nSAH were identified. 21 of 29 patients received high-resolution 3T-MRI including time-of-flight and contrast-enhanced angiography, 10.2 ± 2.8 years after cryptogenic nSAH. MRA follow-up imaging was compared with initial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and CT/MRA. Post-hemorrhage images were related to current MRI with reference to persistent lesions resulting from delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) and post-hemorrhagic siderosis. Patient-based objectives were retrospectively abstracted from clinical databases. Results 29 patients were identified with cryptogenic nSAH, 17 (59%) were male. Mean age at time of hemorrhage was 52.9 ± 14.4 years (range 4 – 74 years). 21 persons were available for long-term follow-up. In these, there were 213.5 person years of MRI-follow-up. No de novo aneurysm was detected. Mean modified Rankin Scale (mRS) during discharge was 1.28. Post-hemorrhage radiographic vasospasm was found in three patients (10.3%); DCI-related lesions occurred in one patient (3.4%). Five patients (17.2%) needed temporary external ventricular drainage; long-term CSF shunt dependency was necessary only in one patient (3.4%). Initial DSA retrospectively showed a 2 x 2 mm aneurysm of the right distal ICA in one patient, which remained stable. Post-hemorrhage siderosis was detected 8.1 years after the initial bleeding in one patient (4.8%). Conclusion Patients with cryptogenic nSAH have favourable outcomes and do not exhibit higher risks for de novo aneurysms. Therefore the need for long-term follow up after cryptogenic nSAH is questionable."
