Since a similar ribonucleoprotein from yeast is stabilized by low concentrations of magnesium or calcium (4,5), it seemed probable that dibasic ions were the effective constituents of the liver dialysate. Dilute solutions of magnesium salts can be substituted for the liver dialysate. The magnesium concentration, however, is critical; too much magnesium causes aggregation and precipitation of the ribonucleoprotein, whereas too little leads to dissociation into smaller units. The optimal concentration of magnesium depends on the pH and on the nature and concentration of the other ions in the solution. In this paper an improved method of purification is described, in which the RNPl is washed in a buffer containing magnesium chloride, and further purified by precipitation with barium acetate. The changes in the structure of the RNP which result from variations in magnesium concentration, pH, and the ionic composition of the solution, have been followed in the analytical ultracentrifuge."

Cohn (I) and Davis and Allen (2) have described a nucleotide in yeast ribonucleic acids, the nucleoside of which has recently been identified as 5ribosyluracil.’ Littlefield and Dunn (3) have found small amounts of thymine, 2-methyladenine, N6-methyladenine2 (6methylaminopurine), and Ne-dimethyladenine (6-dimethylaminopurine) in ribonucleic acids from yeast, several bacterial species, and wheat germ. The latter two bases were also found in the ribonucleic acids of rat liver microsomes. These bases were shown to have been present originally as nucleotides in 3’) 5’phosphodiester linkage in the ribonucleic acids of E. coli. Adler et cd. (4) have detected N6-methyladenine, N2-methylguanine (2methylamino-6-hydroxypurine) and one-methylguanine in acid hydrolysates of commercial preparations of yeast ribonuclcic acids, and Kemp and Allen (5) have described three unknown nucleotide components that are present in minor amounts in ribonucleic acids from dog pancreas. This paper reports the separation of four trace nucleotides, in addition to the one previously described (1, 2) from a yeast ribonucleic acid fraction that is soluble in 1 1% sodium chloride. This fraction is ordinarily discarded during the preparation of yeast ribonucleic acids by the procedure of Crestfield et al (6). The identity of three of the trace nucleotides, and certain characteristics of these nucleotides as well as of the ribonucleic acid fraction in which they are found, are reported."
