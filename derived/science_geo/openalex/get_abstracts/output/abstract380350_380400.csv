Most current sewage treatment plants are aimed at removing organic matter only. They are energy-inefficient, whereas potentially the organic matter could be regarded as a source of energy. However, organic carbon is not the only pollutant in sewage: Fixed nitrogen such as ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3−) must be removed to avoid toxic algal blooms in the environment. Conventional wastewater treatment systems for nitrogen removal require a lot of energy to create aerobic conditions for bacterial nitrification, and also use organic carbon to help remove nitrate by bacterial denitrification (see the figure). An alternative approach is the use of anoxic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) bacteria, which require less energy ( 1 ) but grow relatively slowly. We explore process innovations that can speed up the anammox process and use all organic matter as much as possible for energy generation."

https://openalex.org/W2052669763,"Dengue virus co-circulates as four serotypes, and sequential infections with more than one serotype are common. One hypothesis for the increased severity seen in secondary infections is antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) leading to increased replication in Fc receptor-bearing cells. In this study, we have generated a panel of human monoclonal antibodies to dengue virus. Antibodies to the structural precursor-membrane protein (prM) form a major component of the response. These antibodies are highly cross-reactive among the dengue virus serotypes and, even at high concentrations, do not neutralize infection but potently promote ADE. We propose that the partial cleavage of prM from the viral surface reduces the density of antigen available for viral neutralization, leaving dengue viruses susceptible to ADE by antibody to prM, a finding that has implications for future vaccine design."
https://openalex.org/W1989015932,"No Dicer for Me MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs found in most eukaryotes. Most are processed from primary transcripts in the nucleus by the microprocessor enzyme complex, which includes the nuclease Drosha, with a small number being generated by the messenger RNA splicing machinery. All pre-miRNAs are then exported into the cytoplasm where they are cleaved further by a second nuclease, Dicer, into the mature, functional miRNA. Cifuentes et al. (p. 1694 , published online 6 May), now show that in a Dicer mutant fish at least one miRNA, miR-451, is still formed from pre-miR-451. The processing of pre-miR-451 requires the slicing activity of another protein in the miRNA pathway, Argonaute2. The unusual secondary structure of the pre-miR-451 determines its noncanonical processing pathway, which suggests that other miRNAs might also be processed in this way."
https://openalex.org/W2002360764,"H(2)S, the most recently discovered gasotransmitter, might in fact be the evolutionary matriarch of this family, being both ancient and highly reduced. Disruption of gamma-cystathionase in mice leads to cardiovascular dysfunction and marked hypertension, suggesting a key role for this enzyme in H(2)S production in the vasculature. However, patients with inherited deficiency in gamma-cystathionase apparently do not present vascular pathology. A mitochondrial pathway disposes sulfide and couples it to oxidative phosphorylation while also exposing cytochrome c oxidase to this metabolic poison. This report focuses on the biochemistry of H(2)S biogenesis and clearance, on the molecular mechanisms of its action, and on its varied biological effects."

https://openalex.org/W1986098635,"Fat-Burning Fat In mammals, fat exists in two forms—the well-known white adipose tissue (WAT), which stores energy and is associated with obesity, and the lesser-known brown adipose tissue (BAT), which burns energy to generate heat. BAT's role in human physiology was once thought to be restricted to newborns, but the recent discovery that adults also harbor functional BAT has re-ignited interest in the factors regulating BAT development and their potential as targets for anti-obesity therapies. Vegiopoulos et al. (p. 1158 , published online 6 May; see the Perspective Ishibashi and Seale ) now show that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an enzyme critical to prostaglandin synthesis, triggers fat progenitor cells in mice to differentiate into BAT rather than WAT. Mice overexpressing COX-2 displayed increased energy expenditure and were protected from diet-induced obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2041848251,"Initiator for Coated Pit Assembly During clathrin-mediated endocytosis, it has been thought that the sensing and binding of the clathrin adaptor protein AP2 to cargo and lipids leads to the recruitment of clathrin, nucleating the formation of a clathrin-coated pit. Henne et al. (p. 1281 , published online 6 May) have now found that this process of AP2 binding may not in fact represent either the first or the nucleation event of endocytosis. Instead, ubiquitous proteins called FCHo1/2 (F-BAR proteins) bind to the plasma membrane and define the sites of endocytosis independently of AP2. The F-BAR protein can generate very low curvature and, at higher concentration, generates higher curvature like those required at the neck of budding vesicles. The C terminus of the protein has a mu-homology domain (with homology to the mu domain of the AP2 complex) that interacts with Eps15 and intersectin, and via these proteins recruits AP2, which further recruits clathrin. Thus, a curvature-inducing protein can act to nucleate clathrin-coated pit assembly during endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2088661882,"Recent progress in solid-state quantum information processing has stimulated the search for amplifiers and frequency converters with quantum-limited performance in the microwave range. Depending on the gain applied to the quadratures of a single spatial and temporal mode of the electromagnetic field, linear amplifiers can be classified into two categories (phase sensitive and phase preserving) with fundamentally different noise properties. Phase-sensitive amplifiers use squeezing to reduce the quantum noise, but are useful only in cases in which a reference phase is attached to the signal, such as in homodyne detection. A phase-preserving amplifier would be preferable in many applications, but such devices have not been available until now. Here we experimentally realize a proposal for an intrinsically phase-preserving, superconducting parametric amplifier of non-degenerate type. It is based on a Josephson ring modulator, which consists of four Josephson junctions in a Wheatstone bridge configuration. The device symmetry greatly enhances the purity of the amplification process and simplifies both its operation and its analysis. The measured characteristics of the amplifier in terms of gain and bandwidth are in good agreement with analytical predictions. Using a newly developed noise source, we show that the upper bound on the total system noise of our device under real operating conditions is three times the quantum limit. We foresee applications in the area of quantum analog signal processing, such as quantum non-demolition single-shot readout of qubits, quantum feedback and the production of entangled microwave signal pairs."
https://openalex.org/W1964767412,"The transcriptional co-activator PGC-1alpha and the NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 are considered important inducers of mitochondrial biogenesis because in the nucleus they regulate transcription of nucleus-encoded mitochondrial genes. We demonstrate that PGC-1alpha and SIRT1 are also present inside mitochondria and are in close proximity to mtDNA. They interact with mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) as assessed by confocal microscopy analysis and by blue native-PAGE. Nucleoid purification allowed us to identify SIRT1 and PGC-1alpha as proteins associated with native and cross-linked nucleoids, respectively. After mtDNA immunoprecipitation analysis, carried out on mitochondrial extracts, we found that PGC-1alpha is present on the same D-loop region recognized by TFAM. Finally, by oligonucleotide pulldown assay, we found PGC-1alpha and SIRT1 associated with the TFAM consensus sequence (human mitochondrial transcription factor-binding site H). The results obtained suggest that in mitochondria PGC-1alpha and SIRT1 may function as their nuclear counterparts and represent the genuine factors mediating the cross-talk between nuclear and mitochondrial genome. Finally, this work adds new knowledge on the function of SIRT1 and PGC-1alpha and highlights the direct involvement of such proteins in regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2160822369,"Without therapy, most people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) ultimately progress to AIDS. Rare individuals ('elite controllers') maintain very low levels of HIV RNA without therapy, thereby making disease progression and transmission unlikely. Certain HLA class I alleles are markedly enriched in elite controllers, with the highest association observed for HLA-B57 (ref. 1). Because HLA molecules present viral peptides that activate CD8(+) T cells, an immune-mediated mechanism is probably responsible for superior control of HIV. Here we describe how the peptide-binding characteristics of HLA-B57 molecules affect thymic development such that, compared to other HLA-restricted T cells, a larger fraction of the naive repertoire of B57-restricted clones recognizes a viral epitope, and these T cells are more cross-reactive to mutants of targeted epitopes. Our calculations predict that such a T-cell repertoire imposes strong immune pressure on immunodominant HIV epitopes and emergent mutants, thereby promoting efficient control of the virus. Supporting these predictions, in a large cohort of HLA-typed individuals, our experiments show that the relative ability of HLA-B alleles to control HIV correlates with their peptide-binding characteristics that affect thymic development. Our results provide a conceptual framework that unifies diverse empirical observations, and have implications for vaccination strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2125797555,"It is now possible to perform whole-genome shotgun sequencing as well as capture of specific genomic regions for extinct organisms. However, targeted resequencing of large parts of nuclear genomes has yet to be demonstrated for ancient DNA. Here we show that hybridization capture on microarrays can successfully recover more than a megabase of target regions from Neandertal DNA even in the presence of approximately 99.8% microbial DNA. Using this approach, we have sequenced approximately 14,000 protein-coding positions inferred to have changed on the human lineage since the last common ancestor shared with chimpanzees. By generating the sequence of one Neandertal and 50 present-day humans at these positions, we have identified 88 amino acid substitutions that have become fixed in humans since our divergence from the Neandertals."

https://openalex.org/W2022084199,"Too Much of a Good Thing In peripheral nerves, the insulating myelin sheath speeds up electrical conductivity by allowing impulses to skip down the axon from node to node. Axons signal using neuregulin to get the Schwann cells to begin their wrap-around insulation project. But when is enough myelin too much? Cotter et al. (p. 1415 , published online 6 May) have now found the signal that stops further rounds of myelin insulation. In developing mice, the proteins Dlg1 (mammalian disc large 1) and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) were involved in calling a halt to insulation during early development. The balance between not enough and too much myelin insulation is controlled by opposing signals, which together optimize both the myelination and the velocity of nerve conduction."
https://openalex.org/W2167021817,"Primitive interplanetary dust is expected to contain the earliest solar system components, including minerals and organic matter. We have recovered, from central Antarctic snow, ultracarbonaceous micrometeorites whose organic matter contains extreme deuterium (D) excesses (10 to 30 times terrestrial values), extending over hundreds of square micrometers. We identified crystalline minerals embedded in the micrometeorite organic matter, which suggests that this organic matter reservoir could have formed within the solar system itself rather than having direct interstellar heritage. The high D/H ratios, the high organic matter content, and the associated minerals favor an origin from the cold regions of the protoplanetary disk. The masses of the particles range from a few tenths of a microgram to a few micrograms, exceeding by more than an order of magnitude those of the dust fragments from comet 81P/Wild 2 returned by the Stardust mission."

https://openalex.org/W2068717545,"For decades, the material associated with photovoltaic (PV) cells has been silicon. However, after many years of development, cadmium telluride (CdTe) PV modules have become the lowest-cost producer of solar electricity, despite working at lower efficiency than crystalline silicon cells. CdTe sales are growing rapidly, but there is concern about projecting hundredfold increases in power production relative to current production with CdTe PV modules. One reason is that Te, a humble nonmetal that is actually abundant in the universe, is as rare as many of the precious metals recovered from Earth's crust ( 1 ). Furthermore, current technology now uses Te at rates that are substantial fractions of its supply. Here, I argue that the long-term potential for CdTe PV modules need not be bleak, given realistic developments in module technology and Te recovery."
https://openalex.org/W1967015107,"Huntington disease is caused by expanded polyglutamine sequences in huntingtin, which procures its aggregation into intracellular inclusion bodies (IBs). Aggregate intermediates, such as soluble oligomers, are predicted to be toxic to cells, yet because of a lack of quantitative methods, the kinetics of aggregation in cells remains poorly understood. We used sedimentation velocity analysis to define and compare the heterogeneity and flux of purified huntingtin with huntingtin expressed in mammalian cells under non-denaturing conditions. Non-pathogenic huntingtin remained as hydrodynamically elongated monomers in vitro and in cells. Purified polyglutamine-expanded pathogenic huntingtin formed elongated monomers (2.4 S) that evolved into a heterogeneous aggregate population of increasing size over time (100–6,000 S). However, in cells, mutant huntingtin formed three major populations: monomers (2.3 S), oligomers (mode s20,w = 140 S) and IBs (mode s20,w = 320,000 S). Strikingly, the oligomers did not change in size heterogeneity or in their proportion of total huntingtin over 3 days despite continued monomer conversion to IBs, suggesting that oligomers are rate-limiting intermediates to IB formation. We also determined how a chaperone known to modulate huntingtin toxicity, Hsc70, influences in-cell huntingtin partitioning. Hsc70 decreased the pool of 140 S oligomers but increased the overall flux of monomers to IBs, suggesting that Hsc70 reduces toxicity by facilitating transfer of oligomers into IBs. Together, our data suggest that huntingtin aggregation is streamlined in cells and is consistent with the 140 S oligomers, which remain invariant over time, as a constant source of toxicity to cells irrespective of total load of insoluble aggregates.

IntroductionThe misfolding and aggregation of proteins is thought to underlie pathogenesis in a range of amyloid-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer, Creutzfeldt-Jakob, and Parkinson diseases (1Chiti F.

The mutations lead to an expansion in an N-terminal polyglutamine (polyQ) sequence to beyond an HD threshold of 37 residues (6MacDonald M.E. Ambrose C.M. Duyao M.P. Myers R.H. Lin C. Srinidhi L.

Longer polyQ sequences correlate with faster aggregation rates and earlier ages of disease onset, which implicates the intrinsic aggregation potential as central to the mechanisms causing pathogenesis.A key marker of pathology is the coalescence of mutant Htt into punctate intracellular reservoirs of aggregates known as inclusion bodies (IBs), yet despite intensive research over the last 20 years, it is still not well understood how this process, or how aggregation more generally, relates to cellular dysfunction. Although IB co-sequestration of other cellular components has been postulated as a mode of toxicity in HD (7Steffan J.S. Kazantsev A. Spasic-Boskovic O. Greenwald M. Zhu Y.Z. Gohler H. Wanker E.E.

Mitra S. Schweitzer E.S. Segal M.R. Finkbeiner S. Nature. 2004; 431: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar).Although it is now well established that SDS insolubility of mutant Htt loosely correlates to inclusions, there is a dearth of knowledge about the kinetics of aggregation of native Htt complexes expressed directly in the cellular environment (9Andreas W. Corinna K. Ben W. Kirupa S. Miriam B. Etienne R. Gillian P.B. Paolo P. J. Neurochem. 2008; 104: 846-858PubMed Google Scholar). Knowledge of this process is fundamentally important to understanding the earliest molecular steps of pathogenesis and for determining how the cellular machinery engages with the mutant forms of Htt. Several studies examining mutant Htt in cellular contexts have unequivocally identified the presence of oligomers in the range of 5–80 nm (10Mukai H. Isagawa T. Goyama E. Tanaka S. Bence N.F.

Other work has shown that SDS-insoluble oligomers accumulate in cell culture and transgenic mouse models of HD prior to visible inclusions (9Andreas W. Corinna K. Ben W. Kirupa S. Miriam B. Etienne R. Gillian P.B. Paolo P. J. Neurochem. 2008; 104: 846-858PubMed Google Scholar). However, insight into the full heterogeneity, quantity, and flux of the soluble forms of Htt under non-denaturing conditions has been hampered by a lack of high resolution and unbiased approaches to directly characterize and quantify these forms (13Hatters D.M. IUBMB Life. 2008; 60: 724-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).We sought to investigate the aggregation kinetics of mutant huntingtin expressed in mammalian cells using fluorescence-adapted sedimentation velocity (SV) analysis in the analytical ultracentrifuge. SV analysis is a powerful approach for defining complex molecular size distributions and hydrodynamic properties of soluble proteins, including that of aggregating proteins (14Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3005) Google Scholar, 15MacRaild C.A. Hatters D.M. Lawrence L.J. Howlett G.J. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2562-2569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, only recently have advances in analytical ultracentrifugation hardware enabled green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged proteins to be uniquely tracked in complex solutions by virtue of the GFP fluorescence (16MacGregor I.K. Anderson A.L. Laue T.M. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 108: 165-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In principle, this allows selective detection of the GFP-tagged protein from all other cellular components and extends the utility of SV analysis from purified proteins into more natural biological complexes, such as those in cell lysates. Recent studies have used this approach to measure the size and heterogeneity of fluorescently labeled purified proteins in the presence of other macromolecules, including serum, yet the approach has yet to be examined on endogenous proteins expressed directly in mammalian cells or on proteins that are known to aggregate intracellularly in neurodegenerative diseases, such as HD (17Kingsbury J.S.

We extended our analysis to probe how the cognate heat shock protein 70 chaperone, Hsc70, which has been implicated in mediating Httex1 toxicity and aggregation, binds to Httex1 and influences the heterogeneity of the intracellular pools of Httex1 when co-expressed with Httex1 in neuroblastoma cells (23Jana N.R.

This construct contains a linker region between Hsc70 and Emerald similar to that of a previously described construct that was validated to have normal chaperone activity (26Kim S. Nollen E.A. Kitagawa K. Bindokas V.P. Morimoto R.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar).The Y66L mutation was introduced into Emerald using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. This mutation removes a critical residue involved in fluorophore formation but does not alter the overall structure of the protein (27Rosenow M.A. Huffman H.A. Phail M.E. Wachter R.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4464-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). All vectors were sequenced and verified for accuracy within the cDNA regions. The resultant protein sequences expressed off these vectors are shown in supplemental Fig. S1.Preparation of Cells and Lysates for Analytical Ultracentrifugation2.5 × 106 Neuro2a cells were plated on a T25 culture flask and maintained in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. The following day, the cells were transfected with 10 μg of total plasmid DNA and 25 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Medium was replaced daily. For the time course studies, cells were rinsed with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and imaged on an AF6000 fluorescence microscope (Leica) with a HCX PL FLUOTAR 10.0 × 0.30 DRY objective. Data were collected with the GFP filter cube and recorded in 12-bit with a DFC360FX camera. Cells were harvested by rinsing in PBS before removal from the flask with a cell scraper in 4 ml of PBS. Cells were pelleted (1,000 × g; 2.5 min), resuspended in 1 ml PBS, transferred to a 2-ml microcentrifuge tube, and pelleted again (1,800 × g; 4 min). The pellet was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored overnight at −80 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of chilled lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science; 1 tablet per 10 ml of solution), 20 units/ml Benzonase (Novagen)) and extruded through a 27-gauge syringe needle 25 times on ice. NaCl concentration was adjusted to 150 mm. Single-use aliquots were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Total cellular protein concentrations were determined in triplicate by a BCA protein assay (Thermo Scientific) with bovine serum albumin as the standard.Analytical UltracentrifugationFor the recombinant proteins, proteins were prepared at 0.7 μm in diluent buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm imidazole, 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 0.1% (w/v) sodium azide). For the lysates, samples were adjusted to 0.2 or 0.5 mg/ml total protein concentration and 0 or 2 m sucrose concentrations with lysis buffer (containing 150 mm NaCl) and freshly prepared 3 m sucrose, added by weight. Sucrose stock solutions were made by heating sucrose with water and stirring until dissolved and were calibrated for concentration and density by refractive index at 20 °C (28Lide D.R. CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics. CRC Press, Inc, Boca Raton, FL1996: 8-76Google Scholar). Final sucrose concentrations were verified in the sample by refractive index.Samples were loaded into two-channel sapphire window charcoal/Epon sedimentation velocity cells (Beckman-Coulter) with 50 μl of FC-43 heavy oil (Fluorinert). Cells were placed in a prechilled 8-hole AnTi rotor (Beckman-Coulter) and equilibrated to 7 °C in an XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman-Coulter) fitted with a fluorescence detection system (Aviv) (16MacGregor I.K. Anderson A.L. Laue T.M. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 108: 165-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Radial fluorescence scans were collected continuously at 50,000 or 3,000 rpm using a 488-nm laser for excitation and 520-nm cut-off emission filter and with the photomultiplier voltage kept constant in each experiment.Data were analyzed using SEDFIT (29Schuck P.

High speed data sets were fitted to c(s) distributions (29Schuck P. Perugini M.A. Gonzales N.R. Howlett G.J. Schubert D. Biophys.

Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1387-1403Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Low speed data sets were fitted to ls-g*(s) distributions (14Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3005) Google Scholar). For c(s) and ls-g*(s) (except for the 2 m sucrose data), data were fitted with radial independent and, in some cases, time-independent noise and with confidence levels (F-ratio) of 0.95. For samples containing 2 m sucrose, data were fitted similarly except without radial or time-dependent noise, with the base line floated to account for the non-sedimenting material, and with a confidence level of 0.99. The meniscus and bottom positions were fixed. Sedimentation coefficients for samples lacking sucrose were corrected to s20,w using Sednterp (J. Philo). For samples containing 2 m sucrose, s20,w was calculated as described previously (32Jacob L. Marc S.L. Peter S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2067-2079PubMed Google Scholar) using previously reported values for density and viscosity of concentrated sucrose solutions (33Longinotti M.P. Horacio R.C. J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data. 2008; 37: 1503-1515Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar).StatisticsDifferences in IB frequency or Htt partitioning between cells expressing Httex146Q-Emerald/β-galactosidase with cells expressing Httex146Q-Emerald/Hsc70- Emerald(Y66L) over 3 days transient expression were evaluated using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in Sigmaplot 11 software. Significance was evaluated using the Holm-Sidak method with p = 0.05.DISCUSSIONUsing analytical ultracentrifugation for quantifying molecular size and heterogeneity under non-denaturing conditions, we identified several key findings. First, we found that purified mutant Htt self-associates from an expanded monomeric conformation into a heterogeneous population of aggregates that systematically increased in modal size over 3 days (50–6000 S). This is consistent with other studies showing that Httex1 forms amyloid-like fibrils and also that analytical ultracentrifugation can be used to measure fibrillization rates and fibrillar size heterogeneity (15MacRaild C.A. Hatters D.M. Lawrence L.J. Howlett G.J. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2562-2569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 34Hatters D.M. MacPhee C.E. Lawrence L.J. Sawyer W.H.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 4604-4609Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The finding that huntingtin monomers adopt an expanded conformation is also consistent with findings of others (35Kim M.W. Chelliah Y. Kim S.W. Otwinowski Z. Bezprozvanny I. Structure. 2009; 17: 1205-1212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 47Bennett M.J. Huey-Tubman K.E. Herr A.B. West Jr., A.P. Ross S.A. Bjorkman P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 11634-11639Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, our work extends this knowledge into the cellular environment, whereby monomeric Httex1 remained in a remarkably similar expanded conformation and did not appear to bind appreciably to other intracellular ligands (less than 5% of the total “monomeric” pool of mutant and non-mutant Htt appeared in complex with other species). It is noteworthy that these results contrast with recent reports that polyQ fragments form mechanically collapsed disordered structures (48Crick S.L. Jayaraman M. Frieden C. Wetzel R. Pappu R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16764-16769Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 49Dougan L. Li J. Badilla C.L. Berne B.J. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 12605-12610Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and the apparent discrepancy may be explained by the flanking residues of the polyQ sequence in Htt (notably the Pro-rich region C-terminal to the polyQ sequence) promoting more extended, non-compact conformations. Another possibility we cannot exclude is that the Emerald/Cerulean fusion tag alters the structural properties of the Htt exon 1 sequence. Alternatively, it remains possible that a subset of “collapsed” conformations remain undetected if these forms cause the Cerulean/Emerald moiety to not fold properly.A striking and novel finding from our study was that oligomers formed by mutant Htt in neuroblastoma cells were static in the proportion of total Htt molecules and in their size heterogeneity despite continued conversion of monomers to IBs. Hence, the 140 S oligomers may present a rate-limiting step in the trafficking of small huntingtin aggregates to IBs through a series of highly compartmentalized intermediates (with a sharp mode of 140 S followed by an extended tail in the distribution extending up to ∼1600 S). These species may denote specific complexes with different cellular machineries or simply be larger oligomers and small fibrils that are constantly moved into the IBs via a rate limited mode of action. This result is supported by recent electron micrograph images of IBs in the human brain, showing oligomeric structures of a similar size to the oligomers in our study (∼30–60 nm) located at the periphery of an IB (50Legleiter J. Mitchell E. Lotz G.P. Sapp E. Ng C. DiFiglia M. Thompson L.M. Muchowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 14777-14790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Similar sized structures ∼30 nm in diameter have also been purified from Httex1-transfected cells or brain tissue of transgenic mouse models of HD (12Sathasivam K. Lane A. Legleiter J. Warley A. Woodman B. Finkbeiner S. Paganetti P. Muchowski P.J. Wilson S. Bates G.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2010; 19: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 51Iwata A. Riley B.E. Johnston J.A. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40282-40292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Larger fibrillar structures have also been reported in IBs from ex vivo HD brain samples (52DiFiglia M. Sapp E. Chase K.O. Davies S.W. Bates G.P. Vonsattel J.P. Aronin N. Science. 1997; 277: 1990-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (2284) Google Scholar), which could reflect the larger species (>500 S) within the 140 S pool that more closely match the sedimentation coefficients of recombinant fibrils.Genetic and biochemical evidence have shown that IB formation is a regulated process driven by dynein-mediated retrograde transport to the microtubule organizing center, consistent with our results suggesting that small oligomers are formed in a regulated fashion (38Wang Y. Meriin A.B. Zaarur N. Romanova N.V. Chernoff Y.O. Costello C.E. Sherman M.Y. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 53Kopito R.R.

Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). It remains to be examined whether the different sized oligomers within the 140 S pool contain components of trafficking or quality control machinery or indeed have the same structural architecture relative to the other forms within the pool and with small fibrils formed by purified Htt. An alternative possibility is that the oligomers are off-track to IB formation and present a parallel partition that may be handled by distinct cellular machineries. For example, it remains an intriguing possibility that a subset of monomers indeed do adopt a collapsed coil conformation as proposed (48Crick S.L. Jayaraman M. Frieden C. Wetzel R. Pappu R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16764-16769Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 49Dougan L. Li J. Badilla C.L. Berne B.J. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 12605-12610Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) but that these forms are rapidly recruited into larger macromolecular complexes comprising other cellular machinery.An important consequence of our results in light of studies showing IBs to correlate poorly with cellular toxicity is that oligomers are clearly uncorrelated to the presence of IBs or monomers (3Arrasate M. Mitra S. Schweitzer E.S. Segal M.R. Finkbeiner S. Nature. 2004; 431: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar). More importantly, if oligomers are indeed the most toxic molecular form, as previously postulated (4Takahashi Y. Okamoto Y. Popiel H.A. Fujikake N. Toda T. Kinjo M. Nagai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24039-24048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 5Takahashi T. Kikuchi S. Katada S. Nagai Y. Nishizawa M. Onodera O. Hum. Mol.

Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 891-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), then this implicates whole populations of cells under a steady and constant duress from mutant Httex1 toxicity. Hence, specifically mediating the pool of oligomers offers an attractive therapeutic target to modulate toxicity and provides more specificity than current approaches targeting total inclusion/SDS insoluble protein levels or monomer levels.Our results also showed that Hsc70 facilitated the flux of Httex146Q monomers to IBs, a result consistent with other findings in that Hsp70 family proteins alone do not prevent the aggregation of Httex1 despite suppressing Htt toxicity (40Zhou H. Li S.H. Li X.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48417-48424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 41Rujano M.A. Kampinga H.H. Salomons F.A. Exp.

Muchowski P.J. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 9104-9114Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The binding appeared to be highly dynamic and transient, which is consistent with Hsp70 family proteins binding substrates by dynamic on-off cycling (56Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3090) Google Scholar). Hsc70 has been suggested to bind polyQ-mediated IBs in a highly transient fashion (26Kim S. Nollen E.A. Kitagawa K. Bindokas V.P. Morimoto R.I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 57Matsumoto G. Kim S. Morimoto R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4477-4485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, Hsc70 seems to act as a carrier in the traffic of Httex1 to the IBs, yet we cannot determine from our studies whether this is through direct binding to monomers or is independent of the 140 S population. The efficacy of Hsc70 in the traffic and binding to Httex146Q may be limited by other components of the quality control network, such as Hsp40 co-chaperones, which have been shown to suppress IBs and to work in tandem with Hsp70 proteins to alter the morphology of Httex1 aggregates (23Jana N.R. Tanaka M. Wang G.-h. Nukina N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2009-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 31Wacker J.L. Zareie M.H. Fong H. Sarikaya M. Muchowski P.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1215-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar).In conclusion, we have used SV analysis to provide unprecedented insight into the molecular heterogeneity and hydrodynamic properties of all Htt molecules in the cellular milieu under non-denaturing conditions and without prepurification or prefractionation steps. Most noteworthy is the observation of a large pool of 140 S oligomers that are invariant in size and seem to be uncorrelated to the presence of monomers or IBs. This methodology will be useful for the study of parameters that mediate the aggregation pathway and for research in other neurodegenerative diseases that have been associated with oligomers, such as Alzheimer disease. IntroductionThe misfolding and aggregation of proteins is thought to underlie pathogenesis in a range of amyloid-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer, Creutzfeldt-Jakob, and Parkinson diseases (1Chiti F. Dobson C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 333-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (5050) Google Scholar).

Genet. 2007; 17: 345-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The mutations lead to an expansion in an N-terminal polyglutamine (polyQ) sequence to beyond an HD threshold of 37 residues (6MacDonald M.E. Ambrose C.M. Duyao M.P. Myers R.H. Lin C. Srinidhi L. Barnes G. Taylor S.A. James M. Groot N. MacFarlane H. Jenkins B. Anderson M.A. Wexler N.S. Gusella J.F. Bates G.P. Baxendale S. Hummerich H. Kirby S. North M. Youngman S. Mott R. Zehetner G.

Longer polyQ sequences correlate with faster aggregation rates and earlier ages of disease onset, which implicates the intrinsic aggregation potential as central to the mechanisms causing pathogenesis.A key marker of pathology is the coalescence of mutant Htt into punctate intracellular reservoirs of aggregates known as inclusion bodies (IBs), yet despite intensive research over the last 20 years, it is still not well understood how this process, or how aggregation more generally, relates to cellular dysfunction. Although IB co-sequestration of other cellular components has been postulated as a mode of toxicity in HD (7Steffan J.S. Kazantsev A. Spasic-Boskovic O. Greenwald M. Zhu Y.Z. Gohler H. Wanker E.E.

Science. 2001; 291: 2423-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar), more recent evidence suggests that IBs are not themselves toxic but are an active response by cells to sequester more toxic soluble forms (3Arrasate M. Mitra S. Schweitzer E.S. Segal M.R. Finkbeiner S. Nature. 2004; 431: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar).Although it is now well established that SDS insolubility of mutant Htt loosely correlates to inclusions, there is a dearth of knowledge about the kinetics of aggregation of native Htt complexes expressed directly in the cellular environment (9Andreas W. Corinna K. Ben W. Kirupa S. Miriam B. Etienne R. Gillian P.B. Paolo P. J. Neurochem. 2008; 104: 846-858PubMed Google Scholar). Knowledge of this process is fundamentally important to understanding the earliest molecular steps of pathogenesis and for determining how the cellular machinery engages with the mutant forms of Htt. Several studies examining mutant Htt in cellular contexts have unequivocally identified the presence of oligomers in the range of 5–80 nm (10Mukai H. Isagawa T. Goyama E. Tanaka S. Bence N.F.

Woodman B. Finkbeiner S. Paganetti P. Muchowski P.J. Wilson S. Bates G.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2010; 19: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Other work has shown that SDS-insoluble oligomers accumulate in cell culture and transgenic mouse models of HD prior to visible inclusions (9Andreas W. Corinna K. Ben W. Kirupa S. Miriam B. Etienne R. Gillian P.B. Paolo P. J. Neurochem. 2008; 104: 846-858PubMed Google Scholar). However, insight into the full heterogeneity, quantity, and flux of the soluble forms of Htt under non-denaturing conditions has been hampered by a lack of high resolution and unbiased approaches to directly characterize and quantify these forms (13Hatters D.M. IUBMB Life. 2008; 60: 724-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).We sought to investigate the aggregation kinetics of mutant huntingtin expressed in mammalian cells using fluorescence-adapted sedimentation velocity (SV) analysis in the analytical ultracentrifuge. SV analysis is a powerful approach for defining complex molecular size distributions and hydrodynamic properties of soluble proteins, including that of aggregating proteins (14Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3005) Google Scholar, 15MacRaild C.A. Hatters D.M. Lawrence L.J. Howlett G.J. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 2562-2569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, only recently have advances in analytical ultracentrifugation hardware enabled green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged proteins to be uniquely tracked in complex solutions by virtue of the GFP fluorescence (16MacGregor I.K. Anderson A.L. Laue T.M. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 108: 165-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In principle, this allows selective detection of the GFP-tagged protein from all other cellular components and extends the utility of SV analysis from purified proteins into more natural biological complexes, such as those in cell lysates. Recent studies have used this approach to measure the size and heterogeneity of fluorescently labeled purified proteins in the presence of other macromolecules, including serum, yet the approach has yet to be examined on endogenous proteins expressed directly in mammalian cells or on proteins that are known to aggregate intracellularly in neurodegenerative diseases, such as HD (17Kingsbury J.S.

The proteins were examined in non-denaturing buffers and examined with no prepurification steps that may selectively remove molecules, such as large aggregates, from the sample. In comparison, we also investigated the aggregation kinetics of purified mutant Httex1 to investigate how the cellular machinery and environment mediates aggregate size and flux. We extended our analysis to probe how the cognate heat shock protein 70 chaperone, Hsc70, which has been implicated in mediating Httex1 toxicity and aggregation, binds to Httex1 and influences the heterogeneity of the intracellular pools of Httex1 when co-expressed with Httex1 in neuroblastoma cells (23Jana N.R.

https://openalex.org/W1978019082,"Understanding the chemical and thermal evolution of Earth requires knowledge of transport properties of silicate melts at high pressure and high temperature. Here, first-principles molecular dynamics simulations show that the viscosity of MgSiO3 liquid varies by two orders of magnitude over the mantle pressure regime. Addition of water systematically lowers the viscosity, consistent with enhanced structural depolymerization. The combined effects of pressure and temperature along model geotherms lead to a 10-fold increase in viscosity with depth from the surface to the base of the mantle. Based on these calculations, efficient heat flux from a deep magma ocean may have exceeded the incoming solar flux early in Earth's history."

The hsaAB cholesterol catabolic genes have been predicted to encode the oxygenase and reductase, respectively, of a flavin-dependent mono-oxygenase that hydroxylates 3-hydroxy-9,10-seconandrost-1,3,5(10)-triene-9,17-dione (3-HSA) to a catechol. An hsaA deletion mutant of RHA1 did not grow on cholesterol but transformed the latter to 3-HSA and related metabolites in which each of the two keto groups was reduced: 3,9-dihydroxy-9,10-seconandrost-1,3,5(10)-triene-17-one (3,9-DHSA) and 3,17-dihydroxy-9,10-seconandrost-1,3,5(10)-triene-9-one (3,17-DHSA). Purified 3-hydroxy-9,10-seconandrost-1,3,5(10)-triene-9,17-dione 4-hydroxylase (HsaAB) from Mtb had higher specificity for 3-HSA than for 3,17-DHSA (apparent kcat/Km = 1000 ± 100 m−1 s−1 versus 700 ± 100 m−1 s−1). However, 3,9-DHSA was a poorer substrate than 3-hydroxybiphenyl (apparent kcat/Km = 80 ± 40 m−1 s−1). In the presence of 3-HSA the Kmapp for O2 was 100 ± 10 μm. The crystal structure of HsaA to 2.5-Å resolution revealed that the enzyme has the same fold, flavin-binding site, and catalytic residues as p-hydroxyphenyl acetate hydroxylase. However, HsaA has a much larger phenol-binding site, consistent with the enzyme's substrate specificity. In addition, a second crystal form of HsaA revealed that a C-terminal flap (Val367–Val394) could adopt two conformations differing by a rigid body rotation of 25° around Arg366. This rotation appears to gate the likely flavin entrance to the active site. In docking studies with 3-HSA and flavin, the closed conformation provided a rationale for the enzyme's substrate specificity. Overall, the structural and functional data establish the physiological role of HsaAB and provide a basis to further investigate an important class of monooxygenases as well as the bacterial catabolism of steroids.

https://openalex.org/W2116141391,"Diabetes is characterized by hyperglycemia due partly to increased hepatic glucose production. The hypothalamus regulates hepatic glucose production in rodents. However, it is currently unknown whether other regions of the brain are sufficient in glucose production regulation. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is composed of NR1 and NR2 subunits, which are activated by co-agonist glycine and glutamate or aspartate, respectively. Here we report that direct administration of either co-agonist glycine or NMDA into the dorsal vagal complex (DVC), targeting the nucleus of the solitary tract, lowered glucose production in vivo. Direct infusion of the NMDA receptor blocker MK-801 into the DVC negated the metabolic effect of glycine. To evaluate whether NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor mediates the effect of glycine, NR1 in the DVC was inhibited by DVC NR1 antagonist 7-chlorokynurenic acid or DVC shRNA-NR1. Pharmacological and molecular inhibition of DVC NR1 negated the metabolic effect of glycine. To evaluate whether the NMDA receptors mediate the effects of NR2 agonist NMDA, DVC NMDA receptors were inhibited by antagonist D-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (D-APV). DVC D-APV fully negated the ability of DVC NMDA to lower glucose production. Finally, hepatic vagotomy negated the DVC glycine ability to lower glucose production. These findings demonstrate that activation of NR1 and NR2 subunits of the NMDA receptors in the DVC is sufficient to trigger a brain-liver axis to lower glucose production, and suggest that DVC NMDA receptors serve as a therapeutic target for diabetes and obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2086945211,"In nanoscale metal wires, electrical current can cause structural changes through electromigration, in which the momentum of electrons biases atomic motion, but the microscopic details are complex. Using in situ scanning tunneling microscopy, we examined the effects of thermally excited defects on the current-biased displacement of monatomic islands of radius 2 to 50 nanometers on single-crystal Ag(111). The islands move opposite to the current direction, with velocity varying inversely with radius. The force is thus in the same direction as electron flow and acts on atomic defect sites at the island edge. The unexpectedly large force on the boundary atoms can be decreased by over a factor of 10 by adding a mildly electron-withdrawing adsorbate, C60, which also modifies the step geometry. The low coordination of the identified scattering sites is the likely origin of the large force."

Jones, director of the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia, of personal wrongdoing in his conduct and management of research. Climate science fared less well. The Science and Technology Committee concluded in its report that the focus on a single individual had been misplaced: “we consider that Professor Jones's actions were in line with common practice in the climate science community” ( 1 ). Those practices included routine refusals to share raw data and computer codes.

https://openalex.org/W1995227798,"Human topoisomerase IIIalpha is a type IA DNA topoisomerase that functions with BLM and RMI1 to resolve DNA replication and recombination intermediates. BLM, human topoisomerase IIIalpha, and RMI1 catalyze the dissolution of double Holliday junctions into noncrossover products via a strand-passage mechanism. We generated single-stranded catenanes that resemble the proposed dissolution intermediate recognized by human topoisomerase IIIalpha. We demonstrate that human topoisomerase IIIalpha is a single-stranded DNA decatenase that is specifically stimulated by the BLM-RMI1 pair. In addition, RMI1 interacts with human topoisomerase IIIalpha, and the interaction is required for the stimulatory effect of RMI1 on decatenase activity. Our data provide direct evidence that human topoisomerase IIIalpha functions as a decatenase with the assistance of BLM and RMI1 to facilitate the processing of homologous recombination intermediates without crossing over as a mechanism to preserve genome integrity."
https://openalex.org/W1991708379,"Hypoxia-induced gene expression is a critical determinant of neuron survival after stroke. Understanding the cell autonomous genetic program controlling adaptive and pathological transcription could have important therapeutic implications. To identify the factors that modulate delayed neuronal apoptosis after hypoxic injury, we developed an in vitro culture model that recapitulates these divergent responses and characterized the sequence of gene expression changes using microarrays. Hypoxia induced a disproportionate number of bZIP transcription factors and related targets involved in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Although the temporal and spatial aspects of ATF4 expression correlated with neuron loss, our results did not support the anticipated pathological role for delayed CHOP expression. Rather, CHOP deletion enhanced neuronal susceptibility to both hypoxic and thapsigargin-mediated injury and attenuated brain-derived neurotrophic factor-induced neuroprotection. Also, enforced expression of CHOP prior to the onset of hypoxia protected wild-type cultures against subsequent injury. Collectively, these findings indicate CHOP serves a more complex role in the neuronal response to hypoxic stress with involvement in both ischemic preconditioning and delayed neuroprotection.

Although neuronal necrosis remains an important target for stroke therapeutics, delayed apoptosis and other genetically based cell death-signaling programs figure prominently in several forms of this disease (1Bredesen D.E. Stroke. 2007; 38: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast to the rapid time-course characteristic of neuronal necrosis, programmed cell death, triggered under conditions of both transient focal and global ischemia, exhibits delayed kinetics making it a tractable drug target (2Kirino T. Tamura A. Sano K. Acta Neuropathol. 1984; 64: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 3Du C. Hu R. Csernansky C.A. Hsu C.Y. Choi D.W. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1996; 16: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). In humans, magnetic resonance imaging data has revealed that cell death in the ischemic penumbra and other vulnerable regions continues long after the initial insult (4Konaka K. Miyashita K. Naritomi H. J. Stroke Cerebrovasc. Dis. 2007; 16: 82-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Data indicating that macromolecular synthesis inhibitors are protective in such paradigms support a pathological role for de novo gene expression (5Shigeno T. Yamasaki Y. Kato G. Kusaka K. Mima T.

Neurol. 1994; 36: 864-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, although stroke studies performed using genetically manipulated mice have identified a range of putative therapeutic targets involved in delayed cell death (7Krajewski S. Mai J.K. Krajewska M. Sikorska M. Mossakowski M.J. Reed J.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6364-6376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our understanding regarding the proximate transcriptional responses driving adaptive and pathological gene expression and the factors that determine the balance between these opposing programs remains incomplete. In contrast to the extensive pattern of necrotic cell death induced after stroke, even relatively mild ischemia can exert changes in brain function ranging from reversible changes in synaptic function to selective neuron loss (8Dave K.R. Raval A.P. Prado R. Katz L.M. Sick T.J. Ginsberg M.D. Busto R. Pérez-Pinzon M.A. Brain Res. 2004; 1024: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Particularly sensitive brain structures include CA1 hippocampal neurons, pyramidal neurons in layers III and V of the cortex, and reticular neurons within the thalamus (9Teschendorf P. Padosch S.A.

Blood Flow Metab. 1993; 13: 558-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, this pattern of injury correlates with deficits in memory, arousal, and coordination observed after cardiac arrest (11Khot S. Tirschwell D.L. Semin. Neurol. 2006; 26: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The fact that selective neuron vulnerability can also be recapitulated in vitro indicates that this death program may be cell autonomous. A popular explanation regarding the molecular basis for this response involves differences in the relative stoichiometry of the wide variety of glutamate receptors, calcium-binding proteins, and Bcl-2-related proteins expressed in the brain (12Kirino T. Neuropathology. 2000; 20: S95-S97Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). It is also clear that intrinsic differences in balance between survival and cell death transcripts and their gene products induced during the peri-ischemic period play a role. However, even in particularly ischemia-sensitive cell populations, de novo transcription can also promote ischemic tolerance through the regulated expression of neuroprotective factors, including erythropoietin and vascular endothelial growth factor (13Gidday J.M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 437-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). In the current study we used expression microarrays to study the genetic mechanisms regulating this transition from adaptive to pathological transition in hypoxic dissociated neuronal cultures. In addition to characterizing the temporal sequence of hypoxia-induced transcriptional responses, we discovered that, in contrast to ATF4, native expression of the related bZIP heterodimeric factor CHOP-10 was not predictive of in vitro neuron loss as expected from prior published observations. In fact, enforced expression of CHOP protected neurons against hypoxic injury. In addition to being potently induced by the neurotrophin BDNF, 2The abbreviations used are: BDNFbrain-derived neurotrophic factorDIVdays in vitroPBSphosphate-buffered salinePARPpoly(ADP-ribose) polymerasecPARPcleavage of PARPcCasp3cleavage of caspase-3HSVherpes simplex virusGFPgreen fluorescent proteinActDactinomycin DCHXcycloheximideERendoplasmic reticulumTgthapsigarginWTwild typeKOknock-outshRNAshort hairpin RNACtrlcontrol.

Glutamic acid was purchased from RBI, Inc. (Natick, MA). Cell culture grade 0.25% trypsin-EDTA, Neurobasal® media and B27 (antioxidant-plus) supplement were purchased from Invitrogen. BDNF was obtained from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ). HEK293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and passaged in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Culture surfaces were pretreated overnight with filter sterilized polyethyleneimine diluted 1:500 in sodium borate buffer (150 mm, pH 8.0) and washed three times with sterile ddH20 before use. All protocols were approved by the University of Rochester committee on animal resources, and complied with relevant federal guidelines. B6.129S-Ddit3tm1Dron/J chop-10 knock-out mice backcrossed to the c57BL/6J background were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Cortical neuronal cultures were established from timed pregnant wild-type and chop−/− E15.5 mice using the Neurobasal/B27 media formulation. Briefly, corticies were dissected free of meninges, transferred to chilled Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline; Ca2+/Mg2+-free), and incubated in 0.25% trypsin (1 ml/hemisphere) for 15 min at room temperature. Trypsin was removed by rinsing three times with minimal essential medium, and the tissue was triturated in plating media (Neurobasal media, 1× B27 supplement, 25 mm glutamic acid, 100 mm glutamate) and seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells on 12-mm coverslips (Fischer Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) or in 60-mm tissue culture plates (Corning Costar, Corning, NY) at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/well. Cultures maintained under ambient oxygen conditions were exposed to hypoxia (0.3–0.5% O2) in Neurobasal/B27 media (25 mm glucose) using a triple gas cell culture incubator (CB150, Binder, Tuttlingen, German). Samples were not reperfused prior to analysis unless indicated. To assess nuclear morphology cultures were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4) for 15 min at room temperature, counterstained with 5 μm Hoechst 33342, and mounted in Mowiol. Nuclear pyknosis was assessed in triplicate wells by counting five to six non-overlapping fields per coverslip. Data are presented as the % pyknosis (average ± S.D.). 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H- tetrazolium (MTS) assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI) in 96-well dishes with primary tissue plated at a density of 4 × 104 cells per well in a volume of 100 μl. Following either drug or hypoxia exposure, plates were returned to normoxic conditions and treated with the MTS reagent, incubated for 2 h, and analyzed on a Spectramax M5e absorbance plate reader at 492 nm (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Data represent viability relative to untreated controls. Total RNA from cortical cultures was harvested using the RNeasy midi kit (Qiagen) from paired 60-mm dishes. Total RNA yield (average ± S.D.) was analyzed (0 h, 28.2 ± 4.5 mg; 3 h, 29.6 ± 5.7 mg; 12 h, 20.3 ± 2.9 mg; and 18 h, 25.0 ± 4.2 mg), and RNA integrity was confirmed by gel electrophoresis. For cDNA synthesis reactions, 10 μg of total RNA from each sample was modified at the 3′-end to contain an initiation site for T7 RNA polymerase. In vitro transcription with biotinylated UTP and CTP was carried out using 1 μg of the cDNA product. Twenty micrograms of full-length cRNA was fragmented in 200 mm Tris-acetate (pH 8.1), 500 mm KOAc, and 150 mm MgOAc at 94 °C for 35 min and analyzed by gel electrophoresis to confirm the appropriate size distribution prior to hybridization. Hybridization was performed using the Affymetrix Mu11A & B oligonucleotide arrays, and staining and washing of all arrays were performed using the Affymetrix fluidics module according to the manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Arrays were stained with the florescent conjugate streptavidin phycoerythrin (SAPE, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and analyzed with the GeneArrayTM scanning each array after (S2) SAPE antibody amplification. The raw images from the S2 scans were scaled to the average chip intensity to correct for differences in hybridization. dCHIP was used to analyze the data with tabulation of the data sets performed in Excel. The data sets were combined and culled of targets with detection p values of <0.05. This value is based on the difference between signals obtained from probe match and probe mismatch spotted arrays and is a statistical indicator of the likelihood that a gene is expressed in a given sample. The absolute difference values for each of three replicates, from the 0-, 3-, 12-, and 18-h time points were used to generate average difference values ± S.D. Probe identity was determined using the Netaffx engine (available on-line). Annotation was performed online via Mouse Genome Informatics (available on-line). Array expression data were validated by quantitative PCR using an ABI-7700 thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) from total RNA harvested from hypoxic cultures and transcribed using the superscript III cDNA synthesis kit according to the manufacturer's instruction (Stratagene). Primer probe pairs were selected using the software program PrimerExpress® for the following targets: egr-1 (Fwd 5′-TGCCCTGTCGAGTCCTGC- 3′, Rev 5′-GGATATGGCGGGTAAGCTCA-3′, Probe 5′-ATCGCCGCTTTTCTCGCTCGG-3′), vegf (Fwd 5′-GACTCGGAATCTCTTGGTGAGTG-3′, Rev 5′-AGGAAGGTGAAGCCCGGA-3′, Probe 5′-TGGGCAGAGCGCCACCAGC-3′), glut-1 (Fwd 5′-TCCTGTTGCCCTTCTGCC-3′, Rev 5′-GGTTCTCCTCGTTACGATTGATG-3′, Probe 5′-CGAGAGCCCCCGCTTCCTGC-3′), hkII (Fwd 5′-GACTCGGAATCTCTTGGTGAGTG-3′, Rev 5′-AGGAAGGTGAAGCCCGGA-3′, Probe 5′-TGGGCAGAGCGCCACCAGC-3′), atf5 (Fwd 5′- CCTCCATTCCACTTTCCT-3′, Rev 5′-AGAAACTGACTCTGCCAAATAG-3′, Probe 5′-ATCCAGTCCATCTCTAGGCTTCCC-3′), and chop-10 (Fwd 5′-GGGACTGAGGGTAGAC-3′, Rev 5′-ACATGGACAGTAATAAACAATG-3′, Probe 5′-AGAGGGCTCGGCTTGCACATA-3′). FAM/TAMRA primer-probe sets were obtained from Synthegen (Houston, TX). Reactions were performed using AmpliTaq Gold master mix under the following thermal cycler conditions (1 cycle × 55 °C/2 min, 1 cycle × 95 °C/10 min, 40 cycles × 95 °C/15 s then 60 °C/1 min). Reactions lacking reverse transcriptase were also run to exclude genomic DNA contamination and the -fold induction calculations for each gene were made using the comparative 2−ΔΔCT method (14Schmittgen T.D. Livak K.J. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (17798) Google Scholar). Values represent the average ± S.D. across replicates (n = 6). Whole cell lysates were harvested from 2.5 × 106 neurons cultured in 60-mm dishes by first rinsing once with ice-cold PBS and then harvesting after incubation on ice for 10 min with RIPA buffer (Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate (150 mm NaCl), 1 mm EDTA, 1× protease inhibitor mixture). Samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C in a bench top centrifuge, and supernatants were stored at −70 °C. Aliquots of equal volume were resolved by SDS-PAGE (8–15%), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and blocked for 90 min at room temperature in wash buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.9% NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk. Primary antibodies were added with constant agitation overnight at 4 °C, blots were rinsed thee times in wash buffer, and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h (diluted 1:2000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), washed, and detected by ECL (Renaissance, Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The following antibodies were used: NeuN (Chemicon, Temecula, CA); cleaved caspase-3 and PARP, eIF2α, and p-eIF2αser51 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA); ATF4 (AVIVA, San Diego, CA); Tribbles 3 (A-20 and T-15) and CHOP-10 (B-3 and F-168) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Actin (A4700) was from Sigma-Aldrich. Cells were rinsed with chilled PBS and fixed for 30 min at 4 °C with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Cells were then rinsed 2× with PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and treated for 30 min/4 °C in blocking solution (0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4.5% non-fat dry milk, 0.1% Triton X-100). Coverslips were inverted on 70-μl droplets of primary antibody diluted 1:100 in Triton/blotto on Parafilm for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were rinsed three times with blotto (0.05% Triton X-100) and incubated with conjugated secondary antibodies 1 h at room temperature (1:2000, Alexa Dyes, Invitrogen). Coverslips were rinsed three times in PBS (0.05% Triton X-100) and mounted in Mowiol. Images were acquired using a Zeiss Z1 Observer, Plan-Neofluor objectives and the charge-coupled device Orca II camera (Hamamatsu, Japan). The herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) amplicon plasmid CMVeGFPHSVprPuc expressing the enhanced GFP protein was constructed as follows. The amplicon vector HSVprPuc was linearized with AccI and ligated with a CMVeGFP fragment generated by PCR from the vector pC2eGFP (Clontech, Inc., Mountain View, CA). The cDNA for Luciferase was transferred from the pGL3Luc in a similar fashion (Promega). cDNAs for CHOP-10 and the leucine zipper-deficient mutant LZ− were generated by reverse transcription-PCR as described (Fwd 5′-GCTCTAGATGGCAGCTGAGTCCCTG-3′, Rev 5′-GGGGTACCTCATGCTTGGTGCA GGCT-3′, and LZ− Rev 5′-CCGGTACCTATAGCTGTGCCACTTTCCG-3′). Cloned cDNAs were sequence-confirmed and transferred to CMVeGFPHSVprPuc using XbaI and KpnI sites contained within the primer sequences (underlined). HSV amplicon vectors were generated as described (15Geschwind M.D. Lu B. Federoff H.J. Methods Neurosci. 1994; 21: 462-482Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). GFP titers were determined on NIH3T3 cells and ranged between 1 and 3 × 10−8 gfu/ml with amplicon to helper ratios of 1:1. Neuronal cultures were transduced at a multiplicity of infection of 0.8 12 h prior to hypoxic exposure to allow for transgene expression. The pPRIME miR-based lentiviral shRNA system has been described elsewhere (16Stegmeier F. Hu G. Rickles R.J. Hannon G.J. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13212-13217Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). 97-mer antisense oligonucleotides were designed against mouse CHOP using RNAi Central (available on-line) and cloned into pPRIME-CMV-GFP. Plasmid identities were confirmed by sequencing and packaged into infectious particles using the HEK293TN line (System Biosciences, Mountain View, CA) and packaging vectors pCMV-VSVG and pCMVΔR8.2ΔVpr kindly provided by Dr. Planelles (University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT). Stocks were concentrated by polyethylene glycol centrifugation (System Biosciences) and titered on DIV7 mouse cortical neuronal cultures. The vector pPRIME-CMV-GFP-FF3 containing an insert sequence complimentary to firefly luciferase was used as a vehicle control in the experiments. Significance testing was performed using either Student's t testing or analysis of variance with Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test for post-hoc analyses. Results were considered significant for p values < 0.05. To define the temporal relationship between hypoxia-induced gene expression and neuronal death, we characterized the kinetics of nuclear condensation in DIV7 cortical neuronal cultures exposed to continuous hypoxia (0.5% O2). Neuron loss began within 6 h of exposure (t = 0 versus t = 6 h; 26 ± 1% versus 35 ± 3%, p < 0.05) increasing throughout the experimental period (supplemental Fig. S1A; 24 h, 52 ± 1%, p < 0.001). To investigate the maturation kinetics of this response, we also compared death profiles between cultures fixed immediately after the hypoxic period against sister cultures returned to normoxia (i.e. reperfused) for 24 h prior to fixation and analysis (supplemental Fig. S1B). Minor differences in levels of pyknosis were observed (hypoxia alone, light bars 23.3 ± 2.6% versus hypoxia plus reperfusion, black bars, 29.9 ± 4.3%; p < 0.15). Importantly, paired cultures subjected to trypan blue staining at 24 h show only low levels of uptake (data not shown) indicating that pyknosis in this setting is a surrogate marker for programmed cell death and not cellular necrosis. Delayed ischemic preconditioning produces potent neuroprotective effects in a variety of disease models and requires de novo gene expression (13Gidday J.M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 437-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Reasoning that pro-survival and pro-apoptotic transcriptional responses are activated sequentially, we tested whether the inhibition of gene expression would improve survival by selecting against pathological gene expression. Using a delayed treatment paradigm we treated hypoxic cultures with either the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D (ActD) or the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) before, or at various times after the onset of hypoxia (Fig. 1A). Although ActD pretreatment (1 μg/ml) was protective (hypoxia plus ActD T0Hr 31.5 ± 4.9% versus hypoxia alone 55.6 ± 2.9%, p < 0.05), delayed addition enhanced survival to a greater degree (hypoxia plus ActD T3Hr 23.3 ± 1.6 versus hypoxia 55.5 ± 4.8%, p < 0.05). Similarly, although CHX pre-treatment (200 nm) was neuroprotective (hypoxia plus CHX T0Hr, 60 ± 1% versus hypoxia alone 66 ± 4%, p < 0.05), the effect was enhanced if drug was added several hours after hypoxic exposure (hypoxia plus CHX T9Hr, 47 ± 1%, p < 0.01). However, we found that protection was lost if drug delivery was delayed beyond 9 (ActD) to 12 (CXH) h. Neither drug was toxic to control cultures (Fig. 1, B and C, open bars). Thus, continuous euglycemic hypoxia elicits temporally distinct adaptive (<9 h) and pathological (>9 h) phases of gene expression in dissociated neuronal cultures. To identify the hypoxia-induced factors involved in these responses, we analyzed mRNA expression in cultures exposed to brief (3 h), intermediate (12 h), and extended (18 h) hypoxia using expression microarrays. Because inhibition of gene expression with ActD and CHX implicated induced expression as a modulating influence in the model, we restricted our analyses to genes whose expression were increased ≥ 1.9-fold. Gene hits were annotated and grouped according to their biological function and temporal pattern of expression (Table 1). These groups were associated with transcription (21.5%), stress and oxidative responses (18.1%), carbohydrate metabolism (11.4%), and development (12.5%) consistent with the embryonic origin of the tissue used in the culture model (supplemental Fig. S2). Eight percent of genes were associated with apoptotic signaling, including ddit2 (gadd45γ), ddit3 (chop-10), ddit4 (rtp801), c/EBP-β, prkca, pten, and app (Table 1, bold). Twenty-five percent of transcripts were activated after 3-h exposure and coded for immediate early genes (egr-1, egr-2, c-Jun, ddit2, ddit4, dusp1, ier2, and ier3) or for genes regulated by the hypoxia inducible factor HIF-1α (glut-1, vegf, hmox, adm, hkII, and p4ha1). A second class of transcripts exhibited induction after prolonged exposure (18 h, 27.6%), however, most were activated by 12 h (50.6%) around the time cultured neurons activated apoptotic

https://openalex.org/W2077044630,"Androgen receptor (AR)-mediated gene regulation involves interactions with coregulatory proteins that include the melanoma antigen gene protein-A11 (MAGE-11). To understand the functional significance of sequence similarity between MAGE-11 and the adenovirus early protein E1A, we determined whether MAGE-11 contributes to AR transcriptional activity through an interaction with p300, a potent and ubiquitous transcriptional regulator. Here, we report that MAGE-11 interacts with the NH(2)-terminal region of p300 through the MAGE-11 MXXIF motif (185)MXXIF(189), with transcriptional activity depending on the MAGE-11 F-box and MAPK phosphorylation. The MAGE-11- and p300-dependent increase in AR transactivation required the NH(2)-terminal regions of AR and p300, p300 acetyltransferase activity, and the AR FXXLF motif (23)FQNLF(27) interaction with MAGE-11. MAGE-11 linked AR to p300 and the p160 coactivator, transcriptional intermediary protein 2 (TIF2). The p300 NH(2)-terminal FXXLF motif (33)FGSLF(37) was required for transcriptional activation by TIF2. Increased expression of p300 decreased the ubiquitinylation of MAGE-11 and transiently increased endogenous MAGE-11 levels. Autoacetylation of p300 and decreased acetylation of TIF2 were evident in the MAGE-11, p300, and TIF2 complex. The studies suggest that MAGE-11 links NH(2)-terminal domains of AR and p300 to promote transcriptional synergy through a cadre of FXXLF-related interacting motifs."
https://openalex.org/W2137102515,"Leukotrienes, the lipid inflammatory products derived from arachidonic acid, are involved in the pathogenesis of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and reactive airway disease in sickle cell disease. Placenta growth factor (PlGF), elaborated from erythroid cells, increased the mRNA expression of 5-lipoxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells. PlGF-induced both promoter activity and mRNA expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), which was abrogated by early growth response-1 (EGR-1) small interfering RNA. PlGF showed a temporal reciprocal relationship in the mRNA levels of EGR-1 and NAB2, the latter a repressor of Egr-1. Moreover, Nab2, but not mutant Nab2, significantly reduced promoter activity and mRNA expression of HIF-1alpha and also reduced expression of the HIF-1alpha target gene FLAP. Furthermore, overexpression of Egr-1 led to increased promoter activities for both HIF-1alpha and FLAP in the absence of PlGF. Additionally, the Egr-1-mediated induction of HIF-1alpha and FLAP promoters was reduced to basal levels by EGR-1 small interfering RNA. The binding of Egr-1 to HIF-1alpha promoter was corroborated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, which showed increased Egr-1 binding to the HIF-1alpha promoter in response to PlGF stimulation. These studies provide a novel mechanism for PlGF-mediated regulation of HIF-1alpha via Egr-1, which results in increased FLAP expression. This study provides a new therapeutic target, namely Egr-1, for attenuation of elevated leukotriene levels in patients with sickle cell disease and other inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2119876194,"We identified a novel prostaglandin (PG)-specific organic anion transporter (OAT) in the OAT group of the SLC22 family. The transporter designated OAT-PG from mouse kidney exhibited Na(+)-independent and saturable transport of PGE(2) when expressed in a proximal tubule cell line (S(2)). Unusual for OAT members, OAT-PG showed narrow substrate selectivity and high affinity for a specific subset of PGs, including PGE(2), PGF(2alpha), and PGD(2). Similar to PGE(2) receptor and PGT, a structurally distinct PG transporter, OAT-PG requires for its substrates an alpha-carboxyl group, with a double bond between C13 and C14 as well as a (S)-hydroxyl group at C15. Unlike the PGE(2) receptor, however, the hydroxyl group at C11 in a cyclopentane ring is not essential for OAT-PG substrates. Addition of a hydroxyl group at C19 or C20 impairs the interaction with OAT-PG, whereas an ethyl group at C20 enhances the interaction, suggesting the importance of hydrophobicity around the omega-tail tip forming a ""hydrophobic core"" accompanied by a negative charge, which is essential for substrates of OAT members. OAT-PG-mediated transport is concentrative in nature, although OAT-PG mediates both facilitative and exchange transport. OAT-PG is kidney-specific and localized on the basolateral membrane of proximal tubules where a PG-inactivating enzyme, 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase, is expressed. Because of the fact that 15-keto-PGE(2), the metabolite of PGE(2) produced by 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase, is not a substrate of OAT-PG, the transport-metabolism coupling would make unidirectional PGE(2) transport more efficient. By removing extracellular PGE(2), OAT-PG is proposed to be involved in the local PGE(2) clearance and metabolism for the inactivation of PG signals in the kidney cortex."

We hypothesized that in TALs, Ang II stimulates O₂. via AT₁and PKC α-dependent NADPH oxidase activation.In rat TALs, 1 nM Ang II stimulated O₂. from 0.760.17 to 1.97 0.21 nmol/min/mg (p < 0.001). An AT₁antagonist blocked the stimulatory effect of Ang II on O₂. (0.87 0.25 nmol/min/mg; p < 0.006), whereas an AT₂ antagonist had no effect (2.16 0.133 nmol/min/mg; p < 0.05 versus vehicle). Apocynin, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, blocked Ang II-stimulated O₂by 90% (p <0.01). Ang II failed to stimulate O₂. in TALs from p47(phox) -/- mice (p < 0.02). Monitored by fluorescence resonance energy transfer, Ang II increased PKC activity from 0.02 0.03 to 0.13 0.02 arbitrary units (p < 0.03). A general PKC inhibitor, GF109203X, blocked the effect of Ang II on O₂(1.47 +/- .21 versus 2.72 +/- .47 nmol/min/mg with Ang II alone; p < 0.03). A PKCα- and ß-selective inhibitor, Gö6976, also blocked the stimulatory effect of Ang II on O₂. (0.59 +/- 0.15 versus 2.05 +/- 0.28 nmol/min/mg with Ang II alone; p < 0.001). To distinguish between PKC α and PKC ß, we used tubules expressing dominant-negative PKC α or -ß. In control TALs, Ang II stimulated O2. by 2.17 0.44 nmol/min/mg (p < 0.011). In tubules expressing dominant-negative PKC α, Ang II failed to stimulate O2. (change: -0.30 +/- 0.27 nmol/min/mg). In tubules expressing dominant-negative PKC ß1, Ang II stimulated O2. by 2.080.69 nmol/min/mg (p < 0.002).

Murine B56γ1 was shown to associate and colocalize with the focal adhesion regulatory protein paxillin at focal adhesions (12Ito A. Kataoka T.R. Watanabe M. Nishiyama K. Mazaki Y. Sabe H. Kitamura Y.

Human B56α, B56β, and B56ϵ were found to localize mainly to the cytoplasm, but B56γ1, B56γ3, and B56δ were concentrated in the nucleus (13McCright B. Rivers A.M. Audlin S. Virshup D.M. J. Biol.

In addition, B56γ1 was shown to be concentrated in the intranuclear structure known as nuclear speckles in rat cardiomyocytes (15Gigena M.S. Ito A. Nojima H. Rogers T.B. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ.

The dynamic localization patterns of the B regulatory subunits throughout the cell cycle have been intensely studied in yeast. In fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the intracellular distribution of the B′ subunit Par1p was found to be primarily cytoplasmic but concentrated at the cell center at late stages of mitosis (18Jiang W. Hallberg R.L. Genetics. 2000; 154: 1025-1038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, another B′ subunit Par2p showed localization at cell ends during interphase and was found to form a medial ring in cells that are undergoing septation and cytokinesis (18Jiang W. Hallberg R.L. Genetics. 2000; 154: 1025-1038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the B regulatory subunits, CDC55 (B type) and RTS1 (B′ type), displayed dynamic and distinct patterns of subcellular localization at the nucleus, bud tip, kinetochore, and bud neck throughout the mitotic cell cycle and to dictate sites of PP2A accumulation (19Gentry M.S. Hallberg R.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3477-3492Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the mammalian B regulatory subunits exhibit dynamic distribution patterns throughout the cell cycle and whether the dynamics of subcellular localization of B regulatory subunits coincide with the localization of PP2A, we investigated the subcellular localization of the human B56γ3 subunit throughout the cell cycle. B56γ3, the largest of the B56γ splice variants, displays predominantly nuclear localization when transiently expressed (13McCright B. Rivers A.M. Audlin S. Virshup D.M. J. Biol.

Biol. 2008; 28: 448-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). By cell cycle synchronization experiments, we demonstrate that intracellular localization of B56γ3 changes throughout the cell cycle and that, in particular, B56γ3 is markedly increased in the nucleus at the G1-S boundary and during S phase. Enrichment of B56γ3 in the nucleus is concomitant with increased distribution of the PP2A A and C subunits and PP2A activity in the nucleus. Analyses for the function of B56γ3 on cell cycle indicate a role of B56γ3 in regulating the p27KIP1 protein levels in the G1 to S phase transition of the cell cycle, and B56γ3 overexpression delayed transition from G1 to S phase. Together, our data provide further evidence supporting the notion that diverse B regulatory subunits control the subcellular localization of PP2A holoenzymes and PP2A activity in a highly dynamic manner.

All secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid was from Alexis Biochemicals. Protease inhibitors, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, and leupeptin, and propidium iodide (PI) were from Sigma. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride was from Molecular Probes. Lipofectamine 2000 was from Invitrogen. The rabbit anti-B56γ polyclonal antibody (M880) was kindly provided by Dr. Marc Mumby (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). The pBMN-IRES-EGFP-FLAG-p27 was a gift from Dr. Carlos Arteaga (Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN). NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine serum (BS). HeLa cells were cultured in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. In serum starvation experiments, NIH3T3 cells were grown in medium containing 0.5% BS for 72 h and changed medium every day then were stimulated with 10% BS-containing medium. In proliferation assays, cells were seeded onto 24-well plates, and cell numbers were directly counted. Viability was measured by trypan blue exclusion. A polyclonal pool of cells stably expressing HA-tagged B56γ3 or vector only were created by retroviral infection and subsequent drug selection (usually more than 80% survival) as previously described (23Kuo Y.C. Huang K.Y. Yang C.H. Yang Y.S. Lee W.Y. Chiang C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1882-1892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). A pool of cells stably expressing B56γ3-specific shRNA, shRNA targeting both B56γ2 and B56γ3, or shLuc was established with infection and subsequently drug selection using retroviruses made from co-transfection of lentiviral-based expression vector pLKO.1-puro harboring a specific shRNA-encoding sequence, packaging plasmid pCMV-R8.91, and pVSV-G into 293T cells. The retroviral constructs pLKO.1-puro harboring B56γ3-specific shRNA (TRCN0000002495), shRNA for B56γ2 and B56γ3 (TRCN0000002497), or shLuc (TRCN00000072244) were obtained from the National RNAi Core Facility (Institute of Molecular Biology/Genomic Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taiwan). Transient transfection experiments were carried out by co-transfecting NIH3T3 cells with pcDNA3.1–4HAB56γ3 and pBMN-IRES-EGFP-FLAG-p27 or empty vector by Lipofectamine 2000 according to recommended standard procedures. The G1 phase cells were harvested at 6 h (NIH3T3) and 9 h (HeLa) after releasing into the regular medium after nocodazole (200 ng/ml) treatment for 12 h. The cells synchronized at the G1/S border were obtained using double thymidine block (24Harper J.V. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 296: 157-166PubMed Google Scholar), and cells synchronized in mid-S phase were harvested at 3 h after released in the regular medium after double thymidine block treatment. Cells synchronized in G2/M phase were collected after 12 h of treatment with 200 ng/ml nocodazole. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) once, subsequently fixed in 1 ml 75% ethanol, and incubated on ice at least 30 min. The cells were then subjected to PI staining and flow cytometry analysis for monitoring cell cycle progression. Subcellular fractionation was performed according to the procedures described previously (25Waltregny D. De Leval L. Glénisson W. Ly Tran S. North B.J. Bellahcène A. Weidle U. Verdin E. Castronovo V. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 165: 553-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates for Western blotting or co-immunoprecipitation were prepared in radio immunoprecipitation assay buffer or isotonic immunoprecipitation buffer by protocols described before (26Chiang C.W. Harris G. Ellig C. Masters S.C. Subramanian R. Shenolikar S. Wadzinski B.E. Yang E. Blood. 2001; 97: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). For coimmunoprecipitation experiments of PP2A and p27, cells were treated with 2 mm chemical cross-linker dithiobis[succinimidyl propionate] at room temperature for 30 min before harvesting cell lysates. Immunoprecipitation was then carried out according to protocols described before (26Chiang C.W. Harris G. Ellig C. Masters S.C. Subramanian R. Shenolikar S. Wadzinski B.E. Yang E. Blood. 2001; 97: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole cell lysates were incubated with anti-HA (HA.11, Covance) or anti-FLAG (M2)-Sepharose, and the anti-HA or anti-FLAG immunocomplexes were subsequently precipitated with or without protein A/G-Sepharose. Whole cell lysates, cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts, and immunocomplex-containing-Sepharose were then mixed with equal volumes of 2× SDS sample buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 4% SDS, and 40% β-mercaptoethanol) and were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Immunoblots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence. Results were quantified by densitometry using Alpha Innotech AlphaImager. After various treatments, cells were washed with PBS three times and fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 15 min followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100, PBS for 30 min. Cells were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin, PBS for 1 h, incubated with primary antibody for 1 h (anti-HA, HA.11, 1:1000; anti-B56γ, 1:500; anti-PP2A/A, 6F9, 1:1000; anti-PP2A/C, 1:1000) followed by incubation with the Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody at 1:250 dilution for 1 h. Cells were subsequently stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (5 μm) for 5 min. Cells were visualized by fluorescence microcopy (Olympus, BX51) at 200× magnification or confocal microcopy (Olympus, FV1000) at 400× or 600× magnification. Quantification of fluorescence images for subcellular distribution of immunostained proteins was performed by scoring at least 200 cells on slides by dividing staining patterns as predominantly nuclear (N), homogenously nuclear and cytoplasmic (N≈C), and predominantly cytoplasmic (C). For immunofluorescence staining experiments in synchronized cells, cells were grown on both coverslips and 10-cm dishes. After synchronization treatments, cells on 10-cm dishes were immediately harvested by trypsinization, pelleted by centrifugation, fixed in 75% ethanol, and resuspended in PI buffer (40 μg/ml propidium iodide, 100 μg/ml RNase A in PBS). The DNA content of cells (10,000 cells/sample) was then measured on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). For cell cycle re-entry experiments by serum stimulation, NIH3T3 cells were seeded on 15-cm dishes (7 × 105/dish) in 10% BS-containing medium overnight. Cells were subsequently grown in 0.5% BS-containing medium for 72 h for arrest at G0/G1 and were replenished with 10% BS-containing medium to induce re-entry into cell cycle. For cell cycle re-entry experiments by release from contact inhibition, cells were grown to confluence and were then trypsinized and replated with a low density. Cells were collected at various time points after re-addition of 10% serum or replating, fixed with cold 70% ethanol, and subjected to flow cytometry analysis as described earlier. PP2A activity was measured using a PP2A DuoSet IC kit (R&D Systems) with some modifications. Briefly, whole cell lysates were prepared in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 25 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml leupeptin), and subsequently aliquots (75 μg) of cell lysates, extracts of cytoplasm, or extracts of the nucleus prepared as described earlier were loaded onto 96-well plates coated with a capture antibody specific for the C subunit for immunocapture at 4 °C for 3 h. After washing twice, synthetic phosphopeptide substrates (200 μm) were added for the dephosphorylation reaction catalyzed by PP2A. The level of free phosphate was determined by measuring the absorbance at 620 nm by a dye binding assay using malachite green and molybdic acid. The recombinant His-B56γ3, GST, and GST-p27 proteins were prepared by following the protocols described before (23Kuo Y.C. Huang K.Y. Yang C.H. Yang Y.S. Lee W.Y. Chiang C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1882-1892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) using Escherichia coli BL21 cells harboring the expression construct including pQE30-His(6)-B56γ3-HA, pGEX-4T-1, or pGEX-4T-p27. For analyzing direct interactions of B56γ3 and p27 in vitro, 2 μg of purified recombinant GST or GST-p27 proteins were incubated with 2 μg of purified recombinant His-B56γ3 proteins in pulldown buffer (1× PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100) for 4 h at 4 °C. GST fusion proteins were pulled down by glutathione-Sepharose 4B, washed five times with pulldown buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-B56γ or anti-GST antibody as described earlier. FLAG-tagged p27 was immunoprecipitated from NIH3T3 cells transfected with pBMN-IRES-EGFP-FLAG-p27 48 h after transfection by protocols described before (26Chiang C.W. Harris G. Ellig C. Masters S.C. Subramanian R. Shenolikar S. Wadzinski B.E. Yang E. Blood. 2001; 97: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The PP2A B56γ3 holoenzymes were prepared from NIH3T3 cells stably expressing HA-tagged B56γ3 by immunoprecipitation using anti-HA antibody and precipitated by protein A-Sepharose. The FLAG-tagged p27 or B56γ3 immunocomplexes were then resuspended in the phosphatase assay buffer (20 mm imidazole, 150 mm NaCl, 14.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Aliquots of p27 immunocomplexes were then mixed with various amounts of B56γ3 immunocomplexes and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Dephosphorylation reactions were terminated by adding 4× SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. We first investigated the subcellular localization of B56γ3 in a pool of NIH3T3 cells stably expressing HA-tagged B56γ3 (B56γ3HA) throughout the cell cycle. Immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 1A) showed that B56γ3HA was ubiquitously distributed throughout the entire cell in most NIH3T3 cells in steady-state asynchronous populations. When NIH3T3 cells were synchronized in the G1 phase after several hours after release from treatment with nocodazole, the distribution of B56γ3HA was mostly ubiquitous. When cells were arrested at the border between G1 and S phase by double thymidine block, we found that staining of B56γ3HA was markedly enriched in the nucleus (Fig. 1A). When most cells entered mid-S phase 3 h after release from double thymidine block, staining of B56γ3HA was further enriched in the nucleus (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, B56γ3HA was concentrated at the area surrounding but not overlapping the chromatin in cells arrested in G2/M by nocodazole treatment (Fig. 1A). In contrast, we did not observe a similar cell cycle-specific nuclear accumulation pattern when B55α and B56α were investigated (data not shown). To investigate whether the findings are unique to NIH3T3 cells, we investigated the distribution of B56γ3HA in HeLa cells. The distribution pattern of B56γ3HA in HeLa cells was similar to that of NIH3T3 cells in both asynchronous cells and in synchronized cells (Fig. 1B). However, we observed that there were more HeLa cells exhibiting primarily nuclear and perinuclear staining of B56γ3HA in steady state compared with NIH3T3 cells. In addition, the level of enrichment in nuclear staining of B56γ3HA during progression into S phase was lower than that of NIH3T3 cells, and some cells exhibited staining of B56γ3HA that overlapped with the chromatin (Fig. 1B). To further confirm that our finding of distribution of stably expressed exogenous B56γ3 also applied to the endogenous B56γ3, we studied the distribution of the endogenous B56γ subunits (B56γ2 and B56γ3) in HeLa cells by immunostaining using a polyclonal antibody against an epitope at the C terminus of both human B56γ2 and B56γ3. The overall distribution pattern of the endogenous B56γ subunits in HeLa cells (Fig. 1C) was similar to that of exogenous B56γ3 except for some differences in the level of enrichment in the nucleus. In asynchronous steady-state cells and cells synchronized in G1 phase, the endogenous B56γ subunits were ubiquitously distributed throughout the entire cells. When cells were synchronized at the G1/S border, the endogenous B56γ subunits started to accumulate toward the perinuclear area but to a much lesser extent than exogenous B56γ3 (Fig. 1B). In cells synchronized in S phase, the endogenous B56γ subunits became highly enriched at the perinuclear area and in the nucleus. In cells synchronized in G2/M phase, the endogenous B56γ subunits were distributed at the area surrounding the chromatin or overlapping with the chromatin. Furthermore, during investigation of the subcellular localization of B56γ3HA in cells entering G1 after released from G2/M arrest, we observed dynamic staining patterns of B56γ3HA localization between the cytoplasm and nucleus through the time course (supplemental Fig. 1). Together, these results suggest that the distribution of B56γ3 is controlled in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Given that the regulatory B subunits determine subcellular localization of PP2A holoenzymes and that nuclear distribution of B56γ3HA was markedly increased during entry of S phase (Fig. 1), we examined the distribution of the A and C subunits in steady-state asynchronous cells and in cells progressing into S phase by comparing NIH3T3 cells carrying vector only with cells overexpressing B56γ3HA. We found that staining of the A subunit was primarily cytoplasmic, and overexpression of B56γ3 caused not only an increase in nuclear staining but also a marked increase in filament array staining (Fig. 2A). When cells were synchronized at the G1/S border and in S phase, the nuclear staining of the A subunit was significantly increased in cells overexpressing B56γ3 as compared with the minimal changes found in cells carrying vector only (Fig. 2A). Next, we examined staining of the C subunit and found that B56γ3 overexpression resulted in a significantly enhanced nuclear staining of the C subunit in asynchronous cells (Fig. 2B). We also noticed that more staining of the C subunit was detected in the nucleus than that of the A subunit in control cells (Fig. 2B, left). As cells were synchronized at the G1/S border and in S phase, cells with B56γ3 overexpression still showed more nuclear staining of the C subunit than control cells (Fig. 2B). In parallel, we analyzed the impact of B56γ3 overexpression on distribution of the A and C subunits in HeLa cells (supplemental Fig. 2). Similar to NIH3T3 cells, B56γ3 overexpression resulted in an elevated nuclear staining of the A subunit in asynchronous cells and cells progressing into S phase, whereas an enhanced nuclear staining of the C subunit by B56γ3 overexpression was only observed in cells progressing into S phase as compared with cells carrying vector only (supplemental Fig. 2). These results indicate that overexpression of B56γ3 enhances the nuclear localization of the PP2A A and C subunits. The results of fluorescence microscopy analyses showed an S phase-specific elevation in the nuclear staining of B56γ3HA and increased levels of the nuclear staining of the A and C subunits mediated by overexpression of B56γ3. We further performed subcellular fractionation for cell extracts in conjunction with Western blot analysis to confirm and perform quantitative analyses for the findings. We prepared nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts by fractionating total cell lysates of NIH3T3 cells with vector only or B56γ3HA overexpression and analyzed the expression of A, B56γ3HA, and C subunits by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. As expected in NIH3T3 cells, we found a very significant increase, up to 74%, in levels of nuclear B56γ3HA in cells synchronized in S phase compared with that in steady state (Fig. 3, A, right, and B). Increases in both the endogenous A and C subunits in the nuclear fraction were observed in the control cells as cells entered S phase (Fig. 3, A, left, and C). B56γ3 overexpression further enhanced the increase in the A and C subunits (up to 138 and 74%, respectively) (Fig. 3, A, right, C, and D) in the nuclear fraction as compared with that of vector only cells (up to 31 and 23%, respectively) (Fig. 3, A, left, C, and D) as cells entered S phase. In parallel, we examined the expression levels of the A, B56γ3HA, and C subunits in subcellular fractions of HeLa cells overexpressing B56γ3. Similar to NIH3T3 cells and consistent with results of microscopy analysis, we observed an increase in nuclear B56γ3HA and a modest increase in nuclear A and C subunits mediated by B56γ3 overexpression during progression into S phase (data not shown). Next, we investigated whether endogenous B56γ3 could act similarly to exogenous B56γ3 in the S phase-specific nuclear enrichment and in regulating the nuclear distribution of the A and C subunits when cells progress into S phase. We investigated the role of endogenous B56γ3 in regulating nuclear localization of PP2A in HeLa cells. We fractionated the whole cell extracts from steady-state asynchronous, G1/S-boundary and S phase-synchronized HeLa cells with control shLuc knockdown, specific shB56γ3 knockdown, or both shB56γ2 and shB56γ3 knockdown (Fig. 4). Consistent with the findings with exogenous B56γ3, endogenous B56γ3 is expressed in both cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 4B), and similarly, A and C subunits along with B56γ3 were increased in the nuclear fraction upon progression into the S phase (Fig. 4B, left, and quantified in C). When endogenous B56γ3 was specifically knocked down (near 60% reduction) (Fig. 4, A and B, middle), the levels of increase in nuclear A and C subunits were substantially reduced in S phase as compared with that in control shLuc knockdown cells (Fig. 4B, middle, and quantified in C). Although the levels of increase in nuclear A and C subunits were substantially reduced due to B56γ3 knockdown when cells entered S phase, we noticed that there was a significant variation in levels of increased A and C subunits among experiments (Fig. 4C, middle). Because the three B56γ splice variants, B56γ1, B56γ2, and B56γ3, share high identity (98%) in amino acid sequences and all variants locate to the nucleus (13McCright B. Rivers A.M. Audlin S.

https://openalex.org/W1988162549,"alpha-Synuclein is a small presynaptic protein implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease. Nevertheless, its physiological roles and mechanisms remain incompletely understood. alpha-Synuclein is not only expressed in neurons but also in the vascular endothelium, which contains intracellular granules called Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs) that contain a number of chemokines, adhesive molecules, and inflammatory cytokines. This study explored whether the exocytosis of WPB is regulated by alpha-synuclein. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-, thrombin-, or forskolin-induced von Willebrand factor release or translocation of P-selectin from endothelial cells were inhibited by alpha- and beta-synuclein but not gamma-synuclein. Three point mutants (A30P, A53T, and E46K) found in familial Parkinson disease also inhibited WPB exocytosis similar to that of wild-type alpha-synuclein. Furthermore, the negative regulation of WPB exocytosis required the N terminus or the nonamyloid beta-component of Alzheimer disease amyloid region of alpha-synuclein, but not the C-terminal acidic tail, and alpha-synuclein affected WPB exocytosis through interference with RalA activation by enhancing the interaction of RalGDS-beta-arrestin complexes. Immuno-EM analysis revealed that alpha-synuclein was localized close to WPBs. These findings imply that alpha-synuclein plays as a negative regulator in WPB exocytosis in endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2109575852,"One of the goals of evolutionary developmental biology is to link specific adaptations to changes in developmental pathways. The dentition of cypriniform fishes, which in contrast to many other teleost fish species possess pharyngeal teeth but lack oral teeth, provides a suitable model to study the development of feeding adaptations. Here, we have examined the involvement of retinoic acid (RA) in tooth development and show that RA is specifically required to induce the pharyngeal tooth developmental program in zebrafish. Perturbation of RA signaling at this stage abolished tooth induction without affecting the development of tooth-associated ceratobranchial bones. We show that this inductive event is dependent on RA synthesis from aldh1a2 in the ventral posterior pharynx. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling has been shown to be critical for tooth induction in zebrafish, and its loss has been associated with oral tooth loss in cypriniform fishes. Pharmacological treatments targeting the RA and FGF pathways revealed that both pathways act independently during tooth induction. In contrast, we find that in Mexican tetra and medaka, species that also possess oral teeth, both oral and pharyngeal teeth are induced independently of RA. Our analyses suggest an evolutionary scenario in which the gene network controlling tooth development obtained RA dependency in the lineage leading to the cypriniforms. The loss of pharyngeal teeth in this group was cancelled out through a shift in aldh1a2 expression, while oral teeth might have been lost ultimately due to deficient RA signaling in the oral cavity."
https://openalex.org/W2067043622,"Ultra-luminous infrared galaxies are among the most luminous objects in the local universe and are thought to be powered by intense star formation. It has been shown that in these objects the rotational spectral lines of molecular hydrogen observed at mid-infrared wavelengths are not affected by dust obscuration, leaving unresolved the source of excitation of this emission. Here I report an analysis of archival Spitzer Space Telescope data on ultra-luminous infrared galaxies and demonstrate that star formation regions are buried inside optically thick clouds of gas and dust, so that dust obscuration affects star-formation indicators but not molecular hydrogen. I thereby establish that the emission of H_2 is not co-spatial with the buried starburst activity and originates outside the obscured regions. This is rather surprising in light of the standard view that H_2 emission is directly associated with star-formation activity. Instead, I propose that H_2 emission in these objects traces shocks in the surrounding material, which are in turn excited by interactions with nearby galaxies, and that powerful large-scale shocks cooling by means of H_2 emission may be much more common than previously thought. In the early universe, a boost in H_2 emission by this process may speed up the cooling of matter as it collapsed to form the first stars and galaxies and would make these first structures more readily observable."
https://openalex.org/W2108253463,"Heterozygous nonsense mutations in the CDSN gene encoding corneodesmosin (CDSN), an adhesive protein expressed in cornified epithelia and hair follicles, cause hypotrichosis simplex of the scalp (HSS), a nonsyndromic form of alopecia. Truncated mutants of CDSN ((mut)CDSN), which bear the N-terminal adhesive Gly/Ser-rich domain (GS domain) of the protein, abnormally accumulate as amorphous deposits at the periphery of hair follicles and in the papillary dermis of the patient skin. Here, we present evidence that the (mut)CDSN deposits display an affinity for amyloidophilic dyes, namely Congo red and thioflavin T. We also detected the serum amyloid protein component in the dermis of HSS patients. We demonstrated that recombinant forms of (mut)CDSN and of the GS domain assemble in vitro into ring-shaped oligomeric structures and fibrils. The amyloid-like nature of the fibrils was demonstrated by dye binding and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry measurements. We showed that the ring-shaped oligomers of (mut)CDSN, but not the fibrillar forms, are toxic to cultured keratinocytes. Finally, online algorithms predicted the GS domain to be a particularly disordered region of CDSN in agreement with circular dichroism measurements. This identifies HSS as a human amyloidosis related to the aggregation of natively unfolded (mut)CDSN polypeptides into amyloid fibrils."

Recently, MEKK3 (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3) but not TAK1 (TGF-β activated kinase 1) has been demonstrated to play an essential role in LPA and protein kinase C (PKC)-induced IKKβ/NF-κB activation in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells (22Sun W.

Phosphorylation of the specific serine or threonine residues within the activation loop of the protein kinase located between kinase subdomains VII and VIII is one of the critical steps for kinase activation (23Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar). In the case of MEKK3, previous studies have demonstrated that phosphorylation of several serine/threonine residues on MEKK3 can be induced by distinct extracellular stimuli. For example, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) induces MEKK3 phosphorylation at Ser-166 and Ser-337 residues (24Adams D.G. Sachs N.A. Vaillancourt R.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 407: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) while interleukin-1 (IL-1) induces MEKK3 phosphorylation at Ser-526 residue that is required for MEKK3-mediated mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and NF-κB activation (25Zhang D.

Recently, we found that phosphorylation of Thr-516 and Ser-520 residues in the kinase activation loop of MEKK3 is required for LPA-mediated IKKβ/NF-κB activation (27Sun W. Ge N. Yu Y. Burlingame S. Li X. Zhang M. Ye S. Fu S. Yang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 7911-7918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Although a better understanding has been achieved regarding the mechanism of the MEKK3 activation, it remains unclear how MEKK3 activation is down-regulated in the cells and which member(s) of the protein serine/threonine phosphatase family dephosphorylate(s) the conserved residues Thr-516 and Ser-520 within the kinase activation loop of MEKK3 and inhibit(s) MEKK3-mediated signal transduction pathway. In the human genome, protein serine/threonine phosphatases are mainly composed of two structurally distinct families: PPP and PPM/PP2C (28Gallego M. Virshup D.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 29Cohen P.T. Browne G.J. Delibegovic M. Munro S. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 366: 135-144PubMed Google Scholar). The PPP family, including PPP1, PPP2/PP2A, PPP3/PP2B, PPP4, PPP5, PPP6, and PPP7, consists of a highly conserved catalytic domain and distinct regulatory domains or subunits. The PPM family is a group of monomeric metal-ion-dependent phosphatases including PPM1A, PPM1B, PPM1C, PPM1D/wip1, PPM1E, PPM1F, PPM1G, PPM1H, PPM1J, PPM1L, PPM1K, PPM1M, PHLPP, PPTC7, PPM2C. The heterotrimeric protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), is a ubiquitous and conserved serine/threonine phosphatase with broad substrate specificity and diverse cellular functions. PP2A consists of a dimeric core enzyme comprising of the structural A and catalytic C subunits, and a regulatory B subunit. In this report, we used a functional genomic approach to identify the MEKK3 phosphatase(s) by screening a library of serine/threonine phosphatases whose overexpression inhibits MEKK3-mediated NF-κB activation and dephosphorylates MEKK3 at the conserved Thr-516 and Ser-520 residues within the kinase activation loop. Here we present evidence that PP2A functions as the MEKK3 phosphatase and terminates LPA and PKC-induced IKKβ/NF-κB activation through dephosphorylating and inactivating MEKK3. HEK-293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and transfected with FuGene 6 according to the manufacturer's recommendation. HeLa cells were cultured in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, sodium pyruvate (1 mm), and transfected with FuGene HD following the manufacturer's protocol.

The PP2Ac-D85N mutant expression construct was generated by site-directed PCR mutagenesis (Stratagene) and verified by DNA sequencing. A cDNA construct containing the full-length open reading frame of the wild-type human MEKK3 was subcloned into the HA-tagged mammalian expression vectors pcDNA3.1. HA-MEKK3-T516E/ S520D and HA-MEKK3-T516A/S520A mutant expression constructs were generated by site-directed PCR mutagenesis and verified by DNA sequencing as described before (27Sun W. Ge N. Yu Y.

Mammalian expression vector for HA-IKKβ was obtained from Dr. Paul Chiao (The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center). The NF-κB-dependent firefly luciferase reporter plasmid and pCMV promoter-dependent Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid were purchased from Clontech (Mountain View, CA). A pSuper-retro vector (Oligoengine) was used to generate shRNA plasmids for PP2Ac. For PP2Ac β-isoform shRNA, the following target sequences have been selected: 5′-AATTACTGTTATCGTTGTGGG-3′ (sh-PP2Ac-1), 5′-AAGAGGTTCGTTGCCCTGTTA-3′ (sh-PP2Ac-2); pSuper-shRNA-control is: 5′-CTGGCATCGGTGTGGATGA-3′. The authenticity of these plasmids was confirmed by sequencing. Antibodies against HA epitope (F-7) and Myc epitope (9E10) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); antibodies against Flag epitope, β-actin were from Sigma-Aldrich. Antibodies against phospho-IKKα/β, IKKβ, and secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Danvers, MA). Antibodies against PP2A, C subunit were from Upstate (Millipore) Company (Billerica, MA). Antibodies against MEKK3 were from BD Biosciences Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Polyclonal antibodies specific for phospho-human MEKK3 (pThr-516/pSer-520) were produced by immunizing rabbits with MEKK3 phosphopeptide (GASKRLQpTICMpSGTGMR) at Genemed Synthesis, Inc. (San Antonio, TX). LPA, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), ionomycin (Iono), and polybrene were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. FuGene 6 and FuGene HD transfection reagents were from Roche (Alameda, CA). Lambda Protein Phosphatase (λ-PPase) was purchased from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). Cell culture media were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was obtained from Bio-Rad. The ECL-Plus Western blotting system was purchased from GE Healthcare Biosciences Corp. (Piscataway, NJ). The luciferase reporter gene assay was performed using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) and a Monolight 3010 luminometer (BD Biosciences Pharmingen) as described previously (31Yang J. Lin Y. Guo Z. Cheng J. Huang J. Deng L. Liao W. Chen Z. Liu Z. Su B. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Briefly, targeted cells were transiently co-transfected with specific vectors and an NF-κB-dependent firefly luciferase reporter construct as well as a Renilla luciferase control construct. Cellular extracts were prepared 36 h post-transfection and the luciferase activities were determined. Relative NF-κB luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. Data are presented as the mean ± S.D. and are representative of three independent experiments. The pSuper-sh-PP2Ac retroviral construct was transfected into HEK-293T cells with retrovirus packing vector Pegpam 3e and RDF vector using FuGene 6 transfection reagent. Viral supernatants were collected after 48 and 72 h. HeLa cells were incubated with virus-containing medium in the presence of 4 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma Aldrich). Stable cell lines were established after 5 days of puromycin (2 μg/ml) selection and knockdown of the target gene was confirmed by Western blotting. Cells were harvested in ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4) and spun down. The pellets were dissolved in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% IGEPAL, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, 20 mm disodium p-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP), 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate (OV), 10 mm sodium fluoride, phosphatase inhibitor mixture A and B (Sigma Aldrich Co.)). The cell lysates were either subjected directly to 10% SDS-PAGE for immunoblotting analysis or immunoprecipitated for 3 h with the indicated antibodies. Immune complexes were recovered with protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 3 h, then washed three times with wash buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.05% Triton X-100. For immunoblotting, the immunoprecipitates or 10% whole cell lysates (WCL) were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were immunoblotted with various antibodies, and the bound antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies against rabbit or mouse IgG using the ECL-Plus Western blotting system according to the manufacturer's instruction. HEK-293T cells seeded onto 10-cm dishes were transfected with the HA-MEKK3, Flag-PP2Ac wild type, or Flag-PP2Ac phosphatase-deficient D85N mutant expression plasmid, respectively. The Flag-PP2Ac-WT/D85N proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell extracts with anti-Flag antibodies. The phosphorylated HA-MEKK3 in the cell extracts was incubated with the immunoprecipitated Flag-PP2Ac wild-type or phosphatase-deficient D85N mutant protein in phosphatase 2A buffer (25 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 20 mm MnCl2, 0.01% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% bovine serum albumin) or λ-PPase at 30 °C for 30 min. The phosphatase reactions were then terminated by boiling in protein sample buffer, and proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. The levels of HA-MEKK3 phosphorylation were measured by immunoblotting analysis with antibodies against phospho-MEKK3 (pThr-516/pSer-520). Our previous studies demonstrate that MEKK3 phosphorylation at Thr-516 and Ser-520 residues within the kinase activation loop is essential for MEKK3-mediated IKK/NF-κB activation (27Sun W. Ge N. Yu Y. Burlingame S. Li X. Zhang M. Ye S. Fu S. Yang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 7911-7918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, the identity of phosphatase(s) that control(s) MEKK3 activity through Thr-516/Ser-520 residues remains to be determined. To identify which phosphatase(s) are involved in dephosphorylating and down-regulating MEKK3-mediated NF-κB activation, we co-transfected HA-tagged MEKK3 expression plasmid into HEK-293T cells with expression vectors encoding twenty two human protein serine/threonine phosphatases (catalytic subunits if it is multimeric) including 10 PPPs and 12 PPMs. Then we used an NF-κB luciferase reporter assay to assess the effect of overexpression of each phosphatase on MEKK3-induced NF-κB activation. In this screen, as shown in Fig. 1A, PP2Ac as well as PPM1A and PPM1B almost completely abolished MEKK3-induced NF-κB activation whereas other phosphatases had either no or less effect. To validate our results from the above screening assay, we chose the phosphatases with some degree of inhibition on MEKK3-induced NF-κB activation and examined the effects of overexpression of these phosphatases including PP2Ac, PPM1A, and PPM1B on the phosphorylation status of Thr-516 and Ser-520 at the MEKK3 kinase activation loop (Fig. 1B). Immunoblotting analysis of cell lysates revealed that the phosphorylation level of HA-MEKK3 at Thr-516 and Ser-520 was markedly reduced in the cells co-transfected with PP2Ac compared with the cells co-transfected with vector alone whereas total MEKK3 levels were similar in control cells and the cells with overexpression of other phosphatases (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that PP2A specifically dephosphorylates MEKK3 at Thr-516 and Ser-520 residues in cells. To assess whether the effects of PP2Ac on MEKK3 are due to their phosphatase activity, we generated expression vectors encoding PP2Ac phosphatase-deficient Asp-85 to Asn (D85N) mutant and found that only wild-type PP2Ac, but not phosphatase-deficient D85N mutant, abolished the phosphorylation of Thr-516 and Ser-520 at the activation loop of MEKK3 (Fig. 1C) and the MEKK3-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 1D). Consistent with above results, we found that overexpression of PP2Ac was able to abolish the wild-type MEKK3-induced NF-κB activation almost completely whereas it failed to terminate the NF-κB activation induced by the MEKK3 T516E/S520D constitutively active mutant (Fig. 1E). Consistent with our earlier report that PPM1A and PPM1B act as IKKβ phosphatases (30Sun W. Yu Y. Dotti G. Shen T. Tan X. Savoldo B. Pass A.K. Chu M. Zhang D. Lu X. Fu S. Lin X. Yang J. Cell Signal. 2009; 21: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we found that overexpression of PP2Ac had no effect on the phosphorylation of IKKβ at its conserved residues Ser-177/Ser-181 (Fig. 1F), suggesting that PP2A specifically targets on MEKK3 but not IKKβ to inhibit MEKK3-mediated NF-κB activation. To further determine whether PP2A is able to dephosphorylate the activated MEKK3 directly, we examined the phosphorylation status of the phosphorylated MEKK3 incubated with immunoprecipitated Flag-PP2Ac in vitro. In this assay, HA-MEKK3 was overexpressed in HEK-293T cells, and phosphorylated HA-MEKK3 in the cell extracts was incubated with the immunoprecipitated Flag-PP2Ac or its phosphatase-deficient D85N mutant protein, or λ-PPase as a control. The phosphorylation level of HA-MEKK3 was found to be significantly decreased by co-incubation with immunoprecipitated Flag-PP2Ac wild type, as well as with λ-PPase, but not phosphatase-deficient D85N mutant protein (Fig. 1G). These results demonstrate that PP2A targets on the phosphorylated Thr-516 and Ser-520 within the activation loop of MEKK3. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that PP2A acts as a MEKK3 phosphatase to terminate MEKK3-mediated IKKβ/NF-κB activation. To assess whether MEKK3 interacts with PP2A, the expression vectors encoding HA-tagged MEKK3 wild type or T516E/S520D mutant were co-transfected with vectors encoding Myc-tagged PP2Ac wild-type or -D85N mutant into HEK-293T cells. Then Myc-tagged PP2Ac wild type or -D85N mutant protein was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with anti-Myc antibodies and immunoblotted with anti-HA antibodies. Interestingly, PP2Ac-D85N mutant pulled down more HA-tagged MEKK3 compared with PP2Ac wild type (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, PP2Ac-D85N mutant pulled down much more HA-MEKK3-T516E/S520D mutant compared with PP2Ac wild type (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the above results, we found that the MEKK3 with double alanine mutations at Thr-516 and Ser-520 (MEKK3-T516A/S520A) residues could not bind either wild-type or -D85N mutant PP2Ac (data not shown). These results suggest that only phosphorylated MEKK3 binds to PP2A as its substrate. Previous studies suggest that LPA and PKC agonists induce MEKK3 phosphorylation and activation (22Sun W. Li H.

We further examined whether LPA and PKC agonists induce the association of MEKK3 with PP2A. In this assay, HEK-293T cells co-transfected with HA-MEKK3 and Myc-PP2Ac expression plasmids were treated with LPA for the time periods as indicated (Fig. 2B). The Myc-tagged PP2Ac in the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the antibodies against Myc epitope and immunoblotted with anti-HA antibodies to detect the presence of HA-tagged MEKK3. As shown in Fig. 2B, LPA rapidly induced association of MEKK3 wide type but not -T516A/S520A mutant with PP2Ac. These results suggest that LPA-induced MEKK3 phosphorylation and activation results in the binding of PP2Ac to the phosphorylated MEKK3. Consistent with this result, we also found that PKC agonists (PMA/Iono) also induced interaction of MEKK3 wide type with PP2Ac (Fig. 2C). LPA and PKC agonists-induced IKKβ/NF-κB activation requires MEKK3 phosphorylation at Thr-516 and Ser-520 residues (27Sun W. Ge N. Yu Y. Burlingame S. Li X. Zhang M. Ye S. Fu S. Yang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 7911-7918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To further address the role of PP2A in LPA-induced IKKβ phosphorylation and NF-κB activation, we generated shRNA expression vectors for knocking down the expression of PP2Ac and found that PP2Ac expression can be suppressed by these shRNA expression vectors (Fig. 3A). And that two sh-PP2Ac expression plasmids effectively rescued the inhibition of MEKK3-mediated NF-κB reporter activity by overexpression of PP2Ac (Fig. 3B). Subsequently we found that co-transfection of HA-MEKK3 with sh-PP2Ac expression vectors in HeLa cells resulted in a higher MEKK3-induced NF-κB activation in an NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 3C). We then generated PP2Ac stable knockdown HeLa cell lines using a retroviral transduction system and analyzed the effect of PP2Ac knockdown on the LPA-induced IKKβ phosphorylation. In this assay, HeLa cells with sh-control and sh-PP2Ac stable expression were treated with LPA or PMA/Iono (PKC agonists) for the different time periods as indicated and subsequently lysed (Fig. 3, D and E). We found that knockdown of PP2Ac expression caused the enhanced phosphorylation of IKKβ at the early time points of LPA and PMA/Iono stimulation, Consistent with the above results, knockdown of PP2Ac expression in HeLa cells resulted in a higher LPA or PKC-induced NF-κB activation in an NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 3, F and G). Taken together, these results demonstrate that PP2A is responsible for terminating LPA-induced MEKK3 phosphorylation and activation as well as inhibition of MEKK3-mediated IKKβ/NF-κB activation in the cells. We further examined the role of PP2A in IKKβ/NF-κB activation mediated by other signaling pathways. In these assays, we found that suppression of PP2Ac expression by shRNA in HeLa cells enhanced TNFα-, IL-1β-, and LPS-induced IKK phosphorylation and IL-6 mRNA expression (supplemental Fig. S1, A and D). In Jurkat cells, suppression of PP2Ac expression also enhanced PKC agonist (P/I)-induced IKK phosphorylation and IL-6 mRNA expression compared with the control cell line (supplemental Fig. S1, B, C, and E). These results suggest that PP2A plays an important role in the negative regulation of IKKβ/NF-κB activation mediated by diverse signaling pathways. Phosphorylation of MEKK3 at Thr-516 and Ser-520 within the kinase activation loop is required for LPA-induced IKKβ/NF-κB activation. Following LPA stimulation, MEKK3 phosphorylation and activation is rapidly induced and in turn leads to IKK/NF-κB activation (22Sun W. Li H. Yu Y. Fan Y. Grabiner B.C. Mao R. Ge N. Zhang H. Fu S. Lin X. Yang J. Cell Signal. 2009; 21: 1488-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 27Sun W. Ge N. Yu Y. Burlingame S. Li X. Zhang M. Ye S. Fu S. Yang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 7911-7918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of MEKK3 dephosphorylation and inactivation following LPA stimulation to attenuate LPA-induced NF-κB activation remains to be defined clearly. It is not clear which phosphatase(s) are truly MEKK3 phosphatase(s) that down-regulate(s) MEKK3 kinase activity through the dephosphorylation of MEKK3 at the conserved residues Thr-516 and Ser-520 within the kinase activation loop. Therefore, we decided to take a functional genomic approach to further analyze the mechanism of MEKK3 inactivation and identify MEKK3-specific phosphatase(s). In this study, we identify that PP2Ac is a major phosphatase involved in negatively regulating MEKK3 phosphorylation and activation. We demonstrate that PP2Ac is essential to terminate MEKK3-mediated IKK/NF-κB activation through binding to the activated form of MEKK3 and dephosphorylating MEKK3 at Thr-516 and Ser-520. Our studies suggest that PP2A functions as a MEKK3 phosphatase and serves as an important Yin-Yang regulatory mechanism to maintain a delicate balance in LPA-mediated cellular responses. In this investigation, we found that only PP2Ac phosphatase-deficient mutant but not the wild type were able to pull-down the phosphorylated MEKK3, as demonstrated by our co-transfection and immunoprecipitation assays. These data suggest that PP2Ac only binds to the phosphorylated MEKK3. In addition, LPA induces the interaction between MEKK3 and PP2A in a temporary fashion. However, we could not show the LPA-induced endogenous MEKK3 and PP2Ac binding possibly due to lack of good antibodies for immunoprecipitation of MEKK3 and PP2Ac. Together, these results suggest that LPA-induced MEKK3 activation is rapidly terminated by PP2A through physical binding to and dephosphorylating MEKK3. Several kinases have been identified to be the substrates for PP2A including calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV (CaMKIV) (32Westphal R.S. Anderson K.A. Means A.R. Wadzinski B.E.

In our study, we found that suppression of PP2Ac expression in HeLa cells enhanced both LPA- and P/I-induced ERK and JNK phosphorylation (supplemental Fig. S2). However, suppression of PP2Ac expression in HeLa cells did not affect both LPA- and P/I-induced AKT1 phosphorylation at Thr-308 (supplemental Fig. S2). It is likely that LPA and P/I-induced AKT1 phosphorylation and activation is not negatively regulated by PP2Ac. Interestingly, PP2A has been suggested to be able to dephosphorylate MEKK3 at the Ser-526 residue (26Fritz A. Brayer K.J. McCormick N. Adams D.G. Wadzinski B.E. Vaillancourt R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6236-6245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Consistent with this report, we found that PP2A also dephosphorylated MEKK3 at Thr-516 and Ser-520 residues. Together, PP2A is able to dephosphorylate MEKK3 at the above three sites to inactivate MEKK3-mediated downstream signal transduction. In conclusion, our data provide evidence of the physical and functional interaction between MEKK3 and PP2A. In view of the data presented here and in previous reports, we propose a working model (Fig. 4), in which upon LPA-induced MEKK3 phosphorylation at Thr-516, Ser-520, and Ser-526, PP2A would bind to the phosphorylated MEKK3 and act as a MEKK3 phosphatase to inactivate LPA-induced MEKK3 activation as well as MEKK3-mediated IKKβ/NF-κB activation. This report demonstrates that PP2A terminates LPA-induced IKKβ/NF-κB activation through dephosphorylating and inactivating MEKK3.

https://openalex.org/W1983287219,"The Escherichia coli Hsp40 DnaJ uses its J-domain (Jd) to couple ATP hydrolysis and client protein capture in Hsp70 DnaK. Fusion of the Jd to peptide p5 (as in Jdp5) dramatically increases the apparent affinity of the p5 moiety for DnaK in the presence of ATP, and Jdp5 stimulates ATP hydrolysis in DnaK by several orders of magnitude. NMR experiments with [(15)N]Jdp5 demonstrated that the peptide tethers the Jd to the ATPase domain. Thus, ATP hydrolysis and client protein binding in DnaK are coupled principally through the association of the client with DnaJ. Overexpression of a recombinant Jd was specifically toxic to cells that simultaneously expressed DnaK. No toxicity was observed when overexpressing Jdp5 or mutant Jd or when co-overexpressing the Jd and the nucleotide exchange factor GrpE. The results suggest that the Jd shifts DnaK to a client-bound form by stimulating the DnaK ATPase but only when the Jd is brought to DnaK by a client-Hsp40 complex."

In contrast to the extensive work on cyt c and c2, very little is known about ligand interactions with the heme of cyt c1, which is a key component of the cyt bc1 complex, a ubiquitous and ancient membrane-bound, energy-transducing, electron transport protein (22.Berry E.A. Guergova-Kuras M. Huang L.S. Crofts A.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 1005-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 23.Crofts A.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2004; 66: 689-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c1 is an integral membrane protein with a single hydrophobic transmembrane helix and a globular heme-binding domain with a typical c-type heme covalently attached to the protein by thioether linkages to two cysteine residues. A histidine and a methionine provide the fifth and sixth heme iron ligands, respectively. Although the globular domain shares many of the properties and folds of type I cytochromes c, the sequence has little homology with that of cyt c or c2 (22.Berry E.A. Guergova-Kuras M. Huang L.S. Crofts A.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 1005-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 24.Baymann F. Lebrun E. Nitschke W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Rev. 2006; 106: 90-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and cyt c1 is assigned to a separate class. The unusual structural features of cytochrome c1 have been most convincingly accounted for by Baymann et al. (24.Baymann F. Lebrun E. Nitschke W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 17737-17740Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). By comparing sequences of cyt c1 from different species, they suggested that the expanded regions of cyt c1 arose by evolution from a diheme cytochrome c4 that lost the second heme. This hypothesis nicely explains why the globular heme-binding domain of cytochromes c1 is up to 2 times larger than cyt c, with the major expansion in the C-terminal (or distal) half of the protein. Mutational studies on cyt c1 have shown that changing the endogenous methionine ligand significantly modifies the midpoint potential of cyt c1 (26.Darrouzet E. Mandaci S. Li J. Qin H. Knaff D.B.

However, very little has been reported for exogenous ligand interactions with the c1 heme. Schejter and Berke (30.Schejter A. Berke G. Biochim. Biophys.

Guergova-Kuras et al. (33.Guergova-Kuras M. Salcedo-Hernandez R. Bechmann G. Kuras R. Gennis R.B. Crofts A.R. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 15: 370-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) found that His-tagged bc1 complex from Rhodobacter sphaeroides was inhibited when isolated with imidazole. This was attributed to lowering of Em7 of cyt c1 induced by imidazole binding on the basis of its known interaction with cyt c. In this work, we describe and characterize the reversible binding of Im to cyt c1 in isolated cyt bc1 complex from R. sphaeroides, causing a large drop in midpoint potential and full inhibition of cyt bc1 activity. We discuss the implications of the thermodynamics of Im binding in terms of the dynamics of the heme domain and the peptide sequence that contains the sixth axial ligand of the c1 heme iron and use molecular dynamics to illustrate the probable mode of interaction of Im in the heme pocket. The kinetics of Im binding are described in the accompanying article (70.Kokhan O. Shinkarev V.P. Wraight C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 22522-22531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and reveal novel, transient interactions of the ligand with the protein, leading to facilitated entry into the heme pocket. The strain of R. sphaeroides with a hexahistidine tag attached to the C terminus of cyt b was generously provided by Dr. A. R. Crofts (strain BC17 carrying the pGB11BH6 plasmid) (33.Guergova-Kuras M. Salcedo-Hernandez R. Bechmann G. Kuras R. Gennis R.B. Crofts A.R. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 15: 370-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Cells were grown photosynthetically at 30 °C on Sistrom's medium with 2 μg/ml tetracycline and 10 μg/ml of kanamycin. R. sphaeroides cells were collected by a 10-min centrifugation at 8,000 × g and resuspended with 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 100 mm KCl (buffer B). DNase I was added to a concentration of 10 μg/ml. The cells were disrupted with a French press at 17,000 p.s.i., and debris was removed by a 20-min centrifugation at 48,000 × g. The supernatant was centrifuged for 90 min at 140,000 × g, and the pellet was resuspended in buffer B. Cytochrome bc1 complex was isolated from R. sphaeroides chromatophores and purified in a single step by following the protocol described by Guergova-Kuras et al. (33.Guergova-Kuras M. Salcedo-Hernandez R. Bechmann G. Kuras R. Gennis R.B. Crofts A.R. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 15: 370-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) with modifications. Unless otherwise specified, bc1 complex was isolated as follows. 10 ml of chromatophores (A375 = 50 OD units) were mixed with 10 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin equilibrated in buffer B (1:2, v/v). Dodecyl maltoside (DM) was added to a final concentration of 1% (w/v) and stirred at 4 °C for 40 min. The mixture was transferred to a column, and the resin was packed while eluting. The column (packed volume ∼3 ml) was washed with buffer B plus 20 mm cholate, 1 mm ascorbate at 1 ml/min for 90–120 min. bc1 complex was eluted with buffer B plus 20 mm cholate, 1 mm ascorbate, 10 mm EDTA). The bc1 complex was washed by repeated dilution with buffer B plus 20 mm cholate and concentration using Centriplus (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA) concentrators with 10 kDa cut-off and finally concentrated to ∼50 μm, mixed with glycerol (to 20%, v/v), and stored at −80 °C. Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was obtained from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). Decyl-ubiquinone was either from BioMol (Plymouth Meeting, PA) or from Sigma. Horse heart cytochrome c (C2506) and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. DM was purchased from Anatrace (Maumee, OH). Decyl-ubiquinol (DQH2) was prepared from decyl-ubiquinone as described by Trumpower and Edwards (34.Trumpower B.L. Edwards C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8697-8706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of electron transfer from decyl-ubiquinol to cyt c catalyzed by bc1 was measured from the rate of reduction of cyt c using the extinction coefficient Δϵ551–540 = 18.5 mm−1 cm−1 (35.Margoliash E. Frohwirt N. Biochem. J. 1959; 71: 570-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar), in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 25 μm cyt c, 20 μm DQH2, 0.01% DM, and 10–20 nm bc1 complex, at room temperature, using an Agilent 8453 spectrophotometer, unless otherwise stated. Non-enzymatic electron transport was measured in the same buffer in the absence of the enzyme, and the rate was subtracted from the enzymatic one. Imidazole binding was monitored either by following spectral changes at ΔA416–400 or by adding ascorbate and diaminodurene (DAD; 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine) to final concentrations of 1 mm and 10 μm, respectively, at various times after incubation with imidazole and measuring the fraction of cyt c1 reduced rapidly (t½ < 1 s). Because the cyt c1-imidazole complex has a much lower midpoint potential than free cyt c1, only the latter is promptly reduced after mixing with ascorbate/DAD. Ferricyanide-oxidized bc1 complex (100 μm ferricyanide and bc1 complex, containing 0.5–2 μm cyt c1 (Δϵ552–541 = 20 mm−1 cm−1 (36.Wood P.M. Biochem. J. 1980; 192: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm cholate) was incubated with various amounts of imidazole at room temperature or on ice. Imidazole binding to heme (free or in protein) is well established to occur through the deprotonated nitrogen (11.Schejter A. Aviram I. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 37.Saleem M.M.M. Wilson M.T. Inorganica Chimica Acta. 1988; 153: 93-98Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Literature values for the pKa of both imidazole and N-methylimidazole are 6.95–7.05, and they are generally considered the same (38.Perrin D.D. Dissociation Constants of Organic Bases in Aqueous Solution. Butterworths, London1965: 190-193Google Scholar, 39.Tanokura M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 576-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). At pH 8, used here, both are 90% deprotonated, and concentrations and concentration-dependent parameters (e.g. Kd) are given in terms of total concentration of Im or MeIm, without correction. Kinetic measurements of reactions with rate constants slower than 0.5 s−1 were typically performed on a diode-array Agilent 8453 spectrophotometer (integration time 100 ms) equipped with a UV blocking filter (Corning CS 0–52, cut-off wavelength 320 nm) to prevent a light-induced reduction of cyt c1. All reactions faster than 1 s−1 were studied using an Applied Photophysics SX-17MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer, with mixing time less than 2 ms and integration time 2.5 ms. Reactions with rate constants in the 0.5–1 s−1 range were typically studied using both instruments to provide overlap of the measurement ranges. Molecular dynamics simulations of imidazole bound to cyts c, c2, and c1 were done on the Turing cluster operated by the Computational Science and Engineering program at the University of Illinois, using the NAMD molecular dynamics program (40.Phillips J.C. Braun R. Wang W. Gumbart J.C. Tajkhorshid E. Villa E. Chipot C. Skeel R.D. Kale L. Schulten K. J. Comp. Chem. 2005; 26: 1781-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (13350) Google Scholar). All simulations were performed at constant particle number, pressure (1 atm) and temperature (300 K), following the procedure of Autenrieth et al. (41.Autenrieth F. Tajkhorshid E. Baudry J. Luthey-Schulten Z. J. Comput. Chem. 2004; 25: 1613-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), with the CHARMM 27 force field (42.Brooks B.R. Brooks 3rd, C.L. Mackerell Jr., A.D. Nilsson L.

Atom coordinates for simulation of horse heart cyt c with Im were taken from the Protein Data Bank 1FI7 NMR structure (14.Banci L. Bertini I. Liu G. Lu J. Reddig T. Tang W. Wu Y. Yao Y. Zhu D. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2001; 6: 628-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For cyt c2, the coordinates were from the Protein Data Bank 1CXA x-ray structure (13.Axelrod H.L. Feher G. Allen J.P. Chirino A.J. Day M.W. Hsu B.T. Rees D.C. Acta Crystallogr. D. 1994; 50: 596-602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All simulations on ligand interaction with cyt c1 of R. sphaeroides were performed on the globular domain from Protein Data Bank entry 2FYN (44.Esser L. Gong X. Yang S. Yu L. Yu C.A. Xia D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13045-13050Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). All crystallographic water molecules were removed, and each protein was placed in a water-filled box (see supplemental material). Preparation of the imidazole-bound state of cyt c1 was initiated by “opening” the heme cleft by pulling on the methionine sulfur atom in a short (1–2-ns) simulation until the force dropped due to reorientation of the Met-185 side chain (at about 600 piconewtons). Four simulations (10–25 ns) were performed for each protein: one with the imidazole ring oriented at 0° (for cyts c and c2, this corresponds to the known structures) and three simulations where the imidazole plane was rotated 90, 180, and 270° around the axis perpendicular to the heme plane. For cyt c1, the 0° position was based on the 1CXA structure for cyt c2, by aligning the hemes. Incubation of fully oxidized R. sphaeroides bc1 complex with Im resulted in significant spectral changes, similar to those reported for cytochromes c and c2 (11.Schejter A. Aviram I. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 12.Viola F. Aime S. Coletta M. Desideri A. Fasano M. Paoletti S. Tarricone C. Ascenzi P. J. Inorg.

The most prominent features of the difference spectrum were a peak at 400 nm and trough at 416 nm, with an isosbestic point at 406 nm (Fig. 1), indicating that Im interacts directly with cyt c1, causing a blue shift in the Soret peak at ∼414 nm. There was also a decrease in absorption around 700 nm (Fig. 1, inset). The wavelength and approximate extinction coefficient (0.2–0.5 mm−1 cm−1) of this feature are consistent with a characteristic absorbance attributed to the methionine S-heme Fe3+ bond, suggesting that Im displaces the methionine ligand from the heme of cyt c1, as previously observed for ferricytochrome c (11.Schejter A. Aviram I. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18.Schejter A. George P.

Cusanovich M.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7717-7724Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). No imidazole-induced spectral changes were seen for the ascorbate-reduced bc1 complex (cyt c1 and iron-sulfur center reduced, both b-hemes oxidized), indicating the sole involvement of ferric cytochrome c1 in the absorbance changes under oxidizing conditions (Fig. 1, dotted line). In the presence of imidazole, the cyt c1 heme becomes non-reducible by ascorbate/DAD (Fig. 2) except on a time scale of several min, which we ascribe to reduction after the release of Im. The midpoint potential of ascorbate is not very well defined, due to irreversibility (47.Clark W.M. Oxidation-Reduction Potentials of Organic Systems. Robert E. Krieger Publishing, Huntington, NY1972: 469-471Google Scholar), but Elberry et al. (48.Elberry M. Xiao K. Esser L. Xia D. Yu L. Yu C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) found that isolated bc1 complexes with mutant cyt c1 with Em ≈ +50 mV were 25–40% reducible by ascorbate. Thus, the midpoint potential of the c1-Im complex is significantly less than +50 mV. However, it is very rapidly (<1 s) reduced by sodium dithionite (Eh ≤ −300 mV), indicating that at sufficiently low potential, the c1-Im complex can be reduced directly rather than after release of Im. This is confirmed by the more distinct peak at 550 nm (Fig. 2B, black). This feature decayed slowly to the native spectrum with a lifetime of about 90 s, reflecting the slow unbinding of Im from the ferrous heme. The implied large drop in midpoint potential of cyt c1 with bound Im provides a convenient assay of the fraction of cyt c1 with bound ligand; only uncomplexed cyt c1 (Em7 ≈ 260 mV (49.Margalit R. Schejter A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 32: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar)) can be quickly reduced by ascorbate/DAD. A similar assay was used by Osyzcka et al. (32.Osyczka A. Moser C.C. Dutton P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1655: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) to monitor binding of cyanide to cyt bc1. Binding of imidazole by cyt c1 is quite tight but slow. At 25 °C, Im binding to cyt c1 was sufficiently fast that the kinetics and end point values could be readily monitored by the spectral changes in the Soret band at 416–400 nm. Fig. 3A shows kinetic traces obtained at 25 °C with Im concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 5 mm. From the amplitudes of the final absorbance change, we estimated Kd = 0.33 ± 0.07 mm (Fig. 3B). At lower temperatures, the rate of binding decreased dramatically. At 15 °C, binding could still be assayed by the spectral change in the Soret band and gave Kd = 0.12 ± 0.015 mm. At 0 °C, however, binding was extremely slow, especially at the lowest Im concentrations, and was followed over a period of 10 days (Fig. 4B). The extent of binding at each time point was measured by the reducibility of cyt c1 by ascorbate/DAD (Fig. 4A). This yielded a dissociation constant, Kd = 40 ± 7 μm (Fig. 4C). Combining the dissociation constants at temperatures 0, 15, and 25 °C leads to ΔH0 = −56 ± 6 kJ/mol and ΔS0 = −121 ± 18 J/mol/K for the Im binding (Kd−1) equilibrium (Table 1).TABLE 1Temperature dependence of ligand bindingKdΔH0ΔS0Source/ReferencemmkJ mol−1J mol−1 K−1cyt c1-Im0.33 ± 0.07−56 ± 6−121 ± 18This workcyt c1-MeIm9.3 ± 2.947 ± 6197 ± 16This workcyt c-Im(30)aKd measured at 311 K.48.5184Ref. 51.Shao W.

Open table in a new tab Binding of N-methylimidazole induced a spectral change identical to that of imidazole in the Soret region (not shown) and was assayed using the same wavelength pair 400 minus 416 nm. However, MeIm binding was much faster than Im (Fig. 5). The equilibrium position was readily obtained, yielding Kd = 9.3 ± 2.9 mm at 25 °C. This is 30-fold weaker than Im binding. At 15 °C, the MeIm dissociation constant was 18 mm. These values yield ΔH0 = 47 ± 6 kJ/mol and ΔS0 = 197 ± 16 J/mol/K for MeIm binding, dramatically different than for Im (Table 1). Because imidazole binds to the cyt c used in the assay of bc1 activity (Kd ≈ 30 mm (10.Dumortier C. Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 371: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 21.Sutin N. Yandell J.K. J. Biol.

The initial turnover of the bc1 complex saturated with 10 mm imidazole was fully inhibited (Fig. 6), which was confirmed by measurements with a 10-fold higher concentration of bc1 complex. However, after a short delay of a few seconds, cyt bc1 complex inhibited by Im showed recovery of the turnover rate during the time course, concomitant with the slow release of Im from cyt c1 (see Fig. 4A). The binding of small molecules to c-type hemes has been widely studied in type I cytochromes c, where displacement of the native methionine ligand is accompanied by conformational changes in the heme binding domain (13.Axelrod H.L.

After ANP stimulation, NPR1/GCA down-regulates the transcriptional activity of its gene via a cGMP-dependent mechanism. Because we previously identified a cis-acting element responsible for this cGMP sensitivity, we proceed here to explore novel putative protein binding to cGMP-response element (cGMP-RE). Using the yeast one-hybrid technique with a human kidney cDNA library, we identified a strong positive clone able to bind cGMP-RE. The clone was derived from 1083-bp-long cDNA of a gene of yet unknown function localized on human chromosome 1 (1p33.36). We named this new protein GREBP (for cGMP-response element-binding protein). DNA binding assays showed 18-fold higher cGMP-RE binding capacity than the controls, whereas an electromobility shift assay indicated a specific binding for the cGMP-RE, and chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed the binding of GREBP to the element under physiological conditions. By acting on cGMP-RE, GREBP inhibited the expression of a luciferase-coupled NPR1 promoter construct. In H295R cells, ANP heightened GREBP expression by 60% after just 3 h of treatment while inhibiting NPR1/GCA expression by 30%. Silencing GREBP with specific small interfering RNA increased the activity of the luciferase-coupled NPR1 promoter and GCA/NPR1 mRNA levels. GREBP is a nuclear protein mainly expressed in the heart.

Abe T. Misono K.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16941-16951Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Potter L.R. Hunter T. Methods. 1999; 19: 506-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The active NPR1/GCA receptor is a homodimer containing an extracellular ANP-binding domain at its amino-terminal end and an intracellular GC domain at its carboxyl-terminal end (17Garbers D.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The receptor is also able to transduce signals from brain natriuretic peptide but is insensitive to C-type natriuretic peptide stimulation; the latter exerts its effects through a second receptor that shares the same topology as NPR1/GCA, guanylyl cyclase B (GCB or NPR2), which preferentially binds C-type natriuretic peptide (18Garbers D.L.

Synthesized cGMP molecules then bind to target proteins, including the cGMP-dependent protein kinases (PKG) I and II, the cyclic-nucleotide gated ion channels, and the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (20Beavo J.A. Brunton L.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar), which we initially discovered as cGMP binding activity (21Hamet P. Coquil J.F. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1978; 4: 281-290PubMed Google Scholar). cGMP also regulates the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α, cyclooxygenase-2, and inducible nitric-oxide synthase (22Cheng H.F.

Transcriptional regulation by cGMP has been shown to occur both directly and indirectly. Indirect control affects upstream signaling pathways modulating specific targets; e.g. activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases by cGMP controls several transcription factors, such as cAMP-response element-binding protein, ternary complex factor, ATF-2 (activating transcription factor-2), and c-Jun (28Hazzalin C.A.

NPR1/GCA expression can be down-regulated by the intracellular accumulation of cGMP under the control of endothelins, glucocorticoids, and angiotensin II and by the natriuretic peptides themselves (15Huo X.

The effect of cGMP on NPR1/GCA consists of a retroinhibition loop that down-regulates the transcriptional activity of the NPR1/GCA gene upon stimulation by ANP or cGMP analogs (39Hum D. Besnard S. Sanchez R. Devost D. Gossard F. Hamet P. Tremblay J. Hypertension. 2004; 43: 1270-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 40Cao L. Wu J. Gardner D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24891-24897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Our group has recently reported the existence of a cGMP-response element (cGMP-RE) located in the promoter of NPR1/GCA gene which is responsible for the ANP-NPR1/GCA retroinhibition loop. We have defined a short consensus sequence of 18 bp for this cGMP-RE, AaAtRKaNTTCaAcAKTY, between positions −1372 and −1354 of the NPR1/GCA promoter. The sequence has been initially identified in the rat genome but is also found in mice (95% homology) and humans (75% homology). Deletion of this DNA-responsive element increases the transcriptional activity of the NPR1/GCA promoter by more than 40% (39Hum D. Besnard S. Sanchez R. Devost D. Gossard F. Hamet P. Tremblay J. Hypertension. 2004; 43: 1270-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This study identifies the first protein that binds to cGMP-RE and that inhibits the transcriptional activity of the NPR1/GCA gene. We named the novel transcription repressor GREBP (for cGMP-response element-binding protein). All plasmids produced were subcloned in DH5α bacterial strain and purified with a Qiagen maxiprep kit (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) or Invitrogen's Purelink maxiprep kit (Burlington, Canada). Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), followed by DNase I treatment (20 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 unit/ml RNAseOUT, 0.2 unit/μl DNase I), and re-extracted with TRIzol reagent. Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR (sqRT-PCR) was performed with a Moloney murine leukemia virus RT kit (Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus Reverse Transcriptase; Invitrogen) and Ambion's Quantum RNA 18 S internal standards (Austin, TX). A human kidney cDNA library was obtained from Clontech (Mountain View, CA) as pACT2 plasmids already transformed in the bacterial strain BNN132. The library was titrated, and the colonies were expanded in 30–150-mm Petri dishes to produce maximal amounts of pACT2 plasmids. Plasmids were extracted and purified with the Qiagen Gigaprep kit. One-hybrid screening was conducted with the Matchmaker one-hybrid system from Clontech. Human cGMP-RE (5′-AGGAAATGTACTTCAACATTCTGC-3′) was used as bait. The bait sequence was synthesized in three copies and cloned between the EcoRI and MluI site of pHISi and the EcoRI and SalI site of pLACZi. Plasmids pHISi-hcGMP-RE and pLACZi-hcGMP-RE were introduced in the genome of the yeast strain YM4271 by homologous recombination, and colonies were selected for growth on histidine/uracil-deficient synthetic dextrose medium. The new yeast strain, YM4271pHISipLACZi-hcGMP-RE, was then transformed with human kidney cDNA library plasmids to produce GAL4 activation domain fusion proteins. Colonies, selected for growth at 30 °C on histidine/uracil/leucine-deficient medium, containing 55 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, were tested for β-galactosidase expression by agarose overlay assays, as described in Ref. 41Duttweiler H.M. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 340-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar. Blue colonies were picked up, transferred in his/ura/leu-deficient liquid medium, and allowed to grow at high optical density (∼2). Liquid cultures were then retested for β-galactosidase activity with ortho-nitrophenyl-β-galactoside, a more sensitive assay, as described by the manufacturer; this classified the selected clones by the strength of interaction between the bait and the GALAD fusion protein, thus affecting reporter gene expression. We obtained a strong positive clone expressing high levels of the reporter genes; the pACT2 plasmid was then isolated from crude yeast lysate according to the Clontech protocol and transformed into DH5α Escherichia coli according to standard procedures. pACT2 plasmids were then isolated and sequenced with pACT2-sense (5′-TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGA-3′) and pACT2-antisense (5′-GTGAACTTGCGGGGTTTTTCAGTATCTACGA-3′). Constructs encoding the GREBP sequence were generated by standard PCR methods with specific primers. pGEX-3X-GREBP was produced with the sense primer 5′-TTGGATCCTTATGAACCATAACCAATAC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-TTGAATTCTGTTAGGGTTGTACGGT-3′; this fragment was cloned in frame with the glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene of pGEX-3X plasmid (GE Healthcare) at the BamHI/EcoRI site. Plasmid peGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) (Clontech) was used to produce peGFP-GREBP by introducing, at the KpnI/BamHI site, the GREBP-coding region generated with the sense primer 5′-TTGTCGACGGTACCATGAACCATAACCAATCTACC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-GTTCTACCGTACAACCCTAAGGATCC-3′. pCDNA1-Neo-GREBP was produced by cloning the coding sequence of the GREBP gene at the BamHI/NotI site of pCDNA1-Neo (Invitrogen). The coding sequence was amplified with the sense primer 5′-CGCCGGATCCGCCACCATGAACCATAACCAATACTACCA-3′ and antisense primer 5′-TTGCGGCCGCTTAGCGTTGTACGGTAGAAC-3′; the sense primer served to introduce the defined Kozak sequence (ccacc) to optimize gene translation, as defined in Ref. 42Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4160) Google Scholar. For the tagged versions of GREBP, GREBP-StrepTagII, and GREBP-HisTag, antisense primer 5′-AATCTAGATTACTTTTCGAACTGCGGGTGGCTCCAGGCGCCGGCGGGTTGTACGGTAGAACTGCT-3′ was used to add a 3-amino acid linker and a StrepTagII epitope at its carboxyl-terminal end, whereas the antisense primer 5′-AATCTAGATTAGTGGTGGTGATGGTGATGATGGTGGTGATGGGCGCCGGCGGGTTGTACGGTAGAACTGCT-3′ was used to add a 3-amino acid linker and a 10-histidine epitope also at its carboxyl-terminal end. For luciferase experiments, hGCAp-pGL3b was created by amplifying the human NPR1/GCA promoter with the Genome Walker kit from Clontech; the region −2055 to +338 bp of the promoter was then cloned by enzymatic digestion at the KpnI/NcoI site to control the luciferase gene of pGL3b plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI). The cGMP-RE-deleted form of the human NPR1/GCA promoter (hGCAp(ΔcGMP-RE)-pGL3b) was created with hGCAp-pGL3b as template. cGMP-RE was removed by jumping PCR with the sense primer 5′-AGTCTCCTAAAATTCCATATATGTAGTCTGTCTACACAGAATACCT-3′ and antisense primer 5′-GTATTCTGTGTAGACAGACTACATATATGGAATTTTAGGAGACTTG-3′. Jumping PCR allows removal of the cGMP-RE sequence while preserving the structural components of the promoter by cutting down two full turns (20 bp) of the plasmid. Silencing plasmids were generated with pSilencer 2.0-U6 (Ambion) by annealing and cloning inserts for small hairpin RNA (shRNA) at the BamHI/HindIII site. Control plasmid pSilencer 2.0-U6 non-target (NT) contains the upper strand 5′-GATCCCAGTGCTGGTACTTGTACTTCTCTTGAAAGTACAAGTACCAGCACTGTTTTTTTGGAAA-3′ and the lower strand 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAAACAGTGCTGGTACTTGTACTTTCAAGAGAAGTACAAGTACCAGCACTGG-3′. The non-target shRNA sequence was designed for its ability to activate the interference RNA pathways without targeting any gene, allowing rapid screening of gene-specific small interfering RNA, as used successfully by many groups (43Huang Q. Gumireddy K. Schrier M. le Sage C. Nagel R. Nair S. Egan D.A. Li A. Huang G. Klein-Szanto A.J. Gimotty P.A. Katsaros D. Coukos G. Zhang L. Puré E. Agami R. Nat.

The plasmid producing shRNA directed against GREBP was named pSilencer 2.0-U6-shRNA-GREBP and was created with the upper strand 5′- GATCCATGGGCCATTATCGAAGAATTCAAGAGATTCTTCGATAATGGCCCATTTTTTTGGAAA-3′ and the lower strand 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAAATGGGCCATTATCGAAGAATCTCTTGAATTCTTCGATAATGGCCCATG-3′. HEK293 (human embryonic kidney) and HeLa (human cervical carcinoma) cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's high glucose medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2% penicillin/streptomycin, 2 g/liter HEPES, and 2.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate in a 5% CO2 controlled atmosphere. NCI-H295R (human adrenocortical carcinoma, ATCC) cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2% penicillin/streptomycin, 2.0 g/liter HEPES, and 2.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate. Transfections were performed with Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primer extension was conducted on HEK293 total RNA. Briefly, 5 μg of HEK293 total RNA was Moloney murine leukemia virus retrotranscribed with 45 fmol of specific radioactive antisense primer 5′-GGAGAGATTTGGTATATG-3′. The length of the extension was then compared with the sequence of pACT2 plasmid containing GREBP cDNA to calculate the number of unknown nucleotides in GREBP. pACT2 plasmid was sequenced by the Thermo sequenase kit (GE Healthcare) and the same radioactive antisense primer. The total length of GREBP mRNA was then confirmed by PCR with the antisense primer 5′-GGTAGGAGTAGCGTGGTAAG-3′ and two sense primers corresponding to regions −5/−25 (5′-GGTTATATCCTTCCCGTACT-3′) or +1/+20 (5′-ATCCCCTGGCCCAACCCGTC-3′) of GREBP cDNA. Tritransfection assays were undertaken to study the effect of GREBP protein on NPR1/GCA promoter activity. The day before transfection, HEK293 cells were seeded in a 12-well plate (7 × 104 cells/well), and plasmids hGCAp-pGL3p or hGCAp(ΔcGMP-RE)-pGL3b, pCDNA1-Neo, and/or pCDNA1-Neo-GREBP (for overexpression experiments), pSilencer 2.0-U6-NT or pSilencer 2.0-U6-shRNA-GREBP (for silencing experiments), and internal control pCMV-βgal (Clontech) plasmids were transfected and allowed to grow for 24 h. The cells were then lysed with Promega reporter buffer. Luciferase activity in the cell extract was quantified by a 20/20n luminometer (Turnerbiosystem, Sunnyvale, CA), and β-galactosidase activity was measured with o-nitrophenyl-d-galactopyranoside as substrate (46Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). GREBP mRNA overexpression was confirmed by sqRT-PCR with the sense primer 5′-CTTGGTACCGAGCTCGGATC-3′ targeting the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) generated by pCDNA1-Neo-GREBP plasmid and the antisense primer 5′-TTGCGGCCGCTTAGCGTTGTACGGTAGAAC-3′. GREBP-silencing experiments were performed with pSilencer 2.0-U6-shRNA-GREBP and control plasmid pSilencer 2.0-U6-NT. In 6-well plates, HEK293 cells (1.7 × 105 cells/well) were transfected with either 1 μg of NT or shRNA plasmid and allowed to grow for 24 h before lysis. Expression levels were determined by sqRT-PCR with GREBP sense and antisense primers 5′-TCACTTCTGAGTCCCAGAGG-3′ and 5′-GGTAGGAGTAGCGTGGTAAG-3′, whereas NPR1/GCA expression was measured with 5′-ATCCAACTGCGTGGTAGATGGG-3′ and 5′-ATTCGGAAGGAGCGCACAGCAT-3′ as sense and antisense primers. ChIP was performed as described by Weinmann and Farnham (47Weinmann A.S. Farnham P.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 106 HEK293 cells were seeded in a T-75 flask and transfected with peGFP or peGFP-GREBP and allowed to grow for 12 h. Cross-linking was performed by adding 1% (v/v) formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature on a shaker, and the reaction was stopped with 125 mm glycine for 5 min. After washing with ice-cold PBS, cells were allowed to swell for 10 min at 4 °C for nuclei isolation in 5 mm PIPES, pH 8, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Igepal CA-630 (Sigma), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× complete mini (Roche Applied Science) protease inhibitor. After centrifugation, nuclei were resuspended in nucleus lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× complete mini protease inhibitor) and chromatin was fragmented by sonication using the Misonix sonicator 3000 (4 × 15 s pulse at 90 watts). Debris were removed by centrifugation, and supernatant was cleared with protein A-Sepharose 6MB (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted, and their supernatants were diluted in the antibody binding buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors) with 1 μg of normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) catalog no. SC-2027) for the “no antibody” control or with 1 μg of rabbit anti-GFP antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; catalog no. SC-8334) and rocked overnight at 4 °C. Before precipitation, one-tenth of the supernatant was kept aside for the PCR of the “input fraction.” Precipitation of the DNA·protein·antibody complexes was done by centrifugation after the addition of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellets were washed twice with 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2% N-laurylsarcosyl, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then four times in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 500 mm LiCl, 1% deoxycholate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Elution of complexes was obtained by the addition of elution buffer (50 mm NaHCO3, 1% SDS), and cross-link was reversed by incubating the samples for 1 h at 37 °C with RNase A, followed by an overnight digestion with proteinase K at 67 °C. The next morning, samples were purified using the Illustra GFX purification column (GE Healthcare) and eluted in 50 μl of Tris buffer. PCR was performed using 1 μl of purified DNA using the sense primer 5′-GGCCTATCGACCACAATT-3′ and antisense primer 5′-TCATTCTGCTTGGATTGGG-3′, respectively, located at −40 and +78 bp of the cGMP-RE. PCR products were analyzed by 2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. pGEX-3X-GREBP or pGEX-3X was transformed into Rosetta bacterial strain (Novagen, Mississauga, Canada) and grown in Terrific Broth (12 g/liter tryptone, 24 g/liter yeast extract, 0.4% glycerol, 2.31 g/liter KH2PO4, 12.54 g/liter K2HPO4) until 600-nm absorbance reached 0.5; proteins were induced with the addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to the liquid culture for 2 h to produce GST or GST-GREBP proteins. Bacterial extracts were prepared as described by Schimtzer et al. (48Schmitzer A.R. Lépine F. Pelletier J.N. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). 1-ml columns of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) were prepared according to the manufacturer's protocols. Bacterial extracts were applied onto the matrix and washed with 5 volumes of PBS to remove unbound proteins. For Western blot experiments, 30 μl of GST or GST-GREBP resin slurry were electrophoresed and transferred onto nitrocellulose according to a standard procedure. The membrane was blocked overnight in 1× TBS and 5% nonfat milk, and the first antibody (anti-GST, dilution 1:8000, catalog no. SC-459, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was added for 1 h in 1× TBS, 5% nonfat milk, and 0.05% Tween 20 at room temperature and followed by three 10-min washes in 1× TBS and 0.05% Tween 20. We used a goat anti-rabbit (dilution 1:15,000, catalog no. SC-2004, 1× TBS, 5% nonfat milk, 0.05% Tween 20) secondary antibody followed again by three 10-min washes (1× TBS, 0.05% Tween 20). Bound protein content was determined by the Bradford method. For the binding assays, resin was poured into the column, and 5 ml of binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 35 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 10 ng of Klenow 32P-labeled double-stranded rat consensus cGMP-RE (5′-AAAATAGATTTCAACAG-3′) sequence were then added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation, the columns were drained and washed twice with 5 ml of binding buffer to remove excess radioactive probes. After washing, a 250-fold excess of cold probe in 5 ml of binding buffer was added and incubated for 1 h. The columns were then drained, and radioactivity was measured at each step. HEK293 cells were transfected with pCDNA1-Neo-GREBP or control plasmid pCDNA1-Neo. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (39Hum D. Besnard S. Sanchez R. Devost D. Gossard F. Hamet P. Tremblay J. Hypertension. 2004; 43: 1270-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The 18-bp-long consensus double-stranded human (5′-AAATGTACTTCAACATTC-3′), rat (5′-AAATAGATTTCAACAGTT-3′), or mouse (5′-AAATAGACTTCAACAGTT-3′) cGMP-RE probes were 32P-labeled and purified. For probe conformational studies, we used the 24-bp-long cGMP-RE double-stranded sequence previously defined (39Hum D. Besnard S. Sanchez R. Devost D. Gossard F. Hamet P. Tremblay J. Hypertension. 2004; 43: 1270-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Human (H24, 5′-AGGAAATGTACTTCAACATTCTGC-3′), rat (R24, 5′-AGAAAATAGATTTCAACAGTTTGC-3′), mouse (M24, 5′-AGAAAATAGACTTCAACAGTTTGC-3′), and two 24-bp-long mutated probes corresponding to the shared sequence between rat and mouse cGMP-RE with nucleotide changes at position 11 (P1, 5′-AGAAAATAGAATTCAACAGTTTGC-3′; P2, 5′-AGAAAATAGAGTTCAACAGTTTGC-3′). 35,000 cpm of probes and 500 ng of poly(dI-dC) were added to 5 μg of nuclear extracts in a total volume of 18 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 35"
https://openalex.org/W2075905554,"The active site of the tyrosine family site-specific recombinase Flp contains a conserved catalytic pentad that includes two arginine residues, Arg-191 and Arg-308. Both arginines are essential for the transesterification steps of strand cleavage and strand joining in DNA substrates containing a phosphate group at the scissile position. During strand cleavage, the active site tyrosine supplies the nucleophile to form a covalent 3'-phosphotyrosyl intermediate. The 5'-hydroxyl group produced by cleavage provides the nucleophile to re-form a 3'-5' phosphodiester bond in a recombinant DNA strand. In previous work we showed that substitution of the scissile phosphate (P) by the charge neutral methylphosphonate (MeP) makes Arg-308 dispensable during the catalytic activation of the MeP diester bond. However, in the Flp(R308A) reaction, water out-competes the tyrosine nucleophile (Tyr-343) to cause direct hydrolysis of the MeP diester bond. We now report that for MeP activation Arg-191 is also not required. In contrast to Flp(R308A), Flp(R191A) primarily mediates normal cleavage by Tyr-343 but also exhibits a weaker direct hydrolytic activity. The cleaved MeP-tyrosyl intermediate formed by Flp(R191A) can be targeted for nucleophilic attack by a 5'-hydroxyl or water and channeled toward strand joining or hydrolysis, respectively. In collaboration with wild type Flp, Flp(R191A) promotes strand exchange between MeP- and P-DNA partners. Loss of a catalytically crucial positively charged side chain can thus be suppressed by a compensatory modification in the DNA substrate that neutralizes the negative charge on the scissile phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W2016970199,"The kinetics of imidazole (Im) and N-methylimidazole (MeIm) binding to oxidized cytochrome (cyt) c(1) of detergent-solubilized bc(1) complex from Rhodobacter sphaeroides are described. The rate of formation of the cyt c(1)-Im complex exhibited three separated regions of dependence on the concentration of imidazole: (i) below 8 mM Im, the rate increased with concentration in a parabolic manner; (ii) above 20 mM, the rate leveled off, indicating a rate-limiting conformational step with lifetime approximately 1 s; and (iii) at Im concentrations above 100 mM, the rate substantially increased again, also parabolically. In contrast, binding of MeIm followed a simple hyperbolic concentration dependence. The temperature dependences of the binding and release kinetics of Im and MeIm were also measured and revealed very large activation parameters for all reactions. The complex concentration dependence of the Im binding rate is not consistent with the popular model for soluble c-type cytochromes in which exogenous ligand binding is preceded by spontaneous opening of the heme cleft, which becomes rate-limiting at high ligand concentrations. Instead, binding of ligand to the heme is explained by a model in which an initial and superficial binding facilitates access to the heme by disruption of hydrogen-bonded structures in the heme domain. For imidazole, two separate pathways of heme access are indicated by the distinct kinetics at low and high concentration. The structural basis for ligand entry to the heme cleft is discussed."
