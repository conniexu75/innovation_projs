Often this capacity can be attributed to the ability of some bacteria to form and release into their environment proteolytic enzymes (1). However, evidence in recent years indicates that some peptides can penetrate the bacterial membrane (2, 3). Hence, another route for peptide utilization exists in which intracellular enzymes are responsible for the cleavage of the peptide bond. Therefore, for any particular microorganism the array of peptides that can be nutritionally effective depends upon the ability of the microorganisms to form intracellular and extracellular peptidases, their specificity, and the properties of those sites in the bacterial membrane that can admit peptides to the cell interior. Bacterial mutants, lacking the ability to form individual amino acids, provide a facile means to study the nutritional response to various peptides. In these organisms utilization of peptides containing the requisite amino acid provides an easily measured growth response (4). In such organisms, a positive response in the absence of extracellular peptidases indicates that the means exist for transporting the peptide into the cell and hydrolyzing it. The work of Stewart and Stahmann (5) and Sober (6) provided a means of readily obtaining the members of a homologous series of charged peptides. With the p ossibility of an intrinsically more systematic variation of parameters when dealing with a homologous series, it became of interest to test the utilization of such peptides in the above system. The response to oligolysine peptides was examined with an Escherichia coli lysine auxotroph, strain M-26-26 (7) ; to oligoarginine peptides with the arginine-requiring strain 39-A-23 (8) ; and to oligoglutamic peptides with strain M-22-64 (9), which requires glutamic acid. Some modifications of the oligolysine and oligoarginine peptides were carried out by acetylation and the resultant products were tested. It was possible to conclude that in E. coli size and presence of an unsubstituted a-amino group are critical factors in the ability of a peptide to be utilized."

In the past, DL mixtures of amino acids have often been used for transport studies, because of the limited availability of the individual isomers, and because the transport of t.he D isomers was assumed to be negligible. Both of these condit.ions have now been modified. n-Amino acids have been shown to have substantial affinities both for cellular uptake processes (l-3) and for intestinal absorption (4-8). In 1952, Christensen and Riggs (1) found that in the course of an hour or two each of the D isomers of six amino acids was accumulated by the Ehrlich tumor cell to nearly as great an extent as the L form. Scholefield found L-methionine only about 50% more effective than Dmethionine in inhibiting the uptake of glycine by the Ehrlich cell (2). In contrast to these observations, Paine and Heinz (3) found that the D isomers of several amino acids inhibited the uptake of 1.8 mM glycine only about 10% as strongly as did the L isomers. Two amino acids, histidine and phenylalanine, were tested both by Christensen and Riggs and by Paine and Heinz. The present experiments explain the discrepancy between the observations of Christensen and Riggs and those of Paine and Heinz, by showing that the initial uptake of the D isomer is indeed slow but that this slow uptake continues for many hours, eventually attaining distribution ratios not much lower than those reached more quickly by the L isomers. A similar behavior has also been shown for the isomers of tertiary leucine (ol-aminoP,P-dimethylbutyric acid) (9). This result requires, as discussed elsewhere (lo), that the differences in the rates of escape of t’he isomeric pairs must’ be even greater than the differences in their rates of entry. This report compares quantitatively the transport of n-alanine and n-valine into and from the Ehrlich cell with that of their L isomers. These two amino acids were selected to illust.rate each of two transport-mediating systems described for neutral amino acids (11, la), in order to assay independently the stereospecificity of these systems."

The two homozygous strains used (strain 13 and selectively bred Hartley guinea pigs) were distinguished by high and low urinary excretion of hydroxylated derivatives of cortisol (such as 2~ and G/3-hydroxycortisoll and other unidentified steroids). The two strains also exhibited large differences in the rates of production of one of the steroids studied, 2a-hydroxycortisol (determined by an isotope dilution technique (a)), indicating that the differences observed were due to differences in enzymatic hydroxylating activity and not to clearance effects. This paper attempts to correlate the observed differences in vivo with enzymatic activity in vitro. The ability of guinea pig adrenal and liver preparations to hydroxylate cortisol at C-2c~ is demonstrated. In addition, some of the complexities involved in the quantitative determination of enzymatic 2or-hydroxylation activity in adrenal preparations from the two strains are described."
