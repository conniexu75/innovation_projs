https://openalex.org/W1993327789,"Upon stimulation, CD95 (APO-1/Fas) recruits the adapter molecule FADD/MORT1, procaspase-8, and the cellular FLICE-inhibitory proteins (c-FLIP) into the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). According to the induced proximity model, procaspase-8 is activated in the DISC in an autoproteolytic manner by two subsequent cleavage steps. c-FLIP proteins exist as a long (c-FLIPL) and a short (c-FLIPS) splice variant, both of them capable of protecting cells from death receptor-mediated apoptosis. In stably transfected BJAB cells, both c-FLIPS and c-FLIPL block procaspase-8 activation at the DISC. However, cleavage is blocked at different steps. c-FLIPL allows the first cleavage step of procaspase-8, leading to the generation of the p10 subunit. In contrast, c-FLIPS completely inhibits cleavage of procaspase-8. Interestingly, p43-c-FLIPL lacking the p12 subunit also prevents cleavage of procaspase-8. In contrast, a nonprocessable mutant of c-FLIPL allows the first cleavage of procaspase-8. In conclusion, both c-FLIP proteins prevent caspase-8 activation at different levels of procaspase-8 processing at the DISC. Our results indicate that c-FLIPL induces a conformation of procaspase-8 that allows partial but not complete proteolytical processing, whereas in contrast c-FLIPS even prevents partial procaspase-8 activation at the DISC.

Apoptosis plays an important role in tissue homeostasis. In the immune system, apoptosis is used for negative and positive selection of T and B cells in the thymus and bone marrow, respectively, and to maintain immune homeostasis (1Krammer P.H.

The best characterized member of the death receptor subfamily is CD95, also known as APO-1 or Fas. Stimulation of CD95 with its cognate ligand, CD95L, leads to clustering of the monomeric receptor or, as recently suggested, to conformational changes of preformed receptor complexes (3Siegel R.M.

Recruitment of procaspase-8 to the DISC leads to its proteolytic activation through several cleavage steps. Free p18 and p10 subunits form the active caspase-8 heterotetramer. Active caspase-8 then initiates a cascade of caspase activation finally leading to cell death (10Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E.

Viral FLICE-inhibitory proteins (v-FLIP), which are components of the class of γ-herpesviruses, form another family of apoptosis-inhibitory molecules. These molecules are composed of two death effector domains, a structure resembling the N-terminal half of procaspase-8. Via DED-DED-interaction, v-FLIP proteins are recruited to the CD95-DISC, preventing procaspase-8 recruitment and processing and thereby CD95-induced apoptosis (16Thome M. Schneider P. Hofmann K.

Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). On the mRNA level, several c-FLIP splice variants exist. On the protein level, however, only two endogenous forms, c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS, could be detected so far (17Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.L. Schroter M.

However, this domain lacks residues that are important for the catalytic activity of caspase-8, most notably the cysteine within the active site. The short form of c-FLIP, c-FLIPS, structurally resembles v-FLIP. Despite the analysis of mice deficient for c-FLIP, which indicates a role of c-FLIP in cardiac development (26Yeh W.C. Itie A.

Immunity. 2000; 12: 633-642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), the definitive physiological role of this molecule still remains controversial. Recent reports show that high expression of FLIP promotes tumor growth and facilitates immune escape of tumors (27Medema J.P. de Jong J. van Hall T. Melief C.J. Offringa R. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1033-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 28Djerbi M. Screpanti V. Catrina A.I. Bogen B. Biberfeld P. Grandien A. J. Exp.

In addition, mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient of c-FLIP clearly display an increased sensitivity toward death receptor-mediated apoptosis (26Yeh W.C. Itie A. Elia A.J. Ng M. Shu H.B. Wakeham A.

Several reports suggest an involvement of c-FLIP in the modulation of the immune response (17Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.L. Schroter M. Burns K.

Immunol. 2000; 30: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated a potential physiological role for c-FLIPS and found that it is up-regulated upon restimulation of the T cell receptor in primary human T cells. This finding correlates with rescue of these cells from activation-induced cell death (34Kirchhoff S. Müller W.W. Krueger A. Schmitz I. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6293-6300Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition, we demonstrated up-regulation of c-FLIPS after CD3/CD28 costimulation, which might contribute to protection toward activation-induced cell death (35Kirchhoff S. Müller W.W. Li-Weber M. Krammer P.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2765-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The mechanism of c-FLIPL function has only been partly elucidated (25Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1541-1548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Both procaspase-8 and c-FLIPL are recruited to the DISC. After initial cleavage of both molecules, the cleavage intermediates remain bound to the DISC and can no longer be replaced by procaspase-8. This prevents activation of the cytoplasmic procaspase-8 pool and renders the cell resistant to CD95-induced apoptosis (25Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1541-1548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). So far, nothing is known about the mechanism of c-FLIPS function. In a previous study, we found that c-FLIPS, but not c-FLIPL, contributes to rescue from activation-induced cell death in T cells (34Kirchhoff S. Müller W.W. Krueger A. Schmitz I. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6293-6300Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 35Kirchhoff S. Müller W.W. Li-Weber M. Krammer P.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 2765-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Therefore, we further clarify the mechanisms of apoptosis inhibition mediated by c-FLIPS to detect possible differences compared with c-FLIPL action. To investigate this issue, we generated BJAB clones stably expressing c-FLIPS or c-FLIPL or both. Overexpression of either c-FLIPS or c-FLIPL results in resistance toward death receptor-mediated cell death. The two splice variants, however, cause this effect in a distinct fashion. Thus, procaspase-8 activation is inhibited at two different cleavage steps at the DISC by c-FLIPS and c-FLIPL, respectively, the two splice variants of c-FLIP. A detailed analysis of the domains of c-FLIPL revealed that full-length c-FLIPL, but not a mutant lacking the p12 subunit, contributes to the first cleavage step of caspase-8. The B lymphoblastoid cell line BJAB and the T cell line H9 were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.), 10 mm HEPES (Life Technologies), 2 mg/ml Gentamycin (Life Technologies), 10“%” fetal calf serum (Life Technologies) in 5“%” CO2. Monoclonal antibodies against FADD (mouse IgG1) and the FLAG epitope (MDYKDDDDK, clone M2, mouse IgG1) were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and Sigma, respectively. The C15 monoclonal antibody (mouse IgG2b) recognizes the p18 subunit of caspase-8 (36Scaffidi C. Medema J.P. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol.

Klas C. Peters A.M. Matzku S. Moller P. Falk W. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Science. 1989; 245: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1668) Google Scholar). The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 and IgG2b were from Southern Biotechnology Associates (Birmingham, AL). Leucine zipper (LZ)-TRAIL and LZ-CD95L were produced as described (38Walczak H. Miller R.E. Ariail K. Gliniak B. Griffith T.S. Kubin M. Chin W. Jones J. Woodward A. Le T. Smith C. Smolak P. Goodwin R.G. Rauch C.T. Schuh J.C. Lynch D.H. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (2236) Google Scholar). TNFα was purchased from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). All other chemicals used were of analytical grade and purchased from Merck or Sigma. The coding sequence of c-FLIPS was isolated after total RNA isolation of H9 cells, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and subsequent polymerase chain reaction, using the following primer pair: c-FLIP sense, 5′-ggcgaattcATGcccgggTCTGCTGAAGTCATCCATCCAGG-3′; c-FLIPSantisense, 5′-cgtctagaTCACATGGAACAACAATTTCCAAG-3′. The sequences shown in capital letters are homologous to the coding sequence of c-FLIPS. The isolated polymerase chain reaction fragment was cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen); the correct sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression vectors coding for epitope-tagged proteins were cloned by ligating double-stranded oligonucleotides comprising the sequences of the FLAG epitope (pcDNA3-FLAG) or the Myc epitope (pcDNA3-Myc), respectively, into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). FLAG-c-FLIPS and Myc-c-FLIPS expression constructs were generated by ligating the coding sequence of c-FLIPS in frame into pcDNA3-FLAG or pcDNA3-Myc, respectively. The FLAG-p43mu expression construct coding for amino acids 1–376 of c-FLIPL was generated by standard polymerase chain reaction and cloning techniques using the following primers: 5′-ggcgaattcATGcccgggTCTGCTGAAGTCATCCATCCAGG-3′ and 5′-gattctagaTCAATCCACCTCCAAGAGGCTGCTGTCC-3′. The FLAG-D376N expression construct was generated using the primer 5′-CTTGGAGGTGAATGGGCCAGCGATG-3′ and the corresponding complementary primer applied in the QuikChange Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Stable transfection of BJAB cells was performed with expression vectors coding c-FLIPS C-terminally fused to the FLAG or Myc epitope tag (pcDNA3-FLAG-c-FLIPS, pcDNA3-Myc-c-FLIPS), FLAG epitope-tagged c-FLIPL (pEFrsFLAG-FLIPL) (25Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1541-1548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar), or the respective empty vectors (control) by electroporation (960 microfarads, 200 V). Selection pressure was added 48 h after transfection (4000 “μ”g/ml G418 and/or 1 “μ”g/ml puromycin; Sigma), and high expressing clones were identified by Western blot analysis using NF6 monoclonal antibody. The composition of the CD95 DISC was determined as follows. 5 × 107 cells (if not otherwise indicated) were either treated with 10 “μ”g of LZ-CD95L-containing supernatant for 5 min at 37 °C and then lysed in lysis buffer (30 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, small peptide inhibitors (Sigma), 1“%” Triton X-100 (Serva), and 10“%” glycerol) (stimulated condition) or lysed without treatment (unstimulated condition). The CD95 DISC was then precipitated for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C with 2 “μ”g of anti-APO-1 coupled to protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) or 2 “μ”g of anti-FLAG (M2) coupled to protein G-agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After immunoprecipitation, the beads were washed four times with 20 volumes of lysis buffer. For Western blotting, immunoprecipitates or cytosolic proteins equivalent to 106 cells or 20 “μ”g of protein were separated by 12“%” SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Hybond nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), blocked with 5“%” nonfat dry milk in PBS/Tween (PBS plus 0.05“%” Tween 20) for at least 1.5 h, washed with PBS/Tween, and incubated with the primary antibody in PBS/Tween for 16 h at 4 °C. Blots were developed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted 1:20,000 in PBS/Tween. After washing with PBS/Tween, the blots were developed with a chemiluminescence method following the manufacturer's protocol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For assaying apoptosis, 5 × 105 cells were incubated in 24-well plates with or without the indicated amounts of anti-APO-1 plus 10 ng/ml protein A, LZ-TRAIL, LZ-CD95L, or TNFα plus 10 “μ”g/ml cycloheximide in medium for 16 h at 37 °C. Cells were centrifuged briefly in a minifuge (Heraeus) at 4000 rpm for 5 min, washed once with PBS, and resuspended in a buffer containing 0.1“%” (w/v) sodium citrate, 0.1“%” (v/v) Triton X-100, and 50 “μ”g/ml propidium iodide (Sigma). After incubation at 4 °C in the dark for at least 16 h, apoptotic nuclei were quantified by FACScan (Becton Dickinson). Specific apoptosis was calculated as follows: (“%” experimental apoptosis - “%” spontaneous apoptosis)/(100 − “%” spontaneous apoptosis) × 100. Recently, c-FLIPS and c-FLIPL were described as inhibitors of death receptor-mediated apoptosis (17Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.L. Schroter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. Rimoldi D. French L.E. Tschopp J. Nature. 1997; 388: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2231) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms of c-FLIP action remained largely elusive. To study the mechanisms of apoptosis inhibition mediated by c-FLIPS and c-FLIPL in detail, we generated BJAB cells stably transfected with expression constructs coding either for N-terminally FLAG-tagged c-FLIPS, N-terminally Myc-tagged c-FLIPS, or N-terminally FLAG-tagged c-FLIPL alone or in combination with Myc-tagged-c-FLIPS (FL/MS) (see Fig. 1 A for expression constructs). BJAB cell clones expressing low, intermediate or high amounts of FLAG-tagged c-FLIPS were identified by Western blotting (Fig. 1 B, left) as well as clones expressing high concentrations of FLAG-tagged-c-FLIPL or Myc-tagged c-FLIPS alone or in combination (FL/MS; Fig. 1 B, right). To exclude clonal effects due to different death receptor expression, we determined cell surface expression of TRAILR1, TRAILR2, TRAILR3, TRAILR4, TNFR1, and CD95. We also determined expression of procaspase-8 and FADD. The expression patterns of these proteins were comparable (data not shown). To analyze the antiapoptotic function of the transfected c-FLIP proteins, we investigated the sensitivity of these BJAB cell clones toward death receptor-mediated apoptosis. Overexpression of c-FLIPS resulted in cells resistant toward CD95-mediated apoptosis, induced by LZ-CD95L, as well as resistance toward TNFα- and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Resistance directly correlated with the amounts of c-FLIPS (Fig.1 C). However, the cells were still sensitive toward staurosporine-induced apoptosis (data not shown (17Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.L. Schroter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. Rimoldi D. French L.E. Tschopp J. Nature. 1997; 388: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2231) Google Scholar)). Overexpression of c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS simultaneously resulted in increased inhibition toward CD95-mediated apoptosis in an additive manner as compared with cells expressing c-FLIPL or c-FLIPS alone (Fig. 1 D). TRAIL- and TNFα-mediated apoptosis were completely inhibited. We conclude from these results that the CD95 DISC was not saturated with c-FLIP proteins in the single transfected cells, and therefore an additive effect in cells expressing both c-FLIP proteins was observed. In contrast, c-FLIP expression levels in the single transfected BJAB cells were sufficient for blocking of TRAIL- and TNFα-mediated apoptosis in BJAB cells, which might be due to lower expression levels of receptors for TRAIL and TNFα as compared with CD95. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of c-FLIPS-mediated apoptosis inhibition, we determined activation of procaspase-8 as one of the first detectable events upon CD95 triggering. In vector-transfected cells, procaspase-8 was completely processed, and the p10 and p18 active subunits were detectable after 10–30 min (Fig.2 B, lane 3; for the procaspase-8 cleavage pattern, also compare Fig.2 A). In contrast, the generation of active subunits was completely inhibited in cells overexpressing c-FLIPS. Neither the p18 nor the p10 subunits were detectable, and uncleaved procaspase-8 was detectable over a period of up to 3 h (Fig.2 B, lane 18). In cells expressing c-FLIPL, the generation of the p18 subunit was blocked, and only small amounts of the p10 subunit of procaspase-8 were generated (Fig. 2 B, lanes 7–12). In the latter case, c-FLIPL only allowed the p43/41 cleavage product of caspase-8 to be generated. The p43/41 cleavage product stays at the DISC, thereby preventing recruitment and activation of cytosolic procaspase-8. Similar to procaspase-8, c-FLIPL is also cleaved at the DISC by either procaspase-8 or its p43/41 cleavage product (Fig. 2 B, lanes 8–12). Thus, both c-FLIP proteins block the generation of active caspase-8. Our results suggest that c-FLIPS completely prevents procaspase-8 cleavage, whereas c-FLIPL allows the first cleavage step of procaspase-8. Since both procaspase-8 and c-FLIPS are recruited into the DISC (25Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1541-1548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar), we assumed that in the presence of c-FLIPSprocaspase-8 cleavage is blocked at the DISC or that its recruitment is completely inhibited. Therefore, we performed a DISC analysis by immunoprecipitation of either CD95-unstimulated or -stimulated BJAB cells that were either transfected with c-FLIP or vector alone, and we determined DISC-associated caspase-8 cleavage products by Western blot analysis. In cells overexpressing c-FLIPS, only unprocessed procaspase-8 was detectable in the DISC (Fig.3, lane 6). In addition, cleavage of c-FLIPL was also significantly reduced (Fig. 3, lane 6). That was also found in cellular lysates (compare Fig. 2 B). In contrast, the presence of c-FLIPL did not prevent the generation of the p43/41 cleavage product of caspase-8. This finding explains the detection of the p10 caspase-8 subunit in cellular lysates. FADD recruitment to the DISC was not modulated in the presence of c-FLIPL or c-FLIPS. In summary, c-FLIPS blocks cleavage of procaspase-8 at the DISC, whereas c-FLIPL prevents further processing of the p43/41 cleavage product. The fact that the p43 cleavage form of c-FLIPL is the predominant form at the DISC upon CD95 triggering (see Ref. 25Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1541-1548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar and Fig. 3), suggested that cleavage of c-FLIPL is important for blocking caspase-8 activation. To analyze the mechanism of procaspase-8 cleavage inhibition by c-FLIPL in more detail, we generated expression constructs coding for N-terminally FLAG-tagged mutants of c-FLIPLwhich either resemble the p43 cleavage form lacking the p12 subunit of c-FLIPL entirely (FLAG-p43mu) or contain a defective cleavage site (FLAG-D376N) (20Shu H.-B. Halpin D.R. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1997; 6: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) (compare Fig.4 A and scheme in Fig. 6). BJAB cells stably transfected with these expression constructs or empty vector were identified by Western blotting (Fig. 4 B), and the sensitivity toward CD95-mediated apoptosis was investigated. Overexpression of either FLAG-tagged p43-c-FLIPL(p43mu) or FLAG-tagged unprocessable c-FLIPL(D376N) resulted in cells resistant toward LZ-CD95L-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4 C). Therefore, both the full-length and the p43 cleavage form of c-FLIPL act in an antiapoptotic manner and block CD95-mediated apoptosis. Thus, cleavage of c-FLIPL is not required for its antiapoptotic function.Figure 6Model for c-FLIP mediated inhibition of procaspase-8 processing at the DISC. A, triggering of CD95 leads to the recruitment of FADD, procaspase-8, and c-FLIP proteins into the DISC. Binding of procaspase-8 results in its activation by auto- and transproteolytic cleavage. The remaining caspase-8 prodomain is replaced by uncleaved procaspase-8, which is processed in the same manner as described above. B–F, depending on the ratio of procaspase-8 and c-FLIP proteins at the DISC (gray box), different products are released from the DISC upon receptor triggering. B, low amounts of c-FLIP proteins allow processing of procaspase-8, leading to formation of the active caspase-8 heterotetramer composed of the p18 and p10 subunits.C, in the presence of high amounts of c-FLIPL, procaspase-8 is recruited into the DISC, and cleavage is blocked after the generation of the p43 cleavage products of both caspase-8 and c-FLIPL. D, in the presence of high amounts of c-FLIPS, procaspase-8 is recruited into the DISC but remains unprocessed. In each case, modulation of caspase-8 cleavage renders cells resistant to CD95-mediated cell death. E, high amounts of truncated c-FLIPL-p43mu prevent procaspase-8 processing completely. F, expression of unprocessable c-FLIPL-D376N allows initial cleavage of procaspase-8 but prevents further processing, leading to accumulation of p43/41-caspase-8 in the DISC.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the step in apoptosis signaling at which the mutated c-FLIPL molecules inhibit cleavage of procaspase-8, we looked for cleavage products after CD95 triggering. In vector (control)-transfected cells, procaspase-8 was completely processed, and the p10 and p18 active subunits were detectable (Fig. 4 D,lanes 1–6). In cells transfected with an expression construct coding for the FLAG-tagged p43 cleavage product of c-FLIPL (p43mu), the generation of the p10 subunit was delayed and not detectable after 10 min (Fig.4 D, lane 4). In contrast, in cells overexpressing FLAG-tagged uncleavable c-FLIPL (D376N), procaspase-8 was cleaved into its p43/41 and p10 subunits within the first 10 min of stimulation (Fig. 4 D, comparelanes 8 and 14). The p18 subunit was not generated in the presence of both c-FLIPLmutants (Fig. 4 D). Thus, blocking of procaspase-8 cleavage by p43mu and the D376N mutant occurred at different steps. To study this phenomenon in more detail, we performed DISC analysis of vector- or c-FLIP mutant-transfected BJAB cells and tested for associated caspase-8 cleavage products by Western blot analysis. In vector-transfected cells, both the full-length caspase-8 and the p43/p41-caspase-8 form were detectable in the DISC. In contrast, in D376N-expressing cells, only the p43/41 cleavage products of caspase-8 could be detected, thus resembling the composition of the DISC in the presence of high amounts of wild-type c-FLIPL. The presence of p43mu inhibited the generation of the active caspase-8 subunits, which explains our findings presented in Fig. 4 Dand resembles the DISC in c-FLIPS high expressing cells. These results indicate that the presence of full-length c-FLIPL but not cleavage of c-FLIPL is necessary for the initial cleavage of procaspase-8 in the presence of high amounts of c-FLIPL. Since high expression of either c-FLIPL or c-FLIPS blocks procaspase-8 processing at different cleavage steps, we asked whether the presence of either c-FLIPL or c-FLIPS in one DISC would exclude the respective other splice variant from recruitment. Therefore, we precipitated FLAG-tagged c-FLIPL in LZ-CD95L-triggered BJAB cells to isolate the DISCs containing FLAG-tagged c-FLIPLand looked for recruitment of Myc-tagged c-FLIPS to the DISC. Precipitation of the DISC upon CD95 triggering via FLAG-tagged c-FLIPL resulted in coimmunoprecipitation of Myc-tagged c-FLIPS in the double-transfected cells (Fig.5, lane 6). In addition, we isolated the DISC via precipitation of CD95 in the double-transfected BJAB cells as described above (Fig. 5,lanes 3 and 4). Both c-FLIPL and c-FLIPS were detected in the DISC, and FADD recruitment was not impaired when compared with DISC formation in the vector-transfected cells. These results suggest that upon CD95 triggering, c-FLIPS and c-FLIPL can coexist in the same DISC. However, in view of the techniques used, our data do not exclude DISC species containing only one form of c-FLIP. The apoptosis-inducing signal transduction pathways of the CD95 system have been well characterized (39Schmitz I. Kirchhoff S. Krammer P.H. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 1123-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In contrast, much less is known about mechanisms of inhibition of CD95-mediated apoptosis. One protein that has an inhibitory function on the DISC by reducing the generation of active caspase-8 is c-FLIPL. However, its mechanism of inhibition is not well understood. A second cellular splice variant of c-FLIP, c-FLIPS, also has antiapoptotic effects. Both c-FLIP proteins contain two DEDs and are recruited into the DISC and thereby block death receptor-mediated apoptosis. In this report, we provide important insight into the molecular mechanisms of c-FLIP-mediated apoptosis inhibition. BJAB cells that express high amounts of either c-FLIPL or c-FLIPS are protected against death receptor-mediated apoptosis. The presence of c-FLIPS prevents the initial cleavage step of procaspase-8, and therefore, its full-length form can be detected at the DISC. In contrast, c-FLIPL allows the initial cleavage step but blocks further processing and thus the generation of the p18 subunit. The difference in processing of procaspase-8 in the presence of the two c-FLIP splice variants is also reflected in cell lysates and sheds new light on caspase-8 activation at the DISC. From these results, we suggest the following model of c-FLIP proteins mediated inhibition of death receptor initiated apoptosis. In the presence of low concentrations of c-FLIP proteins, procaspase-8 represents the majority of tandem DED-containing proteins at the DISC and is activated by trans- and autocatalytical cleavage due to the close proximity of several procaspase-8 molecules (Fig.6 B; Ref 40Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2926-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). c-FLIPL that is recruited into the DISC is cleaved by caspase-8. High amounts of c-FLIPL in the DISC abolish the close proximity of procaspase-8 molecules, instead leading to proximity of c-FLIPL and procaspase-8, resulting in the first but not the second step of procaspase-8 processing. In this conformation, only the p10 subunit of caspase-8 and the p12 subunit of c-FLIPLare generated (Fig. 6 C). Since c-FLIPL itself has no intrinsic catalytic activity, the generation of the p10 subunit of caspase-8 proceeds autocatalytically, whereas the generation of the p18 subunit would require transcatalytical actvity (Fig.6 C). High amounts of c-FLIPS in the DISC totally prevent procaspase-8 cleavage (Fig. 6 D). This indicates that c-FLIPL, in contrast to c-FLIPS, still induces a conformation of the DISC that leads to autocatalytic activity of procaspase-8 and the first cleavage step. This hypothesis is supported by the cleavage pattern of procaspase-8 in the presence of c-FLIPL mutants. The uncleavable c-FLIPLmutant, like the wild-type c-FLIPL, allows the generation of the p10 subunit of caspase-8. Therefore the full-length protein of c-FLIPL, but not its cleavage, facilitates the first cleavage step of procaspase-8 (Fig. 6 F). Our results are further supported by the observation that the deletion mutant of c-FLIPL that does not contain the p12 subunit (p43mu) prevents the first cleavage step of procaspase-8, similar to c-FLIPS (Fig. 6 E). Both the p43 cleavage product of c-FLIPL and the uncleaved form block caspase-8 activation and, therefore, inhibit apoptosis. Given that procaspase-8 interacts with c-FLIP proteins in the DISC in a dimeric manner, our results suggest that the generation of the p10 subunit of caspase-8 occurs autocatalytically. In contrast, the second cleavage step leading to release of the p18 subunit requires transcatalytic activity. However, our results do not exclude interactions of dimers with dimers due to the multimeric nature of death receptor complexes. High expression of c-FLIPS also prevents cleavage of c-FLIPL at the DISC. This phenomenon was also detected in restimulated primary T cells (34Kirchhoff S. Müller W.W. Krueger A. Schmitz I. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6293-6300Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It may be due to spatial interference of c-FLIPS with the interaction of procaspase-8 and c-FLIPL. Another possibility is that initial cleavage of procaspase-8, blocked by c-FLIPS, is required for its transcatalytic activity and, thus, c-FLIPLis not cleaved at the DISC upon high expression of c-FLIPS. Transfectants expressing FLAG-tagged c-FLIPL and Myc-tagged c-FLIPS showed an additive effect with respect to protection against CD95-mediated apoptosis. This indicates that DISCs in single transfectants are not saturated for c-FLIP binding. In addition, p43/41-caspase-8 could be detected in the DISC, which was not the case in c-FLIPS single transfectants. This could be explained by either a dominant function of c-FLIPL over c-FLIPS or, alternatively, by caspase-8 cleavage in DISC species containing c-FLIPL alone. Since both c-FLIP splice variants act as antiapoptotic proteins, the question arises why certain physiological stimuli exclusively induce either c-FLIPL or c-FLIPS, like BCR/CD40 (32Hennino A. Berard M. Casamayor-Palleja M. Krammer P.H. Defrance T. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3023-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,33Wang J. Lobito A.A. Shen F. Hornung F. Winoto A. Lenardo M.J. Eur.

Immunol. 2000; 30: 2765-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), respectively. Therefore, the biological function of different procaspase-8 cleavage patterns remains to be elucidated. Since c-FLIPS totally prevents cleavage of both caspase-8 and c-FLIPL, one might speculate that the generation of these cleavage products is blocked because they are necessary for the recruitment of yet to be identified molecules into the DISC or, alternatively, they prevent the association of unidentified molecules. Recently, it was reported that certain, but not all, viral and cellular FLIP proteins enhance activation of the NF-κB and AP-1 pathways upon stimulation of death receptors, possibly via recruitment of RIP, TRAF1, and TRAF2 into the DISC (41Chaudhary P.M.

However, one study also shows suppressive effects of DED-containing proteins, such as c-FLIP, on the NF-κB pathway (44Wajant H. Haas E. Schwenzer R. Muhlenbeck F. Kreuz S. Schubert G. Grell M.

Although β-arrestins dissociate from some receptors at the plasma membrane, such as the β2 adrenergic receptor, they remain associated with other GPCRs and internalize with them into endocytic vesicles. Formation of stable receptor-β-arrestin complexes that persist inside the cell impedes receptor resensitization, and the aberrant formation of these complexes may play a role in GPCR-based diseases (Barak, L.

Here, we investigate the molecular determinants responsible for sustained receptor/β-arrestin interactions. We show in real time and in live human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells that a β-arrestin-2-green fluorescent protein conjugate internalizes into endocytic vesicles with agonist-activated neurotensin-1 receptor, oxytocin receptor, angiotensin II type 1A receptor, and substance P receptor. Using receptor mutagenesis, we demonstrate that the ability of β-arrestin to remain associated with these receptors is mediated by specific clusters of serine and threonine residues located in the receptor carboxyl-terminal tail. These clusters are remarkably conserved in their position within the carboxyl-terminal domain and serve as primary sites of agonist-dependent receptor phosphorylation. In addition, we identify a β-arrestin mutant with enhanced affinity for the agonist-activated β2-adrenergic receptor that traffics into endocytic vesicles with receptors that lack serine/threonine clusters and normally dissociate from wild-type β-arrestin at the plasma membrane. By identifying receptor and β-arrestin residues critical for the formation of stable receptor-β-arrestin complexes, these studies provide novel targets for regulating GPCR responsiveness and treating diseases resulting from abnormal GPCR/β-arrestin interactions. β-Arrestins bind agonist-activated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and mediate their desensitization and internalization.

However, the fate of these receptor-β-arrestin complexes differs markedly among receptors (14Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol.

In contrast, β-arrestins remain associated with other receptors, such as the vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R), and traffic with them into endocytic vesicles. The stability of the receptor-β-arrestin complex appears to regulate the rate of receptor resensitization (14Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Receptors that dissociate from β-arrestin at or near the plasma membrane are rapidly dephosphorylated and recycled, whereas receptors that remain associated with β-arrestin are slowly dephosphorylated and recycled.The ability of the V2R to form a stable complex with β-arrestin is mediated by a specific cluster of GRK -phosphorylated serine residues in the receptor carboxyl-terminal tail (14Oakley R.H.

Whether a similar motif is necessary for other GPCRs to remain associated with β-arrestin is unknown. Identifying such residues is a critical goal of current research not only because the strength of the receptor/β-arrestin interaction controls GPCR responsiveness but also because the inappropriate formation of these complexes may underlie the pathology of several GPCR-based diseases. For example, a nonsignaling V2R mutant associated with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is complexed with β-arrestin in endocytic vesicles in the absence of agonist (17Barak L.S. Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The normal plasma membrane localization and the ability of this constitutively desensitized receptor to signal can be restored by eliminating the cluster of serine residues that promotes the high affinity V2R/β-arrestin interaction (17Barak L.S.

We demonstrate in real time and in live cells that the ability of β-arrestin to remain associated with a variety of GPCRs is mediated by specific clusters of phosphorylated serine and threonine residues strategically positioned within the receptor carboxyl-terminal tail. The requirement for these phosphorylated serine/threonine clusters can be bypassed, however, by mutations in β-arrestin that enhance its affinity for agonist-activated GPCRs. Identification of the molecular determinants underlying the formation of stable receptor-β-arrestin complexes provides novel targets for manipulating the affinity of these two proteins and regulating GPCR responsiveness.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we identify a conserved motif in the carboxyl-terminal tail of GPCRs that mediates the agonist-dependent formation of stable receptor-β-arrestin complexes that persist inside the cell after GPCR internalization. This motif consists of serine and threonine residues that are clustered together within the receptor carboxyl-terminal tail and serve as primary sites of agonist-dependent receptor phosphorylation. In the absence of this motif, the receptor/β-arrestin interaction is less stable, and the agonist-occupied receptors dissociate from β-arrestin at or near the plasma membrane. We also identify a mutation in β-arrestin that allows it to form stable complexes with agonist-activated GPCRs that lack serine/threonine clusters. These studies, by identifying receptor and β-arrestin residues critical for the formation of high affinity receptor-β-arrestin complexes, provide novel targets for regulating GPCR responsiveness and treating diseases resulting from abnormal GPCR/β-arrestin interactions.The serine/threonine clusters mediating the formation of stable receptor-β-arrestin complexes show a significant degree of conservation in their relative position within the receptor carboxyl-terminal tail. For example, the clusters are 36, 45, 38/47, 25/32, and 50 amino acids downstream of the NPXXY motif for the V2R, NTR-1, OTR, AT1AR, and SPR, respectively (Fig. 3). For the subgroup of receptors with carboxyl-terminal tails of similar length and containing putative sites of palmitoylation (V2R, NTR-1, and OTR), the conservation of the cluster location is even more remarkable. The serine/threonine clusters are 36, 45, and 38/47 amino acids downstream of the NPXXY motif; 19, 26, and 20/29 amino acids downstream of the putative sites of palmitoylation; and 7, 7 and 10/19 amino acids upstream from the end of the carboxyl-terminal tail (Fig.3 A). Because the cluster motif is essentially absent from the carboxyl-terminal tails of GPCRs that form unstable complexes with β-arrestin (Fig. 10 A), it should be possible to predict whether a given receptor will bind β-arrestin with low or high affinity by simply analyzing the amino acid sequence of the receptor carboxyl-terminal tail. This in turn will provide valuable information as to how the cellular complement of arrestin isoforms might regulate the pattern of receptor desensitization, sequestration, and resensitization (16Oakley R.H.

This is followed by the binding of a smaller, positively charged region in the central portion of β-arrestin, termed the phosphorylation recognition domain, to the GRK-phosphorylated receptor carboxyl-terminal tail (34Kieselbach T. Irrgang K.D. Ruppel H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of a cluster of serine and threonine residues would produce a localized concentration of negative charges, and the ionic interaction between the cluster of negative charges in the receptor carboxyl-terminal tail and the cluster of positive charges in the phosphorylation recognition domain of β-arrestin might be sufficient to stabilize the receptor-β-arrestin complex. Alternatively, engagement of the phosphorylated serine/threonine cluster may induce a conformational change in β-arrestin that allows a subsequent high affinity interaction between the receptor and β-arrestin to take place (35Vishnivetskiy S.A.

In favor of the latter model is our finding that the β-arrestin-1–383T truncation mutant remains associated with GPCRs lacking serine/threonine clusters. Removal of the β-arrestin-1 carboxyl terminus may constitutively expose the high affinity receptor binding site and allow the mutant β-arrestin to bind GPCRs in the absence of phosphorylation (30Kovoor A.

For example, the ability of β-arrestin to remain associated with the V2R impairs the efficient recycling of this receptor back to the plasma membrane (14Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). In agreement with these findings, we show that the NTR-1 and SPR form stable complexes with β-arrestin, and both these receptors have been reported to recycle poorly (36Botto J.M. Chabry J. Sarret P.

However, the stability of the receptor-β-arrestin complex may also be involved in initiating and/or regulating other signaling pathways. Recent studies have demonstrated that β-arrestin-bound internalized receptors are important for GPCR-mediated activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. β-Arrestin appears to function as a molecular scaffold that organizes and recruits components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade after binding the agonist-activated GPCR (44Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). For example, stimulation of the AT1AR activates the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase 3 (JNK3), which colocalizes with the receptor and β-arrestin in endocytic vesicles (38McDonald P.H. Chow C.W. Miller W.E. Laporte S.A. Field M.E. Lin F.T. Davis R.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) by the proteinase-activated receptor 2 requires the association of receptor, β-arrestin, and ERK1/2 in endocytic vesicles (39DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1267-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Proteinase-activated receptor 2 has been reported to form stable complexes with β-arrestin that persist inside the cell (39DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J.

For both the AT1AR and proteinase-activated receptor 2, the prolonged association between receptor, β-arrestin, and mitogen-activated protein kinase may ensure the proper localization, specificity, and/or duration of the mitogen-activated protein kinase response.In summary, we have identified a motif in the carboxyl-terminal tail of GPCRs that promotes the formation of stable receptor-β-arrestin complexes. In addition, we have shown that similar stable receptor-β-arrestin complexes can be achieved with GPCRs lacking this motif by mutations in β-arrestin that enhance its affinity for receptors. Understanding the molecular determinants underlying high affinity GPCR/β-arrestin interactions may be useful in a variety of pathophysiological conditions. For example, reducing the affinity of the receptor-β-arrestin complex may restore signaling to nonfunctional V2R mutants that are constitutively bound to β-arrestin and responsible for some forms of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (17Barak L.S. Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Alternatively, increasing the affinity of the receptor/β-arrestin interaction may be an effective treatment for certain forms of hyperthyroidism and familial precocious puberty that result from constitutively active GPCRs (41Parma J.

Finally, modulating the stability of GPCR·β-arrestin complexes may enhance the efficacy of GPCR-acting drugs by altering the kinetics of receptor desensitization and/or resensitization (43Bohn L.M.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 comprise a large gene family of more than 1000 members that regulate a diverse array of physiological functions such as phototransduction, olfaction, neurotransmission, vascular tone, cardiac output, digestion, and pain. The signaling of GPCRs is intimately controlled by a family of intracellular proteins termed arrestins that includes visual arrestin, β-arrestin-1, and β-arrestin-2 (1Ferguson S.S. Barak L.S.

Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Arrestins bind agonist-activated GPCRs at the plasma membrane that have been phosphorylated by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) on serine and threonine residues located in the third intracellular loop or carboxyl-terminal tail (3Lohse M.J.

The association of β-arrestins with agonist-activated receptors at the plasma membrane is a feature common to almost all GPCRs (15Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol.

However, the fate of these receptor-β-arrestin complexes differs markedly among receptors (14Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 16Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol.

In contrast, β-arrestins remain associated with other receptors, such as the vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R), and traffic with them into endocytic vesicles. The stability of the receptor-β-arrestin complex appears to regulate the rate of receptor resensitization (14Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Receptors that dissociate from β-arrestin at or near the plasma membrane are rapidly dephosphorylated and recycled, whereas receptors that remain associated with β-arrestin are slowly dephosphorylated and recycled. The ability of the V2R to form a stable complex with β-arrestin is mediated by a specific cluster of GRK -phosphorylated serine residues in the receptor carboxyl-terminal tail (14Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Whether a similar motif is necessary for other GPCRs to remain associated with β-arrestin is unknown. Identifying such residues is a critical goal of current research not only because the strength of the receptor/β-arrestin interaction controls GPCR responsiveness but also because the inappropriate formation of these complexes may underlie the pathology of several GPCR-based diseases. For example, a nonsignaling V2R mutant associated with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus is complexed with β-arrestin in endocytic vesicles in the absence of agonist (17Barak L.S. Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The normal plasma membrane localization and the ability of this constitutively desensitized receptor to signal can be restored by eliminating the cluster of serine residues that promotes the high affinity V2R/β-arrestin interaction (17Barak L.S. Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Moreover, several recent studies report that the continued association between rhodopsin and visual arrestin may underlie some forms of retinal degeneration (18Li T. Franson W.K. Gordon J.W.

For example, stimulation of the AT1AR activates the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase 3 (JNK3), which colocalizes with the receptor and β-arrestin in endocytic vesicles (38McDonald P.H. Chow C.W. Miller W.E. Laporte S.A. Field M.E. Lin F.T. Davis R.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2000; 290: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) by the proteinase-activated receptor 2 requires the association of receptor, β-arrestin, and ERK1/2 in endocytic vesicles (39DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1267-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Proteinase-activated receptor 2 has been reported to form stable complexes with β-arrestin that persist inside the cell (39DeFea K.A. Zalevsky J. Thoma M.S. Dery O. Mullins R.D. Bunnett N.W. J.

For both the AT1AR and proteinase-activated receptor 2, the prolonged association between receptor, β-arrestin, and mitogen-activated protein kinase may ensure the proper localization, specificity, and/or duration of the mitogen-activated protein kinase response.In summary, we have identified a motif in the carboxyl-terminal tail of GPCRs that promotes the formation of stable receptor-β-arrestin complexes. In addition, we have shown that similar stable receptor-β-arrestin complexes can be achieved with GPCRs lacking this motif by mutations in β-arrestin that enhance its affinity for receptors. Understanding the molecular determinants underlying high affinity GPCR/β-arrestin interactions may be useful in a variety of pathophysiological conditions. For example, reducing the affinity of the receptor-β-arrestin complex may restore signaling to nonfunctional V2R mutants that are constitutively bound to β-arrestin and responsible for some forms of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (17Barak L.S. Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Alternatively, increasing the affinity of the receptor/β-arrestin interaction may be an effective treatment for certain forms of hyperthyroidism and familial precocious puberty that result from constitutively active GPCRs (41Parma J. Duprez L. Van Sande J. Cochaux P. Gervy C. Mockel J. Dumont J. Vassart G. Nature. 1993; 365: 649-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 42Shenker A. Laue L. Kosugi S. Merendino Jr., J.J. Minegishi T. Cutler Jr., G.B. Nature. 1993; 365: 652-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Finally, modulating the stability of GPCR·β-arrestin complexes may enhance the efficacy of GPCR-acting drugs by altering the kinetics of receptor desensitization and/or resensitization (43Bohn L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Gainetdinov R.R. Peppel K. Caron M.G. Lin F.T. Science. 1999; 286: 2495-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identify a conserved motif in the carboxyl-terminal tail of GPCRs that mediates the agonist-dependent formation of stable receptor-β-arrestin complexes that persist inside the cell after GPCR internalization. This motif consists of serine and threonine residues that are clustered together within the receptor carboxyl-terminal tail and serve as primary sites of agonist-dependent receptor phosphorylation. In the absence of this motif, the receptor/β-arrestin interaction is less stable, and the agonist-occupied receptors dissociate from β-arrestin at or near the plasma membrane. We also identify a mutation in β-arrestin that allows it to form stable complexes with agonist-activated GPCRs that lack serine/threonine clusters. These studies, by identifying receptor and β-arrestin residues critical for the formation of high affinity receptor-β-arrestin complexes, provide novel targets for regulating GPCR responsiveness and treating diseases resulting from abnormal GPCR/β-arrestin interactions. The serine/threonine clusters mediating the formation of stable receptor-β-arrestin complexes show a significant degree of conservation in their relative position within the receptor carboxyl-terminal tail. For example, the clusters are 36, 45, 38/47, 25/32, and 50 amino acids downstream of the NPXXY motif for the V2R, NTR-1, OTR, AT1AR, and SPR, respectively (Fig. 3). For the subgroup of receptors with carboxyl-terminal tails of similar length and containing putative sites of palmitoylation (V2R, NTR-1, and OTR), the conservation of the cluster location is even more remarkable. The serine/threonine clusters are 36, 45, and 38/47 amino acids downstream of the NPXXY motif; 19, 26, and 20/29 amino acids downstream of the putative sites of palmitoylation; and 7, 7 and 10/19 amino acids upstream from the end of the carboxyl-terminal tail (Fig.3 A). Because the cluster motif is essentially absent from the carboxyl-terminal tails of GPCRs that form unstable complexes with β-arrestin (Fig. 10 A), it should be possible to predict whether a given receptor will bind β-arrestin with low or high affinity by simply analyzing the amino acid sequence of the receptor carboxyl-terminal tail. This in turn will provide valuable information as to how the cellular complement of arrestin isoforms might regulate the pattern of receptor desensitization, sequestration, and resensitization (16Oakley R.H.

Binding of β-arrestin to agonist-activated GPCRs at the plasma membrane is thought to involve multiple interactions (2Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 720-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). A large region within the amino-terminal half of β-arrestin, termed the activation recognition domain, binds the second and/or third intracellular loops of the receptor (33Wu G. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17836-17842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This is followed by the binding of a smaller, positively charged region in the central portion of β-arrestin, termed the phosphorylation recognition domain, to the GRK-phosphorylated receptor carboxyl-terminal tail (34Kieselbach T. Irrgang K.D. Ruppel H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of a cluster of serine and threonine residues would produce a localized concentration of negative charges, and the ionic interaction between the cluster of negative charges in the receptor carboxyl-terminal tail and the cluster of positive charges in the phosphorylation recognition domain of β-arrestin might be sufficient to stabilize the receptor-β-arrestin complex. Alternatively, engagement of the phosphorylated serine/threonine cluster may induce a conformational change in β-arrestin that allows a subsequent high affinity interaction between the receptor and β-arrestin to take place (35Vishnivetskiy S.A.

In favor of the latter model is our finding that the β-arrestin-1–383T truncation mutant remains associated with GPCRs lacking serine/threonine clusters. Removal of the β-arrestin-1 carboxyl terminus may constitutively expose the high affinity receptor binding site and allow the mutant β-arrestin to bind GPCRs in the absence of phosphorylation (30Kovoor A. Celver J. Abdryashitov R.I. Chavkin C. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6831-6834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The stability of the GPCR·β-arrestin complex has been shown to regulate the kinetics of receptor resensitization. For example, the ability of β-arrestin to remain associated with the V2R impairs the efficient recycling of this receptor back to the plasma membrane (14Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32248-32257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). In agreement with these findings, we show that the NTR-1 and SPR form stable complexes with β-arrestin, and both these receptors have been reported to recycle poorly (36Botto J.M. Chabry J. Sarret P. Vincent J.P. Mazella J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 37McConalogue K. Dery O. Lovett M. Wong H. Walsh J.H. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. J.

However, the stability of the receptor-β-arrestin complex may also be involved in initiating and/or regulating other signaling pathways. Recent studies have demonstrated that β-arrestin-bound internalized receptors are important for GPCR-mediated activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. β-Arrestin appears to function as a molecular scaffold that organizes and recruits components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade after binding the agonist-activated GPCR (44Luttrell L.M.

Talin is a major link between integrin and the actin cytoskeleton and was shown to play an important role in focal adhesion assembly. Consistent with the view that talin must be activated at these sites, we found that phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P2) bound to talin in cells in suspension or at early stages of adhesion, respectively. When phosphoinositides were associated with phospholipid bilayer, talin/phosphoinositide association was restricted to PI4,5P2. This association led to a conformational change of the protein. Moreover, the interaction between integrin and talin was greatly enhanced by PI4,5P2-induced talin activation. Finally, sequestration of PI4,5P2 by a specific pleckstrin homology domain confirms that PI4,5P2 is necessary for proper membrane localization of talin and that this localization is essential for the maintenance of focal adhesions. Our results support a model in which PI4,5P2 exposes the integrin-binding site on talin. We propose that PI4,5P2-dependent signaling modulates assembly of focal adhesions by regulating integrin-talin complexes. These results demonstrate that activation of the integrin-binding activity of talin requires not only integrin engagement to the extracellular matrix but also the binding of PI4,5P2 to talin, suggesting a possible role of lipid metabolism in organizing the sequential assembly of focal adhesion components.

The synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P2)1belongs to these adhesion-dependent signaling events (2McNamee H.P. Ingber D.E. Schwartz M.A. J.

The PIP 5-kinase was shown to be a partner of Rho A, a member of the Rho family monomeric GTPases that is involved in focal adhesion assembly (5Ridley A.J. Hall A.

It is a phosphoinositide found in all eucaryotic cells that regulates many important cellular processes, including vesicular trafficking, platelet activation, and organization of the cytoskeleton (7Toker A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PI 3-kinase activity was shown to play a major role in cytoskeletal rearrangements occurring during cell motility or platelet spreading and aggregation (8Wennstrom S. Siegbahn A.

Indeed, p85, the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase IA can bind to the focal adhesion kinase, a major protein of focal adhesions (12Chen H.C. Guan J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Polyphosphoinositides control the activities of various actin-binding proteins such as profilin and gelsolin to promote actin polymerization (15Janmey P.A. Annu. Rev.

Lindberg U. Schutt C. FEBS Lett. 1992; 297: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and induces conformational changes of many other proteins (18Hirao M. Sato N. Kondo T. Yonemura S. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Phosphoinositides may also increase or stabilize the formation of higher form oligomers, as suggested by the dimerization of the protein kinase Akt (19Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). Although PI4,5P2 is hydrophobic, it is not found exclusively in membranes since it can form micelles and bind to cytoskeletal proteins such as α-actinin and vinculin (20Fukami K. Endo T. Imamura M. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1518-1522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some groups have shown that PI4,5P2 dissociates the head to tail interaction of vinculin (21Johnson R.P.

As a result, the talin-binding site becomes accessible, whereas the actin-binding sites are blocked by the bound PI4,5P2 (24Steimle P.A. Hoffert J.D. Adey N.B. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18414-18420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).A large number of proteins found in focal adhesions bind actin. This suggests that these proteins may act at different stages of focal adhesion assembly. For example talin and vinculin may be involved in focal adhesion formation, whereas α-actinin may be more important in maintaining or stabilizing microfilaments attachment in mature focal adhesions (25Nuckolls G.H.

Talin, a 235-kDa protein of focal adhesions, can be cleaved into a 47-kDa N-terminal globular head domain and a 190-kDa rod domain by the endogenous protease calpain II (28Beckerle M.C. Burridge K. DeMartino G.N. Croall D.E. Cell. 1987; 51: 569-577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Investigations over the past few years have suggested that talin is a key protein for cytoskeleton/membrane interaction (for review see Ref. 29Isenberg, G., Goldmann, W. H., The Cytoskeleton, Hesketh, J. E., Pryme, I. F., 1, 1995, 169, 204, Jai Press Inc., Greenwich, CT.Google Scholar). Talin probably functions by interacting with particular structural and regulatory proteins of focal adhesions. The N-terminal domain has been shown to bind to layilin (30Borowsky M.L. Hynes R.O. J.

Structural studies have revealed that most of these functions are based on talin operating as a homodimer forming a dumbbell-shaped elongated molecule of 51 nm in length with three characteristic areas of condensed mass (39Goldmann W.H. Bremer A. Haner M. Aebi U. Isenberg G. J. Struct. Biol. 1994; 112: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Talin binding to integrin as a homodimer provides a potential mechanism by which talin may cross-link integrins (40Vignoud L. Albiges-Rizo C. Frachet P. Block M.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1421-1430PubMed Google Scholar). The 47-kDa domain contains a segment of 200–220 amino acids homologous to membrane binding regions of band 4.1 and ezrin (41Rees D.J. Ades S.E. Singer S.J. Hynes R.O. Nature. 1990; 347: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). These proteins are members of the FERM family, which includes a number of proteins that mediate linkage between the cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane (42Chisti A.H. Kim A.C. Marfatia S.M. Lutchman M. Hanspal M. Jindal H. Liu S.-C. Low P.S. Rouleau G.A. Mohandas N. Chasis J.A. Conboy J.G. Gascard P. Takakuwa Y. Huang S.-C. Benz Jr., E.J. Bretscher A. Fehon R.G. Gusella J.F. Ramesh V. Solomon F. Marchesi V.T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Arpin M. Louvard D. Tonks N.K. Anderson J.M. Fanning A.S. Bryant P.J. Woods D.F. Hoover K.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 281-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Among them are the ERM proteins that bind to the cell surface glycoprotein CD44 and actin filaments. These interactions are greatly enhanced by PI4,5P2 (18Hirao M. Sato N. Kondo T. Yonemura S. Monden M. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Talin and FERM domain containing proteins share homologous structural domains, and they are therefore proposed to be regulated by similar mechanisms. Since cell adhesion induces a signaling cascade that gives rise to elevated level of phosphoinositides and based on the sequence homologies between talin and other members of the FERM protein family, we have investigated the binding of phosphoinositides to talin and the consequences of these interactions on the protein structure and function.As described previously, we show that talin/integrin interactionin vitro is dependent on the occupancy of the receptor by extracellular ligand (40Vignoud L. Albiges-Rizo C. Frachet P. Block M.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1421-1430PubMed Google Scholar), a peculiar property of the integrin also observed in vivo (43Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the association of talin with PI4,5P2 is a prerequisite for its interaction with engaged β1integrin. Finally our data strongly suggest a possible role of phosphoinositides in the sequential assembly of focal adhesions.DISCUSSIONTalin is a major link between integrin and the cytoskeleton. It plays a crucial role in focal adhesion assembly (25Nuckolls G.H. Romer L.H. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 753-762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 69Albiges-Rizo C. Frachet P. Block M.R. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3317-3329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in integrin-mediated signaling since it is able to recruit focal adhesion kinase (31Chen H.C. Appeddu P.A. Parsons J.T. Hildebrand J.D. Schaller M.D. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16995-16999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Talin is a member of the FERM-containing domain protein family. This 30-kDa domain is a cysteine-rich basic charged globular module. This motif has been reported to bind phosphoinositides and to target proteins to the plasma membrane (42Chisti A.H. Kim A.C. Marfatia S.M. Lutchman M. Hanspal M. Jindal H. Liu S.-C. Low P.S. Rouleau G.A. Mohandas N. Chasis J.A. Conboy J.G. Gascard P. Takakuwa Y. Huang S.-C. Benz Jr., E.J. Bretscher A. Fehon R.G. Gusella J.F. Ramesh V. Solomon F. Marchesi V.T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Arpin M. Louvard D. Tonks N.K. Anderson J.M. Fanning A.S. Bryant P.J. Woods D.F. Hoover K.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 281-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Several proteins without a FERM domain are known to interact with phosphoinositides. Generally, they associate with phosphoinositides via sequences rich in basic and polar amino acids. It has been speculated that these motifs may facilitate membrane association of these proteins by interacting with the negatively charged head groups of phosphoinositides (70Inglese J. Freedman N.J. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23735-23738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A consensus sequence for PI4,5P2 binding has been described as (K/R)XXXKX(K/R)(K/R) (71Yu F.X. Sun H.Q. Janmey P.A. Yin H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14616-14621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but other binding sequences exist. The sequence of the head domain of talin is particularly rich in basic amino acids (41Rees D.J. Ades S.E. Singer S.J. Hynes R.O. Nature. 1990; 347: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), and so talin appears as a good candidate for interacting with phosphoinositides. Indeed, in good agreement with previous reports (50Isenberg G. Niggli V. Pieper U. Kaufmann S. Goldmann W.H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we have found that talin is able to bind in vitro PI, PIP, and PI4,5P2. However, within a phospholipid bilayer, this interaction is restricted to PI4,5P2. These findings fit with the known properties of the FERM-containing protein family.In vivo, talin seems to bind PI, PIP, and PI4,5P2, but the relative amount of the lipid varies during the time course of cell attachment and spreading (Fig. 2). Although PI and PIP are the major lipid species bound to talin when HeLa cells are just detached from the matrix, PI4,5P2 is found mainly after 10 min of spreading on fibronectin. Similarly, PIP and PI4,5P2 have also been described to be associated with talin in activated but not on resting platelets (72Heraud J.M. Racaud-Sultan C. Gironcel D. Albiges-Rizo C. Giacomini T. Roques S. Martel V. Breton-Douillon M. Perret B. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17817-17823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This result is consistent with the fact that PI4,5P2 synthesis from PIP is dependent on cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (2McNamee H.P. Ingber D.E. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 673-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). However, during cell spreading talin associates temporarily with PI4,5P2 which suggests that this phosphoinositide regulates the function of talin during cell adhesion. Surprisingly, no lipids are associated with talin on fully spread cells. This could be due to the action of phospholipases or inositol phosphatases that allow the regulation of phosphoinositide levels. Consistent with this hypothesis, it has been shown that synaptojanin, an inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase, can hydrolyze the PI4,5P2bound to actin regulatory protein such as profilin, cofilin, and α-actinin (73Takenawa T. Itoh T. Fukami K. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Knowing that phosphoinositide binding can control protein/protein interactions and biological activities, we have studied the effect of phosphoinositides on talin/integrin interaction by an in vitro binding assay. Indeed, as already reported by many other groups, a peptide corresponding to the cytosolic domain of the β1 cytosolic tail was able to bind efficiently talin. However, PIP and PI4,5P2 greatly enhanced this interaction (Fig. 4). Furthermore, with whole integrin receptors affinity-purified on fibronectin or on specific antibodies, efficient binding of talin depends on both integrin occupancy by ligand (40Vignoud L. Albiges-Rizo C. Frachet P. Block M.R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1421-1430PubMed Google Scholar, 43Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar) and the presence of PIP or PI4,5P2 (Fig. 5). It has been reported previously that ligand binding to the integrin αIIbβ3induces further conformational changes in the extracellular domain of the receptor, resulting in the exposure of neoantigenic sites termed ligand-induced binding sites. The more recent idea is that such a conformational change is transduced through the cell membrane to the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor, thereby exposing cytoplasmic ligand-induced binding site epitopes for the accumulation of potential intracellular cytoskeletal proteins. These results could suggest that the extracellular ligand-binding site and the cytoplasmic ligand-induced binding site epitopes on integrins are conformationally and functionally coupled. Furthermore, recent data have revealed that the interaction between the globular head domain of talin and the β3 cytosolic tail occurs in the membrane-proximal region of the integrin cytoplasmic domain (74Patil S. Jedsadayanmata A. Wencel-Drake J.D. Wang W. Knezevic I. Lam S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28575-28583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the talin-binding site close to the membrane proximal region of the integrin cytoplasmic domain is dynamically regulated. Indeed, as is the case for other phosphoinositide-binding proteins, the association of talin with PI4,5P2 resulted in a conformational change of the protein that allowed an increase in proteolytic sensitivity that may correspond to a more open form of the protein. Finally, our results add evidence that talin is itself rendered competent for binding integrins following its interaction with phosphoinositides. Such interaction may stabilize the activated conformational state since it has been shown that overexpression of the talin head increases the proportion of αIIbβ3 in its activated state (33Calderwood D.A. Zent R. Grant R. Rees D.J. Hynes R.O. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28071-28074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar).Altogether the data presented here suggest an attractive model in which lipid metabolism may play a major role in the sequential assembly of focal adhesions by interacting directly with some components of these structures. When cells are detached from the extracellular matrix, talin is not in the vicinity of the plasma membrane, is mainly bound to PIP, and could be competent for immediate binding to the integrin provided that the receptors are allowed to interact with their extracellular ligand. However, since talin interacts with the integrin at the membrane level, efficient interaction might depend only on PI4,5P2, as suggested by cosedimentation experiments carried out with liposomes. Ten minutes after initial plating on fibronectin, a large amount of PI4,5P2 is synthesized due to the adhesion-dependent activation of PIP 5-kinase. Binding of PI4,5P2 on talin keeps this protein in a conformation allowing its interaction with integrins and leads to the break of vinculin head to tail interaction and its subsequent binding to talin. However, high level of PI4,5P2 prevents additional actin binding to vinculin (24Steimle P.A. Hoffert J.D. Adey N.B. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18414-18420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Finally, in order to allow PI4,5P2-bound vinculin to bind actin, the PI4,5P2 should be hydrolyzed or displaced from vinculin (24Steimle P.A. Hoffert J.D. Adey N.B. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18414-18420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). By knowing that some inositol 5-phosphatases can hydrolyze the PI4,5P2 bound to cytoskeletal proteins (73Takenawa T. Itoh T. Fukami K. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), it is possible that this hydrolysis may promote vinculin/actin interaction. Finally, after the organization of stress fibers, fully functional focal adhesions could be formed.Our data with transient transfection experiments with PH domains are in good agreement with this model, since they showed that PI4,5P2 is necessary for the maintenance of talin in focal adhesions. This could be explained by the observation that PI4,5P2 promotes a high affinity interaction between talin and engaged integrins. PI4,5P2 then recruits and opens talin to expose its binding sites for integrins, thereby contributing to the assembly of focal adhesions. This is also consistent with the fact that the phosphoinositides have no further effect on the binding of the talin head to the cytoplasmic domain of integrin. The transient interaction of PI4,5P2 with talin suggests that the lipids are required only in the early stages of assembly of the new focal adhesions. However, the delocalization of talin from focal adhesions (Fig. 8) does not reflect any discrepancy with this hypothesis. Indeed, PI4,5P2 sequestrated by the PH domain is no longer available for the change of talin conformation and its incorporation in focal adhesions. Contrary to what happens in in vitrobinding experiments, focal adhesions are dynamic structures, subjected to a fast turn over. Therefore, even if phosphoinositides are not required to maintain the stability of fully assembled structures, the blockade of talin/integrin interaction results in the progressive disappearance of talin from these structures. On the other hand, vinculin is not displaced from focal adhesions when PI4,5P2is sequestrated, which agrees with the fact that PI4,5P2should be displaced from vinculin for allowing its interaction with actin (24Steimle P.A. Hoffert J.D. Adey N.B. Craig S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18414-18420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The remaining question is know how vinculin can be attached to integrin without any talin and whether another factor is able to bind vinculin to integrin. This restructuring of focal adhesions indicates that vinculin plays an important role in the stabilization and maintenance of actin stress fibers. Conversely, talin is one of the first associated components in focal adhesion assembly (26DePasquale J.A. Izzard C.S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2803-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Examination of the localization of focal adhesion proteins (Figs. 8 and9) indicates that PI4,5P2 sequestration actually induces a restructuring of the focal adhesion plaque rather than a complete dispersal of the complex. However, vinculin remained clustered after 16 h of PH/PLCδ transfection indicating a hierarchy between different focal adhesion proteins that allow different integrin responses.Finally, the latter results open very exciting research fields, since they suggest that factors that regulate the assembly and disassembly of focal adhesions are probably different: when PI4,5P2 is sequestrated, talin is one of the first proteins to be excluded, whereas vinculin, integrins, and actin remain associated in focal adhesions for a longer period. This consequence could reflect the availability of focal adhesions to redistribute focal contact proteins and adds another piece of proof of the dynamics of focal contacts. Integrin-mediated cell attachment to extracellular matrix triggers signal transduction cascades that regulate numerous complex biological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration, as well as tissue organization (1Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). The synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P2)1belongs to these adhesion-dependent signaling events (2McNamee H.P. Ingber D.E. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 673-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar,3Udagawa T. McIntyre B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12542-12548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recently, a physical association was found between the α3β1 integrin and PI 4-kinase, an intracellular enzyme that controls one step of PI4,5P2biosynthesis (4Berditchevski F. Tolias K.F. Wong K. Carpenter C.L. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2595-2598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The PIP 5-kinase was shown to be a partner of Rho A, a member of the Rho family monomeric GTPases that is involved in focal adhesion assembly (5Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar, 6Ren X.D. Bokoch G.M. Traynor-Kaplan A. Jenkins G.H. Anderson R.A. Schwartz M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The activation of both enzymes leads to the production of PI4,5P2. It is a phosphoinositide found in all eucaryotic cells that regulates many important cellular processes, including vesicular trafficking, platelet activation, and organization of the cytoskeleton (7Toker A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PI 3-kinase activity was shown to play a major role in cytoskeletal rearrangements occurring during cell motility or platelet spreading and aggregation (8Wennstrom S. Siegbahn A.

Using purified recombinant proteins, combined with fluorescence resonance energy transfer technology, we have found that the C terminus of JNK is critical to the interaction with GSTP1–1. The apparent K d for full-length JNK was 188 nm and for a C-terminal fragment (residues 200–424) 217 nm. An N-terminal fragment (residues 1–206) did not bind to GSTP1–1. Increased expression of the C-terminal JNK fragment in a tetracycline-inducible transfected NIH3T3 cell line produced a concentration-dependent increase in the kinase activity of JNK under normal, unstressed growth conditions indicating a dominant-negative effect. This suggests that the fragment can compete with endogenous full-length functional JNK resulting in dissociation of the GSTP1–1-JNK interaction and concomitant JNK enzyme activation. By using an antibody to hemagglutinin-tagged C-JNK, a concentration-dependent co-immunoprecipitation of GSTP1–1 was achieved.

Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). In addition, the JNK pathway participates in activating transcription factor 2 (3Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J.

Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar). Extracellular signals such as growth factors, transforming oncoproteins, and UV irradiation stimulate phosphorylation of c-Jun at ser-63/73 and activate c-Jun-dependent transcription. The binding of JNK to the N-terminal region of c-Jun permits substrate phosphorylation. The JNK pathway has also been shown to be important in the control of cell survival and death pathways, and interference with the JNK pathway suppresses the induction of apoptosis by a variety of agents (10Yin Z. Ivanov V. Habelhah H. Tew K.D. Ronai Z. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4053-4057PubMed Google Scholar). The glutathione S-transferases (GST) are a multigene family of isozymes that catalyze the nucleophilic attack of the sulfur atom of glutathione on electrophilic groups of substrate molecules. Although catalytic efficiencies for many of the substrates are low, their biological relevance as enzymes has frequently been linked to pleiotropic substrate specificity. Among this family of isozymes, GSTP1–1 is generally the most prevalent in mammalian cells. The link between GST overexpression, especially with respect to GSTP1–1, and anticancer drug resistance has been extensively studied (11Tew K.D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4313-4320PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the defined role of GST in drug metabolism, elevated expression of GSTP1–1 in solid tumors or in drug-resistant cells has been associated frequently with detoxification reactions even in instances where there is no evidence that the selecting drug is a substrate for GSTP1–1. More recently, however, the link between the redox active components of GSTP1–1 and stress-activated kinases, such as JNK, has been redefined as a non-catalytic, ligand binding activity that mediates both stress and apoptotic responses (1Adler V. Yin Z. Fuchs S.Y. Benezra M. Rosario L. Tew K.D. Pincus M.R. Sardana M. Henderson C.J. Wolf C.R. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1321-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar, 10Yin Z. Ivanov V. Habelhah H. Tew K.D. Ronai Z. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4053-4057PubMed Google Scholar). In a parallel series of studies, either GSTμ or thioredoxin has also been identified as a ligand-binding partner for apoptosis-signaling kinase (ASK1) (12Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fuji M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2596-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (2045) Google Scholar, 13Cho, S.-G., Lee, Y. H., Park, H.-S., Ryoo, K., Kang, K.

Chem., in press.Google Scholar), extending the role that “redox proteins” may have in kinase regulation. To elucidate further the mechanism by which GSTP1–1 mediates JNK signal transduction, we have used biophysical methods in reconstituted protein systems to provide direct evidence for protein-protein interactions and to measure binding affinities. Our results demonstrate that GSTP1–1 has significant affinity for the C terminus of JNK and confirm the ligand-binding regulatory role for this ubiquitously expressed protein. Recombinant JNK1 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli. The polymerase chain reaction product was constructed with a leader His-tag, digested with NdeI and BamHI, purified, and ligated intoNdeI-digested, BamHI-digested, and phosphatase-treated pET-15b to create JNK.pET-15b. The JNK1 protein was expressed in E. coli and purified using a standard Ni2+ column for His-tagged proteins. The purified protein was homogeneous as judged by the single polypeptide band of the predicted M r on silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels (data not shown). Both the C-terminal and N-terminal truncated proteins expressed inE. coli were found mainly in the insoluble fraction of the bacterial extracts. Thus, inclusion bodies were solubilized in 50 mm CAPS (3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid), pH 11.0, with 0.3% N-lauroylsarcosine supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol and slowly diluted to 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5, before subjection to Ni2+ column chromatography. Renaturation was accomplished by dialyzing for 12 h at 4 °C with a change of buffer with dithiothreitol and continued dialysis for an additional 6 h. To promote refolding, a further period of dialysis in the above buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.5) without dithiothreitol for the same length of time was enacted. The GSTP1–1 construct was made by direct digestion of GSTP1–1 from PCR2.1(+) with HindIII and XhoI followed by cloning into pET21 vector previously treated with HindIII and XhoI. This was expressed in E. coli, and protein was purified using GSH affinity chromatography. Circular dichroic spectra of the C-terminal and N-terminal JNK1 in 20 mm PO43+ were obtained using an Aviv 62A DS spectrometer at the Fox Chase Cancer Center core facility. The corresponding structural elements were calculated using an algorithm for the estimation of the percentages of protein secondary structure from UV circular dichroism spectra using a Kohonen neural network with a two-dimensional output layer using K2D software (14Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Morán F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar,15Merelo J.J. Andrade M.A. Prieto A. Morán F. Neurocomputing. 1994; 6: 443-454Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The program uses a self-organizing neural network to extract the secondary structure features present in the data from a set of circular dichroism spectra ranging from 200–241 nm. The result provides an estimate of percentage helix, β-sheet, and random structure for the protein. K2D also estimates the probable error in the estimation based on the training procedure results. GSTP1–1 was labeled at a 1:1 molar ratio (probe:protein) with the fluorescence energy transfer donor 7-methoxycoumarin succinyl ester using previously described procedures (16Wang T. Dowal L. El-Maghrabi M.R. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7466-7469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The JNK1 partner proteins (full-length and partial) were similarly labeled with the non-fluorescence energy transfer acceptor, 4(dimethylamino) phenylazophenyl-4-sulfonyl chloride succinyl ester (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR). The protein:probe labeling ratios were determined by absorption spectroscopy (17Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar) using the calculated extinction coefficients for the protein and the coefficients provided by the probe manufacturer. NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cells that stably express the pSV40-Hyg plasmid (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (Life Technologies Inc.). Cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2. The pTet-C-JNK was assembled by subcloning the cDNA of the C-terminal 224 amino acids of wild type JNK1 into the tet-regulated promoter of the pUHD-10−3 vector. Cell clones that stably express both constructs were selected in 600 μg/ml geneticin in the presence of hygromycin (100 μg/ml) 24 h afterN,N,N-trimethyl 1–2-3-bis (1-oxo-9-octa-decenyl)oxy-(Z,Z)-1-propanaminium methyl sulfate transfection with the pTet-C-JNK-UHD-10−3 construct. Cells expressing C-terminal JNK were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing fetal bovine serum (10%), hygromycin (100 μg/ml), and geneticin (400 μg/ml). To maintain suppression of C-terminal JNK expression, tetracycline was added to the medium every 3 days (to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml). Analysis of JNK1 activity was achieved by measurement of phosphorylation of c-Jun as a substrate (1Adler V. Yin Z. Fuchs S.Y. Benezra M. Rosario L. Tew K.D. Pincus M.R. Sardana M. Henderson C.J. Wolf C.R. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1321-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar). Antibodies to C-JNK and phospho-c-Jun were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Immunoblot analysis was performed using 200 μg of whole cell extract (WCE) separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by electrotransfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in 20 mm CHAPS (3-(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio-1-propane-sulfonate)) buffer, pH 11, for 30 min membrane blocking (5% non-fat milk) and incubating with the respective antibodies. Reactions were visualized using chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents. Immunoprecipitations were carried out following the protocol from the manual provided by Roche Diagnostics Corporation using 1 mg of WCE and 2 μg of the respective antibodies for 16 h at 4 °C. Protein G beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were added (15 μl) for 4 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitated material was subjected to immunoblot analysis. Protein kinase assays were carried out using JNK kinase assay kits from New England BioLabs according the to manufacturer's instructions. The kinase reaction was carried out in the presence of excess unlabeled ATP. c-Jun phosphorylation was selectively measured using a phospho-c-Jun antibody. This antibody specifically measures JNK-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun at Ser-63, an important site for c-Jun-dependent transcriptional activity. Associations between GSTP1–1 and JNK were measured by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) as described previously (16Wang T. Dowal L. El-Maghrabi M.R. Rebecchi M. Scarlata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7466-7469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured using UV absorption (A 280) and colorimetric assays. Extinction coefficients for each protein were assessed as described previously (18Wang T. Pentyala S. Elliott J.T. Dowal L. Gupta E. Rebecchi M.J. Scarlata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 6: 7843-7846Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). FRET was performed on a PC1 (photon counting) spectrofluorimeter (ISS, Inc., Champagne, IL) using a 3-mm cuvette with a magnetic stirrer. Coumarin-labeled proteins were excited at 350 nm and scanned from 380–480 nm. To determine the binding affinities for protein-protein interactions, the energy transfer data were analyzed using Sigma Plot. All immunoblot and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels were scanned using a UMAX Powerbook III flatbed with Adobe Photoshop software. Scanned images were quantified by NIH image program. Prism software was used for data analysis. Full-length JNK1 was soluble and purified directly by Ni2+chromatography. Both truncated forms were insoluble in aqueous buffer and were initially solubilized in detergent followed by slow dialysis against renaturing buffers. The renatured proteins were then similarly purified by Ni2+ chromatography. The purity of these proteins was confirmed by single band staining on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Circular dichroism of these purified proteins was used to monitor the refolding process. Fig. 1 shows the proportional secondary structure of the truncated fragments derived from the circular dichroism spectra. These data were analyzed further using a Kohonen neural network with two-dimensional output layer using K2D software (14Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Morán F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 15Merelo J.J. Andrade M.A. Prieto A. Morán F. Neurocomputing. 1994; 6: 443-454Crossref Scopus (123) Google Scholar). JNK1 shows a >95% identity to JNK3, a protein which has been crystallized (19Xie X. Gu Y. Fox T. Coll J.T. Fleming M.A. Markland W. Caron P.R. Wilson K.P. Su M.S. Structure. 1998; 6: 983-991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The C-terminal of JNK3 is comprised primarily of α-helices, whereas the N-terminal is predominantly comprised of β-sheet. Such structures are in agreement with the data shown in Table I, confirming that accurate folding in solution has occurred.Table IK2D software analysis of circular dichroism resultsC-JNKN-JNKα-Helices0.80.12β-Sheets0.000.40Random coils0.20.48 Open table in a new tab In vitro association kinetics between the purified JNK proteins and GSTP1–1 was analyzed using (FRET) and is shown in Fig.2. GSTP1–1 was labeled with the succinyl ester of 7-methoxycoumarin. Full-length and truncated JNK1 was labeled with the non-fluorescence energy transfer acceptor, 4-(dimethylamino) phenylazophenyl-4-sulfonyl chloride succinyl ester. Saturation binding experiments were used to measure the specific binding at equilibrium at various concentrations of the fluorescent acceptor protein to determine acceptor affinity. Fig. 2 Ashows that for the full-length JNK1 a loss in 7-methoxycoumarin fluorescence was observed as the protein interacted with GSTP1–1. A similar result was found for the C-terminal fragment (Fig.2 B), while neither the N-terminal fragment nor buffer conditions produced any change in fluorescence. The calculatedK d for GSTP1–1 association with full-length JNK1 was 188 ± 38 nm and for the C-terminal fragment, 217 ± 72 nm. These data provide quantitative evidence for the direct protein-protein interaction between GSTP1–1 and JNK1. These results were extended to a cellular system by using a tet-inducible construct of HA-tagged C-JNK. To measure thein vivo association of C-JNK and GSTP1–1, immunoprecipitation of WCE from cells expressing HA-tagged C-JNK was performed. Induction of C-JNK expression following removal of tetracycline resulted in an enhanced level of GSTP1–1 co-immunoprecipitation when an HA-tag antibody was used (Fig.3). These data are consistent with the conclusion that C-JNK and GSTP1–1 interact in a cellular milieu. Similarly, the intracellular expression of the C-terminal truncated form of JNK1 leads to an increase in JNK1 kinase activity as a consequence of competing for the GSTP1–1 binding site and liberating catalytically active JNK1 (see Fig. 5). For confirmation that the C-terminal portion of JNK1 is critical to the JNK1-GSTP1–1 interaction, a tetracycline-inducible expression system was used to examine whether the increased expression of the C-terminal truncated JNK1 could have a dominant-negative effect upon GSTP1–1 inhibition of JNK1 activity. Fig. 4 shows the time-dependent increase in expression of the C-terminal truncated JNK1 fragment following removal of tetracycline. Induction of the C-terminal fragment was detected by 1 h and persisted for at least 48 h. In these same cells, full-length JNK1 expression was constitutive and unaltered throughout this period (Fig. 4). JNK1 activity was measured by the phosphorylation of the downstream c-Jun substrate (Fig. 5). The time-dependent increase in phosphorylated c-Jun was coincident with the enhanced expression of the truncated C-terminal fragment. If tetracycline was not removed from the media, there was no enhanced production of phosphorylated c-Jun product (Fig. 5). Overall, these results support the conclusion that the C-JNK fragment through competitive binding with GSTP1–1 can act in a dominant-negative fashion and increase the catalytic activity of JNK1. Glutathione S-transferases are a multigene family of isozymes that primarily have been linked functionally with phase II metabolism or xenobiotics. In particular, GSTP1–1 is frequently overexpressed in solid tumors and in cells that have acquired resistance to anticancer drugs even when the selected drug is not a GST substrate (11Tew K.D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4313-4320PubMed Google Scholar). The precise reason for the high levels of expression in tumor cells has not been explained adequately. Recently, we have carried out a series of studies to show that GSTP1–1 can act as a ligand-binding protein and an endogenous switch for the control of the catalytic activity of JNK1 (1Adler V. Yin Z. Fuchs S.Y. Benezra M. Rosario L. Tew K.D. Pincus M.R. Sardana M. Henderson C.J. Wolf C.R. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1321-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar, 10Yin Z. Ivanov V. Habelhah H. Tew K.D. Ronai Z. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4053-4057PubMed Google Scholar). This has led to other studies implicating that GSTP1–1 is in control of apoptosis (20Bernardini S. Bernassola F. Cortese C. Ballerini S. Melino G. Motti C. Bellincampi L. Iori R. Federici G. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Maintenance of cellular kinases that influence cell growth and apoptosis must be finely tuned. In particular, external stimuli such as reactive oxygen species may influence signaling kinase activities, influencing pathways in stress response and cell survival (21Davis Jr., W. Ronai Z. Tew K.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 296: 1-6PubMed Google Scholar). It now seems reasonable to conclude that GSTP1–1 can elicit protection against apoptosis induced by reactive oxygen species by controlling the balance of kinase activity elicited by JNK1 versus other cellular kinases such as extracellular signal regulated kinase, IκB kinase, and p38 (1Adler V. Yin Z. Fuchs S.Y. Benezra M. Rosario L. Tew K.D. Pincus M.R. Sardana M. Henderson C.J. Wolf C.R. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1321-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar,10Yin Z. Ivanov V. Habelhah H. Tew K.D. Ronai Z. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4053-4057PubMed Google Scholar). Our earlier experiments showing interactions between GSTP1–1 and JNK1 relied primarily on immunoprecipitation technology. In this report, we combine a number of technical approaches to provide evidence for direct protein-protein interaction between GSTP1–1 and JNK1. These data also establish quantitative binding kinetics for these two proteins with K d values in the nanomolar range. The specificity of the C terminus of JNK1 was confirmed by a number of controls that included the N-terminal and other unlabeled proteins, all of which failed to bind. The affinity of the truncated C-JNK fragment for GSTP1–1 was similar to the full-length protein. JNK1 shares a high level of amino acid identity with JNK3 (Fig.6). By extrapolation, we were able to establish that the folding pattern of the C-terminal truncated JNK1 was similar to the structure of JNK3 established by crystallography data (19Xie X. Gu Y. Fox T. Coll J.T. Fleming M.A. Markland W. Caron P.R. Wilson K.P. Su M.S. Structure. 1998; 6: 983-991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Both the in vitro and cellular data confirmed that the truncated C-terminal JNK1 contained amino acid residues that can be implicated in the binding to GSTP1–1. A recent study (22Monaco R. Friedman F.K. Hyde M.J. Chen J.M. Manolatus S. Adler V. Ronai Z. Koslosky W. Pincus M.R. J. Protein Chem. 1999; 18: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) has used computation of average structures to reveal that residues 194–201 of GSTP1–1 may be involved in the interaction with JNK. This sequence (SSPEHVNR) contains residues that are positively charged or contain polar groups in their side chains. Sequence analysis of the C terminus of JNK1 shows both a loop region and an α-helix rich in negatively charged residues, particularly glutamic and aspartic acid (Fig. 6). These residues are either in the flexible loop structure (Asp-377, Asp-381, Glu-382, Glu-384) or the α-helix (Glu-388, Glu-389, Glu-392, Glu-397, Asp-400, Glu-402, Glu-403) of the protein and can form a negatively charged binding face capable of interacting with GSTP1–1. This, in turn, is on the surface of JNK1 and therefore in a location conducive to protein-protein interaction with GSTP1–1. Fig. 6 shows the sequence alignments for the C-terminal components of JNK family members (19Xie X. Gu Y. Fox T. Coll J.T. Fleming M.A. Markland W. Caron P.R. Wilson K.P. Su M.S. Structure. 1998; 6: 983-991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The potential interaction site implicated in the molecular dynamic analysis (22Monaco R. Friedman F.K.

Protein Chem. 1999; 18: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) is distal to the GST subunit dimerization domain (involving Cys-47 and Cys-101) (23Garcia-Saez I. Parraga A. Phillips M.F. Mantle T.J. Coll M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 298-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) suggesting that JNK may interact in vivo with homodimeric GSTP1–1. In addition, because the catalytic kinase domain is localized in the N-terminal of JNK1, our results suggest that the capacity of GSTP1–1 to suppress JNK enzyme activity will be through an allosteric inhibition mechanism. This information may be facile in the design of potential small molecule inhibitors of the ligand-binding properties of these two proteins. Targeting this area on JNK1 may impact kinase expression and, by extrapolation, influence apoptosis (10Yin Z. Ivanov V. Habelhah H. Tew K.D. Ronai Z. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4053-4057PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that a peptidomimetic inhibitor of GSTP1–1 (24Morgan A.S. Ciaccio P.J. Tew K.D. Kauvar L.M. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1996; 37: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) causes a dissociation of the GSTP1–1-JNK1 complex resulting in increased JNK catalytic activity (1Adler V. Yin Z. Fuchs S.Y. Benezra M. Rosario L. Tew K.D. Pincus M.R. Sardana M. Henderson C.J. Wolf C.R. Davis R.J. Ronai Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1321-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar).

It is plausible that pharmacological manipulation with such agents could achieve control of the coordinated regulation of stress kinases with a significant impact in the therapy of cancer.

https://openalex.org/W1985205346,"In Escherichia coli, a subset of periplasmic proteins is exported via the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway. In the present study, we have purified the Tat complex from E. coli, and we show that it contains only TatA, TatB, and TatC. Within the purified complex, TatB and TatC are present in a strict 1:1 ratio, suggesting a functional association. This has been confirmed by expression of a translational fusion between TatB and TatC. This Tat(BC) chimera supports efficient Tat-dependent export, indicating that TatB and TatC act as a unit in both structural and functional terms. The purified Tat complex contains varying levels of TatA, suggesting a gradual loss during isolation and a looser association. The molecular mass of the complex is ∼600 kDa, demonstrating the presence of multiple copies of TatA, B, and C. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments show that TatC is required for the interaction of TatA with TatB, suggesting that TatA may interact with the complex via binding to TatC."

The establishment of this differential composition is achieved through the concerted actions of distinct integral membrane ion carriers, including pumps, channels, and transporters. For example, alkalinization of the mitochondrial matrix, driven by the respiratory chain, contributes to the inner membrane H+ gradient used to drive ATP synthesis (1Saraste M. Science. 1999; 283: 1488-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar) and, indirectly, to extrude matrix Ca2+ through the functional coupling of Na+/H+ and Na+/Ca2+ antiport pathways (2Garlid K.D.

Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar).By contrast, organelles of the secretory and endocytic pathways are distinguished by their luminal acidity, which is generated by the activity of an electrogenic vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase)1 (5Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 663-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12951-12954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Progressive acidification of vesicles in the endocytic pathway (early and late endosomes, pH ∼6.5 → lysosomes, pH ∼4.5) is essential for the redistribution and degradation of internalized membrane proteins, such as ligand-receptor complexes and fluid-phase solutes (5Mellman I.

Likewise, increasing luminal acidification of compartments of the exocytic pathway (endoplasmic reticulum, pH ∼7.0 → Golgi complex, pH ∼6.5 → trans-Golgi network (TGN), pH ∼6.0 → secretory vesicles, pH ∼5.0) is important for proper post-translational processing and sorting of newly synthesized proteins (5Mellman I.

Although distinct isoforms of some of the V-ATPase subunits have been reported in different tissues (10Puopolo K. Kumamoto C. Adachi I. Magner R. Forgac M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1992; 172: 29-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), there is no clear evidence that the V-ATPase functions differently in particular organelles within a single mammalian cell (although this may not be the case in yeast (13Manolson M.F.

It has been suggested that because the pump is electrogenic, its activity could be influenced by the membrane potential and by the availability of permeant counterions such as chloride and potassium (14Rybak S.L. Lanni F. Murphy R.F. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 674-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, in the case of the Golgi complex, the endogenous counterion conductances were found to exceed the rate of H+pumping at the steady state, implying that the electrical potential across the membrane is negligible and therefore not a defining factor in setting organellar pH (15Demaurex N.

In addition, despite extensive work, differential control of V-ATPase activity by hormones or other factors has not been found along the endo- or exocytic pathways. Rather, the luminal [H+] is thought to be regulated by a complex interplay between the V-ATPase and unidentified leak pathways for protons, based on the rapid dissipation of the transmembrane proton chemical gradient (ΔpH) observed after inhibiting the V-ATPase with macrolide antibiotics (15Demaurex N.

A component of this H+leak in the Golgi complex was recently identified as a Zn2+-inhibitable H+ conductance (17Schapiro F.B. Grinstein S. J. Biol.

Nevertheless, it highlights the H+ leak as a key determinant of organellar pH and emphasizes the need to identify the molecular components of this pathway which, in addition to putative H+ channels, could conceivably involve H+ proton-coupled cotransporters or exchangers.In this study, we describe the cloning and functional characterization of a unique monovalent cation/proton exchanger that localizes predominantly to the trans-Golgi network and suggests a novel molecular mechanism for controlling the luminal cation composition of this important organelle.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONA search of the GenBankTM data base for candidate genes homologous to known mammalian Na+/H+exchangers (i.e. NHE1-NHE6) (23Orlowski J.

These shared highest sequence identity to the mitochondrion-targeted NHE6 isoform rather than to the plasmalemmal NHEs (i.e. NHE1–5), suggesting that the gene product (which we designate as NHE7) may also reside in an intracellular compartment. Examination of the sequences of the putative NHE7 cDNAs indicated that they lacked coding information at the 5′- and 3′-ends. To obtain the complete nucleotide sequence, we sequenced cDNAs isolated from a single-stranded cDNA library that had been generated from human bone marrow poly(A+) mRNA using rapid amplification of cDNA ends methodology and genomic fragments cloned from a human λ phage library (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”).The deduced primary sequence of NHE7 is composed of 725 amino acids (calculated Mr = 80,132) and exhibits high amino acid identity (∼70%) to NHE6 (Fig.1 A) but low similarity (∼ 25%) to other NHEs. Based on hydropathy plot analysis, NHE7 is predicted to contain 12 α-helical hydrophobic membrane-spanning (M) segments in the N terminus followed by a hydrophilic cytoplasmic tail at the C terminus, similar to other NHEs (Fig. 1 B). Recent biochemical and molecular topological studies of the NHE1 isoform partially support this structural model (26Shrode L.D. Gan B.S. D'Souza S.J. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C431-C439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), although some notable changes in the arrangement of the C-terminal transmembrane segments have been proposed (27Wakabayashi S. Pang T. Su X. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7942-7949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), namely the predicted M10 segment was suggested to reside within the lipid bilayer (the predicted M11 was renamed M10), whereas the last extracellular loop was found to form an intracellular loop, a new transmembrane segment (M11), and an extracellular loop. Unlike NHE1, a recent report has suggested that a part of the cytoplasmic C terminus of the NHE3 isoform may reside at the exoplasmic surface (28Biemesderfer D. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12391-12396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Whether these structural features of the plasmalemmal NHEs also apply to the more distantly related organellar NHEs remains to be determined.Northern blot analysis of selected human tissues using an isoform-specific cDNA probe from the 3′-coding region revealed three NHE7 mRNA transcripts of ∼9.5, 7.5, and 3.0 kilobases in length under high stringency hybridization conditions (Fig.2 A). More extensive RNA dot blot analyses of human tissues showed that the gene is expressed ubiquitously (Fig. 2 B) but most prominently in certain regions of the brain (putamen and occipital lobe), skeletal muscle, and secretory tissues (prostate, stomach, pancreas, pituitary gland, adrenal gland, thyroid gland, salivary gland, and mammary gland). Each of the mRNAs is of sufficient length to contain the entire coding region, which could result from differential processing of the untranslated regions or alternative-splicing of a single gene product. The former is favored since attempts to identify alternatively spliced variants within the coding region by reverse transcriptase-PCR were unsuccessful. Alternatively, certain transcript(s) may represent other closely related genes that have yet to be characterized. This broad pattern of expression is consistent with NHE7 serving a “housekeeping” function.Figure 2Expression of NHE7 mRNA in human tissues. A human tissue poly(A+) RNA Northern blot (2 μg of RNA per lane) (A) and a human poly(A+) RNA MasterTM dot blot (CLONTECH) (B) were hybridized with an isoform-specific 32P-labeled NHE7 cDNA probe (0.2 kilobase pairs) under high stringency conditions. The radioactive signals were detected using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics).

The full-length NHE7HA cDNA was subcloned into the ecdysone-inducible expression vector pIND and stably transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells engineered to express constitutively an ecdysone-activable receptor (EcR-CHO cells). Regulated expression of NHE7HA was verified by incubating isolated NHE7HA-transfected EcR-CHO cell colonies in the presence of increasing concentrations of ponasterone A, an analogue of ecdysone. As shown in Fig. 3, ponasterone A induced a dose-dependent increase in the expression of NHE7HA, which migrated as two broad bands of ∼180 and 80 kDa by SDS-PAGE analysis. The faster migrating band corresponds to the predicted size of the protein. The larger band may represent the formation of a homodimer that is modestly stable in SDS, as has been reported for NHE1 and NHE3 (29Fafournoux P. Noël J. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2589-2596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bands are diffuse, suggesting the presence of glycosylation or other post-translational modifications. Consistent with this possibility, the N terminus contains putativeN-linked glycosylation sites in the predicted extracellular loop between M3 and M4 (Asn145-Val-Ser) and between M9 and M10 (Asn400-Leu-Ser). Although the latter site is highly conserved in eukaryotic NHEs, it does not appear to be glycosylated in other mammalian NHE isoforms (i.e. NHE1, NHE2, and NHE3) (30Counillon L. Pouysségur J.

Cell lysates were prepared from an EcR-CHO cell line stably transfected with NHE7HA following incubation with increasing concentrations (0–10 μm) of the ecdysone analogue, ponasterone A, for 24 h. Fifty μg of each cell lysate were subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody. Molecular weight markers are shown on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To define the subcellular distribution of NHE7HA, NHE7HA-transfected EcR-CHO cells were treated with a submaximal concentration of ponasterone A (5 μm) for 24 h and then examined using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Typically under these conditions, ∼50% of the cells in different stable transfectants were found to express detectable levels of NHE7HA. The partial penetrance of NHE7HAexpression upon ponasterone A induction was also observed in individual secondary and tertiary isolates obtained by dilution subcloning. The cellular basis for this limited expression pattern is unclear but may relate to the site of genomic integration of the ecdysone receptor gene and/or the stage of the cell cycle.Representative dual labeling experiments revealed that NHE7HA accumulates predominantly in a juxtanuclear compartment that was closely apposed but somewhat broader than the compact structure labeled by an antibody against α-mannosidase II, an established marker of the medial and trans-cisternae of the Golgi (Fig. 4, A–C) (33Velasco A. Hendricks L. Moremen K.W. Tulsiani D.R. Touster Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Transient expression of two additional constructs, one containing an internal HA-tag inserted at position Leu488 and the other containing a C-terminal c-Myc epitope, gave similar results, suggesting that the protein distribution is not influenced by the position or sequence of the tag. The pattern was clearly distinct from those observed with antibodies that recognize specific markers of the endoplasmic reticulum (calnexin), lysosomes (cathepsin B and D), or mitochondria (mito-green fluorescent protein (mito-GFP) (34Kneen M. Farinas J. Li Y.X. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1591-1599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar) and COX IV) (data not shown). NHE7HA also did not appear to accumulate at the cell surface nor was it able to functionally complement a mutant strain of CHO cells lacking plasmalemmal NHE activity (35Rotin D. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C1158-C1165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown).Figure 4Subcellular localization of human NHE7HA in stably transfected EcR-CHO cells. To define the subcellular distribution of NHE7HA, EcR-CHO cells were treated with a suboptimal concentration of ponasterone A (5 μm) for 24 h. Subsequently, the cells were incubated in the absence (A–C) or presence (D–F) of 5 μg/ml brefeldin A for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and dual labeled with a mouse monoclonal antibody to the HA epitope (NHE7HA) followed by Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (A, D, and G) and a rabbit polyclonal antibody to the endogenous Golgi cisternae marker α-mannosidase II (α-man II) followed by Oregon Green-conjugated secondary antibody (B andE). In certain experiments, NHE7-induced cells were transiently transfected (24-h period) with the TGN marker CD25-TGN38, and the chimeric protein was detected by FITC-conjugated anti-CD25 antibody (H). Composite images of the dual labels are shown in C, F, and I. Scale bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The comparatively broader immunofluorescence signal of NHE7HA relative to that of α-mannosidase II suggested that it may be present in compartments distal to the Golgi cisternae, such as the TGN and possibly endosomes. To define further NHE7 compartmentation, cells were treated with different pharmacological agents that are known to affect the Golgi, TGN, and endosomes differentially. The fungal metabolite brefeldin A causes the disassembly of the Golgi apparatus by promoting the retrograde absorption and dispersion of Golgi cisternae resident proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum (36Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar, 37Lippincott-Schwartz J. Donaldson J.G. Schweizer A. Berger E.G. Hauri H.P. Yuan L.C. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1990; 60: 821-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar), thereby creating a mixed endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi compartment. It concomitantly induces the coalescence of the TGN with early endosomes into a dense juxtanuclear tubulovesicular structure (38Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L. Tipper C. Amherdt M. Orci L. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1991; 67: 601-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 39Wood S.A. Park J.E. Brown W.J. Cell. 1991; 67: 591-600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, pretreatment of cells with brefeldin A (5 μg/ml for 2 h at 37 °C) dispersed the immunofluorescence signal of α-mannosidase II (Fig. 4, E and F) into a reticular pattern, whereas that of NHE7HA (Fig. 4, D andF) was largely retained in a compact juxtanuclear complex, with a minor fraction diffusely distributed throughout the cell. These data suggest that NHE7HA is concentrated primarily in the TGN/early endosomal structure. The location of the TGN was defined by transiently transfecting the cells with an expression vector containing the chimeric gene CD25-TGN38. This chimera, which is composed of the extracellular domain of the α-chain of the interleukin-2 receptor linked to the transmembrane and cytosolic domains of TGN38, has been shown to accumulate in the TGN and can be readily labeled with commercially available FITC-conjugated CD25 antibodies (15Demaurex N.

Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1123-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, G–I, the distribution of NHE7HA precisely overlapped that of CD25-TGN38, suggesting it is predominantly in the TGN.To establish further the compartmentation of NHE7HA, cells were treated with the microtubule-disrupting agent nocodazole, which causes initial dispersion of the TGN and endosomes (early event), followed by the redistribution of the Golgi cisternae (late event), into discrete vesicular compartments throughout the cytoplasm (37Lippincott-Schwartz J.

Cell. 1998; 9: 191-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5, A–C, acute treatment with nocodazole (10 μm for 1 h) caused the TGN marker CD25-TGN38 to scatter in a pattern precisely matching that of NHE7HA, whereas the distribution of α-mannosidase II in the Golgi cisternae remained relatively compact (Fig. 5,D–F). However, after a 4-h exposure to nocodazole, the α-mannosidase II signal also dispersed in a pattern that was distinct from, but partially overlapping, that of NHE7HA (Fig. 5,G–I). In similarly treated cells, endomembrane vesicles containing NHE7HA also did not precisely colocalize with those containing transiently transfected, Myc-tagged NHE3, which is known to accumulate at the cell surface but also in endocytic or recycling endosomal vesicles of CHO cells (41D'Souza S. Garcia-Cabado A., Yu, F. Teter K. Lukacs G. Skorecki K. Moore H.P. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2035-2043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that some NHE7 may be present in the Golgi cisternae but most is situated in the TGN.Figure 5Effect of nocodazole on the subcellular distribution of NHE7HA. Expression of NHE7HA was induced in EcR-CHO cells by 5 μmponasterone A for 24 h. In certain experiments, NHE7-induced cells were transiently transfected (24-h period) with the TGN marker CD25-TGN38. Subsequently, the cells were incubated in the presence of 10 μm nocodazole for 1 h (A–F) or 4 h (G–I) at 37 °C. The cells were then fixed, permeabilized, and dual labeled with a mouse monoclonal antibody to the HA epitope (NHE7HA) followed by Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (A, D, and G), and a FITC-conjugated anti-CD25 antibody (B) or rabbit polyclonal antibody to the endogenous Golgi cisternae marker α-mannosidase II (α-man II) followed by Oregon Green-conjugated secondary antibody (E and H).

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). However, NHE7 does contain putative motifs for Golgi targeting and/or retention, including a unique Ser/Thr-phosphorylatable acidic cluster (542EEPSEEDQNE551) (43Schafer W. Stroh A. Berghofer S. Seiler J. Vey M. Kruse M.L. Kern H.F. Klenk H.D. Garten W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2424-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and a tyrosine-based sequence (556YFRV559) (44Wong S.H. Hong W. J.

Differential localization of NHE7 and NHE6 was further demonstrated biochemically by subcellular fractionation of the endomembrane compartments using differential centrifugation and Western blotting with antibodies that recognize either endogenous or ectopically expressed organelle-specific markers. As shown in Fig. 6, NHE7HA was associated with the microsomal enriched membrane fraction (P100 pellet) isolated from cells that were also transiently transfected with Golgi-targeted green fluorescent protein (g-GFP), a convenient marker for this fraction (34Kneen M. Farinas J. Li Y.X. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 1591-1599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). By contrast, NHE6HA (also stably expressed under the control of the ecdysone-inducible promoter in another CHO cell line) accumulated in the mitochondrion-enriched fraction (P10 pellet), as defined molecularly by the presence of the mitochondrion-specific marker COX IV. Neither NHE7HA nor NHE6HA was present in the soluble fractions (S100) isolated from cells that were transiently transfected with an expression plasmid containing cytoplasmic GFP (c-GFP) as a marker (34Kneen M.

Cell lysates were prepared by mild disruption through a 26.5-gauge needle in 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, in the presence of a proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Nuclei and insoluble cell debris were sedimented by centrifugation at 500 × g. The mitochondrial and microsomal fractions were obtained from the supernatant by sequential centrifugation at 10,000 and 100,000 × g, respectively, and the resulting pellets were isolated and designatedP10 and P100. Each fractionated pellet was resuspended in an identical volume of lysis buffer. The final supernatant fraction (S100) represented the cytosolic fraction. For comparison, parallel subcellular fractionation experiments were conducted using cell lysates prepared from an EcR-CHO cell line stably transfected with human NHE6 tagged with an HA epitope at its C terminus (NHE6HA) following exposure to 5 μm ponasterone A for 24 h. NHE6HA is found in the P10 fraction, consistent with its known accumulation in mitochondria. Additional controls include NHE7HA-expressing cells transiently transfected with an expression vector containing either a cDNA chimeric construct composed of the signal peptide from the Golgi protein human β-1,4-galactosyltransferease linked to GFP (g-GFP) (34Kneen M.

These processes are under control of members of the MyoD family ofbasic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH)1 transcription factors (MyoD, Myf5, Myogenin, and MRF4). These proteins can inhibit cell proliferation, regulate a cascade of muscle-specific gene expression, auto- and cross-regulate their own and each other's expression, and induce muscle differentiation in nonmuscle cells (1Ludolph D.C.

MEF2-proteins are expressed in a wide range of tissues, whereas MEF2C is restricted mainly to skeletal muscle, brain, and spleen. However, MEF2C DNA-binding activity is highly enriched in muscle and neural tissue indicating a critical role in muscle differentiation. Positive and negative regulation of eukaryotic transcription has been shown to be mediated in part by two opposing enzymatic activities, histone acetylases and histonedeacetylases (HDACs) (17Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 615-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 18Xu L. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Whereas histone acetylases are associated with transcriptional activation, deacetylation of histone leads to a compact chromatin structure to which the accessibility of transcriptional activators is impaired, and thereby transcription is repressed. Recently, we and others have shown, that the transcriptional activity of MEF2C is modulated by cofactor recruitment. MEF2C recruits chromatin remodeling factors such as the histone acetylases p300/CBP and P/CAF (19Eckner R. Yao T.P. Oldread E. Livingston D.M.

This recruitment is probably mediated by the coactivator GRIP1, which has been shown to directly interact with MEF2C and to be necessary for MEF2C-dependent gene expression and skeletal muscle differentiation (23Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1209-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Former studies revealed that GRIP1-mediated activation is due to interaction with p300/CBP and P/CAF (24Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W.

Class-I HDACs (HDAC1, -2, and -3) are related to the yeast transcriptional regulator RPD3 (36Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L.

Class-II HDACs (HDAC4, -5, -6, and -7) are related to another yeast transcription factor, Hda1, which was found in a separate complex from RPD3 (41Rundlett S.E. Carmen A.A. Kobayashi R. Bavykin S. Turner B.M. Grunstein M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14503-14508Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). HDAC4 and -5 have been reported to interact directly with MEF2C but also get recruited by corepressors (27Miska E.A. Karlsson C. Langley E. Nielsen S.J. Pines J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5099-5107Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 28Wang A.H. Bertos N.R. Vezmar M. Pelletier N. Crosato M. Heng H.H. Th'ng J. Han J. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell.

In this study we report that the recently identified HDAC7 (43Kao H.Y. Downes M. Ordentlich P. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 55-66PubMed Google Scholar), like other class-II HDACs, represses MEF2-dependent transcription via physical interaction with the MADS domain of MEF2. This repression is dependent on the N-terminal repression domain of HDAC7 and functions independently of the C-terminal deacetylase domain. Furthermore we provide evidence that this functions via the interaction with other corepressors, such as CtBP and class-I and -II HDACs. Finally we demonstrate that the hdac7 mRNA is down-regulated but constitutively expressed during differentiation of muscle cells and that the HDAC7 protein shuttles from the nucleus into the cytoplasm during this process thereby preventing the formation of a MEF2/HDAC7-repressive complex. Pluripotent C310T1/2 cells were cultured for 24 h in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS in 6% CO2 before transfection. Cells grown in 12-well plates to 60–70% confluence were transiently transfected using a DOTAP/DOSPER (3:1) liposome (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) mixture in HEBS (42 mm HEPES, 275 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 0.4 mm Na2HPO4, 11 mm Dextrose, pH 7.1), with 2 μg of total DNA. For elimination of Gal-MEF2C, -A, or -D-mediated transactivation 1 μg of G5-E1b-Luc reporter, 0.3 μg of the respective MEF2 cDNA in the pSV40gal expression vector, and 0.6 μg of HDAC4, -5, or -7 in the pSG5 expression vector/well were used. Empty expression vectors served as controls. The same conditions applied for the experiments carried out with Gal-MyoD and Gal-Myogenin. For elimination of MEF2C-mediated transactivation on MEF2-responsive elements, 1 μg of pGL3-MEF2[×3]-E1b-Luc reporter (or as control, the pGL3-E1b-Luc plasmid without MEF2-binding sites), 0.5 μg of pSG5-MEF2C, and 0.5 μg of pSG5-HDAC4, -5, or -7 were used. Empty SG5 expression plasmid was used as control. Medium was replaced 24 h after transfection, and cells were further grown for 25–48 h before harvesting and assayed for Luciferase activity using the Luclite kit (Packard Instrument Co.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Mouse myogenic C2C12 cells were cultured in growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 20% FCS) in 6% CO2. For differentiation assays, cells were grown confluent, and the media was changed into differentiation medium (DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum), and cells were harvested at the time points indicated. For visualizing intracellular localization of HDAC7, 5 μg of pCMX-HDAC7-YFP were used to transiently transfect proliferating C2C12 myoblasts held in growth medium or C2C12 cells that have been grown in differentiation medium for 48 h. The appropriate medium was replaced after 24 h and cells were incubated for an additional 24 h. YFP-HDAC7 was visualized using standard fluorescence procedures after fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered solution. Cos-7 cells were transfected with expression constructs encoding either full-length FLAG-tagged MEF2C and HA-tagged HDAC4, -5, or -7 as indicated using the FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) liposome reagent. 48 h after transfection cells were lysed in phosphate-buffered solution containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (complete by Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and subjected to brief sonication, and the resultant cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation. Lysates were then incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) for 2 h at 4° C and precipitated by incubation for a further 1 h with protein A/G affinity resin (Pierce). Precipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequently immunoblotted with a rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody (Bab. Co.) Total RNA was extracted by guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method. Northern blots, random priming, and hybridization were performed as described previously (44Burke L. Downes M. Carozzi A. Giguere V. Muscat G.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3481-3489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Downes M. Carozzi A.J. Muscat G.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1666-1678PubMed Google Scholar). The 1.8-kilobase pair HindIII fragment of pCMX-m HDAC7-HA (43Kao H.Y. Downes M. Ordentlich P. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 55-66PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a probe for HDAC7. As a probe for HDAC5 theKpnI/SmaI 1.7-kilobase pair fragment of pCMX-mHDAC5-HA was used. Other cDNA probes have been described previously (23Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1209-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA probes were radioactively labeled by random priming. DNA fragments (200 ng) were boiled with 20 ng of random hexamers (pdN6; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then incubated over night with EcoPol buffer (New England Biolabs), 200 μm dGTP/dTTP, 10 μl [32P]dATP/[32P]dCTP (Bresatec), and 5–10 units of Klenow polymerase (New England Biolabs). Probes were purified using NICK columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. GST and GST fusion proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli (BL21) and purified using glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography as described previously (45Downes M. Carozzi A.J. Muscat G.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1666-1678PubMed Google Scholar, 46Muscat G.E. Rea S. Downes M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1311-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Amounts and integrity of GST fusion proteins were checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining. The TnT-coupled transcription/translation kit (Promega) was used to produce [35S]methionine-labeled proteins. Pulldowns were carried out as described previously (23Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1209-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The class-II HDAC4 and -5 interact with MEF2 and suppress its ability to activate transcription and cell specific differentiation (26Sparrow D.B. Miska E.A. Langley E. Reynaud-Deonauth S. Kotecha S. Towers N. Spohr G. Kouzarides T. Mohun T.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5085-5098Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 27Miska E.A. Karlsson C. Langley E. Nielsen S.J. Pines J. Kouzarides T.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15594-15599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Therefore we tested if the recently discovered HDAC7 (43Kao H.Y. Downes M. Ordentlich P. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 55-66PubMed Google Scholar), which is expressed in a cell-specific manner and colocalizes with other class-I and -II HDACs and corepressors in distinct nuclear compartments, regulates MEF2-mediated transcription. MEF2C is highly expressed in developing skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle cells. Weak expression is detected in endothelial cells and surrounding mesenchyme during embryo development (47Black B.L. Olson E.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 48Edmondson D.G. Lyons G.E. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Development. 1994; 120: 1251-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Lin Q. Lu J. Yanagisawa H. Webb R. Lyons G.E. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Development. 1998; 125: 4565-4574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because HDAC7 and MEF2C are expressed in a similar cell-specific manner, we initially tested the effect of HDAC7 expression on MEF2C activity. MEF2C can activate transcription directly and/or by protein-protein interaction with other DNA bound factors, hence we examined the effect of HDAC7 (relative to HDAC4 and -5) expression on MEF2C-mediated transactivation in the GAL4 hybrid system (Fig.1 A). In these assays the activity of MEF2C is independent of binding to its cognate binding motif, the A/T-rich MEF2 site. If HDAC7 inhibits the transcriptional activity, then the potential of the GAL4-MEF2C fusion to trans-activate gene expression should be significantly reduced in this assay. C3H10T1/2 pluripotent cells were cotransfected with GAL-MEF2C and the G5E1b-LUC reporter in the presence and absence of the class-II HDAC4, -5, and -7. G5E1b-LUC contains five copies of the GAL4 binding site placed upstream of a minimal E1b promoter. Transfection of Gal-MEF2C alone induced transcription ∼10-fold relative to the GAL4 DNA binding domain. This level of activity was significantly repressed by the addition of HDAC4 and -7, whereas no significant effect is seen on the basal activity of the GAL4-expression plasmid. Surprisingly, HDAC5 poorly repressed MEF2C activity at the amounts transfected in this assay. The MEF2 family is composed of a group of proteins encoded by four vertebrate genes mef2a, mef2b, mef2cand mef2d (50Subramanian S.V. Nadal-Ginard B. Mech. Dev. 1996; 57: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). All of these factors bind DNA, recruit cofactors, and trans-activate gene expression in a similar manner. Hence we analyzed the effect of HDAC4, -5, and -7 expression on the transcriptional activation mediated by MEF2A and MEF2D (Fig.1 B). Similarly to the results obtained with MEF2C, we observed that HDAC4 and -7 dramatically reduced the activity of MEF2A and MEF2D. Again, HDAC5 weakly repressed MEF2A and MEF2D (Fig.1 B). Thus class-II HDACs, including HDAC7, repress MEF2-dependent gene expression. The cell culture experiments presented above suggest that HDAC7 inhibits MEF2 activity. Therefore, we examined whether HDAC7 repressed MEF2C-dependent activation of a luciferase reporter with 3 tandem copies of the MEF2 cognate binding sites upstream of a basal E1b promoter (Fig. 1 C). These experiments clearly demonstrate again that HDAC7 represses MEF2C-mediated transactivation of a MEF2-dependent reporter. The specificity of this repression was supported by the inability of class-II HDACs alone to repress the MEF2-dependent reporter (MEF2[×3]-E1b-LUC) and the failure of MEF2C and class-II HDACs to regulate the expression of the vehicle,i.e. the basal E1b promoter linked to luciferase (Fig.1 C). MEF2 proteins belong to the MADS box family of transcription factors that cooperate with the myogenic bHLH proteins, MyoD and Myogenin, in the activation of the contractile protein gene expression and function within a regulatory network that establishes the differentiated phenotype. Therefore, we investigated whether HDAC7 regulates the transactivation of gene expression mediated by myogenic bHLH proteins. C310T1/2 cells were transfected with Myogenin or MyoD fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 and examined for the effect of class-II HDAC expression on the activity of these transcriptional activators. We observed that neither HDAC4, -5, or -7 had any significant effect on the activity of these bHLH factors (Fig. 1 D). This data suggest that HDAC7 specifically represses the activity of the MADS box proteins, MEF2A, -C, and -D, but not that of the bHLH factors, MyoD and Myogenin. HDAC7 functions as a negative regulator of myogenesis by inhibiting MEF2-dependent gene expression and transactivation dependent on the cooperative function between MEF2 and the MyoD family of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors. This correlates with the observations that have been made with HDAC4 and -5 (26Sparrow D.B. Miska E.A. Langley E. Reynaud-Deonauth S. Kotecha S. Towers N. Spohr G. Kouzarides T. Mohun T.J.

The class-II HDACs have been reported to directly interact with the N terminus of MEF2 in vivoand in vitro (26Sparrow D.B. Miska E.A. Langley E. Reynaud-Deonauth S. Kotecha S. Towers N. Spohr G.

COS-7 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged MEF2C (amino acids 1–117), HA-tagged HDAC7, and the other class-II HDACs (HDAC4 and -5). Coimmunoprecipitation with the FLAG-antibody demonstrates that ectopic MEF2C interacts with HA-HDAC7, as well as with HDAC4 and -5 in vivo (Fig.2 A). The regulation of MEF2-dependent transcription by the class-II HDACs and the demonstration of interaction between these factors in the immunoprecipitation assay strongly suggests that these proteins interact by a direct mechanism. However, it does not completely eliminate the possibility of an indirect mechanism in which additional factor(s) mediate the interaction, although we postulated that HDAC7 represses MEF2C activity/function by direct interaction. We tested this hypothesis using a biochemical approach, the in vitro GST pulldown assay to confirm the direct interaction between MEF2C and HDAC7. Glutathione-agarose-immobilized GST-MEF2C was tested for direct interaction with in vitro 35S-radiolabeled native HDAC7 (Fig. 2 B). Native HDAC7 showed a very strong direct interaction with GST-MEF2C relative to GST alone, suggesting a direct protein/protein interaction between these two transcription factors as it has been shown for HDAC4 and -5 (29Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar,31Lemercier C. Verdel A. Galloo B. Curtet S. Brocard M.P. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15594-15599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To delimit the minimal region of HDAC7 required to mediate the interaction with MEF2C we incubated a number of 35S-labeled C-terminal unidirectional deletions of HDAC7 with GST-MEF2C. We observed that the N-terminal fragment of HDAC7 encompassing amino acids 1–121 is sufficient to interact with MEF2C (Fig. 2 B). This fragment encodes repression domain 1 of HDAC7 and contains a highly conserved motif of 17 amino acids (Fig. 2 C), which has been shown to be necessary for the interaction of HDAC4 and -5 with the MEF2 proteins (29Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). We used the in vitro GST pulldown assay to confirm the direct interaction between MEF2C and GST-HDAC7 and to identify the domain in MEF2C that mediates the interaction with this class-II HDAC. Glutathione-agarose-immobilized GST-HDAC7 was tested for direct interaction with in vitro 35S-radiolabeled native MEF2C, MEF2C-(58–465), MEF2C-(90–465), MEF2C-(1–223) and, MEF2C-(1–177). Native MEF2C showed a very strong interaction with GST-HDAC7 relative to GST alone. In contrast, MEF2C-(58–465) and MEF2C-(90–465) that, respectively, lacked the MADS box and MADS box/MEF2 domains failed to interact with HDAC7 (Fig.3). This indicated that the MADS box is crucial for HDAC7 interaction as it has been shown for the interaction with HDAC4 and -5 (26Sparrow D.B. Miska E.A. Langley E. Reynaud-Deonauth S. Kotecha S.

In support of this result the C-terminal deletions (MEF2C-(1–223) and, MEF2C-(1–177)) that contained the MADS box efficiently interacted with HDAC7. HDACs have been shown to repress transcription at least partially via deacetylation of histones but also to harbor other repression domains (43Kao H.Y. Downes M. Ordentlich P. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 55-66PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore we were interested to examine whether the down-regulation of MEF2-mediated transactivation via HDAC7 requires the enzymatic deacetylation activity. Two deletion mutants of HDAC7 that still interact with MEF2C but lack the HDAC domain (amino acids 1–372 and 1–121; Fig. 2) and a point mutation in the HDAC domain that interferes with the ability to deacetylase histones (H657A, Ref. 51Downes M. Ordentlich P. Kao H.Y. Alvarez J.G. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10330-10335Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) were tested for their influence on MEF2C-mediated transactivation. Interestingly, these mutants were also able to inhibit MEF2C-mediated transactivation and did not interfere with the full-length HDAC7 (Fig.4 A). No significant effect of HDAC7 mutants or the full-length construct was observed on the basal activity when no MEF2C was transfected (Fig. 4 B). Because HDAC7 mutants and deletions lacking deacetylase function are able to repress MEF2C-mediated transactivation we wanted to gain an insight in how RD1 and RD2 of HDAC7 mediate repression. We therefore tested if HDAC7 interacts with other class-I and -II HDACs and corepressors as it has been shown for HDAC -4 and -5. GST pulldown experiments using bacterial expressed GST-HDAC7 and in vitro-translated 35S-labeled class-I and -II HDACs or the corepressor CtBP demonstrate that HDAC7 interacts with all tested HDACs (-1, -2, -4, -5, and -7) as well as with the corepressor CtBP (Fig. 5). This observation provides evidence that HDAC7-mediated repression of MEF2 activity requires the recruitment of corepressors and other class-I and -II HDACs. This is consistent with the identification of a distinct matrix-associated nuclear structure that contains corepressors (SMRT, members of the Sin 3 and NuRD complexes), class-I and -II HDACs (43Kao H.Y. Downes M. Ordentlich P. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 55-66PubMed Google Scholar,51Downes M. Ordentlich P. Kao H.Y. Alvarez J.G. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10330-10335Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Furthermore the interaction of CtBP with HDAC7 correlates with several observations that demonstrate that HDAC4, MITR, and Cabin-1 constitute a family of calcium-sensitive transcriptional repressors of MEF2 and recruit CtBP via the PXDLR motif conserved in the N-terminal region of HDAC4, -5, and -7 (32Youn H.D.

To gain insight into how class-II HDACs regulate MEF2C-dependent gene activation during muscle differentiation, we examined the expression pattern of the mRNAs encoding HDAC5 and -7 during the conversion of mouse myoblast C2C12 cells into terminal differentiated myotubes. Proliferating C2C12 myoblasts were induced to biochemically and morphologically differentiate into postmitotic, multinucleated myotubes by serum withdrawal in culture over a period of 4–120 h. Total RNA was isolated from proliferating myoblasts, confluent myoblasts, and postmitotic myotubes after 4, 8, 24, 48, 72, and 120 h of serum withdrawal and examined by Northern blot analysis. The mRNAs for HDAC7 and -5 are expressed in proliferating myoblasts and suppressed as the cells exit the cell cycle and fuse into terminal differentiated myoblasts that have acquired a muscle-specific phenotype (Fig.6 A). The repression of thecyclinD1 mRNA and the induction of the mRNAs encoding myogenin and p21 relative toGAPDH confirms that these cells were exiting from the cell cycle and activating the differentiation program. However, expression of the class-II HDACs is still observed in postmitotic cells. If the HDAC7 protein acts as a transcriptional repressor of MEF2-mediated gene activation it should be found in the nucleus when MEF2/differentiation-dependant genes are inactive. During myogenesis, when these genes are activated, HDAC7 should be unable to suppress the function of MEF2 in the context of HDAC7 expression in postmitotic differentiated cells. The HDAC7 function as a repressor of MEF2 activity must be overcome by another mechanism such as cellular trafficking, localization, and/or proteolytic degradation. Observations reported by others have shown that other class-II HDACs dissociate from MEF2 proteins and shuttle into the cytoplasm in differentiation involving calcium/calmodulin and 14–3-3-dependent phosphorylation (27Miska E.A. Karlsson C. Langley E. Nielsen S.J. Pines J. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5099-5107Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 29Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Mol.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7835-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). To address this question we transfected C2C12 myoblasts with a construct encoding a fusion protein of HDAC7 and the yellow fluorescent protein (pCMX-HDAC7-YFP) and examined its sub-cellular localization in C2C12 cells cultured in growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 20% FCS) or differentiation medium (DMEM supplemented with 2% horse serum), which leads to withdrawal from the cell cycle and the induction of the differentiation program. As seen in Fig. 6 B, HDAC7-YFP is predominantly localized in the nucleus when cells were held in growth medium. After 48 h of serum withdrawal (i.e. culturing in 2% horse serum), the HDAC7 protein is localized within the cytoplasm, where it cannot form an inhibitory complex with MEF2 factors. This observation provides a plausible mechanism for the regulation of MEF2 function during muscle differentiation: serum withdrawal leads to nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking of HDAC7 and therefore allows the differentiation process to proceed. The class-II HDACs are very homologous to each other and show many similar features in the context of transcriptional regulation; however, they are different proteins with (i) unique amino acid sequences and (ii) spatio-temporal-specific expression patterns. Currently, it still remains unclear what their specific roles in vivo are and whether functional redundancy occurs in the class-II HDACs."

Previously, we demonstrated that RACK1 also interacts with the Src protein-tyrosine kinase. RACK1, via its association with these protein kinases, may play a key role in signal transduction. To further characterize the Src-RACK1 interaction and to analyze mechanisms by which cross-talk occurs between the two RACK1-linked signaling kinases, we identified sites on Src and RACK1 that mediate their binding, and factors that regulate their interaction. We found that the interaction of Src and RACK1 is mediated, in part, by the SH2 domain of Src and by phosphotyrosines in the sixth WD repeat of RACK1, and is enhanced by serum or platelet-derived growth factor stimulation, protein kinase C activation, and tyrosine phosphorylation of RACK1.

Identification of Src-binding proteins has led to better understanding of Src regulation and has provided clues about the function of Src in normal and transformed cells. For example, characterization of the interaction between Src and polyoma middle T antigen led to discovery of a fundamental mechanism by which the cellular Src protein is converted to a transforming protein (by dephosphorylation at Tyr-527) and defined the requirement of Src for polyoma transformation (2Courtneidge S.A.

EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2359-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus, characterization of a single Src-binding protein contributed substantially to our understanding of both RNA and DNA tumor biology. Recently, using the unique domain/SH2/SH3 domain of Src as bait, and a human lung fibroblast cDNA library as prey, we identified RACK1, a known intracellular receptor for activatedCkinase (RACK),1 as a Src-binding protein (8Chang B.Y. Conroy K.B. Machleder E.M. Cartwright C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3245-3256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that overexpression of RACK1 inhibited the specific activity of Src tyrosine kinases (as measured in vitro) and the growth of NIH 3T3 cells. RACK1 exerted its effect on growth, in part, by prolonging the G0/G1phase of the cell cycle. RACK1 was the first of a group of proteins (collectively called RACKs) to be identified and characterized by Mochly-Rosen and co-workers (reviewed in Refs. 9Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 10Mochly-Rosen D. Kauvar L.M. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 44: 91-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 11Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). RACK1 has sequence homology with the β subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins. RACK1 and Gβ are both members of an ancient family of regulatory proteins made up of highly conserved repeating units usually ending with Trp-Asp (WD) (reviewed in Refs. 12Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholarand 13Neer E.J. Smith T.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 175-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). WD repeat proteins are functionally diverse, although all seem to be regulatory and few are enzymes. The WD repeats in RACK1 are conserved from Chlamydomonas to human (reviewed in Ref. 13Neer E.J. Smith T.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 175-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Thus, the function of RACK1 was probably fixed before the evolutionary divergence of plants and animals. Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of serine/threonine kinases whose activity depends upon phospholipid, diacylglycerol, and in some case on calcium (reviewed in Refs. 9Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 10Mochly-Rosen D. Kauvar L.M. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 44: 91-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 11Mochly-Rosen D.

Upon stimulation with tumor promoter phorbol esters or hormones that increase intracellular concentrations of diacylglycerol, PKCs become activated and translocate to new subcellular sites where they phosphorylate isozyme-specific substrates. Individual, activated, PKC isozymes are translocated to distinct compartments, suggesting that they mediate distinct cellular functions (9Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 10Mochly-Rosen D. Kauvar L.M. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 44: 91-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 11Mochly-Rosen D.

Chem. 1999; 274: 27039-27046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). RACKs interact only with activated forms of PKCs, suggesting that PKC binding to RACK occurs after cell stimulation, to localize the active enzyme to the RACK site (reviewed in Refs. 9Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 10Mochly-Rosen D. Kauvar L.M. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 44: 91-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 11Mochly-Rosen D. Gordon A.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Moreover, there are isozyme-specific RACKs, which presumably anchor each PKC isozyme close to its physiologic substrate. For example, in cardiac myocytes RACK1 is specific for βIIPKC, whereas RACK2 is specific for εPKC (15Ron D. Jiang Z. Yao L. Diamond I. Gordon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27039-27046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 16Ron D. Chen C.H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 29200-29206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the specificity of PKC function may be determined, in part, by the different locations of isozyme-specific RACKs. The observation that RACK1 interacts with two, distinct, cytoplasmic protein kinases raises interesting questions about the role of RACK1 in orchestrating the intersection of tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase signaling pathways. The purpose of this study was to further characterize the Src-RACK1 interaction and to begin to analyze the mechanism by which cross-talk occurs between two RACK1-linked signaling protein kinases. We found that the interaction of Src and RACK1 is mediated by the SH2 domain of Src and phosphotyrosines in the sixth WD repeat of RACK1, and is enhanced by serum, PDGF stimulation, PKC activation, and tyrosine phosphorylation of RACK1.

Glutathione-agarose beads (30 μl) were added, and the mixture was incubated with gentle rocking for 2 h at at 4 °C. Proteins were eluted from the beads, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-RACK1, as described above. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to substitute phenylalanine for tyrosine at residues 52, 140, 194, 228, 246, or 302 of RACK1, utilizing the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and the following oligonucleotides: Y52F oligo, GATGAGACCAACTTTGGAATTCCA; Y140F oligo, GGTGTGTGCAAATTCACTGTCCAG; Y195F oligo, CACACAGGCTTTCTGAACACGGTG; Y228F oligo, GGCAAACACCTTTTCACGCTAGAT; Y246F oligo, CCTAACCGCTTCTGGCTGTGTGCT; Y302F oligo, CTGTTTGCTGGCTTCACGGACAAC. The sequence of each RACK1 mutant was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing (Protein and Nucleic Acid Facility, Stanford University, Stanford, CA). Mutant RACK1 genes were inserted into pcDNA3 to create pcDNA3-HA-RACK1(Y52F, Y140F, Y195F, Y228F, Y246F, or Y302F) as described (8Chang B.Y. Conroy K.B. Machleder E.M. Cartwright C.A. Mol. Cell.

Control cells were treated with Me2SO alone. NIH 3T3 cells that were stably overexpressing the PDGFR were maintained in 0.5% serum for 48 h before treatment with PDGF-BB (Sigma) (10 ng/ml) for various time periods. For immunoblot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine PY20, cells were treated with 100 μm sodium vanadate (Sigma) for 30 min prior to harvesting (8Chang B.Y. Conroy K.B. Machleder E.M. Cartwright C.A.

https://openalex.org/W1986938385,"The CCCH family of tandem zinc finger proteins has recently been shown to promote the turnover of certain mRNAs containing class II AU-rich elements (AREs). In the case of one member of this family, tristetraprolin (TTP), absence of the protein in knockout mice leads to stabilization of two mRNAs containing AREs of this type, those encoding tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. To begin to decipher the mechanism by which these zinc finger proteins stimulate the breakdown of this class of mRNAs, we co-transfected TTP and its related CCCH proteins into 293 cells with vectors encoding full-length TNFα, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and interleukin-3 mRNAs. Co-expression of the CCCH proteins caused the rapid turnover of these ARE-containing mRNAs and also promoted the accumulation of stable breakdown intermediates that were truncated at the 3′-end of the mRNA, even further 5′ than the 5′-end of the poly(A) tail. To determine whether an intact poly(A) tail was necessary for TTP to promote this type of mRNA degradation, we inserted the TNFα ARE into a nonpolyadenylated histone mRNA and also attached a histone 3′-end-processing sequence to the 3′-end of nonpolyadenylated interleukin-3 and TNFα mRNAs. In all three cases, TTP stimulated the turnover of the ARE-containing mRNAs, despite the demonstrated absence of a poly(A) tail. These studies indicate that members of this class of CCCH proteins can promote class II ARE-containing mRNA turnover even in the absence of a poly(A) tail, suggesting that the processive removal of the poly(A) tail may not be required for this type of CCCH protein-stimulated mRNA turnover.

DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) is the prototype of a small family of zinc finger proteins characterized by a pair of closely spaced zinc fingers of the CCCH type. Although TTP was originally thought to be a probable transcription factor, we have recently shown that TTP and related proteins can promote the turnover of certain mRNAs containing AU-rich elements (AREs) in their 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs). Using cells derived from TTP-deficient mice, we showed that TTP is a physiological inhibitor of the secretion of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) (6Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (7Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 1891-1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an effect mediated by TTP's ability to destabilize the mRNAs encoding both proteins. TTP mediates this effect after initially binding to the ARE in the 3′-UTRs of these mRNAs (6Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 1891-1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). In transfection experiments, the known vertebrate TTP-related proteins had similar effects to promote the breakdown of these ARE-containing mRNAs (9Lai W.S. Carballo E. Thorn J.M. Kennington E.A. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17827-17837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). TTP and its related proteins bind to the ARE of these mRNAs and then appear to promote their initial destruction from the 3′-end. This results in a decrease in total hybridizable mRNA levels as well as the formation of what appear to be mRNA bodies missing their poly(A) tails (9Lai W.S. Carballo E. Thorn J.M. Kennington E.A. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17827-17837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether TTP achieves this effect by stimulating the initial 3′ to 5′ processive deadenylation of these mRNAs, by stimulating another 3′-exonuclease, or by some other mechanism (e.g. an ARE-dependent endonuclease activity). The current view of ARE-dependent destruction of mRNAs containing so-called class II AREs is that there is first processive deadenylation of the poly(A) tail, presumably by one or more poly(A)-specific exonucleases, followed by further exonucleolytic and perhaps endonucleolytic degradation of the mRNA body after removal of the protective poly(A) tail (10Xu N. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4611-4621Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Many proteins have been found to be capable of forming protein-ARE complexes in cell-free assays (for reviews, see Refs. 11Wilson G.M. Brewer G. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 257-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar and 12Mitchell P. Tollervey D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 193-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar); however, few ARE-binding proteins have been shown to participate in the destabilization of class II ARE-containing mRNAs in intact cells. TTP and its related proteins cMG-1 and TIS11d can all stimulate the degradation of class II ARE-containing mRNAs in cell transfection studies (9Lai W.S. Carballo E. Thorn J.M. Kennington E.A. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17827-17837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In an attempt to further elucidate the mechanism by which the CCCH proteins destabilize ARE-containing mRNAs, we have tested the hypothesis that TTP can promote degradation of class II ARE-containing mRNAs that do not have a poly(A) tail. We show here that TTP can stimulate the degradation of a nonpolyadenylated histone mRNA when a class II ARE is inserted into this mRNA and that TTP can stimulate the breakdown of mRNAs that normally contain a class II ARE but in which a histone 3′-end-processing sequence has replaced the normal poly(A) tail. CMV.mTNFα-(127–1325), containing aNarI–XbaI fragment spanning bp 127–1325 of a mouse TNFα cDNA sequence (GenBankTM accession numberX02611), was made as described (8Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). The mTNFα cDNA clone, provided by Dr. B. Beutler (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX), contained an incomplete 3′-UTR that ended at bp 1325 of GenBankTM accession number X02611, with 33 adenylate residues attached to the last T. This sequence is shown in Fig. 1 of Ref. 9Lai W.S. Carballo E. Thorn J.M. Kennington E.A. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol.

To make CMV.mTNFα-(1–1627), a full-length cDNA coding for the mouse TNFα mRNA sequence was prepared by RT-PCR using total cellular RNA from RAW 264.7 cells treated for 4 h with 1 μg/ml of lipopolysaccharide as the template for RT. This TNFα cDNA spanned bp 1–1627 of GenBankTMaccession number X02611 and contained the naturally occurring polyadenylation signal at bp 1614–1619. The 5′ primer for PCR amplification was 5′-gtcgacCTCAGCGAGGACAGCAAGG-3′, and the 3′ primer was 5′-tctagaAGCGATCTTTATTTCTCTC-3′. The capital letters in the 5′ primer contain the 5′-end of the TNFα mRNA, and the capital letters in the 3′ primer contain the 3′-end of the mRNA. The lowercase letters in the primers indicate the restriction sites forSalI and XbaI, respectively. CMV.mGM-CSF was constructed by RT-PCR using total cellular RNA from RAW 264.7 cells treated for 4 h with 1 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide as the template for RT. The 5′ primer for PCR amplification was 5′-gtcgacACTCAGAGAGAAAGGCTAAGG-3′, and the 3′ primer was 5′-tctagaAAAGTTTTAATAATTTATTATTCTGG-3′. The capital letters in the 5′ primer contain the beginning of exon I of the mouse GM-CSF gene (bp 1136–1156 of GenBankTM accession number X03020), and those in the 3′ primer contain the end of exon IV (bp 3481–3506 of GenBankTM accession number X03020). The lowercase letters in the primers indicate the restriction sites for SalI andXbaI, respectively. The resulting PCR product is a 775-bp mouse GM-CSF cDNA. The IL-3 expression vector CMV.mIL-3 was prepared by RT-PCR using total cellular RNA from WEHI-3 cells as the template for RT. The 5′ primer for PCR amplification was 5′-gtcgacAGAACCCCTTGGAGGACCAG-3′, and the 3′ primer was 5′-ccgcggTGTTCAAAGTTATTTATTTCC-3′. The capital letters in the 5′ primer contain the 5′-end of exon I of the mouse IL-3 gene (bp 695–714 of GenBankTM accession number K03233), and those in the 3′ primer contain the 3′-end of exon V (bp 2869–2889 of GenBankTM accession number K03233). The lowercase letters in the primers indicate the restriction sites forSalI and SstII, respectively. The resulting PCR product is an 851-bp mouse IL-3 cDNA. The resulting PCR products of these full-length cDNAs were digested with SalI and XbaI (for mTNFα-(1–1627) and mGM-CSF) or with SalI and SstII (for mIL-3) and cloned into the SalI and XbaI sites or theSalI and SstII sites of the vector pSK−, which contains the human CMV promoter-enhancer (9Lai W.S.

The correct sequences of the 1627-bp mouse TNFα, the 775-bp mouse GM-CSF, and the 851-bp mouse IL-3 cDNA inserts were confirmed by dRhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Plasmid H2a-614, which contains sequence corresponding to bp 1–1645 of GenBankTM accession number X16148 (mouse histone H2a gene; Ref. 13Hurt M.M. Chodchoy N. Marzluff W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 8876Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), was purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). To create plasmid CMV.H2a, plasmid H2a-614 was used as a template. A 549-bp fragment (bp 814–1362 of X16148) containing the H2a precursor RNA (bp 814–1328 ofX16148) and the sequence of the histone downstream element (bp 1342–1355 of X16148) was PCR-amplified with the following primers: 5′ primer, 5′-gtcgacCGTTTCCTGGTTGTGGCC-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-ccgcggCTACCGTGACACAACTC-3′. The lowercase letters in the primers denote restriction sites for SalI and SstII, respectively. This PCR product was then inserted into the same sites of plasmid vector CMV/SK− (8Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 D). The correct sequence of the PCR product and the correct orientation of H2a sequence in relationship to the CMV promoter were verified by dRhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing. To create plasmid CMV.H2a (EN), b1166 of X16148 was mutated from C to A, and b1167 was mutated from G to T, to make an EcoRV restriction site in the H2a sequence using the PCR primer-overlapping mutagenesis technique. Plasmids CMV.H2a (mTNFα) (containing bp 1281–1350 of GenBankTM accession number X02611), CMV.H2a (mGM-CSF) (containing bp 3399–3467 of GenBankTM accession number X03020), and CMV.H2a (mIL-3) (containing bp 2738–2770 of GenBankTM accession number K03233) were constructed by inserting the sequences coding for the AREs of these mRNAs into theEcoRV site of plasmid CMV.H2a (EN). Plasmid CMV.H2a (AX75) was constructed by inserting a blunt-ended 75-bp fragment containing the multiple cloning site sequence (from the Asp718 toXbaI sites) from plasmid vector SK- into theEcoRV site of CMV.H2a (EN). The mouse IL-3 expression vector CMV.mIL-3 (H2aSL), in which the polyadenylation signal was replaced by the 3′-end stem-loop sequence of mouse histone H2a, was created as follows. Using the PCR primer-overlapping mutagenesis technique (14Lai W.S. Thompson M.J. Taylor G.A. Liu Y. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25266-25272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the sequence in the 3′-UTR of mIL-3, ggaAATAAAtaa, which contained the normal IL-3 mRNA polyadenylation signal (in capital letters), was mutated to ggaAAGATAtca (mutated bases in italic type) to include an EcoRV restriction site (gatatc). A 60-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide, flanked by the EcoRV sequence, which encoded the histone H2a stem-loop and histone downstream element (bp 1303–1362 of GenBankTM accession number X16148), was inserted into this newly created EcoRV site in CMV.mIL-3. In the mTNFα expression vector CMV.mTNFα-(127–1325 H2aSL), the 33 adenylate residues attached to the last T (bp 1325 of GenBankTM accession number X02611) of CMV.mTNFα were deleted using the PCR primer-overlapping mutagenesis technique. AnXbaI restriction site was also created in the same process. The 60-bp double-stranded oligonucleotide coding for the histone H2a stem-loop and histone downstream element was inserted into this newly created XbaI site at the end of CMV.mTNFα-(127–1325). The correct orientation of the histone sequence was confirmed by dRhodamine terminator cycle sequencing. HEK 293 cells were maintained, and transient transfection of 1.2 × 106 cells with plasmid constructs in calcium-phosphate precipitates was performed as described (9Lai W.S. Carballo E. Thorn J.M. Kennington E.A. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17827-17837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In some experiments, pXGH5 (Nichols Institute Diagnostics, San Juan Capistrano, CA) was co-transfected to monitor transfection efficiency. Assays of released human growth hormone (HGH) were performed as described (14Lai W.S. Thompson M.J. Taylor G.A. Liu Y. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25266-25272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In most experiments, the cells were co-transfected with various CCCH protein-expressing plasmids. Details of the construction of these plasmids have been described (8Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell.

Twenty-four h after the removal of the transfection mixture, aliquots of cell culture medium were analyzed for HGH according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total cellular RNA was then harvested from the HEK 293 cells using the RNeasy system (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Northern blots were prepared as described (1Lai W.S. Stumpo D.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16556-16563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blots were hybridized as indicated with random-primed, α-32P-labeled cDNA probes coding for various CCCH zinc finger proteins, including mouse TTP (1Lai W.S. Stumpo D.J. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16556-16563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Xenopus XC3H-3 (15De J. Lai W.S. Thorn J.M. Goldsworthy S.M. Liu X. Blackwell T.K. Blackshear P.J.

Blots were also hybridized as indicated with a ∼1-kbNarI–BglII fragment of a mTNFα cDNA (8Lai W.S. Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), a 422-bp SalI–EcoRV 5′ fragment of mouse GM-CSF cDNA (from plasmid CMV.mGM-CSF), and a 468-bpSalI–XbaI 5′ fragment of mouse IL-3 cDNA (from plasmid CMV.mIL-3). Some blots were also hybridized to an α-32P-labeled GAPDH cDNA probe (6Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to monitor gel loading. RNase H assays were performed by annealing total cellular RNA (5–10 μg) and the appropriate synthetic oligonucleotide (0.5–1 μg) in 10 μl of 50 mm KCl for 5 min at 50 °C, followed by an additional 10 min at 22 °C. The mixture was incubated further at 37 °C for 40 min in a buffer (4 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin) containing 1 unit of RNase H (Promega, Madison, WI) in a final volume of 25 μl. The reaction mixture was then precipitated with sodium acetate and ethanol, and the resulting RNA was subjected to Northern analysis as described above. Our previous transfection experiments in 293 cells examined the effects of TTP and related proteins on the turnover of a synthetic TNFα mRNA construct, in which 33 A residues encoded by the vector were attached to the middle of the ARE. In the present experiments, we wished to confirm that TTP and related proteins would exert similar effects on three naturally occurring mRNAs that contain class II AREs in their 3′-UTRs: TNFα, GM-CSF, and IL-3. As in our previous studies, we used human genomic and cDNA clones encoding TTP, the rat cMG1 cDNA as the representative of the cMG1/TIS11b/ERF1/Berg36 protein, and theXenopus XC3H-3 cDNA as the representative of the TIS11d/ERF2 protein. When these three CCCH proteins were each individually co-expressed with a human TNFα cDNA that was truncated at both the 5′- and 3′-ends (bases 127–1325 of accession number X02611) in 293 cells, all three proteins caused a decrease in steady state levels of TNFα mRNA at low concentrations (9Lai W.S. Carballo E. Thorn J.M. Kennington E.A. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17827-17837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). A characteristic finding was that increasing concentrations of transfected DNA encoding these CCCH proteins resulted in the accumulation of a truncated species of the TNFα mRNA, which we have shown previously to be truncated at the 3′-end. An example of this type of experiment using the TNFα clone truncated at both ends is shown in the upper panel of Fig.2 A, lanes 1–5; the corresponding levels of CCCH protein mRNAs are shown in the lower panel. Compared withlane 1, which shows the steady state level of TNFα mRNA in cells transfected with vector DNA instead of the CCCH protein DNA, lane 2 shows the characteristic decrease in total hybridizable TNFα mRNA that occurs with low level expression of TTP, achieved in this case by the co-transfection of the genomic human TTP clone (5 μg DNA); the low level of TTP mRNA expression achieved with this concentration of the genomic clone DNA is shown in lane 2, lower panel. At higher levels of CCCH mRNA expression, TTP, cMG1, and XC3H-3 (at 1 μg of DNA/plate) all caused the characteristic disappearance of the upper band of TNFα mRNA and the accumulation of the lower band that we previously identified as a deadenylated species. When the identical experiment was repeated with a 5′-truncated version of TNFα that contained the full 3′-end, the pattern of TNFα hybrizidation was somewhat different. In cells transfected with vector alone and no CCCH protein constructs (Fig. 2 A,lane 6, upper panel), the TNFα mRNA appeared as two closely spaced bands; the upper band, representing the expressed full-length cDNA, was partially obscured by the 18 S ribosomal RNA. The lower of the two bands was shown by RNase H experiments using oligo(T) primers to be the deadenylated form of the mRNA (data not shown). In the presence of expressed CCCH proteins, however (lanes 8–10), a third band appeared that was of identical size to the 3′-truncated mRNA shown in lanes 3–5. Because the 5′-end of this construct was the same as that of the construct used forlanes 1–5, we conclude that the 3′-truncation of the TNFα mRNA caused by expression of the CCCH proteins was to approximately the same location as that seen in the truncated mRNA used in lanes 1–5. The same experiment was performed with a TNFα construct that was full-length in both the 5′- and 3′-ends, bases 1–1627 of accession number X02611 (lanes 11–15 of theupper panel, Fig. 2 A). In this case, the full-length TNFα mRNA in the control lane (lane 11) was obscured by the ribosomal RNA. Nonetheless, it was still possible to detect a decrease in the amount of the full-length TNFα mRNA when co-expressed with the CCCH proteins, with accumulation of a 3′-truncated band of larger size than that seen with the other two TNFα constructs, compatible with its 127-base increase in length. We concluded that the truncated form of TNFα seen after expression of each of the three CCCH proteins was likely to be truncated to approximately position 1325 in the TNFα clone (i.e. at the middle of the class II ARE). To confirm that the effect of the co-transfected CCCH proteins was to remove this 3′-end, several of the RNA samples shown in Fig. 2 A were hybridized with a probe spanning bases 1370–1627 of accession number X02611 (Fig.2 B). This probe represents a sequence entirely 3′ of the ARE (which occurs between bases 1299 and 1332) and includes the polyadenylation signal (bases 1614–1619). As expected, this probe did not hybridize to any TNFα mRNA species when the 127–1325 TNFα clone was transfected, either in the absence (lane 1) or the presence (lane 2) of co-transfected TTP. However, the probe readily hybridized to the two bands representing the longer TNFα mRNA species, either 127–1627 (lanes 6–10) or 1–1627 (lanes 11–15). This result confirms that the shortest of the three major TNFα species generated in response to CCCH protein expression in Fig. 2 A represents a 3′-truncated form of TNFα mRNA that is missing not only the poly(A) tail but also sequences between the poly(A) tail and the ARE. Similar experiments were performed with full-length cDNAs encoding GM-CSF and IL-3. In the case of GM-CSF, we have demonstrated in experiments with wild-type and TTP-deficient mice that turnover of this mRNA is regulated by TTP in bone marrow stromal cells (7Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 1891-1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, no comparable physiological function of TTP has been demonstrated to date in the regulation of IL-3 mRNA stability. In the case of GM-CSF mRNA, low concentrations of transfected TTP, cMG1, and XC3H-3 DNA (Fig. 3 A,lanes 2, 5, and 8) all stimulated a decrease in mRNA steady state levels, whereas higher DNA concentrations again resulted in the accumulation of at least two smaller species of GM-CSF mRNA. Cleaner results were obtained when the cells were treated for 1–8 h with actinomycin D to inhibit ongoing transcription (Fig. 3 B). This experiment compared the effects of no TTP, the genomic TTP construct H6E (5 μg DNA), and low concentrations of the TTP expression construct CMV.hTTP.tag (0.1 μg of DNA) on the levels of GM-CSF mRNA species without (lanes 1–3) or with actinomycin D treatment for various times. The expression of GAPDH mRNA is shown in themiddle panel, and the expression of TTP mRNA in the same samples is shown in the bottom panel. The 8-h actinomycin D samples showed that, in the cells expressing vector alone (lane 13), the GM-CSF mRNA appeared as a large, diffuse band. The amount of this species was greatly decreased in cells expressing TTP (lanes 14 and 15). In cells expressing the genomic TTP clone, most of the hybridizing GM-CSF species appeared to be full-length, whose levels were markedly decreased compared with control (compare lane 14 with lane 13). Also detectable were low levels of two smaller forms of GM-CSF mRNA when this TTP construct was expressed (seelanes 2, 5, 8,11, and 14). However, when the TTP cDNA was expressed, there was a marked decrease in total hybridizable GM-CSF mRNA, and the remaining mRNA was in the form of the shortest of the three hybridizing bands. RNase H and oligo(dT) experiments demonstrated that the single band observed in lane 15 was considerably shorter than the completely deadenylated form of the full-length mRNA (not shown), again consistent with a GM-CSF mRNA that was truncated in a 3′ to 5′ direction to approximately the position of the ARE. Parallel experiments were performed with full-length IL-3 mRNA. This mRNA is considerably smaller than the 18 S ribosomal RNA, making the results of Northern analysis easier to interpret. As shown in Fig. 4 A (top panel), the IL-3 mRNA was expressed as a single diffuse band that appeared as a tightly spaced pair of bands following a shorter autoradiographic exposure (lane 1). Steady state levels of this mRNA were markedly decreased by TTP co-expression, either from the genomic clone H6E (5 μg of DNA;lane 2) or from low concentrations of the expression construct CMV.hTTP.tag (0.1 μg of DNA; lane 3). Levels were also markedly reduced by co-expression of higher concentrations of either cMG1 (1 μg of DNA; lane 4) or XC3H-3 (1 μg of DNA; lane 5). In all cases in which the CCCH proteins were expressed, but most obviously with cMG1, there was a decrease in the intensity of the upper two bands and the appearance of a third band. These changes were more obvious after transcription was inhibited with actinomycin D. For example, the tightly spaced doublet of IL-3 mRNA from cells transfected with vector (lane 16) largely disappeared with expression of the CCCH proteins, with the appearance of a smaller stable intermediate being apparent in the cMG1 lanes (lanes 4, 9, 14, and19). To determine the polyadenylation status of these forms of the IL-3 mRNA, total cellular RNA samples from this experiment were incubated with an oligo(dT) primer and RNase H (Fig. 4 B). The samples shown in lanes 1–4 correspond tolanes 16–20 of Fig. 4 A; the samples shown in lanes 5–8 represent the same samples after oligo(dT) and RNase H treatment. These results indicate that the smaller of the two tightly spaced bands in the IL-3 doublet was the deadenylated form of the mRNA (dA), while the upper of the two bands is the full-length polyadenylated form (FL; comparelane 1 with lane 5). However, the still smaller band that was most evident in the cMG1 samples (lane 3) was not further reduced in size by the oligo(dT)/RNase H treatment (P; lane 7) and represents a further 3′-truncated mRNA. That this was not a 5′ truncation of the mRNA was shown by similar RNase H experiments using an internal primer complementary to bp 868–889 of accession number K03233. In this case, identical 173-base mRNA fragments corresponding to the 5′-end of the IL-3 mRNA were found in both samples from control and TTP-expressing cells (data not shown). As with the TNFα and GM-CSF data, these results are compatible with a CCCH protein-mediated 3′-truncation of the mRNA that was greater than that seen with deadenylation alone. All three further truncations appeared to be approximately at the location of the ARE in these mRNAs. To confirm the ARE-dependence of the TTP-stimulated degradation of the full-length IL-3 mRNA, we co-transfected cells with genomic and cDNA TTP vectors in the presence of IL-3 mRNA that contained (Fig. 4 C, lanes 1–6) or did not contain (lanes 7–12) the ARE. As before, both TTP expression vectors resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in IL-3 mRNA expression, with the higher concentrations of TTP achieved with the cDNA expression vector resulting in accumulation of the lowest of the three IL-3 mRNA bands. When these experiments were repeated with the IL-3 mRNA lacking its ARE, the co-expression of TTP had no effect on the total level of IL-3 mRNA and did not stimulate the formation of the lowest mRNA band.

In addition to LDLR, mammalian members of this family include the LDLR-related protein (LRP), the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), the apolipoprotein E receptor-2 (apoER2), and megalin. Herein we have analyzed the endocytic functions of the cytoplasmic tails of these receptors using LRP minireceptors, its chimeric receptor constructs, and full-length VLDLR and apoER2 stably expressed in LRP-null Chinese hamster ovary cells. We find that the initial endocytosis rates mediated by different cytoplasmic tails are significantly different, with half-times of ligand internalization ranging from less than 30 s to more than 8 min. The tail of LRP mediates the highest rate of endocytosis, whereas those of the VLDLR and apoER2 exhibit least endocytosis function. Compared with the tail of LRP, the tails of the LDLR and megalin display significantly lower levels of endocytosis rates. Ligand degradation analyses strongly support differential endocytosis rates initiated by these receptors. Interestingly apoER2, which has recently been shown to mediate intracellular signal transduction, exhibited the lowest level of ligand degradation efficiency. These results thus suggest that the endocytic functions of members of the LDLR family are distinct and that certain receptors in this family may play their main roles in areas other than receptor-mediated endocytosis.

The low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)1 family includes five members in mammals: the LDLR itself, the apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (apoER2), the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), the LDLR-related protein (LRP), and megalin (1Krieger M.

LDLR, VLDLR, and apoER2 have molecular masses of ∼130 kDa, whereas LRP and megalin are significantly larger with molecular masses of ∼600 kDa. There are several structural modules that are present in each member of the LDLR family. These modules include 1) ligand-binding repeats of ∼40 amino acids that include six cysteine residues forming three disulfide bonds; 2) epidermal growth factor precursor repeats, which also contain six cysteines residues each; and 3) modules of ∼50 amino acids with a consensus tetrapeptide, Tyr-Trp-Thr-Asp (YWTD). In addition to these extracellular modules, each of these receptors also contains a single transmembrane domain and a relatively short cytoplasmic tail with potential endocytosis signals (1Krieger M.

A cluster of several complement-type ligand binding repeats constitutes a ligand-binding domain, and differential clustering of these repeats within a domain may impart specificity with respect to ligand recognition (3Hussain M.M.

The epidermal growth factor precursor homology domains and YWTD repeats are necessary for the dissociation of ligands from the receptor in endosomes (6Davis C.G. Goldstein J.L. Sudhof T.C.

Ligand interactions with all members of the LDLR family can be antagonized by a receptor-associated protein (RAP), a unique ligand frequently used as a tool in the study of ligand-receptor interaction (8Bu G. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). RAP also functions intracellularly as a molecular chaperone to facilitate receptor folding and trafficking within the early secretory pathway (8Bu G. Curr. Opin.

A common characteristic of the LDLR family members is that at least one copy of the NPXY sequence is found within their cytoplasmic tails. For LDLR, this NPXY motif serves as a signal for receptor endocytosis through coated pits (4Chen W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we recently reported that the YXXL motif, but not the two NPXY sequences, within the cytoplasmic tail of LRP serves as the dominant signal for receptor-mediated endocytosis (5Li Y.

We also demonstrated that the distal dileucine motif and a serine phosphorylation within the LRP tail contribute to receptor endocytosis (5Li Y. Marzolo M.P. van Kerkhof P. Strous G.J. Bu G. J. Biol.

These results suggest that each member of the LDLR family may utilize different potential signal(s) within their cytoplasmic tails for receptor-mediated endocytosis.In the present study, we have directly compared the endocytic functions of the members of the LDLR family using LRP minireceptors, its chimeric receptor constructs, and full-length VLDLR and apoER2 stably expressed in LRP-null Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. We find that the initial endocytosis rates mediated by the cytoplasmic tails of the LDLR family members differ significantly, suggesting that members of the LDLR family may play their main roles in either receptor-mediated endocytosis or signal transduction.DISCUSSIONAll members of LDLR family are recognized as cell surface endocytisis receptors. However, the endocytosis rates mediated by these receptors are unclear. In the present study, we provide direct evidence that there are distinct differences in endocytic functions among the tails of the LDLR family members. We found that the tail of LRP supports the most efficient endocytosis, whereas LDLR tail and megalin tail display reduced endocytosis rates compared with LRP tail, while VLDLR and apoER2 exhibit minimal endocytosis function.It is not surprising that among all members of the LDLR family examined, the LRP tail supports receptor endocytosis to the greatest degree. LRP belongs to the class of receptors that undergo constitutive endocytosis in the presence or absence of ligand. This feature may be determined by the constant exposure of its endocytosis signals and is highlighted by its cell surface distribution concentrated within clathrin-coated pits (5Li Y. Marzolo M.P. van Kerkhof P. Strous G.J. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17187-17194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 38Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Geuze H. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29874-29882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tail of LRP consists of 100 amino acid residues and contains multiple potential endocytosis signals including two NPXY, one YXXL, and two dileucine motifs. Our recent studies indicate that the YXXL motif within the cytoplasmic tail of LRP serves as the dominant signal for LRP endocytosis. Furthermore, the distal dileucine motif and a serine phosphorylation in its cytoplasmic tail also contributes to the endocytosis of LRP (21Li Y. van Kerkhof P. Marzolo M.P. Strous G.J. Bu G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 1185-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). At present, it has been reported that LRP can bind and internalize over 20 structurally and functionally distinct ligands. In this report, we have demonstrated that LRP possesses extremely fast endocytosis rate, which is consistent with its major function as a clearance receptor.In the present study, we found that the endocytosis rates mediated by mLRP4-LDLR, mLRP4-megalin, VLDLR, and apER2 are significantly lower than that of mLRP4T100. One common characteristic of the LDLR family members is that each contains at least one copy of the NPXY sequence within the cytoplasmic tail. The tails of LDLR, VLDLR, and apoER2 contains one copy of the NPXY sequence, whereas the megalin tail contains two copies of the NPXY sequence. The NPXY motif in the LDLR has been shown to serve as a signal for receptor endocytosis through coated pits (4Chen W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the NPXY motifs within the tails of VLDLR, apoER2, and megalin also function as their dominant endocytosis signals.In contrast to other family members, we found that the tails of VLDLR and apoER2 support limited endocytosis. Recently, it has been demonstrated that VLDLR and apoER2 serve as obligate components in Reelin/Dab1-mediated neuronal migration (10Trommsdorff M. Borg J.P. Margolis B. Herz J. J. Biol.

Mice that lack the genes for both VLDLR and apoER2 demonstrate a neurological and neuroanatomical phenotype that is indistinguishable from that seen in animals deficient in either Reelin or Dab1 (11Trommsdorff M.

Thus, signal transduction is likely the main function of VLDLR and apoER2.It is worthy of note that compared with other members of the LDLR family, apoER2 exhibits extremely low level of ligand degradation efficiency. This observation is in agreement with previous report by Sun and Soutar (37Sun X.M. Soutar A.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), who found that β-VLDL was poorly degraded by apoER2 or its spliced variants compared with LDLR. The mechanistic basis thereof is not presently known. apoER2 shows high homology to both the LDLR and VLDLR, including the positions of the exon/intron boundaries of the genes (41Kim D.H. Magoori K. Inoue T.R. Mao C.C. Kim H.J. Suzuki H. Fujita T. Endo Y. Saeki S. Yamamoto T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8498-8504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The most notable difference between the tail of apoER2 and that of LDLR or VLDLR is the presence of an additional 59 amino acid residues encoded by an additional exon (19Kim D.H. Iijima H. Goto K.

This domain has been recently reported to interact with two members of the JUK-interacting protein family, JIP-1 and JIP-2 (JUK-interacting protein1 and 2). These molecules belong to a group of mitogen-activated protein kinase scaffolding proteins (13Gotthardt M. Trommsdorff M. Nevitt M.F. Shelton J. Richardson J.A. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25616-25624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 14Stockinger W Brandes C. Fasching D. Hermann M. Gotthardt M. Herz J. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25625-25632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The interaction with JIPs is specific for apoER2, because neither LDLR nor VLDLR bind (14Stockinger W Brandes C. Fasching D. Hermann M. Gotthardt M. Herz J. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25625-25632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest apoER2 is a unique cell surface receptor within the LDLR family with its main function likely in mediating signal transduction.Recent studies have suggested new roles for LDLR family members as transducers of extracellular signals (9Herz J. Gotthardt M. Willnow T.E. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For example, several cytoplasmic adaptor and scaffold proteins containing protein interacting domain or PSD-95/DLG/Z0-1 domains, including Dab1, Dab2, FE65, JIP-1, JIP-2, PSD-95, CAPON, and SEMCAP-1, bind to the cytoplasmic tails of members of the LDLR family (10Trommsdorff M.

J. 2000; 347: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Thus, the present studies extend our understanding of the differences in the biological activities of members of the LDLR family. Rapid receptor internalization mediated by receptors such as LRP may result in rapid desensitization of signals initiated by receptor ligation, whereas slower endocytosis mediated by the VLDLR and apoER2 may allow for more sustained signal transduction upon ligand binding. The low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)1 family includes five members in mammals: the LDLR itself, the apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (apoER2), the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), the LDLR-related protein (LRP), and megalin (1Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar, 2Strickland D.K. Kounnas M.Z. Argraves W.S. FASEB.

LDLR, VLDLR, and apoER2 have molecular masses of ∼130 kDa, whereas LRP and megalin are significantly larger with molecular masses of ∼600 kDa. There are several structural modules that are present in each member of the LDLR family. These modules include 1) ligand-binding repeats of ∼40 amino acids that include six cysteine residues forming three disulfide bonds; 2) epidermal growth factor precursor repeats, which also contain six cysteines residues each; and 3) modules of ∼50 amino acids with a consensus tetrapeptide, Tyr-Trp-Thr-Asp (YWTD). In addition to these extracellular modules, each of these receptors also contains a single transmembrane domain and a relatively short cytoplasmic tail with potential endocytosis signals (1Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar, 2Strickland D.K. Kounnas M.Z. Argraves W.S. FASEB.

Chem. 2000; 275: 17187-17194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). A cluster of several complement-type ligand binding repeats constitutes a ligand-binding domain, and differential clustering of these repeats within a domain may impart specificity with respect to ligand recognition (3Hussain M.M. Strickland D.K. Bakillah A. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The epidermal growth factor precursor homology domains and YWTD repeats are necessary for the dissociation of ligands from the receptor in endosomes (6Davis C.G. Goldstein J.L. Sudhof T.C. Anderson R.G. Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Nature. 1987; 326: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 7Mikhailenko I. Considine W. Argraves K.M. Loukinov D. Hyman B.T. Strickland D.K. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3269-3281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ligand interactions with all members of the LDLR family can be antagonized by a receptor-associated protein (RAP), a unique ligand frequently used as a tool in the study of ligand-receptor interaction (8Bu G. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). RAP also functions intracellularly as a molecular chaperone to facilitate receptor folding and trafficking within the early secretory pathway (8Bu G. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Traditionally, all members of the LDLR family have been regarded as cell surface endocytosis receptors that function in delivering their ligands to lysosomes for degradation (1Krieger M. Herz J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 601-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar, 2Strickland D.K. Kounnas M.Z. Argraves W.S. FASEB.

However, recent studies have revealed new roles for these receptors in signal transduction (9Herz J. Gotthardt M. Willnow T.E. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A set of cytoplasmic adaptor and scaffold proteins containing protein interaction domain or PSD-95/DLG/Z0-1 domains have been shown to bind to the cytoplasmic tails of members of the LDLR family (10Trommsdorff M.

Mice that lack the genes for both VLDLR and apoER2 demonstrate a neurological and neuroanatomical phenotype that is indistinguishable from that seen in animals deficient in either Reelin or Dab1 (11Trommsdorff M.

Thus, signal transduction is likely the main function of VLDLR and apoER2.It is worthy of note that compared with other members of the LDLR family, apoER2 exhibits extremely low level of ligand degradation efficiency. This observation is in agreement with previous report by Sun and Soutar (37Sun X.M. Soutar A.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), who found that β-VLDL was poorly degraded by apoER2 or its spliced variants compared with LDLR. The mechanistic basis thereof is not presently known. apoER2 shows high homology to both the LDLR and VLDLR, including the positions of the exon/intron boundaries of the genes (41Kim D.H. Magoori K.

The most notable difference between the tail of apoER2 and that of LDLR or VLDLR is the presence of an additional 59 amino acid residues encoded by an additional exon (19Kim D.H. Iijima H. Goto K.

This domain has been recently reported to interact with two members of the JUK-interacting protein family, JIP-1 and JIP-2 (JUK-interacting protein1 and 2). These molecules belong to a group of mitogen-activated protein kinase scaffolding proteins (13Gotthardt M. Trommsdorff M. Nevitt M.F. Shelton J. Richardson J.A. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Herz J. J.

The interaction with JIPs is specific for apoER2, because neither LDLR nor VLDLR bind (14Stockinger W Brandes C. Fasching D. Hermann M. Gotthardt M. Herz J. Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25625-25632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest apoER2 is a unique cell surface receptor within the LDLR family with its main function likely in mediating signal transduction.Recent studies have suggested new roles for LDLR family members as transducers of extracellular signals (9Herz J. Gotthardt M. Willnow T.E. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For example, several cytoplasmic adaptor and scaffold proteins containing protein interacting domain or PSD-95/DLG/Z0-1 domains, including Dab1, Dab2, FE65, JIP-1, JIP-2, PSD-95, CAPON, and SEMCAP-1, bind to the cytoplasmic tails of members of the LDLR family (10Trommsdorff M.

J. 2000; 347: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Thus, the present studies extend our understanding of the differences in the biological activities of members of the LDLR family. Rapid receptor internalization mediated by receptors such as LRP may result in rapid desensitization of signals initiated by receptor ligation, whereas slower endocytosis mediated by the VLDLR and apoER2 may allow for more sustained signal transduction upon ligand binding. All members of LDLR family are recognized as cell surface endocytisis receptors. However, the endocytosis rates mediated by these receptors are unclear. In the present study, we provide direct evidence that there are distinct differences in endocytic functions among the tails of the LDLR family members. We found that the tail of LRP supports the most efficient endocytosis, whereas LDLR tail and megalin tail display reduced endocytosis rates compared with LRP tail, while VLDLR and apoER2 exhibit minimal endocytosis function. It is not surprising that among all members of the LDLR family examined, the LRP tail supports receptor endocytosis to the greatest degree. LRP belongs to the class of receptors that undergo constitutive endocytosis in the presence or absence of ligand. This feature may be determined by the constant exposure of its endocytosis signals and is highlighted by its cell surface distribution concentrated within clathrin-coated pits (5Li Y. Marzolo M.P. van Kerkhof P. Strous G.J. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17187-17194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 38Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Geuze H. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29874-29882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tail of LRP consists of 100 amino acid residues and contains multiple potential endocytosis signals including two NPXY, one YXXL, and two dileucine motifs. Our recent studies indicate that the YXXL motif within the cytoplasmic tail of LRP serves as the dominant signal for LRP endocytosis. Furthermore, the distal dileucine motif and a serine phosphorylation in its cytoplasmic tail also contributes to the endocytosis of LRP (21Li Y. van Kerkhof P. Marzolo M.P. Strous G.J. Bu G. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 1185-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). At present, it has been reported that LRP can bind and internalize over 20 structurally and functionally distinct ligands. In this report, we have demonstrated that LRP possesses extremely fast endocytosis rate, which is consistent with its major function as a clearance receptor. In the present study, we found that the endocytosis rates mediated by mLRP4-LDLR, mLRP4-megalin, VLDLR, and apER2 are significantly lower than that of mLRP4T100. One common characteristic of the LDLR family members is that each contains at least one copy of the NPXY sequence within the cytoplasmic tail. The tails of LDLR, VLDLR, and apoER2 contains one copy of the NPXY sequence, whereas the megalin tail contains two copies of the NPXY sequence. The NPXY motif in the LDLR has been shown to serve as a signal for receptor endocytosis through coated pits (4Chen W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the NPXY motifs within the tails of VLDLR, apoER2, and megalin also function as their dominant endocytosis signals.

Recently it was reported that YopP/J is a member of an ubiquitin-like protein cysteine protease family and that the catalytic core of YopP/J is required for its inhibition of the MAPK and NF-κB pathways. Here we analyzed the YopP/J-induced apoptotic signaling pathway. YopP-mediated cell death could be inhibited by addition of the zVAD caspase inhibitor, but not by DEVD or YVAD. Generation of truncated Bid (tBid) was the first apoptosis-related event that we observed. The subsequent translocation of tBid to the mitochondria induced the release of cytochrome c, leading to the activation of procaspase-9 and the executioner procaspases-3 and -7. Inhibition of the postmitochondrial executioner caspases-3 and -7 did not affect Bid cleavage. Bid cleavage could not be observed in ayopP-deficient Y. enterocolitica strain, showing that this event requires YopP. Disruption of the catalytic core of YopP abolished the rapid generation of tBid, thereby hampering induction of apoptosis by Y. enterocolitica. This finding supports the idea that YopP/J induces apoptosis by directly acting on cell death pathways, rather than being the mere consequence of gene induction inhibition in combination with microbial stimulation of the macrophage.

By this mechanism, bacteria adhering at the surface of eukaryotic cells inject proteins in the cytosol of these cells. In the archetypal Yersinia, Yersinia pestis, the agent of bubonic plague, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, andYersinia enterocolitica, the injected proteins are called Yops. Yops are encoded by a large virulence plasmid, and their main target seems to be the macrophage (for review see Ref. 1Cornelis G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8778-8783Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). One of the Yops, called YopP in Y. enterocolitica and YopJ in Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. pestis, causes a variety of effects, such as suppression of tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)1 and interleukin-8 production, as the result of blockade of the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinases (MKKs), MAPK, and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) (2Boland A.

YopJ-induced apoptosis by Y. pseudotuberculosis has also been observed during an experimental mouse infection thereby showing that apoptosis plays a role in the establishment of a systemic infection (9Monack D.M.

YopP/J interacts with IKKμ and MKKs, and recently it has been suggested that YopP/J belongs to a family of cysteine proteases related to the ubiquitin-like protein proteases (6Orth K. Palmer L.E.

Ubiquitin-like protein proteases cleave the C terminus of an 11-kDa small ubiquitin-related modifier SUMO-1. The protease YopJ was shown to reduce the cellular concentration of SUMO-1-conjugated proteins in an overexpression experiment; however, no direct substrate of YopJ was yet identified. Mutation of the YopJ catalytic cysteine results in the loss of its protease activity and hampers its capacity to inhibit NF-κB and MKK activation. It has been suggested that YopP/J-induced apoptosis is due to its capability of inhibiting the activation of NF-κB (5Ruckdeschel K. Harb S. Roggenkamp A. Hornef M. Zumbihl R. Kohler S. Heesemann J. Rouot B. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1069-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanism by which YopP/J induces apoptosis is not yet known. One of the earliest and most consistently observed features of apoptosis is the activation of procaspases, a family of cysteine proteases that cleave their substrates after an aspartic acid residue (11Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4115) Google Scholar). Caspases are synthesized as zymogens (procaspases) that become activated via proximity-induced autoproteolysis by interaction with adaptor proteins or by cleavage via upstream proteases in an intracellular cascade (12Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1054-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 13Van de Craen M. Declercq W. Van den Brande I. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P.

Immunol. 1999; 17: 331-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). Two main procaspase activation pathways during apoptosis have been proposed: (i) the extrinsic activation of initiator procaspases, triggered by the formation of a receptosome complex; and (ii) the intrinsic activation of initiator procaspases, initiated by the formation of an apoptosome complex. The extrinsic activation of initiator procaspases is initiated by the death domain-containing receptors of the TNF receptor superfamily (14Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V.

Biochem. 1998; 254: 439-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Binding of the ligand to the cell surface receptor leads to trimerization (16Banner D.W. D'Arcy A. Janes W. Gentz R. Schoenfeld H.J. Broger C. Loetscher H. Lesslauer W. Cell. 1993; 73: 431-445Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar) of the receptors and subsequently oligomerization of their cytosolic death domains eventually leading to the recruitment of initiator procaspases, such as procaspase-8. This complex is called the death-inducing signaling complex (17Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). During this process caspase-8 can initiate cell death by directly cleaving the downstream executioner procaspases-3, -6, and -7 (13Van de Craen M. Declercq W. Van den Brande I. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1117-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 18Muzio M. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2952-2956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In some cases, however, the death-inducing signaling complex does not generate sufficient caspase-8 levels to allow efficient proteolytic activation of the downstream executioner procaspases, and amplification of the caspase cascade by mitochondrial-derived factors is required to kill the cell (19Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2620) Google Scholar). A molecular link connecting the death-inducing signaling complex activation and mitochondria is the caspase-8-mediated cleavage of Bid, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. The C-terminal part of Bid (tBid) translocates to the mitochondria, where it induces the release of cytochrome c (20Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 22686-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), which leads to recruitment and autoactivation of procaspase-9. In turn, caspase-9 activates procaspases-3, -6, and -7, thus initiating the caspase cascade (23Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar). The consecutive activation of both initiator procaspases, procaspase-8 at the level of the death receptor complex and procaspase-9 at the postmitochondrial level, then leads to sufficient activation of the executioner procaspases resulting in cell demise. Intrinsic activation of procaspases, triggered by environmental insults, senescence, and developmental programs, involves the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to the cytosol leading to assembly and activation of the apoptosome complex igniting the caspase cascade. The mechanism by which this cytochrome c release is induced is not yet clear. In this report we describe that activation of procaspases is essential in Y. enterocolitica YopP-mediated cell death. Moreover, YopP-mediated apoptosis initiates the cell death pathway upstream of the cytosolic protein, Bid. Bid cleavage results in the subsequent release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria eventually leading to the activation of procaspase-9 and the executioner procaspases-3 and -7. The cleavage of Bid and the release of cytochromec can both be inhibited by broad-spectrum caspase inhibitors, suggesting that YopP induces activation of upstream caspases, most likely caspase-8. Finally, we provide evidence that the protease activity of YopP is crucial for the induction of apoptosis in macrophages by Yersinia. Escherichia coli DH5α was used for standard manipulations. E. coli SM10 λpir+ (24Miller V.L. Mekalanos J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2575-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar) was used to deliver mobile plasmids in Y. enterocolitica. Y. enterocolitica E40(pYV40) is a wild type, low virulence strain from serotype O:9 (25Sory M.P. Boland A. Lambermont I. Cornelis G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11998-12002Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Y. enterocolitica E40(pMSK41) is a yopP knockout (yopP23 allele) of E40(pYV40) (7Mills S.D. Boland A. Sory M.P. van der Smissen P. Kerbourch C. Finlay B.B. Cornelis G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12638-12643Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). E40(pAB409) is a multiknockout mutant of E40(pYV40) unable to produce YopH, -O, -P, -E, -M, and -B (2Boland A. Cornelis G.R. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1878-1884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Y. enterocolitica A127(pYV127) is a wild type, high virulence strain from serotype O:8 (2Boland A. Cornelis G.R. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1878-1884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ichinohe H. Yoshioka M. Fukushima H. Kaneko S. Maruyama T. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1991; 29: 846-847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pMSK13 is a mobilizable plasmid containingyopPE40WT (from the pYV plasmid of Y. enterocolitica E40). Plasmid pRB16 is a derivative of pMSK13 encoding yopPE40C172T in which the catalytic cysteine is replaced by a threonine. The mutant was engineered by site-directed mutagenesis as described by Kunkel et al. (27Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4557) Google Scholar) using the mutation primer 5′-ACTAAAAATACCGGTTTCAGATGAGCT-3′, which introduces aPinA1 restriction site (underlined). Plasmids pMSK13 and pRB16 were used to complement the yopP knockout mutation. For reasons of clarity, strains E40(pMSK41)(pMSK13) and E40(pMSK41)(pRB16) will be referred to as YopPE40WT+ and YopPE40C172T+ strains. Plasmid pGD2 was obtained by cloningyopPA127WT, the wild type yopP gene from strain A127, into the eukaryotic expression vector pEF6Myc/His vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in frame with the Myc and His tags, using EcoRI and NotI sites. pCDNA1-TRADDE was described elsewhere (28Carpentier I. Beyaert R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). pCDNA1-FADDE was constructed in a similar way as pCDNA1-TRADDE by fusing the human FADDE. pEF1-Bid was made by cloning the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction fragment of full-length Bid (from mouse lung mRNA) in the pEF1V5/His vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). pIKK2FLAG, an expression vector for IKK2/IKKμ, was a generous gift from Drs. J. Schmitt and R. de Martin (University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria). Bacteria were pregrown overnight in brain-heart infusion (Difco) before infection bacteria were diluted 1/20 in fresh brain-heart infusion and cultured under continuous shaking (110 rpm) for 120 min at room temperature; subsequently the bacteria were induced for Yop secretion by incubation for 30 min in a shaking water bath (110 rpm) at 37 °C. Prior to infection bacteria were washed with RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Murine monocyte-macrophage J774A.1 cells (ATCC TIB67) were cultured at 37 °C under 6% CO2 in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mml-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin sulfate (100 μg/ml), sodium pyruvate (1 mm), and μ-mercaptoethanol (2 × 10−5m). Unless otherwise indicated, macrophages were seeded in medium without antibiotics at a density of 105/cm2 15 h before infection. Macrophages were infected with Y. enterocolitica grown under conditions for moderate Yop induction at 37 °C (see above) with a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 50. J774A.1 macrophages were seeded at 5 × 105 cells in 24-well tissue culture plates on glass coverslips, 15 h in advance of infection. 100 μm of the caspase peptide inhibitors (Calbiochem) benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone (zVAD.fmk), benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone (B-D.fmk), acetyl-Tyr-Val-Ala-Asp-chloromethylketone (Ac-YVAD.cmk), benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp(OMe)-Glu(OMe)-Val-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone (zDEVD.fmk), and benzyloxycarbonyl-Ala-Ala-Asp-chloro-methylketone (zAAD.cmk) were added 2 h before infection. Infection of the macrophages was done as described above. Immunofluorescence detection of fragmented genomic DNA was performed using a terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-digoxigenin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay, essentially as described by Mills et al. (7Mills S.D. Boland A. Sory M.P. van der Smissen P. Kerbourch C. Finlay B.B. Cornelis G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12638-12643Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Cell morphology was analyzed by light microscopy. Cell extracts were prepared by lysing the cells in a buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.3 mm aprotinin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Caspase activity was determined by incubation of cell lysates (containing 40 μg of total protein) with 50 μm of the fluorogenic substrate acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aminomethylcoumarin (Ac-DEVD-amc) (Peptide Institute Inc., Osaka, Japan) in 150 μl of cell-free system buffer, comprising 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 220 mmmannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 2 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm pyruvate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mmdithiothreitol (13Van de Craen M. Declercq W. Van den Brande I. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1117-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The release of fluorescent aminomethylcoumarin was measured by fluorometry and expressed as fluorescence increase per min (ΔF/min). (Cytoflor; PerSeptive Biosystems, Cambridge, MA). For analysis of YopP, cytochrome c release, and procaspase and Bid cleavage, macrophages were infected with Y. enterocolitica or were left untreated as a control. After 3 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), resuspended in 0.002% digitonin (RBI, Natick, MA) PBS, and incubated for 3 min on ice. Cell membranes and organelles were pelleted by centrifugation (15,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C). Subsequently, 50 μg of cytosolic protein or an equivalent of 2.5 × 104 cells were loaded per lane on 15% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose (BA 83; Schleicher & Schüll, Dassel, Germany), which was then probed with a rabbit polyclonal anti-YopP antiserum, mouse monoclonal antibody to cytochromec (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), polyclonal antisera raised against recombinant murine caspases-3 or -7 (29Vercammen D. Brouckaert G. Denecker G. Van de Craen M. Declercq W. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), and polyclonal rabbit anti-murine caspase-9 antiserum (cell signaling technology; New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) or probed at 4 °C with a polyclonal goat serum raised against Bid (R & D Systems, Abingdon, UK). The anti-YopP antiserum was raised against purified YopP produced in strain E40(pAB409)(pMSK13), affinity purified on nitrocellulose-bound YopP, and concentrated by passing through a protein G column (Mab kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Primary antibody binding was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, goat anti-rabbit IgG, or rabbit anti-goat IgG (DAKO A/S, Glostrup, Danmark) for cytochrome c, caspases and YopP, and Bid, respectively, and visualized by enhanced chemiluminscence as described in the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). HEK293T cells (1.5 × 106) were seeded in 9-cm Petri dishes. The next day cells were transfected via the calcium phosphate precipitation method with 2 μg of pCDNA1-TRADDE, pCDNA1-FADDE, pEF1-Bid, or pIKK2FLAG (coding for IKKμ), in the absence or presence of 2 μg of pEF6M/H-YopPA127WT. Empty vector was added to a total amount of 5 μg of DNA for each transfection. 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm aprotinin, and 1 mm leupeptin, and lysates were incubated for 5 h with 2.4 μg of anti-Myc-tagged antibody (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). Immune complexes were incubated for 1 h with protein A-Trisacryl beads, which were subsequently washed five times with lysis buffer. Coprecipitating proteins were separated by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blotting with horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-E-tagged antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), anti-Bid antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-goat antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or anti-FLAG-tagged antibody (Sigma) followed by horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), depending on the plasmid transfected. Protein bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminscence as described in the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Previous results indicated that YopP/J is required forYersinia to induce apoptosis in macrophages (7Mills S.D. Boland A. Sory M.P. van der Smissen P. Kerbourch C. Finlay B.B. Cornelis G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12638-12643Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 8Monack D.M. Mecsas J. Ghori N. Falkow S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10385-10390Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). To determine whether procaspase activation was involved in YopP/J-mediated apoptosis, J774A.1 macrophages were pretreated with various irreversible caspase inhibitors prior to infection with E40(pMSK41)(pMSK13), a Y. enterocolitica yopP knockout strain overproducing YopPE40WT (YopPE40WT+). Ac-YVAD.cmk and zDEVD.fmk are specific inhibitors that bind to the active site of caspase-1 and caspases-3/-7, respectively, whereas B-D.fmk is a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, and zVAD.fmk is a rather specific inhibitor of the apoptosis-related initiator caspases, caspases-8 and -9 (30Ekert P.G. Silke J. Vaux D.L. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1081-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). zAAD, a granzyme B inhibitor, was used as a control. As shown in Fig.1 A, YopP-mediated apoptosis is characterized by the induction of membrane blebbing and nuclear condensation and fragmentation. Treatment of macrophages with the caspase inhibitors zDEVD.fmk or Ac-YVAD.cmk or the granzyme B inhibitor zAAD.cmk prior to Y. enterocolitica infection could not prevent YopP-mediated apoptotic cell death. Nevertheless, incubation with zDEVD.fmk resulted in the complete inhibition of intracellular DEVDase activity, as determined by a fluorogenic substrate assay (data not shown). In contrast, pretreatment of the cells with the caspase inhibitors zVAD.fmk and B-D.fmk completely prevented YopP-mediated cell death. Similar results were obtained when analyzing DNA fragmentation in these cultures by means of TUNEL staining (Fig. 1 B). Incubation of the cells with the inhibitor alone did not alter their survival rate (data not shown). These results suggest that YopP/J kills macrophages by activating procaspases, but inhibition of caspase-1, -3, or -7 activity cannot prevent the execution of apoptosis. To determine the molecular mechanism ofYersinia-mediated apoptosis we examined the intracellular events taking place by means of a time kinetics experiment evaluating procaspase activation, Bid cleavage, and cytochrome crelease. J774A.1 macrophages were infected with the wild type Y. enterocolitica A127 (pYV127) strain or with the virulence plasmid-cured isogenic strain (pYV127−), and at different time intervals cytosolic fractions of these cultures were prepared. Non-infected cells served as a control. YopP could be detected in the macrophage cytosol in substantial amounts as soon as 40 min after co-incubation of cells with bacteria (Fig.2 A). The first apoptosis-related intracellular event that we were able to monitor was Bid cleavage (Fig. 2 B). Bid does not contain a transmembrane domain and is located in the cytosol. Cytosolic Bid was cleaved to a 13-kDa fragment (tBid), and the concentration of tBid gradually increased from 60 min on to 80 min after infection of the macrophages. Bid protein is a specific proximal substrate of caspase-8 in the signaling pathway to apoptosis (20Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3774) Google Scholar, 21Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3068) Google Scholar). We were not able to analyze endogenous procaspase-8 expression and/or activation in J774A.1 cells because of the lack of anti-murine caspase-8 antibodies with sufficient detection efficiency. It has been described that the C-terminal fragment of Bid translocates from the cytosol to the mitochondrial membrane, a process that finally leads to the release of cytochrome c (20Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3774) Google Scholar, 21Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3068) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c release became evident 20 min after the generation of tBid in the cell (Fig.2 B). The release of cytochrome c results in a rapid assembly of the apoptosome complex as witnessed by the processing of procaspase-9 to its enzymatically active p35/p37 subunits, eventually leading to the activation of the downstream executioner procaspases-3 and -7 (Fig. 2 C). This activation of the apoptotic cascade finally resulted in the total demise of the macrophage resulting in the loss of the cell membrane integrity (Fig.2 D). None of the apoptotic events took place in non-infected cells or cells treated with the plasmid-cured strain (pYV127−). Taken together, our results indicate thatYersinia infection results in a rapid generation of tBid that will translocate to the mitochondria and induce the release of cytochrome c leading to the assembly of the apoptosome resulting in the activation of the executioner procaspases. To investigate which molecular events observed during Yersinia-induced apoptosis, viz. Bid cleavage, cytochrome c release, and procaspase activation, were YopP-dependent we infected J774A.1 macrophages with the E40(pMSK41) strain that is YopP-deficient (YopP−) and with the E40(pMSK41)(pMSK13) strain that overproduces YopPE40WT (YopPE40WT+). Our data demonstrate that Bid cleavage is YopP-dependent, because macrophages infected with the YopP− strain, expressing all other Yops, only contained the full-length Bid protein of 22 kDa as uninfected macrophages do, in contrast to the observed Bid cleavage when cells were infected with the YopPE40WT+ strain (Fig.3 A). As expected the downstream effects of Bid cleavage, such as mitochondrial cytochromec release (Fig. 3 A) and subsequent procaspase-3 and -7 activation, also did not occur when the YopP−strain was used for infection (Fig. 3 B). The absence of procaspase activation upon infection with the YopP− strain was confirmed by measuring the DEVDase activity in the respective cell lysates (Fig. 3 C). In addition, cleavage of Bid and subsequent cytochrome c release could be prevented by pretreatment of the macrophages with the caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk (Fig. 3 A). To exclude the possibility that Bid cleavage is the result of a feedback loop, catalyzed by postmitochondrial procaspase-3 activation (32Slee E.A. Harte M.T. Kluck R.M. Wolf B.B. Casiano C.A. Newmeyer D.D. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Nicholson D.W. Alnemri E.S. Green D.R. Martin S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar), we analyzed the levels of tBid in zDEVD.fmk pretreated and control macrophages infected with the YopPE40WT+ strain. Hence, if Bid cleavage would indeed be the upstream trigger of the YopP-induced apoptotic signaling cascade as a result of initiator procaspase-8 activation, it should not be affected by pretreatment with the zDEVD.fmk inhibitor. As expected from the results obtained in the kinetics experiment (Fig. 2), caspase-3/-7 inhibition did not change the amount of tBid generated upon YopPE40WT+ infection (Fig.4 A). As a control we show that zDEVD.fmk addition prior to Yersinia infection prevented the generation of DEVDase activity (Fig. 4 B). These data indicate that YopP in some way activates an upstream caspase activity, most likely caspase-8, resulting in the cleavage of Bid.Figure 4YopP-induced Bid cleavage is not the result of a caspase-3-dependent feedback loop. Control and zDEVD.fmk (100 μm) pretreated J774A.1 macrophages were infected with the YopPE40WT+ strain, and 2.5 h after infection cells were lysed.

Mice with disruptions in reelin, dab1, or both vldlr andapoER2 are ataxic, and they exhibit severe lamination defects within several brain structures. Reelin is a secreted extracellular protein that binds to the very low density lipoprotein receptor and the apolipoprotein E receptor 2 on the surface of neurons. Disabled-1 (Dab1), an intracellular adapter protein containing a PTB (phosphotyrosine binding) domain, is tyrosyl-phosphorylated during embryogenesis, but it accumulates in a hypophosphorylated form in mice lacking Reelin or both very low density lipoprotein receptor and apolipoprotein E receptor 2. Dab1 is rapidly phosphorylated when neurons isolated from embryonic brains are stimulated with Reelin, and several tyrosines have been implicated in this response. Mice with phenylalanine substitutions of all five tyrosines (Tyr185, Tyr198, Tyr200, Tyr220, and Tyr232) exhibit a reeler phenotype, implying that tyrosine phosphorylation is critical for Dab1 function.

Over the past five years, a great deal has been learned about the molecular mechanisms that control cell migration in the developing brain from the study of mutant mice.

Taken together, these findings suggest a model in which Reelin binds to lipoprotein receptors present on target neurons that express Dab1, initiating an intracellular signaling cascade. Recently,reelin has been shown to be mutated in a rare form of autosomal lissencephaly in humans (13Hong S.E. Shugart Y.Y. Huang D.T. Shahwan S.A. Grant P.E. Hourihane J.O. Martin N.D. Walsh C.A.

Although the exact mechanism involved in Reelin signaling is unclear, it has been proposed that Dab1 acts as an intracellular adapter molecule downstream of Reelin. Dab1 was first identified as a Src-binding protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen (16Howell B.W. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The amino terminus of Dab1 contains a PTB (phosphotyrosine binding) domain that is structurally similar to the PTB domains of Shc and Numb (17Forman-Kay J.D. Pawson T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 690-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Although PTB domains were originally identified as protein interaction domains that recognized tyrosyl-phosphorylated Asn-Pro-X-Tyr (NPXY) motifs present on target proteins, they have recently emerged as a more diverse family of protein modules that vary in their recognition sequences (17Forman-Kay J.D.

Biol. 1999; 19: 5179-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The Dab1 PTB domain has a preference for the unphosphorylated NPXY motif, and phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue is inhibitory to the interaction of Dab1 PTB domain with amyloid precursor protein (20Howell B.W. Lanier L.M. Frank R. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5179-5188Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The NPXY motif serves as an internalization signal for the low density lipoprotein receptor (21Chen W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the interaction with Dab1 has been suggested to regulate the rate of receptor internalization (22Gotthardt M. Trommsdorff M. Nevitt M.F. Shelton J. Richardson J.A. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25616-25624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Dab1 accumulates in mice lacking Reelin or both very low density lipoprotein receptor and apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (6Rice D.S. Sheldon M. D'Arcangelo G. Nakajima K. Goldowitz D. Curran T. Development. 1998; 125: 3719-3729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that Dab1 is degraded as a consequence of Reelin signaling. In wild-type mice, Dab1 is phosphorylated on tyrosines during embryogenesis (16Howell B.W. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). In contrast, tyrosyl phosphorylation of Dab1 is greatly diminished in reeler mice, despite the elevated levels of the protein. However, stimulation of forebrain neurons fromreeler embryos with exogenous Reelin can result in a rapid and dramatic induction of Dab1 tyrosyl phosphorylation (23Howell B.W. Herrick T.M. Cooper J.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). This has led to the hypothesis that tyrosyl phosphorylation of Dab1 is a critical step in the Reelin-signaling pathway. Indeed, mice expressing a mutant form of Dab1, in which a cluster of five tyrosine residues located immediately downstream of the PTB domain were replaced with phenylalanine, exhibit a reeler phenotype (24Howell B.W. Herrick T.M. Hildebrand J.D. Zhang Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 877-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Although this study supported a role for Dab1 phosphorylation in neuronal positioning, it did not identify the specific sites involved. Here, we identify the sites of Reelin-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation on Dab1 in neurons. This is a critical first step in understanding the mechanisms that couple the molecular events triggered by Reelin to the cellular processes that mediate neuronal positioning in the developing brain. The GST-Dab1 fusion construct and Dab1-hemagglutinin expression plasmid have been described previously (19Homayouni R. Rice D.S. Sheldon M. Curran T. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7507-7515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GST fusions of the Dab1 PTB domain (GST-Dab11–179), middle region (GST-Dab1180–399), and the carboxyl-terminal region (GST-Dab1400–555) were prepared by subcloning the corresponding polymerase chain reaction products into pGEX4T3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Site-directed mutagenesis was conducted using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutagenesis reactions were performed in the pGEX4T3 and pcDNA3 vectors containing a full-length Dab1 clone according to the manufacturer's protocol and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 bacterial strains as described previously (19Homayouni R. Rice D.S. Sheldon M. Curran T. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7507-7515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced bacterial pellets were lysed by sonicating in phosphate-buffered saline/Tween containing 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 40 μg/ml aprotinin, and 40 μg/ml leupeptin. The lysates were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C. Bound proteins were then used as substrates in Src kinase reactions in vitro. GST fusion proteins (∼5 μg each) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose were phosphorylated by ∼15 units of purified active c-Src (Upstate Biotechnology) in 50 μl of kinase reaction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 25 mmMgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.05 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm ATP, and 25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). The kinase reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 30 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample loading buffer, and protein samples were boiled for 5 min. Phosphoproteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and visualized by autoradiography. Phosphoproteins were excised from nitrocellulose membranes and digested with trypsin essentially as described (25Luo K.X. Hurley T.R. Sefton B.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Briefly, membrane pieces were first incubated in 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP-360; Sigma), 100 mm acetic acid for 30 min at 37 °C. After extensive washing with H2O, membranes were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with 10 μg ofl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma) in 50 mm NH4HCO3. This was followed by an overnight digestion with an additional 10 μg of trypsin. Samples were lyophilized and dissolved in alkaline PAGE sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 6 murea, and bromphenol blue). The tryptic phosphopeptides were resolved by electrophoresis on an alkaline 40% polyacrylamide gel, as described (26West M.H.P. Wu R.S. Bonner W.M. Electrophoresis. 1984; 5: 133-139Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The samples were electrophoresed overnight at 7 mA until the tracking dye had migrated to RF = 0.5. The gel was dried, and phosphopeptides were detected by autoradiography. HEK-293T cells (ATCC) were transfected with pcDNA3.1-Dab1-hemagglutinin or mutant forms of Dab1 and a constitutively active form of Src (pcDNA-Src527F) using FuGene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml each aprotinin and leupeptin). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation and incubated with anti-hemagglutinin antibodies (Covance). Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for analysis by Western blotting. Expression of Reelin in 293T cells has been described previously (11D'Arcangelo G. Homayouni R. Keshvara L. Rice D.S. Sheldon M. Curran T. Neuron. 1999; 24: 471-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Briefly, Nephrigen (Celox Laboratories Inc.) supernatant containing Reelin was clarified by centrifugation for10 min at 5000 × g at 4 °C. A saturated ammonium sulfate (4.1 m) solution was added to the Nephrigen supernatant to bring it from 0 to 45% saturation. Ammonium sulfate was gradually added to a slowly stirring solution over a period of 30 min at 4 °C, and the solution was stirred for an additional 30 min to allow proteins to precipitate completely. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C. After air-drying, the pellet was redissolved in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 10% glycerol and stored at −80 °C. To estimate the concentration of Reelin, samples were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and compared with known quantities of bovine serum albumin by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. This technique yielded a 50-fold purification, and partially purified full-length Reelin represented ∼6% of the total precipitated proteins. Treatment of neurons with Reelin-enriched supernatants has been described previously (11D'Arcangelo G. Homayouni R. Keshvara L. Rice D.S. Sheldon M. Curran T. Neuron. 1999; 24: 471-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Briefly, brains of E16 reeler embryos were removed, and neurons were isolated by trituration in Hanks' buffered salt solution. Neurons were separated into aliquots in several microcentrifuge tubes and then resuspended in either Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) or DMEM containing 1 ng/μl Reelin. After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, neurons were collected by centrifugation and either frozen at −80 °C or lysed immediately in cell lysis buffer. The lysates were pre-cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatant was used for anti-Dab1 (goat anti-Dab1 PTB, ExAlpha Biologics) immunoprecipitations. Synthesis of peptides and generation of phosphopeptide antibodies were carried out by Alpha Diagnostic International (San Antonio, TX). Rabbits were immunized with KLH-coupled phosphopeptides PY185, CEQAVY(PO4)QTILEED; PY198/200, CEDPVY(PO4)QY(PO4)IVFEAG; PY220, CETEENIVY(PO4)QVPTSQK; and PY232, CKKEGVY(PO4)DVPKSQP. Phosphopeptide PY185 and an unphosphorylated form of this peptide were conjugated to bovine serum albumin (BSA) using Imject maleimide-activated BSA (Pierce). Unphosphorylated GST-Dab1, Src-phosphorylated GST-Dab1, and GST-Dab1 mutant proteins were used in immunoblotting assays to characterize the antisera. Previous studies demonstrated that Dab1 binds to members of the Src family of kinases and that Dab1 can be phosphorylated by Src in transfected cells (16Howell B.W. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 24Howell B.W. Herrick T.M. Hildebrand J.D. Zhang Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 877-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). To determine if Src phosphorylates Dab1 directly, we used purified active Src (Src527F) to phosphorylate GST fusion proteins containing Dab1. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 1 A, Src efficiently phosphorylated GST-Dab1, whereas GST alone was not phosphorylated. As a first step toward identifying the in vitro sites of phosphorylation, we used GST fusion proteins containing three distinct Dab1 regions as substrates. As illustrated in Fig. 1 B, these domains comprised the PTB domain (GST-Dab11–179), the middle region (GST-Dab1180–399), and the carboxyl terminus (GST-Dab1400–555) of Dab1. Interestingly, only the middle region of Dab1 was phosphorylated by Src (Fig.1 A). This region contains six tyrosines, five of which were previously suggested as sites of Dab1 phosphorylation in transient transfection assays. A combination of peptide mapping and mutagenesis approaches was used to identify the specific sites of phosphorylation by Src in vitro. Phosphopeptides generated by tryptic digestion of in vitrophosphorylated Dab1 were readily separated by one-dimensional 40% alkaline-PAGE. As shown in Fig.2 A, complete digestion of phosphorylated wild-type GST-Dab1 consistently yielded four phosphopeptides. These phosphopeptides were designated numbers 1–4 starting from the most slowly migrating peptide. Occasionally, an additional phosphopeptide (indicated by an asterisk, Fig.2 A) was also observed to migrate slightly faster than phosphopeptide 3. Tyrosine 300 is not present in any of these phosphopeptides as it lies in a 16-kDa fragment of Dab1 that is never found to be phosphorylated in vitro. To identify the specific sites of phosphorylation within Dab1, we generated GST-Dab1 fusion proteins containing single phenylalanine substitutions at tyrosines 185 (185F), 198 (198F), 200 (200F), 220 (220F), and 232 (232F) and a GST-Dab1 fusion with double substitutions at residues 198 and 200 (198F/200F). The mutant GST-Dab1 fusion proteins were phosphorylated by Src in vitro, tryptic phosphopeptide maps were generated, and the results are shown in Fig. 2. Phenylalanine substitution at residues 220 and 232 resulted in the loss of phosphopeptides 2 and 4, respectively. Therefore, Src phosphorylated Tyr220 and Tyr232 of Dab1in vitro. However, given the low intensity of the band corresponding to peptide 4, Tyr232 was considered to be a minor site of in vitro phosphorylation. The remaining three potential sites of phosphorylation, Tyr185, Tyr198, and Tyr200, are located within a single tryptic peptide fragment, which complicates analysis. Single substitution of either Tyr185 or Tyr200 did not result in the loss of any of the four major peptides, indicating that these two tyrosines were not major phosphorylation sites. In contrast, substitution of Tyr198 with phenylalanine resulted in a dramatic loss of phosphopeptide 1 and phosphopeptide 3 and the appearance of a novel minor peptide (indicated by an arrow, Fig. 2 A). Therefore, phosphopeptide 1 probably represented a tryptic fragment that was almost exclusively phosphorylated on Tyr198, whereas phosphopeptide 3 likely represented a doubly phosphorylated form of the same tryptic fragment containing Tyr198(P) and either Tyr185(P) or Tyr200(P). The novel minor phosphopeptide in tryptic digest of GST-Dab1198F probably appeared as a result of a single phosphate present on the same peptide at either Tyr185 or Tyr200. Interestingly, tryptic digest of wild-type GST-Dab1 contained an additional phosphopeptide (indicated by anasterisk, Fig. 2 A) with a slightly faster migration rate than phosphopeptide 3. It is possible that this band represented a variant form of phosphopeptide 3 with a migration rate that would depend on which of the other tyrosine residues was phosphorylated within the single tryptic fragment. The exact identity of this phosphopeptide was difficult to establish, because this band was absent in digests of all mutant forms of GST-Dab1 fusion proteins. Consistent with the possibility that phosphopeptide 3 resulted from phosphorylation of Tyr198 and phosphorylation of either Tyr185 or Tyr200, both phosphopeptides 1 and 3 were absent from tryptic digests of the GST-Dab1 fusion protein containing phenylalanine substitutions at both residues 198 and 200. However, since phosphopeptide 3 persisted in the absence of Tyr200, it is likely that Tyr185 was also phosphorylated by Src in vitro. Therefore, the most straightforward interpretation of our results is that phosphopeptide 3 resulted from phosphorylation of Tyr198 and either Tyr185 or Tyr200. Although it was difficult to establish the relative contributions of Tyr185(P) and Tyr200(P) toward the composition of phosphopeptide 3, our results suggest that Tyr198 and Tyr220 were major in vitro phosphorylation sites, and Tyr185, Tyr200, and Tyr232 were minor Src phosphorylation sites. A combination of metabolic radiolabeling of cells with orthophosphate and tryptic phosphopeptide mapping has been the traditional approach to identify in vivo sites of protein phosphorylation. Due to inefficient radiolabeling of Dab1 in neurons and the presence of multiple tyrosines (Tyr185, Tyr198, and Tyr200) within a single tryptic fragment, it was difficult to employ this technique to identify the in vivo sites of Dab1 phosphorylation. Therefore, we chose to prepare phosphopeptide-specific antibodies to confirm the in vitrophosphorylation sites and to investigate in vivophosphorylation of Dab1. Peptides containing single phosphotyrosines Tyr185(P) (PY185), Tyr220(P) (PY220), and Tyr232(P) (PY232) were used to immunize rabbits. Given the close proximity of Tyr198 and Tyr200, we used a synthetic peptide containing both tyrosines in the phosphorylated form (PY198/200) for immunization. The efficacy of the each antibody was determined by Western blot assays in which the antisera were tested against unphosphorylated GST-Dab1 and GST-Dab1 phosphorylated with Srcin vitro. As shown in Fig.3 A, the antisera raised against PY198/200, PY220, and PY232 recognized only phosphorylated GST-Dab1, with no significant cross-reactivity with unphosphorylated GST-Dab1. Western blotting using anti-Dab1 antibodies confirmed that equivalent levels of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated Dab1 were present. Antisera from three different rabbits immunized with the PY185 peptide failed to show any specific reactivity toward phosphorylated GST-Dab1. This lack of reactivity was not due to a low titer, because the antisera strongly recognized bovine serum albumin-conjugated PY185 phosphopeptide in a Western blot assay without any cross-reactivity toward an unphosphorylated form of the peptide. Therefore, since the antisera recognized a synthetic phosphopeptide but did not recognize Src-phosphorylated GST-Dab1, it can reasonably be concluded that Tyr185 was not phosphorylated by Src in vitro. This finding was consistent with our phosphopeptide mapping results, which indicated that Tyr185 was a minor site of in vitro phosphorylation. Although the data in Fig. 3 A show that the phosphopeptide-specific antibodies specifically recognized phosphorylated Dab1, the utility of these antibodies requires that they also exhibit sequence specificity. To determine sequence specificity, the antibodies were tested in Western blots against unphosphorylated and Src-phosphorylated wild-type GST-Dab1 or GST-Dab1 fusion proteins containing single phenylalanine substitutions at Tyr198, Tyr200, Tyr220, and Tyr232 or double mutations of Tyr198 and Tyr200. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the antibodies raised against PY198/200, PY220, and PY232 exhibited strong sequence specificity. The anti-PY220 and anti-PY232 antibodies did not recognize phosphorylated GST-Dab1 containing single phenylalanine substitutions in place of the corresponding tyrosines. The specificity of anti-PY198/200 was determined by testing it on GST-Dab1 fusion proteins that contained either single phenylalanine substitutions in place of Tyr198 and Tyr200 or double substitution of both Tyr198 and Tyr200. The antibodies did not recognize Src-phosphorylated GST-Dab1 when Tyr198 alone or both Tyr198 and Tyr200 were substituted with phenylalanine. In contrast, the antisera contained partial reactivity toward Dab1 containing a single mutation of Tyr200, indicating that Tyr198(P) is the major epitope for this antibody but both Tyr198(P) and Tyr200(P) are required for optimal recognition of phosphorylated Dab1. Dab1 is efficiently phosphorylated by Src in transfected cells. Mapping studies using mass spectrometry to identify tryptic phosphopeptides showed that Tyr198 and Tyr232 were phosphorylated by Src (24Howell B.W. Herrick T.M. Hildebrand J.D. Zhang Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 877-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). However, tyrosyl phosphorylation of Dab1 remained undiminished when these two residues were mutated to phenylalanine, suggesting that Dab1 was phosphorylated on other tyrosine residues as well. Phenylalanine substitution of all five tyrosines (Tyr185, Tyr198, Tyr200, Tyr220, and Tyr232) present immediately downstream of the PTB domain abrogates Src phosphorylation in transfected cells (24Howell B.W. Herrick T.M. Hildebrand J.D. Zhang Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 877-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). To identify specific sites of tyrosyl phosphorylation, we transfected 293T cells with Src and with either wild-type Dab1 or Dab1 carrying single phenylalanine substitutions at Tyr198, Tyr200, Tyr220, Tyr232 or a double substitution of Tyr198 and Tyr200. Western blots using the phosphopeptide-specific antibodies were then carried out to determine the phosphorylation status of each of the mapped tyrosine residues. As shown in Fig. 4 A, Tyr220 and Tyr232 were clearly phosphorylated by Src. The antibody raised against the doubly phosphorylated PY198/200 peptide did not recognize Dab1 if Tyr198 alone or both Tyr198 and Tyr200 were mutated to phenylalanine. In contrast, mutation of Tyr200 did not have any effect on the ability of this antibody to recognize phosphorylated Dab1, implying that Tyr200 was not phosphorylated. To determine if Tyr185 was phosphorylated by Src, Dab1 was expressed either with Src or without Src in 293T cells, and anti-Dab1 immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with anti-PY185. As shown in Fig. 4 B, Tyr185 was not phosphorylated, even though Dab1 was tyrosyl-phosphorylated in the presence of Src. Therefore, these results show that Dab1 is phosphorylated by Src on Tyr198, Tyr220, and Tyr232 in 293T cells. Dab1 is tyrosyl-phosphorylated in a Reelin-dependent manner, and Reelin-induced phosphorylation of Dab1 in embryonic neurons is an important biochemical assay for Reelin function. As shown in Fig.5 A, tyrosyl phosphorylation of Dab1 increased dramatically when neurons from reeler embryos were treated with Reelin. We used the phosphopeptide antibodies to identify the sites of Reelin-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation on Dab1 to detect Dab1 in cultured neurons. Neurons isolated from embryonic brains of reeler mice were either left untreated or treated with Reelin. Anti-PY185, anti-PY198/200, anti-PY220, and anti-PY232 were used in Western blots to detect phosphorylated Dab1 in the anti-Dab1 immunoprecipitates. As shown in Fig. 5, only the anti-PY198/200 and anti-PY220 recognized Dab1 in Reelin-treated neurons, indicating that Tyr220 and either Tyr198 alone or both Tyr198 and Tyr200 were phosphorylated in neurons stimulated with Reelin. In three independent experiments, anti-PY185 and anti-PY232 did not react against Dab1 from Reelin-treated neurons, suggesting that these two tyrosines were not phosphorylated to any significant extent in response to Reelin treatment. Tyrosyl phosphorylation of Dab1 was very faint in the absence of Reelin, and only the anti-PY220 antisera reacted against Dab1 from unstimulated neurons. Therefore, although it is possible that Dab1 is basally phosphorylated on other tyrosines, our results suggest that Tyr220 is the major site of phosphorylation in absence of Reelin. Dab1 plays a critical role in controlling neuronal positioning in the developing brain. It functions as an intracellular adapter protein in the Reelin-signaling pathway, although the mechanism by which it mediates downstream signaling is unknown. The most important clue to Dab1 function is that it accumulates in a hypophosphorylated form inreeler mice, and binding of Reelin to lipoprotein receptors triggers tyrosyl phosphorylation of Dab1 in neurons (11D'Arcangelo G. Homayouni R. Keshvara L. Rice D.S. Sheldon M. Curran T. Neuron. 1999; 24: 471-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 12Hiesberger T. Trommsdorff M. Howell B.W. Goffinet A. Mumby M.C. Cooper J.A. Herz J. Neuron. 1999; 24: 481-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation sites were suspected to be contained within a cluster of five tyrosines located immediately downstream of the Dab1 PTB domain. Indeed, Howell et al. (24Howell B.W. Herrick T.M. Hildebrand J.D. Zhang Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 877-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) show that a mutant mouse expressing Dab1 with phenylalanine substitutions in place of these five tyrosines exhibited the same phenotype as reeler mice. This provided genetic evidence to support the critical role of Dab1 tyrosyl phosphorylation in the Reelin-signaling pathway. The biochemical consequences of Dab1 tyrosyl phosphorylation are not known, but it is possible that the phosphorylated tyrosines serve to recruit signaling molecules that bind to phosphorylated Dab1 via their SH2 domains. Alternatively, tyrosyl phosphorylation could affect the stability of Dab1 or its interaction with lipoprotein receptors. Therefore, identification of the Reelin-induced phosphorylation sites on Dab1 is critical to identifying downstream signaling components of this pathway. Dab1 was originally identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen as a Src-binding protein, and it was subsequently shown to be phosphorylated in an Src-dependent manner in cell lines (16Howell B.W. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Given the likely role of Src in Dab1 phosphorylation, we used recombinant active Src to map the in vitro sites of Dab1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Using GST fusions of three distinct Dab1 domains as substrates for Src in vitro, we determined that Src phosphorylates several tyrosines that are clustered in the middle region of Dab1 immediately downstream of the PTB domain. Using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis and tryptic phosphopeptide mapping, we showed that the major sites of Src-catalyzed in vitro phosphorylation are Tyr198 and Tyr220, and the minor sites of phosphorylation are Tyr185, Tyr200, and Tyr232. Using antibodies raised against phosphopeptides corresponding to these sites of phosphorylation, we confirmed that Tyr198, Tyr200, Tyr220, and Tyr232 arein vitro Src phosphorylation sites. In transfected 293T cells, Src phosphorylated Dab1 on Tyr198, Tyr220, and Tyr232. Recently, a mass spectrometric approach was used to identify Tyr198 and Tyr232 as sites of Src-catalyzed phosphorylation on Dab1 in transiently transfected 293T cells (24Howell B.W. Herrick T.M. Hildebrand J.D. Zhang Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 877-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). However, since Dab1 mutants with single phenylalanine substitutions of these two residues did not significantly reduce Dab1 tyrosyl phosphorylation, it was concluded that additional sites must be phosphorylated that are not detected by mass spectrometry. Our finding that Tyr220 is also phosphorylated is consistent with this conclusion. Since the antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the Tyr185(P) phosphorylation site failed to react with phosphorylated Dab1, Tyr185 is unlikely to be a major phosphorylation site. To identify the sites phosphorylated in response to Reelin, we treatedreeler embryonic neurons with Reelin and used phosphopeptide antibodies raised against these putative sites in Western blots. The results of these experiments clearly indicate that Tyr198and Tyr220 are phosphorylated in response to Reelin treatment. We were unable to determine whether Dab1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine 198 alone or both tyrosines 198 and 200, because the antibody against the doubly phosphorylated PY198/200 phosphopeptide retains reactivity in the absence of Tyr200(P). However, Tyr200 was not a major Src phosphorylation site in vitro or in transfected cells. Therefore, it is unlikely that this tyrosine is a major site of Reelin-induced phosphorylation. Antibodies against PY185 and PY232 did not recognize Dab1 in either Reelin-treated or untreated cells, suggesting that these tyrosines are not phosphorylated to any significant extent in response to Reelin stimulation. Despite the elevated levels of Dab1, tyrosyl phosphorylation of Dab1 is significantly diminished inreeler mice. This makes it very difficult to identify tyrosines that are phosphorylated in the absence of Reelin. However, we were able to detect a very low level of phosphorylation of Tyr220 in untreated neurons. Therefore, our results suggest that a population of Dab1 may be constitutively phosphorylated on this tyrosine in the absence of Reelin. The finding that Reelin triggers phosphorylation of Tyr198and Tyr220 has important implications. Although the immediate biochemical consequences of Reelin-induced Dab1 tyrosyl phosphorylation are unknown, tyrosyl-phosphorylated Dab1 is likely to be involved in protein-protein interactions. Dab1 has been shown to interact with SH2 domains of various signaling proteins in vitro (16Howell B.W. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 24Howell B.W. Herrick T.M. Hildebrand J.D. Zhang Y. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 877-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), but the in vivo interaction of Dab1 with any of these proteins has not been demonstrated. Our results suggest that physiologically relevant interactions of Dab1 with SH2-containing proteins would be mediated by Tyr198(P) and Tyr220(P). The amino acid sequence surrounding Tyr198 is very similar to the juxtamembrane region of platelet-derived growth factor β-receptor that binds to the SH2 domains of Src family kinases (27Mori S. Ronnstrand L. Yokote K. Engstrom A. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that phosphorylation of this tyrosine would serve to recruit Src family kinases. These kinases may then phosphorylate other proteins that may be associated with Dab1. Alternatively, such kinases may also play a role in amplifying the Reelin signal by increasing Dab1 phosphorylation in a positive feedback loop. The amino acid sequence downstream of Tyr220 represents a minimal consensus sequence, YXXP, for interaction with SH2 domains of various signaling proteins, such as Abl, phospholipase Cγ, Crk, and Nck (28Songyang Z.

Thus, Reelin-induced phosphorylation of Tyr198 and Tyr220 could result in formation of a Dab1-associated signaling complex that would mediate the downstream effects of Reelin. The kinases responsible for in vivo tyrosyl phosphorylation of Dab1 are not known. It is interesting that the Src-catalyzedin vitro phosphorylation sites are also phosphorylated in neurons stimulated with Reelin. The amino acid sequences upstream of the two major sites of phosphorylation, Tyr198 and Tyr220, share a marked sequence similarity. A hydrophobic residue at the −1 position and acidic residues at positions −3, −4, −6, and −8 relative to the tyrosines are characteristic of phosphorylation sites on substrates of the Src family of kinases (29Songyang Z. Carraway K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammad M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Ponder B.A.J. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have been able to phosphorylate Dab1 in vitrousing various tyrosine kinases, including Src and Fyn, and to a lesser extent, Abl. Several Src family tyrosine kinases are widely expressed in the brain during embryogenesis (30Lowell C.A. Soriano P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1845-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Although Fyn has been suggested to play a role in synaptic plasticity (31Grant S.G. O'Dell T.J. Karl K.A. Stein P.L. Soriano P. Kandel E.R. Science. 1992; 258: 1903-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar), no overt brain phenotype has been associated with src or fyn mutations. Furthermore, tyrosyl phosphorylation of Dab1 is undiminished in mice lacking several Src family kinases (16Howell B.W. Gertler F.B. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). However, functional redundancy within this family of kinases has made it very difficult to elucidate the roles of individual kinases by genetic approaches, and it is possible that Dab1 is phosphorylated by more than one Src family kinase. Abl, a close relative of the Src family, has also been implicated in the Reelin-Dab1 pathway. In Drosophila, Dab and Abl are involved in a common pathway that controls the development of axonal tracts (32Gertler F.B. Bennett R.L. Clark M.J. Hoffmann F.M. Cell. 1989; 58: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Although mice deficient in Abl or Arg, an Abl family member, do not exhibit any phenotypic similarity toreeler mice, mice deficient in both kinases suffer from serious neural tube defects, and embryos fail to survive past embryonic day 9 (33Koleske A.J. Gifford A.M. Scott M.L. Nee M. Bronson R.T. Miczek K.A. Baltimore D. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1259-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that Abl or Arg are required for phosphorylation of Dab1, but functional redundancy within this family presents some difficulties in determining their role in Dab1 phosphorylation. We cannot preclude the possibility that more than one tyrosine kinase is involved in complete activation of the Reelin-Dab1 pathway. For example, one kinase may be responsible for the constitutive phosphorylation of Dab1, whereas another kinase may increase Dab1 tyrosyl phosphorylation in response to Reelin. Identification of the sites of Reelin-induced Dab1 tyrosyl phosphorylation is an important step toward understanding the biochemical function of Dab1 in the Reelin-signaling pathway. Synthetic peptides containing Tyr198 and Tyr220 can be used in biochemical assays to identify and purify tyrosine kinases involved in Dab1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, the availability of antibodies specific for these phosphorylation sites makes it possible to identify other upstream signaling pathways that may cross-talk with the Reelin pathway. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1 is an obligatory step in Reelin-Dab1 signaling, and Reelin-induced phosphorylation served as an important assay for identifying lipoprotein receptors as key components of the Reelin-signaling pathway. The availability of phosphorylation site-specific antibodies may not only allow us to identify additional components of this pathway, but they may also help identify other signaling pathways that cross-talk with the Reelin-Dab1 pathway.

In the first step of this process, rather labile Schiff bases are formed which as a rule rearrange to the more stable Amadori products. The Amadori compounds are slowly degraded, in complex reaction pathways via dicarbonyl intermediates, to a plethora of compounds (1Ledl F. Schleicher E. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1990; 29: 565-706Crossref Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 2Friedman M. J. Agric. Food Chem. 1996; 44: 631-653Crossref Scopus (725) Google Scholar) subsumed summarily under the term “advanced glycation end products” (AGEs)1; this overall reaction sequence proceeds both in vitro and in vivo. In long lived tissue proteins, such as collagen and lens crystallins, these chemical modifications accumulate with age and thence may contribute to pathophysiologies associated with aging and long term complications of diabetes and atherosclerosis. A major consequence of the advanced Maillard reaction is the formation of covalently cross-linked proteins. On the basis of various model reactions, different mechanisms for cross-linking of amino acid side chains in proteins have been discussed (3–14). So far, pentosidine11 (Fig. 1) (15Sell D.R.

Eye Res. 1999; 19: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) have been detected in vivo. Some of the cross-links (e.g. fluorophore LM-1 and GOLD) are formed via post-translational modification of proteins by products of carbohydrate oxidation; they can therefore be designated as “advanced glycoxidation end products” (AGOEs) thus representing a subgroup of AGEs. The other cross-links (e.g. MOLD) are derived from carbohydrate-protein reactions that do not involve an oxidation step. The latter formation pathway is operative also in the formation of the cross-linking unit glucosepane 9 recently being identified from reactions of bovine serum albumin (BSA) with d-glucose (1) (22Lederer M.O. Bühler H.P. Biomed. Chem. 1999; 7: 1081-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). For better understanding the impact of the Maillard reaction on aging and diabetes, and for developing effective therapeutic methods to prevent AGE accumulation in tissues, it is an absolute prerequisite to establish definitively the chemical nature of the major protein cross-links and to elucidate their formation. The structural similarity between glucosepane 9 and pentosidine11 suggests a parallelism in the respective formation pathways, although generation of 11, contrary to9, requires an oxidation process. Despite the fact that up to now more than 100 papers dealing with the prominent AGE11 have been published, no reaction scheme for its generation from pentoses has so far been established. We now report on the elucidation of the formation pathways for glucosepane 9 as well as for pentosidine 11and on the structural characterization of its precursor 6-((6S)-2-{[(4S)-4-ammonio-5-oxido-5-oxopentyl]amino}-6-hydroxy-5,6,7,7a-tetrahydro-4H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridin-4-yl)-l-norleucinate (10, Fig. 1).

Solutions (0.5 ml) of 10 (50 mg/liter) and 14 (50 mg/liter, the NMR solution was employed) were adjusted to pH 7.4 by adding solid NaHCO3. The mixtures were kept at 50 °C, aliquots taken at regular intervals, and subjected to LC-(ESI)MS analysis (gradient B, full scan mode). d-Glucose (9 mg, 0.05 mmol), d-glucose-13C6(9 mg, 0.05 mmol),N α-t-Boc-l-lysine (76 mg, 0.3 mmol),N α-t-Boc-l-arginine (57 mg, 0.2 mmol), and phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (80 mg, 0.5 mmol), were dissolved in water (0.5 ml). In a second reaction mixture, solid NaHCO3 was used instead of phosphate buffer to adjust the pH to 7.4. Both mixtures were kept at 60 °C for 6 days. Aliquots were diluted 1:20 and subjected to LC-(ESI)MS analysis (gradient A, full scan mode). BSA (10 g, 151 μmol) was dissolved in phosphate buffer (200 ml, 0.1 m, pH 7.4) containing DTPA (78 mg, 0.2 mmol) and passed through a 0.45-μm membrane filter. To 4 aliquots (40 ml each), 1 (720 mg, 4 mmol), 2c (600 mg, 4 mmol), 7 (27 mg, ∼48%, 0.08 mmol), or 8 (10.6 mg, 0.08 mmol) was added. Aliquots (5 ml) of each series were filtered (sterile filter, 0.2 μm) into tubes, sealed tightly, and kept at 37 °C with gentle shaking. At regular intervals, aliquots (2 ml, equivalent to 100 mg protein) from each BSA incubation series were transferred to an Amicon 8050 (Witten, Germany) stirred cell, diluted to 30 ml, and ultrafiltered (Millipore PM 10 filter disks, MWCO 10 kDa) with water (0.6 liters) by applying a pressure of 4.5 bar. The retained material was lyophilized, 3 mg dissolved in PBS (1 ml, pH 7.4), a small thymol crystal added, and the mixture incubated for 3 days at 37 °C under subsequent addition of peptidase (0.1 unit, corresponding to 20 μl of a solution containing 50 mg of peptidase/ml PBS), Pronase E (0.6 units, corresponding to 60 μl of a solution containing 2 mg of Pronase E/ml PBS), and aminopeptidase M (0.3 units, corresponding to 15 μl of a solution containing 1.7 mg of aminopeptidase M/ml PBS) in 24-h intervals. The digested samples were ultrafiltered by centrifugation (Millipore Ultrafree MC, MWCO 5 kDa) and the filtrates subjected to LC-(ESI)MS analysis (gradient B, SIM mode). The preparative HPLC system consisted of a Kronlab (Sinsheim, Germany) KD200/100SS gradient pump system combined with a Knauer (Berlin, Germany) A0293 variable wavelength detector and a Kronlab HPLC column (guard column 50 × 20 mm, column 250 × 20 mm; Nucleosil C 18, 100 Å, 7 μm); injection volume 1.5 ml; flow rate 20 ml/min. The following gradients % MeOH (t (min)) and detection wavelengths were applied: ammonium formate buffer (10 mm, pH 4.0)-MeOH, A, 30(0)-70(15)-100(16–21)-30(24–30); B,0(0)-5(5)-0(6)-0(11), detection at 244 nm; trifluoroacetic acid (0.05%, v/v)-MeOH; C, 1(0)-20(15)-100(18–22)-1(25–30), detection at 248 nm. These were run on an HP1100 (Hewlett-Packard, Waldbronn, Germany) HPLC system coupled to a Micromass (Manchester, UK) VG platform II quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray (ESI) interface. The HPLC system consists of an HP1100 autosampler, HP1100 gradient pump, HP1100 thermoregulator, and HP1100 diode array detector module.

For post-column addition of propionic acid/2-propanol (4:1, v/v) in a 1:3 ratio with the HPLC mobile phase, a Knauer WellChrom Maxi-Star K-1000 HPLC pump was used; the eluent was finally split 1:20 before being introduced into the ion source. MS parameters: ESI+, source temperature 120 °C, capillary 3.5 kV, HV lens 0.5 kV, cone 55 V. For LC analyses, the MS system was operated either in full scan mode (m/z 200–1000) or in selected ion mode (SIM; span 0.5 Da; dwell time 0.4 s, monitoring masses at m/z 447.25 and 429.25 or m/z 417.2, 399.2, and 379.2). For accurate mass determination (26Tyler A.N. Clayton E. Green B.N. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 3561-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), data were collected in the multichannel acquisition mode with 128 channels per m/z unit using 12 scans (6 s) with 0.1-s reset time. The resolution was 970–1050 (10% valley definition). The sample was dissolved in water/MeCN (1:1) containing reference material (0.1 μg/μl, see below), ammonium formate (0.1%), and formic acid (1%); the sample concentration was similar to that of the reference compound.

For LC-NMR, the Varian Unity Inova 500 equipped with a pulsed field gradient probe having a flow cell of 65 μl active volume was coupled to a Varian HPLC gradient pump system 9012 combined with a Varian variable wavelength detector 9050 and a Phenomenex HPLC column (Luna, C 18, 100 Å, 5 μm, 250 × 2 mm, Aschaffenburg, Germany).

Solvent suppression was achieved by “water suppression-enhanced through t1 effects” (28Smallcombe S.H. Patt S.L. Keiffer P.A. J. Magn. Res. 1995; 117: 295-303Crossref Scopus (537) Google Scholar). All NMR spectra were recorded in the stop-flow mode. UV spectra were measured with a Perkin-Elmer (Überlingen, Germany) Lambda 2. A Leybold-Heraeus (Köln, Germany) Lyovac GT 2 was applied. In our previous experiments, d-glucose (1) was reacted withN α-t-Boc-l-lysine andN α-t-Boc-l-arginine in concentrated phosphate buffer (1 m, pH 7.4) at 70 °C (22Lederer M.O. Bühler H.P. Biomed. Chem. 1999; 7: 1081-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, glucosepane 9 (Fig.1) was the only cross-link formed in substantial amount with all carbons of the original sugar backbone retained. Changing from 1 m phosphate buffer to a 0.01m hydrogen carbonate medium, LC-(ESI)MS analysis of the crude reaction mixture showed the signals for the two diastereoisomers of 9 (t-Boc derivatives, [M + H]+at m/z 629) and an additional twin peak with the quasimolecular ion [M + H]+ at m/z 647,i.e. 18 Da higher than the [M + H]+ signal fort-Boc-9. Both products were formed in comparable amounts. Reaction ofN 2-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-N 6-(1-deoxy-β-d-fructopyranos-1-yl)-l-lysine (t-Boc-3, i.e. the Amadori compound of1 andN α-t-Boc-l-lysine) gave analogous results; however, the t-Boc derivative of9 now dominates by a factor of 5 relative to the product with [M + H]+ at m/z 647. In contrast, incubation of 3-deoxyglucosone (3-DOG, 7) with theN α-t-Boc-protected amino acids yields, irrespective of the buffer, only the compound with [M + H]+ at m/z 647. This result is at divergence with our previous assumption that glucosepane-like structures are formed from all three, the native carbohydrate, the Amadori product, and 7 (13Lederer M.O. Gerum F. Severin T. Biomed. Chem. 1998; 6: 993-1002PubMed Google Scholar). Since at that time, product identification from the reaction with 3-DOG 7 had to rely on the UV data and retention time of the twin peak, both of which are very similar for the products in question, we erroneously assigned the signals to the glucosepane-like structure. The two diastereoisomers with [M + H]+ atm/z 647 were isolated from the 3-DOG 7incubation, the protective groups cleaved off with 3 n HCl at room temperature and the products purified by preparative HPLC. Accurate mass determination of the obtained compounds gave [M + H]+"

It is essential for the activation of hundreds of enzymes, for the maintenance of active conformations of macromolecules, for charge compensation, and for the modification of various ion channels. Total cellular concentrations of Mg2+ are in the millimolar range; the vast majority is bound to negatively charged ligands, particularly phosphate, ATP, RNA, and DNA, leaving a only small fraction in the free ionized form (reviewed in Refs. 1Romani A. Scarpa A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar and 2Günther T. Miner. Electrolyte Metab. 1993; 19: 259-265PubMed Google Scholar).Free ionized Mg2+ concentrations remain relatively unchanged in mammalian cells, whereas total concentrations can vary to a considerable extent, mostly depending on the intracellular ion milieu and on metabolic stimulation by hormones and other factors (1Romani A.

Cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae tightly control intracellular Mg2+ levels, which remain relatively constant in growth media containing 1–100 mm Mg2+. Yeast cells starved of Mg2+ stop growing and lose their viability when the intracellular Mg2+ concentration falls below a threshold level (4Beeler T. Bruce K. Dunn T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1323: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).The physiology of Mg2+ transport has been studied in vertebrate and mammalian cell types and in plasma membrane vesicles during the past 40 years, mostly by observing extrusion from cells rather than uptake of the ion into cells. Most studies agree on the presence of a Mg2+/Na+ antiporter in the plasma membrane. Recent observations indicate the presence of up to three Mg2+ transporters. These act as antiporters, which exchange Mg2+ for sodium or calcium, or as cotransporters of Mg2+ and anions (reviewed in Refs. 1Romani A. Scarpa A. Arch. Biochem.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4361-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Whereas none of these mammalian transporters have been specified in molecular terms yet, candidate genes encoding Mg2+transporters in the vacuolar membrane of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana and in the mitochondrial membrane of the yeast S. cerevisiae have been described recently (11Shaul O.

Genet. 2001; 264: 773-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).In bacteria, three proteins (CorA, MgtA, and MgtB) have been shown to be involved in Mg2+ transport across the plasma membrane. Members of the CorA family are virtually ubiquitous in eubacteria and archaea and form their constitutive Mg2+ influx system (reviewed in Ref. 14Smith R.L. Maguire M.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Although their sequences may have diverged considerably, all family members are characterized by two or three adjacent transmembrane domains near their carboxyl termini, one of which is followed by the motif (Y/F)GMN. Even distant homologs have been shown to be functionally equivalent Mg2+transporters. Whereas the CorA proteins form a family of their own, the bacterial MgtA and MgtB Mg2+ transport systems belong to the P-type ATPases. Unlike CorA, their expression is regulated via the two-component signal transduction system PhoPQ, which itself is subject to regulation by Mg2+ (reviewed in Ref. 14Smith R.L. Maguire M.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar).Recently, eukaryotic homologs of the bacterial CorA Mg2+transporters have been identified in the yeast S. cerevisiae. They are characterized by two predicted transmembrane domains and the sequence motif (Y/F)GMN in the short segment connecting them. Mrs2p and Lpe10p are related proteins of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Absence of one or the other of this pair renders cells mitochondrially defective and causes a 2-fold reduction of intramitochondrial Mg2+ concentrations. Consistently, overexpression of Mrs2p and Lpe10p leads to a moderate increase in the mitochondrial Mg2+ concentration (12Bui D.M. Gregan J. Jarosch E. Ragnini A. Schweyen R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20438-20443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 13Gregan J. Bui M.D. Pillich R. Fink M. Zsurka G. Schweyen R.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2001; 264: 773-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).Alr1p is essential for growth of yeast cells, except in media with high Mg2+ concentrations, and its overexpression confers resistance to aluminum (15MacDiarmid C.W. Gardner R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1727-1732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). High expression of Alr1p correlates with an increase in the uptake of labeled cobalt, which is likely to be transported by Mg2+ transporters. These phenotypic features of Δalr1 mutants suggest that Alr1p is part of an essential Mg2+ transport system in the yeast plasma membrane. The yeast genome encodes a close homolog of this protein, named Alr2p. Growth of yeast cells is not dependent on the presence of this homolog; but when overexpressed, it can compensate for the absence of Alr1p (15MacDiarmid C.W. Gardner R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1727-1732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).Here we present the first evidence for Alr1p being a protein in the yeast plasma membrane whose expression and turnover via endocytosis and vacuolar decay are tightly controlled by Mg2+. InΔalr1 cells grown in standard media, the intracellular Mg2+ concentration is reduced by a factor of 2 compared with wild-type cells. When grown in Mg2+-depleted media, mutant and wild-type cells exhibit a comparable reduction of intracellular Mg2+, but mutant cells have a reduced ability to replenish Mg2+ pools from external sources, indicating that they have an impaired Mg2+ transport capacity.DISCUSSIONThe yeast protein Alr1 was the first candidate for a transporter of Mg2+ in eukaryotic cells (15MacDiarmid C.W. Gardner R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1727-1732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The results presented here show its location in the plasma membrane and elucidate the specific role of Alr1p in cellular Mg2+ homeostasis as well as in the ion-specific expression and turnover of this protein.With two predicted transmembrane domains in its carboxyl-terminal part, the first of which is followed by the conserved motif (Y/F)GMN, Alr1p appears to be distantly related to the bacterial CorA proteins. Additional members of this family of putative Mg2+transporters are Mrs2p and Lpe10p in yeast mitochondria. This relationship is confirmed by the finding that growth defects caused byΔalr1, Δmrs2, orΔlpe10 mutations can be partially suppressed by expression of the bacterial CorA protein in yeast cells (Refs. 12Bui D.M. Gregan J. Jarosch E. Ragnini A. Schweyen R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20438-20443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar and13Gregan J. Bui M.D. Pillich R. Fink M. Zsurka G. Schweyen R.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2001; 264: 773-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar and this work). Cell fractionation and fluorescence microscopy data reveal that Alr1p is located in the plasma membrane. This location is predominant in cells grown in limiting concentrations of Mg2+, whereas cells grown in medium containing standard or high Mg2+ concentrations show reduced total amounts of Alr1p, and the residual protein is found partly in the plasma membrane and partly in intracellular vesicles.Mg2+ plays a crucial role in Alr1 protein stability. Exposure of cells to even standard Mg2+ concentrations leads to a dramatic decrease in the stability of this protein. This is reminiscent of regulation of the plasma membrane manganese transporter Smf1p and contrary to the copper transporter Ctr1p and the zinc transporter Zrt1p, where turnover of these proteins is induced only by relatively high copper and zinc concentrations (35Gitan R.S.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Data obtained here with the npi1, end3, andpep4 mutants affecting ubiquitination, endocytosis, and vacuolar degradation, respectively, reveal that Alr1p is internalized via the endocytic pathway and delivered to the vacuole for degradation. The data do not exclude additional routes of degradation of Alr1p. Interestingly, these mutants also accumulate a modified form of Alr1p, which constitutes a minor fraction of Alr1p in wild-type cells. This modification apparently precedes ubiquitination and endocytosis of Alr1p. It still remains to be shown how Mg2+ triggers the initial steps of Alr1 protein turnover and in which form Alr1p enters the endocytic pathway. The mechanism of Alr1p turnover is reminiscent of substrate-triggered degradation of plasma membrane proteins such as Ste2p, Ste3p, Pdr5p, Fur4p, sugar permeases, and the Zn2+transporter Zrt1p, which are removed from the plasma membrane by endocytosis for vacuolar degradation (26Rotin D.

Rapid decay of these plasma membrane receptors and transporters is induced by their physiological substrates. Similarly, Alr1p degradation appears to be triggered by Mg2+, with high selectivity over other divalent metal ions. Only cobalt, which has been shown to be taken up by the Mg2+ transport systems (14Smith R.L. Maguire M.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 15MacDiarmid C.W. Gardner R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1727-1732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and manganese affect Alr1p stability, but only when present at non-physiologically high concentrations. In addition to this post-translational control,ALR1 mRNA steady-state levels are down-regulated in medium containing standard or high Mg2+ concentrations compared with Mg2+ limiting growth conditions. It still remains to be shown whether this regulation is exerted by metal ion-sensitive transcription factors, as in the case of the zinc transporters Zrt1p, Zrt2p, and Zrt3p (40Zhao H. Butler E. Rodgers J. Spizzo T. Duesterhoeft S. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28713-28720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 41MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), or by mRNA turnover.Mg2+ appears to be the only ion whose intracellular concentration becomes growth-limiting in Δalr1cells. First, the total intracellular concentration of Mg2+(but not of other ions) is significantly reduced in this mutant. Second, out of many metal ions tested, only Mg2+ at non-physiologically high concentrations can efficiently restore growth of the deletion mutant (15MacDiarmid C.W. Gardner R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1727-1732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Mg2+ uptake or homeostasis therefore appears to be the essential function of Alr1p when low or standard Mg2+ concentrations are provided. In growth media containing non-physiologically high Mg2+ concentrations, Alr1p is dispensable; Δalr1 cells regain growth; and wild-type cells severely reduce the amount of Alr1 protein in the plasma membrane. Uptake of Mg2+ under these conditions apparently is mediated by other uptake mechanisms.Consistent with previous studies on wild-type yeast cells (4Beeler T. Bruce K. Dunn T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1323: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the data reported here confirm a very tight control of total intracellular Mg2+ concentrations, allowing a 3–4-fold decrease only, when the external concentrations change by 4 orders of magnitude (from 100 mm to 10 μm). They were found to be kept rather constant at ∼3 mg/g (dry weight) with extracellular Mg2+ concentrations ranging from 1 to 200 mm. Only further studies will reveal if reduced influx or increased efflux (or both) accounts for the lack of cellular Mg2+accumulation in the presence of very high external concentrations. Low intracellular Mg2+ concentrations of ∼1 mg/g (dry weight) were detected both when wild-type cells were grown in essentially Mg2+-free medium (data not shown) and whenΔalr1 mutant cells were grown in medium containing ≤1 mm Mg2+. It remains to be shown whether this arrest is due to specific signals resulting from low intracellular Mg2+, leading to a defined state of cellular differentiation, as previously described for the fission yeastSchizosaccharomyces pombe (42Walker G.M. Magnesium. 1986; 5: 9-23PubMed Google Scholar), or whether the demand of a certain essential enzymatic function for Mg2+ can no longer be met, leading to growth arrest.Taken together, the data presented here consistently show that Alr1p expression is essential to maintain cellular Mg2+concentrations at levels suitable for growth of yeast cells. The suppression of the Δalr1 mutant phenotype by high Mg2+ (but not by other ions) and the control of expression and stability of Alr1p by Mg2+ suggest a specificity for Mg2+. Changes in steady-state levels of other ions appear to be secondary, reflecting charge compensation. The location of Alr1p in the plasma membrane of yeast cells and its apparent functional and structural homology to the bacterial Mg2+ transporter CorA protein tentatively classify Alr1p as a Mg2+ transporter of the yeast plasma membrane. It remains to be shown by which mechanisms Alr1p mediates uptake of Mg2+ into yeast cells and whether homologs of Alr1p exist in plasma membranes of higher eukaryotes. Mg2+ is the most abundant divalent cation in cells. It is essential for the activation of hundreds of enzymes, for the maintenance of active conformations of macromolecules, for charge compensation, and for the modification of various ion channels. Total cellular concentrations of Mg2+ are in the millimolar range; the vast majority is bound to negatively charged ligands, particularly phosphate, ATP, RNA, and DNA, leaving a only small fraction in the free ionized form (reviewed in Refs. 1Romani A. Scarpa A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar and 2Günther T. Miner. Electrolyte Metab. 1993; 19: 259-265PubMed Google Scholar). Free ionized Mg2+ concentrations remain relatively unchanged in mammalian cells, whereas total concentrations can vary to a considerable extent, mostly depending on the intracellular ion milieu and on metabolic stimulation by hormones and other factors (1Romani A. Scarpa A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 3Fatholahi M. LaNoue K. Romani A. Scarpa A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae tightly control intracellular Mg2+ levels, which remain relatively constant in growth media containing 1–100 mm Mg2+. Yeast cells starved of Mg2+ stop growing and lose their viability when the intracellular Mg2+ concentration falls below a threshold level (4Beeler T. Bruce K. Dunn T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1323: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The physiology of Mg2+ transport has been studied in vertebrate and mammalian cell types and in plasma membrane vesicles during the past 40 years, mostly by observing extrusion from cells rather than uptake of the ion into cells. Most studies agree on the presence of a Mg2+/Na+ antiporter in the plasma membrane. Recent observations indicate the presence of up to three Mg2+ transporters. These act as antiporters, which exchange Mg2+ for sodium or calcium, or as cotransporters of Mg2+ and anions (reviewed in Refs. 1Romani A. Scarpa A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 2Günther T. Miner. Electrolyte Metab. 1993; 19: 259-265PubMed Google Scholar, and 5Günther T. Vormann J. Biochim. Biophys.

Further transport systems are to be expected in membranes of intracellular compartments that are likely to sequester and release Mg2+(10Nelson N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4361-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Whereas none of these mammalian transporters have been specified in molecular terms yet, candidate genes encoding Mg2+transporters in the vacuolar membrane of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana and in the mitochondrial membrane of the yeast S. cerevisiae have been described recently (11Shaul O. Hilgemann D.W. de Almeira-Engler J. Van Montagu M. Inzé D. Galili G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3973-3980Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 12Bui D.M. Gregan J. Jarosch E. Ragnini A. Schweyen R.J.

Genet. 2001; 264: 773-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In bacteria, three proteins (CorA, MgtA, and MgtB) have been shown to be involved in Mg2+ transport across the plasma membrane. Members of the CorA family are virtually ubiquitous in eubacteria and archaea and form their constitutive Mg2+ influx system (reviewed in Ref. 14Smith R.L. Maguire M.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Although their sequences may have diverged considerably, all family members are characterized by two or three adjacent transmembrane domains near their carboxyl termini, one of which is followed by the motif (Y/F)GMN. Even distant homologs have been shown to be functionally equivalent Mg2+transporters. Whereas the CorA proteins form a family of their own, the bacterial MgtA and MgtB Mg2+ transport systems belong to the P-type ATPases. Unlike CorA, their expression is regulated via the two-component signal transduction system PhoPQ, which itself is subject to regulation by Mg2+ (reviewed in Ref. 14Smith R.L. Maguire M.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Recently, eukaryotic homologs of the bacterial CorA Mg2+transporters have been identified in the yeast S. cerevisiae. They are characterized by two predicted transmembrane domains and the sequence motif (Y/F)GMN in the short segment connecting them. Mrs2p and Lpe10p are related proteins of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Absence of one or the other of this pair renders cells mitochondrially defective and causes a 2-fold reduction of intramitochondrial Mg2+ concentrations. Consistently, overexpression of Mrs2p and Lpe10p leads to a moderate increase in the mitochondrial Mg2+ concentration (12Bui D.M. Gregan J. Jarosch E. Ragnini A. Schweyen R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20438-20443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 13Gregan J. Bui M.D. Pillich R. Fink M. Zsurka G. Schweyen R.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2001; 264: 773-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Alr1p is essential for growth of yeast cells, except in media with high Mg2+ concentrations, and its overexpression confers resistance to aluminum (15MacDiarmid C.W. Gardner R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1727-1732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). High expression of Alr1p correlates with an increase in the uptake of labeled cobalt, which is likely to be transported by Mg2+ transporters. These phenotypic features of Δalr1 mutants suggest that Alr1p is part of an essential Mg2+ transport system in the yeast plasma membrane. The yeast genome encodes a close homolog of this protein, named Alr2p. Growth of yeast cells is not dependent on the presence of this homolog; but when overexpressed, it can compensate for the absence of Alr1p (15MacDiarmid C.W. Gardner R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1727-1732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Here we present the first evidence for Alr1p being a protein in the yeast plasma membrane whose expression and turnover via endocytosis and vacuolar decay are tightly controlled by Mg2+. InΔalr1 cells grown in standard media, the intracellular Mg2+ concentration is reduced by a factor of 2 compared with wild-type cells. When grown in Mg2+-depleted media, mutant and wild-type cells exhibit a comparable reduction of intracellular Mg2+, but mutant cells have a reduced ability to replenish Mg2+ pools from external sources, indicating that they have an impaired Mg2+ transport capacity. DISCUSSIONThe yeast protein Alr1 was the first candidate for a transporter of Mg2+ in eukaryotic cells (15MacDiarmid C.W. Gardner R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1727-1732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The results presented here show its location in the plasma membrane and elucidate the specific role of Alr1p in cellular Mg2+ homeostasis as well as in the ion-specific expression and turnover of this protein.With two predicted transmembrane domains in its carboxyl-terminal part, the first of which is followed by the conserved motif (Y/F)GMN, Alr1p appears to be distantly related to the bacterial CorA proteins. Additional members of this family of putative Mg2+transporters are Mrs2p and Lpe10p in yeast mitochondria. This relationship is confirmed by the finding that growth defects caused byΔalr1, Δmrs2, orΔlpe10 mutations can be partially suppressed by expression of the bacterial CorA protein in yeast cells (Refs. 12Bui D.M. Gregan J. Jarosch E. Ragnini A. Schweyen R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20438-20443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar and13Gregan J. Bui M.D. Pillich R. Fink M. Zsurka G. Schweyen R.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2001; 264: 773-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar and this work). Cell fractionation and fluorescence microscopy data reveal that Alr1p is located in the plasma membrane. This location is predominant in cells grown in limiting concentrations of Mg2+, whereas cells grown in medium containing standard or high Mg2+ concentrations show reduced total amounts of Alr1p, and the residual protein is found partly in the plasma membrane and partly in intracellular vesicles.Mg2+ plays a crucial role in Alr1 protein stability. Exposure of cells to even standard Mg2+ concentrations leads to a dramatic decrease in the stability of this protein. This is reminiscent of regulation of the plasma membrane manganese transporter Smf1p and contrary to the copper transporter Ctr1p and the zinc transporter Zrt1p, where turnover of these proteins is induced only by relatively high copper and zinc concentrations (35Gitan R.S.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Data obtained here with the npi1, end3, andpep4 mutants affecting ubiquitination, endocytosis, and vacuolar degradation, respectively, reveal that Alr1p is internalized via the endocytic pathway and delivered to the vacuole for degradation. The data do not exclude additional routes of degradation of Alr1p. Interestingly, these mutants also accumulate a modified form of Alr1p, which constitutes a minor fraction of Alr1p in wild-type cells. This modification apparently precedes ubiquitination and endocytosis of Alr1p. It still remains to be shown how Mg2+ triggers the initial steps of Alr1 protein turnover and in which form Alr1p enters the endocytic pathway. The mechanism of Alr1p turnover is reminiscent of substrate-triggered degradation of plasma membrane proteins such as Ste2p, Ste3p, Pdr5p, Fur4p, sugar permeases, and the Zn2+transporter Zrt1p, which are removed from the plasma membrane by endocytosis for vacuolar degradation (26Rotin D.

It still remains to be shown whether this regulation is exerted by metal ion-sensitive transcription factors, as in the case of the zinc transporters Zrt1p, Zrt2p, and Zrt3p (40Zhao H. Butler E.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), or by mRNA turnover. Mg2+ appears to be the only ion whose intracellular concentration becomes growth-limiting in Δalr1cells. First, the total intracellular concentration of Mg2+(but not of other ions) is significantly reduced in this mutant. Second, out of many metal ions tested, only Mg2+ at non-physiologically high concentrations can efficiently restore growth of the deletion mutant (15MacDiarmid C.W. Gardner R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1727-1732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Mg2+ uptake or homeostasis therefore appears to be the essential function of Alr1p when low or standard Mg2+ concentrations are provided. In growth media containing non-physiologically high Mg2+ concentrations, Alr1p is dispensable; Δalr1 cells regain growth; and wild-type cells severely reduce the amount of Alr1 protein in the plasma membrane. Uptake of Mg2+ under these conditions apparently is mediated by other uptake mechanisms. Consistent with previous studies on wild-type yeast cells (4Beeler T. Bruce K. Dunn T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1323: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the data reported here confirm a very tight control of total intracellular Mg2+ concentrations, allowing a 3–4-fold decrease only, when the external concentrations change by 4 orders of magnitude (from 100 mm to 10 μm). They were found to be kept rather constant at ∼3 mg/g (dry weight) with extracellular Mg2+ concentrations ranging from 1 to 200 mm. Only further studies will reveal if reduced influx or increased efflux (or both) accounts for the lack of cellular Mg2+accumulation in the presence of very high external concentrations. Low intracellular Mg2+ concentrations of ∼1 mg/g (dry weight) were detected both when wild-type cells were grown in essentially Mg2+-free medium (data not shown) and whenΔalr1 mutant cells were grown in medium containing ≤1 mm Mg2+. It remains to be shown whether this arrest is due to specific signals resulting from low intracellular Mg2+, leading to a defined state of cellular differentiation, as previously described for the fission yeastSchizosaccharomyces pombe (42Walker G.M. Magnesium. 1986; 5: 9-23PubMed Google Scholar), or whether the demand of a certain essential enzymatic function for Mg2+ can no longer be met, leading to growth arrest. Taken together, the data presented here consistently show that Alr1p expression is essential to maintain cellular Mg2+concentrations at levels suitable for growth of yeast cells. The suppression of the Δalr1 mutant phenotype by high Mg2+ (but not by other ions) and the control of expression and stability of Alr1p by Mg2+ suggest a specificity for Mg2+. Changes in steady-state levels of other ions appear to be secondary, reflecting charge compensation. The location of Alr1p in the plasma membrane of yeast cells and its apparent functional and structural homology to the bacterial Mg2+ transporter CorA protein tentatively classify Alr1p as a Mg2+ transporter of the yeast plasma membrane. It remains to be shown by which mechanisms Alr1p mediates uptake of Mg2+ into yeast cells and whether homologs of Alr1p exist in plasma membranes of higher eukaryotes.

Part of this transcriptional induction is mediated by insulin. An insulin response element has been described for the fatty-acid synthase gene region of −600 to +65, but the 2–3-fold increase in fatty-acid synthase promoter activity attributable to this region is small compared with the 20–30-fold induction in fatty-acid synthase gene transcription observed in fasted rats refed carbohydrate. We have previously reported that the fatty-acid synthase gene region between −7382 and −6970 was essential for achieving high in vivorates of gene transcription. The studies of the current report demonstrate that the region of −7382 to −6970 of the fatty-acid synthase gene contains a carbohydrate response element (CHO-REFAS) with a palindrome sequence (CATGTGn 5GGCGTG) that is nearly identical to the CHO-RE of the l-type pyruvate kinase and S14 genes. The glucose responsiveness imparted by CHO-REFAS was independent of insulin. Moreover, CHO-REFAS conferred glucose responsiveness to a heterologous promoter (i.e. l-type pyruvate kinase). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that CHO-REFAS readily bound a unique hepatic ChoRF and that CHO-REFAS competed with the CHO-RE of thel-type pyruvate kinase and S14 genes for ChoRF binding. In vivo footprinting revealed that fasting reduced and refeeding increased ChoRF binding to CHO-REFAS. Thus, carbohydrate responsiveness of rat liver fatty-acid synthase appears to require both insulin and glucose signaling pathways.

Moreover, the hepatic content of SREBP-1 and the DNA binding activity of Sp1 are increased by insulin and glucose ingestion and decreased by fasting (20Foretz M. Pacot C. Dugail I. Lemarchand P.

In addition, the binding of SREBP-1 to its DNA recognition sequence within the insulin response region of fatty-acid synthase may enhance the binding of Sp1 to its response element at −80, which may in turn enhance the interaction of NF-Y with its recognition sequence at −90 (14Bennett K.M.

The inability of the proximal promoter regions to yieldin vivo rates of fatty-acid synthase gene transcription indicated that the fatty-acid synthase gene contained unidentified enhancer sequences that were essential to the nutritional regulation of hepatic fatty-acid synthase gene transcription. In an earlier report we determined that the distal region of the fatty-acid synthase gene between −7382 and −6970 contained elements that imparted to the fatty-acid synthase promoter a rate of transcriptional activity that was comparable with that observed in fasted-refed rats (27Rufo C. Gasperikova D. Clarke S.D. Teran-Garcia M. Nakamura M.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 400-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis revealed that this region contained a 17-base pair segment that was homologous to the ChoRE of the l-type pyruvate kinase and S14 genes (28Shih H. Liu Z. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21991-21997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This observation led us to hypothesize that the 17-base pair segment within the distal enhancer region of the fatty-acid synthase gene is a functional ChoRE and that this candidate ChoRE may bind the recently identified ChoRF (25Koo S-H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21616-21624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Of particular interest has been the sequence between −68 and −57. This area contains an E-box binding site for USF-1 and -2 and a binding site for SREBP-1c that involves sequences on either side of the E-box (14Bennett K.M. Lopez J.M. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25578-25583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 23Magaña M.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32689-32694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Disruption of either the USF-1 or USF-2 genes reduced the hepatic abundance of fatty-acid synthase mRNA to a level that was only 10–15% of that found in wild type mice (35Casado M. Vallet V.S. Kahn A. Vaulont S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2009-2013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Moreover, an early report by Sul and co-workers (19Latasa M.J. Moon Y.S. Kim K.H. Sul H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10619-10624Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) indicated that the DNA binding activity and protein abundance of USF-1 was reduced by fasting and increased by carbohydrate refeeding. However, subsequent studies have clearly demonstrated that the abundance of hepatic USFs is not altered by nutritional manipulations (7Towle H.C. Kaytor E.N. Shih H.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 405-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In contrast to USF, the hepatic abundance of SREBP-1c was rapidly induced by refeeding fasted rats a high glucose diet, and by administering insulin to diabetic rats, or by treating rat hepatocytes in primary culture with insulin (36Horton J.D. Bashmakov Y. Shimomura I. Shimano H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5987-5992Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 37Schimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Ikemoto S. Horton J.D. Brown M.S.

This induction of hepatic SREBP-1c expression was paralleled by an increase in hepatic fatty-acid synthase gene transcription (20Foretz M. Pacot C. Dugail I. Lemarchand P. Guichard C. Le Liepvre X. Berthelier-Lubrano C. Spiegelman B. Kim J.B. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3760-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). The importance of SREBP-1c to fatty-acid synthase gene transcription was further suggested by the observation that disrupting the binding site for SREBP-1c without affecting the E-box site for USF eliminated the insulin/glucose activation of the fatty-acid synthase promoter (24Magaña M.M. Koo S. Towle H.C. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4726-4733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Thus, the nuclear abundance of SREBP-1c and the binding of SREBP-1c to its recognition sequences within the area of −68 to −57 appear to be important determinants for hepatic fatty-acid synthase promoter activity. However, disruption of the SREBP-1 gene only partially prevented the increase in hepatic fatty-acid synthase mRNA that results from feeding fasted rats a high glucose diet (27Rufo C. Gasperikova D. Clarke S.D. Teran-Garcia M. Nakamura M.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 400-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This suggested that nutritional regulation of fatty-acid synthase gene transcription required factors other than SREBP-1c.

Moreover, the investigators proposed that the region between −444 and +67 is sufficient to replicate the in vivo insulin and carbohydrate induction of fatty-acid synthase gene transcription. However, a close examination of their data reveals that the transcription of the native fatty-acid synthase gene is ∼2–3-fold greater than that observed for the reporter gene. Thus elements critical to the in vivo regulation of fatty-acid synthase gene transcription appear to be located outside of the proximal promoter region.One approach for identifying gene regions that may play an important role in gene transcription is to manipulate nutritional status and examine changes in chromatin structure (27Rufo C. Gasperikova D. Clarke S.D. Teran-Garcia M. Nakamura M.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 400-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Using this approach we found that refeeding glucose to 48-h fasted rats induced changes in chromatin structure within three regions of the hepatic fatty-acid synthase gene: (a) −7300 and −6900, (b) −600 to −400, and (c) −150 to +50 (27Rufo C. Gasperikova D. Clarke S.D. Teran-Garcia M. Nakamura M.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 400-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the region between +283 and +303, which reportedly contains a glucose response element (17Foufelle F. Lepetit N. Bosc D. Delzenne N. Morin J. Raymondjean M. Ferre P. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), did not display a DNase I cleavage site (27Rufo C. Gasperikova D. Clarke S.D. Teran-Garcia M. Nakamura M.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 400-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation we were also unable to demonstrate that the +283 to +303 region imparted glucose responsiveness to the fatty-acid synthase promoter. 2C. Rufo, M. Teran-Garcia, M. T. Nakamura, and S. D. Clarke, unpublished data. The two DNase I hypersensitivity sites between −600 and +50 corresponded to the regions within the fatty-acid synthase promoter, which contain insulin response sequences (18Moustaid N. Beyer R.S.

Moreover, insulin treatment of hepatocytes transfected with constructs containing this region of the proximal promoter region increased fatty-acid synthase promoter activity 2–3-fold, but the proximal promoter region failed to confer glucose responsiveness to the fatty-acid synthase promoter (Fig. 1). On the other hand, when the distal region of −7382 to −6970 was linked to the proximal sequences of the fatty-acid synthase gene, fatty-acid synthase promoter activity was increased 3–4-fold (27Rufo C. Gasperikova D. Clarke S.D. Teran-Garcia M. Nakamura M.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 400-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and the transcriptional activity of the promoter was comparable with the rate of gene transcription observed in rats fed a high glucose diet (5Paulauskis J.D.

Interestingly, the 3–4-fold enhancement of fatty-acid synthase promoter activity contributed by the sequences between −7382 and −6970 was approximately that amount required for the proximal promoter region of −444 to +67 to achieve in vivo rates of fatty-acid synthase gene transcription (19Latasa M.J.

Commun. 1999; 261: 400-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).The above observations suggested to us that perhaps the proximal promoter region imparted insulin control to the fatty-acid synthase promoter, while the distal sequences between −7382 and −6970 conferred carbohydrate stimulation to the promoter. Consequently the sequences between −7382 and −6970 were examined more closely for their role in the glucose induction of fatty-acid synthase gene transcription. Functional mapping studies indicated that the −7382 to −6970 region contained glucose-responsive sequences. More importantly, the glucose enhancement of fatty-acid synthase promoter activity appeared to be independent of insulin (Fig. 1). The ability of glucose to enhance fatty-acid synthase promoter activity by an insulin-independent mechanism is consistent with early observations showing that the feeding of fructose to diabetic rats induced hepatic fatty-acid synthase gene expression (39Spence J.T. Pitot H.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 128: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 40Wilson M.D. Hays R.D. Clarke S.D. J. Nutr. 1986; 116: 1511-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).The glucose-responsive element within the distal region of the fatty-acid synthase gene appears to reside within the area of −7242 to −7150 (Fig. 1). Sequence analysis revealed that this 100-nucleotide region contains candidate recognition sites for several transcription factors, including C/EBPα and NF-1, but the sequence located between −7240 and −7190 was of particular interest, because it possesses characteristics that are similar to the ChoRE of the l-type pyruvate kinase and S14 genes. Like the ChoRE of the l-type pyruvate kinase and S14genes, the E-box motif of the ChoRE for fatty-acid synthase exists as palindromic sequences that are separated by a 5-bp spacer (Fig. 3). In the case of the fatty-acid synthase ChoRE, one motif contains a five out of six nucleotide match and the other displays a four out of six nucleotide match with the ChoRE of the other two genes. Mutation analysis of the rat S14 and l-type pyruvate kinase genes indicates that the first 4 bp (CACG) of the E-box are critical to conferring glucose responsiveness, while mutations in the fifth and sixth positions did not disrupt the glucose response (41Hasegawa J. Osatomi K. Wu R. Uyeda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1100-1107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Spacing between the E-boxes is critical to the function of the ChoRE, because shortening the spacer to 4 bp resulted in a loss of the glucose response, and lengthening the spacing sequence to 6 bp blunted the glucose response (28Shih H. Liu Z. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21991-21997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar).The type of transcription factor that interacts with the ChoRE of the fatty-acid synthase gene and functions as the target for the glucose signal is unknown, but the 5′-CACGTG sequence is a consensus binding sequence for basic/helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper transcription factors (28Shih H. Liu Z. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21991-21997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Hasegawa et al. (41Hasegawa J. Osatomi K. Wu R. Uyeda K. J. Biol.

However, this unknown protein interacted weakly with the ChoRE of the rat S14gene and did not interact at all with comparable motifs in the acetyl-CoA carboxylase and citrate lyase genes. Moreover the insulin response element between −71 and −50 is not a glucose response sequence for the fatty-acid synthase gene (Fig. 1). In contrast we found that the unique ChoRF of rat liver nuclei (25Koo S-H. Dutcher A.D. Towle H.C. J. Biol.

Surprisingly, elevated PKA activity also resulted intense phosphocentrin antibody labeling of interphase centrosomes and in the concurrent movement of individual centrioles apart from one another.

Int. Rev. Cytol. 1996; 169: 25-82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once in each cell cycle, the centrosome is duplicated to give rise to two centrosomes (spindle poles) that organize the microtubule array of the mitotic spindle. Centrosomes consist of a closely associated pair of centrioles and a pericentriolar matrix that surrounds and connects the individual centrioles to one another and to microtubules. Pericentriolar matrix has the properties of a gel as evidenced by the exclusion of small cytoplasmic particles such as ribosomes and membrane vesicles from the centrosome. At three times during the cell cycle centrioles move apart from one another. The first time occurs immediately following mitosis when the centriole pair transiently splits during or just after telophase. At this time the older centriole remains near the cell center while the younger centriole wanders extensively throughout the cytoplasm before returning to reside near its older partner (2Piel M. Meyer P. Khodjakov A. Rieder C.L. Bornens M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 317-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The second separation of the centriole pair occurs later in G1 phase as cells pass the restriction point and the pair of centrioles become disoriented and slightly separated from one another in the first identifiable event of centrosome duplication (3Hinchcliffe E.H. Cassels G.O. Rieder C.L. Sluder G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The third time centriole pairs move apart from one another occurs as cells enter prophase when newly duplicated centrosomes (each containing a pair of centrioles) separate and migrate to opposite sides of the nucleus where they function as mitotic spindle poles (4Mayor T. Stierhof Y.D. Tanaka K. Fry A.M. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Changes in centrosome function at the time of the G2/M transition are regulated by phosphorylation since centrosomes undergo an increase in protein phosphorylation at this time (5Centonze V.E. Borisy G.G. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 405-411PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that specific phosphorylation events also take place at the centrosome at other times during the cell cycle (9Fry A.M. Mayor T. Nigg E.A. Palazzo R.E. Schatten G.P. Centrosome in Cell Replication and Early Development. Academic Press, San Diego2000: 291-312Google Scholar). Numerous kinases known to regulate cell cycle progression localize at centrosomes and mitotic spindle poles, including Cdk2 and Cdk4/6, polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), NIMA-related kinase (Nek2), pEg2, and cAMP-dependent kinase (PKA).1 Several of the centrosome-specific substrates of these kinases have been identified (for recent reviews, see Refs. 9 and 10). Protein phosphorylation has been implicated in a variety of centrosome functions including centrosome duplication, maturation and separation, microtubule nucleation, and specification of cleavage furrow formation (9Fry A.M. Mayor T. Nigg E.A. Palazzo R.E. Schatten G.P. Centrosome in Cell Replication and Early Development. Academic Press, San Diego2000: 291-312Google Scholar). Cdk2/cyclin E activity coordinates centrosome duplication with the DNA replication cycle (11Mussman J.G. Horn H.F. Carroll P.E. Okuda M. Tarapore P. Donehower L.A. Fukasawa K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1635-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Centrin is a 20-kDa protein of the EF-hand superfamily of calcium-binding proteins that is a component of centrioles themselves and the surrounding pericentriolar matrix (16Salisbury J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Gene disruption experiments demonstrate that yeast centrin (Cdc31p) is essential for cell viability (19Spang A. Courtney I. Fackler U. Matzner M. Schiebel E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 405-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Additionally, two distinct centrin mutations have been described that result in either failure of centrosome (spindle pole body) duplication and separation resulting in monopolar spindles and cell cycle arrest, or precocious and inappropriate centrosome separation at the time of cell division resulting in cells with the incorrect number of centrioles/basal bodies (20Baum P. Furlong C. Byers B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5512-5516Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Three separate human centrin genes that encode and express centrin have been identified (23Errabolu R. Sanders M.A. Salisbury J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 9-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A conserved carboxyl-terminal region of centrins from diverse species includes a consensus motif for protein phosphorylation that is typical for serine/threonine kinases (26Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Centrin phosphorylation in lower eukaryotes has been shown to correlate with extension of centrin-containing fibers associated with centrioles/basal bodies (27Martindale V.E. Salisbury J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 96: 395-402PubMed Google Scholar, 28Salisbury J.L. Baron A. Surek B. Melkonian M. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 962-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). More recently, aberrant centrin phosphorylation has been demonstrated in human breast tumors that have amplified centrosomes containing supernumerary centrioles and/or excess pericentriolar material (29Lingle W.L. Lutz W.H. Ingle J.N. Maihle N.J. Salisbury J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2950-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). The objective of this study was to investigate the cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of centrin and to characterize the specific site of phosphorylation on the protein. Using an antibody that is specific for phosphorylated centrin and standard biochemical methods, we demonstrate that in cultured vertebrate cells, centrin is phosphorylated near its carboxyl terminus at serine residue 170 early in mitosis when the newly duplicated centrosomes separate to give rise to the mitotic spindle poles. The spindle pole localization of phosphocentrin remains high until metaphase and then diminishes to basal levels by telophase. The timing of centrin phosphorylation suggests that phosphorylation of centrin may initiate the separation of duplicated centrosomes in preparation for mitotic spindle formation. Experimental elevation of protein kinase A (PKA) activity in interphase cells also results in the phosphorylation of centrin at serine residue 170 and the concomitant movement of centrioles away from one another in a manner similar to the transient separation of the pair of centrioles that normally occurs preceding centrosome duplication which begins at about the time of the G1/S transition. These observations suggest that centrin phosphorylation plays a role in mitotic spindle pole and centriole separation at key stages of the cell cycle. Rat brain protein kinase C was obtained from Calbiochem, cyclin-dependent protein kinase 1 (Cdc2 kinase) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc., and [γ-32P]ATP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. SulfolinkTM coupling gel immobilization kit was obtained from Pierce Chemical Co. Cellulose-coated (0.1 mm) TLC plates without fluorescence indicator were from Curtin Matheson Scientific, Inc. The catalytic subunit of PKA from bovine heart, phosphatidylserine,l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin, calyculin A, dibutyryl-cyclic monophosphate (Bt2cAMP), citrate lyase, isobutyl-1-methyxanthine (IBMX),l-phenylalanine hydroxylase, phosphorylase kinase, and fructose-G-phosphate kinase were obtained from Sigma. HeLa and QT6 cells were grown in 100-mm plates in modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (and 1% chicken serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) for QT6 cultures), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For immunofluorescence studies, HeLa cells were plated onto 12-mm diameter glass coverslips and used before cells reached confluence. Cells were arrested in S phase of the cell cycle by 2.5 mm thymidine treatment for 16 h or in G2/M phase by 1 μm nocodazole treatment for 8 h (30Fantes P. Brooks R. Rickwood D. Hames B.D. The Cell Cycle. Oxford University Press, New York1993Google Scholar). Cell cycle arrest was analyzed by flow cytometry. For in vivophosphorylation studies, cultured cells were grown as described above except that during the final 4 h of incubation they were washed and then incubated in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Specialty Media) with dialyzed serum containing the appropriate drug treatments and 0.2 mCi of32PO4 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Because high phosphatase activity in HeLa extracts resulted in substantial loss of centrin phosphorylation, QT6 fibroblasts, which have lower phosphatase activity in cell lysates, were used in the experiments reported here involving 32PO4 incorporationin vivo. A synthetic peptide HCT-12 (EFLRIMKKTSLY) corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 12 amino acid residues of human centrin 2 (CETN2, see Table I) was synthesized by Merrifield solid phase on 0.5 mmol of 4-hydroxymethyphenoxy (Wang) copolystyrene resin (Advanced Chemtech, Louisville, KY) using methods described previously (31Morbeck D.E. Roche P.C. Keutmann H.T. McCormick D.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1993; 97: 173-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (Table I). Each peptide was synthesized with 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-l-amino acid (Fmoc) derivatives (Advanced Chemtech, Louisville, KY) containing the following side chain protecting groups:N α-boc-S-triphenylmethyl (trityl) for cysteine; O-t-butyl for threonine and tyrosine;N ε-boc for lysine; O-t-butyl ester for glutamic acid; andNγ-2,2,5,7,8-pentamethylchroman-6-sulfonyl for arginine. The HCT peptides were assembled with the Fmoc-l-amino acids on a Rainin PS3 automated peptide synthesizer using PyBOP/N-methylmorpholine as the coupling reagent, and the hydroxyl amino acid serine was incorporated into the peptide as its unprotected side chain derivative Fmoc-Ser-OH. After synthesis, the peptide resins were weighed, divided into two portions, and one portion of each peptide resin was used for phosphorylation of the free serine hydroxyl group by “global” phosphite-triester phosphorylation (32Perich J.W. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1992; 40: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Both HCT-12 and HCT-P peptides were also synthesized with a free amino-terminal cysteine residue for specific coupling to maleimide activated carriers (keyhole limpet hemocyanin and bovine serum albumin) and chromatography resins.Table ICarboxy-terminal amino acid sequences for centrinSpeciesAccession No.SequenceA.

Each deprotected peptide was filtered from the resin and precipitated into cold methyl t-butyl ether. All peptides were purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a Vydac C8 column (2.2 cm × 25 cm, Vydac, Hesperia, CA) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/water and a gradient of 10 to 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/water, and collected as single homogeneous peaks. The composition of each peptide was verified by mass spectrometry on a Bio-Ion 20 mass analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Forest City, CA). Recombinant human CETN2p expressed in Escherichia coli was prepared and purified as described earlier (33Baron A.T. Errabolu R. Dinusson J. Salisbury J.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 47: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Centrin and HCT-12 (Table I) were phosphorylated in vitro by PKA at 30 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.4–0.8 mm [γ-32P]ATP (4–6 Ci/mmol) in the presence of 200 units of purified catalytic subunit of PKA for 1 to 2 h. Centrin was phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC) at 30 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, and 0.4–0.8 mm [γ-32P]ATP (4–6 Ci/mmol) in the presence of 10 μg of phosphatidylserine and 0.25 units of purified PKC from rat brain for 1 to 2 h. Centrin was phosphorylated by p34cdc2 protein kinase at 30 °C in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.4–0.8 mmol of [γ-32P]ATP (4–6 Ci/mmol) in the presence of cyclin-dependent protein kinase 1 Cdc2 from Sea Star (P. ochraceus) for 1–2 h. Phosphorylation reactions were started by addition of kinase and were terminated by freezing in liquid N2 followed by lyophilization. Lyophilized phosphorylation reaction mixtures were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli (34Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) or by SDS-Tricine PAGE for centrin peptides according to the method of Schagger and von Jagow (35Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar), and transferred to Immobulin-P membrane (Millipore) according to the methods of Hulen and co-workers (36Hulen D. Baron A. Salisbury J. Clarke M. Cell Motil Cytoskeleton. 1991; 18: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The region of the membrane containing phosphocentrin was located by autoradiography, and subjected to tryptic phosphopeptide and phosphoamino acid analysis as described by Boyle and co-workers (37Boyle W. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). The synthetic peptide HCT-P (Table I) was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used to immunize female New Zealand White rabbits. Antisera from the third and fourth bleeds were used for the experiments described in this work. An IgG fraction was prepared using a protein-A-SuperoseTM column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the methods supplied by the manufacturer. The IgG fraction was precleared on a SulfolinkTM resin (Pierce Chemical Co.) that had been coupled with HCT (Table I). Following a 12-h incubation at room temperature, unbound Ig was washed from the resin, concentrated, and applied to an affinity column consisting of SulfolinkTM gel to which had been coupled the phosphopeptide HCT-P. The bound IgG fraction was eluted (0.05m glycine, pH 2.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.15 mNaCl, 0.01 m NaF, 0.01 m Na pyrophosphate, and 0.04% azide), neutralized using 1 m Tris buffer (pH 7.2), concentrated, and stored in PBS containing 0.04% sodium azide. This affinity purified IgG fraction is referred to as αHCT-P IgG. Specificity of affinity purified αHCT-P IgG was characterized in four separate analyses (Fig. 3). 1) Specificity against the peptides HCT-Pversus HCT was determined by a Western dot blot analysis. The synthetic peptides HCT and HCT-P (200 ng/well) were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using carbonate antigen binding buffer (CB; 0.09 m NaHCO3, 0.01 mNa2CO3, and 0.02% sodium azide, pH 9.4) and a Bio-Dot apparatus (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 400 μl/well of blocking buffer (0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15m NaCl, 2% bovine serum albumin, 10% normal goat serum, 0.05% Tween 20, and 0.04% sodium azide) and incubated with Ig fractions (diluted according to the figure legend) in 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.04% sodium azide (100 μl/well). Bound Ig was detected by incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat antibodies against rabbit immunoglobulins (Cappel) using the alkaline phosphate substrate 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium. 2) Specificity of αHCT-P IgG for phosphorylated versusnonphosphorylated centrin was determined by autoradiography and Western blotting of recombinant centrin following in vitrophosphorylation by the catalytic subunit of PKA. 3) Specificity of αHCT-P IgG for phosphorylated centrin versus other substrates for PKA was determined by autoradiography and Western blotting following in vitro phosphorylation by the catalytic subunit of PKA of an equal molar mixture of recombinant centrin, citrate lyase, l-phenylalanine hydroxylase, and phosphorylase kinase. 4) Specificity of αHCT-P IgG for centrin phosphorylated by PKA versus PKC or Cdc2 kinase was determined by autoradiography and Western blotting following in vitro phosphorylation of centrin by each of the respective kinases. Cell lysates were prepared for immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis as described previously (23Errabolu R. Sanders M.A. Salisbury J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 9-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the experiments described here, extracts were immunoprecipitated using polyclonal serum 26/14-1 that recognizes centrin regardless of its phosphorylation state or the preimmune serum from the same rabbit. For Western blot analysis, centrin was resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobulin-P (polyvinylidene difluoride) membrane (Millipore), and fixed with 0.2% glutaraldehyde followed by standard procedures according to Towbin and co-workers (59Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44893) Google Scholar) and probed using either monoclonal anti-centrin 20H5 that recognizes centrin regardless of phosphorylation state or αHCT-P IgG. HeLa cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed in cold methanol (−20 °C) for 10 min and processed for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy as previously described (23Errabolu R. Sanders M.A. Salisbury J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 9-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using α-HCT-P IgG or polyclonal anti-centrin 26/14-1. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis of centrin (20 kDa) from cultured cells is shown in Fig.1 A. Cell cycle analysis and the corresponding phosphorylation status of centrin in untreated (control asynchronously cycling) cells or cells subject to cell cycle arrest by thymidine (S phase) or nocodazole treatment (G2/M phase) are shown in Fig. 1, B and C, respectively. Incorporation of 32PO4 into centrin was highest in cultures arrested with 4C DNA (G2/M) content by nocodazole treatment, while cultures arrested in S phase by thymidine treatment show the lowest levels of incorporation and control (cycling) cultures showed an intermediate level of32PO4 incorporation. These results suggest that centrin phosphorylation is maximum during mitosis. Centrins from a variety of species share a highly conserved sequence at their carboxyl termini (Table I) that includes a consensus amino acid motif (KKXS*X) for phosphorylation by PKA (38Hardie G. Hanks S. Hardie G. Hanks S. The Protein Kinase FactsBook: Protein-Serine Kinases. Academic Press, New York1995: 418Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed centrin and a synthetic peptide, HCT-12, corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 12 amino acids of CETN2 (Table I), are readily phosphorylated by PKAin vitro (Fig. 2). Tryptic digestion and two-dimensional analysis of the phosphorylated products reveals a single negatively charged major and a neutral minor32P-labeled tryptic peptide for both the recombinant protein and the synthetic peptide (Fig. 2, B andC, respectively). The two 32P-labeled peptide fragments comigrate when tryptic digests of centrin and the synthetic peptide are first mixed and subsequently run together by two-dimensional peptide analysis (Fig. 2 D). Phosphoamino acid analysis demonstrates that serine is the 32P-labeled residue for both the major and minor peptide fragments (Fig. 2,E and F). Comparison of migration of tryptic peptides from centrin with the predicted pattern based on the computer program of Hunter (37Boyle W. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar) and the fact that there is only one potential serine phosphorylation site in the synthetic HCT peptide, allowed the unequivocal identification of serine residue 170 in the carboxyl-terminal sequence KKTSPY as the site for in vitro phosphorylation of centrin by PKA. The major negatively charged phosphopeptide (TSPLY) represents the carboxyl terminus (residues 169–172) of centrin and the minor neutral peptide fragment (KTSPLY) represents an alternative partial tryptic product (residues 168–172) resulting from the less efficient trypsin cleavage activity between adjacent lysine residues (37Boyle W. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Because the carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation site is highly conserved among divergent species (Table I) we raised a phosphocentrin-specific antibody to study in vivophosphorylation of centrin in cultured HeLa cells. We first prepared a 13-amino acid synthetic peptide, HCT-12, which contains the last 12 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of human centrin (residues 160–172, see Table I) plus an amino-terminal cysteine residue for convenience in coupling via its sulfhydryl group to either immunogenic haptens or to affinity matrices. This peptide was prepared either in a non-phosphorylated form (human centrincarboxyl-terminus, HCT) or with the serine residue synthetically phosphorylated (HCT-P). Rabbit antiserum raised against the phosphorylated peptide HCT-P was found in preliminary experiments to label mitotic spindle poles. In order to obtain antibodies that were uniquely specific for phosphorylated centrin and that showed no cross-reactivity against the nonphosphorylated centrin, we first precleared the IgG fraction against HCT and then affinity purified the preparation using resin-conjugated HCT-P as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Analysis using a Western dot blot assay demonstrated exquisite specificity of the affinity purified αHCT-P IgG fraction for the phosphorylated HCT-P peptide with little or no reactivity of this IgG fraction against the non-phosphorylated HCT peptide (Fig. 3 A). This affinity purified IgG fraction was further tested for its specificity toward the whole protein using recombinant centrin that was first phosphorylated in vitro by PKA using [32P]ATP (Fig. 3 B). In this experiment, centrin was incubated with PKA under conditions in which only about half of the protein became phosphorylated. Subsequent analysis by SDS electrophoresis in a 15% polyacrylamide gel resolved centrin into two closely migrating bands of around 20 kDa that could be detected by Western blot analysis using a monoclonal anti-centrin ascites (20H5) that recognizes centrin regardless of its phosphorylation state (Fig. 3 B). Autoradiography (Fig. 3 B, 32 P-label) demonstrated that the slower migrating centrin band represented the phosphorylated protein while the more rapidly migrating band showed no32P label. Analysis of a companion gel transfer prepared with the identical sample, but Western blotted with the affinity purified αHCT-P IgG, demonstrated a remarkable specificity for the PKA-phosphorylated form of centrin and showed little if any reactivity with the non-phosphorylated protein (Fig. 3 B: αHCT-P). A control experiment was performed in which several known substrates for PKA were combined at equal molar ratios with centrin, followed byin vitro incubation under complete reaction conditions with PKA and [32P]ATP, and subsequent analysis by SDS-PAGE, autoradiography, and Western blotting (Fig. 3 C). In this experiment the affinity purified αHCT-P IgG specifically and exclusively recognized phosphocentrin and no other PKA-phosphorylated proteins (Fig. 3 C, Western (w)), even when present at equivalent levels and having significant32P incorporation (Fig. 3 C, autoradiograph (a)). A second control experiment was performed in which centrin was phosphorylated by one of three distinct protein kinases: PKA, PKC, or p34cdc2 kinase (Cdc2) and subsequently analyzed by Western blotting with monoclonal 20H5 or αHCT-P IgG (Fig. 3 D). Centrin is phosphorylated by all three kinases in vitro (Fig. 3 D, 32 P) and analysis by phosphopeptide mapping demonstrated that each kinase tested phosphorylated distinct sites on centrin (not shown). Only PKA phosphorylation resulted in gel mobility retardation of centrin and only the PKA-phosphorylated form of centrin reacted with the affinity purified αHCT-P IgG (Fig. 3 D,αHCT-P). Taken together, these results demonstrate that affinity purified αHCT-P IgG specifically recognized centrin only when it was phosphorylated on the extreme carboxyl-terminal amino acid serine located at residue 170. In addition, this antibody recognized no other PKA-phosphorylated proteins or centrin itself when it was exclusively phosphorylated at sites other than serine residue 170. HeLa cells grown on glass coverslips were processed for indirect immunofluorescence using affinity purified αHCT-P IgG. When fields of subconfluent cells were observed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy a vast majority of the cells showed no apparent labeling above background when stained with αHCT-P IgG (Figs. 4 C and 5, Aand B). Remarkably, however, dividing cells present throughout the microscope field showed clear and intense staining of their mitotic spindle poles (Figs. 4, C-F, and 5,A and B). The specificity of immunostaining of mitotic spindle poles by αHCT-P IgG was evaluated following competition of the antibody preparation with the peptides HCT-P and HCT. The affinity purified αHCT-P IgG was used at a constant and known dilution (1.5 μg/ml IgG), preincubated with known amounts of the phosphorylated peptide HCT-P or the nonphosphorylated peptide HCT, and subsequently used for indirect immunofluorescence labeling of HeLa (Fig. 4, A-F). Preincubation of αHCT-P IgG with HCT-P peptide at a molar ratio of 1:1 (antibody:peptide, calculated based on antigen-binding equivalents on the IgG) completely eliminated subsequent staining of prophase and metaphase spindle poles (Fig.4 A), while preincubation at a molar ratio of 1:0.1 resulted in a reduction but not complete elimination of subsequent staining (Fig. 4 B), and αHCT-P IgG that was not preincubated with any peptide resulted in bright staining of spindle poles (Fig.4 C) as described above. However, preincubation of the αHCT-P IgG with the nonphosphorylated peptide HCT showed reduction in staining of mitotic spindle poles at 1:0.1 (Fig. 4 F), 1:1 (Fig. 4 E), or even 1:1000 (Fig. 4 D) molar ratios of antibody:peptide (antigen-binding equivalents on the IgG:HCT). These results demonstrate that spindle pole labeling by αHCT-P IgG is exquisitely specific for the phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal serine residue 170 of centrin.Figure 5Phosphocentrin is localized at the spindle poles of HeLa"

Truncations containing a complete ligand binding domain bound glycine antagonist and gave binding constants similar to those of the native subunit, suggesting they were folding to form antagonist binding sites. Since NR2A is not transported to the cell surface unless it is associated with NR1 (McIlhinney, R. A. J., Le Bourdellès, B., Tricuad, N., Molnar, E., Streit, P., and Whiting, P. J. (1998) Neuropharmacology 37, 1355–1367), surface expression of NR2A can be used to monitor the association of the subunits. There was progressive loss of NR2A cell surface expression as the N terminus of NR1a was shortened, with complete loss when truncated beyond residue 380. Removal of the C terminus and/or the last transmembrane domain did not affect NR2A surface expression. Similar results were obtained in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The oligomerization status of the co-expressed NR1a constructs and NR2A subunits was investigated using a non-denaturing gel electrophoresis system (blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system also showed that the NR1a subunits could form a homodimer, which was confirmed using soluble constructs of the NR1a subunit. Together these results suggest the residues N-terminal of residue 380 are important for the association of NR2A with NR1a and that the complete N-terminal domain of the NR1a subunit is required for oligomerization with NR2A.

The NR1 subunit is encoded by a single gene, which undergoes extensive splicing to generate eight different splice variants that differ in regional distribution and functional properties (2Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar). The NR2 subunit class consists of four different subunits, NR2A–NR2D, encoded by four separate but closely related genes (2Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar). A number of studies of mammalian cell lines either permanently or transiently transfected with NR1 alone have indicated that the NR1 subunit does not form glycine-glutamate-responsive channels and requires the presence of NR2 to do so (3Cik M. Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 4Grimwood S. Le Bourdelles B. Whiting P.J. J.

Other studies have shown that the NR1 and NR2 subunits contribute differently to the binding sites of a functional NMDA receptor. The NR1 subunit forms the glycine binding site (6Kuryatov A. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1291-1300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 7Wafford K.A. Kathoria M. Bain C.J. Marshall G. Le Bourdelles B. Kemp J. Whiting P.J. Mol.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 581-589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, different combinations of both subunits co-assemble to form functionally distinct NMDA receptors. However, the biochemical and functional studies reported to date are ambiguous with regard to NMDA receptor subunit stoichiometry. Functional studies indicate that binding of at least two molecules of both glutamate and glycine is required for NMDA receptor activation, suggesting that at least four subunits must co-assemble (11Patneau D.K. Mayer M.L. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 2385-2399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Benveniste M. Mayer M.L. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 104: 207-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 13Clements J.D. Westbrook G.L. Neuron. 1991; 7: 605-613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The molecular size of native NMDA receptors, as determined by both gel filtration and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, is in the range of 605–850 kDa, which is consistent with the co-assembly of between four to five subunits (14Blahos J. Wenthold R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15669-15674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 15Brose N. Gasic G.P. Vetter D.E. Sullivan J.M. Heinemann S.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 24403-24409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent biochemical study has suggested that there are three NR2 subunits per NMDA receptor complex, indicating that the NMDA receptor is at least a pentamer (17Hawkins L. Chazot P. Stephenson F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27211-27218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological studies on the subunit stoichiometry using co-expressed wild-type and mutant forms of either the NR1 or NR2 subunits have also been inconclusive suggesting two or three NR1 subunits or two or three NR2 subunits per functional NMDA receptor complex (18Behe P.

The regions of NMDA receptor subunits mediating the assembly of hetero-oligomeric NMDA receptors have, to date, not been identified. All glutamate receptor subunits are thought to share a common transmembrane topology and domain structure with three transmembrane domains (TMI, -III, and -IV), a second membrane domain forming a re-entrant loop that partly lines the ion channel pore, an extracellular N terminus, and an intracellular C terminus (21Bennett J.A.

The ligand binding domain is thought to be formed between part of the N terminus (the S1 domain) just before TMI and the extracellular loop between TMIII and TMIV (the S2 domain) (6Kuryatov A.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 1345-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Approximately the first 400 amino acids of the N terminus share sequence homology to the bacterial periplasmic leucine-isoleucine-valine-binding protein (LIVBP domain) (26Ferns M. Hoch W. Campanelli J.T. Rupp F. Hall Z.W. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1079-1086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The proximal N-terminal domain has recently been suggested to be important in the assembly of AMPA receptor subunits in mammalian cells (27Leuschner W.D. Hoch W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16907-16916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In this study we addressed the question of which domains of the NR1a NMDA receptor subunit are important for their assembly into oligomeric receptor complexes. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were transfected with mutated NR1a constructs containing deletions to the N and C termini, NR1a chimeras, and soluble secreted forms of the NR1a subunit and wild-type NR2A subunits. Since we have shown previously that NR2A is not expressed at the cell surface unless it is co-expressed with NR1 (1McIlhinney R.A.J. Le Bourdellès B. Tricuad N. Molnar E. Streit P. Whiting P.J. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 1355-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), cell surface expression of the NR2A subunit has been used to monitor subunit association, together with co-immunoprecipitation of the different subunits. The formation of oligomeric complexes has been monitored using a novel nondenaturing gel electrophoresis system and sucrose gradient sedimentation. All the truncated NR1a subunits are derived from a human NR1a cDNA and were generated by using standard mutagenesis techniques previously described in detail (28Sandhu S. Grimwood S. Mortshire-Smith R.J. Whiting P.J. Le Bourdelles B. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1694-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). An octapeptide FLAG epitope tag (KDYKDDDDK) was introduced into the N terminus between Asp23 and Lys25, just C-terminal to the putative signal cleavage point. The constructs were verified by sequencing and by in vitro translation (TNT T7 Transcription/Translation System; Promega; Fig. 1). Radioligand binding assays using [3H]L-689,560 were performed as previously described in detail (4Grimwood S. Le Bourdelles B. Whiting P.J. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 28Sandhu S. Grimwood S. Mortshire-Smith R.J. Whiting P.J. Le Bourdelles B. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1694-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). HEK-293 cells were cultured and transfected using the calcium phosphate method. The NMDA receptor NR1a and NR2A subunits in the expression vectors pcDNAI/Amp and pCDM8 were transfected at a ratio of 1:3. After transfection, the cells were grown in the presence of 0.5 mm ketamine (Sigma) and harvested 24 h later. Membranes were prepared from the cells using hypotonic lysis, shearing, and centrifugation as described previously (29Robbins M.J. Ciruela F. Rhodes A. McIlhinney R.A.J. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2539-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) except that 20 mm iodoacetamide was added to the lysis medium prior to cell lysis. Adult female Xenopus laevis were anesthetized by immersion in a 0.1% solution of 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester, with the pH adjusted with 1 mNaHCO3 to that of the water in which the toad was housed, for 30–45 min, and stage V and stage VI oocytes were surgically removed. After mild collagenase treatment to remove follicle cells (type IA, 0.5 mg/ml, for 6 min), the oocyte nuclei were directly injected with 10–20 nl of injection buffer (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 15 mm HEPES, at pH 7, filtered through nitrocellulose) containing different combinations of human NMDA subunit cDNAs (20 ng/μl) engineered into the expression vector pCDM8 or pcDNAI/Amp. NR1a truncations and NR2A cDNAs were injected at a ratio of 1:3. Oocytes were maintained at 19–20 °C in modified Barth's medium consisting of 88 mm NaCl, 1 mmKCl, 10 mm HEPES, 0.82 mmMgSO4, 0.33 mmCa(NO3)2, 0.91 mmCaCl2, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, at pH 7.5 supplemented with 50 μg/ml gentamycin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 2 mm sodium pyruvate) for up to 6 days. For electrophysiological recordings, oocytes were placed in a 50-μl bath and continually perfused at 4–6 ml/min with Barium Ringer's solution (115 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1.8 mm BaCl2, pH 7.2). Cells were impaled with two 1–3-megohm electrodes containing 2m KCl and voltage-clamped at −70 mV. In all experiments drugs were applied in the perfusate until the peak of the response was observed. Transiently transfected HEK-293 cells were overlaid with borate buffer (10 mm boric acid, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.8) containing 50 μg/ml of the non-permeant reactive ester sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce; dissolved at 10 mg/ml in N,N-dimethylformamide). Unreacted ester was removed by incubating the cells for 5 min with 1 m ammonium chloride. The cells were washed with Tris-saline (pH 7.4) then lysed on ice in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA) plus a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 20 mm iodoacetamide. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g, and a tenth of the supernatant removed for total cell lysate analysis. The biotin-labeled surface proteins in the remaining supernatants were affinity isolated with 100 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma) rotating for 3.5 h at 4 °C. The resulting pellets were washed twice with RIPA buffer and twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and proteins eluted from the streptavidin-agarose beads by addition of 2× reducing sample buffer (20 mmdithiothreitol, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mmTris-HCl). The samples were then analyzed using SDS-PAGE and the Western immunoblot protocol. The possibility that the sulfo-NHS-biotin penetrates the cells during the biotinylation procedure was controlled for by probing the total cell lysates and streptavidin isolates for the intracellular protein β-tubulin. Only those experiments in which this control was negative were used for analysis. Transiently transfected HEK-293 cells were lysed on ice with RIPA buffer containing 20 mmiodoacetamide and protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g, and an aliquot was removed for total cell lysate analysis. A fifth of the lysate was made up to 1 ml with lysis buffer and then rotated overnight at 4 °C with 1–2 μg/ml precipitating antibody. A 100-μl suspension of Protein G-Sepharose Fast Flow beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to the precipitates and mixed by rotation at 4 °C for 2 h. The immunoprecipitates were pelleted by centrifugation, and the resulting pellet was washed twice in RIPA buffer and then twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Under these conditions, quantitative immunoprecipitation of the subunits was achieved. The immunocomplexes were eluted from the Protein G beads by mixing with 2× reducing sample buffer and boiling the samples. Both the precipitates and total cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblot. The antibodies used for immunoprecipitation were a sheep anti-NR1a antibody (previously characterized; Ref. 1McIlhinney R.A.J. Le Bourdellès B. Tricuad N. Molnar E. Streit P. Whiting P.J. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 1355-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and the anti-FLAG antibody M2 from Sigma. The NR1-GluR1 chimera was precipitated using an anti-GluR1 antibody (30Molnar E. McIlhinney R.A.J. Baude A. Nusser Z. Somogyi P. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE using 7.5% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions. After transfer to nitrocellulose membrane using a Transblot semidry transfer cell (Bio-Rad), the membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.05% Tween for 1 h. The primary antibodies, applied to the immunoblots overnight at 4 °C, were a rabbit anti-NR2A antibody and the 23.F6 antibody, which recognizes the N terminus of NR2A (1McIlhinney R.A.J. Le Bourdellès B. Tricuad N. Molnar E. Streit P. Whiting P.J. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 1355-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The NR1 subunit was detected using antibodies directed to residues 600–800 (NMDAR1; PharMingen) or to residues 1–564 of the subunit (Calbiochem) or the C-terminal tail. The primary antibodies were detected using the donkey anti-sheep (Sigma; 1/2000), goat anti-rabbit, or goat anti-mouse (Promega; 1/5000) antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in conjunction with the chemiluminescence SuperSignal kit (Pierce). Analysis of the oligomeric structure of native protein complexes was achieved by using a modification of the method of BN-PAGE as described previously (31Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 220-231Crossref Scopus (1918) Google Scholar, 32Schagger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Membrane samples were prepared by mixing with 1 mg/ml DNase (+10 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2) and leaving at room temperature for 15 min. An equal volume of 2× BN-PAGE sample buffer (200 mm BisTris, 150 mm6-aminocaproic acid, 2% Triton X-100, pH 7) was added to each sample and left on ice for 15 min. The membrane samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g and mixed with 5% Serva blue dye. The markers thyroglobulin, bovine serum albumin, apoferritin, and β-amylase were mixed with 5% Serva blue dye and run with the samples on a 5–18% gel containing no detergent. The samples and markers were stacked at 100 V and then run at a constant 500 V (15 mA; 4 °C). The gel was then subjected to a revised Western immunoblot protocol. Excess dye from the top membrane was removed with destain (34% methanol, 10% acetic acid, 2% glycerol in H2O). The marker lanes were stained with Coomassie Blue dye (50% methanol, 10% acetic acid, 0.2% (w/v) Coomassie Blue) and then destained to visualize the protein bands. The section of the membrane containing the proteins was washed with phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.05% Tween and processed in the same manner as the SDS-PAGE immunoblots. In order to calibrate the gel, membranes from cells expressing GABAA receptors of composition α3β3γ2 and purified Torpedo nACh receptors (nAChR) were used. The sera used for identification were anti-α3 for the GABAAreceptor and monoclonal antibody 210 (mAb210) for the nAChR, which recognizes an epitope on the α1 subunit. These receptors and antibodies were generously provided by Merck Sharp & Dohme and Professor Lindstrom, University of Pennsylvania, respectively. HEK-293 cell lysates were prepared by lysis in 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in Tris-saline lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors and 20 mmiodoacetamide. Sucrose density centrifugation of HEK-293 cell lysates was performed using cell lysates layered on 4-ml continuous 10–40% (w/v) sucrose gradients centrifuged in a SW60 Sorvall rotor for 16 h at 100,000 × g, 4 °C. Twenty fractions were collected from each gradient and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Five replicate 25-cm2 flasks for each secreted protein were transfected with 10 μg of DNA. Fresh AimV medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), containing no serum and supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine and 100 units/ml penicillin, was added 24 h after transfection, and the cells were left for another 3 days of growth. The medium, with added protease inhibitors, was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant removed and concentrated down 5-fold using Vivaspin 4-ml concentration tubes. The concentrated medium was filtered and analyzed by chromatography on a Superose 6 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a Liquid Chromatography Controller LCC-500. The fractions were analyzed by dot-blot, using nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), and SDS-PAGE and both membranes processed using the Western immunoblot protocol. The structures of the different NR1a constructs used in this study are illustrated in Fig. 1. All of the NR1a truncated subunits, with the exception of the NR1aΔ7, NR1aΔ8, the NR1a N-terminal truncation, and the NR1-GluR1 chimera, formed high affinity binding sites for the glycine antagonist [3H]l-689,560 when expressed in HEK-293 cells (28Sandhu S. Grimwood S. Mortshire-Smith R.J. Whiting P.J. Le Bourdelles B. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1694-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Since the NR1 truncations that did not bind the glycine antagonist contain deletions that remove parts of the S1 domain important for the formation of the glycine binding site, these results are in agreement with our current understanding of the structure of other glutamate receptor subunits. HEK-293 cells co-expressing the NR1a constructs containing deletions up to residue 380 in the N terminus (NR1aΔ2-NR1aΔ4) and NR2A were analyzed for the expression of functional channels inXenopus oocytes (Table I). Although unmodified NR1a and the NR1aΔ2 and NR1aΔ3 constructs formed functional channels with NR2A at the cell surface, deletion up to residue 380 within the N-terminal domain of NR1a (NR1aΔ4) abolished NMDA channel function (Table I). Similar data were also obtained in HEK-293 cells (data not shown). The currents found in the NR1aΔ2 and NR1aΔ3 constructs were reduced in amplitude compared with those seen with the wild-type NR1a and NR2A subunits, suggesting that these truncated subunits form smaller numbers of functional channels at the cell surface. Deletion of the C terminus (NR1aΔ1) and TMIV (NR1aΔ5) also produced no detectable functional channels with NR2A. Since NR1aΔ4 forms a functional glycine binding site, these results show that the amino acid sequence before residue 380 is important for the formation of functional NMDA receptors.Table IElectrophysiology data from Xenopus oocytes and HEK-293 cells co-expressing the NR1a truncations with NR2ACurrent inXenopus oocytespANR1a + NR2A2107 ± 460 (n = 13)NR1aΔ1 + NR2A598 ± 272 (n = 6)NR1aΔ2 + NR2A209 ± 37 (n = 7)NR1aΔ3 + NR2A472 ± 149 (n = 6)NR1aΔ4 + NR2A0 (n = 9)NR1aΔ5 + NR2A0 (n = 9)Electrophysiological assays using 10 μm glutamate + 10 μm glycine were carried out in Xenopusoocytes injected with the indicated NR1a constructs and wild-type NR2A. Open table in a new tab Electrophysiological assays using 10 μm glutamate + 10 μm glycine were carried out in Xenopusoocytes injected with the indicated NR1a constructs and wild-type NR2A. Cell surface expression of the NR2A subunit was determined by cell surface biotinylation following co-expression with the NR1a truncations. As reported previously (1McIlhinney R.A.J. Le Bourdellès B. Tricuad N. Molnar E. Streit P. Whiting P.J. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 1355-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), co-expression of NR1a and NR2A resulted in a streptavidin-isolated 180-kDa immunoreactive band, which was absent when NR2A was expressed alone (Fig.2 A). Progressive deletions to the N-terminal domain of NR1a led to a progressive decrease in the cell surface expression of NR2A until, with NR1aΔ4, there was no detectable surface NR2A (Fig. 2 B). Similarly, no detectable levels of cell surface NR2A were found when the subunit was co-expressed with NR1aΔ7 and NR1aΔ8 (data not shown). Strikingly, the presence of a complete N terminus but deleted C terminus and TMIV of NR1a (NR1aΔ1 and NR1aΔ5, respectively) did not affect cell surface expression of NR2A (Fig. 2 C). It should be noted that generally the levels of immunoreactive NR1a, the NR1a truncations, and NR2A were comparable in the cell lysates (Fig. 2, B andC, lysates). It is unlikely, therefore, that the differences in the surface expression of the constructs reflects differing levels of expression of the proteins. With the exception of NR1aΔ5, the cell surface expression data are in good agreement with the functional channel data, which suggests that the subunits can assemble to form functional channels provided the deletions in the N terminus of NR1a occur before residue 380. The lack of ion channel formation following expression of NR1aΔ5 with NR2A must therefore reflect some other effect of the loss of TMIV from the NR1a subunit, since this truncation does give rise to surface expression of NR2A. Since cell surface expression of NR2A might reflect both subunit association and oligomerization, co-immunoprecipitation studies were performed to determine the level of association of NR2A with the different NR1a truncations. The results showed that truncation of NR1a at the C terminus had no effect on the association of the subunits as illustrated for NR1aΔ5 (Fig.3 A). However, truncation of the N terminus resulted in a progressive loss of co-immunoprecipitating NR2A, which was barely detectable with NR1aΔ7 or NR1aΔ8 (Fig.3 B). Thus, there appears to be some residual association of NR1aΔ4 with NR2A, although this subunit does not give rise to either functional channels or surface expression of NR2A when the subunits are expressed together. The results above could be interpreted as suggesting that the N-terminal region of NR1a from residues 1–380 are critical for subunit association. To test if they are sufficient for this, we have expressed NR2A with NR1a truncated just after the putative re-entrant loop of the second membrane domain and a chimera of NR1 where the N terminus of NR1a replaces that of GluR1 (Fig. 1). Co-expression of the NR1 truncation and NR1-GluR1 chimera with NR2A in HEK-293 cells did not give rise to cell surface expression (Fig.4 A), nor did they co-immunoprecipitate with NR2A (Fig. 4 B). This suggests that residual precipitation seen when NR1aΔ4 and NR2A are co-expressed (Fig. 3 B) is unlikely to be nonspecific and could suggest that the NR1a N-terminal alone may not be sufficient for association with NR2A. The BN-PAGE described by Schagger et al. (31Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 220-231Crossref Scopus (1918) Google Scholar, 32Schagger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar) was adapted to provide a method for the determination of NMDA receptor subunit assembly. In the course of these studies, the BN-PAGE system has also been used to investigate nAChR oligomerization and the domains that are important in glycine receptor assembly (33Nicke A. Rettinger J. Mutschler E. Schmalzing G. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1999; 19: 493-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 34Griffon N. Buttner C. Nicke A. Kuhse J. Schmalzing G. Betz H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4711-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). When BN-PAGE is used to analyze membranes derived from HEK-293 cells expressing the NR1a subunit alone, immunoreactive bands with apparent molecular masses of 200 and 420 kDa can be detected (Fig.5 A). The amount of the 200-kDa NR1a-immunoreactive band detected was variable and could reflect the different expression levels of the subunits in the different membrane preparations. When NR2A was co-expressed with NR1a, the molecular mass of the major NR1a immunoreactive species always shifted to give a broad band with a mean molecular mass of 860 kDa, with two additional immunoreactive bands at 420 and 200 kDa. Consistently, NR2A immunoreactivity could also be detected in the 860-kDa band but was not detected in the 200-kDa NR1a immunoreactive band (Fig. 5 A). However, NR2A could also be detected in an immunoreactive band with a molecular mass of ∼420 kDa when the 23.F6 antibody is used for detection, probably reflecting the greater sensitivity of this antibody compared with the anti-FLAG antibody. The intensity of this band, like that of the NR1a 200-kDa band, could be variable. The expression of the NR2A subunit alone in HEK-293 membranes resulted in streaking of the immunoreactive material, suggesting that the NR2A subunit might not be folding properly in the absence of NR1a (Fig. 5 A,right panel). Because the molecular sizes of the other receptor complexes analyzed by BN-PAGE have been reported to be larger than expected, the modified gel system used here for the NMDA receptors was used to analyze GABAA receptors and Torpedo nAChR of known stoichiometry (32Schagger H.

It is important to understand the structural basis of the interaction of DBL domains with host receptors. This may allow the development of receptor-blocking agents that inhibit invasion or reverse cytoadherence. Receptor binding DBL domains are also attractive vaccine candidates because antibodies directed against such functional domains may block their interaction with erythrocytes or endothelial receptors. Here, we describe methods to produce milligram quantities of correctly folded recombinant PvRII, the binding domain of P. vivaxDuffy-binding protein, which contains around 350 amino acids, including 12 cysteines. Recombinant PvRII has been expressed in Escherichia coli purified from inclusion bodies under denaturing conditions and refolded in vitro into its native conformation. We demonstrate that refolded PvRII is highly immunogenic and elicits high titer antibodies that can inhibit the binding of P. vivaxDuffy-binding protein to erythrocytes, providing support for the development of recombinant PvRII as a vaccine candidate for P. vivax malaria. Large scale production of functional DBL domains is now possible, opening avenues for more extensive biochemical, structural, and immunological studies. DNA encoding PvRII (amino acids 194–521 ofP. vivax Duffy-binding protein) fused to hexa-histidine (6-His) at the C-terminal end was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers 5′-GCA TGC CAT GGA TCA TAA GAA AAC GAT CT-3′ and 5′-CGA GTG TCG ACT CAG TGA TGG TGA TGG TGA TGT GTC ACA ACT TCC TGA GT-3′ and a plasmid containing the gene encoding P. vivaxDuffy-binding protein as template (18Fang X. Kaslow D.C. Adams J.H. Miller L.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 44: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with NcoI and SalI and cloned as a NcoI-SalI fragment downstream of the T7 promoter in expression vector pET28a+ (Novagen) to yield plasmid pVPET1. E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain (Novagen) was transformed with plasmid pVPET1 and used for expression of recombinant PvRII. Luria broth containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml) was inoculated with E. coliBL21(DE3)pVPET1 and cultured overnight at 37 °C. Fresh Luria broth containing kanamycin (25 μg/ml) was inoculated with the overnight culture at a dilution of 1:50 and cultured at 37 °C to anA600 nm of 0.6–0.8. Expression of PvRII was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside to the culture at a final concentration of 1 mm. Induced cultures were allowed to grow for 4 h at 37 °C. AFter induction, E. coli cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed in chilled wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl), resuspended in chilled lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm benzamidine-HCl, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 200 μg/ml lysozyme), and lysed by sonication. Inclusion bodies were collected by centrifugation of lysed cells at 4 °C, solubilized in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl), and treated with 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) for 2 h at 37 °C. After removal of DTT by ultrafiltration using filters with 10-kDa cutoff, recombinant PvRII was purified from solubilized inclusion bodies by metal affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions using a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid column as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen). Solubilized inclusion bodies were loaded on a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid column previously equilibrated with equilibration buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaH2PO4, 6 mGdnHCl). The column was washed with equilibration buffer at pH 6.3, and bound protein was eluted using a pH gradient starting at pH 6.3 and ending at pH 4.3. The final concentration of the purified protein was adjusted to ∼4.5 mg/ml with equilibration buffer. Purified PvRII was refolded by 100-fold dilution in refolding buffer containing 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 1 mm reduced glutathione, 0.1 mm oxidized glutathione, 1 murea, and 0.5 m arginine so that the final protein concentration was ∼45 μg/ml. Refolding was allowed to proceed at 10 °C for 36 h with stirring. At the end of 36 h, the refolding solution was dialyzed for 48 h against dialysis buffer (50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 1 m urea) to remove arginine before proceeding with purification by ion-exchange chromatography. After removal of arginine by dialysis, the refolded protein was loaded on an SP-Sepharose column equilibrated with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. The bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (100 mm NaCl to 1.5m NaCl). Fractions containing refolded PvRII were pooled, and PvRII was further purified by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For gel filtration chromatography, 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 200 mm NaCl was used. Refolded PvRII was loaded on a reverse phase C8 column. The gradient used for elution was developed using Buffer A (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in water) and Buffer B (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in 90% acetonitrile, 10% water). The column was initially equilibrated with 90% Buffer A and 10% Buffer B and reached a composition of 10% Buffer A and 90% Buffer B in 40 min. Automated Edman degradation was carried out using an Applied Biosystems 491 protein sequencer using standard methods. Approximately 100 pmol of purified refolded PvRII was used for the N-terminal sequencing reaction. Mass spectral analysis of refolded, purified PvRII was performed by electron spray ionization mass spectroscopy using a Hewlett Packard HP100 Series LC/MSD mass spectrometer by standard procedures. Analysis of free protein thiol was carried out using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) according to the method of Ellman (40Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21616) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of the assay was determined using known amounts of cysteine. Free thiol could be clearly detected at a concentration of 30 μm. The presence of free thiols in refolded, purified PvRII was determined in the presence of 6m GdnHCl to promote side chain availability. CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco-J720 spectropolarimeter. Spectra of purified, refolded PvRII in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, were recorded as the average of 10 individual spectral scans in the far-UV region from 184 to 260 nm using a cuvette with a path length of 0.1 cm and the following instrument parameters: instrument sensitivity, 1 millidegrees; response time, 2 s; scan speed, 50 nm/min. Concentration of PvRII used for CD spectroscopy was measured by the BCA protein assay method (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Deconvolution of the CD spectra was performed using the method of Bohmet al. (41Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Blood collected in 10% citrate phosphate dextrose was stored at 4 °C for up to 4 weeks and washed three times in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) before use. Duffy phenotypes of erythrocytes were determined by standard blood-typing methods using two antisera (anti-Fya and anti-Fyb) (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics). Duffy negative erythrocytes, Fy(a−b−), did not react with either anti-Fya or anti-Fyb. Duffy-positive erythrocytes used in the erythrocyte binding assays had the phenotype Fy(a+b+). Refolded PvRII was incubated with Duffy-positive and Duffy-negative human erythrocytes at room temperature for 1 h to allow binding. The reaction mixture was layered over dibutylpthalate (Sigma) and centrifuged to collect erythrocytes. Bound protein was eluted from the erythrocytes with 300 mm NaCl, separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by Western blot using rabbit serum raised against a 42-amino acid peptide derived from PvRII (amino acids 378–420 of P. vivax Duffy-binding protein). Different quantities of refolded PvRII (100, 200, 400, 800, 2000 ng) were immuno-precipitated as described below using polyclonal rabbit serum raised against refolded PvRII, separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by Western blotting using a commercially available mouse monoclonal antibody raised against penta-histidine (5-His) (Qiagen) to determine the sensitivity of detection. Immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating refolded PvRII with a rabbit polyclonal serum raised against PvRII at a dilution of 1:200 for 1 h on ice and with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at room temperature for 1 h. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed once with 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.15m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4 (NETT) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and twice with NETT buffer without bovine serum albumin. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling, separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by Western blot using a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against 5-His (Qiagen). 100 ng of refolded PvRII can be clearly detected by this method. Refolded PvRII (8 μg) was preabsorbed four times with 800 μl of packed Duffy-positive human erythrocytes to remove active PvRII before immunoprecipitation. Preabsorption with an equal number of Duffy-negative human erythrocytes was used as a control. Residual PvRII left after preabsorption was detected by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting as described. Rabbits used in this study were procured from the Animal Facility of the International Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, New Delhi, India. Animals were housed, fed, and used in experiments according to the guidelines set forth in the National Institutes of Health manual titled Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health Publication 86–23, United States Department of Health and Human Services, Washington D. C.). Two 8-week-old New Zealand White rabbits were immunized with 200 μg of recombinant PvRII emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant and delivered by the subcutaneous route. The rabbits were boosted on day 28 with 100 μg of PvRII formulated in incomplete Freund's adjuvant delivered by the subcutaneous route. One rabbit was immunized with adjuvant alone according to the schedule described above to provide control antiserum. Rabbits were bled on days 0 (preimmune), 27, and 42, and the sera were used for immunoassays. Rabbit sera were tested for recognition of recombinant PvRII using an ELISA. Briefly, wells of flat-bottom Immulon-2 plates (Dynatech Laboratories) were coated with 0.1 μg of PvRII and blocked with 5% milk powder solution in phosphate-buffered saline (blocking buffer). Antigen-coated wells were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C with 100 μl of rabbit serum diluted in blocking buffer. Serial dilutions (1:2-fold) of sera starting with a 1:1000-fold dilution were tested. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20, 100 μl of horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:2000-fold was added to each well and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The enzyme reaction was developed with o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride as the chromogen and hydrogen peroxide as the substrate. The reaction was terminated by the addition of sulfuric acid, and the absorbance at 490 nm (A490) was recorded in each well using an ELISA microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Preimmune sera as well as adjuvant-alone control sera were used at similar dilutions. To determine end point titers, the last dilution of test sera yielding anA490 value 1.5 times that obtained with preimmune serum was determined. COS7 cells were cultured as described previously (20Chitnis C.E. Miller L.H. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). COS7 cells growing in 35-mm-diameter wells at 40–60% confluency were transfected using Lipofectin with 2.5 μg of plasmid pHVDR22 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Plasmid pHVDR22 was designed to express PvRII on the surface of mammalian cells (20Chitnis C.E. Miller L.H. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar); it contains DNA encoding PvRII fused to the signal sequence ofHerpes simplex virus glycoprotein D (HSV gD) at the N terminus and the transmembrane region and cytoplasmic domain of HSV gD at the C terminus in a mammalian expression vector (20Chitnis C.E. Miller L.H. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 42Cohen G.H. Wilcox W.C. Sodora D.L. Long D. Levin J.Z. Eisenberg R.J. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1932-1940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The signal sequence and transmembrane segment of HSV gD target the fusion protein to the surface of COS cells. Expression of PvRII on the COS cell surface was confirmed by immunofluorescence assays, as described previously using a monoclonal antibody, DL6, directed against HSV gD sequences in the fusion protein (20Chitnis C.E. Miller L.H. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 42Cohen G.H. Wilcox W.C. Sodora D.L. Long D. Levin J.Z. Eisenberg R.J. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 1932-1940Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of erythrocytes to transfected COS cells expressing PvRII on the surface was tested using an erythrocyte binding assay, as described earlier (20Chitnis C.E. Miller L.H. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 497-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 μl of a 10% suspension of Duffy-positive human erythrocytes was added to 2 ml of media in wells containing transfected COS cells. Erythrocytes were allowed to settle for 2 h at 37 °C. Non-adherent erythrocytes were removed by washing COS cells three times with RPMI. Erythrocyte binding assays were performed in the presence of different dilutions of rabbit sera raised against refolded PvRII. Preimmune sera and rabbit sera raised against adjuvant alone were used as controls. The number of COS cells covered with rosettes of adherent erythrocytes was scored in 50 fields at a magnification of 40. Recombinant PvRII accumulates in inclusion bodies as a misfolded, insoluble aggregate when expressed in E. coli. Misfolded PvRII was solubilized in 6 m GdnHCl, purified by metal affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions, and refolded by rapid dilution. Oxidized and reduced glutathione were used during refolding to enable disulfide bond formation. Conditions such as final concentration of the recombinant protein after dilution, pH, temperature, duration of refolding, and concentrations of arginine, urea, glutathione, and oxidized glutathione were optimized to maximize yield of soluble PvRII after refolding. Refolded PvRII was purified by ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration chromatography as described. Refolded, purified PvRII was separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by silver staining (Fig. 1 A). Densitometry scanning of silver-stained gels indicates that the purity of recombinant PvRII is greater than 98%. Yields of purified, refolded PvRII are ∼2 mg/liter E. coli culture. Recombinant PvRII migrates with the expected mobility of ∼39 kDa. Refolded and purified PvRII was characterized using a variety of biophysical, biochemical, and functional assays. N-terminal sequencing of recombinant PvRII yields the sequence MDHKKTISSAINHA, which is identical to the expected sequence. No other sequence is detected. The molecular mass of recombinant PvRII measured by electron spray ionization mass spectroscopy is 39,803 Da. The predicted mass of PvRII with a 6-His fusion if all 12 cysteines are disulfide-linked is 39,802 Da. N-terminal sequencing and mass spectroscopic data confirm the identity of recombinant PvRII. The mobility of refolded PvRII by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 75 column is consistent with an apparent molecular mass of ∼39 kDa, indicating that purified PvRII does not form aggregates or multimers (data not shown). Refolded PvRII migrates slower on SDS-PAGE gels after reduction with DTT, indicating that disulfide linkages are present in the refolded protein (Fig. 1 B). The homogeneity of refolded PvRII was analyzed by reverse phase chromatography, a method that can be expected to separate different conformers of the same protein based on differences in surface hydrophobicity. Refolded PvRII elutes as a single symmetric peak by reverse phase chromatography on a C-8 column, suggesting that the final purified product is homogeneous (Fig.2). Reduction of refolded PvRII with DTT results in an increase in elution time by 1 min, confirming the presence of disulfide linkages in the refolded protein (Fig. 2). Free thiol content in refolded PvRII was assayed using the method of Ellman (40Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21616) Google Scholar) to further assess the oxidation state of the refolded protein. Free thiol could be clearly detected at a concentration of 30 μm in this assay. No free thiols were detected in recombinant PvRII at a concentration of 50 μm. Considering that PvRII contains 12 cysteines, this indicates that greater than 95% of cysteines are disulfide linked. CD spectroscopy was used to probe the secondary structure of refolded PvRII. The CD spectrum of PvRII shows characteristic α-helical signature minima at 208 and 22"

Sleytr U.B. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Frequently, the S-layer proteins are glycosylated (2Messner P. Schäffer C. Doyle R.J. Glycomicrobiology. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2000: 93-125Google Scholar). The S-layer glycoprotein of the Gram-positive bacterium Aneurinibacillus thermoaerophilus DSM 10155, a member of the Bacillus/Clostridium group, is composed of disaccharide repeating units of α-l-rhamnose and d-β-d-heptose units (3Kosma P. Wugeditsch T. Christian R. Zayni S. Messner P. Glycobiology. 1995; 5 (; Erratum (1996) Glycobiology6, 5): 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). So far, this is the only Gram-positive bacterium whered,d-heptose has been described as constituent of a cellular component. The principal architecture of S-layer glycoproteins resembles that of the LPS of Gram-negative bacteria (4Schäffer C. Wugeditsch T. Neuninger C. Messner P. Microb. Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Both glycoconjugates exhibit a tripartite structural organization, where, in general, conserved core regions connect a glycan chain, composed of identical repeating units, either with the S-layer polypeptide or the lipid A of LPS. It has been proposed that comparable pathways are used for the biosynthesis of these similar glycoconjugates (2Messner P. Schäffer C. Doyle R.J. Glycomicrobiology. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York2000: 93-125Google Scholar). Recently we were able to verify this proposal by investigation of the biosynthesis of nucleotide-activated d-rhamnose (5Kneidinger B. Graninger M. Adam G. Puchberger M. Kosma P. Zayni S. Messner P.

InYersinia enterocolitica Ye75R, bothd,d-heptose andl,d-heptose are part of the inner core (11Radziejewska-Lebrecht J. Shashkov A.S. Stroobant V. Wartenberg K. Warth C. Mayer H. Eur. J.

It must be noted, however, that only part of the existing literature ond,d-heptose andl,d-heptose is listed above, and coverage is confined to those references where complete structural studies have been performed. l-Rhamnose, the second sugar of the repeating unit of the S-layer glycan of A. thermoaerophilusDSM 10155 (3Kosma P. Wugeditsch T. Christian R. Zayni S. Messner P. Glycobiology. 1995; 5 (; Erratum (1996) Glycobiology6, 5): 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), is usually a constituent of the outer core region as well as of the O-antigen of LPS (6Raetz C.R.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar, 12Wilkinson S.G. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1983; 5 Suppl. 5: S941-S949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The inner core oligosaccharide of most LPS-containing bacteria consists of 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid and l,d-heptose units. The outer core, however, is composed predominantly of hexoses and hexosamines (13Heinrichs D.E. Valvano M.A. Whitfield C. Brade H. Morrison D.C. Vogel S. Opal S. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 305-330Google Scholar), butd,d-heptose has also been reported recently (see above). Impairment of 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid biosynthesis usually results in nonviable cells (6Raetz C.R.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). On the other hand, mutants having a defect in the biosynthesis ofl,d-heptose are viable, albeit with certain characteristics, referred to as the “deep rough” phenotype inEscherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. Transduction by the P1 bacteriophage and F-plasmid conjugation are impaired (14Curtiss R. Charamella J. Stallions D.R. Mays J.A. Bacteriol.

Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2379-2385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Crystallization of the biosynthesis enzymes could lead to the development of enzyme inhibitors via molecular modeling. These inhibitors can support novel antibiotic therapies to circumvent drug resistance. The biosynthesis of the nucleotide-activated precursor of 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid, namely CMP-3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid, has been described previously (13Heinrichs D.E. Valvano M.A. Whitfield C. Brade H. Morrison D.C. Vogel S. Opal S. Endotoxin in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1999: 305-330Google Scholar). In contrast, the complete biosynthesis of the nucleotide-activated form ofd/l,d-heptose has not yet been elucidated. Eidels and Osborn (19Eidels L. Osborn M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 69: 1673-1677Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar) have proposed a four-step pathway for the synthesis of NDP-l,d-heptose. (i)d-Sedoheptulose 7-phosphate is converted tod,d-heptose 7-phosphate by phosphoheptose isomerase; (ii) a mutase catalyzes the second step to formd,d-heptose 1-phosphate; (iii) this intermediate product is activated to NDP-d,d-heptose by the action of NDP-heptose synthetase; (iv) in the last step, an epimerase catalyzes the formation of the final product NDP-l,d-heptose. The nucleotide-activated sugar GDP-d,d-heptose has been described in bakers' yeast (20Ginsburg V. O'Brien P.J. Hall C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 497-499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and both ADP-d,d-heptose and ADP-l,d-heptose have been isolated fromShigella sonnei and Salmonella minnesota mutants (21Kontrohr T.

Recently, it has been shown that heptosyltransferases I and II from E. coli accept ADP-l-β-d-heptose as substrate, and thed-β-d isomer is also accepted, albeit with 10-fold reduced efficiency (23Zamyatina A. Gronow S. Oertelt C. Puchberger M. Brade H. Kosma P. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2000; 39: 4150-4153Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The first step in heptose biosynthesis was described in S. typhimurium (24Eidels L. Osborn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5642-5648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the phosphoheptose isomerase genegmhA from E. coli was cloned and sequenced (25Brooke J.S. Valvano M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3608-3614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). So far, no gene product that catalyzes the proposed mutase step has been described. The RfaE protein, also referred to as ADP-heptose synthetase, is proposed to be involved in the nucleotide-activating step. This enzyme has been shown to consist of two separate domains inE. coli (26Valvano M.A. Marolda C.L. Bittner M. Glaskin-Clay M. Simon T.L. Klena J.D. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 488-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Domain I displays homology to members of the ribokinase family, whereas domain II is homologous to various cytidyltransferases. Thus, RfaE is supposed to be a bifunctional enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of d,d-heptose 1-phosphate as well as in the nucleotide-activating reaction step. TherfaD gene product has been proposed to carry out the last step in the biosynthesis of the l,d-form, namely the epimerization to yield NDP-l,d-heptose (27Coleman Jr., W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1985-1990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, RfaD has been crystallized and characterized (28Deacon A.M. Ni Y.S. Coleman Jr., W.G. Ealick S.E. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 453-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (69) Google Scholar). So far, functional studies have only been performed for the isomerization reaction (24Eidels L. Osborn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5642-5648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Brooke J.S. Valvano M.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 24384-24390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Enzymes that might carry out the mutase reaction, or an alternative phosphatase, have not been described. In this report we show for the first time the overall biosynthesis of a nucleotide-activated form of d,d-heptose, namely GDP-d-α-d-heptose in Gram-positive bacteria, and propose a general reaction pathway for the biosynthesis of activated l,d-heptose in Gram-negative bacteria. In addition, we present a modified nomenclature scheme for genes involved in heptose biosynthesis. ATP, GTP, d-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate, and dithiothreitol were obtained from Sigma (Sigma Aldrich Fluka GmbH, Wien, Austria).d-glycero-α-d-manno-heptose 1-phosphate andd-glycero-β-d-manno-heptose 1-phosphate were kindly provided by A. Zamyatina (Universität für Bodenkultur Wien, Wien, Austria). Glutathione (reduced form) was obtained from Merck GmbH (Wien, Austria). GSTrap, HiTrap Chelating, HiPrep Desalting, MonoQ HR5/5, and Sephadex G-10 were purchased fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). The GATEWAY system was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Wien, Austria), and the pBAD system was from Invitrogen (Groningen, The Netherlands). Ultrafree-MC 10000 ultrafiltration cartridges were purchased from Millipore (Bedford, MA), and pBCKS was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA).

E. coli DH5α andE. coli TG1 were used for plasmid propagation. For enzyme overexpression E. coli BL21-SI, E. coliBL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL, and E. coli LMG194 were used. Protein overexpression was induced by the addition of NaCl, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, orl-arabinose, respectively. Media were supplemented with ampicillin, kanamycin, or chloramphenicol at concentrations of 100, 50, and 34 μg/ml, respectively, when required.

Open table in a new tab Nucleotide-activated sugars were analyzed on a CarboPac PA-1 column (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) using the method of Palmieri et al. (30Palmieri M.J. Berry G.T. Player D.A. Rogers S. Segal S. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 184: 388-393Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Monosaccharides were analyzed on a CarboPac PA-1 column as described previously (4Schäffer C. Wugeditsch T. Neuninger C. Messner P. Microb. Drug Resist. 1996; 2: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Monosaccharide phosphates were analyzed on the CarboPac PA-1 column using a NaOAc-gradient (100–500 mm) in 100 mm NaOH. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to the original method of Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205522) Google Scholar) using slight modifications. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211941) Google Scholar). BLAST (33Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4228) Google Scholar) were used to analyze nucleotide and protein sequences. All standard DNA recombinant procedures were performed according to the methods described by Sambrook et al. (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or as recommended by the corresponding manufacturer. PCR was carried out using a PCR Sprint thermocycler (Hybaid, Ashford, United Kingdom). DNA sequencing was performed by MWG BIOTECH (Ebersberg, Germany) and AGOWA (Berlin, Germany). In order to clone the genes involved in S-layer glycoprotein glycan biosynthesis, particularly the dTDP-l-rhamnose genes, an alignment of 14 RmlA and putative RmlA protein sequences, available in the NCBI data base, was carried out using Multalign (34Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4228) Google Scholar). The highly conserved six-amino acid stretch LGDNI(F/Y) was used to design the degenerate probe 5′-YTI GGI GAY AAY ATH TT-3′ (where I is inosine, H is A/C/T, and Y is C/T). This oligonucleotide was 3′ end-labeled with digoxigenin, and Southern hybridization experiments of completely digested chromosomal DNA of A. thermoaerophilus DSM 10155 yielded specific signals at 35 °C. A 4.5-kilobase pairBglII-fragment was isolated by preparative agarose gel electrophoresis and cloned into the plasmid pBCKS, linearized with the endonuclease BamHI. The corresponding construct pRML was sequenced. Oligonucleotide primer sequences are given in Table I. Primers for the amplification of DNA fragments containing thegmhA (primers GMHAA1 and GMHAA2), the kinase (primers GMHBA1 and GMHBA2), or the pyrophosphorylase (primers GMHDA1 and GMHDA2) gene were designed with attB1 or attB2 sites for the insertion into the GATEWAY donor vector pDONR201 by homologous recombination. The PCR products were cloned into pDONR201, and the resulting plasmids gGMHA1, gGMHB1, and gGMHD1 were used to transfer the gene sequences into pDEST15 (GST fusion) or pDEST17 (histidine fusion) via homologous recombination. The corresponding plasmids gGMHA3 (histidine fusion), gGMHB3 (histidine fusion), and gGMHD2 (GST fusion) were used for overexpression of the fusion proteins in E. coli BL21-SI. Primers GMHC1F and GMHC2R were used for the amplification of the phosphatase gene. The PCR product was digested with BglII and EcoRI and ligated into linearized and dephosphorylated vector pBADB. The resulting plasmid pGMHC1 was used for histidine-tagged fusion protein overexpression in E. coliLMG194. E. coli BL21-SI cells harboring the histidine-fusion plasmid gGMHA3 were grown at 37 °C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.5 in a 1-liter culture volume and expression was induced for 150 min. E. coli BL21-SI carrying gGMHB3 was grown at 30 °C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.5 in a 2-liter culture volume, and expression was induced overnight.E. coli LMG194 harboring pgmhC1 was grown at 37 °C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.5 in a 1-liter culture volume, and expression was induced for 3 h. Finally, E. coliBL21-SI cells carrying the GST-fusion plasmid gGMHD2 were grown at 30 °C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6 in a 2-liter culture volume, and expression was done overnight. Production of fusion protein was induced by the addition of NaCl to a final concentration of 0.3m for E. coli BL21-SI, or withl-arabinose to a final concentration of 0.2% for E. coli LMG194. The cells were disrupted by ultrasonication on ice, cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 31,000 ×g, and membrane fractions were collected as a pellet by ultracentrifugation at 331,000 × g. All protein purifications were done on an FPLC system of Amersham Pharmacia Biotechusing appropriate amounts of supernatant from the ultracentrifugation step. Purifications using HiTrap Chelating and GSTrap columns were performed as recommended by the manufacturer. For buffer exchange, a HiPrep Desalting column was used. Anion exchange chromatography was carried out in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.7, using 1m KCl as eluent. Dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 1 mm during all purification steps, except when using HiTrap Chelating columns. Purification of GmhA, the putative kinase, and the putative phosphatase was performed using affinity chromatography on a HiPrep Chelating column. GmhB and GmhC were further purified by anion exchange chromatography; the kinase eluted at 300 mm KCl, and the phosphatase eluted at 230 mmKCl. The GST-tagged fusion protein of the putative pyrophosphorylase was purified using a GSTrap column. The enzymes were stored at 4 °C or after stabilization with 50% glycerol at −20 °C. The purity of the enzymes was checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (4% stacking gel and 12% separating gel). Ten nmol of d-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate or d-α-d-heptose 1-phosphate were used for enzyme assays. Fifty nmol of α-d-glucose 1,6-bisphosphate was used in a negative control assay to test the specificity of d,d-heptose 1,7-bisphosphate phosphatase. The assay buffer TH8 contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 10 mm MgCl2. Appropriate amounts of enzymes were added, and, after 45 min of incubation at 37 °C, the samples were analyzed by HPAEC. One μmol of d-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate was incubated with appropriate amounts of GmhA in TH8 buffer at 37 °C until equilibrium was reached. The enzyme was removed by ultrafiltration using Ultrafree-MC 10000 ultrafiltration cartridges.d,d-Heptose 7-phosphate was separated fromd-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate by preparative HPAEC on a CarboPac PA-1. The sample was desalted using a Carbohydrate Membrane Desalter (CMD; Dionex), lyophilized, and investigated by NMR spectroscopy. d,d-Heptose 7-phosphate, purified in the first reaction step (∼150 nmol), was incubated with 250 nmol ATP and the kinase in 20 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.5; 10 mm MgCl2) at 37 °C. After removal of the enzyme, the pH was adjusted to 3.0 by addition of Dowex-50 ion exchange resin, the sample was lyophilized, andd-α-d-heptose 1,7-bisphosphate was analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. Three hundred nmol of d-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate were converted to d-α-d-heptose 1-phosphate, using appropriate amounts of GmhA, the kinase, the phosphatase, and 600 nmol of ATP in TH8 buffer at 37 °C. The enzyme mix was removed by ultrafiltration, andd-α-d-heptose 1-phosphate was purified by preparative HPAEC. The desalted (CMD) and lyophilized sample was analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. Finally, 2 μmol ofd-α-d-heptose 1-phosphate were incubated with the pyrophosphorylase and 3 μmol of GTP in TH8 buffer at 37 °C. Inorganic pyrophosphatase was used to push the equilibrium reaction toward GDP-d-α-d-heptose. The enzyme was removed, and GDP-d-α-d-heptose was purified on a semipreparative CarboPac PA-1 column. The sample was desalted using Sephadex G-10 and lyophilized. NMR analysis was performed to elucidate the structure of the final reaction product. Samples were dissolved in 99.95% D2O (0.5 ml). Spectra were recorded at 300 K at 300.13 MHz for 1H and at 75.47 MHz for 13C with a Bruker AVANCE 300 spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm quadruple nuclear inverse probehead with z-gradients. Data acquisition and processing were performed with the standard XWINNMR software (Bruker).1H spectra were referenced to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid (δ = 0),13C spectra were referenced externally to 1,4-dioxane (δ = 67.40), and 31P spectra were referenced externally to H3PO4 (δ = 0). HMQC-,1H,31P HMQC-, and1H,31P heteronuclear single quantum coherence-COSY spectra were recorded in the phase-sensitive mode using time proportional phase incrementation and pulsed field gradients for coherence selection (36Bax A. Griffey R.H. Hawkins B.L. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 55: 301-315Google Scholar, 37Summers M.F. Marzilli G.L. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 4285-4294Crossref Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Spectra resulted from a 256 × 4096 data matrix, with 1800 or 800 scans/t1 value, respectively. The genes coding for enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of a nucleotide-activated sugar precursor generally are clustered within the corresponding gene cluster for a particular bacterial polysaccharide (38Reeves P.R. New Compr. Biochem. 1994; 27: 271-314Google Scholar). For the genes in the dTDP-l-rhamnose biosynthetic pathway, this proposal was verified in Gram-negative as well as in Gram-positive organisms (39Marumo K. Lindquist L. Verma N. Weintraub A. Reeves P.R. Lindberg A.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 204: 539-545Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar,40Giraud M.-F. Naismith J.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar).2 To clone the genes involved in S-layer glycoprotein glycan biosynthesis of A. thermoaerophilus DSM 10155, a strategy was applied using a degenerate probe derived from RmlA protein sequences (Fig. 1). Characterization of the rml genes will be published elsewhere.2 The insert of the cloned construct pRML was sequenced and contained the rmlA gene, incomplete at the 3′ end, and four additional ORFs upstream of rmlA. One of these open reading frames codes for a homologue of GmhA, the first enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of nucleotide-activated heptose. The fourth ORF was incomplete, and its 5′ end was sequenced using a recently described method (41Kneidinger B. Graninger M. Messner P. BioTechniques. 2001; 30: 248-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), revealing two additional ORFs. Again, the 5′ end of the most upstream gene was missing. The physical map of the sequenced 6,652-base pair DNA fragment is depicted in Fig. 1. According to sequence comparisons with other RmlA proteins, the enzyme lacks only few amino acids on its carboxyl terminus. Upstream of thermlA gene is a region of 939 base pairs without any predicted ORF coding for proteins larger than 80 amino acids. The first significant ORF upstream of rmlA codes for a protein of 179 amino acids. A Blast search yielded"

Given the established capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone GRP94 (gp96) to elicit CD8+ T cell activation, we have investigated the cellular fate and antigenicity of GRP94 in differing scenarios of cell death. Virally induced cell death or mechanical cell death, elicited by freeze/thaw treatment of cell suspensions, yielded GRP94 release into the extracellular space; apoptotic cell death occurring in response to serum deprivation did not elicit GRP94 release. To assess the antigenicity of GRP94 released following virally induced cell death (lethal infection of cells with rVV ES-OVAMet258–265, a recombinant, ovalbumin epitope-expressing vaccinia virus) or mechanical cell death (freeze/thaw of ovalbumin-expressing cells), tissue culture supernatant fractions were pulsed onto antigen-presenting cells, and antigen re-presentation was assayed as activation of an ovalbumin-specific T cell hybridoma. For both cell death scenarios, released GRP94 elicited a dose-dependent, ovalbumin-specific, hybridoma activation. In contrast, calreticulin derived from rVV ES-OVAMet258–265-infected cell extracts did not stimulate B3Z activity.

As a chaperone, GRP94 interacts with nascent (poly)peptides undergoing structural maturation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),1 the site of peptide loading onto nascent major histocompatibility (MHC) class I molecules (6Nicchitta C.V. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 7Heemels M.-T. Ploegh H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 463-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). This (poly)peptide binding activity, viewed with respect to the subcellular localization of GRP94, provides insight into the derivation of GRP94 immunogenicity; it resides in the recipient compartment for peptides transported by the transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP) (7Heemels M.-T. Ploegh H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 463-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Furthermore, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) can internalize GRP94-peptide complexes from the extracellular space by both receptor-mediated and bulk flow mechanisms (8Singh-Jasuja H. Toes R.E.

Recent evidence indicates that GRP94-peptide complexes internalized via the receptor-mediated pathway gain access to the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway, yielding re-presentation of GRP94-associated peptides on APC MHC class I molecules, an example of a process referred to as cross-priming or cross-presentation (8Singh-Jasuja H.

Although it is clear that GRP94-peptide complexes can elicit cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses, a finding of substantial therapeutic implications, it is not known whether GRP94 can function in a physiological context to regulate cellular immune responses. The physiological setting of greatest relevance to chaperone-elicited immune responses is that of cell death (broadly speaking, necrosis and apoptosis). Although a precise terminology for unambiguously distinguishing necrosis and apoptosis continues to evolve, the principal physiological difference between the two forms of cell death is that apoptosis is an essential physiological mechanism in growth, differentiation, and tissue remodeling, whereas necrosis is a pathological end point (12Trump B.F. Berezesky I.K. Chang S.H. Phelps P.C. Toxicol. Pathol. 1997; 25: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 13Melcher A. Gough M. Todryk S. Vile R. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 824-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Importantly, necrotic cell death results in inflammation and stimulation of the host immune system (14Duvall E. Wyllie A.H. Immunol. Today. 1986; 7: 115-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 15Matzinger P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 991-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (4013) Google Scholar, 16Gallucci S. Lolkema M. Matzinger P. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1249-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar). The contribution of the inflammatory response to the regulation of cellular immune responses is a central element of the “danger hypothesis,” which predicts that the immune system of the host responds to antigens in the context of a physiological danger signal (15Matzinger P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 991-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (4013) Google Scholar). In this view, the initiation of a cellular immune response requires both the antigen and inflammation-induced co-stimulatory factors that stimulate APC cell maturation and antigen presentation. Indeed, recent work indicates that necrotic cells and their supernatants can induce maturation of dendritic cells, as well as provide antigens for re-presentation to CD8+ T cells (16Gallucci S. Lolkema M. Matzinger P. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1249-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar, 17Todryk S. Melcher A.A. Hardwick N. Linardakis E. Bateman A. Colombo M.P. Stoppacciaro A. Vile R.G.

Immunol. 2000; 12: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). At present, the full identity of the necrotic cell components that elicit APC activation and serve as the source of antigenic component(s) necessary for the elicitation and maintenance of a cellular immune response remains to be determined (19Basu S. Binder R.J. Suto R. Anderson K.M. Srivastava P.K. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar, 20Asea A. Kreaft S.-K. Kurt-Jones E. Stevenson M.A. Chen L.B. Finberg R.W. Koo G.C. Calderwood S.K. Nat. Med. 2000; 4: 435-442Crossref Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that lethal viral infection and mechanical cell death elicited the release of GRP94 into the extracellular medium, whereas apoptotic cell death did not. GRP94 released as a consequence of viral infection was structurally intact, it could be internalized by APCs, and its bound peptides re-presented for T cell activation. These data extend recent findings that necrotic cell extracts stimulate APC maturation and re-presentation and establish GRP94 as a candidate physiological mediator of necrosis-dependent immune responses (16Gallucci S. Lolkema M. Matzinger P. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1249-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar, 18Sauter B. Albert M.L. Francisco L. Larsson M. Somersan S. Bhardwaj N. J. Exp.

EL4 and E.G7-OVA are murine thymomas, E.G7-OVA being EL4 cells stably transfected with the gene encoding chicken ovalbumin (21Moore M.W. Carbone F.R. Bevan M.J. Cell. 1988; 54: 777-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). B3Z is a CD8+ T cell hybridoma that expresses LacZ in response to activation of T cell receptors specific for the SIINFEKL peptide (OVA-immunodominant peptide) in the context of H-2Kb MHC class I molecules (22Karttunen J. Sanderson S. Shastri N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6020-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). P815 is a murine mastocytoma cell line, H-2d haplotype, expressing the P1A tumor antigen. RAW309 Cr.1, a Kd/Kbmurine macrophage cell line, was obtained from ATCC (ATCC TIB-69). All cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10‥ fetal calf serum. To analyze GRP94 release following mechanical (nonphysiological) cell death, cultures of E.G7-OVA cells were killed by freeze/thaw treatment (16Gallucci S. Lolkema M. Matzinger P. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1249-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar, 18Sauter B. Albert M.L. Francisco L. Larsson M. Somersan S. Bhardwaj N. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar), the addition of digitonin to 0.005‥, or the addition of 5 μm ionomycin. For the latter two conditions the cells were incubated as such for 6 h at 37 °C. In experiments addressing mechanical cell death, 1 × 106 cells were used in the preparation of cell extracts. Following the indicated treatment, cell suspensions were centrifuged (15 min, 50,000 rpm, Beckman TL100.2 rotor), and the resulting supernatant was retained as the soluble fraction. Tissue culture supernatant extracts were subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation (40‥ w/v), and the glycoprotein fraction remaining in the 40‥ ammonium sulfate supernatant was purified by adsorption onto concanavalin A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bound glycoproteins were eluted from the concanavalin A beads with SDS-PAGE sample buffer (0.5 m Tris, 5‥ SDS) and analyzed by immunoblot for GRP94 content. The anti-GRP94 antibody (DU120) was prepared by contract service with Cocalico Biologicals (Reamstown, PA). For the induction of pathological cell death, P815 cells were infected with rVV ES-OVAMet258–265, a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding the modified ovalbumin epitope MIINFEKL in a signal sequence-bearing minigene construct (23Restifo N.P. Bacik I. Irvine K.R. Yewdell J.W. McCabe B.J. Anderson R.W. Eisenlohr L.C. Rosenberg S.A. Bennink J.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4414-4422PubMed Google Scholar), at a multiplicity of infection of 5 for 1 h in balanced salt solution, 0.1‥ bovine serum albumin (BSS/BSA). BSS/BSA medium was then exchanged into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10‥ fetal calf serum, and the cultures were maintained for 48 h at 37 °C. 48 h postinfection, cell cultures were centrifuged as above, and the supernatant fraction was recovered. The ER chaperone content of the cell pellet was released by sequential extraction of the cell pellet with 0.05‥ digitonin and 10 mm CHAPS detergents. The supernatant fraction was subjected to ultracentrifugation (Beckman TLA100 rotor, 60,000 rpm, 20 min) prior to fractionation. For the supernatant fractions, fractionation was performed by gel filtration chromatography on a Sephacryl S-300 column, with elution performed in phosphate-buffered saline. Cell pellet detergent extracts were initially fractionated by MonoQ anion exchange chromatography and subsequently by gel filtration chromatography, as previously described (24Wearsch P.A. Nicchitta C.V. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Apoptotic cell death was elicited by transferring EL4 cell cultures into serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Following transfer, aliquots of the cell suspension were removed at the indicated time points for analysis of GRP94 release in the medium (as above), cell death, as assayed by vital dye (trypan blue) staining, and apoptotic state, as assayed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-annexin V staining (Pharmingen) (according to the manufacturer's protocol). For fluorescein isothiocyanate-annexin V staining, cells were postfixed in 2‥ paraformaldehyde and assayed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. OVA-specific immunogenicity was determined in a re-presentation assay using the Kb/Kd macrophage cell line RAW309 and the OVA-specific T cell hybridoma B3Z. Typically, fractions derived from the different tissue culture supernatants were added to cultures of 5 × 105 RAW309 cells and 106 B3Z cells, in a total of 1 ml, as described previously (22Karttunen J. Sanderson S. Shastri N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6020-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). OVA re-presentation was assayed by the measurement of LacZ activity usingo-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) substrate as described previously (25Shastri N. Gonzalez F. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 2724-2736PubMed Google Scholar). The linear range of OVA re-presentation sensitivity was determined by the addition of serial dilutions of SIINFEKL to the medium. In experiments involving fractions prepared from E.G7-OVA cells, contaminating full-length ovalbumin or ovalbumin peptide fragments were separated from the GRP94 fraction by ultrafiltration on Microcon100 centrifugal ultrafiltration units (Millipore). Processing in the Microcon100 units yielded efficient fractionation of the supernatant fractions into low molecular mass (<100 kDa; filtrate) and high molecular mass (>100 kDa; retentate) fractions. The GRP94-enriched retentate was collected and either used directly or depleted of GRP94 by chromatography on an anti-GRP94 immunoaffinity support. The immunoaffinity matrix was prepared using affinity-purified DU120 IgG cross-linked to protein G beads (Sigma). To deplete fractions of GRP94, aliquots were incubated at a ratio of 3:1 (extract volume:bead volume) for 90 min at 4 °C with end-over-end mixing. Subsequently, samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant fraction was recovered. Necrotic cell extracts can stimulate APC activation, maturation, and (coordinately) antigen re-presentation (16Gallucci S. Lolkema M. Matzinger P. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1249-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar, 17Todryk S. Melcher A.A. Hardwick N. Linardakis E. Bateman A. Colombo M.P. Stoppacciaro A. Vile R.G. J.

Although the identity of all necrotic cell-derived components that contribute to the APC activation response remains to be determined, heat shock and chaperone proteins have been demonstrated to elicit APC activation and to serve as cross-presentation antigens in the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway and thus can be considered candidate molecular signals of necrotic cell death (5Srivastava P.K. Menoret A. Basu S. Binder R.J. McQuade K.L. Immunity. 1998; 8: 657-665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 15Matzinger P. Annu. Rev.

Med. 2000; 4: 435-442Crossref Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). Here we examined whether GRP94 (gp96), the endoplasmic reticulum Hsp90, was released from cells in response to cell death elicited by mechanical, apoptotic, or pathological cell death and whether the released GRP94 was immunogenic. Two experimental systems were used. To examine the fate of GRP94 in mechanical/chemical and apoptotic cell death, E.G7-OVA and EL4 cells were used. Previously, we reported that E.G7-OVA-derived GRP94 is immunogenic and can elicit OVA (SIINFEKL)-specific CD8+ T cell responses in vivo (3Nair S. Wearsch P.A. Mitchell D.A. Wassenberg J.J. Gilboa E. Nicchitta C.V. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6426-6432PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the fate of GRP94 upon pathological cell death, P815 mastocytoma cells were infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing an OVA-peptide minigene (23Restifo N.P. Bacik I. Irvine K.R. Yewdell J.W. McCabe B.J. Anderson R.W. Eisenlohr L.C. Rosenberg S.A. Bennink J.R. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4414-4422PubMed Google Scholar). In this system, viral infection yields the trafficking of OVA peptide to the ER, where it is available for loading onto nascent class I molecules and, presumably, the endogenous GRP94. A number of experimental methods for eliciting mechanical/chemical cell death were used, all of which yielded the hallmark phenotype of either a rapid disruption in plasma membrane integrity or a profound increase in plasma membrane ion permeability. Thus, cells were subjected to multiple freeze/thaw cycles (16Gallucci S. Lolkema M. Matzinger P. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1249-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar, 18Sauter B. Albert M.L. Francisco L. Larsson M. Somersan S. Bhardwaj N. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar, 19Basu S. Binder R.J. Suto R. Anderson K.M. Srivastava P.K. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar), treated with concentrations of digitonin sufficient to induce selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane, or subjected to pronounced increases in intracellular calcium levels by addition of ionomycin (27McConkey D.J. Toxicol. Lett. 1998; 99: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). After the indicated time period, cell suspensions were centrifuged, and the soluble fraction was assayed for the presence of GRP94. As demonstrated in Fig.1, no GRP94 was seen in tissue culture supernatants derived from healthy cell cultures (Fig. 1, lane 2), whereas freeze/thaw, ionomycin, and digitonin treatment yielded the release of GPR94 into the tissue culture supernatant (Fig.1, lanes 3–5). As depicted in Fig. 1, lanes 6and 7, lethal viral infection elicited the release of GRP94 into the medium. These findings confirm recent data identifying the release of GPR94 (gp96) into the soluble fraction following freeze/thaw-elicited cell death and identify a physiological scenario for GRP94 release occurring in response to cell death (19Basu S. Binder R.J. Suto R. Anderson K.M. Srivastava P.K. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Under all conditions examined, the ER membrane proteins remained in association with the cell pellet (data not shown). Following identification of GRP94 in the supernatant fraction of killed cell cultures, a series of experiments were performed to assess the immunogenicity of these GRP94 fractions. For experiments with GRP94 derived from cells killed through freeze/thaw treatment, E.G7-OVA cells were used. E.G7-OVA expresses ovalbumin (43 kDa), itself an immunogenic protein in the described re-presentation assay, and so the necrotic cell extracts were first fractionated by centrifugal ultrafiltration to separate ovalbumin and/or ovalbumin fragments from GRP94 (185 kDa, native molecular mass). As shown in Fig. 2 A, two cycles of ultrafiltration were observed to effectively fractionate GRP94 from ovalbumin. The specificity of the ultrafiltration-based fractionation is further depicted in Fig. 2 B, where it is shown that following two cycles of ultrafiltration of the freeze/thaw-treated soluble fraction, GRP94 is recovered wholly in the retentate fraction. It should be noted that GRP94 recovered from freeze/thaw-derived cell lysates and the tissue culture supernatants of vaccinia-infected cultures was structurally intact. In contrast, apoptotic cell death has been reported to induce GRP94 proteolysis (28Reddy R.K. Lu J. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28476-28483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To determine whether the GRP94 derived from the freeze/thaw-derived cell lysates was immunologically active, the GRP94-enriched ultrafiltration retentate fraction, the identical fraction depleted of GRP94 by adsorption onto affinity-purified monospecific anti-GRP94 IgG, and medium ± 100 nm ovalbumin were incubated with RAW309 Cr.1 macrophages, and OVA re-presentation was assayed as activation of the OVA/Kb-specific T cell hybridoma, B3Z (22Karttunen J. Sanderson S. Shastri N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6020-6024Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The linearity of the assay response, using OVA peptide as standard, is depicted in Fig. 2 C. Under the described conditions, the assay was linear up to 1 absorbance unit. As depicted in Fig. 2 D, the GRP94-enriched, ovalbumin-depleted retentate fraction stimulated the re-presentation assay ∼50-fold over the GRP94-depleted supernatant. This level of activation approximated that observed upon addition of 100 nm ovalbumin. Immunoaffinity depletion of GRP94 from the retentate fraction reduced re-presentation to nearly background levels, defined as RAW309 and B3Z cells cultured in the presence of normal culture medium. These data indicate that GRP94 contains nearly the entirety of the high molecular weight OVA-specific immunogenic activity present in a freeze/thaw-derived cell extract. In contrast to pathological cell death, apoptotic cell death is a tightly regulated process (27McConkey D.J. Toxicol. Lett. 1998; 99: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 29Leist M. Single B. Castoldi A.F. Kuhnle S. Nicotera P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar). Furthermore, endogenous signals derived from necrotic cells stimulate APC activation and maturation, whereas those from apoptotic cells do not (16Gallucci S. Lolkema M. Matzinger P. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1249-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar, 18Sauter B. Albert M.L. Francisco L. Larsson M. Somersan S. Bhardwaj N. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 423-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar, 19Basu S. Binder R.J. Suto R. Anderson K.M. Srivastava P.K. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). To assess the effects of apoptotic cell death on GRP94 release, EL4 cells were serum-deprived, and over a 21-h time course, aliquots of cell-free tissue culture supernatant were assayed for GRP94 content (Fig.3 A). In paired analyses, aliquots of the cell fraction were assayed for cell death (trypan blue, vital dye staining) (Fig. 3 B) and apoptosis (annexin V binding) (Fig. 3 C). These data indicate that GRP94 release into the medium occurred coincident with secondary necrotic cell death but not with the onset of apoptosis. To assess the immunogenic activity of GRP94 in cells undergoing pathological cell death, the cell-associated GRP94 fraction obtained following lethal infection of P815 mastocytoma cells with a recombinant, OVA-expressing vaccinia virus was examined. To obtain this fraction, the cell pellet from an rVVES-OVAMet258–265 terminal infection was extracted with 10 mm CHAPS detergent, and the resulting soluble protein pool was fractionated by MonoQ anion exchange chromatography. Fractions from the MonoQ anion exchange step were assayed for OVA-specific B3Z activation, and the peak activity fractions were pooled. The pooled activity peak was then further fractionated by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 4). Two peaks of B3Z activation were observed, one present in the void fraction (M r >800,000) and the other coinciding with the elution of two major proteins of apparent molecular weights of 550,000 (Fig. 4 A). The void fraction from the gel filtration step contained both an aggregated protein fraction and a nucleic acid component, both of which elicited B3Z activation, and was not further studied. As previously reported, native GRP94, because of its relatively high frictional ratio, chromatographs on gel filtration media with an apparent molecular weight of ∼550,000 (24Wearsch P.A. Nicchitta C.V. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 7: 114-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of the gel filtration column fractions confirmed that the three protein bands observed by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig.4 B) were GRP94, Hsp90, and calreticulin (Fig.4 C). In the depicted gel filtration profile, there was a slight overlap in elution volumes between the GRP94/Hsp90 fraction and calreticulin. Analysis of the calreticulin fraction in the B3Z activation assay indicated that it was without activity (Fig.4 A). The data regarding calreticulin contrast with previous data from our laboratory demonstrating that calreticulin derived from full-length ovalbumin-producing cells (E.G7-OVA) displays OVA-specific immunogenicity (3Nair S. Wearsch P.A. Mitchell D.A. Wassenberg J.J. Gilboa E. Nicchitta C.V. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6426-6432PubMed Google Scholar). Such differences may indicate that in vivo calreticulin associates with a precursor OVA-bearing peptide that is subsequently processed by antigen-presenting cells to yield the minimal OVA epitope. Having determined that the GRP94 and Hsp90 are primary immunogenic components in a viral cell death model, related experiments were performed to determine whether the GRP94 released into the extracellular space as a consequence of lethal vaccinia infection was immunogenic. These series of studies were designed to address the most physiologically relevant component of these studies, that being the role of GRP94 as a cross-presentation antigen in scenarios of pathological cell death (15Matzinger P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 991-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (4013) Google Scholar, 16Gallucci S. Lolkema M. Matzinger P. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1249-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1391) Google Scholar, 19Basu S. Binder R.J. Suto R. Anderson K.M. Srivastava P.K. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Thus, although the data in Fig. 4indicate that GRP94 purified from virus-infected cells is immunogenic, it was necessary to determine whether GRP94 can perform a pathological cell death messenger function in transferring immunogenic peptides from dying cells to the major histocompatibility complex class I antigen presentation pathway of antigen-presenting cells. To address this question, P815 mastocytoma cell cultures were subjected to lethal viral infection with rVV ES-OVAMet258–265 and centrifuged, and the supernatant (extracellular) fraction was recovered. This fraction was then concentrated and fractionated by gel filtration chromatography on Sephacryl S-300 resin (Fig. 5). Consistent with results obtained in analyses of the cell-derived chaperone fraction, the peak of B3Z activation coincided with the peak GRP94-containing fractions (Fig. 5 A), as determined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 5 B). The fractions obtained by gel filtration chromatography of the concentrated tissue culture supernatant contained a complex, diverse array of proteins, reflecting both serum components and those cellular proteins released in response to pathological cell death (data not shown). To address the relative contribution of GRP94 to the total OVA-specific immunogenic activity of the peak activity fractions, a GRP94 immunodepletion experiment was performed. As depicted in Fig.5 C, immunoaffinity depletion of GRP94 from a peak activity fraction yielded a 60‥ decrease in OVA-specific activity. Under the described immunoaffinity depletion conditions, GRP94 was efficiently removed from the indicated fraction (Fig. 5 C,inset). On the basis of the data presented in Fig. 4, it is likely that the remaining OVA-specific activity is derived from cytosolic Hsp90. In summary, these data identify GRP94 as a prominent, soluble immunogenic component released from cells in response to pathological cell death. As a consequence of pathological cell death, which accompanies lethal infection with vaccinia virus, GRP94 is released into the extracellular space and can function as a cross-presentation antigen in the MHC class I pathway. These observations extend recent findings demonstrating the release of GRP94 (gp96) in cells subjected to mechanical cell death (freeze/thaw) (19Basu S. Binder R.J. Suto R. Anderson K.M. Srivastava P.K. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar) and identify a physiologically relevant role for GRP94 in the regulation of immune responses to pathological cell death. The mechanism of vaccinia-elicited cell death is, as yet, undefined. In a manner similar to a number of viruses, including Epstein-Barr, adenovirus, and human papilloma virus, infection with vaccinia results in the expression of virally encoded anti-apoptotic signals that block the progression to apoptotic cell death, indicating that lethal vaccinia infection elicits cell death by a nonapoptotic mechanism (30Gillet G. Brun G. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 312-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, however, vaccinia infection of immature dendritic cells and immature B-lymphocytes has been reported to elicit apoptotic cell death (31Engelmayer J. Larsson M. Subklewe M. Chahroudi A. Cox W.I. Steinman R.M. Bhardwaj N. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6762-6768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Baixeras E. Cebrian A. Albar J.P. Salas J. Martinez A.C. Vinuela E. Revilla Y. Virus Res. 1998; 58: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Etoposide-induced apoptotic cell death results in the calpain-mediated proteolysis of GRP94 (28Reddy R.K. Lu J. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28476-28483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). That GRP94 was recovered in the tissue culture supernatant fraction in a structurally intact form following vaccinia infection (Fig. 1) supports the conclusion that terminal infection with vaccinia elicits nonapoptotic cell death. Most significantly, and regardless of the precise molecular mechanism by which terminal vaccinia infection elicits cell mortality, the end stage of a lethal vaccinia infection is accompanied by a loss of both plasma and ER membrane integrity and the release of cellular components, including ER chaperones, into the extracellular space. Matzinger (15Matzinger P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 991-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (4013) Google Scholar), in the danger hypothesis, has proposed that necrotic, but not apoptotic, cell death yields the production of inflammatory signals necessary for the activation of cellular immune responses. In support of this hypothesis, recent studies have demonstrated that lysed cell extracts contain components capable of eliciting dendritic cell activation and maturation (16Gallucci S. Lolkema M.

There exists substantial experimental evidence indicating that heat shock and chaperone proteins can themselves perform such functions. For example, Hsp70 has been demonstrated to elicit cytokine release as well as to direct peptide antigens into the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway (17Todryk S. Melcher A.A. Hardwick N.

Similarly, GRP94 can function as an MHC class I cross-presentation antigen, and recent data convincingly demonstrate that GRP94 induces cytokine expression in both macrophages and dendritic cells (3Nair S.

Interestingly, the profile of cytokines secreted in response to GRP94 is distinct from those released following addition of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (19Basu S. Binder R.J. Suto R. Anderson K.M. Srivastava P.K. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Given that Hsp70 and GRP94 appear to fulfill the requirements predicted of a cell death messenger, it becomes important to identify the physiological scenarios in which pathological cell death contributes to heat shock or chaperone protein release. In addition to lethal viral infection, as illustrated herein, it would be of value to determine whether chaperones and heat shock proteins are released into the extracellular space during chronic inflammation, particularly as accompanies the onset of autoimmune disease (34Steinhoff U.

Bioessays. 2000; 22: 627-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Previously, we and others reported that the ER chaperone, calreticulin, can elicit epitope- and tumor-specific CD8+ T cell responses (3Nair S. Wearsch P.A. Mitchell D.A. Wassenberg J.J. Gilboa E. Nicchitta C.V. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6426-6432PubMed Google Scholar, 36Basu S. Srivastava P.K. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Of relevance to the current study, calreticulin from an ovalbumin-expressing cell line, E.G7-OVA, was reported to elicit an OVA-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte response (3Nair S. Wearsch P.A. Mitchell D.A. Wassenberg J.J. Gilboa E. Nicchitta C.V. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6426-6432PubMed Google Scholar). As is evident from Fig. 4, however, the calreticulin fraction obtained from cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing an OVA minigene did not display activity in an OVA re-presentation assay. If it is assumed that the uptake and processing of calreticulin from virus-infected cells are identical to that occurring with calreticulin from normal and tumor tissue, it would appear, then, that calreticulin is unable to bind the minimum OVA epitope in a stable manner. At present, the sequence and size determinants for peptide binding to calreticulin are not known, although the ability of calreticulin to function as a lectin is well established (37Vassilakos A. Michalak M. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3480-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 38Spiro R.G. Zhu Q. Bhoyroo V. Soling H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11588-11594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Asn-292 of ovalbumin is subject toN-linked glycosylation, and so the possibility exists that calreticulin binds an OVA precursor peptide that extends through the OVA epitope (amino acids 257–264) and includes Asn-292, the site ofN-linked glycosylation. It remains to be determined whether in vivo pathological cell death yields the release of GRP94 into the extracellular space. The data included herein identify a potential role for GRP94 in the regulation of immune response to pathological cell death. In addition, the experimental system used in the present studies is well suited to the analysis of the immunogenic and regulatory components produced and/or released by cells undergoing pathological cell death.

Feige U. Morimoto R.I. Yahara I. Polla B. Stress-inducible Cellular Responses. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1996: 255-271Crossref Google Scholar). Currently, UVA, like UVB, is considered to be a complete carcinogen (3Scharffetter-Kochanek K. Wlaschek M. Brenneisen P. Schauen M. Blaudschun R. Wenk J. Biol.

But the activation of signaling molecules and their pathways implicated in the process following UVA irradiation (5Bae G.U. Seo D.W. Kwon H.K. Lee H.Y. Hong S. Lee Z.W. Ha K.S. Lee H.W. Han J.W. J.

B Biol. 1997; 37: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) are not well understood. Therefore, the study of UVA-induced signal transduction will help in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying UVA-induced carcinogenesis. Activation of tumor cell proliferation requires an accelerated rate of protein synthesis, which is regulated in part by intracellular activation of several signaling protein kinase cascades that interact with the translational machinery of the ribosome (7Kimball S.R. Vary T.C. Jefferson L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 321-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Among them, S6 is a component of ribosomal proteins and is located at the interface between 40 and 60 S ribosomal proteins (8Stewart M.J. Thomas G. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of S6 at multiple serine sites on its C terminus was shown to be correlated with increased translation, especially of mRNAs containing a polypyrimidine tract in their 5′-untranslated regions (9Peterson R.T. Schreiber S.L. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R248-R250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This family of mRNAs constitutes as few as 100–200 genes but makes up 20–30% of the total cellular mRNA, indicating that they are important for cell cycle progression. The family of serine/threonine kinases that mediate S6 phosphorylation are known as ribosomal S6 kinases, one of which is a 70-kDa S6 kinase (p70S6K) (8Stewart M.J. Thomas G. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggests that the prominent role of p70S6Kactivation in mitogenesis may be to promote translation of mRNAs necessary for cell growth and division and to generate many of the molecules necessary for driving the cell cycle from G0/G1 to S phase (9Peterson R.T. Schreiber S.L. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R248-R250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initially, p70S6K was isolated from mitogen-stimulated Swiss mouse 3T3 cells (10Jenö P. Ballou L.M. Novak-Hofer I. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 406-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Subsequently, two isoforms of p70S6K (p70S6K/p85S6K, collectively termed p70S6K or S6K1) were found in purification, cloning, and expression studies (11Reinhard C. Thomas G. Kozma S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4052-4056Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Both isoforms are encoded by the same transcript with alternative translational start sites (12Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Based on evidence that an additional 23-amino acid extension at the N terminus of p85S6K was shown to function as a nuclear localization signal, p85S6K appears to be exclusively nuclear, whereas p70S6K is largely cytoplasmic (11Reinhard C. Thomas G. Kozma S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4052-4056Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 12Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). The p85S6K may be responsible for phosphorylation of the free chromatin-bound nuclear form of S6 (13Franco R. Rosenfeld M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4321-4325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Reinhard C. Fernande A. Lamb N.J. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Recently, deletion of the p70S6K gene was shown to have no effect on S6 phosphorylation, 5′-untranslated region mRNA translation, or the rate of cell growth, but it resulted in a small mouse phenotype (15Shima H. Pende M. Chen Y. Fumagalli S. Thomas G Kozma S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6649-6659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In p70 S6K −/− mice, another S6 kinase (S6K2) with a 70% overall amino acid homology with p70S6K and a potential nuclear localization signal at the C terminus was found to partially compensate for loss of p70S6K function (15Shima H. Pende M. Chen Y. Fumagalli S. Thomas G Kozma S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6649-6659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, another nuclear S6 kinase-related kinase was cloned and identified as a novel nuclear target of Akt (16Koh H. Jee K Lee B. Kim J. Kim D. Yun Y.H. Kim J.W. Choi H.S. Chung J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5115-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Generally, the p70S6K family plays a key role in the control of cell size, growth, and proliferation. Consistent with this concept, inhibition of p70S6Kactivation by microinjection of neutralizing antibodies (17Lane H.A. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Thomas G. Nature. 1993; 363: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) or treatment of cells with rapamycin, an inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-p70S6K (18Chung J. Kuo C.J.

Although p70S6K is known to be activated by various stimuli including growth factors, cytokines, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), oncogenic products, Ca2+, and inhibitors of protein synthesis (5Bae G.U. Seo D.W. Kwon H.K. Lee H.Y. Hong S. Lee Z.W. Ha K.S. Lee H.W. Han J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32596-32602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar,21Chou M.M. Blenis J.

Thr229 in the p70S6K activation loop within the catalytic domain has been shown to be phosphorylatedin vivo through the phosphatidylinositol (PI)-3 kinase pathway (24Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 31-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) and in vitro selectively by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) (25Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Thr229 phosphorylation has been shown to enable p70S6K activity and be repressed by wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase (26Weng Q.-P. Andrabi K. Klippel A. Kozlowski M.T. Williams L.T. Avruch J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5744-5748Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Additionally, similar to Thr229, Ser371 located in the kinase extension domain, has been shown to influence p70S6K activity, and its phosphorylation is also regulated by the PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway (27Moser B.A. Dennis P.B.

Thr389 is another site for mitogen-stimulated phosphorylation and is situated in a conserved 65-amino acid segment located immediately C-terminal to the catalytic domain (12Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 22Weng Q.-P. Kozlowski M. Belham C. Zhang A. Comb M.J. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16621-16629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). It plays an especially important role in p70S6K activation, because it influences both the phosphorylation of Thr229 in vitro by PDK1 and p70S6K activity (22Weng Q.-P. Kozlowski M. Belham C. Zhang A. Comb M.J. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16621-16629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Although p70S6K was shown to be phosphorylated by mTOR in vitro (28Burnett P.E. Barrow R.K. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Sabatini D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Other studies indicated that mTOR activity probably suppresses protein phosphatase 2A-mediated dephosphorylation of p70S6K (30Parrott L.A. Templeton D.J. J. Biol.

At the same time that p70S6K is activated by mitogens, the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) pathway is also stimulated (23Eguchi S. Iwasaki H. Ueno H. Frank G.D. Motley E.D. Eguchi K. Marumo F. Hirata Y. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36843-36851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), indicating that the activation of p70S6Kappears to coincide with that of ERKs. The proline-directed Ser/Thr (S/T-P) sites (Ser411, Ser418, Thr421, and Ser424) within the autoinhibitory domain of p70S6K are in a consensus motif similar to those known to serve as recognition determinants for mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Indeed, ERKs were shown to phosphorylate p70S6K in vitro, suggesting that the Ras/ERK pathway controlled p70S6K activation (33Mukhopadhyay N.K. Price D.J. Kryriakis J.M. Pelech S. Sanghera J.

But more recently, the ERK cascade, like PI 3-kinase/Akt cascades, has been demonstrated to be a prerequisite for p70S6K activation (23Eguchi S. Iwasaki H. Ueno H. Frank G.D. Motley E.D. Eguchi K.

Taken together, p70S6K activation appears to require a complex array of separate, concurrent phosphorylations at multiple sites catalyzed by various protein kinases, but its precise mechanisms of activation are as yet unclear. In our work, we provide evidence that MAPK pathways, like the PI 3-kinase/mTOR pathways, are implicated in phosphorylation and activation of p70S6K in response to UVA irradiation.

(Walkersville, MD); Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium,l-glutamine, gentamicin, and G418 sulfate were from Life Technologies, Inc.; aprotinin, leupeptin, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), PD98059, SB202190, and rapamycin were purchased from Sigma; wortmannin was from Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA); PD169316 was from Alexis® Biochemicals, Inc. (San Diego, CA); and epidermal growth factor (EGF) was from Collaborative Research (Madison, WI). The phosphospecific antibodies against phosphorylated sites of ERKs (Tyr204 of p44 and p42), c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) (Thr183/Tyr185), p38 kinase (Thr180/Tyr182), and antibodies to nonphospho-ERKs, -JNKs, and -p38 kinase were from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). The polyclonal antibodies against phospho-p70S6K at Ser411, Thr421/Ser424, or Thr389 and anti-nonphospho-p70S6K antibodies were also from New England Biolabs. Mouse anti-phosphospecific p70S6K(Ser411) mouse monoclonal antibody (A-6) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Active ERK1, ERK2, JNK1, JNK2, and p38 kinase and p70S6K S6 activity assay kits were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The CMV-neo vector plasmid was constructed as previously reported (37Huang C. Ma W-Y. Dong Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6427-6435Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Mouse epidermal JB6 promotion-sensitive Cl 41 and its stable transfectants with CMV-neo mass1 (Cl 41) (38Huang C. Ma W-Y. Li J. Goranson A. Dong Z. J. Biol.

Before each experiment, the transfectants were selected with G418 and tested with their phosphospecific MAPK antibodies. The UVA source used was a Philips TL100w/10R system from Ultraviolet Resources International (Lakewood, OH). It consists of a Magnetek transformer number 799-XLH-TC-P, 120 V, 60 Hz, and six bulbs each 6 feet long. UVA irradiation filtered through about 6 mm of plate glass, eliminating most of UVB and UVC light at all wavelengths below 320 nm, was performed on cultured cells in the UVA box with two ventilation fans installed to eliminate thermal stimulation. These adjustments were necessary, because the normal UVA lamps can also produce a small amount of UVB and UVC. The UVB irradiation was carried out in a UVB chamber with a transluminator emitting UVB light protons and was fitted with an Eastman Kodak Co. Kodacel K6808 filter that eliminates all wavelengths below 290 nm. This was also necessary, because a normal UVB lamp can generate a small number of UVC light protons. UVC radiation performed was from germicidal lamps. To assess the roles of different signaling pathways in p70S6Kphosphorylation, we pretreated JB6 Cl 41 cells for 1–2 h before UVA irradiation with Me2SO or kinase inhibitors including PD98059, SB202190, PD169316, wortmannin, or rapamycin dissolved in Me2SO. Immunoblot analysis for detection of phosphorylated proteins for ERKs, JNKs, and p38 kinase was carried out using the phosphospecific MAPK antibodies as reported previously (38Huang C. Ma W-Y. Li J.

The antibody-bound protein complexes were detected by Western immunoblotting using a chemiluminescent detection system (ECL, New England Biolabs). Some transfer membranes were washed with stripping buffer (7 m guanidine hydrochloride, 50 mm glycine, pH 10.8, 0.05 mm EDTA, 0.1m KCl, and 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and reprobed with other primary phosphospecific or nonphosphospecific antibodies. Cells (40 × 104 to 80 × 104) were seeded into 100-mm dishes and cultured for 24–48 h until the cells reached 80–90% confluence. The Cl 41, DNM-ERK2, DNM-JNK1, DNM-p38, or DNM-Δp85 cells were starved for 24–48 h in MEM containing 0.1% FBS, 2 mml-glutamine, and 25 μg/ml gentamicin. After treatment with UVA or kinase inhibitors as indicated (prior to irradiation), the cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in 200 μl of SDS sample lysis buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.1% bromphenol blue. The lysed samples were scraped into 1.5-ml tubes and sonicated for 5–10 s. Samples containing equal amounts of protein (Bio-Rad protein assay) were loaded into each lane of an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and subsequently transferred onto an Immobilon P transfer membrane. The phosphorylated p70S6Kprotein was selectively detected by Western immunoblotting using a chemiluminescent detection system and phosphospecific antibodies against p70S6K phosphorylation at Ser411, Thr421/Ser424, or Thr389. Nonphosphorylated p70S6K was used as a control to verify equal protein loading. p70S6Kactivity was measured by an immune complex kinase assay using an S6 peptide, AKRRRLSSLRA, as a substrate according to the procedure recommended in the S6 kinase assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) (5Bae G.U. Seo D.W. Kwon H.K. Lee H.Y. Hong S. Lee Z.W. Ha K.S. Lee H.W. Han J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32596-32602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates were prepared from JB6 Cl 41 cells or Cl 41 cell lines expressing DNM-ERK2, DNM-JNK1, DNM-p38, or DNM-Δp85 grown in 100-mm dishes. After starving by replacing medium with 0.1% FBS-MEM, the cells were or were not pretreated with inhibitors as described above and then irradiated with UVA (160 kJ/m2). The cells were harvested at the times indicated and lysed in 300 μl of buffer A containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 17,000 × gfor 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fractions containing equal amounts of proteins were incubated with p70S6K antibody at 4 °C overnight and then for an additional 4 h with protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After washing four times with PBS, the immunoprecipitates were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min in a mixture of the following: 20 μl of assay dilution buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 1 mm DTT), 10 μl of substrate mixture (S6 peptide in assay dilution buffer), 10 μl of inhibitor mixture (20 μm PKC inhibitor peptide, 2 μm protein kinase A inhibitor peptide, and 20 μm compound R24571 in assay dilution buffer), and 10 μl of [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi/μl; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To stop the reaction, each sample was spotted onto a numbered P81 paper square and washed three times (5 min each) with 0.75% phosphoric acid and once (5 min) with acetone. Each sample paper was transferred into a scintillation vial containing 5 ml of scintillation fluid and then counted in a β-scintillation counter. At the same time, immunoprecipitates isolated by nonimmune IgG serum instead of the p70S6K antibody were used as background controls. After subtraction of background from each of the samples, the UVA-stimulated p70S6K kinase activity was normalized to unstimulated controls and expressed as -fold change. Embryonic fibroblasts from normal,Jnk1−/−, and Jnk2−/− knockout mice were isolated and prepared according to the procedure of Loo and Cotman (42Loo D.T. Cotman C.W. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1998: 65-72Google Scholar). Cells were established in culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For analysis of protein phosphorylation, the cells were starved by replacing growth medium with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 12 h, at which time cells were exposed to UVA. The cells were lysed with SDS sample buffer, and the protein concentration in the supernatant fraction of the cell lysates was determined (Bio-Rad assay). Equal amounts of protein were resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated p70S6K proteins were determined by Western blotting analysis. Additionally, p70S6K kinase activity in these cell lines was measured following immunoprecipitation procedures as described above. JB6 Cl 41 cells were cultured in 100-mm dishes, starved for 24 h, and then lysed in buffer A alone. The cell lysates were centrifuged, and then the supernatant fractions were subjected to immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-nonphosphorylated p70S6K polyclonal antibody as described above. Samples containing immunoprecipitated p70S6K were incubated with active ERK1, ERK2, JNK1, JNK2, or p38 kinases (Upstate Biotechnology) at doses as indicated in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm ATP, and 0.01% Brij 35) (New England Biolabs) at 30 °C for 60 min. The reactions were stopped by adding SDS sample buffer, and phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated p70S6K protein was analyzed by using SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and a chemiluminescent detection system. The first antibodies are mouse phosphospecific p70S6K (Ser411) monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit phosphospecific p70S6K (Thr389, Thr421/Ser424) polyclonal antibodies (New England Biolabs). To further analyze whether p70S6K is activated by MAPKs in vitro, samples containing immunoprecipitated p70S6K were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min with S6 peptide plus active ERK1 (10 ng/μl), ERK2 (10 ng/μl), JNK1 (25 milliunits/μl), JNK2 (25 milliunits/μl), or p38 kinases (10 ng/μl) (Upstate Biotechnology), and p70S6K kinase activity was determined as described above. At the same time, incubation of immunoprecipitated p70S6K with S6 peptide only was used as a negative control, and incubations of S6 peptide with MAPKs were used as internal controls. The addition of bovine serum albumin instead of MAPKs or immunoprecipitated p70S6Kproteins was used as background control. After starvation for 48 h, JB6 Cl 41 cells were or were not irradiated with UVA at 160 kJ/m2 and then harvested at 15 or 30 min following irradiation. Immunoprecipitated p70S6K proteins were obtained by incubating the cell lysates with p70S6K antibody as described above. At the same time, immunoprecipitates with normal nonimmune IgG serum instead of p70S6K antibody were used as internal negative controls, and immunoprecipitates with antibodies against PI 3-kinase p85α (Z-8), p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) 3 (C-20), phosphotyrosine (PY99 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), PDK1, Akt, RSK1, RSK2, and mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase (Upstate Biotechnology) were used as positive controls. To examine whether p70S6K co-immunoprecipitates with PI 3-kinase, immunoprecipitated p70S6K proteins and corresponding PI 3-kinase controls were incubated with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate (Sigma), a preferential substrate of PI 3-kinase, and then PI 3-kinase activity was determined"

Examination of sequence data bases revealed the existence of a highly conserved homologue of PTEN. This homologue, termed PTEN 2, contained an extended amino-terminal domain having four potential transmembrane motifs, a lipid phosphatase domain, and a potential lipid-binding C2 domain. Transcript analysis demonstrated that PTEN 2 is expressed only in testis and specifically in secondary spermatocytes. In contrast to PTEN, PTEN 2 was localized to the Golgi apparatus via the amino-terminal membrane-spanning regions. Molecular modeling suggested that PTEN 2 is a phospholipid phosphatase with potential specificity for the phosphate at the 3 position of inositol phosphates. Enzymatic analysis of PTEN 2 revealed substrate specificity that is similar to PTEN, with a preference for the dephosphorylation of the phosphatidylinositol 3,5-phosphate phospholipid, a known mediator of vesicular trafficking. Together, these data suggest that PTEN 2 is a Golgi-localized, testis-specific phospholipid phosphatase, which may contribute to the terminal stages of spermatocyte differentiation.

The production of 3-phosphorylated phosphatidylinositol lipid products by the PI3K1 pathway is an important control point for the regulation of cell proliferation, growth, survival, and vesicular trafficking (1Toker, A., and Cantley, L. (1997) 387, 673–676.Google Scholar). The activation of this pathway by various growth factors, extracellular matrices, or oncogenic events results in a diversity of signals, including the up-regulation of the catalytic activity of the Akt/PKB kinases (2Chan T. Rittenhouse S. Tsichlis P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). These kinases enhance cell survival by phosphorylation of a number of substrates, including a subfamily of forkhead transcription factors (3Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S.

A novel mechanism for the control of the Akt/PKB pathway was identified when genetic evidence pointed to a tumor suppressor locus on chromosome 10 at q23–25. Analysis of a candidate tumor suppressor gene from this region demonstrated that the locus encoded a phosphatase, which was termed PTEN (also called MMAC and TEP) (1Toker, A., and Cantley, L. (1997) 387, 673–676.Google Scholar, 4Li J. Yen C. Liaw D. Podsypanina K. Bose S. Wang S.I. Puc J. Miliaresis C. Rodgers L. McCombie R. Bigner S.H. Giovanella B.C. Ittmann M. Tycko B. Hibshoosh H.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2124-2129PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies demonstrated that PTEN was mutated in a large percentage of brain, endometrial, and prostate tumors as well as a smaller percentage of other tumors (7Cairns P. Okami K. Halachmi S.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3935-3940PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Cowden disease and Bannayan-Zonana syndrome, which are both characterized by increased susceptibility to breast and thyroid tumors, showed a range of germline PTEN mutations, which were similar to those observed in tumors (10Eng C. Peacocke M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 223Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Enzymatic studies demonstrated that PTEN is a lipid phosphatase, which down-regulates the PI3K pathway by removing the 3-phosphate from the phosphatidylinositol 3,4(and 3,4,5)-phosphate phospholipids (PIP3,4 and PIP3,4,5) (11Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2601) Google Scholar). Importantly, many of the tumor-derived missense mutations observed in PTEN resulted in a complete loss of phospholipid phosphatase catalytic activity (12Lee J. Yang H. Georgescu M. Di Cristofano A. Maehama T. Shi Y. Dixon J. Pandolfi P. Pavletich N. Cell. 1999; 99: 323-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). The loss of the PTEN lipid phosphates activity due to mutation was expected to result in increased levels of PIP3,4 and PIP3,4,5 and the up-regulation of the Akt/PKB cell proliferation/survival pathway, an event that might induce tumor resistance to chemotherapy and radiation (13Haas-Kogan D. Shalev N. Wong M. Mills G. Yount G. Stokoe D. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1195-1198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Whang Y.E. Wu X. Suzuki H. Reiter R.E. Tran C. Vessella R.L.

Data supporting this conjecture demonstrated that glioblastoma cell lines mutated for the endogenous PTENlocus suffered deleterious effects on cell cycle progression (G1 arrest), proliferative capacity, and survival when transfected with a wild type but not a catalytically inactive, form of the phosphatase, suggesting that the enzymatic activity of the enzyme was involved with the regulation of this phospholipid signaling (6Li D.M. Sun H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2124-2129PubMed Google Scholar, 16Furnari F. Lin H. Huang H. Cavanee W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bookstein R. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2331-2334PubMed Google Scholar). These studies suggested that the loss of this phosphatase in tumors induced the up-regulation of the Akt/PKB signaling pathway, which resulted in cell cycle progression and inhibition of apoptosis. A number of animal model studies supported an important role for PTEN in the control of proliferation, survival, and cell size. Importantly, mice with homozygous null mutations in the PTEN locus showed early embryonic lethality due to an apparent hyperproliferative effect, whereas heterozygous animals developed tumors postnatally with apparent loss of heterozygosity at the PTEN locus (18Dicristofano A. Pesce B. Cordoncardo C. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar, 19Stambolic V. Suzuki A. Delapompa J.L. Brothers G.M. Mirtsos C. Sasaki T. Ruland J. Penninger J.M. Siderovski D.P. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 95: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2107) Google Scholar). This latter result suggested that the loss of PTEN expression was an advantageous event, which allowed tumors to grow in a more unregulated manner after the accumulation of other oncogenic mutations. Cell lines derived from PTEN null embryonic mice demonstrated higher levels of PIP3 phospholipids and enhanced activation of the Akt/PKB kinase (19Stambolic V. Suzuki A. Delapompa J.L. Brothers G.M. Mirtsos C. Sasaki T. Ruland J. Penninger J.M. Siderovski D.P. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 95: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2107) Google Scholar). These cells also showed significant resistance to a diversity of apoptotic stimuli, further endorsing a role for this phosphatase in the regulation of cell survival through the PI3K pathway. Additional evidence in both Caenorhabditis elegansand Drosophila supported a role for the PTEN phosphatase in the regulation of cell growth and survival. C. eleganscontains an insulin-like pathway, including an insulin-like receptor tyrosine kinase, a PI3K, PDK, and Akt/PKB kinases and a forkhead-like transcription factor, which is involved with dauer formation, a developmental stage where worms undergo a quiescent state. Genetic analysis of this pathway demonstrated that a worm homologue ofPTEN, termed DAF 18, could suppress upstream mutations in either the insulin-like receptor or PI3K, completely consistent with results found in the mammalian PI3K pathway (20Ogg S. Ruvkun G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 887-893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The involvement of this pathway in the regulation cell size was further suggested by studies in Drosophila. These data demonstrated that the fly homologue of PTEN was involved with the determination of cell size, consistent with other studies, which established the importance of several components of the PI3K pathway, such as Akt/PKB (21Goberdhan D. Parico N. Goodman E. Mlodzik M. Wilson C. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3244-3258Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 22Gao X. Neufeld T. Pan D. Dev. Biol. 2000; 221: 404-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Together, these three separate animal models provided strong proof for the relevance of the PTEN lipid phosphatase in the regulation of various aspects of the PI3K pathway. X-ray crystallographic analysis of PTEN structure revealed that this phosphatase contains a novel substrate recognition pocket with positively charged residues potentially involved with the association of the phosphates on the inositol ring substrate (12Lee J. Yang H. Georgescu M. Di Cristofano A. Maehama T. Shi Y. Dixon J. Pandolfi P. Pavletich N. Cell. 1999; 99: 323-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Positioning of many tumor-derived mutations known to disrupt catalytic activity to the active site in part served to explain the mechanism of action of the phosphatase. The mechanism by which PTEN appears to be associated with its phospholipid substrates appears to be quite complex. Structural analysis revealed a functional C2 lipid binding domain in the carboxyl-terminal region of the protein, which was proposed to serve as a lipid association motif (12Lee J. Yang H. Georgescu M. Di Cristofano A. Maehama T. Shi Y. Dixon J. Pandolfi P. Pavletich N. Cell. 1999; 99: 323-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Many tumor-derived mutations have been mapped to the carboxyl terminus, and a fraction of these are involved with the formation of an interface between the phosphatase domain and the C2 domain. These latter results helped to explain why mutations in the carboxyl-terminal region appeared to affect catalytic activity. Human, mouse, and Drosophila PTEN all contain a PDZ binding motif ((S/T)XV) at their carboxyl termini, and yeast two-hybrid analyses established that the PTEN phosphatase binds to PDZ domains of a family of membrane-associated guanylate kinases (MAGUKs), peripheral membrane-associated proteins with multiple protein interaction domains, which function to juxtapose signaling molecules and position them near the plasma membrane (23Wu Y. Dowbenko D. Spencer S. Laura R. Lee J. Gu Q. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21477-21485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Interestingly, some tumor-derived mutations are found at the extreme carboxyl terminus of PTEN, and these mutations would be expected to disrupt PDZ domain binding interactions, consistent with an important functional role for PDZ domain binding in PTEN tumor suppression. Because these MAGUKs are localized specifically to intercellular tight junction regions, these studies also suggested mechanisms for the positioning of the PTEN phosphatase to the lipid domains of subcellular regions such as the epithelial tight junction, a site known to be involved with the regulation of cell survival (24Watton S. Downward J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 433-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In this paper we describe a novel homologue of PTEN, termed PTEN 2, which has been identified using data base searches. Interestingly, this novel phosphatase is expressed uniquely in testis, and specifically in the secondary spermatocytes. In contrast to PTEN, PTEN 2 contains several potential transmembrane domains, which appear to target the phosphatase to the Golgi apparatus. Molecular modeling suggests that PTEN 2 is a lipid phosphatase with many active site residues conserved with PTEN, and enzymatic analysis demonstrates that the novel phosphatase actively dephosphorylates PIP3,5 and PIP3,4,5 in vitro. Together, these data suggest that PTEN 2 is a phospholipid phosphatase, which may play a role in the terminal stages of spermatocyte maturation by regulating intracellular levels of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate phospholipids. A human expressed sequence tag related to PTEN was initially identified from searches of public and private data bases. By using various protocols, including screening a testis cDNA library and PCR methods, we obtained a full-length sequence of human PTEN 2. A fragment of human PTEN 2 cDNA was used as a probe to isolate a full-length murine cDNA from a murine testis cDNA library. GST-PTEN 2 (amino acids 378–683) were subcloned into an expression vector containing a cytomegalovirus promoter. A catalytically inactive form of murine GST-PTEN 2 was constructed by changing Cys458 to Ser. To determine the localization of PTEN 2 in mammalian cells, a myc tag was placed at the carboxyl terminus of the gene. GFP-PTEN 2 was constructed by subcloning either the full-length cDNA or the amino or carboxyl terminus intoCLONTECH's pEGFPN3 vector. The PTEN 2 amino terminus includes amino acids 1–377, whereas the PTEN 2 carboxyl terminus includes amino acids 378–683. Fluorescence in situ hybridization mapping of mouse murine PTEN 2 was performed by SeeDNA Biotech Inc. The probe was an 8-kb BamHI genomic DNA containing the first exon of PTEN 2. For the molecular modeling, a sequence alignment was obtained by using ClustalW and a threading approach. The HOMOLOGY/MODELLER module from the Insight II package (version 98.0, MSI, San Diego, CA) was used for molecular construction and display. Docking of inositol (1,3,4,5)-tetrakisphosphate in the active site of PTEN 2 was manually performed as previously described for PTEN by Lee and co-workers (12Lee J. Yang H. Georgescu M. Di Cristofano A. Maehama T. Shi Y. Dixon J. Pandolfi P. Pavletich N. Cell. 1999; 99: 323-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). In addition to Northern analysis, we also determined the tissue distribution pattern of PTEN 2 using the PCR method. Mouse Multiple Tissue cDNA panels were purchased fromCLONTECH. After 35 cycles, the mouse PTEN 2 gene was only detected in testis. PCR primers (upper 5′-GAACTGGAACCATGGTG and lower 5′-TAGGAAGATTCGGAGAGAG) were designed to amplify a 423-bp fragment of PTEN 2. Primers included extensions encoding T7 and T3 RNA polymerase initiation sites to allow in vitro transcription of sense and antisense probes, respectively, from the amplified products. The hybridization was performed on 5-μm paraffin sections of formalin-fixed tissues. Prior to hybridization the sections were deparaffinized and treated with proteinase K for 15 min at 37 °C. [33P]UTP-labeled sense and antisense probes were hybridized to the sections at 55 °C overnight. Unbound probe was removed by treatment with RNase A for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by a high stringency wash (0.1× SSC for 2 h at 55 °C) and dehydrated in 70, 95, and 100% ethanol, respectively. The slides were dipped in NBT2 nuclear track emulsion (Eastman Kodak), exposed for 4 weeks at 4 °C, developed, and counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin. The intracellular localization of PTEN 2 gene was done in COS7 cells. 36 h after transfection, the cells were fixed using formaldehyde and stained using an anti-myc monoclonal antibody. The YFP-Golgi marker was purchased from CLONTECH. Brefeldin was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., and the transfected cells were treated for 40 min before fixation. Approximately 5 × 108 293 transfected cells were collected and resuspended in 100 ml of 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, 1836145). After sitting on ice for 15 min, the lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g and the supernatant was collected. The lysate was applied to a 2-ml reduced glutathione-Sepharose column and recirculated several times. The column was washed in 10 column volumes of 0.03% Brij35, 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 2 mm DTT. The GST fusion protein was eluted with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmDTT, 30% glycerol, and 10 mm reduced glutathione. The protein is stored in aliquots of 30 μl at −20 °C. Full-length human PTEN cDNA was cloned into the baculovirus expression vector, PH.hif, as a carboxyl-terminal HIS-tag fusion. The PCR primers used for this were: 5′-CATCGCGATCGCATGACAGCCATCATCAAAGAG-3′ and 5′-CTACGCGGCCGCTCAGACTTTTGTAATTTGTGTATGC-3′. Insect “Hi-Five” cells (Expression Systems) at 7.5 × 105/ml were infected with a multiplicity of 1.0 for 48 h and then harvested. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 100 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm DTT, and 5 mm imidazole. The suspension was sonicated for 1 min on ice and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 15 min. The supernatant was collected and recirculated over a 2-ml column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow (Qiagen, 1004493). The column was washed with 10 column volumes of lysis buffer and eluted with 5 × 1-ml steps of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmDTT, and 250 mm imidazole. Enzyme was stored at −70 °C in 20-μl aliquots. The lipid-based phosphatase reactions were performed essentially as described previously (25Maehama T. Taylor G.S. Slama J.T. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 27: 248-250Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The reactions (50 μl) contained 100 mmTris (pH8.0), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μmphosphatidylinositol phosphate substrates (Echelon), 1.0 mmphosphatidylserine (Avanti, 830052), and 50 μg/ml PTEN 2 or 10 μg/ml PTEN. Reactions were run at 37 °C for 3 h and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were treated with malachite green (Biomol Green, AK-111), and absorbance was measured at A 650. Perusal of human and murine DNA sequence data bases demonstrated a closely related homologue of PTEN in both species. Cloning of cDNAs encoding both the human and murine forms of the homologue revealed that, whereas a diversity of sequences were expressed in the human, a single species was found in the mouse. While this work was being completed, a human homologue of the murine sequence was reported, and chromosomal mapping suggested that there were a number of differentPTEN-homologous genes encoded in the human genome, some of which appeared to be pseudogenes (26Chen H. Rossier C. Morris M.A. Scott H.S. Gos A. Bairoch A. Antonarakis S.E. Hum. Genet. 1999; 105: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The sequence of the 664-amino acid (molecular mass 76,719 Da) mouse protein is illustrated in Fig. 1 and compared with the reported human PTEN 2 homologue and with PTEN. This figure illustrates that both the human and murine PTEN homologues are extended at their amino termini, and hydropathy analysis (Fig. 1) reveals that, in contrast to PTEN, the murine and human homologues appear to contain four high probability transmembrane domains followed by the catalytic domain. Interestingly, all four potential transmembrane domains contain charged residues embedded within the hydrophobic potential membrane-spanning sequence (Fig. 1). Using a structural algorithm, which predicts membrane topology, 2T. Wu, personal communication. we find that the murine homologue of PTEN may have a membrane-spanning structure, which is reminiscent of ion channels (Fig. 1). This sequence analysis suggests that the murine and human PTEN homologues appear to have extended amino termini, which may be involved with intracellular membrane association. Fluorescence in situ hybridization mapping revealed that the murine homologue mapped to a single locus on chromosome 8 between A3 and A4 (data not shown). The murine homologue appears to have a number of residues throughout the catalytic domain, which are conserved with PTEN (Fig. 1). Importantly, many of these residues are likely to be involved with substrate recognition and catalytic activity (Fig.2) (12Lee J. Yang H. Georgescu M. Di Cristofano A. Maehama T. Shi Y. Dixon J. Pandolfi P. Pavletich N. Cell. 1999; 99: 323-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). For example, residues Asp426, His427, Cys458, Lys459, Gly461, Arg462, and Gln510, which are identical between the two proteins, were all proposed to be involved with substrate recognition in the structural analysis of PTEN. In addition, Fig. 2 also illustrates that the vast majority of the tumor-associated PTEN mutations, many of which are known to disrupt catalytic activity, occur at residues that are also either identical or conserved between the PTEN and the PTEN homologue. These comparative data suggest that the murine and human homologues are likely to have similar substrate specificity as PTEN, and we have therefore termed the new protein PTEN 2. The structure of PTEN has been recently solved by x-ray crystallography at 2.1-Å resolution (12Lee J. Yang H. Georgescu M. Di Cristofano A. Maehama T. Shi Y. Dixon J. Pandolfi P. Pavletich N. Cell. 1999; 99: 323-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed a molecule consisting of an amino-terminal phosphatase domain and a carboxyl-terminal C2 lipid binding motif, which were tightly packing against each other through a large interface. The phosphatase active site is similar to that observed in protein tyrosine phosphatases, including the essential catalytic residues, but is enlarged to allow for the binding of the larger phosphoinositide substrate. C2 domains have been shown to mediate membrane lipid association. Based on the 39% sequence identity between PTEN 2 and PTEN, a three-dimensional model of the phosphatase and C2 domains of PTEN 2 has been built by homology modeling and threading techniques using the PTEN structure as template (Fig. 2). The existence of a C2 domain in PTEN 2 (PTEN 2-C2) was established by using threading analysis and the high conservation of residues forming the phosphatase domain/C2 interface (Fig. 2). This domain presents a 23% sequence identity with the PTEN C2 domain (PTEN-C2). In PTEN 2 there is a five-residue insertion in the “T1 loop” that could allow this loop to establish more extensive contacts with the C2 domain as compared with PTEN (Fig. 2). The catalytic residues essential for the activity in all protein tyrosine phosphatases are conserved in PTEN 2 (Asp426, Cys458, and Arg464) and occupy the same position in both, PTEN and PTEN 2 (Fig. 2). The high conservation of residues forming the substrate binding site in PTEN and PTEN 2 has structural implications for substrate recognition. In particular, the positively charged residues that have been proposed to interact with the negatively charged phosphate groups of the phospholipid substrate in PTEN are conserved in PTEN 2 (His427, Lys459, and Lys462). Manual docking of inositol (1,3,4,5)-tetrakisphosphate in the active site of PTEN 2 was performed as described by Lee and collaborators (12Lee J. Yang H. Georgescu M. Di Cristofano A. Maehama T. Shi Y. Dixon J. Pandolfi P. Pavletich N. Cell. 1999; 99: 323-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar) and indicated that this phospholipid might bind to PTEN 2 in the same binding mode as that proposed for PTEN (Fig.3). Like the PTEN-C2, PTEN 2-C2 lacks the residues present in other Ca2+-dependent C2-containing proteins that coordinate Ca2+ and regulate membrane binding. A patch of five lysines or “CBR3 loop” has been proposed by Lee and collaborators (12Lee J. Yang H. Georgescu M. Di Cristofano A. Maehama T. Shi Y. Dixon J. Pandolfi P. Pavletich N. Cell. 1999; 99: 323-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar) to mimic the Ca2+charge in PTEN. In PTEN 2, none of the five lysine residues in the CBR3 loop of PTEN is conserved (Pro607, Pro610, Tyr613, Asp614, and Cys616). A second “positive patch” in helix c2 (Lys644, Lys646, and Lys649) is conserved in both PTEN and PTEN 2. This region is similar to a helix in phospholipase A2 that has been shown to contribute to membrane binding. Together, these analyses suggest that many of the functional characteristics of the PTEN structure are conserved in PTEN 2. Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3) of various murine tissues using a PTEN 2 probe revealed a discrete ∼2.7-kb transcript, which was specifically expressed in testis, in agreement with results for the human PTEN 2 sequence (26Chen H. Rossier C. Morris M.A. Scott H.S. Gos A. Bairoch A. Antonarakis S.E. Hum. Genet. 1999; 105: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The specificity of testis expression is emphasized by the observation that PCR analysis of multiple murine tissues revealed a signal only in testis RNA, even after a large number of PCR cycles (Fig. 3). Because testis contains a diversity of cell types, some of which (spermatocytes) pass through a number of developmental stages (27Kerr J. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1995; 32: 364-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we decided to analyze this tissue using in situ hybridization. Isotopic in situhybridization was performed on adult testis, as well as on testes representing various stages of adolescence. In the adult testis a positive signal was observed in germ cells within seminiferous tubules, whereas cells in the interstitium of the testis were negative. The positive signal within the seminiferous tubules showed an uneven distribution with some tubules displaying a strong signal, whereas others were completely negative (Fig. 4). A positive in situ hybridization signal appeared to correlate with the presence of a specific cell population. The positively reacting cells reside in the adluminal portion of the tubule, are of small to medium size, have a round nucleus with evenly distributed, finely granular chromatin, and a distinct nucleolus. Based on morphological criteria, these cells are most consistent with secondary spermatocytes and/or very early spermatids. The abundance of the positive signal, together with the short half-life of secondary spermatocytes, makes it likely that both cell types express PTEN 2. Sertoli cells, spermatogonia, primary spermatocytes, or mature spermatids did not express PTEN 2 RNA. Expression in these cell types was ruled out on the basis of their location within the seminiferous tubules, size and shape of cell body and nucleus, and chromatin pattern. Expression of PTEN 2 during testicular maturation is not detected until day 19 of postnatal development (Fig. 4). In a time course experiment we were unable to demonstrate PTEN 2 RNA in testes removed on days 3, 7, 10, and 16. The expression of PTEN 2 RNA therefore slightly precedes sexual maturity in the male mouse, consistent with an association of PTEN 2 with late events of spermatogenesis. Examination of the PTEN 2 sequence suggested that four potential transmembrane domains are found in the protein, consistent with the possibility that PTEN 2 is a membrane-associated molecule that passes through the secretory pathway. To examine the subcellular localization of PTEN 2, a plasmid encoding a form of the protein with a carboxyl-terminal myc epitope tag was transfected together with a plasmid encoding a yellow fluorescence protein-trans/medial Golgi marker (encoding the first 81 amino acids of β1,4-galactosyltransferase) into COS cells, an"

We found that the Gram-negative obligatory aerobic bacteria Sphingomonas paucimobilis EY2395T have significant SPT activity and purified SPT to homogeneity. This enzyme is a water-soluble homodimeric protein unlike eukaryotic enzymes, known as heterodimers composed of tightly membrane-bound subunits, named LCB1 and LCB2.

We isolated the SPT gene encoding 420 amino acid residues (Mr 45,041) and succeeded in overproducing the SPT protein in Escherichia coli, in which the product amounted to about 10−20% of the total protein of the cell extract. Sphingomonas SPT shows about 30% homology with the enzymes of the α-oxamine synthase family, and amino acid residues supposed to be involved in catalysis are conserved. The recombinant SPT was catalytically and spectrophotometrically indistinguishable from the native enzyme.

In eukaryotes, sphingolipids such as sphingosine, sphingosine 1-phosphate, and ceramide are known to play important roles as second messengers in various cellular events including proliferation, differentiation, senescence, apoptosis, and immune response (1Merrill A.J. Jones D.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT: EC 2.3.1.50) catalyzes the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent condensation reaction ofl-serine with palmitoyl-coenzyme A (CoA) to generate 3-ketodihydrosphingosine (KDS). This reaction is the first committed step in sphingolipid biosynthesis, utilizing substrates that are shared by other metabolic pathways, and has an activity lower than those of other enzymes involved in sphingolipid biosynthesis. Therefore, SPT is thought to be a rate-determining enzyme in the sphingolipid synthetic pathway and, accordingly, a key enzyme regulating the cellular sphingolipid content (2Huwiler A. Kolter T. Pfeilschifter J. Sandhoff K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1485: 63-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic SPTs have been known as membrane-bound proteins, enriched in the endoplasmic reticulum with their catalytic sites facing the cytosol (3Mandon E.C. Ehses I. Rother J. van Echten G. Sandhoff K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11144-11148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic studies have shown that two different genes, LCB1 and LCB2, are required for SPT activity in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (4Buede R. Rinker S.C. Pinto W.J. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4325-4332Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 5Pinto W.J. Srinivasan B. Shepherd S. Schmidt A. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J.

Subsequently, mammalian homologues of theLCB genes from mouse, human, and Chinese hamster ovary cells have also been reported (7Nagiec M.M. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Gene. 1996; 177: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 8Weiss B. Stoffel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 8Weiss B. Stoffel W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The biochemical studies using the Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants demonstrated that both the LCB1 and LCB2 proteins are subunits of SPT (10Hanada K. Hara T. Fukasawa M. Yamaji A. Umeda M. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33787-33794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 11Hanada K. Hara T. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8409-8415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). There is a high sequence homology between LCB1 and LCB2, and they are classified as new members of the PLP-dependent α-oxamine synthase subfamily (6Nagiec M.M. Baltisberger J.A. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7899-7902Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Based on the finding that LCB1 does not have a PLP-binding motif while LCB2 carries a lysine residue expected to form a Schiff base with PLP, LCB1 and LCB2 have been speculated as a regulatory unit and a catalytic unit, respectively (6Nagiec M.M.

There is, however, no biochemical explanation for the regulation mechanism of the SPT reaction at present. The purification of the native form SPT from any eukaryotes has not been successful because of the extremely low content and instability of this enzyme. We, too, tried to construct the expression system of the mouse SPT complex in Escherichia coli (12Ikushiro H. Hayashi H. Kagamiyama H. Iriarte A. Kagan H.M. Martinez-Carrion M. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Vitamin B6 and PQQ-dependent Proteins. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland2000: 251-254Crossref Google Scholar). Affinity tagged forms of mouse LCB proteins lacking the membrane-anchor regions were coexpressed in E. coli as partially soluble proteins, but the purified SPT complex did not show enzymatic activity. As the only achievement, Hanada et al. (11Hanada K. Hara T. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8409-8415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) obtained an active SPT complex from the Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants expressing a hexahistidine-tagged LCB1 protein. However, it is very difficult to obtain a sufficient amount of the active enzyme for detailed enzymological analysis from such purification sources. Although sphingolipids are not typical membrane constituents in prokaryotes, there are some exceptions. In strict anaerobes such as the genera Bacteroides, Porpthyromonas, andPrevotella, high levels of sphingolipids were found; in some species their contents in the total extractable lipid came to 70% (13Batrakov S.G. Sheichenko V.I. Nikitin D.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1440: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar,14Batrakov S.G. Mosezhnyi A.E. Ruzhitsky A.O. Sheichenko V.I. Nikitin D.I. Biochim.

It has been reported that Bacteroides melaninogenicuscontains a water-soluble SPT, but the purification of this enzyme was not successful (15Lev M. Milford A.F. Arch. Biochem.

The Gram-negative obligatory aerobic bacteriaSphingomonas and Sphingobacterium are the genera whose lipid composition and structure of their sphingolipids have been investigated most extensively (16Yabuuchi E.

In cells of Sphingomonas paucimobilis, the lipopolysaccharide in their outer membrane is completely substituted by sphingoglycolipid, and its proposed structure is 1-O-d-glucuronosyl-2-N-2′-hydroxymyristoyldihydrosphingosine (glucuronosyl ceramide) (18Kawasaki S.

The primary structure of the enzyme has been deduced from the cloned gene, and the SPT protein was successfully overproduced in E. coli.

The enzyme solution was incubated in 100 μl of a standard SPT reaction buffer (100 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μm PLP, 0.4 mmpalmitoyl-CoA, and 2 mml-[3H]Ser (37 kBq/mmol)) at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by addition of 100 μl of 2 n NH4OH. The lipids were extracted with CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1 (v/v)), and the radioactivity of the [3H]KDS that formed was measured. The radioactivity extracted from enzyme-negative control was regarded as a background. For steady-state kinetic analysis, [14C]KDS was added to the extraction solvent as the internal standard to estimate recoveries throughout the entire procedure. [14C]KDS was enzymaticaly synthesized from [14C]serine using purified SPT. For TLC analysis, [14C]serine (10 kBq/mmol) or [14C]palmitoyl-CoA (10 kBq/mmol) was used as the substrate. The lipids were extracted and separated on TLC plates (Silica Gel 60, Merck) with a solvent of chloroform, methanol, and 2n NH4OH (40:10:1 (v/v)). [14C]Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine was added to the extraction solvent as the internal standard. Radioactive lipids on the TLC plates were visualized and their relative radioactivity was determined using a BAS2000 Image AnalyzerTM (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). All purification procedures were performed at 4 °C. The buffer of 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.5) containing 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm AEBSF (protease inhibitor), and 20 μm PLP was used in all the following procedures except for the fast protein liquid chromatography steps. The cells (30 g wet weight) were suspended in 300 ml of the buffer and disrupted sonically (Branson Sonic Power, Sonifier model 450) at 20 kHz for 9 min. The intact cells and debris were removed by centrifugation (10,000 ×g, 40 min). After the addition of (NH4)2SO4 (final concentration, 30% saturation) and centrifugation (100,000 × g, 60 min), the supernatant solution was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column (2.5 × 20 cm) equilibrated with the buffer containing 30% saturated (NH4)2SO4. The enzyme activity was eluted with 1 liter of linearly decreasing (NH4)2SO4 concentrations (30 to 0%). After the addition of (NH4)2SO4 (final concentration, 30% saturation) again, the active fractions were applied to a Butyl-Toyopearl 650M column (2.5 × 20 cm) equilibrated with the buffer containing 30% saturated (NH4)2SO4. The enzyme activity was eluted with 1 liter of linearly decreasing (NH4)2SO4 concentrations (30 to 0%). The pooled active fractions were dialyzed against 2 liters of the buffer. The dialysate was then applied to a DEAE-Toyopearl 650M column (2.5 × 20 cm) equilibrated with the buffer. The enzymes were eluted with 1 liter of linear gradient from 0 to 500 mmNaCl. The pooled active fractions were concentrated and dialyzed against 1 liter of 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm AEBSF, and 20 μm PLP. The dialysate was applied to a CHT-II column (1.35 × 3.5 cm), which had been connected to a fast protein liquid chromatography system, equilibrated with the same buffer. The enzyme was eluted with a 50-ml linear gradient from 10 to 200 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.5). The eluted enzyme was dialyzed against 1 liter of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) and then applied to a Mono-QTM HR column (0.55 × 5 cm) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl and eluted with a 25-ml linear gradient from 150 to 200 mm NaCl (pH 7.5). The active fractions were combined, concentrated to 1 ml, filtered, and stored at 4 °C. When 30 g of cells were used as the starting material, 350 μg of a pure preparation of SPT was obtained. The purified enzyme (8.9 nmol) was carboxymethylated, desalted, and digested at 37 °C for 30 min with lysyl endopeptidase (33 pmol). The digested peptides were isolated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a Cosmosil 5C18 AR-II column (2.0 × 150 mm) with a linear gradient from 0 to 60% acetonitrile containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The amino acid sequences were determined using a Hewlett Packard G1005A protein sequencing system. Based on the amino acid sequences of the SPT peptides, we synthesized degenerate oligonucleotides to obtain partial DNA fragments encoding the SPT gene by PCR against genomic DNA from S. paucimobilis. The oligonucleotides were 5′-GA(TC)GC(TCAG)CC(TCAG)GA(TC)AT(TCA)GCICC-3′ and 5′-GC(TCAG)GT(TG)AA(TGA)AT(AG)TA(TCAG)GG-3′ corresponding to the amino acid sequences DAPDIAP and PYIFTA, respectively (Fig. 5,dashed lines). The genomic DNA of S. paucimobiliswas prepared by a standard method (21Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Seidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (1994) inCurrent Protocols in Molecular Biology, Suppl. 27, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York.Google Scholar). PCR was performed using LATaq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Kyoto, Japan) under the following conditions: 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, (40+t) °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, then 72 °C for 10 min, where t denotes that the annealing temperature was successively increased by 0.25 °C at each cycle. The PCR product was directly cloned into a pCRII vector (Invitrogen, Netherlands) and sequenced by the “Dye-Terminator Cycle Sequencing” kit and an ABI 373A DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To obtain the full-length SPT gene, a genomic DNA library (1 × 106 recombinants) was screened with the32P-labeled PCR product (846 base pairs) as a probe. The library was constructed as follows. A genomic DNA from S. paucimobilis was partially digested by Sau3AI, 2.5–3.5-kilobase fragments were agarose gel-purified and ligated intoBamHI-digested pUC118, and these constructs were used to transform E. coli JM109. Labeling of the probe and detection of hybridized fragments were performed using the BcaBESTTMlabeling kit (TaKaRa, Kyoto, Japan) and Quick-HybTMhybridization solution (Stratagene), respectively. Twelve positive clones of the first screening were isolated. Restriction mapping and partial sequencing revealed that all 12 clones were derived from the same gene. The complete DNA sequence was determined for both strands of the three longest clones. The enzymes were applied to a SuperoseTM 12 and fractionated at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with an fast protein liquid chromatography system. Bovine pancreas ribonuclease A (Mr 13,700), bovine pancreas chymotrypsinogen A (Mr 25,000), hen egg ovalbumin (Mr 43,000), bovine serum albumin (Mr 67,000), rabbit muscle aldolase (Mr 158,000), bovine liver catalase (Mr 232,000), horse spleen ferritin (Mr 440,000), bovine thyroid thyroglobulin (Mr 669,000), E. coli aspartate aminotransferase (Mr 43,573 × 2), andE. coli branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (Mr 33,962 × 6) were used as standard proteins. The absorption spectra of SPT were recorded with a Hitachi spectrophotometer U-3300 at 25 °C. The buffer solution for the absorption measurements contained 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5) and 0.1 mm EDTA. SPT was equilibrated with the above buffer by gel filtration using a PD-10 (Sephadex G-25) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) prior to the measurement. Protein concentration during the purification procedure was determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Chemical) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The protein concentration of purified SPT was determined spectrophotometrically using a molar extinction coefficient of 2.83 × 104m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm for the PLP form of the enzyme. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was carried out with an SDS-Tris system using 10% polyacrylamide gel according to the procedure described by Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). S. paucimobilis and S. spiritivorum contain a large amount of sphingolipids as their cell components (16Yabuuchi E. Tanimura E. Kosako Y. Ohyama A. Yano I. Yamamoto A. J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol. 1979; 25: 95-107Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 17Yano I. Tomiyasu I. Yabuuchi E. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1982; 15: 303-307Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and thus sphingolipid biosynthetic enzymes have been expected to exist in these bacteria. Cell-free extracts (100,000 × g supernatants) prepared by sonication of cells of these strains were examined for SPT activity by incubation with [14C]serine and unlabeled palmitoyl-CoA. The lipids were extracted and subjected to TLC analysis. Some radioactive products were detected for each extract (Fig. 1). One of these products was indistinguishable in migration from KDS formed by mouse liver microsomes. The cell fractionation experiment indicates that the SPTs of these bacteria are water-soluble enzymes (Fig. 1). Because the extracts of S. paucimobilis showed higher SPT activity than that of S. spiritivorum, S. paucimobilis was selected as the starting material for the purification of SPT. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity by five steps of column chromatography. As shown in Fig. 2, the purified SPT showed a single protein band with an apparent Mr of about 50,000 on SDS-PAGE. Cell-free extracts of S. paucimobilis contain a large amount of yellow pigment, which was very difficult to remove by the initial two hydrophobic column chromatographies. Table I summarizes the purification of SPT from the S. paucimobilis extract. About 350 μg of the protein could be obtained from 6 liters of S. paucimobilis culture. The purification yield was reproducibly over 100% probably because some coexisting inhibitory materials were removed as the purification proceeded. The purified enzyme could be stored at 4 °C in sterile capped vials for up to 2 months in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) without loss of activity.Table IPurification of SPT from S. paucimobilisStepsTotal activityTotal proteinSpecific activityYieldnmol/minmgnmol/min/mg%Crude extract901901.00.05100Phenyl-sepharose108247.60.44120Butyl-Toyopearl8651.11.6896DEAE-Toyopearl2082.972230Hydroxyapatite3431.5229380Mono-Q3500.5700400 Open table in a new tab The Mr of the purified enzyme was estimated to be about 90,000 by gel filtration. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) gave a signal atm/z 44,916. These results show that the native SPT fromS. paucimobilis has a dimer structure composed of two identical subunits. The purified SPT had an absorption spectrum with two peaks at 338 and 426 nm other than the protein absorption peak at 278 nm in 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5) containing 0.1 mm EDTA (Fig. 3). These absorption peaks are characteristic of PLP enzymes, which contain the cofactor bound to the ε-amino group of a lysine residue in the active site (23Kallen R.G. Korpela T. Martell A.E. Matsushima Y. Metzler C.M. Metzler D.E. Morozov Y.V. Ralston I.M. Savin F.A. Torchinsky Y.M. Ueno H. Christen P. Metzler D.E. Transaminases. John Wiley & Sons, New York1985: 37-108Google Scholar). The addition of serine to the enzyme gave rise to an intense absorption band at 426 nm and a less intense band at 338 nm, which indicates that 338 nm absorption represents the active species and that the external aldimine complex was formed. The time course of KDS formation by the purified SPT was almost linear for at least 20 min, and this activity was proportional to the amount of purified enzyme up to 100 ng under the reaction conditions mentioned above. The optimum pH for KDS formation was 7.5−8.0. SPT from S. paucimobilis was not inhibited by halide ions. No inhibition of SPT activity was found with relatively high concentrations of palmitoyl-CoA (up to 10 mm). The substrate specificity is summarized in TablesII and III. To assess the specificity for amino acids, we determined the production of [14C]KDS derivatives from [14C]palmitoyl-CoA with 20 natural amino acids or various serine analogs. Purified SPT (50 ng) was incubated with 0.8 mm [14C]palmitoyl-CoA and 4 mm various amino as the substrate. The activity was detected only for serine among the natural amino acids examined (data not shown). Serine methylester and O-phosphoserine were converted to KDS at lower rates (5 and 3% of the mean levels of KDS formed with serine, respectively). However, at present, we cannot preclude the possibility that serine derived from serine methylester by hydrolysis was metabolized to KDS. We also examined the inhibition effect of excess amounts of nonradioactive competitors on the [3H]KDS production from 0.1 mml-[3H]serine (Table II). [3H]KDS production was inhibited about 80% by 4 mm nonradioactive l-serine under this assay condition. The inhibition of the [3H]KDS production by 4 mm each of other natural amino acids except for cysteine was 40% or less. The effect of cysteine can be ascribed to the thiazolidine formation of cysteine with PLP (23Kallen R.G. Korpela T. Martell A.E. Matsushima Y. Metzler C.M. Metzler D.E. Morozov Y.V. Ralston I.M.

John Wiley & Sons, New York1985: 37-108Google Scholar).O-Phosphoserine was the most effective, with α-methyl-dl-serine, 3-hydroxypropionate, and serine methyester following in this order. Seriamide and serinol were essentially inert. Among various acyl-CoAs examined, palmitoyl-CoA was the best substrate (Table III). The unsaturated bond of the acyl chain of CoA analogs did not significantly influence the SPT activity. The activity chain length profile showed a bell-shaped pattern, which peaked around C16.Table IIEffects of various amino acids on the formation of [3H]KDS from l-[3H]serineCompetitorRelative activity%None100Serine18Glycine96Alanine96Threonine65Cysteine17α-Methyl-dl-serine233-Hydroxhpropionate34Serinamide91Serinol98Serine methylester52O-Phosphoserine18Purified SPT (50 ng) was incubated with 0.1 mm l-[3H]serine, 0.8 mm palmitoyl-CoA and 4 mm of each nonradioactive competitor indicated.

Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 505-515Google Scholar).

SPT1 contains a 1260-base pair open reading frame (65% GC content) encoding a protein of 420 amino acid residues. The amino-terminal protein sequence of purified SPT was Thr-Glu-Ala-Ala-Ala-, indicating that the first methionine of purified SPT had been cleaved by processing. The deduced amino acid sequence of SPT is also shown in Fig. 5. The molecular weight of 44,916 obtained by ESI-MS is in good agreement with the value of 44,910 calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence of SPT without the first methionine within experimental error. The non-redundant data bases at the National Center for Biotechnology Information were scanned for amino acid sequences similar to the S. paucimobilis SPT sequence using the BLAST algorithm (25Altschul S.F.

To evaluate the role of the propeptide domains on triple helix formation, human recombinant type I procollagen, pN-collagen (procollagen without the C-propeptides), pC-collagen (procollagen without the N-propeptides), and collagen (minus both propeptide domains) heterotrimers were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Deletion of the N- or C-propeptide, or both propeptide domains, from both proα-chains resulted in correctly aligned triple helical type I collagen. Protease digestion assays demonstrated folding of the triple helix in the absence of the N- and C-propeptides from both proα-chains. This result suggests that sequences required for folding of the triple helix are located in the helical/telopeptide domains of the collagen molecule.

In the human body, it is expressed in most tissues and plays a structural, as well as a signaling, role in the development, maintenance, and repair of tissues and organs. 20 different collagen types are coded by more than 30 genes. Assembly of trimeric collagen intracellularly and formation of collagen fibers in the extracellular matrix is the result of a complex multistep process (1Haralson M.A. Hassell J.R. Haralson M.A. Hassell J.R. Extracellular Matrix: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1995: 1-30Google Scholar, 2Kadler K. Protein Profile. 1994; 1: 519-638PubMed Google Scholar). Within the endoplasmic reticulum, the individual procollagen polypeptides undergo several co- and post-translational modifications, including hydroxylation of specific prolyl and lysyl residues, selection and alignment of three procollagen polypeptides, and disulfide bond formation among the C-propeptides. Experimental evidence suggests folding of the triple helix begins at the C terminus and propagates toward the N terminus. Prior to triple helix formation, prolyl hydroxylase converts proline in the Y position of GXY triplets to hydroxyproline. Hydrogen bonding between the α-chains of the triple helix increases the denaturation temperature of the molecule, preventing it from unfolding at the animal's body temperature (3Berg R.A. Prockop D.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 52: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Triple helical procollagen is secreted from the cell, and the N- and C-terminal propeptides are removed by specific N- and C-proteinases. The resulting collagen monomers, consisting of triple helical and telopeptide regions, undergo a self-assembly process to generate collagen fibril intermediates and then mature collagen fibers. These fibers are further stabilized by covalent cross-links within the triple helix and telopeptide regions, providing strength and support to the surrounding tissue. Collagen biosynthesis has been studied extensively for many years, but the mechanism by which three procollagen polypeptides initially associate and come into correct registration is not well understood. Early work studying procollagen assembly suggested that the C-propeptide plays an undefined but critical role in assembly of a triple helical molecule (4Rosenbloom J. Endo R. Harsch M. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 2070-2076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Schofield D.J. Uitto J. Prockop D.J. Biochem. 1974; 13: 1801-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 6Uitto V.

More recently, the procollagen C-propeptide has been implicated in selection of appropriate procollagen polypeptides and correct registration of the triple helix (7McLaughlin S.H. Bulleid N.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The C-propeptide of type III procollagen is reported to direct the initial association of polypeptides and is required for helix formation (8Bulleid N.J. Dalley J.A. Lees J.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6694-6701Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Expression of α1(III)-α2(I) procollagen C-propeptide chimeras led to the identification of a discontinuous sequence of 15 amino acids, GNPELPEDVLDV…SSR, that directed procollagen self-association (9Lees J.F. Tasab M. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 908-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Other reports implicate the last 10 amino acids of the α2(I) procollagen C-propeptide, as well as intramolecular disulfide bond formation, as prerequisites for assembly of the type I procollagen heterotrimer (10Lim A.-L. Doyle S.A. Balian G. Smith B.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 71: 216-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 11Doyle S.A. Smith B.D. J. Cell.

Our studies further address the role of the procollagen polypeptides, especially the role of the C-propeptide of type I procollagen, in folding of the triple helix.

TheSaccharomyces cerevisiae expression system allowed us to evaluate the minimal requirements for collagen synthesis and folding, because these cells most likely lack any specialized genes for collagen biosynthesis in fibroblastic cells. We show that type I collagen heterotrimers expressed in yeast were correctly assembled into triple helical collagen monomers in the absence of the N- and C-propeptide domains from the proα1(I) and proα2(I) collagen polypeptides. Furthermore, we show that this same folding mechanism is operative in yeast in the absence of prolyl hydroxylase. The recombinant collagen forms normal fibrils in vitro.

Oppermann H. Hitzeman R. Nuc. Acids Res. 1984; 12: 8951-8970Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), as well as the yeast GAL1–10 dual promoter (16Johnston M. Davis R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1440-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar), driving the production of preproHSA-α1(I) procollagen. A plasmid encoding type I pC-collagen homotrimer was created using pGET323 as a template for PCR1 with the following primers: 5′-ACGCGTCGACAGCTGTCTTATGGCTATGATGAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTGGAAGCCTTGGGGACCAGGTGCA-3′ (antisense). This and all PCRs used the following program: 94 °C, 1 min; 60 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 3 min; 35 cycles. All DNAs generated by PCR were sequenced to confirm only the desired sequence was obtained. The PCR DNA was purified and digested with SalI-ApaLI. pGET323 was digested withSalI and DraIII, treated with calf intestinal phosphatase, and the 8.1-kb fragment was isolated. The 1.1-kbDraIII-ApaLI fragment from pGET323 was isolated, and the three fragments were ligated to create pDO243858, encoding α1(I) pC-collagen with the N-propeptide sequence removed and the preproHSA secretion signal fused directly to the N-telopeptide. pDO243858 was further modified by introduction of two stop codons after the last amino acid of the C-terminal telopeptide. This was accomplished using an intermediate plasmid that contained the 3′ half of the α1(I) procollagen cDNA from the BamHI site at nucleotide 2803, relative to the ATG initiator codon, to theSspI site in the 3′ untranslated region. The plasmid was digested with Eco47III and BspEI, and the following sequence was cloned using overlapping oligonucleotides: 5′-GCTGGTTTCGACTTCAGCTTCCTCCCCCAGCCACCTCAAGAGAAGGCTCACGATGGCGGCCGCTACTACCGGGCTGATGATGCCAATGTGGTTCGTGACCGTGACCTCGAGGTCGACACCACCCTCAAGAGCCTGAGCCAGCAGATCGAGAACAT-3′ (sense) and the corresponding antisense oligonucleotide to create a double stranded oligonucleotide that introduces NotI andSalI sites flanking the C-telopeptide/propeptide junction. The plasmid containing the 3′ α1(I) procollagen sequence with the newly introduced SalI and NotI sites was digested with these two enzymes, and the following oligonucleotides, containing two stop codons in tandem after the last amino acid of the C-telopeptide, were inserted: 5′-GGCCGCTACTACCGGGCTTAATGAGATGATGCCAATGTGGTTCGTGACCGTGACCTCGAGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCGACCTCGAGGTCACGGTCACGAACCACATTGGCATCATCTCATTAAGCCCGGTAGTAGC-3′ (antisense). DNA sequencing was performed on the resulting plasmid, pDO24805, to confirm the sequence. pDO24805 was digested withBamHI and ClaI, and the 1.5-kb fragment was isolated. pGET323 was digested with SalI and ClaI and treated with calf intestinal phosphatase, and the 5.5-kb vector backbone was isolated. pGET323 was also digested with SalI and BamHI, and the 2.7-kb fragment containing the 5′ portion of the α1(I) procollagen cDNA was isolated. The three fragments were ligated to create pDO248015, which encodes α1(I) pN-collagen. To construct a plasmid expressing only α1-rhcollagen I sequences lacking both N- and C- propeptide sequences but containing the telopeptide sequences, the 5.5-kb SalI-ClaI fragment from pGET323, 1.5-kb BamHI-ClaI fragment from pDO248015, and the 2.2-kb SalI-BamHI fragment from pDO243858 were ligated. The resulting plasmid, pDO248010 encoding α1-rhcollagen I, was confirmed by restriction digestion and DNA sequence analysis. Deletion of the N-propeptide and C-propeptide sequences from the α2(I) procollagen cDNA was achieved by first subcloning the 1.84-kb KpnI-SacII fragment from pGET462 (illustrated in Fig. 1 A) into theSacII-KpnI sites of Bluescript SKII+, creating plasmid pGET758. Deletion of the N-propeptide was accomplished by PCR using primers 5′-AGTACGCGTCGACAGTATGATGGAAAAGGAGTTGGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCCAGGAGTTCCAGGGAAACCACG-3′ (antisense) with pGET737 (similar to the illustration in Fig. 1 except the preproHSA signal was replaced with the native procollagen signals) as the template DNA. The PCR DNA was purified and digested with SalI and PstI and cloned into SalI-PstI-digested pGET758, creating plasmid pDO243861. The portion of the plasmid containing the PCR DNA was sequenced to confirm only the desired mutations were present. To reconstruct the promoter region into pDO243861, the 845-base pairSalI fragment from pGET758 was cloned into theSalI site. Isolates with the promoter in the correct orientation were identified by restriction digestion and DNA sequence analysis. The isolate with the desired configuration is pDO243863. To delete the C-propeptide sequence, a 3.1-kbSacII-ClaI fragment from pGET737 was subcloned into Bluescript KSII+ at the SacII-ClaI sites, creating pDO248019. This plasmid was digested with AvrII andCelII, and a DNA fragment, created by PCR using primers 5′-GGTCCTGCTGGTCCTAGGGGCCCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGAAGGTGCTGAGCGAGGCTGGTCTCATTAAGCCCTGTAGAAGTCTCCATCGTAACC-3′ (antisense) and pGET737 as template DNA, was inserted after purification and digestion with AvrII-CelII. Several isolates were sequenced and one, pDO248050, had the desired sequence. A plasmid expressing type I pC-collagen heterotrimer, lacking the N-propeptide sequences from both α1(I) and α2(I) procollagen polypeptides, was constructed by ligating the 5.494-kbNsiI-AgeI fragment from pDO243858, the 1.213-kbSacII-AgeI fragment from pDO243863, and the 6.922-kb NsiI-SacII fragment from pGET737. This ligation created plasmid pDO243865. A plasmid encoding type I pN-collagen heterotrimer was constructed in two steps. First, the 2.3-kb CelII-SacII fragment from pDO248050 was cloned into the SacII-CelII sites in pGET462, creating pDO243869. pDO243869 was digested withAgeI-NsiI, and the 8.141-kb fragment was ligated to the 5.494-kb NsiI-AgeI fragment from pDO248015, creating plasmid pDO243873. Finally, to create a plasmid encoding rhcollagen I heterotrimer lacking all four propeptide domains, the 6.922-kb NsiI-SacII fragment from pDO243873, the 1.213-kb SacII-AgeI fragment from pDO243863, and the 5.494-kb NsiI-AgeI fragment from pDO248010 were ligated, creating pDO248053. Plasmids pGET462, pDO243873, pDO243865, and pDO248053 were transformed into yeast GY5382 to create strains CYT89, -87, -90, and -59, respectively, and grown at 30 °C. Plasmid pDO248053 was also transformed into yeast GY5196 to create strain CYT38 and was grown at 20 °C. Yeast strains were transformed by electroporation (17Becker D.M. Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar) and grown in 2% glucose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base with ammonium sulfate, and 0.5% casamino acids. Induction of protein expression was performed in medium similar to that described above except a mixture of 0.5% glucose and 0.5% galactose was the carbon source, and the medium was buffered with 1% sodium citrate, pH 6.5. GY5196 strains contained 2% galactose as the sole carbon source during induction, and cultures were supplemented with 34 μg/ml uracil. Recombinant collagen was purified from yeast cells following fermentation at the 10-liter scale (Biostat C; B. Braun, Goettingen, Germany). Fermentation conditions were maintained at 30 °C (strain GY5382) or 20 °C (strain GY5196) (both strains as described in Ref. 12Toman P.D. Chisholm G. McMullin H. Giere L.M. Olsen D.R. Kovach R.J. Leigh S.D. Fong B.E. Chang R. Daniels G.A. Berg R.A. Hitzeman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23303-23309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), pH 6.5, and aeration at 1 air volume/liquid volume/min. Dissolved oxygen was controlled at 20% by automatically adjusting the impeller speed. The fermentation was started batchwise with medium composed of 5 g/liter casamino acids, 40 g/liter glucose, 0.5 g/liter galactose, and 13.4 g/liter yeast nitrogen base (YNB; Difco). Galactose levels were monitored throughout the fermentation and maintained at 0.5 g/liter. When the glucose was depleted from the medium, the culture was fed to achieve a final concentration of 20 g/liter glucose with 6.7 g/liter YNB added to supplement the growth medium. When the glucose from the first feed was depleted, a second feed of 20 g/liter glucose and 6.7 g/liter YNB was added to the fermentor. The yeast were harvested when cell growth ceased and were frozen at −80 °C. Frozen cell paste was resuspended in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.4 m NaCl and passed through a DYNO Mill (Type KDLA; Bachofen AG, Basel, Switzerland) to rupture the cells. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant, containing total soluble protein, was collected and delipidated using Celite 512. After delipidation, collagen was recovered from the soluble fraction by NaCl precipitation at neutral pH values as described (18Miller E.J. Rhodes R.K. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 33-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). The precipitate was resuspended and dialyzed into 50 mmsodium acetate, pH 4.5 (Buffer A), at 4 °C. The precipitate that formed during dialysis was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant containing the collagen was further purified by cation exchange chromatography. A column of SP-Sepharose (5 × 18 cm) was equilibrated in Buffer A at 4 °C, and the sample was applied to the column at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–0.5 m NaCl, 20 column volumes). Fractions containing purified collagen were pooled, and the protein was recovered by precipitation at an acidic pH value with NaCl (18Miller E.J. Rhodes R.K. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 33-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). The precipitate was solubilized in 10 mm HCl at a concentration of ∼3 mg/ml. rhcollagen I samples were assayed for helix formation and thermal stability by pepsin or trypsin/chymotrypsin digestion (19Bruckner P. Prockop D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 110: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Samples were digested with 150 μg/ml pepsin for 30 min at 10, 20, 30, 40, and 45 °C. The reaction was terminated by neutralization of the sample with 1 N NaOH. Trypsin/chymotrypsin digestion were performed as described previously (19Bruckner P. Prockop D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 110: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Prior to addition of the proteases, samples were preincubated at the desired temperatures (20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 45 °C) for 15 min. The proteases were added and incubated for an additional 2 min. Partially purified type I procollagen was obtained from serum-free conditioned medium of human skin fibroblast cultures by 20% ammonium sulfate precipitation. Procollagen was treated with proteases as a control in these assays. Reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 6% gels, and proteins were visualized by staining with Gelcode Blue (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Scanning densitometry was done using the Bio-Rad GelDoc 1000 gel scanner. Human fibroblast procollagenase (provided by Howard Welgus, Washington University Medical Center, St. Louis, MO) was activated by treatment with 10 μg/ml trypsin at 25 °C for 30 min. The activation reaction was stopped by the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. Samples were digested with activated collagenase in 0.05m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01m CaCl2 for 16 h at 25 °C. Digests were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 4–12% gradient gels, and proteins were visualized by staining with GelCode Blue. Purified samples to be analyzed by CD were diluted to a concentration of ∼100 μg/ml using 200 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. A 200-μl aliquot was placed in a rectangular 1-mm cuvette. The samples were analyzed using a Jasco model J-715 CD spectropolarimeter with a six-position Peltier controlled sample holder. The samples were allowed to equilibrate for 5 min at each temperature and were then scanned from 250 to 185 nm. The scan was repeated over a temperature range spanning the expected melting temperature (Tm). The results were plotted as the molar ellipticity at a given wavelength as a function of temperature. Aliquots of purified collagen samples were dried and then subjected to vapor phase hydrolysis overnight at 116 °C under N2, in vacuo. The hydrolyzed amino acids were derivatized with the AccQ-Tag chemistry kit (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA) and analyzed on an AccQ-Tag column using a Hewlett Packard model 1100 high pressure liquid chromatograph. Fibrils were formed by dialysis against 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, at 15 °C (20McPherson J.M. Wallace D.G. Sawamura S.J. Conti A. Condell R.A. Wade S. Piez K.A. Collagen Relat. Res. 1985; 5: 119-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The suspension of collagen fibrils was diluted with 20 mmsodium phosphate to 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/ml. A drop of the fibril suspension was transferred to formvar/carbon-coated grids (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA), washed with water, and air-dried. The grids were negatively stained with 1% phosphotungstic acid, pH 7 (21Birk D.E. Fitch J.M. Babiarz J.P. Doane K.J. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 649-657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Birk D.E. Nurminskaya M.V. Zycband E.I. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 202: 229-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and examined at 75 kV using a Hitachi 7000 transmission electron microscope. The magnification was calibrated using a line grating. For diameter determination, fibril diameters were determined as the average of three measurements and normalized to the periodicity of the collagen fibril as an internal standard. A previously described heterologous yeast expression system (12Toman P.D. Chisholm G. McMullin H. Giere L.M. Olsen D.R. Kovach R.J. Leigh S.D. Fong B.E. Chang R. Daniels G.A. Berg R.A. Hitzeman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23303-23309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was used to directly examine the role of the propeptides on folding of the type I procollagen triple helix. A plasmid was constructed that contained α1(I) and α2(I) procollagen cDNAs fused to the human serum albumin signal sequence under the control of the GAL1–10promoter. Additional constructs were made that did not contain the N-propeptide, C-propeptide, or both propeptides (Fig.1). This series of plasmids were transformed into a S. cerevisiae strain that was previously engineered to express functional chicken prolyl hydroxylase. Collagen expression levels were measured with a quantitative immunoassay that specifically detects native type I collagen heterotrimers but is unable to detect denatured type I collagen or type I collagen homotrimers (12Toman P.D. Chisholm G. McMullin H. Giere L.M. Olsen D.R. Kovach R.J. Leigh S.D. Fong B.E. Chang R. Daniels G.A. Berg R.A. Hitzeman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23303-23309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Expression of α1(I) and α2(I) procollagen heterotrimer lacking the N-propeptide (pC-collagen) resulted in detection of a 3.9-fold increase in expression relative to full-length procollagen (Table I). Surprisingly, a construct expressing α1(I) and α2(I) procollagen polypeptides lacking the C-propeptide (pN-collagen) was detected by the immunoassay; furthermore, expression was 5.9-fold higher than procollagen in the same strain. Because the assay detected pN-collagen, it strongly suggested that the pN-collagen polypeptides had folded into a triple helix. The generation of an expression plasmid that codes only for the telopeptide and triple helical region of collagen (rhcollagen I) lead to further increases in heterotrimer expression levels; expression was 18-fold higher than procollagen. These unexpected results suggest the propeptides are not required for folding, but their presence may act to limit expression in yeast.Table IExpression level of heterotrimeric collagen with and without propeptide domainsStrainProteins encodedCollagen expression levelsμg collagen/mg proteinCYT89α1(I)/α2(I) procollagen1.64CYT90α1(I)/α2(I) pC-collagen6.45CYT87α1(I)/α2(I) pN-collagen9.7CYT59α1(I)/α2(I) rhcollagen I29.8 Open table in a new tab The propeptide domains of procollagen are sensitive to proteolytic cleavage by pepsin, trypsin, and chymotrypsin, whereas the triple helix is resistant to these proteases. Additionally, collagen α-chains that are not correctly folded into a triple helix are susceptible to proteolysis (18Miller E.J. Rhodes R.K. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 33-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Protease digestion assays were performed to probe the helical conformation of the yeast-derived rhcollagen I and demonstrated that the chains were correctly registered and that the rhcollagen I was of the expected molecular weight. Purified non-hydroxylated and hydroxylated rhcollagen I and procollagen were treated with pepsin at different temperatures (Fig. 2,A–C). Non-hydroxylated rhcollagen I was resistant to pepsin digestion at 10 and 20 °C, whereas hydroxylated rhcollagen I was resistant to pepsin treatment up to 30 °C. The non-hydroxylated collagen polypeptides migrated slightly faster in SDS-PAGE gels than hydroxylated polypeptides (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 2 and 3), a finding consistent with previous reports of altered α-chain migration in gels because of the lack of hydroxylation (23Kao K. Prockop D.J. Berg R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2234-2243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fibroblast-derived procollagen control was converted to collagen and was pepsin-resistant up to 30 °C but was degraded at 40 °C. Resistance to pepsin alone should be evaluated with caution when judging the formation of a collagen triple helix (24Bulleid N.J. Wilson R.R. Lad U. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), with recommendation to use a combination of trypsin and chymotrypsin to probe the integrity and proper alignment of the triple helix. The rhcollagen I and fibroblast-derived procollagen were also treated with a mixture of trypsin and chymotrypsin, and the results of digestions with pepsin were confirmed with this mixture of proteases (Fig. 2,D–F). With the exception of the slight increase in mobility of the non-hydroxylated collagen, the size of the protease-resistant bands in both sets of digestions were the same for native and recombinant collagen, indicating that recombinant non-hydroxylated and hydroxylated rhcollagen I molecules have formed a correctly aligned, full-length triple helix. Furthermore, these results suggest that folding of the triple helix in yeast can occur not only in the absence of both N- and C-propeptides but also without prolyl hydroxylase. The ratio of pepsin-resistant α1 and α2 collagen polypeptides from hydroxylated rhcollagen I was not 2:1 as expected for type I collagen heterotrimer but was estimated to be 5:1 by scanning densitometry of SDS-PAGE gels. Our interpretation of this finding is that both heterotrimeric and homotrimeric (α1)3 rhcollagen I molecules are present in approximately equal amounts. The presence of homotrimeric type I collagen has been observed in tissue, certain fibroblasts producing type I collagen, and in other recombinant expression systems (25Uitto J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 192: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 26Lee S.-T. Smith B.D. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21824-21830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A further test of the integrity and alignment of the triple helix of rhcollagen I was cleavage using mammalian collagenase. Mammalian collagenase makes one specific cleavage in all three polypeptides in the triple helix at position 775–776. In addition to a specific primary sequence Gly-(Ile/Leu)-(Ala/Leu), the local structure and fold of the helix is also critical for collagenase cleavage (28Highberger J.J. Corbett C. J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 89: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 29Fields G.B. Van Wart H.E. Matrix Suppl. 1992; 1: 68-70PubMed Google Scholar). If the rhcollagen I triple helix were out of alignment by as little as 3 amino acids, collagenase cleavage would not occur (30Byrne M.H. Wu H. Birkhead J.R. Goldring M.B. Jaenisch R. Krane S.M. Matrix. 1993; 13: 30Google Scholar). Digestion of native type I collagen and hydroxylated rhcollagen I with mammalian collagenase resulted in the generation of typical collagenase reaction products (Fig. 3), indicating both rhcollagen I hetero- and homotrimers were cleaved by collagenase. The larger fragments of both α1 and α2(I) collagen (TCA) are visible on the gel, as well as the smaller fragments (TCB) from native type I collagen. Consistent with the lower ratio of α2 versus α1 rhcollagen I polypeptides, the proteolytic TCB fragment of α2 rhcollagen I was not visible on this gel. These results show that the polypeptides of rhcollagen I are properly aligned. Hydroxylated and non-hydroxylated rhcollagen I was compared with human placental type I collagen by CD spectroscopy over a range of temperatures. The Tm values determined by CD analysis were 30, 24, and 40 °C for hydroxylated and non-hydroxylated rhcollagen I and native type I collagen, respectively (Fig. 4)."

The small G-proteins Rac and Cdc42 are known to be important upstream mediators of JNK activation since constitutively active mutants of these small GTPases enhance JNK activity, whereas dominant-negative mutants block activation of JNK (14Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar, 15Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1564) Google Scholar). A putative downstream component of Rac and Cdc42 in the signaling pathway leading to JNK activation is the serine-threonine kinase p21-activated kinase (PAK) (16Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar), which becomes activated upon binding to GTP-bound Rac or Cdc42. We have previously shown that PAK is stimulated by AngII in VSMC in a tyrosine kinase- and PKC-dependent manner (5Schmitz U. Ishida T. Ishida M. Surapisitchat J. Hasham M.I. Pelech S. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1272-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our data implicated PAK as an upstream mediator of JNK in VSMC (5Schmitz U. Ishida T. Ishida M. Surapisitchat J. Hasham M.I. Pelech S. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1272-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). PAK consists of an NH2-terminal regulatory domain, comprising the p21-binding domain (PBD), an adjacent auto-inhibitory domain, 4 putative SH3 domain binding PXXP motifs, and a COOH-terminal catalytic domain (17Bagrodia S.

Rho family GTPases Cdc42 and Rac have been demonstrated to bind to PAK solely in their active forms,i.e. the GTP-bound state, via interaction with the PBD (16Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). PAK has been shown to be activated by tyrosine kinase receptors (19Galisteo M.L. Chernoff J. Su Y.C.

Recently, signal transduction pathways leading to AngII-induced activation of ERK1/2 in VSMC have been shown to include transactivation of the EGF receptor (29Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Iwasaki H.

By analogy to Grb2 and AngII-induced ERK1/2 activation, we surmised that the adaptor molecule Nck might play a role in AngII-mediated JNK activation by mediating translocation of PAK to the plasma membrane. In the present study we present evidence that AngII stimulates Rac1 in VSMC. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AngII promotes translocation of Nck and PAK to the plasma membrane in VSMC and that AngII-stimulated PAK activity is greatly enhanced in membrane fractions compared with the cytosol fraction. Overexpression of dominant-negative Nck mutants, in CHO cells stably expressing the AT1 receptor (CHO-AT1 cells), led to inhibition of PAK and JNK activation by AngII and significantly inhibited AngII-induced DNA synthesis. In addition, overexpression of a PAK mutant (PAK-A13) that cannot bind Nck could not be stimulated by AngII in CHO-AT1 cells.

The PAK-A13 mutant (pCMV6M-PAK-A13), which lacks Nck binding, was kindly provided by Jonathan Chernoff (31Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Plasmids containing wild type Nck (pEBB-Nck) and mutant Nck pEBB-Nck-W38,143,229K with inactivating mutations of all three Nck-SH3 domains (denoted Nck-KSH3all in this paper) and pEBB-Nck-R308K, with an inactivating mutation in the Nck-SH2 domain (designated Nck-K308 in this paper), were kindly provided by Bruce Mayer and have been described previously (32Tanaka M. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6829-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). VSMC were isolated from 200- to 250-g male Wistar-Kyoto rats and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum, as described previously (33Schmitz U. Ishida M. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Passages 8–15 VSMC at 80% confluence were growth-arrested by incubation in 0.4% calf serum for 24 h prior to use. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with angiotensin II type 1 receptor were kindly obtained from Dr. Kenneth Baker and maintained in F-12 media supplemented with 20 mmol/liter HEPES, 0.2 mg/ml G418, and 10% fetal calf serum. Transient transfection of CHO-AT1 cells using PAK1 and Nck plasmids was performed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Expression of transfected proteins was checked in each experiment by Western blotting with anti-Myc-tag antibody 9E10 for detection of PAK1 or monoclonal Nck for detection of Nck. Growth-arrested VSMC or CHO-AT1 cells were either left untreated or stimulated by 100 nm to 1 μmAngII for the indicated times. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The indicated antibodies or GST fusion proteins were added to equal amounts of protein per sample and incubated for 12 h at 4 °C. Antibody complexes were collected by addition of protein A-agarose for 3 h. GST fusion proteins were collected by addition of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 3 h. Precipitates were washed 5 times in cell lysis buffer, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 10 min. After centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 ×g, the supernatants were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with the indicated antibodies. Secondary antibodies were coupled to horseradish peroxidase, and Western blot detection was done by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Equal loading of the immunoprecipitated protein of interest was ascertained in every experiment by Western blotting. VSMC were incubated in hypotonic buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm EDTA for 1 h. Cells were scraped off the dishes, and lysates were precleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Cell lysates were then homogenized with a Teflon Wheaton Homogenizer by 30 Dounces and centrifuged in an ultracentrifuge at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatants were denoted the cytosolic fraction. Pelleted proteins were solubilized by addition of lysis buffer containing 2% n-octyl β-d-glucoside and centrifuged a second time in an ultracentrifuge at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant of the second ultracentrifugation was denoted the membrane fraction. For determination of PAK activity from membrane and cytosolic fractions, hypotonic buffer of cytosolic fraction was adjusted in order to obtain the same buffer conditions as was used for the membrane fraction. Growth-arrested VSMC were stimulated, and cells were lysed with lysis buffer containing 10 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mmol/liter EGTA, 5 mmol/liter EDTA, 50 mmol/liter NaCl, 50 mmol/liter NaF, 50 mmol/liter sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmol/liter sodium orthovanadate, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were precleared by centrifugation, and protein concentration was measured by DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). PAK antibody was added to equal amounts of protein per sample and incubated for 12 h at 4 °C. Antibody complexes were collected by addition of protein A-agarose for 3 h. Precipitates were washed 5 times in cell lysis buffer, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 10 min. After centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 × g the supernatants were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and PAK activity was assayed by32P incorporation into MBP using an in-gel kinase assay as previously described (4Duff J.L. Berk B.C. Corson M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 188: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). CHO-AT1 cells were co-transfected by Myc-tagged wild type PAK1 (pCMV6M-PAK1) or PAK-A13 (pCMV6M-PAK-A13) and the indicated pEBB-Nck plasmids for 24 h. Cells were then growth-arrested for 24 h prior to stimulation by 1 μm AngII for 30 min. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (see above). Myc tag antibody 9E10 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) was added to equal amounts of protein per sample and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. Antibody complexes were collected by addition of protein A-agarose for 2 h. Precipitates were washed 3 times in cell lysis buffer and 2 times in kinase reaction buffer. Subsequently, samples were incubated in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 50 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of 1 μg of MBP as substrate. The in vitro kinase reaction was stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer and heating of samples to 95 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 ×g, the supernatants were size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and MBP phosphorylation was assessed by autoradiography. JNK1 was immunoprecipitated from control and AngII-stimulated CHO-AT1 cell lysate 48 h after transfection of the indicated plasmids. Agarose beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100) and two times with kinase reaction buffer. Beads were then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 10 mmMgCl2, 50 μm ATP in the presence of 2 μg c-Jun-(1–79) as substrate. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer; proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and JNK activity was assessed by Western blotting with phospho-c-Jun-specific antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). PAK-PBD binding assay was performed essentially as described previously (34Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). In brief, the p21-binding domain of human PAK1, comprising amino acids 68–166, was subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc.) and was expressed in Escherichia coli as GST-PAK-PBD fusion protein according to the manufacturer's protocol. 15 μl of a 50% slurry of GST-PAK-PBD glutathione-Sepharose 4B was added to cell lysates of VSMC constantly rotating at 4 °C for 60 min. Bound proteins were collected by centrifugation, and pellets were washed three times in cell lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) and finally suspended in SDS sample buffer. Proteins were size- fractionated by SDS-PAGE and binding of Rho family GTPases was determined by Western blotting with Rac1 and Cdc42 antibodies. GST fusion proteins containing Nck-SH2 and the three Nck-SH3 domains were generated by subcloning of the corresponding polymerase chain reaction fragments from a template Nck cDNA (32Tanaka M. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6829-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) into pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nck-SH2 encoded amino acids 275–377; Nck-SH3–1 encoded amino acids 2–68; Nck-SH3–2 encoded amino acids 98–168, and Nck-SH3–3 encoded amino acids 190–256. Nck-SH fragments subcloned into pGEX-2TK were sequenced to exclude mutations due to polymerase chain reaction amplification. GST fusion proteins were isolated using glutathione-Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fusion proteins were checked by Coomassie Blue staining and yielded single bands of expected size for all GST-Nck-SH domains. The effect of AngII on [3H]thymidine incorporation into cell DNA was assessed as described previously (35Sachinidis A. Kettenhofen R. Seewald S. Gouni-Berthold I. Schmitz U. Seul C. Ko Y. Vetter H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2412-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In brief, CHO-AT1 cells were grown to confluence in 24-well plates and growth-arrested in serum-free medium for 24 h prior to stimulation with 1 μm AngII for 24 h. 20 h after addition of AngII 3 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine was added. 4 h later the experiment was stopped by aspirating the medium and subjecting the cultures to sequential washes with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 10% trichloroacetic acid (w/v), and ethanol/ether (2:1, v/v). Acid-insoluble [3H]thymidine was extracted with 0.5 m NaOH (250 μl per well), and 100 μl of this solution was mixed with 5 ml of scintillator liquid (Ultimagold, Packard Insturment Co.) and quantified using a liquid scintillation counter (LS 3801, Beckman Instruments). 50 μl of the residual solution was used for determination of protein using the Bio-Rad protein assay according to the method of Bradford (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215589) Google Scholar). Three independent experiments were performed where triplicate values for each condition were obtained. Data were calculated as cpm/μg protein. For quantification of Western blots or 32P incorporation into MBP, films were scanned and analyzed by densitometry using arbitrary units. Activation is presented as the fold increase over the respective control (mean ± S.E.). Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test (unpaired and two-tailed) using StatView 5.0 software. A pvalue of <0.05 was considered significant. To determine whether AngII stimulated Cdc42 or Rac in VSMC, we used the GST-PAK-PBD binding assay recently developed by Bagrodia et al. (37Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Creasy C.L. Chernoff J. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22731-22737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Cdc42 and Rac1 were expressed in VSMC as determined by Western blotting (data not shown). Addition of GTPγS to total cell lysates of VSMC increased binding of endogenous Rac1 and Cdc42 to GST-PAK-PBD, demonstrating functional integrity of the fusion protein used (data not shown). AngII stimulated binding of Rac1 to GST-PAK-PBD in a time-dependent manner, peaking at 1 min (3.1 ± 0.13-fold increase, n = 3) and showing sustained activation up to 10 min (Fig. 1 A, lower panel). The dependence of Rac1 binding to GST-PAK-PBD on AngII concentration was determined at 1 min. Maximal stimulation was observed at a concentration of 1 μm AngII (2.6 ± 0.62-fold increase, n = 3) (Fig. 1 B, lower panel). However, AngII-induced stimulation of Cdc42 was not observed (data not shown). Previous results obtained in VSMC (5Schmitz U. Ishida T. Ishida M. Surapisitchat J. Hasham M.I. Pelech S. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1272-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a tyrosine kinase other than Src is involved in AngII-mediated activation of PAK and JNK. To test for involvement of tyrosine kinases in Rac1 activation by AngII, VSMC were pretreated by 100 μmgenistein for 16 h or 10 μm PP1 for 15 min prior to stimulation by 1 μm AngII, and Rac1 binding to GST-PAK-PBD was determined. We have shown previously that 10 μm PP1 effectively inhibited Src activation by AngII in VSMC (33Schmitz U. Ishida M. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Genistein inhibited AngII-mediated binding of Rac1 to GST-PAK-PBD (fold increase of Me2SO = 2.47 ± 0.31 versus genistein = 1.21 ± 0.12,p = 0.02, Fig. 2 A, lower panel), whereas PP1 had no significant effect (fold increase of Me2SO = 2.47 ± 0.31 versusPP1 = 2.63 ± 0.37, p = 0.74, Fig. 2 B, lower panel), indicating that a tyrosine kinase other than Src is involved in AngII-induced Rac1 activation. We next examined the effect of PKC inhibition on Rac1 activation by AngII. Down-regulation of phorbol ester-sensitive PKC isoforms (PKC-α, -β, -γ, -δ, -ε, -θ, and -η) by pretreatment of VSMC with 1 μm phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate for 24 h inhibited AngII-mediated activation of Rac1 (fold increase of Me2SO = 2.8 ± 0.63 versus phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate 0.97 ± 0.21, p = 0.05, Fig.3 A, lower panel). However, the PKC inhibitor GFx, which is thought to inhibit preferentially PKC-α, -β, and -γ (38Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not have a major effect on Rac1 activation by AngII (fold increase of Me2SO = 2.8 ± 0.63versus GFx = 2.1 ± 0.25, p = 0.48, Fig. 3 B, lower panel). PAK has been shown to bind Nck by interaction of its first proline-rich region with the second Nck-SH3 domain (19Galisteo M.L. Chernoff J. Su Y.C. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. J. Biol.

In contrast, Zhao et al. (39Zhao Z. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3906-3917Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) reported that PAK autophosphorylation negatively regulated Nck-PAK interaction in COS-7 cells transfected by recombinant PAK. To determine whether PAK interacted with Nck in VSMC, we immunoprecipitated Nck from control and AngII-stimulated VSMC and evaluated binding of PAK by immunoblotting. At base line PAK was bound to Nck, showing no increase after AngII treatment of VSMC (Fig.4 A). To characterize further Nck-PAK interaction in VSMC, we performed in vitro binding studies using GST fusion proteins comprising the various Nck-SH domains and immunoblotted for PAK. As reported previously (19Galisteo M.L. Chernoff J. Su Y.C. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20997-21000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Goo"
https://openalex.org/W2055289764,"Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1), a mammalian Ste20-related serine/threonine protein kinase, is a hematopoietic-specific upstream activator of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Here, we provide evidence to demonstrate the involvement of HPK1 in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. HPK1 was activated and tyrosine-phosphorylated with similar kinetics following TCR/CD3 or pervanadate stimulation. Co-expression of protein-tyrosine kinases, Lck and Zap70, with HPK1 led to HPK1 activation and tyrosine phosphorylation in transfected mammalian cells. Upon TCR/CD3 stimulation, HPK1 formed inducible complexes with the adapters Nck and Crk with different kinetics, whereas it constitutively interacted with the adapters Grb2 and CrkL in Jurkat T cells. Interestingly, HPK1 also inducibly associated with linker for activation of T cells (LAT) through its proline-rich motif and translocated into glycolipid-enriched microdomains (also called lipid rafts) following TCR/CD3 stimulation, suggesting a critical role for LAT in the regulation of HPK1. Together, these results identify HPK1 as a new component of TCR signaling. T cell-specific signaling molecules Lck, Zap70, and LAT play roles in the regulation of HPK1 during TCR signaling. Differential complex formation between HPK1 and adapters highlights the possible involvement of HPK1 in multiple signaling pathways in T cells. Hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1 (HPK1), a mammalian Ste20-related serine/threonine protein kinase, is a hematopoietic-specific upstream activator of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Here, we provide evidence to demonstrate the involvement of HPK1 in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. HPK1 was activated and tyrosine-phosphorylated with similar kinetics following TCR/CD3 or pervanadate stimulation.

Optimal T cell activation requires two signals. A primary signal is delivered by the engagement of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR)1 with the major histocompatibility complex-antigen complex on antigen-presenting cells. Ligation of CD28 on T cells with the B7 proteins (B7–1 and B7–2) on antigen-presenting cells provides a costimulatory signal. Engagement of the TCR initiates tyrosine phosphorylation of immune receptor tyrosine-based activation motifs within the TCR-associated CD3 subunits by the Src family protein-tyrosine kinases, Lck and Fyn (1Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 197-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar,2Kane L.P. Lin J. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). This leads to the subsequent recruitment and activation of the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, Zap70 and Syk (1Wange R.L.

Immunol. 2000; 12: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). These protein-tyrosine kinases further activate several signaling molecules to transmit the TCR-induced proximal signals to downstream effectors. One of these critical signaling molecules is the linker for activation of T cells (LAT) (3Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). LAT is a 36–38-kDa palmitoylated transmembrane protein that localizes to specific plasma membrane compartments known as glycolipid-enriched microdomains (GEMs) or detergent-insoluble lipid rafts, which are critical for T cell signaling (4Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 5Xavier R. Seed B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Following TCR stimulation, LAT becomes heavily tyrosine-phosphorylated and serves as an anchor protein for association with a number of SH2 domain-containing signaling molecules, including Grb2, Gads, phospholipase C-γ1, and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (6Zhang W.

Immunol. 2000; 12: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Engagement of the CD28 receptor initiates multiple signaling pathways through Itk tyrosine kinase, Grb2, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to facilitate TCR signaling (8Chambers C.A. Allison J.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 9Rudd C.E. Immunity. 1996; 4: 527-534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Thus, costimulation of TCR and CD28 triggers a series of biochemical events, ultimately leading to the activation of downstream targets, including NF-AT, NF-κB, and AP-1, which in turn mediate interleukin-2 production. One important downstream pathway mediating T cell costimulatory events is the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascade (10Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). The JNK family, a group of serine/threonine protein kinases, belongs to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily, which consists of two other groups: the extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38 kinase families (11Chen Y.-R. Tan T.-H. Int. J. Oncol. 2000; 16: 651-662PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of these MAPKs is achieved through evolutionarily conserved signaling cascades, which comprise MAPK kinases (MAP2Ks), MAPK kinase kinases (MAP3Ks), and sometimes MAPK kinase kinase kinases (MAP4Ks) (12Chen Y.-R. Tan T.-H. Gene Ther. Mol. Biol. 1999; 4: 83-98Google Scholar). Down-regulation of JNK activity is correlated to the onset of T cell anergy (13Li W. Whaley C.D. Mondino A. Mueller D.L. Science. 1996; 271: 1272-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Studies ofjnk1- and jnk2-null mice showed that both JNK1 and JNK2 are required for the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into effector Th1 cells (14Yang D.D. Conze D. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T.

Although the importance of JNK in T cells has been established, the links between receptor engagement and JNK activation remain poorly defined. Recently, several mammalian Ste20-related MAP4Ks have been identified as upstream activators of JNK (12Chen Y.-R. Tan T.-H. Gene Ther. Mol. Biol. 1999; 4: 83-98Google Scholar). They include germinal center kinase (GCK) (16Pombo C.M. Kehrl J.H. Sanchez I. Katz P. Avruch J. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Force T. Kyriakis J.M.

It is likely that one or more of these MAP4Ks may mediate JNK activation during T cell costimulation. HPK1 is a 97-kDa serine/threonine protein kinase expressed only in hematopoietic cells and tissues (17Hu M.C.-T. Qiu W.R. Wang X. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2251-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 18Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). HPK1 consists of an N-terminal kinase domain followed by four proline-rich motifs, and a citron homology domain at its distal C terminus (12Chen Y.-R. Tan T.-H. Gene Ther. Mol. Biol. 1999; 4: 83-98Google Scholar). Previously, HPK1 was shown to interact with several SH2/SH3 adapters, including Crk, CrkL, Grb2, and Nck (24Ling P. Yao Z. Meyer C.F. Wang X.S. Oehrl W.

These adapters play an important role in the formation of signaling complexes following TCR/CD3 or CD28 stimulation (27Myung P.S. Boerthe N.J. Koretzky G.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 256-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Because of HPK1's restricted tissue expression, activation of the JNK pathway, and association with important T cell signaling adapters, we explored the role of HPK1 in TCR and CD28 signaling. We found the activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of HPK1 upon TCR/CD3 stimulation in Jurkat T cells. CD28 stimulation, however, did not induce HPK1 activation and tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, protein-tyrosine kinases Lck and Zap70 were involved in the regulation of HPK1. We found that HPK1 constitutively interacted with the adapters, Grb2 and CrkL, in Jurkat T cells and formed inducible complexes with the adapters, Nck and Crk, upon TCR/CD3 stimulation. More interestingly, HPK1 was inducibly associated with LAT and was recruited into the GEMs following TCR/CD3 stimulation. This work demonstrates the involvement of HPK1 in TCR signaling and provides possible links from the TCR to HPK1. The anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (OKT3) was purified from hybridoma cell supernatants on a protein G affinity column using standard protocols. The anti-CD28 mAb (clone 9.3) was kindly provided by Dr. C. June (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). Anti-HPK1 (N-19) and anti-CrkL (C-20) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Another anti-HPK1 antibody (Ab484) was described previously (17Hu M.C.-T. Qiu W.R. Wang X. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2251-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (4G10), anti-Grb2, anti-LAT and anti-Nck antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The anti-Crk and anti-Nck mAbs were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The anti-LAT antibody was a gift from Drs. W. Zhang and L. E. Samelson (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The anti-HA (12CA5) and anti-FLAG (M2) mAbs were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and Sigma, respectively. COS-1 and human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Jurkat T cells, Jurkat TAg cells expressing SV40 large T antigen, P116 (Zap70-deficient Jurkat), and JCaM1.6 (Lck-deficient Jurkat) cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. P116 and JCaM1.6 were generous gifts from Dr. R. T. Abraham (Duke University, Durham, NC) and Dr. A. Weiss (University of California, San Francisco, CA), respectively (28Straus D.B. Weiss A.

Human T cells were isolated by negative selection from human peripheral blood mononuclear cell buffy coats (Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center, Houston, TX) as described previously (30Bryan R.G. Li Y.

Peripheral blood T cells were cultured for 24 h in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum before stimulation. Cells were washed by phosphate-buffered saline once, resuspended in 1 ml of RPMI medium without fetal calf serum, and placed on ice for 10 min. Then, cells were mixed with anti-CD3, anti-CD28, or both together at 4 °C for 10 min. Rabbit anti-mouse antibodies (10 μg/ml) were added to cross-link the primary antibodies for another 10 min. Cells were placed in a 37 °C water bath for stimulation at the times indicated in figures. Cells were harvested at indicated time points and lysed by different lysis buffers based on assays as indicated in figure legends. The lysis buffers include 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mm EGTA, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 mmNaF, 1 mm Na3VO4), radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40) with protease and phosphatase inhibitors, and 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA) with protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The pCI-Flag-tagged vectors of wild-type HPK1 (Flag-HPK1) and its mutants, including kinase-dead mutant HPK1-M46 (Flag-HPK1(M46)) and the kinase domain only (Flag-HPK1-KD) were described previously (17Hu M.C.-T.

The calcium phosphate precipitation method was utilized for transfection of COS-1 and HEK293T cells as described previously (24Ling P. Yao Z. Meyer C.F. Wang X.S. Oehrl W. Feller S.M. Tan T.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For the HPK1 immunocomplex kinase assays, cell lysates (100 μg) were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HPK1 antibody (Ab484) or anti-Flag mAb (M2). Kinase assays were performed as described previously (24Ling P. Yao Z. Meyer C.F. Wang X.S. Oehrl W. Feller S.M. Tan T.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Myelin basic protein (MBP) and GST-Crk were used as substrates where indicated. For the JNK kinase assays, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA mAb (12CA5). Kinase assays were performed as described previously (17Hu M.C.-T. Qiu W.R. Wang X. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2251-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated by antibodies as indicated in figure legends. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were blocked with either 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 135 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) or 2% bovine serum albumin buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 2% bovine serum albumin fraction V) for anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. The membranes were probed with antibodies as described in the figure legends, and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody according to the primary antibody used. GEM fractions were prepared as described previously (3Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). In brief, Jurkat T cells (5 × 107) were either unstimulated or stimulated with an anti-CD3 mAb (OKT3, 10 μg/ml) for 2 min. Cells were harvested and lysed in 1 ml of 1% Trition X-100 lysis buffer. Cell lysates were mixed well with 1 ml of 80% sucrose and transferred to ultracentrifuge tubes. These mixtures were overlaid with 2 ml of 30% sucrose and 1 ml of 5% sucrose sequentially, and then subjected to ultracentrifugation for 16–18 h at 4 °C. Twelve 0.4-ml fractions were collected from the top of the sucrose gradient. These fractions were subjected to immunoblotting. To investigate whether HPK1 is regulated by TCR or CD28 signaling, we first performed an immunocomplex kinase assay to examine HPK1 kinase activity in Jurkat T cells upon TCR/CD3 stimulation, CD28 stimulation, or both in combination. We found that TCR/CD3 stimulation alone was able to induce HPK1 activation 2 min after stimulation, and that this activation decreased after 10 min. A similar pattern of HPK1 activation was also observed in Jurkat T cells with TCR/CD3 plus CD28 costimulation (Fig. 1 A). However, CD28 stimulation alone did not result in significant HPK1 activation (data not shown). We also observed TCR/CD3-induced HPK1 activation in purified human peripheral blood T cells (Fig.1 B). To confirm the specificity of HPK1 activation by TCR/CD3 stimulation, we transiently expressed the Flag-tagged wild-type HPK1 (Flag-HPK1) or its kinase-dead mutant (Flag-HPK1(M46)) into Jurkat TAg cells to examine their kinase activity following TCR/CD3 stimulation. By an immunocomplex kinase assay using an anti-Flag antibody, we found that only Flag-HPK1, but not Flag-HPK1(M46), was activated upon TCR/CD3 stimulation (Fig. 1 C). These results demonstrate that the engagement of TCR/CD3 elicits a signal to activate HPK1. Early events in TCR signaling include protein-protein interactions and tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling molecules. Previous studies showed that transfected HPK1 in COS-1 cells is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon EGF stimulation and is also recruited to the EGF receptor tail through the adapters Grb2 and Crk (24Ling P. Yao Z. Meyer C.F. Wang X.S. Oehrl W. Feller S.M. Tan T.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 25Anafi M. Kiefer F. Gish G.D. Mbamalu G. Iscove N.N. Pawson T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27804-27811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Recently, adapters Crk and CrkL were also shown to form inducible complexes with tyrosine kinases Zap70 and Fyn, respectively, upon TCR/CD3 stimulation (34Gelkop S. Isakov N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21519-21527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 35Boussiotis V.A. Freeman G.J. Berezovskaya A. Barber D.L. Nadler L.M. Science. 1997; 278: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). These observations provide a possible link between protein-tyrosine kinases and HPK1 during T cell activation. We therefore examined whether TCR signaling could induce tyrosine phosphorylation of HPK1. HPK1 was immunoprecipitated from the TCR/CD3-stimulated Jurkat cell lysates by an anti-HPK1 antibody. The immunoprecipitates were then subjected to anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblot analyses. Our results revealed that HPK1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated as early as 2 min after TCR/CD3 stimulation, and that this signal sustained to 10 min (Fig.2, top panel). Subsequent stripping and reprobing of the blots with another anti-HPK1 antibody confirmed that the position of HPK1 corresponded exactly to that of the phosphotyrosine band. A similar result was observed in Jurkat T cells treated with TCR/CD3 plus CD28 costimulation but not CD28 stimulation alone (Fig. 2, bottom and middle panels). Interestingly, the kinetics of HPK1 tyrosine phosphorylation was similar to that of its kinase induction, suggesting a correlation between these two biochemical events. The similar kinetics between HPK1 tyrosine phosphorylation and its kinase induction led us to further explore the possible link between these two biochemical events. To that purpose, we examined the HPK1 response in Jurkat T cells stimulated by pervanadate, a potent tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor capable of activating protein-tyrosine kinases and mimicking T cell activation (36Secrist J.P. Burns L.A. Karnitz L. Koretzky G.A. Abraham R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5886-5893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results showed that pervanadate treatment induced substantial and prolonged tyrosine phosphorylation of HPK1 in Jurkat T cells (Fig. 3 A). The same pervanadate-treated Jurkat lysates were further analyzed by immunocomplex kinase assays using anti-HPK1 antibodies. HPK1 kinase activity was potently stimulated after pervanadate treatment (Fig.3 B). These results strongly suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of HPK1 is important for regulating its kinase activity during T cell activation. We next attempted to determine which protein-tyrosine kinase(s) could regulate HPK1 during TCR stimulation. We compared HPK1 tyrosine phosphorylation in JCaM 1.6 (Lck-deficient Jurkat), P116 (Zap70-deficient Jurkat) cells, and wild-type Jurkat T cells. HPK1 tyrosine phosphorylation induced by costimulation of TCR/CD3 and CD28 was significantly decreased in JCaM 1.6 and P116 cells, whereas pervanadate-induced HPK1 tyrosine phosphorylation still remained at a substantial level in these two mutant cell lines (Fig.4 A). This suggests that T cell-specific tyrosine kinases Lck and Zap70 are critical for HPK1 tyrosine phosphorylation during T cell activation. However, pervanadate treatment could still induce HPK1 tyrosine phosphorylation through activating other tyrosine kinases in addition to Lck and Zap70. By cotransfection studies, we observed that ectopic expression of Lck and Zap70 with the kinase-dead mutant HPK1(M46) led to the HPK1 tyrosine phosphorylation in COS-1 cells (Fig. 4 B). Moreover, wild-type HPK1, but not the kinase-dead mutant HPK1(M46), was activated in the presence of Lck and Zap70 in transfected HEK293T cells (Fig.4 C). These results suggest that protein-tyrosine kinases Lck and Zap70 mediate TCR-induced HPK1 activation. HPK1-interacting SH2/SH3 adapters (e.g. Grb2, Nck, Crk, and CrkL) may function to couple HPK1 to protein-tyrosine kinases or tyrosine phosphorylated proteins. However, whether HPK1 interacts with these adapters in T cells was unclear. Therefore, we were interested in studying complex formation between HPK1 and these adapters before and after TCR/CD3 stimulation. By a series of co-immunoprecipitation analyses, we first observed that HPK1 formed an inducible complex with Nck in Jurkat T cells after 1 min of TCR/CD3 stimulation, and this complex sustained until 10 min of TCR/CD3 stimulation (Fig. 5 A). The kinetics of HPK1 interaction with Nck correlated with that of HPK1 activation, suggesting the possible involvement of Nck in the regulation of HPK1 during TCR activation. In addition, we found that the adapter Crk, unlike Nck, inducibly bound to HPK1 after 10 min of TCR/CD3 stimulation (Fig. 5 B). By similar co-immunoprecipitation approaches, we noticed that HPK1 formed a constitutive complex with Grb2 in Jurkat T cells before and after TCR/CD3 stimulation (Fig.6 A). In addition, a constitutive HPK1-CrkL complex was also observed in Jurkat T cells (Fig. 6 B). Our results, shown in Figs. 5 and 6, demonstrate the differential complex formation between HPK1 and several SH2/SH3 adapters during TCR/CD3 stimulation, indicating an important role for HPK1 in T cell signaling. It is known that the linker protein LAT plays a critical role in TCR signaling through interaction of its phosphotyrosine residues with the SH2 domains of several signaling molecules, including Grb2, Gads, phospholipase C-γ1, and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (6Zhang W. Trible R.P. Zhu M. Liu S.K. McGlade C.J. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23355-23361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 7Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Because of the LAT-Grb2 interaction, we attempted to examine the potential association between LAT and HPK1 in T cells. We performed the co-immunoprecipitation analyses and found that LAT formed an inducible complex with HPK1 as early as 1 min after TCR/CD3 stimulation (Fig.7 A). To confirm this interaction, we also utilized a cotransfection system to demonstrate that overexpression of LAT and HPK1 led to the LAT-HPK1 complex formation in transfected COS-1 cells (Fig. 7 B). We further determined the region(s) of HPK1 for LAT association. Two HPK1 truncated mutants, the HPK1 kinase domain (Flag-tagged HPK1-KD) and proline-rich region (HA-tagged HPK1-PR), were transfected into Jurkat-Tag cells to test their ability to interact with LAT. Interestingly, our data showed that only HPK1-PR inducibly associated with LAT upon TCR/CD3 stimulation (Fig. 7 C). HPK1-KD did not associate with LAT (data not shown). After exploring the regulation of HPK1 by TCR signaling, we next investigated whether HPK1 mediates TCR signaling for JNK activation during T cell costimulation. HPK1-PR and two MAP2K mutants, MKK4-AL and MKK7-K76E, were cotransfected with HA-JNK, respectively, into Jurkat TAg cells to examine their effect on JNK activation by TCR/CD3 and CD28 costimulation. We found that HPK1-PR failed to block JNK activation, whereas two MAP2K mutants, MKK4-AL and MKK7-K76E, blocked JNK activation effectively (Fig. 7 D). Although the JNK kinase assay was very sensitive to HA-JNK activity, we were unable to detect HA-JNK protein levels in transfected Jurkat T cells due to low transfection efficiency (data not shown). We did detect HPK1-PR expression as shown in Fig. 7 C. Thus, failure to block JNK activation by HPK1-PR was not due to the low level of HPK1-PR expression. Emerging evidence has indicated that GEMs (or lipid rafts) play an important role in T cell signaling (5Xavier R. Seed B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Disruption of these lipid microdomains results in the down-regulation of TCR signaling and consequently attenuated T cell activation. In T cells, many critical signaling molecules are enriched in GEMs constitutively or upon TCR/CD3 stimulation. They include tyrosine kinases (e.g. Lck and Syk), adapters (e.g. LAT and Grb2), and other signaling molecules (e.g. Ras and phospholipase C-γ1) (5Xavier R. Seed B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 37Janes P.W. Ley S.C. Magee A.I. Kabouridis P.S. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Given the evidence that HPK1 inducibly interacted with LAT, we tested whether HPK1 could be recruited into GEMs or lipid rafts upon TCR/CD3 stimulation. Our results showed that HPK1 rapidly translocated into GEMs upon TCR/CD3 stimulation (Fig.8, middle panel). However, HPK1 from unstimulated Jurkat T cells only remained in the Triton X-100-soluble fractions (Fig. 8, top panel). We also showed the presence of LAT in GEMs or lipid rafts as a control for this analysis (Fig. 8, bottom panel). This result suggests that the inducible LAT-HPK1 complex may recruit HPK1 into GEMs, leading to activation of HPK1 by protein-tyrosine kinases. Advances have been made in the characterization of signaling molecules (e.g. Lck, Zap70, and LAT) proximal to the TCR and downstream effectors (e.g. AP-1, NF-AT, NF-κB, and JNK) involved in interleukin-2 production. However, which and how the intermediate modulators integrate both the TCR and CD28 signals to downstream effectors for T cell activation remain unclear. Here we have investigated the role of a hematopoietic-specific JNK activator, HPK1, in T cell signaling. We first noticed the early kinase induction (1–2 min) of HPK1 following TCR/CD3 engagement in both Jurkat and human peripheral blood T cells, suggesting a close link between HPK1 and TCR/CD3-proximal signaling events. This idea is further supported by the observations that HPK1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated at early time points following TCR/CD3 stimulation, and that HPK1 was potently tyrosine-phosphorylated and activated by pervanadate stimulation. By cotransfection studies and the analysis of two Jurkat mutant cell lines JCaM 1.6 (Lck-deficient) and P116 (Zap70-deficient), we observed that Lck and Zap70 were essential for TCR-mediated HPK1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Moreover, we provided evidence that ectopic expression of Lck and Zap70 with HPK1 led to both HPK1 tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase induction. Our results are supported by a recent paper (39Liou J. Kiefer F. Dang A. Hashimoto A. Cobb M.H. Kurosaki T. Weiss A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 399-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) indicating that TCR-induced HPK1 activation is abolished in both Lck-deficient and Zap70-deficient Jurkat T cells. Future studies mapping the tyrosine phosphorylation site(s) within HPK1 will provide more insight into the regulation of HPK1 by Lck and Zap70. Interestingly, our data showed that HPK1 displayed a more significant level of tyrosine phosphorylation in pervanadate-treated JCaM 1.6 (Lck-deficient) cells than pervanadate-treated P116 (Zap70-deficient) cells, implying that Zap70 plays a critical role for HPK1 tyrosine phosphorylation in T cells. It is likely that in addition to Lck and Zap70, there are other protein-tyrosine kinases capable of activating HPK1. For instance, c-Abl tyrosine kinase inducibly binds to HPK1 in Jurkat T cells in response to DNA-damaging agents, and this c-Abl-HPK1 interaction results in HPK1 phosphorylation and activation (38Ito Y. Pandey P. Sathyanarayana P. Ling P. Rana A. Weichselbaum R. Tan T.-H. Kufe D. Kharbanda S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18130-18138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Our results showed that CD28 stimulation was unable to induce HPK1 kinase induction and tyrosine phosphorylation and also had no further effect on TCR/CD3-induced HPK1 activation. This suggests that, unlike JNK, HPK1 is mainly activated by TCR/CD3 stimulation. However, we do not exclude the possibility that CD28 may play a role in the regulation of HPK1 by other mechanisms, such as HPK1 localization and complex formation. Although HPK1 is a JNK activator and is implicated in TCR signaling, our data from transfection studies showed that the HPK1 mutant HPK1-PR, responsible for interaction with LAT and SH2/SH3 adapters, failed to block JNK activation by TCR plus CD28 costimulation. Recently, Liou et al. (39Liou J. Kiefer F. Dang A. Hashimoto A. Cobb M.H. Kurosaki T. Weiss A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 399-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) also showed similar results by using a kinase-inactive HPK1 mutant. These results suggest that HPK1 is not indispensable for JNK activation during T cell costimulation. One possibility is that other MAP4Ks may play a redundant role in JNK activation in T cells. For example, other HPK1-related kinases, such as GCK and GCK-like kinase, are also expressed in T cells and contain proline-rich motifs for interaction with SH2/SH3 adapters, suggesting their potential roles in TCR or CD28 signaling. Our result showed that HPK1 was recruited into GEMs after 2 min of TCR/CD3 stimulation. This finding further suggests that HPK1 participates in the early events of TCR signaling. In addition, the recruitment of HPK1 into GEMs is possibly involved in HPK1 activation and tyrosine phosphorylation. The underlying mechanism by which HPK1 is recruited into GEMs is still unclear. One possibility is that upon TCR/CD3 stimulation, SH2/SH3 adapters couple HPK1 to tyrosine-phosphorylated LAT or other signaling molecules localized in GEMs where HPK1 is activated and tyrosine-phosphorylated by protein-tyrosine kinases. The finding of early inducible association between HPK1 and LAT upon TCR/CD3 stimulation supports this possibility. We found that HPK1 differentially interacted with various adapters, including LAT, Nck, Crk, CrkL, and Grb2, in Jurkat T cells. HPK1 interaction with the adapters Grb2 and CrkL was found to be constitutive at all time points we tested, whereas HPK1 interaction with Nck and LAT was induced after 1 min of TCR/CD3 stimulation. The interaction of HPK1 with Crk, however, was induced at a later time point 10 min after TCR/CD3 stimulation. The early inducible association of HPK1 with Nck and LAT following TCR/CD3 stimulation suggests the potential roles for Nck and LAT in TCR-mediated HPK1 activation. Since LAT does not contain an SH3 domain for its direct binding to the HPK1 proline-rich motifs, the inducible HPK1- LAT complex formation is likely through SH2/SH3 adapters. One possibility is that the constitutive HPK1-Grb2 complex may be recruited to tyrosine-phosphorylated LAT upon TCR/CD3 stimulation. Recently, others have shown that HPK1 interacts with adapters Grap and Gads in T cells (39Liou J. Kiefer F. Dang A. Hashimoto A. Cobb M.H. Kurosaki T. Weiss A. Immunity. 2000; 12: 399-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 40Liu S.K. Smith C.A. Arnold R. Kiefer F. McGlade C.J. J.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1703-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because these two adapters are also shown to interact with LAT (7Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), they are potential candidates to couple HPK1 to LAT. More studies are needed to reveal the underlying mechanism of LAT-HPK1 complex formation in T cells. The constitutive HPK1-CrkL complex may participate in the TCR-mediated signaling events through CrkL binding to Fyn upon TCR/CD3 stimulation (35Boussiotis V.A. Freeman G.J. Berezovskaya A. Barber D.L. Nadler L.M. Science. 1997; 278: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Unlike the previous finding that CrkL binds and activates HPK1 in an overexpression system (24Ling P. Yao Z. Meyer C.F. Wang X.S. Oehrl W. Feller S.M. Tan T.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the constitutive HPK1-CrkL interaction in Jurkat T cells did not lead to HPK1 activation. The possible reason is that in transfected cells, overexpressed CrkL and HPK1 may circumvent regulation by other endogenous or tissue-specific factors to amplify the signaling pathways. In contrast, these factors may tightly regulate endogenous CrkL and HPK1 in Jurkat T cells. Thus, this could be one reason why the constitutive CrkL-HPK1 interaction did not lead to HPK1 activation in Jurkat T cells. Finally, we have reported the late inducible association between HPK1 and Crk. The functional relevance of this late interaction is unclear. One possibility is that Crk couples HPK1 to other downstream signaling events in T cells. In addition to the inducible Crk-HPK1 complex, we observed a low level of constitutive Crk-HPK1 complex in Jurkat T cells (data not shown). Therefore, Crk may play a role in coupling HPK1 to Zap70 upon TCR/CD3 stimulation. HPK1 association with multiple adapters in T cells implies an important role for HPK1 in T cell signaling. Future studies will focus on dissecting the multiple HPK1-mediated signaling pathways in T cells. We thank members of the Tan laboratory for their critical reviews of the manuscript, S. Lee and A.

RAC3 (AIB1) is unique among the SRC/p160 family of coactivators, because it is amplified and overexpressed in a subset of breast cancers (16Anzick S.L. Kononen J. Walker R.L. Azorsa D.O. Tanner M.M.

It has been demonstrated that RAC3 (AIB1) activators form a stable complex with ERα in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (31Tikkanen M.K. Carter D.J. Harris A.M. Le H.M. Azorsa D.O. Meltzer P.S. Murdoch F.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12536-12540Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), suggesting that RAC3 may play an important role in regulating ER function in vivo. The SRC/p160 coactivators share a common domain structure, including a highly conserved N-terminal basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domains (9Leo C. Chen J.D. Gene. 2000; 245: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The PAS domain can be subdivided into A and B regions. This domain is highly conserved among severalDrosophila and mammalian proteins, including Per, Sim, and Arnt (32Huang Z.J. Edery I. Rosbash M. Nature. 1993; 364: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), as well as in many regulators of circadian rhythm and neural development (for a review, see Ref. 33Crews S.T. Fan C.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 580-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The bHLH-PAS domain ofDrosophila proteins plays an important role in mediating protein-protein interaction (34Pongratz I. Antonsson C. Whitelaw M.L. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell.

Here, we report the identification of a human homologue of the yeast MMS19 as an RAC3-interacting protein isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screening with the bHLH-PAS domain of RAC3 as bait. Interestingly, hMMS19 also interacts with ERs in a ligand-independent manner. Our data suggest that hMMS19 may function as an AF-1-specific transcriptional coactivator of ER. The DNA fragments encoding various N-terminal domains of human RAC3 (14Li H. Gomes P.J. Chen J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The amplified DNA fragments were subcloned into pGBT9 vector (CLONTECH, Inc.), for expression of Gal4 DNA binding domain-RAC3 fusion proteins in yeast, or into the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for expression of GST fusion proteins in Escherichia coli. The polylinker regions of these constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Detail information of these constructs and the polymerase chain reaction primers used in this study are available upon request. The yeast two-hybrid screening was conducted as described previously (14Li H. Gomes P.J. Chen J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8479-8484Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Briefly, the pGBT-RAC3-N (amino acids 1–408) was used as bait to screen a human placenta cDNA library (CLONTECH, Inc.). Positive clones were isolated and tested for β-galactosidase expression. Library plasmids were recovered and tested with various baits to confirm specificity of the protein-protein interactions. The RAC3 screening clone 2.1 (RS2.1) showed homology with the yeast MMS19 protein and was further analyzed in this study. The human MMS19-specific primer (CAT AAG ATA GGA GAT CTG GCT GGG CAC CCA AGA CTG TC) was used to amplify the extreme 5′-end of the hMMS19 cDNA from a HeLa cell Marathon-ready cDNA along with an adaptor primer from the manufacturer (CLONTECH, Inc.). The resultant product was re-amplified and subcloned into pBluescript II SK+ and sequenced. The RS2.1 insert was released with SalI/BglII and subcloned into the pCMX-HA vector. pCMX-HA-hMMS19mt was constructed by assembling theSalI/BglII fragment of the longest RACE clone and the BglII/NsiI fragment of GenBank™ accession number AF007151 (Research Genetics) together with aSalI/NsiI fragment of the RS2.1 clone. The pCMX-HA-hMMS19 was obtained by replacing theDra3/NsiI fragment of pCMX-HA-hMMS19mt with the same fragment from the expressed sequence tag clone BE206052(GenBank accession number). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Multiple Tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) were probed with a32P-labeled NsiI/BglII 1.5-kb fragment of hMMS19. Hybridization was performed using the ExpressHyb solution (CLONTECH). The blot was washed twice for 20 min in 2× SSC/0.1% SDS at room temperature and subjected to autoradiography at −70 °C. GST fusion proteins were expressed inE. coli BL-21 cells and purified by glutathione agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 35S-Labeled proteins were made by in vitro transcription/translation reactions using the T7-Quick reticulocyte lysate (Promega). For GST pull-down assay, 5 μg of bead-conjugated fusion protein was incubated with 5 μl of in vitro translated 35S-labeled protein with moderate shaking at 4 °C overnight in binding buffer as previously described (37Li H. Leo C. Zhu J. Wu X. O'Neil J. Park E.J. Chen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1784-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The pellet was washed four times with the binding buffer. Supernatant was removed, and bound protein was eluted in SDS sample buffer by boiling. The complex was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. One day before transfection, cells were seeded in 12-well plates at 50,000 cells per well in phenol-red free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% charcoal resin-stripped fetal bovine serum. Transfection was performed using a standard calcium/phosphate method as described before (37Li H. Leo C. Zhu J. Wu X. O'Neil J. Park E.J. Chen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1784-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). After transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and re-fed with fresh medium containing either vehicle alone or vehicle plus ligands. Cells were lysed 24 h after treatment and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. To identify proteins that interact with the bHLH-PAS domain of RAC3, we conducted yeast two-hybrid screening with the RAC3-N-terminal domain as bait. The RS2.1 clone showed strongest interaction. Sequence analysis and data base search revealed that RS2.1 encodes a C-terminal 164-amino acid polypeptide that shares homology with the yeast MMS19 (38Lauder S. Bankmann M. Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6783-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The full-length cDNA of RS2.1 was obtained, and it predicts an open reading frame of 1030 amino acids (Fig. 1 A). The full-length RS2.1 is named hMMS19 because it is related in size and sequence to the yeast MMS19. We also found a mutant cDNA clone in the GenBank™ (accession number AF007151), which contains a single deletion at nucleotide 2240, resulting in a truncation mutant at 779 amino acids. We designate this truncation mutant as hMMS19-mt. Comparison of hMMS19 with the yeast homologue shows a 36% overall similarity (or 26% identity). The homology is most striking at the N- and C-terminal regions with 61% or 57% similarities, respectively. Related sequences were also predicted from the genomes ofDrosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Arabidopsis thaliana. Alignment of these sequences indicates that MMS19 is conserved through evolution at the N- and C-terminal domains, whereas the central region has diverged significantly. We also found that the hMMS19 gene resides in a genomic clone (RP11–445I23, accession number AL359388), which maps to chromosome 10q24. Interestingly, loss of heterozygosity in this region was observed in several human cancers, including endometrial and prostate carcinomas (39Alers J.C. Rochat J. Krijtenburg P.J. Hop W.C. Kranse R. Rosenberg C. Tanke H.J. Schroder F.H. van Dekken H. Lab. Invest. 2000; 80: 931-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 40Cappellen D. Gil Diez de Medina S. Chopin D. Thiery J.P. Radvanyi F. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 3059-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of hMMS19 in various human cancer cells revealed a single transcript of about 4 kb (Fig. 1 B,top). The size of this message is in agreement with the length of the hMMS19 cDNA. The hMMS19transcript was detected in all cancer cell lines analyzed as well as in several human tissues such as heart, brain, placenta, liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney (data not shown), suggesting that hMMS19is ubiquitously expressed. Furthermore, by indirect immunofluorescence, we found that hMMS19 is located in the cell nucleus (Fig.1 C). This nuclear localization is consistent with the hypothesis that MMS19 is involved in DNA repair and transcriptional regulation. To further analyze the interaction of hMMS19 with RAC3, we first tested the specificity of RS2.1 interactions with various baits in a yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig.2 A). As expected, RS2.1 alone did not activate reporter expression nor did the bait RAC3-N or other unrelated baits. Coexpression of RS2.1 with RAC3-N strongly activated reporter expression as expected. In contrast, RS2.1 did not interact with the bHLH-PAS domain of mouse Sim2 (Sim-N) nor did it interact with RARα or p53. These data confirm that RS2.1 interacts specifically with RAC3-N in the yeast two-hybrid assay. We then mapped the RS2.1-interacting region within the bHLH-PAS domain of RAC3 (Fig. 2 B). The bHLH-PAS domain of RAC3 was subdivided into bHLH, PAS-A, PAS-B, or PAS-A/B (Fig. 2 F) and tested for interactions with RS2.1 in a similar assay. As expected, none of these baits alone activated reporter expression (data not shown). Coexpression of RS2.1 with PAS-A/B or RAC3-N each strongly activated reporter expression, whereas coexpression with bHLH, PAS-A, or PAS-B did not activate reporter expression in this assay. These data suggest that the PAS-A and PAS-B domains are both required for strong interaction with RS2.1. To confirm the interaction of RS2.1/hMMS19 with RAC3 in vitro, we performed a GST pull-down assay using GST fusion of various RAC3 N-terminal fragments to pull down the35S-labeled RS2.1 fragment or the full-length hMMS19. The RS2.1 fragment and full-length hMMS19 were transcribed/translated and labeled with [35S]methionine in reticulocyte lysate. First, the 35S-RS2.1 probe was incubated with GST-RAC3-N, and the bound probe was eluted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As expected, GST-RAC3-N, but not GST alone, pulled down a significant amount of 35S-RS2.1 (Fig.2 C), confirming in vitro interaction of RS2.1 with RAC3-N. Second, 35S-hMMS19 was incubated with GST or GST fusion of bHLH, PAS-A, PAS-B, PAS-A/B, or the bHLH-PAS domain of RAC3. The bound hMMS19 probe was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 2 D). As expected, GST or GST-bHLH did not bring down a detectable amount of 35S-hMMS19. In contrast, GST-PAS-A or GST-PAS-B each pulled down a noticeable amount of 35S-hMMS19, suggesting that hMMS19 can interact weakly with PAS-A and PAS-B separately. Interestingly, GST-PAS-A/B pulled down a much more significant amount of 35S-hMMS19, suggesting a synergistic effect by PAS-A and PAS-B for binding hMMS19. GST-RAC3-N pulled down an amount of 35S-hMMS19 similar to that of GST-PAS-A/B, confirming that the bHLH region is not involved in the interaction. The other C-terminal RAC3 fragments, including the nuclear receptor-interacting domain and the transcriptional activation domain, showed no binding to hMMS19 (data not shown). Therefore, these data are consistent with the above yeast two-hybrid results in implicating the PAS-A/B domain of RAC3 as the binding surface for hMMS19. Because RAC3 interacts with nuclear receptors, we tested whether hMMS19 could interact with nuclear receptor in a similar GST pull-down assay. Intriguingly, we found that GST-RS2.1 pulled down a significant fraction (about 20% of input) of ERα in a ligand-independent manner (Fig. 3 A). Similarly, GST-RS2.1 also pulled down a significant amount of ERβ (Fig.3 B), suggesting that hMMS19 can interact with both ERα and ERβ. Similar results were obtained by GST fusion of full-length hMMS19 (data not shown), suggesting that the interaction also occur in the context of full-length protein. In contrast, little interactions of GST-RS2.1 with 35S-hRARα and hTRβ were detected, consistent with the yeast two-hybrid data. These data suggest that hMMS19 may also interact with ERα and ERβ. The above interactions of hMMS19 with RAC3 and ERs prompted us to investigate whether hMMS19 could modulate transcriptional activity of ER. To test this possibility, we performed reporter gene assay by transient transfection in HEK293 cells. First, we analyzed the effects of overexpression of RS2.1 on ER-mediated transcriptional activation of a luciferase reporter gene driven by ER-responsive elements (Fig.4, A and B). As expected, both ERα and ERβ strongly activated luciferase expression in an E2-dependent manner. Cotransfection with RS2.1 significantly reduced the ligand-dependent transactivation in a dose-dependent manner without affecting reporter expression in the absence of E2. We found that, at the highest concentration of RS2.1, both ERα and ERβ activities were reduced about 8-fold. Importantly, coexpression of RAC3 can reverse the inhibitory effect of RS2.1 on ER transcriptional activity (Fig.4 C). The inhibition of ER activity by RS2.1 is specific, for RS2.1 had no effect on an otherwise identical reporter lacking ER binding sites (data not shown). Furthermore, overexpression of RS2.1 had no effect on ligand-dependent transcriptional activation of RARα or TRβ (Fig. 4 D), suggesting that RS2.1 may selectively affect ER transcriptional activity. These data are consistent with the preferential interaction of RS2.1 with ERs but not with RARα or TRβ, implicating that hMMS19 may play a more important role in regulating ER activity than RAR or TR. The inhibition of ER transcriptional activity by RS2.1 may be explained by the dominant negative effect of RS2.1, because this fragment contains the RAC3/ER-interacting domain. It is possible that RS2.1 interferes with the assembly of a functional ER-coactivator complex. If RS2.1 indeed acts as a dominant negative mutant, the full-length protein should have a positive effect on ER transcriptional activity. Indeed, overexpression of hMMS19 enhanced ER transcription activation in HEK293 cells (Fig. 5 A). The moderate effect of this enhancement may be due to high levels of endogenous hMMS19 in these cells. In contrast, the hMMS19-mt mutant, which lacks the C-terminal interacting domain, failed to coactivate ER-mediated transcription. Furthermore, coexpression of hMMS19 with RAC3 enhanced ER transcriptional activation more strongly than the expression of each coactivator alone (Fig. 5 B), suggesting that hMMS19 and RAC3 may synergize to stimulate transcriptional activity of ER. The above findings suggest that hMMS19 may function as a transcriptional coactivator of ER. Intriguingly, the yeast MMS19 has been shown to regulate transcription by influencing TFIIH activity (38Lauder S. Bankmann M. Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6783-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and TFIIH has been shown to regulate the AF-1 function of human ERα (41Chen D. Riedl T. Washbrook E. Pace P.E. Coombes R.C. Egly J.M. Ali S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 127-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). To shed light on the mechanism of MMS19 function in regulating ER activity, we examined whether hMMS19 affects AF-1 or AF-2 activity of hERα. We subdivided ERα into the N-terminal AF-1 and the C-terminal AF-2 domains, each of which contains the DNA binding domain. The effect of overexpression of hMMS19 on the ERα AF-1 or ERα AF-2 was then tested by transient transfection (Fig.5 C). As expected, E2 strongly activated transcription mediated by the ERα AF-2 but to a lesser extent than the full-length ERα, suggesting that AF-1 is required for maximal transcriptional activity of ERα. Cotransfection of hMMS19 had no effect on this ligand-dependent transcriptional activity of ERα AF-2, suggesting that hMMS19 is not an AF-2-dependent coactivator. As expected, ERα AF-1 had a constitutive activity in the absence of ligand. Addition of E2 slightly enhanced the ERα AF-1 activity, presumably due to E2-mediated phosphorylation of the ERα AF-1 domain (28Tremblay A. Tremblay G.B. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 513-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 42Rogatsky I. Trowbridge J.M. Garabedian M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22296-22302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cotransfection of hMMS19 strongly enhanced AF-1 activation in both the absence and presence of E2 by 6.0- and 2.5-fold, respectively, suggesting that hMMS19 can regulate ER transcriptional activity by stimulating the N-terminal AF-1 function of ER. MMS19was initially identified in a yeast genetic screen for mutations that render cells sensitive to the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) (43Prakash L. Prakash S. Genetics. 1977; 86: 33-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and later to UV and DNA cross-linking agents (44Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 176: 351-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 45Miller R.D. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 939-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Analysis of MMS19 mutation in yeast suggests that it plays a role in nucleotide excision repair and transcription regulation by affecting TFIIH activity (38Lauder S. Bankmann M. Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6783-6793Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 46Prakash L. Prakash S. Ann. Ist. Super. Sanita. 1989; 25: 99-113PubMed Google Scholar, 47Prakash S. Prakash L. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Here, we isolated a human MMS19 homologue as a RAC3-interacting protein. Intriguingly, hMMS19 interacts with both the coactivator RAC3 and the receptor ER and functions as an AF-1-specific transcriptional coactivator of ER. The bHLH-PAS domain is the most conserved region in the SRC/p160 coactivators (14Li H. Gomes P.J. Chen J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8479-8484Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar); however, the function of this domain is largely unknown. The isolation of hMMS19 as a bHLH-PAS domain-interacting protein suggests that this domain may be involved in protein-protein interaction. Further analysis of the hMMS19-RAC3 interactions reveals that interaction is mediated through the PAS-A/B region. Interestingly, strong interaction occurs only in the presence of both PAS-A and PAS-B, suggesting that there may be two interacting interfaces that together stabilize the interaction between hMMS19 and RAC3. The involvement of PAS domain in protein-protein interaction can also be found in theDrosophila protein Period, which interacts with Timeless through its PAS domain (48Gekakis N. Saez L. Delahaye-Brown A.M. Myers M.P. Sehgal A. Young M.W. Weitz C.J. Science. 1995; 270: 811-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Because the PAS domain is highly conserved among the SRC/p160 coactivators, hMMS19 might also interact with SRC-1 and/or TIF2, but this remains to be tested. However, despite the conservation of PAS domains in different proteins, hMMS19 does not interact with the PAS domain of Sim, suggesting the different PAS domains may be involved with different interacting proteins. The interacting surface in hMMS19 maps to its C-terminal conserved domain. Structural prediction suggests that this region contains multiple potential amphipathic helices, which might mediate the interaction with the PAS domain of RAC3. Analysis of the interactions of hMMS19 with nuclear receptors shows strong binding with ERα and ERβ in a ligand-independent manner. Because ER also interacts with RAC3 (49Leo C. Li H. Chen J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5976-5982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), several possibilities may explain the relevance of these interactions. For instance, hMMS19 may interact with ER first in the absence of ligand. This interaction may modulate, for instance, the phosphorylation states of ER by targeting TFIIH activity to ER. Upon ligand binding, ER undergoes a conformational change that allows the receptor to bind the LXXLL motifs of RAC3 via a coactivator-binding pocket in the LBD (9Leo C. Chen J.D. Gene. 2000; 245: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). RAC3 then interacts with hMMS19 via the N-terminal PAS domain to stabilize the complex or to signal a subsequent event in transcription. Alternatively, RAC3 may form a complex with hMMS19 first, which is then recruited to the liganded receptor. It is clear that RAC3 uses separate domains for interactions with hMMS19 and liganded ER. However, it is currently unknown whether hMMS19 can interact with RAC3 and ER simultaneously. The fact that the C-terminal domain of hMMS19 interacts with both RAC3 and ER suggests that the interactions of hMMS19 with RAC3 and ERs may be mutually exclusive. However, it is equally possible that different motifs in the C-terminal domain of hMMS19 interact with RAC3 and ER independently. The physiological relevance of hMMS19 in ER signaling is demonstrated by overexpression of the C-terminal RS2.1 fragment and the full-length hMMS19, each of which significantly affect transcriptional activity of ER in transfection assays. Overexpression of RS2.1 inhibits ligand-dependent transcriptional activation of an ER reporter gene due to a dominant negative effect. Overexpression of RS2.1 has no effect on basal promoter activity in the absence of ligand, consistent with the observation that ER binds to chromatin in response to ligand (50Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar, 51Chen H. Lin R.J. Xie W. Wilpitz D. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 98: 675-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). As expected, the full-length hMMS19 enhances ligand-dependent transcription of the ER reporter gene, whereas the truncation mutant lacking the RAC3/ER-interacting domain has no effect on ER activity. Intriguingly, hMMS19 strongly enhances the AF-1 activity of ER in both the absence and presence of ligand and has no effect on the activity of a separated AF-2 domain. Therefore, we suggest that hMMS19 functions as an AF-1-specific coactivator of ER. Currently, only a few potential AF-1 coactivators were reported, such as the p68 RNA helicase (7Endoh H. Maruyama K. Masuhiro Y. Kobayashi Y. Goto M. Tai H. Yanagisawa J. Metzger D. Hashimoto S. Kato S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5363-5372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the mechanism of AF-1 coactivator is largely unknown. The human MMS19 is unique among other coactivators in that it interacts with both ERs and RAC3. Because hMMS19 interacts with the PAS domain of RAC3 and regulates AF-1 activity of ER, it is intriguing to speculate that the PAS domain of RAC3 may be important for regulating AF-1 function. However, the mechanisms by which AF-1 activates transcription and synergizes with AF-2 are largely unknown, and further study is required to fully understand the mechanism of transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors. Our finding that hMMS19 is an AF-1 coactivator that also interacts with AF-2 coactivator RAC3 suggests that hMMS19 may bridge the functions of AF-1 and AF-2. During preparation of this manuscript, another group reported that hMMS19 interacts directly with the XPD and XPB subunits of TFIIH, confirming a regulatory role of hMMS19 on TFIIH activity (8Seroz T. Winkler G.S. Auriol J. Verhage R.A. Vermeulen W. Smit B. Brouwer J. Eker A.P. Weeda G. Egly J.M. Hoeijmakers J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4506-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). TFIIH is a multiprotein complex consisting of nine subunits, each participating in transcription and nucleotide excision repair pathways. TFIIH harbors several enzymatic activities such as a DNA-dependent ATPase linked to XPD and XPB and a cdk-activating protein kinase, a cyclin-dependent kinase that phosphorylates the polymerase II C-terminal tail domain. Recently, it was shown that the AF-1 domain of hERα is phosphorylated by the TFIIH cyclin-dependent kinase in a ligand-dependent manner (41Chen D. Riedl T. Washbrook E. Pace P.E. Coombes R.C. Egly J.M. Ali S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 127-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was shown that phosphorylation of polymerase II C-terminal tail domain precedes the dissociation of ER/p160 coactivator complex from target promoters (50Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar). Therefore, the identification of hMMS19 as an ER- and RAC3-interacting protein suggests a novel mechanism by which TFIIH may be recruited to ER target promoters. In light of the important role of TFIIH in regulating the transcriptional activity of ER (41Chen D. Riedl T. Washbrook E. Pace P.E. Coombes R.C. Egly J.M. Ali S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 127-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), we suggest that hMMS19 might be involved in regulation of ER activity by bridging TFIIH with ER. Possibly, the interaction of hMMS19 with RAC3 might be involved in ligand-dependent recruitment of TFIIH to ER (41Chen D. Riedl T. Washbrook E. Pace P.E. Coombes R.C. Egly J.M. Ali S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 127-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Alternatively, hMMS19 might facilitate TFIIH-mediated phosphorylation of ER in specific promoters and cell types. In summary, we have identified and characterized the human homologue of the yeast DNA repair and TFIIH regulator MMS19 as an RAC3/ER-interacting protein. The human MMS19 interacts with the N-terminal PAS-A/B domain of RAC3 through an evolutionarily conserved C-terminal domain. Overexpression of hMMS19 modulates ER-mediated transcriptional activation by enhancing the AF-1 function of ER. These data reveal a novel function of hMMS19 as an AF-1-specific transcriptional coactivator of estrogen receptor.

Biochem. 1998; 67: 49-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Their substrates, nucleotide sugars, are synthesized in either the cytoplasm or the nucleus. These nucleotide sugars have to be delivered into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi apparatus by appropriate transporters before they are utilized by glycosyltransferases as substrates for glycoconjugate biosynthesis. The transporters are thus indispensable for this process. In fact, nucleotide sugar transporter deficiency leads to a pleiotropic aberration in cellular glycoproteins and glycolipids (3Hara T.

These transporters may also be involved in controlling the spectrum of glycoconjugates synthesized by a cell, by regulating the amounts of nucleotide sugars delivered into the Golgi lumen. We need to learn much more about the molecular basis of nucleotide sugar transporter function and its regulation to better understand the mechanisms and significance of transporter-mediated glycoconjugate control.

These transporters constitute a family of related membrane proteins that are localized in the Golgi apparatus and have similar hydropathy profiles. Regarding their structure, Eckhardt et al. (19Eckhardt M. Gotza B. Gerardy-Schahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8779-8787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) recently proposed a structure for murine CST in which there are 10 membrane-spanning segments (19Eckhardt M. Gotza B. Gerardy-Schahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8779-8787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We used an eight-transmembrane model for hUGT1 and hCST predicted by computer analysis in our previous reports (6Miura N. Ishida N. Hoshino M. Yamauchi M. Hara T. Ayusawa D. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1996; 120: 236-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 20Aoki K. Sun-Wada G.-H. Segawa H. Yoshioka S. Ishida N. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 126: 940-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, in this report we have adopted the 10-transmembrane model for both hUGT1 and hCST because of the high similarity between them and murine CST. This model provides a basic framework for discussions of structure-function relationships, but the structural basis of the specificity and mechanisms of nucleotide sugar transport remains largely obscure. We have recently started to construct and analyze a series of chimeras between human UGT1 (hUGT1) and human CST (hCST) proteins in order to define the structural basis of the specificity and function of nucleotide sugar transporters (20Aoki K. Sun-Wada G.-H. Segawa H. Yoshioka S. Ishida N. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 126: 940-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These two transporters show 43% identity in amino acid sequence, and have similar topological characteristics, although they transport quite different substrates. The replacement of the N-terminal or C-terminal cytoplasmic region of hUGT1 by the corresponding region of hCST did not destroy the UDP-Gal transporting activity (20Aoki K. Sun-Wada G.-H. Segawa H. Yoshioka S. Ishida N. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 126: 940-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Putative helices 9 and 10 of hUGT1 could also be replaced by those of hCST without loss of the UDP-Gal transporting activity. The above results indicated that the regions substituted in these chimeras were not critically involved in the determination of substrate specificity of hUGT1. However, further analysis of functionally important regions has been hampered because the stability of hUGT1 protein was markedly reduced when longer N- and C-terminal stretches were replaced by the corresponding hCST stretches. Moreover, our previous experimental procedures did not allow the assessment of the CST activity of chimeric transporters. In the present study, we first devised a convenient method for assessment of the CST activity, and then used this method to analyze the properties of a number of chimeric transporters. In the course of this analysis, we noticed that the hCST protein is more tolerant to replacements of stretches of the N or C terminus than hUGT1, and also found that hUGT1 is tolerant to replacements of internal segments by hCST counterparts. Analyses based on these findings allowed us to identify distinct submolecular segments that are critical for specific recognition of UDP-Gal and CMP-Sia, respectively. Chimeras containing both of these critical segments were expressed in the Golgi membranes, and transported both UDP-Gal and CMP-Sia. UDP-[6-3H]Gal (60Ci/mmol) and CMP-[9-3H]Sia (15Ci/mmol) were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Amino acid sequence alignment between hUGT1 and hCST is shown in Fig. 1. Crossover sites in chimeras, which are specified by alphabetical symbols a-j, are also indicated in the figure. All the chimeric constructs were sequenced to rule out PCR-induced mutations. Chimeras A1, A2, B1, B2, C1-C3, and D1-D3 (see Fig. 3) with a single crossing-over at a, b, c, d, j, i, h, j, h, and g (Fig. 1), respectively, were constructed as follows: chimeric cDNAs A1, C1, and C3, previously designated CU-0, UC-7, and UC-8, respectively, were constructed as described before (20Aoki K. Sun-Wada G.-H. Segawa H. Yoshioka S. Ishida N. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 126: 940-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), except that HA-tag was not attached to the chimeras. Other chimeras in the A- to D-series were constructed in a similar manner, using appropriately designed PCR primer sets. Briefly, N- and C-terminal hUGT1 and hCST segments with a terminal overlap at a desired internal crossover site were separately amplified by PCR using appropriate sets of primers. Two primers, one from each set, were complementary to each other to create the overlap at the crossover site. The PCR-amplified fragments were mixed to serve as the templates for a second PCR to amplify the desired full-length chimeric cDNA, using the two outside primers from the primer sets used in the first PCR. Chimeric cDNA from the second PCR was inserted into the mammalian expression vector pMKIT-neo as described before (20Aoki K. Sun-Wada G.-H. Segawa H. Yoshioka S. Ishida N. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 126: 940-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Chimeras E1-E3 and F1 (see Fig. 5) with two crossing-overs at c and h, c and g, c and f, and e and g (Fig. 1), respectively, were constructed as follows. E-series chimeras were constructed by ligating two restriction fragments derived from chimera B1 and appropriate D-series chimeras. For instance, chimera E1 was constructed from chimeras B1 and D2. B1 and D2 were cut with BstEII (at nucleotide number 354–360 of hCST) and NotI (at the 3′ terminus of the inserts), and the smaller fragment obtained from D2, containing the C-terminal half of the desired new chimera, was inserted into the larger fragment obtained from B1, containing the N-terminal half of the desired new chimera linked to the vector DNA. Chimera E2 was constructed in the same way, using chimera D3 instead of D2, and E3 was constructed using chimera D4 (1–194hCST/220–393hUGT1, not shown in the figure) instead of D2. Chimera F1 was constructed by the two-step PCR method outlined above in (i), using hUGT1 and chimera D3 as templates. Chimera G1 was constructed in three steps. First, chimera CU-2 (1–120hCST/145–393hUGT1) (20Aoki K. Sun-Wada G.-H. Segawa H. Yoshioka S. Ishida N. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 126: 940-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and chimera B1 were cut withEcoRI (at the 5′ terminus of the inserts) andBstEII, and the smaller fragment from CU-2 was inserted into the larger fragment from B1, to yield chimera G1-a (1–68hUGT1/46–120hCST/145–393hUGT1). Chimera G1-b (1–219hUGT1/195–237hCST/263–393hUGT1) was then constructed by the two-step PCR method using hUGT1 and chimera D3 as templates. Finally, G1-a and G1-b were cut with PstI (at nucleotide number 499–504 of hUGT1) and NotI, and the smaller fragment from G1-b was inserted into the larger fragment from G1-a, to yield chimera G1. The cDNAs encoding hUGT1, hCST, and chimera G1 were inserted into yeast inducible expression vector pYEX-BX (CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) (14Ishida N. Yoshioka S. Chiba Y. Takeuchi M. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 126: 68-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary cell (CHO) strain K1 and its derivatives, Lec2 (a CST-deficient mutant) (21Deutscher S.L. Nuwayhid N. Stanley P. Briles E.I. Hirschberg C.B. Cell. 1984; 39: 295-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and Lec8 (a UGT-deficient mutant) (22Deutscher S.L. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 96-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were cultured in minimum essential medium α supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (23Stanley P. Siminovitch L. Somatic Cell Genet. 1977; 3: 391-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 24Briles E.B. Li E. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1107-1116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The UGT activity of chimeric molecules was assessed essentially as described previously with slight modifications (20Aoki K. Sun-Wada G.-H. Segawa H. Yoshioka S. Ishida N. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 126: 940-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). UGT-deficient Lec8 cells were transfected with chimeric cDNAs using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD). The cells were then cultured for 1 day, transferred onto a chamber slide (Nalge Nunc International, Corp., Rochester, NY), incubated overnight, and then fixed with methanol at −20 °C for 6 min. The fixed cells were incubated with an appropriate primary antibody in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, and then incubated with a fluorescent secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were next washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and once with water, and then mounted with Permafluor (IMMUNOTECH, a Coulter Company, Marseilles, France). Staining with 20 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated GS-II (Griffonia simplicifolia lectin II; EY Laboratories, Inc., San Mateo, CA) was carried out either before the incubation of cells with a primary antibody, or simultaneously with the incubation with a secondary antibody. Fluorescence labeling was visualized under a Carl Zeiss laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSM510). The CST activity of chimeras was assessed by a similar method in which CST-deficient Lec2 cells and FITC-conjugated PNA (peanut agglutinin; EY Laboratories, Inc.) were used instead of Lec8 cells and GS-II, respectively. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain YPH500 (MATα/ura3–52/lys2–801/ade2–101/trp1-Δ63/his3-Δ200/leu2-Δ1) was cultured in a synthetic medium containing 0.67% (w/v) Bacto-yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and 2% (w/v) glucose (YNBD) supplemented with l-leucine, l-histidine,l-tryptophan, l-lysine, and adenine. Uracil was omitted for selection of transformants. Transformations were performed using the lithium acetate method (25Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionation was performed as described previously with slight modifications (14Ishida N. Yoshioka S. Chiba Y. Takeuchi M. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 126: 68-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 26Sun-Wada G.-H. Yoshioka S. Ishida N. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 123: 912-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured to a density of 0.8A 600 and cupric sulfate was added to the medium at a final concentration of 2 mm at 3 h before harvest. Cells were then harvested, washed twice with ice-cold 10 mm NaN3, resuspended in a spheroplast solution (1.4 m sorbitol, 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaN3, 40 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 2 mg of zymolyase-100T (SEIKAGAKU Corp., Tokyo, Japan) per g of packed cells, and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. The spheroplasts were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min, resuspended in 4 volumes of lysis buffer (0.8 m sorbitol, 10 mm HEPES-Tris (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), and homogenized with 10 strokes of mechanical shear using a Potter-type homogenizer. The lysate was centrifuged at 1,500 × gfor 10 min to remove unlysed cells and debris. The membrane fraction was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in lysis buffer. The protein concentrations were determined by using BCA reagent (Pierce Chemical, Rockford, IL). The in vitro transport assay was performed essentially as described before (26Sun-Wada G.-H. Yoshioka S. Ishida N. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 123: 912-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The reaction was started by addition of the membrane preparation (50 μg of protein) to the reaction mixture (0.8m sorbitol, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmdimercaptopropanol, 1 μm UDP-[3H]Gal or CMP-[3H]Sia (6,400 Ci/mol)). The mixture (100 μl) was incubated at 30 °C, diluted with 1 ml of ice-cold stop buffer (0.8m sorbitol, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 1 mm MgCl2, 1 μm nonradioactive UDP-Gal or CMP-Sia) to stop the reaction, and poured onto a nitrocellulose filter (0.45 μm; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The filter was washed 3 times with stop buffer and then dried. The radioactivity trapped on the filter was measured in toluene-based scintillator. Anti-hUGT1 and anti-hCST antibodies were prepared by immunizing rabbits with synthetic peptides representing the C-terminal amino acid sequences of each protein (377RGDLITEPFLPKSVLVK393 and321TSIQQGETASKERVIGV337 for hUGT1 and hCST, respectively) and affinity purified as described previously (27Yoshioka S. Sun-Wada G.-H. Ishida N. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 122: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 28Ishida N. Ito M. Yoshioka S. Sun-Wada G.-H. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 124: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). An Alexa 546 (a substitute for tetramethylrhodamine)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was used as the secondary antibody. In a previous study, we devised a simple method for analyzing the UGT activity of chimeric transporters (20Aoki K. Sun-Wada G.-H. Segawa H. Yoshioka S. Ishida N. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 126: 940-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Chimeric cDNAs were transiently expressed in UGT-deficient Lec8 cells, and the cells were examined under a microscope to determine whether they bound FITC-conjugated plant lectin GS-II. Since GS-II recognizes terminal GlcNAc residues, UGT-negative cells, which expose GlcNAc residues at the termini of surface glycoconjugates, bind GS-II, while UGT-positive cells, which have Sia residues at the termini of sugar chains, do not. Thus, if a chimeric molecule with UGT activity is expressed, the defect of Lec8 cells will be complemented, and the cells expressing the chimera will not bind GS-II. On the other hand, if a chimeric molecule does not have UGT activity, the cells expressing it will bind GS-II. A similar procedure was developed in the present study to assess the CST activity of chimeric proteins, utilizing CST-deficient Lec2 cells and FITC-conjugated PNA lectin. PNA recognizes terminal Gal residues that are exposed on the surfaces of CST-deficient cells. In Fig.2 A, we show the lectin-binding properties of parental CHO cells, CST-deficient Lec2 cells, and UGT-deficient Lec8 cells. FITC-conjugated GS-II was bound by Lec8 cells, but not by CHO or Lec2 cells. FITC-conjugated PNA was bound by Lec2 cells, but not by CHO or Lec8 cells. Fig. 2 B shows the results of a typical transient expression analysis in which Lec2 cells were transfected with the vector alone or the full-length cDNA encoding hCST. When the vector alone was introduced into the cells, hCST protein was not produced in the cells, and therefore, FITC-conjugated PNA stained the cells. On the other hand, when hCST cDNA was introduced, the cells expressing hCST protein, which were stained by the anti-hCST antibody (about 70% of the total population), were not stained by PNA. Transient expression of an active chimeric transporter would give a similar result to hCST/Lec2 in Fig.2 B, while PNA binding would persist if an expressed chimeric protein had no CST activity. Series of chimeras in which stretches of various lengths from the N terminus or C terminus of hUGT1 or hCST were replaced by the corresponding stretches of hCST or hUGT1, respectively, were constructed (Fig. 3). These chimeras were transiently expressed in Lec8 and Lec2 cells, and their UGT and CST activities as well as their expression and localization were assessed (Fig. 4). The UGT activity of a few of these chimeras (A1, C1, and C3) was described in one of our previous reports, but their CST activity was not assessed previously. These chimeras, and also chimeras A2 and C2, were found in this study to be unable to transport CMP-Sia (Fig. 4). Human UGT1 was rather sensitive to replacement of its putative transmembrane regions by their hCST counterparts, with only chimeras C2 and C3 being competent in transporting UDP-Gal among such chimeras. The fact that C3 was active in UDP-Gal transport implies that a contiguous hUGT1 stretch from the N terminus to the eighth helix is sufficient for the specific recognition of UDP-Gal as a transport substrate. Chimera A2 was constructed to assess the importance of helix 1 of hUGT1. The chimera was expressed in both Lec8 and Lec2 cells, and the products were sorted to the Golgi region, but showed no UGT or CST activity. This indicates that helix 1 of hUGT1 is indispensable for its activity and cannot be replaced by helix 1 of hCST. The importance of helix 8 of hUGT1 in UDP-Gal recognition could not be assessed previously because a chimera in which helices 1–7 and helices 8–10 were contributed by hUGT1 and hCST, respectively, was not sorted to the Golgi region (20Aoki K. Sun-Wada G.-H. Segawa H. Yoshioka S. Ishida N. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 126: 940-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We address this point in experiments described in the next section. The CST activity was much more tolerant to the replacement of its N- and C-terminal helices by hUGT1 sequences. Thus, helices 1 and 2 could be replaced by the corresponding hUGT1 sequences without loss of the CST activity (chimera B2). Similarly, chimera D3, in which helices 8 to 10 of hCST were substituted by the corresponding hUGT1 sequences, was expressed efficiently and was active in CMP-Sia transport. These results indicate that helix 1 of hUGT1 is critical for the recognition of UDP-Gal as a transport substrate, while its CST counterpart is not an absolute requirement for the specific recognition of CMP-Sia. This implies that different submolecular regions are involved in the process of specific recognition of UDP-Gal and CMP-Sia. Analysis of chimeras with two crossovers as described below further substantiated this point. We constructed chimeras E1 to E3 and F1, in which internal transmembrane helices of hUGT1 were replaced by the corresponding helices of hCST (Fig. 5 A), and examined the expression and nucleotide sugar transporting activities of the chimeric proteins. Every chimera was expressed in transfected cells, and definitely showed either or both UGT and CST activities. Chimeras E1 and E2 exhibited CST activity, while chimera E3 did not. These results indicate that the presence of hCST helices 2 to 7 in the hUGT1 context is sufficient for the specific recognition of CMP-Sia, and strongly suggest that helix 7 of hCST is important in this recognition process. The loss of the CST activity of chimera F1 due to the replacement of helices 2 and 3 by their hUGT1 counterparts suggests that these helices are also important for the CST activity. To show the importance of these helices more clearly, we next constructed chimera G1, in which the segments containing helices 2, 3, and 7 were derived from hCST sequences in the context of hUGT1. This chimera also possessed dual substrate specificity, i.e. it exhibited both UGT and CST activities. Thus, introduction of helices 2, 3, and 7 of hCST into the hUGT1 context was sufficient for the chimeric transporter to recognize CMP-Sia. In contrast to hCST, which was tolerant of replacement of its N and C termini by hUGT1 sequences, hUGT1 was rather tolerant to substitution of internal helices by their hCST counterparts. Some chimeras with internal hCST stretches in the hUGT1 context, including chimeras E2 and E3, were able to complement the genetic defect of Lec8 cells, and therefore were active in UDP-Gal transport. Only chimera E1 was devoid of UGT activity among the E-series chimeras. Comparison of the structures of E1 and E2 strongly suggested that helix 8 of hUGT1 significantly contributes to the specific recognition of UDP-Gal. To directly demonstrate that chimera G1 transporter is dually specific for UDP-Gal and CMP-Sia, we examined the substrate specificity of the chimeric transporter in vitro, using a yeast expression system. The cDNAs encoding hUGT1, hCST, and chimera G1 were inserted into a yeast expression vector. The plasmids were transfected into yeast cells and transformants were obtained. The membrane vesicles were prepared from the transformants and the UDP-[3H]Gal and CMP-[3H]Sia transporting activities were determined. Fig. 6 shows the time course of uptake of each nucleotide sugar. The UGT activity of chimera G1 was lower than that of hUGT1, but was definitely higher than that of blank membrane vesicles obtained from the vector DNA transformant. The CST activity of chimera G1 was nearly as high as that of hCST. This clearly indicates that the chimeric protein is able to transport both UDP-Gal and CMP-Sia. It might be argued that chimera G1 may have been rendered simply nonselective for a number of nucleotide sugars, instead of being specific for both UDP-Gal and CMP-Sia. To distinguish between these possibilities, we next examined the substrate specificity of chimera G1 using this in vitro transport system (Fig.7). CMP-Sia uptake was determined in the presence of excess amounts of various nonradiolabeled nucleotide sugars. If the chimera can transport nucleotide sugars other than CMP-Sia, the additions of those nucleotide sugars would inhibit CMP-Sia uptake by competition. Fig. 7 shows that CMP-Sia uptake of chimera G1 was substantially inhibited by UDP-Gal, but not by addition of nucleotide sugars other than UDP-Gal, such as UDP-GlcNAc, UDP-glucose, UDP-xylose, and GDP-Man. This indicates that chimera G1 is specific for the two nucleotide sugars, UDP-Gal and CMP-Sia, rather than nonselective for a number of nucleotide sugars. It should be noted that the CMP-Sia transporting activity of hCST was not affected at all by UDP-Gal. Our previous studies of modified human and murine UGTs revealed that the N- and C-terminal cytoplasmic loops could be substituted by their CST counterparts, or could even be deleted, without loss of the UDP-Gal transporting activity. We also showed that helices 9 and 10 of hUGT1 could be replaced by the corresponding hCST helices (9Ishida N. Yoshioka S. Iida M. Sudo K. Miura N. Aoki K. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 126: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 20Aoki K. Sun-Wada G.-H. Segawa H. Yoshioka S. Ishida N. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 126: 940-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In a further attempt to define the submolecular regions of hUGT1 critical for the specific recognition of UDP-Gal, we have shown in the present study that the substitution of helix 1 of hUGT1 by that of hCST in chimera A2 led to the loss of UGT function without affecting the Golgi localization of the protein. This indicates the indispensability of this helix for the recognition of UDP-Gal. It was also demonstrated that the single substitution of helix 8 of hUGT1 in chimera E1 by its hCST counterpart in E2 abolished the UGT activity of the latter chimera, although the protein was expressed and localized in the Golgi region. These results strongly suggest that both helices 1 and 8 of hUGT1 are necessary for the recognition of UDP-Gal as a transport substrate. On the other hand, assessment of the CST activity of hUGT1/hCST chimeras led to the conclusion that introduction of helices 2, 3, and 7 of hCST into the hUGT1 context was sufficient to elicit CST activity. The fact that chimeras E2 and G1 are competent in transporting both UDP-Gal and CMP-Sia is an important finding. The dual specificity of G1 was confirmed directly by transport measurements using membrane vesicles prepared from yeast cells expressing chimera G1 protein. The dual specificity indicates that different submolecular regions are critically important for specific recognition of the two different substrates, UDP-Gal and CMP-Sia. Moreover, the presence of a region that recognizes one substrate does not disturb the functioning of another region that is specific for the other substrate. The simplest assumption underlying analyses of chimeras between two related proteins would be that a single set of submolecular regions, occupying corresponding sites in two proteins, is responsible for defining a given property, e.g. substrate specificity, peculiar to each protein. If this assumption is valid, then swapping of the set of submolecular regions would lead to switching of the particular property in question, such as substrate specificity. This was indeed the case with chimeras between two Na+-dependent nucleoside transporters, N1 and N2, of rats. In this case, pyrimidine-selective N2 was converted to a purine-selective transporter by replacing its eighth and ninth helices with those of N1 (29Wang J. Giacomini K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28845-28848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). On the other hand, this assumption was not valid for nucleotide sugar transporters, since swapping of a particular submolecular region between hUGT1 and hCST did not lead to switching of substrate specificity from one nucleotide sugar to the other. Instead, a chimeric UDP-Gal/CMP-Sia transporter was created by the combination of submolecular regions of the two parent transporter molecules. The mechanisms underlying the differential recognition of specific substrates by nucleotide sugar transporters must be more complicated than we assumed at the beginning of the present study. Chimeric transporters such as E2 and G1, which are dually specific for UDP-Gal and CMP-Sia, should be very helpful for achieving an understanding of these mechanisms. Some pertinent questions include: 1) to what extent do the binding sites of UDP-Gal and CMP-Sia overlap in the dually specific chimeric transporters? 2) How many and which helices are actually involved in constructing the whole specific substrate-binding sites and the transport channel? 3) Which nucleotide, UMP or CMP, serves as a countersubstrate in the nucleotide sugar-nucleoside monophosphate antiport reaction? We are currently trying to answer these questions. Nucleotide sugar transporters have been widely considered to be highly specific for a single nucleotide sugar substrate. This appears true for the transporters so far cloned and characterized, namely UGT, CST, and UDP-GlcNAc transporter (14Ishida N. Yoshioka S. Chiba Y. Takeuchi M. Kawakita M. J. Biochem.

However, earlier analyses of the nucleotide sugar transporting activity in the endoplasmic reticulum membranes suggested the possibility that there is a transport system active with multiple nucleotide sugar substrates (30Bossuyt X. Blanckaert N. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Construction of a dual specific hUGT1/hCST chimera clearly demonstrated that such a possibility is a real one. Further studies on dual specific chimeras should help us to understand the mode of action and physiological significance of naturally occurring dual specific nucleotide sugar transporters."
https://openalex.org/W1978986568,"The 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (Dhcr7) is the terminal enzyme in the pathway of cholesterol biosynthesis. We have previously reported that sterol depletion in vivo caused a significant induction of both liver mRNA and enzyme activity of Dhcr7 (Bae, S.-H., Lee, J. N., Fitzky, B. U., Seong, J., and Paik, Y.-K. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 14624–14631). In this paper, we also observed liver cell-specific sterol-mediated Dhcr7 gene induction in vitro by sterol depletion in rat hepatoma cells, suggesting the presence of sterol-mediated regulatory elements in the Dhcr7 gene. To understand the mechanisms responsible for regulating Dhcr7 expression, we have isolated the 5′-flanking region of the gene encoding rat Dhcr7 and have characterized the potential regulatory elements of the gene that are responsible for sterol-mediated regulation. The Dhcr7 promoter contains binding sites for Sp1 (at −177, −172, −125, and −20), NF-Y (at −88 and −51), and SREBP-1 or ADD1 (at −33). Deletion analysis of the Dhcr7 gene promoter (−1053/+31), employing a nested series of Dhcr7-luciferase constructs, demonstrated that the −179 upstream region of the gene is necessary and sufficient for optimal efficient sterol-regulated transcription. DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that the SRE1/E box (−33/−22) involved in sterol response of many sterol-related enzyme genes was protected specifically by the overexpressed recombinant ADD1. Mutational analysis for the functional relationship between the identified cis-elements in this region indicate that one of the binding sites for Sp1 (GC box at −125) and NF-Y (CCAAT box at −88) plays a cooperative role in the sterol-mediated activation, in which the latter site also acts as a co-regulator for SREBP-activated Dhcr7 promoter activity. We believe that Dhcr7 is the first enzyme characterized with a sterol-regulatory function in the post-lanosterol pathway. This may be important for understanding the coordinated control of cholesterol biosynthesis as well as the molecular mechanism of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome-related protein in mammals.

However, molecular cloning and the nature of sterol-mediated transcriptional control of the Dhcr7 gene in any species have not been reported previously. Furthermore, the relative importance of multiple motifs at the 5′-flanking region in transcriptional regulation of the Dhcr7 gene is also not known. In order to characterize the 5′-flanking region and the response of multiple regulatory elements to sterols, we isolated the 5′-flanking region of the rat Dhcr7 gene and the complete genomic sequence (GenBankTM accession numberAF279892). 2J. N. Lee, S.-H. Bae, and Y.-K. Paik, submitted for publication.2J. N. Lee, S.-H. Bae, and Y.-K. Paik, submitted for publication. In this paper, we describe the promoter activity and the sterol-mediated regulation of this gene by various mutation analyses, with emphasis on the proximal promoter (−179 to +1), which controls transcriptional induction of the gene in response to starvation of cellular sterols.

RNA was isolated by phenol-chloroform extraction using TRI reagent Kit (Molecular Research Center Inc.). Total RNA (20 μg) was electrophoresed in a 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel and vacuum-transferred to Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with 20 × SSC (150 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0). After prehybridization of the membranes at 42 °C for 5 h in 5 × SSC, 10 × Denhardt's solution, 100 μg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA, the membranes were hybridized to32P-labeled rat Dhcr7 cDNA probe for 18 h. Then the membranes were washed with 0.1% SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Hybridization signals were visualized by autoradiography using Hyper x-ray film with an intensifying screen at −70 °C. The signals that appeared in the membranes were quantitatively analyzed with a BAS 2500 system (Fuji Photo Film Co.) and normalized to the quantity of β-actin mRNA expression. At the initial stage of this work, rat Dhcr7 promoter was amplified from DNA provided in the rat Promoter FinderTMDNA walking kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primer r7R-9 (+49 ∼ +28) 5′-GCGTGCGGGATCCGGGCGGTTG-3′, corresponding to the cDNA for rat Dhcr7, and anchor primer AP1 of the promoter finder kit were used in the primary PCR. The primary PCR products were diluted and used for the secondary PCR with nested primer r7R-48 (+31 ∼ +7) 5′-GTTGATTCCAAGCTCCAGCAGCGCC-3′ in the 5′ region of Dhcr7 and anchor primer AP2. Secondary PCR products were cloned into pT7Blue(R)-T vector and sequenced with an ABI automated DNA sequencing system. The cloned Dhcr7 promoter region was also confirmed by data obtained from genomic clone sequencing. To analyze Dhcr7 promoter, the 5′-flanking region of the gene was ligated into the luciferase reporter vector as follows. The parent plasmid, p7R1084, was constructed by Klenow enzyme treatment of a DNA fragment (NdeI/EcoRI) spanning −1053 to +31 nucleotides, followed by insertion into the SmaI site of the luciferase vector pGL3-Basic (Promega). Plasmid p7R1084 (−1053/+31) was digested with NheI and PvuII to remove the 5′-fragment (NheI/PvuII) of the Dhcr7 insert, and religated after treatment with T4 DNA polymerase to produce p7R537 (−506/+31). In the same manner, p7R1084 was digested with PstI,BstXI, and ApaI, and religated to produce p7R318 (−287/+31), p7R210 (−179/+31), and p7R148 (−117/+31), respectively. Plasmid p7R164 (−133/+31) and p7R72 (−41/+31) were generated by cloning PCR products obtained by using appropriate synthetic oligonucleotides into a SmaI-digested pGL3-Basic vector. The truncated chimeric plasmid p7R287-117 was prepared by inserting a 171-bp PstI/ApaI fragement of p7R1084 into aSmaI-digested pGL3-Basic vector. All luciferase reporter genes except p7R287-117 had the same 3′ end in a SmaI site of pGL3-Basic and varying 5′ ends. All plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. The various mutant constructs were generated by PCR using the wild type Dhcr7 promoter DNA as a template with Pfu polymerase and mutagenic oligonucleotides designed to introduce each specific multibase point mutation. The mutated Dhcr7 promoter constructs were designated as M1 to M14. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used for the mutation of the different parts of the Dhcr7 promoter are shown below, with the mutated sequences in bold: SRE/m (−46/−18); 5′-GTAGTCTGTGACCAGTAATCACCTGGGGG-3′, E box/m (−46/−18); 5′-GTAGTCTGTGACCTCACGTCACTACGGGG-3′, SRE·E box/m (−46/−18); 5′-GTAGTCTGTGACCAGTAATCACTACGGGG-3′, ADD/m (−46/−18); 5′-GTAGTCTGTTCCCAGTAATTCGTACGGGG-3′, NFY/m (−64/−33); 5′-GAAATCCACTTCGGAGATCTAGTCTGTGACCT-3′, GC1·2/m (−191/−156); 5′-GTCCCCAGGGGCGTGGGATGGTTGGGGCTGGCCCTG-3′, CCAAT/m (−100/−69); 5′-GCTCACTGCCTTCAGATCTCACAGGGCGCGG-3′, GC3/m (−135/−109); 5′-GCCGCCGACTGTATTGCCCGGTGGGCT-3′, GC4/m (−29/−3); 5′-GTCACCTGGGTTGAGTGCTTCAGGCAG-3′, SRE/m1 (−46/−18); 5′-GTAGTCTGTGACCTCACGTTCGCTGGGGG-3′, SRE/m2 (−46/−18); 5′-GTAGTCTGTGACCAGTAATTCGCTGGGGG-3′. The PCR reaction products were digested with restriction enzymes and inserted into the luciferase vector pGL3-Basic. The DNA sequence of each mutant clone was confirmed by sequencing. HepG2, CHO-K1, and H4IIE cells were grown in RPMI medium 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% (v/v) FBS, 1 mm glutamine, and 10 μg/ml gentamycin in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Cells plated onto 6-well plates were grown to 50–70% confluence before transfection. Two μg of test constructs were co-transfected into HepG2 cells with 0.2 μg of Renilla luciferase control vector, pRL-SV40 (Promega). Each plasmid containing Dhcr7 promoter-luciferase fusion gene and 2.0 μl of Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies) was diluted into 80 μl of Opti-MEM I (Life Technologies). Plasmid DNA and Lipofectin reagent were then combined and added to each plate according to the Lipofectin manufacturer recommendations. The cells were transfected on serum-free media for 18 h and then were switched to a medium with 5% LPDS plus 10 μm Lovastatin (designated as sterol starvation condition) or 1.5 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol (designated as sterol rich condition). After incubation for 48 h, with the appropriate medium, cells were harvested, and extracts were assayed for luciferase activity (see below for details). Following transfection and drug treatment, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.5 ml of 1 × passive lysis buffer (Promega). Cell extracts were assayed forFirefly and Renilla luciferase activities using the Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay SystemTM according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Promega). Amounts of lysates employed for the Firefly luciferase activity assays of test constructs were normalized to the Renilla luciferase activities. 32P-Labeled DNA probes (−258/+41) were prepared from Dhcr7 gene and incubated with 0.2 or 2 μg of purified ADD1 protein in Buffer A (10 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 4 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC)) at room temperature for 30 min in a total volume of 20 μl. At the end of the reaction, 80 μl of a solution containing 3 mm CaCl2 and 6 mmMgCl2 was added the mixture. After digestion with DNase I, the DNA samples were extracted by a phenol/chloroform solution and electrophoresed on a 6% sequencing gel with a same end-labeled sequencing ladder. Recombinant ADD1 (amino acid residues 284 to 403 including the bHLH-LZ domain) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified from the culture extracts as described previously (24Kim J.B. Spotts G.D. Halvorsen Y.D. Shih H.M. Ellenberger T. Towle H.C. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2582-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Rat hepatoma H4IIE cell nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Dignamet al. (25Dignam J.D. Levovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were quantified by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) and stored at −70 °C. For EMSA, annealed oligonucleotide probes were 5′-end labeled using [γ-32P]ATP by T4-ploynucleotide kinase. Binding reactions were carried out in Buffer A in the presence of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Approximately 0.1 pmol of the labeled probe was mixed with 2–6 μg of nuclear extract or 10–100 ng of recombinant ADD1 in 20 μl, then incubated for 30 min at room temperature. EMSA was performed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel with 0.5 × TBE buffer (40 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA) and processed for autoradiography. For binding competition assays, 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides were added before the addition of labeled probe. The DNA sequence of oligonucleotides used were as follows: ADD (ADD1-binding site of Dhcr7 promoter), 5′-GTAGTCTGTGACCTCACGTCACCTGGGGG-3′; GC3 (Sp1-binding site of Dhcr7 promoter), 5′-CGCCGACTGGCGGGCCCGGTGG-3′; CCAAT1 (NF-Y-binding site of Dhcr7 promoter), 5′-CTGCCTTCACCAATCACAGGGC-3′; GC-box (Sp1-binding site), 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′; CCAAT box (NF-Y binding site), 5′-GTGATCAGCCAATCAGAGCGAG-3′; ABS (ADD1-binding site: E box), 5′-GATCCTGATCACGTGATCGAGGAG-3′; and SRE-1, 5′-GATCCTGATCACCCCACTGAGGAG-3′. We have previously reported (4Bae S.-H. Lee J.N. Fitzky B.U. Seong J. Paik Y.-K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14624-14631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) that when rats were maintained on a sterol starvation condition by feeding CL-diet (5% (w/w) cholestyramine plus 0.1% (w/w) Lovastatin in chow) for 14 days, both hepatic mRNA expression and the specific enzyme activity of Dhcr7 were increasedin vivo about 3- and 5-fold, respectively. To examine if this type of sterol-mediated Dhcr7 induction can also be seen in cultured cells in vitro, Northern blot analysis was performed using Dhcr7 mRNA obtained from H4IIE cells and CHO-K1 cells that had been maintained in either FBS or LPDS medium. As shown in Fig. 1 A, mRNA from the Dhcr7 gene was specifically induced more than 3-fold in H4IIE cells (hepatic cells). However, this induction by sterol depletion was seen only slightly in CHO-K1 cells (non-hepatic cells). Dhcr7 mRNA was highly inducible in a dose-dependent manner when cells were grown under sterol starvation conditions, where cells were treated with the two cholesterogenic enzyme inhibitors, AY-9944 (Dhcr7 inhibitor) and Lovastatin (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor) (Fig. 1, B and C). In contrast to this observation, the Dhcr7 gene was suppressed by treatment of cells with 25-hydroxycholesterol (Fig. 1 D). These results predicted sterol-mediated regulatory sequences in the Dhcr7 gene. To test this possibility, we isolated and analyzed the 5′-flanking region of this gene in detail. A 1.1-kilobase upstream fragment of the putative transcription initiation site from the rat genomic clone was isolated, sequenced, and analyzed to identify several cis-acting regulatory elements. The transcription initiation site was previously determined.2 The nucleotide sequence (1,053 bp), including exon 1, its 5′-flanking region, and part of intron 1, is shown (Fig. 2). The proximal region (−179 to +1) is 67% G + C and contains several well known transcription factor binding sites (Fig. 2). These are four GC boxes binding to Sp1 (−177/−172 (GC1), −172/−167 (GC2), −125/−121 (GC3), and −20/−15(GC4)), two CCAAT boxes binding to NF-Y (−88/−81 (CCAAT1) and −51/−45 (inverted, CCAAT2)) and an SRE1/E box binding to SREBP-1 or ADD1 (−33/−22). These regulatory sites are regarded as typical motifs seen in several genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis (26Bennett M.K. Ngo T.T. Athanikar J.N. Rosenfeld J.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol.

There was no TATA box within the promoter region of the Dhcr7, implying the presence of multiple transcription start sites as previously demonstrated.2 The transcription start site by the longest 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends product is located at an adenine (A) residue, which is 307 bp away from the ATG codon in Dhcr7 cDNA2 (Fig. 2). Therefore, Dhcr7 gene transcription appears to be driven by a TATA-less GC-rich promoter. This 5′-flanking region of the Dhcr7 promoter (−1053 to +1) also contains other well characterized regulatory elements that may control expression of this gene. These include two AP-1 (−454/−449 and −130/−125), four AP-4 (−510/−505, −290/−284, −167/−162, and −103/−98), NF-1 (−422/−417), NFAT (−555/−550), and SRY (−521/−516) binding sites. There are many IK2 and MZF-1-binding sites in the Dhcr7 promoter and part of intron 1. With regard to sterol-mediated regulation, we have focused on the proximal region (−179/+1) for further analysis on Dhcr7 gene transcription. To identify the transcriptional regulatory regions in rat Dhcr7 gene and to determine whether this region is regulated by exogenous sterols, a nested series of fragments containing various lengths of the 5′-flanking region, together with a part of the first exon (+31 out of 52 bp) were generated by either PCR or restriction endonuclease digestion. The parental plasmid used for this study was designated as p7R1084, spanning nucleotides −1053 to +31. Each deletion construct was prepared by inserting DNA fragments of various lengths into the luciferase gene and then analyzed for promoter activity using a transient assay system, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These deletion constructs were transfected into HepG2 cells and their luciferase activities measured following treatment with sterols (Fig.3). To normalize activity in different transfected cells, we co-transfected the cells with pRL-SV40, a non sterol-regulated Renilla luciferase expression vector. Results were expressed as “-fold” activation by taking the ratio of the luciferase activities after sterol starvation (−sterol) or sterol supplemented (+sterol) conditions. For the analysis of the regulation of the Dhcr7 promoter, HepG2 cells were chosen due to their relatively high transfection efficiency (>30-fold) as compared with that of H4IIE cells (data not shown). The promoter activity of the longest fragment, beginning at −1053 (p7R1084), was set at 100% for the results obtained from HepG2 cells in 5% LPDS (plus 10 μmLovastatin; sterol starvation condition). The basal promoter activity was set at the luciferase activity of p7R72 (−41/+31). As shown in Fig. 3, the promoter activity of the parent construct (p7R1084) was decreased more than 11-fold when sterol (1.5 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol) was added into the LPDS media, confirming the presence of sterol-mediated regulatory elements such as the SRE1/E box located at −33/−22 in the 5′-flanking region (Fig. 2). Deletion of regions spanning nucleotides −1053 and −133 (p7R537, p7R318, p7R210, and p7R164) caused no significant change in either promoter activity or sterol-mediated activation of Dhcr7 promoter activity. However, deletion of nucleotides between −133 and −117 caused almost a 3.5-fold reduction in both the promoter activity relative to the −133 region and the sterol-mediated activation. That is, there was a change in the magnitude of sterol-mediated activation between these two constructs (−133/+31 (13.6-fold) versus −117/+31 (4.0-fold)). This result suggests the presence of positivecis-acting sequences in this region (−133 and −117), which seems sensitive to the absence of sterol. This is further confirmed by the fact that the deletion constructs, p7R148 (−117/+31) and p7R72 (−41/+31), almost abolished a sterol-mediated activation (∼4.0 to ∼2.9-fold). Therefore, it appears that the two tandem repeat GC boxes at −177 (GC1) and −172 (GC2) are less important than other proximal GC boxes (e.g. GC3) for Dhcr7 promoter activity in response to sterols. Addition of the fragment containing sterol-regulated regions which enhanced activity (−287/−117) of the reporter gene itself (pGL3-Basic vector; e.g. p7R287–117), exhibited much lower luciferase activity in the absence of sterol than that of basal promoter construct, suggesting the absence of promoter activity in this sequence. A similar pattern of expression was also observed for these constructs when they were transfected into either CHO-K1 cells or H4IIE cells (Fig. 4). Therefore, we have focused on nucleotides spanning −287 to +31 (p7R318 showed the highest activity on sterol depletion conditions) in the 5′-flanking region of the rat Dhcr7 gene for further analysis of sterol response.Figure 4Comparison of promoter activities of fusion genes containing varying lengths of the Dhcr7 promoter in HepG2, H4IIE, and CHO-K1. Cells were co-transfected with one of the chimeric genes p7R1084, p7R537, p7R318, p7R210, p7R164, p7R148, p7R72, or p7R287-117 and with a pRL-SV40 plasmid for an internal control. Cells were maintained in LPDS-containing media in the presence of 10 μm Lovastatin. Relative luciferase activities were determined as a ratio of luciferase activity of each sample to the activity of Renilla luciferase and were normalized to 100 for p7R1084 in all cells. The relative activity of p7R1084 in HepG2 was 1.4 and 3.8 times higher than in H4IIE and CHO-K1 cells.

If so, subtle differences in the nucleotide structure may have pronounced effects on rotation. Here we show by single-molecule imaging that purine nucleotides ATP, GTP, and ITP support rotation but pyrimidine nucleotides UTP and CTP do not, suggesting that the extra ring in purine is indispensable for proper operation of this molecular motor. Although the three purine nucleotides were bound to the enzyme at different rates, all showed similar rotational characteristics: counterclockwise rotation, 120° steps each driven by hydrolysis of one nucleotide molecule, occasional back steps, rotary torque of ∼40 piconewtons (pN)·nm, and mechanical work done in a step of ∼80 pN·nm. These latter characteristics are likely to be determined by the rotational mechanism built in the protein structure, which purine nucleotides can energize. With ATP and GTP, rotation was observed even when the free energy of hydrolysis was −80 pN·nm/molecule, indicating ∼100% efficiency.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The Fo portion of the enzyme resides in the membrane and mediates proton translocation. The F1 portion, consisting of α3β3γ1δ1ε1subunits, is external to the membrane and catalyzes ATP synthesis. The ATP synthase is a completely reversible molecular machine in that ATP hydrolysis in F1 can produce a reverse flow of protons through Fo. Isolated F1 only catalyzes ATP hydrolysis and hence is called F1-ATPase. Its minimal, stable subcomplex capable of ATP hydrolysis is α3β3γ (2Matsui T. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For the coupling between the proton flow in Fo and the chemical reaction (ATP synthesis/hydrolysis) in F1, Boyer and Kohlbrenner (3Boyer P.D. Kohlbrenner W.E. Selman B.R. Selman-Reimer S. Energy Coupling in Photosynthesis. Elsevier, Amsterdam1981: 231-240Google Scholar) and Oosawa and Hayashi (4Oosawa F. Hayashi S. Adv. Biophys. 1986; 22: 151-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) independently suggested a rotational catalysis model. The essence is that Fo is a rotary motor (or turbine) driven by the proton flow, that F1 is another rotary motor driven by ATP hydrolysis, and that the two motors have a common rotary shaft, yet their genuine rotary directions are opposite to each other's. Rotation of the shaft in Fo's genuine direction, as occurs in cells, results in the reverse rotation of the F1 motor and thus in ATP synthesis in F1. When F1 gains control and hydrolyzes ATP, protons are pumped through Fo in the reverse direction. A crystal structure of F1 (5Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar) strongly supported the rotation model and has inspired many experiments, which, together, have proved that the γ subunit is (part of) the common rotor shaft and that α3β3 subunits, which surrounded γ in the crystal, are the stator in the F1 motor (6Aggeler R. Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9185-9191Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 7Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Single-molecule imaging of F1, in particular, has revealed that the γ subunit rotates in a unique direction consistent with the crystal structure, that γ makes discrete 120° steps, and that the energy conversion efficiency of the F1 motor driven by ATP hydrolysis can reach ∼100% (9Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar, 10Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). The precise mechanism of rotation, however, is not yet clear. In Boyer's model, binding changes play the major role (1Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). On the three β subunits, each of which hosts a catalytic site, ATP and its hydrolysis products, ADP and Pi, are in equilibrium. Thus, in the absence of an external energy supply, the change in free energy associated with ATP hydrolysis should manifest as the higher affinity for ATP than for ADP and Pi. During ATP synthesis, the mechanical energy supplied by the γ rotation driven by F0somehow decreases the affinity for ATP (and probably increases the affinity for ADP and Pi), resulting in the appearance of ATP in the medium. In the reverse reaction of ATP hydrolysis, the free energy difference between the stronger ATP binding and weaker ADP/Pi binding drives the rotation of γ. Boyer proposes that these binding changes occur sequentially on the three catalytic sites, synchronously with the γ rotation. In the crystal structure of F1 (5Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar), the three β subunits carried a different nucleotide, an analog of ATP, ADP, and none, in support of the sequential binding change mechanism. If binding and release, rather than the cleavage of the terminal phosphate, are indeed the source of mechanical torque production in the F1 motor, the rotational characteristics are expected to differ among different NTPs. The free energy gain in overall hydrolysis is similar among NTPs, but the operation of the F1 motor, which can work at near 100% efficiency, may well depend on delicate energy balances in various steps of hydrolysis. Here we show that purine but not pyrimidine nucleotides support F1 rotation, suggesting that the interaction between the catalytic site and the additional ring in purines is critical to the proper operation of this molecular machine. Nucleotides (GTP, ITP, UTP, and CTP) were purchased from Sigma. ATP and other enzymes were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The purity of each nucleotide was assessed on an anion exchange column. Nucleotides were applied on DEAE 2SW (Tosoh, Japan) equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and eluted with an isocratic flow of the same buffer. Because DEAE 2SW has higher affinity for compounds with more negative charges, nucleotides are eluted in the order of nucleoside mono-, di-, and triphosphate. The elution profiles for UTP are shown in Fig.1, a and b. Besides the UDP peak at 13 ml (identical with the peak for commercial UDP), several contaminant peaks (C1–C5) were resolved. The void peak at 4 ml is unlikely to be a nucleotide(s), because A 260(green) and A 280 (red), within an absorbance peak of a nucleotide, were extremely low compared with A 220 (blue). C1 at 7 ml was probably UMP, because it was eluted earlier, and the relative magnitudes of A 220, A 260and A 280 were the same as those for UTP and UDP. C4 was judged as contaminating GTP, because its elution volume and the relative magnitudes of A 220,A 260, and A 280 all matched with those for GTP (Fig. 1c). The GTP contamination amounted to 0.01% of UTP, as determined from the peak area ofA 260. The other contaminants, C2, C3, and C5, were of unknown origin; their signatures did not match with those of ATP, GTP, ITP, dATP, or their diphosphates. C2, C3, and C5 in UTP amounted to 0.03, 0.01, and 0.39%, respectively. Although the levels of contaminants were low, they may nevertheless affect the rotation assay, because the affinity of F1-ATPase for UTP is extremely low (see “Results”). We therefore used the fraction at the UTP peak (23 ml) for the rotation assay. CTP was also found to be contaminated by unknown compounds (1.5%); thus, its peak fraction was used for the rotation assay. ATP, GTP, and ITP contained less than 5% contaminants, which were mostly their hydrolysis products; these were used without purification. The α3β3γ subcomplex (β-His tag/γS107C) of F1 derived from thermophilicBaccillus strain PS3 (TF1)1 was expressed in Escherichia coli as described previously (9Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar) and purified as follows. The cell lysate containing the enzyme was applied on a Ni2+-NTA Superflow column (Qiagen) equilibrated with 50 mm imidazole (pH 7.0) and 100 mm NaCl. The column was washed with 100 mmimidazole (pH 7.0) and 100 mm NaCl, and then the enzyme was eluted with 500 mm imidazole (pH 7.0) and 100 mm NaCl. Ammonium sulfate was added to the fraction containing the enzyme to a final concentration of 10% saturation and the sample was applied to a butyl-Toyopearl column (Tosoh, Japan) equilibrated with 500 mm imidazole (pH 7.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 10% saturated ammonium sulfate. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of a solution containing 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 2 mm EDTA, and 10% saturated ammonium sulfate to remove endogenously bound nucleotides. The enzyme was eluted with 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) and 2 mm EDTA and stored as precipitant in 70% saturated ammonium sulfate containing 2 mm dithiothreitol. Before use, the enzyme was dissolved in 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and 2 mm EDTA and passed through a size exclusion column (Superdex 200 HR 10/30; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) and 2 mm EDTA. The amount of nucleotides remaining on the enzyme was determined as described previously (11Tsunoda S.P. Muneyuki E. Amano T. Yoshida M. Noji H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5701-5706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Samples with less than 0.1 mol of nucleotide/mol of enzyme were used for the measurement of hydrolysis activity. Whole TFoF1 complex was reconstituted from the mutant TF1 (β-His tag/γS107C) and authentic Fo from the thermophile and was incorporated into liposomes as described previously (12Bald D. Amano T. Muneyuki E. Pitard B. Rigaud J.L. Kruip J. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. Shibata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 865-870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). ATP, GTP, ITP, and UTP hydrolysis activities of α3β3γ were measured at 23 °C in a medium containing 50 mm MOPS-KOH (pH 7.0), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and an ATP (or GTP, ITP, or UTP)-regenerating system consisting of 2.5 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 100 μg/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 0.2 mm NADH, and pyruvate kinase at 200 μg/ml for ATP hydrolysis, 500 μg/ml for GTP and ITP hydrolysis, or 750 μg/ml for UTP hydrolysis. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the enzyme to 1.3 ml of assay mixture, and hydrolysis was monitored as NADH oxidation determined from the absorbance decrease at 340 nm. The CTP hydrolysis activity was estimated from Pi released in the same medium without a regenerating system during a 60-min incubation at 23 °C. Hydrolysis by the reconstituted TFoF1was also measured as Pi released in 50 mmMOPS-KOH (pH 7.0), 25 mm NaSO4, 25 mm K2SO4, 4 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm indicated nucleotide during a 20-min incubation at 23 °C. Streptavidin-conjugated TF1 for the rotation assay was prepared as described previously (9Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar). Rotation in the presence of ATP, GTP, or ITP was observed in the TF1adsorbed on a Ni2+-NTA-modified polystyrene bead by attaching an actin filament to the γ subunit (10Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 50 mm MOPS-KOH, (pH 7.0), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and an indicated Mg-nucleotide. Fluorescent actin filaments at the bottom of a flow chamber were observed with an inverted epifluorescence microscope (IX70; Olympus). Assays at less than 10 μm GTP or ITP were made on the TF1 directly attached to coverslips to which Ni2+-NTA had been bound covalently (13Adachi K. Yasuda R. Noji H. Itoh H. Harada Y. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7243-7247Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar); the probability of finding a rotating actin filament was higher than on the Ni2+-NTA-modified polystyrene bead. Images were taken with an intensified CCD camera (ICCD-350F; VideoScope) and recorded on 8-mm videotapes. Rotation by UTP or CTP was observed through an aggregate of biotinylated polystyrene beads with a diameter of 440 nm, which was attached to γ (14Yasuda R. Noji H. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Itoh H. Nature. 2001; 410: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Images of bead aggregates were obtained in the bright field in the absence of the oxygen scavenger system and recorded with a CCD camera (CCD-300-RC; Dage-MTI). Possible nucleotide contamination from actin filaments and the oxygen scavenger system was thus excluded. Nucleotide-driven proton-translocation into TFoF1 liposomes was detected as the decrease in the pyranine fluorescence in an FP 777 fluorometer (JASCO, Japan) at 23 °C. TFoF1liposomes (about 5 μg of TFoF1) containing pyranine inside were preincubated at 23 °C in 1.5 ml of a reaction mixture containing 10 mm MOPS-KOH (pH 7.0), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm nucleotide, 25 mmK2SO4, 25 mmNa2SO4, and 20 mmp-xylene-bispyridinium bromide, which quenched the pyranine fluorescence outside the liposomes. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 460 and 510 nm, respectively. The reaction was started by the addition of 4 mm MgCl2. After recording the fluorescence change, 10 μm FCCP was added to recover the initial fluorescence, which would ensure that the fluorescence decrease was caused by the proton uptake into the liposomes. F1-ATPase is known to be inhibited by Mg-ADP tightly bound to a catalytic site (15Jault J.M. Matsui T. Jault F.M. Kaibara C. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Kagawa Y. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16412-16418Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 16Matsui T. Muneyuki E. Honda M. Allison W.S. Dou C. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8215-8221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). TF1 used in the previous study (10Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar) contained ∼0.3 mol of tightly bound nucleotide/mol of enzyme; thus, the hydrolysis activity might have been underestimated. Here, we employed an improved purification protocol (see “Experimental Procedures”) and obtained a sample containing only 0.084 mol of bound nucleotide (0.037 mol of ATP and 0.047 mol of ADP) per mol of enzyme as determined from the peak heights in the reverse-phase chromatography (Fig.2a). Before use, the protein was further purified by size exclusion chromatography, because TF1 tended to aggregate upon storage. For the final sample, the ratio of A 280 toA 260, a convenient measure of the purity, was greater than 2.0 (Fig. 2b). As expected, the ATP hydrolysis activity of this nucleotide-depleted enzyme was higher than that reported previously (see below). ATP, GTP, ITP, and UTP hydrolysis activities of the nucleotide-depleted TF1 were determined as the rate of oxidation of NADH using the ATP-, GTP-, ITP-, or UTP-regenerating system. Hydrolysis of the purine nucleotides, ATP, GTP, and ITP, gradually decelerated to a steady state as shown in Fig.3, a and b. This turnover-dependent inactivation is attributed to the Mg-ADP (GDP, IDP) inhibition. The hydrolysis rates were therefore determined during the initial 10 s after the injection of the enzyme into the assay mixture (Fig. 3, a and b,insets). The rate of ATP hydrolysis did not obey simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics and was fitted with two sets of K m andV max: V maxa = 87.5 s−1, V maxb= 313 s−1, K m a = 5.25 μm, and K m b = 429 μm (Fig. 3c). The maximum rate of ATP hydrolysis, V maxb, of 313 s−1 is higher than the previous value (10Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar) of 177 s−1, presumably because of the thorough removal of the bound nucleotide and aggregated enzyme. An additional factor is the increase of the amount of pyruvate kinase, which may limit the overall reaction rate, to 0.2 mg/ml, compared with 0.05 mg/ml in the previous study. The rates for GTP and ITP hydrolysis could be accounted for by simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics;V max and K m were 187 s−1 and 64 μm, respectively, for GTP and 157 s−1 and 202 μm for ITP. In contrast to the purine nucleotides, UTP hydrolysis activity gradually increased with time (Fig. 3, a and b). This cannot be ascribed to the slow response of the UTP-regenerating system, because it could generate UTP from UDP much faster (0.5 s−1) than the acceleration (0.017 s−1 at 1 mm UTP). Slow binding of UTP to noncatalytic sites could explain the acceleration, but evidence is absent. Because the activation took a longer time at lower UTP concentrations, fully activated rate of UTP hydrolysis was estimated from the slope between 150 and 200 s at >300 μm, between 250 and 300 s at 100 μm, and between 1000 and 1200 s at 30 μm. As seen in Fig. 3c, hydrolysis of UTP was much slower than that of the purine nucleotides. To confirm that the measured hydrolysis rate was that of UTP and not of contaminants, we also measured Pi released in the medium. Although the rate of Pi release was around half the hydrolysis rate determined from NADH oxidation, presumably because of the absence of the UTP-regenerating system, TF1 produced Pi equivalent to >40% of UTP in 5 min. Thus, TF1 did hydrolyze UTP, not contaminating other nucleoside-triphosphates, which amounted to <0.5% (see “Experimental Procedures”). CTP, in contrast, was not hydrolyzed; the rate of Pi release at 2 mm CTP measured over 60 min was indistinguishable from the rate without the enzyme (<0.01 s-1). As seen in Fig. 3c, the maximal hydrolysis rates for the four nucleotides, ATP, GTP, ITP, and UTP, do not differ greatly. The major difference among the four is in the apparentK m values, UTP being the highest. In this regard, it is possible that CTP is also hydrolyzed with a similarV max but with a K m far above 10 mm. Another difference is that ATP hydrolysis shows significant deviation from the simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics, which is not apparent for the other nucleotides. This may be correlated with the stronger tendency toward inhibition with ATP than with the other nucleotides (Fig. 3, a and b). The possibility that the other nucleotides also show deviation at much higher concentrations (giving possibly the sameV max) cannot be dismissed. GTP and ITP supported the rotation of the γ subunit in TF1. The rotation, observed through the motion of a fluorescent actin filament attached to the γ subunit, was counterclockwise without exception, as in the case of ATP-driven rotation. Rotation assays at less than 10 μmGTP or 10 μm ITP were made on the enzyme directly attached to a coverslip that had been covalently modified with Ni2+-NTA (13Adachi K. Yasuda R. Noji H. Itoh H. Harada Y. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7243-7247Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Compared with the previous method (10Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar) of attaching the enzyme on Ni2+-NTA-coated beads, the direct attachment resulted in a higher percentage of finding rotating filaments at low nucleotide concentrations. Because the F1 motor has been shown to be a 120° stepper (10Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar), we compare 3 times the rotational rate of a short actin filament (0.5–1.3 μm) with the corresponding hydrolysis rate (Fig. 3). At low nucleotide concentrations ([ATP] < 0.1 μm, [GTP] < 1 μm, [ITP] < 10 μm) where nucleotide binding is rate-limiting, the two rates agreed with each other, indicating that three molecules of purine nucleotide, whether ATP, GTP, or ITP, drive a full turn. The agreement also shows that the rotation in the presence of GTP or ITP was not due to possible ATP contamination, which was far below 5%. At higher nucleotide concentrations, the rotational rate saturated around 4 revolutions s−1. This is simply due to the hydrodynamic friction against the rotating actin filament (10Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). At low nucleotide concentrations, the rotation was resolved into discrete 120° steps (Fig. 4, a and b). The histograms of dwell times between steps were fitted with a single exponential decay with the rate of 2.9 s−1 for 1 μm GTP and 11.1 s−1 for 10 μm ITP (Fig. 4, c and d), implying that a first order reaction, binding of GTP (ITP), triggers each 120° step. These rate constants agree with the hydrolysis rates (Fig.3c), confirming again that each 120° step is driven by the hydrolysis of one molecule of GTP or ITP. As seen in Fig. 4a, back steps occurred occasionally in GTP-driven rotation. ITP-driven rotation also showed occasional back steps (data not shown). The velocity of back steps was as fast as the forward one and thus is unlikely to be of purely thermal origin (10Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). A stochastic mistake in the order of substrate binding or product release among the three catalytic sites could explain the back steps. With commercial UTP at 4 mm, we occasionally observed slow rotation (e.g.1.4 revolutions s−1). We suspected that this might have been due to contaminants, because ATP at a concentration as low as 300 nm, for example, could account for the observed speed. Indeed, even CTP, which the α3β3γ does not hydrolyze, produced rotation at 0.3 revolutions s−1 at 2 mm. We therefore purified UTP and CTP (see “Experimental Procedures”) and examined rotation at 300 μm, the highest concentration available after the column purification. To avoid possible nucleotide contamination from other sources, we attached an aggregate of biotinylated polystyrene beads to the γ subunit in place of an actin filament and observed the beads in bright field in the absence of the oxygen scavenger system. No rotating beads were found in six assays with UTP in which 5543 beads only fluctuated around a fixed point. Observation in each assay continued for more than 30 min, much longer than the time needed to activate UTP hydrolysis at 300 μm (∼5 min). Six assays with CTP also gave negative results. If hydrolysis of each UTP molecule produces a 120° step as with purine nucleotides, the rotational rate is expected to be 4.4 s−1 at 300 μm UTP. We therefore carried out parallel assays with 600 nm ATP where the rotational rate would be 1.5 s−1. 40 rotating beads were found out of 4299 fluctuating beads (five assays). We also made an “unpredicted test” in which we observed beads without knowing the identity of the nucleotide. No rotation was found with 300 μm UTP, and rotating beads were readily found in the presence of 600 nm ATP. We conclude that UTP cannot support rotation of the γ subunit carrying a bead aggregate, at least not at the rate expected from the hydrolysis rate. One possibility is that UTP hydrolysis, unlike the hydrolysis of purine nucleotides, is completely decoupled from γ rotation, even at no load. The other possibility is that UTP, with a different base structure, cannot supply sufficient power to drive the beads through 120°; in this case, the rate of UTP hydrolysis by the loaded TF1 would also be very low. To compare torque and energy conversion efficiency among three purine nucleotides, ATP, GTP, and ITP, that supported γ rotation, the rotational velocities of actin filaments attached to the γ subunit on Ni2+-NTA coated-beads were examined. Fig. 5 shows time courses of rotation for actin filaments with length around 2 μm (Fig.5a) and 3–4 μm (Fig. 5b). The average rotational velocity was determined for each curve over a portion containing at least five consecutive revolutions without noticeably unnatural intermissions (e.g. the last part of thebrown curve in Fig. 5b was omitted). The results are summarized in Fig. 5c. Most data for GTP-driven (green) and ITP-driven rotation (orange) are on or belowthe line representing the constant torque of 40 pN·nm, as is also the case for ATP-driven rotation (blue). We think that higher velocity values are more reliable, because any obstructions against rotation would reduce the velocity, and we conclude that TF1 exerts a constant rotary torque of about 40 pN·nm regardless of the differences among the structures of purine rings. (The average torque calculated over all points in Fig. 5c is 32 ± 11 pN·nm for ATP, 35 ± 11 pN·nm for GTP, and 32 ± 10 pN·nm for ITP; these average values, however, are not meaningful, because the data in Fig. 5c have been selected for high torque values.) The torque of 40 pN·nm times the angular displacement of 2π/3 radians (equal to 120°), ∼80 pN·nm, is the mechanical work done in a 120° step. In the previous study (10Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar), it was shown that TF1 does this much work even when the free energy available from ATP hydrolysis, ΔG ATP, was reduced to −90 pN·nm/molecule. Here, we examined the torque and work in the presence of 2 mm ATP (or GTP), 10 μm ADP (GDP), and 100 mm inorganic phosphate. Under these conditions, ΔG ATP is calculated as −80 pN·nm/molecule from ΔGATP = ΔG 0 +k B T·ln[ADP]·[Pi]/[ATP], where ΔG0 = −50 pN·nm/molecule (17Stryer L. Biochemistry. 4th Ed. Freeman, New York1995: 443-462Google Scholar),k B T = 4.1 pN·nm/molecule is thermal energy at room temperature, and ΔGGTP should be of a similar value. As seen in Fig. 5c, the experimental points at ΔG ATP = −80 pN·nm/molecule (purple) and ΔG GTP = −80 pN·nm/molecule (brown) are indistinguishable from other points and also fall on or below the line for the constant torque of 40 pN·nm or constant work of 80 pN·nm (the torque averaged over plotted points is 35 ± 10 pN·nm for ΔG ATP = −80 and 32 ± 9 pN·nm for ΔG GTP = −80 pN·nm/molecule) This strengthens our contention that the efficiency of the energy conversion in this motor, from the hydrolysis (of purine nucleotides) into the mechanical work, can reach ∼100%. Nucleotide-driven proton uptake by the reconstituted TFoF1 liposome was measured, to see whether γ rotation is mechanically coupled to the proton pump. Liposomes were incubated with 2 mm nucleotide until the base line became stable, and then 4 mm MgCl2was added to start the reaction (Fig. 6). After 20 min, 10 μm FCCP was added to collapse the pH gradients so as to ensure that the fluorescence decrease indicated the proton uptake. Fig. 6 clearly shows that the purine nucleotides ATP, GTP, and ITP drove the formation of pH gradient but UTP and CTP did not; the latter two gave signals that were indistinguishable from the control in the absence of a nucleotide. The initial rates of proton uptake by GTP and ITP in 1 min after starting the reaction were 30 and 27% of the ATP-driven uptake, respectively. The rate of nucleotide hydrolysis by TFoF1, determined from the amount of inorganic phosphate released in 20 min, was 7.2 ± 1.4 s−1 for ATP, 3.4 ± 0.5 s−1 for GTP, and 2.7 ± 0.5 s−1 for ITP. The three nucleotides show the same order in proton pumping and hydrolysis activities. The agreement suggests that GTP and ITP hydrolysis are coupled to proton pumping as efficiently as with ATP. Pyridine nucleotides were not good substrates for hydrolysis by TFoF1; the hydrolysis activity was not detected by the phosphate measurement (<0.12 s−1 for 2 mm CTP and <0.09 s−1 for 2 mm UTP). In this paper, we have shown that the purine ring of a nucleotide is indispensable for γ rotation and for proton pumping in the FoF1-ATPase. Both rotation and proton pumping were supported by the purine nucleotides, ATP, GTP, and ITP, but not by the pyrimidine nucleotides, CTP and UTP. Our results are consistent with the report by Perlin et al. (18Perlin D.S. Latchney L.R. Wise J.G. Senior A.E. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4998-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), where GTP and ITP were shown to drive proton pumping in the FoF1-ATPase, and support the idea that nucleotide hydrolysis is coupled to proton pumping through mechanical rotation of the γ subunit. Our rotation assay has revealed that many of the rotational characteristics are common to all three purine nucleotides. (i) The rotary torque is constant around 40 pN·nm. (ii) The rotation consists of discrete 120° steps. (iii) Each 120° step is driven by the hydrolysis of one nucleotide molecule. (iv) Backward steps as fast as the forward ones occur occasionally. The first three points imply that the mechanical work done in a 120° step is about 80 pN·nm for all three nucleotides, and thus the energy conversion efficiency can reach ∼100% with all three purine nucleotides. As to the last statement, we have shown in this study that the mechanical work of ∼80 pN·nm is done even when ΔG ATP or ΔG GTP is reduced to −80 pN·nm/molecule. We did not ascertain a high efficiency in ITP-driven rotation, but Sorgatoet al. (19Sorgato M.C. Galiazzo F. Valente M. Cavallini L. Ferguson S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 681: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) have reported that the energy from ITP hydrolysis is converted into a membrane potential by submitochondrial particles as efficiently as ATP hydrolysis. Thus, the efficiency of ITP-driven rotation is expected also to be close to 100%. The similarities among the three nucleotides suggest that the mechanical characteristics of the rotation such as the stepping, torque, and work per step are inherent in the (structure of the) F1motor. Purine nucleotides can trigger and let proceed the stepping mechanism in which the step angle, torque, and work are preset, whereas pyrimidine nucleotides cannot. Chemical kinetics, in contrast, are different among the three purine nucleotides. First, the hydrolysis curves in Fig. 3c are shifted toward higher concentrations in the order of ATP, GTP, and ITP, and the rotation curves follow the same trend. Apparently, this is due to the difference in the rate of nucleotide binding, ATP being the fastest and ITP the slowest. Analysis of step intervals at low nucleotide concentrations supported this view; the rate constant was 2.5 × 107m−1s−1 for ATP (10Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Cell. 1998; 93: 1117-1124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar), 2.9 × 106m−1 s−1 for GTP, and 1.1 × 106m−1 s−1 for ITP. According to the binding change mechanism for ATP synthase (1Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), much of the energy available from γ rotation during synthesis is used to release a tightly bound ATP into the medium. Conversely, during hydrolysis, binding of ATP powers the reverse rotation of γ. If the above difference in the rate constant of nucleotide binding reflects a similar difference in the affinity for the nucleotide, then the energy provided by ITP binding will be the smallest and might have been insufficient to power the stepping mechanism. Because all three purine nucleotides supported rotation, it seems either that the affinity for ITP is high enough (a 20-fold difference in the binding constant is equivalent to a free energy difference of only 12 pN·nm/molecule), or that the rate of nucleotide release decreases in the order of ATP to ITP and makes the affinities more or less the same. In this regard, it is possible that UTP, of which the hydrolysis curve in Fig.3c is further shifted toward the right, cannot confer sufficient binding energy to the stepping mechanism. A second difference in the chemical kinetics is that the ATP hydrolysis was described by two sets of K m andV max, whereas one set sufficed for GTP and ITP. The two sets for the case of ATP are usually ascribed to two modes of catalysis: bisite and trisite, where one or two, or two or three, respectively, of the three catalytic sites are alternately filled with a nucleotide. The possibility, however, exists that the enzyme operates in the bisite mode at all concentrations at or above micromolar and that the apparent deviation from the simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics is due to the Mg-ADP inhibition. Single K m values for the hydrolysis of GTP and ITP, which are shown to be less prone to inhibition, support this view, although two sets ofK m and V max with similarV max/K m could also explain the simple kinetics. Resolution calls for the determination of the number of nucleotides bound in the catalytic sites of uninhibited enzyme, which is not an easy experiment. The pyrimidine nucleotides, CTP and UTP, were poor substrates for the TF1 and TFoF1. CTP was not hydrolyzed and, naturally, did not drive γ rotation or proton pump. UTP was hydrolyzed by TF1, yet UTP did not support rotation and pumping. Ca-ATP has also been reported to be an uncoupling substrate for FoF1, in that Ca-ATP was hydrolyzed without pumping protons (20Papageorgiou S. Melandri A.B. Solaini G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The kinetics of Ca-ATP hydrolysis, however, was similar to that of Mg-ATP hydrolysis. Thus, the nature of uncoupling seems different between the two cases, Ca-ATP and (Mg-)UTP. Interestingly, the reconstituted TFoF1 did not hydrolyze UTP, while TF1 (the α3β3γ subcomplex) did. This finding is consistent with the report by Yokoyama et al. (21Yokoyama K. Hisabori T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21837-21841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the substrate specificity of this enzyme is higher when it contains a fuller complement of subunits. The UTP hydrolysis activity of the α3β3γ subcomplex may be ascribed to some flexibility in and around the catalytic site that would be suppressed in FoF1; such hydrolysis may proceed without a major structural change of the β subunit and thus without rotation of the γ subunit.

Bovine milk contains several protein components, including caseins, immunoglobulins, lactalbumin, lactoferrin, lactoglobulin, lactoperoxidase, and lysozyme (14Mulvihill D.M. Grufferty M.B. Adv. Exp.

We purified and characterized the aggregation inhibitory activity present in milk and determined that this activity is due to lactoferrin. The interaction between lactoferrin and salivary agglutinin was further examined by surface plasmon resonance. Finally, deletion analysis of lactoferrin was used to identify the region of lactoferrin responsible for its interaction with saliva. S. mutans strains MT8148 (3Koga T. Okahashi N. Takahashi I.

Escherichia coli M15[pREP4] was obtained from Qiagen. The culture media used were 2 × TY broth (20Laloi P. Munro C.L. Jones K.R. Macrina F.L. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 28-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for Escherichia coli and brain heart infusion (BHI, Difco) broth for streptococci. Unstimulated whole saliva was collected from a single donor (male, 42 years of age) in an ice-chilled tube and clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Salivary agglutinin was isolated by the method of Oho et al. (9Oho T., Yu, H. Yamashita Y. Koga T. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 115-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, clarified whole saliva diluted 1/2 with aggregation buffer (1.5 mmKH2PO4 (pH 7.2), 6.5 mmNa2HPO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl) was incubated with an equal volume of a cell suspension of S. mutans MT8148 at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed with aggregation buffer, and adsorbed salivary agglutinin was eluted with the same buffer supplemented with 1 mm EDTA. The eluate was filtered (0.2-μm pore size) and subjected to gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 HR (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with aggregation buffer. The eluate at the void volume was collected and used as salivary agglutinin. For the surface plasmon resonance analysis to examine the binding of lactoferrin, salivary agglutinin was dissociated into its components of high molecular mass glycoprotein and sIgA by electrophoretic fractionation (9Oho T., Yu, H. Yamashita Y. Koga T. Infect.

Bovine α-casein, β-casein, κ-casein, lactalbumin, lactoferrin, and lactoperoxidase were purchased from Sigma. Bovine γ-casein was purchased from Research Organics, and bovine lactoglobulin from ICN Biomedicals. Bovine immunoglobulin G was prepared from bovine milk, using affinity chromatography on a HiTrap protein G column (5 ml) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the method of Oho et al. (21Oho T. Shimazaki Y. Mitoma M. Yoshimura M. Yamashita Y. Okano K. Nakano Y. Kawagoe H. Fukuyama M. Fujihara N. Koga T. J. Nutr. 1999; 129: 1836-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Iron-saturated bovine lactoferrin and iron-free lactoferrin (apolactoferrin) were prepared from bovine lactoferrin according to the methods of Kawasaki et al. (22Kawasaki Y. Tazume S. Shimizu K.

The degree of iron saturation of lactoferrin was determined by the Wako Fe-B test (Wako, Osaka, Japan). Bovine lactoferrin (Sigma) was determined to be 19.3% iron-saturated. Lactoferricin B was a gift from the Nutrition Science Laboratory, Morinaga Milk Industry Co., Zama, Japan. Protein content was determined according to the method of Lowry et al. (24Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with bovine serum albumin as a standard. The milk component responsible for inhibiting aggregation was isolated by subjecting bovine milk to fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). First, the milk fat was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min, and the skimmed milk was dialyzed against 10 mm imidazole HCl buffer (pH 7.0). Then, the milk sample was passed through a 0.2-μm filter and applied to a Mono S HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been equilibrated with 10 mmimidazole HCl buffer (pH 7.0). After sample application, the column was washed with 5 volumes of the same buffer, and the bound material was eluted with a linear gradient (0–1 m) of NaCl in the same buffer. Each fraction was analyzed for protein by monitoring the absorbance at 280 nm (A280) and was assayed for aggregation inhibitory activity. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the isolated aggregation inhibitory bovine milk component was determined by Edman degradation using a Shimadzu PSSQ-21 gas-phase sequencer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Streptococcal cells were suspended in aggregation buffer at an A550 of ∼1.5. Either 25 μl of whole saliva or 10 μl of salivary agglutinin (0.5 mg/ml) was mixed with 1 ml of the cell suspension and various amounts of bovine milk component, and the total volume of the reaction mixture was adjusted to 1.5 ml with aggregation buffer. CaCl2 was added to the mixture of salivary agglutinin at a final concentration of 1 mm. Bacterial aggregation was determined by monitoring the change in A550 at 37 °C for 2 h with a UV-visible recording spectrophotometer (Ultrospec 3000, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Surface plasmon resonance, which permits real-time analysis of macromolecular interactions (25Jönsson U. Fägerstam L. Ivarsson B. Johnsson B. Karlsson R. Lundh K. Löfås S. Persson B. Roos H. Rönnberg I. Sjölander S. Stenberg E. Ståhlberg R. Urbaniczky C. Östlin H. Malmqvist M. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 620-627PubMed Google Scholar), was used to examine the binding of bovine lactoferrin to rPAc, salivary agglutinin, or to components of salivary agglutinin. Binding assays were carried out with a BIAcore 2000 surface plasmon resonance biosensor (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). First, rPAc, salivary agglutinin, high molecular mass glycoprotein separated by electrophoretic fractionation, and sIgA separated by electrophoretic fractionation were immobilized on carboxymethylated, dextran-coated, gold-surfaced CM5 sensor chips via primary amino group linkages according to the method of Johnssonet al. (26Johnsson B. Löfås S. Lindquist G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). For immobilization of each protein, 35 μl of a 300 μg/ml solution in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5) was passed over the activated chip surface, while phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.0) was maintained at 5 μl/min throughout the immobilizing process. Binding of rPAc, salivary agglutinin, high molecular mass glycoprotein, and sIgA to the chip surfaces occurred at 5.8, 7.4, 7.1, and 10.9 ng/mm2, respectively. Each milk component, diluted in an appropriate running buffer, was then passed over the immobilized surface at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The effect of pH on the binding of bovine lactoferrin to salivary agglutinin was assayed in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 2–8) containing 0.15 m NaCl. Divalent cation specificity was examined in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.0) containing 0–2 mm CaCl2, MgCl2, or MnCl2. The dissociation phase of binding was initiated by the injection of the diluent buffer at 10 μl/min. All binding experiments were performed at 25 °C. The surface resonance signal in each binding cycle was expressed in resonance units (RU). A resonance of 1,000 RU corresponds to a shift of 0.1° in the resonance angle, which corresponds to a change in surface protein concentration of ∼1 ng/mm2 (27Stenberg E. Persson B. Roos H. Urbaniczky C. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1991; 143: 513-526Crossref Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). In thermal stability studies, lactoferrin was heated at 40–100 °C for 15 min and was then subjected to the surface plasmon resonance binding assay. Truncated bovine lactoferrin fragments were prepared as 6 × His-tagged fusion proteins by cloning of polymerase chain reaction-amplified lactoferrin gene fragments into expression vector pQE-30 (Qiagen). The following sets of primers were used for amplification: LfN-F, 5′-TATAGAGCTCATGAAGCTCTTCGTCCCC-3′; LfN-R, 5′-ACACGTCGACTTACCTGGTGTACCGCGCCTT-3′; LfC-F, 5′-TATAGGATCCGTCGTGTGGTGTGCCGTG-3′; LfC-R, 5′-ACACGTCGACTTACCTCGTCAGGAAGGCGCA-3′; Lf4-R, 5′-ACACGTCGACTTACAACCTGAAGTCCTCACG-3′; Lf41-R, 5′-ACACGTCGACTTACCCAACGTCCTCAGCCAG-3′; Lf42-R, 5′-ACACGTCGACTTAACACAAGGCACAGAGTCT-3′; Lf43-R, 5′-ACACGTCGACTTAGCCCATGGGGATGTTCCA-3′; Lf44-R, 5′-ACACGTCGACTTAGACAACTGCCACGGCAAG-3′; Lf45-F, 5′-TATAGGATCCGGCCAGAACGTGACCTGT-3′; Lf46-F, 5′-TATAGGATCCATCTACACTGCGGGCAAG-3′; Lf47-F, 5′-TATAGGATCCGGGTACCTTGCCGTGGCA-3′; Lf411-F, 5′-TATAGGATCCCTGATCGTCAACCAGACA-3′. The amplified DNAs were digested with either BamHI and SalI orSacI and SalI (LfN only) restriction sites (underlined) and inserted into the BamHI-SalI orSacI-SalI sites of the pQE-30 plasmid. The ligated DNAs were then transformed into E. coliM15[pREP4]. The truncated lactoferrin fragments (amino acid position and primer used) are LfN (amino acid position, 1–344; primers, LfN-F and LfN-R), LfC (amino acid position, 345–689; primers, LfC-F and LfC-R), Lf4 (amino acid position, 345–571; primers, LfC-F and Lf4-R), Lf41 (amino acid position, 345–538; primers, LfC-F and Lf41-R), Lf42 (amino acid position, 345–505; primers, LfC-F and Lf42-R), Lf43 (amino acid position, 345–472; primers, LfC-F and Lf43-R), Lf44 (amino acid position, 345–439; primers, LfC-F and Lf44-R), Lf45 (amino acid position, 366–571; primers, Lf45-F and Lf4-R), Lf46 (amino acid position, 399–571; primers, Lf46-F and Lf4-R), Lf47 (amino acid position, 432–571; primers, Lf47-F and Lf4-R), and Lf411 (amino acid position, 473–538; primers, Lf411-F and Lf41-R). As a control, 6 × His-tagged mouse dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) fusion protein was produced. Expression vector pQE-40 (Qiagen), which contains a DNA fragment encoding the DHFR, was transformed into E. coliM15[pREP4]. Lactoferrin and DHFR fusion proteins were extracted from whole cell extracts of E. coli M15[pREP4] cells containing the recombinant plasmids. Cells were cultured in 2 × TY broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C until an A550 of 1.0 was attained. Expression was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to the cultures at a final concentration of 1 mm, and the cultures were grown for 3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 ×g for 20 min, and one-step purification of the fusion proteins was performed with Ni2+-HiTrap chelating columns (1 ml) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacture's instructions. In brief, the cell pellet was solubilized in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 6m guanidine HCl (buffer A) at 5 ml/g and mixed by inversion for 1 h at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the cleared supernatant was applied to a Ni2+-HiTrap chelating column that had been equilibrated with buffer A. The column was extensively washed with buffer A and then with 5 or more volumes of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 8 m urea (buffer B) containing 10 mm imidazole until theA280 of eluate was less than 0.01. The fusion proteins were eluted with buffer B containing 250 mmimidazole. The eluted proteins were refolded by sequential dialysis against buffers containing decreasing urea concentrations for 18 h in each buffer at 4 °C (28Wingfield P.T. Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Ploegh H.L. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. 1. John Wiley and Sons, New York1995: 6.1.1-6.2.15Google Scholar). The gradient buffers contained 4, 2, and 1m urea in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1m sodium phosphate, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. After dialysis against 1 m urea, fusion proteins were dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0) containing 0.3 m NaCl for 18 h at 4 °C. Each fusion protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE was performed using 12.5 and 15% polyacrylamide gels according to the method of Laemmli (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Electrophoresis calibration kits (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used as molecular mass markers. For Western blotting, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes according to the method of Burnette (30Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5906) Google Scholar). After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl) containing 1% Triton X-100, the membranes were treated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-bovine lactoferrin antiserum (Betchyl Laboratories). Differences between the control and the test samples in aggregation were determined by Student'st test. The FPLC fraction of bovine milk eluted at 0.64m NaCl inhibited the saliva-induced aggregation of S. mutans cells (Fig. 1). Coomassie staining of the SDS gel revealed a single 80-kDa band in this fraction (Fig. 2 A, lane 2). In Western blot, rabbit anti-bovine lactoferrin antiserum reacted with this band (Fig. 2 B, lane 1). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of this component was Ala-Pro-Arg-Lys-Asn-Val-Arg-Trp-Cys-Thr, which corresponds to the N terminus of bovine lactoferrin (31Bellamy W. Takase M. Yamauchi K. Wakabayashi H. Kawase K. Tomita M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1121: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). These results indicated that the aggregation inhibitory component is lactoferrin.Figure 2SDS-PAGE (A) and Western blotting (B) analyses of the aggregation inhibitory protein purified by FPLC. A, milk samples were suspended in SDS-PAGE reducing buffer (1% SDS, 1% 2-mercaptoethanol) and heated at 100 °C for 3 min. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE (12.5% polyacrylamide), and the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The molecular mass markers used were α-lactalbumin (14.4 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (20 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), and phosphorylase b (94 kDa).

Both whole saliva and salivary agglutinin induced strong aggregation. Testing of various bovine milk components revealed that lactoferrin inhibited this saliva-induced aggregation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3). Of the milk components tested, bovine lactoferrin had the strongest inhibitory activity, whereas other components, such as lactoperoxidase, α-casein, and κ-casein, showed weak inhibitory activity (TableI). Other oral streptococci, such as S. mutans Xc, S. sanguinis ATCC 10556,S. oralis ATCC 10557, and S. gordonii ATCC 10558, were also tested for their ability to aggregate in the presence of whole saliva with or without bovine lactoferrin. Bovine lactoferrin showed the same inhibitory effect on the aggregation of these strains that it did on the aggregation of S. mutans MT8148 (TableII).Table IEffects of various milk components on the saliva-induced aggregation of S. mutans MT8148 cellsMilk componentAggregation1-aExpressed as the reduction ofA550 after 2 h.

The binding of bovine lactoferrin to rPAc, salivary agglutinin, or to components of salivary agglutinin separated by electrophoretic fractionation was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance. Lactoferrin (50 μg/ml) in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.0) was allowed to react with immobilized ligands on a sensor chip. The biosensor response of bovine lactoferrin to rPAc, salivary agglutinin, high molecular mass glycoprotein, and sIgA was 149 ± 16, 470 ± 13, 718 ± 47, and 34 ± 1 RU/ng of immobilized ligand, respectively (mean ± S.D. of triplicate assays). Binding of bovine lactoferrin to immobilized salivary agglutinin was enhanced by the addition of CaCl2 to the running buffer, with an optimum concentration of 0.5 mm CaCl2. MgCl2 and MnCl2 did not enhance binding (data not shown). In thermal stability studies, the biosensor response induced by binding of bovine lactoferrin to immobilized salivary agglutinin gradually decreased as the temperature used to heat the lactoferrin was raised. However, lactoferrin still bound to salivary agglutinin even after heating at 100 °C (Fig.4 A). The pH maximum for binding of bovine lactoferrin to salivary agglutinin was pH 4.0, and no detectable binding occurred at pH 2.0 (Fig. 4 B). To identify the saliva-binding region of the bovine lactoferrin molecule, 11 6 × His-tagged lactoferrin fragments were cloned and expressed in E. coli. These fusion proteins were purified and used in spectrophotometric aggregation assays. SDS-PAGE analysis of each lactoferrin fragment showed a single band (data not shown). The N-terminally truncated lactoferrin fragment, LfC (residues 345–689), strongly inhibited saliva-induced aggregation ofS. mutans cells, whereas the C-terminally truncated fragment LfN (residues 1–344) weakly inhibited the aggregation (Fig.5). Fragments Lf4 (residues 345–571), Lf41 (residues 345–538), Lf45 (residues 366–571), Lf46 (residues 399–571), and Lf47 (residues 432–571) also exhibited strong inhibition of saliva-induced aggregation of S. mutans, as did the shorter fragment Lf411 (residues 473–538). In contrast, fragments Lf43 (residues 345–472) and Lf44 (residues 345–439) exhibited only weak inhibitory activity. The 6 × His-tagged DHFR, which was used as control, also weakly inhibited aggregation. Human saliva induces aggregation of S. mutans via an interaction between PAc of the organism and salivary agglutinin, which is a complex of high molecular mass glycoprotein and sIgA (3Koga T. Okahashi N. Takahashi I. Kanamoto T. Asakawa H. Iwaki M. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 289-296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Oho T., Yu, H. Yamashita Y. Koga T. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 115-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gonget al. (32Gong K. Mailoux L. Herzberg M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8970-8974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) also showed that salivary film on hydroxyapatite contains a complex of macromolecular protein enriched in sIgA and α-amylase, which forms a S. sanguinis-binding site. In this study, we showed that bovine milk lactoferrin inhibited the saliva-induced aggregation of S. mutans cells. The binding of bovine lactoferrin to rPAc, salivary agglutinin, and components of salivary agglutinin was examined using surface plasmon resonance. Bovine lactoferrin bound more strongly to salivary agglutinin, especially to high molecular mass glycoprotein, than to rPAc, suggesting that bovine lactoferrin may inhibit the interaction between PAc and salivary agglutinin by binding to high molecular mass glycoprotein of salivary agglutinin. Aggregation of other streptococcal cells induced by whole saliva was also inhibited by bovine lactoferrin, indicating that the inhibitory effect of lactoferrin is not specific for S. mutans. The optimal pH for the binding of bovine lactoferrin to salivary agglutinin was 4.0, and the stability of lactoferrin to bind to salivary agglutinin was not affected by previous heat treatment. The isoelectric point of bovine lactoferrin is ∼8.0 (33Shimazaki K. Kawaguchi A. Sato T. Ueda Y. Tomimura T. Shimamura S. Int. J. Biochem. 1993; 25: 1653-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It can be sterilized at high temperatures at pH 4.0 without any significant loss of bactericidal activity, suggesting that it is thermally stable at pH 4.0 (34Saito H. Takase M. Tamura Y. Shimamura S. Tomita M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 357: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Bovine lactoferrin may adopt a conformation suitable for interaction with salivary agglutinin at this pH as well. Lactoferrin is an iron-binding glycoprotein, and its iron-binding capacity is associated with many biological functions (35Baker E.N. Anderson B.F. Baker H.M. MacGillivray R.T.A. Moore S.A. Peterson N.A. Shewry S.C. Tweedie J.W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 443: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 36Sánchez L. Caivo M. Brock J.H. Arch. Dis. Child. 1992; 67: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The lactoferrin preparation used in this study was 19.3% iron-saturated. To examine the role of iron binding in inhibition of S. mutans aggregation, we also prepared apolactoferrin and iron-saturated lactoferrin and assayed them for their ability to inhibit the saliva-induced aggregation. No significant differences were observed among the inhibitory properties of these three types of lactoferrin (data not shown). These results are consistent with those of Soukka et al. (37Soukka T. Roger V. Söderling E. Tenovuo J. Microb. Ecol. Health Dis. 1994; 7: 139-144Google Scholar), who observed that these three types of lactoferrin cause no difference in the binding of S. mutans, although the assay was performed using saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. These results suggest that iron ion in lactoferrin does not play a significant role in the binding of bovine lactoferrin to salivary agglutinin. In another experiment, Soukka et al.(38Soukka T. Tenovuo J. Rundegren J. Arch. Oral Biol. 1993; 38: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) showed that apolactoferrin effectively agglutinates S. mutans cells but not the other bacteria. However, our preliminary studies have shown that all of the three types of lactoferrin did not induce the aggregation of S. mutanscells. 2M. Mitoma, T. Oho, Y. Shimazaki, and T. Koga, unpublished data. The cause of this discrepancy may be ascribed to differences in strain of S. mutans used or the experimental condition. To identify the saliva-binding region of the lactoferrin molecule, we prepared a series of truncated lactoferrin fragments and assayed their effects on the saliva-induced aggregation of S. mutanscells. Our results suggest that lactoferrin residues 473–538 play an important role in the inhibition of saliva-induced aggregation ofS. mutans. Other fragments lacking these residues, such as LfN (residues 1–344), Lf43 (residues 345–472), and Lf44 (residues 345–439), exhibited only weak inhibitory activity. The lactoferrin molecule is proposed to consist of two lobes (N-lobe and C-lobe) (40Moore S.A. Anderson B.F. Groom C.R. Haridas M. Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 222-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The N-lobe contains the active domains for bactericidal action and heparin binding (31Bellamy W. Takase M. Yamauchi K. Wakabayashi H. Kawase K. Tomita M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1121: 130-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 41Shimazaki K. Uji K. Tazume T. Kumura H. Shimo-Oka T. Shimazaki K. Tsuda H. Tomita M. Kuwata T. Perraudin J.-P. Lactoferrin: Structure, Function and Applications. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands2000: 37-46Google Scholar), whereas the C-lobe contains a functional domain for hepatocyte binding and internalization (42Maheshwari P. Sitaram P. Mcabee D.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In these previous studies, lactoferrin fragments were prepared by tryptic cleavage of lactoferrin and isolated by high performance liquid chromatography. Here, we prepared truncated lactoferrin fragments using recombinant DNA technology. Our results indicate that the lactoferrin domain responsible for binding to salivary agglutinin is within the C-lobe of the protein. The mechanism of binding of lactoferrin to salivary agglutinin remains unclear. The predicted pI value and secondary structure of each lactoferrin fragment were obtained using the DNA software package, DNASIS (Hitachi Software Engineering, Tokyo, Japan). Secondary structure was predicted according to the method of Chou and Fasman (43Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 222-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (2541) Google Scholar). Although all the active fragments containing residues 473–538 had acidic pI values, the inactive fragment Lf44 also had an acidic pI value (pI = 5.2). Therefore, electrostatic interactions do not seem to be involved in agglutinin binding. Furthermore, the inhibitory fragments of lactoferrin did not retain characteristic secondary structures. Lactoferricin B, a 25-amino acid peptide derived from the N-lobe of bovine lactoferrin, has bactericidal activity (44Yamauchi K. Tomita M. Giehl T.J. Ellison III, R.T. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 719-728Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The antibacterial properties of lactoferricin B are attributed to the disruption of target cell membranes by the basic residues arrayed along the outside of the lactoferricin B molecule (45Baker H.M. Anderson B.F. Kidd R.D. Shewry S.C. Baker E.N. Shimazaki K. Tsuda H. Tomita M. Kuwata T. Perraudin J.-P. Lactoferrin: Structure, Function and Applications. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam, The Netherlands2000: 3-15Google Scholar). We found that lactoferricin B had no inhibitory effects on the saliva-induced aggregation of S. mutans cells (data not shown). Further studies are necessary to elucidate the mechanism by which active lactoferrin fragments inhibit the saliva-induced aggregation ofS. mutans. There are two types of bacterial interaction with salivary components; saliva-induced bacterial aggregation in solution phase and bacterial adherence to salivary components adsorbed on the tooth surface. Gibbons and Hay (46Gibbons R.J. Hay D.I. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 439-445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Raj et al. (47Raj P.A. Johnsson M. Levine M.J. Nancollas G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5968-5976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that proline-rich proteins and statherin serve as pellicle receptors for some of streptococcal strains, but do not induce aggregation of the organisms in suspension. On the basis of these findings, Gibbons (48Gibbons R.J. J. Dent. Res. 1989; 68: 750-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) proposed a model that an apparent conformational change occurs when salivary components bind to hydroxyapatite, which exposes the binding sites for bacterial adhesin. This explains the difference between bacterial aggregation and adherence. In the present study, we found that lactoferrin in bovine milk possessed inhibitory activity against saliva-induced aggregation of S. mutans in solution phase. Therefore, we are unable to exclude the possibility that milk components other than lactoferrin may possess inhibitory effect on the binding of bacterial cells to a salivary film. Further studies are necessary to clarify effects of milk components on the adherence of bacterial cells to a salivary film. Lactoferrin attracted a great deal of attention for its wide variety of functions (39Brock J.H. Hutchens T.W. Lönnerdal B. Lactoferrin: Interactions and Biological Functions. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1997: 3-23Crossref Google Scholar). Lactoferrin is viewed as a potential contributor to dental caries prevention by virtue of its inhibitory effect on the binding of S. mutans to acquired pellicles on the tooth surface and its bactericidal action on S. mutans (18Lassiter M.O. Newsome A.L. Sams L.D. Arnold R.R. J. Dent. Res. 1987; 66: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have now demonstrated that bovine lactoferrin inhibits the interaction between PAc of S. mutans and salivary agglutinin by binding strongly to salivary agglutinin.

https://openalex.org/W2092786860,"The hY RNAs are a group of four small cytoplasmic RNAs of unknown function that are stably associated with at least two proteins, Ro60 and La, to form Ro ribonucleoprotein complexes. Here we show that the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP) I and K are able to associate with a subset of hY RNAs in vitro and demonstrate these interactions to occur also in vivo in a yeast three-hybrid system. Experiments performed in vitro and in vivo with deletion mutants of hY1 RNA revealed its pyrimidine-rich central loop to be involved in interactions with both hnRNP I and K and clearly showed their binding sites to be different from the Ro60 binding site. Both hY1 and hY3 RNAs coprecipitated with hnRNP I in immunoprecipitation experiments performed with HeLa S100 extracts and cell extracts from COS-1 cells transiently transfected with VSV-G-tagged hnRNP-I, respectively. Furthermore, both anti-Ro60 and anti-La antibodies coprecipitated hnRNP I, whereas coprecipitation of hnRNP K was not observed. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that hnRNP I is a stable component of a subpopulation of Ro RNPs, whereas hnRNP K may be transiently bound or interact only with (rare) Y RNAs that are devoid of Ro60 and La. Given that functions related to translation regulation have been assigned to both proteins and also to La, our findings may provide novel clues toward understanding the role of Y RNAs and their respective RNP complexes.

Small ribonucleoprotein (RNP)1 complexes are usually composed of one molecule of a small RNA and several proteins that bind either directly to the RNA or indirectly via protein-protein interactions (1Varani G. Nagai K. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 407-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 2Yu Y.-T. Scharl E.C. Smith C.M. Steitz J.A. Gesteland R.F. Cech T.R. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 487-524Google Scholar). Many of these complexes exert essential functions that are often indispensable for survival, such as the small nuclear RNPs, which are major components of the spliceosomal machinery, or the signal recognition particle, which plays a key role in protein export. In contrast to these well defined complexes, the structure of the cytoplasmic Ro RNPs is still not fully resolved, and their function has remained enigmatic (3Pruijn G.J.M. Simons F.H.M. Van Venrooij W.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 123-132PubMed Google Scholar, 4Labbe J.C. Hekimi S. Rokeach L.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 349-354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They are composed of one molecule of a small Y RNA (transcribed by RNA polymerase III) and at least two proteins, the 60-kDa protein Ro60 and the 48-kDa phosphoprotein La. However, although Ro60 and Y RNAs are present in comparable stochiometric amounts, La is ∼50-fold more abundant, and therefore the vast majority of La molecules is not bound to Y RNAs, in contrast to Ro60 (5Peek R. Pruijn G.J.M. Van der Kemp A.J.W. Van Venrooij W.J. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 929-935PubMed Google Scholar). Y RNAs are highly conserved in evolution (6Pruijn G.J. Wingens P.A. Peters S.L. Thijssen J.P. van Venrooij W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1216: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and have been found in all multicellular eukaryotic organisms and may also be present in some bacteria (7Chen X.G. Quinn A.M. Wolin S.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 777-782PubMed Google Scholar) but, remarkably, have so far not been detected in yeast. Interestingly, the genome of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans contains only one functional Y RNA gene, whereas in humans and other vertebrates four closely related Y RNA species exist. Unlike other RNA polymerase III transcripts, Y RNAs retain the oligo(U) stretch at their 3′ end that forms the binding site for La; therefore these RNAs remain permanently associated with La (5Peek R. Pruijn G.J.M. Van der Kemp A.J.W. Van Venrooij W.J. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 929-935PubMed Google Scholar, 8Boire G. Craft J. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1182-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). On the other hand, nuclear Y RNAs do not seem to be associated with Ro60, and it was suggested that Ro RNPs assemble upon export to the cytoplasm (3Pruijn G.J.M. Simons F.H.M. Van Venrooij W.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 74: 123-132PubMed Google Scholar,9Simons F.H.M. Rutjes S.A. Van Venrooij W.J. Pruijn G.J.M. RNA. 1996; 2: 264-273PubMed Google Scholar). Several functions have been proposed for La, including regulation of RNA polymerase III transcription (10Gottlieb E. Steitz J.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 851-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 11Maraia R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2283-3387Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 12Wolin S.L Matera G.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), involvement in internal ribosome entry site-dependent viral and cellular translation (13Belsham G.J. Sonenberg N. Svitkin Y.V. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 203: 85-98PubMed Google Scholar, 14Holcik M. Korneluk R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4648-4657Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and a role in the assembly of small nuclear RNPs (15Xue D. Rubinson D.A. Pannone B.K. Yoo C.J. Wolin S.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1650-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), but it is still not entirely clear which role this abundant nuclear and cytoplasmic protein plays in vivo. In particular, it is completely unknown whether a unique function can be attributed to Y RNA-associated La. Much less is known about biological activities of Ro60 (4Labbe J.C. Hekimi S. Rokeach L.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 349-354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm it may be involved in the regulation of translation as recently demonstrated for ribosomal protein L4 in Xenopus laevis oocytes (16Pellizzoni L. Lotti F. Rutjes S.A. Pierandrei-Amaldi P. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 593-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and in the nucleus Ro60 may be implicated in a discard pathway of 5 S rRNA by recognizing incorrectly processed and misfolded molecules (17O'Brien C.A. Wolin S.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2891-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 18Labbe J.C. Burgess J. Rokeach L.A. Hekimi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13233-13238Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, these (proposed) functions do not seem to be dependent on the presence of Y RNAs in X. laevis nor in C. elegans. Interestingly, a prokaryotic homologue of Ro60 was recently discovered in the bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans that seemed to contribute to the remarkable resistance of this organism to ultraviolet radiation (7Chen X.G. Quinn A.M. Wolin S.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 777-782PubMed Google Scholar). This may lead to speculation about a RNA chaperoning function of Ro60 as has been recently proposed for La (19Pannone B.K. Xue D. Wolin S.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7442-7453Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Although the stable association of Ro60 and La with Y RNAs is beyond experimental doubt, the presence of other components in addition to Ro60 and La is still a matter of debate. Thus, the suggested associations of a 52-kDa protein (Ro52) and the Ca2+-binding protein calreticulin have remained controversial (20Ben-Chetrit E. Chan E.K.L. Sullivan K.F. Tan E.M. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 1560-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 21Slobbe R.L. Pluk W. Van Venrooij W.J. Pruijn G.J.M. J. Mol.

Rev. 1998; 164: 209-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and recently reported interactions of two novel proteins with Ro60 observed in yeast two- and three-hybrid systems need to be confirmed (26Wang D. Buyon J.P. Zhu W. Chan E.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 27Bouffard P. Barbar E. Briere F. Boire G. RNA. 2000; 6: 66-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we demonstrated in vitro binding of several proteins contained in a HeLa S100 extract to hY RNAs (28Fabini G. Rutjes S.A. Zimmermann C. Pruijn G.J.M. Steiner G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2778-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These proteins (with molecular masses between 53 and 80 kDa) bound specifically to hY1 and hY3 RNA but only weakly or not at all to hY4 and hY5 RNA. Interestingly, autoantibodies to these proteins were found in sera from patients with the rheumatic autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who commonly develop autoantibodies to Ro and La (29Ben-Chetrit E. Br. J. Rheumatol. 1993; 32: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Using deletion mutants of hY1 RNA we were able to show that the binding sites for these proteins were distinct from the Ro60 binding site. In this report we demonstrate that two of these proteins are identical to the heterogeneous nuclear RNP proteins I (hnRNP I) and K (hnRNP K) and present evidence that they are able to associate with a subset of hY RNAs in vivo. For immunodetection of proteins binding to hY1 and hY3 RNA in vitro, an anti-Ro positive serum from a patient (BM) with SLE containing antibodies to these proteins was employed (28Fabini G. Rutjes S.A. Zimmermann C. Pruijn G.J.M. Steiner G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2778-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Sera from healthy persons and from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (which do not contain anti-Ro or anti-La autoantibodies) were used as negative controls. Monoclonal antibodies used were anti-La SW5 (30Pruijn G.J. Thijssen J.P. Smith P.R. Williams D.G. Van Venrooij W.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), anti-Ro60 2G10 (31Veldhoven C.H. Pruijn G.J. Meilof J.F. Thijssen J.P. Van der Kemp A.W. Van Venrooij W.J. Smeenk R.J. Clin.

Biol. 1992; 12: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar; kind gift of Gideon Dreyfuss, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA), anti-PTB 3 (Ref. 33Grossman J.S.

Helfman, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory), and an anti-human interleukin-6 antibody (Janssen Biochimica, Denmark) as control. HeLa S100 extracts for use in reconstitution assays were prepared essentially as described (28Fabini G. Rutjes S.A. Zimmermann C. Pruijn G.J.M. Steiner G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2778-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 1010 HeLa cells (Computer Cell Culture Center, Mons, Belgium) were washed twice in isotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 140 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol), resuspended in 2 pellet volumes of buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol) and disrupted by Dounce homogenization. Nuclei were separated by brief centrifugation (3 min at 3,000 × g), and the supernatant was first centrifuged for 20 min at 20,000 ×g and then for 1 h at 100,000 × g. After measuring the protein concentration the S100 extract was stored at −70 °C. For immunoprecipitation experiments with transfected COS-1 cells, total cell extracts were prepared after trypsinization, harvesting (800 rpm, 5 min), and washing of the cells with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl). Cells were sonified with a Branson microtip (three times for 10 s at 4 °C) in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithioerythritol, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). After 15 min cell debris was removed by centrifugation (12,000 rpm, 15 min), and the extract was stored at −70 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently blotted onto nitrocellulose as described (28Fabini G. Rutjes S.A. Zimmermann C. Pruijn G.J.M. Steiner G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2778-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 34Zimmermann C. Smolen J.S. Graninger W. Petera P. Fabini G. Hassfeld W. Höfler E. Steiner G. J. Rheumatol. 1996; 23: 1897-1903PubMed Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose sheets were blocked for 1 h with 3% nonfat dried milk in incubation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100) and subsequently incubated for 1 h either with human autoimmune serum diluted 1:50 or with monoclonal antibodies, respectively. After washing the nitrocellulose filters three times with incubation buffer, bound antibodies were detected by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human or anti-mouse IgG (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Extracts from transfected cells were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a nitrocellulose filter. After blocking the filters in washing buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dried milk, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) for 1 h at room temperature, filters were incubated with monoclonal anti-VSV-G tag antibody (Roche Diagnostics, Almere, Netherlands) diluted 1:500 in washing buffer for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, bound antibodies were detected by chemiluminescence using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG as secondary antibody (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Immunoprecipitations with monoclonal antibodies to Ro60, La, and hnRNP I and K were performed as described with antibodies coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using dimethylpimelimidate (Sigma) as a cross-linking agent (28Fabini G. Rutjes S.A. Zimmermann C. Pruijn G.J.M. Steiner G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2778-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Twenty μl of a HeLa cell extract was diluted in 0.5 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (IPP)-150 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with immobilized antibodies (20 μl of packed bead volume). Subsequently, beads were washed three times with IPP-150 and resuspended in 400 μl of IPP-150 containing 0.5% SDS. RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol using 10 μg of glycogen as carrier, and analyzed by Northern blot hybridization. For isolation of proteins 200 μl of a HeLa cell extract was applied to 1 ml of anti-Ro or anti-La immunoaffinity columns using a peristaltic pump at a low flow rate. After washing with at least 10 bed volumes of IPP-150, proteins were eluted with IPP-1000 (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1000 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40). For immunoprecipitations carried out with extracts from transfected cells, monoclonal antibodies (anti-VSV-G-tag, anti-Ro60, or anti-La) were coupled to protein A-agarose beads by incubating overnight at 4 °C in IPP-500 buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40). Subsequently, the antibody-coated beads were equilibrated with IPP-150 and incubated with cell extracts for 2 h at 4 °C. Then the beads were extensively washed with IPP-150, and coprecipitating RNAs were isolated by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. In vitro transcription of human sense and antisense hY RNAs and of hY1 RNA deletion mutants was performed as described (28Fabini G. Rutjes S.A. Zimmermann C. Pruijn G.J.M. Steiner G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2778-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To generate biotinylated RNAs biotin 16-UTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used at 75 μm concentration, for preparation of radiolabeled RNAs 0.5 mm UTP and 40 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were employed. The plasmid encoding 5 S rRNA was a kind gift of Dr. K. Nierhaus (Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics, Berlin, Germany). For detection of Y RNAs by Northern blot hybridization RNAs were separated on 10% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels, electroblotted onto nylon membranes (Zeta-probe; Bio-Rad), fixed by UV cross-linking, and hybridized with 32P-labeled antisense hY RNA transcripts by incubating overnight at 65 °C as described (28Fabini G. Rutjes S.A. Zimmermann C. Pruijn G.J.M. Steiner G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2778-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 34Zimmermann C. Smolen J.S. Graninger W. Petera P. Fabini G. Hassfeld W. Höfler E. Steiner G. J. Rheumatol. 1996; 23: 1897-1903PubMed Google Scholar). These procedures were performed essentially as described (28Fabini G. Rutjes S.A. Zimmermann C. Pruijn G.J.M. Steiner G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2778-2789Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To dissociate existing complexes, the salt concentration of the HeLa extract was first increased to 1 m KCl followed by 30 min of incubation on ice. Then 10 μg of biotinylated hY RNA or biotinylated control RNA (5 S rRNA) and 200 μg yeast tRNA (Roche) was added and the KCl concentration was readjusted to 150 mm by diluting with reconstitution buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol). After incubating for 20 min at 30 °C reconstituted hY RNP complexes were isolated by adding 20 μl of NeutrAvidin beads (Pierce) and rotating for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were then washed five times with 1 ml of IPP-150, and bound proteins were isolated employing elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 20 mmDTT, 2% SDS). Eluted proteins were heated for 5 min at 65 °C and precipitated by adding 1 μl of glycogen (20 mg/ml) and 4 volumes of acetone. Samples were left at −70 °C for at least 30 min and subsequently centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 × g. Recovered proteins were dissolved either in SDS sample buffer for SDS-PAGE or in two-dimensional lysis buffer for application in two-dimensional electrophoresis. Proteins binding to biotinylated hY RNAs in vitro were dissolved in 20–40 μl of lysis buffer containing 9 m urea, 2% CHAPS (Sigma), 0.8% ampholyte pH 3–10 (40% solution, Fluka, Switzerland), 1% DTT. High resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis on immobilized pH gradients was carried out on ready-cut IPG Immobiline strips, pH 3–10 nonlinear, 18 cm long (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After overnight incubation in rehydration buffer (8 m urea, 0.5% CHAPS, 15 mm DTT, 0.2% ampholyte pH 3–10), the strips were focused on a horizontal electrophoresis apparatus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a stepwise fashion: 0.5 h at 300 V, 1 h at 500 V, 1 h at 1500 V, and 15 h at 2500 V (total 40 kVh) at room temperature. The IPG strips were subsequently incubated for 15 min in equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6m urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, traces of bromphenol blue) containing 10 mg/ml DTT and for 15 min in equilibration buffer containing 48 mg/ml iodoacetamide (Sigma). Equilibrated IPG strips were immersed in SDS running buffer for a few seconds and placed on top of a 1-mm vertical SDS 10% polyacrylamide gel. SDS-PAGE was run for 4–5 h at 20 mA, and the gels were then stained with Coomassie Blue R-250 or electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes for immunodetection. Coomassie-stained spots corresponding to proteins binding to hY1 RNA (and not to 5 S rRNA) were excised, completely destained, and subjected to sequence analysis by tandem mass spectrometry performed after in gel trypsin digestion (Harvard Microchemistry Facility, Cambridge, MA). VSV-G-tagged cDNAs were constructed as follows. For the human La protein the N-terminal VSV-G tag (MEIYTDIEMNRLGK) was introduced via PCR using the following primers: La-1 (5′-GAATTCGCCACCATGGAGATTTATACAGACATAGAGATGAACCGACTTGGAAAGCGCGGCCGCATGGCTGAAAATGGTGATAATG-3′) and La-2 (5′-CTCGAGCTACTGGTCTCCAGCACCATT-3′) using a full-length La cDNA (35Pruijn G.J. Slobbe R.L. Van Venrooij W.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5173-5180Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) as template. Indicated in bold type are the introduced EcoRI, NotI, and XhoI sites. The VSV-G tag encoding sequence is underlined. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI/XhoI and cloned into the corresponding sites of the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). The cDNAs encoding hnRNP K and hnRNP I were kindly provided by Gideon Dreyfuss (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). The human hnRNP K cDNA was modified by PCR to introduce flanking NotI and XhoI sites, allowing replacement of the La cDNA with the hnRNP K cDNA, which resulted in an N-terminally VSV-G-tagged hnRNP K construct in pcDNA3. An N-terminally Myc-tagged version of a human hnRNP I cDNA in pcDNA3 was modified to replace the Myc tag with a VSV-G tag. The integrity of the constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. As a control, the empty pcDNA3 vector was used in transfection experiments. African green monkey cells (COS-1) were transiently transfected with the expression constructs. Briefly, COS-1 cells were grown to 80% confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were trypsinized and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. Approximately 5 × 106cells were transfected with 20 μg of plasmid DNA in a total volume of 400 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Electroporation was performed at 300 V and a capacity of 125 microfarads with a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad). Subsequently, the cells were seeded in 75-cm2culture flasks and cultured overnight. To investigate the interaction of hnRNP I and hnRNP K with hY RNAs in vivo, a three-hybrid system (36SenGupta D.J. Zhang B. Kraemer B. Pochart P. Fields S. Wickens M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) was used (RNA-protein hybrid hunter kit; Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). The DNAs encoding hY RNAs and hY1 RNA deletion mutants were introduced into the SmaI andAvrII sites of the pRH5′ hybrid RNA vector downstream of two copies of the MS2 RNA sequence. hnRNP I and hnRNP K hybrids were constructed by ligating the PCR amplified fragments into theEcoRI and XhoI sites of the pYEASTrp2 hybrid protein vector. The sequence and orientation of all recombinant DNAs was verified by sequencing. The yeast strain L40uraMS2, which stably expresses the LexA DBD-MS2 coat protein was double transformed with plasmids containing the hybrid RNAs and the hybrid proteins, respectively. Transformants were selected on synthetic medium plates lacking uracil and tryptophan. Expression of the bait proteins was checked by Western blotting using appropriate monoclonal antibodies. Double transformants were then assayed for β-galactosidase (β-gal) expression on a filter using X-gal as a substrate and for growth on selective medium without histidine. For quantitative determination of β-gal activity cells were disrupted with glass beads, and, after determination of protein concentration, enzyme activity was measured photometrically at 420 nm using 2-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as a substrate. As a positive control the established IRE-IRP interaction was used (36SenGupta D.J. Zhang B. Kraemer B. Pochart P. Fields S. Wickens M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Recently, we have described a set of five proteins with molecular masses between 53 and 80 kDa that in addition to Ro60 and La bound to human hY RNAsin vitro, particularly to hY1 and hY3 RNA (28Fabini G.

Interestingly, autoantibodies to these proteins were detected in several sera of patients with SLE who commonly develop antibodies to Ro and La proteins. To further characterize these hY RNA-binding proteins Ro RNP complexes were reconstituted in vitro by incubating HeLa S100 extracts with biotinylated hY1 RNA. Reconstitution reactions employing biotinylated 5 S rRNA were performed in parallel to control for nonspecifically binding proteins. All reactions were supplemented with a 20-fold excess of yeast tRNA as a nonspecific competitor. Reconstituted complexes were purified by NeutrAvidin affinity chromatography followed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and subsequently analyzed by immunoblotting using SLE serum BM known to recognize all five novel hY RNA-binding proteins as well as Ro60 and La (Ref. 28Fabini G.

Apart from the spots corresponding to Ro60 and La proteins, four major protein spots can be detected migrating above Ro60. The most acidic of these proteins, which reproducibly migrated at ∼68 kDa, was excised from a Coomassie-stained two-dimensional gel run in parallel, digested with trypsin, and microsequenced by tandem electrospray mass spectrometry. This analysis provided a 19-amino acid tryptic peptide sequence (GSYGDLGGPIITTQVTIPK), which completely matched a sequence contained in the human hnRNP K protein (residues 378–396). This result was compatible with the migration of the proteins in our two-dimensional gels, which largely corresponded to the molecular mass (66 kDa) and isoelectric point values (6.1–6.4) reported for hnRNP K (40Pinol-Roma S.

The two stained spots migrating below La presumably represent La degradation products. Positions of Ro60 and La were determined in a separate experiment using monoclonal antibodies to these proteins. The hnRNP K protein was identified by tandem mass spectrometry, the identity of hnRNP I (migrating as a doublet) was deduced from its characteristic position on the two-dimensional gel and immunologically confirmed using a monoclonal antibody against hnRNP I (see Fig. 2 C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The second protein that we could identify was a basic protein visible as a 62/60-kDa doublet.

The loss of APC function is associated with the development of colorectal carcinogenesis. In previous studies, we have shown that theAPC gene is inducible and that the DNA damage-induced level of APC mRNA requires p53. In the present study, we examined the role of p53 in the transcriptional regulation ofAPC promoter and characterized two p53-binding sites on the cloned APC promoter (pAPCP). Results of electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed specific interactions of p53 protein with p53-binding site oligonucleotides. The DNA-protein complex formed in electrophoretic mobility shift assay was competed with unlabeled excess of p53-binding site oligonucleotide, unaffected with p53-binding site mutant or Sp1-binding site oligonucleotides, and supershifted with anti-p53 antibodies. In a transient transfection assay, the pAPCP promoter activity was lower in HCT-116(p53+/+) cellsversus HCT-116(p53−/−) cells. p53-dependent down-regulation was further confirmed after co-transfection of pAPCP plasmid with pCMV-p53 into HCT-116(p53−/−) and SAOS-2 (p53-negative) cells. However, the treatment of cells with DNA alkylating agents methylmethane sulfonate andN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, which cause phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 and Ser392, induced pAPCP promoter activity in HCT-116(p53+/+) cells. Other than p53-binding sites, using deletion mutation constructs, we have shown thatN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine-induced transcriptional activation of the pAPCP promoter in HCT-116(p53+/+) cells depended upon the Sp1-binding site and the E-box B site. From these results, we conclude that unphosphorylated p53 can down-regulate and phosphorylated p53 can up-regulate the pAPCP promoter activity involving the p53, Sp1, or E-box B elements.

The development and progression of colon cancer is a multistep process in which growth control is progressively impaired. Mutations of the APC 1(adenomatous polyposis coli),Ki-ras, deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC), DNA mismatch repair (MMR), and p53 genes play important roles at different stages of colorectal carcinogenesis (for review, see Ref. 1Ilyas M.

In addition, APC may act as a negative regulator of β-catenin signaling in the transformation of colonic epithelial cells (14Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W.

Axin (Axil/conductin) binds to APC, β-catenin, and GSK3β and thereby promotes β-catenin phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination and degradation in the proteasome (17Aberle H. Bauer A.

Thus, the regulation by APC of the level of β-catenin plays a role in β-catenin/Tcf-Lef-mediated transcriptional regulation of genes. However, the mechanisms by which these transcriptional changes contribute to early stage colorectal carcinogenesis are still unclear.Tumor suppressor p53, which plays a critical role in the cellular response to DNA damage, oxidative stress, and hypoxia, is also frequently mutated in colon cancer cells (for reviews, see Refs. 28Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4252) Google Scholar and29Ljungman M. Neoplasia. 2000; 2: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The target genes regulated by p53 includep21 WAF1/Cip1, GADD45,mdm2, bax, and cyclin G (29Ljungman M. Neoplasia. 2000; 2: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activation function of p53 requires post-translational modification of the p53 protein via phosphorylation, acetylation, or glycosylation (for reviews, see Refs. 29Ljungman M.

Jaiswal and S. Narayan, submitted for publication.In our earlier studies, a link between APC and p53 was established in which APC mRNA levels were increased in a p53-dependent manner by DNA alkylating agents (38Narayan S. Jaiswal A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30619-30622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 39Jaiswal A.S. Narayan S. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 13: 733-740PubMed Google Scholar). To further understand the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of APC, we recently cloned the APC promoter and identified transcriptional regulatory elements (40Jaiswal A.S. Narayan S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 262-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The APC gene has a TATA-less promoter and contains consensus binding sites for octamer, AP2, Sp1, a CAAT-box, and three nucleotide sequences for E-box A, B, and M. In those previous studies, we showed that the APCgene is transcriptionally regulated by upstream stimulating factors 1 and 2 (USF1 and USF2; Ref. 40Jaiswal A.S. Narayan S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 262-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, we have identified two p53-binding elements on the APC promoter. The objective of the present study is to characterize the p53-binding element of theAPC promoter and to examine the mechanisms by which p53 regulates DNA alkylation-induced APC gene transcription.DISCUSSIONColon cells can operate normally if they retain one normalAPC allele and make sufficient functional APC protein (for review, see Ref. 1Ilyas M. Staub J. Tomlinson I.P.M. Bodmer W.F. Eur. J. Cancer. 1999; 35: 1986-2002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, once both alleles are damaged, the important brake on tumor suppression mediated by APC is lost. Previous findings suggest that the phenotype of a cell expressing a mutatedAPC gene can be reverted by increased expression of the remaining wild-type APC allele and provide evidence that overexpression of the APC wild-type gene alone can suppress tumorigenicity (46Goyette M.C.

Gut. 1995; 37: 826-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, understanding the mechanisms by whichAPC gene expression can be induced in colon cancer cells may lead to the design of more effective chemopreventive drugs that block tumor cell progression. In previous studies, we have shown that theAPC gene was transcriptionally activated in response to DNA alkylation damage and that this increase was dependent upon wild-type p53 (38Narayan S. Jaiswal A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30619-30622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 39Jaiswal A.S. Narayan S. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 13: 733-740PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we characterized the APCpromoter for the p53-binding element and examined whether p53-dependent transcriptional up-regulation of theAPC gene in response to DNA alkylation damage was mediated by p53 involving the p53-binding site of the APC promoter. The structure of the APC promoter has been previously described (40Jaiswal A.S. Narayan S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 262-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 49Eibner M.

Recently, we reported that APC gene could be regulated by USF1 and USF2 through E-box sites (40Jaiswal A.S. Narayan S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 262-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Using electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift analysis, we found a specific binding of p53 protein with p53-binding sites of theAPC promoter and showed that these sites are transcriptionally functional and respond to DNA alkylation damage. Currently, the mechanisms are unknown by which p53 interacts with the transcriptional machinery and regulates the rate of APC gene transcription in the presence or the absence of signals generated by DNA alkylating agents.p53 activates transcription from specific DNA-binding sites and represses transcription in a binding site-independent manner. Treatment of cells with DNA-damaging agents induces nuclear accumulation of p53, which trans-activates cell cycle- and apoptosis-related genes (for reviews, see Refs. 28Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4252) Google Scholar, 29Ljungman M. Neoplasia. 2000; 2: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 30Meek D.W. Pathol. Biol. 2000; 48: 246-254PubMed Google Scholar). p53 is post-translationally modified by phosphorylation, acetylation, or glycosylation, which could be important in understanding how cells detect and respond to DNA damage (for reviews, see Refs. 28Kinzler K.W.

Because p53 is activated by a variety of DNA-damaging agents, it appears to be a universal signaling molecule for the DNA damage response (51Liu Z.-G. Baskaran R. Lea-Chou E.T. Wood L.D. Chen Y. Karin M. Wang J.Y.J. Nature. 1996; 384: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). p53 is phosphorylated at multiple sites in both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of the molecule (Refs. 31Shieh S.Y.

The significance of the p53 phosphorylation is associated with sequence-specific DNA binding. Recently, we reported that the p53 of HCT-116 cells is phosphorylated at Ser15 and Ser392 after treatment with MMS.2 Duckettet al. (37Duckett D.R. Bronstein S.M. Taya Y. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12384-12388Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) reported a similar phosphorylation of p53 in HCT-116 cells after treatment with MNNG andN-methyl-N-nitrosourea.In the present studies, a down-regulation of APC promoter activity might be a result of unphosphorylated form of p53, which is present in untreated (unstressed) cells. However, once the p53 was phosphorylated at Ser15 and Ser392 in response to DNA alkylating agents, it activated APC gene expression. Currently, it is unclear how unphosphorylated or phosphorylated p53 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of APC gene expression. In previous studies, it has been suggested that phosphorylation of p53 enhances its binding activity for the DNA consensus sequence that could strongly activate gene expression (53Wang Y. Prives C. Nature. 1995; 376: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). On the other hand, phosphorylation of p53 did not affect its binding activity to DNA consensus sequence in the ribosomal gene cluster or muscle creatine kinase (54Hecker D. Page G. Lohrum M. Weiland S. Scheidtmann K.H. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 953-961PubMed Google Scholar, 55Fuchs B. Hecker D. Scheidtmann K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 625-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Our recent studies showed that phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 and Ser392enhanced consensus DNA binding activity but decreased thep21 promoter activity. However, unphosphorylated p53 enhanced p21 promoter activity, but the opposite effect was seen with APC promoter, where the phosphorylated form of p53 up-regulated activity and the unphosphorylated form of p53 down-regulated APC gene expression. One of the differences in p21 and APC promoters is that thep21 promoter contains a TATA-box and the APC gene contains a TATA-less promoter (40Jaiswal A.S. Narayan S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 262-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 42el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7890) Google Scholar). These studies indicate that differential phosphorylation of p53 may have differential effects on the regulation of target genes by modulating DNA binding activities and interacting with other transcription factors. For example, p53 represses the transcriptional activity of TATA-box-containing promoters but either has no effect or up-regulates TATA-less promoters (56Mack D.H. Vartikar J. Pipas J.M. Laimins A. Nature. 1993; 363: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar).The interaction of p53 with the transcriptional preinitiation complex of the TATA-less promoter of the APC gene could be through either p53-binding site or through protein-protein interaction involving the Sp1-binding site or the TFIIH complex. The results presented in this study showed that the APC promoter has functional p53-binding sites that respond to DNA alkylation damage. However, after DNA alkylation damage not only the wild-type or p53-binding site-containing plasmids, but also pAPCP(592), pAPCP(622), pAPCP(668), and pAPCP(737) plasmids showed increased promoter activities. These results indicate that p53 may regulate APCpromoter activity through protein-protein interactions as well. The increased promoter activity observed with the pAPCP(592) plasmid in response to DNA alkylation damage can be attributed through one or more than one of the following elements: the Sp1-binding site, the E-box A, B, and M sites, and the CAAT-box site. The maximum response of MNNG treatment, observed with the Sp1-binding site-containing plasmid pAPCP(592), was decreased with the pAPCP(622) plasmid that lacks Sp1-binding site. Furthermore, a significantly increased promoter activity was seen with pAPCP(737) plasmid, which did not contain p53- and Sp1-binding sites and E-box A and CAAT-box sites; instead it contained E-box B and E-box M sites. Further deletion of the E-box B site from the pAPCP(737) plasmid caused the MNNG response to be lost, indicating that E-box B site was important for MNNG-inducedAPC promoter activity. Thus, the Sp1-binding site and E-box B site may be involved in p53-mediated expression of APCgene transcription. Furthermore, from these results, we cannot rule out that the Sp1-binding site or the E-box B site is functioning independently of p53 in MNNG-induced expression of APC gene transcription. In fact, we have recently shown that the E-box B site and the USF1 and USF2 factors binding to this site are important for transcriptional regulation of the pAPCP promoter (40Jaiswal A.S. Narayan S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 81: 262-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Currently, we do not know how p53 interacts with the Sp1-binding site or the E-box B site of the APC promoter. However, from other studies we know that the interaction of Sp1 and p53 can occur through a GC-rich region (Sp1-binding site) as found with SV40 virus (57Bargonetti J. Chicas A. White D. Prives C. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1997; 43: 935-949PubMed Google Scholar, 58Sawaya B.E. Khalili K. Mercer W.E. Denisova L. Amini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20052-20057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) or through protein-protein interaction as described with insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor gene (59Ohlsson C. Kley N. Werner H. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1101-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Our future studies will be focused to examine these possibilities.TFIIH is another possible factor through which p53 can be involved in p53-binding site-independent transcriptional up-regulation ofAPC gene expression. In our preliminary studies, an increased level of phosphorylated p53 has been detected in the TFIIH complex of HCT-116(p53+/+) cells after treatment with MNNG,2 which suggests a role of TFIIH complex in p53-dependent activation of APC gene expression. Among the general transcription factors, TFIIH is a versatile, multifunctional protein complex with transcriptional properties coupled to those of DNA repair (for review, see Ref. 60Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Egly J.-M. Vermeulen W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). If p53 of the TFIIH complex plays a role in DNA alkylation-induced transcriptional up-regulation of APC, then it is likely that increased expression of APC might be associated with cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis of cancer cells. In fact, in previous studies a role for APC has been implicated in cell cycle arrest (61Baeg G.H. Matsumine A. Kuroda T. Bhattacharjee R.N. Miyashiro I. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5618-5625Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and apoptosis (62Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7950-7954Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Thus, p53 is transcriptionally competent to stimulate APC gene expression by direct interaction through p53-binding sites or by indirect interaction through Sp1-binding site, E-box B site, or the TFIIH complex. Nonetheless, the collaboration between p53 and APC after DNA alkylation damage may indicate an important role for A"
https://openalex.org/W2066261250,"We have examined the chromatin structure around and upstream of the transcriptional start site of the human alpha2(I) collagen (COL1A2) gene. Four strong DNase I-hypersensitive sites (HS2-5) were only detected in fibroblasts, and a weaker one (HS1) was identified in type I collagen-negative cells. Another hypersensitive site potentially involved in COL1A2 silencing was found in intron 1 (HS(In)). HS1 and HS2 were mapped within conserved promoter sequences and at locations comparable to the mouse gene. HS3, HS4, and HS5 were likewise mapped approximately 20 kilobases upstream of COL1A2 at about the same position as the mouse far-upstream enhancer and within a remarkably homologous genomic segment. DNase I footprinting identified twelve areas of nuclease protection in the far-upstream region (FU1-12) and within stretches nearly identical to the mouse sequence. The region containing HS3-5 was found to confer high and tissue-specific expression in transgenic mice to the otherwise minimally active COL1A2 promoter. Characterization of the human element documented functional differences with the mouse counterpart. Enhancer activity substantially decreased without the segment containing FU1-7 and HS5, and inclusion of AluI repeats located 3' of HS3 augmented position-independent expression of the transgene. Hence, subtle differences may characterize the regulation of mammalian alpha2(I) collagen genes by evolutionarily conserved sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2036190266,"Galactosemia is an inherited disorder characterized by an inability to metabolize galactose. Although classical galactosemia results from impairment of the second enzyme of the Leloir pathway, namely galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, alternate forms of the disorder can occur due to either galactokinase or UDP-galactose 4-epimerase deficiencies. One of the more severe cases of epimerase deficiency galactosemia arises from an amino acid substitution at position 94. It has been previously demonstrated that the V94M protein is impaired relative to the wild-type enzyme predominantly at the level of Vmax rather thanKm. To address the molecular consequences the mutation imparts on the three-dimensional architecture of the enzyme, we have solved the structures of the V94M-substituted human epimerase complexed with NADH and UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, UDP-GlcNAc, or UDP-GalNAc. In the wild-type enzyme, the hydrophobic side chain of Val94 packs near the aromatic group of the catalytic Tyr157 and serves as a molecular “fence” to limit the rotation of the glycosyl portions of the UDP-sugar substrates within the active site. The net effect of the V94M substitution is an opening up of the Ala93 to Glu96 surface loop, which allows free rotation of the sugars into nonproductive binding modes.1I3M1I3N1I3K1I3L Galactosemia is an inherited disorder characterized by an inability to metabolize galactose.

Clinical manifestations include intellectual retardation, liver dysfunction, and cataract formation, among others. Although deficiencies of any of the three enzymes participating in the Leloir pathway for galactose metabolism (Scheme FS1) can result in symptoms of galactosemia, the classical form of the disease arises from impairment of galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, the second enzyme in the pathway (1Holton J.B. Walter J.H. Tyfield L.A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly S.W. Valle D. Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York2000: 1553-1587Google Scholar). Of particular interest is the third enzyme in the pathway, namely UDP-galactose 4-epimerase, hereafter referred to as epimerase. This NAD+-dependent enzyme plays a key role in normal galactose metabolism by catalyzing the interconversion of UDP-galactose and UDP-glucose as indicated in Scheme FS1. Interestingly, the human form of epimerase has also been shown to interconvert UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc (2Maley F. Maley G.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 31: 577-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 3Piller F. Hanlon M.H. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10774-10778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kingsley D.M. Kozarsky K.F. Hobbie L. Krieger M. Cell. 1986; 44: 749-759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). This type of activity has not been observed in the epimerase from Escherichia coli. Two types of human epimerase-based galactosemia have been identified thus far: peripheral and generalized. While the peripheral form can be quite common among some ethnic groups and is usually considered benign, the generalized form of the disease is clinically severe and extremely rare (5Gitzelmann R. Helv. Paediatr. Acta. 1972; 27: 125-130PubMed Google Scholar, 6Gitzelmann R. Steinmann B. Helv. Paediatr. Acta. 1973; 28: 497-510PubMed Google Scholar, 7Gitzelmann R. Steinmann B. Mitchell B.

Med. 1997; 45 (abstr.): 191PubMed Google Scholar). The most severe form of epimerase deficiency galactosemia characterized to date arises from a homozygous mutation encoding the substitution of a methionine residue for a valine at position 94 (9). This substitution impairs enzyme activity to ∼5% of wild-type levels with respect to UDP-galactose and to ∼25% of wild-type levels with respect to UDP-GalNAc (10Wohlers T.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2000; 23: 713-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The mutant protein is impaired relative to the wild-type enzyme predominantly at the level ofVmax rather than Km (10Wohlers T.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2000; 23: 713-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Previous biochemical analyses on the epimerase from E. colihave suggested that its reaction mechanism proceeds through abstraction of the hydrogen from the 4′-hydroxyl group of the sugar by a catalytic base and transfer of a hydride from C-4 of the sugar to C-4 of the NAD+, leading to a 4′-ketopyranose intermediate and NADH (11Frey P.A. Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avramovic O. Pyridine Nucleotide Coenzymes: Chemical, Biochemical, and Medical Aspects. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987: 461Google Scholar). A limited but well-defined rotation of this intermediate is thought to occur in the active site, thereby allowing return of the hydride from NADH to the opposite side of the sugar. Recently, the three-dimensional structure of human epimerase complexed with NADH and UDP-glucose was solved by x-ray crystallographic analyses to 1.5-Å resolution (12Thoden J.B. Wohlers T.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5691-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A ribbon representation of one subunit of the homodimeric protein is displayed in Fig. 1. As can be seen, the overall fold of the enzyme can be described in terms of two structural motifs: the N-terminal domain defined by Met1–Thr189and the C-terminal region formed by Gly190–Ala348. The N-terminal domain adopts the three-dimensional architecture referred to as a Rossmann fold. Strikingly, the NADH and UDP-glucose ligands are positioned within the active site such that C-4 of the sugar lies at ∼3.5 Å from C-4 of the dinucleotide (12Thoden J.B. Wohlers T.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5691-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Additionally, Oη of Tyr157 and Oγ of Ser132 are located at 3.1 Å and 2.4 Å, respectively, from the 4′-hydroxyl group of the sugar moiety. It is believed that the low barrier hydrogen bond formed between the sugar and the side chain of Ser132facilitates the removal of the 4′-hydroxyl hydrogen by the phenolic acid chain of Tyr157 and the transfer of the hydride from C-4 of the sugar to C-4 of the nicotinamide ring (12Thoden J.B. Wohlers T.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5691-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To address the molecular consequences of the V94M substitution in human epimerase, we have crystallized and solved the x-ray structures of the mutant protein complexed with UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, UDP-GlcNAc, or UDP-GalNAc, all to 1.5-Å resolution. These investigations have allowed for a more complete understanding of the three-dimensional consequences this mutation imparts on the active site geometry of the enzyme and provide a molecular explanation for the observed enzymatic impairment. The V94M form of human UDP-galactose 4-epimerase was constructed and overexpressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris, as described (9Wohlers T.M. Christacos N.C. Harreman M.T. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Am. J.

Wohlers T.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5691-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar. Ternary complexes of the protein were prepared by treating the epimerase samples (15 mg/ml in the final dialysis buffer) with 5 mm NADH and 20 mm UDP-sugars and allowing the solutions to equilibrate for 24 h at 4 °C. Large crystals of each of the complexes were grown from 100 mmMES1 (pH 6.0), 8–9% (w/v) poly(ethylene glycol) 3400, and 75 mm MgCl2 by macroseeding into batch experiments at 4 °C. Typically, the crystals grew to maximum dimensions of 0.3 × 0.2 × 0.7 mm in ∼1–2 weeks. For x-ray data collection, the crystals were transferred to cryoprotectant solutions in two steps. First they were slowly transferred to intermediate solutions containing 20% poly(ethylene glycol) 3400, 500 mm NaCl, and 20% (v/v) methanol. After equilibration in the methanol-containing solutions, the crystals were subsequently transferred into similar solutions that had been augmented with 4% (v/v) ethylene glycol. All of the crystals were suspended in loops of 20-μm surgical thread and immediately flash-frozen in a stream of nitrogen gas. The four V94M protein·NADH·UDP-sugar complexes crystallized in the space group P212121 with typical unit cell dimensions of a = 78.1 Å, b= 89.9 Å, and c = 96.9 Å. Each asymmetric unit contained one dimer, and only subunit I in the coordinate file will be discussed under “Results and Discussion.” Native x-ray data sets to 1.5-Å resolution were collected at the Advanced Photon Source, Structural Biology Center beamline 19-BM. These data were processed with HKL2000 and scaled with SCALEPACK (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38609) Google Scholar). Relevant x-ray data collection statistics are presented in TableI. The V94M protein·NADH·UDP-glucose structure was solved via AMORE (14Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr.

Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5691-5701Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The other three structures were solved via difference Fourier techniques. Manual adjustments of the models using the program Turbo (15Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991Google Scholar) and subsequent least squares refinements with the package TNT (16Tronrud D.E. Ten Eyck L.F. Matthews B.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Fridovich-Keil J.L. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 2000; 23: 713-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Specifically, the Km values for the wild-type and mutant forms of the protein, when assayed with UDP-galactose, were 0.27 ± 0.01 and 0.15 ± 0.02 mm, respectively. The Vmax values, however, were significantly different for the wild-type and V94M proteins at 1.22 versus0.036 mmol of UDP-galactose/mg/min, respectively. Additionally, the apparent Km values for the wild-type and V94M enzymes, with UDP-GalNAc as the substrate, corresponded to 0.287 ± 0.05 mm and 0.445 ± 0.01 mm, respectively. For the x-ray investigation presented here, four different crystal forms of the V94M enzyme were prepared, namely the complexes of protein with NADH and the following ligands: UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, UDP-GlcNAc, or UDP-galNAc. All of the structures were solved to 1.5-Å resolution and refined to R-factors equal to or less than 18.5%. The relative location of the galactosemic mutation with respect to the active site of the native enzyme can be seen in Fig.2 a. As expected, the main structural perturbation imposed by the V94M substitution occurs in the helical loop defined by Ala93 to Glu96, which connects the fourth β-strand to the fourth major α-helix of the Rossmann fold. This change in loop structure is similar in all of the V94M protein models described here and is independent of the identity of the sugar ligand occupying the active site. In the wild-type enzyme, the side chain of Val94 points toward the active site and is located at ∼3.5 Å from the catalytic Tyr157. Additionally, the carbonyl oxygen of Val94 forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain hydroxyl group of Ser97, which further serves to tighten down that portion of the polypeptide chain backbone abutting the UDP-sugar binding pocket. This loop in the wild-type enzyme is well ordered with an average temperature factor of 22.0 Å2 for all of the atoms lying between Ala93 and Glu96. The corresponding temperature factors for the V94M protein·NADH·UDP-sugar complexes are significantly higher, however, at ∼77 Å2. Indeed, residual electron density in maps calculated with (Fo − Fc) coefficients suggests that alternate conformations of this loop are present in the crystalline lattice but at lower occupancies. It was not possible to build these alternate conformations into the electron density with any certainty, however, and hence they were not included in the protein models. A superposition of the polypeptide chains near residue 94 for the wild-type enzyme and the V94M protein complexed with UDP-galactose is displayed in Fig. 2 b. The mutation at position 94 results in a significant change in the backbone dihedral angles of the preceding alanine residue. Specifically, in the wild-type enzyme, Ala93 adopts φ and ψ angles of approximately −82 and 106°, respectively, while in the V94M protein, the corresponding angles are −124° and 148°. As a result of these changes in torsional angles, the side chain of Met94 in the mutant protein extends out toward the solvent, and the hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of residue 94 and Oγ of Ser97 is no longer present. It should be noted that if the loop between Ala93 and Glu96 were to adopt the wild-type conformation in the V94M protein, the larger side chain of Met94 could not be accommodated in the active site without significant steric clashes, and this, presumably, explains in part the dramatic changes in backbone conformation starting at position 93. The net effect of this three-dimensional perturbation is an opening of the active site, thereby allowing free rotation of the sugar moiety. Indeed, from electron density maps calculated with (Fo − Fc) coefficients, it is clear that the sugars in the V94M structures complexed with either UDP-glucose or UDP-galactose adopt multiple conformations that are not well defined. Because of this, it is not possible to describe in detail the carbohydrate/protein interactions in these two particular structures. It is possible, however, to compare the interactions between the protein and the UDP moieties in the wild-type and the V94M proteins with either bound UDP-glucose or UDP-galactose. Potential hydrogen-bonding interactions observed between the wild-type enzyme and the substrate are depicted in a schematic representation in Fig.3 a, while those for the V94M·NADH·UDP-glucose complex are shown in Fig. 3 b. As indicated, the side chains forming hydrogen bonds to the UDP-glucose in the wild-type protein include Ser132, Tyr157, Asn187, Asn207, Arg239, Asp303, and Arg300. Only Ser132 and Tyr157 interact solely with the carbohydrate portion. All of the other side chains are primarily involved in UDP binding. As can be seen in Fig. 3 a, the uracil ring of the UDP-glucose is anchored to the native enzyme via the backbone carbonyl group of Asn224 and the peptidic NH group of Phe226. Two additional water molecules serve to bridge the C-4 carbonyl group of the base to the protein. These interactions are also observed in the various V94M mutant protein models (Fig. 3 b). In the wild-type protein, the 2′- and 3′-hydroxyl groups of the uridine ribose are hydrogen-bonded to the carboxylate group of Asp303 and a water molecule, respectively. The guanidinium group of Arg300 interacts with both α- and β-phosphoryl oxygens of UDP when bound to wild-type enzyme, while the side chain of Arg239 forms an electrostatic interaction with a β-phosphoryl oxygen. Similar interactions are, indeed, observed in the V94M enzymes as indicated in Fig. 3 b. The only significant differences between the wild-type enzyme and the V94M protein occur at the glucose moiety. In the wild-type protein, the glucose moiety is firmly anchored in place by interactions with the side chains of Ser132 and Tyr157 and the carbonyl oxygen of Lys92, which is located in the loop containing the V94M mutation. These interactions are missing in the mutant proteins with bound UDP-glucose or UDP-galactose due to the free rotation of the glycosyl groups in the active site. The limited change in Km observed between the wild-type enzyme and the V94M protein is a function of the fact that the nucleotide portion of the UDP-sugar substrate provides most of the binding interactions. Unlike that observed for the V94M protein·NADH·UDP-glucose or the V94M protein·NADH·UDP-galactose complexes, the sugar moieties in the V94M proteins with either bound UDP-GlcNAc or UDP-GalNAc are visible in the electron density maps as shown in Fig.4 for the UDP-GlcNAc species. Note that the 6′-hydroxyl group of the N-acetylglucosamine adopts two conformations and that the sugar is rotated away from the nicotinamide ring of the NADH. Residual electron density in maps calculated with (Fo − Fc) coefficients suggests that each of these sugars adopt alternate conformations at lower occupancies. Because of the quality of the residual electron density, however, it was not possible to unambiguously model these alternate conformations into the electron density; hence, they were not included in the coordinate files. Interestingly, the electron density map calculated for the V94M enzyme crystallized in the presence of UDP-GalNAc clearly demonstrated that the ligand had been converted to UDP-GlcNAc. This result is reminiscent of that observed with the epimerase from E. coli. All attempts to prepare an abortive complex of the bacterial enzyme with UDP-galactose failed (19Thoden J.B. Frey P.A. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5137-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These experiments included reduction of the enzyme with dimethylamine/borane in the presence of UDP-galactose, UDP, UMP, or TMP and subsequent exchange of these nucleotides with UDP-galactose. In every case, the electron density maps always indicated the presence of UDP-glucose in the active site. Obviously, UDP-glucose binds more tightly to epimerase in the abortive complex, and although the enzyme had been reduced with dimethylamine/borane, enough residual activity remained to convert UDP-galactose to UDP-glucose. Most likely, the same phenomenon is occurring in the case of the human V94M-substituted epimerase with bound UDP-GalNAc. Within the last year, the three-dimensional structure of human wild-type epimerase with bound NADH and UDP-GlcNAc was solved to 1.5-Å resolution, and it was demonstrated that to accommodate the additionalN-acetyl group at the C-2 position of the sugar, the side chain of Asn207 rotates toward the interior of the protein and interacts with Glu199 (20Thoden J.B. Wohlers T.M. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15131-15136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Shown in Fig.5 is a superposition of the active site regions for the wild-type and V94M proteins with bound UDP-GlcNAc. As can be seen, in the V94M-substituted form, the sugar group of the ligand rotates out of the pocket and toward position 94. This type of rotation is blocked in the native enzyme due to the side chain of Val94. In the wild-type enzyme the distance between C-4 of the UDP-GlcNAc ligand and C-4 of the nicotinamide ring of the NADH is 3.0 Å. This distance in the V94M protein model is 9.4 Å. The 4′-hydroxyl group of the sugar in the wild-type enzyme is located at 2.8 Å from Oγ of Ser132 and 3.0 Å from Oη of Tyr157. Due to the drastic rotation of the sugar moiety in the active site pocket, these distances in the V94M protein complex are 9.5 and 10.2 Å, respectively. Key hydrogen bonds between the N-acetylglucosamine group of the ligand and the wild-type enzyme occur between the side chains of Asn187and the 6′-OH of the sugar, between both Ser132 and Tyr157 and the 4′-OH of the sugar, and finally, between the carbonyl group of Lys92 and the 3′-OH of the carbohydrate. These interactions are completely missing in the V94M enzyme with bound UDP-GlcNAc, where the hydroxyl groups simply form hydrogen bonds with solvent molecules. In summary, the x-ray studies described here provide a three-dimensional understanding of one example of severe epimerase deficiency galactosemia. In the normal enzyme, the hydrophobic side chain of Val94 provides a “molecular fence” to prevent sugar rotation out of the active site pocket, thereby preventing nonproductive binding. Upon substitution of Val94 by a methionine, the loop region connecting the fourth β-strand to the fourth α-helix of the Rossmann fold becomes disordered, adopts multiple conformations, and effectively opens up the sugar binding pocket to allow for free rotation of the sugar moiety in the active site and/or nonproductive substrate binding. In light of the structural results presented here, it is not surprising that the V94M mutation effects Vmax significantly more thanKm. Most of the binding interactions for the UDP-sugar substrates occur between the protein and the nucleotide, and these are not disrupted by the mutation. What the V94M substitution does, however, is allow the carbohydrate portions of the UDP-sugars to rotate freely, thereby limiting the time the ligand is bound in a productive mode near Oγ of Ser132 and Oη of Tyr157. As such,Vmax is severely affected. Interestingly, in previous work, it has been shown that the V94M epimerase is impaired to a 5-fold lesser extent with regard to UDP-GalNAc than to UDP-galactose (9Wohlers T.M. Christacos N.C. Harreman M.T. Fridovich-Keil J.L. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 462-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The reason is, presumably, that the bulkier sugar moieties of UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GalNAc can adopt fewer nonproductive binding modes. We are grateful to Drs. Dale Edmondson and Paige Newton-Vinson for generously allowing and helping us to use the fermenter and to Dr. W. W. Cleland for helpful discussions."

NF-κB translocation to the nucleus and activation are most frequently achieved through the signal-induced proteolytic degradation of IκB in the cytoplasm. Two kinases, IKKα and IKKβ, which are contained in a high-molecular-weight multiprotein complex, show inducible IκB kinase activity and play a key role in NF-κB activation by a variety of stimuli (16DiDonato J.A.

Despite their high sequence similarity, IKKα and IKKβ have different regulatory and functional roles. In mice lacking IKKβ, the activation of NF-κB by cytokines is abolished, and mouse embryos die on days 12–13 of gestation due to massive liver apoptosis (20Li Q. Antwerp D.V. Mercurio F. Lee K.F. Verma I.M. Science. 1999; 284: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). In contrast, IKKα is dispensable for pro-inflammatory responses, but plays an essential role in embryonic development. Mice lacking IKKα exhibit defective proliferation and differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes and defective limb and skeletal patterning (21Hu Y. Baud V. Delhase M. Zhang P. Deerinck T.

We report here that IκBα phosphorylation at Ser-32 and Ser-36 is required for both IGF-II-dependent NF-κB activation and differentiation in L6E9 myoblasts. We show that IKKα is involved in IGF-II-dependent multinucleated myotube formation and muscle-specific gene expression, whereas IKKβ is not essential for these processes. Our data suggest that NIK activation triggers myogenin expression and multinucleated myotube formation in the absence of IGF-II. IGF-II was kindly given by Lilly. The rat skeletal muscle cell line L6E9 was kindly provided by Dr. B. Nadal-Ginard (Harvard University). Low-passage 293 cells were from Microbix (Ontario, Canada). The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 was from BIOMOL Research Labs Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). The NF-κB probe for electrophoretic mobility shift assay was kindly given by Dr. Jean-François Peyron (INSERM U364, Nice, France).

Karin (University of California, San Diego, CA). Recombinant adenoviral vectors expressing IκBα(S32A/S36A), kinase-proficient FLAG-tagged NIK, LacZ, and green fluorescent protein (GFP) were provided by Dr. Yibin Wang (University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD). Polyclonal antibodyC38320 raised against caveolin-3 was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Mouse monoclonal antibody MF20, which stains all sarcomeric myosin heavy chain isoforms, and mouse anti-rat myogenin monoclonal antibody F5D were from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank. Polyclonal antibodies against IκBα (C-15), IKKα, IKKβ, and NIK were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-β-actin (clone AC-15) and anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibodies were from Sigma. Rat L6E9 myoblasts were cultured as described previously (5Kaliman P. Viñals F. Testar X. Palacı́n M. Zorzano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 146-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Subconfluent myoblasts were differentiated by serum depletion in DMEM plus antibiotics with or without IGF-II (40 nm) in the absence or presence of other compounds, as indicated for each experiment. Cells were photographed after staining the nuclei with Mayer's hemalum solution for microscopy (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and cell fusion was quantified by counting nuclei in myotubes from a total of at least 1000 nuclei from 10–20 randomly selected microscope fields for each condition. For adenoviral transduction, subconfluent L6E9 myoblasts were transduced at a multiplicity of 50–100 particles/cell and then cultured for an additional 36 h before inducing differentiation with or without IGF-II. To compare the impact of IKKα and IKKβ on myoblast differentiation, experimental conditions were selected to ensure similar levels of expression of IKKα and IKKβ constructs (data not shown). Recombinant adenoviruses expressing FLAG-tagged versions of either wild-type or dominant-negative mutant K44A human IKKα and IKKβ were generated by homologous recombination as described by Graham and Prevec (38Graham F.L. Prevec L. Mol. Biotechnol. 1995; 3: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). cDNAs were cloned into the shuttle plasmid pAdl1/RSV and cotransfected with pJM17 into 293 cells to achieve homologous recombination. Individual plaques were isolated and checked for recombinant protein expression after infection of 293 cells. Recombinant adenoviruses were further amplified in 293 cells; purified by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation; dialyzed against 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), and 10% glycerol; and stored at −80 °C (39Wang Y. Huang S. Sah V.P. Ross Jr., J. Brown J.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2161-2168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Viral stocks were titrated by infecting 293 cells with serial dilutions of the preparation and observing the cytopathic effect on the cells 48 h after infection. An infectious titer was given assuming that a multiplicity of infection of 10 is required to cause a complete cytopathic effect at 48 h. In addition, theA260 of the preparation was measured to estimate the particle titer (1 A260 unit = 1012 particles/ml). Cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 6 mm EGTA, 15 mm Na4P2O7, 20 mm NaF, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% aprotinin supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40. Cell extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and 50 μg of the solubilized proteins was loaded. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis were performed as described previously (5Kaliman P. Viñals F. Testar X. Palacı́n M. Zorzano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 146-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Cells were washed in PBS and resuspended at 106 cells/10 μl in hypotonic solution (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.8), 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 15 mmNa4P2O7, 20 mm NaF, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% aprotinin). After 10 min at 4 °C, Nonidet P-40 was added to 1%, and cells were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant containing the cytoplasmic fraction was recovered. For immunoprecipitation, antibodies were preadsorbed on protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C for 1 h and washed twice in hypotonic solution and 1% Nonidet P-40 before being incubated with the protein extracts for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunopellets were washed six times in the same buffer and once in kinase buffer (20 mmHepes, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μmNa3VO4, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm NaCl (pH 7.5)). Kinase reactions were carried out for 30 min at 30 °C using 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and GST-IκBα-(1–54) as substrate (except for NIK kinase assays, in which autophosphorylation of immunoprecipitated NIK was analyzed). The reaction products were analyzed on 10% polyacrylamide gels and revealed by autoradiography. NF-κB DNA-binding activity was analyzed in total cell extracts made in Totex lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, 350 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% aprotinin) (10Kaliman P. Canicio J. Testar X. Palacı́n M. Zorzano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17437-17444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Supernatants from a 15-min 10,000 × g centrifugation were collected. The NF-κB probe was a synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the NF-κB-binding site of the interleukin-2 gene promoter (5′-GATCCAAGGGACTTTCCATG-3′). Samples (70 μg) were incubated for 10 min at 4 °C with 30 ng of poly(dI·dC) and 5 μl of 5× reaction buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, and 0.4 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA) in a final volume of 25 μl. The end-labeled probe was added for a further incubation of 25 min at 25 °C. The specificity of the bands detected was verified by adding a 10–100-fold excess of competing unlabeled NF-κB probe. NF-κB-unrelated oligonucleotide probe controls did not show any specific binding activity (data not shown). Cells grown on coverslips were fixed for 20 min with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed three times in PBS, and then treated as follows: (a) 10 min in PBS containing 50 mm NH4Cl, (b) 10 min in PBS containing 20 mm glycine, and (c) 30 min in PBS containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Subsequently, coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-NIK polyclonal antibodies, 1 μg/ml; anti-myogenin monoclonal antibody, undiluted culture supernatant) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing in PBS, coverslips were incubated with fluorochrom-conjugated antibodies (Oregon Green or Texas Red) for 45 min. Cells were washed three times in PBS and then mounted in immunofluor medium (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Aurora, OH). Images were obtained using a Leica TCS 4D laser confocal fluorescence microscope with a 40× objective. IGF-II induces NF-κB DNA-binding activity as an early event during L6E9 myoblast differentiation (10Kaliman P. Canicio J. Testar X. Palacı́n M. Zorzano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17437-17444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Most extracellular stimuli that activate the NF-κB pathway induce phosphorylation of the NF-κB repressor IκBα at Ser-32 and Ser-36 as a requisite for its degradation (19Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). However, alternative pathways for NF-κB activation have been described (26Imbert V. Rupec R.A. Livolsi A. Pahl H.L. Traenckner E.B.M. Mueller-Dieckmann C. Farahifar D. Rossi B. Auberger P. Baeuerle P.A. Peyron J.F. Cell. 1996; 86: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 27Li N. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13012-13017Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). To analyze the mechanism required by IGF-II for NF-κB activation during differentiation, L6E9 myoblasts were transduced with an adenovirus expressing an IκBα mutant with Ser-32 and Ser-36 replaced by alanine residues (adv/IκBα(S32A/S36A)). This mutant inhibits NF-κB in pathways involving serine phosphorylation and subsequent proteasome degradation of IκBα. L6E9 myoblasts differentiated for 24 h with IGF-II exhibited an induction of NF-κB DNA-binding activity (Fig. 1 A), which was blocked in myoblasts overexpressing IκBα(S32A/S36A) (Fig. 1 B). Myoblasts infected with an adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein (adv/GFP) were used as control (Fig. 1 B). Next, we analyzed the impact of IκBα phosphorylation on IGF-II-dependent myoblast differentiation. After 4 days of IGF-II treatment, the expression of muscle-specific proteins such as myosin heavy chain and caveolin-3 was highly decreased in myoblasts overexpressing the IκBα(S32A/S36A) mutant (50 ± 12%,n = 3) compared with non-transduced control cells or cells transduced with adv/GFP, whereas the expression of the non-muscle-specific protein β-actin was similar under all conditions (Fig. 1 C). Moreover, cells overexpressing the IκBα(S32A/S36A) mutant did not fuse to myotubes, whereas control cells (adv/GFP) showed 82% of the nuclei in myotubes from a total of 1661 nuclei randomly counted (Fig. 1 D). These data suggest that IGF-II requires NF-κB activation through a mechanism that involves IκBα phosphorylation to trigger skeletal muscle cell differentiation. The data presented above indicating that IκBα phosphorylation was required by IGF-II to induce myoblast differentiation led us to analyze the activity and expression of IKKα and IKKβ during this process. L6E9 myoblasts exhibited a peak of IKKα activity after 24 h in IGF-II-containing differentiation medium (Fig.2 A, upper panel). The kinetics of IKKα activation was consistent with that of IGF-II-dependent NF-κB DNA-binding activation, which we have previously shown to be dependent on PI3K activity (10Kaliman P. Canicio J. Testar X. Palacı́n M. Zorzano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17437-17444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To analyze whether IGF-II-dependent IKKα activation involves PI3K, L6E9 myoblast differentiation was induced with or without IGF-II in the absence or presence of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. The PI3K inhibitor (20 μm) blocked the ability of IKKα to phosphorylate GST-IκBα-(1–54) in response to IGF-II (Fig. 2 B,upper panel). Neither IGF-II nor LY294002 altered IKKα protein expression (Fig. 2 C, upper panel); however, the 24-h delay between the start of the IGF-II treatment and the activation of IKKα seemed to indicate that IKKα was not the direct target of the IGF-induced phosphorylation cascade. This appears to be the case, as IKKα activation by IGF-II was blocked in the presence of 5 μg/ml cycloheximide (Fig. 2 D, upper panel, CH), indicating that it depends on de novo protein synthesis. Phosphorylation of the GST-IκBα-(1–54) substrate by IKKβ was also induced 24 h after triggering differentiation with IGF-II (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). IKKβ activation by IGF-II was blocked by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Fig. 2 B,lower panel). Neither IGF-II nor LY294002 treatment modified the level of IKKβ expression in differentiating myoblasts (Fig.2 C, middle panel), indicating that changes in activity are caused by activation of the kinase rather than variations in IKKβ protein content. As for IKKα, the activation of IKKβ by IGF-II was blocked by cycloheximide (Fig. 2 D, lower panel). To determine whether the activation of IKKs by IGF-II is functionally linked to myogenic differentiation, we generated replication-deficient adenoviral vectors expressing FLAG-tagged wild-type (adv/FLAG-IKKα and adv/FLAG-IKKβ) or dominant-negative (adv/FLAG-IKKα(K44A) and adv/FLAG-IKKβ(K44A) forms of IKKα and IKKβ. Subconfluent L6E9 myoblasts were transduced with the different recombinant adenoviruses using adv/GFP as a control; and 36 h later, differentiation was induced by placing the cells in an IGF-II-containing medium. Expression and kinase activity of the transduced proteins were evaluated 24 h after inducing differentiation with IGF-II. Cells transduced with adv/FLAG-IKKα exhibited GST-IκBα-(1–54) phosphorylation activity in immunoprecipitates with an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, whereas no specific IκBα phosphorylation activity was detected in immunoprecipitates from cells transduced either with adv/GFP or adv/FLAG-IKKα(K44A) (Fig.3 A, upper panel). Under these conditions, similar levels of wild-type and dominant-negative forms of IKKα were expressed, as verified by immunoblotting using anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 3 A,lower panel). After 4 days of differentiation in the presence of IGF-II, cells overexpressing FLAG-IKKα(K44A) remained highly undifferentiated, as measured by caveolin-3 and myosin heavy chain expression, compared with cells transduced with either adv/GFP or adv/FLAG-IKKα. The expression of the non-muscle-specific protein β-actin was not altered by FLAG-IKK(K44A) overexpression (Fig.3 B). To analyze the role of IKKβ activity in myoblast differentiation, cells were transduced with adv/FLAG-IKKβ or adv/FLAG-IKKβ(K44A). Both proteins were expressed to similar levels as detected on anti-FLAG immunoblots (Fig. 3 C, lower panel), and adv/FLAG-IKKβ(K44A)-transduced cells exhibited no IκBα kinase activity on anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates (upper panel). In contrast to IKKα, IKKβ does not seem to play an essential role in myoblast differentiation, as cells transduced with adv/FLAG-IKKβ(K44A) expressed skeletal muscle-specific proteins as efficiently as non-transduced cells or cells transduced with adv/GFP or adv/FLAG-IKKβ (Fig. 3 D). At the morphological level, overexpression of FLAG-IKKβ(K44A) did not alter the ability of myoblasts to fuse in response to IGF-II (78% of nuclei in myotubes from a total of 1488 nuclei randomly counted) compared with non-transduced control cells (78%, total of 1616), cells transduced with adv/GFP (82%, total of 1661), or cells transduced with adv/FLAG-IKKβ (80%, total of 1011) (Fig.4; arrows show large accumulations of nuclei in myotubes). Conversely, when FLAG-IKKα(K44A) was overexpressed, only thin, spindle-like myotubes were formed compared with the large myotubes observed in non-transduced cells, cells transduced with adv/GFP, or cells transduced with adv/FLAG-IKKα (Fig. 4). Indeed, after 4 days in IGF-II-containing differentiation medium, only 25% of the nuclei (total of 1367) in cells overexpressing FLAG-IKKα(K44A) were in myotubes with >10 nuclei. Under the same culture conditions, 77% of the nuclei from cells overexpressing FLAG-IKKα (total of 2987) were in myotubes with >10 nuclei. Taken together, these results suggest that IKKα plays a relevant role in IGF-II-dependent morphological and biochemical differentiation of skeletal muscle cells, whereas IKKβ is not essential to this process. NIK is a common mediator in the NF-κB signaling cascades, and IKKα has been reported to be a better substrate than IKKβ for phosphorylation by NIK (24Ling L. Cao Z. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3792-3797Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The endogenous kinase activity and protein expression of NIK in differentiating L6E9 myoblasts were studied. Induction of NIK autophosphorylation activity was detected after 24 h in IGF-II-containing differentiation medium (Fig.5 A). As observed for NF-κB DNA-binding activation (10Kaliman P. Canicio J. Testar X. Palacı́n M. Zorzano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17437-17444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and IKKα and IKKβ activities (Fig.2 B), the activation of NIK was totally blocked by LY294002, indicating that IGF-II requires PI3K to activate NIK in differentiating myoblasts (Fig. 5 A). No changes were detected in NIK protein expression in response to IGF-II or LY294002 (Fig. 5 B). As for IKKα and IKKβ, NIK activation by IGF-II was blocked by cycloheximide (Fig. 5 C), indicating that it requiresde novo protein synthesis. Interestingly, LY294002 inhibited NIK activation only when it was present together with IGF-II during the whole 24-h treatment. In contrast, when LY294002 was added during the last 6 h or the last 1 h of IGF-II incubation (at 18 or 23 h of differentiation, respectively), no inhibition of NIK activity was observed (Fig.5 D). These results suggest that PI3K is most probably involved in the de novo synthesis of the factor(s) required for NIK activation rather than being a direct upstream element of the NIK-activating cascade. To test whether the activation of NIK by IGF-II was a key event during differentiation, we transduced L6E9 myoblasts with recombinant adenovirus expressing kinase-proficient FLAG-tagged wild-type NIK that exhibited a high degree of basal autophosphorylation activity on anti-FLAG or anti-NIK immunoprecipitates (Fig.6 A; the lower bandthat was detected with anti-NIK antibodies in cells transduced with adv/FLAG-NIK is probably due to cross-activation of endogenous NIK by the overexpressed kinase). After 2 days in the absence of IGF-II (DMEM), myoblasts infected with control adv/GFP fused poorly (12% from a total of 1713 nuclei counted at random were found in multinucleated myotubes) (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, transduction with adv/FLAG-NIK promoted myoblast fusion (48% of nuclei in myotubes from a total of 1789 nuclei counted at random) (Fig. 6 B). Co-immunofluorescence assays showed that NIK-overexpressing cells highly expressed myogenin in their nuclei (Fig. 6 C). The number of nuclei expressing myogenin was 6-fold higher in cells overexpressing NIK (adv/NIK) than in control cells (adv/LacZ) (15 randomly selected fields were analyzed from each of two independent experiments with each condition performed in triplicate). We describe a pathway by which IGF-II modulates skeletal muscle cell differentiation through activation of the IKK complex. The activation of the NF-κB cascade (NIK, IKKα, and IKKβ activation; IκB degradation; and NF-κB DNA-binding activation) was detected 24 h after placing subconfluent myoblasts in IGF-II-containing differentiation medium. These are early events during the differentiation program induced by IGF-II, but they differ greatly in their kinetics compared with the rapid activation of this cascade, which can be detected within minutes of exposure of cells to cytokines or other stimuli. These observations indicate that IKK might not be a direct target of the IGF-induced phosphorylation cascade, an assumption reinforced by the fact that IGF-mediated IKK and NIK activation requires de novo protein synthesis. The nature of the factor(s) induced by IGF-II to trigger NF-κB cascade activation during myogenesis remains undefined. Among the possibilities to be considered is that IGF-II could induce the secretion of an autocrine factor by differentiating myoblasts. In this context, we did not detect expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (a classical activator of NF-κB) by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction studies in myoblasts induced to differentiate by IGF-II (data not shown). Another possibility is that the newly synthesized protein is a differentiation-induced kinase that may be a target for IGF-II itself or for an alternative factor generated in response to IGF-II. The involvement of NF-κB in myogenic signaling has been described in rat, human, and chick embryonic myoblasts (10Kaliman P. Canicio J. Testar X. Palacı́n M. Zorzano A. J. Biol.

J. 1997; 324: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), although differentiation of C2C12 skeletal muscle cells in a 2% horse serum-containing medium seems to occur through a signaling cascade in which NF-κB plays a negative regulatory role (30Denis C. Guttridge D.C. Albanese C. Reuther J.Y. Pestell R.G. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5785-5799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously established that PI3K, NF-κB, and inducible nitric-oxide synthase are elements of a common myogenic cascade in which IGF-II induces, through a PI3K-dependent pathway, a decrease in IκBα protein content that correlates with a decrease in the amount of IκBα associated with p65 NF-κB, NF-κB DNA-binding activation, and NO production (10Kaliman P.

A. 1999; 96: 2077-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and the role of PI3K in NF-κB cascade activation during myogenesis is reinforced by data presented here showing that activation of both NIK and IKK by IGF-II in differentiating myoblasts is blocked by inhibiting PI3K. PI3K is known to be directly involved in the activation of NF-κB in processes like anti-apoptotic platelet-derived growth factor signaling (31Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S. Nature. 1999; 401: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar) and tumor necrosis factor-mediated immune and inflammatory responses (32Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar). However, in view of our results, PI3K does not seem to directly activate NIK phosphorylation (LY294002 inhibited NIK activation only when it was present together with IGF-II during the whole 24-h treatment, but not during the last 6 h or the last 1 h). These data suggest that PI3K is most probably involved in the de novo synthesis of protein(s) required for NIK activation rather than being an upstream element in the activation of NIK. In contrast, our results do not rule out a biphasic role for IGF-II: first, in initiating the de novo synthesis of a NIK-activating factor and, second, in promoting NIK activation by the newly synthesized protein that (in view of the results presented in Fig. 5 D) could occur only through a PI3K-independent pathway. Although the stimuli that activate IKKβ and the substrates that mediate its biological activity are known, the stimuli and the relevant substrates for IKKα are less well characterized. IKKα and IKKβ appear to exert different and non-interchangeable physiological roles. Gene targeting experiments revealed that although IKKα is not involved in the activation of NF-κB by pro-inflammatory stimuli, it is involved in morphogenesis (20Li Q. Antwerp D.V. Mercurio F. Lee K.F. Verma I.M. Science. 1999; 284: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 21Hu Y. Baud V. Delhase M. Zhang P. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M.

Science. 1999; 284: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). In this context, our results show that although IGF-II induced both IKKα and IKKβ activities early during the differentiation program, the overexpression of a kinase-deficient mutant of IKKβ did not alter the expression of muscle-specific proteins or the formation of multinucleated myotubes. The differentiation process was, however, blocked by a kinase-deficient mutant of IKKα, suggesting that endogenous IKKβ cannot substitute for IKKα in myogenic signaling. Interestingly, skeletal muscle poorly expresses IKKβ, whereas it is one of the tissues with the higher expression levels of IKKα (33Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). Proliferation precedes differentiation in IGF-stimulated myogenesis, and the opposing early and late effects of IGF during myogenesis are reflected in the phosphorylation state of the cell cycle regulatory retinoblastoma protein in skeletal myoblasts (34Engert J.C.

Then, a decrease in NF-κB activity followed by a decrease in cyclin D1 levels seems to be required to allow the exit from the cell cycle that precedes differentiation (3Andrés V. Walsh K. J.

A causative relation between NF-κB down-regulation and myogenesis was initially proposed, without considering that the NF-κB activity detected after 24 h in differentiation medium (even if it was lower than that observed during proliferation) could exert a myogenic role (36Lehtinen S.K. Rahkila P. Helenius M. Korhonen P. Salminen A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Indeed, this appears to be the case, as, consistent with data reported here, NF-κB activity was shown to be required by human, mouse, and chicken myoblasts to fuse (10Kaliman P. Canicio J. Testar X.

We show here that IGF-II-dependent differentiation triggers a delayed induction of the NF-κB-activating cascade, which requires PI3K activity and de novo synthesis of still undefined factors. Our data suggest that the activation of NIK and IKKα and the subsequent phosphorylation of IκBα at Ser-32 and Ser-36 are key events in skeletal muscle differentiation induced by IGF-II. We thank Drs.

Four proteins account for the major reactions occurring at the replication fork of bacteriophage T7 as follows: the gene 5 DNA polymerase and its processivity factor,Escherichia coli thioredoxin, the gene 2.5 single-stranded DNA-binding protein, and the gene 4 primase-helicase (1Richardson C.C. Cell. 1983; 33: 315-317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The activities of these replication proteins are coordinated by their physical interactions during replication, which serve to couple the synthesis of the leading strand with that of the lagging strand (2Lee J.

This stable protein-protein interaction could correspond to an interaction between the helicase bound to the lagging strand of the replication fork and the polymerase on the leading strand. As the replication fork moves along a DNA duplex, DNA primase periodically deposits short RNA primers at specific priming sequences on the lagging strand, triggering the synthesis of Okazaki fragments that are subsequently processed to form a continuous DNA strand (7Fuller C.W. Beauchamp B.B. Engler M.J. Lechner R.L. Matson S.W. Tabor S. White J.H. Richardson C.C. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1983; 47: 669-679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Baker T.A. Kornberg A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992: 471-510Google Scholar). In most DNA replication systems, a separate primase protein transiently interacts with the DNA helicase to initiate primer synthesis on the lagging strand. In E. coli, the strength of this interaction affects the frequency of priming and thereby sets the average length of Okazaki fragments (9Tougu K. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21398-21405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The primase and helicase activities of bacteriophage T7 are fused in a single polypeptide that assembles into a ring-shaped hexamer (10Patel S.S. Hingorani M.M. J. Biol.

The bifunctional primase-helicase unwinds DNA ahead of the replication fork, and it primes the discontinuous synthesis of the lagging strand of the replication fork. The short tetranucleotides synthesized by the primase domain of the primase-helicase are not extended by T7 DNA polymerase alone (13Nakai H. Richardson C.C. J. Biol.

It is not known how many subunits of the hexameric primase-helicase directly participate in the priming of DNA synthesis, nor is it known how the primase-helicase stimulates primer utilization by T7 DNA polymerase. The primase-helicase protein consists of an N-terminal primase domain and C-terminal helicase domain (12Egelman H.H., Yu, X. Wild R. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the primase domain alone does not support the extension of primers by T7 DNA polymerase (18Frick D.N. Baradaran K. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The dual requirement for the primase-helicase and the T7 DNA polymerase during RNA-primed synthesis of DNA suggests that these proteins associate in a complex that initiates the elongation of RNA primers synthesized by the primase (20Chowdhury K. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12469-12474Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The ring-shaped T7 primase-helicase catalyzes DNA unwinding by encircling one strand of DNA (12Egelman H.H., Yu, X. Wild R. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The vectorial movement of the protein on DNA is coupled to the hydrolysis of 2′-deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP) (25Matson S.W. Richardson C.C. J. Biol.

Crystal structures of the helicase domain of the primase-helicase (29Sawaya M.R. Guo S. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1999; 99: 167-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 30Singleton M.R. Sawaya M.R. Ellenberger T. Wigley D.B. Cell. 2000; 101: 589-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) revealed that the nucleotide-binding sites are located at the interfaces between subunits of the hexamer, where changes in the relative orientations of the subunits could influence the catalytic activities of the six potential active sites within the helicase. Three different relative orientations of adjacent subunits are observed in the hexameric helicase that was crystallized, and these different orientations affect the nucleotide binding properties of individual subunits (30Singleton M.R. Sawaya M.R. Ellenberger T. Wigley D.B. Cell. 2000; 101: 589-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). This conformational flexibility, together with previous biochemical and genetic data revealing the identities of functionally important residues and the cooperative behaviors of nucleotide binding and hydrolysis by the hexameric helicase, are the basis for several proposed mechanisms of DNA unwinding (30Singleton M.R. Sawaya M.R. Ellenberger T. Wigley D.B. Cell. 2000; 101: 589-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 31Hingorani M.M. Washington M.T. Moore K.C. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5012-5017Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In these models, nucleotide hydrolysis is coupled to changes in protein conformation and DNA binding affinity that allow the protein to step along DNA, not unlike other motor proteins that travel along protein filaments in response to nucleotide hydrolysis (32Waksman G. Lanka E. Carazo J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 20-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 33Lohman T.M. Thorn K. Vale R.D. Cell. 1998; 93: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Some aspects of the proposed mechanisms of DNA unwinding resemble those of the bind-change mechanism of rotary catalysis proposed for the mitochondrial F1-ATPase (34Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 35Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 2000; 355: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). There are currently few high resolution structures of primases, and none with substrates bound (36Keck J.L. Roche D.D. Lynch A.S. Berger J.M. Science. 2000; 287: 2482-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 37Pan H. Wigley D.B. Struct.

Biol. 2001; 8: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The DNA binding and catalytic properties of the T7 primase are well characterized, making it an attractive candidate for structural analysis. Like the intact primase-helicase, a primase fragment (residues 1–271) of the T7 primase-helicase catalyzes the template-dependent synthesis of RNA oligomers at specific priming sites as follows: 5′-(G/T)(G/T)GTC-3′ (18Frick D.N. Baradaran K. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 39Frick D.N. Kumar S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 35889-35898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), making predominantly pppAC, pppACC(C/A), and pppACAC. The conserved 3′-C of the priming sites is required for primer synthesis, but it is not copied into the RNA products. The tetraribonucleotides synthesized by an isolated primase fragment are bona fide primers that can be extended by T7 DNA polymerase, provided the intact primase-helicase protein is added during primer extension (18Frick D.N. Baradaran K. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The primase domain fragment of the T7 primase-helicase is monomeric even at very high protein concentrations, and its failure to support primer utilization by T7 DNA polymerase suggested that several subunits of the hexameric primase-helicase might cooperate to deliver tetranucleotide primers to the polymerase. Such cooperation could occur either by recruiting the polymerase through protein-protein interactions or by preventing dissociation of the RNA primer from the DNA template by sequestering the primer in a stable protein-DNA complex. A long lived complex of the primase-helicase and M13 single-stranded DNA forms in the presence of ribonucleotide substrates for primer synthesis (13Nakai H. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15217-15224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This primase-helicase-DNA complex most likely contains the ribonucleotide product of the primase annealed to DNA and ready for elongation by T7 DNA polymerase (14Kusakabe T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12446-12453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We wished to determine if a single subunit of the primase-helicase could provide all of the necessary DNA binding and protein contacts for priming synthesis of DNA by T7 DNA polymerase. In order to define the minimal requirements for primer utilization by T7 DNA polymerase, we have genetically engineered an altered primase-helicase that does not assemble into functional hexamers and therefore lacks DNA unwinding activity. We show that the monomeric primase physically associates with T7 DNA polymerase in a protein-DNA complex that initiates RNA-primed synthesis of DNA. The oligonucleotides used in these studies were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 394 DNA synthesizer and purified by high performance liquid chromatography using an HQ20 anion exchange column (Applied Biosystems) or by gel electrophoresis using 20% acrylamide, 7 m urea gels. The T7 primase-helicase and T7 DNA polymerase (a 1:1 complex of T7 gene 5 protein and E. coli thioredoxin) were purified by published procedures (41Notarnicola S.M. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27198-27207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Tabor S. Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16212-16223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A variant of T7 DNA polymerase with two amino acid substitutions in the active site of the 3′–5′-exonuclease (Asp-5 → Ala and Glu-7 → Ala; constructed by Stanley Tabor) was used for the assembly of stable protein-DNA complexes. This altered DNA polymerase has a wild-type level of DNA polymerase activity, but the exonuclease activity of the altered polymerase is reduced by a factor of 106 (43Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). We therefore refer to this modified polymerase as exo− T7 DNA polymerase. The primase fragment (residues 1–271) of the T7 primase-helicase was purified as described previously (18Frick D.N. Baradaran K. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). E. coli DH5α was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc., and E. coli BL21(DE3) was obtained from Novagen. M13 single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)1and restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs. dNTPs were purchased from Promega Corp. ATP, CTP, and all radiolabeled materials were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The diribonucleotide ApC was obtained from Sigmao. The ribonucleoside triphosphate pppApC was prepared as described under “Exonuclease III Protection Assay“ below. The mutant T7 gene 4 protein, gp4ΔD2D3, has the sequence SASASG substituted for residues 368–382 of the primase-helicase, and consequently, it is nine residues shorter than the wild-type protein (Fig. 1). This amino acid substitution eliminates two α-helices (helices D2 and D3) located at the subunit interface of the helicase domain of the primase-helicase (29Sawaya M.R. Guo S. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1999; 99: 167-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 30Singleton M.R. Sawaya M.R. Ellenberger T. Wigley D.B. Cell. 2000; 101: 589-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) and thus should prevent the formation of the hexamer. An expression plasmid for gp4ΔD2D3 was constructed by cloning aBsaI-AflII fragment containing the desired modifications from the plasmid m4D1 (encoding a C-terminal fragment of the gene 4 protein, provided by Leo Guo, Harvard Medical School) into an expression plasmid for the full-length primase-helicase, pETgp4A′-A (obtained from David Frick, Harvard Medical School). The resulting plasmid, pGP4ΔD2D3, is based on the pET24a vector (Novagen Inc.), and it places the gene encoding the modified primase-helicase under control of a T7 promoter with a binding site for the lac repressor, which in turn suppresses background expression of protein prior to induction. Codon 64 of the gp4ΔD2D3 coding sequence has been changed from methionine to a glycine codon in order to prevent internal initiation of translation at codon 64 (44). A 5-ml overnight culture ofE. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with the pGP4ΔD2D3 expression plasmid was inoculated into 1 liter of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing 60 μg/ml kanamycin and was shaken at 37 °C for about 6 h until the culture reached anA 600 of ∼2.0. The culture flasks were then chilled on ice for 15 min; isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and the induced cultures were incubated with shaking at 10 °C for an additional 18 h. The cells did not grow during incubation at 10 °C, yet the gp4ΔD2D3 protein was expressed as a mixture of soluble and insoluble protein. The soluble protein accounted for ∼10% of the total gp4ΔD2D3 produced. Protein expression at 22 or 37 °C resulted in higher levels of gp4ΔD2D3 expression, but all of the protein was insoluble in native buffers. After overnight induction at 10 °C, the cells (25 g wet weight) were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 120 ml of lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The suspended cells were lysed by sonication. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 49,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant (fraction I) was collected for purification of gp4ΔD2D3. About 90% of the gp4ΔD2D3 precipitated in the cell lysate, and no attempt was made to resuspend this insoluble material. 7.7 g of ammonium sulfate was added to 145 ml of fraction I (10% saturation), and the solution was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. To the supernatant, ammonium sulfate (24.5 g, 40% saturation) was again added with stirring, and the solution was centrifuged as before. The resulting pellet containing the gp4ΔD2D3 protein (fraction II) was resuspended in 100 ml of Buffer A (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm DTT) and again centrifuged at 49,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. The clarified fraction II was loaded on a DEAE-Sepharose column (4.9 cm2 × 15 cm) and washed with 100 ml of Buffer A. The DEAE column was then eluted with a 400-ml gradient of NaCl (0–400 mm) in Buffer A. The fractions containing gp4ΔD2D3 were identified by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue G-250 staining and then pooled (72 ml, fraction III). Fraction III was diluted to 180 ml with Buffer A to decrease the salt concentration, and then it was applied in 2 equal aliquots to a Mono Q column (0.79 cm2 × 10 cm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The Mono Q column was washed with 20 ml of Buffer A and then eluted with a 120-ml gradient of NaCl (0–400 mm NaCl) in Buffer A. The fractions containing gp4ΔD2D3 were combined from both Mono Q separations (50 ml, fraction IV), diluted to 200 ml with Buffer A, and loaded onto two 5-ml Hi-Trap heparin-Sepharose columns (2 cm2 × 2.5 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) connected in series. After washing the heparin-Sepharose with 50 ml of Buffer A, the proteins were eluted with a 120-ml gradient of NaCl (0–400 mm) in Buffer A. The fractions containing gp4ΔD2D3 were combined, and the protein was precipitated by adding ammonium sulfate to 60% saturation and then resuspended in 2 ml of Buffer A (fraction V). Fraction V was loaded onto a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (5.3 cm2 × 60 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been equilibrated with Buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl. gp4ΔD2D3 eluted from the gel filtration column at the position of a 66-kDa protein standard, consistent with the monomeric protein. The purified fractions containing gp4ΔD2D3 were combined (45 ml, fraction VI) and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centriprep; Amicon Inc.) to a protein concentration of ∼20 mg/ml in Buffer A plus 100 mm NaCl. gp4ΔD2D3 purified from the soluble fraction of the cell lysate shows no signs of aggregation. The concentrated protein was used immediately or diluted 2-fold with glycerol (50% v/v final concentration) and stored at −20 °C. gp4ΔD2D3 prepared by this procedure is typically more than 95% pure, as judged by Coomassie Blue G-250 staining of the protein sample after SDS-PAGE. The purification procedure typically results in a yield of 2 mg of pure gp4ΔD2D3 per liter of culture. Native PAGE was performed in a 15% acrylamide Tris-glycine gel (Bio-Rad) with a Mini-PROTEAN II electrophoresis system (Bio-Rad). The electrophoresis buffer was 25 mm Tris-HCl, 190 mm glycine, 5 mmMgCl2, with 1 mm ATP added to stabilize the hexameric form of the primase-helicase (10Patel S.S. Hingorani M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10668-10675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Guo S. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30303-30309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Protein samples (10 μm monomer) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β, γ-methylene ATP (AMP-PCP, to stabilize the hexamer), and 40% glycerol were incubated on ice for 30 min before loading on the gel and electrophoresing the samples for 4 h at 150 V at an ambient temperature of 4 °C. The proteins were visualized after electrophoresis by staining the gel with Coomassie Blue G-250. The dTTPase activity of the helicase domain of the primase-helicase is a sensitive indicator of hexamer formation (19Guo S. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30303-30309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) because the active site of the helicase is located at the interface between subunits of the hexamer (29Sawaya M.R. Guo S. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Cell. 1999; 99: 167-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of dTTP was monitored using thin layer chromatography as described previously (11Notarnicola S.M. Park K. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20215-20224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The 10-μl reaction mixture contained 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 5 mm dTTP (including 5 μCi of [3H] dTTP), and the indicated concentrations of the wild-type primase-helicase or of gp4ΔD2D3. The hydrolysis reactions were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C and stopped by adding 5 μl of 500 mm EDTA. One microliter of the reaction was spotted on a cellulose polyethyleneimine plate (J. T. Baker Inc.), which was subsequently developed with 1m formic acid and 0.8 m LiCl for 1 h. After drying the gel, the separated substrate and products were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by densitometry. The helicase activity of the T7 primase-helicase was measured with two different assays, either by monitoring the enzymatic separation of two DNA strands (27Matson S.W. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14017-14024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by its ability to support DNA replication in a rolling circle DNA replication reaction (2Lee J. Chastain P.D. Kusakabe T. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). DNA strand separation activity was monitored as the dissociation of a 5′-32P-labeled 37-mer oligonucleotide (5′-TCACGACGTTGTAAAACGACGGCCAGTTTTTTTTTTT-3′) annealed to M13 ssDNA (11Notarnicola S.M. Park K. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20215-20224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The oligo(dT) sequence at the 3′ end of the oligonucleotide is not complementary to M13 ssDNA, which allows the primase-helicase to load onto the M13 DNA at the junction between single-stranded and double-stranded regions. The helicase catalyzed strand separation in a 5′–3′ direction along the circular M13 DNA template. The 10-μl reaction mixture contained 40 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 50 μg/ml BSA, 5 mm dTTP, 20 ng/μl DNA substrate (described above), and the indicated concentrations of the primase-helicase. The mixture was incubated for 15 min at 23 °C, and then the reaction was stopped by adding 2 μl of 500 mm EDTA. The samples were loaded on the 15% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel with TBE buffer (90 mm Tris-HCl, 90 mm borate, 2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)) and electrophoresed at 300 V for 2 h at an ambient temperature of 4 °C. The amounts of radiolabeled oligonucleotide remaining annealed to the substrate or in the dissociated product strand were visualized by autoradiography. We also examined the ability of the primase-helicase to stimulate DNA synthesis by T7 DNA polymerase on a duplex DNA template in a reaction that requires DNA strand separation by the helicase (2Lee J. Chastain P.D. Kusakabe T. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1001-1010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The DNA template for this assay was a circular 70-nucleotide DNA template annealed to an oligonucleotide with a 3′-hydroxyl annealed to the template and an unpaired 5′ end that facilitates the loading of the primase-helicase onto DNA (Fig. 4, inset). The sequence of this substrate was designed to identify and quantitate specifically the leading strand synthesis that is linked to the DNA unwinding by measuring the incorporation of [α-32P]dGMP into DNA. The DNA replication reaction (25 μl) contained 40 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml BSA, 50 mm potassium glutamate, 0.6 mm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, with 333 mCi/mmol [α-32P]dGTP, 100 nm DNA template, 80 nm T7 DNA polymerase, and the indicated concentrations of the T7 primase-helicase or gp4ΔD2D3. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C, and 4-μl aliquots were removed at 1-min intervals and quenched immediately by the addition of EDTA. The amounts of DNA synthesized were measured by spotting the reaction aliquots onto DE81 filters, washing the filters 3 times with 0.3m ammonium formate (pH 8.0), and measuring the bound radioactivity by scintillation counting.

However, in rodents, several organs of normal adult animals express substantial amounts of telomerase activity. To elucidate relevant control mechanisms operating on the tissue-specific expression of telomerase in rodents, we examined the transcriptional regulation of telomerase reverse transcriptase (mTERT) gene in muscle cell differentiation. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the reduction of telomerase activity was caused by the decrease of mTERT mRNA level during myogenesis. Transfections of mTERT promoter showed that the proximal 225-base pair region is the core promoter responsible for basal transcriptional activity and also participates in the reduced transcription after muscle differentiation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that this region contained the GC-boxes, which bind to Sp1 family proteins, and the E-box, which binds to c-Myc. Furthermore, DNA binding activities of Sp1, Sp3, and c-Myc were down-regulated during myogenesis. These data suggest that Sp1, Sp3, and c-Myc have critical roles of TERT transactivation in mouse, and the lack of these transcription factors cause down-regulation of mTERT gene expression in muscle cells differentiation.

In vertebrates, they consist of tandem hexanucleotide repeats, (TTAGGG)n, maintained by a specialized ribonucleoprotein enzyme, called telomerase, which adds motif-specific nucleotides using its RNA subunit as a template. Recently, three major telomerase subunits have been identified. The telomerase RNA component provides the template for telomere repeat synthesis (2Blasco M.A. Funk W. Villeponteau B. Greider C.W.

Blasco M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10471-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that TERT is expressed in most malignant tumors but not in normal human tissues and that expression of TERT is closely associated with telomerase activity, whereas two other components are constitutively expressed in both tumors and normal tissues (8Greenberg R.A. Allsopp R.C. Chin L. Morin G.B. DePinho R.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1723-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 9Takakura M. Kyo S. Kanaya T. Tanaka M. Inoue M. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1558-1561PubMed Google Scholar). These findings indicate that TERT is a rate-limiting determinant of catalytic activity of telomerase. Analysis of the human and mouse TERT promoters reveals that they are regulated by a number of inducible transcription factors, including c-Myc and NF-κB (10Takakura M. Kyo S. Kanaya T. Hirano H.

These transcription factors are likely to contribute to the observed instances of TERT gene activation. Most telomerase-positive cells are highly regenerative or immortal. Among normal tissues of adult humans, telomerase activity was almost undetectable except germ line cells, although very small amounts of activity are detectable in normal bone marrow, peripheral blood leukocytes, lymphoid cells, and skin epidermis (15Broccoli D. Young J.W. de Lange T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9082-9086Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 16Hiyama K. Hirai Y. Kyoizumi S. Akiyama M. Hiyama E. Piatyszek M.A. Shay J.W.

Genet. 1996; 18: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). In contrast, highly regenerative tissues of normal rodents express modest levels of telomerase even in adult animals (19Yamaguchi Y. Nozawa K. Savoysky E. Hayakawa N. Nimura Y. Yoshida S. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 20Nozawa K. Kurumiya Y. Yamamoto A. Isobe Y. Suzuki M. Yoshida S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 126: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the normal mouse, telomerase activity exists in colon, liver, ovary, and testis but not in brain, heart, stomach, and muscle (21Prowse K.R. Greider C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4818-4822Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 22Chadeneau C. Siegel P. Harley C.B. Muller W.J. Bacchetti S. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 893-898PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, cell differentiation causes reduced telomerase activity in some kinds of cell types such as murine F9 teratocarcinoma and C2C12 myoblast cells (23Bestilny L.J. Brown C.B. Miura Y. Robertson L.D. Riabowol K.T. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3796-3802PubMed Google Scholar, 24Holt S.E. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2932-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). These results suggest that this remarkable difference among various tissues in mouse may reflect the different regulation mechanisms of telomerase expression, which may cause the tissue-specific features of differentiation and proliferation. However, the detailed mechanisms that contribute to the telomerase expression during development and cell differentiation in mouse are largely unknown. In this study, to understand the mechanisms that reduce mTERT gene expression during muscle cell differentiation, we constructed a series of reporter plasmids containing the 5′-franking sequence of mTERT gene and transfected these constructs into mouse cell lines, including C2C12 myoblasts. Transcriptional activity of mTERT was dependent on the proximal 225-bp region of promoter, and this promoter region contained E-boxes and GC-boxes, which bind to bHLH proteins and Sp1 family proteins, respectively. We attempted to identify the transcription factors directing mTERT expression and found that Sp1, Sp3, and c-Myc, but not MyoD, play crucial roles in the regulation of mTERT transcription during muscle cell differentiation. Cell culture reagents and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Antibodies were from the following sources: anti-c-Myc, anti-MyoD, anti-Sp1, and anti-Sp3 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin G from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Sp1 and c-Myc consensus oligonucleotides were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts, C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts, and C2C12 myoblasts were obtained from Riken Cell Bank (Tukuba, Japan) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (standard medium). In some experiments, subconfluent C2C12 cells were induced to differentiate by lowering fetal bovine serum to final concentration of 0.5% (differentiation medium). Total cytoplasmic RNA was isolated using the guanidine isothiocyanate method from the cells that were cultured in standard medium or differentiation medium for 1, 4, 7, or 10 days. Samples of 20 μg of total RNA were denatured, separated by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde, and transferred to GeneScreen membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The membranes were prehybridized and then hybridized with cDNA probes labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random primer labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK). After hybridization, the membranes were washed and exposed to x-ray film. All blots were rehybridized with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probe to normalize for mRNA loading differences. To quantify the contents of mRNA in the cells, the membranes were exposed to imaging plates and radioactivities were measured with a bioimage analyzer, Fijix BAS 1500 (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). The RT-PCR primers, 5′-AGACTSCGCTTCATCCCCAAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTCTGGAGGCTGTTCACCTGC-3′ (antisense), were constructed according to the mouse TERT cDNA (GenBank™ accession numberAF073311) (7Martin-Rivera L. Herrera E. Albar J.P. Blasco M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10471-10476Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from C2C12 cells as described above. First-strand cDNA was synthesized with 1 μg of total RNA using a First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) in the presence of 1.6 μg of oligo-(dT)2 primer in a final volume of 25 μl. After denaturation for 5 min at 94 °C, 4 μl of reaction product was amplified by PCR for 29 cycles (94 °C for 30 s; 55 °C for 30 s; 72 °C for 1 min). The amplified products were separated by electrophoresis on either a 2% agarose gel or 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and visualized with ethidium bromide. The DNA sequences of RT-PCR products were confirmed at least once by DNA sequencing and were found to be identical to the corresponding sequence of mouse TERT cDNA (nucleotides 1857–2975, data not shown). Each RT-PCR was performed three times with independent preparations of RNA, and typical results are shown in Fig. 1. As an internal control, RT-PCR of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was performed for all RNA samples, using the PCR primers, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′ (antisense). The linearity of RT-PCR with respect to RNA amount was determined, and the estimation of mRNA for mTERT was done within a linear range. C2C12 cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped off, and transferred to 1.5-ml microtubes. After centrifugation for 3 min at 1000 ×g at 4 °C, pellets were suspended in 500 μl of the wash buffer (pH 7.5) containing 10 mm HEPES, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and centrifuged again for 3 min at 1000 ×g at 4 °C. Whole cell extracts were prepared by suspending cells in 30 μl of CHAPS lysis buffer, containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% CHAPS, and 10% glycerol. Cell suspensions were subjected to three cycles of freezing and thawing using liquid nitrogen. After being placed on ice for 30 min, they were centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g and the supernatant was collected (CHAPS extracts). Three independent experiments were performed to measure telomerase activity of the cells cultured with differentiation medium. The TRAP (telomere repeat amplification protocol) assay was employed with minor modifications described by Kimet al. (25Kim N.W. Wu F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2595-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). The cell extract (representing 1 × 105 cells) was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 63 mm KCl, 0.005% Tween 20, 1 mm EGTA, 50 μm each of dATP, dGTP, dTTP, 10 μm dCTP, 2 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP, 0.1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 2 units of Taq DNA polymerase, 0.1 μg of TS primer (5′-AATCCGTCGAGCAGAGTT-3′), and 0.1 μg of ACX primer (5′-GCGCGGCTTACCCTTACCCTTACCCTAACC-3′). After the mixtures were heated at 94 °C for 90 s, they were subjected to 30 cycles of PCR amplification (one cycle consisting of 94 °C for 30 s and 58 °C for 45 s). After the reaction, PCR products were analyzed by 12.5% non-denaturing PAGE (1-mm thick). The gels were autoradiographed with the x-ray film (Hyperfilm MP, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK) at −80 °C for 2 h, and telomerase activity was assessed on incorporated radioactive substrate in ladders of product DNA, multiplies of 6 bases corresponding to the telomere repeat unit. The mouse TERT promoter-luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed by pGL3-basic vector (Promega, WI) and the DNA, which was obtained by PCR amplification using mouse genomic DNA according to a published sequence (GenBank™ accession number AF121949) (11Greenberg R.A. O'Hagan R.C. Deng H. Xiao Q. Hann S.R. Adams R.R. Lichtsteiner S. Chin L. Morin G.B. DePinho R.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1219-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Various lengths of DNA fragments upstream of the initiating ATG codon of the mTERT gene were amplified and inserted into the pGL3-basic vector. For the construction of reporter plasmids containing substitution mutations in transcription factor binding sites, site-specific mutagenesis was performed by a PCR-based protocol. Expression vector for c-Myc protein (pcDNA3-cMyc) encoding the full-length of c-Myc was a kind gift from Rónán C. O'Hagan and Ronald A. DePinho, Harvard Medical School (26O'Hagan R.C.

Expression vector pCGN-Sp1, encoding the full-length of human Sp1, and its backbone vector (pCGN) were kind gifts from Thomas Shenk, Princeton University (27Parks C.L. Shenk T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4417-4430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). pCGN-Sp3, encoding the full-length of Sp3, was described previously (28Xiao H. Hasegawa T. Isobe K. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). One microgram of mTERT promoter-luciferase expression plasmid and 0.5 μg of pSV2neo vector were cotransfected into C2C12 cells grown in a 12-well plate using SuperFect reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) as previously described (29Maehara K. Hasegawa T. Isobe K.I. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 474-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The transfected colonies were selected by 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 3 weeks. More than 50 colonies were pooled. Cell extracts were from the transfectants that were grown in the presence of 200 μg/ml G418 and differentiated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum with antibiotics and G418 for 10 days. Luciferase activity of these transfectants was normalized against the number of cells. A series of culture experiments were repeated at least three times. Transient transfection of luciferase reporter plasmids was carried out using SuperFect reagent (Qiagen) as previously described (29Maehara K. Hasegawa T. Isobe K.I. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 474-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In general, the day before transfection, cells were plated onto 12-well tissue culture plates at a density of 20,000 cells/well, supplemented with fresh medium before transfection. A total of 0.825 μg of DNA consisting of 0.75 μg of the indicated luciferase reporter plasmid and 0.075 μg of the pRL-thymidine kinase control vector (pRL-TK) (Promega, WI) per well was used for transfection studies. For cotransfection studies, cells grown in 12-well plates were transfected with 0.75 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid, 0.075 μg of pRL-TK, and 0.75 or 0.25 μg of the indicated expression plasmids. PCGN or pcDNA3 was used to adjust the total amount of expression plasmid DNA. After harvest, the cells were assayed by the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega, WI), using a luminometer (EG&G Berthold, Germany). Protein concentrations of the cell lysates were determined by the method of Bradford with the Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent (Bio-Rad, CA). Promoter activities were expressed as relative activities, normalized against the concentration of the protein. All transfection experiments were repeated at least three times. Nuclear extracts were prepared from the C2C12 cells that were cultured in differentiation medium for 1, 4, 7, or 10 days using the rapid preparation as previously described (29Maehara K. Hasegawa T. Isobe K.I. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 474-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations of the nuclear fractions were determined by the Bradford assay, and all extracts were stored at −70 °C. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed using 5 μg of nuclear extract from either untreated or differentiation medium-treated cells. Synthetic complementary oligonucleotides with a G overhang were annealed and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP, using the Klenow fragment. DNA binding reactions were performed as previously described (29Maehara K. Hasegawa T. Isobe K.I. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 474-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Molar excess (5-, 20-, 100-fold) of c-Myc, Sp1 consensus oligonucleotides, MyoD binding element, or oligonucleotides containing mutated sequences were used as an unlabeled competitor. The following pairs of oligonucleotides derived from the muscle creatine kinase promoter were used as MyoD binding oligonucleotides; 5′-GCCCCAACACCTGCTGCCTGA-3′ and 5′-GTCAGGCAGCAGGTGTTGGGG-3′ (30Puri P.L. Avantaggiati M.L. Balsano C. Sang N. Graessmann A. Giordano A. Levrero M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 369-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). For EMSAs using antibodies, nuclear extracts were preincubated with antibodies (0.2–0.4 μg per reaction) for 20 min at 4 °C. The reactions were separated on 7% or 6% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. The following pairs of oligonucleotides were used: E-201 containing the nucleotide −211 to −186; 5′-CCGGGGAACACACCTGGTCCTCATGC-3′, 5′-GCATGAGGACCAGGTGTGTTCCCCGG-3′, GC-88 containing the nucleotide −97 to −68; 5′-TTCCTCCGTTCCCAGCCTCATCTTTTTCGT-3′, 5′-ACGAAAAAGATGAGGCTGGGAACGGAGGAA-3′, GC-105 containing the nucleotide −116 to −88; 5′-TCCGCCTGAATCCCGCCCCTTCCTCCGTT-3′, 5′-AACGGAGGAAGGGGCGGGATTCAGGCGGA-3′, and GC-143 containing the nucleotide −153 to −125; 5′-ATTGCTGCGACCCCGCCCCTTCCGCTACA-3′, 5′-TGTAGCGGAAGGGGCGGGGTCGCAGCAAT-3′. The positions of each oligonucleotide are shown in Fig. 4. Cells cultured in differentiation medium for 1, 4, 7, and 10 days were lysed in a buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Each cell lysate containing 25 μg of protein was run under reducing conditions in 8% or 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels (SDS-PAGE), transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, MA), and reacted with antibodies as described. The primary antibody was detected by counterstaining with an HRP-linked antibody and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Nuclear extracts (20 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. C2C12 cells in culture were induced to differentiate by lowering serum concentration. Differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes was associated with a diminished activity of telomerase (Fig. 1 A), as observed previously (23Bestilny L.J. Brown C.B. Miura Y. Robertson L.D. Riabowol K.T. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3796-3802PubMed Google Scholar, 24Holt S.E. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2932-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). During the culture in differentiation medium, mTERT mRNA levels were also gradually decreased without changing the expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA level (Fig. 1 B). However, the culture in differentiation medium resulted in up-regulation of muscle-specific genes, MyoD or myogenin (Fig. 1 B), in agreement with previous reports (31Olson E.N. Klein W.H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 32Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2422) Google Scholar, 33Wright W.E. Sassoon D.A. Lin V.K.

Thus, the decrease of mTERT mRNA level was negatively correlated with the expressions of muscle-specific genes. These results indicate that the reduction of telomerase activity during myogenesis is regulated by the reduction of mTERT gene expression in C2C12. To understand the mechanisms of the mTERT expression in cell differentiation, analysis of the mTERT promoter is indispensable. As the first step, luciferase assays were performed using mouse NIH3T3 and C3H10T1/2 as well as C2C12 cell lines. These cell lines were transiently transfected with a series of 5′ terminus-truncated mutants of the mTERT promoter linked to the luciferase reporter gene. As shown in Fig.2, a 1.6-kb region of mTERT promoter (−1561/+53-Luc) demonstrated the significant transcriptional activities in all these cell lines. NIH3T3 and C3H10T1/2 conferred higher transcriptional activity than C2C12. C2C12 exhibited modest transcriptional activity equivalent to 30–40% of NIH3T3, but this activity was still significant, because it was 250-fold the activity in promoterless reporter plasmid (pGL3-basic). Although deletions from −1561 to −225 of mTERT gene promoter resulted in no significant alterations in luciferase activity, truncation of a further 166 base pairs (from −225 to −59) led to a remarkable reduction of the transcriptional activity in these three cell lines (Fig. 2). These findings suggest that the proximal 225 bp is the core promoter essential for basal transcriptional activation of mTERT. Subsequently, C2C12 cells were stably transfected with reporter plasmids and induced to differentiate by the culture in differentiation medium for 10 days. Transfectants with −1561/+53-Luc, −414/+53-Luc, or −225/+53-Luc reporter plasmids exhibited the reduction of transcriptional activities (Fig. 3), being consistent with the decrease of mTERT mRNA level in muscle cell differentiation (Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that the core promoter region (−225/+53) is also responsible for reduction of mTERT transcription in muscle cell differentiation. From these observations, we defined a 225-bp fragment as the mTERT minimal promoter and assumed that myogenesis-responsive elements are located in this region. According to data base analysis, we noticed that three GC clusters and two E-boxes are located in this region, which are known to bind with Sp1 family proteins and bHLH proteins, respectively (Fig. 4). To examine the role of these cis-elements more precisely, luciferase assays were performed with reporter plasmids with site-specific mutants, which were introduced into the mTERT minimal promoter (Fig.5). One E-box is located at the 5′-end of the minimal promoter, and the deletion of this site resulted in a 50% reduction in transcriptional activity in C2C12 cells, as shown in Fig.2 (−225/+53-Luc and −185/+53-Luc). Abrogation of this E-box (E-201) by substitution mutations also led to a 50% reduction of transcriptional activity (Fig. 5, Ebox-mt #1), suggesting that this E-box is essential for transactivation. In contrast, the mutation of another E-box (E-4) that is adjacent to the transcription start site led to no significant alteration of transcriptional activity (Ebox-mt #2). Although a mutation in the GC-box (GC-88) at −88 bp of minimal promoter slightly increased transcriptional activity (GC-mt #3), the mutations in the other two GC-boxes (GC-143 and GC-105) reduced the transcriptional activity (GC-mt #1, #2). Especially, abrogation of the GC-box located at −143 bp (GC-143) of the minimal promoter led to a remarkable reduction (>95%) of transcriptional activity (GC-mt #1). Abrogation of the GC-box located at −105 bp (GC-105) also caused a >50% reduction of transcriptional activity (GC-mt #5). Mutations of all of two E-boxes and three GC-boxes led to a marked loss of transcriptional activity (99.9 ± 0.2% reduction, GC-E-mt), and mutations of only two GC-boxes (GC-143 andGC-105) except GC-88 also caused a >98% reduction of transcription activity (GC-mt #4). These results indicate that several cis-elements, including GC-143 and -105, as well as E-201, are important for basal transcriptional activity of mTERT gene. In particular, two GC-boxes (GC-143 and-105) are the most essential cis-elements for basal transactivation of mTERT gene in C2C12 cells. As shown in Fig. 3, a core promoter region (−225/+53) is responsible for reduction of mTERT transcription during myogenesis. To identify the role of cis-elements in this core promoter, C2C12 cells were stably transfected with reporter plasmids containing mutations in five protein binding sites and induced to differentiate with differentiation medium for 10 days (Fig.6). Transfectants with GC-mt #1, GC-mt #2, and Ebox-mt #1 reporter plasmids, which have single mutation among these cis-elements, reduced transcriptional activity during myogenesis (75–85% reduction), as well as transfectants with either −1561/+53-Luc or −225/+53-Luc reporter plasmid. Mutation of two E-boxes (Ebox-mt #2) also caused a decrease of luciferase activity (75% reduction). This result indicates that GC-boxes in the mTERT core promoter are responsible for differentiational down-regulation of mTERT gene in C2C12 cells. Abrogation of two GC-boxes (GC-143 and GC-105; GC-mt #4) also caused a slight decrease of transcription activity during myogenesis (15% reduction, Fig. 6). However, we could not clearly ascertain whether the rest of the E-boxes in the mTERT core promoter are indispensable for muscle cell differentiation or not, because there was not enough gene expression activity to be lost further with GC-mt #4 reporter plasmid, as shown in Fig. 5. In establishing these stable transfectants, several clones were shown to have different basal transcriptional activities from those of the transient transfectants (Fig. 5), because these results might represent the difference of the number of reporter gene copies, which were integrated into host chromosomal DNA. To identify the proteins that bind to these GC-boxes (GC-143 and GC-105) in mTERT gene core promoter, EMSA was performed with 32P-labeled oligonucleotides corresponding to each GC-box and nuclear extracts from C2C12 cells cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Two major DNA·protein complexes were observed by using either GC-143 or GC-105 for probes (Fig.7 A, lane 1 or5). The specificity of these complexes was confirmed by competiti"
https://openalex.org/W1995122533,"Microbial components such as bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can trigger highly lethal septic shock. The cardinal features of septic leukocytes include the repressed production of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and elevated production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as secretory interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (sIL-1RA). Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine gene transcriptions are equally repressed in septic leukocytes due to disruption of the LPS signaling pathway at the level of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase. The selective elevation of sIL-1RA protein in septic blood is caused by efficient translation of residual sIL-1RA message. In this study, we report that the LPS-inducible phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase)-dependent signaling pathway contributes to the elevated translation of sIL-1RA in septic/LPS-adapted leukocytes. We also observe that this pathway is gene specific and does not affect the production of proinflammatory IL-1β protein."

In particular, a GAL4-Lhx3 Y114C LIM mutant was unable to support Ras responsiveness of a modified glycoprotein hormone α-subunit reporter gene. Protein interaction studies suggest that the Y114C mutation may modestly reduce binding to the POU transcription factor, Pit-1.

Unlike NLI, which binds to all nuclear LIM domains tested, SLB appears to bind to a subset of LIM domains with the highest affinity for Lhx3 and the closely related protein, Lhx4.

There is also evidence that LHX3 plays an important role in pituitary hormone gene expression in humans. A recent report has described mutations in the human LHX3 gene in patients displaying a syndrome called combined pituitary hormone deficiency (21Netchine I. Sobrier M.-L. Krude H. Schnabel D. Maghnie M. Marcos E. Duriez B. Cacheux V. Moers A.V. Goossens M. Gruters A. Amselem S. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). This syndrome is characterized by the loss of all but one (adrenocorticotropin) of the five hormones produced in the anterior pituitary resulting in severe growth retardation. Two mutations which are associated with this syndrome in humans have been identified. One of the mutations is predicted to produce a truncated protein lacking the homeodomain. Thus, this protein would likely be inactive due to failure to bind DNA. Interestingly, the other mutation is a point mutation that is predicted to convert a tyrosine residue to cysteine in the first zinc finger structure of the second LIM domain. It is not clear how this mutation alters the activity of LHX3. In the present studies we have explored how this point mutation in the second LIM domain alters the functional properties of Lhx3. To study this issue, we have prepared the corresponding mutation in the mouse Lhx3 coding sequence. We have analyzed the ability of the mutant transcription factor to bind DNA, participate in transcriptional activation, and interact with other transcription factors and co-activator/adapter proteins.

A reporter gene containing the −507 to −205 region of the glycoprotein hormone α-subunit gene with a GAL4 site substituted for the pituitary glycoprotein basal element was as described (10Glenn D.J.

The coding sequences for various LIM domains and NLI were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using standard protocols. The products were all confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Cells were transfected with a total of 1 μg of DNA and 5 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 35-mm well plates, or 0.4 μg of DNA and 2 μl of LipofectAMINE in 22-mm well plates using a protocol provided by the supplier. For immunoblotting or immunoprecipitations, αT-3 or 293 cells were scraped from the culture dishes in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8. The cells were pelleted in a microcentrifuge and resuspended in the same buffer but with 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The cells were disrupted by 4 cycles of freeze thaw using dry ice/ethanol and 37 °C water baths. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was saved as a whole cell extract. For preparation of cell extracts for luciferase assays and for some immunoblotting studies, cell monolayers were rocked for 15 min in Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega). Cell debris was removed by transferring the extract to microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuging for 2 min. Cell extracts were made from transfected 293 cells as described above for immunoprecipitations. A duplex DNA probe was synthesized containing the sequence, ATATCAGGTACTTAGCTAATTAAATGTGCT, which corresponds to the pituitary glycoprotein hormone basal element (26Schoderbek W.E. Roberson M.S. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3903-3910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This DNA element contains a LIM factor-binding site (7Roberson M.S. Schoderbek W.E. Tremml G. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2985-2993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding reactions contained 10,000 cpm of 32P-labeled DNA probe, varying amounts of cell extract, 1 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA, 10 μg of bovine serum albumin, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmdithiothreitol in a total volume of 25 μl. In some reactions 0.5 μl of preimmune serum or antiserum to Lhx3 was included. Reactions were incubated for 20 min at room temperature and then analyzed on nondenaturing, 4% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were then dried and exposed to x-ray film. The antiserum to SLB has been described previously (17Howard P.W. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13336-13342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody to the AU1 epitope was obtained as from the Berkeley Antibody Company. The antiserum to Lhx3 was produced by immunizing rabbits with a fusion protein containing glutathione S-transferase fused to residues 266 to 400 of mouse Lhx3 (GST-Lhx3266–400). This antigen represents the carboxyl-terminal domain of Lhx3 facilitating the use of the resulting antiserum to detect Lhx3 proteins with point mutations in the amino-terminal, LIM domains. The GST-Lhx3266–400 fusion protein was produced inEscherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography as described (27Smith D.B. Johnson K.S.

Aliquots containing equal amounts of total protein were combined with 15 μl of a 50% slurry of anti-FLAG-agarose (Kodak). The immunoprecipitation mixtures were rotated for 2 h at 4 °C and the anti-FLAG-agarose was collected by centrifugation. The anti-FLAG-agarose was then washed 3 times with 1 ml each of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.025% SDS. Proteins bound to the anti-FLAG-agarose were then analyzed by electrophoresis on a denaturing, polyacrylamide gel. For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Blocking reactions, incubation with a 1:5,000 dilution of antiserum to AU1, Lhx3, or SLB, incubation with a 1:10,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody (Santa Cruz) and incubation with chemiluminescent reagent (Amersham Renaissance) were all performed as suggested by the suppliers. GST-SLB1213–1265 or a GST-NLI295–375 fusion protein was used for protein binding assays. The proteins were expressed in E. coli and immobilized on agarose beads as described (27Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst .). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). For binding assays with Pit-1, FLAG epitope-tagged Pit-1 was expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells and immobilized on anti-FLAG-agarose. Radiolabeled proteins to be tested in these assays were prepared by coupled transcription and translation reactions in the presence of [35S]methionine using reagents and protocols provided by the supplier (Promega). Typical binding reactions contained 7 μl ofin vitro translated protein, 15 μl of GST, GST-SLB, anti-FLAG, or anti-FLAG-Pit-1-agarose, and Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) with 0.1% Tween 20 in a final volume of 100 μl. Reactions were rotated at 4 °C for 2 h and then washed 3 × 1 ml each with Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.025% SDS. The bound radiolabeled proteins were then analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Recently it has been shown that a point mutation which results in replacement of a tyrosine residue with a cysteine residue in the LIM domain of the human LHX3 transcription factor is associated with combined pituitary hormone deficiency (21Netchine I. Sobrier M.-L. Krude H. Schnabel D. Maghnie M. Marcos E. Duriez B. Cacheux V. Moers A.V. Goossens M. Gruters A. Amselem S. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). It seems likely that this point mutation alters the ability of LHX3 to modulate a transcriptional event important for the development of pituitary cell lineages (18Sheng H.Z. Zhadnov A.B.

To examine the effects of this point mutation on LHX3 activity, we created the corresponding mutation (Y114C) in the mouse Lhx3 coding sequence. Although we have studied this mutation in the context of the mouse Lhx3 sequence, it is likely the findings also apply to human LHX3 as the second LIM domain of human LHX3 is identical to the second LIM domain of mouse Lhx3. The Y114C mutation is adjacent to histidine 115, one of four residues predicted to coordinate a zinc atom in the first zinc finger of the second LIM domain (2Dawid I.B. Breen J.J. Toyama R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 156-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 28Sánchez-Garcı́a I. Rabbits T.H.

Biol. 1996; 257: 153-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It seemed possible that the introduction of a cysteine residue which potentially could coordinate with the zinc atom might disrupt or distort the zinc finger structure. Therefore we created a point mutation which replaced tyrosine 114 with an alanine residue (Y114A) which should not coordinate a zinc atom. We also prepared a mutant Lhx3 in which histidine 115 was replaced with alanine (H115A) presumably disrupting the zinc finger structure. The ability of the wild type and mutant Lhx3 proteins was then tested for DNA binding, transcriptional activity, and co-factor binding. A point mutation might reduce the ability of a transcription factor to stimulate gene expression through any of several mechanisms. One of the most straightforward mechanisms would involve a decrease in DNA binding activity. Although the Y114C mutation is outside of the homeodomain of Lhx3, there is evidence that the LIM domain of Lhx3 may inhibit the DNA binding activity of the homeodomain (4Bach I. Rhodes S.J. Pearse R.V., II Heinzel T. Gloss B. Scully K.M. Sawchenko P.E. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2720-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 9Meier B.C. Price J.R.

Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2212-2225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test for DNA binding activity, HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors for wild type and mutant Lhx3 and then cell extracts prepared for binding experiments. The cell extracts were incubated with a radiolabeled probe corresponding to an Lhx3-binding element designated the pituitary glycoprotein basal element from the gonadotropin α-subunit promoter (7Roberson M.S. Schoderbek W.E. Tremml G. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2985-2993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Schoderbek W.E. Roberson M.S. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3903-3910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bound complexes were separated from free probe by electrophoresis on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (Fig.1.). Extracts prepared from the HEK 293 cells transfected with the empty expression vector formed several weak complexes which were insensitive to addition of an antiserum to Lhx3. Transfection of the vector for wild type Lhx3 resulted in the formation of two major complexes. Both complexes were apparently disrupted by antiserum to Lhx3 but not by preimmune serum. The more slowly migrating complex, C2, has a similar migration to a complex from nontransfected cells. However, the Lhx3-directed, C2 complex can be distinguished from the endogenous complex (designated NS) by the disrupting effects of the Lhx3 antiserum. Formation of two Lhx3-directed complexes is consistent with the observation that the related LIM homeodomain protein, Lhx2, also forms two complexes on DNA fragments containing this sequence (7Roberson M.S. Schoderbek W.E. Tremml G. Maurer R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2985-2993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As this DNA element contains an imperfect palindrome, it is possible that the slower migrating, C2 complex contains an Lhx3 dimer. Analysis of extracts from cells transfected with vectors for the mutant Lhx3 proteins demonstrated that the mutant proteins can also bind to the DNA element. Expression vectors for all of the Lhx3 mutants led to formation of a C1 complex which was disrupted by the Lhx3 antiserum and was comparable in magnitude to the C1 complex for the wild type protein. The H115A mutation which presumably disrupts the zinc finger appeared to produce more C1 complex than was obtained with the wild type protein, consistent with other observations that the LIM domain can inhibit DNA binding (4Bach I. Rhodes S.J. Pearse R.V., II Heinzel T. Gloss B. Scully K.M. Sawchenko P.E. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2720-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 9Meier B.C.

Rhodes S.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2212-2225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the formation of the C2 complex by the mutants is somewhat complicated due to substantial variation in the amount of the NS complex in the various cell extracts. However, as indicated above, the C2 complex from cells transfected with wild type Lhx3 is disrupted by the Lhx3 antiserum. None of the Lhx3 mutants produced a C2 complex which was sensitive to the Lhx3 antiserum. Addition of larger amounts of cell extract did not result in formation of the C2 complex for the mutants (data not shown). These observations provide evidence that the mutant Lhx3 proteins are capable of binding DNA. However, there is a qualitative difference in binding with a reduction in the formation of the C2 complex. This may indicate that these LIM domain mutations have an influence on oligomerization of Lhx3 or perhaps on the interaction of Lhx3 with other factors which contribute to complex formation. While the effects of the mutations on forming the C2 complex might contribute to changes in transcriptional activity, the finding that the mutant Lhx3 proteins demonstrated substantial DNA binding activity indicates that they could possibly participate in transcriptional activation. Therefore, their activity was further characterized. Previous studies have shown that Lhx3 can synergize with the pituitary specific transcription factor, Pit-1, to activate the prolactin promoter in heterologous cells (4Bach I. Rhodes S.J. Pearse R.V., II Heinzel T. Gloss B. Scully K.M. Sawchenko P.E. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2720-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 9Meier B.C. Price J.R.

We used this assay to explore the transcriptional activity of the Lhx3 LIM domain mutants in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 2). As previously reported (4Bach I. Rhodes S.J. Pearse R.V., II Heinzel T. Gloss B. Scully K.M. Sawchenko P.E. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2720-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 9Meier B.C. Price J.R. Parker G.E. Bridwell J.L. Rhodes S.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 147: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), wild type Lhx3 weakly activated the prolactin promoter alone and showed strongly synergistic activation in the presence of Pit-1 (Fig. 2 A). All three of the mutant Lhx3 proteins were found to synergize with Pit-1, although reporter activity was reduced somewhat as compared with wild type Lhx3. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that the wild type and mutant Lhx3 proteins were expressed at approximately the same levels (Fig. 2 B). These findings suggest that replacement of tyrosine 114 of Lhx3 with either cysteine or alanine modestly reduces the ability of Lhx3 to act in concert with Pit-1 to synergistically activate transcription. To further characterize the transcriptional activity of the mutant Lhx3 proteins, we took advantage of a different Lhx3-responsive reporter gene. Lhx3 can bind to an element designated the pituitary glycoprotein hormone basal element in the glycoprotein hormone α-subunit gene and activate transcription (4Bach I. Rhodes S.J. Pearse R.V., II Heinzel T. Gloss B. Scully K.M. Sawchenko P.E. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2720-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 10Glenn D.J. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36159-36167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutation of the pituitary glycoprotein hormone basal element reduces the ability of Ras to stimulate α-subunit promoter activity. Direction of GAL4-Lhx3 to bind to this site can restore Ras responsiveness (10Glenn D.J. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36159-36167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We have used this assay to examine the ability of the Lhx3 LIM mutations to support a Ras response (Fig. 3). The αT3-1 gonadotrope-derived cell line was transfected with a GAL4-Lhx3 expression vector and the glycoprotein hormone reporter gene containing a GAL4-binding site replacing the Lhx2/Lhx3-binding site. As expected, this reporter does not support a Ras response when transfected alone because the GAL4-binding site has disrupted the Lhx3-binding site. Transfection of a GAL4 DNA-binding domain expression vector did not rescue the response. As has been previously reported (10Glenn D.J. Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36159-36167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar),"

To examine the effect of the cAMP signal transduction pathway on expression of the gene encoding the mouse glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit (G6Pase), the liver-derived HepG2 cell line was transiently co-transfected with a series of G6Pase-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusion genes and an expression vector encoding the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). PKA markedly stimulated G6Pase-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusion gene expression, and mutational analysis of the G6Pase promoter revealed that multiple cis-acting elements were required for this response. One of these elements was mapped to the G6Pase promoter region between −114 and −99, and this sequence was shown to bind hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-6. This HNF-6 binding site was able to confer a stimulatory effect of PKA on the expression of a heterologous fusion gene; a mutation that abolished HNF-6 binding also abolished the stimulatory effect of PKA. Further investigation revealed that PKA phosphorylated HNF-6 in vitro. Site-directed mutation of three consensus PKA phosphorylation sites in the HNF-6 carboxyl terminus markedly reduced this phosphorylation. These results suggest that the stimulatory effect of PKA on G6Pase fusion gene transcription in HepG2 cells may be mediated in part by the phosphorylation of HNF-6.

Med. 1997; 215: 314-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In this model the other components of the glucose-6-phosphatase system act as transport proteins to shuttle both substrate and product across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (1Mithieux G. Eur. J.

Type 1 glycogen storage disease is characterized by severe hypoglycemia in the postabsorbtive state, hyperlipidemia, hyperuricemia, and lactic acidemia (4Chou J.Y. Mansfield B.C. Trends Endocrinol.

In addition, patients are prone to growth retardation, hepatic steatosis and cirrhosis, hepatic adenoma, and renal failure (4Chou J.Y. Mansfield B.C. Trends Endocrinol.

Because of the wider tissue distribution of the glucose-6-phosphate transporter, patients afflicted with glycogen storage disease type 1b also suffer from infectious complications as a result of functional deficiencies in neutrophils and monocytes, indicating an important role for this transporter in the immune response (4Chou J.Y.

In contrast to glycogen storage disease type 1a, which is caused by decreased G6Pase activity, increased G6Pase activity contributes to the pathophysiology of diabetes. In both type 2 and poorly controlled type 1 diabetics, the ability of insulin to stimulate peripheral glucose utilization and to repress hepatic glucose production is reduced as a consequence of insulin resistance. Although the causes of insulin resistance are unclear (8Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar), it is apparent that the elevation in hepatic glucose production is caused by an increased rate of gluconeogenesis rather than glycogenolysis in both type 1 (9Cline G.W. Rothman D.L. Magnusson I. Katz L.D. Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2369-2376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and type 2 diabetics (10Consoli A. Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 430-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that increased expression of key gluconeogenic enzymes including G6Pase contribute to this increase in hepatic glucose production. Thus, hepatic G6Pase expression is markedly elevated in various diabetic animal models (11Argaud D. Zhang Q. Pan W. Maitra S. Pilkis S.J. Lange A.J.

Furthermore, a modest overexpression of G6Pase in rats, again using recombinant adenovirus, resulted in approximately a 1.6–3-fold increase in hepatic G6Pase enzymatic activity that was associated with glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, decreased hepatic glycogen content, and increased peripheral triglyceride stores, changes similar to those found in early stage type 2 diabetic patients (17Trinh K.Y.

A site-directed mutant of the G6Pase HNF-6 motif was generated within the context of the −231 to +66 G6Pase promoter fragment using a previously described three-step PCR strategy (29Streeper R.S.

The number of inserts was determined by restriction enzyme analysis and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression vectors encoding the α and β forms of PKA were a generous gift from Dr. Richard Maurer (33Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6870-6873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An empty vector control was generated by digesting the PKAβ plasmid with XhoI andHindIII to remove the open reading frame, filling in the noncompatible ends using the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I, and then religating. A mammalian cell expression vector encoding the full-length form of HNF-6 was constructed by cloning the open reading frame of mouse HNF-6, isolated as anEcoRI-EcoRI fragment from the plasmid HNF-6 pGEM1 (a generous gift from Dr. Robert Costa) (34Rausa F. Samadani U. Ye H. Lim L. Fletcher C.F. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Costa R.H. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 228-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), intoEcoRI-digested pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). A bacterial cell expression vector for HNF-6 was constructed by re-isolating the coding region of HNF-6 from the pcDNA3 plasmid, minus nine amino acids at the N terminus, as a PvuI-XhoI fragment and ligating into XhoI-digested pET15b (Novagen). The noncompatible ends were then filled in using the Klenow fragment ofE. coli DNA polymerase I prior to blunt-end ligation. In the resulting plasmid designated full-length HNF-6 pET15b, the HNF-6 coding sequence is in frame with that of a 6x histidine tag. A carboxyl-terminal truncation of HNF-6 was constructed by digesting this HNF-6 pET15b plasmid with SacI and BamHI, filling in the noncompatible ends using the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I, and then religating. HNF-6 contains three consensus PKA phosphorylation sites (serines 309, 411, and 440). The codons in HNF-6 that encode these serine residues were mutated by site-directed mutagenesis to codons that encode alanine residues. Briefly, HNF-6 pGEM1 (34Rausa F. Samadani U. Ye H. Lim L. Fletcher C.F. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Costa R.H. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 228-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) was digested with SacI, and the resultant SacI-SacI fragment was then ligated into SacI-digested pGEM7. This plasmid contains the carboxyl-terminal third of HNF-6 and was used as the template in the PCR-based mutagenesis procedures. The codon encoding serine 309 was mutated using the following oligonucleotides: 5′-CCGAGCTCAAACGTTACGCCATCCCACAGGCCATC-3′ and 5′-CGGGATCCGAGCTCGAATTC-3′. SacI sites and the mutated bases are underlined. The resulting PCR product was digested with SacI and ligated into SacI-digested pGEM7 to generate a plasmid designated HNF-6 site 1 SDM pGEM7. The codons encoding serines 411 and 440 were mutated individually using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as directed by the manufacturer using the following oligonucleotides: serine 411, 5′-GGAAAATAAGCGTCCGGCCAAAGAATTACAAATC-3′ and 5′-GATTTGTAATTCTTTGGCCGGACGCTTATTTTCC-3′; and serine 440, 5′-GAATGCCAGAAGGAGGGCTCTGGACAAGTGGCAGG-3′ and 5′-CCTGCCACTTGTCCAGAGCCCTCCTTCTGGCATTC-3′. The underlined nucleotides indicate the mutated bases. The resulting plasmids were designated HNF-6 site 2 SDM pGEM7 and HNF-6 site 3 SDM pGEM7, respectively. Convenient restriction enzyme sites flanking the mutated codons were then utilized to isolate smaller fragments that contained these mutated codons. Thus, the plasmid encoding the mutated serine 309 codon was digested with SacI and PstI, and the plasmids encoding the mutated serine 411 and 440 codons were digested withPstI and PvuII and PvuII andSacI, respectively. The fragments generated were then ligated together into SacI-digested pGEM7, and the resulting plasmid was designated HNF-6 site 1–3 SDM pGEM7. This plasmid was then digested with SacI and EcoRI, and the fragment generated that contained the mutated HNF-6 sequence was exchanged for the equivalent fragment in the wild-type HNF-6 pcDNA3 plasmid described above to create a plasmid designated HNF-6 SDM pcDNA3. In addition, this same SacI-EcoRI fragment was exchanged for the equivalent fragment of HNF-6 in the wild-type HNF-6 pET15b bacterial expression vector, which corresponded to aSacI-BamHI fragment. The noncompatible ends were filled in using the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I and then religated. The resulting plasmid was designated HNF-6 SDM pET15b. All fragments generated by PCR were completely sequenced using the USB Sequenase™ kit to verify the absence of polymerase errors. Plasmid constructs were purified by centrifugation through cesium chloride gradients (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Human HepG2 hepatoma cells were grown and transiently transfected in suspension using the calcium phosphate DNA co-precipitation method as described previously (29Streeper R.S. Eaton E.M. Ebert D.H.

CAT and β-galactosidase assays were also performed exactly as described previously (29Streeper R.S. Eaton E.M. Ebert D.H. Chapman S.C. Svitek C.A. O'Brien R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The CAT activity directed by the various fusion gene constructs was corrected for the β-galactosidase activity in the same samples, and each construct was analyzed in duplicate in multiple transfections as specified in the figure legends. IPTG was used to induce the expression of HNF-6 in the BL21(DE3) pLysS E. coli strain (Stratagene) transformed with the full-length HNF-6 pET15b plasmid described above. Bacterial extracts were prepared by sonication in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C. The soluble fraction was separated from the particulate fraction via centrifugation. Complementary oligonucleotides representing the mouse G6Pase HNF-6 motif (Fig. 1 B) were synthesized withHindIII-compatible ends, gel purified, annealed, and then labeled with [α-32P]dATP by using the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I to a specific activity of ∼2.5 μCi/pmol. The labeled HNF-6 oligonucleotide (∼7.5 fmol, ∼30,000 cpm) was incubated with bacterial extract in a final reaction volume of 20 μl containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol (v/v), and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC). After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, the reactants were loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at room temperature for 120 min at 150 V in 0.25× TBE buffer (1× TBE is 89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA). After electrophoresis, gels were dried and exposed to Kodak XAR5 film, and binding was analyzed by autoradiography. For competition experiments, a 100-fold molar excess of the unlabeled double-stranded wild-type or mutated HNF-6 oligonucleotides (Fig. 1 B) was incubated with the labeled oligomer prior to the addition of bacterial extract. Binding was then analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described above. The full-length, wild-type and mutated, and carboxyl-terminal truncated forms of HNF-6 were expressed in the BL21-CodonPlus™(DE3)-RIL E. coli strain (Stratagene) transformed with the HNF-6 pET15b plasmids described above. Once bacterial cultures (1 liter) had reached anA 600 of ∼0.6, protein expression was induced with IPTG (1 mm) by incubation for 4 h at 37 °C. After centrifugation bacterial pellets were stored at −20 °C overnight. The histidine-tagged HNF-6 protein was then partially purified using metal affinity chromatography. Briefly, bacterial pellets were thawed on ice for 15 min and then resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer, pH 8.0, containing 50 mmNaH2PO4, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mg/ml lysozyme. After incubation on ice for 30 min, bacteria were sonicated at 4 °C 10 times for 30 s each with a 1-min incubation on ice between each round of sonication. Lysates were then diluted with an additional 20 ml of lysis buffer, and particulate matter was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was incubated with 5 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4 °C before the application of the slurry to a column. After washing twice with 50 ml of a buffer, pH 8.0, comprising 50 mm NaH2PO4, 500 mm NaCl, 60 mm imidazole, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, HNF-6 was eluted in a buffer, pH 7.2, containing 50 mmNaH2PO4, 500 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The purification of HNF-6 was analyzed via SDS-PAGE, and protein was visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The yield of HNF-6 was estimated by comparison to the staining of a bovine serum albumin standard. Partially purified histidine-tagged HNF-6 was phosphorylated at room temperature by PKA (0.12 μm) in a final reaction volume of 40 μl, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm NaH2PO4, 2.5 mm HEPES, 25 mm imidazole, 50 mmNaCl, 200 μm [γ-32P]ATP (1.25 μCi/nmol), 0.6 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.5% (v/v) ethylene glycol. The concentrations of HNF-6 and magnesium acetate as well as the time course of the reaction were as indicated in the figure legends. All reactions were terminated by the addition of 20 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and protein was visualized via Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Gels were subsequently dried and exposed to Kodak XAR5 film. Bands corresponding to phosphorylated HNF-6 were then cut out of the dried gels, and the incorporation of phosphate into HNF-6 was quantified by scintillation counting. To examine the molecular mechanisms by which the cAMP signal transduction pathway stimulates mouse G6Pase gene expression, the liver-derived HepG2 cell line was transiently co-transfected with a series of G6Pase-CAT fusion genes and an expression vector encoding PKA. PKA markedly stimulated G6Pase-CAT fusion gene expression, and mutational analysis of the G6Pase promoter revealed that multiple regions were required for this response (Fig.1 A; Ref. 27Streeper R.S. Svitek C.A. Goldman J.K. O'Brien R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12108-12118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This strategy led to the identification of a cAMP response element (CRE) in the mouse G6Pase promoter located between −162 and −155 (27Streeper R.S. Svitek C.A. Goldman J.K. O'Brien R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12108-12118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, even when this element was deleted, PKA still induced G6Pase-CAT fusion gene expression ∼4–5-fold (Fig. 1 A; Ref. 27Streeper R.S. Svitek C.A. Goldman J.K. O'Brien R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12108-12118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Further deletion of the G6Pase promoter sequence between −129 and −85 resulted in an additional reduction in the stimulatory effect of PKA on G6Pase-CAT fusion gene expression (Fig. 1 A). These results indicate that the cAMP signal transduction pathway stimulates the expression of G6Pase through a complex cAMP response unit (CRU; Ref. 36Lucas P.C. Granner D.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1131-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and that an element located between −129 and −85 in the G6Pase promoter contributes to the full stimulatory effect of PKA on G6Pase-CAT fusion gene expression. Examination of the mouse G6Pase promoter sequence between −129 and −85 for known transcription factor binding sites revealed a putative binding site for HNF-6 located between nucleotides −110 and −101 (Fig. 1 B; Ref. 37Lannoy V.J. Burglin T.R. Rousseau G.G. Lemaigre F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13552-13562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The sequence of this HNF-6 motif is highly conserved among the mouse, rat, and human G6Pase genes (Fig. 1 B); this seems to be the only HNF-6 motif in the mouse G6Pase promoter. Samadani and Costa (38Samadani U. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6273-6284Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) have previously shown that HNF-6 is expressed in HepG2 cells. To determine whether this putative HNF-6 binding site was required for the stimulatory effect of PKA on G6Pase-CAT fusion gene expression, this motif was mutated by site-directed mutagenesis in the context of the −129 to +66 G6Pase promoter fragment.

During the course of an infection, C. trachomatis exchanges some of its membrane lipids, including lipopolysaccharide, with those of its mammalian host cell (22Karimi S.T. Schloemer R.H. Wilde C.E. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 1780-1785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and vice versa (23Hackstadt T. Rockey D.D. Heinzen R.A.

The C. trachomatis genome contains single copy homologues of most of the genes required for lipid A biosynthesis inE. coli, including CtlpxA, which encodes a protein of 280 amino acid residues with 42% identity and 50% similarity to the 262 amino acids of E. coli LpxA (26Stephens R.S.

We now show that the presence of non-hydroxylated acyl chains at the 3 and 3′ positions in C. trachomatis lipid A (Fig. 2) is explained by the unusual substrate specificity of C. trachomatis LpxA, which is highly selective for myristoyl-ACP.

Following many generations of growth at 42 °C, all of the lipid A molecules synthesized in this construct contain myristate residues at positions 3 and 3′. However, when analyzed 2 h after a shift from 30 to 42 °C, residual ester-linked 3-hydroxymyristate moieties are present only at position 3′.

The NdeI and BamHI sites, respectively, are underlined. These primers were used at a final concentration of 0.25 μm in 100 μl of pfu polymerase PCR reaction mixture containing 10 ng of genomic DNA. The reaction conditions were as follows: a 94 °C melt for 5 min followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C (melt) for 45 s, 55 °C (annealing) for 45 s, and 72 °C (extension) for 2 min. This was followed by a 10-min run-off at 72 °C. Finally, 1 μl of this reaction mixture was subjected to a second round of PCR, using the same conditions as the first. The amplified PCR product was then purified from the reaction mixture using phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v). The aqueous phase of this extraction was washed two times with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v), and then mixed with 0.1 volume of 3 m sodium acetate and 2.5 volumes of 100% ethanol at 0 °C for 30 min to precipitate the DNA. The PCR product was then dried and re-dissolved in 50 μl of sterile water, digested with NdeI and BamHI, purified again, and ligated using T4 DNA ligase into similarly treated pET23c(+) vector DNA. The ligation mixture was then transformed into CaCl2-competent XL1Blue cells. Plasmid-containing transformants were selected on LB agar plates supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and grown overnight at 37 °C. Putative clones were re-purified on LB ampicillin plates, inoculated into 5 ml of LB broth containing ampicillin, and grown in shaking culture overnight at 37 °C. Plasmid DNA was then isolated and subjected to screening by NdeI andBamHI digestion for the presence of the insert. One positive clone containing the CtlpxA gene was designated pCS125 and verified by DNA sequencing. For studies of the enzymatic activity associated withCtlpxA, the high copy lac vector pBluescript II SK(+) was used. CtlpxA was subcloned by restriction endonuclease digestion of pCS125 with XbaI andHindIII, followed by ligation into these restriction sites of pBluescript II SK(+). One positive clone was designated pCS131. This plasmid was transformed into RO138 and verified by restriction digestion. The strains pCS131/RO138, pTO5/RO138, and pBluescript II SK(+)/RO138 were grown overnight in 5 ml of LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, at 30 °C with 225 rpm rotary shaking. The culture was then diluted 1:100 into 100 ml of fresh medium, and allowed to reach A600 of ∼0.6. At this point, the cultures were shifted to 42 °C and allowed to grow for another 2 h. At the end of this period, the cultures were chilled on ice for 10 min and then harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The cell pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of ice-cold buffer (sterile 100 mmpotassium phosphate at pH 7.5 with 200 mm NaCl and 20% glycerol) per 50 ml of original culture, and the cells were centrifuged again at 4,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Each washed cell pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of the same buffer and frozen at −20 °C. The cells were then thawed on ice and broken by one passage through a French pressure cell at 14,000 psi. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove large debris, and the supernatants (extracts) were collected and stored at −80 °C. Before use in the activity assays, the protein concentrations of these extracts were quantified using the Pierce bicinchoninic acid assay kit (37Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K.

The data were collected using a Molecular Devices SpectraMax 250 plate reader, and analyzed relative to a bovine serum albumin standard with the software package Softmax Pro. The extracts were also characterized by 15% SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad mini-protean system) to assess the extent of LpxA overproduction. The [α32P]-UDP- GlcNAc and (R,S)-3-hydroxymyristoyl-ACP substrates were prepared as previously described (13Dotson G.D. Kaltashov I.A. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R. J.

Carty of Duke University Medical Center) was prepared by the same enzymatic method as the hydroxymyristoyl-ACP. The LpxA assay follows the conversion of [α-32P]UDP-GlcNAc to [α-32P]UDP-(3-O-acyl)-GlcNAc based on a mobility shift during TLC on a silica plate as previously described (9Anderson M.S. Raetz C.R.H.

Each 10-μl reaction contained 40 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mg/ml L-573,655 (or 0.02 mg/ml LNTI-229 as indicated), 10 μm(R,S)-3-hydroxymyristoyl-ACP or myristoyl-ACP (as indicated), 10 μm UDP-GlcNAc, [α-32P]UDP-GlcNAc (2 × 105 dpm/tube), and an appropriate amount of extract. L-573,655 and LNTI-229 prevent the further metabolism of the lpxA reaction product. The assays were carried out at 30 °C, and time points were analyzed by spotting 2.5-μl portions of each reaction mixture onto a silica TLC plate. The plate was developed in chloroform/methanol/water/acetic acid (25:15:4:2, v/v) and analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics Storm 840 system). The permissive temperature for RO138 is 30 °C. The non-permissive temperature of 42 °C inhibits growth and reduces cell viability within one doubling time. The ability of different constructs to grow at 42 °C was determined both on plates and in liquid broth to assess complementation. Growth curves, following a mid-log phase temperature shift from 30 to 42 °C, were performed for a more detailed analysis of complementation. Growth was followed by measuring turbidity at 600 nm on a Spectronic 21D spectrometer (Milton Roy) or a Beckman DU-640 spectrophotometer. Outer membrane integrity was evaluated by examining resistance to selected antibiotics. The assay was performed by placing 8-mm filter discs containing various antibiotics onto a lawn of cells, freshly plated using a saturated cotton swab from a culture at A600 ∼ 0.2. After 16 h of growth, the zones of inhibition around each disc were measured, providing an assessment of relative antibiotic sensitivity (38Vuorio R. Vaara M. Antimicrob.

In our experiments, the diameter of each zone of inhibition was measured in two dimensions, and the average diameter was used to calculate the area of clearing (mm2). The antibiotics used were rifampicin (30 μg/disc) and erythromycin (25 μg/disc). For structural studies, we isolated hybrid lipid A species generated by theE. coli lpxA2 mutant RO138 complemented withCtlxpA, using previously established techniques (14Odegaard T.J. Kaltashov I.A.

A number of 3′-5′-exoribonucleases have also been described in bacteria and shown to be involved in RNA processing. For example, RNase E from Escherichia coli is a site-specific endoribonuclease that also has a 3′-5′-exonuclease activity on poly(A) and poly(U) tails (7Huang H. Liao J. Cohen S.N. Nature. 1998; 391: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). There is conservation of some exoribonucleases between bacteria and eukaryotes.

This model involves an initial base-pairing interaction of specific guide RNAs with the pre-edited mRNAs just downstream of the first editing site, and a cleavage occurs at the first mismatched base of the mRNA.

S. A. 1996; 93: 8901-8906Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This activity has also been detected in a partially purified 20 S editing complex that showedin vitro U-deletion editing activity (17Rusché L.N. Cruz-Reyes J. Piller K.J. Sollner-Webb B.

In this paper we report the partial purification and characterization of a U-specific 3′-5′-exonuclease activity from L. tarentolae mitochondria, which represents a candidate for the enzyme involved in removal of the Us in U-deletion RNA editing.DISCUSSIONThe distributive exonuclease is the first mitochondrial 3′-5′-exoribonuclease purified from a kinetoplastid protozoan. The enzyme has a strong preference for single-stranded oligo(U) 3′-overhangs. The origin of U specificity may reside either in a higher affinity of the exonuclease for stretches of Us or discrimination of a U from a non-U base during the catalytic reaction. The data from Fig.6 A indicate that even after a stretch of Us the enzyme stops more efficiently at purine bases. A C residue is discriminated less efficiently than larger purine bases. Competitive inhibition experiments with all four homoribopolynucleotides showed no specific effect on the degradation of the [G]12-U substrate RNA (data not shown). In addition, the chromatographic properties of the enzyme on poly(U) and poly(A) Sepharose-based media were virtually identical (data not shown). Taken together, these results strongly favor a specific recognition of a U at the active center.Although the enzyme was not yet purified to homogeneity, the fact that the activity migrated as a single, fairly sharp peak during the course of the fractionation and was shown to have an apparent molecular size of 60–80 kDa suggests that the observed specificity is a property of the enzyme and not due to copurifying auxiliary factors.The enzymatic properties of this exonuclease are consistent with a possible role in the U-deletion RNA editing that occurs in these mitochondria, in that this reaction involves the specific removal of unpaired Us at the 3′-end of the 5′-mRNA cleavage fragment prior to religation (10Blum B. Bakalara N. Simpson L. Cell. 1990; 60: 189-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 12Seiwert S.D. Stuart K.

Cell. 1996; 84: 831-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The removal of adjacent non-U nucleotides would produce a misedited sequence that could not be corrected by editing because U is the only nucleotide that can be added (22Sturm N.R. Maslov D.A. Blum B. Simpson L. Cell. 1992; 70: 469-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The minor lack of specificity with an unpaired terminal C residue may be overcome in vivo because the adjacent nucleotides at the 3′-end of the 5′-cleavage fragment always have complementary nucleotides in the guide RNA and could form a short duplex region that inhibits the exonuclease digestion (23Simpson L. Wang S.H. Thiemann O.H. Alfonzo J.D. Maslov D.A. Avila H.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 24Burgess M.L. Stuart K. RNA. 2000; 6: 1492-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of the enzyme to the chemical nature of the nucleotide rather than affinity to a stretch of Us is also consistent with the presence of editing sites where deletion of only one U occurs in vivo. We propose that the specificity of U-deletion editing is determined by both the specificity of the exonuclease toward the U base and also by the preference for a single-stranded 3′-overhang.It is of course possible that this enzyme is involved with other aspects of RNA metabolism in the mitochondrion ofLeishmania, and further work is required to determine the precise role. 3′-5′-Exoribonucleases have been shown to play important roles in the maturation and degradation of RNAs, including the 3′-end maturation of the 5.8 S rRNA (1Mitchell P.

Moreover, the p75TNFR has been shown to be preferentially activated by membrane-bound TNF (12Grell M. Douni E. Wajant H. Lohden M. Clauss M. Maxeiner B. Georgopoulos S. Lesslauer W. Kollias G. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell. 1995; 83: 793-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). Although the intracellular receptor domains show only little similarity, they share activities like NFκB activation. Although p55TNFR is capable of mediating these effects when expressed at physiologically relevant levels, induction of NFκB via the p75TNFR alone is observed only in cells overexpressing this receptor subtype (13Haridas V. Darnay B.G. Natarajan K. Heller R. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3152-3162PubMed Google Scholar, 14Heller R.A. Song K. Fan N. Chang D.J. Cell. 1992; 70: 47-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In our report we describe the identification of a novel p75TNFR isoform, termed icp75TNFR, generated by the use of an additional transcriptional start site. The elucidated open reading frame of icp75TNFR revealed that the leader sequence in exon 1 ofp75TNFR is replaced by an alternative exon. Immunohistochemical staining indicated intracellular expression of the icp75TNFR protein. We further present evidence that expression of icp75TNFR induces NFκB activation in TNF-stimulated cells, thus providing an example for intracellular cytokine receptor activation. The rat anti-human p75TNFR antibody had been purchased from Genzyme (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA). The polyclonal antiserum M80 as well as the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 80M2, 80A5, and MR2–1 had been kindly provided by M. Grell (Stuttgart, Germany). Mouse L929 cells (fibrosarcoma cells) and the human cell lines HEK 293, HepG2, KYM-1, THP1, U937, and HeLa (ATCC, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies Inc.) and 0.05 mg/ml gentamicin (PAA Laboratories Linz, Austria). HUVECs and HMEC were kindly provided by G. Eisner (Regensburg, Germany). Total RNA was isolated from THP-1 cells, and primer extension analysis was performed as described previously (15Seitz C. Männel D.N. Hehlgans T. Genomics. 1998; 48: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) using the following primers: Primer 1, 5′-CGGCCTGTTTAGACTCTAGAGCCAGACCACCTGGGTCTGG-3′; Primer 2, 5′-GGCGACGGGCGCCATGGGTGCGGGCGGGGTCCGG-3′). PCR amplification was performed using sense and antisense primers for icp75TNFR (5′-GGGAAGCTTGACAACATGGCGAAACCCCAT-3′ and 5′-GGGTCTAGAGGTTAACTGGGCTTCATCCCAGCATCAGGC-3′). p75TNFR expression plasmids (p75TNFR,icp75TNFR, icp75TNFR ΔTRAF, andicp75TNFR Δ TNF) were constructed by inserting the corresponding cDNAs into pcDNA 3.1Hygro (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). All expression constructs have been verified by sequencing. Twenty-four h after transfection, cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min on ice. Supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 50 μl of NTA-agarose (Qiagen), washed twice with 1 ml of denaturing wash buffer (8 m urea, 0.1 mNa2HPO4, 0.01 m Tris base, pH 5.9). Eluted proteins were subjected to SDS polyacrylamide electrophoresis and blotted. Immunoblot analysis was performed with a horseradish peroxidase coupled-anti-V5 epitope antibody (Invitrogen) using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) Western Blot Detection System (Energene, Regensburg, Germany). HeLa cells seeded on glass slides were transfected with expression plasmids using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nuclei of cells were stained with Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) at 37 °C for 10 min. To visualize mitochondria cells were incubated with MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with acetone (-20 °C) for 15 min, and incubated in blocking solution (3% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 2 h at 4 °C. Primary anti-Myc antibody (2 μg/ml in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin, Invitrogen) was added, and cells were incubated at 4 °C overnight. A secondary FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dako, Hamburg, Germany) was added for 1 h at room temperature. Colocalization of the Myc-tagged icp75TNFR protein with mitochondria was studied with the exhaustive photon reassignment (EPR) method. To examine TNF binding of cells overexpressing p75TNFR oricp75TNFR, HeLa cells were seeded on glass slides and transfected with the corresponding expression plasmids as described above. Twenty-four h later, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with biotinylated TNF (100 ng/ml in PBS; R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany) for 2 h on ice and then washed again with PBS and incubated at 37 °C under standard culture conditions. After 2 h, cells were fixed, permeabilized, and blocked as described before. Primary anti-Myc antibody (2 μg/ml (Invitrogen) in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin) was added, and cells were incubated at 4 °C overnight. The following day, cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dako) and Cy3-conjugated streptavidin (Dako) for 1 h at room temperature. Murine L929 cells stably expressing p75TNFR (L929 p75TNFR),icp75TNFR (L929 icp75TNFR), icp75TNFR Δ TNF (L929 icp75TNFR ΔTNF) or mock-transfected cells (L929 pcDNA3.1) were seeded at a density of 1 × 105. Cells were transiently transfected with an NFκB-dependent luciferase reporter plasmid or cotransfected with the NFκB-dependent luciferase reporter plasmid and the expression plasmids encoding icp75TNFR ΔTRAF or icp75TNFR Δ TNFdeletion mutants using DOTAP (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sixteen h after transfection cells were incubated with medium with or without 20 ng/ml mouse TNF for 6 h, and luciferase activity was assayed using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's directions. Each transfection was done in triplicate and repeated at least three times. While studying the transcriptional regulation of the humanp75TNFR it was realized that this promoter sequence lacks a consensus TATA element within the first few hundred base pairs proximal to the translational start site ATG, whereas several TATA elements are located further upstream of the translational start site. To determine whether these TATA elements are active transcriptional initiation sites we performed primer extension analysis using RNA derived from THP-1 cells. Two oligonucleotides complementary to the nucleotides +16 to −19 in the cDNA and 5′-UTR (primer 2) and complementary to the nucleotides −795 to −835 in the 5′-flanking region (primer 1) were used as primers (Fig. 1,bottom). The primer extension analysis identified two transcriptional start sites within the 5′-flanking region of thep75TNFR gene. One of them is located at position −47 (TSI) relative to the translational start site, whereas a second transcriptional start site can be localized at position −870 (TSII) relative to the translational start site (Fig. 1, top). We previously reported about two functional major start sites of transcription in the promoter of the mouse p75TNFR gene (15Seitz C. Männel D.N. Hehlgans T. Genomics. 1998; 48: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To identify the corresponding cDNA complementary to the mRNA originating from TSII we performed RT-PCR using a 5′-primer located at position −858 to −826 and a 3′-primer located at the 3′-end of thep75TNFR cDNA (Fig.2 A). Three independent cDNA clones were isolated and revealed sequence identity. Primary sequence analysis indicated that transcriptional initiation at TSII within the 5′-flanking region of the p75TNFR gene results in a novel p75TNFR cDNA. Comparison of the twop75TNFR cDNAs indicated sequence identity in the extracellular (ED), transmembrane (TM) and intracellular domain (ID). In contrast, the newp75TNFR cDNA isoform lacks the 5′-UTR and the first exon of p75TNFR (Fig. 2 A). Alignment with the genomic sequence further shows that the mRNA transcript initiated at TSII generates a splice donor site at position −600, which fuses the newly transcribed exon 1a to the splice acceptor site at the 5′-end of exon 2 of the p75TNFR transcript. The fusion of this new exon 1a generates an open reading frame (ORF 1a) by positioning the ATG at −681 in frame with exon 2 of the p75TNFR transcript as a potential translational initiation codon (Fig. 2 B). Thus, the ORF 1a of the new p75TNFR transcript generates a cDNA that encodes for a mature p75TNFR preceded by a stretch of 27 amino acids encoded by exon 1a (Fig. 2 C). To address the question whether exon 1a encodes a putative signal sequence, we compared the predicted amino acid sequences of the p75TNFRcDNA (amino acids 1–26) and the new p75TNFR cDNA(amino acids 1–27) using two different signal peptide prediction methods (SignalP V1.1 and PSORT II, data not shown). Although the first 26 amino acids of p75TNFR were identified as a signal peptide capable of directing a nascent protein to the cell surface, no similarity to any known targeting sequence can be found within the first 27 amino acids of the new p75TNFR. To determine the expression pattern of icp75TNFR mRNA, we performed RT-PCR analysis using a primer specific for the 5′-end oficp75TNFR cDNA and a 3′-primer annealing in the second exon of the icp75TNFR cDNA resulting in a 360-base pair PCR product. From various cell lines cDNA was prepared and the PCR products were verified by hybridization with a probe specific for the 5′-untranslated region of the icp75TNFR cDNA. Whereas no icp75TNFR mRNA could be detected in HEK 293 and HepG2 cells, HeLa, Kym-1, THP-1, as well as HMEC cells expressed the icp75TNFR mRNA (Fig. 2 D). Furthermore, stimulation of HUVEC and U937 cells with lipopolysaccharide resulted in an up-regulation of icp75TNFR mRNA suggesting that the icp75TNFR expression is regulated by proinflammatory stimuli (Fig. 2 E). The same cell lines that were positive for the icp75TNFR were also found positive for p75TNFR mRNA expression in parallel experiments (data not shown). Compared with the p75TNFR mRNA expression level, the relative abundance of the icp75TNFR mRNA seemed much lower in all cell lines and primary cells we have tested so far. Transient expression of the icp75TNFR cDNA with a C-terminal V5 His-tag in HeLa cells followed by purification and Western blot analysis using an antibody to V5 resulted in detection of a single protein band with an apparent molecular mass of ∼50 kDa (Fig. 3 A, lane 2), whereas no protein expression was detected in wild-type Hela cells (Fig. 3 A, lane 1). Thus, the identified ORF 1a generated by the use of TSII and subsequent alternative splicing of the p75TNFR mRNA resulted in the icp75TNFR protein with an expected molecular mass. The elucidated molecular mass of icp75TNFR is very close to the calculated value of 48.5 kDa. In contrast, it has been shown in previous studies that the expression of thep75TNFR cDNA results in a protein signal ∼75 kDa using Western blot analysis. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with Myc-taggedicp75TNFR cDNA and incubated with biotinylated human TNF followed by simultaneous staining with FITC-coupled anti-Myc antibody and Cy3-coupled streptavidin (Fig. 3 B). In contrast to the staining of TNF bound to endogenous TNFRs in wild-type HeLa cells, which is visible as clustering in close proximity to the nucleus, the staining pattern of HeLa cells overexpressing icp75TNFR protein was characterized by a dispersed intracellular receptor staining that was colocalized with biotinylated TNF. This result indicates that the icp75TNFR protein is capable of binding TNF. To further characterize the icp75TNFR protein, immunohistochemical staining of transiently transfected mouse L929 cells was performed using different mAbs as well as a polyclonal antiserum raised against the human p75TNFR protein. We observed positive staining in L929 cells transfected with either the p75TNFR or icp75TNFRcDNA indicating that the icp75TNFR is indistinguishable from p75TNFR by the use of a polyclonal anti-human p75TNFR serum and by all mAbs we have tested so far (Fig. 3 C). No difference was observed in fluorescence-activated cell sorter staining experiments when U937 cells were either nontreated for staining of membrane p75TNFR or when the cell membrane was perforated for intracellular staining (data not shown). In both cases the staining of the p75TNFR protein was clearly enhanced after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. To investigate the subcellular localization of the icp75TNFR protein we performed immunohistochemical staining of transiently transfected HeLa cells expressing either of the two p75TNFR cDNA isoforms fused to a C-terminal Myc-tag. Staining with an anti-Myc antibody revealed that the expression of p75TNFR can easily be recognized on the cell surface of the transiently transfected HeLa cells (Fig.4 A). In contrast, the expression of icp75TNFR was localized predominantly in the intracellular compartment (Fig. 4 B), whereas no specific staining was detected in cells transfected with expression plasmid alone (Fig. 4 C). The result of an EPR analysis, which provides a computer-based digital-confocal imaging, confirmed intracellular expression of the icp75TNFR protein characterized by a diffuse intracellular staining (Fig. 4 D). Colocalization of icp75TNFR with a mitochondrial marker was recognized only to a small extent. Because there have been several reports in the past correlating the expression level of p75TNFR with NFκB activation (16Aggarwal B.B. Natarajan K. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1996; 7: 93-124PubMed Google Scholar) we asked whether the expression of icp75TNFR would influence the TNF-induced activation of NFκB in L929 cells. L929 cells stably transfected with the cDNA of p75TNFR or icp75TNFR were tested for their ability to activate a NFκB-dependent reporter gene. Although expression of the p75TNFR protein in L929 cells resulted in only marginal activation of NFκB after treatment with TNF compared with a control transfection, a significant increase in NFκB activation was detected in L929 cells transfected with the cDNA for theicp75TNFR (Fig.5 A). In contrast L929 cells expressing icp75TNFR protein lacking the TNF binding domain are no longer capable of inducing NFκB after TNF treatment (Fig.5 B). This result indicates that ligand binding by the icp75TNFR protein is necessary for signal transduction and NFκB activation. It has been shown by mutational analysis within the cytoplasmic domain of p75TNFR that a C-terminal region responsible for the binding of TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) is indispensable for signal transduction and NFκB activation. Coexpression of ap75TNFR mutant, which lacks the TRAF2 domain, resulted in a dominant-negative effect implicating that this domain is essential for the response (17Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we tested whether the TRAF2 domain of icp75TNFR is also involved in signal transduction of the icp75TNFR. In fact, coexpression of icp75TNFR lacking the TRAF2 binding domain in the corresponding stably transfected L929 cells resulted in inhibition of TNF-induced NFκB activation (Fig. 5 C). This observation suggests that, also for the intracellularly expressed form of icp75TNFR, the TRAF2 domain is critical for signal transduction. In contrast, coexpression of icp75TNFR lacking the TNF binding domain did not reduce TNF-induced NFκB activation (Fig. 5 C). This supports the result of our previous experiment (Fig. 5 B) indicating that intracellular signaling by icp75TNFR seems to be ligand-dependent because coexpression of icp75TNFR Δ TNF, which is incapable of ligand-dependent oligomerization of its TRAF2 binding domains, did not interfere with TNF-induced NFκB activation. TNF exerts pleiotropic activities affecting proliferation, differentiation, or function in a wide variety of cell types (18Pfizenmaier K. Himmler A. Schütze S. Scheurich P. Krönke M. Beutler B. Tumor Necrosis Factors, The Molecules and Their Emerging Role In Medicine. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1992Google Scholar). In the past two distinct receptors for TNF, referred here to as p55TNFR and p75TNFR, have been characterized (19Tsujimoto M. Yip Y.K. Vilcek J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 82: 7626-7630Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Our present data identify a novel human p75TNFR mRNA isoform termed icp75TNFR, which originates from an additional transcriptional start site in the 5′-flanking region of the p75TNFR gene. The deduced ORF is characterized by sequence identity concerning the extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular receptor domains, but differs in the N-terminal sequence as well as in the 5′-untranslated region. Replacement of the leader sequence encoded by exon 1 by a novel sequence that does not contain characteristics for directing the protein into a specific cellular compartment suggests that the icp75 protein may not be transported to the cell membrane by the regular endosomal secretion pathway. The presence of the transmembrane domain in the icp75TNFR suggests that rather the protein remains inserted into a intracellular perinuclear membrane and not expressed in the cytoplasma. Our results indicate that the icp75TNFR protein is indistinguishable from p75TNFR using different mAbs as well as a polyclonal antiserum raised against human p75TNFR. This fact represents a major problem in the attempt to specifically detect endogenous icp75TNFR protein in cells that produce the membrane form of the p75TNFR at the same time. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the localization of the novel icp75TNFR is characterized by a diffuse intracellular staining pattern. Further evidence for intracellular expression of icp75TNFR was given by the observation that the expressed protein is detected with an apparent molecular mass of ∼50 kDa, which is close to the calculated value of the primary amino acid sequence (48.5 kDa). This suggests that no posttranslational modifications, e.g. glycosylation, occur by which the transmembrane form of the p75TNFR is characterized. Interestingly, Ledgerwood et al. (20Ledgerwood E.C. Prins J.B. Bright N.A. Johnson D.R. Wolfreys K. Pober J.S. O'Rahilly S. Bradley J.R. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 1583-1589PubMed Google Scholar) described a 60-kDa protein localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane of umbilical vein endothelial cells, which was recognized by a specific mAb against human p75TNFR and was also capable of binding TNF. Our data show that the icp75TNFR protein was recognized by all mAbs raised against human p75TNFR that we have tested so far including the one used by Ledgerwoodet al. EPR analysis showed that in addition to diffuse intracellular staining a small amount of icp75TNFR protein possibly was colocalized with a mitochondrial marker. The difference in the staining pattern may be due to overexpression of icp75TNFR in our experiments. Specific staining of endogenous icp75TNFR protein by cytochemistry or fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis was not possible so far because no reagents are available that can distinguish between the membrane form of the p75TNFR and the icp75TNFR. More detailed localization studies have to be done to dissect the expression pattern of two p75TNFR isoforms. Overexpression of icp75TNFR induced significant NFκB activation in L929 cells after TNF stimulation suggesting that this receptor subtype is capable of triggering signaling events in a TNF-dependent manner. L929 cells stably transfected with the p75TNFR cDNA encoding the transmembrane receptor subtype as confirmed by immunocytochemical staining and RT-PCR analysis show only a marginal TNF-induced increase in NFκB-dependent reporter gene activation compared with the control cells. It has been shown previously that p75TNFR is capable of inducing NFκB activation and that for this signal transduction the TRAF2 binding domain is indispensable (17Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). This also seems to be the case for NFκB activation by the icp75TNFR protein arguing for a direct involvement in TNF-mediated signaling. It remains to be analyzed whether TNF has to be internalized by the transmembrane receptors as described earlier (19Tsujimoto M. Yip Y.K. Vilcek J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 82: 7626-7630Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar), by a suggested TNFR-independent mechanism (20Ledgerwood E.C. Prins J.B. Bright N.A. Johnson D.R. Wolfreys K. Pober J.S. O'Rahilly S. Bradley J.R. Lab. Invest. 1998; 78: 1583-1589PubMed Google Scholar), and/or whether endogenously produced TNF is responsible for activation of icp75TNFR followed by intracellular signaling. In addition, the functional consequences of such intracellular TNF signaling via the icp75TNFR is currently under investigation. We thank Dr. Matthias Grell for the anti-p75TNFR antibodies and helpful discussions."

The dedifferentiation of VSM cells in vivo or in cell culture is characterized by a loss of contractile proteins such as smooth muscle-specific α-actin and myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC). Serum increased the expression of contractile proteins in neonatal rat VSM cells, indicating a redifferentiation process. RNase protection assays defined thrombin as a serum component that increases the abundance of SM-MHC transcripts. Additionally, serum and thrombin transiently elevated cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations, led to a biphasic extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, up-regulated a transfected SM-MHC promoter construct, and induced expression of the contractile proteins SM-MHC and α-actin. Pertussis toxin, N17-Ras/Raf, and PD98059 prevented both the serum- and thrombin-induced second phase ERK phosphorylation and SM-MHC promoter activation. Constitutively active Gαq, Gαi, Gα12, and Gα13 failed to up-regulate SM-MHC transcription, whereas Gβγ concentration-dependently increased the SM-MHC promoter activity. Furthermore, the Gβγ scavenger β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 C-terminal peptide abolished the serum-mediated differentiation.

In chronic vascular diseases such as hypertension and atherosclerosis, VSM cells proliferate and undergo a phenotypic modulation characterized by local matrix degradation and a loss of contractile function (1Ross R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). In vivo, dedifferentiated VSM cells can gradually revert toward a more contractile phenotype (2Aikawa M. Sakomura Y. Ueda M. Kimura K. Manabe I. Ishiwata S. Komiyama N. Yamaguchi H. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Circulation. 1997; 96: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Interest in the underlying mechanisms and participating signal transduction pathways leading to altered phenotypes of VSM cells has led to extensive study of the VSM cell phenotype both in vivo and in vitro (for review, see Ref. 3Shanahan C.M. Weissberg P.L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Differentiated VSM cells are characterized by high expression levels of contractile proteins such as smooth muscle α-actin (SM-α-actin) and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC) (4Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). The expression of SM-MHC isoforms SM-1 and SM-2 is restricted to smooth muscle cells (5Nagai R. Larson D.M. Periasamy M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1047-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 6Nagai R. Kuro-o M. Babij P. Periasamy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9734-9737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is down-regulated in proliferating cells (7Aikawa M. Kim H.S. Kuro-o M. Manabe I. Watanabe M. Yamaguchi H. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 748: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). High expression levels of SM-1/2, therefore, are valuable markers for the differentiated phenotype of VSM cells. Similar to pathological proliferation during vascular disease, VSM cells down-regulate SM-1/2 expression in primary culture. Although cultured VSM cells initially retain SM-1/2 expression when cultured on laminin or under serum-free conditions, they undergo morphological changes toward a dedifferentiated phenotype within a few days (8Hedin U. Bottger B.A. Forsberg E. Johansson S. Thyberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Patterns of gene expression similar to those in cultured VSM cells from neonatal rats have been observed in neointimal cells within injured vessels (9Majesky M.W. Benditt E.P. Schwartz S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1524-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Neonatal VSM cells can, therefore, provide anin vitro model for studying phenotypic modulation processes in vascular disease. The mechanisms and signaling pathways that induce a phenotypic modulation toward the contractile phenotype of VSM cells are still largely elusive. It has been shown that application of mechanical forces can actively change the VSM phenotype (10Wilson E. Mai Q. Sudhir K. Weiss R.H. Ives H.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 741-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Depending on extracellular matrix composition, cultured VSM cells can either proliferate or differentiate in response to mechanical strain (11Reusch H.P. Wagdy H. Reusch R. Wilson E. Ives H.E. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1046-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). These findings were corroborated recently by applying mechanical forces to cultured whole vessels (12Zeidan A. Nordstrom I.

Interestingly, phenotypic modulation of VSM cells depends on the activation of mitogen- activated protein kinases (MAP kinases) in both experimental settings. In many cellular systems, the receptor-mediated proliferation and differentiation involves the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) subfamily of MAP kinases (13Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Cell. 1997; 90: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 14Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar). ERKs are part of a multikinase module through which a variety of extracellular stimuli (growth factors, differentiation signals, and cellular stress) are transmitted into the cell (15Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4225) Google Scholar). Receptor tyrosine kinases, upon autophosphorylation and activation of adaptor proteins, recruit Ras and subsequently engage the Raf/MEK/ERK cascade. Alternatively, G protein-coupled receptors have been shown to stimulate ERKs via the Gi, Gq, or G12/13 subfamilies of heterotrimeric G proteins. In addition, transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases has been demonstrated to participate in signaling from G protein-coupled receptors to ERKs (16Linseman D.A. Benjamin C.W. Jones D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12563-12568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 17Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A.

Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar). Receptor-mediated signaling pathways that alter the phenotype of VSM cells are poorly defined. We therefore studied receptor-mediated pathways in neonatal rat VSM cells and in particular their participation during phenotypic modulation. Our findings clearly indicate that Gβγ subunits released from the Gisubfamily of heterotrimeric G proteins mediate enhanced expression of contractile proteins in VSM cells. Culture media and trypsin were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal calf serum and phosphate-buffered saline were obtained from Biochrom. Radiochemicals were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Maxiscript and RPA II kits from Ambion were used for RNase protection assays. The anti-SM-1/SM-2 antiserum was kindly provided by Berlex Pharmaceuticals. Pertussis toxin (PTX), recombinant platelet derived growth factor (PDGF-BB), bisindolylmaleimide, and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate were obtained from Calbiochem. Thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP, SFLLRNPNDKYEPF) was purchased from Tocris. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. SM-MHC promoter-CAT construct was a generous gift from Cort S. Madsen, Charlottesville, VA. Dominant negative Ras/Raf constructs were kindly provided by Alan Hall, London. Constitutively active Gαi, Gαq, and Gα12/Gα13 constructs were from S. Offermanns, Heidelberg, Germany and M. I. Simon, Pasadena, CA. Gβγ expression plasmids were from L. Birnbaumer, Los Angeles, CA and M. I. Simon. βARK1ct was from R .J. Lefkowitz, Durham, NC. Primary cultures of VSM cells from newborn rats were established as described previously (19Ives H.E. Schultz G.S. Galardy R.E. Jamieson J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1978; 148: 1400-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (complete medium; CM), 2% tryptose phosphate broth, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 units/ml streptomycin. In all experiments, cells from passages 10–15 were used. Growth arrest was induced in a serum-free quiescent medium (QM) containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 4 mg/ml transferrin instead of serum. Prior to agonist application, cells were maintained in QM for 48–72 h. Where indicated, cells were pretreated with 200 ng/ml PTX for 12–18 h. The transcriptional regulation of SM-1/SM-2 was assessed with a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene expressed under the control of the MHC promoter (nucleotides −1346 to +25, pCAT-1346) (20Madsen C.S. Hershey J.C. Hautmann M.B. White S.L. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6332-6340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For transient transfection assays, cells were seeded into six-well plates at a density of 7.5 × 104 cells/well (60–80% confluence) and growth arrested in QM for 48 h prior to transfection. Transient transfections were performed in triplicate with 1 μg of plasmid DNA and 10 μl/well Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) for 5 h. After 48 h, cell lysates were prepared using the CAT enzyme assay system (Promega). CAT activities were normalized to the protein concentration of each sample as measured by the BCA assay. Transfection of a promoterless CAT construct served as a base-line indicator, allowing all other promoter constructs to be expressed relative to promoterless activity. All CAT activities (means ± S.E.) represent at least three independent transfection experiments with each setting tested in triplicate per experiment. Cotransfection of a viral promoter/β -galactosidase or LacZ construct to control for transfection efficiency was discontinued because variations in transfection efficiency among independent experimental samples are small (≤ 10%). Furthermore, it has been shown that such constructs interfere with SM-specific promoters, presumably because of competition for common transcription factors (21Shimizu R.T. Blank R.S. Jervis R. Lawrenz-Smith S.C. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7631-7643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). VSM cells were grown to confluence on Nunc chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International). After fixation in 1% formaline in phosphate-buffered saline and methanol, a monoclonal anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (anti-PCNA) antibody (1:100; DAKO) was incubated for 1 h at 20 °C in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum. A secondary, biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) and streptavidin-conjugated Texas Red (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were applied for detection. After the PCNA staining, SM-α-actin was detected by using a monoclonal antibody (1:150; Sigma) and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse (1:40, Dianova). Representative visual fields were exposed sequentially by applying appropriate filter sets. VSM cells were lysed directly in 1 × Laemmli buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol. Proteins were separated on polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. SM myosin isoforms were separated on 4% gels and detected with a polyclonal anti-SM-1/SM-2 antiserum (1:1,000). This antiserum has been characterized previously (11Reusch H.P. Wagdy H. Reusch R. Wilson E. Ives H.E. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1046-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). ERK1/2 were separated on 10% gels and probed with affinity-purified polyclonal anti-phospho-ERK1/2 or with anti-ERK1/2 antibodies (New England Biolabs) to confirm equal loading of the gels. Primary antibodies were detected with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (1:2,000, New England Biolabs) using a chemiluminescence substrate (Lumiglo, New England Biolabs). RNA isolation, generation of DNA templates, and hybridization conditions have been described previously (11Reusch H.P. Wagdy H. Reusch R. Wilson E. Ives H.E. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1046-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In brief, 10 μg of total RNA was hybridized with a radiolabled probe covering the alternatively spliced C-terminal exons of SM-1 and SM-2 variants of rat SM-MHC. After overnight incubation at 42 °C, nonhybridized fragments were digested with a diluted RNase A/T1 mixture. The remaining protected fragments (380 nucleotides for SM-2 and 261 nucleotides for SM-1) were separated by denaturing (8% urea) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and exposed to Amersham Hyperfilm at −80 °C for 2–24 h. Bands were excised and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Equal loading was controlled by hybridization of a second aliquot with a rat glutaraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase-radiolabled probe. Cells were seeded on 24-mm glass coverslips and grown for 24 h prior to loading with 2–4 μm fura-2 in a buffer (Hepes-buffered saline) containing 135 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes pH 7.4, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Coverslips were mounted in a monochromator-equipped (TILL-Photonics) inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss). Fura-2 was excited alternately at 340 nm and 380 nm. Emitted light was filtered (505 nm long pass) and recorded with a 12-bit CCD camera. After correction for background signals, intracellular [Ca2+]i was calculated as described (22Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). R max,R min, andFmin380 /Fmax380were determined in fura-2-loaded cells equilibrated for 3 h in Hepes-buffered saline supplemented with 1 μm ionomycin and either 10 mm Ca2+ or 10 mmEGTA, pH 7.8. The presence of serum is essential to grow VSM cells in primary cell culture. In addition to its mitogenic properties, we observed that fetal calf serum enhanced the expression of contractile proteins in neonatal rat VSM cells. Dual staining of PCNA and SM-specific α-actin or SM-MHC revealed that after short term (24 h) exposure to serum, PCNA expression was positive, whereas SM-α-actin was poorly detectable (Fig. 1 A). Continuous culturing in the presence of serum for an additional 4 days markedly enhanced the expression of SM-α-actin (Fig. 1 B) and SM-MHC (data not shown). Consistently, the expression of the SM-1 and SM-2 splice variants of SM-MHC were up-regulated by serum within 2–3 days as detected by immunoblotting of whole cell lysates normalized for their protein content (Fig. 1 C). Serum withdrawal reduced SM-α-actin and SM-1/SM-2 expression again within 48 h to about 20% of the expression levels in the presence of serum, demonstrating that alterations in contractile protein expression are bidirectional (data not shown). Thus, serum contains factors capable of inducingin vitro redifferentiation of rat neonatal VSM cells. Because serum contains multiple growth factors, vasoactive peptides, and other agonists mediating their responses through activation of several signaling pathways, we analyzed which receptor-coupled pathways are involved in increasing SM-MHC transcription. RNase protection assays revealed that SM-1/SM-2 transcripts are 22 ± 1.2-fold more abundant in serum-treated (CM) VSM cells compared with serum-starved controls (QM). The relatively low expression levels of SM-1/SM-2 in serum-starved VSM cells allowed us to study the effect of single compounds on SM-1/SM-2 expression. Neither 1 μmangiotensin II nor 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB altered the SM-1/SM-2 expression significantly, whereas treatment with 10 ng/ml transforming growth factor-β resulted in a further reduction of SM-1/SM-2 steady-state expression (Fig. 2). In contrast, 1 unit/ml thrombin increased SM-1/SM-2 expression by the 10 ± 0.9-fold. The substantial increase in SM-1/SM-2 steady-state expression most likely represents an up-regulation of the transcriptional activity, although changes in RNA stability and/or turnover cannot be ruled out. Because the inhomogeneous response to vasoactive peptides may rely on the presence or absence of the corresponding receptors in cultured VSM cell preparations, functional coupling of receptors in VSM cells was characterized by single cell [Ca2+]i analysis. 0.1 unit/ml thrombin induced transient elevations of [Ca2+]i in more than 95% of VSM cells after a lag phase of 10–20 s (Fig.3). To exclude unspecific, receptor-independent effects of the serine protease thrombin, we applied TRAP, which corresponds to the intramolecularly tethered ligand of the PAR-1 receptor. Indeed, 80 μm TRAP induced similar calcium transients without a typical protease lag phase (Fig.3). Addition of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) induced calcium responses in about 60% of the cells. Only a few cells (less than 10%) were activated by 1 μm angiotensin II. Challenging VSM cells with PDGF-BB (10 ng/ml) elicited a delayed and more sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i, characteristic for ligands binding to tyrosine kinase receptors (Fig. 3). 100 μm carbachol failed to raise [Ca2+]i in VSM cells, indicating the absence of endothelial cell contaminations (data not shown). Using single cell [Ca2+]i analysis, we demonstrated that PAR receptors, endothelial differentiation gene receptors, and PDGF receptors are present and functional in the majority of VSM cells. Because both proliferative and differentiating signals can be transmitted via ERK1/2, depending on the cellular context and the transient or sustained character of their activation, we studied the kinetics of ERK phosphorylation in VSM cells. A rapid and transient phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was elicited by serum, PDGF-BB, EGF, thrombin, TRAP, LPA, and to a lower extent by angiotensin II. The early ERK1/2 phosphorylation was maximal after 3–5 min for all agonists. Only serum, thrombin, TRAP, and LPA elicited a delayed second phase ERK phosphorylation (Fig.4 A). The second phase ERK phosphorylation appeared ∼45 min after agonist application and rose continuously for another 2 h. In contrast, a delayed ERK phosphorylation was absent in response to PDGF-BB, EGF, or angiotensin II. The weak and monophasic ERK1/2 activation by angiotensin II may rely on low AT1 receptor expression in our VSM cell preparation (Fig. 3). The early ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but not the late phase ERK activation, correlated closely with the ability of agonists to raise [Ca2+]i. Consistently, Ca2+ ionophores (1 μm ionomycin or 1 μmA23187) induced early but not delayed ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4 B). Permanent activation of protein kinases C by 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate resulted in a monophasic and sustained ERK1/2 activation (Fig.4 B). Thus, in VSM cells, three distinct temporal patterns of ERK1/2 phosphorylation are elicited by different receptor ligands, Ca2+ ionophores, or phorbol esters. Enhanced SM-1/SM-2 expression in response to thrombin (Fig. 2) is indicative of a G protein-mediated regulation of the SM-MHC promoter activity. To characterize signaling pathways that control transcription of contractile proteins, we studied the SM-MHC promoter activity by using a CAT reporter gene construct expressed under the control of the −1346 nucleotide promoter region of the SM-MHC gene (pCAT-1346). In the absence of serum, CAT activities in VSM cells transfected with pCAT-1346 were ∼4–6-fold higher compared with cells transfected with a promoterless pCAT-basic vector. Serum treatment further increased the CAT activity by 5.1 ± 0.5-fold (Fig. 5 A). Expression of CAT driven by an SV40 promoter (pCAT-control) was about 4-fold higher compared with the SM-MHC promoter in the presence of serum (data not shown). Transfection of pCAT-1346 in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts did not significantly induce CAT activity irrespective of the absence or presence of serum (data not shown). In serum-starved VSM cells transfected with pCAT-1346, the addition of 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB, 10 ng/ml EGF, 10 μm LPA, or 1 unit/ml thrombin resulted in a 1.1 ± 0.1-, 1.2 ± 0.1-, 2.1 ± 0.2-, and 2.0 ± 0.1-fold increase in CAT activity over control cells incubated in serum-free QM (Fig. 5 A). These data confirm that increases in SM-1/SM-2 mRNA steady-state concentrations (Fig. 2) indeed result from transcriptional activation. Furthermore, the reporter gene assay allows for analysis of signaling cascades by applying genetically encoded modulators. To define participation of members of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade, the reporter gene construct pCAT-1346 was cotransfected with expression plasmids encoding dominant negative N17-Ras or N17-Raf. In all cotransfection experiments the total amount of transfected plasmid cDNA was kept constant by adding cDNA encoding promoterless pCAT-basic. The thrombin-stimulated CAT activity was abrogated by coexpression of dominant negative N17-Ras or N17-Raf in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5 B). Conversely, coexpression of the Raf C terminus increased CAT activity about 2-fold in the absence of agonists (data not shown). Additionally, the MEK inhibitor PD98059 largely reduced the thrombin-stimulated SM-MHC promoter activity (Fig. 5 C). Because PD98059 was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, the effect of the solvent on the SM-MHC promoter activity was assessed in parallel. Dimethyl sulfoxide (up to 0.5%) further increased the thrombin-stimulated CAT activity almost 1.8-fold, an effect that was also blocked by PD98059. The observed half-maximal inhibitory concentration of PD98059 (3–5 μm) is well in line with its described IC50to inhibit ERK1/2 phosphorylation (23Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3249) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, in VSM cells the serum- or thrombin-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation was largely reduced by 5–20 μm PD98059 and abolished by 50 μm MEK inhibitor (data not shown). These higher concentrations, however, exhibited a toxic effect during long term incubation of VSM, thereby precluding a subsequent determination of SM-MHC promoter activity. Both modulations, expression of dominant negative Ras/Raf and pretreatment of VSM cells with PD98059, also impaired the serum-mediated up-regulation of the SM-MHC promoter (data not shown). These data strongly suggest that the thrombin- and serum-induced increase in SM-1/SM-2-expression depends on an intact Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade. Furthermore, the ability of different agonists to up-regulate the SM-MHC promoter activity correlated closely with a biphasic and sustained ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The transient elevation of [Ca2+]i and biphasic ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by thrombin could be mimicked with the tethered ligand of the PAR-1 receptor, TRAP. PAR-1 receptors couple to the Gi, Gq, and G12/13 subfamilies of heterotrimeric G proteins (24Gudermann T. Kalkbrenner F. Schultz G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 429-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The putative involvement of G12/13 in the regulation of the SM-MHC promoter was tested by overexpressing constitutively active (GTPase-deficient) mutants of Gα12 (pCIS/Gα12 Q229L) and Gα13 (pCIS/Gα13 Q226L). Both constructs and their combination failed to induce SM-MHC promoter activity significantly over a wide range of transfected cDNA concentrations (data not shown). The biological activity of these constructs has been demonstrated previously by their ability to induce contraction of VSM cells (25Gohla A. Schultz G. Offermanns G. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Gq and Gi proteins couple to phospholipases Cβ to release [Ca2+]i from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive stores. The possible role of the Gi class of heterotrimeric G proteins was assessed by pretreating cells with 200 ng/ml PTX for at least 18 h. Inactivation of Gi proteins by this protocol was demonstrated by a more than 80% reduction of [Ca2+]i signals in response to LPA (Fig. 6 A). PTX reduced the peak [Ca2+]i after thrombin stimulation by about 40% (Fig. 6 A). The partial block of thrombin-induced [Ca2+]itransients in PTX-pretreated VSM cells reflects coupling to both Gi and Gq/11. To test further whether the Gi subfamily also participates in the prolonged ERK1/2 activation, serum-starved VSM cells were pretreated with PTX. Subsequent addition of serum, thrombin, and LPA left early ERK1/2 phosphorylation almost unaltered, whereas the second phase of ERK1/2 activation was completely abrogated in PTX-pretreated cells (Fig.6 B). Because sustained ERK activation may be required for the regulation of transcriptional activity, we tested whether PTX pretreatment affects the ligand-induced SM-MHC promoter activity. In addition to the modulation of ERK1/2 signaling, PTX treatment abolished the thrombin-induced up-regulation of the SM-MHC promoter activity (Fig.7 A). Moreover, even the strong induction of the SM-MHC promoter by serum was reverted completely in PTX-pretreated VSM cells. This indicates that all serum components that are involved in the up-regulation of the SM-MHC promoter depend on the presence of functional Gi proteins. Because either the α or the βγ subunits may transmit the signal that results in SM-MHC expression, we coexpressed the constitutively active Gαi (Q205L) together with pCAT-1346. Gαi (Q205L), however, even reduced the SM-MHC promoter activity below base-line values (Fig. 7 B). On the contrary, coexpression of Gβ1 and Gγ2 mimicked the receptor-mediated up-regulation of the SM-MHC promoter in a concentration-dependent fashion. Expression of neither Gβ1 nor Gγ2 alone was sufficient to increase the activity of the cotransfected CAT reporter. Consistent with an essential role of Gβγ, coexpression of the Gβγ-scavenging C-terminal peptide of the β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 (βARK1ct) concentration-dependently reverted the serum-induced activation of the SM-MHC promoter (Fig.7 C). Finally, the Gi protein-dependent redifferentiation in response to thrombin and serum was confirmed by analyzing the expression of contractile proteins in untransfected cells. In whole cell lysates from VSM cells stimulated with thrombin or serum and normalized for protein content, an increased expression of SM-α-actin and of SM-MHC was detected (Fig.8). When incubated in the continuous presence of PTX, thrombin and serum failed to increase the expression of both contractile proteins (Fig. 8). Hence, these data demonstrate that Gβγ released from Gi proteins link proximal signaling to the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade to mediate the in vitro redifferentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells shown in Fig. 1. In this study we describe a receptor-mediated signaling pathway leading to differentiation of VSM cells. The thrombin-induced SM-MHC expression is transmitted via the Ras/Raf signaling cascade and leads to a biphasic temporal pattern of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Pertussis toxin abrogated both the second phase ERK1/2 phosphorylation and the up-regulation of contractile proteins in response to serum, thrombin, and LPA. Because coexpression of Gβγ subunits mimicked and βARK1ct abrogated the activation of the SM-MHC promoter in response to serum components, we conclude that Gβγ mediate the agonist-induced differentiation of VSM cells. A limited number of reports describe a phenotypic modulation of mature VSM cells toward a more contractile phenotype. Vasoconstrictors such as"

CT comprises five identical B-subunits, which bind specifically to GM1 ganglioside on the cell membrane, and one A-subunit (CTA) that has enzymatic activity. CTA is cleaved into amino-terminal A1 and carboxyl-terminal A2 peptides by a bacterial protease acting at arginine 192. A1 and A2 are linked by a disulfide bridge between cysteine 199 and cysteine 187, reduction of which releases enzymatically active A1-subunit capable of ADP-ribosylating Gαs, a stimulatory regulator of adenylyl cyclase, leading to persistent activation of adenylyl cyclase with accumulation of cAMP (1Gill D.M.

This concept was initially derived from reports that brefeldin A (BFA), which reversibly disrupts the Golgi architecture (5Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J.

Thereafter, immunofluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation studies demonstrated that both CTA and CTB are transported to Golgi, followed by CTA transfer to the ER (8Bastiaens P.I.H.

The budding of COP1-coated vesicles requires ARF1, a 20-kDa guanine nucleotide binding protein, which recruits COP1 coats to the membrane (14Serafini T. Orci L. Amherdt M. Brunner M. Kahn R.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1991; 67: 239-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). ARF was discovered as an activator of CT-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gαs (15Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6228-6234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ARFs belong to a multigene family, related to the Ras GTPase superfamily. Like other GTPases, ARF with GDP-bound is inactive, whereas the GTP-bound form is active. ARF1 activation is regulated by specific guanine nucleotide-exchange proteins (GEPs) (16Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21431-21434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar,17Morinaga N. Tsai S.-C. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12856-12860Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), which accelerate the binding of GTP to ARF1, and thereby ARF1-GTP binding to membranes with subsequent recruitment of COP1 coat proteins from the cytosol. ARF1-GTP is inactivated by an ARF1 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) (18Makler V. Cukierman E. Rotman M. Admon A. Cassel D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5232-5237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), one of which is recruited from cytosol to the transmembrane KDEL receptor (Erd2). The interaction of Erd2 and GAP is enhanced by KDEL protein (19Aoe T. Cukierman E. Lee A. Cassel D. Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. EMBO J. 1998; 16: 7305-7316Crossref Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Inactivated ARF-GDP dissociates from the vesicle along with bound COP proteins. This uncoating is necessary for vesicle fusion with a target membrane. Thus, cycling of ARF1 between GDP and GTP forms is necessary for effective vesicular trafficking. Six mammalian ARFs are now known. They are divided into three classes, with ARF1, 2, and 3 in class I, ARF4 and 5 in class II, and ARF6 in class III. ARF6 is most structurally different among the ARFs. It is localized in the plasma membrane and endosomes, where it participates in endocytosis and recycling of the plasma membrane (20D'Souza-Schorey C. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 21Altschuler Y. Liu S.-H. Katz L. Tang K. Hardy S. Brodsky F. Apodaca G. Mistov K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Unlike ARF6, class I and II ARFs are associated with Golgi and ER, as well as endosomes, suggesting overlapping functions. There are reports showing the differences among ARFs in their regulatory proteins (22Claude A. Zhao B.-P. Kuziemsky C.E. Dahan S. Berger S.J. Yan J.-P. Armold A.D. Sullivan E.M. Melançon P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 71-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and effectors (23Shin O.-H. Ross A.H. Mihai I. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36609-36615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of ARF1 in CT action in intact cells, ARF1 mutants, inactive ARF1(T31N), “a GDP mutant,” and constitutively active ARF1(Q71L), “a GTP mutant” (24Zhang C.-J. Rosenwald A.C. Willingham M.C. Skuntz S. Clark J. Kahn R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 25Dasher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were used. To detect CT activity, morphological changes of CHO cells were quantified. As expected for a process dependent on Golgi transport, CT-induced morphological changes in CHO cells were suppressed by BFA. The expression of either ARF1 mutant decreased CT-induced morphological changes in CHO cells. This effect appeared specific to ARF1 because ARF5 and ARF6 had no effect, suggesting that CT trafficking leading to CHO cell morphological changes depends on cycling of ARF1, but not ARF5 or ARF6. 8-Bromo cAMP (8Br-cAMP), brefeldin A (BFA), and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) were purchased from Sigma. CT was from List Biological laboratories. FuGENE6 transfection reagent was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Monoclonal antibody against GFP was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Polyclonal rabbit anti-βCOP and anti-HA (Y-11) antibodies were from Affinity Bioreagents and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies were from Sigma. FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was from ICN Pharmaceutical. The cAMP assay kit was from Cayman Chemical. CHO cells were grown at 37 °C in Eagle's MEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml), in humidified air with 5% CO2. Exponentially growing CHO cells were harvested and transferred to 6-well plates (3 × 104 cells/well). Eagle's MEM supplemented with 1% FCS (2 ml/well) was added with or without CT. After incubation for 4–8 h in a CO2 incubator, cells were fixed and inspected microscopically to determine the percentage of cells with morphological changes. More than 100 cells were counted in each plate. Cells overexpressing ARF were transferred to 6-cm plates (8 × 104/plate) with coverslips (24 × 45 mm), incubated without or with CT, fixed, and analyzed as described. Freshly trypsinized cells were transferred to 6-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well) and incubated overnight at 37 °C in Eagle's MEM with 10% FCS. Medium was changed and BFA was added. After incubation for 30 min, 0.5 mm IBMX was added, followed 30 min later by 10 nm CT; 2 h later, cells were washed with PBS, and cAMP was extracted in 6% trichloroacetic acid solution at 4 °C for 30 min. Trichloroacetic acid was removed from samples by ether extraction before assay of cAMP according to instructions in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit of Cayman Chemical. Samples of DNA were incubated for 15 min at room temperature with 5 μl of FuGENE6 in 100 μl of optiMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) before addition to 50–80% confluent cells. After incubation for approximately 16 h, cells were used for experiments. The GFP and HA tags allowed quantification of extent of transfection by fluorescence microscopy or by Western analysis of samples of cell homogenates. Sequences of all plasmid clones were confirmed by sequencing. cDNAs for ARF1 and ARF1 mutants were constructed in pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen). To ligate ARF1 or mutant DNA in this vector, an NheI site was introduced upstream of the initiation codon and a BamHI site was inserted after the termination codon. These sites were used for ligation of all constructs into pcDNA3.1+. For ARF1, PCR was performed with forward primer, F3 (5′-CTGTCCGCTAGC ATGGGGAACATCTTCGCCAA-3′) and reverse primer, R5 (5′-AGGGGATCC TCACTTCTGGTTCCGGAGCTG-3′). Theboldface sequence in F3 is the NheI site, and in R5 the BamHI site. The italic sequence in F3 is the initiation codon, and in R5 the termination codon. PCR product was ligated into pcDNA 3.1+. For ARF1(T31N) construction, the first PCR was performed with forward primer F3 and reverse primer R3 (5′-AAGCTTGTAGAGGATCGTGTTCTTCCCTGCAGCATCCA-3′), where theitalic T is the mutated base. The other PCR employed forward primer F4 (5′-TGGATGCTGCAGGGAAGAACACGATCCTCTACAAGCTT-3′) and reverse R5. The italic A is the mutated base. Both PCR products were gel-purified before use as templates for the second PCR with primers F3 and R5 to synthesize full-length ARF1(T31N). The PCR product was ligated into pcDNA 3.1+ vector. For ARF1(Q71L), two PCR products, one with forward primer F3 and reverse primer R4 (5′-CAGGGGCCGGATCTTGTCCAGGCCACCCACGTCCCACA-3′), and the other PCR with forward primer F5 (5′-TGTGGGACGTGGGTGGCCTGGACAAGATCCGGCCCCTG-3′) and reverse primer R5 were prepared. Mutated bases are represented by italic A in F3 and T in F5. Both PCR products were gel-purified before use as templates for the second PCR using F3 and R5 to synthesize full-length ARF1(Q71L), which was ligated into pcDNA 3.1+ vector. All ARF1, ARF1(T31N), and ARF1(Q71L) constructs were transformed into DH5α-competent cells. EGFP fusion ARF1 and ARF1 mutants (referred to subsequently as,e.g. GFP-ARF1) were prepared by PCR-based amplification from ARF1 and mutant cDNA in pcDNA3.1+. Forward primer was 5′-CCTGCTAGCCACCATGGGGAACATCTTCGCAAC-3′ (boldface is an NheI site; initiator ATG isunderlined) and reverse primer, 5′-CAGCTCCGGAACCAGAAGGATCCCCT-3′ (boldface is aBamHI site). PCR product was ligated into pEGFP-N1(CLONTECH). HA epitope-tagged ARF1 and ARF1 mutants were produced by PCR-based amplification of ARF1 and ARF1 mutant cDNA in pcDNA3.1+ vector. Forward primer was the same used to prepare GFP fusion ARF1 and reverse primer was 5′-AGGGGATC CTA AGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTACTTCTGGTTCCGGAGCTG (italic sequence is the termination codon,boldface is a BamHI site, and the HA-tag sequence is underlined). PCR product was digested withNheI and BamHI and ligated into pcDNA3.1+ vector that had been digested with NheI andBamHI. GFP-ARF5 and mutant fusion constructs were produced by PCR-based amplification from ARF5 cDNA. For GFP-ARF5, forward primer 5′-TCTGCTAGCCACCATGGGCCTCACCGTGTCCGCGCT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AGGGGATCCTTGCGCTTTGACAGCTCGT-3′ were used.Boldface sequences in forward and reverse primers areNheI and BamHI sites, respectively. Amplified products were digested with NheI and BamHI and ligated in pEGFP-N1 vector that had been digested with the same enzymes, which was then transformed into DH5α-competent cells. To construct HA-tagged ARF5, reverse primer was 5′-AGGGGATCC TA AGCCTAGTCTGGGACGTCGTATGGGTAGCGCTTTGAGAGCTCGT-3′. Forward primer was the same as that used to prepare GFP-ARF5. Amplified product was digested with the NheI and theBamHI and ligated in pcDNA3.1 that had been digested with the same enzymes, which was then transformed in DH5α competent cells. ARF5(T31N) and ARF5(Q71L) mutants were generated by site-specific mutagenesis using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The primers used were 5′-GGATGCGGCTGGCAAGAACCACAATCCTGTACAAAC-3′ and 5′-GAAAGTACAGGATTGTGTTCTTGCCAGCCGCATCC-3′ for ARF5(T31N), and 5′-GGACGTGGGAGGCCTGGACAAGATTCGGC-3′ and 5′-GCCGAATCTTGTCCAGGCCTCCCACGTCC-3′ for ARF5(Q71L). Mutated bases are shown in italics. For HA-tag constructs, ARF6 cDNA was amplified from ARF6pET7 (26Massenburg D. Han J. Liyanage M. Patton W.A. Rhee S.G. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11718-11722Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) by PCR with forward primer 5′-CCGGAATTC ATGGGGAAGGTGCTATCCAAAATCTTC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GGCAGATCT TTA AGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTAAGATTTGTAGTTAGAGGTTAAC-3′.Boldface are EcoRI and XbaI restriction sites, respectively. HA-tag sequence isunderlined, and italics represent the starting and termination codons, respectively. The PCR product was purified and ligated in-frame to the EcoRI- and XbaI-digested pXS expression vector. For GFP fusion construct, ARF6 cDNA was amplified from ARF6pET7 by PCR with forward primer 5′-TATCTCGAG ATGGGGAAGGTGCTATCCAAAATCTTC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ATAGTCGACAGATTTGTAGTTAGAGGTTAAC-3′.Boldface sequences are XhoI and SalI sites, respectively. Italic is the starting codon. The PCR product was purified and ligated in-frame to the XhoI- andSalI-digested pEGFP-N1 expression vector. ARF6(T27N) and ARF6(Q67L) mutant were generated by site-specific mutagenesis using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. ARF6(T27N) was generated by PCR with forward primer 5′-GACGCGGCCGGCAAGACTACAATCCTGTACAAG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CTTGTACAGGATTGTAGTCTTGCCGGCCGCGTC-3′. ARF6(Q67L) was generated by PCR with forward primer 5′-TGGGATGTGGGCGGCCTGGACAAGATCCGGCCG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CGGCCGGATCTTGTCCAGGCCGCCCACATCCCA-3′.Italicized sequences indicate mutated bases. Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, incubated with 50 mmNH4Cl for 10 min, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 4 min. Then cells were treated with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h for blocking. To identify the HA epitope, cells were incubated with polyclonal anti-HA antibody followed by cy3-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit IgG antibody. For double staining of HA-tagged ARF and βCOP, cells were incubated with monoclonal anti-HA antibody (1:400) as a primary antibody and then FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:3000) for 1 h as a secondary antibody. To identify βCOP, polyclonal rabbit anti-βCOP antibody (1:2000) was the primary antibody and cy3-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit IgG (1:3000) was used as the secondary antibody. All procedures used were performed at room temperature, and, following each step, cells were washed with PBS three times. When CHO cells, which had been detached with trypsin, were incubated with 10 nm CT, 60–80% of the cells became bi-polar in shape or less frequently showed polymorphic shape changes. Most of the untreated cells were round even after overnight culture (usually fewer than 5% of cells changed their morphology) (Fig.1). Similar morphological changes were induced by treatment with dibutyryl cAMP, 8Br-cAMP, or forskolin, a direct activator of adenylyl cyclase (data not shown). Appearance of the morphological changes was about 1 h later with CT than with 8Br-cAMP (Fig. 2), corresponding to the time needed for CT internalization and activation (27Kassis S. Hagmann J. Fishman P.H. Chang P.P. Moss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12141-12152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 2Effect of CT and 8Br-cAMP on CHO cell morphology. Cells were incubated in the presence of 10 nm CT (open square) or 0.5 mm8Br-cAMP (closed square). At the indicated time, cells were fixed and morphology was evaluated microscopically. More than 100 cells were examined at each time to calculate percentage of morphologically changed cells. The data are average of two plates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) BFA was used to determine whether an intact Golgi complex was necessary for CT action on CHO cells. BFA is a fungal metabolite that reversibly disrupts Golgi structure by stabilizing an ARF1GEP·ARF1-GDP complex, thereby preventing ARF1 activation (28Robineau S. Chabre M. Antonny B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 29: 9913-9918Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the presence of BFA, CT-induced morphological changes were reduced (Fig. 3 A). BFA treatment also suppressed the accumulation of cAMP (Fig.3 B). These data suggested that ARF1 activation is necessary for CT action on CHO cells. To confirm this, we examined the effects of overexpression of ARF1 dominant negative and constitutively active mutants on the CT-induced morphological changes in CHO cells. CHO cells were transfected with pEGFP expression vector and GFP fusion wild type or mutant ARF1 constructs. Expression was observed initially at 8 h, and the percentage of cells expressing the GFP fusion proteins gradually increased to a maximum at 37 h, where it remained for at least 50 h (data not shown). Transfection efficiency was 2∼5% in CHO cells. Western blotting of cell homogenate proteins demonstrated expression of ARF1 and ARF1 mutants using anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 4). The localization of ARF1 and ARF1 mutants in CHO cells was examined by fluorescence microscopy. ARF1 localized to the cytosol and Golgi region whereas ARF1(T31N) (GDP-bound) was chiefly cytosolic. On the other hand, ARF1(Q71L) (GTP-bound) was concentrated in the Golgi region, as expected if ARF-GTP were membrane-associated (data not shown). Effects of GFP-ARF1 on CT-induced morphological changes were examined. After CT addition, cells were fixed at the indicated times, and morphology was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy for comparison with that of control cells (FuGENE6-treated). As shown in Fig. 5, ARF1 overexpression did not change the rate of appearance of CT-induced morphological changes. GFP fusion ARF1 mutants were transfected to evaluate the importance of ARF1 function in CT action. CT-induced changes in morphology of ARF1-expressing cells were similar to control cells (FuGENE 6-treated) and to cells transfected with vector alone (Fig.6 A). In cells expressing ARF1(T31N) or ARF1(Q71L) mutants, CT-induced morphological changes were significantly suppressed. To confirm that this effect was not related to GFP, HA epitope-tagged ARF1 and ARF1 mutants were expressed in CHO cells and CT action was determined. In this experiment, expression was detected by indirect immunostaining method using anti-HA rabbit antibody and then cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody. The localization of expressed proteins was similar to that of GFP-ARF fusion proteins. Transfection efficiency was less than 1%, much lower than that with GFP fusion proteins. Western blotting results are shown in Fig. 4. CT effects on cells expressing mutant proteins were less than on cells expressing ARF1; the results are similar to those obtained with GFP fusion proteins (Fig. 6 B). In mammalian cells, there are six ARFs. Among them, ARF6 is the most divergent and is grouped in class III. ARF6 localizes to the plasma membrane and endosomes and does not participate in Golgi to ER trafficking. Therefore, ARF6 seems not to be involved in CT action. To confirm this, the effects of wild type ARF6, ARF6(Q67L)(GTP-bound), and ARF6(T27N)(GDP-bound) mutants were evaluated. ARF6 and ARF6(T27N) and ARF6(Q67L) mutants were expressed as GFP fusion proteins and HA-tagged proteins. The rate of CT-induced morphological changes in cells expressing GFP-ARF6 fusion protein was similar to that of cells expressing vector (Fig. 7 A). No effect of ARF6(Q67L) was observed. Furthermore, the ARF6(T27N) mutant did not suppress CT action on CHO cells, although clear suppression was observed in ARF1 mutants expressing cells (Fig.7 B). HA-tagged ARF6 was also used to examine the CT effect, and a similar result was obtained (data not shown). These data suggested that ARF6 did not participate in CT action on CHO cells. To examine whether ARF5 affected CT action in CHO cells, GFP fusion and HA-tagged wild type ARF5 constructs, and ARF5(T31N)(GDP-bound) and ARF5(Q71L)(GTP-bound) mutants were investigated. Expression was confirmed by Western blotting and shown in Fig. 4. Cellular localization of GFP fusion ARF5 protein was compared with GFP fusion ARF1 and HA epitope-tagged ARF6 (Fig. 8). ARF5 localized to perinuclear region and cytosol similar to ARF1. Some ARF5 colocalized with βCOP. Q71L mutants of ARF1 and ARF5 were localized to the perinuclear region, and ARF1(Q71L) was mostly colocalized with βCOP, but ARF5(Q71L) less so (Fig.9). HA-tagged ARF6 and ARF6(Q67L) did not colocalize with βCOP and were in part associated with plasma membrane. ARF5(T31N) was more sparsely distributed throughout cells than was wild type ARF5 (data not shown).Figure 9Subcellular localization of GTP-bound ARFs. Expression constructs of GFP-ARF1(Q71L) or GFP-ARF5(Q71L) or HA-ARF6(Q67L) were transfected into CHO cells, and 16 h later, colocalization with βCOP was determined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Morphological changes induced by CT in cells expressing GFP-ARF5(T31N) were slightly suppressed, but less so than with ARF1(T31N) (Fig.10). No suppression was observed in ARF5(Q71L) mutant-expressing cells, although clear suppression was observed in ARF1(Q71L)-expressing cells. These data were similar to those obtained with HA epitope-tagged ARF5 (data not shown). To determine whether the ARF1 effect on CT-induced morphological changes was specific for CT action and was not effected by cAMP, the effect of 8Br-cAMP was examined on cells expressing ARF1 mutants. As shown in Fig. 11, 8Br-cAMP-induced morphological changes were observed in cells expressing ARF1(T31N) and ARF1(Q71L) mutants to the same extent as observed in cells expressing wild-type ARF1. In the same experiment, morphological changes induced by CT were suppressed, consistent with ARF1 mutants preventing the action of CT, but not that of cAMP. To determine the effect of ARF1 function in CT action in vivo, we used the dominant negative and constitutively active mutants of ARF1, ARF1(T31N) and ARF1(Q71L). Overexpression of wild type ARF1 did not accelerate the appearance of CT-induced morphological changes. Expression of either mutant of ARF1 suppressed morphological changes induced in CHO cells by CT more than did vector alone or wild type ARF1. Thus ARF1 cycling is necessary for CT action. The suppression, however, was not complete and some percentage of cells always showed changes in morphology, with a different percentage in each experiment. This may be the result of differences in levels of expression in different cells, with some cells not expressing mutant protein sufficient to suppress endogenous ARF1 function. Suppressive effects of class II and class III ARF mutants were not found. Reports of the functional overlap of class I and II ARFs include the inhibition of ER to Golgi transport by amino-terminal peptides of ARF1 and ARF4 (29Balch W.E. Kahn R.A Schwaninger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13053-13061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and rescue of ARF-deleted yeast by expression of ARF1 and ARF4 (30Kahn R.A. Kern F.G. Clark J. Gelmann E.P. Rulka C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2606-2614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The peptides in the former study, however, are probably not specific inhibitors of ARF function (31Weidman P.J. Winter W.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1815-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 32Fensome A. Cummingham E. Troung O. Cockcroft S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Mutants of ARF5, which like ARF4 belongs to class II, did not clearly suppress CT action, suggesting that ARF5 cycling is not necessary in CT action. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy did show differences between the GTP forms of ARF1 and ARF5 in localization with βCOP, consistent with their participation different pathways of vesicular transport. ARF6 (class III) did not affect CT action. ARFs are activators of CT-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of Gαs. In vitro, all ARFs are effective in this reaction. It is not known which ARF, or whether any ARF, is necessary for CT activation in intact cells. ADP-ribosylation of Gαs by CT in vitro requires GTP and phosphatidylcholine (33Kahn R.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7906-7911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting roles for ARF activation and a membrane environment. If ADP-ribosylation of Gαs occurs at the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane, near its effector adenylyl cyclase, ARF6 might be a good candidate because of its localization. Other ARFs are not localized at the plasma membrane. In our experiment, the GTP-bound form of ARF6 did not affect CT action, suggesting that it did not participate in activation of the toxin. It appears that all available data are most consistent with the notion that ARF1 influences CT action in cells by its critical physiological function in the required transport of CT from plasma membrane through the Golgi and ER.

https://openalex.org/W2064252781,"Recent evidence suggests that extension of pseudopods during phagocytosis requires localized insertion of endomembrane vesicles. The nature of these vesicles and the processes mediating their release and insertion are unknown. COPI plays an essential role in the budding and traffic of membrane vesicles in intracellular compartments. We therefore assessed whether COPI is also involved in phagosome formation. We used ldlF cells, a mutant line derived from Chinese hamster ovary cells that express a temperature-sensitive form of εCOP. To confer phagocytic ability to ldlF cells, they were stably transfected with Fc receptors type IIA (FcγRIIA). In the presence of functional COPI, FcγRIIA-transfected ldlF cells effectively internalized opsonized particles. In contrast, phagocytosis was virtually eliminated after incubation at the restrictive temperature. Similar results were obtained impairing COPI function in macrophages using brefeldin A. Notably, loss of COPI function preceded complete inhibition of phagocytosis, suggesting that COPI is indirectly required for phagocytosis. Despite their inability to internalize particles, COPI-deficient cells nevertheless expressed normal levels of FcγRIIA, and signal transduction appeared unimpeded. The opsonized particles adhered normally to COPI-deficient cells and were often found on actin-rich pedestals, but they were not internalized due to the inability of the cells to extend pseudopods. The failure to extend pseudopods was attributed to the inability of COPI-deficient cells to mobilize endomembrane vesicles, including a VAMP3-containing compartment, in response to the phagocytic stimulus.

Microorganisms become internalized into a membrane-bound vacuole called a phagosome, which subsequently matures upon fusion with endosomes and lysosomes into a powerful microbicidal organelle (1Beron W. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Mayorga L. Stahl P.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 100-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The phagocytic capacity of neutrophils and macrophages is remarkable; individual cells can take up multiple and/or very large particles. As a result, the area of membrane internalized is significant and has in some cases been estimated to approach or exceed the total initial surface area of the phagocyte (2Werb Z. Cohn Z.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2439-2446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the internalization of a considerable membrane expanse, no net loss of surface has been detected, and, in fact, surface gains have been documented electrophysiologically (3Holevinsky K.O. Nelson D.J. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 2577-2586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and by spectroscopic means (4Gonzalez-Rothi R.J. Straub L. Cacace J.L. Schreier H. Exp. Lung Res. 1991; 17: 687-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These observations therefore suggest that active exocytosis of endomembranes accompanies phagocytosis. Pharmacological studies have in fact suggested that secretion of endomembranes is essential for optimal phagocytosis. First, inhibitors of phospholipase A2 precluded phagocytosis, with a concomitant accumulation of clear vesicles under the site of particle attachment (5Lennartz M.R. Yuen A.F. Masi S.M. Russell D.G. Buttle K.F. Smith J.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2041-2052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, Cox et al. (6Cox D. Tseng C.C. Bjekic G. Greenberg S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1240-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) found that inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase by wortmannin, which can inhibit exocytosis, prevented phagocytosis of large particles, with comparatively minor effects on the ingestion of smaller ones. Third, botulinum and tetanus toxins, which interfere with SNARE-mediated membrane fusion, were found to induce partial inhibition of phagocytosis (7Hackam D.J. Rotstein O.D. Sjolin C. Schreiber A.D. Trimble W.S. Grinstein S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11691-11696Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Finally, it was shown that exocytic vesicles enriched in VAMP3, a v-SNARE that mediates secretion of recycling vesicles (8Galli T. Chilcote T. Mundigl O. Binz T. Niemann H. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), were locally secreted at sites of phagocytosis (9Bajno L. Peng X.R. Schreiber A.D. Moore H.P. Trimble W.S. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Jointly, these studies suggest that extension of pseudopods during particle engulfment involves the focal exocytosis of endomembrane vesicles. The mechanisms mediating the formation and traffic of these putative vesicles are not understood. However, existing information regarding endomembrane traffic may be applicable to the genesis of phagosomes. In particular, COPI has been convincingly shown to participate in the budding and traffic of vesicles between the Golgi complex and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1(10Hobbie L. Fisher A.S. Lee S. Flint A. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20958-20970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Guo Q. Vasile E. Krieger M. J.

Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1747-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 14Gu F. Aniento F. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1183-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). COPI exists as a protein complex in the cytosol and can assemble on docking sites of membranes, where it promotes the fission of vesicles (15Scales S.J. Gomez M. Kreis T.E. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 195: 67-144Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Wieland F. Harter C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We therefore considered the possibility that COPI may participate in the process of phagosome formation. To this end, we used brefeldin A (BFA), which inactivates the GTP exchange factors of adenosine ribosylation factor, to inhibit COPI or the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mutant cell line called ldlF, originally isolated by Hobbie et al. (10Hobbie L. Fisher A.S. Lee S. Flint A. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20958-20970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These cells harbor a temperature-sensitive mutation in the gene encoding εCOP, a component of COPI (10Hobbie L. Fisher A.S. Lee S. Flint A. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20958-20970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Guo Q. Vasile E. Krieger M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1213-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). When incubated at the permissive temperature (34 °C), such cells express functional εCOP, while incubation at the restrictive temperature (≥39 °C) results in destabilization and rapid degradation of the mutant εCOP, thereby inactivating COPI (10Hobbie L. Fisher A.S. Lee S. Flint A. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20958-20970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Guo Q. Vasile E. Krieger M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1213-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). While extremely useful for the study of COPI function, ldlF cells are not phagocytic. In order to analyze the role of COPI in phagocytosis, ldlF cells were stably transfected with Fc receptors (FcγRIIA). Such heterologous transfection of opsonin receptors was shown earlier to confer phagocytic capacity to nonmyeloid cells, including CHO cells (17Botelho R.J. Hackam D.J. Schreiber A.D. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15717-15727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 18Hackam D.J. Rotstein O.D. Schreiber A. Zhang W. Grinstein S. J. Exp.

We found that, like CHO cells, ldlF cells transfected with FcγRIIA (called FcR-ldl hereafter) effectively internalized IgG-opsonized particles when grown at the permissive temperature. However, following down-regulation of COPI, phagocytosis was progressively and drastically inhibited. Evidence is provided that COPI is indirectly required for phagocytosis by maintaining a VAMP3-containing endomembrane pool that appears to be required for pseudopod extension during FcγR-mediated phagocytosis. Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester, zymosan, FM1–43, rhodamine-123, and rhodamine-phalloidin were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Hepes-buffered medium RPMI 1640, 0.8-μm dyed latex beads, BFA, and cycloheximide were obtained from Sigma. 125I-Diferric human transferrin (125I-Tfn) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and [35S]methionine/cysteine was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. pEGFP, the plasmid encoding GFP, was fromCLONTECH. The VAMP3-GFP chimera was previously described (9Bajno L. Peng X.R. Schreiber A.D. Moore H.P. Trimble W.S. Grinstein S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Human IgG was from Baxter Healthcare Corp. (Glendale, CA). Rabbit anti-GFP and anti-catalase antibodies were from Molecular Probes, Inc. and Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), respectively. The rabbit polyclonal antibodies to εCOP, α-mannosidase II, and calnexin were generous gifts from Drs. M. Krieger (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA), K. Moremen (Emory University, Atlanta, GA), and David Williams (University of Toronto), respectively. Mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibody mixture, containing equivalent amounts of monoclonal antibodies PY-7E1, PY-1B2, and PY-20 was fromZymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Mouse anti-FcγRIIA monoclonal antibody IV.3 and the anti-β1-integrin monoclonal antibody, 7E2, were from Medarex (Annandale, NJ) and from the Developmental Hybridoma Studies Bank (Iowa City, IA), respectively. Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Sheep erythrocytes (SRBC) and goat and rabbit anti-SRBC antibodies were from ICN/Cappel (Aurora, OH). The murine macrophage cell lines, J774 and RAW 264.7, were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). RAW macrophages were transfected with Fugene 6, as described by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). ldlF cells, bearing a thermolabile mutation in the εCOP, were the generous gift of Dr. M. Krieger. Wild-type CHO and ldlF cells were stably transfected with FcγRIIA cDNA using calcium phosphate, yielding FcR-CHO and FcR-ldl cells, respectively. All cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and maintained under 5% CO2. Unless otherwise indicated, FcR-CHO cells were grown at 37 °C, and FcR-ldl cells were grown at 34 °C. For down-regulation of COPI, FcR-ldl cells were placed at the restrictive temperature of 39 °C for the specified periods. Alternatively, cells were incubated with 100 μm BFA for the indicated periods, followed by phagocytosis in the continuous presence of BFA. To assess phagocytosis, SRBC were opsonized with goat or rabbit anti-SRBC IgG (1:40 for 1 h at 37 °C) and then washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline to remove unbound IgG. The opsonized SRBC were added to plated phagocytic cells (∼10 SRBC/cell) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Extracellular SRBC were then removed by a brief (30-s) hypotonic lysis in water, and internalized SRBC, which resist lysis, were quantified under Nomarski optics. To assess particle adherence, FcR-CHO cells or FcR-ldl cells were incubated with opsonized SRBC for 30 min at 4 °C. Nonadherent SRBC were removed by washing in phosphate-buffered saline, and the number of bound SRBC/cell was quantified under light microscopy. Zymosan particles and 0.8-μm latex beads were opsonized with 1 mg/ml human IgG and washed as described above. To label F-actin, cells were fixed for up to 3 h with 4% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated with rhodamine-phalloidin (0.01 unit/ml phosphate-buffered saline). To stain for α-mannosidase II, calnexin, catalase, and phosphotyrosines, fixed and permeabilized cells were incubated with a 1:100, 1:1000, 1:500, or 1:100 dilution of the respective antibodies for 1 h and subsequently incubated for 1 h with fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies used at 1:1000. To stain for GFP, fixed, nonpermeabilized VAMP3-GFP-transfected cells were incubated with a 1:600 dilution of rabbit anti-GFP antibody followed by Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit at 1:1000. FcR-ldl (not permeabilized) cells were stained with a 1:50 dilution of anti-FcγRIIA and undiluted anti-β1-integrin antibodies to quantitate surface expression of FcγRIIA and β1-integrin, respectively. Fluorescence was analyzed using either a Leica model TCS4D or a Zeiss LSM 510 laser confocal microscope. Composites of confocal images were assembled and labeled using Photoshop (Adobe, Mountain View, CA) and Microsoft Powerpoint software. Quantification of immunofluorescence was performed using Scion Image (Scion Image, MA). Surface β1-integrin was quantified using fixed, nonpermeabilized cells attached to glass coverslips by confocal microscopy. This was accomplished by acquiring confocal optical slices at a constant interval and integrating the total cellular fluorescence by stacking the collected slices. Fluorescence intensity of the reconstructed images was quantified using Scion Image. For flow cytometry, the cells were immunostained as above and then scraped off the coverslips in ice-cold divalent cation-free phosphate-buffered saline. After washing, the cells were analyzed as in Ref. 7Hackam D.J. Rotstein O.D. Sjolin C. Schreiber A.D. Trimble W.S. Grinstein S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11691-11696Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar. Cells grown on glass coverslips were incubated overnight at either 34 or 39 °C and then loaded with fura-2 by incubation with 10 μm of the parental acetoxymethyl ester for 30 min. Coverslips were then mounted in a thermostatted Leiden holder on the stage of a Zeiss IM-35 microscope, equipped with a × 63 oil immersion objective. The microscope set-up has been previously described in detail (18Hackam D.J. Rotstein O.D. Schreiber A. Zhang W. Grinstein S. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Calibration of fluorescence ratio versus[Ca2+]i was performed as described (20Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). All measurements were at 37 °C. For scanning electron microscopy, cells were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde and postfixed with 1% OsO4. Following washing, the cells were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol. The samples were then critical point-dried in a Pelco CPD-2 critical point drying device and mounted on EM stubs with colloidal silver glue. They were then coated with evaporated gold/palladium with a Pelco sputter coater model 3 for 50 s at 18 mA. The samples were then examined with a Philips XL 30 scanning electron microscope. For transmission EM, cells were fixed as for scanning EM. The cells were washed extensively and then en bloc stained with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate for 30 min. Following washing, the samples were dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol and then embedded in Epon as we have described previously (21Robinson J.M. Okada T. Castellot Jr., J.J. Karnovsky M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1615-1622Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thin sections were cut and stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate and observed with a Philips CM-12 electron microscope. Samples were solubilized in Laemmli's sample buffer (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar), resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using the Protean II minigel system (Bio-Rad), and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were then immersed in blocking buffer (5% milk and 0.05% Tween 20) overnight at 4 °C. Blots were incubated with anti-εCOP antibody (1:8000) and anti-tubulin antibody (1:500) for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then washed three times for 10 min each in antibody buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.04% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.5) and next incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000) for 1 h. Membranes were washed and developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). FcR-ldl cells were either maintained at 34 °C or incubated at 39 °C for ≥12 h and then serum-starved for 1 h. The rate of receptor-mediated endocytosis of125I-Tfn was then measured by incubating cells with 0.4 μCi/ml of 125I-Tfn for either 10 or 30 min. Extracellular125I-Tfn was then washed and stripped with phosphate-buffered saline solution at pH 3.0. To measure the rate of125I-Tfn recycling, cells were incubated for 15 or 30 min in the absence of 125I-Tfn after a pulse of 30 min. All steps were performed at 37 °C. The cells were then lysed, and the amount of internalized 125I-Tfn was quantified with a γ counter. To study the role of COPI in phagocytosis, ldlF cells were stably transfected with FcγRIIA, yielding FcR-ldl cells. To verify that the mutation characteristic of ldlF cells persisted in FcR-ldl cells, the εCOP content of both cell types was assessed by immunoblotting following incubation at the permissive (34 °C) or restrictive (39 °C) temperature. For comparison, wild-type CHO stably transfected with FcγRIIA (FcR-CHO cells) were also analyzed. Tubulin, which is constitutively expressed in these cells in a temperature-independent manner, was used as a reference. When grown at 34 °C, both ldlF and FcR-ldl express εCOP, although at levels that are 2–4 times lower than that found in FcR-CHO cells (Fig.1 A). A similar differential expression of εCOP at 34 °C was reported earlier between ldlF and wild-type CHO cells (12Guo Q. Penman M. Trigatti B.L. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11191-11196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Incubation at the restrictive temperature for ≤18 h resulted in the complete disappearance of εCOP in ldlF and FcR-ldl cells but had no detectable effect on the expression of this protein in FcR-CHO cells (Fig. 1 A), as found earlier for wild-type CHO cells (12Guo Q. Penman M. Trigatti B.L. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11191-11196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The disappearance of εCOP was also apparent by analyzing the functional consequences of incubation at 39 °C. As illustrated in Fig. 1 B, i, the Golgi complex normally displays a tight juxtanuclear structure composed of cisternae and vesicles. Maintenance of this structure is known to depend on the continued function of COPI, which in turn requires the presence of εCOP (13Daro E. Sheff D. Gomez M. Kreis T. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1747-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar,14Gu F. Aniento F. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1183-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Degradation of εCOP in FcR-ldl cells was associated with dispersal of the juxtanuclear complex, resulting in a diffuse punctate staining of α−mannosidase II-reactive vesicles (Fig.1 B, iv). Dispersal of the Golgi complex was due to disappearance of εCOP and not to the temperature shift itself, since FcR-CHO cells were found to preserve their juxtanuclear Golgi cisternae after overnight incubation at 39 °C (Fig. 1 B,iii). In contrast to the Golgi complex, incubating cells at 39 °C did not appear to cause detectable changes to peroxisomes, mitochondria, and the ER. The punctate distribution of catalase, a marker of peroxisomes, was indistinguishable in cells incubated at 34 and 39 °C (not shown), implying that peroxisomes are able to import and retain this soluble protein in their lumen. Furthermore, rhodamine-123 accumulated normally in the mitochondria of cells incubated at 39 °C (Fig.1 C), indicating that the mitochondrial membrane potential was unaffected, which implies that the activity of the respiratory chain is normal. In addition, the reticulate morphology of the ER, revealed by immunostaining of calnexin, was similarly unaltered by prolonged incubation at the restrictive temperature (not illustrated). These results were consistent with ultrastructural analysis of thin sections by transmission EM, which showed no alterations in the structure or distribution of mitochondria or ER in cells treated at 39 °C (100 sections from three different experiments; not illustrated). Together, these observations imply that treatment of the cells at the restrictive temperature for ≤15 h does not induce wholesale, nonspecific disorganization of the cellular ultrastructure and that only organelles dependent on COPI for their homeostasis, such as the Golgi apparatus, undergo visible alterations, as shown previously (11Guo Q. Vasile E. Krieger M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1213-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 13Daro E. Sheff D. Gomez M. Kreis T. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1747-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 14Gu F. Aniento F. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1183-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Previously, it had been shown that ldlF cells stably transfected with FcγRIIA were able to internalize IgG-opsonized particles (17Botelho R.J. Hackam D.J. Schreiber A.D. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15717-15727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next investigated whether COPI is required for phagocytosis. FcR-ldl cells were maintained at either 34 or 39 °C and then exposed to IgG-opsonized SRBC to initiate phagocytosis. As illustrated in Fig.2 A and quantified in Fig.2 C, FcR-ldl cells maintained at the permissive temperature internalize SRBC effectively; phagocytosis occurred in upwards of 50% of the cells. This compares favorably with the phagocytosis efficiency of FcR-CHO cells (∼30%; Fig. 2 C). The greater phagocytic ability of FcR-ldl cells is most likely attributable to clonal differences. Depletion of εCOP by overnight incubation at 39 °C profoundly reduced the ability of FcR-ldl cells to perform phagocytosis. SRBC were observed in only 4 ± 3% of the εCOP-depleted cells. By contrast, FcR-CHO cells internalized SRBC slightly more effectively following incubation at 39 °C than when maintained at 34 °C. These observations imply that the effect noted in FcR-ldl cells is not due to the temperature per se but instead that the presence of COPI is essential for optimal phagocytosis. Consistent with the findings of Daro et al. (13Daro E. Sheff D. Gomez M. Kreis T. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1747-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) in ldl cells, the cells stably transfected with Fc receptors (FcR-ldl) were found to take up and recycle Tfn, albeit at reduced rates. As shown in Fig. 2 D, the initial rate of uptake was >2-fold lower in εCOP-depleted cells, although the extent of uptake after 30 min was only ∼30% lower. Also in agreement with Daro et al. (13Daro E. Sheff D. Gomez M. Kreis T. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1747-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we found that the slower rate of Tfn uptake was compensated by a reduced rate of recycling (Fig. 2 D, lanes 5–8), accounting for the nearly normal Tfn content at steady state. The reduced recycling of transferrin is consistent with the proposed role of COPI in traffic along the endocytic pathway. During the course of the phagocytosis experiments described above, a striking morphological difference between cells incubated in different conditions became apparent. When incubated at the restrictive temperature, FcR-ldl cells were found to become more rounded (Fig. 2, compare A and B). As before, the effect was attributable to the depletion of COPI and not to the incubation at 39 °C, since FcR-CHO cells maintained their spread morphology at this temperature (not shown). Further evidence that this effect was specifically related to loss of COPI was obtained by treating FcR-CHO and FcR-ldl cells (maintained at 34 °C) with the fungal metabolite BFA. BFA associates with and blocks the activity of nucleotide exchange factors that regulate ARF, thereby preventing the association of coatomer subunits with membranes (23Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 24Donaldson J.G. Cassel D. Kahn R.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6408-6412Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Treatment with 100 μm BFA for 30–60 min induced rounding of both cell lines (not shown). The cell rounding observed upon inactivation of COPI was associated with an apparent decrease in net surface area. This was determined by confocal microscopy, quantifying the amount of cell-associated FM1–43 (not shown), a dye that becomes fluorescent when it intercalates into the plasmalemma, thereby providing a measure of cell surface area (6Cox D. Tseng C.C. Bjekic G. Greenberg S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1240-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar,25Smith C.B. Betz W.J. Nature. 1996; 380: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The decrease in εCOP-depleted cells was reproducible and statistically significant, but since fluorescence is not a simple function of the area, the change in plasmalemmal surface was not quantified precisely. Several separate lines of evidence argue that rounding of COPI-deficient cells is not an indication of detrimental effects on cell function or viability. First, the cells remained impermeant to vital dyes and to the fluorescent dye FM1–43. Second, the cytosolic free calcium concentration, a sensitive measure of cell integrity and well being, was unaltered by depletion of εCOP (see below). Third, and as reported earlier for ldlF cells (13Daro E. Sheff D. Gomez M. Kreis T. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1747-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 14Gu F. Aniento F. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1183-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), FcR-ldl cells treated overnight at 39 °C displayed endocytosis and recycling of transferrin (Fig. 2 D). Fourth, the rate of incorporation of [35S]methionine/cysteine into newly synthesized proteins was not significantly changed (not shown). Fifth, peroxisomes, the ER, and mitochondria in εCOP depleted cells resembled those of control FcR-ldl cells, and the mitochondrial potential appeared unaffected. Sixth, cells responded to the addition of stimuli with increased tyrosine phosphorylation and actin assembly (see below). Finally, the effects of incubation at 39 °C were reversible. These findings imply that within the time period examined, suppression of COPI function does not cause generalized detrimental effects on the cell. In view of the apparent loss of surface area, the effects of COPI depletion on phagocytosis could result from alterations in Fc receptor expression, distribution, or function. This possibility was considered in the experiments illustrated in Fig.3. At the permissive temperature, FcγRIIA receptors were clearly observable by immunostaining on the plasmalemma of FcR-ldl cells (Fig. 3 A). Neither the distribution (Fig. 3 B) nor the amount of receptors appeared to be altered following incubation at the restrictive temperature. Quantitation of receptors by flow cytometry indicated that similar levels of FcγRIIA were exposed after incubation at 34 or 39 °C for 18 h in both FcR-CHO and FcR-ldl cells (Fig. 3 E). The abilit"
https://openalex.org/W2093871871,"Vaccinia virus early gene transcription is catalyzed by a multisubunit virion form of RNA polymerase that possesses a unique subunit, H4L. Prior studies from this laboratory showed that the NH2-terminal domain of H4L, containing amino acids 1–195, interacts with the COOH-terminal end of nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase I (NPH I), an ATPase that is employed in early gene transcription termination. Carboxyl-terminal deletion mutations of NPH I lose both the ability to mediate transcription termination and binding to H4L, providing evidence that the interaction between NPH I and H4L is required for termination. In order to test this model further, antibodies raised against segments of H4L were tested for their ability to inhibit transcription terminationin vitro. A bead-bound template was employed in these studies, which permitted us to separate transcription initiation from elongation and termination. Antibodies raised against H4L amino acids 1–256 inhibited termination in an in vitro assay using virus-infected cell extracts lacking NPH I, but antibodies raised against H4L amino acids 568–795 did not. Preincubation of anti-H4L1–256 antibodies with H4L fragments 1–256 or 1–195 prevented antibody inhibition of termination, demonstrating that inhibition was mediated by antibody binding to one or more epitopes in the NH2-terminal end of H4L. Antibody inhibition of termination is reduced in wild type virus-infected cell extracts containing NPH I. Furthermore, preincubation of a NPH I minus cell extract with NPH I prior to antibody addition, or readdition of NPH I to isolated ternary complexes prepared in the absence of NPH I, prevented antibody inhibition of transcription termination. These data show that NPH I and the inhibitory antibodies compete for a binding site(s) on H4L, providing further evidence that the H4L subunit of the vaccinia virus RNA polymerase plays a direct role in transcription termination.

Preincubation of anti-H4L1–256 antibodies with H4L fragments 1–256 or 1–195 prevented antibody inhibition of termination, demonstrating that inhibition was mediated by antibody binding to one or more epitopes in the NH2-terminal end of H4L. Antibody inhibition of termination is reduced in wild type virus-infected cell extracts containing NPH I. Furthermore, preincubation of a NPH I minus cell extract with NPH I prior to antibody addition, or readdition of NPH I to isolated ternary complexes prepared in the absence of NPH I, prevented antibody inhibition of transcription termination. These data show that NPH I and the inhibitory antibodies compete for a binding site(s) on H4L, providing further evidence that the H4L subunit of the vaccinia virus RNA polymerase plays a direct role in transcription termination. vaccinia early transcription factor nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase I vaccinia termination factor RNA polymerase-associated protein of 94 kDa antibody raised to H4L amino acids 1–256 antibody raised to H4L amino acids 258–556 antibody raised to H4L amino acids 568–795 wild type temperature-sensitive Vaccinia virus, the prototypic poxvirus, possesses a double-stranded DNA genome of 191,686 base pairs (1Goebel S.

Poxviruses, which replicate within the cytoplasm of the infected cell, evolved to encode the enzymes required to carry out viral DNA replication, transcription, and mRNA processing (2Moss B.

Studies with vaccinia virus revealed three temporal stages of gene expression: early, intermediate, and late. Capped and polyadenylated early mRNAs are synthesized within the virus particle immediately after infection (3Kates J.R. McAuslan B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Following early gene expression and the onset of DNA replication, intermediate genes are transcribed on a replicating template. Late gene transcription follows that of intermediate genes and employs a similar template. Transcription of each gene class requires class-specific transcription initiation factors and employs class-specific promoters. Host factors are also required for both intermediate (6Rosales R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 14323-14329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initiation is coupled to ATP hydrolysis by VETF (12Li J. Broyles S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20016-20021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which binds to the promoter sequence and recruits RNA polymerase to the template (13Li J. Broyles S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2773-2780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Only the virion RNA polymerase molecules containing RAP94 exhibit VETF-dependent transcription of a double-stranded DNA template possessing a viral early promoter (14Ahn B.Y. Gershon P.D. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7552-7557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike the other subunits of vaccinia virus RNA polymerase, RAP94 is present in submolar amounts and is synthesized exclusively late in infection, whereupon it is packaged into nascent virions (10Ahn B.Y. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3536-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Free H4L protein was not detected in virion extracts (10Ahn B.Y. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3536-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and was not dissociable from purified viral polymerase even under denaturing conditions (14Ahn B.Y. Gershon P.D. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7552-7557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Early viral genes are unique in that transcription terminates in a signal- and factor- dependent manner (15Rohrmann G.

Elongation proceeds through the sequence TTTTTNT in the nontemplate strand, yielding UUUUUNU in the nascent mRNA, which serves as a signal required for the termination event (18Shuman S. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21356-21360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Termination requires both the vaccinia termination factor (VTF; also serves as viral mRNA capping enzyme) (16Shuman S. Broyles S.S. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12372-12380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase I (NPH I), the product of gene D11L, as the ATPase employed in transcription termination (19Deng L. Shuman S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20Christen L.M. Sanders M. Wiler C. Niles E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 360-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). During infection, transcription termination is restricted to early genes. In vitro, only RNA polymerase capable of recognizing early promoters is subject to signal-dependent termination, demonstrating that this form of RNA polymerase is uniquely termination-competent (21Condit R.C. Lewis J.I. Quinn M. Christen L.M. Niles E.G. Virology. 1996; 218: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Prior work demonstrated a physical interaction between the COOH-terminal end of NPH I and the NH2-terminal end of the H4L subunit of the virion RNA polymerase (22Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25798-25804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, COOH-terminal NPH I mutants failed both to bind to H4L (22Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25798-25804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and to support transcription termination (20Christen L.M. Sanders M. Wiler C. Niles E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 360-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and transcript release (22Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25798-25804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), indicating that the interaction between NPH I and H4L is needed for these processes. The requirement for NPH I/H4L binding would explain the known restriction of transcription termination to early genes, since the H4L subunit is only found on the form of RNA polymerase that transcribes early genes. In order to test this model by a different approach, we evaluated the effect of region-specific H4L antibodies on early gene transcription termination, in vitro. We show that antibodies directed against the NH2-terminal region of H4L (representing amino acids 1–256) inhibit early gene transcription termination in an extract prepared from cells infected at the nonpermissive temperature with C50, a temperature-sensitive mutant virus. This extract lacks NPH I activity (20Christen L.M. Sanders M. Wiler C. Niles E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 360-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Preincubation of the antibodies with H4L fragments representing amino acids 1–256 or 1–195 prevented the antibody inhibition. Interestingly, antibody inhibition of transcription termination is reduced in a wild type virus-infected cell extract containing NPH I. Moreover, addition of NPH I to a C50 mutant virus-infected cell extract, lacking NPH I, or to a ternary complex isolated from a C50 mutant virus-infected cell extract, prevented antibody inhibition of termination. These results demonstrate that the amino-terminal end of H4L is required for early gene transcription termination and confirm the importance of the H4L/NPH I interaction in this process. Wild type (WT) vaccinia virus strain WR and the temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant virus, C50 (23Condit R.C. Motyczka A. Virology. 1981; 113: 224-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar,24Condit R.C. Motyczka A. Spizz G. Virology. 1983; 128: 429-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), were propagated in BSC40 African green monkey cells at 37 °C, or the permissive temperature for ts mutants, 31 °C, respectively, as described (23Condit R.C. Motyczka A. Virology. 1981; 113: 224-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Crude extracts of virus-infected cells were prepared by freeze/thaw, and infectious virus titer was determined by plaque assay on BSC40 cells at the permissive temperature, 31 °C, and the nonpermissive temperature, 40 °C. Polyclonal rabbit antisera were prepared against segments of the H4L subunit of the virion RNA polymerase, representing amino acids 1–256, 258–556, and 568–795. The IgG fraction of each antiserum was isolated using Affi-gel Protein A MAPS II kit (Bio-Rad) following the manufacturer's instructions. Protein A-agarose was packed in a column (10-ml Poly-Prep column, Bio-Rad) and washed with the binding buffer provided with the kit. One ml of antiserum was diluted 1:1 with the binding buffer and loaded onto a Protein A-agarose column. The unbound fraction of the serum was washed off the column, and the bound fraction (IgG) subsequently eluted with the elution buffer, pH 2.8. The eluates were collected in 1-ml fractions in tubes containing 200 μl of 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, to neutralize the eluates. The column effluent was monitored spectrophotometrically at 280 nm in order to detect the protein peaks. Fractions were pooled, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Proteins were resolved in a 12.5% polyacrylamide SDS gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was blocked with 3% gelatin and probed with the IgG fractions (diluted 1:500 in 1% gelatin) raised against MalE fusion proteins containing amino acids 1–256 or 568–795 of the H4L subunit of virion RNA polymerase. Following several washes, the membranes were incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG (diluted 1:3000 in 1% gelatin) conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. The alkaline phosphatase conjugate substrate (Bio-Rad) was then used for the development of immunoblots. For each immunoprecipitation, 5 μl of the IgG fraction (0.7 mg/ml) was employed with 1 μl of the35S-labeled transcription translation product in a total incubation of 200 μl. The reaction was incubated at 4 °C overnight with constant rocking. The antibodies were collected by the addition of 20 μl of Protein A-agarose, and the precipitate was washed four times as described (25Springer T.A. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Topics in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987: 10.16.01-10.16.10Google Scholar). The final pellet was resuspended in sample buffer, boiled, and applied to an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was then soaked in 1 m salicylic acid for 30 min and dried, and fluorography was then performed at −80 °C. Extracts of virus-infected cells were prepared by lysolecithin treatment, as described (21Condit R.C. Lewis J.I. Quinn M. Christen L.M. Niles E.G. Virology. 1996; 218: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A549 cells were infected with either wild type or ts mutant viruses at a multiplicity of infection of 15, at 37 °C or 31 °C, respectively. In the case of the ts mutant virus, after 24 h, the medium was removed and replaced with 40 °C medium containing 100 μg/ml cycloheximide. After an additional 24 h at 40 °C, cells were washed and treated with 250 μg/ml lysolecithin and extracts prepared. This procedure permits the initial synthesis of active NPH I, which is required for intermediate and late gene expression. After switching to 40 °C, the endogenous NPH I is inactivated and cycloheximide prevents the synthesis of new protein (20Christen L.M. Sanders M. Wiler C. Niles E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 360-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The plasmid template, pSBterm (21Condit R.C. Lewis J.I. Quinn M. Christen L.M. Niles E.G. Virology. 1996; 218: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), possesses tandem termination signals within the G-less cassette. Transcription reactions were carried out in a 20-μl total volume containing 6 μl of extract, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mm UTP, 20 μm CTP, 4 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (800 Ci/mmol), 0.1 mm 3′OMeGTP, 0.2 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA, 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 6 mm MgCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 8% glycerol for 30 min at 30 °C. When indicated, the virus-infected cell extracts were preincubated with the IgG fractions for 30 min on ice. After proteinase K treatment, RNA was isolated by extraction with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with isopropanol, and resuspended in formamide dye solution. Samples were heated at 90 °C and separated by electrophoresis in 5% acrylamide, 8 m urea gels, and the RNA was visualized by autoradiography. Termination efficiency was calculated as the molar ratio of terminated RNA to the sum of read-through and terminated RNA. Construction of the G21(TER29)A78 plasmid containing a vaccinia early promoter was described by Deng et al. (26Deng L. Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16562-19556Google Scholar); this plasmid was generously provided by Dr. Stewart Shuman. The prototype G21(TER29)A78 transcription unit consists of a synthetic early promoter fused to a 20-nucleotide G-less cassette, which is flanked by a run of three G residues at positions +21 to +23. A 57-nucleotide A-less cassette lies downstream of the G-less cassette and flanked at its 3′ end by four A residues at positions +78 to +81. A termination signal, TTTTTTTTT, lies within the A-less cassette, spanning position +29 to +37. The biotinylated 324-base pair DNA template was amplified by polymerase chain reaction employing a 5′ biotin tag on the upstream primer and isolated by preparative agarose gel electrophoresis. The purified DNA fragment was then immobilized to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads M280; Dynal) as described (27Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J.Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10050-10060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The bead-bound (B) template (typically, 100 fmol) was first incubated with 6 μl of C50 or WT virus-infected cell extracts, in the presence of 1 mmATP, 10 μCi of [α-32P]CTP (800 Ci/mmol), 0.1 mm UTP, and 0.625 mm 3′OMeGTP to synthesize the G21 transcript. The ternary complex was isolated, washed, and incubated in the presence or absence of the IgG fractions, or NPH I. When indicated, the IgG fractions were preincubated with H4L fragments for 20 min on ice, prior to incubation with the ternary complexes. The ternary complexes were collected by centrifugation and resuspended, and termination was then assessed after elongation in the presence of 1 mm UTP, 1 mm GTP, 1 mm CTP, and 1 mm ATP, and the presence or absence of VTF and NPH I. Elongation of the nascent RNA chains beyond the arrest site at G21 depended on removal of the blocking 3′OMeGMP moiety by the hydrolytic activity intrinsic to the vaccinia RNA polymerase elongation complex (28Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2166-2173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Elongation of the transcript beyond the G21 position, in the presence of all four NTPs, would yield a transcript of about 177 bases in length. Greater than 90% of the isolated ternary complexes were routinely elongated in the second RNA synthesis reaction. Signal-dependent termination would be expected to produce a family of RNA products about 70 bases in length. Termination efficiency was calculated as the molar ratio of terminated RNA to the sum of read-through and terminated RNA. pCITE-4a-H4L plasmid containing full-length H4L was constructed by inserting an NcoI-SalI DNA fragment derived from pET-14a-H4L (obtained from Dr. Stewart Shuman), containing the coding sequence of H4L, into theNcoI-SalI digested pCITE-4a. H4L retains a 5′ His6 tag encoded in pET-14a. pCITE-4a-H4L1–195was constructed by digesting the pCITE-4a-H4L plasmid withAccI restriction enzyme and religation of the digested construct. pET-30a-H4L1–195 was constructed by excising the DNA fragment corresponding to amino acids 1–195 from pCITE-4a-H4L1–195 construct, using NcoI andXhoI restriction enzymes, and inserting it into pET-30a (22Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25798-25804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Novagen Single Tube Protein system 3 (STP3) was used for the in vitro synthesis of 35S-labeled proteins directly from DNA templates containing T7 RNA polymerase promoter. The DNA template (typically 0.5 μg) was transcribed in 10 μl at 30 °C for 15 min, followed by the addition of 40 μl of translation mix, and incubated for another 60–90 min. pCITE-4a-derived recombinant plasmid was used. A recent report by Mohamed and Niles (22Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25798-25804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) showed that the NH2-terminal end of the H4L subunit of the virion RNA polymerase can interact with the COOH-terminal end of NPH I, a single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase. In addition, mutations in the COOH-terminal end of NPH I, which failed to bind H4L, also failed to mediate both transcription termination (20Christen L.M. Sanders M. Wiler C. Niles E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 360-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and transcript release (22Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25798-25804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that this interaction is required for early gene transcription termination and transcript release. In order to further investigate the involvement of the H4L subunit of the virion RNA polymerase in early gene transcription termination, we evaluated the effect of region-specific H4L antibodies on early gene transcription termination,in vitro. Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits against MalE fusion proteins containing segments of H4L, representing amino acids 1–256, 258–556 and 568–795 (Fig.1 A). The IgG fraction of each antiserum was isolated by adsorption to Protein A-agarose and subsequently eluted using a low pH elution buffer. The relative affinity of each of these IgG fractions to the H4L protein was examined in both immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses. Antibodies αH4L1–256 and αH4L568–795 precipitated35S-H4L to a similar extent (Fig. 1 B). In addition, each antibody exhibited similar reactivity to H4L in Western blot analyses (Fig. 1 C). These results demonstrate the specificity of the antibody fractions and show that both fractions, αH4L1–256 and αH4L568–795, have comparable affinity to H4L protein. In contrast, antibodies directed against H4L 258–556 exhibited low binding affinity toward H4L in both immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses (data not shown). Therefore, only αH4L1–256 and αH4L568–795were employed throughout the rest of the study. Prior work by Deng and Shuman (11Deng L. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14323-14329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using an anti-H4L antibodies directed against the NH2-terminal 364 amino acids of H4L, showed that the NH2-terminal region of H4L is required for early gene transcription initiation. In confirmation of these results and in an attempt to evaluate our antibody reagents, the following in vitro analyses were conducted. Transcription-competent extracts were prepared from cells infected with either wild type virus or C50 mutant (lacking NPH I) virus. To test the ability of the virus-infected cell extracts to mediate early gene transcription termination, the pSB24-term plasmid template (21Condit R.C. Lewis J.I. Quinn M. Christen L.M. Niles E.G. Virology. 1996; 218: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) was used (Fig.2 A). The plasmid template was designed to contain a G-less cassette possessing a tandem early gene transcription termination signal downstream from a strong synthetic vaccinia virus early promoter (21Condit R.C. Lewis J.I. Quinn M. Christen L.M. Niles E.G. Virology. 1996; 218: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Synthesis of a transcript that extends from the initiation site to the end of the G-less cassette yields a product of about 540 bases in length. Signal-dependent termination would be expected to produce a family of RNA products about 450 bases in length. Using the WT virus-infected cell extract, either control or pretreated with anti-H4L antibodies, transcription of pSB24-term was carried out in the presence or absence of exogenously added VTF, and the RNA products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2 B). In the absence of any added factor, a 55% termination efficiency was achieved. Addition of VTF enhanced the level of termination to about 78% without affecting total RNA synthesis. However, preincubation of the extract with antibodies directed against the NH2-terminal region of H4L (1) inhibited total RNA synthesis, whereas preincubation with antibodies directed against other regions of H4L did not diminish total RNA synthesis and had no effect on termination (Fig. 2 B). A similar pattern was obtained using C50 mutant virus-infected cell extract, which lacks NPH I (Fig. 2 C). As reported previously, synthesis of only the read-through product was seen in the C50 extract (20Christen L.M. Sanders M. Wiler C. Niles E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 360-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Addition of VTF alone did not significantly stimulate termination since NPH I was missing. However, addition of both VTF and NPH I enhanced the level of termination to about 66% (Fig.2 C). Preincubation of this extract with antibodies directed against the NH2-terminal region of H4L (1) inhibited total RNA synthesis, whereas antibodies directed against other regions of H4L did not alter total RNA synthesis. These results are in agreement with that obtained by Deng and Shuman (11Deng L. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14323-14329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), showing that antibodies raised against the NH2-terminal region of H4L inhibited viral RNA synthesis, further limiting the essential region to the first 256 amino acids. However, one important difference can be observed. Although αH4L1–256 inhibits RNA synthesis in both wild type virus and C50 mutant virus-infected cell extracts, in the C50 extract, termination is inhibited as well (Fig. 2, Band C). To further evaluate the affect of αH4L1–256 on transcription termination, it was necessary to separate transcription initiation from elongation and termination. To do this, a bead-bound template was employed in the following studies. The prototype G21(TER29)A78 transcription unit (26Deng L. Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16562-19556Google Scholar) consists of a synthetic early promoter fused to a 20-nucleotide G-less cassette, which is flanked by a run of three G residues at positions +21 to +23. A 57-nucleotide A-less cassette was inserted downstream of the G-less cassette and flanked at its 3′ end by a run of four A residues at positions +78 to +81. A termination signal, TTTTTTTTT, was placed within the A-less cassette, spanning positions +29 to +37 (Fig.3 A). Synthesis of a transcript that extends from the initiation site to the end of the G-less cassette would yield a product of 21 bases in length (G21). Elongation of the transcript beyond the G21 position, in the presence of all 4 NTPs, would yield a transcript of about 177 bases in length. Signal-dependent termination would be expected to produce a family of RNA products about 70 bases long. RNA synthesis was initiated in a C50 mutant virus-infected cell extract, lacking NPH I. The template-engaged 32P-labeled (bead-bound) G21 RNA product was then separated and washed, and transcription termination was measured after a second incubation in all four NTPs, in the presence or absence of VTF and NPH I. In the absence of any added factor, synthesis of a major read-through product was seen. Minor and variable amounts of premature release products can also be seen. Addition of VTF alone did not stimulate termination. However, addition of both VTF and NPH I enhanced the level of termination to about 56% (Fig.3 B). In order to evaluate the role of H4L in early gene transcription termination, the effect of the purified antibodies, αH4L1–256 and αH4L568–795, on transcription termination was assessed using the bead-bound template. The template-engaged 32P-labeled G21 RNA product was synthesized employing a C50 mutant virus-infected cell extract, lacking NPH I. The ternary complex containing the 32P-labeled G21 product was washed and preincubated for 30 min on ice in the presence or absence of increasing amounts of IgG antibodies, directed against either H4L 1–256 or H4L 568–795. The ability of the antibody-treated ternary complexes to terminate transcription was then evaluated by an additional incubation in all four NTPs, in the presence or absence of VTF and NPH I. In the absence of any added factor, synthesis of the major read-through product and the minor pause products was seen (Fig.4, lane 1). Addition of VTF alone did not stimulate termination; however, addition of both VTF and NPH I enhanced the level of termination to about 43% (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 3, respectively). Preincubation of the G21 ternary complex with the IgG antibodies directed against the NH2-terminal region of H4L (1) inhibited transcription termination in a concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 4, lanes 4–6). Antibodies directed against the COOH-terminal region of H4L had no effect on transcription termination (Fig. 4,lane 7). These results indicate the requirement for the NH2-terminal region of H4L for early gene transcription termination. In order to evaluate the specificity of the antibody inhibition of termination, antibodies were preincubated with a H4L fragment, containing amino acids 1–256, that was originally used to raise the antibodies. The template-engaged 32P-labeled G21 RNA product was synthesized employing the C50 mutant virus-infected cell extract, lacking NPH I. The G21 ternary complexes were then incubated for 30 min on ice in the presence or absence of 250 ng of IgG antibodies, which either were or were not preincubated with H4L fragment 1–256. The preincubated G21 ternary complexes were then elongated in the presence of all four NTPs, in the presence or absence of VTF and NPH I. In the absence of any added factor, synthesis of only the major read-through product was seen (Fig.5 A, lane 1). Addition of VTF alone did not stimulate termination; however, addition of both VTF and NPH I enhanced the level of termination to about 41% (Fig. 5 A, lanes 2 and 3, respectively). Preincubation of the G21 ternary complex with αH4L1–256 inhibited transcription termination (Fig. 5 A, lane 4). Preincubation of αH4L1–256 with H4L 1–256 prevented the antibody inhibition of transcription termination (Fig. 5 A,lanes 5–8). Recently, the interaction between the H4L subunit of the virion RNA polymerase and NPH I, a single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase, was shown to be required for early gene transcription termination and transcript release (22Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25798-25804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This interaction was mapped to the NH2-terminal 195 amino acids of H4L. The ability of the H4L 1–195 to prevent the antibody inhibition of transcription termination was tested. Preincubation αH4L1–256 with H4L 1–195 also prevented the antibody inhibition of transcription termination (Fig. 5 B, lanes 5–8). These results demonstrate that the inhibition of termination requires antibody binding to one or more epitopes in the NH2-terminal end of H4L between amino acids 1 and 195. Furthermore, these results also confirm that the NH2-terminal region of H4L, containing amino acids 1–195, is required for transcription termination. The template-engaged 32P-labeled G21 RNA product was synthesized employing a wild type virus-infected cell extract. The G21 ternary complexes were then incubated for 30 min on ice, in the presence or absence of 250 ng of αH4L1–256. Preincubation with the αH4L568–795, directed against the COOH-terminal region of H4L, was used as a negative control. The preincubated G21 ternary complexes were then elongated with all four NTPs, in the presence or absence of VTF and NPH I. In the absence of any added factor, synthesis of the major read-through product was seen (Fig. 6, lane 1). Addition of VTF enhanced the level of termination to about 61% (Fig.6, lane 2). Addition of extra NPH I to the isolated ternary complexes had little effect on the level of transcription termination observed (Fig. 6, lane 3). In contrast to the C50 mutant virus-infected cell extract, preincubation of the G21 ternary complexes synthesized in wild type virus-infected cell extract with αH4L1–256exhibited minor inhibition of transcription termination (Fig. 6,lane 4), which was prevented by addition of NPH I to the ternary complexes (Fig. 6, lane 5). Preincubation with αH4L568–795 had no effect on termination (Fig. 6, lane 6). These results indicate that the presence of NPH I in the ternary complex prevents antibody inhibition of transcription termination. Prior work from this laboratory showed that NPH I is not an integral component of the ternary complex, but rather that a reversible interaction between NPH I and the ternary complex occurs (22Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25798-25804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Addition of NPH I to ternary complexes synthesized in wild type-infected cell extract had little effect on termination (Fig. 6, lane 3), but NPH I addition prior to the antibody exhibited an additional protection from antibody inhibition of transcription termination (Fig. 6,lane 5). These data indicate that both NPH I and αH4L1–256 compete for the same site(s) on H4L. If NPH I and αH4L1–256 compete for the same site(s) on H4L, addition of NPH I to a C50 mutant virus-infected cell extract should prevent antibody inhibition of transcription termination. To test this hypothesis, the template-engaged32P-labeled G21 RNA product was synthesized in a C50 mutant virus-infected cell extract preincubated with NPH I (C50 extract/NPH I). The G21 ternary complexes were isolated and then incubated in the presence or absence of additional NPH I, prior to the antibody addition. Subsequently, the ternary complexes were incubated in the presence or absence of the αH4L1–256. Preincubation of the G21 ternary complexes with the αH4L568–795 was used as a negative control (Fig. 7,lane 6). The preincubated G21 ternary complexes were then elongated with all four NTPs, with or without added VTF and NPH I. In the absence of any added factor, synthesis of the major read-through product was seen (Fig. 7, lane 1). Addition of VTF enhanced the level of termination to about 75% (Fig.7, lane 2). Addition of extra NPH I to the ternary complexes did not enhance the level of transcription termination any further (Fig. 7, lane 3). Incubation of the G21 ternary complexes, prepared in a C50 mutant virus-infected cell extract complemented with added NPH I, with αH4L1–256 exhibited reduced inhibition of transcription termination (Fig. 7, lane 4). Moreover, preincubation of the isolated ternary complexes with additional NPH I, prior to the antibody addition, further prevented the antibody inhibition of transcription termination (Fig. 7, lane 5). These results support the hypothesis that NPH I binds to the site(s) on H4L containing the epitopes that bind to the inhibitory antibodies. The template-engaged32P-labeled G21 RNA product was synthesized employing a C50 mutant virus-infected cell extract, lacking NPH I. The isolated G21 ternary complexes were incubated in the presence or absence of NPH I. The preincubated G21 ternary complexes were then incubated in the presence or absence of αH4L1–256. The preincubated G21 ternary complexes were then elongated with all four NTPs, with or without added VTF and NPH I. Preincubation of the G21 ternary complexes with αH4L568–795 was used as a negative control (Fig.8, lane 6). In the absence of any added factor, synthesis of the major read-through product was seen (Fig. 8, lane 1). Addition of VTF alone did not stimulate termination; however, addition of both VTF and NPH I enhanced the level of termination to about 46% (Fig. 8,lanes 2 and 3, respectively). Incubation of the G21 ternary complexes without added NPH I, with αH4L1–256 inhibited transcription termination (Fig. 8,lane 4). However, preincubation of the isolated ternary complexes with NPH I, prior to the antibody addition, prevented the antibody inhibition of transcription termination (Fig. 8,lane 5). These results demonstrate that NPH I can block the antibody access to the NH2-terminal region of H4L. Signal-dependent transcription termination is restricted to early poxvirus genes (29Wittek R. Cooper J.A. Barbosa E. Moss B. Cell. 1980; 21: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), whose transcription is catalyzed by the virion form of RNA polymerase (10Ahn B.Y. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3536-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Effective termination of early gene transcription requires the productive interplay of at least four factors: the virion RNA polymerase (21Condit R.C. Lewis J.I. Quinn M. Christen L.M. Niles E.G.

It is clear that only the form of RNA polymerase that recognizes an early promoter is sensitive to signal-dependent termination (21Condit R.C. Lewis J.I. Quinn M. Christen L.M. Niles E.G. Virology. 1996; 218: 169-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The H4L protein, RAP94, is an integral RNA polymerase subunit found only in the virion form of RNA polymerase that recognizes and initiates at early gene promoters (10Ahn B.Y. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3536-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 11Deng L. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14323-14329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kane E. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5752-5762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prior work from this laboratory demonstrated a physical interaction between the COOH-terminal end of NPH I and the NH2-terminal end of the H4L subunit of the virion RNA polymerase (22Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25798-25804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This observation correlated with NPH I mutants that failed both to bind to H4L (22Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25798-25804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and to support transcription termination (20Christen L.M. Sanders M. Wiler C. Niles E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 360-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and transcript release (22Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25798-25804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), indicating that the interaction between NPH I and H4L may be required for these processes. The essential interaction of NPH I and H4L provided an explanation for the observed restriction of UUUUUNU-dependent transcription termination to early genes, where only the H4L-containing RNA polymerase would be able to terminate. This interaction also defined H4L as a termination cofactor, recruiting NPH I to the ternary complex. However, this observation conflicted with a prior report (32Deng L. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29386-29392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) indicating that H4L was not required for NPH I mediated transcription termination in vitro. Therefore, further experiments were needed to resolve this discrepancy and to evaluate the requirement of H4L for early gene transcription termination. Antibodies directed against H4L were tested for their ability to inhibit transcription termination in vitro. Preincubation of a ternary complex prepared in the absence of NPH I with the antibodies directed against the NH2-terminal region of H4L (1) specifically inhibited transcription termination. Inhibition was blocked by preincubation of αH4L1–256 antibodies with H4L 1–195, demonstrating that the inhibition was mediated by antibody binding to one or more epitopes in the NH2-terminal end of H4L. These data demonstrate that the NH2-terminal domain of H4L is required for early gene transcription termination. Prior results from this laboratory mapped the site of interaction between NPH I and H4L to the NH2-terminal 195 amino acids of H4L (22Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25798-25804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether NPH I and αH4L1–256 compete for the same site(s) on H4L. Preincubation of the G21 ternary complexes synthesized in a wild type-infected cell extract with αH4L1–256 exhibited reduced inhibition of transcription termination. Furthermore, preincubation of a NPH I minus virus-infected cell extract with NPH I prior to antibody addition, or readdition of NPH I to isolated ternary complexes prepared in the absence of NPH I, prevented antibody inhibition of transcription termination, indicating that NPH I binds to the site on H4L containing the epitopes that bind to the inhibitory antibodies. One can propose three models to explain the mechanism of antibody inhibition of NPH I binding to H4L. In the simplest and least likely model, the antibody binding site and the NPH I interaction site are the same. Binding is mutually exclusive. In other models, NPH I and the antibody bind to different sites on H4L. In one case, binding of either antibody or NPH I blocks binding of the other protein. Alternatively, binding of one protein to H4L could change the conformation of H4L, weakening the binding of the other protein. In the absence of additional data, direct competition is the favored model. These results demonstrate that inhibition of termination requires antibody binding to one or more epitopes in the NH2-terminal end of H4L between amino acids 1 and 195. These data also confirm the prior conclusion (22Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25798-25804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that the NH2-terminal region of H4L, containing amino acids 1–195, is required for transcription termination. The finding that the NH2-terminal domain of H4L, an integral RNA polymerase subunit found only in the virion form of RNA polymerase that recognizes and initiates at early gene promoters (10Ahn B.Y. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3536-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 11Deng L. Shuman S. J. Biol.

Virol. 1992; 66: 5752-5762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is required for termination provides an explanation for the known restriction of transcription termination to early genes (29Wittek R. Cooper J.A. Barbosa E. Moss B. Cell. 1980; 21: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It is known that NPH I must bind single-stranded DNA to reveal a cryptic ATPase activity (33Paoletti E. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3281-3286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Paoletti E. Rosemond-Hornbeak H. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3273-3280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that ATP hydrolysis is required for termination (19Deng L. Shuman S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20Christen L.M. Sanders M. Wiler C. Niles E.G.

Therefore, in the termination complex, NPH I must have access to single-stranded DNA. Since much of the template strand is annealed to nascent RNA in the transcription bubble, the most likely source for single-stranded DNA is the free non-template strand in the paused ternary complex. Therefore, the role of H4L in early gene transcription termination could be simply a docking site for NPH I, which would permit NPH I association with the ternary complex, and provide access to the non-template strand when termination occurs. Alternatively, H4L may play an active role in termination yet to be described, in addition to its role in recruiting NPH I. Further genetic and biochemical studies are under way to evaluate the exact role of H4L in termination."

Because its mechanism of action may involve translocation of the RNA transcript through the hole in its ring structure, its action could depend on the availability of a free 5′ terminus. To determine whether Rho's activity is 5′-end-dependent, its ability to bind to and function on a circular derivative of λ cro mRNA was investigated. The circular derivative was made in vitro by action of RNA ligase on a derivative of λ cro RNA containing an extra 10-nucleotide sequence near the 5′-end that was complementary to a sequence located near the 3′-end. Rho bound nearly as tightly to the circular derivative RNA as to the standardcro transcript. Rho was also able to readily dissociate a DNA oligonucleotide from its helical complex with the circular RNA in an ATP-dependent reaction. Thus, the action of Rho on a transcript does not depend on the availability of a free 5′ terminus.

Thus, the action of Rho on a transcript does not depend on the availability of a free 5′ terminus. Transcription termination factor Rho is an RNA-binding protein that couples the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to actions that dissociate a RNA transcript from its biosynthetic complex with DNA and RNA polymerase (1Roberts J.W.

Rho also can dissociate a RNA molecule bound to DNA through a short hybrid helix in a reaction that is dependent on ATP hydrolysis and the presence of an attachment site for Rho on the RNA on the 5′ side of the hybrid helix (3Brennan C.A.

This RNA-DNA helicase activity may mimic the process of removal of the nascent RNA strand from the transcription elongation complex.Rho factor is believed to function in vivo as a hexamer consisting of six polypeptide subunits arranged in a ring-shaped structure (6Oda T. Takanami M. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 71: 799-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 7Gogol E.P. Seifried S.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 4182-4189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) have recently presented a model for the Rho-RNA complex in which a segment of RNA, called arut site (Rho utilization site), binds to a cleft comprised of the N-terminal RNA-binding domains of the six individual subunits located at one end of the hexameric structure (the crown) (9Miwa Y. Horiguchi T. Shigesada K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 815-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 10Richardson J.P. J. Biol.

RNA sequence 3′ of the rut site then passes into the hole located at the center of the hexamer. Evidence for passage of a single-stranded nucleic acid substrate through a ring-shaped hexameric structure has been observed for other hexameric helicases, such as DnaB and the T7 gene 4 product (12Bujalowski W. Jezewska M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8513-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 13Egelman E.H., Yu, X. Wild R. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar).The process by which Rho binds to and captures the 3′-end of an RNA in the center of the hexamer is not known. Gan and Richardson (14Gan E. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16882-16888Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) have recently presented data indicating that Rho, in vitro, could form hexamers by partial assembly of subunits on an RNA. Another mechanism could have the RNA enter into the center of the hexameric structure through an opening or notch in the ring (7Gogol E.P. Seifried S.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1127-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). A third mechanism may involve Rho threading onto the nascent transcript from the free 5′-end of the RNA.To test the model in which Rho requires a free end of RNA to thread onto in order to function as a terminator, we investigated Rho's ability to utilize its ATP-dependent helicase activity on an RNA lacking a free end. This can be done by using a circular RNA to test Rho's ability to disrupt RNA-DNA hybrid helices. These results indicate that Rho is indeed able to function as a helicase on an RNA lacking a free end.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo determine whether Rho could bind to and act on a transcript lacking a free 5′-end, a circular derivative of λ cro RNA, a transcript that is terminated at the well characterized Rho-dependent terminator tR1 located between genescro and cII of bacteriophage λ, was prepared. The method chosen to make a circular RNA (16Beaudry D. Perreault J.-P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3064-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) involved preparing a 391-nucleotide derivative of the λ cro RNA, which contained an inserted sequence of 10 nucleotides (between nucleotides 4 and 5 in the wild-type cro RNA sequence) that was complementary to a 10-nucleotide sequence near the 3′-end of the RNA (nucleotides 366–375). With this extra sequence, the RNA can form a stable stem helix, which would bring the 5′- and 3′-ends into close proximity. After converting the 5′-triphosphate of the primary transcript to a monophosphate, treatment of this RNA with T4 RNA ligase converted ∼30% of the RNA to a circular form. The ligated, circular RNA was separated from the unligated RNA because of its slower mobility during electrophoresis on a 7 m urea polyacrylamide gel.Rho Binds to Circular RNATo determine whether Rho can bind the circular λ cro derivative RNA, we used the nitrocellulose filter-binding technique to isolate complexes of Rho with radiolabeled RNA (15Faus I. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3510-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18Carey J. Cameron V. de Haseth P.L. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2601-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). With saturating levels of Rho, ∼60% of the circular cro RNA was retained on the filter. This efficiency of retention of the complex was nearly identical to that found with the standard cro RNA under the same binding conditions (14Gan E. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16882-16888Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The affinity of Rho for the RNAs was determined by measuring the fraction of RNA retained on the filter at varying concentrations of Rho and finding the best fit of these data to the equation for formation of a simple bimolecular complex between the RNA and hexameric Rho. As was shown for the standard cro RNA, the assumption that Rho bound RNA as a hexamer is a good approximation when ATP was present in the binding mixture (14Gan E. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16882-16888Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). TheKd values determined by this procedure were: 0.03 ± 0.01, 0.07 ± 0.01, and 0.14 ± 0.03 nm for the complex with the standard cro RNA, the ligated (circular) cro derivative RNA, and unligatedcro derivative RNA, respectively. Thus, Rho does not bind as tightly to the derivative cro RNAs as to the standardcro RNA, but it does bind with slightly higher affinity to the circular RNA than to its unligated precursor.One possible reason why Rho binds with a somewhat weaker affinity to the derivative RNAs than to the standard cro RNA is that the formation of the stem-helix between the 3′- and 5′-ends in the derivative RNAs has changed their overall tertiary structure. These structural changes may have made the binding site on the derivative RNAs less accessible to Rho than on the standard cro RNA. In any case, these data indicate that Rho can bind to the circular RNA nearly as well as it binds to the standard cro RNA.Rho Exhibits ATP-dependent RNA-DNA Helicase Activity on a Circular RNA SubstrateRho can utilize the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to translocate along a RNA in a 3′ direction and to disrupt RNA-DNA hybrids that are 3′ of the primary Rho attachment site (3Brennan C.A. Dombroski A.J. Platt T. Cell. 1987; 48: 945-952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 4Walstrom K.M. Dozono J.M. Robic S. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7980-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To determine if Rho can perform this ATP-driven reaction on a circular RNA, a DNA oligonucleotide complementary to a sequence on the 3′ side of the rut site (Fig.1, 3′ oligo) was annealed to the RNA. When separated on a polyacrylamide gel containing SDS (no urea), the circular RNA-DNA oligonucleotide complex migrated more slowly than did the free RNA (Fig.2). Incubation of the complex with a stoichiometric amount of Rho and ATP caused a time-dependent displacement of 3′ oligonucleotide from the circular RNA. 86% of the oligonucleotide was displaced within 6 min. In the absence of either Rho or ATP, less than 7% of 3′ oligonucleotide was displaced within 6 min. These results demonstrate that Rho acts as a helicase on a circular RNA.To rule out the possibility that the displacement occurred because there was sufficient contaminating nuclease present to nick a majority of the circular RNA, samples of the reaction mixture were also analyzed on a polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. The results revealed that ≥95% of the circular RNA retained its characteristic slower mobility on the 7 m urea polyacrylamide gel. Hence, nearly all of the circular RNA remained covalently sealed throughout the course of the helicase reaction.Kinetics of the RNA-DNA Helicase ReactionTo determine whether the absence of a free end alters the rapidity by which Rho can separate RNA from a hybrid complex with a DNA oligonucleotide, the time courses for the displacement reaction for the various RNAs was determined. With the standard cro RNA, the displacement reaction had two phases. About half of the complexes were dissociated rapidly, while the rest were dissociated at a much slower rate (Fig.3). With the two croderivatives, the initial displacement was less rapid but involved a larger fraction of the complexes. The two-phase reaction observed for these RNAs was very similar to results obtained by Walstrom et al. (5Walstrom K.M. Dozono J.M. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7004-7993Google Scholar) performing similar experiments using DNA oligonucleotides complexed with trpt′ RNA as the substrate in their helicase reaction. These reactions can be described in terms of a two-phase rate expression composed of a rapid, first-order burst phase followed by a slower linear phase (see Equation 1). The curves in Fig. 3 represent the fit of the data to the equation. The corresponding rate parameters are presented in Table I. For the hybrid complex with the standard cro RNA, about 38% of the hybrid complexes were disrupted in the initial burst phase, with a first-order rate constant (k1) of 0.28 s−1. The remaining complexes were dissociated with a steady-state rate constant (k2) of 8 × 10−4 s−1. In contrast, for both of the cro derivatives, about 80% of the complexes were dissociated in the burst phase; however, the rates (∼0.03 s−1) were about 10-fold slower than the rate determined for the standard cro RNA. The small fraction of complexes remaining for both of the derivative cro RNAs were dissociated with a k2 of <5 × 10−4 s−1. These results indicate that the RNA-DNA hybrid complexes with the derivativecro RNAs were poorer substrates for helix displacement by Rho in the initial burst phase reaction than the complexes with the standard cro RNA.Figure 3Kinetics of displacement of the 3′ oligonucleotide from the various cro RNA transcripts by Rho's helicase activity. Reactions contained 4.5 nm hybrid helix and 5 nm Rho hexamer and were initiated by the addition of 1 mm ATP at 37 °C. Aliquots of the reaction were taken at 15, 45, 90, 180, and 360 s and were immediately mixed with a buffer containing 0.1% SDS, which quenched the reaction by denaturation of Rho. All samples were separated by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel with 0.1% SDS at 4 °C.Open squares, standard cro RNA;open circles, unligated cro derivative RNA; closed circles, circular croderivative RNA.

Open table in a new tab One possible explanation for differing rates of the initial burst phase between the standard cro RNA and the derivative RNAs is that formation of the stem structure between the 3′- and 5′-ends in the derivative RNAs, ligated or not, makes the RNA less accessible to Rho for immediate action. Another possibility is that the overall changes in the tertiary imposed on the two derivative RNAs due to the formation of the stem structure alters Rho's ability to efficiently displace downstream hybrid complexes. The second explanation may be more likely, since the RNA-DNA complexes were preincubated with Rho for two min at 37 °C prior to the addition of ATP, allowing Rho ample time to bind to the complexes. Whatever the reason, the ligation of the 3′- and 5′-ends did not make the circular derivative any less reactive than its unligated counterpart.Investigation of Rho's Tracking along an RNA MoleculeThe helicase action of Rho has been shown to be directional. Rho will disrupt RNA-DNA hybrids located 3′ of the rut site but not hybrids located at the 5′-end of the transcript (3Brennan C.A. Dombroski A.J. Platt T. Cell. 1987; 48: 945-952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 4Walstrom K.M. Dozono J.M. Robic S. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7980-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Another way to demonstrate Rho's ability to act on a circular RNA is to show that it can disrupt a hybrid with a DNA oligonucleotide (called 5′ oligonucleotide) that is complementary to a segment of RNA near the 5′-end of the original transcript that was used to make the circular derivative (Fig. 1). After a 6-min incubation of the hybrid complex with ATP and a stoichiometric amount of Rho, 44% of the 5′ oligonucleotide was removed from the circular RNA as compared with 71% of the 3′ oligonucleotide from its complex (TableII). In contrast with the unligated cro RNA, only 12% of the 5′ oligonucleotide was displaced, whereas again 71% of the 3′ oligonucleotide was displaced. On the ligated, circular croRNA, the 5′ oligonucleotide was located further downstream (54 nucleotides) from the rut site than the 3′ oligonucleotide was in its complex. In addition, the 5′ oligonucleotide hybrid was downstream of the stem structure that brought the 3′- and 5′-ends together for ligation. Both of these conditions are likely reasons why the 5′ oligonucleotide was removed less efficiently than the 3′ oligonucleotide from the circular cro RNA. On the other hand, the much lower displacement of the 5′ oligonucleotide from the unligated derivative RNA containing the same stem structure demonstrates a dependence on the covalent continuity of the RNA across this segment of RNA for the improved efficiency of displacement. This is thus further evidence that Rho can function on a circular RNA.Table IICharacterization of Rho's helicase activity using DNA oligonucleotides annealed to different locations on the various λ cro RNA transcriptscroRNAOligonucleotideFraction hybridΔt = 0 mint = 6 min%Standard5′0.86 ± 0.030.60 ± 0.02303′0.81 ± 0.040.31 ± 0.0462rut0.91 ± 0.050.89 ± 0.042Unligated derivative5′0.80 ± 0.020.70 ± 0.05123′0.83 ± 0.070.77 ± 0.037rut0.60 ± 0.010.18 ± 0.0671Circular derivative5′0.77 ± 0.020.43 ± 0.05443′0.63 ± 0.110.19 ± 0.0171rut0.80 ± 0.030.79 ± 0.011All reactions were performed using 4.5 nm RNA-DNA hybrid and 5 nm Rho hexamer at 37 °C. All reactions were initiated by the addition of 1 mm ATP to mixtures preincubated with both the RNA-DNA hybrid and Rho. Less than 2% of the hybrid complexes listed were displaced upon incubation of that complex in the presence of either Rho or ATP individually. Open table in a new tab This result with the unligated cro derivative is also consistent with other observations that Rho will not displace a hybrid that is on the 5′ side of the rut sequence. This latter observation is important because of the unexpected finding that Rho was able to displace as much as 30% of the 5′ oligonucleotide within 6 min (Table II) from a complex with this oligonucleotide hybridized to the standard cro RNA. The reason for this partial but significant level of displacement is unknown. However, the displacement was dependent on the presence of both Rho and ATP, since less than 2% of this hybrid was displaced from the standardcro RNA or either of the cro derivatives when incubated with either ATP or Rho alone for 6 min (data not shown). In all of the previous cases in which there was little or no displacement of an upstream DNA hybrid, the 5′-end of the RNA transcript was in a double helical structure. In experiments with trpt′ RNA (3Brennan C.A. Dombroski A.J. Platt T. Cell. 1987; 48: 945-952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar,4Walstrom K.M. Dozono J.M. Robic S. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7980-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the upstream hybrid was at the 5′-end and in our experiment with the unligated cro derivative RNA, the 5′-end was in a helical stem with the 3′-end of the transcript. In contrast to those RNAs, the standard cro RNA had a 5′ RNA segment of 28 nucleotides that could provide Rho access to an upstream hybrid from the 5′ side. Because the amount of Rho was stoichiometric with the amount of RNA under the conditions used, most, if not all, of the Rho molecules would be bound to the rut segment of thecro RNA (19Faus I. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this case, an interaction of the 5′-end of an RNA with the hybrid dissociation site in Rho could occur by looping of the same RNA into the site or by action on a second, separate RNA molecule.To investigate the importance of the rut site to Rho action, the rut oligonucleotide was used to block the beginning of the rut site for all three RNAs. Faus and Richardson (15Faus I. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3510-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) showed that blocking this portion of the rut site with an oligonucleotide inhibited Rho's ability to bind to cro RNA. Also, Chen et al. (20Chen C.A. Galluppi G.R. Richardson J.P. Cell. 1986; 46: 1023-1028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) showed that blocking therut site with a similar DNA oligonucleotide inhibited Rho'sin vitro termination activity at the tR1 terminator of the λ cro gene. As expected from these prior observations, Rho displaced less than 7% of the rut oligonucleotide from the complexes with any of the three cro RNAs (Table II). These results also provide further evidence that the helicase activity is a faithful representation of Rho's action in transcription termination.Implications for Rho's Function in VivoAccording to a recent model of Rho-RNA interaction presented by Burgess and Richardson (8Burgess B.R. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4182-4189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), Rho is believed to initially bind to a loading site located on the RNA transcript through interactions in a cleft located around the crown of the hexameric structure, composed of the N-terminal RNA-binding domains of the individual subunits of Rho. Following this primary RNA binding event, RNA is then passed into the center of the ring. The mechanism for this transit is unknown. From these results, a mechanism that requires Rho to thread onto a free 5′-end of the RNA for function is unlikely. Other possible mechanisms include either passage of the RNA through an opening of a notched form of the hexamer (as seen in electron micrographic images of Rho) (6Oda T. Takanami M. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 71: 799-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 7Gogol E.P. Seifried S.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1127-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) or through an opening caused by partial disassembly of the hexamer on the RNA (14Gan E. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16882-16888Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).In its normal context at the end of an operon, a Rho-dependent terminator would encode a rutsegment that would be located downstream of the translated segment of the RNA. In order for Rho to load onto this RNA, it must be able to bind an RNA from which the 5′-end would be blocked by co-translating ribosomes and the 3′-end would be blocked by the RNA polymerase. Thus, Rho would have to bind by a mechanism that is not dependent on the availability of a free end. A similar constraint would apply to the loading of Rho onto an RNA segment downstream of a ribosome stalled on a nascent RNA during amino acid starvation, as happens for the functioning of latent intragenic terminators under starvation conditions (21Richardson J.P. Cell. 1991; 64: 1047-1049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus, these results with the circular RNA are consistent with the expected mechanism of Rho action in the cell. Transcription termination factor Rho is an RNA-binding protein that couples the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to actions that dissociate a RNA transcript from its biosynthetic complex with DNA and RNA polymerase (1Roberts J.W. Nature. 1969; 224: 1168-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 2Richardson J.P. Greenblatt J.L. Neidhardt F.C. Curtis III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 848-882Google Scholar). Rho also can dissociate a RNA molecule bound to DNA through a short hybrid helix in a reaction that is dependent on ATP hydrolysis and the presence of an attachment site for Rho on the RNA on the 5′ side of the hybrid helix (3Brennan C.A. Dombroski A.J. Platt T. Cell. 1987; 48: 945-952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 4Walstrom K.M. Dozono J.M. Robic S. von Hippel P.H.

This RNA-DNA helicase activity may mimic the process of removal of the nascent RNA strand from the transcription elongation complex. Rho factor is believed to function in vivo as a hexamer consisting of six polypeptide subunits arranged in a ring-shaped structure (6Oda T. Takanami M. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 71: 799-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 7Gogol E.P. Seifried S.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1127-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Burgess and Richardson (8Burgess B.R. Richardson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4182-4189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) have recently presented a model for the Rho-RNA complex in which a segment of RNA, called arut site (Rho utilization site), binds to a cleft comprised of the N-terminal RNA-binding domains of the six individual subunits located at one end of the hexameric structure (the crown) (9Miwa Y. Horiguchi T. Shigesada K. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 815-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 10Richardson J.P. J. Biol.

RNA sequence 3′ of the rut site then passes into the hole located at the center of the hexamer. Evidence for passage of a single-stranded nucleic acid substrate through a ring-shaped hexameric structure has been observed for other hexameric helicases, such as DnaB and the T7 gene 4 product (12Bujalowski W. Jezewska M.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8513-8519Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 13Egelman E.H., Yu, X. Wild R. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3869-3873Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The process by which Rho binds to and captures the 3′-end of an RNA in the center of the hexamer is not known. Gan and Richardson (14Gan E. Richardson J.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16882-16888Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) have recently presented data indicating that Rho, in vitro, could form hexamers by partial assembly of subunits on an RNA. Another mechanism could have the RNA enter into the center of the hexameric structure through an opening or notch in the ring (7Gogol E.P. Seifried S.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 1127-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). A third mechanism may involve Rho threading onto the nascent transcript from the free 5′-end of the RNA. To test the model in which Rho requires a free end of RNA to thread onto in order to function as a terminator, we investigated Rho's ability to utilize its ATP-dependent helicase activity on an RNA lacking a free end. This can be done by using a circular RNA to test Rho's ability to disrupt RNA-DNA hybrid helices. These results indicate that Rho is indeed able to function as a helicase on an RNA lacking a free end. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo determine whether Rho could bind to and act on a transcript lacking a free 5′-end, a circular derivative of λ cro RNA, a transcript that is terminated at the well characterized Rho-dependent terminator tR1 located between genescro and cII of bacteriophage λ, was prepared. The method chosen to make a circular RNA (16Beaudry D. Perreault J.-P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3064-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) involved preparing a 391-nucleotide derivative of the λ cro RNA, which contained an inserted sequence of 10 nucleotides (between nucleotides 4 and 5 in the wild-type cro RNA sequence) that was complementary to a 10-nucleotide sequence near the 3′-end of the RNA (nucleotides 366–375). With this extra sequence, the RNA can form a stable stem helix, which would bring the 5′- and 3′-ends into close proximity. After converting the 5′-triphosphate of the primary transcript to a monophosphate, treatment of this RNA with T4 RNA ligase converted ∼30% of the RNA to a circular form. The ligated, circular RNA was separated from the unligated RNA because of its slower mobility during electrophoresis on a 7 m urea polyacrylamide gel.Rho Binds to Circular RNATo determine whether Rho can bind the circular λ cro derivative RNA, we used the nitrocellulose filter-binding technique to isolate complexes of Rho with radiolabele"

Soluble NSF attachment protein-α (αSNAP) mediates the disruption of SNAREs by N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (NSF) and was employed to determine the hierarchy of proteins responsible for intra-Golgi protein transport. The N-terminal 23 amino acids of αSNAP are necessary for SNARE binding. The antibody 2F10 recognizes this SNARE interaction domain of αSNAP and inhibits intra-Golgi protein transport reversibly. This antibody was applied to modify the transport assay to determine the protein requirements relative to the action of αSNAP and NSF. We found that 1) p115 acts independently of αSNAP and NSF, 2) SNAREs are required after tethering and interact selectively after activation by αSNAP and NSF, and 3) Rab proteins act after SNARE activation and before fusion.

Science. 1975; 189: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar). To maintain the functional and morphological integrity of the cell, protein and lipid transport has to follow a selective and precise mechanism. After entry of cargo into the budding vesicle, it pinches off and is destined for the target membrane. Short range movement of vesicles is mediated by diffusion, whereas motor proteins move vesicles over a long distance on cytoskeletal tracks. Finally, vesicles dock to and fuse with the target membrane, resulting in the delivery of the cargo. Vesicular transport is a cyclic process accounting for the vectorial flux of cargo while maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the individual compartments (for reviews see Refs. 2Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 3Lane J. Allan V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 27-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 4Jahn R.

Docking is the morphologically defined event of the association of a vesicle with a target membrane. Tethering is the biochemical equivalent and involves the formation of a stable interaction of a vesicle with a membrane. Priming refers to the activation of the membrane surfaces to obtain fusion competence (6Robinson L.J. Martin T.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The SNARE1 hypothesis (7Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2609) Google Scholar) provides an explanation for specificity in vesicular transport; during targeting, the membrane-bound v-SNARE protein of a vesicle interacts with the corresponding t-SNARE of the target membrane forming a SNARE complex. SNAREs were initially identified in the neuronal system (7Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2609) Google Scholar), and subsequently homologous proteins involved in other transport steps in the mammalian cell and in yeast were identified. SNAREs of the synapse and of the yeast vacuole are involved in docking and fusion of proteoliposomes and vacuolar membranes, respectively (8Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M.

Members of the SNAP family of proteins, consisting of the ubiquitously expressed α- and γSNAP and the neuronal βSNAP, bind to SNAREs (11Clary D.O. Griff I.C. Rothman J.E.

Nature. 1993; 362: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the ATPase NSF binds to SNAREs via the SNAPs (13Weidman P.J. Melancon P. Block M.R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1589-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and ATP hydrolysis results in the disruption of SNARE complexes (7Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M.

Another family of proteins involved in vesicular transport is the Rab family of GTP-binding proteins (14Salminen A. Novick P.J. Cell. 1987; 49: 527-538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). They cycle between a GTP- and a GDP-bound form, and both forms can be membrane-associated (15Pfeffer S.R. Soldati T.

The EcoRI site in the open reading frame was removed without affecting the translated amino acids. This fragment was ligated into pGEX4T-1. The p115 head domain was expressed as a fusion protein with GST and was purified by thrombin cleavage according to the manufacturer's instruction.

This dissociation is a key event in vesicular protein transport; therefore, we chose αSNAP as a target to examine its role and, in conclusion, that of NSF and SNAREs in protein targeting. To determine the domain structure of αSNAP we carried out limited proteolysis with subtilisin, a protease of low sequence specificity. Protein domains of compact and rigid conformation are more resistant to proteolytic degradation by subtilisin, whereas flexible parts of a protein become preferentially hydrolyzed (55Pavletich N.P. Chambers K.A. Pabo C.O. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2556-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). To identify core domains of αSNAP we incubated His6-αSNAP with increasing amounts of subtilisin. The proteolytic fragments were separated by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 1 Ashows a typical result of limited proteolysis of αSNAP. After transfer to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, partial N-terminal amino acid sequencing was performed on the four proteolytic intermediates indicated in Fig. 1 A. The largest of the four intermediates starts at position 32 with the smaller fragments beginning at positions 93, 140, and 157 of αSNAP, respectively (Fig.1 B). A comparison of the apparent molecular weight of the proteolytic fragments with the calculated molecular weight suggests that the C terminus was not subject to proteolytic degradation (data not shown). The hydrophilic amino acid serine found in positions 24 and 35 flanks the site of the first proteolytic cut at position 32. Truncated GSTαSNAP fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli that lacked either the first 23 or 31 amino acids of αSNAP. In addition, amino acids 1–156 of αSNAP were fused to GST and expressed in E. coli. The deletion mutants of αSNAP were examined for their ability to bind to neuronal SNARE complexes. SNARE complexes were prepared from bovine brain membranes by lysis with Triton X-100. αSNAP and its truncation mutants were incubated with the membrane extract and purified with glutathione-agarose beads. Neuronal SNAREs were detected by SDS-PAGE and transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane followed by Western analysis. Compared with full-length αSNAP, removal of 23 amino acids from the N terminus results in a decreased affinity for SNAREs, and removal of 34 amino acids renders SNARE binding undetectable. However, amino acids 1–23 of αSNAP are not sufficient for SNARE binding because a mutant αSNAP consisting of amino acids 1–156 does not bind SNAREs (Fig.2 A). The anti-αSNAP antibody 2F10 interferes with the binding of SNAREs to αSNAP.2 Considering the critical role of the N terminus of αSNAP in SNARE binding, we applied the deletion mutants of αSNAP in a Western analysis to determine the epitope of 2F10. As depicted in Fig. 2 B, the antibody 2F10 recognized full-length αSNAP but none of the N-terminal truncation mutants. This coincidence suggests that the N terminus of αSNAP is directly involved in binding of neuronal SNAREs. The critical role of the N terminus of αSNAP in binding SNAREs is also supported by studies of the interaction of recombinant SNAREs with αSNAP (56Hayashi T. Yamasaki S. Nauenburg S. Binz T. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2317-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and electrophysiological experiments. In this study, a peptide derived from the N terminus of αSNAP inhibited calcium-induced exocytosis after microinjection into the giant axon of squid (57DeBello W.M. O'Connor V. Dresbach T. Whiteheart S.W. Wang S.S. Schweizer F.E. Betz H. Rothman J.E. Augustine G.J. Nature. 1995; 373: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Anin vitro transport assay that reconstituted vesicular intra-Golgi transport was developed by Rothman and co-workers (54Balch W.E. Dunphy W.G. Braell W.A. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 405-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 58Fries E. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3870-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Subsequent characterization of the transport reaction resulted in a consensus that this assay allows measurement of the fusion of Golgi-derived transport vesicles with early Golgi elements (59Balch W.E. Rothman J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 240: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 60Lin C.C. Love H.D. Gushue J.N. Bergeron J.J. Ostermann J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1457-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), establishing this assay as a tool to identify and characterize components of the transport machinery (61Mellman I. Simons K. Cell. 1992; 68: 829-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The antibody 2F10 inhibits the intra-Golgi transport reaction.2 This inhibition is caused by a depletion of αSNAP from both cytosol and membranes. The αSNAP-2F10 complex is predicted to be soluble and to be minimally invasive during the transport assay. In the first step we determined the time span for which the transport assay is sensitive for 2F10. Standard transport reactions were started, and 2F10 was added after discrete time intervals. As shown in Fig.3 A, the transport signal becomes independent of αSNAP within 20 min. The remaining incubation time of 40 min at 37 °C is required for the glycosylation of the vesicular stomatitis virus- encoded glycoprotein. In the second step we tested whether the transport inhibition caused by 2F10 is reversible. Transport was first inhibited by 2F10 for 20 min, and then αSNAP was added. As depicted in Fig. 3 B, the inhibition by 2F10 is reversible. The reversibility of the inhibition by 2F10 made it possible to divide the intra-Golgi transport reaction into two steps, enabling us to resolve requirements before and after αSNAP. In the first step, the reaction is inhibited by 2F10, allowing transport until the first αSNAP-dependent step is reached. Cells treated with N-ethylmaleimide accumulate docked vesicles at the Golgi apparatus (62Malhotra V. Orci L. Glick B.S. Block M.R. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1988; 54: 221-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). αSNAP and NSF were identified as protein targets of N-ethylmaleimide (63Wattenberg B.W. Raub T.J. Hiebsch R.R. Weidman P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), implying that the transport reaction is inhibited after the accumulation of docked transport intermediates. In the second step, this inhibition is reversed by the addition of recombinant αSNAP. At this point, substrates can be tested for their potential to inhibit the two-stage transport reaction, and the quality and quantity of inhibition can be compared with a standard one-stage transport reaction (Fig.3 C). The proteins p115, GOS28, and Rab6 have been implicated in intra-Golgi protein transport (for references see the Introduction), and we studied their role in the one- and two-stage transport assays. A polyclonal antiserum against the globular head domain of p115 was generated. Affinity-purified antibodies recognized a single band of 115 kDa of Chinese hamster ovary whole cell lysate in Western analysis (data not shown). We added increasing amounts of these antibodies to the transport reactions between 1 mKCl-treated Golgi membranes. As shown in Fig.4 (top panel), only the one-stage transport reaction but not the two-stage reaction was inhibited by the anti-p115 antibody. The inhibition reached a saturation at 400 ng of antibody/100-μl reaction that could be reversed by the addition of antigen (data not shown). Initially, the antibodies were tested in the standard intra-Golgi transport assay and did not inhibit protein transport (data not shown). Subsequently, K-Golgi membranes were used in the assay. Salt treatment removes p115 quantitatively from Golgi membranes, and cytosol becomes the only source of p115 (38Waters M.G. Clary D.O. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). 100 ng of NSF had to be added to the transport reaction in these experiments because the 1 m KCl wash removes NSF likewise. The degree of GTPγS inhibition is an indicator of to what extent vesicular transport as compared with uncoupled fusion contributes to the transport reaction (64Elazar Z. Orci L. Ostermann J. Amherdt M. Tanigawa G. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In our assay design, GTPγS inhibited the reaction by 60% (Fig. 4, bottom panel), suggesting that most of the transport signal is due to vesicular transport intermediates. We then examined the inhibition pattern of the cytoplasmic domain of GOS28 in the one- and two-stage transport assays. The cytoplasmic domain of GOS28 containing a hexahistidine motif at the N terminus was expressed in E. coli. The protein was purified from inclusion bodies after solubilization in urea. The protein was bound to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid matrix, renatured by applying a gradient of a decreasing concentration of urea, and eluted by a gradient of increasing imidazole concentration. In SDS-PAGE a single band of 26 kDa was observed (data not shown). The renatured cytoplasmic domain of GOS28 was added to the one- and two-stage transport assay using standard membranes. In both cases, a similar degree of 70% inhibition was observed. In the two-stage reaction, a 2.5-fold smaller amount of GOS28 was sufficient to achieve inhibition (Fig.5). Two control reactions for the specificity of GOS28 were carried out. 1) The effect of GOS28 can be neutralized by incubation with antibodies directed against GOS28 (data not shown); 2) the cytoplasmic domain of the plasma membrane SNARE synaptobrevin/VAMP was applied. Soluble recombinant synaptobrevin/VAMP was confirmed to be active by virtue of the fact that it forms a complex with the cytoplasmic domain of syntaxin 1a and SNAP25 that can be disassembled by αSNAP and NSF as described in Ref. 65Kee Y.
