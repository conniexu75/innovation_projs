https://openalex.org/W2138190884,Measurements of the inhibition of DNA synthesis in bacteria and the formation of thymine dimers by ultraviolet irradiation of the cells indicate that one thymine dimer per 350-IA strand of DNA acts as a block to further synthesis. In a sensitive strain of Escherichia coli the blocks are permanent. In a resistant strain the blocks are only temporary but recovery of synthesis is not the result of splitting dimers.
https://openalex.org/W2023603387,A survey of the literature of the past 50 years reveals remarkable consistency in the accumulated data relating mental functioning to genetic potentials. Intragroup resemblance in intellectual abilities increases in proportion to the degree genetic relationship.
https://openalex.org/W2063034492,"When the lens of the 5-day chick embryo is surgically reversed so that its epithelium faces the neural retina the elongation of those lens cells which have already differentiated is arrested and the epithelial cells differentiate into a new set of lens fibers. This internal reorganization, together with a reversal in polarity at the lens equator, results in a complete reversal of the polarity of the-entire lens."
https://openalex.org/W2027005500,Evidence is provided that organophosphate resistance in a strain of spider mites is due to decreased sensitivity of its cholinesterase to organophosphates. The cholinesterase activity of the susceptible strain in vitro was three times that of the resistant strain of mites.
https://openalex.org/W2001339082,"Polonium-210, which emits alpha particles, is a natural contaminant of tobacco. For an individual smoking two packages of cigarettes a day, the radiation dose to bronchial epithelium from Po(210) inhaled in cigarette smoke probably is at least seven times that from background sources, and in localized areas may be up to 1000 rem or more in 25 years. Radiation from this source may, therefore, be significant in the genesis of bronchial cancer in smokers."

https://openalex.org/W2065352215,"A survey of 425 death certificates of radiologists dying between the ages of 35 and 74 during the years 1948 to 1961 reveals a statistically highly significant excess of deaths from leukemia, multiple myeloma, and aplastic anemia. That this excess is due to radiation exposure (or to some factor acting in a similar manner), rather than to an artifact of diagnosis is suggested by the absence of deaths ascribed to chronic lymphatic leukemia."

https://openalex.org/W2064385039,The severity of signs of poisoning in rats after a single dose of DDT is directly proportional to the concentration of the compound in their brains. The concentrations associated with death after one large dose are about the same as those after many smaller doses.
https://openalex.org/W2090103994,"Serum from uninephrectomized rats was injected into normal recipient rats. This led to an increased incorporation of tritiated thymidine in the kidney cells, but not in the liver cells of the recipients. The results suggest that there is a humoral substance acting specifically on the kidney that promotes renal compensatory hyperplasia."
https://openalex.org/W2067407209,"Expansion of kaolinite with potassium acetate and with hydrazine followed by deuteration, shifts the absorption frequency at 3695 cm(-1) to lower values, but does not aflect the intensity of the 3620-cm(-1) absorption band. The band at 3695 cm(-1) is correlated predominantly to inner-surface hydroxyls with the dipole at right angles to the basal plane and the band at 3620 cm(-1) is related to inner hydroxyls with the dipole inclined toward empty octahedral sites."

https://openalex.org/W2038029993,"Although the variability of averaged evoked potentials as recorded from cortex in man has been a constant source of concern among investigators, the degree of variability has not received systematic treatment. The authors have accordingly undertaken an exploratory study of reliable differences that may occur in the first 300 msec of the averaged evoked response over long periods of time. Computer analysis of visually evoked responses in seven subjects over several weeks indicated stability of the response of each individual, with reliable intra-individual correlations. Inter-individual differences, however, were large. The evoked responses of different individuals were found to be unique."
https://openalex.org/W1963798487,"The interstitial cell of the green hydra is formed by dedifferentiation of specialized gastrodermal cells. Similarly, the epidermal epitheliomuscular cells are probably formed by direct differentiation of algae-laden digestive cells that lose their algae and enclosed food droplets, migrate to the periphery of the animal, and begin the mucous secretion characteristic of epidermal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2078267681,The formation of antibodies to bacteriophage T(2) in vitro was inhibited by 5 X 10(-8)M actinomycin D. This result is consistent with the concept that antibody formation depends upon DNA-dependent RNA synthesis.
https://openalex.org/W2028621620,"Unsystematic observations indicated that small children who could reverse the order of certain two-unit utterances had difficulty reversing utterances that formed common English sequences. Findings of this study indicate that the following factors are sources of difficulty in reversing pairs: (i) inability to separate English sequences into word units, and (ii) semantic absurdity of reversed pairs."
https://openalex.org/W2035395990,"O-Succinylhomoserine and N-succinylhomoserine have been synthesized. The first is rapidly transformed into the second by alkali. In acid, the second undergoes ring closure to the lactone, rather than the reverse acyl transfer. Neither supports the growth of methionine auxotrophs of Neurospora or Salmonella. However, bacterial extracts rapidly catalyze formation of a compound, chromatographically identical with cystathionine, from cysteine and O-succinylhomoserine. In the absence of cysteine the O-succinylhomoserine is converted to α-ketobutyrate. Both these reactions are absent from the same Salmonella mutant, and therefore are probably catalyzed by a single enzyme which is needed for methionine synthesis. Both reactions require pyridoxal phosphate. N-succinylhomoserine does not undergo either reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2032919000,"A virus having the characteristics of the papovaviruses was isolated from several naturally occurring cottontail papillomata. Serologic and animal inoculation studies indicate that it is not Shope papilloma virus, but a previously undescribed, nonpathogenic agent of cottontail rabbits."
https://openalex.org/W1963784564,"A dietary survey conducted in the southern highlands of Peru revealed two important sources of dietary calcium not previously reported. Mineral and ash calcium ingested as a food spice, and along with coca, raises the calcium intake from the low figures recorded by standard nutritional surveys to a more substantial level."
https://openalex.org/W2038844961,A modified negative staining technique suited to demonstrating fragile virus particles in the electron microscope revealed particles having a surrounding membranous sac and an internal filamentous component of a consistent diameter of 75 A in the blood of two patients with acute leukemia. No particles of this type were seen in the blood of four other patients with acute leukemia or in the blood of six normal individuals.
https://openalex.org/W1968371197,Vitamin D(3) placed directly into loops of rat duodenum in vitamin D deficient animals increases markedly the subsequent transport of calcium by slices of the duodenal loop in vitro. Under similar conditions the same dose of vitamin given intravenously or placed in a jejunal loop has little or no effect on the duodenal tissue. Thus the vitamin acts directly on the small intestine without prior activation in another organ.
https://openalex.org/W2077135892,"Antibodies, produced in rabbits, to each of three bacterial species have been doubly labeled with fluorescein and ferritin. Irrespective of which label was conjugated to the antibody first, immunologic activity was maintained. Moreover, these preparations gave as high a degree of specificity in fluorescent and electron microscopic studies as did singly labeled antibodies. Immunoelectrophoretic analyses and other immunologic tests further confirmed that the antibodies were conjugated to both labels without loss of specific activity. The technique thus permits the relatively simple method of immunofluorescence to be used as an aid in selecting optimum ferritin antibody conjugates for localizing of antigen at the molecular level by means of electron microscopy."

https://openalex.org/W2044235551,"Precipitins have been produced in the rabbit by injecting protein polysaccharide from bovine nasal cartilage in Freund's adjuvant. These antibodies did not precipitate either protein polysaccharides extracted from other species, or the separated protein and carbohydrate moieties of the antigen. It is postulated that the antibodies are directed toward determinants consisting of carbohydrate and amino acid residues linked in three-dimensional arrangements specific for different protein polysaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W2007305276,"Two small blobs and a channel excised from a slime mold plasmodium were allowed to fuse into a dumbbell-shaped mass in a thermally insulated Kamiya double chamber equipped with naked bead thermistors in contact with the blobs. Cyclic temperature differences of from 1 × 10-4 to 5 × 10-2 deg Celsius were recorded by a sensitive lock-in amplifier method with a basal noise level of less than 2 × 10-5 deg Celsius and a time constant of 0.5 second. The temperature differences were caused by periodic bursts of heat production synchronized perfectly with the shuttle-streaming cycle and invariably localized at the source rather than the destination of the streaming cytoplasm. The results support the theory that the motive force for cytoplasmic streaming in the slime mold is pressure, probably generated by contraction of elements in the channel walls."

https://openalex.org/W2019851758,"The enzymatic synthesis of citrulline from ammonia, bicarbonate, adenosine triphosphate, and L-ornithine takes place in the soluble fraction of gut tissue of the earthworm. The synthesis occurs at low ammonia concentrations, is dependent upon added N-acetyl-L-glutamate, and results in incorporation of the bicarbonate carbon into the ureido group of the citrulline molecule. Carbamyl phosphate is the intermediate in the reaction and its biosynthesis in the earthworm is mediated by a carbamyl phosphate synthetase system similar to that of ureotelic vertebrates."

https://openalex.org/W2049613601,Two-wavelength microspectrophotometry has shown that endoreduplicated cells in an x-irradiated culture of human leukocytes contained about twice as much DNA as diploid cells from the same culture. This supports the assumption that endoreduplicated cells represent a form of polyploidy.
https://openalex.org/W2050847449,Fluoroacetate inhibited respiration in Chlamydomonas reinhardti and greatly decreased the photosynthetic incorporation of C(14)O(2) into glutamate and aspartate. This suggests that the Krebs cycle is important in the light-mediated synthesis of glutamate and aspartate in this alga.

https://openalex.org/W2080440115,"In genetic crosses between mouse strains with low and high solubilities of hemoglobin, solubility segregated as a Mendelian unit and appeared to be determined by the alleles controlling alpha-chain structure. New data eliminate close linkage between the alpha-chain locus and genetic markers in linkage groups Ill, IV, XI, XIII, and XVI. Simplified methods are presented for screening differences inalpha-chain peptides and solubility."

https://openalex.org/W2089666626,"Serologically unrelated bacteriophages P22 and P221 that grow on Salmonella typhimurium are described. The phage P22 and a mutant P22h have short tails with hexagonal base plates, whereas P221 has a long, flexible tail without a base plate. P22h and P221 can recombine to exchange genetic markers. In the course of the recombination experiment, an unusual hybrid, P22-221Hy, was found. It mutates to P221 and P22S at a frequency of 10(-4) and 1O(-5), respectively. Unlike P22h, P22S gives clear plaques on both S. typhimurium, St, and its mutant, St/22, but is morphologically and serologically indistinguishable from P22 and P22h. The use of single-clone technique on P22-221Hy proved that a P22-221Hy genome consists of a P22h and a P221 genome and is carried by the P22h capsid. However, it seems probable that the information for synthesizing the P221 capsid may be suppressed by the information for synthesizing the P22h capsid. P22-221Hy is a stable hybrid rather than a heterozygote, because it does not segregate by passing through host cells. Thus,, one bacteriophage can carry the genetic information for two distinct bacteriophages."
https://openalex.org/W2066713631,"Deoxyguanylate when added to chick embryos grown in explant inhibited growth and development. Deoxycytidylate deaminase activity was inhibited both in the explants and in vitro; since the effect was quite specific, it is suggested that this may represent another control mechanism for deoxynucleotide synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2058406947,"For two samples of naval aviation cadets, curvilinear relationships were obtained between barometric pressure readings and the occurrence of signs of the onset of sleep on electroencephalograms obtained during routine EEG examinations. High and low barometric pressures relative to the prevailing average pressures were associated with increased proportions of subjects showing signs of onset of sleep."
https://openalex.org/W1978890561,"After hypertransfusion, normal ww and anemic WW(T) mice show the same increase in red-cell volume, decrease in reticulocytes, and temporary cessation of blood formation. The time required for the red cell volume to return to the value observed before treatment is the same for both groucps of inice. The cell volume at which new erythrocytes are again released into the circulation depends upon the genotype of functioning blood-forming tissue. Injections of erythropoietin stimulate red cell formation in polycythemic ww mice, but have much less (if any) effect upon polycythemic WW(T) mice."
https://openalex.org/W2090082727,"THE adult and juvenile forms of the liver fluke differ in their susceptibilities to a number of anthelmintics1. If it is assumed that anthelmintic drugs exert their effects by acting on enzymes or multiple enzyme systems in the parasite then the adult and immature fluke may not possess identical patterns of metabolism. Some of the pathways of intermediary metabolism in the adult fluke have recently been studied using substrates labelled with carbon-14 in conjunction with chromatographic and autoradiographic techniques for the separation of the labelled intermediates formed2. In the present work, a comparison has been made of the patterns of incorporation of radioactivity from carbon-14-labelled glucose, acetate and succinate into the soluble metabolic intermediates of adult and immature forms of Fasciola hepatica."

https://openalex.org/W1973624309,"IN work on soil fungus populations by soil dilution plating and other cultural techniques, it is sometimes necessary to incorporate some fungistatic agent with the culture medium so as to suppress excessive development on the isolation plates of fast-growing fungi that otherwise would overrun most of the other colonies. A fungus commonly causing trouble in this way is Trichoderma viride Fr., and so the observation by Vaartaja1 that the antibiotic duramycin inhibited the growth of T. viride even at 20 mg/l. seemed worthy of following up. Unfortunately, Lindenfelser et al.2 were unable to confirm Vaartaja's observation, as they found the minimum concentration of duramycin inhibiting growth of T. viride to exceed 100 mg/l."
https://openalex.org/W2083680103,"IN December 1962, a young roe buck was received at this laboratory for post-mortem examination. Incidental to other lesions there were about a dozen soft greyish nodules about 1.25 cm. diam. scattered throughout the surface and substance of the lungs. Microscopical examination of direct smears from these lesions revealed large numbers of first-stage Muellerius capillaris larvæ and several live embryos encased in egg capsules. No adult worms were identified, but their presence is inferred by these findings."
https://openalex.org/W2085884810,"The cesium-137 gamma activity of 10 lambs, which had been used previously to investigate some relations between potassium-40 content and composition, was measured on the Los Alamos human counter. An increase in the cesium/potassium ratio resulted from washing. Although large amounts of potassium were removed by the washing, little cesium was removed. Results indicate that the cesium/potassium ratio in the washed lambs and their components was fairly constant. Cesium levels in these lambs are compared to cesium levels in other animals in the United States and abroad. Possible relations between cesium levels and nuclear weapons tests are noted. (H.M.G.)"
https://openalex.org/W1964268310,"IN an attempt to examine the determining factor(s) for induction and duration of tolerance it had been shown that there was no correlation between persistence of labelled antigen and duration of tolerance, and therefore it was concluded that persistence of antigen per se is not the determining factor for maintaining the tolerant state1,2. In the work recorded here another parameter was examined, namely, the antigenicity of several heterologous proteins. Antigenicity was compared with the previously obtained results on the duration of neonatally induced immunological unresponsiveness1."
